{"text":"I'd driven by this establishment many times and never paid it much attention.  I finally made the effort to visit the Souper Market after purchasing a Groupon. 

Well, let me say that I am very glad that I did.  I tried two soups (Tomato Ginger and Spicy Chicken Chili Verde) and a Greek salad.  Everything I had was delicious.  I'm not a huge soup fan but these were fantastic.  

It's a little on the pricey side (compared to, say, a fast food lunch) but when you realize that you're paying for high-quality ingredients in freshly made soups, it's totally worth it.

This is a great example of an overlooked local establishment that once discovered is hard to forget.  I work nearby and plan to make this a regular lunchtime treat."}
{"text":"Very good food. Worth every penny. Jambalaya soup is the best!"}
{"text":"Love that you can taste the soup before you try it!!   The bread and butter is amazing.  The Caesar salad is really delicious."}
{"text":"Great service!  i loooooove the chicken parpikash.  i love sampling the vegan soups but i cant resist the paprikash!  i suggest being a vegan and sampling their vegan soups but get the chicken paprrikash ;)!  I never had a bad time there.  The people are very friendly"}
{"text":"I am waiting outside right now for them to open.  Love the Souoer Market so much.  Food is outstanding and really fresh.  So glad its cold outside again.  The folks who work here are always nice and helpful.  This is a must try for anyone who loves soup and salad, but the other food they offer like the chicken or grilled cheese, Amazing!"}
{"text":"Just excellent. The salad was fresh and delicious and the staff was very courteous.

If you don't know where it is you might miss it. There is a parking lot on the west side of the building which I am assuming customers may use."}
{"text":"Thank you, Souper Market, for making CLE+ proud. It's easily the best place to buy soup on the West Side, if not the whole region. This place is no frills: just soup and salads, but GEEZE is it delicious. Always super fresh food, the staff is great and the service is super fast. The seating area is pretty small; I think a lot of their business is takeout. I must admit I'm not a huge fan of their chicken noodle but out of the 10+ other kinds of soup I've had over the past two years, they were all fantastic. The selection changes frequently but some of my favorites are mushroom miso, crab gazpacho, pumpkin bisque, beer cheese and OF COURSE, chicken paprikash. Plus  I could eat the asparagus or greek salad every day - their homemade dressings are to die for. 

Quick Tip #1: If you're planning to try a new soup but aren't sure you'll like it, ask to taste it first!

Quick Tip #2: There are always vegetarian, vegan, dairy-free and gluten-free options."}
{"text":"Unfortunate hours and they stopped serving a bunch of items near closing time. I had the Jambalaya (which was decent) and bread (which was burnt/stale), so overall a bit of a let down. I suspect it would be better a second go around."}
{"text":"This is some of the best soup ever.

Good enough that we stop in and take some back to Columbus with us when we visit Cleveland.

Dude working was in soup nazi mode this last time we came in, not a happy guy at all, but the soup was amazing as always."}
{"text":"Every time we get carry out from Souper Market, we have to come home and watch \"The Soup Nazi\" episode of Seinfeld while we eat it.  I really like ordering the jambalaya, not only because it's a soup mentioned in the episode, but also because Souper Market does a really freakin' good job of making it.  I've never had a bad bowl here, although I get the jambalaya so often I can't actually remember what else I've tried.  Never fear, they do offer free samples.  The homemade bread is to die for.  I only wish its hours were more accommodating for people like me who work right in the middle of the day.  Or that it was open past 3 PM on Saturdays, or open on Sundays.  I don't know that I'd recommend eating in, since it's so small inside...but it's the perfect place when you're craving good, hot soup on a cold winter's day!"}
{"text":"Looking for some delicious soup on a cold night? The Souper Market offers a variety of outstanding soups and salads at very reasonable prices. They have some standards, but they also have a few soups of the week that rotate (you can find them on their website).

There's not alot of seating at the restaurant, maybe just 5 or 6 bar stools along the window and wall, so it's mainly for take out.

They also sell stock if you want high-quality beef, chicken, or vegetable stock for making your own soups."}
{"text":"Was feeling under the weather yesterday, so I decided soup was most necessary. I've heard great things about this place, so stopped here for lunch yesterday around noon. The line stretched to the door! 

I patiently waited while reading a Scene magazine from the front of the shop, so the line didn't bother me, but those behind me were complaining. 

Love me some chicken paprikash, so I decided on their chicken paprikash soup which was amazing, and a grilled cheese! I also decided on some chicken noodle for dinner which was just as yummy. 

Each soup comes with a large piece of bread, and I was lucky enough to snag a quart of mixed fruit that day for just five bucks! 

I will definitely be back for that chicken paprikash!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best soup around! You can tell its homemade and I haven't had a soup that I didn't like from here. Only thing is their prices are a bit steep, but it's hand crafted so I don't mind paying it once in awhile. It's hard to see, but don't pass it up!"}
{"text":"The best salads and soups of all time!  All of the soups are so delicious!!  They will let you try each and every one, if your heart desires.  The chicken paprikash is my absolute favorite but I also really enjoy the potato parmesan and kale.  

The salads are to die for and do yourself a favor and add the croutons, they are ridiculous delicious :)  

The establishment is pretty small in general and therefore only a few bar stools are available for dine-in.  Though, the artwork is super cute and entertaining, if you choose to dine inside instead of taking your food to go."}
{"text":"Yummy soup. The line is pretty long on a cold day, but it's worth it. They have multiple sizes available, the prices are reasonable, and I haven't tried a flavor that I don't like yet. Helps that they have vegetarian options and LOBSTER BISQUE. I love lobster to death. I wish it had a bit more lobster in it, but Cleveland isn't New England, so I suppose beggars can't be choosers. Each serving comes with a nice big chunk of bread and butter. The bread is nothing special, in my opinion, but they give you lots of butter, so it makes up for it :P"}
{"text":"Just had their special soup of the day today spicy green Tomato soup.. The best soup I've had there !! Pretty spicy and delicious !"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to grab lunch in Ohio City.  They sell soup and salad, and they are all superb. 

I come here for the soup.  The menu ranges from classic soups to creative/unique flavors, and they all are prepared very well.  I like to try something new here every time I stop by and I've never ordered something I don't like.  The menu is different every week.  You are allowed to sample before you buy, but I've never felt the need since it all is excellent.

I absolutely love the concept and its perfect for Cleveland where it is only hot for about 3 months/year.  I'm really a soup/salad/sandwich person when it comes to lunch, so obviously this place is heaven for me and I'm totally biased, but it also means I know a quality soup when I come across one.  This place is as good as it gets."}
{"text":"hey souper market!  do you still make my favorite soup-tomato ginger??  recent trips to the lakewood location has proven that this has not been on the menu and sadly, when i am sick or feeling the chill of cleveland coming on, tomato ginger is all that i want!
sometimes i wish that the souper market was a bit more on the ball.  on occasion, when dropping in i would find next to no one working or available to help out at the counter or the mop bucket to greet me.  not the tightest ship.  one of the saddest things ever is to get home to find the smallest end piece of that great bread in the bag.  lorain ave. location always has it together, lakewood needs some work."}
{"text":"I am glad that we gave this place a try today. On a brisk fall day delicious  soup was sure to warm me up and fill my belly just right. We had the jambalaya, harvest vegetable and potato kale. All yummy! The bread is excellent also. Look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"I had some kind of cheesy goodness (my coworker made a soup run and told me the soup of the day which escapes my mind currently as I'm preoccupied with reflections of how yummy it was) along with an awesome spot of bread- oh my goodness!  And I'll say it- I'll put it out there in the open- I had the larger sized soup which seemed to be WAY more than I thought it would be.  And I ate that whole container of soup (which isn't a good enough word for the tasty stuff).  And I ate that bread, too.  I usually don't love bread.  I feel like it is just sort of a placeholder- a vehicle for some kind of sauce, spread, etc. which leaves you no room for the main dish.  This bread though- you'll really enjoy it to say the least!"}
{"text":"Souper Market is my go-to for delicious lunch or easy dinner take-out. They always have a great variety of soups (which change often) and their crusty bread is TO DIE FOR. My favorite soups are the Chicken Paprikash, the Tomato Ginger, and the Red Pepper and Cheddar. 

Their salads are also incredible, so don't miss out on those. My favorite are the Asparagus salad and the Season's Greens. Lots of flavorful, fresh options. You can easily park at the metered area in the parking lot behind the building (close to Detroit). If you park in the non-metered area, those spots are for the Marc's plaza stores and there's a crazy attendant lady who WILL chase you down and yell at you. So if you park at the meters, you're good."}
{"text":"Decent food but awful customer service! Someone messed up my pickup order and instead of helping me resolve the issue, they brushed me off. I will definitely not a return to this poorly run establishment"}
{"text":"This was a great place to pick up lunch, if you like wings you are doing yourself a disservice if you don't try them."}
{"text":"Great soup options, especially in cold Cleveland.  Had salad and sandwiches and prices were very reasonable. I tasted all of the soups before I purchased and they have seasonal options as well... definitely a place to drop by in all seasons"}
{"text":"I'm vegan and this place had several vegan, vegetarian and non- veggie options. This was by far the best soup, salad and bread I've ever had!!! I had the veggie bean and kale soup- which was amazing! The green apple salad without blue cheese, was so fresh (the candied pecans just came out of the oven). And the bread- HEAVEN!  I will definitely be back and recommend you give it a try!"}
{"text":"Because it's a soup place and their soup isn't really that good is the reason I gave it two stars. I've had the chicken paprikash and it was just ok. I didn't care for the mushrooms in it at all, and I love mushrooms so that's saying something. Sampled the clam Chowder with was pretty much discussing and tasted like it had been sitting there all day. I will say their balsamic dressing is to die for and I actually buy it by the pint for $4.75. I stop in there only for their dressing! Order a salad I'd say..."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch...their soups and salads are very different then your average. The price is right! Friendly,fast , & affordable! YUMMY"}
{"text":"The joke used to be that there are two seasons in Cleveland: winter and road construction. Not any more, my friends, not any more. Now the two seasons in Cleveland are Hot Soup Season and Chilled Soup Season. And, just as we're likely to get 80 degree weather in February and frost warnings in May, these seasons have a whole lotta flexibility. Chicken Paprikash in June? YES PLEASE! Tomato Ginger in December? Hell YES! Market Greens, classic Caesar or a Season's Greens salad all year 'round? Yes times 3. 

If you want a bowl of bland, salty and flavorless \"soup,\" do not go to Souper Market. But if you want a bowl of rich, mouthwatering and filling soups, stews, chowders, bisques and broths, don't worry about what the calendar says, just get yourself to Souper Market now."}
{"text":"Everyone knows about the soups, but eat the salads also.most are $5, but really fresh and the dressings are amazing. i always get the greek, my girl the seasons greens. i'm more than happy to pay $9 for a 12oz soup and giant salad for dinner when it fills me up and i know the money is going to a local entrepreneur.  the ohio city location has been completely rehabed and has about 20 counter seats now! The people who complain about limited seating no longer have a reason to complain!"}
{"text":"I usually stop by the Carnegie location when I am downtown. This is one of the few places that I will eat soup. The soup is always tasty and fresh and the service is good. The only thing I will complain about is that I can never get mushroom soup or beef barley soup. They need to make these more often."}
{"text":"first off, i love soup. it is something i eat constantly and make constantly. my mom and i were creeping around lakewood trying to have lunch somewhere when we decided to step in here. cold cleveland weather is the perfect time for soup.

they had about 8 up for grabs, so she and i had soup and salads. i had the chickpea veggie (aka gypsy soup) and it was delicious and spicy. i am a baby when it comes to spice, but this was good. also had the market greens salad which was very fresh and had delicious basil vinaigrette dressing.

moms had potato leek and swiss soup i believe, as well as a bleu greens salad. she killed it all.

everything was really fresh, and while there's not a lot of dine in space (a couple tables and 2 counters) it's good to stop in. everything is available for takeout, so that's awesome too.

i will be back. i love soup 4evz."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of soup, but I LOVE this soup. It's so good. And I recently bought some veggie stock to make my own soup at home. It was delicious and the girl was very helpful in giving me tips for at home soup making. So nice!"}
{"text":"This is a great stop for an easy meal, if you're of the soup-eating persuasion. As the name suggests, this place specializes in soup. They have a deal of three varieties and bread for a reasonable price-- I recommend this as a way to try the dozen or so varieties available on any given day. The chicken noodle was pretty solid, but the  mushroom barley was only okay. Overall, a good choice for a tasty, convenient meal."}
{"text":"I love the selection of soups and specials! So many different choices that can satisfy a variety of dietary needs. The paprikash is rich, as is the cream of mushroom. It's a treat for me to get them, as I usually try to stick to good old chicken noodle or lighter options. The salads are huge and there are so many great choices.

We had to wait awhile in line to order, but it was lunch time and the employees were friendly and welcoming. Once we ordered we had our food fast! 

I brought home confit wings for my son and he really enjoyed the spice."}
{"text":"Management is completely unprofessional, in the treatment of staff. They harass them through messages even fire them through text. My friend lost her job and the manager continuously told her how much the co-workers hated her. This is bullying in the work place."}
{"text":"Souper Market is one of those places that makes me wish I lived in Cleveland. After a brisk walk in the falling snow, their chicken noodle soup was perfect, as was dipping the most excellent accompanying bread in it. Soup is so elemental and fulfilling when made as well as this was -- and a steal at the price. I would truly have enjoyed stopping there again had I more time while in town, as the mushroom marsala veloute and several other soups demanded my attention. Plus they sell fresh stock if you run out! Incredible!"}
{"text":"The soup's we tried were very good but the seating is strange.  The seating area is way too small and customers that are placing an order are way too close to you.  The man at the counter wasn't friendly or helpful.  The price seems extravagant, it is just soup."}
{"text":"Great healthy eatery with decent prices and quality soups and salads can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"ah, soup.

souper market is good eats.  i go here with friends.  me and my bff. 

we both love soup.  and, uh...we love the outdoors...and um...snow peas...

we can go here and talk.  we love talking..and not talking.  we could not talk or talk *forever*.

all whilst eating soup at the souper market."}
{"text":"A go-to for anyone who works or lives around Kamm's Corner. The menu is constantly changing, and it is great if you just want something for lunch for yourself or if you need to get something for the whole family for dinner. You can't go wrong with any of their soups. And the bread is always super fresh! Also super affordable ... it's making me hungry just thinking about it. Good thing I'm planning to go for lunch in a few days. Yum!"}
{"text":"Greeted as soon as we walked in the door!  Very friendly!  The chicken paprikash soup was so delicious and came with a huge hunk of rustic bread!   There is a nice selection of fresh soups with something for everyone....vegan and gluten free.  Two specials per week.  I went back and had the paprikash....AGAIN.  I can't get away from it!   Several sizes to choose from (very reasonably priced).  Salads available, sandwiches, all fresh.

I purchased a homemade chocolate chip cookie that had a surprise in the middle, shhhh!  It's an OREO!  Who wouldn't LOVE THAT?

Canned Sodas, bottled water, and other drinks for sale.  They don't have drinking cups, so be aware."}
{"text":"Yummmm!  I LOVE the Chicken Paprikash, especially the mushrooms in it!  Their grilled cheese sandwiches are delicious, and the asparagus salad is a HIT.  Their bread is soooo good!  Way to go Kamms!"}
{"text":"Sauntered in here on Friday, and the service was GREAT! Met another guy working at this location who reminds me of Jason Segel. Can't be bad!

Latest recommendation: Mulligatawny. Deeeee-licious!

And can I also mention how Jason Segel lookalike didn't mind cutting into a fresh loaf of bread 15 minutes before closing time just so I wouldn't have to suffer with the end piece? Now that's service!"}
{"text":"If you haven't been to any of the Souper Market locations you are missing out! I definitely prefer this place over Panera any day! My favorite soups from here are any soups with corn or chorizo in them and how can you deny the bread? YUM! My favorite salad is the Green Apple. 

Just go here!!"}
{"text":"Awful, awful, awful. I ordered a salad and they couldn't be bothered to put a lid on the dressing properly so when then lean it up against the side so dressing spills everywhere as soon as you open it. I called and asked to speak to a manager multiple times and they always lied and said there wasn't one or they were too busy, at 3pm on a weekend? Doubtful. They told me a manager would call me back. They never called me back. This over priced average meal resulted in stains on my suit that dry cleaning was unable to completely remove. They don't care. They all wear jeans and T-Shirts so maybe they don't understand the value of business attire.Unfortunately, their ignorance doesn't replace the cost of my ruined clothes. I will not be returning to this sorry excuse for a restaurant. They used to have such a great staff and a decent product but now they have a bunch of rude people who lie to attempt to cover themselves. 

I'll update this review if a manager actually does return my phone calls, which is doubtful since it has already been over a week. If you have nice clothes that can't be washed do not order salads from this place. In fact if you have anything you care about on you, you should probably avoid this place entirely."}
{"text":"A good variety of soup. The mushroom bisque was the best out of the three we had! A good sized Greek salad rounded out the meal. We also got a huge fruit salad for five dollars. Hoping to get the confit chicken wings the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Just drove past this place and found it intriguing, so I stopped. Not sure if this is the original Zoup or not, but the idea is the same. 

Got a Greek salad and a bowl of soup, the salad was very good and very fresh. The soup I tried was African peanut. I have never had peanuts in a soup before, but it gave it a nice character. It had shredded chicken and was chock-full of vegetables.

The service was quick and I ate inside at a bench overlooking beautiful Carnegie Avenue. I would eat here again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Amazing soup!!  Service is excellent and the food was very flavorful.  Great choices in soup and salad.  They also sell Randy's Pickles!"}
{"text":"A great little place. The scenary is not much but the variety of soup and salads offered are great. The workers are always very friendly and allowed me to sample all the soups my first time there. I love that they offer a variety of vinaigrettes and even have them to sell by the pint.

I go at least once a week for lunch."}
{"text":"I'm a soup fiend. I think my mom did it to me; her favorite food is soup and her least favorite temperature is cold, so we had a lot of soup about 9 months out of the year here in Ohio. 

I had had Souper Market soup before actually coming to this location because the cafe I work for sells it, so I knew there was some delicious,steamy, brothy goodness coming my way when I bought the Souper Market Groupon. 

I've tried a lot of the soups, but the tomato ginger is by far my favorite. Ginger is a new obsession of mine and if it weren't so terribly strange and probably unfortunate for my stomach, I'd probably have ginger ale and ginger soup together for every meal...well, not really, but it's tempting. 

I haven't tried a salad here, but from the looks of it, they're good at those too. The bread is also super and perfect for soup! Go figure!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a quick, fresh meal. It's the area's best alternative to fast food. I usually go for the salads, which are made when you order and very fresh.  No old, slimy lettuce or tasteless tomatoes here.  The staff is friendly and attentive. They provide huge portions of bread that is crusty but soft on the inside.  It's so simple, but I love the Market Greens salad. A serving of chicken paprikash is great in the fall or winter.  There's not a ton of room for dining in. I think 2 small tables in addition to seating facing the wall and window."}
{"text":"Was looking for a new lunch place. As soon as I walked in, I found myself waiting in a long line (a good sign). The place is ideal for takeout, but does have some seats and a counter along the window if you want to eat there. No tables though, so don't expect to sit across from your bestie chatting it up. 

Had the jambalaya and a Greek salad. Both were excellent. Jambalaya was the perfect level of spicy for me. All soups come with a big hunk of bread on the side. Salad was pretty good (hey, it's a salad...). I'll definitely be coming back to try the other soups in the future."}
{"text":"Great soup. Both the Jambalaya and Chicken Paprikash were filling and so tasty. Chicken noodle was not AS good as these two, but I have yet to have anything but an amazing soup from this place... Dining partner ordered a grilled cheese, which was freshly cooked, and had the perfect amount of cheese. Nomz.

Absolutely worth running into for a quick lunch but wish it was open an hour later for dinner."}
{"text":"Fresh and flavorful soup with variety of choices.  Chicken Paprikash is to die for and the Lobster Bisque and Jambalaya are also delicious.  I still need to try some of the other soups and salads.  Some people think it is a bit pricey for soup but it high qualty so worth it."}
{"text":"I had the flu and wanted some chicken noodle soup but was not feeling up to making it myself so I thought now's my chance to try that soup place and I'm glad I did! I got a 12 ounce chicken noodle soup,it tasted as if I made it myself and the huge slice of bread was perfect for dipping.I will be back to try more! My only complaint would be too much broth,it was overfilled so I had to open it on a stack of napkins.it was hot and spilling over so be careful!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Souper Market a few times, and each time I leave with the same feeling.  It's good soup, no doubt about it.  However, it is just too expensive for what I get.  Yesterday, picked up the chicken papikash - 32 oz..  ($13.75)  My wife consumed over half the container, and that was before her main meal - she is not overwieght nor do I consider her a heavy eater.  Yes, I admit it was good - the bread that comes with it - good, also.  However, it is just too expensive for me to go on a consistent basis."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with this place!! I love the environment and the attitude of all the workers! They are so nice and funny! My favorite things to order are the Asparagus Salad, it comes with this tomato olive vinaigrette that is sooooo delicious! I actually bought some so that I could put it on all my salads that I make at home! My favorite soup is the Chicken Paprikash sometimes I like to mix it up by getting half Chicken Paprikash and half jambalaya!! They also make a damn good grilled cheese! You really can't go wrong with anything you order from here!"}
{"text":"Some soups are great, some are just okay.  The Chicken Paprikash was good but I felt it needed a touch more seasoning.  The autumn clam soup was brothy (like the guy said) but it was just okay.  Of bigger disappointment was the fact they didn't have any bread.  The apple, pecan, and feta salad is amazing, and the balsamic salad dressing is an absolute winner on that salad--thick and tangy."}
{"text":"Was in Ohio City yesterday and stopped in at lunch with my friend Diane, a fellow Yelper! Ordered Potato, Swiss Cheese & Spinach Soup served with a big chunk of fresh bread!  Small space for sitting.  Loved the decor!  Great choice of soups Diane ordered the fresh Jambalaya soup made with pulled pork, shrimp, chicken and spicy andouille in a tomato base!  Bread was delicious. Sweet and soft on inside and crispy on the outside.  Had daily specials.  Can get soup and a sandwich for $7.00   Has three local locations in Cleveland.  Kind of reminds me of a simplified Panera Bread.  Good quality!"}
{"text":"I was having a rough morning. Just had a medical procedure and all I wanted was some comforting soup. I ordered the curry chick pea soup and it completely turned my day around. Amazing to the last bite. The bread was warm and had the perfect combination of crispy, flaky outside and soft inside. I am literally so happy right now, because soup!"}
{"text":"Best soup in town??? I think so.  This is definitely not soup from a  can.  All the soups are well seasoned.  My favorite is the chicken peprikash, it's  super peppery.  If you are not a spice fan beware of the jambalaya soup, sometimes it can be \"burn your face-off\"  hot.  I have had almost all the soups there.  They are all really good, rustic and filling.  The soups come with a piece of bread. They have packets oyster cracks, you  just have to ask.  Also, if you are not sure of which soup you want, they will give you a sample. Vegan choices are available.

My wife enjoys the salads.  They're always fresh- made to order and are a decent size. The grill cheese is good but nothing special.  People rave about their wings - I never tried them but I know they run out all the time.  They are open only during the week and only till 6. Best to go early because once they run out of something,  then you're  out of luck."}
{"text":"As the name suggests, Souper Market serves a wide variety of soups (and some salads), most are great, some are just average. It's a nice place to get food to go. Just park in the parking lot next door. 

The first time I went here, my chicken paprikash soup and fresh salad were delicious and the service was wonderful. 

The second time I went here, still unfamiliar with the menu, I asked the lady behind the counter for a cheesy bread to go with my soup, since I had received one the first time I came in. She seemed annoyed, and said there was no cheesy bread. There is a grilled cheese on the menu, which someone else working there kindly shared with me, but this grumpy lady was absolutely caught up in semantics and would not let me order a \"cheesy bread\". The other nice lady rung up my order while the grumpy lady angrily rolled her eyes at me, furrowed her non-existent eyebrows, and began preparing my cheesy bread. The cheesy bread was mediocre. I won't order another CHEESY BREAD.

The third time I went here was the last because of what I witnessed happen between the customer ordering ahead of me and the same grumpy lady behind the counter! I definitely was not going to order another cheesy bread and actually had a little anxiety upon entering the restaurant and seeing the same employee who was so rude to me before. I didn't want to interact with her. The customer in front of me ordered a salad without cheese and sincerely asked for the grumpy lady to leave the cheese off because whoever makes it always puts cheese on it. The grumpy lady said basically \"uhhh no we don't\" and the customer said \"well for me you do.\" So at check out, the customer looks in the bag to see that the grumpy employee purposely put cheese on the salad!! No apologies, just a cold comment of \"Oh, I forgot.\" (Yeah right...) Then she turned her back on the paying customer and walked away, with no attempt to rectify the situation. 

So basically, the food is pretty good most of the time. However, the last time I ordered the soup of the day it was wayyyy too salty and some of the lettuce in my salad still had dirt on it. I can make a better salad any day. In my opinion, this place is overrated. But the primary reason I won't return is this horrible employee who is flat out rude to customers who have sincere questions and concerns. Besides, who wants an angry person preparing their food?"}
{"text":"I used to go to this place all the time, but at some point recently I feel like I'm shelling out too much for too little. The soup is tasty, although most of the bisques and chowders are so so rich with little balance.  Service is usually good; I find the prices a bit high."}
{"text":"Phenomenal.  I came in on Wednesday cuz I'd been wanting soup all day.  Since I live in Cuyahoga Falls, I ordered several soups to be eaten over the next few days.
I ordered the Chicken Paprikash, Potato & Kale, Creamy Mushroom, Lentil & Sausage, and the Clam & Chorizo.
OMFG these soups are so good... I have eaten or tried all of them and they're great.  
I can't wait to come back and get more - These f--kers are on top of the soup game!"}
{"text":"Love this place, I usually stick with the same soup all the time,  chicken paprikash, but decided to try the garlic and crab bisque it was delicious!  I also had the green apple salad and it so good!  Everything is always so fresh and wonderful, love having you in Lakewood!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Soupermarket!!!   Amazing, fresh, and healthy choices. The staff is friendly and welcoming.  Will definitely come back"}
{"text":"I have lived in Cleveland my whole life and have never been to this place until last month.  Now my new go-to soup place! 

I love love love their green apple salad! The candied pecans are sweet and roasted evenly without that slightly burnt taste.  The sweetness from the pecans helps cut through the tangyness of the blue cheese.  The salad gets a large crunch factor from the fresh crisp (granny smith?) apples.  

I usually get the chicken paprikash soup with my salad.  It's hearty without being overly heavy.  Many other chicken parikash soups are very creamy and thick; their chicken parikash is just right.  Plus they load their soup up with plenty of chicken and mini dumplings and it hits the spot on a cold day.  The mini dumplings are just doughy enough to remind you of mom's homemade soup.  The chicken is suculent and tender to the bite :).  

I've had their clam chowder, which is loaded with clams as well.  Their clam chowder is slightly soupier than the typical thick New England clam chowder so it's slightly healthier since they use less cream, which is always a plus!  The soup is well seasoned with lots of vegetable chunks in the soup.  I prefer slightly thicker clam chowders, but this soup still satisfies the craving.  I would still take the chicken parikash over the clam chowder.

Also, you always get a slice of fresh baked warm bread to go with the soup- I LOVE RIPPING UP THE BREAD AND LETTING THE PIECES SIT AND SOAK IN THE SOUP!  It has a hard outer bread shell with soft inners that are perfect for soaking the broth. 

The service is super friendly and helpful in picking out soups.  I'm excited to try out their wintery selections! 

The soups are a little on the pricey side (for soups), but when you taste the ingredients and see how many chicken/clams/vegetables they put in the soup- it is well worth it.  My soup is filled with lots of meats/vegetables, not broth :)."}
{"text":"Lobster Bisque omg  and in the fall..pumpkin soup or is it squash?? Idk but it is delish! 

Side note. Try the grilled cheese."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to go to Souper Market FOREVER!!!  I was running a few errands in the W 25th area and I wanted a quick, light bite to eat.  

I walked in and wast a bit confused by the setup.  There was a cash register immediately as I walked in.  Do I order here?  Do I order at the other end?  I'm confused!  The girl behind the counter was incredibly grumpy looking and did not offer a hello, a smile, a greeting, or anything.  I thought perhaps she was helping the gaggle of women that were huddling around the counter.  They left and I finally asked, \"Do I order here.?\"  \"Yeah, that's fine.\" was the reply.  Clearly, I felt welcome.

I made my simple order of roasted red pepper soup and dined in.  The soup was wonderful.  Hot, delish, and perfect portion for what i was looking.  The soup came with a nice size of sour-dough bread.  It was crispy on the edges and soft in the center.  PERFECT!

Would I return?  Yes.  Food: good.  Quality: good.  Price: ok.  Service: lame."}
{"text":"Souper Market is by far the best soup restaurant I have been to. Ever. The soup is delicious! It's never too sweet, and never too salty. It has  won like ten million awards that I think they totally deserved. Me and my family were about to get on the road and drive a couple of hours but we decided to stop for lunch. We stopped here, and being tired, cold, hungry, and even a little sick, eating here hit the spot. Right. In. The stomach. You think I'm being cheesy? Well, guess what I think? YOU SHOULD EAT HERE! It's \"souper!\""}
{"text":"Love this place for lunch.  I've tried a seafood bisque, a tomato soup that rocked and a few others.  Plus an included crust of bread!  Also the grilled cheese sandwiches are just like mom's.  Will be back for more for sure."}
{"text":"Soup is such a wonderful comfort food. This Souper Market is a great place to drop in for a quick lunch. It's $3.75-$4 for an 8oz and it comes with a warm piece of fresh bread. Vegetarian and vegan options are available too. Mmmmm soup.

That is all."}
{"text":"I love the salads here, very big portions and if I add chicken I'm full for the rest of the day! Also the chilled soups are really,really tasty. Their jambalaya is to die for! i get mine with some extra spice in it. Each week they bring a new and delicious soup to their menu so be sure to check in every time if you're a soup lover. They make take home stock great for recipes at home. They also have other options from soup and salad, their wings are delicious and crispy, their grilled cheese melts in your mouth!! i highly recommend this place for a quick, delicious and affordable lunch!!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love the Souper Market! Whether for a hot bowl of soup, a comforting grilled cheese, or their amazing salads with in house made dressing, this is the place to go!! Smells and tastes phenom! And don't leave without a vegan cookie, they are the best cookies ever!! (No we aren't vegan)"}
{"text":"Great soup and salad near University Circle. Only open during business hours during the week. Parking can be a bit confusing the first time, so park in the parking lot just west of the store.

Hours of Operation:
Monday - Friday 11-5
Closed Saturday & Sunday"}
{"text":"We had just finished watching and listening to city officials honor the veterans of Lakewood at the stirring ceremony held at the park.  The wind whistled off the lake with that familiar November chill and leaves fell like snowflakes all about us as we hustled back to the car.  Heading home I pulled in front of the Souper Market and my wife and I thrust ourselves into the crowd gathered before the counter.  Service was quick and efficient and the locals seemed to enjoy a camaraderie as we stood shoulder to shoulder.  it was as if we shared a secret that the only thing to burn off that chill in our bones was the magical potion held in those disposable bowls.  I walked away with a hearty bisque and she settled for a traditional noodle but we both were glad the traffic was light because only minutes later we sat before the fireplace in our classic (ancient) Lakewood home sipping and slurping the awesome treats engineered at Lakewood's Souper Market.  Support our local businesses - you'll be the benefactor."}
{"text":"I think about the asparagus salad here all the time. I really love the dressing. The bf always gets the green apple salad which he also thinks is great. I've tried some of the soups and haven't found one I really really like yet. Not that they have been bad it's just I actually like their salads better. I've had the shrimp gazpacho, regular gazpacho, jambalaya, mushroom barley, and chicken paprikash. And I never want the same one again when I go back."}
{"text":"I am a frequent customer of Kamms souper market. That was until today. my son and I went in to eat and sat at the counter next to the soups, I ordered jambalya and a cheese sandwich and it was excellent. The franchise owner is new and he was the only one there. He took the soup up to the register instead of sitting it down in front of me.I got up and got my soup and sat back down to eat. He then took my sons soup up to the register. He then hollered back down to me the bill was$17.00 dollars and some change. I held up the $20.00 I had sitting in front of me and he said I will ring you up down here. I walked back up to give him the money and saw my sons soup sitting there. He never said a word about it. I took the soup back down to my son and he put my change on the counter by the register. Then he walked right by us at the counter to go in the back to make our sandwiches. Sitting on the counter next to us was all the empty new  soup containers. If I were to sneeze it would be all over them. When we got up to leave he never said a word to my son or I. He acted as if he didnt care if we came in or not. Very rude. We will not be going back to his place again."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge soup fan, but it was close and I was starving. There was a long line and it was 2pm in the afternoon, not sure if it was from slow service or b/c it is great soup. Either way, I had the jambalaya and it was great!"}
{"text":"Visited the souper market for a quick Saturday lunch bite.  The staff was incredibly friendly and let me try a few different soups before ordering. I ended up getting the jambalaya and it was fantastic-a little spicy, generous amounts of chicken, chicken sausage and crawfish. Will definitely be going back again."}
{"text":"A great little hole in the wall for soup.  Nothing extraordinary but good soup.  They don't do much else."}
{"text":"Grilled cheese and soup!  Perfect!  No seating inside, you get it to go.  Amazing soups!!!  We bring in from here once a month, its great!  The line goes fast, don't fret!"}
{"text":"I'm addicted to the chicken paprikash soup. I love this place. The green apple salad also never disappoints."}
{"text":"I wanted to go here for months and I finally was able to on a cold Saturday night. While the server seemed annoyed that we were there an hour before closing, the soups blinded me from it. I knew that I wanted the lobster bisque from my laboring over the online menu and my friend tested various soups, finally choosing the jambalaya. They were absolutely delicious and perfect in every way, and the bread was a wonderful addition. I hope to see you soon, soupermarket."}
{"text":"The jambalaya is good.   It's spicy, but not overbearing.  It's just enough heat to make it interesting."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! The jambalaya is amazing and the workers are great as well :) if you haven't ate here yet, you're missing out!"}
{"text":"Great lunch! When it's a chilly October day, this is the BEST place to go for lunch. Their chicken noodle soup is insanely good, especially with the bread that comes with it. They also have good salads, but I really love their soup."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised at the vegan options available. I asked to try the curry lentil soup (it had a hard to pronounce name that starts with M). It was surprisingly delicious. Not because I thought it would taste bad. It was just really, really good. I wish this place was in Atlanta but I will definitely try to make it back whenever I'm in the Cleveland area."}
{"text":"Came here today with my grandmother after running errands at around 2:45PM. I was in the mood for a salad and she was looking to try one of the non-soup options. When we arrived they were not serving the wings and had apparently sold out of the grilled cheese, which was unfortunate. I guess we eat lunch a little later than most?
I got the green apple salad, per usual it was delicious.
She got the chicken noodle and enjoyed it. 

While I have never had a complaint about the food at any of the locations, I will say that the service is always lackluster. My grandmother is a very jokey person, when she heard they were sold out she made a quick quip (nothing insulting or offensive) and the woman just stared at her. I'm not looking for entertainment here, but people at least have a personality. The way they were acting you'd think they were doing us a favor. A simple smile and some graciousness goes a long way. If the soup weren't so good I would never go there because I always feel like I'm being judged or inconveniencing someone when I do."}
{"text":"Sweet little place for really good soup on a freezing cold day like today. Asparagus salad without the olives (bc I hate olives) was delish and I even liked the dressing despite it containing some olives, so that's a positive.  Broccoli potato soup was amazing and the chicken paprikash was even better than that! (Had to try it bc of all the recommendations and now I recommend it too!)"}
{"text":"ah, my favorite season is upon us, along with the cool, dark nights of hot chocolate and soup in front of the glow of my 52\" TV (yeah, no fireplace at my apartment, the TV somehow doesn't quite sound as romantic, well, maybe to all the guys who want to come over for MNF, but that's a completely other story!).

Now, I like making my own soup and stews, but they usually require a whole day of my time over the stove and so a place that does cheap, hearty and tasty soups that I can get in different sizes is a godsend for me.  And I've just found my new place of worship....

I held off my review for a few days because I wanted to try all of the 4 soups that I picked up from there the other day.  I must make special mention of the chicken paprikash that I had for lunch today....heavenly, I could almost feel the angels descending from the heavens to sing me songs to lull me into the \"itits\".  I sure hope that is one of their regular soups b/c I'll be getting that one every time I stop in here!

Also tried out their lobster bisque, the mulligatawny and the tomato-ginger....like Cara said, I'm going to have to step up my own soup making otherwise I'm just going to keep coming here for all my soup-related needs!

They also do salads if you want inject a bit of greens into your meal, I got the greek salad and it was solid eating, loved the artichokes on there.

Their bread is also amazing, I was lucky when I stopped in, they were just pulling out fresh loaves from the oven and I had to wait for a couple of minutes for my bread....warm bread straight out of the oven?  No problem, I'll wait a couple of minutes!

One of my favorite things about this place is the fact that you can get 4 different sizes of soup, everything from a nice single-serving portion all the way up to family-size.  Or, in my case, my \"lunch for a week\" size..."}
{"text":"Small, bare bones soup and salad restaurant on the side of a produce warehouse. Easily missed, so look for the inconspicuous wall sign and adjacent fenced parking lot. 
8-10 Fresh made soups for eat in at the window counter or take out come with a huge slice of home made sourdough bread. Choose your soup size from 8 to 32 ounces. 
Or, choose from 8 or so large fresh salads and a plethora of dressings.
Soft drinks and teas available."}
{"text":"Great soup and hearty stocks combined with great bread... just a bit too salty to be perfect.

Since it's a 35 mile drive I stocked up on 4 kids of soup, 2 stocks and a dressing.  We had a tasting as soon as I got home and will freeze most of it... but I don't think it will last long!

Great depth of flavor, the bisque is quite hearty, the tomato is nice and bright, the vinaigrette will make a great chicken marinade and the veal stock is amazing.

The bread is hearty and perfect for dunking... the salads looked amazing... just a little bit too much salt in everything for that 5th star!"}
{"text":"First visit, got Jambalaya for me and Creamy Wild Mushroom for the wife.  We were both very happy.  Best soup place I've tried.  The Jambalaya was nice and spicy!  Although it doesn't come with some white rice on top, the bread provided was excellent for dipping.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place 4.5 stars but I rounded down. Where do I start... the souper market is Super D Duper indeed. They have a wide variety of soups that is constantly changing even though they keep some of their soups on the menu consistently.  All the soups I have tried here have been flavorful. You can tell that they are homemade and not that processed garbage that you get at places like Zoup and Panera. This is one of the best places to get soup and salad in town. Salads are also fresh and flavorful. The OC location is super small inside with enough space for just a few stools at the window sill so I usually take my food and leave. It isn't one of those places where you are going to want to stay for awhile but definitely worth checking out year round!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite lunch spot. It is a great value; I haven't had a soup that I did not like yet, and the bread is delicious. My favorite so far has been the pumpkin bisque. The chicken paprikash, and the parmesan corn chowder stand out for me as well."}
{"text":"I love the Souper Market! I've had two soups here, but because the Jambalaya is sooooo good it's the only one I eat now! You must try this place!!!"}
{"text":"I frequent this place for lunch because it's the best healthy, fresh, and fast option around! 

Food: I'm obsessed with their toasted corn gazpacho and green apple salad. Love the amount of food you get with the combo meals, best value for your money. Comes with salad, soup, and bread. The bread is phenomenal and crispy, the homemade dressings are crazy flavorful, and the toppings on the salads are so generous! These people don't mess around. Soup selection is always large and the seasonal stuff is always fun and original. Never had the grilled cheese or chicken wings but I hear they are good. I mean the bread is heaven, so the grilled cheese is probably heaven too! 

Service: Young, hip, and friendly. They know their soups and offer suggestions/recommendations if you ask. They will let you sample a bunch too. You can tell they are proud of their product. 

I wish they didn't get rid of their loyalty program. People come her so regularly and it would be awesome to get some reward for continuing to choose Souper Market!"}
{"text":"IT IS RUDE WHEN ESTABLISHMENTS CLOSE BEFORE THEY ARE SCHEDULED TO. I love this place but lost respect today when I arrived 7 minutes before they closed for a quick to go order and the door was locked, the guy looked at me and just shook his head. Rude."}
{"text":"I moved to Seattle two years ago and I still wake up with cravings for Souper Market. Open one here. I'll help run it."}
{"text":"Went to souper market for the first time yesterday and it was awesome! Got the chicken paprikash, kale soup special and a green apple salad and it was ALL great! For those commenting on price, I think that $20 for two pints of soup and a salad is not a bad deal considering I often spend $10 at Zoup or Panera for lunch for an 8oz serving of soup that comes out of a prepared box with a dinky side salad.  The staff was very helpful and nice.  If you are in the area definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"Such a great spot.  Staff is very friendly and there are so  many awesome options.  You can't really beat the value either.  Don't shy away from the salads; they're incredible make one hell of a meal with a side of soup.  The jambalaya here may be one of my favorite dishes in the area.  So glad they're in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"While there are some mainstays on the menu, a large portion of the soups are seasonal so there is always reason to go back in to try the new ones. Most, if not all, are organic which is also nice and always creates a better flavor. There is also a wide variety of gluten free and veggie friendly ones.

Their salads are also fresh and creative! They are not your typical chicken and shredded yellow cheese fast food variety. They have unique and fragrant white cheeses as well as crispy fresh fruits to go on them. I believe their dressings are home made as well and I've never been disappointed by them, and I'm normally not a fan of dressing at all. I used to only order dressing as a way to \"lube up\" a salad, or else eating one feels like you are choking down a rake full of cold foliage.  Their dressings however are fantastic and flavorful without fighting the natural texture and flavor of the salad. Rather, it compliments the flavor, like it should.  

There are several to choose from so you can create a large variety of lunch and dinner options between all the salads and 8 or so soups that are available on any given day. Meaning you could eat here frequently and not be bored by it and if you are ordering for the office they will have some combination suitable for everyone. There isn't much of a menu beyond the soups and salads so they seem to cater mostly to the lunch time crowds. I would love to see them add a few more options like sandwiches and perhaps some small selection of baked goods for dessert. 

All the soups are made fresh daily so the later in the day you go, the more likely they are to be out of your first choice. However, every time they have been out of one or more soups I ordered they've always give me a price break or upped the size of my order for free. That is very generous and I have never been treated to that at other restaurants. Usually if they are out of something, oh well. But here they really want to see you leave happy.

They are willing give you a small sample of soup if you ask them so you can taste test which one you want before you buy it, a nice touch. I agree to an extent with some other reviewers that not all of their soups are knock your socks off phenomenal, though I've never had a bad one. The trend I notice in the reviews, and with my own experience, is that the more \"typical\" soups like chicken noodle or broccoli cheese aren't jaw dropping amazing. But really, how many times have you had a memorable chicken noodle soup? They all tend to be the same and they seem to be on the menu to cater to less adventurous eaters (you'll always have that one person in the group who sticks their nose up at anything new or different. They are there like a tiny pizza at a chinese buffet). But I would never compare their soups to campbell's canned sodium bombs. There is a distinct quality and taste difference. I can't fathom how many cartons of cigarettes you would have to smoke per day to confuse the two. Maybe twenty? ish?

So in short, bonus points for a nice staff, Bar style seating which allows you to people watch out the window, seasonal varieties, Mexican Coke, and awesome salads. Minus a few points for lack of SAMMICHES and brownies to stuff my food hole with."}
{"text":"If you looking for food that warms the soul, you've come to the right place.  You really can't lose, no matter what you order.  This place has many options for those with special dietary needs. AND you can try as many as your like before you make your selection.  My personal favorite is the Muluhgtany.  

You just feel good after eating these soups which are packed full of vegetables.  The bread that comes with it is outstanding.  It's right out of the oven and warm.  If you aren't a soup person, their salads are equally packed full of good stuff!

Try to get there before the lunch hour around noon, otherwise expect a short wait (up to 15 minutes).  It's right by Cleveland Clinic and CWRU if you're looking for a lunch spot.  There's limited seating, it's more of a take your food to go kinda place but there are some stools along a bar along the window if you are eating in."}
{"text":"Man it's been forever since I first reviewed Souper. Update on my favorite souper soup: my new favorite is either the mulligatawny or the white bean and kale. Not sure if I could choose between the two. Really all their soups are my favorite so honestly you can't go wrong with any of their flavors."}
{"text":"4.5 stars

this was the first place i visited during my day trip to cleveland.  it is located adjacent to a couple of closed establishments, and on the opposite side of the building that holds other bustling establishments, such as flying fig.  my friend and i came in to a slightly dark interior, and a very pleasant server behind the counter.  he asked whether we wanted to try any samples. they were all so good! but we decided on getting a Spicy Lobster & Chorizo Bisque and a Jambalaya soup, each in the smallest 8oz size.  Each soup portion was accompanied by a piece of bread wrapped in foil.  

I'll start off by saying that the Jambalaya soup is good enough by itself (without the bread), to be sufficient enough as a meal.  it is very hearty, with chunks of sausage.  but with the bisque, the bread was the best accompaniment.  the bread itself was very fresh and absorbed the less viscous bisque very well.  in fact, by the end of my meal, there was not a single drop left in my plastic soup container, as i soaked every last bit of it up with the bread.  -0.5 point only for the temperature of the soup, which was just a tad lukewarm for my taste. i understand, though, that keeping the temperature of the soup too hot while sitting out in the front may cause it to evaporate and change the taste of the soup itself. if i'm in cleveland again, i'll be back!"}
{"text":"You couldn't find a better staff since they went under new management at the Kamms Corner location. Always super friendly and helpful when ordering. I love it here and the food is SO GOOD. I crave it all the time. I highly recommend to anyone and everyone in the area!"}
{"text":"I had put off going here and now I wish I still was putting it off. First, I know it cost me less than ten dollars to make at least six quarts of chicken soup. At Souper Market prices my soup pot is worth $70.50.

More importantly the broth simply did not taste chickeny and the strings of chicken were unpleasant. The bread was equally tasteless, just a hard crust and an airy interior. I know I am a minority as every body else seems to love this place.

I will go to Chicago Deli in Solon for really good chicken soup or to Kheim's in Lakewood for chicken pho when I have my next cold. Till then I am looking for a safe to store my home made chicken soup."}
{"text":"I tried the stuffed pepper soup, and it was solid. I can definitely see myself stocking up on various quarts of Souper Market soup as the weather gets chillier!"}
{"text":"Great soup.  I mean GREAT SOUP.  I'm not a salad person, but they looked good too.  Tasty bread served alongside my soup (not sure if it's house-made or from one of the guys at the West Side Market).

On the downside, it really is basically a carry-out place.  There's maybe 6 stools along the counter, so if you were hoping to eat there, good luck.  And if it's a cold day (hey, that's when you usually feel like soup) you'll catch every breeze when the door opens."}
{"text":"Cute little place on lorain across from Walgreens at camms corner.  Had the lobster bisque and grilled cheese.  Delicious! Limited bar seating and limited parking. Would recommend and I'll be back!"}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite eateries in Lakewood. Delicious soups and salads, friendly staff, cozy atmosphere....love this place! My new favorite, and the food is so damn good. I got the Tomato and ginger soup and a grilled cheese sandwhich which was well worth me cheating my diet for lol. Try it out!!"}
{"text":"Great soup! Probably one of the best clam chowders I've had. And I've been to the New England area lots of times. Not a fan of the bread they give with it though, very tough. No worries though, I shared it with nature :)"}
{"text":"We're from out of town. Spent 3 weeks in Cleveland.  These soups were hands down the best food around. The chicken paprikash is both mine and my husband's favorite. The crusty sourdough bread that comes with the soup is amazing!!  Took some frozen stocks (conveniently unsalted) home for cooking. The turkey bone broth also comes frozen and is really, really good. You can truly taste? that the bones were slow roasted prior to slow simmering. Also visited the Ohio City location.  We were so happy to see other locations around.  Do you ship to NJ, because we miss you already??!!"}
{"text":"There are several mentions of the \"Soup Nazi\" from Seinfeld here, and that was what Souper Market quickly conjured up in my mind as well.  In other words, a tiny storefront with only ten or so barstool seats, serving up little more than an assortment of eight or ten absurdly delicious and fresh-tasting soups in to-go containers.  (There are also salads.)

But as others say, there is no verbally-abusive, control-freak \"Nazi\" at the helm here.  Instead, a rather uncommunicative but efficient young fella waited on us behind the counter; he seemed kinda peeved that we and a couple of other customers had interrupted his mid-afternoon kitchen-prep tasks and his Mission of Burma clangor.  The soup is served in eight-, twelve-, sixteen-and-even-bigger ounce portions, and it comes with a big slice of almost perfect crusty bread.  (The bread almost certainly comes from one of the stalls in the incredible West Side Market across the way.)  We tried the Roasted Ratatouille and Tomato Ginger, and I thought both were complex and balanced enough that they could have been hi-jacked from the kitchen of a good high-end restaurant.

Souper Market is yet another example of a dining establishment attaining excellence by focusing like a laser on just one small area of expertise and not getting caught up in trying to do too much.  

Top-notch.  The only reason I don't go with five stars is the Spartan-ness of it all."}
{"text":"Great soup. They have their every day selections of soup but have specials each day. I have honestly have only tried the Parikash, Clam Chowder? and Jambalaya cuz they are SO good. Salads are huge and more than enough for one human. They will give a huge chunk of fresh bread with each soup order but feel free to ask for just crackers. Cannot go wrong. I really need to branch out and try other sous but ......I am hooked on my favorites. Parking is good. Service can be slow but not due to staff-due to customers not being prepared or large orders. The staff is always efficient."}
{"text":"Love this spot! Great food and great. Prices! I love the asparagus salad, cesar and the chicken paprikash soup!! Yummmm!!! 
Great lunch and or dinner! All soups come with a nice big chunky warm slice of italian loaf bread! Soo good!! Healthy and hearty. There are always weekly specials and you can taste try all the soups! 
However, keep in mind that it's more of a take out spot. There is some seating but nothing formal. Otherwise, great place!"}
{"text":"Great food, rude staff. W 25 location is a total disaster, as they regularly run out of the most popular items by 3pm.  They also randomly close for 15-20 mins if the cashier needs to go get change. I've contacted the owner Matt, and its clear he gives zero f's about customer satisfaction. Not going there any longer as I'm tired of contributing to this lazy owner's salary."}
{"text":"Still loving Souper Market, but now this is my nearest location. 

Granted I don't think I've come in during peak lunch times, but I've literally never experienced a line here. Furthermore, they're the fastest at prepping the salads. And since I almost always order their Greek Salad with chicken, it's great that I can be in and out in under 5 minutes--and even that's pushing it! 

Also, there's paid parking in the lot next to the building, but if you're lucky enough, you can snag one of the free, 15 minute parking spots out front."}
{"text":"This place saved our asses. Like a safe haven to those cold, hungry, and those suffering from minor fast food malnutrition, Souper Market was there for me. 

What's really awesome about this place is that they give samples of their wide variety of soup. Just see what you gravitate to, and you'll most likely love it. The best deal is the salad + soup combo (8oz for the hungry and 12 oz. for the famished), which comes with a hunk of their artisan bread. Their salads are delicious not just because they use awesome ingredients, but also because their dressing is seriously, amazing. 

Seating is pretty limited, so you might want to take yours to go and enjoy at the best place in the world, which is your bed in front of the warm glow of your television."}
{"text":"If you have happened on a couple of my other reviews you can tell I get around ....today's adventure was here in Cleveland while I was waiting to get unloaded at produce packing Inc I had seen the souper market an figured I would try it.  Had the creamy corn and chorizo soup and you get a large piece of fresh made sourdough bread and yummy ! Nice and hot fresh made  and bursting with flavor . walk in only tho but u can park at the corner of 77th and carnage and walk to the restaurant it worth the walk ! Also picked up some chicken paprikash  and some creamy Parmesan potato & kale and 2 large salads to bring home for dinner cost was 31.00 in total which for Cleveland is cheap  definitely worth trying out especially if on a diet !"}
{"text":"I love this place. Super close to work and easily accessible with rear parking, it's perfect for quick lunch breaks or something to grab on the way home. They have such diverse soups and i've yet to try one I didn't like. The Chicken Paprikash soup is unbelievably good. All of their soup choices are fresh and different and delicious parings. Even their salads are phenomenal, and SO fresh you can keep them in the fridge a day or two without them going soggy! Plus the staff is excellent and super attentive to customers needs. i'll keep coming back!"}
{"text":"i went to Souper Market with some friends yesterday.   The soup was fantastic!  I ordered the chicken noodle.  It was without a doubt the best chicken noddle soup I have ever eaten.  I ordered a quart of stock.  I can not wait to cook with it.  I am sure it will help me create a delicious meal.  I am looking forward to Souper Market lunches from now on. Worth every penny!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to pick up a quick lunch during the week. Tomato ginger soup is a must and I usually grab a Greek salad to go along with it. Always fresh and I'm never disappointed!"}
{"text":"Had the worst experience here.  It was my first time here and i went with alot of excitement.  I had seen on their menu they had jumbalaya and was excited to try it, went in and inquired about getting some without shrimp since i am not into sea food, was immediately told no.  So then the next thing i saw that i would try was their lunch special grilled cheese with their spicy green tomato soup and again being that it was 15 minutes after 2 she turned me down for that.  I ended up with chicken noodle soup that i could have made from a can.  was SO discouraged at the customer service here."}
{"text":"Soup for vegetarians, vegans and carnivores alike!!!

My favorite soups: potato/parmesan and cream of mushroom.  
My favorite salads: asparagus salad, Greek salad.

Easy to park, and quick service."}
{"text":"The jalepeno aioli on the slaw was outstanding. We sampled all the soups and most were good. The jambalaya soup hit the spot on a cold winter day. It is worth another visit!"}
{"text":"\"MMMM Noodle Soup\" - Joey from Friends ... anyone? 

This place has some dang good soup, and at a very reasonable price! For $6 - a hefty helping of soup, and a large piece of rustic bread - THANK YOU Souper Market! 

Veggie Chili is great, the Winter Bean Stew is heavenly, and the Chicken Noodle Soup is the perfect thing for a cold winter's day ... I all of a sudden want to be in slippers.  

They have multiple size options (8oz, 12oz, 16oz, and 32oz), but I'd recommend the 16oz for lunch/dinner.  Perfect amount!"}
{"text":"So, I've checked in here a few times. Like 27 at the time I'm writing this. 

Scary thing is, I don't remember to check in most of the time. No, really. 

Ok, look, it's close to where I work, but so are a lot of other eateries. (And I visit the Lakewood location semi-regularly as well.) But I choose Souper Market at least once a week for lunch. Here's why: 

- Variety. And more variety. And it changes all the time. The weekly specials are all over the place, and there have only been a few duds yet. Lots of creative choices, things most of us wouldn't think to put together in a soup, and then whammmo - it works, superbly. 

- Healthy-ish. You can make anything unhealthy, but Souper Market does an excellent job of offering lots of healthy choices, if you can resist the jambalaya and wings every time. (For the record - a recent addition to the menu - Veggie Bean and Kale - is vegan and full of leafy green kale and is hearty and yummy.) 

- The wings. The wings. The wings. Absolute best thing to happen to wings since buffalo style first became popular. (They are NOT buffalo wings.) Spicy without being overpoweringly hot, fall off the bone - quite literally - tender, juicy. Everyone I work with will back me up on this -- there have been times I've had to go there and order 3 dozen wings to take back to the office. 

- The dudes that work there. Ok. Look. I'll publicly admit this: I think the guys that work there are cute. But that's not the reason I keep going back. They're awesome. They bust their asses every day at lunch rush -- the line is sometimes out the door -- but never fail to be gracious to all of the non-regulars who ask a thousand questions (even as I'm sometimes rolling my eyes at these folks in line) and are quick to fill a stupid special order (like my asking for the Veggie Bean & Kale with just a little beans... Seriously, that was a ridiculous request, but he just smiled and kept going -- and I got my bean-lite bean soup.) 

- Price: House made Soup and Salad - with freshly baked (scrumptious) bread (and butter and oyster crackers if you ask) and a drink for $10. Sure you can get cheaper food for lunch, but not of this quality and freshness. 

The only complaint I've ever had is that they're very fond of mushrooms, so quite a few of the soups and specials have these added in. Sadly, an allergy keeps me from being able to slurp those up. But you know, that's my own issue. Not theirs. 

I'll keep checking in here regularly. Count on that."}
{"text":"The ladies were super nice and accommodating of my needs. I am sick with a cold and they've helped me get the right soups!

The disappointing thing that kept this place from 5 stars is the giant sticker and sign in front of you when you're sitting facing the street.

I like a good view when I eat and this doesn't have one. 


Other than that, I highly recommend to absolutely anyone with meningitis, HIV, the common cold, or even if you're just looking for good soup :)"}
{"text":"I could happily eat at Souper Market every single day. Their soups are incredible. I love their salads (particularly the asparagus salad with a tomato olive vinaigrette that makes me want to eat lettuce). Their chicken paprikash soup is my favorite, with spatzle and mushrooms throughout. I wish they offered more than just chicken as a protein addition to salads."}
{"text":"Grille Cheese and Soup .. amazing... i love this place !!"}
{"text":"Great soups and awesome grilled cheese.  I am sad when they run of out grilled cheese.  Chicken jambalaya is the best.  Great homemade  bread!"}
{"text":"In addition to a Zpack and Claritin, chicken noodle soup was just what the doctor ordered.  So when Cara took me to Souper Market last week, I went for a combo of chicken noodle soup and asparagus salad.  

Sure, the guy who took our order was a bit cocky and they were out of several of the dressings and we had to wait a tad bit for the lettuce since they ran out that day; but the wait wasn't bad and everything really was super fresh and delicious.  Moderately priced too!

For a tiny little place, Souper Market does have a great selection of soups and salads.  I highly recommend doing a combo. It comes with a big piece of fresh bread and makes for a filling lunch for sure.  

**Note that Souper Market is very casual and there isn't much room to eat in, so it may be best to do take out.  (That's what we did!)"}
{"text":"Most restaurants don't pay close enough attention to their soups.  Soup houses exist to remind the world how great soup can be when you actually, you know, try to make it well.

Souper Market: I like it.  I like that you can sample the soups before you buy them.  I ended up buying the mulligatawny, not exactly an authentic mulligatawny, but a tasty one nonetheless.  I tasted the tomato-ginger, which I thought was solid even though I don't usually like tomato soup.  I had the market greens salad, too, though I didn't really care for the basil vinaigrette that came with it.  It just tasted like I was drizzling plain olive oil over my salad.  I wish I could comment on the bread, but they were out of it when I was there.

I see they have chilled soups as well, so it looks like this place is a year-round no-fail."}
{"text":"After twice a day drive-by's and recommendations from everyone and anyone I know, I finally tried Souper Market- and it absolutely lived up to expectations. I got the Chicken Paprikash for lunch and it was delicious and filling. And the bread. Oh the bread. It deserves its own rave review.

For the food, Souper Market gets 5 stars.  

The only downsides as far as I can see are: its a bit pricey for what it is ($7 for a lunch size portion of soup), the location and long lines make it hard to get in and out of during lunch, and theres not much seating so there is a good chance you'll get takeout, leaving you with cold soup that needs to be reheated by the time you're back at work/home. 

All of the soups on the board looked amazing though and I know I'll be back- we have way too many cold snowy days here in Cleveland not to!"}
{"text":"Meh...
I tried this place for the first time and was so excited. I got the red pepper soup, lentil soup, mushroom barley soup, and potato spinach swiss soup. 

my friend LOVED the red pepper soup since the flavors grew as you drank it.
The lentil soup was pretty decent.
Mushroom barley soup was good but it was a bit too salty for me.
the potato spinach swiss soup had a bit of a sourness to it that i didn't enjoy. 

When I entered the market, it had a weird smell to it and the soups didn't look appetizing. However, since I gave up meat for lent, I haven't yet been able to try any of their 'famous' dishes so I will be back to give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Awesome! Fresh soup and a warm grill cheese. I love this place everytime I stop in for soup."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite spot to have lunch and even dinner. A wonderful and delicious array of soups and salads that will satisfy your tongue and tummy. I've met the owner a couple of times now, and it is clear that he is passionate about what he does, which shows cleanly and clearly through his smiling workers and food quality. This particular location offers wings (which I haven't tried yet). I recommend the Blue Greens salad (with bacon), the Chicken Paprikash Soup (to die for), and lobster bisque. They have vegetarian and vegan options as well. Worried about committing to a soup you may not like? No worries. They let you try it before buying. AND they give you a giant slice of sourdough bread to go along with it. Ok. I'm done rambling now. Just trust me and go already! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"This was my favorite spot when I lived on the east side. I went there so often that i was literally embarrassed. I would go twice a day sometimes...

Believe me. The soup is THAT good. And the salads, too. They let you try out the soups before purchasing and give you a giant slice of fresh sourdough to go with it. Couldn't be happier. Haven't gone yet? Make sure you go. Like. Now. GO!"}
{"text":"Best jambalaya in Cleveland and I'm a huge huge fan of their cookies too. I just tried the strawberry soup recently, which is more like a strawberry smoothie, and I've been craving more since!"}
{"text":"The first time I tried this place I was very disappointed in the grilled cheese and spicy tomato soup.  The grilled cheese was hard and didn't taste good. The soup was strangely spicy, not a good spice. But today was great! The Greek salad was amazing. The dressing wasn't too sweet, and the salad had a lot of different ingredients on it. The roasted corn gazpacho was extremely tasty. I would say this place is hit or miss, but it's worth a try. I wish they had actual seating inside."}
{"text":"The only whine I have is that it was only takeout, no dine-in.

That said, it was grrrrrrrrrrreat! Super friendly dudes behind the counter. I had the Mulligatawny and the Beet Salad (both vegan - the salad w/out the cheese of course) and my mom had Pulled Chicken Noodle Soup and the Seasons Greens Salad. We were both very pleased with our meals and the HUGE chunks of bread. Although, my balsamic dressing had the texture of pudding, which was odd...

Anyway, I'd definitely go back. Everything tasted fresh, flavorful and full of love."}
{"text":"PROS
-Best Caesar Salad in all the land. I cannot get enough of this salad. I don't think I even liked Caesar Salads before I had this one. And now, I can't eat any other Caesar Salads because this is the best one I have ever had. The homemade dressing and croutons really makes it amazing. And don't forget the optional bacon bits!
-Amazing soups. So I know I'm obsessed with the salads, but obviously they are also known for their soups. I recently had the creamy wild mushroom soup and it hit the spot. And I don't even like mushrooms. Are you sensing a theme here? Their food is so good they are turning my tastebuds against me! 
-Fresh bread. Always get the bread. Always. It's warm and fluffy and carb goodness.
-Homemade. Everything is homemade or from local vendors. Can I get a CLE what?!
-Loyalty card. After 10 soup, salad or combos, you get one free! 

CONS
-Hours of operation. I really wish they were open later on weeknights (past 7p), because I would definitely hit them up for dinner. And I wish they were open on Sundays, but I realize that people have lives and they can't be feeding my face with soup and salad 24/7.

BOTTOM LINE
-Best place for soup and salad all year round! And don't forget a slice of bread!"}
{"text":"While the name implies that this place is all about soup, I am in it for the salads!

PROS
~~The Caesar Salad~~ I have gone to countless other places and order the Caesar and I have yet to find one the compares to the Souper Market's glorious version of it. Thick, crunchy, flavorful croutons. Homemade dressing. Bacon (because it makes everything better). And I always order it with an extra slice of fresh bread (I think it's from Stone Oven Bakery). 

~~Delicious soups~~ While I am obsessed with the salad, when the weather starts to cool down, Souper Market is usually my first choice for a nice, warm-me-up lunch. I have yet to try a soup I didn't like, but my favorite is the Creamy Wild Mushroom Soup.

~~Selection of soups and salads...and samples!~~ Good luck narrowing down your lunch choice; it will be hard to pick just one! They have both seasonal and weekly specials. And if you are just not sure what you'd like, just ask for a sample so you can try before you buy.

~~Now open Sundays!!!~~ I recently walked by on a Sunday afternoon and was surprised to see that my fav lunch spot was open. So of course I walked in and got a Caesar salad!.

CONS
~~Seating~~ If you were planning on bringing a posse of more than 2 people, you will need to order to-go. Luckily, there are plenty of picnicky places near by that would be perfect for an afternoon outing.

~~Hours~~ While I am ecstatic that they are now open on Sundays, I have a hard time getting to this location before they close at 7p on weeknights. More my problem than theirs--I think most people eat dinner before then!

BOTTOM LINE
~~Souper Market has SUPER salad and soups and serves the best Caesar Salad in the greater Cleveland area.~~"}
{"text":"The asparagus salad is my favorite thing in the world - the house-made dressings make the difference. Can't go wrong with soup, either. I'm a big fan of the jambalaya, and just had the special this week (creamy chicken with spinach and artichoke). I have trouble deciding when I go if I want a soup and salad, or a soup and grilled cheese. If I had it my way, I'd get them all!"}
{"text":"Went in for the first time and was pleasantly surprised! The line moved quickly, the cashier was friendly, and the jambalaya soup was delicious with a good kick!"}
{"text":"It's been years since I started going to Souper Market and wrote my first review.  I have tried almost all of their locations and have never been disappointed.  

The pulled chicken noodle is my husband's favorite and he loves the bread that comes with it.  

I'm a bit more adventurous and have tried and loved many soups, the corn chowder, and chicken paprikash stand out in my mind.  I still love the green apple salad and will go out of my way to get one.  The dressing is amazing, and I'll admit I'm devoted to this salad."}
{"text":"Awesome service and the soups are amazing!!! Would definitely recommend!!! The lady who greeted us was so nice!!!"}
{"text":"OVERPRICED!!! I believe you could get the same quality from a can for a fraction of the price. Staff is friendly but they kinda have to be because of the cost. I honestly believe that progresso soup might actually taste better."}
{"text":"I have to be honest here - the soup is 5 stars, 10 stars! I love it. Every single one that I've tried, I have loved. 

The 2 star loss has to do with the customer service. \"Soup Nazi\" pops up a lot when you read reviews for this place and it's easy to see why. I was picking up an order (of 4 soups) and noticed that there was only one piece of bread included. The bread is one of the biggest reasons to even go - it's amazing. When I brought this to the attention of the cashier, he told me there's no more bread. Flat out. No more bread. Ok. So meanwhile, I was paying paying my bill and the woman behind me also asked for bread. No bread for her, either. By the time my card goes through the machine - which is maybe all of 90 seconds - there's a full tray of warm, fluffy, amazing bread brought out from kitchen. 
 
So, having no shame I hopped on that and told them they still owed me four pieces, but I was sort of disappointed that no one bothered to tell me \"Oh, if you stick around for one more minute, we'll have some more bread on the way out.\" 

It's a huge difference if you're going out of your way to get lunch here, and if a customer (or several) go out of their ways to specifically ask."}
{"text":"I love the Jambalaya! Literally, I'd go once a week if I could. There is a newer young lady and she is the sweetest person ever!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat. The jambalaya soup is heavenly! Service is always great also"}
{"text":"I really wanted to find out that this place is my new favorite soup joint after reading the reviews. Went there in the afternoon. Planned on eating inside but there were only 5 or 6 seats at a small bar area and all were taken so no hope there but it's a good sign that a place is crowded. Decided to just take the soup and salad home and eat them. The jambalaya was spicy the way I like it. Made me sweat just a little bit which is perfect. Had full sized shrimp in it which is another plus.

Both soup and salad were \"good but not excellent\" I would say. Maybe I caught them on a bad day? Anyway I expected a bit more bang for the buck as the soup wasn't cheap. The salad left something to be desired in terms of overall taste as well. Bottom line... if I lived closer I might like this place better than Zoup! in Independence but as it stands Zoup! wins this battle for me in terms of taste, $ value, and room to stretch out and relax. Yeah yeah I know... A CHAIN over a mom and pop!? BOOOO HISSSS! Yes I know I'm stingy with my stars and just plain evil."}
{"text":"Seriously one of my favorite food spots ever!! I don't live super close by but I make it a point to get the market greens salad and chicken paprikash soup whenever I can! I also love love love the cheesy grilled cheese!! And my daughter loves the pulled chicken noodle!! Yummm! I just wish they were open on Sunday and longer hours on saturday!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I love the fact that they have so many options. They offer traditional soups, chowders , salads, sandwiches and wings. 

I purchased the crab chowder, salad (the one with green apples), and the wings. I wanted to sample what they had. Everything was amazing! The chowder was perfection. The salad was crisp and fresh and the wings were ridiculously good. 

Overall, I'll be back again!"}
{"text":"I love the concept of this place. Good soups with a nice hunk of bread for dipping. Salads are a decent accompaniment, but don't kid yourself. You are here for the soup!

I got the soup trio with curry pumpkin,  chorizo chowder and The lobster bisque. The curry pumpkin had a very nice spice to it very smooth and creamy, I could've used a little more heat but that was easily taken care of with the hot sauce on hand. I really enjoyed the chorizo chowder. Excellent spice, good texture  provided by a little bit of crunchy chorizo mixed in. overall great flavor and my favorite of the three (but I'm a sucker for anything with chorizo!). Lobster bisque was excellent too.  if it's on the menu get it. Nice touch of spice to cut through the rich tomato cream base. 


If it is winter plan on getting food to go. The eating area is a few stools lining the window front and with the door opening and closing, this place has a constant flow of customers. It's going to be pretty chilly in there.

If you're in the area definitely give this place a try. all the soups I have had have been excellent and I've never left disappointed or hungry."}
{"text":"Unassuming, quaint and no \"no soup for you\". When you walk in, the first thing you notice is the simplicity of the set up and the soup Nazi. Except the soup Nazi is not real and the soups are \"souper\". There are about 8 bar stools if you want to dine-in but most folks just take out. In season now (and what I've tasted) is the clam chowder and spicy chicken chilli. Both are good. Be warned, though, their spicy does mean hot spicy. Not \"we used a lot of spices to make this dish\". Try it, you'll like it. They also have another location on Detroit in Lakewood."}
{"text":"Best soup in town, I mean this is seriously good stuff.  Been going to the market location for 10+ years and now they've branched out with same quality.

Blue greens salad is over the top with real blue cheese.  Real and fresh ingredients every time.  Kids and myself live the Pulled Chicken but I occasionally mix it up.

Just great food and service every time!  Filling with the bread for around $5, can't beat that!"}
{"text":"How does any successful business achieve excellence? How do they maintain consistently good craftsmanship in their product? I have an idea how....

By paying attention to the details. It's what separates the good from the bad. It's the small things that have an enormous impact on the finished product. Most chains or big box stores cut corners to save time and money. This isn't the case with the well run mom & pop joints like Souper Market though. This soup house prides themselves on creating hand-crafted soups and stocks made from scratch, using the finest ingredients they can obtain. 

One particular detail that sets them apart from other soup houses is their use of homemade stocks. Particularly veal stock. Who uses veal stock besides aspiring foodies and gourmet chefs? To those in the know, veal stock is a magical elixir that when used as a base, sauce, stock or reduction can transform a mediocre dish into something divine. 

If anyone has ever provided the labor of love in creating this rich brown stock or have read the infamous musings from Cleveland's own Michael Ruhlman, you can surely attest to the magic that is veal stock.... 

\"Few people put veal stock in the same category as, say, the Goldberg Variations or Plato's cave allegory and this lack of understanding amazes me . .  it's one of the most powerful tools in professional kitchens, one of the biggest guns in the professional chef's entire arsenal, and it's virtually unknown to the home cook. If there is a single ingredient that could transform a cook's repertoire at home, it's veal stock.\" -Michael Ruhlman

What Ruhlman is saying is that there is a secret ingredient that is at our disposal. Using veal stock as a base and taking the time to prepare it from scratch instead of cheaping out for the overly salted broth packaged by Swanson's is key to any superior soup. 

Needless to say, Souper Market won me over when I saw that they use and even sell homemade veal, chicken, fish and vegetable stock. Details are key. It was inevitable that the soup that followed would be good. And it was."}
{"text":"By far the worst location yet. Female has the worst attitude. They never answer the phone. So, I ordered from grubhub for lunch so I didn't have to interact with that negative energy...bad decision. True disaster. Order green apple salad, chicken, no onion, extra nuts and extra dressing, with a grilled cheese. 
Looking at the invoice from GH, the order states no grilled cheese available. So I called SM, they told me they didn't have the order, yet. NP- I call GH, they contacted SM while I waited on the phone. No sandwich, SM will adjust the bill. Order comes- Pecans burnt as always, no chicken on the salad, and two un-identified oil filled orange dressings. Yuk! I call SM - the girl on the phone states that it was GH fault that the order was wrong???? That statement made absolutely NO sense. She tells me she will refund my $1.00 and then hangs up the phone!!! I call GH, they could not reach SM, but assured me my bill would be adjusted. Today I was charged for the total amount of a sandwich, salad, extra nuts, dressing and chicken. $21 plus  aggravation. Called GH, they tried to contact SM w/ no luck, but they did adjust my bill. Thanks GH.

{"text":"This place is an unhealthy rat hole that uses full fat ingredients. The owners are pigs and I highly recommend avoiding this \"diner\"."}
{"text":"Pros:  green apple salad was great
            Chicken noodle soup and potato kale were good
            The bread you get with the soup was outstanding

Con:  Asked for their famous grilled cheese. The girl said they couldn't do it, as they ran out of ciabatta bread. I asked if they could use the bread that came with the soup.  No can do.  What?  You have bread, you have cheese, and you can't put it together?  Since the bread is amazing, you should really go out on a limb and put some cheese on it, another piece of bread, and grill it.

I mentioned to her that it was for my brother in Cleveland Clinic. Still couldn't do it."}
{"text":"Oh Souper Market! How I love thee!
I've been coming to the the Souper Market on Lorain @ W.25th for quite sometime and I can honestly say I've only had one soup that I didn't like. I always go for the soup specials because they change all the time! Whether it's a creamy mushroom bisque, the tomato ginger, the delicious mulligatawny or a chilled soup like their gazpacho....I'm in! 
This is my #1 lunch pick, year-round! 
The bread, that comes which each soup, is always fresh (and I somehow always get lucky and get my favorite part.... the end!)
And on a day that I'm really hungry I add a salad to my order and 99% of the time its the green apple salad that comes with, of course, green apple slices, blue cheese, red onion, caramelized pecans and a delicious balsamic vinaigrette!
If you haven't yet, Check it out!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm going to make an excellent senior citizen one day, because I love soup and trying soups around CLE. Souper Market has a pretty big selection, and also has salads, sandwiches and vegetarian options if you need them.

My vegetarian friend and I stopped by and did a soup and sandwich for lunch. I had the grilled cheese and the chicken paprikash soup. The grilled cheese had huge slices of delicious bread, but not a lot of cheese or flavor (I know, huge side face). The chicken paprikash, however, had such an awesome flavor. It was hearty, rich and I can totally understand why its a customer favorite. It tasted like something my grandmother would have made! Next time, I'll skip the sandwich and just get soup.

Souper Market is located on Lorain Avenue. If you hit it before noon or after 1pm, you can almost immediately find a meter right outside on non-West Side Market Day. Its also very affordable, so give it a try, my fellow soup loving friends!"}
{"text":"Souper good.  Its the same as the other locations except a new owner has taken this location.  Easier to get to than the other locations by far.  Parking sports all over.  Daily specials and the usual favorites depending on what season we talkin' about.  Great lunch stop off.  Has a few window seats and tables.  Bring your work peeps and get your soup on!  Cold or hot, get your ass down here..."}

{"text":"I love this place so much, I wish it was open on Sunday. My best friend was over last weekend and we decided to get some Souper Market (she had never had it) and she flipped out. Her review is around here somewhere. 
She had the most amazing salad and fresh balsamic dressing and the Potato Spinach and Swiss soup. She said when she visits next we are definitely getting Souper Market. 
I always get either the Mushroom or the Chicken Paprikash soup. So good. 
Also, they have incredible crusty bread which, I luckily found out, you can get a whole loaf, baked or unbaked (raw?) for only $4. It's so good. You will not be disappointed! 
Also, the location downtown is very nice and the guys are super friendly."}
{"text":"Nice place that usually has 10 or so soups to choose from. I typically get the Jambalaya unless one of the weekly specials strikes my interest.  Today I had Indian Beef Stew.- cubed beef, carrots,  potatoes,  onion etc... in a broth season with curry and cumin.  Comes with a nice sized piece  or sourdough  bread."}
{"text":"Tried the jambalaya, curry cauliflower chick-pea and chicken and dumplings. All were excellent."}
{"text":"Admittedly, this restaurant is located on the (kind of deserted) stretch of Carnegie Ave between the Cleveland Clinic and Asiatown.  And, it is called Souper Market.  So for the longest time, I thought it was a soup kitchen.

That being said, this place has some darn good soups.  My favorites are the clam chowder and the mushroom barley soups.  I also like the green apple salad.

Call me weird, but one thing that really stands out to me is the fact that the bread they give you sucks up the soup likes a sponge.  At other places with soups, you need to squish the bread around in the soup to let it soak up the liquid.  Here, you drop your bread in one of their soups and in a fraction of a second you have a fully flavored, warm, delicious piece of bread.  As an avid bread-dipper, that was enough to win me over.

They don't really have anything other than soups and salads.  So if you come here, expect to make a meal out of soups, salads and bread."}
{"text":"I have stop in here on many occasions for lunch. The have excellent salads and soups. I usually get the Caesar Salad and I could eat it everyday.

They have locations all over the city and they really quick inside."}
{"text":"Much better and friendlier. Guy behind the counter was super friendly and helpful. I got to try a few samples and came home with a couple quarts. Chicken noodle and a mushroom. Both very tasty. 

I also tried the Muluhgtany. Really good and I'll be back for that another time. 

Cheers to the people that run this place. It's convenient on the way home as long as there's parking."}

When you're charging six bucks for a bowl of soup to go, it should taste like something.  And mushrooms in paprikash... and mushrooms in broccoli cheese?  If you're thinking of going here, save a few bucks and buy a can of progresso next door at Marc's."}
{"text":"Two words for Souper Market - HELL YES.

Souper Market is a plain and unassuming spot located in the middle of the lakewood strip mall on Detroit. (for easy reference, it's about 100 ft away from Melt) You could drive by it 100 times without taking the time to see the place or give it a try.

Trust me: it's worth the time. You'll stop back time and again for the delicious, savory, and filling soup this gem has to offer.

I keep attempting to try new dishes at SM....and after many long internal conflicts I come back to the paprikash (mouth is watering just thinking of it) and the jumbalya.

The jumbalya features large chunks of chorizo and grilled chicken in a thick tomato base. It has a small kick to it, and the crusty french bread they give you for dipping makes even a small dose feel like a full meal. The blend of flavors in each bowl is a like a massage for the taste buds; every bite will have your eyes rolling back, digging in with fervor to continue the orgasmic mouth onslaught.

Pant, pant, pant.

The Chicken corn chowder has also been very tasty, and Potato Leek soup was hearty and delicious on a cold winter day. The roasted red pepper special was had a zesty bite that I wouldn't have expected, and I have no idea how to create myself.  I've sampled everything they've thrown my way, and never been found wanting on any dish.

Please give these guys some of your time, they will be sure to delight."}
{"text":"The Souper Market never lets me down. They have the best chicken noodle soup. It's perfect for a rainy day or if I'm feeling under the weather. If I'm in a meat-free mood, I go for one of their vegetarian or vegan options. Unlike some places that just slap a slice of soggy eggplant on a plate and call it a \"vegetarian entree,\" The Souper Market whips up some delicious veg options. 

Souper Market salads are near perfection too. My favorite is the green apple salad. 

I do wish they had some better seating. It's pretty cramped in there, which gives me a rushed feeling."}
{"text":"This soup joint never fails to disappoint me. For consistent, fresh, and quality food this place is a must for me several times a month. Savory pulled chicken stars in their traditional chicken noodle soup and the cream of mushroom soup is out of this world! Souper Market is known for their vegan and vegetarian soups as well, and many of those are a welcome change from your every day run of the mill soup.  I enjoy their ever rotating specials- the roasted red pepper and strawberry bisque are two of my favorite seasonal specials . Souper Market salads are generously portioned (sometimes I save half the next day) and customizable to your liking. Don't care for soup or salad? Try the chicken wings confit- spicy, juicy wings that will only set you back around 5 bucks for 6 of them.  

The music is always upbeat, staff is friendly and patient. There is usually a wait between 11:30-noon (lunch rush), and yes I have stood in line for well over half and hour, but that wait is well worth it. Parking isn't the best, but its midtown/downtown Cleveland. Be careful getting in and out of the cramped lot.   Prices have risen a bit, but in line with most soup establishments (4.00 or so for an 8 oz of soup) but anything to support local business.  Keep rockin' on!"}
{"text":"This is the best soup joint that has ever existed in the entire world. The dude who owns it is also very good at guitar. Broc ched 4 lyfe."}
{"text":"Downgrade?

Yes.

Not because I don't love the food, I've officially become a regular here. But because, depending on who is staffing the restaurant in any given day, you may experience a cold interaction or a pleasant one. Unfortunately, there's no way of knowing until you walk in the door whether the people working are the ones who drop a fistful of dusty plasticware into your bag, make the food wrong, give you only half a full container of soup, and coldly shove the food at you like it's the only prison meal you get that day. 

Shit. Too bad I'm addicted to the stuff."}
{"text":"Love every soup I've tried, and I've tried many over the last few years. Staff is always friendly. Crusty bread perfectly compliments every bowl."}
{"text":"Souper Market's Carnegie location is a welcome addition to the sparse lunch options in midtown. Ample parking is available in the attached lot. We stopped here on a recent weekday around 1pm and they were medium-busy so we waited about 10 minutes to order. Seating is good for this quick lunch style place - one long counter lining the walls and front windows. 

I chose the Green Apple Salad with the small size of potato spinach soup (6oz I believe) and Sean got the Jambalaya. The salad was outstanding. Extremely fresh and generous portions of all toppings with perfect dressing. If you like the Apple/pecan/gorgo cheese type salad, get this here. It is my favorite type of salad and theirs is one of the best I've had. 

The soups were pretty good. The potato soup had decent flavor which isn't always the case so I appreciated that. It was pureéd rather than chunky which I would have liked more, but that's just personal preference so can't fault the place for that. Jambalaya was tasty and pretty spicy as you'd expect. 

Each soup comes with a huge chunk of freshly made bread. It's good but personally I like more of a baguette style bread as opposed to this which is more of a farmhouse style. Again personal preference there and the bread is very good quality and works well for soaking up the last bits of your soup. 

In addition to the couple of picky things above and the somewhat slower service, this place is COLD in winter and not just because of the frequent door openings with the in and out traffic. The counter is right next to basically full length windows so it was much too cold for my liking. 

Will definitely be back to get that awesome salad and to try other soups, but until it gets warmer outside, I'll be taking my order to go."}
{"text":"I love soup, and this place is great!  I got the seafood primavera to go recently, and enjoyed my lunch in Lakewood Park.  The employees were friendly and helpful with suggestions, and I felt like I got a great deal for what I paid.  The flavors were perfect, and everything tasted fresh.  

Parking is a trick, make sure you park at a meter (on the street, or in the Mark's parking lot).  Some of the parking attendants are quite vigilant in the lot directly behind the store."}
{"text":"Love  the soup, don't love the service. 

I've been to the  Lakewood location of the Souper Market many times. The food is always delicious, and that thick, crusty bread... I could make a meal out of that bread all by itself. The soups are always super tasty, flavorful, and full of goodness. I crave the mulligatawny. 

But every time I go in, I feel like I'm being judged by the staff. Nobody smiles, and I like to think I'm pretty friendly. And lord help me if I ask for a salad, I get an additional side of eye roll. I really enjoy Souper Market though, so instead of eating in, I'll always get takeout."}
{"text":"Souper Market is absolutely one of my favorite places. I started frequenting this location when I got a job in midtown. There aren't many good, healthy places to go if I need to grab something for lunch or early dinner nearby work. 
They don't tell you- but you can ask for samples. I usually try something different every time I go, just so I can taste all the delicious soups they serve!
Their Chorizo clam chowder is out of this world. A little spicy, and such a unique flavor combo.
The Chicken Paprikash soup is also very tasty, rich, and heavy- good for a winter day when you're really hungry! 
Those are my faves, but everything I've had there is \"souper\" delish!
I've only ever had one salad there, and it was very good- fresh, delicious, interesting flavor combo, etc., but I found it expensive, and I usually stick to the soup and bread.
Support Souper Market- a great local establishment! :)"}
{"text":"This place was really good! I had the jambalaya its spicy but really dank,I will be going back! Next time I'm trying there chicken Paprikas. The people that work there were helpful nice establishment. If I was you I would check it out!"}
{"text":"I've been eating Souper Market soups for years and recently visited their flagship location downtown. Their soup is very good and very filling for a somewhat fair price. They usually have a great variety of soups available and the staff is very helpful and friendly. You can find their soups at the West Side Market, Heinen's, various specialty supermarkets around the Northeast Ohio area, and of course at their Lorain Ave location. 

My 3-star rating is because:

*They are a bit on the expensive side for soups. Especially as more and more grocery stores are offering their own fresh made soups for much better prices that are on par, taste wise with Souper Market.

*Their locations seem to change often so I'm never really sure where to find them.

Bottom line? I don't automatically think of Souper Market when thinking of soups."}
{"text":"I lovvvvvvvve the souper market. They try there best to use everything local or non gmo. My only complaint is the one on Lorain is always sold out of their amazing grilled cheese. Stock more grilled cheese!!!!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to this particular location, but I have regularly dined at their original location off west 25th street.  All of their soups and salads are scratch made everyday, the lobster bisque is to die for!  Their bread and dressings are amazing!  Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"Ate here during a trip to the Cleveland Clinic. So good and great feel good healthy fare! The problem was deciding which soup to try first!!"}
{"text":"I used to love this Souper Market spot, but since my company moved I started going to the one on Carnegie which is fabulous.  I stopped in a few times recently to this location on Lorain since my company moved to Tremont.  The first soup I ordered wasn't heated up properly.  The second time I stopped in the line was long, out the door and partly down the street, and there was one person working the counter.  I left.  Today I stopped in again and ordered a mixed greens salad except the only greens they had was romaine, nothing green and leafy about my salad.  I'm sure they ran out of greens or something but third times the charm, I wont be returning.  I'll drive to the Carnegie location, the people are nice and food is always fabulous, they really care about what they put out there."}
{"text":"I'm totally obsessed with the Tomato Ginger soup. Just a warning to anyone who is looking to get that soup, it is pretty spicy in a spicy ginger way but extremely delicious! I also usually get the grilled cheese which is pretty par for the course as far as grilled cheese goes. This place keeps me coming back! Check em out!"}
{"text":"When sweater weather rolls around, man, do my tastebuds crave some warm, soupy goodness from Souper Market!

If you're not familiar with this fine establishment, Souper Market is a thriving souphouse on Lorain Avenue in Ohio City.  Their tantalizing soups, salads, and stocks have made the locals very, very happy since 2002.

I have never had a soup here I didn't like.  My favorite is ther Tomato Ginger (SO good), closely followed by their spicy Jambalaya.  I've tried most everything on their soup menu at one point or another, and they have all been excellent - the perfect answer to the September chill, and I swear their Pulled Chicken Noodle soup brought me back from the brink of death a couple of winters ago.  

The salads are fresh and tasty, with a wide selection of dressings (mostly vinaigrettes) which are made on site from scratch.  The Sweet Lemon is my fave.  They also have a few other non-soup selections, such as crab cakes, potato pancakes, and pierogies; though I haven't tried this side of the menu yet, I'm sure they are delicious, considering the source.

You can also buy stocks (their vegetable stock is even 100% vegan!), with which you can make your own delectable soups and sauces.  YUM!

So if you're looking for a healthy, all-natural, warm-you-up-feel-good meal, Souper Market is the place to go on your lunch break from work or on your way home.  The prices are decent, you get bread with each soup order, and there is no one there even remotely resembling the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld.  

They also have a new location in Lakewood, so check them out!"}
{"text":"Love Souper Market!!! and thrilled to have one close to home in Westpark. The soups are all made from scratch and delicious, you can taste to your heart's content before buying and the huge slice of rustic bread makes for a hearty and delicious meal. Love the salads too!!  God bless the Souper Market!!!"}

{"text":"My dad first introduced me to this place and have been going here since I was maybe about 12. The food is always on point. I always get the Caesar salad which is delicious but any kind of soup you get is guaranteed amazing ! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing! I love the tomato ginger when I'm sick and their Caesar is incredible. I don't bother with the side of bread, just too much crust for me. Try to go at weird times to avoid the lunch rush (like 1pm instead of noon etc). I've never had a soup I didn't like, they'll let you taste them before buying, and lots of clearly labeled vegan items!"}
{"text":"This is the spot. 
I love love love Souper Market! 
I was looking for a place that makes great salads and this IS the spot. I come here multiple times a week because I love it so much. Better soup and salad than most of the restaurants in this area. Maybe even all. 
The green apple salad is amazing. Add chicken and you are in heaven. The chicken added to the salads is generous and flavorful. It's pulled chicken so it mixes in really well. 
The Greek salad is also awesome. 
The dressings are homemade and delish. 
But you gotta go for a combo here because the salads are good but super perfect with a side of soup! 
The chicken noodle is a super solid choice- not your boring nasty chicken noodle! Brings shame to even some of the nice restaurants around.. The broth is satisfying and the chicken is yummy. Perfect noodle to chicken to broth ratio.
The chicken florentine was amazing but it was a special (sadness). Hope it comes back. 
This evening my grandma really wanted grilled cheese. She rarely asks for anything special but this was a special request for her.. So I got her the grilled cheese from Souper Market. She was soooo happy with it. She said you didn't have to go so out of your way! There is lots of goodness in here! 
Perfect score to make her night. 
I've never had a bad experience here. Parking is easy (hooray!!) and this is THE go to spot for me in Lakewood to grab a quick dinner, lunch, a soup stash, or even to grab the perfect grilled cheese sandwich ;) my obsession continues."}
{"text":"One of my favorite things to cook is soup.  I would probably cook soup every day if I could.  Sometimes, I wish I worked here.

When I don't make my own soup, I love going to the Souper Market.  They have some of the best soups that you can buy.  I've had several, and all have been excellent.  There is a large variety on any given day including hot and cold options.   I distinctly remember having a cold raspberry bisque and just about losing control of my bodily functions due to the liquid delight in my stomach...okay, that sounds really weird, but whatever.

Soups are served with a giant piece of artisan bread.  I'm not exaggerating; it's like a brick.

There are also salad and sandwich options, which I haven't explored yet, but they look great!

The Souper Market also sells stock, which I haven't tried yet, but I am going to soon.  I'd rather buy their homemade stock then another can of Swanson's.  I'll update the review when I've tried it.

It's cold in Cleveland, and soup is the perfect companion to the weather.  The Souper Market does it right."}
{"text":"I tried the Souper Market on Carnegie for the first time today. I work in the area and a few of my coworkers frequent this lunch spot so I figured I would give it a try. 

The parking was a pain - the lot was very small (but free!) but after creeping around for a few minutes I was able to park. The line was almost out the door, but I took that as a good sign. 

The line moved quickly and I ordered a seasonal salad (added chicken) and 8oz of the wild mushroom soup. There isn't really any place to sit an eat aside from a few barstools and a skinny countertop, so I went back to my office to dig in. 

The soup was delicious and creamy and came with a huge hunk of warm fresh bread for dipping. The salad was also really good, I loved the lemon dressing they make in-house?.

I was really full after lunch so next time I'll probably get just a salad or a bigger portion of the soup, but I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Solid every time. Options here include Soup, salad and grilled cheeses. The salads are huge. Many different soup flavors and you can get a combo of soup and salad. I love soup so I really appreciate this place.

Very casual theme. Good for a quick bite but I prefer to take out and enjoy at home."}
{"text":"The asparagus salad is life!!! I could eat here every day. It's affordable, the staff is cool and always willing to give an honest recommendation. Everything is so authentic and has that real \"home made\" taste. I also have to note that if you are interested in a special someone and they are sick, bring them some soup from Souper Market and I guarantee, you'll get out of the friend zone."}
{"text":"Love the soups and salads ... I eat a lot and it was more than I could eat in one sitting. Gonna try a grilled cheese today)"}
{"text":"This place is great.  First and foremost they rule when it come to soup.  I eat soup all year round.  However today I decided for something different.

This is a must try - Asparagus Salad with a vinegrette to die for!!!!!!!!  Also look out and try their fruit salad.  A huge container full of large chunks of fruit!"}
{"text":"Souper Market soups are now available at By Nature on Coventry!  No bread yet, but they said that was coming soon.  I had the chicken soup, pumpkin soup, chicken paprikash, and corn chowder.  All delicious!"}
{"text":"I love the monthly salads. So good every time. Right now the salad has chick peas and carrots and celery and this delish creamy garlic dressing."}
{"text":"I've always felt bad about the fact that I never really consider soup to be a meal.  I think it mostly has to do with my love of sandwiches, and my previous inexperience with truly awesome soups. 

Enter, the Souper Market.

It's a tiny place, a few counter seats to eat at, and I assume most of the business is done as carry out.   

It's a smallish menu, adjusted seasonally, made up of a selection of hot and cold soups, and a few salads.  

On this visit, I tried the Jambalaya, for which hearty is an understatement.   I felt like I was eating a delicious bowl of pulled chicken.  

Also tried was the roasted corn gazpacho was tangy, and had some
spicy kick to it. 

The real surprise was the Strawberry bisque.  Maybe it's a melted milkshake, or smoothie, but whatever it is , it's delicious.  I was tempted to try the spiced banana cold soup, but it wasn't in the cards today.  

All soup is served with a big slice of crusty artisan bread, and the prices are pretty reasonable. I'll be going back.  Soon!"}
{"text":"We went to The Souper Market for lunch yesterday.  I ordered the vegetable barley soup and a market greens salad and he ordered the clam and chorizo soup and a grilled cheese sandwich. The order sounds simple, but the food is absolutely phenomenal. The soup was delicious. It contained lots of fresh vegetables and was full of flavor. The salad had fresh romaine lettuce, grated parmesan cheese, olives and tomatoes. The balsamic vinaigrette dressing was the best I have ever had. The grilled cheese sandwich was a work of art. It was perfect.  It was made with different cheeses and the best bread. It was cooked to perfection and was not buttery and greasy.  The food was great and the employees were very friendly. I am definitely going to go back. I can't wait to try a different soup!"}
{"text":"Last Thursday, I was working from home, bored and staring out the window up at the grey skies. Summer was officially over and the cold winds blew. I had an idea to get soup. I called my mom and asked if she wanted some. She was blown away because she said she was just about to call me and ask if I wanted some soup from Souper Market! She believes in psychic energy and thinks we had some sort of communication in our minds. It could be that. It could be that I am half of my mom and we kind of share a brain/consciousness. I guess when people reproduce, it is like cutting a piece off a worm."}
{"text":"I just stopped in for a bite and got the small Jambayla. It was good, but needed a little more texture and maybe some rice. The bread was top notch and I liked their options of soups. I will be back to try again soon."}
{"text":"Had a 45 min lunch break. My navigation directed me to this location. Which I am so glad they did because the food was amazing. Music was jamming, they were playing Janet Jackson! And customer service was great too. I got the chicken paprikash soup and the green apple salad. The soup was phenomenal and perfect for a rainy day. Shredded chicken, dumpling, and a red sauce with a zing! The salad was a good size with thinly sliced green apples, grape tomatoes, red onions, feta cheese, and an amazing thick vinegarette. I was honestly so impressed. From the portions, to the taste, to the environment. I left fulfilled and ready for work again! Thanks!! Not huge seating, but enough for a lunch break."}
{"text":"The soup was flavorful and hot!! The service was very friendly and speedy. I like the atmosphere because you get the chance to communicate friends."}
{"text":"Service has always been great for me. And the soup and salads are all amazing! Especially love the chicken paprikash."}
{"text":"Hit the spot! Cute little shop on Detroit and Warren with great salads and even better soup. I visited for the first time today and they were generous with the samples before I ordered the Crab and Garlic bisque. Perfect blend of flavors, tasted like fresh seafood with a sweet hint of roasted garlic. It was really rich but very good with the asparagus salad that I ordered alongside it. The salad was huge with romaine lettuce, asparagus spears, kalamata olives, hard boiled egg, and enough shavings of parmesan cheese to go with every bite. Definitely coming back to try the other soups!"}
{"text":"Amazing soup! I got the chicken paprikash soup and it was absolutely delicious!! They served it with a huge chunk of fresh bread  for dipping! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Convenient street parking if you can be lucky enough to get a spot...I had luck on my side when I stopped for lunch yesterday.

I picked up some Pulled Chicken Noodle for my guy and Chicken Paprikash for myself. Both were AAAAAAAMAZING! And the bread that they give you to go with the soup is just perfect. 

Staff is very friendly too...Always a good experience when I go to Souper Market!"}
{"text":"How did it take me so long to come to this place?! 
Came on a blustery November night for some warm soup. I was totally not disappointed. 
I had the roasted red pepper soup which tastes so rich and creamy and warm. Exactly what I was looking for. D had the Greek salad and a chicken noodle soup. His choices were on point as well. The prices are fair - similar to other chain restaurants with similar fare. I will absolutely be back here and this will likely become part of the usual dinner rotation. Yum!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate lunch here a few weeks ago after going to the West Side Market.
Awesome!  The creamy mushroom soup was 
fannnnn -- tasssss -- ticccc.
My wife had a salad and soup and said it was excellent.
And they give you this great bread to eat with the soup.
Prices are very fair.  Location can't be beat. Put 50 cents in the meter
and go have some soup!  MMMMMMM....YUMMMMMM.

BTW, I do believe that Bethany (review below) is a bit of a hoity toit.
Who comes to a Yelp page with all great reviews and posts a 1-star review?   
Sheesh."}
{"text":"green apple salad with creamy balsemic dressing is excellent! Very fresh and generous portions! Very friendly, attentive staff, very helpful with suggestions and free samples. Whats not to love?"}
{"text":"Souper FRESH, Souper TASTY, and Souper HELPFUL with out-of-the box orders. Would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"The soup here is great quality but as others mentioned, it's very expensive when you look at the cost per ounce. I would guess this is probably because their soups are made from scratch and use high quality ingredients, but I do think it is a deterrent from keeping me coming back more often... That and the way this location is set up to be a take out spot. I do think that is convenient but I wish they at least had the option to have your soup in a bowl to cut down on plastic waste. All in all, the soup is good here though and the staff has always been friendly. I would recommend to any soup lovers out there! I also love their crispy and fluffy sourdough bread although I wasn't impressed with their salads."}
