{"text":"Best Greek food in North York, Nick is the real deal, and Maria is one of the best servers in town. Make sure to get Chicken Souvlaki and their calamari, plus lots and lots of tzaziki. Always delicious, always consistent."}
{"text":"We ordered a platter for two and the portion was surely pretty generous. My favourite was their lamb kebab and the moussaka. The restaurant is a little small, but it has done its job well to create a homey atmosphere. We'll come back when we are around the area and craving for Greek food."}
{"text":"I went here with my bf to get our greek food fix. The service was quick and great but I found the dinner menu to be a little pricey when looking at the portion sizes. I got the souvlaki dinner plate and was a little disappointed that they totally loaded my plate up with a ton of salad and potatoes and very little meat. Kind of ruined our first impression of the place (although we love to support local restaurants in our area). Might give it another try in the future but can't say it's my first choice."}
{"text":"When I first saw this restaurant I laughed at its name, \"Greece\" Restaurant. I looked at the menu pasted on their window. They had a variety of things on their menu at an inexpensive price, so I gave this place a shot.

The restaurant is small, cozy and clean. The service was great, the food was okay, nothing too great (I had lamb souvlaki) and inexpensive.  Don't expect generous portions though. 

They had a few things on their dessert menu, but only had baklava that day. The baklava was okay too, I've had better, and the Greek coffee was nice!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times.  Food is alway great, service is always friendly. Nick the owner really cares about his restaurant and the people who dine here. Also, check out all those maps on the walls and brush up on your Greek history!"}
{"text":"This is my favourite greek restaurant in the city! Honestly better than anything on the Danforth. It's not fancy but the food is delicious. I love the Greek salad and the Lamb Souvlaki.....super tender and flavourful!"}
{"text":"It spells Greece, and its as welcoming as the warm country in the Mediterranean Sea. Small menu and big big flavours, no need for more dramas or...tragedies.

This small family restaurant makes the juiciest meat I have tested so far in a Greek place in TO. No need to drive down to other places for a good grill, Mt Pleasant Rd. is full of surprises. I find the food at Greece simple and satisfying, cooked from the heart. Very good value, and efficiently served. When I take a break from cooking I come here for my urge of BBQ. Lucky to find a seat every time.

Definitely a bright star of my 5-Stars Club."}
{"text":"Expensive and below average. 

I have honestly had better Greek food at the food court. Really disappointing."}
{"text":"The food is ok and fits the bill. It's a notch up from Jimmy the Greek, has a mom and pop feel, but I much prefer the Greek restaurants in the Danforth.  It's good for the locals that live in the Mount Pleasant area, but not worth the drive in my opinion."}
{"text":"Overly priced, & rude service. When they charged my friend twice and we questioned it nicely, it led to a 20 minute disagreement! Showing receipts for proof,we were then thrown the extra $10 over the counter and told we should of just ate and left. Average food but definitely not returning after that !"}
{"text":"I was craving Greek food this evening and discovered Greece restaurant via online search.  

The place is casual. Small and dated looking with some paintings of Greece on the wall.

The menu is basic, and perfect for my needs this evening. I don't think I saw any grilled octopus, but I could be wrong...

The service was prompt.  We were there pretty early, like 6 pm. It began to fill up as we were leaving. 

I had: 
Tripple dip appetizer platter. I was craving taramasalata. This did not disappoint!  The pita was warm and fresh. Portion was perfect for 2 to share. A third could probably also have gotten in on it.

Chicken souvlaki stick - good size portion. Tender meet. Slightly bland. 

Large village salad - This was good, but the tomatoes could have bee fresher. Maybe vine tomatoes would have tasted better.

My friend had the pork souvlaki dinner - meat, salad, potatoes, rice, $16 or $17 I think. 

Total - $60 (tip included) 

All in all I was very satisfied when I left Greece restaurant. i'm happy to have found it, and I will return."}
{"text":"This restaurant is exactly what it is supposed to be.

If you are looking for a small, friendly, authentic Greek restaurant for a casual meal, made from scratch, in the Yonge and Eglinton area, then you will not be disappointed.

The owner Nick is a really nice guy, and he prepares all of the ingredients with care.

It is certainly not fancy, but it's like being at the Friendly Greek, but without the attitude -haha

Try this place out if you live in our area, and let me know how you like it.

Cheers!

{"text":"A lovely little \"mom and pop\" greek restaurant. Everything is made from scratch, and it shows. My favourite has to the app plater, with humus, tzatziki, and taramasalata. Little bit of this, little bit of that. The service is warm and friendly, and they went out of their way to make sure my Grandma was comfy."}
{"text":"This place deserves more respect than it gets. Been there at least half a dozen times and have not had a bad meal. 

We've had a number of different things (lamb chops, souvlaki plates, etc.) but I always go back to the same thing, the platter for two. $43 gets you three souvlaki sticks -- chicken, pork and lamb, a good chunk of mousaka and salad, rice and potatoes for two. It's a good meal for two hungry eaters. For a couple or for a father with 14-yr old son, there would be a bit of leftovers, maybe enough for one lucky person's lunch the following day.

Lamb was a bit on the fatty side, but still tasted really good. Pork and chicken were tasty and tender, really could not have been better. I love the rice and potatoes, consistently awesome every time.

Service is fast but the waitress is not the type to smile and chat you up to get a bigger tip, like you get at chain restos. She's all business, and on to the next table's needs. Some customers might take that the wrong way, and sure she does come across as a bit \"surly\" at times. For me, she does all the essentials well (drinks, order, food, bill, thanks & g'nite) and I don't need the extra fluff. And the food's plenty good. I'm never disappointed when I go to Greece, and for sure I'll be going back."}
{"text":"VIBE 
This was an impromptu surprise when I find out that Penrose fish and chips was closed at 7 pm (oh, the joys of being on Mount Pleasant!)

I think this is the only other restaurant that doesn't look fancy nor do you have to pay over $16 for an entree (yes, I'm looking at you Simple Bistro). 

Decor is non-descript -there are a few pictures of Greece in the wall. Why is this so typical of Greek restaurants in Toronto?!

Another thing typical of Greeks: The staff are stubborn. From my experienced in the actual country, this is spot on.

A play by play of my conversation with the waitress: 

\"I'd like the sauce on the side. \"you no want it on top?\" \"no the side.\" \"ok I put it on top.\" Ummmm...even when they're wrong and you're literally showing them they're wrong, they think they're right! (cough cough economic crisis COUGH). I had to tell the waitress twice that I didn't want the dinner, I wanted the a la carte. Sigh...
In a weird way, though, she was charming and sweet. 

I ATE 
I had a souvlaki \"stick\" which was about 5 good hunks of chicken souvlaki for about $5.50 For two sticks at Mr. Greek's on the Danforth you can get it for about $4. The rice actually came with no legitimate \"sauce.\" There was some lemon compote on top. Obviously, I could have made it at home and it was $5. Again, I didn't really have a choice. This was a last resort type of deal. When in Greece...on Mount Pleasant...

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
A good last resort restaurant if you find yourself on Mount Pleasant. One of the more reasonable, casual places on Mount Pleasant. If you want the authentic Greek experience, this is it!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is right on Mt Pleasant and is not accessible. There's one step at the entrance and you have to go down a flight of stairs to get to the bathroom. It's an old restaurant owned by what I assume is the original owners, an elderly man and woman. There's plenty of seating inside and the woman at the counter was nice and social, we had a nice conversation while I waited for her partner to prepare my food. I ordered a Gyro, which was really filling and tasted great. Check it out if you're in the area"}
{"text":"The food at Greece Restaurant is excellent.  Portions are big and the value for money is pretty great.  I ate the chicken souvlaki and it was really tasty.  I also shared a carafe of the Greek red wine on the menu.  The wine wasn't amazing, but again - good value for money."}
