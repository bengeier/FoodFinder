{"text":"After bragging to my family how great the food was here . We went there for dinner on Sunday 1/14/18 I was so excited for them to try it because they love los consuelos unfortunately it was the worst ever our service was terrible and after watching people who came after us eat and leave I questioned the waitress multiple times plus a gentleman that came to our table where our food was she blamed the kitchen and he said he would find out well he never came back out. We waited a total of 1 hour and 10 minutes with only chips and salsa not seeing if we needed anything else to drink so we left very very disappointed."}
{"text":"I want to love this place because we don't have many sit down restaurants around the neighborhood, but I'm running out of patience with this place. 

I have been to Wild Margaritas 3 times and the service just keeps getting worse. Seems like the more customers they have, the more dysfunctional it gets.  My family and I went to Wild Margaritas last night and the restaurant was freezing!!!  You know it's cold when most people in the restaurant were eating dinner with their scarves and gloves on. The only heat we felt was from the sizzling hot skillets of fajitas passing by. Besides the frigid temps in the restaurant, the service was miserable. We requested additional chips and salsa 4 times before we got refills.  Chips and salsa are the backbone of every great Mexican restaurant. Come on, guys!   If all else fails, keep the chips and salsa coming!  And the drinks and food took forever to come out.  Forget about getting refills on the drinks, because we barely saw our waiter all night. 

Most Mexican restaurants are fun, lively, and are known for their quick, great service.  There was none of that at Wild Margaritas.  The staff was stressed and the customers were shivering and annoyed.  Avon Lake is a small town where people talk and bad service can spread like wildfire.  I hope they get it together before they're consumed with poor reviews."}
{"text":"Awesome food, huge portions and great service. I ordered the chicken fajitas and there was enough food for three people!  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Update (5/15/18) - I figured I'd give the place a second chance so I went on 5/2/18 and it was closed with a sign saying they would reopen on 5/5 (Cinco de Mayo). So I went by for lunch today and now there's a sign saying their liquor license was suspended and closed until further notice. Now the owner also recently opened another location right up the road (Wild Margarita 2) which seems odd seeing that the first location has never been fully opened."}
{"text":"Good prices, huge and delicious magaritas and one of the best chimichangas I've ever had. 
And they dont skimp on chips.
I will be coming back"}
{"text":"Can't say enough about this place..  Food is exceptionally delicious, plates come sizzling to your table and if you have a hearty appetite you definitely won't be disappointed with the large portions given.   We had chicken and steak fajitas and I cannot state how delicious,  well seasoned and cooked to perfection!!   Excellent service from our waitress who waited on us attentively from the minute we were greeted at the door welcoming us!   Definitely will be going back for more delicious Mexican food, great service and reasonable prices!!   Salute and welcome to the neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"We really wanted to love this new Mexican joint after hearing it came to town. Instead we found it appeared to replace an old dive bar interior. When we were seated we were promptly given some average chips in a plastic basket. When our sever came over and we asked for a drink menu he pointed to a poster on the wall advertising three brands of bottled beer. My friend asked about margarita flavors and the server said they had basic margaritas, which was surprising considering their name and online photos all show an array of colorful different drinks and margs. So we say we need a moment and walk up to look at the drinks at the actual bar bar and what do we see but maybe 6 or so beers on tap and what looks like a normal bar. When we sit back down I ask for a XX lager since I saw it on the tap and ask for it in draft. He says he doesn't think it's on draft. My friend in the meantime ran into another employee who gave her a real drink menu to look at--on his iPhone. They appeared to have no actual drink menus in the place. She ordered a speciality marg and I ordered my beer, which arrived in a bottle. She said her drink tasted odd and she only drank perhaps 1/4. Allow me to back up for a moment to describe the scene. The entire place smelled of cleaning product and there was a PowerPoint presentation playing photos of drinks on the wall. Now back to the order. We ordered some meals and when they came we had several issues. One, the beans tasted strange in flavor so we didn't eat them. The chicken was OK in our items but not good. The beef was insanely oniony and we didn't eat any of it. The steak in my friend's taco was the only good thing, but it was pretty medium rare, so for those who want it cooked more it might not work. Between the bad food, missing drink menus, dozens of children running around and crawling all over the place, I don't think we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Margaritas are purely mix with no alcohol on the special nights. Premade poured from a pitcher. Food is ok but if you try to call in for take out or delivery half the items in the menu are not available. Super disappointing. Not many margaritas to choose from which contradicts the name."}
{"text":"We tried this for the first time tonight. Delicious Margaritas, fast service,and huge portions. The mariachi band was fabulous. My daughter loved it. We should have split the the chicken fajitas."}
{"text":"Gave one star, last time there, very limited menu. Almost tasted pre-made and reheated. They said it was due to the kitchen being remodeled. Could not actually show us a menu. Couple weeks later, closed with a public notice posted from the city. Looks like they may have lost their license. Too bad, when they first opened the doors was great."}
{"text":"I hate to leave a bad review because I really want to see New neighborhood restaurants succeed , but Bro.... You got to step your game up Wild Margaritas. You're not bringing it hard enough. The only thing wild was the crying women in the bathroom. I can't explain that.

But aside from Cleveland's finest clientele, the place didn't have a drink menu. Not even a margarita menu. For the love of tacos, how do you not have a margarita on the menu when you are called \"Wild Margaritas?\" 

As far as food, Please remove the pounds of onions from the beef. That's in excess of the daily onion intake required for a taco. And whatever cleaner you are using, please switch because the smell of cleaning product was intense . So intense, I swore I tasted fabuloso in my drink, and i just couldn't take more than a few sips. It continued to taste weirder as i kept drinking it. I thought I was being roofied by a ghost. 

You can turn this around, Wild Margaritas. Bring us that snazzy margarita menu. Switch the odd PowerPoint with a fun video of margarita making , or maybe a beautiful beach in Mexico , and don't use scotch tape to hang decor. 

I know this place is new, so I'm hoping in a few months, things will be up and running. But as a Latina just visiting the area for a week, i have to say this initial visit was disappointing. But I believe in second chances, unless you're Donald Trump. So I hope to return and see this place dramatically change."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try it, because the signs and decor haven't been fully updated, and I wasn't sure what I'd get. However, the food and service were excellent. The food is similar to what I have grown to love about Avon Lake Mexican food, but in a more open and fun environment. We are becoming regulars."}
