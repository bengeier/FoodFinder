{"text":"Man this place is bomb dot com -  Let me tell you when it comes to Mexican good I'm picky  there's so many spots here in vegas so when something really catches your taste buds then you know lol"}
{"text":"THE MOST AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD IN TOWN.  Do not sleep on this spot, if you are ever in Vegas definitely stop by... I cant think of my favorite dish because you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu; The menudo The cocteles, The enchiladas. Mm everything is bomb! and always great customer service and very clean nice little shop. Love it."}
{"text":"By far the best burrito and salsa I have ever had. This place is way across town from where I live but i go there just to get my burritos, yes if I'm gonna go across town I better get two burritos to go."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food very clean place & really good service I recommend this place 100% everything great"}
{"text":"Loved, Loved, Loved. It is a simple place, but you dont come to this place for the decor. You come for the damn good food.   Please note* I am just a customer. There is no dicount for posting nor any compensation for this rating."}
{"text":"I really love this place but after today I don't think I will order from here , I opened my box & my food was scattered everywhere . I didn't check my box originally since I've never had an issue picking up or my coworkers picking up food & the box didn't move at all . So disappointed , I always order from here ."}
{"text":"I was surprised it was this good it was like a home cooked meal... I purchased one posole, 3 carne asada tacos, 5 fried fish tacos, a combination of carnitas, 1 chicken nugget plate, 2 orchatas and my total was $51 not bad at all."}
{"text":"I walked in my scrubs and the owner asked me how I found out about his place.  I told him Yelp and that I was in the area for a school assignment and lived across town.  He never heard of Yelp and didnt know that his place has a 5 star rating.  He was wearing an SD cap and I found out he lived in San Diego.  If you ever had authentic San Diego Mexican food you know this place is legit, because it reminded me of that.  I found this to be a unique experience with genuinely nice restaurant owners not catering to Yelp reviewers.  Hopefully that won't change after my random stop there.  I had a carnitas burrito, cachete taco and carne asada taco, and a horchata (no not Smart Chata).  Overall the carne asada was the most flavorful with a nice charred taste.  The cachete was tasty.  My carnitas burrito was good too, similar to the SD burritos I miss.  Tortilla, meat, rice, beans, and since I'm originally from San Francisco I added some sour cream with guacamole.  The salsa was also fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Best Mexican restaurant in Vegas. Meat is super soft and very tasty. Fried fish is delicious. Salsa is so yummy! Very friendly service."}
{"text":"Seemed questionable from the outside especially only the outside thou when u walk in the atmosphere changes the cashier / sever name is Sarah she was really helpful I been here twice now I've tried the cabesa tacos, the lague  tacos, fish tacos, the shrimp cocktail  and the carnitas torta with fries all of it was outstanding I am surprised on how good it was they have a large variety of menu options which in sure there all good the cabesa was tender and juicy the torrilla they use was thin and delicious tasted home made fish taco was fresh it was fried still good thou love how fresh the tomatoes where , shrimp was perfect and Devined  correctly had a good amount of avacodo too which I loved , the carnitas were tasteful and not overcooked lettuce was fresh and crunchy over all I would say they put a lot of love in there food which makes it super good new spot for my Mexican food cravings I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Legit food!! I had the chilaquiles with red sauce comes with eggs,  beans and the best rice I've had in a long time.. Definitely recommend this spot. They know how it's done"}
{"text":"Family owned and always friendly...homemade salsa and different specials all the time! Overall just a great local neighborhood taco shop..."}
{"text":"Great place if you want some traditional fresh Mexican food ! The over ceviche which is one of my favorite dishes, to to be honest it's one of the best ones I had !"}
{"text":"I ordered carne asada, fish, & chicken tacos. Tacos are really small & over cooked. Was really disappointed, expected a lot based on the reviews I read. You're better off going to a taco truck. I really hate how over priced tacos are now. Wouldn't mind paying $2-3, but at least give me what I'm paying for."}
{"text":"Dont sleep on this spot! Consistently great, authentic mexican food. We've tried many other places but continue to return here!"}
{"text":"Outstanding. Visiting Las Vegas and happened upon this place. Having been raised in San Antonio, I feel like I know great Mexican food. And we found it here. The food is very authentic because they know how to build the meal with a great foundation. The chips and homemade tortillas are to die for. We all had various tacos, chicken and asada. Their burritos are huge!  The best part of the meal was the carnitas nachos. Don't miss out on them. When I'm back in vegas again, a meal here will be on my itinerary."}
{"text":"Excellent food. After living in South Texas for the last year it was nice to get back to a place that knows how to make good carne asana. The burrito was enormous and full of flavor. Delicious homemade tortilla chips and a tasty assortment of salsas. The girl at the front was very welcoming and the service was very fast. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite Mexican food joint. I always stop in when I'm near by and take something to go for later. Everything I've tasted on the menu is delicious. Too hard to choose one favorite dish, but today I had the grilled chicken burrito with guacamole and it was bomb. Customer service is always great, very attentive and clean! Love this place."}
{"text":"Best fish tacos! I also like the Carne Asada fries. The first time I had a chicken chile verde burrito.  But once I tried the fish tacos, I was hooked! The other burritos are good, too. My husband loves the pickled/peppered veggies. He gets a bagful and eats them while we wait. Family owned and operated. Friendly, cheerful staff."}
{"text":"We are from out of town staying down the street. I wanted something that felt like I was at home. The food is really good. The cashier was so sweet and nice. She recommended the Chile rello, enchilada and taco plate, it also came with rice and beans. I got the enchilada plate (3) with rice and beans. They also carry the Mexican Coca-Cola and sangria Yum! It's pretty small but not bad. I can assume it gets busy during rush hour, but we came at night and it was nice, not alot people. Parking wasn't a problem. FYI you pay at the end"}
{"text":"I had the chicken street tacos and all the ingredients were super fresh, great quality, great flavor. The restaurant was clean and the service was quick and friendly! Hot carrots were perfect but the hot sauce could've been hotter. Overall super yum! Check them out if you're in the area :)"}
{"text":"I had the huevos rancheros and Chile rellenos and let me tell you! It was delicious full of flavor super authentic and reasonable price. I'm definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"First of all, I'd like to tell everyone that I'm a dog. My pet parents are the ones who ate here today but I'm the one with the Yelp account. This restaurant was recommended to me by Yelp via email. Anyway... My pet mom is going to help me write this review.  Tia Pueblo Taco Shop is located on Decatur and Lake Mead right behind Subway. It's a small mom and pop type of place. The selection is plentiful and we absolutely LOVED the food. My husband ordered the chili relleno combination (two chili rellenos, rice, tortillas, and beans) and I had the chili relleno, enchilada, and taco combination. Soooooo much delicious food! There was so much on my plate that I had to ask for a to go container to bring home my leftovers! The price of our meals plus two large soft drinks was very reasonable -- about $27. We highly recommend this place if you're in the neighborhood and will definitely go back to try other items on their menu! Shoutout to Tanya (cashier) and Pop (cook)!"}
{"text":"This is a gem waiting to be discovered.  The area is sketchy, but the food is excellent.  This is a family run business where mom's recipes are being served daily.  The restaurant is clean, the service is very friendly and food is served promptly.  They have daily menu's aside from their regular menu.  Be sure to take a look at that menu.  We tried their tacos de carnitas and they were delicious.  Their salsa is good too.  And finish it off with a paleta for desert!  In this day in age I find it very important to support small business.  And this family run business is certainly worth supporting."}
{"text":"Just loved everything. Beans are sublime, beef tacos were next level. Wonderful owners, reasonable price and fantastic food. I will go out of my way to eat here again!!!"}
{"text":"This is a small family owned restaurant with the beat home style authentic Mexican food. Their customer service makes you feel right at home when you walk in. Some dishes come with hand made tortillas too! Highly recommend their menudo!"}
{"text":"The carnitas sop√©s are the best! Carne Asada tacos are in second place...  I eat there at least twice a week, and it's fantastic every time!"}
{"text":"Is a very good restaurant love it carne asada burritos bomb chicken burritos bomb love it"}
{"text":"Have been eating here since they opened a few years ago. Great food and service. Very friendly and helpful. Carnitas are off the hook. Recommend this to anyone wanting good real Mexican food."}
{"text":"This is the real deal, for sure. Hubby was over-the-moon happy that we tried this little place as he is very finicky about certain types of Mexican food, especially tacos al pastor.  Those three tacos, filled with achiote-red and adobo marinated pork bites, topped with fresh chopped onion and cilantro, were so delicious and made him a bonafide fan of Mi Pueblo.  Ay, caramba!  It was good stuff.  We also pigged out on two combos, with the refried beans, queso, chips, and rice.  One being the chiles rellenos and the other (my new favorite) puercos verde.  Both meals were very satisfying, but that pork with the green sauce had crunchy, roasted pieces of pork, with a light, citrusy green pepper base. I really wasn't very hungry, but enjoyed the flavor adventure so much, I totally devoured that dish.  The lady at the counter is so sweet and so is the chef (owner?)--they both checked on us to make sure we were enjoying our meals. Now, again as others have pointed out, it's a small hole-in-the-wall--but don't let that stop you from dining in. There are a couple big screens so you can watch Telemundo or whatever happens to be on. There is a fresh salsa cart, where you can help yourself to the salsa rojo or pico de gallo.  Also, just want to mention that although it's not located in a \"high-end\" neighborhood shopping center, we were certainly glad we stopped in."}
{"text":"One of the few times I have given a business five stars. This restaurant has very good food everything on the menu is fresh and very very tasty. I've been to this restaurant probably 10 to 15 times and have never had a bad meal. Is the owner and staff of this restaurant are very nice and courteous and provide a good service and excellent food. I highly recommend this place for anything Mexican on their menu you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten yet but if it tastes half as good as it smells I'll be happy. The staff was super friendly thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"Really solid Mexican food, an especially good option for breakfast! Menu is fairly limited, salsa bar is small, the fresh red version is their best. Service is polite and food is made fresh, and I'm glad they're not cash only!  Huevos rancheros are a tasty morning option, with a really flavorful ranchero sauce and three eggs. Combo plate (taco, chile relleno, enchilada) allows you to try a lot, and comes with rice and beans: asada taco was decent, chile relleno was overbattered and underseasoned, but the chicken enchilada was great. Good sauce, will come back for the cheese version! Simple sides of rice and beans are well done."}
{"text":"Once again. The good was hot and fresh tasty, the customer  service  is friendly  and personal. This what to expect from a family owned restaurant.   The burritos  are very nice sized /over sized for your $$ the torta  is good also,  all the food is good sized portions"}
{"text":"MI Pueblo is the BEST TACO SHOP IN VEGAS. The owners are so sweet and kind. Their food is absolutely delicious. I have had every single meal available here, and I NEVER once had anything that was bland or stale. They Cook everything fresh, despite what others think. Even though I'm guessing those people have never seen the cooks in action. This place is 1 IN A MILLION! I've been going since they've opened in 2008. I have never regretted going there. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE AND THE OWNERS! It's such a shame when people check in on here to get free food and THEN POST NEGATIVE REVIEWS ABOUT THE FOOD THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO PAY FOR LOL.  YOU WONT FIND MANY CLOSE TO HOME, DOWN TO EARTH AND DELICIOUS PLACES LIKE THIS."}
{"text":"I stop by here on my way to ed fountain park when my son has soccer games.  I usually get tacos and tamales for the team and they love them more than pepes. Definitely a go to place for great Mexican food...cant wait to try other items."}
{"text":"The food wasn't terrible, in fact their tortilla chips are really good.  But for their prices I definitely do not think they should be ranked five out of five. I think a solid three out of five would be extremely fair. Good chicken tacos I did not like the carne  Asada at all. They do you smoothies that are pretty decent. But no way shape or form should be five out of five."}
{"text":"We wanted to eat dinner but didn't want to spend a lot of money, so we found this place after we took the helicopter tour near the airport. Good prices, friendly service and the food was pretty good. I ordered a carnitas burrito, chicken hard shell taco and a horchata."}
{"text":"If you like authentic and always fresh Mexican food this is the place. Good customer service, portions and presentation. The restaurant is also clean."}
{"text":"Talk about authentic Mexican food!! there i was in search of a new place to eat close to work. I was craving authentic tacos, as i reminisced on my favorite taco shop in san francisco.       First stop was Cardenas. It was closer to me but the lines were ridiculous and the environment chaotic. Needless to say, i left in search of greener pastures. Second stop, the las vegas chain Rigos tacos. The place gave me a creepy vibe plus their soda machine was not working. I'm all for hole in the wall places but this place was too much.      As I drove aimlessly i came across this place, Mi pueblo Taco shop. Boy was I pleasantly surprised!! my  long search of a mom & pop taco shop proved fruitful. The lady at the counter and the cook turned out to be husband and wife, and the owners. They were both extremely friendly  and the food was delicious!! they had weird pricing quirks but hopefully they figure it out. overall, 5 stars and will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food I have ever had. I had the pleasure of trying to finish one of the combo meals, which was delicious and could have fed about 2 people.  The salsa assortment was a bit meager, but what was offered was fresh and flavorful.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Very good food...price is decent. The service is great. Unfortunately is hidden away in the back of the shopping center. I'm a satisfied customer."}
{"text":"Real humble place, but don't let that fool you. It's like going to your Tia's hous for dinner.. They star you of with chips and a side of refried beans.. We had the Carne asada plate which came with rice and bean and a side of tortillas and a chile asado.. 2 tacos de lengua, 2 of  carnitas, and a sope de carnitas. We had some Champurrado... Everything was delicious.. If I had to complain about something was that the salsa wasn't hot enough... that's all. We'll    be coming back.."}
{"text":"Yes its definitely a five star hidden gem. A great pit stop on the way to Moab. Everything was fresh right down to the rice. A nice older couple seem to run the restaurant. The prices are fair, it's probably not not in the best part of N. Vegas but worth trying out, we'll be back."}
{"text":"I was a little skeptical of the location but once I walked in I could smell how good the food must be. The place is very clean and the service was great. The girl at the register was friendly and helpful. I ordered tacos. The fish taco was one of the best I've had. It wasn't all batter like most places. The pastor tacos were also very good. I especially liked the green salsa. Not spicy and full of flavor."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast burrito!  Visiting from Cali for a basketball tournament for my daughter. Hubby and I shared one but added guac, rice and beans to make our halves a little more filling. So bomb. The lady at the register was a sweetheart."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed it here. The cheese enchiladas and carnitas taco were really good. The staff is very friendly, always nice to see positive happy people. I will be back for sure! give this place a try, you will enjoy it."}
{"text":"Amazing, fresh and inexpensive! First time here and I love it."}
{"text":"I totally agree with Krissy K. I love Mexican food!!My hubby and kids are super picky when it comes to eating out, but this little hidden gem is the spot. The food is always nice and fresh. I love their menudo on the weekends with hand made tortillas; ohh man that's my favorite! My hubby loves every single dish from here we never have a problem because everything is authentic and super delicious. This food reminds me of my mothers kitchen. My kids love the fish tacos and carne asada fries. And the owners are always super nice and friendly, I like the fact that they care about their customers. This is the kind of place that the community needs to support so they can stick around for a long, long time. Thank you Mi Pueblo Taco for always cooking the best food and offering us quality food."}
{"text":"My daughter and I stopped in yesterday and truly enjoyed our meal. So much so we added an order to go. Just might have to give up my usual taco spot!!!! Food was great. My only critic no chips and salsa before the meal and only gives you a couple chips stuck in the great beans!!! Also might look into making up paper menus. Nothing to take home to read. The service impeccable. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Location is horrible, people were harassing  us for money on the way in, we had to leave. Scary location."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best. The husband and wife who own the place were so kind and working in the kitchen the entire time. I placed an order for pick up, but I couldn't resist the tamales and champurrado I saw when I arrived. Aside from the excellent service, the food was so delicious. I had pastor tacos, carne asada fries, red pork tamales, and champurrado. There was nothing not to love and it all cost 20 dollars total. I look forward to visiting more frequently now that I have tried it. This is the type of place that deserves local support."}
{"text":"Wonderful divey taco shop with awesome Mexican food. Highly recommend the tacos dorados, cheese enchiladas and chips with the salsa bar. The flavors are amazing! They must do most of their business as take out since it is so small, but the eating area is clean and nice. Don't be swayed by the strip mall. Definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"Wanted to eat some home cooked meals  so read the reviews and headed on down to Mi Pueblo Taco Shop. Well I ordered the steak and eggs with rice and beans, my wife ordered their chicken soup and OH EM GEE!!! The food is amazing! Great portions, loaded with flavor and worth every penny! I wanted to digest sitting there just to order some more but the plate that ordered left me stuffffeeeddddd! I feel I need to order a taco or flautas just to try some of their tacos since that's what the place is a \"Taco Shop\" but I am way to stuffed to order anything else, and don't be fooled because everything looks amazing! The service is great and prices and reasonable to the amount of food you get! Def will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Very good I recommend the fish tacos!!! And carne asada tacos! All with red salsa!! Bomb!!!"}
{"text":"I am giving this establishment 2 stars based on the good service. The food was a bit disappointing, as it tasted like it was made the night before. I wish it would have more flavor. I enjoyed my order (carne asada, chicken, and carnitas mini tacos) it was not the best tasting ones I've had. They did not sell tamales (like someone posted) no posole-they didn't make any today-Sunday.   Will I return? No. But the service was great. May the taste be ever in your flavor!"}
{"text":"We had originally planned on eating at the Sinaloa food truck across the street, but they had a really long line, so we decided to give Mi Pueblo Taco Shop a try. Walking inside I was greeted by a sweet young girl who also took my order and she was nice about going over the menu and what the specials included. Inside was clean and decorated nicer than I expected. There was also a good amount of customers eating inside which I took as a good sign.   I noticed they had different daily specials on the windows out front and they are totally worth checking out. I was here on a Friday and the special that day is 2 enchiladas, beans, rice and a drink all for $5.95 before tax. Great deal! The rice was lacking a bit on flavor and while the beans could have used more cheese, they did taste good and I liked the few tortilla chips on top of them. The enchiladas had a decent amount of cheese inside and the sauce tasted good. I'd for sure come back for this special again.  Al Pastor Taco ($1.75) - The tacos come meat, onion and cilantro. There's a salsa bar with veggies and containers. I grabbed some of the red and green sauce and favored the green. My taco was filled nicely and had great flavor.   Carne Asada Burrito ($5.99) - Here's where things got odd for me. Hubby and I intended to share this and he always prefers just meat, cheese and sour cream in his burritos. The girl who took our order said he couldn't have it that way and that the burrito had to have beans and rice inside. If the burritos aren't pre-made this shouldn't be a hard request at all. I saw a different girl putting meat on the grill and then put the burrito together, so I can't figure out why the burrito couldn't be customized to have the rice and beans left off. The burrito was a nice size for the price and did taste good, but it would have been better enjoyable if it could have been made the way preferred.   Great weekly deals and decent Mexican food. I'd come back."}
{"text":"This place is great! The food is amazing. Had a plate of chilaquiles and my wife had the machaca. The portions were generous and tasty. I highly recommend this place if you you in the area and want great Authentic Mexican Food!"}
{"text":"The area is really sketchy, but you know your food will taste better in the hood. They didn't have any of the famous tamales at the time, they said it was random when they made them. I settled for the al pastor tacos with guacamole.   Service: We showed up 15 minutes before closing and they didn't rush us to get out. The girl up front was really helpful for ordering and was really nice.  Al pastor w/guac: They were not overcooked and very juicy, with the right amount of fat and meat. Also came with a little bit of chips.  Pina: pineapple drink was really good. Not too sweet."}
{"text":"TLDR: Lunch Specials; salsa bar available; excellent service; subpar food; convenience charge for card payment  I was really craving excellent chips and salsa so I usually have a go-to spot for Mexican fare. Learning that they were closed, I found something in the area with excellent reviews and was happy to find this location with a Yelp check-in.  I skimmed the reviews and saw several 4/5 star reviews with a couple of 2 star reviews so I decided to give this place a shot.   Service was excellent and I was impressed with the politeness and grammar used in both English and Spanish upon walking in and ordering. It reflected that the business cares about the customer and how they are perceived when spoken to by the various clientele.   I immediately placed an order for the chips and beans and was happy to see breakfast items on a menu. My foodie friend ordered a pastor burrito and I ordered chilaquiles with green sauce. Unfortunately, this is where I should've listened to the 2-star reviews.   While I believe that the food is made fresh in-house, the quality lacks and pales in comparison to the service. The beans lacked flavor, excluding the cotija cheese and the chips were stale. This is probably a storage issue. The salsa were flavorful, but lacked spice. Interestingly enough, the green salsa was the spiciest.   My friends pastor burrito was just ok. Not fantastic, not terrible. Just ok. It probably is similar to Roberto's, my terrible baseline for Mexican food flavor and service. My chilaquiles were tragic. The rice was pretty bad and the green sauce was pretty boring. It's sad to say that Del Taco has better rice, beans, and green sauce. Needless to say, I didn't enjoy the dish and I won't return anytime soon."}
{"text":"Love this place! Owners are so nice!   I was craving tacos dorados which I don't think is on the menu ( my husband ordered in Spanish an I got lost in translation) the tortillas were light and freshly fried, meat was juicy and flavorful, really hit the spot   We also had cheese enchiladas with beans and rice and my husband and I loved it! He's kind of a bean snob, and he really liked their beans which is rare. He's from Mexico and when he says something tastes like his mom made it, it's a good sign we'll be back! We've been back twice now :)   Chicken sope is delish as well"}
{"text":"Great tacos de carne asada.  I really liked the salsa.  I added rice and bean and I am glad I did.  Delicious and very affordable."}
{"text":"They have tamarindo! My girlfriend and I have been looking for weeks and finally found our new go to spot!  Thanks!"}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp as I was nearby getting a cell phone fixed. The food was good the place was clean Juanita was very friendly.    I was almost back because I thought I was gonna have to pay for a drink refill but Juanita said no problem and make sure you check in to get the free bean dip was pretty dang good"}
{"text":"Was in town on a short layover and was looking for some real deal Mexican! This place was so good! The sopes were amazing!!!!!  Will definitely be back when in the area!"}
{"text":"Great customer service, very friendly and helpful. Real deal Mexican food. Al Pastor Burrito and California Burritos were the best I've had in Vegas. Tacos were great too. Give it a try, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Las Vegas does not have a lot of good Mexican food unfortunately. So, when we do find one, it's always pretty exciting. This place was good. Reminded me a little of Texas, in terms of quality.  Enchilada was very tasty, great sauce. Rice and beans were both delicious. Chile Relleno needed a tiny bit more flavor, but had plenty of cheese. Great little salsa bar. Had a bite of gf's Huevos Rancheros and we agreed that they were pretty awesome. We'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Always a long drive, but worth coming here for Carnitas burritos, Huevos Rancheros,  delicious salsa, perfect rice and beans on a Sunday. They are always nice and friendly. The service is not always fast, but worth the wait because they are busy."}
{"text":"Bomb! Fresh ingredients!  Yummy to my tummy!  I would highly recommend this gem. This meal hit the spot, next time I'll try the enchiladas....."}
{"text":"Had the ceviche tostada,  it was delicious  Asada tacos are really good too. Very friendly staff. Clean place."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! The strip mall this place is located in is a little scary looking, but this place is really nice on the inside. The burrito I had was amazing. People were very friendly and professional. Good job! 5 stars, well deserved!"}
{"text":"Simply Amazing... Stopped in for a light lunch. Walked out happy and satisfied. Thanks to my fellow yelpers advice and high ratings here I took the plunge of faith it wouldn't disappoint. Lunch specials provided M-F at very reasonable prices. Salsa bar provided with great service. Offers a full service atmosphere with restaurant style tables for dine in. I highly recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"I really liked the 'mom and pop' feel of this little Mexican restaurant, and the quality of the food was really good. Solid four stars. The complimentary chips and beans I got for my Yelp check-in were excellent. I upgraded to a larger size beans in order to share. You can tell these beans are the real thing.... slow cooked with love for the flavor and not smashed too much. Yum. My husband has the carne asada burrito, it was huge, their version came with rice and beans inside the burrito, a little different than other taco shops I have been to. I had the combination plate, Chicken Enchilada, Chiles Relleno, and Chicken Taco. This plate came with rice and beans. Everything was excellent, but the star of the show was the taco! My next visit I will definitely try some of the other tacos on the menu. The salsas in the salsa bar were amazing, I put it on everything!  So here is the bad news about this place........ the neighborhood! This shopping center and parking lot is scary! There are so many people loitering in front of the next door liquor store. I am glad I was with my husband, I really would not have felt safe coming here without him and coming here after dark......."}
{"text":"Very clean and friendly service. I had the Carne asada torta and my friend had tacos overall fairly good.  For a quick bite not bad."}
{"text":"The food is very tasty, generous portions.  Had the combo with cheese enchilada, Carne Asada taco and chili rellenol with rice and beans.  Hubs had the Carne Asada plate ."}
{"text":"I  would've like to take a before picture when it looked all nice and pretty, but it was so delicious I just couldn't wait. I had the chicken chimichanga and my friend had of the chicken burrito supreme. I will never visit Robertos, Pepe's tacos, etc. again. #obsessed"}
{"text":"So tasty and authentic. The food is very fresh. I love their chicken torta! Prices are reasonable and it doesn't take long to get your order."}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall place with pretty good Mexican food. I'm from southern California and can't find anything that compares to there, so when I need a fix I come here. It does the job."}
{"text":"Food is pretty decent. Not too expensive. Will def come back if I'm in the neighborhood"}
{"text":"Trying to curb my taco cravings, checked yelp for a taco spot not too far from the house, when I came across the review for Mi Pueblo Taco Shop and they have a perfect 5star rating. I haven't got my food yet, but the smell coming out the kitchen is amazing. It's a Friday night in Vegas, at a hole in the wall taco shop. The single file line is out the door.....Now that's a recipe for GREAT Mexican food"}
{"text":"Awesome burritos!  The tortilla is super fluffy and the burritos are huge! They have great customer service as well.  I've gotten the California burrito which is really packed with toppings and fries.  The veggie is great too.  Note, the rice, refried beans, and fries are cooked in lard.  So not that friendly for vegetarians but they can make a veggie with whole pinto beans and all the toppings. Would def get the veggie again!  California...for sure.  Excellent."}
{"text":"Today I'm searching for good barbacoa. I dined at a modern Latin/fusion restaurant miles from here and they served something they called barbacoa (tasted like mop strands soaked in mild chili sauce). Barbacoa can be done with beef cheeks and/or the meat from the head braised then flash grilled to add some crispy bits.  The decor is minimal with some paintings and decorations, people are here to eat good Mexican comfort food. The place is small and the service is quick and friendly.  They don't serve barbacoa exactly, they have cabeza (beef meat from the head of a cow). The barbacoa from my childhood was made from beef cheeks and cabeza. I sampled the cabeza taco, which was good but I would recommended going light on the condiments (onion and cilantro) to get the full flavor."}
{"text":"Their food is delicious!!! I got Huevos Rancheros and my bf got menudo. He loved it! The lady at the register was friendly and super nice! The coffee is really good too!!"}
{"text":"Came here while visiting my friend in Vegas.  We wanted tacos and I'm picky about Mexican food.  This place totally hit the mark.  Not only was it delicious, the lady taking orders was super sweet and a really good salesperson.  I was debating on getting carne asada fries because i had already had fast food that day.  Here's how the convo went:  Her: do you eat them [carne asada fries] every day?   Me: well, no... Her: then they're not so bad then Me: good point  Salsa bar was on point and the spicy carrots and onions were crispy and super hot.  Yum."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for a few days and after eating at a number of the expensive resort offerings we found this little diamond in the rough. This place ROCKS! Totally authentic mexican food. The tacos and flautas are legit and hit the spot dead on. We are mexican and we know our cuisine and you can't go wrong eating here. Just stop reading this review and try it. Like now.  Go!"}

{"text":"Craving for authentic Mexican Food and feeling adventurous and out of your comfort zone. Gotta try this humble and family operated place. Everything I had was simply delicious and would go out of my way to venture in this neighborhood for Tacos and Mexican food  The cashier/server was very friendly and asked if it was my first time here. She answered my questions and made me feel welcomed. I originally was going to order Tacos only but the enchilada combo grab my attention and got the combo with a single order of Carne Asada Taco on the side because I had to get a taco too.   When the order finally arrived at my table. I got the three different salsas that was available at the salsa bar. From the first bite of my taco and enchiladas 1-beef & 2-chicken combination along with the fresh salsas. Every bite was amazingly flavorful and authentic. The whole experience was great and felt like I was taking a short vacation in Mexico!"}

{"text":"Had dinner here with hubby and toddler.  Great food. Great prices.  Good inside atmosphere, can't say the same about the outside.  Good customer service.  When we were there they were so busy service was a little slow, but understandable.  Check out their daily specials. Will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"We tried carnitas, pescado and pastor tacos. All of the seasonings we're on point. Hole in the wall and authentic feeling place with a great looking menu. We will be back to work our way through it! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Only 1 review?? C'mon! This place has awesome food!! It's rough around the edges but don't let it fool you. Tacos! Burritos! 3 different soups!"}
{"text":"This place is special. All their food is made with the care you would expect at a family gathering. The hospitality is incredible. This is NOT your typical Mexican turn-and-burn kind of place. Every dish I've ordered thus far has been absolutely fantastic...Well assembled and delicious. Personally, I love the \"caldo de pollo\" (chicken soup). I could eat it every day! This establishment is a definite winner in my book!!"}
{"text":"I will say our expectations were guarded when we pulled up, but step inside and receive a warm greeting and look at the menu, you know all will be good, and it was. The burrito was tasty and plentiful, \"sandwich\" with the fried pork, Pastor tortas, absolutely satisfying, simple and perfect. The hot salsas were fun and tasty. Enjoy"}
{"text":"This place is great. I come here almost every day. Today I had a California burrito which was incredible. The fish tacos are always delicious. I really enjoy coming here, the staff is nice and it's always clean."}
