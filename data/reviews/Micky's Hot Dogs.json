{"text":"This place is the SHIT. I just recently found it driving through Mesa, went home and yelped it  And found out they were making sonoran hot dogs ( ***Lord, please let these be good so I don't have to drive 220 miles roundtrip once every 2 or 3 months by myself just to have a proper sonoran hot dog and drive straight back***) and these things called caramelos.

These sonoran hot dogs were just as good if not better than el guero canelo down in tucson. In fact I would say they were better. 

I never had a caramelo before, and I still don't know what the technical difference between them and a quesadilla is, but after eating one I will now be naming my first child Caramelo, boy or girl. 

Eating these two food items were far and above more satisfying than having sex with a chick who is a 10. In fact I almost busted a nutt after my first bite of the caramelo. Which ironically will end up saving me a trip to the doctor because I was beginning to think I needed Viagra as of recently. 

Oh, and this place is cheap as fuck. If our currency ends up experiencing hyper-inflation and losing almost all its value, this place will probably still be affordable.

The reviewers below, geoff, kelly, and gary who gave this place only 3 stars must have brain damage."}
{"text":"The Birria is delicious and the Sonora hot dog are  like good next time I will try the torta"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a great authentic Sonoran Hotdog and I found it!! Quaint and cozy and great service and amazing hot dogs!!!"}
{"text":"I've been looking for a good taco place near my house, THIS PLACE IS IT! Hands down tu best tacos I've ate for the longest. Their salsas and guacamole are amazing too!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite finds while visiting in the Mesa area. Real Authentic Sonoran Hot Dogs!  They really wrap the hot dog in bacon, and they even have the right buns! Tacos Caramelos are excellent as well!  A nice little taste of Sonora!  Bring cash! As they don't accept cards."}
{"text":"I live like half a mile from here and sometimes being in the ghetto has a plus lol love the tacos. Can eat like 5 or a hot dog or two. Bring cash no cards accepted."}
{"text":"Cheap, fast, good. 

Had a Sonoran hot dog and (the actual name is escaping me) french fries covered in very thin deep fried slices of frank (hot dog) and nacho cheese. Both were excellent. Any good Mexican dive always has Mexican Coke and Mickey's did not disappoint. 

Highly recommended for some cheap eats and good food. Remember, they only take cash."}
{"text":"Okay hot dogs........ticket times way to long! Mmmm bathrooms right by entrance kind of gross."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place is so highly rated.

When I was 5 months pregnant my husband and I got food poisoning from some of their bacon hot dogs. I feel like in general you should make sure the food you're serving is fully cooked or not too old but I think when someone's pregnant you REALLY should. Because of that I spent the next two days in the bathroom puking my guts out and in a hospital with an IV in my arm. I'm sure when everything is cooked well it tastes great, my problem was that it wasn't. There are so many other hot dog places in Arizona save your money and go somewhere worth it."}
{"text":"Incredible hot dog. Best I've had in years. The bun was soft and sweet the beans added nice flavor and the dog itself was perfect. I will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"The hotdogs were decent but the lady was rude very rude , had no customer service didnt feel welcomed when you walked in . I wouldnt recommend this place to anyone ."}
{"text":"Ahh! Had my 1st ever Sonoran hot dog today and it was really good,service was A-1.I believe the owners of the place served us,very friendly and accommodating for the dog,I sat down inside at a table looked at the dog,Yup thats a Sonoran dog alright,then I took my first bite,oh boy thats good!  lots of different flavors going on and they were all good,then I eyed the roasted pepper that came with the dog I stripped off the meaty parts and placed the pepper on the dog and took another bite,it was heaven! not terribly hot but very flavorful and the bun was the best I've ever encountered,I'll be trying the famous Sonoran dogs of Tucson in the near future I just hope they are as good as Mickeys"}
{"text":"First off, I am not a big fan of hot dogs, but a co-worker had brought the subject up and I am always willing to try something new.  I  have tried new york style, Chicago style and now  I can say the sonoran style hot dogs. I usually like just the basic hot dog and not with too much added to it because it ends up usually that you don't taste any of the hot dog. First off, let me compliment the bread, it is nice and soft and has a finer texture than the normal hot dog buns almost like a pastry. I had the hot dog with onions, beans, mustard, and a very small(tiny) amount of cheese that I got charged extra. First off, the bacon was so thin, I did not even notice it at all, I even cleared the  condiments off on one and did not still notice anything different. I had 2 hot dogs because I wanted to get a good taste for it and the hot dogs aren't that big and won't fill the normal person up with just one. The hot dog is a normal hot dog that you can likely get at any store, nothing special about flavor or texture to it. I guess it has to do with people's taste, I did not think it was anything special. The bun had to be the best  I have tasted and that is why I gave it a 3 star. The place is okay, more of  a take out place, small but has nice outside area. prices were decent, 2.50/dog with extra for cheese wiz, it came in a bottle so I don't think it was real cheese.  I can say I have tasted the sonoran hot dog but in my opinion, nothing special."}
{"text":"I read the reviews here and thought I would go try one since I work very close.  The Sonoran dog is ok.  Not great and not terrible.  The plus is that the hot dog is grilled.  Beyond that, most of the toppings were mayo and ketchup.  The hot dog is on the small side.  It didn't rock my world, so probably will not be back."}
{"text":"This my new place to go place When I'm in Mesa with the boyfriend the hot dogs and Tortas  are delicious and birra is good"}
{"text":"Loved everything about it!!! Tacos and hot dogs were great! Hubby and I were both FULL and wanted to order more! (We only didn't because we didn't want to ruin it by making ourselves sick and we only live about 15 minutes away) So, we will be back! 

Hubby has traveled all over the country and LOVES hot dogs. He says \"this is the best hot dog ever!\" 

I know we will be back often and it's the perfect place to eat after 2nd Friday art walk in mesa! :)"}
{"text":"Last summer I had my first sonoran dog down in Tucson.  Last night I stumbled upon Micky's right here on Yelp and was psyched that sonoran dogs were to be found in my area.  Micky's is a small joint that sells dogs and Mexican food and it's all cheap.  I ordered two sonoran dogs, paid and took my receipt outside to the man at the patio grill where he cooked up my dogs.  Delicious...just like the ones I had in Tucson.  I cannot wait to go back.  These small joints are always the best.  Viva Micky's!"}
{"text":"Thought they had closed down. Not so! Just a new sign. Also, closed on tuesdays.

Excellent Sonoran-style hot dog: bacon wrapped with beans, tomato, mayo, mustard, etc. As good as the best I've had in Tucson (el Nene, Ruiz), and better than Moreno's down the street (they are not bacon wrapped as a Sonoran dog should be; Mickey's are)."}
{"text":"Went back and the horchata was delish. Hubby had street tacos and thought the flavor was great. I stuck with my faves, the $2.50 desert dogs. Get two, really."}
{"text":"Was hungry for a late night snack and looked through yelp for some good eats. Read the review and decided to give Mickeys a try. Never had a Sonoran hotdog before coming here and I gotta admit I fell in love with it! The taste is sooo good it'll make you jus want more. I give this place 2 thumbs up and will be returning for more. Although a word of advice, it wouldn't be hard to know a little Spanish when entering this joint...felt like I was in Mexico again. All in all great place and budget friendly."}
{"text":"Outstanding hotdogs! Couldn't get enough but the tacos were smaller than i anticipated still good yet very simple. Decent pricing but overall a hidden treasure"}
{"text":"This place is 100% dope. Such friendly and helpful people work here. The hot dogs are frickin' awesome! I recommend getting everything on em."}
{"text":"Best freaking hot dogs would not recommend the the tacos or anthing else the owner is really stingy on her food. Other then that this place is the bomb I will never stop coming here for a hot dog here."}
{"text":"So good!! Had a sanoran dog and carne burro. Both were delicious but that hot dog was so great. Very happy with this place."}
{"text":"Good hotdogs. Super busy today (Thursday night) and super slow service. 40 minutes for 3 hotdogs...maybe they should have more people working because there were only 2 and that included the cashier. Other times i've been there its pretty quick service so i probably just went on one of their busy nights. I also had a \"caramelo\" which was sooo good! The carne asada is tasty there. I think next time i'll get carne asada tacos."}
{"text":"Occasionally you'll find yourself in a pickle, and you'll ask yourself, \"Do I want Mexican or American?\" The correct answer to this age old question is both. Mickey's serves scrumptious bacon wrapped hot dogs with as many toppings as you want, but the real surprise lies inside where the south of the border comes alive. Bring cash, make sure to try a pastor taco, and prepare to be in ecstasy."}
{"text":"Mickey's Tacos is awesome! Their Sonoran hot dogs are awesome and their other food is wonderful. It looks like a very small unassuming place, but the food is worth the trip!"}
{"text":"My first Sonoran hot dog.  Overall, good.  I was nearby for a convention, saw it on Yelp and stopped.  I would not necessarily go way out of my way to visit, but if you're nearby, give it a try.  Oh, and the cabeza tacos are also very good."}
{"text":"Damn good.  Just try one hot dog (and/or a taco)."}
{"text":"This is a strange place to review. The Sonoran hot dog was a 5 star item, one of the best dogs I've eaten (and I've eaten Chicago dogs at Wrigley Field). But the place is a hole in the wall and the food I saw other people eating didn't look like anything special and a little pricy. The Sonoran hotdog was well worth the three dollars. Even the bun was amazing. I will go back for the hotdogs, but probably not use this place for anything else. Btw, knowing Spanish will help you when you order your food. 
Okay... I'm editing this review and downgrading it one star... reason? I've been at this place three times, they were only open for business once in those three visits, and I was there during their business hours. I will keep going back for the incredible Sonoran dogs, but will take a star away every time they are closed during their reg business hours."}
{"text":"Their sonoran dogs are delicious and only $2.50 apiece! This is the only place I have had them so I don't have much to compare them to but I think they are AMAZING.

I really enjoy their tacos as well, and they are only $1.35 each. I love that they have the salsa bar set up with pickled onions, avocado sauce, sliced limes, and pico. Did I mention pickled onions?!? That is something I am only used to getting at nicer, sit-down restaurants. They really make the tacos.

Glad I don't live super close or I would be here all the time. CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"Best Sonoran hot dogs this side of the border! Neighborhood not for the faint of heart but it's safe. Quick, easy and delicious. Fresh baked buns, real Mexican soda products, horchata and a great salsa bar as well. They also have many other tasty items on the menu besides hot dogs! An overall experience not to be missed. Come once and you will be back!"}
{"text":"The name threw me. Thinking it was a hot dog joint that had sonoran hot dogs I went to try some. Turns out they have very good Mexican food at very reasonable prices. Dogs are great but so are the tacos at only $1.35 a piece!"}
{"text":"This place is always great for a late night snack. This place has the best Sonoran hotdog in town. They also have a really good burrito and other things such as tacos and Vampiros. There is inside or outdoor seating and a salad bar which includes guacamole, salsa, cucumbers and other salad type add ons."}
{"text":"Located in a colorful Small Shack on side of the road in a sadly depressed industrial area of Mesa. You may see people pushing a cart with their belongings or scrap metals at a slow pace while humming a cosmic tune or talking to an invisible companion from outside this realm.

Inside this small wonder they offer an assortment of tasty Tacos, Burritos, Tortas, Quesadillas, and Sonoran Hot dogs. Fresh Salsas are made daily and displayed along with pickled red onions, radishes, and other yummies at the Salsa bar.

I had to try the bacon wrapped Sonoran Hot dogs loaded with everything and some Tacos al Pastor on the side just to see if I was missing anything. I really liked the Mexican style hot dog bun that was used. It was sweeter than your normal grocery bun. Very simple and tasty. Don't forget a trip to the salsa bar to dress up you dog or tacos which helps kick the flavors up a notch. Service was friendly and quick and inside was clean and tidy.

Definitively A-OK and then some. Worth the drive when you need a Mexican Style Hot Dog. CASH ONLY. Delicioso!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place by accident, and now will never go anywhere else for a hot dog.  The absolute best!"}
{"text":"Here's the thing. I call in. I ask \"how much are hot dogs\" he goes \"hold on a moment\" then he throws some lady on who literally had no clue what English was. Then I finally put in the order somehow. I get there. The lady ignores me for a moment. Then she looks up and I told her I just ordered on the phone and she goes \"cash only\". So the business owner of this place is so UTTERLY useless that he only hires people who don't speak English and on top of that can't even get a merchant service to swipe card transactions?! It's basically free. Imagine if I built a business in Mexico City. Where all the employees only spoke English and we didn't take pesos. Useless. Get your act together."}
{"text":"Nestled amongst the dreary grit of Mesa's industrial district, Mickey's touts a specialty that's slowly gathering a diverse fan base:  Mexican-style hot dogs, *WRAPPED IN BACON*.

Mickey's serves traditional Mexican fare that's pretty good too.  A serve-yourself condiment station loaded with salsas and peppers stands in a customer accessible area.  A light-eating friend of mine comes here for low-buck lunches, and claims she can transform a pair of one-dollar quesadillas into a complete meal by covering them with ladle-fulls of complimentary salsa.

Mickey's has a tiny indoor dining area, but compensates with a small outdoor patio that faces MacDonald Street.  You order inside, then pick up your hot dogs from a mobile cart that sits outside the entrance.  The bacon-wrap combines with Mexican seasonings and a panaderia-style hot dog bun to make an interesting taste treat that's unlike any hot dog you've ever had.  Size-wise, the hot dogs aren't massive...picture a slightly plumper than normal dog on an average length bun.  At two-fifty each, a pair of them make a five-dollar lunch that'll satisfy most light to normal appetites.  The downside?  This is Arizona....evenings on the patio can be nice, but summer heat can make outdoor dining downright uncomfortable during the day.  Other odd quirks?  The guy running the hot dog cart has a ghetto blaster....and blast it he does.  Stranger yet, don't come  here looking for bacon-wrapped goodness at lunchtime....a sign behind the counter warns that hot dogs aren't available till after 4:00PM.

Prices?  Relatively Cheap.  Quality? Better than average.  Ambiance is minimal, and the surrounding area is utterly devoid of neighborly charm.  Still, a new taste treat that sets you back only five bucks doesn't come around that often.  My advice? Make your way down to the corner of Broadway and MacDonald.....after 4:00 PM."}
{"text":"Pretty good place overall, a little down and dirty, but not \"bad\" dirty.

I didn't have any problems ordering.  The lady could understand what I wanted.  They actually give you a ticket for the hot dog and you go outside to get it.

The dog is good and filling.  Some people here talked about the other things on the menu being small, and they're right.  See the picture and the pen for reference.  You can eat the taco in 2 big bites.  The caramelo might take a couple more, but not much.

The flavor was excellent, especially the caramelo.  Very strong in all the right ways.  It made me forget about the price.  The taco was good overall and the salsa bar is what I like.  The hot dog itself could have had more flavor, but it comes together well.  Despite the smallish size of the taco and caramelo it was still a filling meal with the hot dog and the total, with a can of soda, was around $8.50.  I left satisfied."}
{"text":"Gross!  Was so excited to try the Mexican hot dog and it was extremely disappointing.  I thought the bacon would add a lot of delicious flavor to the hot dog but it didn't.  The dog was tasteless as was the bacon.  Not sure how that happened.  the sweet bread bun was also very odd tasting with the hot dog.  Ive never had a mexican dog before so Im not sure if thats normal for the bun to be sweet but it really didn't work for me.  The whole thing left a horrible, awful taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"Awesome hot dogs! Today was my second time at this place and I'm definitively coming back.. The bread is amazing just like the ones in Sonora state! Thumbs up to this place, you need to order the hot dog with everything... Yummiii :)"}
{"text":"I lived in Tucson for many years and boy do I sure miss a great Tucson Sonoran hot dog!  Thank goodness for Micky's Hot Dogs and it's the only restaurant that is comparable to the Tucson Sonoran hot dog stands right here in Mesa, AZ. It's heavenly to bite into a Sonoran dog in a soft bolillo roll, with the bacon wrapped dog, pinto beans, and all the fixings like cheese, onions, roasted peppers with mayo, ketchup and mustard. I like mine with sour cream, chorizo, and pineapple, too. It's all good here, even the tacos.  Also a great place to  take your out of state visiting friends for a cheap, and yummy lunch! Thanks Micky's!"}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Phoenix I come here, craving their Sonoran dogs. The hot dogs are $3 (cash only) wrapped in bacon, smothered in all the fixings, with a condiment bar full of salsas, pico, onions, etc. The hot dogs are delicious. The owners and employees are a bit reserved (that's all I can think when I read the negative reviews about \"rude customer service\") but they are all extremely polite and friendly. As a white girl walking into a decidedly Mexican joint, I am never made to feel unwelcome."}
{"text":"Great Sonoran hot dogs, somewhat limited on the menu selection."}
{"text":"Way too expensive for a hot dog.  Confusing to eat there too unless you can speak Spanish.  Last time I checked I wasn't in Mexico."}
{"text":"Don't get the wrong idea about this place it is absolutely Mexican food, so don't think it is some quaint little hot dog stand. They have one Mexican style hot dog that is pretty good but the rest is tacos, enchiladas, burritos ek cetera. The clientele is primarily people from the neighborhood the seating area is very small unless you count the patio which is as big as the rest of the seating area. Don't be surprised if they're closed the seem to take a random vacation days."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was kid. I've had many Sonoran hot dogs in my life (my fam is from Sonora). I like these better than the ones in the state of Sonora! It's a little run down place and if good service is what you are looking for, don't expect it here. They aren't rude, but they aren't very friendly either. That's how they treat everyone, like I said, I've been coming for many years. Also, I wouldn't recommend anything else on the menu - just the hot dogs. 5 stars for the taste"}
{"text":"This place is great. Hardly find any Sonoran dogs that are this good. Though, those from Tucson are better but this is good enough for the Phx area. The cons are that the tacos are quite tiny and they only accept cash. There is a so called salad bar so you can fill in extra ingredients if the dogs don't have enough of your favorites. I would come again when I'm craving for Mexican food. The location is easy to find. It is in the corner. However, if you drive from Broadway, you can't really get into the place. You must turn left then make a U turn shortly after to do it. Most people take it to go but I would rather eat there so everything is not too soggy,especially the buns after a drive home."}
{"text":"The best Sonoran hot dog I have ever had!  Well, it's the ONLY Sonoran hot dog I have ever had, but it does not stop them from being crazy good!  Fully loaded, they have so much stuff on them that they are practically a salad (and you know that if it is a salad, it must be healthy)."}
{"text":"It's flipping good. 'Nuff said. The salsa is hot. The cucumbers are cold. The hot dogs are wrapped in bacon. I'd come back."}
{"text":"Since moving from Tucson I have been in search for an authentic Sonora hot dog. Mickey's is the closest have come across. Well worth the trip into Mesa a couple times a month to get my fix!"}
{"text":"Well my brother has talked about this place often on for a while. We came here yesterday and what's really weird is we're back today. It's fantastic I'm normally not a hot dog person but this is over-the-top good you got to try it. The owner is gracious and kind hard-working cares about the food. I had to tell my fellow yelpers about this gem in old town Mesa. And it's a bargain too."}
{"text":"Maybe my expectations were too high or something, but I don't know what all the fuss is about a Sonoran style hot dog. While very tasty, it is nothing more than what we call here at home a \"TJ (Tijuana) style\" hot dog. I'm sure the Sonoran dog came before they did the same dog in TJ and Mexicali, but the only difference between the Sonoran and a TJ style hot dog is that the Sonoran's bacon wrapped hot dog is also topped with beans, whereas the TJ's bacon wrapped dog does not. Very tasty I will admit, but no real extra WOW factor added, especially when you take into consideration the $2.50 price tag for one.

My son had a carne asada quesadilla, and to be quite honest, this quesadilla impressed me more than the hot dogs did. I don't know what they put in the cheese or what they did to the carne, but it was basically crack, because it was addicting! It wasn't huge, but wasn't small. But the meat to ooey-gooey cheesey goodness was nothing short of perfect, and its simplicity, yet its complexicity made it even more mind boggling. What kind of cheese wast it? Oaxacan? Monterrey? I don't know. My palate isn't that refined, but I don't know how they made something so simple taste so darn delicious. The cheese was perfectly melted. Melted, yet thick. Like the cheese that you have to pull off from the wrapper of an In-N-Out double-double or from the roof of a pizza box. Let's put it this way..........my son didn't finish it, and we reheated it at the hotel the next day, and it was still good!

The only reason I gave this establishment 3 stars instead of the 4 I wanted to give it was because the service INSIDE sucked. Outside, the young man making the hot dogs was quick and efficient. INSIDE, the lady taking our order didn't seem like she was in the mood to either deal with us, or to be there period. We ordered the hot dogs and the quesadilla at the same time, yet I had to go ask her if she put in the order for the quesadilla. She told me I didn't order one, and then had to check her hand written receipts against the cash register's because she probably didn't believe me, and 15 minutes later, she found it, and then asked me if I still wanted it. Hell yeah I still wanted it! I paid for it! 

With that being said, I'd come back here next time I visit my cousin to give that lady another shot and to try their tacos and/or tortas."}
{"text":"Visited Phoenix for some rest and relaxation.  A friend of ours mentioned the need to try a Sonora Dog.  Visited Yelp and searched and searched for a restaurant in Phoenix which was actually a food truck that didn't set up until evening.  A quick search in Yelp found us Micky's Dogs in Mesa.  We made the quick 30 minute trip and found a little \"hole in the wall\" restaurant which is not in the best part of Mesa, but my wife and I have conclued some of the best foods are often found in less than desirable locations.  THIS IS THE CASE WITH MICKEY'S DOGS. Be warned, this is not a sit down restaurant with servers. You order at the counter and wait for the deliciousness to be created.  A few tables and chairs are available, but I can see this place getting packed very easily due to the great food being served.The Sonora Dogs are superb.  The bread is soft, the bacon wrapped wiener tasty, and the beans and cheese topping are great.  MICKEY's also serves \"Salchipapas\" which are basically french fries, fried bits of wiener and cheese sauce. This may sound simple, but my wife and I are still talking about this decadent side. We had the pleasure of meeting the owner and were happy to have met her.  All in all a great experience for the culinary adventurous."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. They are called Micky's Hot Dogs, but the menu is pretty much everything but. We got two hot dogs, a carne asada burrito, the salchipapas, and some kind of tostada. The hot dogs were delicious, but everything else was pretty dry and/or bland. Even the salsas needed salt. The staff wasn't very friendly either. Thumbs down from me!"}
{"text":"Everything mentioned by the review below is true. However, it forgets to mention that Mickey's not only offers Bacon, but a choice of Beans, Mayo, Chile, Salsa, cheese, cream, etc. Also, they offer a diverse choice of drinks, mostly inspired by the bottling of down south. Horchata included.

I came here a long time ago after being disappointed by what people know as Tex-Mex?!  Anyways, not important as the pictures do all the talking.

Also, excuse my short and un-insightful review as I really haven't written anything in a good while."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp. I came by to pick up some Sonoran Hot Dogs to take to work. Fail! They don't serve hot dogs until after 12pm. It was 1130am and I didn't have time to wait. 

I saw Caramelos (meat and cheese sandwiched between 2 tortillas and crisp up on both sides) on the menu and decided to stay and order a couple of asada ones hoping they were as good as the ones from  BK in Tucson. Very tasty and almost the same but I still like BK better. Maybe because I got it to go and by the time I got to work it wasn't very crispy anymore. The asada was flavorful and not at all fatty. It definitely hit the spot. 

The restaurant decor, signs, menu, and logo reminds me a lot of BK, too. Hell, even their condiment station offered very similar stuff. 

I will go back after 12pm one day to try their hot dogs. Even if those suck, I'd still go back for their Caramelos. Quick fix without having to go all the way to Tucson."}
{"text":"Really good Sonoran hot dogs.  Prepared the traditional way - wrapped in bacon with onion, tomato, salsa, beans on a special larger bun.  Very tasty and very reasonable.  Clean little place with pleasant service.  I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I lived in Tucson for 12 years before moving to Tempe. As such, I've eaten many Sonoran hot dogs at the best known places (El Guero Canelo, BK's etc). Micky's are the ONLY Sonoran dogs I've found in metro Phoenix that are comparable to the Tucson greats. In fact, I think Micky's makes a better hot dog than El Guero Canelo (gasp!). Since El Guero switched their buns from normal to gigantor sized bolillos, their balance has suffered. Too much bread relative to the filling. Micky's are just right. Combine that with mesquite grilled hot dogs with nice, chewy charred bacon and a green hot sauce that's actually hot, and you've got something. The only down side is that you don't get a grilled chile on the side. 

I've never had anything else here, so I can't comment on the quality of other items. I can't imagine they're bad if they do a hot dog this well.

Also, I always get the \"what are YOU doing here, gringo?\" look from the staff whenever I go, particularly from the lady that runs the place. That might be offputting to some people, but for me it just reinforces the fact that I'm in the right place to get REAL Sonoran food."}
{"text":"Used to go here almost every other day when I first moved up here, for one simple reason it was good (not like the ones back home). Went there the other night and tacos were extremely cold!! Hot dog wasn't as good as before, wasn't bad but wasn't good. If mickeys is one of your options go with the other place, if mickeys is your choice then it's s win either way."}
{"text":"The meat is really good, i recommend the carne asada on tacos burrito or quesadillas wont be disappointed"}
{"text":"Only reason I'm holding back a star is the bun. I drove from Avondale to try this place (I'm on a quest, don't judge). I ordered 4 Sonoran hot dogs (to be fair, they only serve Sonoran style, so there's no confusion) and a Diet Coke and then began the waiting game...

Pretty short waiting game. Less than  5 minutes and a slightly awkward moment where I'm unintentionally eavesdropping on the Spanish conversation behind me later, I'm out the door with 4 delicious dogs in hand.

The great- the beans are nice and spiced. Just a little kick in the aftertaste to bring it all together. The toppings are fresh and placed on the dog in the right order. The dog is hot and the bacon is crispy without being burnt.

The mediocre- The bun. It's too soft and can't hold the toppings. And mine felt soggy. Not sure if they steamed it beforehand, but I don't like soggy buns. I'd prefer a tougher bun that can hold the delicious toppings without falling apart.

All in all, it was worth the drive. Easy to find, delicious dogs, authentic toppings. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Very good sonoran hot dogs for a decent price.  Interesting location, but food is worth it."}
{"text":"Very good Sonoran Hot Dogs and carne asada quesadillas. Will definitely be back. Prices are fair and tax is included in the listed price. CASH ONLY!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out asked the cashier what's good? Sonora dog ok give me 2 I get a 2 day old dog wrapped in bacon no flavor 6 beans slathered in sauces ( mayo ketchup mustard) took a bite not impressed take another bite just to make sure traded for a carne asada burrito everything is seared and rolled up delicious"}
{"text":"Best Mexican hot dogs in town!  Small but cheap, so buy two for a meal!"}
{"text":"Will fly from NY to AZ any day of the week for their sonoran dog! I would pitch myself a tent right outside their stand and have a sonoran dog every day if I could. Super yum!"}
{"text":"CASH ONLY!

Micky's Hot Dogs is a great establishment. When we got there, there was a car wash fundraiser in the parking lot for a women's rehab, which I thought was great of Micky's to support. 

Yelp said it opened at 11, but we arrived at around 10:45 and they were open! They let us sit while we waited for our friend. 

The Sonoran Dog was pretty darn good! Bacon wrapped and with all the fixings. What stood out was the bun. Not sure what it was but it as slightly sweet, warm, and delicious! 

They have a small seating area inside and outside. 

The workers there are nice too. I was short $1 and some cents for a big order for 3 people (remember, CASH ONLY!) but they said it was ok. I'd come here again if I ever want a Sonoran Dog."}
{"text":"I gotta say that the quality here has gone downhill. My last review here was in 2013 and it was great back then but now........eh I wouldn't bother. The Sonoran dogs are now a big disappointment compared to what else is out there. As a side note....El Guero Canelo just opened a shop out in Phoenix so just do yourself the favor and head out there for a good Sonoran dog."}
{"text":"Mickey's Hot Dogs is a slightly gritty Taqueria during the week. Ironically, The guy with the mesquite and the grill doesn't show up until Friday! Sonoron Dogs rock! I have to be the first to confess that mayo in a squeeze bottle DOES wierd me out a little, but the bacon and cheese thing is pretty yummy! If you come during the week for the taqueria, be prepared for everything from lengua to barbacoa etc. Really down home, good salsa but not fresh hand made tortillas.
There is really no atmosphere. It is a little gritty. The food is worthwhile."}
{"text":"Honestly, I am at a loss.

\"Hot Dogs\" are in the name of this little Restaurant and being a \"Hot Dog Aficionado\" I had to try when I was close.

Maybe NOT the biggest disappointment I have had, but certainly ranks right up there. The hot dogs are \"Sonoran Style\" wrapped in Bacon and with all of the necessary \"fixings\" (beans, jalapenos, tomatoes, mayonnaise). From the bun bordering on stale, to the total lack of taste this was not only a disappointment but a significant waste of time. Somehow, even with bacon, there was just no taste whatsoever. Fortunately at $3.00 not big waste of money.

They could take some lessons from other \"Hot Dog Joints\" in Phoenix that manage to get it right! 

Obviously, based on previous Reviews, I am in the minority here."}
{"text":"I went to Micky's a couple years ago, and their Sonoran hotdogs changed my life. They are so good! I get cravings for them all the time, but don't live in AZ. Life is a little hard sometimes."}
{"text":"Delicious Sonoran Hot Dogs! Don't be discouraged by the location, it's totally worth it. The only disappointment came with the bun. We got a regular hot dog bun instead of bolillo. The real Sonoran bun would have put it over the top."}
{"text":"I came here for the hot dogs. I came for just 1 and ended up getting another one. Yes they are that good. The bread and everything combined is sooo delicious. I also got the horchata which was on point. It's good real good I must try if you haven't had."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good can't say it's the best Sonoran style hotdogs that I've ever had but it's pretty close... The prices are pretty affordable too .. How ever the service is not that great they lack good customer service skills .. I had a Sonoran hotdog,salchi papas which are fries topped with jalapeño nacho cheese and sliced hotdog and an horchata .. Prob will go back not to many places like this one here in Mesa :)... O Btw CASH Only!"}
{"text":"I live right around the area and had never been here. big mistake! excellent food and sonoran dogs. the burritos are excellent as well"}
{"text":"Sonoran Dogs-Yum! Horchata.... Bottled Mexican sodas....this place makes me miss trips to mexico"}
{"text":"These guys make a damn good Sonoran hot dog.  It is very authentic and very tasty. They have typically Mexican food on the menu as well, but I have only had the hot dogs.  FYI: They only take cash."}
{"text":"Best sonoran hot dog in Arizona. I've been to the places in Tucson and around the Phienix metro area. None of them come close. $2.50 for a meal in a bun, can't beat that. Cash only so plan ahead. The carne asada burrito is darn good too if you're not a hot dog fan."}
{"text":"Good, cheap Sonoran dogs. Not quite up to the Tucson standard, but it's the best you can get anywhere else. I'll be back because I like this place's style."}
{"text":"Well I've been on a search for Sonoran hot dogs. Mickeys were pretty good. Lots of toppings and good size dog. They wrap the dog in bacon and cover it in beans, pico de gallo and I think sour creme. The bun did not seem to be large enough for me to make a perfect dog, but it was good. The staff was friendly and service was quick. 
The shop is a small facility, but we found a seat. We also ate carne asada tacos too. The meat was not as good as others in town. Check out the salsa though as it's hot! Be especially careful of the red salsa, wow hot! The green is super good and I want to eat that again for sure.
I will be back to hit up another hot dog and salsa! Please note Cash Only!!"}
{"text":"These bessssst Sonoran hotdog I've ever had!! And only $3.00? Couldn't get any better! Went yesterday the lady who made it for me was really smiley and sweet. New favorite spot for sure. HIGHLY recommend."}
{"text":"Sonoran dogs here are yummy.. I love their buns almost like a croissant. I order my hot dogs with no mayo and the small quesadillas are great too. Their horchata is a little more creamy - I thought it was good. Small hole in the wall and they only accept cash."}
{"text":"After reading that they have caramelos I had to go!  Its a small place but was able to sit inside & it was clean. I had a caramelo & a hotdog. Boy was it good! My husband had the carne asada tacos & pastor torta & he liked both. They have a nice condiment bar with limes,onions, pico de gallo, jalapenos and some other stuff. It was fresh too. The price cant be beat either."}
{"text":"Mickey's Hot Dogs is a unique hole-in-the-wall place that serves Mexican food alongside hot dogs, that's right... hot dogs!  The reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because the food was okay.  

First off, the hot dogs were pretty much Ball Park franks topped with various ingredients.  The bun was really flimsy and got soggy almost instantly.  I enjoyed the flavor but the sogginess of the bun turned me off. 

As for the Mexican food, being a Mexican restaurant, they were decent but not my favorite place.  I ordered two of the Tacos Al Pastor which were brought out swiftly.  I would rate the Tacos a 4 out of 5 stars because the toppings were incredible but the meat was a little dry.  Al Pastor tacos are typically extremely flavorful, but these were, like I said, decent.

Would I visit Mickey's again?  Yes.  I would just stick to Mexican food."}
{"text":"The food is good and tasty but the service is so bad, every time we visit this place we wonder why we keep coming if the employees are rude and they lack friendliness."}
{"text":"I found this place through Yelp after craving some Mexican hot dogs. I live in Los Angeles Ca so I know what a good Mexican hot dog taste like! Those Downtown LA dogs cant be beat but these hot dogs came very close! Dont listen to those negative reviews. They clearly dont know what theyre talking about. If you are looking for authentic Mexican food come here!!."}
{"text":"Found this place when we were visiting family and wow!!! Best hot dog I've had in a long time. Sonoran style hot dog was a the bomb!!!! Highly recommend this place! Will definitely be back when we come visit next time. Only reason it didn't get a 5 star was because the location was not very appealing ."}
{"text":"I am from sonora so i know the flavor of sonora style"}
{"text":"Found this place b/c of Yelp and glad I did.

Great Sonoran hot dogs.  I got two and was uber full.  The first time I went I recall less than optimal communication.  I asked how many types of dogs they had, and the answer was \"how many?\".  

Today was the 2nd time and things went much better.  Very helpful and once again a great meal.  I also feel like it was a bit cleaner this time, maybe they straightened up or repainted.

It is in a below average neighborhood but worth the adventure.  Go for the food, not the ambiance."}
{"text":"Had the Sonoran dog, pastor tacos, vampira tostada and everything was excellent, real coke to wash it down but take cash as no cards accepted."}
{"text":"We looovvveee this place! The hotdogs are great and service is amazing! The hot sauce is the best I always have to take one home and the birrah is the best in town! Highly recommended to anyone!"}
{"text":"Change your damn hours on yelp says your open 11am to 11pm, I'm here on a Tuesday 5:40pm and your door is locked. I have had hotdogs from here before and they are good. But come on if your hours on here say your open from a certain time to a certain time go by it. Not even a sign on the door saying the Times or days your open."}
{"text":"Pretty damn good Sonoran dogs here in Mesa. Yes some (non-ers) might call it a hole in the wall Mexican place ... but if you know anything about good food, a hole in the wall place is where you are going to get it! And this place did not disappoint.
 The dogs were so good I went back in just to try the tacos ... had a carne asada one, which was good. The toppings bar definitely added to the experience - pickled red onions, pico, green salsa and (some sought of) avocado salsa, made it all the more tasty.
 Will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"Terrific.  Had one of the Hot Dogs and a Taco al Pastor.  Wonderful flavors, and filled me up nicely.  Great little place!"}
{"text":"I went here cause of the (already) good reviews and the people are right on. As soon as I took my first bite, it took me straight back to the hotdogs in mexico. The bread is so tasty and sweet. I wish I did not leave so far or else I'd become a regular. The owners are very kind."}
{"text":"If you like Sonoran dogs this is the place. Really good, fresh food plus friendly people. Great, great value for the money. I told the lady at the counter that I was going to give her a 4-star review. The only reason it isn't a 5-star is that it wasn't free! LOL."}
{"text":"One of my favorite hotdogs. I look forward to going to this place. Every time I'm out this way. Owner seems a little grouchy but food makes up for it"}
{"text":"Great Sonoran dogs! I haven't had one in the Phoenix area and suddenly had a craving... Mickys Hotdogs makes a hell of a Sonoran dog!"}
{"text":"The food is extremely good!!!! I love it and I can't ever get enough of them! The hotdogs are cheap as well! Only reason why I won't give this place the entire 5 stars is because of how bad their customer service is. They're terrible. They have no manners. They always look at you like you're a dumb ass or something. They only accept cash & they don't seem to be able to be organized when they get busy. I recommend it but be prepared for their ugly customer service."}
{"text":"I am NOT  EVEN a hot dog fan but this is no ordinary dog . Wrapped in Bacon you say  ! Mmmmmmm. Being back on the east coast it would be worth a trip back to AZ for one of these great dogs . Not a fancy place but WHO CARES ! This place was fantastic all the trimmings you can ever imagine & the service was superb ....love this place ."}
{"text":"Muy delicioso. Very friendly staff. The hot dog loaded it perfect and has the best off the grill flavor. The bacon adds just the right amount of crunch. 
The pintos are just like my dad makes. And the onions, tomatoes and crema are all fresh. 

The space is a tad on the small size and they're open at 11am not 9am as yelp states. Once you get inside, they're absolutely fantastic. Seating inside is obviously limited so plan ahead of you have many people on your party."}
{"text":"Very good Sonoran hotdog and good service. Just make sure to order the dog inside then tell the guy outside what you want. Was confusing for a first time visitor."}
{"text":"Terrible service, would attempt to order and nothing would happen very rude terrible customer service. And it was only cash only. Never going back."}
{"text":"I think I've been spoiled with LA hot dogs.  The ones outside the clubs late night because when I ate Mickey's I was not impressed.  The tacos, however, were really good!  They have cabeza which a lot of places don't serve.  I would come back for my taco cravings!"}
{"text":"Decent dog. Rolls were nicely steamed and they have a decent mayo topping. Good hangover food."}
{"text":"The menu doesn't tell you what's on their dog so we got our with everything.  From what I can tell it was bean, cheese and perhaps sautéed onions. The bun was soft and delicious.  Great dogs."}
{"text":"Love this place. Hot dogs and burritos are delicious. Hot dogs are their specialty though. The hot dog bread is warm and soft, and all of the ingredients on the bacon wrapped hot dog mesh very well together. The food is prepared after you order so don't expect it to be ready as fast as the typical fast food joint."}
{"text":"I was just saying the other day that
I want a legit Sonoran Dog, and glad I found a spot that serves them up. 

Now I'm no math major but 2.50 for a delicious loaded Sonoran Dog=great deal"}
{"text":"Best Sonoran hot dogs! Friendly staff and small quaint atmosphere... And they are open late!"}
{"text":"The Sonora hot dogs were delicious! We also tried their salchi papas, but they weren't our favorite. For some reason the salchicha was way too salty."}
{"text":"To start this place is in a sketchy neighborhood and only accepts cash. That said it looks a little run down when you walk in but the did just score an A on a health inspection in August. 
The caramelo was mediocre - it needs more cheese and to be crisper. The tacos are boring! The carne adasada was ok flavor wise but a little dry. The Sonoran dogs- not the best in the state (head to Tucson for that) but for sure the best I have had in the Phoenix area. 
The service was a little slow (about 15-20 minute wait) and since I don't speak Spanish there was limited interaction. 
At the end of it I say go but just got the hot dogs!"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here & all I can say is that the hotdogs are the bomb! It's a small joint, but worth the $$$."}
{"text":"I probably should have given this Sonoran hot dog 5-stars because it tasted awesome but since this was my first Sonoran hot dog(I have been searching for one) I didn't have anything to compare it to. The restaurant was clean and the staff was friendly. 
Easy access to I-60 which made it very convenient since I was just traveling through the area and stopped only because I had seen the reviews on Yelp."}
{"text":"Love, LOVE their Sonoran style hot dogs...they are LEGIT! Best ones this side of the border!! And the salchi papas are pure comfort food. Carne Asada tacos are just like street tacos in Rocky Point.  This place is a gem and I will definitely be coming back often!"}
{"text":"So first cash only peeps. Come prepared. So we walk in the cashier was chopping on something that looked good but wasn't offered on the menu. Since this was our first time here we didn't know how to order, so we studied the menu and while waiting to take our order she looked like she was gonna kill us if we wasted her time. So we took a chance ordered \"a hotdog\" we asked what was in it. She said \"well you know like with bacon wrapped and blah blah blah. How the Sonorans do it\" ummm I was born in Culver City California, not Sonora. Anyhow, we took the chance and it was frickin great! We ordered 3. That's how good it was!!! Afterwards we left a tip before leaving. She said \"Gracias\" we said \"you're welcome\" lol try it out!"}
{"text":"\"Give me some head please.\" I requested politely.

Wait, what? 

Clearly I'm talking about cabeza tacos. Gosh, you Yelpers are perverts! 

So we came here today for the Sonoran Dog but got a bunch of other stuff on the side just to try everything. We'll get back to the hot dogs in a second but to put it short for their tacos and burrito, it was okay. The cabeza tacos ($1.75ea) were greasy, the al pastor tacos ($1.75ea) were better and had good flavor, and the carne asada burrito ($6.00) was basic and on the smaller side given the price point. The real star is the $3.00 Sonoran dog.

I actually have a different place I go to that charges $3.09 for each dog and I thought they served the best Sonoran dog. I even went back to my old place the same day to try it side by side and the difference was startling. After coming here, I gotta transfer the crown to Micky's. Micky's does it right! Sweet fluffy roll, thick charred wiener (that's what she said), and a heaping of toppings. Top it with their avocado crema and it's bliss! $15.50 for two Sonoran dogs, two tacos, and a burrito.

I wouldn't come here for anything besides the Sonoran dog. Micky's is located in the industrial area of Mesa.  Cash only, seating is limited, and don't forget to visit the salsa bar!"}
{"text":"Micky's better get used to seeing our faces! These Sonoran style dogs are very good and they use a good quality dog to boot. They use fresh Mexican style sweet buns, so they know what they are doing! We also tried the pastor taco and the carne asada taco. They are tiny...so order more than one! You will be left wanting if you are hungry. Yum! The pastor had just the right amount of spice and the carne asada was super tender. The salsas are fresh and flavorful. Service was great! They do not open until 11 am..."}
{"text":"Very small burrito not worth the 6$ maybe 2$ tops, greasy very greasy take extra napkins, Morenos up the street is way better"}
{"text":"Tasteless hotdogs,  roasted til it and the bacon around it shriveled. Mushy,  tasteless bun. $3 Birria taco the size of a small man's palm with about 1 tablespoon of meat in it. $1.75  Summary,  don't go to the Mesa stand."}
{"text":"Took my husband to enjoy his first Sonoran hot dog, and they did not disappoint!! The food was delicious, and the service was quick! Affordable prices, we weren't aware it was cash only prior to going, so we only had a 20. We got there hungry and left stuffed with cash to spare."}
