{"text":"I came in, was promptly greeted by the server who gave us the specials, and offered coffee.  I got a warm enough cup of coffee right away with 2 glasses of water and cutlery all in one efficient swoop.
We looked at the menu for a minute or two and I was unable to decide between the BAM! and The Roasted RED, because they both looked delicious.  I was going to ask the server when she came over.
There were about 5 tables of people in the restaurant not including us.  She took an order, and someone paid their bill, and then she puttered around the bar area while we stared her down from about 15 feet away.  She made brief eye contact twice, and then went out back to the kitchen, and then came back to the bar and puttered around some more.
After close to 20 minutes of talking amongst ourselves while staring at her to get her attention, we got bored and left."}
{"text":"I'm usually a regular at Mitzi's just down the street so I really didn't know what to expect when walking through the door at Poor John's. I felt relaxed and comfortable immediately! Retro and comfy seating, kinda small space but was fine. It's a great spot on a lazy weekend or after a night of drinking. I had the Indian Roti - which isn't at all what you are probably thinking. It was SO HEALTHY!! A whole wheat tortilla with a thin layer of egg and spices, an amazing spicy chutney, a yogurt dip and spicy potatoes. The portion wasn't too big or too small. It was just perfect. I can't wait to go back and try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"Really loved eating here. I had the red pepper sandwich. (Artichokes, Red Peppers, Portabello Mushrooms, Feta Cheese and a Chipotle Mayo on a toasted onion bun) With choice of potatoes, salad or soup of the day. I chose potatoes... they were seasoned perfectly and the entire meal was like a party in my mouth. Atmosphere was very warm and inviting even on a rainy spring afternoon. Would go back and WILL go back, very soon."}
{"text":"Certainly wasn't the mind-blowing experienced I'd hoped. I got what the waitress recommended and I found it bland...even though it was the \"spiciest\" thing on the menu. It also didn't feel that it was great value.

I wouldn't go give this place another shot since it is very, very near Mitsy's and Easy, which are far better option in my opinion."}
{"text":"I was excited to try the place after strolling by on numerous occasions. The rustic wood store front, and the people, cozy inside drew me in. I also read reviews that talked about the inexpensive sandwiches and the ideology behind the shop. 

I have to say I was terribly disappointed. I felt like I had walked into a public housing or community centre - people who did not appear to be patrons were lounging around. I know it's their neighbourhood (as it is mine), it was just a bit surprising given my earlier impression. Service was extremely slow - it was about 15 minutes before we were greeted and another 15 minutes before the server came to take our order (..and perhaps ANOTHER 20 minutes until our food came). 

While the sandwiches sounded interesting, I went for a good old tuna wrap. The wrap was very small and presented casually (not unlike getting a sandwich at Morning Glory). The tuna was very dense and mixed with just mayonnaise, as far as I could tell. No signs of onion, celery, apple, mustard... or anything that would make this sandwich more than ordinary. Frankly, it was difficult to eat because it was bland and dense. Further, prices were substantially higher than the earlier reviews I had read. 

One good thing was that they had a red velvet cake on a display and a nice sized portion cost $3 - better value than any red velvet cupcake you'll find in the city. 

I don't think I'll be making another stop here. It's too bad because we could use a few gems in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Welcoming, bright and relaxing! I often get my morning cup of coffee here. i love it! And if you are a fan of coffee, sandwich and a good time, this is the place!!

Don't forget to check the patio!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here numerous times and have never been sorry that we took the long walk from our place in upper Roncesvalles to Parkdale. You might just think this is another breakfast/lunch/sandwich place but you would be wrong! Everything is so yummy and made so well by their awesome chef. Great value for seriously delicious food. The smoked salmon sandwich is what I usually get but I have had the roasted red several times (so good) and the breakfasts are yummy! The servers are fantastic too. I'd eat lunch here every day if I could. Check it out."}
{"text":"Best brunch joint I've ever had the pleasure of reading the weekend papers in. Decor looks like all the furniture in you're aunt's garage--none of it matches but it's all v comfy. The staff looked like they were wearing the clothes they'd slept in, made me feel a little over dressed. But don't be fooled by the slacker vibe; these people know how to make and present their meals. And when was the last time you were offered a goat curry for brunch? I didn't order it but it was good to know it was there. And guess what? The coffee's good."}
{"text":"The food here is tasty but the experience is ruined by a lack of staff and kitchen capacity.  Expect to wait an hour for you food and rarely see your server. The back patio filled with people smoking illegally ( under an pergola ).   I'd avoid until they get these issues sorted out..."}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee!
Friendly staff.
Yummy sandwiches and baked goods- mmm croissants!.

I like the cute back patio too"}
{"text":"I love this place and their coffee.  I especially love the way they make their Chai Latte.  

There is a dude that works there who makes 'em for me and he uses soy milk and sweetens it with honey for me.
I'll have to ask his name next time.

I have never eaten there, but every time I go in, the food smells amazing. I will one day try every sandwich on the menu. 

The interior is rustic, with just a few tables. You can chill by the big window at the front or nestle in the back at two seater table. 

This is my go-to place on Sat and Sun AM's when I want to go for a quick walk for a coffee.

Definitely check this little place out... simple and local - a true Parkdale classic."}
{"text":"VIBE. Sharp looking but down to earth. Attractive space is warm, hip with a lower-case h, not trying very hard. Great. We sat in the back patio; about ten tables on gravel, hemmed in by an attractive wood fence, a little bit of plant life and adorned with a bright red pergola. 

SERVICE was bad; all of our drink orders were wrong in one way or another. First server was inept but sweet as pie, and I think she may have just been overloaded. I wanted to hug her. I like her. The server that took over was unhelpful and kind of rude. 

COFFEE was bland but I think that's because we may have gotten decaf by mistake.

FOOD was really, really good. I got the:

SPECIAL BENNY - poached eggs and a thin slice of smoked pork perched on delicious muesli toast  with to-die-for dill hollandaise. Perfect. Served with a tasty side of balsamic greens salad and... 

...THE BEST BREAKFAST POTATOES I HAVE EVER HAD. They were soft but firm with just barely crispy edges and well seasoned with something chili-like but not quite spicy. Like, omg. So so good.

TIP: They have $5 caesars here. I cannot comment on how good they are because I foolishly did not order one."}
{"text":"Since my days are more open now (thank you, recession!), I like to take long walks, exploring various neighbourhoods which by the end of my journey, find a place to put my feet up. One such neighbourhood is Parkdale, and my quest to find the perfect place to enjoy a decent affordable meal, sit in peace (or away from screaming children that frequent places during the lunch hour - sorry parents!) and not feel rushed to leave before I digest my meal. Poor John's Cafe is my go-to place for all of the above. 

The food is quite tasty, fresh with decent sized portions, and I'll have to agree with Tony in the previous review, the coffee is good as well. For the next little while, they have special Recession Mondays menu where you can enjoy certain meal for a cheap price. I had a sandwich, salad and a coffee for less than $10. 

Be sure to save up a little bit for their Foodie Fridays. They did have them a year ago but again with the recession and all, they might not offer this on a regular basis. If they do, reserve a seat with a friend or two and be prepared to enjoy a fantastic multi-course meal (it might be 4 or 5 course). They price it at $75 per person but the high price is worth it if you want to enjoy a nice dinner in an unpretentious environment."}
