{"text":"Been 3 times.  Mainly we live close by.  They have some nice dishes...the \"carryover\" Italian items a few are quite good imo.  I tried a steak and also good.  Last night I ordered halibut at \"market price\"... figured it would be on the pricey side but wanted to give it a shot.  I guess I should have asked on price.  Anyway 38.75.  So at 38.75 I'm now expecting it better be \"good\".  Anyway....small portion, probably calling it skimpy would not be unfair.  Overcooked and dried out.  So....a mistake.   Ordered a Ketel One, soda.  Reg. not tall.  $9.75.  Not a very heavy pour. Anyway....I'll keep going... not quitting but will be looking for way more value than this. Waitress was nice and polite but pretty green. Definite rookie."}
{"text":"Marshall's Fine Dining is an excellent option for Moon Valley. They are attentive and thoughtful. Sam and Judy rock happy hour. Outdoor seating and great prices are a big draw. Check out the meatball sliders for an appetizer!"}
{"text":"Great food last night.  We had Chicken Parmesan & Salmon Picatta!  Lovely wine, the girls had cannolis for dessert,  & Dad had coffee - black. The sign says Fine Dining, and it's the truth. If you haven't been in, I strongly recommend that you experience this restaurant & bar."}
{"text":"Third time at Marshalls for happy and dinner. All three time I have loved the staff and enjoyed sitting at the bar with all the wonderful company. The bartender Robert is prompt with drinks and very friendly. The happy hour menu is vast and cocktails start off at $ 4.00. The prime rib, ribeye, chicken and pasta dishes are to die for.. The bread and salads are very good the best are the desserts.  So happy we have a new place in Moon Valley.   Thank you Marshalls for wonderful evenings"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely the best steak I've had in a long time it started with a margarita which tasted great but the steak was even better it was probably one of the juiciest steaks I've had in a long time keep up the good workSam was a great server and  took very good care of me by the way John Marshall the owner was one of the funniest most charismatic owners I met a long time great job Marshall's I would recommend to  anyone"}
{"text":"Ate there with a large group. Most of us waited an hour and a half for entrees to be served-some waited more than 2 hours.  The owner was on the premises. After about an hour I asked him when the entrees would be out. He said he'd check in the kitchen and let me know. He then went in the kitchen and never came back out ."}
{"text":"Valentine's Day Special!  We walk in.  Are given a rose, a glass of champagne.  Red mylar balloons decorate the room.  A live jazz trio playing in the back.  What more can you ask for? A LOT!!!  It was all downhill from there.  This establishment used to be Salute's.  An old standby for good, solid Italian food.  We were hoping it to be as good or even better.  The first change we notice is an obtrusive brick wall that separates the bar (which has a really good happy hour menu) from the rest of the establishment.  Our table backed up to this wall which was confining so we pushed our table away to give us space.  Our server was awkward, nervous (she asked if we wanted to glass of coffee).  Eventually we received a basket of garlic bread that smelled delectable.  Did I say bread?  I should have said garlic crust.  No chewy bread to be found.  Then came the salad.  A large plate of lettuce with one slice of tomato.  The dressing was tasty but at least add a crouton, olive. something else besides lettuce!  Then came our \"special\".  Filet Mignon (which was tasty) and a slice of halibut, a \"loaded\" baked potato (which to them meant a side of sour cream) and a few asparagus spears with a drizzle of hollandiase.  I kept thinking my parents would have loved this dinner.  A nice piece of fish with a nice piece of meat.  And actually looking around the room, most of the people there were of my parent's generation.  But in this day and age, there is just so much more you can do with a nice piece of fish.  Dress it up with something!  The dessert appeared with no explanation (it was part of the special).  It was OK.    I am willing to give this another chance.  I would order something Italian, as much of the menu on the Italian dishes section looks the same as Salute's.  That's what they were known for.  Maybe that's what they should stick to."}
{"text":"First time here and what a nice surprise.  Got here in time for happy hour appetizers.  Shrimp cocktail, enough for 2 and less then 10 dollars. Garlic bread was a lovely touch and tasted like the kind I used to get in Brooklyn.  Everything was served with a delicious fresh salad.   Mains were yummy...I had veal caprese and Mark had an 8ounce fillet Oscar. Both were excellent.  Server was attentive and took care of all our needs. We'll definitely be back for more of their Italian menu."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in Moon Valley. Finally there is a good quality Italian food place to eat at over here. I ordered the filet and it was top notch. I met the owner and he really cares about his customers and makes sure each plate is the absolute best."}
{"text":"This is a classy up scale restaurant tailored to an older crowd.  I came here for a business meeting during the week and really enjoyed the food, scenery and ambiance.   My server (sam) took care of me and had good recommendations. There are daily specials to choose from too.   Started off with the 'marshall special' which is an appetizer with shrimp calamari and meatballs (delicious!).  All meals come with a basket of bread i believe. Buttered and seasoned good.   I had a 6oz fillet minion. Come with 2 sides. Got loaded baked potato and asparagus. Im not a big fan of asparagus but this was the best asparagus I've ever had!   Definitely enjoyed the service and food and i highly recommend this place to everyone.   Its \"fine dinning\" so expect to pay for your meal but its worth it."}
{"text":"Stopped by with a pal and had an early dinner.   Sam was our waiter and excellent service.  I had the Imperial Crab dish which was so yummy I cannot describe...it was $20.   Ordered a side of the gorgonzola salad and it was just ok.  My friend had the Chicken Parmesan and thought it to be ok.  Brought a meatloaf meal back home to hubby and he liked it.  For me the portions are just right.  But I must say that for some, especially hearty eaters,  they will consider them scanty.  The only reason for four instead of five is the review from my friend on her meal and my spouse thought it could have been more.  As for me, personally, I will definitely be returning with or without hubby to experience another tasty dish."}
{"text":"We were regulars of the previous restaurant that occupied this space but stopped going when the quality and service took a dive.  We were excited to hear that someone had stepped in and took over.  We went for dinner and saw that the name had changed and the interior had been tastefully updated from the 80's colors and confused decor to more modern classy vibe.  The white table cloths were a nice touch along with the classical music playing in the background.  The service was top notch, very attentive, well trained and polite and we found a new and updated menu along with the other much needed changes.  My daughter had the house made lasagna, and referred to it as the \"bomb.com\".  My wife and oldest daughter both ordered the sea bass which was seasoned and cooked perfectly, a nice surprise as I often find seafood overcooked.  I had the Filet Oscar which rivaled the filet I had at Durant's the night before while out with friends.  Try Mac n cheese which my daughter ordered as a side, but could easily be a stand out on it's own merits.  Great experience, great food and we were told that the owner has more updates and upgrades planned for the space.  We will definitely be regulars again at this location."}
{"text":"Stopped by for a happy hour drink and we were immediately happy to see the wall between the bar and the dining room. I never like having diners sitting near the bar.  Love the separation of the two spaces.  Bartender Judy was wonderful!  Comfortably chatted with us while we had some good drinks. We had a couple apps that were very nice and she shared info about St. Pats Day activities and the bourbon soaked corned beef that will be served. We can't wait to go back!"}
