{"text":"First ignore all the reviews prior to 2013 (St. Patrick's Day) This is a new casual wonderful bargain spot with excellent burgers, flat bread and calamari. The redecorated interior is chic and the staff very pleasant. We think you will really like this spot. Happy hour prices are ridiculously inexpensive. There is no excuse not to go out!"}
{"text":"I have been away from West Park for several years and it was so nice to see the Red Lanterm with a new look and feel. The food was very good - good portions and priced fairly. Service is excellent.  If you haven't been there In awhile, check it out.  Sunday's brunch menu, with the Bloody Mary bar hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Red Lantern is not closed!! New management, new look, upscale gastro pub.

Nice selection of appetizers, sandwiches, pub food and salads. 

Bacon brussel sprouts, in lieu of chips with my Rueben, were delicious.  Rueben was good served on a mixed rye bread.  Only downside was it could have been a little hotter when brought to the table.  

Calamari on lettuce appetizer was tasty with a mayo type dipping sauce.

Nice selection of beers including Angry Orchard on tap."}
{"text":"I meant to come here on my last wedding anniversary, but didn't. This year, other plans fell through and we ended up here somehow. I thought it was a darkly lit, pubby yet sort of upscale hole in the wall. It turned out to be a run of the mill family restaurant with a bar in it. Quaint, cheap furnishings with the ballgame on tv and Keno being played. I thought maybe they had Super Nintendo while you wait for food, but it was the Ohio lottery's latest family destroyer that was flickering and threatening to give patrons seizures.

Anyhow, the food: I had the perch dinner with cole slaw and fries. They offered more classy fair like crab stuffed tilapia or lemon pepper roughie. But i'm a novice fish eater and like to keep it simple. Fish was flaky, but breading was bland. Slaw was okay and fries were thickly cut. My wife had the veggie burger and onion rings(we're not Three Birds anniversary kind of people, we're poor). The spinach dip appetizer was tasty, but runny. Service was attentive(place was pretty empty) and pleasant. All in all, a visit to Long John's and BK with a stop at a bar would have been more fun and less money. Live and learn. 

I'm just in a bad mood. It has been raining all October. This is the time of year i hike through crunchy leaves, not trudge through wet compost. I got spoiled with a cool summer and laughing at angry summer people who felt their favorite time of year sucked. Karma is a soggy, wet kick in the buckeyes."}

Latest Update 2-13-13.  
CLOSED ! ---and right before LENT ! 

--- when their business could have benefited greatly from orders of their fabulous fish fries served regularly---EVERY DAY---not just on Fridays.  Not enough advertising?  I don't know.  Not enough favorable reviews?  Could be.  Loyal customers loved it.  First-timers would have too, if they had only given Red Lantern a chance.  Hopefully, this closure is temporary.

This LOCALLY-OWNED business, in operation for over THREE DECADES---that offered EXCELLENT Lake Erie Perch fish fries at fair, affordable pricing, with friendly, efficient, welcoming service, didn't deserve fighting a likely unfair battle to keep things going.  I just recently heard they weren't doing well.  That's hard to imagine, based on our perfectly satisfying experiences and especially particular palates.  I also heard that they wanted to sell.   May be.  Whatever the reason, I know it wasn't the fried perch or the service.  A real shame and a real loss for Kamm's Corners.  I'm crossing my fingers and hoping the O' Malleys will open again soon.  When they do---I'm going to think positive---do yourself a favor and order their fried Lake Erie perch dinner.   Other restaurants can take all the components---from perch to mayo---and not come close.  We've sampled dozens of spots over the years, and never found one better than Red Lantern.

.             LUSCIOUS LAKE ERIE PERCH
To the tune of \"California Girls\" by the Beach Boys

      Well, East Coast states have oysters,
      A mere dozen just won't do.
      And Louisiana has those tender shrimp---
      For them all, a seafood coup.

      The King Crab rules Alaska,
      And their salmon is the best,
      While the lobster reigns off those Boston shores,
      It's with clams, New England's blessed.

      The West Coast has their tuna,
      In the Keys, stone crab's their pride,
      And those mahi-mahi swimming round Hawaii,
      But for fresh, you must reside.

          I wish they all could taste what we have here,
          I wish they all could taste what we have here,
          I wish they all could taste our Lake Erie Perch.

      I've been all around tasting seafood,
      But for me, just can't compare,
      Ohio's sweet luscious flaky Lake Erie Perch
      Next to anything, anywhere.

The last 2 visits here were both FABULOUS 5 stars.  Have yet to try other menu items and unlikely that we will, since the FRIED LAKE ERIE PERCH is perfect.  The entire spread that Red Lantern at Kamm's Corners serves up---from perch to fries to coleslaw to tartar sauce---has earned MY personal Recognition of Excellence.  HeHe.

{"text":"Great little family place.  Almost like stepping into a time machine.  The service was fantastic, we had a super friendly silver haired waitress who reminded me of the sweet  grandmother of movies from a period long ago.  We ordered the perch fish fry and it was the best lake erie perch we ever ate!

HIGHLY recommended!"}
