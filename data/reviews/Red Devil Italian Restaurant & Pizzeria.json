{"text":"Poor service.  Packed 3 family's together although there's many open tables. My family of four was placed in a booth that was to small I would have been happier at Chuck E Cheese"}
{"text":"The pizza was gross in my opinion. We ordered 2 16in cheese pizzas for carry out at the pick up window. After standing there for a good 8 or 9 mins someone acknowledged us. The pizza was just not good. Nothing about it was appetizing. The middle was soggy and the crust was soo crisp and crunchy it was inedible. My kids didn't even  like it. The sauce was pastey and tasted off. It was overall just bad. We had a whole pie left over from 6 people. The pizza was even worse the next day, and we love cold left over pizza. We ended up just throwing it out. Won't be back to this pizza joint."}
{"text":"I  have always enjoyed this restaurant.  Tonight I enjoyed the sausage and peppers with fettuccine. Spicy but not hot.  Large portion smothered in sauce.  Service was solid as always  my only issue is with the dinner salad having large pieces of lettuce, making it awkward at times to eat it.  Otherwise another enjoyable meal."}
{"text":"After having the personal sized cheese piza I was very pleased with the composition of the sauce and cheese blend. The flavor of the herbs and spices were very pleasing to my pallet.  To top off the meal I ended with a dessert sampler platter which was an exquisite variety of fresh baked cookies including cheese cake. Because of the ample meal I took most of the cookies home for a snack later. This location is also family friendly and my server was very attentive and accommodating."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in years and I am a little disenchanted with the service.  I know not to get upset cause the food is epic....Well, the pasta fagioli was just as remembered amazing...Pizza super epic....lasagna still rocking it.. So should have been 5 stars let's pay more attention to the customer & it will be just as I remembered"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Phoenix. If you have a chance to have Carol serve you, you will learn about more options than I ever knew existed and my family and I have eaten here for 29 years.
I bring all my friends from the Midwestern states to try this place and most want to eat here again as long as I don't go along. I guess they like the PIzza better than my company and my wife doesn't blame them!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and enjoyed the pizza and wings. There ranch dressing is very good. Also enjoyed the great customer service from the staff here at red devil"}
{"text":"My girlfried had heard from a friend that this place was great and that was exactly like New York pizza.  This pizza is not like any NY pizza that I've ever had and if it were, then NY pizza would not have the good reputation that it does.  The food was awful.  I literally had to force a second piece down my throat even though I was starving.  
The service was great, but no amount of waitstaff attention can make up for the crap coming out of the kitchen.  There are so many better pizza restaurants around that there is no need to upset your stomach at this place."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. We had called ahead  during the week to reserve tables for a big party of 25 and they said yes they would accommodate us. We get there and they don't have our tables ready instead they gave them to a party that showed up before us and said it's a first come first serve. They weren't considerate and told us we needed to wait another hour until the other party was done. They didn't accommodate us at all when we then decided to order take out they said we would need to wait another 30 minutes. We left and they lost out on money and 25 customers. We will never return again. There are better places that will treat customers with great service and Red Devil is not one!"}
{"text":"Good pizza - my daughter seemed quite pleased with her personal veggie - but I found the pasta dishes dismal. My linguine seemed to have been cooked, frozen and  then reboiled at the point of order, garlic insufficiently toasted. Yeech. I might go back for the pizza, but I'll certainly avoid the other dishes. I thought the place overpriced for what it was, too - $15-$20 entrees in a basic, unpretentious neighborhood place. Surprisingly good house cabernet sold by the carafe. Friendly if somewhat inexpert service."}
{"text":"My husband and I LOVE Red Devil. We eat Ina few times a month and order take out at least twice a week. Red Devil never fails to deliver an excellent meal. We generally eat dinner late (after 8pm) so we rarely wait for a table. Dinner hours expect a wait, but definitely well worth every minute!! The take out guys are awesome!! The entire menu is delicious! You can't go wrong with red devil. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Being from NY, I know good Italian food, and I KNOW good pizza. We've been to every pizza joint in a 30 mile radius of Tempe that had 3.8 or higher ratings.  Although we've found some good ones, we always, always, come back to Red Devil for their cheese pizza and wings.  Their Italian dishes are not what we go for, so this rating is for the pizza and wings.  Their decor is very old, tired and worn, so if that's an issue, get your pizza from the togo window!"}
{"text":"First of all, I'm a loyal RD customer.  I've been going to the Phoenix (McDowell/32nd St.) location happily since 1967!
But, last year, I lost my home in Phx, and had to move back to Tempe, my childhood home.  
And began going to the Southern/Mill location.
Generally, a consistent disappointment!
Pizzas have been 'okay', but not up to Phx standards.
Salad not near the quality of freshness and ingredients of Phx.
And the pasta w/meat sauce?
Overcooked, like we got the bottom of the kettle!  Even the garlic toast was meh!
I DO plan on going back, and hoping things improve.

It's a long drive to Phoenix for the same items!
Tempe - PLEASE up your quality!"}
{"text":"I must start by saying I only order from this place and have never sat down to eat, but I have been here several times. So if you are looking for a service review you won;t find it here, this is simply on the food itself.

I love this pizza. It is one of my favorite pizzas in town. They are not close to me but I always make the drive to get it. What I love the most about it is the crust. I am a chewy yet crispy kind or crust gal. I love the chewyness of the crust. I love to get a side of ranch and a side of the hot wing sause and dip this pizza in. Mmmmm my mouth is watering just writing this. The wings are damn good too. I always get the hot cause I like the hot ones. They are fried not baked and taste oh so good. I have also had the bbq ones and they are tasty as well."}
{"text":"Eaten dinner here 5-6 times with both small parties and large.

We were just there last night with a huge party and the service was horrible. Each course took progressively longer and then it took over 10 minutes just to get the credit cards back after paying the bill. We had to get our own to-go containers from the corner in the meantime. They weren't swamped, so not sure what the reason was.

Many other times we've had great service... guess you never know. Food is pretty good and reasonably priced, but nothing I'd write home about. I will say their homemade ranch dressing is some of the best I've ever had! Portions are relatively large too.

I won't complain eating here, but wouldn't choose it out of some other places nearby."}
{"text":"Friday night/ Pizza night wouldn't be the same without Red Devil.  We love their pizza, love their wings and love the exceptional service that we always receive.  Especially at such a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I live near here and have never gotten bad food this pizza rocks..  parking isn't great but better than downtown restaurants... marinara sauce and Caesar salads are the bomb"}
{"text":"Oh man what can I say!! This place is the bomb!! It's nothing compared to the location in the West side of town (where I live). My Bf is tired of this place since I want to come at least three times a month. Who can get tired of Red Devil's...right. The pizza has a thin delicious crispy crust and the wings (extra crispy please) are a home run. I've also tired the pasta but always come back for the pizza and wing's. Oh and yes they have Pepsi!!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in and had some salad and pizza. The thin crust was pretty g
ood, though it got a little soggy it was still tasty. The salad was OK, I wish they would include tomatoes. Overall a solidly positive experience. I would come back in the future."}
{"text":"Best place to get traditional pizza and simple Italian-American food.  Good crust, sauce, etc.  Way better than any chain.  This is not where to go for more exotic specialty/gourmet pizza, but for traditional stuff it doesn't get any better."}
{"text":"This is the best pie you can get in Tempe. Wings are good. I like the honey hot wings."}
{"text":"I live close by this location and I've been wanting to try it for the longest time so yesterday I did and it was a waste of money. I purchased the Philly Steak Sub and it was all bread, mushrooms, and green peppers, very, very little beef. My dog wouldn't even eat it, it went in the trash. I also purchased the large Antipasto Salad that smelled like it just came out of a bag from the grocery store that was loaded with chemicals, it also went in the trash, very disappointed. I should have just went to Giuseppe's on 28th, their food is always outstanding!"}
{"text":"Real, natural ingredients, veggies were crisp and fresh. Flavor of the pizza sauce and the crust was so good!!! This might be Tempe's finest. First time here, very impressed. Great service should be noted."}
{"text":"Horrible service staff is rude especially the to go staff always rude and I wouldn't order from this place horrible service everytime!"}
{"text":"Good food horrible service our waitress's was super slow and on something very not all there"}
{"text":"This place is a good fall back place for my husband and me when we really don't want to have to think about what to do for dinner. Whether it is pizza or pasta dishes, it's always good and satisfying. The wait time is usually too long even when you see a lot of empty tables, but that is my only complaint. The servers are always nice and pleasant. I've been at least a dozen times and have never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"After seeing a movie at the nearby Harkins, my family and I went there for my cousin's birthday dinner. We picked this place based on the positive online reviews. The place was unimpressive looking, but there was quite a wait which I took as a good sign (nobody lines up and waits for bad food...or at least they shouldn't). After half an hour we got seated. They placed us in what looked like an addition to the building and it was freezing! They had the A/C blasting and a ceiling fan going. Our server was very nice, and our drinks and salads came out rather quick. Then it took a turn for the worse. Well over an hour passed between receiving our drinks/salads and when our meals where finally brought out to us. During that time, none of our drinks were refilled, our used plates weren't removed, and no one came to check on us until the hour mark. When our food did come out it was nice and piping hot, but it was also unrecognizable. Every plate was drowning in marinara sauce. You had to do some serious excavating to uncover your food. And the food was pretty mad. We ordered spaghetti, eggplant parmesan, and the manicotti. Ragu tastes better than the sauce that they seemingly have an neverending supply of. And the eggplant was mushy and unflavorful. To add insult to injury, the prices were absurd! They charged prices on par with higher end Italian restaurants...yet this place is a far cry from anything upscale. Maybe this place is only good for the pizza, but based on this experience I'm not willing to give it a second chance."}
{"text":"I sat in the bar at red Devil tonight to eat and have a drink to watch the cubs game. What great service and a good time. The bartender was amazing. The food was great. A must go to place."}
{"text":"I am rating this restaurant solely on the pizza.  I like their thin, chewy crust and the sauce is very good too.  We split a caesar salad also and that was pretty good (nothing out of the ordinary).
I wish I was in their delivery area."}
{"text":"Went back for pizza a couple of weeks later and pizza was good. Fresh ingridents, mushrooms, green peppers etc......go for the pizza!
Good value fast service."}
{"text":"Great Greek Salad!  Nice server but seemed like she was the only one in the place. Poor girl. Everyone raved about the NY style wings, but I thought thy were average."}
{"text":"We used RD every week for our Football Snack Shack and exposed hundreds of people to their pizza.  What a hit.  People raved about their pizza.  Some folks asked who we sold before purchasing and were quite excited when we told them it was Red Devil.  Their day Manager Danny, provided great customer service to our bulk orders and accommodated our special requests for smoother operations."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this place for the passed 4 years. I would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza. It is a nice bar/ restaurant to watch sports in."}
{"text":"This is a review I forgot to do after our trip to Phoenix for Thanksgiving.  A discussion with a friend the other day reminded me I needed to write about this place.

While out shopping with my parents the day before Thanksgiving, they suggested hitting Red Devil for lunch.  Being happy that they didn't try to suggest one of the big chain places they tend to frequent, we bought in.  From the very dated and drab outside appearance, I was worried.  When we walked inside and I saw the decor that clearly hadn't been updated in about 30 years, I was even more worried.  First impressions are important, and if I was reviewing this place on its appearance and decor alone, it would be two stars at best.

Fortunately, appearance isn't everything.  There is a reason this place is still around: the food is great.  The calzone I had was massive, far too much for one reasonable person to eat.  It was delicious, the bread was soft and perfectly cooked, and the ingredients (spinach, artichoke, sausage and of course, cheese) were plentiful and flavorful.  The antipasto salad my parents and fiancee shared was large enough to feed a small village in the Dolomites.  Food portions are not lacking, and food quality is excellent.

I love wings, almost to a fault.  I want to order them any time they're on a menu, but I show restraint sometimes.  On this day, I did not.  I ordered the wings.  My fiancee asked \"You're ordering wings at an Italian restaurant\", to which I replied with a hint of indignation \"Uh, yeah.\"  I am glad I did.  And so was she.  The wings were incredible.  Seriously some of the best wings I've had in a very long time.  They were decent sized, perfectly cooked, and evenly coated in some of the most balanced wing sauce I can remember having.  A straightforward buffalo sauce, they were a little spicy, just enough kick to compliment the explosion of flavor.  I was shocked by how good they were.  My taste buds were pleased throughout the meal.  

Basically, this place gets four stars because of the food.  The service was decent, but not great.  The ambiance and decor was so dated that I felt out of place because I was not wearing stonewashed jeans and a Hypercolor shirt.  The prices were reasonable enough considering the portion sizes.  But the food quality...all win."}
{"text":"My family has been coming to this Red Devil since I was 4 years old, and now over 21 years later, it is still where we come for any family function, where many boyfriends have met my parents, countless birthday meals, or sometimes just to watch a game in the bar section. The pizza and it's crust is unlike anywhere else's, the minestrone and rolls are far above most italian places. And if you need a new desert to try, their house-made Spumoni is the greatest. what keeps us coming back at least once or twice a week for over 20 years has just as much to so with the food as it does with the service. With the warm, family vibe that takes over once you're inside, a manager who is always walking around, talking to tables, asking how their meal was, and a service staff that takes great care of each customer, you are left with a flawless dining experience. Oh, and did I mention that it is the BEST leftover pizza to eat the next day too?!"}
{"text":"I usually throw away those value pack coupon envelopes you get in the mail, but decided to look at them this time & see if I'd use any. I pulled out ones for the dry cleaners, zoo, a burger/hot dog joint & Red Devil. 

Most of them were for dine in only but a couple were for delivery as well, so I used the one that was for a 16\" cheese (toppings were an additional $1.25 each) & 20 wings for $21.95. I had looked at their website before ordering & the combo (pepperoni, sausage, onions, mushrooms & green peppers-but we skipped the onions) sounded delish so we got that with the NY mild wings. They don't have their desserts listed on their website so I asked the guy who placed our order & decided on the cannolis (1 for me, 1 for hubs). He said it would be a lil over an hour & to my surprise it arrived in 45 minutes.

The pizza was good, not Mamma Mia's good, but good! The wings were bomb; crispy, the right amount of sauce & they smelled amazing! The cannolis were pretty good but we didn't really prefer their \"style\". Instead of chocolate chips inside with the filling, the entire cannoli was dipped in chocolate. 

Total with coupon, $3 delivery fee & tip was $47. Not bad at all considering we will each be getting 2 or more meals out of it. We're fans & would definitely order from them again...maybe even dine in eventually!"}
{"text":"They told me that my Visa gift card didn't have the full balance on it (despite me checking it prior to my visit), and they refused to take off any more than a seemingly arbitrary amount that they claimed maxed out the card. The next day, I checked the balance and, sure enough, they were lying, and there was more money left on it. I sure hope it was worth the few bucks that they refused to credit me because my family will never eat there again as a result (and we eat a LOT of pizza)."}
{"text":"I'm one of those people who remember going here as a child. Haven't been for many many years. Went for lunch yesterday to the Tempe location. Should have had the pizza I guess but the pasta caught our eye so I had the lasagna and my mom had the chicken parmagiana. AWFUL!!  The sauce tasted like it was tomato paste straight out of a can. There was very little mozzarella or ricotta cheese in my lasagna.  My sister had tortellini Alfredo and although the sauce was watery she liked it.  I would only go back to maybe try the pizza but it's unlikely. There are too many good Italian/pizza places nearer to my home."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place since I was in Kindergarten. The thing I like most about this place is you can see the pizza being made right in front of you. Outside of the restaurant they toss up the dough, work those arms, place the pizza sauce and toppings and place it in the oven. As a child this was my favorite part about coming to the restaurant. I could sit there all day and night watching them make pizzas. Now as an adult, I bring my children here because this place is a special place where I shared many childhood memories with my father. My kids love their pizza and wings. Although I have only ordered two other different things on the menu ever, I stay traditional with the pizza and wings. 

Their food is your average, nothing short of your neighborhood Italian restaurant. They could use a remodel inside. Service is always with a smile and food comes to your table in a timely manner. If you are visiting this place on a Friday or Saturday evening, you may need to bring a couple of extra minutes with you for the wait time. My children and I continue to make happy memories here and I hope they continue to do the same when they have their children."}
{"text":"Phenomenal, delicious and quick. LOVE IT. Don't have patience for any other pizza joint anymore not when I found a slice of heaven"}
{"text":"I just experienced the food from this place for the first time. We did take-out and I really enjoyed it.  We ordered the Mediterranean pizza and wings. The wings were great. The pizza was great as well except their was quite a bit of mozerella cheese and I almost choked 2x's trying to swallow the chunk of cheese. This wouldn't discourage me from eating it again, I just might request little cheese next time!"}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with red Devil been eating there for over 30 years this restaurant is just an extension of the original McDonald 32nd St. you'll love it and the prices are reasonable.

The pizza crust is in a class by itself."}
{"text":"We had a great chicken wing pizza per the recommendation of the waitress. It was very good with plenty of toppings, and cooked to perfection. The service was very good from the wait staff. There is a hostess station in the front. But, for some reason it was empty? Other than that, excellent food and great service. Very clean as well."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza, regardless of the toppings. Wings are good, with a variety of sauces to choose from."}
{"text":"Love this little place. Food was great and prices are good. Although its a little dingy it seems like a place where they have \"regulars\". Our waitress was extremely nice too. Would definitely come back. Chicken parmesan was great and the mediterrean pizza even better. Very quick service and portions are huge!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today for lunch. Sat at the bar and shared an excellent white pizza with garlic and pepperoni. The service was timely and we thoroughly enjoyed our lunch. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Best pizza and wings in Phoenix. Been coming here for years and have never been disapointed."}
{"text":"Management is incompetent. The place is full of old people and the furniture looks like its from the 1970's. 

My pizza was soggy. It did have a lot of toppings on it which I liked. The beer is dirt cheap. If you like cheap soggy pizza and you're with your grandpa I might recommend this place."}
{"text":"This is the best crust ever and the pizza is just delicious.  This is clearly one of the best Italian places in the Metro Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Had dinner yesterday with family 
you walk in and get greeted by the host very friendly. We had boneless chicken wings loaded fries and couple of drinks.everything good and tasty. Our server was very good and kept checking on how we were doing. We will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Best Pie in TOWN!!!

If you are looking for the best pie in town, I would recommend this place. Consistently the best pizza I have EVER eaten, and have been here since I was a toddler! The staff at the bar is EXCELLENT - they are so friendly, nice, and professional. Great drink deals, fresh ingredients, and I haven't tried them but I have heard their meatballs are something to write home about :). Awesome establishment."}
{"text":"I decided to give them another chance since the last time I went the order was wrong wings were cold and the pizza was burnt. I called today and asked for the specials the guy seemed like we were bothering him. My bf told him He would call back (I had to find my debit card) mid sentence the guy hung up on us. That was enough for me to change my mind as the service there before was really bad already. The time we went the girl wouldn't refill drinks, she would go text in the kitchen and joke around with the other workers.We sat there with our cold wings waiting on her so we could tell her about our food. She came back with the same wings. We knew because they had given us two orders of spicy instead of one spicy and one barbecue. No thanks I'll just call Venezia's."}
{"text":"The wings were great! This is my 3rd time out for wings in the last few weeks and each time I was given dry wings with no sauce but not today, THIRD TIME IS A CHARM! 
The hot wings were hot but with great flavor and lots of sauce, just the way they should be.
The pizza was very good as well. I had a cannoli as well which I was less impressed with. It was a chocolate cannoli and not a traditional cannoli which was not as good as I had hoped. I would go back but no cannoli."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service!

You can tell that the people cooking also eat here, they cooked it like I would if I as cooking me and my family!"}
{"text":"We never had Red Devil pizza because we thought they didn't deliver, but THEY DO! So we tried them today. We got the same pizza we eat everywhere, which is sausage and pineapple. Let me tell you, we are in LOVE! Hands down, the best pizza yet! We will order there from now on"}
{"text":"BEST STAFF AND SERVICE EVER!

Best wings in the valley and the service was EXCELLENT!

I noticed the waitress was like 4/5 months pregz, and was still WORKING so naturally i had to tip 50%...

and you should too!

srsly"}
{"text":"Update-  I recevied an e-mail on Saturday morning from Joe Ansara, one of the owners of this location.  His apology was sincere and he offered a FREE pizza on my next visit.  This was a much more appropriate response to the problem, and even though I did not enjoy these pizza toppings, I was able to share it with other employees who appreciated sausage.  Still my go to take out pizza place!  Back to 4 stars (really, who has had the perfect pizza?)."}
{"text":"Great local restaurant! Friendly staff, great customer service and the manager Kathy is wonderful! But most of all they have some of the best pizza I have ever had. After 20 yrs finally found a great pizza place and every time we eat here and take my mom she says it's the best lasagna she has ever had. The baked penne and spinach dip are great too!"}
{"text":"Super nice staff, super delicious food!  My favorite is their pizza. The sauce and cheese are so good and taste so organic and natural. Meatballs are superb. You can get that as a pizza topping as well. Children's menu is good and fan favorites of my own kids. Highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I will make this quick. My BFF and I went here, because she usually gets the delivery at her work, and loves it. I am not sure which location her office uses, and I have been to the one on bell ave, and it was alright, but this place...

We had a half pepperoni, half veggie. The crust was burnt almost to black in a lot of places. The pepperoni side had a river of grease, and the veggie side had a river of soggy water... they met in the middle... barf. Never experienced that on a half and half pizze before. The veggies on the pizza also tasted like old fridge/ freezer, very strange.

The lemonade tasted like freezer burnt from concentrate, if it wasn't wet, I wouldn't have drank any of it. 

The service was alright, and they were busy, so either we got a bad pie, I am a pizza snob, or the food there is sub-par. I will never know, because god willing, I will never go back."}
{"text":"here for lunch today nice little place sat in the bar area in one of the curved booths. service was good place is pretty clean overall.  had the bruschetta and house salad as an appetizer and had an all-meat Pizza for the main part of my lunch the Italian sausage on the pizza was great. my friend had the chicken piccata it was absolutely amazing to would have been nice if it was served over angel hair pasta. very satisfied and will come back again"}
{"text":"Pizza was amazing , service terrible from the time you call in the order they put you on hold transfer, transfer back again , ordered a turkey sub, came Italian sub, ordered a sausage pep mushroom pizza it was just a cheese when we got home ..
Pizza was good, sub was terrible called manager to tell him the screw up, they didn't offer anything for their mistake .. still would get another pizza there again"}
{"text":"The pizza was gross. We tried to get away from the typical chains and tried this place. The pizza crust was tasteless, soggy and gross! We couldn't pick up the pizza slices to eat because of the soggy factor, but it was next to impossible to cut into bite size pieces because it was tough. So weird,  Won't be back."}
{"text":"My family out here used to take us to Red Devil every summer when visiting from New York, and to this day I stand by my assertion that this is the only edible pizza in the entire state of Arizona. 

The staff is very friendly, always grabs us early birds our beverages while waiting for the rest of our group (almost always 10+). The cold antipasto reminds me of what you'd expect back home, always fresh. The mozzarella sticks are a nice starter, as well the fried zucchini. Pizza is thin and crispy, just like it should be. 

Don't waste your time with any other excuse for what Arizona calls \"pizza\". Red Devil is fantastic."}
{"text":"This is my all time favorite place for pizza and wings. The wings are crispy but still have a great sauce and the pizza is New York style awesome. I could eat here every week and never get tired of it."}
{"text":"Went back to try this place out after a long hiatus with fond remembrances of pizzas past.

Not as good as I remembered-the crust was actually kind of tough and chewy. And they changed their cheese blend of something, definitely a different flavor profile than I remember.

Maybe it was a one-off...I will reserve final judgement till I have been back another time or two...this place was the bomb pizza back in the day!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing with wonderful service we had amber she was awesome!! Was on top of everything and very very polite anytime I'm craving pizza this is my go to spot."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!!! I always get the Large pizza one topping deal and it comes with 20 wings for $25. The flavor I get for the wings is New York mild and I always get extra cause you want them sauced up. There is always a wait in the evenings but you can go on a Saturday and get right in. This location is better than the Tempe one."}
{"text":"Crunchy wings!!! Nowhere else seems to be able to make crunchy wings anymore except red devil.

This place has a slight out dated feel inside but the delicious and fresh food makes me not care at all about the average decor.  We prefer to sit in the bar area and watch sporting events here.

Red devil has the best hot wings, bone in.  I've heard you can order them extra crispy though we never have and they are still saucy goodness with a crisp!

We really enjoyed the antipasto salad here as well as the homemade rolls.  Our service has always been friendly and timely."}
{"text":"Very boring pizza, if you don't like garlic, oregano, any spices, and think ketchup is pretty good then this is the spot for you."}
{"text":"Pizza was great! Did a create your own 16 inch with onions, garlic, spinach, and artichoke hearts and it was superb! Even cold! Take out guys were very friendly and accurate."}
{"text":"Came in late afternoon on a Monday and we were the only ones there with a few people at the bar. It was as if we bought out the restaurant just for us lol. Food was very good! My bf got the Philly Cheesesteak sandwich that was huge and he enjoyed. I had the tequila lime chicken and it was delicious! Definitely recommend! The early bird chicken plate came with a salad and cheesecake for under $12. Cheesecake was not the best but the main course definitely made up for it. Great service from our waiter Joey and the hostess. Overall great experience!"}
{"text":"Pizza is fantastic -- simple cheese pizza with basil.  Perfect.
Servers are great and very friendly.  If you're in PHX, stop by this wonderful gem of a restaurant.  Very close to the airport, and they have a convenient takeout window."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I've been going to this location for 30+ years. The only food I order here is the bruschetta,pizza and wings. They have a pizza and wings special for $26 and it's the BEST pizza in town. I've been to the other locations but for some reason the pizza and wings taste best here. I live in the far west valley and I make the trip all the way to east Phoenix to enjoy their pizza. If you're ever in the area I would recommend the pizza and wings special to anyone."}
{"text":"We love Red Devil! Given the choice we will always chose to get our pizza from there. My oldest daughter loves the Greek pizza. We have also tried others things on the menu and never been disappointed. Everyone we have dealt with have always been extremely nice and helpful."}
{"text":"Been going to Red Devil for years.  Always know what you are going to get here.  Good Pizza, sandwiches, wings and more.  The service is great and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I like it here. It is consistently good, although I never get the pizza...usually the pasta dishes. Also, the waitress seemed really nice. On my last visit, the cocktails weren't that great, but the soup and desserts were. They also have happy hour specials and lots of room. It was very crowded when we went, but the service was quick. I think these are both good signs."}
{"text":"This place is very close to a 5 star for me. At this point I'm going to say it's at a 4.5. The reason being is that my husband and I ate there over the weekend and ordered the buffalo chicken pizza. On the menu it said it had fresh carrots, celery, and onions on it. Sounded fab! But when it can out it was a greasy mess of a pizza. It looked like they threw some chicken and wing sauce on a regular cheese pizza and called it a day. And since the base of most wing sauces is butter it mad the pizza go greasy we could barely eat it. 

With that being said, we have eaten hear several other times and always loved it! The antipasto salad is amazing. and the Greek pizza is yummo. Their wings are some of the best I've had, and I don't say that lightly. I LOVE hot wings and am pretty picky about them. Red devil makes them super crispy with lots of sauce. If you get nothing else here, get the hot wings!"}
{"text":"Looooove Red Devils and looooove this location. Our order is always prepared in a timely manner and super delicious! Whether sit down or take out, the quality has not wavered. Their wings are also really yummy!!!"}
{"text":"Have been coming here every so often for the last 5 years.  Food can be great at times, but can also disappoint depending on what you order.  Pizzas are very good and consistent every time we get them.  Pastas are equally consistent, but that is not a good thing.  Lasagna is overcooked and a mess even for lasagna.  Salads are fresh and crisp.  Service is usually quite attentive and last night was no exception.  That had a decent crowd for a Wednesday night and our server was all over it.  We will be back but will probably stick to pizza & salads."}
{"text":"I seriously am lost for words, delicious pizza, crispy wings. Service was impeccable!"}
{"text":"Absolutely phenomenal! Intimate comfy atmosphere. Server wa s friendly and pizza and wings are heaven. Also tried italian sandwich. Have yet to find anything better."}
{"text":"I have always loved this place. It has been here for a very long time.Maybe since the 60's. Since there are very few landmarks in Phoenix, or anywhere in the Valley for that matter any more.
 It is nice to come in here. I love the look of it. It is not fancy, but very cool indeed!
We had to run some errands in Downtown Phx right at rush hour last night. So rather that be on the road for 2 hours trying to get home,we thought we would just go to Dinner.
Since we had not been to Red Devil in so long,it was a great choice.

I love the ambiance here. Good music playing. A couple of different things on the telly. 
We had a great server, Megan. She was everything perfect for our server. She knew the menu and how things were made. She was attentive and took away the plates and trash items promptly.We really enjoyed our experience.
While I have always loved the food here,it has not changed. We got pizza and 2 types of wings. I do not know what they do to the Pizza Crust,how they make it.  But, it is thin, crisp, and delicious. It is perfect. They use real mushrooms ,not canned, and the cheese and sauce are wonderful!
The Wings also, Fantastic. They are big, both the drumsticks and the wings. But, not full of fat like some places. These are all meat and no fat. The sauce they put on them are homemade right there in house.We got New York style Medium and the Hot wings. 
They also have Rolls with butter. I am not a fan of Bread, however the rolls here are amazing! They have a secret for making great food. I do not what it is but, I hope they never change.

They even have Happy Hour drink prices in the Dining room. Once again they made us so happy. What a wonderful place to spend rush hour.
There is a Red Devil in Tempe as well. The customer service there is not even close to this location. 
I just love everything about this place. Even the smell here is great. Like a real Italian Kitchen."}
{"text":"This is the first time i have ever been to this location.  I love the one located in Phoenix, on McDowell Road.    This is a bit different however.
  The decor does not have the 60's cool ,romantic feeling of the original location. But, it is really clean and well lit for sure. 
The staff is friendly and do a good job with their product. 
The food was excellent! The Greek Salad  was enough for 3 people and  that was the small version.  Wine was very responsible, and consistent refills on the Ice Tea. The Pizza was Delicious and the Wings were fabulous!!!
Easy to say i will be back, and did i mention the whole place smelled like wonderful Italian food...Hmmmm. 
I just wish it was a little darker in there, maybe that would help. Lots of parking in the lot as well and you can also get your food for pick up delivery."}
{"text":"Held my dad's 80th birthday party there.  30 of our family and friends were treated to the best puzza, wings and salad.  Joe and his team made this day extra special.  Tables were set and ready.    The food came out piping hot and perfectly prepared.  Our server never missed a beat.  I visit Red Devil every time I come visit my parents. 

The pizza and wings are always good but if you like other Italian foods they truly are amazing too."}
{"text":"If you like mediocre service, average tasting food, dirty bathrooms and inflated prices - Red Devil is the place for you! The pizza is okay, but expensive. The menus, salt/pepper shakers and the cheese shaker seemed grimy and dirty and the waitress seemed fairly disinterested. My companion and I shared a pizza and small order of wings.  He had a soda and I had water. The bill came to just under $30. Not worth it for a very average lunch."}
{"text":"Unfortunately we got seated next to a woman with 3 extremely LOUD children!! This impacted our experience greatly! I know their were other tables and I should have spoken up, but I was tired. They brought bread to the table, it was good, a 3 out of 5. We ordered an antipasto salad, something I order a lot of places, it was again a 3, not bad, not outstanding  and very little lettuce! Between average food and the kids behind me, I was done! They have a wide range of entrees and happy hour drink prices in the dining room. The desserts  are supposed to be homemade, so we decided to try the spumoni, omg, I  have never seen anything like this! The menu said \"chocolate,  vanilla and strawberry  ice cream\" so I asked if it had traditional pistachio,  I was assured that it did. Holy Spumoni! Check out my picture!  There was so much green food coloring I would not touch it! My dining partner did and after 1 bite had a green tongue!  Spumoni is Italian, not for leprechauns!  Not for me!"}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and wings to go with some friends last night and it was just what everyone needed. The pizza was better then average and I am pretty tough on pizza but for the price and taste I feel it beats out any of the big pizza chains that deliver. Wings had good flavor and the pizza had fresh toppings. I have ordered take out before and always good quality pizza."}
{"text":"I've had takeout pizza from here several times thanks to work, and it's really awful.  Consistently bland, greasy, and honestly more like a less-sweet but crustier Little Caeser's.  I wouldn't come here to dine-in, based on the quality of the pizza I've had (at least three times, if not more).  There's an enormous selection of quality Italian restaurants north of here that I would recommend, including Pat's Pizza Plus, Federal Pizza, Spinato's, Niccoli's, and of course Bianco."}
{"text":"Let me start out and say I've\"ve been a long time customer of \"The Devil\".  My friends and I have spent thousands over the past many years..... BUT on Monday went there on Aprils Fools Day and my friend and I ordered for lunch \"The Pizza and Wing Special \" and ONE Soda and a glass of water .... Let me add that we ordered TWO Toppings on the pizza .... Pepperoni and Sausage .... Food was good and I am one NOT To Complain But Give Compliments  as I know it's a TOUGH Business to 
be in ...  At the end of our meal I asked for the check and it was for OVER THIRTY- FIVE DOLLARS for ONE PIZZA With TWO TOPPINGS  And TWENTY WINGS and ONE Soda ..... As I looked at our check I mentioned to my friend \" no wonder the place is empty.\" Back in the day this place was packed and all I Know there are many other choices out there to spend thirty-five dollars for pizza and wings .... Oh by the way that Thirty-five dollars DIDN'T include the tip for our server ......."}
{"text":"I forget about Red Devil but damn, if I'm not bowled over by their pizza every time. The original crust is perfect for me.  It's not crispy thin or super thick like bread.  Who eats the crust from pizza?  I do when it's from Red Devil.  Their crust is lightly sprinkled with magical flavor that compels the crust to levitate to your mouth.  The cheese they use is amazing.  Even when the pizza was cold the next day i said yum. I got delivery so I expected my order to take forever.  Wrong.  It was delivered within 30 min.  It was hot, perfect and super fabulous.  I won't order delivery from any where else besides Red Devil.  I also ordered garlic cheese bread but it was just ok.  There are other places that have better garlic cheese bread but i won't deduct a star because of silly garlic cheese bread.  The pizza wins!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in phoenix. Was sorry to hear that one of the guys working the front, who ALWAYS greeted his customers with a friendly smile, passed away not too long ago.  He worked there for 30+ years. He was always the one who came to the window to help/greet the customer always with a smile. He will be missed by our family. He made going to Red Devil a special experience coming and going. Red Devil is missing a vital employee at their McDowell location."}
{"text":"I used to go here a lot as a kid. It was kind of a tradition for my family to go there after Phoenix Giants/Firebirds games. Or was it before the games? I don't know. Anyway, as a kid, it was my favorite pizza. Then we lost the Firebirds, and a few years later I moved to Los Angeles for school, and I went several years without going here. In the last two years, I've finally made it back to Red Devil on a couple occasions.

The restaurant is just as it was when I was a kid, right down to the old-school arcade game in the corner. And the pizza tastes the same too. And while it's still very good, I've got a couple favorite pizza joints in L.A. that edge it out. Still, when I'm in Phoenix and I'm hankering pizza, I don't know of a better place to go to satisfy the craving."}
{"text":"Love the food and the people. . Chili is out of this world, and staff is top shelf.
 Chicken Catachatori is very, very good"}
{"text":"The Olive Garden's alfredo sauce is so much better. Red Devils was way to thick and didn't even taste like alfredo sauce literally just melted thick butter and flour it wasn't edible. The shrimp was really good. But won't be coming back here because this is now the second time the food sucked."}
{"text":"We have been frequenting this location for many years and love coming back.  I feel like we have had almost everything on the menu by this time and the service has always been great.  We enjoy to sit in the bar area it just makes the dining experience feel more like a cozy family atmosphere.  My wife and daughter turned me onto their strawberry salad and it has now become a staple with any of our meals that we enjoy here.  Our old faithful is always the pizza, seems like it is always something different on top...we are working on every conceivable combination available.  We have had their subs and absolutely enjoyed them!  We have had their pasta dishes and those were good as well, but we always find our way back to the pizza!"}
{"text":"This place was centrally located right between where I and my friend work (it was almost exactly five miles for each of us coming north and south), so we decided to pick this spot for lunch. I had soup and fettucine alfredo, one of my favorite dishes. It wasn't as great as others I have had, but it still hit the spot! Our server was very friendly and we had very prompt service, especially for the rush hour at lunch. This place is not fancy at all but they had good food and service, so if you're looking for a decent and filling meal for lunch, I'd recommend Red Devil on McDowell."}
{"text":"Some of the best wings I've ever had in the valley. Also ordered a pizza which turned out to be very good as well. The crust is very fluffy and just a couple of slices and you will be filled."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for years ! The food is amazing . I really enjoyed the bread here too , it's bomber then eating olive gardens bread while waiting for your food . Sucks that they no longer give out the complimentary bread anymore"}
{"text":"My husband and I asked some locals they recommended this place. We were feeding a high school baseball team. The manager, Kathy McLaughlin, went out of her way to help our group! 

They have a great room for groups. Just communicate with them like we did and they will work with you. Team was fed fast and they were happy! 

Husband and I enjoyed talking with the young barkeep that had worked their since she was 17. She has been there 12 years! Many people have worked there for years!!! Like a family. She was fabulous and our food was fabulous. Enjoyed sitting at the bar and meeting the locals. Spaghetti and meatballs was so good and I had the cheese ravioli. All with a salad and great bread. Go find this place when in Phoenix. Makes me wish I lived closer! Thanks to the very nice staff!!"}
{"text":"I was on the mood for Italian food and do I figured I'd give this spot a try since it wasn't far from my hotel. 
I get this place two star is based solely on the greeter and how fast the food came out, however everything else was mediocre.

The lobby had sitting for about 3 people. The restaurant was a decent size but definitely outdated. 
I was only a few minutes before the waitress came over. I want to try the grilled chicken Broccoli Alfredo. This dinner comes with the choice of a salad or soup. I chose a salad, when the waitress asked me what dressing I told her Cesar; she then said \"for a Caesar salad it'll be extra\"
I looked at her puzzled and said what?
She then asked \"if you want a Caesar salad it'll cost more\" 
I then said how about a regular salad with a side of Caesar dressing? She said yes that's fine. 
So not only did she try to upsell the salad, she didn't even mention that having Caesar dressing on the side was an option.
Once I got my plate the chicken was good however the Alfredo sauce did not taste authentic whatsoever. The roll with butter that they gave was very plain and bland. 

I realize that getting Italian food in Arizona was probably my first mistake, I should've that Mexican, but I wasn't in the mood for that.


Definitely won't be coming back here again"}
{"text":"This is a good pizza place. My friend suggested it and then my boss suggested it, so I had to try it. Yes, Yes, Yes, and one more Yes. I have now been there 3 times. pizza is a thinner crust. We always get the Greek salad along with a pizza. The prices are also reasonable. They get really busy though, so be aware a wait will happen."}
{"text":"The food was great. We will be back. Yummy wings and delicious pizza. And the price is great."}
{"text":"When we lived in Tempe from 2003-2008; my family and I used to frequently visit this Red Devil location because we always were impressed with the quality of food, price and service. After we returned to living in the area after 5 years of living in another state, we made it a point to return to our old hangout spot. I don't know what happened  in the five years between visits, but the quality has fallen off badly and that is the nicest possible way I can word it. 

The poor quality began the moment we walked in the door. The host, who seemed about as enthusiastic to be there as I am when I go get a colonoscopy, greets us with \"how many?\" No \"hello thanks for coming,\" or \"welcome to  Red Devil, how are you today?\" or even a slight acknowledgement of appreciation for us being there. Then, we have a 19 month old.  99.999 percent of restaurants we visit at least ask us if we want a booster seat or high seat. Not Red Devil. We had to ask for one, they bring us one after 10 minutes; but the damn thing is one without a buckle to keep him safe. Then, we ordered an appetizer and our meal. After 20 minutes of waiting, without any interaction with our waitress, which led to four empty drink cups and thirst began kicking in, the woman comes out and notifies us they are \"really busy in the back.\" I'd give this excuse a fair amount of consideration if there was a line of people out the door. However, along with us, there was one other family there; whom were dining already when we arrived. Then, we finally get our pizza, but no plates. She tosses the pizza down in front of us and walks away. When she finally returns, I have to ask her for plates to use, to which she responds \"oh you don't already have them??\" I suppose I asked for plates for my health and they were already on pur table; and must have been invisible ones that she could see, but noone else could. Topping it all off,  our pizza was lukewarm like it had been out of the oven for a half an hour or more, had a finger full of barbeque sauce on the entire pizza (we ordered the bbq chicken one) and was severely lacking toppings. Don't get me wrong, I don't expect the pizza to be loaded and the company to dump every ingredient they have on it,  but if I am spending $18 dollars on a pizza; I sure as hell don't want to eat just the dough and crust.. And if nothing else, at least make damn sure the thing is barely warmer than room temperature.  

I am beyond disappointed with this experience.. I am not one who complains about every little detail, and generally am an easy person to please. As such, I don't like to hand out negative reviews and really will do so only if the experience is a completely undesirable one. This experience ranks as just that. If I wanted to be treated poorly upon arrival,  have a lengthy and unnecessary wait, have to ask for basic dining items, refills and a seat for my son to sit in; I'd have just gone through the drive through at Carl's Jr. At least there, I know my food will be hot. 

In conclusion; I couldn't wait to get back to Red Devil after five years. Now, it will be a long time before we go back again, if we go at all."}
{"text":"Damn good pizza! A little spendy (hence why I didnt give them 5 stars) for what you get but regardless, the pizza is pretty damn good. The wings are decent, I think there baked instead of fried and the sauce seems a little weak. They often have a 25 dollar special which includes 20 wings and a large pizza or some kind of 2 pizza wing combo for around 40 dollars. I'd recommend this spot to anyone looking for some family fun times surrounded with fun people and good food."}
{"text":"I love this place! Every time I go here the food is always on point.  Also this is the place that made me discover raspberry vinaigrette dressing for my salads, so delicious!   The portions are big, so they're good to spilt with someone or have enough to take some home with you for the next day! One of my favorite Italian places in the area, no doubt!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last night with a friend.

We ordered the Cheesy Garlic Toast as an appetizer. It was okay...just a piece of toast with slightly melted cheese on top. Could have been better.
For dinner we got a 14\" pizza with all pepperoni, half pineapple and half green bell peppers. It was so good!! The crust was nice and crispy...and the toppings were plentiful. Also, the proportions were great. Enough for leftovers the next day. Even the pricing wasn't bad. $18 for pizza, appetizer, and two drinks!

I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I've been here about once, it's seemed like a busy day because it was very crowded, but we go seated fast. We were seated next to the bar where the people were really loud and it made it hard you enjoy especially with a baby. It was also freezing cold but the food was good."}
{"text":"I took my better half here a few nights ago.  She was not sure what to expect.  I have eaten at the Red Devil places since I was a kid which seems like a life time ago.  We ordered a medium pepperoni and sausage.  The pizza was really good.  The service was good too.  The young lady did a great job of making sure the water cups were filled.  The best part was the desert.  I ordered the desert that has the pudding.  It was good.  My mom used to make a similar desert when I was a kid.  My mom would add oreos to it also.  This place is a great and I love it."}
{"text":"We have ordered here from work twice now.Neither time was I impressed at all. The pizza barely tasted a step above little caesars and was on the pricey side. The outside window for togo orders is convenient and nice for running to pick up but the food left a lot to be desired. I really wanted to be a big fan but just do not see any quality in the food we ordered."}
{"text":"Another great Phoenix original family eatery. This one on McDowell is the original and my favorite of all the locations. Excellent thin crust pizza and Italian specialties dine in or take out! You can even buy their award winning dough and pasta to take home for your own creations. Good energetic people make all the difference and Red Devil has plenty."}
{"text":"We were driving around trying to find a new restaurant & came across Red Devil. We took it as a good sign that the parking lot in front of the restaurant was completely packed & the extra parking lot off to the side of the restaurant only had a couple of empty spaces. When we walked in, we were promptly seated & the first thing we noticed was that this is very much a family-style restaurant.

After taking a look through their menu, we decided to get the fried zucchini & mushroom combo for appetizers and the barbeque chicken pizza for our meal. While we waited for our meal, we were served two rolls with butter which were good. The appetizer was also good - crunchy breading & not greasy. The barbeque pizza, as the previous items was good too - lots of barbeque sauce, chicken, & onions. Some bites tasted a little burnt so it was nothing to rave about. We ordered the 10\" size which had 6 pieces ... I'd say this was the right for two if you're hungry & also get appetizer to share. Lastly, we finished off with snickers cheesecake. I personally wasn't a fan of it, especially compared to other cheesecakes I've had in the past.

Overall, the impression was that everything was just good ... Nothing great that you'd rave about to friends & family but nothing bad either; we're undecided whether or not we'd go back."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with my order. We ordered through Uber eats and the restaurant did not follow any notes. We purchased over $100 worth of food and we were not satisfied nor were treated well. We called the manager and they would not even provide us our correct order by delivering it to our hotel. Food also was very low quality and disgusting. Sauce was plopped on top and cheese was not even melted. It's a disgrace to the Italian cuisine community and to my family and I. Do not order. This restaurant does not even deserve the one star I gave."}
{"text":"The classic Calzone was to die for! The ratio of cheese to sauce to dough was do well balanced. The marinara for dipping was thick and flavorful. If you're on a diet, break it for this Calzone!"}
{"text":"Out of all the locations this is my favorite. The atmosphere is cozy, easy going, casual but upscale at the same time. Service was fabulous. Red Devil pizza is good, nothing too fancy, but it is good! They serve a good thin crust. Honestly, I love their salads! I eat a half and it's plenty for me... usually."}
{"text":"Service was subpar. Waiter just couldn't get it right. Forgot drinks, food wrong. Salad dressing forgotten, pasta was to have no broccoli, pasta was to be penne and wound up being penne, and drinks forgotten."}
{"text":"I get a hankering for great pasta, like any day of the week, totally.  You get it, I know. Fettuccine with the meat sauce. Great portions, I love that a salad, and bread came with my purchase. Excellent service. You've been around for 50 years for some reason. Please drain the pasta a little better next time. I'll have to try the pizza next time. Lots of love,  Chris."}
{"text":"Ive been passing this place for years, I have ate their pizza and I like it so this review is for dining only.

I finally stopped in with some friends for dining, they arrived first I was the last to get there we ordered shortly after that (nothing fancy) and our food arrived about an hour and fifteen minutes later - apparently they blame the chicken parmesan as the culprit for the time delay. Other tables got their food in a reasonable amout of time and yes the place from not bust to very busy while we were there, but still our food order went in first.

Then, it was as if the 5 guys in the middle of the room went invisible and no one came buy. I have the grilled sausage sandwich and it was okay, wasn't the best Ive ever had.

I think I'll stick to pizza from this place and leave the dining alone."}
{"text":"Just moved to AZ from NJ and dinner here was a \"Taste of Home\".  My wife enjoyed the Seafood Marinara, and I thought the Penned w Meat sauce was excellent.  I'll definitely make the trip from N Glendale and eat here again."}
{"text":"I've eaten here since I was little and it's always been good. The pizza is always excellent, so is the pasta and salads. I've only ever gotten to go but it's always delicious and fresh. It's a little more expensive but you really get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Great place to grab bomb pizza and go to gay bar next door to  the \" twisted peacock\" They have booth seating and outstanding servers! My favorite new place!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Red Devil for years and it's among my favorite local Phoenix restaurants.  Great pizza, salads, pasta and wings. The service is always friendly and the prices are fair. Their 50+ years in Phoenix is a testament to how great they are.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Went to red devil for the first time last night based off of girlfriend's recommendation about this being the go to place for pizza and wings. The restaurant was a good family style place as was expected. We ordered the wings and pizza combo which was well worth the price. Some of the best wings I have had. What stood out most however was the service. I am not sure that this was his name but I believe our server was Jesus. Even though this isn't a fine dining restaurant so over the top service isn't expected I was pleasantly surprised how attentive our server was. Aside from being attentive his attitude was great the whole time. I hate nothing more than going out to eat and having a server who clearly doesn't want to be there and Jesus was the opposite of this. Seemed happy to be there and intent on making everyone's dinner enjoyable. Thanks! Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I've been going here for 20 years and the Red Devil makes the best NY style pizza in the Valley. Nothing has changed here since at least 1994 (except for there is no longer a \"smoking\" section).  Red Devil has perfect ratios of sauce, cheese, oregano, and toppings. The thin pizza crust is magically crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside. Red Devil has a full menu with pastas and some meat entrees, but the pizza is far and away the most superior. Our go-to order is 1 double pepperoni and 1 red devil combo (pepperoni, sausage, green bell pepper, mushrooms, and thin white onions). We typically order more pizza than we can eat in a meal, and take the leftovers home for breakfast or a snack the next day. Don't ever change, Red Devil."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for a few years. The service and food are wonderful. Kathy, the manager, is always friendly and greets everyone. The food is excellent. Our favorite is the pizza and New York mild wings. The rolls are really good too. Be sure to ask what the specialty cheesecake is. They are all delicious and freshly made. Take a piece home if you fill up on great Italian food. Truly a wonderful experience each and every time we come!"}
{"text":"EDIT - The Gluten Free pizza is also very good here! It's hard to get a quality GF crust but, crispy and flavorful!

Good pizza! Not my favorite but far from the worst. Sauce tastes good and they do not skimp on the cheese. Wings were very good too.

I haven't tried anything else on menu and only have ordered via takeout but, I would recommend it for pizza on a Friday night!"}
{"text":"Awful... if I could give no stars I would.  Our server was great but the food was... well, disgusting.  We spoke up and management shrugged.  Avoid."}
{"text":"This is the first time that I actually bought one of their pizzas.
I formerly worked for a company that always bought this Pizza
And to say the least was not impressed. However recently my wife
Was invited to lunch at RedDevil and she bought home some of their
Pizza. Needless to say it was actually very delicious. So being the skeptic
That I am we went and ordered one of their Pies. Well it was very very
Good.....so from now on will be getting my pies there......"}
{"text":"I love that this place delivers! I ordered a strawberry-walnut-chicken salad, and was not disappointed. The vinaigrette was divine, and the chicken charbroiled just so. I also ordered bruschetta, expecting a couple small slices of bread with a tiny bit of tomatoes on it. It came in a normal sized takeaway container. I was flabbergasted. Inside, were pieces upon pieces of toasted bread, topped with delicious tomatoes, garlic, basil, and cheese. Holy moly. It was enough to share with at least two other friends. Yum!"}
{"text":"we were seated right away, appetizers came out quick, the server Robin was  very nice and took good care of us. The wings were nice and crispy like we requested however the pizza want crispy at all even though we asked for it to be. We come here often and have for years and everyone we come the mens restroom smelles of urine. After all is said and done I will keep coming back because the food and service is generally good and the restroom smell if a minor offense that has nothing to do with the food."}
{"text":"I have to say that I'm very impressed with this Pizzeria that's been around over 50 years consistency is the key to any business and they have it on point might need to do a little more renovations to the building the trust me what you get out of this place is pure perfection, the pizza, appetizers everything is definitely on point it's not Factory main like most Lisa places around the valley they're actually taking the time to handcraft your pizza of from scratch.

I know the people from Phoenix truly enjoy this place if they were able to expand only would not for sure if there's any other locations in the valley but it would be awesome to get 1D peas and deep last so everyone can experience Red Devil Italian restaurant tremendous flavor and quality in ingredients that they serve you you can't miss out on this excellent restaurant that's been around the valley for over 50 years I can menu in the staff in the Cubs for continuing to bring the quality that is necessary to continue to keep up the good work you will see me again."}
{"text":"Red Devil has been around since before dirt was invented, and there is a reason: it is GOOD.

I love love love their bruchetta.  It is, no hyperbole, the best in town.  I don't know where they get those tomatoes, but I have never tasted a bad one there.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

Pizza=to die for.  Amazing.  The hubs and I usually split a white pie, and never regret it.... well, if you don't count the regret I feel that I over ate!

We have tried the entrees, but we always go back to the pizza.  It is really that good.

Go to Red Devil - what have you been waiting for?  Have some bruschetta.  Go home full."}
{"text":"(This review is for take-out service)

Most people have a 'go-to' list of their favorite comfort food places, and emergency list that is used when you need tasty, predictable, and reliable. 

Red Devil Pizza is at the top of my list for great NY style pizza. Forgetting fancy pizza, this place offers really tasty pizza, at a good price for what you get. Red Devil uses quality ingredients, and doesn't 'church it up' (with apologies to Joe Dirt).

If you are ready for an extra treat, ask for your pie to be 'well done', that gets you a bit of char on the crust, and takes it from good to great. The guys behind the takeout window work hard to make some of the best pie in the 602, so enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is a review for the pizza take out.

There are a few levels of pizza in the 602.

Top tier is Pizzia Bianco, Cibo, Federal PIzza, et al. Those are NOT daily pizza choices, to me they are special occasions. 

Everyday kind of awesome pizza is Red Devil! Light years ahead of NYPD, Streets, etc. this place is legit! I highly recommend trying the pizza 'well done' which gets you more char on the crust. It's super good. This place also has really great wings, which surprised me. I ask for all drums, as those little wings aren't worth the trouble.

Keep up the good work Red Devil. You are an oldie but a goodie."}
{"text":"I have been going to Red Devil as long as I can remember. I am not a huge pizza eater but I am telling you, I love Red Devil Pizza! I just eat the cheese pizza because it is my absolute favorite. They have many options for vegetarians and non vegetarians. From pizza, salad, variety of sandwiches and more. They also have a bar! We went to New York last year hoping to taste the great New York pizza....I found the New York pizza was nothing like RD...personally I was not impressed with the recommended Pizza places in New York...Red Devil is really much better!!"}
{"text":"Red Devil never disappoints. I've been coming here ever since I was a little kid and would never choose another pizza over this one. I'm gluten free and choose to splurge sometimes with Red Devil's pizza. My FAV"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since the place opened, having been acquainted to Red Devil's McDowell location in the early 80's.  Usually don't eat inside too often, but have never had a bad experience.  The pizzas are top notch as well as the toppings (not a Pizza Hut), the wings are from full size chickens as opposed to Long Wongs and bar wings.  The prices are more than reasonable.  Usually get a takeout pizza, however one time they incredibly gave my pizza away to someone else (how you do that I don't know) so had to wait while they made a new one that they gave me FREE of charge.  The parking here is much more accommodating than that circus of a mess that they have in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Good food decent prices, only been here for lunch though"}
{"text":"first off, our waiter was good but rather slow and messed up several aspects of the order. We waited for 1 hour with only water, no appetizers, and no refills or any of the drinks we ordered. When we finally did get food, it was the salads first and not the appetizers. We had to ask repeatedly for bread and water refills. The food came 1.5 hours into our exhausting visit and only then was the bottle of wine we ordered brought out. The food arrived at room temperature, the mixed vegetables were cold, and multiple aspects of the order were wrong. Pastas had the wrong sauces and when we complained to the waiter, he apologized and took the dishes back to the kitchen. 2 of the dishes were fixed properly and the 3rd dish was screwed up again. However, the combo pizza was absolutely delicious. It was a little heavy on the mushrooms but the sausage on top was fantastic. we had to bus our own table and placed our dirty dishes on a counter top behind us where they sat for the remainder of our meal. The veal parmesan arrived extremely over cooked and tasted of beef bottom round, not veal. it was tough, dry, and chewy. when all of these things were brought up to the manager (who was requested by both the staff and us to visit our table multiple times), she seemed intoxicated and easily angered. when the situation was explained, she comped the entire meal and stormed away in anger. this is the final straw as we have had bad experiences in the past. enjoy your 3 hour wait!"}
{"text":"I would give the Red Devil 3 stars but something changed my mind. 

First the food, the food was bland, it really didn't have any taste. I tried my friends grilled chicken fettuccine alfredo, with broccoli. The broccoli had more taste than the sauce, that was all I could taste was broccoli.

I had the Red Devil \"Trio\". Which consisted of 1/3 fettuccine alfredo. It tasted the same minus the broccoli. I was not overly impressed. 

A friend I was communicating with advised the pizzas/wings are what is good there. I would say I would go back and try them (regardless of the price being a bit high). Now to my ultimate reason I will not return

While in the restroom I saw two waiter staff walk in and leave without washing their hands. I was officially done at that point. Luckily non of them were our wait staff."}
{"text":"Red Devil catered a Junior Classical League (for students of Latin and Greek) lunch for our annual convention last month. Getting the food was one of my responsibilities and I had considered deli trays and had also looked at a few other catering places on line. All I knew is that I'd sooner die than call Fazoli's (who has often catered this lunch before). So it struck me suddenly with about a week to go- Red Devil! It's Italian, so it fits the theme, and we have always had a good meal there when we've gone. 

I stopped in to see the GM, Doug, and he took my order, assuring me that the portions listed for the hotel pan sizes I was getting are generous- I was feeding teenagers, after all, so I had my concerns. I was relieved that they could easily and pleasantly take my order so late in the game. They dropped off the food at our location on time, hot and fresh, and they even brought the napkins, plates, and plastic-ware. 

The food was a HUGE hit with everyone. The first pan to be emptied was the meat lasagna, followed by the chicken lasagna, and then the veggie penne pastas, one with chicken. The rolls were fantastic, and they even gave us plenty of real butter. Even the salads were by far a bigger hit with the kids than I had expected. And Doug was right- there was plenty of food and lots of people went back for seconds.

Best of all, when I gave the receipt to the treasurer of the organization, she was shocked at how low the price was, since last year, Fazoli's had cost close to twice as much! There is absolutely no comparison between the two when it comes to quality.

I would heartily recommend Red Devil for your catering needs- as well as for dinner. My colleagues and I have since fielded many requests from attendees and their parents for the name of the restaurant and we will continue to use them from now on whenever our convention is in the Phoenix area. Gratias vobis ago, Doug and Red Devil!"}
{"text":"Thanks once again to the magicians at Red Devil for being the culinary hit of my recent student-oriented convention. You know how it's nearly impossible to get kids to turn things like permission slips and registration forms in on time? Well, Red Devil can accommodate! A basic order to feed over 200 was placed about 72 hours in advance (but they only require 48! Good to know for last minute big parties) and then was added to with no complaints the day before the event. 

The biggest hits were the meat lasagna and the alfredo pasta with broccoli and large pieces of tender white chicken. The rolls and salads were gobbled up in no time. Red Devil even made a vegan pasta and a gluten-free salad for those with special dietary needs. Everything was delivered hot, fresh, and on time, complete with plastic ware, plates, and napkins. 

Last year, due to the location of the convention, I used my local McDowell Red Devil. This year, it was at my school in NoSco, so we went with the Bell location. It's great to know that there is consistency in the quality of the food, generous quantity, and outstanding service at both locations. 

Red Devil, te amo!"}
{"text":"Went back and tried the Poll Basil. Should have stuck with the red sauce items. The chicken in this dish seemed strangely cut and not cooked enough (not pink, just not fully heated). It was a good size portion, but there was cheese on the dish which was not mentioned and way too much garlic even for a garlic lover. You get your choice of pasta, but at $11.30, it is a bit pricey and I do not like having to pay extra for garlic toast which at least should be included with your entree. Not a bust, but not as good as my previous meal."}
{"text":"Unimpressed with this eggplant parmesan sandwich. The bread was soft, there wasn't enough cheese nor sauce and the entire bag was soaked with grease as I opened the sandwich. Not too mention, the hours of gas that came along with downing just half of this disaster. I would even go as far to say that they put something extra in this mess to cause the damage. Maybe they didn't feel like cooking anymore at just after 9pm, but whatever happened I will not be stepping within a country mile of this establishment. This Red Devil belongs in hell."}
{"text":"I'm hanging my head in shame as I open this review with full disclosure...I've lived in the Valley all my life which, so far, has been about, oh, let's say forty-eleven years. I've been aware of Red Devil since the 70's, but I've always lived on the west side and had never visited before. Making plans with my Bestie, I decided this would be the day. We were going to a movie in Scottsdale anyway; let's have lunch at the original McDowell location....except the website sez they don't open until 3:00 on Sundays. Drats! Backup plan: visit the one on Bell Road!

Greeted and seated without delay in a friendly fashion. Major props to Amber for excellent service throughout.

The bruschetta appetizer was huge. I expected, perhaps, 4 thin slices; this order was the size of Cleveland! Fresh tomatoes, fresh garlic, fat bread - deliciously presented.

I would not have guessed that the soup of the day at an Italian joint might be clam chowder. Let that be a lesson to me, and yes, it was mighty tasty.

B's order was pasta with white clam sauce. It comes with about 475 clams and just as much garlic as you care to request. Manna from heaven.

I had seafood marinara with linguine. The sauce was perfect - not too thin or thick. Several Olympic-sized shrimp, and scallops one could shoot hoops with. My parting comment about the clams above? Oh, yeah, this, too.

Enormous portions. We didn't finish anything and took all of the rest to go. In order to pay penance for all those years I neglected to visit (and because I live 60 miles away and have no idea when I'll be back), we ordered a pizza to take with us. Everything else is delicious; how would you expect the pizza to be? Thaaaat's right..."}
{"text":"It's easy to make a mediocre Pizza, but oh so difficult to find the right tasty one.. Well you can find it at Red Devil.. there's not much to say except for that fact that the peeps are friendly, they offer quick service, and delicious pizza that is sure to leave you satiated.  

Why should you have to wait 3 hours for a pizza at that other place?  I'm sure it's great, and hopefully I'll be able to try it some day.. but Red Devil is probably equally as good when you're hungry for a slice."}
{"text":"The smell was pretty radical right when we hit the door. the pizza was undercooked. it was more like a bunch of indians cooking I talian."}
{"text":"Wow, I heard so much about this place when my cousin came to visit, I thought we should try it; what a mistake; awful. Had an eggplant parm hero. Eggplant was so thin you couldn't taste it, was nothing but breading; sauce was dry, if you can imagine that...cheese was flavorless...hubby had the steak sandwich, which was chewy and tasteless as well...red devil is terrible...never again, guess I should know better than to listen to people in Arizona about Italian food....this was disgusting...."}
{"text":"On 4/13/16 I and my family went there for a bday dinner. It was busy n we waited 45 minutes roughly. Half appetizers came out and we waited for other half of appetizers. The kids food came out within four minutes and still waiting for appetizers. They were three other tables that got their food before ours and were there before them. I want to talk to the manager in the server and inform the server that this time would affect their tip. Finally our food came out n the manager gave us 25% off. We are very upset with the service, we been coming here for over 15+ years, and this experience was horrible!!!!"}
{"text":"This was the worst pizza ever. Order through door dash pizza was 100% raw. Soggy not even cooked no sauce. Awful. Plus tried to call the restaurant to complain. Their phone wouldn't work. Thanks to door dash my money was refunded but this was the worst pizza I have ever seen. Entire pizza in the trash."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome food! Unfortunately they need a major overhaul in the decor. funky smell in the main area."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I grew up going to another Red Devil location in Phoenix, so I am a little bias. I love the food here, although I think I've only gotten the pizza, salad and wings my entire life! There's a lovely Russian waitress there who is a real sweetheart and who makes the whole dining experience so much better. My one qualm is that not much effort is taken to spruce up the place - it looks like it came from a time capsule buried in 1990. 

$3 Long Island Iced Teas, and a $20.99 special on a large cheese pizza with 20 wings....awesome. Throw in some antipasto, and you have yourselves a party!"}
{"text":"Went there today for a pickup order, large peperoni pizza and a salad for about 15. Total given to me was $43.xx. Then I show the guy my \"get $5 off order of $30 or more\". Then he has a guy come over and re-do the numbers, I am now being told $41.xx. Uh, thats not $5. I checked the receipt and no breakdown given for the $5 off.  Should of asked whatsup but had to hurry back to my work place. Not good. Hopefully they read this and can give me an explanation."}
{"text":"If you didn't give Red Devil 5 stars, something must be wrong! Red Devil is by far the best pizza and wings hands down! Gotta love it, i live in California now and I wish there was a spot close to my house with wings and pizza like Red Devil. 

Just ate here this week since I was visiting Arizona, I came home a happy camper! :D"}
{"text":"I don't usually like eating here, because I'm always cold so I can't comment on that aspect but as far as the pizza goes.... It's bomb . com!"}
{"text":"I have always love red devil. There pizza and wing special is amazing!  I recently has alfredo pasta and it was awesome. My husband has the spaghetti and he did not like the marinara sauce used. He said it was tasteless. All in all this is a great little place to enjoy some great pizza"}
{"text":"I can sum up Red Devil in a single word : disappointing. My husband and I both have a long history with Red Devil, both together and before we knew each other. It was almost always go-to place for family birthday celebrations and we even had our first date there several years ago. In the past three years, Red Devil has declined in food quality and taste and the prices have sky rocketed. It has gotten to the point where we now push for our celebrations to take place somewhere else, because it has been a consistently disappointing experience for all of us.  Our visit today prompted my review - we once again visited Red Devil for a birthday celebration. We opted for a medium cheese people because if you opt for one of their specialties you're looking at about $15 for a medium - they also have pasta entrees that share the prices of a high quality Italian restaurant, which they are not. We were there with a group of about 10 people and the rest of the place was literally empty. It took them 15 minutes to get our drinks from the time we sat down and another 40 minutes for our food to arrive after we ordered it. On top of being slow, the waitress was also extremely rude, although she would have gotten more of a tip than she decided to add to our bill, oh well. This is very disappointing, we used to love Red Devil so much."}
{"text":"I phoned my order in on my way home from work. I was given a \"ticket number\" and was told it would be about 20 minutes. It was National Pizza Day, and boy were they busy!  Even with the volume of take out traffic- they were spot on. An order picked up ahead of me had 10 large pizzas- and my pizza was ready to go too. So needless to say- they have their timing and system down pat.

It's a little place. I remember coming here a few times as a child in the 70's and dining in. I thought it was long past time to stop by again. So- what's better on a Friday night but some classic pizza and watching the opening ceremony of the Olympics? They did not disappoint!  I ordered the large pizza with pepperoni. I figured, keep it simple and classic and I wouldn't be disappointed. It was EXACTLY as the pizza I remembered as a child. There were plenty of pepperonis that were full of flavor. Thin crust, simple sauce and fresh mozzarella cheese. Yes, there were pools of grease- but hey- it's real cheese and real pepperonis- that is what it is suppose to be. None of that designer stuff like arugula and grilled chicken, Don't get me wrong- designer pizzas are good, but this is true old fashioned pizza.

Parking is limited and there is usually a line at the take out window, but it moves quickly. While you are at the window, you can see the process. It is a narrow kitchen, but the staff communicate well and everyone moves in synch. 

I will be back, and I hope to make it for a dine in experience some time soon."}
{"text":"I had an issue last night with the waitress because my meal was brought out when all my relatives were done eating. It was 30 minutes late. So I took it to go. No apology just excuses that didn't match up. I called and spoke with the manager the next day and he gave a credit to me. I was not looking for a reimbursement, I just wanted to have satisfactory service. But that is nice of
Them to correct the mistakes of their employee.  I hope our waitress can at least learn to say \"sorry\" when mistakes happen next time."}
{"text":"Good pizza, good wings, friendly service, relaxed atmosphere. What more can I say?

Reasonable pricing...."}
{"text":"I am really shocked by the comments on here. I am wondering how you cannot enjoy the food here. I have been coming here since 1991. It is a simple neighborhood restaurant. It is like family. The food is always and I mean always good. Yes the atmosphere can get loud and it is fantastic for big groups. Kelly is the best waitress. She is so funny and doesn't even come to ask me what I am going to have to drink. She just brings it out. I am generally here one night a week. But she knows my favorites and remembers them! That makes me smile. The bread is the best. I am hooked on white pizza with chicken and feta cheese. Tonight I am having the chicken parm dinner with penne in butter sauce. Yes the entree is 15.95 comes with bread and soup or salad! You'll love the ranch! The serving is huge and I never finish it. This place is still my favorite! Better than Maggianos, Olive Garden, Carrabas combined!"}
{"text":"Everyone has their favorite style of pizza and ours for a cheese \"pie\" is Red Devil.  We stick to the standard anti-pasta salad and cheese pizza.  Thin crust is thin but not like a cracker, good sauce, and nice gooey cheese. 

Good to eat in or take home to northern Arizona.

Waitresses and managers are always very friendly and talkative.  

Don't forget the hot peppermints when you leave."}
{"text":"The Red Devil is a family-owned restaurant that offers Italian comfort food. I came here a few months ago for a co-worker's birthday lunch and found my first visit satisfactory. I ordered the Hawaiian personal size pizza and it was savory and tasty, albeit a bit soggy. Portions are large and value is pretty good. Lunch specials range in price from $6.49 to $9.49. Nothing about the Red Devil \"wowed\" me, but it's a solid place in Central Phoenix for diet-busting Italian comfort food that won't break the bank."}
{"text":"I guess I am the only one who is not impressed. 

About 40 years ago when my parents decided to torture us and move us to AZ our relatives took us here. Not much has changed. Not that it is a bad thing to remain the same. 

We after going to see the Chihuly exhibit we decided to stop here for dinner. 

The two women who greeted and served us were fine I guess. Timing when you put the order in to come out when salads are eaten would be nice, but what the hell. 

Antipasto Salad .........................................................Small $7.95 Large $10.95 
Artichoke hearts, fresh Roma tomatoes, pepperoncinis, black and green olives, provolone cheese, Genoa salami, red and green bell peppers, radishes and cappicola. 

We ordered the large for four people. This salad was a joke, three small artichokes were found, less than one full sheet of cheap cheese and salami were used and no Roma tomatoes. perhaps a half of a radish was sliced in to it and a bunch of lettuce all for $10.95 

Gus and I shared a medium: Red Devil Combo $17.70 
Pepperoni, chunky sausage, onions, mushrooms & green peppers 

The taste was OK I guess even though the onion was the part I would throw away. But the crust was like shoe leather. I have all my teeth and could not bite through it and the knife too had one hell of a time cutting it . 

Our Friends ordered something else; what I do not know. 

The prices here are much too high for the quality,"}
{"text":"If you're craving comfort Italian food, this is absolutely your place! Come casual, it is definitely a laid back atmosphere. Red Devil has been a favorite in our family since I was a small child! In fact, for a while it was our Friday tradition! 

My favorite {& I literally get it every time --SUPER unhealthy, but worth the cheat day!} is the Chicken Romano. It is DEFINITELY enough for two. It is two pounded out, super thin chicken cutlets, deep fried and floating in garlic butter, lemon, green onions and Romano cheese. Can you say YUM?! I always get it with a side of their spaghetti marinara (You get to choose a side of your choice). It also comes with a salad -- their ranch is AMAZING. I know, this meal is worth a whole week of calories but it is seriously delightful.

I promise you won't be disappointed at Red Devil!"}
{"text":"This place has been here since 1960. A really good restaurant,with really good food. On this trip we got Pizza and wings to go. You call in and they have it  ready in 15 to 29 min. The pizza crust is really great. I always love their Pizza. It is one of the best  in the valley. We got 2 types of wings hot and BBQ. Both were fabulous! There is not a lot of parking in the lot because, it is so popular. So you may have to park on the side street but, all worth it."}
{"text":"Red Devil is one of my favorite pizza places in the Phoenix area to go to. This place has been around for quite some time, and the quality of the pizza is always superb. My go to when I come is here is the infamous pizza and wing special. My family and I always opt for a pepperoni pizza double cut. Our wings, we usually do half hot and half honey hot. Both flavors had great taste. For an appetizer, the restaurant always provides fresh dinner rolls. They definitely were slightly different than I remember. My sister and I always opt for the small garden salads as well. The ranch Red Devil offers, is hands down the best ranch ever. The taste is something you just cannot get anywhere else. Furthermore, if you're looking for a good brew, I recommend the restaurants red devil ale. I shall definitely return next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I had the extreme displeasure of attempting to dine here on 10-26-14 with my good friend, who had her toddler in tow. First of all, I have been a regular customer at this restaurant for nearly 20 years. Sadly, every time I go the experience is worse and worse. I think I'm done. REALLY bad service, coupled with excuses by a young man who claimed he was the manager, who identified himself as \"Danny\". Well, Danny had nothing but excuses about the INEXCUSABLE bad service, long wait for food, (though they were nearly empty) and his feeble attempt at trying to make it our problem, only made matters worse. The understaffing is not the concern of the customer, \"Danny\" and is completely a management problem. In all reality I thought he was the dishwasher. Nothing about this young man says management, and nothing about this restaurant says, \"we want your business!\". It's too bad. This used to be a great place to dine. I have no idea what happened, but it's not good."}
{"text":"Summary:  Middle of the road Italian food.  Decent price, very large portions, weak on flavor.  Zero atmosphere.  Good service.

The wings are solid, and good for a group to share ($27 for 40 wings).  The honey heat wings are better than the original flavor wings, but both are above average

The salad is standard bagged mix greens and bottled dressing.  Move on.  

The pizza - decent crust, but totally lacking flavor.  The cheese, sauce and toppings amounted to nothing.  Better than domino's (what isn't?), but lots of better options for checkered tablecloth style pizza.

Entrees were huge.  Chicken Parm was crisp and moist but again had no flavor.  The red sauce was also just plain and the side of pasta was overcooked.  Another guest got the Chicken Marsala and there was agreement it was better than the Parm.

The room is barely decorated and unmemorable.  We got there at 5 on a Sunday and the place was packed full.  My party of 8 was squished uncomfortably into a table against the wall.  It must be noted our server was extremely nice, prompt and thorough."}
{"text":"I have been going to red devils for over 30 years! wow that makes me feel old lol. i promise this is by far the best pizza in arizona!"}
{"text":"Excellent simply Amazing food everything is Perfect and Delicious.Every time we go there .Service is Great and food is Better. We love Red Devil is the Best Ever & Allways!"}
{"text":"I have been coming in here for many years now. What is not to love~!
I think the food is pretty fantastic!  Pizza, really good. Wings,excellant!
Salads are freash and flavorful. 
Like how easy it is to call in an order, pick it up at the window and go.
Good staff, the decor is a bit old fashion in an 80;s way. But, in the grand scheme it means nothing. 
I like the food here so I will be back many times!
Lots of parking in the lot as well."}
{"text":"My buddy Mike and I went here the night before Thanksgiving.  We had some last minute food shopping to do, then pick his girlfriend up at the airport.
I have eaten at the Red Devil on McDowell...while it doesn't WOW me, it has always been decent food at decent prices in large quantity - so I was willing to hit up this location.
Ahhh...the smell of cleaning fluids.  Sure, it's nice to know they keep the place clean - but when I walk into a restaurant, I want to smell FOOD, not anti bacterial disinfectant!
I had the chicken marsala, Mike ordered the chicken lasagne.  The salads were predictable iceberg, two slices red onion, 2 canned black olives.  Nothing wrong with them...just lackluster and boring.  Same with the bread.  Sure, it was fresh and warm.  But lackluster and without remarkable flavor or texture.
My chicken had been tenderized beyond identification.  (Think the inside of a McDonalds chicken nugget.)  The marsala sauce was bland as could be and the mushrooms were straight out of a can.  I was quite hungry, and made it about halfway through before the lack of decent flavor told me to stop.  The side of pasta with red sauce was fine.  If I ever have to go back, maybe I'll just stick with that.
Mike said his chicken lasagne was OK...but within a half hour of leaving the restaurant, he recinded that.
When we spoke Thanksgiving morning, he sounded to be in bad shape.  I figured it was because we picked up his girlfriend at the aiport at about 10, so he was up all night \"reacquainting\" with her.  I was half right.  He WAS up all night...but it was doubled over in pain in the restroom.
So - I am the lucky one here.  Completely disappointed in my meal - but I didn't get physically ill.  
If that's the best thing I can come up with to say about the place - well, you know I won't be back!"}
{"text":"Great service and incredible food. I had the cheesy garlic toast and wings, and they were enough to fill me up. I can't wait to go back and sample some more of this fabulous restaurant's menu!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings. Lousy service, sometimes bordering on rude. But pizza and wings make up for it. Sometimes a long wait. If they could get a manager who knows how to train and supervise staff, this place would be perfect"}
{"text":"Great pizza and good Italian food. Nice seating area. Good salad and nice bread.
Good friendly service. Even if the server isn't yours everyone double checks on you. Food is good and hot and fresh. 
Good parking spot easy in and out on to bell rd."}
{"text":"Hey guys! Literally just received my takeout order and there is cheese on everything that I said \"allergy\" on. It's just so disappointing that everytime, like clockwork, restaurants don't read the special notes. I wrote \"no cheese, allergy!!\" On numerous items and now I can't eat any of the $50 worth of food I ordered. I ordered a sausage and peppers sub, no cheese...a pizza supreme, half no cheese..and wings (not for me) along with some other items not for me. They called me (9:25)to say they were closing at 9:30 after Yelp delivery said 10 and I ordered at 9:15. They said the estimated time was 10:30 that the food would arrive on Yelp after I ordered. So when the pizza place called they said that time was wrong and it would probably get there faster and made it a point to say they were closing. Did you want me to cancel? Did the notes not come up on the ticket, Did you look or just rush it out? I even tipped the delivery guy $10 on top of the 20% tip I already gave on my card.  I'm just super f'ing pissed off."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location since I was a kid. However I may not return here again.  This by far was the worst service I have experienced from anywhere. The waitress was horrible,  my pizza was soggy and since we ordered the pizza and 20 wing special we only received 15 wings. Not to mention when I explained this to the manager he did not seem to care. It's sad to say but after all these years this place is now horrible and will no longer recommend them to anyone.  Nor spend my money there as well!"}
{"text":"I use to always go here for banquets and the pizza and wings were always awesome! Including the Caesar salad. The wings were spicy enough and the pizza is sooo cheesy. I go here about once a month."}
{"text":"awesome take out! the pizza and wings were so fresh and the people in the kitchen were so sweet! Thank you!"}
{"text":"I love this pizza I have had this pizza ever since I was a young child in fact this is what I would as for as my birthday dinner every birthday 
The staff at the pick up window are very nice and to watch them work on the pizzas is always a joy 
Best pizza around my Phoenix area"}
{"text":"Great food always! The staff are friendly and the pizza and wings are excellent. It's a great off the beaten path location to eat Italian."}
{"text":"I eat here about once a month or so. Only because of the distance. 
Always fast and friendly service.
Always get the same thing.
Pizza and wings. 
Pizza crust has a nice and chewy. 
Decent sauce, but great cheese and toppings.
Not much else to say.
Great pizza and service.
Nuff said."}
{"text":"Out of all the times I have been here I have never had a bad experience! I will definitely be coming back for more. I especially Love food, and the service!"}
{"text":"Holy cow, this place is delicious! I came here with my girlfriend, but she had never been to this location before, so I don't know how this one compared to the others, but this place made some bomb food. I had the tortellini Alfredo and enjoyed it very, VERY much. The table layout doesn't leave too much room, but it didn't matter cuz I was only focused on the plate. Also, our server was very pleasant and professional. I always think it's great when they greet you with a smile on their face. So extra points for that too. Overall, try this place out!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas I have eaten. Soft, crispy, a little burned on top. Absolutely delicious! 10\" for 8 bucks and 22 oz Coors light for $3.50, what a deal!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here since it was on the way home and ordered a pizza to go. I didn't have the chance to go in and have dinner, so I cannot comment on service inside. 

There is an outdoor window for takeout orders an you can watch as the pizzas are made. 

The wait wasn't as long as thought it was going to be; the person who cashed me out told me it would be over 30mis AFTER my card was charged. Luckily it only took 15-20 mins MAX and we were on our way. 

The good part is that the pizza is very fresh as its VERY busy. I liked the taste of the outermost crust and the toppings were generous. 
The sauce was a little sweet for my taste; I prefer a more savory sauce paired with most dishes. 
The bottom part of the crust was much more soggy and didn't hold up to the toppings, this was not good as it took away from the pizza in that I almost wish the whole crust could have been like the outside. It makes me think that maybe it was streched to much or not cooked enough. 

I don't know that I would try this restuarant for dinner, especially if the sauce for entrees is just as sweet. It was just ok to me and not a place I would go out of my way to head to."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Tempe Red Devil every once and a while for many years.  I used to really enjoy it.  The last two times I ate there I felt ripped off and did not enjoy my food, at all.  The food quality is down, and the prices are up....Way up...Red Devil is trying to charge fine Italian dining prices, for what amounts to an outdated, aging, dumpy, musty, local pizza joint, with inconsistent food and service.  Today my meatball sandwitch was luke warm, with stale bread, and tasted like it had TV dinner meatballs and sauce in it.  The sandwich is  almost $9.00, and fries or any other side is extra.  I got the fries, and they were soggy from a frozen bag.  Allot of people still seem to still like this place.  I am done with it.   I will go to Riazzis, Vincitorios, or even Olive Garden over Red Devil going forward."}
{"text":"I was really impressed.  I had not been in years but it was on the way home.  I got one of those last minute \"can you get a pizza\" texts before I left work.  This was right on my way and the pick up window made it super convenient (although having never been to the pick up window, a sign would have been nice so I didn't look like a dork going into the restaurant).

The pizza was great, and my little picky eater who never likes anything other than cheese pizza said she wants the meatball and olive pizza again.  High praise."}
{"text":"I heard such great things about this restaurant... I was totally looking forward to it.. The building and interior decor is totally outdated.. but then again who cares. Its about the food anyways.. I ordered the TORTELLINI BROCCOLI ALFREDO..... So SO gross. Tasted like something cheap out of a can.. I am not a picky eater at all whatsoever... and this was nasty...."}
{"text":"If you have a gluten allergy DO NOT EAT HERE.  Ordered takeout for 4 people at the office (birthday lunch, and the boss likes this place).  Thankfully I was the one to go and pick it up, otherwise I would not have seen the APPALLING kitchen conditions. Takeout orders are picked up from a window directly into the kitchen. Now, this may not be an issue for someone who doesn't have food allergies, but I was able to see that literally every surface in that kitchen was covered with a layer of flour - wheat flour.  This included: the cook's hands and arms up to the elbow, the cash register, the money he gave me as change, the entire food prep area, as well as the take-out boxes and bags that the food was in (the bag even left flour smudges on my car mats!).  As I said though, that may be completely irrelevant to anyone who doesn't have allergies.  But to me, it was the equivalent of seeing a dozen cockroaches scurry across the kitchen floor.  When I placed our order, I specifically told the guy on the phone that I had a gluten allergy, and can you please check to make sure there is no gluten in your salad dressing, and no croutons on my salad.  He said it was fine.  Of course when I opened the box it did have croutons, and the box itself had flour fingerprints on it.  No way I was touching that food!  The rest of the office said that their meals were ok, but nothing noteworthy.  Do yourself a favor and go somewhere with better kitchen hygiene practices (because you never know what ELSE they don't clean up!)."}
{"text":"There pizza is good, However it is really expensive and there location parking lot is a joke to get in and out of! There bar was nice and quaint, However I almost fell over when they told me a bottle of beer was like $4.50 per bottle. There our a lot if better and less expensive pizza places around town, this definitely would not be my first choice."}
{"text":"I discovered this place many years ago soon after I first moved here.  This has got to be the most DELICIOUS pizza EVAR!!!  They are super nice and fast!  Absolutely excellent service!!  
I mostly order take-out and the guy who usually is there is the friendliest person and is always smiling!  I've had several of their dishes which are also delicious, but I would be doing a disservice to pizza lovers if I didn't recommend this place! 

PS, when you ask for extra cheese, they aren't messing around either! 
LOVE IT!!!"}
{"text":"The lunch specials here are great. I think it was about $7.50 before tax for two slices of pepperoni pizza and 5 or 6 wings. It's good old-fashioned comfort food."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing Wings! Damn good Mediterranean Pizza(The crust is delicious),  and highly recommend the Greek Salad.
If you're super hungry and dine in - service is fast & friendly every time."}
{"text":"I just love this place I've been coming here since I was five years old! We have the best pizza and the best wings you won't be disappointed. Great lunch specials! It gets very busy so there's usually a line starting at 11 AM when they open. :-)"}
{"text":"I have been coming here for the past 4 years; the pizza and food are great.  The service has been very good, some seasonal workers and some regulars.  I bring friends from out of town here for good pizza and wings.  I would recommend it any time."}
{"text":"Well first off ordered mushrooms and zucchini took one bite and Ice cold.. Sent them back so well see what happens next.
mushrooms came back hot. pizza just ok. we probably wont be back again."}
{"text":"A favorite for lunch when I worked in Tempe.  Good pizza, although it had to grow on me.  The first time I tried it, I wasn't crazy about it.  But then I found myself craving it.  Definitely different and definitly tasty.  However, I had a HORRIBLE experience with the eggplant parmesan here.  It was just glops of cheese and really bitter eggplant.  One of the worst dishes I have ever eaten at any restaurant.  I'm not one to complain about my meals, though, so I picked through it and left the majority.  On a really positive note, the waiter asked me if there was something wrong with my food.  I replied, \"Oh, no, I'm just not that hungry.\"  He insisted on asking if I wanted something else, and he took some of the charge off our bill when it arrived.  So that was pretty cool.  Word to the wise... stick with the apps and pizza here.  Eggplant parmesan, not so much."}
{"text":"I want everyone to know how much we enjoyed our dining experience Monday. The pizza with pepperoni and seasoned beef along with honey hot wings were the best as usual. Our server Nick was superb. He was professional, polite and friendly. He has the perfect personality to take care of customers. We will ask for him on our next visit. We usually get a chance to talk with the owner Kathy also. Keep up the great service and delicious food. It is appreciated. 
The restaurant is clean and spacious as well. Easily accommodates large or small groups. I want to try the lasagna and the Philly cheese steak soon."}
{"text":"The pizza was really good. Some of the best that I have had while living in Phoenix. 
We came in and we're seated immediately by the hostess. However, 10 minutes after waiting for our waitress she finally popped up and told us she'd be with us soon. No big deal as it looked like she was the only waitress in the whole place and serving about 5 tables. The wait was so long that we nearly canceled our order to leave. 50 minutes after we arrived we finally received our pizza and all was well with this.

We simply will not go back again as we have children and if the wait is always like this we just don't have the patience with hungry kids.

Two stars only because the waitress was very nice and we could tell she was trying very hard with no assistance."}
{"text":"Best place for pizza & wings, hands down!

If you're looking for awesome wings and very good pizza, Red Devil is the place to go. I'm not too sure if this is the original Red Devil, but it's very vintage. You gotta try their special that they have which is the 20 wings with a large pizza for like $25 bucks, I believe? Can't get any better than that. Their BBQ sauced wings are amazing on a dish. They're known for their perfect ranch sauce and fresh dinner rolls. I'm not big on hot wings, but my dad devours their hot wings every time we go, so they much be good! 

Great place to go and always great service!"}
{"text":"This is where u wanna go when u want to meet up with all your family and pay for the tab lol it's cool and really good wings"}
{"text":"Love this place. Usually do take out but have dined in as well. They have fried zucchini, wings salad, pizza! The food is awesome."}
{"text":"The spaghetti was really good & enough for two meals. I can not believe they charge for bread though. Not just extra bread but any bread. That is ridiculous for an Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow!! Very impressive!!

I was in Phoenix from out of town at a construction site and it was getting close to lunch. Without hesitation, I was taken to Red Devil.

Now, the outside of the place doesn't look like much, but do not let that deter you and obviously it doesn't deter the locals.

I had a pasta dish that was what you would describe as garlicky heaven!! The pasta was cooked perfectly and may have been some of the best I have had.

Highly recommend the place!!"}
{"text":"This is another place that is commonly suggested by friends that we end up going to, only to be disappointed afterwards.

Its a loud, boisterous sprawling place with a bar and plenty of large tables. Service is pretty good, and they handle large parties well.

The food...is uninspired and bland. The bread is commercial (not made in-house) but pretty tasty.

The red sauce is...pretty bad. Its watery and seems to have no spice to it, certainly no detectable garlic or oregano. The pasta was overcooked and the minestrone (supposed to be a specialty) was uninspired.

The veal parmigiana was HORRID. Pounded so flat that frying made it tasteless like a piece of breaded cardboard, covered in cheese and that tasteless sauce. The spaghetti side was forgettable. My wife's fettuccine alfredo was watery the first time and too thick the second, and both times gritty.

Next time we're dragged here I'm going to try the pizza, which actually looks good...they'll need to impress me quite a bit for me to ever actually suggest this place on my own."}
{"text":"I don't know what's happened here.  We came for happy hour last fall and were floored by how good the food was.  Been trying to find time to get back there, and finally did last night.  Wow.  I don't know if it was just the food items on the menu then vs. now or what.  My salad with Italian dressing was ok.  Nothing special.  Dining companions caesar - said it was salty - almost inedible.  The rolls were not pleasant to eat and we both were covered in crumbs trying to sample a bit.  He had the chicken picatta and said the sauce was great, but the portion size - even understanding it was the early bird special - left a LOT to be desired.  My lasagne bake was ok - 1/2 was great (the beef portion) - the chicken was not interesting at all.  Cheesecake was great though.  Service was great though."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location 1 time i dont know if it was time of day but had an Italian beef sandwich threw up for two days not good"}
{"text":"I really enjoy going to this restaurant. Had a group of 6 and we all ordered different items off the menu. Not one complaint."}
{"text":"Great little Italian restaurant in Tempe! The service was fantastic! My girlfriends and I went in fairly late after a long day of being in Sedona and the staff was not bothered by us coming in so late. They treated wonderfully and could tell we were very hungry so they made sure to bring us fresh, hot rolls immediately and our food came out in an orderly manner! I got the cheese calzone and it was quite delicious! And plenty to eat and take home! Our waitress so sweet and funny; she joked around with us and delivered our food to us like it was the holy grail! I dropped one star only because it was a little dusty. The second I sat down at our booth table a gust of dust got caught in my nose and throat so I was coughing and sneezing throughout the whole meal but like I said, the service made up for it! So don't hold that against them! Besides real foodies know sometimes the dirtiest places have the greatest food and people!"}
{"text":"The servers are real pros. They have great Italian dishes try the pasta with Marinara. House wines are good. Sunday night was good not much of a crowd. Good bread basket."}
{"text":"Wings were tasty! Pizza sauce had great flavor! Worth trying."}
{"text":"We arte here at my sister-in-laws suggestion during our Cheistmas visit.

I had the minestrone soup and a salad.  The soup was okay, nothing to remember, but the salad was memorable for its sheer size.  I got the large, my mom got a small.  The large must have been at least three times bigger than the small.  It's a great price deal at only $7 but it's all you should get!

My mom said her clam chowder was \"all right\" which usually means it was okay but she wouldn't get it again.  HER salad was okay, I didn't finish mine, I was too full from the soup and it was way too a large to tackle."}
{"text":"The best pizza , wings, and ranch! Have been going here since I was little. Will forever be my favorite place! Good for dine -in or take out! Also this is the only good location in my opinion, the others don't taste the same."}
{"text":"My favorite North Phoenix Italian Restaurant! And has been for 15+ years. 
Love the food, especially the pizza and family size salad. Always fresh and yummy. Even when we get it to go it's always excellent. 
The waitstaff is personable and attentive. 
We dine here at least once a month. 
Be sure to order their bleu cheese dressing! It's homemade!"}
{"text":"Went to Red Devil with a few friends to experience their wings and pizza.  I was not impress with the food at all.  My friends liked it but for me the Pizza had a cardboard taste to it.  I'm from Chicago where Pizza is Pizza and this place did not do it for me.  Sorry!"}
{"text":"A great and delicious place to go for some Italian comfort food,  If it is the first time there make sure you tell them the GM was great he gave us dessert on the house, the food is great and the pizza excellent I love that the to go food is outside so if you are not dressed up you will not have to worry about impressions.  Service all the way around great keep up the great work!  I have returned about eight times and have taken family from out of town"}
{"text":"Excellent service here! Our waitress was amazing and even had New wings made for us when we said they were a bit overcooked. Though the flavor of the wings are good, they still come rather crispy and small. I was expecting Better wings here but they were at least hot. The pizza is amazing!!! It's a great ambiance itself, however there were rather loud patrons at the bar during my date. I found out way too much information than i needed to know about their personal lives. Don't sit near the bar if you can."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and were happy with the food but I was looking for the best pizza at the time and what we had wasn't it. Tonight changed that. Not only do they have shrimp available for the pizza but it was thin and scrumptious! :) Apparently the last time the pizza wasn't as thin as it was supposed to be. Thankfully we tried again. We have always been happy with the pasta options, but the pizza was a deal breaker. I am looking forward to our next visit."}
{"text":"Eat here. My advice is to get the large pizza and wings special because those are the two things that this place does best. Don't get to adventureus with the menu and you will leave happy and full."}
{"text":"Sometimes you just need a meal full of comfort and nostalgia.  What Macayo's or TeePee is for Mexican, the Red Devil is for Italian.  Nothing but the old American-Italian staples that we grew up on.  No pretention, reasonable prices, and a familar menu that is executed well."}
{"text":"Luckys closed so that left me looking for new pizza. I am not sure why we never ordered from here before I mean this place has been there forever!! I am glad we finally tried it pizza and wings it was gooood! The sauce is fresh tastes like its supposed to and not sweet or sugary like some other place. I am pretty picky with the pizza and ordered from here 3x now without reading about it here first. Now I know not to order anything but the pizza which is fine by me!"}
{"text":"What Can I Say

We went to Red Devil Pizzeria on a whim, having only eaten here once before quite some time ago. Despite being the lunch \"rush hour\" We were seated immediately, given lunch menus, and received our beverages almost immediately. 

We all decided to eat from the lunch menu. My lunch Companion and I ordered the white and red calzones. While my other lunch companion went with the two Slice Pizza and Wing combo.

The calzones with slightly overcooked on the bottom however, they were full of cheese. The calzones weren't bad it's just that they weren't very good. However, my lunch companion said that the pizza slices and boneless wings were good.

I think on my next visit I might order the pizza and wings, maybe on this visit I just ordered the wrong entree."}
{"text":"If you like an \"uncomplicated\" dining experience with the entire Family then Red Devil is for you. I have been going there for years and one of the reason why I like it so much is because it is a place you where don't have to worry about bringing little kids.  The traditional \"Mom and Pop Atmosphere\" makes this place a great escape from the franchised world. 

The wings are great. I just have one caveat: If you have never been there before: Medium Wings translate into Mild Wings, and Mild Wings translate into Barbecue Wings. Personally I prefer the Medium or Hot Wings.  Nevertheless the wings are great and the pie is no-nonsense style Italiano. 

The Red Devil is overall a great place (perhaps can be considered a Phoenix institution) where you receive plenty of food at a decent price."}
{"text":"This is the first location or central mothership for the Red Devil local chain.

Well chain isn't exactly right as I believe there is only two of them.

Fine itallian and pizza should be yours for purchase at this ancient (by Phoenix standards.  More than 10 years!) venue."}
{"text":"It is really difficult to find good food in Phoenix.  I'll spare you as to my theories of why this is.

But wait!  This place is quite good.

One star deducted for having broken pinball games in their waiting area.  Nothing is more annoying than playing Invaders From Mars with weak flippers.  So lame!

This place has a pickup window outside for you to scam your takeout, a bar inside for the lushes/regulars to eat and drink, and a separate dining area so that the kiddies don't have to be disturbed at too young an age by rampant alcoholism.

All of your italian faves and highly decent pizza are yours to be had here."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time on a Tuesday afternoon, and had a great meal and even better service. Maria was very helpful with menu suggestions, as well as attentive. Maria was a delight, (and not to mention easy on the eyes). I will definitley be back again."}
{"text":"The pizza and wings are a must have in in the pizza n wing world. High marks. The manager Lady (KATHY I believe) is my only complaint she was rude to us and she was rude to our waiter in front of us also. There is no way she should be able to manage a restaurant with an attitude like that. ZERO STARS FOR KATHY!!!"}
{"text":"First and last time trying this pizza. So much sauce on one pizza but very little cheese. Edges of crust burnt and inedible but the rest of the crust was underdone. Tasteless."}
{"text":"Seriously the slowest experience ever! There were four of us really early...the restaurant was pretty much empty. We ordered three entrees and four desserts (It was so early that I was still full from lunch!) Anyway, they bring out our desserts first! We kinda all look at each other and the waitress takes a cue and says, oh the food isn't ready yet so I thought I would start you off with some desserts. Okay, cool, we will take it. We ate our desserts and were still waiting for our food! It was nuts. We went in for a quick bite and it took 2 hours! Haha and flagging someone to get us our check was darn near impossible. Oh and it is in a sketch part of Phx. haha!

The food: Their Tortellini Alfredo was good! I think that was my fave of the entrees brought to us. None of us tried their calzones or pizza, but we were close!

Their desserts: They only advertise one...their trifle. It is good, but not damn near as incredible as their version of the pizookie! I had a friend who wanted to make a baby with the cheesecake and their brownie with ice cream was respectable. Save room for dessert here...and just get the pizookie! Yum!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since 1975! Great pizza, wings & more. The service is great the family takes good care of you. 50th anniversary and still going good. Lunch special is 11-3 and what deals they have.  There is a line! Get there early....
 it's that good! Mama-mia good
Enjoy"}
{"text":"Bad management! Bad management! Bad management! One of the worst experiences we have ever had. Waited over an hour to be seated.The pizza is good! But the help is rude and embarrassing. Not worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Great place for old school pizza and wings.  Bare bones restaurant in dire need of updating, but good pizza.  While waiting for a table, I ordered a glass of house cab, not good, but I drank it anyway."}
{"text":"The best antipasto salad in the north valley. The pizza and calzones are also on point.  Not a fan of their pasta."}
{"text":"I would recommend this place to anyone who loves pizza and wings. Price is pretty good, not ridiculous like some Italian restaurants. Bring your friends!"}
{"text":"Damn! Ordered the peppers and sausage (without the pasta), and damned if it wasn't microwaved! I SENT IT BACK! My granddaughter had the cheese ravioli and the marinara sauce was inedible. The wife had shrimp alfredo and it was passable. The best thing we had was the antipasto, which was hugh and very fresh. The server was very courteous and attentive."}
{"text":"We've been talking about trying this place for over a year and finally came for dinner.  We had pizza and pasta and shared.  The pizza was delicious.  The pasta (tortellini alfredo) was ok - too much sauce.  I ate the broccoli, my husband ate the pasta.  Would definitely go back for pizza.  The place has a great ambiance for us - we thoroughly enjoyed it."}
{"text":"The pizza and wings here are pretty good. The wait time however is pretty long for Pizza. They are also a bit expensive. Anything besides the pizza and wings I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. The lighting in the booth where we sat was a little bit dim, however, since I was there for a birthday dinner with my boyfriend it made it seem romantic LOL 
we had planned on going there for my birthday and so I had gone online to the restaurants website a few days earlier to see what kind of coupons we could get. The only way to get the coupons is to sign up through email, and then the Coupons are emailed to you. But, I never got the coupons through my email. Fortunately, the waitress understood the situation, called over the manager right away, and the manager honored the coupon even though I didn't actually have it in my possession. That's really nice customer service. The portions are large enough that we had enough to take Home and have Leftovers for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Waited for a server then waited some more got tired of waiting then left. I wish I could give a review but didn't want to wait any longerrr"}
{"text":"We ordered a large pizza and hot wings. The pizza was too salty but the wings were delicious. We ordered out so cant say much about the service. They are pretty pricy$$$$, So if you are in the mood for some great hot wings this is the place to go, but if you want a great pizza I would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is the original, long standing Red Devil restaurant that has been in this location for many decades. When you walk in, you'll notice even the decor hasn't changed. This is affordable, Italian comfort food at its best. They also happen to make the best hot wings! (The pizza is not bad, either).

For some reason, their 'medium' hot wing sauce is a mixture of hot sauce and BBQ sauce. I think its disgusting. But the mild and hot are normal. However, for me the mild is just too mild and the hot is just too hot. Well, they also offer a 'New York Mild' which isn't quite medium, but is very flavorful with a hint of hot.

I recommend ordering the wings crispy, New York mild. Soooooo good!

I wish they would serve celery with the wings and I wish they served Coke instead of Pepsi. Those are my only complaints...

The staff is always friendly, there is never a long wait to receive your food after ordering and its not too difficult to get a table on a typical busy Phoenix Friday or Saturday night. And did I mention how affordable it is? 

10 wings = $7.99
1 soda = $2.49
1 Small Garden Salad: $3.59

Of course they have manicotti, ravioli, speghetti, etc... Lot's of Italian comfort food to choose from on the menu. This is my favorite place for wings!"}
{"text":"Love Red Devil.  Always ordered it for work events at Honeywell downtown.  Here however, I tried to order unsuccessfully online.  All website responded with is that delivery time selected is invalid.  Problem is, no place to enter a time anywhere.  So we called direct.  Then forwarded to takeout whereupon I was put on permanent hold.  End result to me was the message \" We don't care about your business \".  Well, message received."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Red Devil for over 10 years.  I've had almost everything on the menu and never a bad meal. Love the pizza  crust 
The service is excellent. See Travis in the bar!"}
{"text":"Went back a second time and oh my it was like night and day! 
Our service was outstanding and the food mmm mmm good!
We spoke with a wonderful woman by the name of Kathy who truly made sure we were fat and happy lol!

We dined on the Red Devil Supremo again and the kids pasta and the double baked lasagna.
Not to mention the Canoli oh man you have to try that!
The rolls were fresh and the butter just the right kind of melted! 
Our waitress was so bubbly and outgoing and seriously made us feel like family!
My husband had the red devil tai drink and said it was perfect! 
It's seriously going to become our weekend spot!
If your looking for your nonnas Italian cooking it can be found at Red Devil!!!

Thank you!!!!!"}
{"text":"Holiday lunched catered from this original Red Devil location.  
This is a favorite every year for the past 12 years with my employer and it's always consistent and so yummy.  
I look forward to next year's dinner,  but try to make the trek across town to enjoy this authentic Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Always delicious pizza and great service. We have been regulars at Red Devil for years."}
{"text":"Good pizza. 
  The sauce was better than a few of the other places I've tried, at least it wasn't sweet. But as U2 said, \" I still haven't found what I'm looking for.\"
  The crust was the high point of pie, very good. The service was great as well. Either they are going for a retro eighties look inside or they haven't remodeled in a long time. I personally care more about the food than the atmosphere, unless I'm on a date.
  I have been a manager at several pizza places in the distant past and(wouldn't) recommend their cheaper cheese blend.
  I will say that overall they were good and I would recommend them, but the sauce makes the pizza and their sauce is o.k., closer to authentic, but not quite there.
  I know (with my picture) that this place should be a favorite, but I have to keep looking for that great pizza place that seems to be alluding me here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Great service and good food, make for an excellent time. Cold beer and good drinks. Really enjoy this place"}
{"text":"I will give them credit in two areas: the family size salad is no joke. Like - it'll feed eight people.. it's seriously that big.

Number 2 is their pizza is on point. I've only had it once before coming for dine in and it was in the top five in town.

The house margarita however - has hot sauce in it - which is fine, but one should be reminded of that before preparing ones mouth for standard 'rita flavor. 

The main course, was about as basic as it gets. The pasta was still watery and the sauces were bland.

Service was solid - but if I ever eat here again it will be pick up or delivery pizza."}
{"text":"Kathy is the best, ,food fantastic and consistent. Clean, great pizza and pasta gotta try it.
We go every wednesday for pizza.
They accommodate special events in there private dining rooms"}
{"text":"Phoenix has some absolutely amazing Italian pizza joints. And when I'm in the mood to spend some extra money and wait a while I go to them.

But man alive! Red Devil is pretty close in terms of quality and it's a lot more laid back.

During our last visit, we sat in back. The space has several nice little tucked away areas so everywhere has a nice private feel. Our waitress was really nice and accomodating and was with us in just over a minute.

Some of the fancier drinks were recommended, but we were content with just plain old lemonade. Just the right balance of sweet and tangy.

The bruschetta arrived quickly fresh out of the oven. The oil and tomatoes were spilling over the top and had a very rich flavor.

The Italian pizza was just right temperature wise and the green olives added a nice salty kick to the sausage.

The prices are reasonable. The staff is great and the pizza is delicious. 

Plus we met a 6 year old in the parking lot who claimed to be a princess. How great is that?"}
{"text":"They are the best! Everything on the menu is fantastic. I've been coming here for years and I'd come more often if they weren't so far away, daily if I could afford it. They do delivery to my area now but stop 10 blocks away and I can't convince them to come a little further. We go there for special occasions because the whole family loves their food - 4 generations. Service is great, too. No complaints about anything and I'm very picky."}
{"text":"Oh Red Devil, how I missed you so.  I can't recall how long it has been since first experiencing pizza from Red Devil, but it has been a long time. I was in the area tonight and decided to hit the old place up with a buddy (fellow yelper Joey L.) of mine. Upon entering, I remembered the place like it was yesterday. How, you ask? That would be because it looks the same inside as it did a million years ago. That may bother a few, but I love the old time feel. It brings you back to going to a restaurant for the food and food only. As for the grub, my friend and I started by knocking out an order of 10 wings coated in their medium NY sauce. I had to ask our waitress what the sauce was made of because it was that good. She stated the sauce is a combo of hot sauce, butter, and vinegar. Whatever it was, I wanted more. For dinner we had the Devil Special Pizza, which included pepperoni, sausage, onion, green pepper, and mushroom. The pizza was great. The crust was soft and firm in all the right places; while the cheese was very cheesy, and the meat was very flavorful. Definitely one of the better pizzas I have had in some time. On a side note, the ranch provided for the wings was very good and was not watered down as many pizza joints seem to do these days. Since I use ranch on my pie, it's a big deal to this guy. Overall, a very nice meal."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. Occasionaly they wont get all the order right but i think the food is well worth going there for."}
{"text":"About as average as they come - we came here for pasta (with a coupon) and it filled our bellies.  The place had a very \"been here since the 80's vibe\", which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  I left with neither a strong urge to return nor a reason to complain.  The pizza the other couple was eating looked like it might have more potential though, so maybe I'll give Red Devil another try the next time a Valupak shows up in my mailbox."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for over 38 years and I have never been disappointed. The service continues to be excellent and the pizza is 2nd to none! Whether you're ordering out, hanging in the bar or grabbing a booth you cannot go wrong!"}
{"text":"I wanted to thank you for such a wonderfully good time with my family the other day. We were gathering to honor our aunt who passed away a few days prior. Your restaurant has always been a friendly gathering place for my family in good times and bad. We call it \"comfort pizza\". The service was very patient with our sometimes rowdy group, and the food was terrific as always. I had arrived quite early from out of town and killed some time in your bar. A special thank you for the great service from Stephanie. She made a very difficult time fly by. I'm so glad we met there.

{"text":"Let me tell you about my little friend the bruschetta.
The skinny 
I can't comment enough about the bruschetta it's a little slice of heaven. Not to gas you up so much I am not a big fan of bruschetta so I never order it, on a date night with my gf she ordered it and to my surprise they brought a good helping more than my gf could handle and wow! The bread was nice a toasted with a garlic cheese butter and they add fresh cold chopped tomato with fresh cut basil with a little olive oil. The pizza is great sauce taste as it should and they don't use the generic cheeses and ingredients, plus they always have great specials online and on social media. The wings are also great big and tasty with lots of sauce which I find it comparable to long wongs med sauce. 
The bad
Pretty common thing for me with parking but this is particularly a bad area to park and not the greatest of areas especially at night have seen some seedy people. 
Overall this place is a Phoenix staple and great for dates I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Stopped for a beer and food to go... smaller bar area but cozy and Cheers like : )"}
{"text":"After recently visiting La Grande Orange in Phoenix, La Bocca in Tempe, and The Parlor in Phoenix, I can honestly say I have had much better pizza than Red Devil. 

Four of us came here last week for a birthday dinner, and I honestly just wasn't impressed. We ordered the Italian Special and the Greekfest, and both were overloaded with toppings and falling apart, and overall not too flavorful. Olives were everywhere, and if you are only a partial olive fan, it isn't too great. 

Plus side- the service was very good and I had a cup of the soup that was decent.

overall probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Came for the first time to meet some friends. 
Had pizza. It was really yummy. Great service too
Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Zero stars. Just awful!

I don't get it. The food was gross, the cocktails were very acidic, service was ok. 

The pizza is terrible. The dough is like cardboard. The bruschetta was soggy.

Eww!

I guess if I grew up in Northern Mexico I might think it's good. I've had pizza there, and its inedible so..."}
{"text":"Cardboard crust pizza. Umm, no thanks.
Two different cocktails...tasted exactly the same....and not good. Very sour and off-putting. The food was very below average. We had bruschetta, and pizza along with spaghetti with clam sauce. 

Gross-gross-gross- and gross.

Will DEFINITELY NOT be going back. And would never recommend to anyone. Gross!!"}
{"text":"Oh nice! Fresh crispy pizzza . Fresh out of the oven ( homemade ) like. 2$ IPA PALE ALE. Service is friendly , I like little places that treat you with lots of love :-)."}
{"text":"First time and last. Ordered a large pizza w/ pepperoni sausage and mushroom and an order of lasagna. Pizza crust was very thin and not what I was expecting. Mushrooms were fresh but for an $18 pizza I was expecting better. The lasagna was tasty but I swear there was one noodle in the whole dish; it was more like a blob of meat sauce and cheese. I was expecting more for the $29.20 ."}
{"text":"Would have given 5 but I didn't like the lighting. We went on National Pizza Day!! Great pizza! Great service! Had an awesome lunch. No wait time for table and not a lengthy wait time for our pizza. They have lunch specials you can choose from. Will go back again!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Pizza !! Great Selection of Wines and Beer !!! Pretty extensive menu and Great Comfortable Setting !!!"}
{"text":"The last time I came here for lunch it was a disaster.  The pizza was super slow and when it finally arrived it was burnt.   Decided to give them another try since I was in the neighborhood.   The lunch menu hasn't changed and it still has the same dishes - most of which are pretty heavy for a quick lunch.  You can get a small cheese pizza on the lunch menu but no substitutions so no pepperoni pizza.

The dining room is pretty dingy but the bar isn't half bad - which is clearly why everyone sits in the bar.

This time service was much better but the food was so so.  

This place was one of the first I can recall to serve a white pizza and it was decent."}
{"text":"I love this place...best pizza in Phoenix- hands down! Wings are amazing, service is always phenomenal. I simply love this restaurant. I have to admit that I may be a bit biased as this place holds a lot of sentimental value to me. My family and I have eaten here for years and years. At this point- 4 generations worth, that I know for sure, have dined at and loved Red Devil. My husbands favorite is the sausage and artichoke pizza- while mine is the Red Devil combo. We always split an order of medium wings and get bigger then we know we will eat- pizza so we can have some to bring home. 

This restaurant also does well balancing the \"family friendly\" with the \"date night\" crowds. I will say that we live much closer to the Mesa (Tempe?) location and have gone there 4-5 times...completely not the same. Yes, same-ish food, but the other location just simply does not have it like the McDowell one. Dont waste your time at the other one- just go to the McDowell location and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Decent food and service. Love the idea of the drive thru window. Server was very nice. Small little cute bar"}
{"text":"Ordered from Red Devils through Doordash and asked for their ravioli with alfredo sauce substituted for the standard marinara. I asked them to contact me if there were any issues with the order. No one called to ask about the order. When the food came it arrived with marinara sauce. So I called them to see if I could get a refund and also inform them of the issue so they can prevent it from happening in the future. The manager informed me that there was an up-charge for substituting the alfredo, so they decided to give me the marinara instead of calling to ask me my preference as I had instructed them to do. He then proceeded to tell me that although, it was their fault there was nothing they would do to rectify the situation. He told me I had to contact Doordash. I asked him if he had the number for Doordash and he told me no then hung up on me. He was extremely dismissive of the mistake, never apologized, never indicated that they were going to do anything different in the future and then hung up on me in the middle of the call.

tl;dr: The food is edible and their prices are what you would expect for the food quality. However, their service is lacking. Don't modify online orders, they won't do it and they will make no attempt to fix incorrect orders.

Reply to Comment: As my review stated, I already called the restaurant and customer satisfaction is clearly not your priority since the MANAGER told me to get someone else to fix the problem and then hung up on me. Furthermore, your offer to \"make it up to me\" does nothing to address the actual issue: the way your company handles online orders and the manner in which your employees and managers treat their customers."}
{"text":"This place was not good. Pretty bland it must have been what I ordered. Didn't care for the pizza"}
{"text":"First time we got this I was so excited to try the eggplant Parmesan. I got it, bit into it, and it had the most disgusting ground beef ever inside. I don't eat meat - hence the ordering of plain eggplant Parmesan. This time they did apologize and give a credit and a new meal which was great...... fast forward to now, today, we decided to give it another try. The driest wings in all existence were delivered to us and the pizza was very tough. We called to let them know that we were dissatisfied and we were met with nothing but rudeness. I get it. No one likes to hear complaints. But as someone who also works in retail/customer service as a manager, you take the complaints and grow from them and make the customer happy. You don't basically accuse them of lying by saying \"well no one else has complained about the food so I'm not giving you a refund.\" Just frustrating."}
{"text":"Best Pizza In Arizona! Great service. My favorite dive!"}
{"text":"Man-oh-man, this place is da bomb! 

The So and I came in on a Wednesday night after slamming a few Long Islanders at the bar next door, so we were geared up for some serious grubbing. We were seated immediately and greeted by our server Alberto. Wow, this guy had a golden personality and was working his station like a champ. He was making great conversation with every table and attended to us like royalty. 

We ordered the fried zucchini & mushroom plate and a medium pepperoni pizza. The friend zucchini and shrooms were very tasty and we were provided plenty of ranch for dipping. 
Our pizza was delivered to our table still bubbling and with a warning from Alberto, \"Now you two take it easy, this pizza is Super HOT and I can tell you from experience because I no longer have the roof of my mouth, Enjoy\". So I lifted the toasty-melty-saucy slice up to my face, hoisted it into my mouth, sank my fangs into it, and almost fainted with pleasure. I swear I could hear Lou Rawls singing in my ear as I worked my way down the slice to the crust. 

This was one hell of a Pizza and a great price to boot. Dinner (Appetizer, Pizza, and Root Beer) for two under 20 bucks. I may have to give in and be a repeat offender next week. Oh well, I'll just tell them the Devil made me do it."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with a friend. We love the quick, hot, and good lunch. She had the chicken parm, it came with a salad and pasta. She was super happy with the food. I got the white pizza with sausage. It was good, but I was missing the tomato sauce on my pizza, so I guess I am not a white pizza girl. White pizza = cheese and oil olive. I love their classic pizza = cheese and tomato sauce. It was more than enough for lunch. YUM. The server was awesome, love her."}
{"text":"You can either dine in or wait outside and order at the order window that is situated outside. While you waiting you can either get a drink at the bar inside or take a short walk to the other bar connected to the restaurant in the back. The waiter service is always great every time I have come here and we always sit in the back in the larger part of the restaurant. It is kinda divey in here as there are no windows, it is just a brick built restaurant and the general atmosphere is dim. However this is good comfort food, the pizza is so good and they use quality ingredients for everything. They also make their own beer which was surprisingly pretty good."}
{"text":"My husband, son and I stopped in for lunch. It was our first time visiting this Italian restaurant. We were given a choice of where we wanted to sit by a very friendly hostess. We chose to sit in a booth next to the bar.
We were given menus along with the lunch menu advertising their specials by number. A very dynamic and cheerful waitress came to our table, took our drink order and upon returning with our drinks, she made some suggestions for the chicken wings/sauce because I was interested in ordering the two slices of cheese pepperoni pizza with 5 bone in wings.
My son ordered the Caesar Salad with 2 slices of pepperoni pizza. My husband and I ordered the same except we chose the  bone in chicken wings tossed in a mild buffalo sauce.
We waited approximately 15 minutes and our food was served. My son had already ate most of his freshly made Caesar Salad that was served while we waited for the rest of our lunch to be prepared. 
We all agreed the food was excellent. The wings were crispy and flavorful with just the right amount of sauce that was not overwhelming--so I could taste the wings and enjoy them. The pizza was dripping with glorious cheese and big savory pepperonis.
Everything was hot and fresh. Our waitress brought out hot rolls with whipped butter too. She was very engaging, she checked on us, refilled our drinks and made sure we enjoyed our food/visit. 
We will be returning in the near future."}
{"text":"The pizza and wing deal is not on the menu but they do offer it! It's a must when I come here!"}
{"text":"Red Devil is our go to pizza place when we want good delicious pizza. We just ordered for take out and are heading home now when we realised.... yelp needs to hear about how eager we are to eat these. I personally have been dreaming about this moment all week.  I am not from Phoenix but visit frequently, and on nearly every visit I grab a pie from Red Devil.  The pizza is delicious and the guy at the window taking money is one of the nicest guys! Every time we go here and pick up our pizza he had a huge grin on his face.  I comment about how polite he is each time!  This place is to die for - gotta check them out!"}
{"text":"5+ We love Red Devil!  The pizza is our favorite in the Valley!  We were bummed when the West Valley location closed; however, on our way to look at Christmas lights in East Valley we stopped in.

The wait was said to be about 25 minutes; however, we were seated within 20 minutes.  On a Saturday evening around 7:00 PM."}
{"text":"19 times out of 20 when we get Red Devil it's pizza and it's take out.  The pizza a really good and perfect take out.  If I had to be critical I'd say it can be a tad greasy, but its good pizza.

In the dining room the Italian food is really good.  The Chicken parm is perfect and all the dishes are quality with generous portions.  

If you want classic Italian you can't go wrong at Red Devil (and that goes for all the locations)"}
{"text":"My favorite style of food is easily italian and I especially love alfredo and pizza w/ wings.  Red Devil has that and more!  I was skeptical about going.  I drive by it all the time and it just kept calling my name.  FInally one night we decided to try it out.  SO glad we did.  I have been 5 times in less than 2 months!  If I could afford it I'd go more often.  One amazing thing they have and that you automatically get is their bread.  It tastes sooooo good and it is hard only eat one, I always get full on them.  Then I get their salad.  They have the BEST italian dressing!!!  Next I get the wings hot.  They are so scrumptious!  Then I have had the spaghetti, alfredo, pizza, and penne.  All of the above were so good.  I always want to go to Red Devil and my boyfriend has to remind me to mix it up.  But if I could I would go once a week.  It is a place that I feel like I am at home.  It is because of the food, the wait staff, the friendliness and the food!"}
{"text":"Great food and a good family atmosphere. Too bad they don't open on Sundays. I would imagine that Sundays could be one the most profitable days so I don't understand the concept behind it."}
{"text":"Something about the pizza is just delicious. The cheese has that perfect melt to it, the crust isn't burnt or rubbery. The wings have that great mixture of tang and vinegar. Would have given more starts- but the customer service desperately needs work. Sat for close to 25 minutes before anyone came to ask if we needed drinks or had been helped. Plenty of servers walked past our table and saw us just sitting and staring waiting to be helped. Asked a waitress who passed us if we could order since we where ready and was told \"we'll get you your server to take your order,\" and did it happen? No. Was there an apology? No. The staff acted as if the customer was bother. Not a busy night for them either."}
{"text":"Although the wait was long, it was well worth it.  We ordered the pizza and wings. My husband ordered a small salad and it was freshly made. The pizza was half cheese for the kids and half supreme for the parents.  Thin crust but not too thin.  Great tasting sauce and all the veggies were fresh on it.  Thoroughly enjoyed by all. We ordered traditional medium wings and even the kids thought they were tasty.  The staff was friendly and kept the drinks full.  I almost forgot to take a picture before all the food was gone.  Yum!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. I have been going here for years. The pizza is great and they have so many toppings. This place does deliver and they also have a pick up window on the outside of the building in front so you don't have to go inside to pick up your order. I have had so many things so ill make it quick. The red marinara here is good traditional. Its a nice red color with a hint of herbs and Parmesan. They also have a meat sauce that's good. I order the fettuccine with Alfredo, chicken, and broccoli often. The stuffed rigatoni are great as are the ravioli. The other thing I like about red devil is its not over priced like so many Italian restaurants. The food is consistently good here and the prices are right. They have sandwiches and salads as well and of course dessert. I'm always to full to get dessert here."}
{"text":"For how good the food is I'm surprised this place isn't always packed.  Great pizza and wings,  they make their own blue cheese which I really enjoy as well.  It can be a bit pricey which may keep the best deal hunters away but we'll worth the money in my opinion."}
{"text":"Took over two hours to get our food, then the manager was rude to us for asking where our food is. What a joke! Food finally trickled out one plate at a time about 2 hours in, along with the avalanche of attitude and excuses. Won't be back again!"}
{"text":"We ate here for lunch today.  They had several lunch specials.  I had the spaghetti and meatballs.  My wife the pizza.  Wow, it was absolutely fantastic!!!  I had minestrone and it was the best I've ever had.  The spaghetti sauce was like mama used to make.  The service was great and friendly.  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"While the wings were great when ordered crispy, the pizza is disappointing. It has almost no sauce and tastes like elementary school cafeteria pizza. I gave this place a second chance and both times the pizza was super gross. Both times I ordered pizza from Red Devil, I ended up with painful stomach aches the following day. If it weren't for their only redeemable qualities (the atmosphere and the wings), I would give one star. If you're looking for the same quality pizza for a cheaper price, I recommend Little Ceaser's."}
{"text":"Forget the frou-frou \"best in the country\" BS hype. You know were I'm talking about. 
 
This is as close as you can get to real pizza downtown-ish. All they are missing is the red checkerboard tablecloths. Red Devil could be in Anytown NJ or NY and fit right in.

No Rays are nearby... Red Devil is a close 2nd. Their wings are great, too, as is the lasagna."}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings!  I love the food here but the service is lacking and the beer selection is circa 1980.  Get it to go???"}
{"text":"Ok, did they use Nacho Cheese on my $17.00 pasta dish? That's what it tasted like. Pasta Florentine should be called Pasta Quarantine...I guess I could go one step up and say that what ever that sauce was tasted like melted Velvita cheese. It was one or the other according to my taste buds. It was goopy and gross.  Husband said his Veal Parmesean was completely flavorless. Son said his Chicken Broccoli Alfredo was boring and over cooked. We probably spent $75.00+ on one of the worst Italian meals we've ever had. We'll stick with the pizza from now on...it's pretty good. But every pasta dish I've had there is over priced and completely misses the whole idea of good Italian food. I cook much better than that!! Why do I keep trying just one more time? Ugh.... Never again. Too many other places to eat with good Italian dishes now days. Took more than half home because I couldn't eat one more bite without feeling disgust for wasting my money. Most likey will toss it in about two days."}
{"text":"This place hires a bunch of scrubs right from the sewer. Trying to pick up a pizza and you're a young female? Good luck not getting picked up on and \"cat called\"... 

Hire more competent and respectful workers and step to plate when making a simple cheese pizza and i may order here again!"}
{"text":"Great service. Their pizza and cheese bread is delicious. We came here with my special needs child who ended up having a meltdown. The staff and surrounding customers were not bothered. When I asked for our food to go due to not wanting to disrupt everyone's dinner around us, the server asked if we were sure and that we did not have to leave. We still took our food to go, but it was a wonderful feeling for the server tell us we did not have to leave due to my child's meltdown. I did not want to be disrespectful to those around us."}
{"text":"This is always a good pick for family Italian restaurant.  They have some of the best pasta and pizza is very good."}
{"text":"While in Phoenix I had to stop in at my favorite Italian restaurant. I sat in the lounge and ordered the homemade tiramisu. The pizza is gourmet and the reason they have been in business since 1960. I have brought many people here just to try the bread and butter."}
{"text":"The hostess didn't acknowledge us, she just stayed on phone while we stood. Finally someone came from the back to seat us in the nearly empty restaurant. I said \"Thank you.\" She instantly shot back curtly, \"I can dish out attitude too!\" Taken by surprise I retorted, \"If you think that was attitude you've never seen attitude.\" Believe me, there wasn't any intention to give her attitude, after all she helped us as soon as she saw us, so I was happy with her. In any case, it was an unprofessional way to deal with the situation.

It took about 10 minutes for our actual waiter to come to ask us what we wanted to drink. Still he answered our questions well, even if they didn't turn out to be 100% factual, he helped stear our decisions. There were spicy honey wings that we were interested in, but I can't stand the chilli vinegar taste/smell of buffalo sauce...I asked him, \"Is it light on the buffalo and heavy on the honey?\" he answered yes. INCORRECT. Probably the strongest buffalo tasting/smelling chicken I've even been close to. I had to push it further to the other side of the table to keep my eyes from watering.

Oh and Faux news...err I mean Fox not-really News was playing on the TV in the bar :/

Lame. I'm not going back."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. The food is great - consistently! Classic, old-time atmosphere. Very family friendly. Love it!"}
{"text":"Food was ok but service was very poor because we had to wait for everything and we will not go back again"}
{"text":"The service was excellent, the soup was outstanding.  I would have preferred softer bread or roll. It was a first time visit but looking forward to more. Want to try a pasta dish."}
{"text":"While the front doesn't look like much, the food and service are great.  The antipasti salad, wings and pizza are fantastic!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place and I have only been once. I live right down the street and I kept passing it and I kept telling myself \"I know that place has gotta be good\" and I'm so glad I found out. It's got a really old school Italian place feel. Lights very dim with that old school bar in the dining area. They even got a pinball machine that steals your quarters and a racing game from the 80s by the front door. I'm surprised I didn't hear Joe Pesci and Robert Deniro laughing a table away. The menu is huge but this time I just got the calzone classic with added pepperoni and it was really good. I loved the dough and the cheese to bread ratio was great. The service was great to. Like I said it's an old school kind of place so the waitress had to be amazing. My wife got the barbecue chicken pizza which in a place like this I was surprised to see it on the menu but hey this is Arizona so you got to cater to the local taste. Everything was great and I'll be back to further this review and try more of the expanded menu."}
{"text":"It isn't trendy.  It isn't fancy.  The chef isn't famous.  It is just plain good.

I like Red Devil.  It is one of those places where ordering way too much pizza on purpose in order to enjoy it again for lunch the next day is perfectly normal and A-OK.  The service is consistently friendly, attentive, and happy to offer menu suggestions.  

I can't comment on their wide variety of main dishes (which all look appetizing), because I can never tear myself away from the pizza.  What goes great with that pizza?  The Antipasto salad is fantastic - loaded with meats, cheese and even my favorite artichoke hearts.  A small is more than ample for two people to share.  Save some of that Italian dressing (presented on the side) to use as a dipping sauce for your pizza crust.  Instant breadsticks!  Speaking of pizza, Red Devil's graces a thin yet doughy crust with tangy sauce and generous evenly-distributed toppings.  My favorite, pepperoni and mushroom, tastes wonderful when re-heated for lunch the next day too!

Go, sit in one of the bar's padded booths.  Enjoy an adult beverage or two (there are typically drink specials of some kind or another) and order a pizza big enough to take some home.  :)"}
{"text":"Our family is so very disappointed with Tempe Red Devil, I tried them again about 2 months ago, the pizza is just not the same at all.  Red Devil in Phoenix and I hear in the White Mountains is awesome too.  I ordered take out, and the box was soooooo light, the crust used to be the best with bubbles and a chewy crispy taste, now its hard and super super thin, which I love a thin crust, but the edges are hard as a rock, although  the sauce is still my favorite, but hardly any cheese.  We haven't been back since, I did call about a year ago and speak to a manager, she said absolutely nothing has changed, well it has when your kids beg you to drive them to phoenix Red Devil.  They are going to loose a lot of business over being cheap and changing the crust to nothing.  My parents took me to Red Devil in Phoenix when I was a baby over 50 years ago, please Tempe Red Devil go back to the origional recipe."}
{"text":"I've been going to red Devils in the 70s they got a good pizza but after last night something changed , they did something to the crust which taste like Peter piper, and between drinks and pizza it's about 40 bucks that's 40 Bucks Way too much for pizza that's fair, I just have to find some new I think"}
{"text":"Had another great dinner at Red Devil.  We come every year for my daughter's birthday.  Food is great and we enjoy their friendly, warm atmosphere.  Was able to spend some time talking with Sheriff Joe and his lovely wife.  Overall a wonderful night!"}
{"text":"We had 20 mild BBQ wings and the large salad. Everything was awesome! You can't beat the great service from Debbie either. She is by far the best waitress we've experienced in a long time! So refreshing! Thanks and we'll be back!!!"}
{"text":"LOOOOVE their pizza and ranch! They have delivery, take out & dine in options. Nice sized calzones too"}
{"text":"Horrible customer service, ordered delivery and nothing was correct. Seemed like everyone employed here would rather be anywhere else. Will not recommend and will never return to any red devil establishment."}
{"text":"First time there and the place was packed. Cozy atmosphere, friendly staff, but the lightinf was kind of dim. It was difficult to see your food and the menu. We order pizza and l ordered egglant parmesean. I had to return my meal because it tasted burnt. After getting anothet eggplant parmesan, it was all good. I loved the bread. We will eat here again when we visit this area again."}
{"text":"This place is awful. We went on a Friday night. It was not crowded. We sat in the bar. We started out with 10 wings. When they came they were burnt crisp. Why anybody including the waitress would send anything out like that to customer is beyond me. The waitress reluctantly took them back and made us another order. They were better but not great. Then we went onto order individual pizzas. I ordered the Red Devil White my husband ordered a pepperoni. When I received my pizza it had hardly any cheese on it there was 4 in of crust. I told the waitress about it, she said that's the way the Red Devil white is. I told her no I've eaten several of them and that's not how they are. Then the manager came over and was talking so loud it was embarrassing. She is very loud, and acts like she is a person that works in Human Resources instead of the manager of a restaurant. I have eaten here several times I have never received a pizza that look like that. We really love the Red Devil in Phoenix. When we got the bill they charge doesn't double for the wine. Didn't discount anything. Not that I expected them to and I was not looking for free no I was looking for a good meal. I will never eat there again."}
{"text":"I have never had Red Devil before and an so glad that I tried it! I ordered a pizza and added my own ingredients! This is one of the best pizzas I've ever eaten!"}
{"text":"Have stopped into this Red Devil location a couple of times now.  My first visit was better than my second and while I'm giving the place 3 stars, I'll go back again.  

I'm really pretty easy to please.   Give me a place that has good wings and cold beer and I'm happy.  Well, I know, I know, most people probably don't go to Red Devil for wings, but my eyes went to them on my first visit and again on my second.   And those eyes were much larger than my stomach on my 2nd visit, so it was wings for dinner the next night too.   Anyway, the \"hot\" wings and the bbq wings are my fav.  With a side of \"hot\" sauce and ranch.  The hot is not really hot, but it tastes good.  And they're priced right and the wings are really pretty hearty.   They're good wings.   I really need to order something else on the menu next time! 

And the beer is cold ;)  But don't order sparkling wine.  J. Roget is your only option.  Trust me ladies, don't order it.   

I like Red Devil."}
{"text":"Closest I can get to east coast pizza in PHX. Good price, quick and a well done crust. Hold the ranch ya jabronies!"}
{"text":"We wanted some quick take out and decided to hit up Red Devil las night.  We got a sausage pizza togo.  Honestly it was just ok, I wouldnt say anything amazing, but not horrible either.  Pinos on central is our first choice and Red Devil wont win out over Pinos."}
{"text":"This is where I go for take out pizza.  I generally get the large pizza and wing special listed in the Value=Pak mailers I get at home.  The pizza is the best part.  The pizza is NY thin crust style, but the crust is crispy and the pizza dough has a unique yeast taste that is the difference maker between Red Devil and other pizza joints in the area.  It is these small differences that make good food great food.  The wings are meaty and tasty but are not as superior to the pizza.  

As for inside the restaurant, cant say.  As I said before, I get the pizza and wings as takeout."}
{"text":"I could stay with one star, but the thin crust for a pizza is worth a 2nd star. 

Right away when we arrived, there was water spilled in the floor, we waited and waited until we had to go and look somebody to \"sit\" us. When we left, the water in the floor was still there :O.

People comes here mainly for pizza. SERIOUSLY!?? I stick to my Humble Pie. The rest of \"italian\" food seems overpriced and I had to take a look around to other tables to confirm I was not missing anything special. Improvement is a word they should review each day."}
{"text":"On a Friday night when you don't feel like going out but you don't feel like cooking either, get Red Devil take-out!

Red Devil offers your standard italian fare - pizza, pasta, calzones. Boyfriend and I settled on sausage pizza, BBQ wings and an order of fried zucchini and mushrooms for out Friday night take-out pig-out. 

The pizza is good - lot of toppings and cheese. You can get ricotta cheese too for some extra yum. The wings were pretty good. We were hoping for more of a honey BBQ type wing but these are more like a spicy BBQ wing - good just not really what we were hoping for. And the fried zucchini and mushrooms were tasty, but really how could they not be?

We had leftover pizza and honestly it was even better the next day so make sure you get enough for leftovers!

The one downside was the price - it ain't cheap. For those three items our order was over $30. For an occasional take-out treat however, it's worth it."}
{"text":"I have been eating here for 30 years and the pizza is consistently good. Have had troubke at there southern & tempe location but as it seems it's their franchised location. Trying me, visit the original, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I haven't been since 2014, just because however the time that I did go it was still really good and I decided to go in again yesterday and it was still great ! The food was delicious and the staff was super nice and courteous. Will be going back!"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza!!! Excellent service!!! We drove out here from chandler for my brothers birthday dinner tonight and so glad we did . Our waitress was so good. The restaurant was packed but she did her job so well. High 5 sister ! Our food was so so good. We had hot wings, and fried zucchini for appetizers, both were tasty . Then for dinner we had a white pizza , pepperoni pizza, a red devil special pizza, a chicken Parmesan sandwich with fries, and a kiddo cheeseburger . We all were so satisfied with everything. The pizza was piping hot and the crust was so tender . Man, this really hit the spot."}
{"text":"There very few Restaurants in Arizona that have been around for decades. That's right decades!! 50 years is no flash in the pan, in fact most restaurants fail to see a 20th birthday. There is a reason why Red Devil continues to grow throughout Arizona and the reason is quality. Everything is fresh. The pizza is awesome. I was born in Brooklyn, NY and I do really like pizza. I won't compore this to NY pizza because it is not. That being said I find it just as good as any pie I have ever had in NYC. The pizza stands alone! I have never had pizza that compares to Red Devil. The crust is not to thin and not to thick. One of my favorite parts is the outer crust, it's lite, it's got a little fluff and has a chew to it that makes it very unique and very delicious!!! All components to this pie are fresh. You can watch them \"open\" a pizza crust. That means you can stand in front of the pizza window and watch them take a giant dough ball and turn it into pizza crust by slapping it and throwing it in the air. 
So the Pizza is excellent; But how about the rest. What Red Devil does well is stay away from pretentiousness. The dishes are classic, simple and don't come out wearing sequins. I know what I'm getting when I dine here. The food speaks for itself. Like I said, it's Chicken Parmigian and I love it for what's on the inside!! The marsala dishes are very good. I will say that the Alfredo here is some of the best I have ever had. The only problem is that sometimes this sauce can \"break\" that happens when the butter and heavy cream seperate. When that has happened they take it back and make a new dish. The bottom line is this place is very good and continues to prove it by staying aroound through 3 recessions and continuing to grow. You can't do that without having something people want over and over again!! 
 This Location happens to be a FRANCHISE and at times tends to be very different from the other locations that as far as I am aware are family owned!!"}
{"text":"I recently found out that this FAMILY OWNED restaurant has been in AZ for 50 years. Are you kidding?! That is incredible for a restaurant; + it is not a chain. I really am not so shocked though. This place is so consistent. Enough talk about how one pizza place taste like New York. Really, stop it! I am from Brooklyn, NY and there is NO pizza in Arizona that comes close to tasting like New York pizza does. That is not a bad thing either. I'll tell you why. There is not a pizza joint in New York that tastes anything like a Red Devil Pizza. We truly are blessed to have pizza this good and unique in Arizona. Now, it has taken 50 years to open only 5 stores. I think the Bistro is the newest location. Whatever they want to call it is fine, it is still a Red Devil."}

{"text":"No words! After a comedy of errors of having two restaurants closed on Monday in the neighborhood we ended up here. The outside of the restaurant gave us pause, but I wasn't in the mood to go find something else besides a fast food place, which there are ample in that neighborhood, we should have. This place has been around for ages so it must be good, right? Wrong! 

We ordered a 10 inch pizza with tomato and spinach, a cup of soup and a chicken parmesan sandwich. The waitress dumped the whole cup of soup in my lap when she brought it to the table. Granted, she apologized and I didn't make a fuss. She said she would not charge for the soup and brought a new cup. She charged for the soup anyway and I ended up with a dry cleaning bill. Great customer service it was not! 

My guest remarked that Campbell's soup was much better than what he was served. The soup was bland to say the least. I love pizza and this was not good pizza. The outside crust of my pizza was crisp, however when you picked up the pizza the slice immediately fell down, even when folding the slice. The bottom of the pizza towards the center was totally uncooked and soggy. I barely touched my pizza and left most of it behind. My guest's sandwich was a dry roll with very little sauce and the chicken. He ate the chicken and left everything else also. 

This was perhaps one of my worst restaurant experiences ever. I do not understand the ratings of others here, unless we got the amateurs at lunch and the real cook comes out at dinner time. I did not enjoy leaving the restaurant hungry, with tomato stains all over my pants and shirt."}
{"text":"Always heard this was a great place to eat.
1. Waited for a person to seat us for over 10 minutes with no one in the front part of restaurant. 
We finally got seated and they sat is back by the kitchen door where it was so noisy that ruined the atmosphere of the dinning experience. 
We ordered and asked for suggestions. Well, the dish we ordered was Luke warm and the breaded chicken was so hard that we left it behind to throw away. The pizza was undercooked and the dough was so flimsy that we left and went home and made a salad because it was so late to eat raw uncooked dough. Very disappointed and will never go back or recommend to my family or friends."}
{"text":"I love red devil pizza. The pizza is always hot and fresh. I mostly do carry out and they never disappoint hot pizza and crispy fresh wings."}
{"text":"I am not sure what happened here in the valley to make this place popular enough to have TV commercials...but, it was not something that is good! 

I am from the east coast, so all you east coast haters go ahead and hate (I am not going back there, I want everyone to have good food...evreywhere). If one of these opened in New York, the syndicates would burn it down as a mercy killing. It would be too poorly executed to exist. 

I am not sure whether that was Marinara sauce, but that's kinda the issue isn't it. The chicken on the Chicken Parmigiana might have been some sort of tender at some point, that's kinda the issue isn't it though. 

Its as if whoever owns this place worked at Denny's or IHOP and figured their cost cutting measures would work just as well for Italian food...

Whatever, I look forward to this place going under. Seems too many 'native' Phoenicians have fond memories of coming here when they were kids with their relatives though. Let it go already. Will you stop eating crap just because of nostalgia?"}
{"text":"Meh. Ok pizza. Mediocre salad. Liked the rolls, and the service was friendly and very prompt. Not in the best part of town, and seems to be a pretty old establishment."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. And I haven't even received my food yet, but it's been so bad that I need to leave a 1 star before I go crazy.

We were told a ten to fifteen minute wait. It was 40 minutes. Waiting was in the bar with super loud, rude, obnoxious people. 

After 35 minutes, the hostess sat another group who came in after us. Did I mention I was with my mother and 4 month old baby? When we were finally sat, the waitress was nice but SLLLOOWWWW. We put in orders for waters and 2 beers. They came out in about 15 minutes. While we were waiting for drinks and food, we saw another party get up and leave. The clueless manager shook her head and said, \"why would anyone leave?\". If you had bothered to stop at our table and talk to us (even though you talked to the tables around us?), you would have known. 

My wife ordered some fried mushrooms and zucchini. Below average to pretty bad. Her salad was eh. We got a standard pizza, and it was bad. Soggy in the middle, too dry on the crust. The sauce was mediocre and the sausage was pretty gross. 

It was just a bad overall experience. Do NOT go here."}
{"text":"Would have been nice if we actually got the food. We called to place it girl answered and said hang on ill transfer you, few mins later another girl answers giving us a number to call. Why does one tell us we can be transferred and another gives us a different number? But my real problem was we did eventually call the right number and the guy told us 25 to 30 mins. We get there and they haven't even started it.  My suggestion if you don't want to wait for over an hr for carryout go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Just had the best meatball sub ever from here, take-out. This place always has people picking up and dining in. Old-school Italian still appeals."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped in here at around 6:00 on a Saturday night. There was a host who led us down a weirdly long hallway to the dining room with a lot of old people, families, and TV. We immediately felt out of place. It was like an 80s sitcom. 

But our waitress arrived quickly and took our orders. We shared the fried zucchini, I had the Alfredo, and my friend had the chicken lasagna. The food came out relatively quickly. 

The zucchini was amazing and fried to perfection. Then we had the soup that came with the pasta. I had the minestrone and she had the Italian wedding. The flavor was OK but the noodles were so soft they disintegrated in my mouth. Next came out pastas. The size was pretty underwhelming considering the price but I figured it'd be okay if it tastes good... Which it did not. The sauce was not rich or flavorful and it pains me to say that I think they used jarred sauce or at least mixed it with their own sauce. Either way it just wasn't great. I'm not sure how the lasagna was but she didn't complain. We also got bread rolls that tasted okay but the outside was like a rock. Service was friendly though so that combined with the zucchini gives this place 3 stars. 

I might come back but just for the pizza and wings (and zucchini) which everyone else in the restaurant was eating."}
{"text":"Wow tried the bread today and soup the rolls remind me of grandma's . Had my chicken piccata today always top notch. Tried strawberry cheese cake today  , better than cheese cake factory."}
{"text":"Service was ok.  Decor was ok.  Cleanliness was ok.  Food was bland but there was a lot of it.  Maybe their pizza is better?  Ambiance was great for a date night, but I probably won't be back because it was a forgettable visit.  The waiter disappeared after serving our food.  We finally had to track down another server for a to go box and the check."}
{"text":"I walked in with my family and we waited to be seated...for 10 min! Employees saw us there and just ignored us and kept going about their business. I fully understand if they're slammed and running around, but a \"we'll be right with you\" goes a long way and we didn't get any of that. We just got blown off. We were all hungry and this was totally unacceptable. We left and went down the street to Venezia's. They were friendly and wanted our business."}
{"text":"Good pizza. Great crispy and chewy crust. Not too thin not too thick. Good sauce good selection of toppings. Love their peppercinis they are nice and spicy. It is a usual for me and my family for pizza."}
{"text":"I am flabbergasted by the reviews on here... I cannot figure out for the life of me how there are so many great reviews.  

This was the third place we tried to go but since it was 6pm the day after Christmas, there were ridiculously long waits elsewhere.  Walked in here and it was totally dead.  Hostess was really nice, as was the waitress.  We started with an order of mozzarella sticks and were very impressed with the sticks as well as both the ranch and marinara sauce.  We were excited to try the pizza!

Ordered a small white pizza with ricotta and garlic as well as a small half pepp/half sausage pizza.  Sizes were good.... and that's as far as the good stuff ends.........

White pizza was horrificly greasy... oil was pouring off (not dripping).  The garlic was black and tasted like charcoal briquettes.  Neither one of us could finish a whole slice.  

Half pepp/half sausage pizza was edible but still really greasy and the meat was awful.  Both were rubbery and fake tasting.  The only flavor was from the sauce.  Only thing I can compare it to was cardboard with a delicious sauce coated in rubbery oil.  We left almost a whole white pizza and half the other pizza and declined a to go box!  

The other thing I noticed (thanks to our Waitress having a louder voice) was that they were out of so many things.  When she brought us our waters she said they were out of cups so she would bring our pop once they clean cups.  Thought it was a bit odd since they were dead but whatever.  Throughout the night I kept hearing the waitress apologize to other guests for being out of frosted beer glasses, lemon slices, plates, bread and something else I forgot about.  They were all basic things that a restaurant should have on a Saturday night.  

I felt like we were on one of those reality TV shows about horrible restaurants going out of business due to poor service and gross food.  I kept looking for Gordon Ramsey to appear somewhere.  It was THAT bad!  

How is this place still in business and how are there so many good reviews???  What am I missing?????  Maybe I shoumd have started with drinks so I wouldnt notice the bad food?  I want my $40 back!!!"}
{"text":"For me pizza is a love that rivals all others; my wife almost broke it off with me on our second date because I was paying closer attention to the pizza than to her. I've been going to Red Devil for years (not the one in Tempe, the other one) and I love it. The pizza is just incredible and I haven't found pizza like it anywhere else, and believe me it's not from a lack of trying.

The individual restaurant isn't stellar, but it's a sports-bar-ish setting and the wait staff is mostly cute ASU girls. For the price and the quality you receive, I highly recommend Red Devil. If you want pretentious atmosphere or pizza that's \"like Chicago\" or \"like New York\" or \"like Omaha\", go elsewhere. If you want excellent pizza that is the best I know of in Arizona, go to Red Devil."}
{"text":"Another great meal! Had our favorite shrimp scampi ringing in the New Year.  Never disappointed.  A wonderful fresh meal nicely prepared. Jumbo shrimp over linguine,  enough to take home.  Fresh crisp salad & the bruchetta was amazing!"}
{"text":"The food was really good, however the environment was nothing short of a zoo. The staff did nothing but laugh scream and flirt. Never was asked how the food was only did you want anything else because we are closing. I would have asked to speak with the manager however the manager was involved in the party as well from flirting with the employees to hugging on them. I smell a lawsuit in the making. I would recommend the food just get it to go."}
{"text":"The crispy wings were a great starter. Our server, Kathy was polite, and made sure we never ran out of soda.  The red Devil Pizza was our favorite, but the white pizza was great too. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Love this place, great pizza and the chicken parm sub is delicious! The owner is always friendly and accommodating as well"}
{"text":"I cant believe this place only has 37 reviews! Ive been going to Red Devil for decades as well....best pizza dough and wings (so says my husband, as i don't eat wings) anywhere.   The pizza and wings special is our normal choice along with a salad.... Mmmmmm!"}
{"text":"When your husband has a late work night, we go to red devil, pizza with pepperoni and ham tasty, chicken wings extra crispy perfect! Crunchy not burnt like other places, Andrew our waiter on point with drinks and food great customer service! I will be back with my family :)"}
{"text":"Today: We were seated for 10 minutes before the server even acknowledged us and even then she just said that there are only 2 servers right now so she'd be with us in a few. The hostess was wiping down a table next to us and said \"I'd take your order but they won't let me\". Not helpful. We watched her run around as more people were getting sat. After another 10 minutes of still not even a drink order we watched her go to a table that had been recently sat and start to take their order... that's when we just got up and left. I get being short staffed but that's still no excuse for how our visit went."}
{"text":"Can you believe we got a table on Valentines day? I'm an idiot since I don't celebrate holidays but Red Devil doesn't take reservation.
I had the stand by spaghetti and italian sausage. My friend had lasagna.
As usual the service was excellent and the food delicious. The 40 minute wait went be quickly since we already had so much to talk about.
This is just a great local spot."}
{"text":"Ordered a large pie for carry out took less than 20 minutes.  Service was great.  I love the crust because it's got a little chew to it and it was thin and crisp.  I would go again try the dine in menu. I loved what I ordered pepperoni, sausage with extra cheese."}
{"text":"The good:
Pizza
Soup
Salads
Wings

Not so good:
Pasta

I never get the pasta here because from my experience it just isn't great and if I am going to eat pasta I want it to be great.  Other than that it is really good.  The service has always been good.  I would recommend it."}
{"text":"My new favorite pizza place. I ordered delivery twice and each time I got it earlier than expected. The food is good and hot. The pizza toppings are always generous and not skimpy. The price is very affordable. Usually when I order toppings they are no less than 1.99 for the largest size but here it is 0.99 which still makes the pizza a great deal. The ranch is the best I've had in a long time. It isn't some nasty hidden valley. I love this place."}
{"text":"11/11/10

Was in the area for a November OYE that was about to start in 30 minutes, but I was so hungry and didn't really think my second meal-of-the-day comprised of pie, cake, pastries, and wine was a healthy way to end the evening w/, so I decided I'd check out Red Devil.  It was dead inside (only a couple was there for dinner), and I got the feeling that most of the business that evening was going to be take-outs.

Bartender was friendly enough, until I started asking questions about the ingredients.  He still remained accessible, but the smiles certainly went away.  I almost stood up and left.  When the food arrived 25 minutes later, I wished I had left!  

I found the calzone crust soggy- no crispiness anywhere, and the mozzarella-ricotta mix made for an ugly, bland-tasting (I detected no ricotta flavor at all) conglomeration.  (See photos.)  The only thing that turned out OK was the marinara sauce, but what good is it if the item you're supposed to eat it w/ isn't worth the trouble?  I had the leftovers boxed, and stood up to go after only spending 5 minutes eating.  After all, I had a party to attend!

p.s. What a poor example of a treehugger I am!  No sooner had I exited RD's doors did I take the first chance to throw the leftovers in the trash.  Should've just left it on the table..."}
{"text":"Every time I go into this place the hostess is extremely rude!  The first couple of times I thought maybe she was having a bad day, but no she's just miserable all the time and refuses to be helpful.  It's sad when that's the first thing you see as you come in because it sets the mood for the meal.  I assume she must be the owner's daughter because any place in their right mind wouldn't keep someone like this around.  The food and the service is just okay."}
{"text":"Pizza is good, other dishes so so, but the real reason you should eat here is their white pizza with chicken and garlic.
I was skeptical at first, being a pepperoni aficionado, but the white pizza made a believer out of me.
Here's my suggestion.
Head into the bar and knock back a pitcher. Then order your white pizza, asking for anchovies in addition to the chicken and garlic. But only ask for a few. 
Nobody likes anchovies, not even your weirdest friend. 

Next, when the pizza arrives, being the gentleman you are, you offer up a slice to your friends. One by one they refuse, making sure to squinch-up their nose while doing so....a telltale sign of their disgust for anchovies. Perfect.
Now, carefully pick off all of the anchovies and eat the entire thing by yourself, and, what you can't finish in this sitting you can have for breakfast.

Let this serve as a good life lesson.
Always remember, if you don't want to share your delicious meal with anyone, you have two choices:
1.) Spit on it. 
2.) Add anchovies. 

Spitting is kind of uncool, especially in a public restaurant and all. This is why I'd run with the anchovy concept."}
{"text":"I had a 1 day notice to have a birthday party for 20 people. Called Red devil at 8:30pm and made a reservation for 20 the next day. The food was great, the service was great Thanks so much!"}
{"text":"You call this an Italian place??  French fries with chicken marsala and other dishes?  I don't think so!  Food taste was so so.  I certainly have had better Italian dishes around Phoenix!  Overall the restaurant can certainly use a face lift, very dark and not very appealing!  Host told us the chicken wings were really good.....certainly have to disagree with her!!  Not tasty at all!  Seek other places for sure!!"}
{"text":"Being a native, I can't believe I have never ben here before! The place was packed which is always a good sign. We only waited like 5 minutes on a Saturday night before we were seated. We ordered the boneless wings which weren't anything spectacular, but the pizza was great! We had the Red Devil Combo pizza, but they all looked and sounded great. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I love this place. Wish we had one in Houston. I go every time I visit phx. Large with Xtra sauce, Pepperoni, sliced sausage. Excellent every time"}
{"text":"Wow, was I impressed with their fast service, impressive menu, and their amazing food. I had the sausage and pepper sandwich. It was amazing and huge... I made lunch out of it the next day also. My son gobbled up the chicken tenders and fries. This place is great for the whole family. I would return and recommend."}
{"text":"I've been living here in the area 16 yrs and had never visited this place till recently.  I love the atmosphere,  specially the wings, pizza, and most importantly the premium beer prices..just hate the parking. One of the waiters mentioned that it gets very packed on the weekends and one could expect over an hour wait. Luckily for me, I've gone only on Sunday and during the week. I highly recommend this place for happy hour or a family night out."}
{"text":"Red Devi is OK in my opinion. I like that they have a take out window out front in case you feel like being lazy. The service is usually pretty good. I've had both in house and take out. The other day I ordered takeout because I was craving an antipasto salad really bad and didn't want to sit at a restaurant. The salad was pretty good, I also ordered a Philly cheesesteak and the bruschetta. Again, everything was Ok. I also have pretty high standards so definitely try for yourself.  I'm sure I'll be back but won't be running. :)"}
{"text":"Best pizza in AZ! Yum! Wings are good too. Actually you really can't go wrong with any menu items. Been in business so long w several locations for a good reason!"}
{"text":"I have ordered Red Devil's pizza and wings for takeout for years now, but today was the first time I dined in the restaurant.  We started with the potato skins which were served slightly overcooked and without any sour cream, which Red Devil does not carry.  (Really? Who serves potato skins without sour cream).  For our entrees, I ordered the baked lasagna and my boyfriend ordered the double bacon cheeseburger.  I only took about two bites of my lasagna which was so overloaded with flavorless marinara that I could not bare another, and my boyfriend only ate about half of his double cheeseburger that looked comparable to a McDonald's burger and tasted like a \"slightly better quality school lunch burger\".  These three items and one Pepsi cost us 32 dollars before tip.  All in all, we left hungry and forty dollars poorer.    We will not be back for anything but the occasional pizza and wings."}
{"text":"I can remember riding along with my grandma to go order a pie from Red Devil's takeout window.  Seeing the guys hand-toss the pizza dough in the air was always mesmerizing to me as a kid.  

Their pizza crust has not changed, though I'm not sure they still hand-toss the dough anymore.  But its still nice and crispy with the prefect amount of chew.  The price is about par with Streets, etc.  

Only thing that sucks about Red Devil - The Parking Lot."}
{"text":"Great pizza and great wings, place looks old and probably could use a remodel but food and services outstanding. Waitress was friendly and food came out hot fresh and fast. Will definitely go back to try pasta, table next to us ordered it and it looked and smelled amazing!!!"}
{"text":"The best Pizza in AZ hands down. AUTHENTIC NEW YORK STYLE. If you dont like it, you dont know what real pizza should taste like. I once had a friend tell me that the cheese was too chewy. That it should be like pizza huts cheese. I was floored. Real high quality cheese is chewy and should be."}
{"text":"We went for our anniversary lunch . It was so good . I had the stuffed manicotti hubby had spaghetti . Calamari as our appetiter. It was cooked well not rubbery at all . Service was good and yes we took home cheesecake with strawberries. Soooo good ."}
{"text":"I used to come to this place all the time when I was younger. I loved it then and I love it now. It's so easy to forget about little gems like this when you move away for a few years but man am I glad I went tonight. You can't beat the large pizza and wing special... the wings and pizza are excellent and you can easily tell the dough is fresh and made in house. Everything has great flavor! 

I wish I took a picture but I forgot but they now have boneless wings for whenever I am lazy."}
{"text":"My god I love this place. It is totally old Skool, dark wood everywhere, hasn't ever been updated since opening decades ago...but there is just something awesome about the pizza. And they make some pretty good wings as well. Bonus points for always being able to get in without waiting!
I find the McDowell location substantially better than the north location due to the classic atmosphere and for some reason, it just tastes better."}
{"text":"The pizza here is the real deal.  In fact, the Red Devil in Tempe does not make pizza that tastes this good (different ovens? sauce?).  The take-out orders for pizza here are relentless too, and there is a reason why. those ovens never stop."}
{"text":"I love Red Devil Pizza, BUT tonight I actually dined in instead of ordering pickup like usual and it started off great until all our food was up and my cousins gluten free pizza wasn't!! Waitress said it took a little longer, 5-6 minutes longer, since it was gluten free. We all finished our food, all of our drinks were empty and we didn't see the waitress since she dropped the food off and still no pizza! She finally brought it out and of course we boxed it, paid and left! She NEVER once apologized and she kept making excuses as to why it took so long- oven was way in the back and there were a lot of catering orders! Anyways if she would have just told us the truth-that she or cook forgot it  we would have left happy customers but that's what makes the difference between a good waitress and a bad one! Still love your pizza! Hated our experience tonight! We did give her a \"written\" tip and maybe this won't happen again!!!"}
{"text":"Consistent, above average pizza and good service. This is a go-to place for my family and I when we are in the mood for hearty/comfort food. The ranch dressing is delicious, salads are basic but good. I've had their fried zucchini, fried mushrooms, chicken parm, lasagna, ravioli and pizza with pepperoni/mushrooms. All are delicious. The restaurant is old and it's age is apparent which I think adds to it's appeal."}
{"text":"Two words: Do not. Getting dinner here the other night was a mistake. It left much to be wanted. My husband and I ordered pasta and it was unappetizing, flavorless, and tasted like canned food. Service was okay. The waiter was fast and friendly. The manager was not. Took him several minutes to even notice that we were waiting to be seated. We will not be visiting again."}
{"text":"Went to Red Devil on Bell Rd. yesterday (07/10) for lunch.  

A little background.  I meet my brother and friends once a week for lunch.  We go to a couple of different places, and about 2 months ago put Red Devil into the rotation.  My 9 year old son has been coming with us since school is out for the summer.

The first time I brought my son w/ me, he was given a customer appreciation card.  He got a free soda, and then every time we come in there, we get the card punched.  After 10 punches, he gets to pick out a fish for their aquarium.  Got his 10 yesterday and picked out a Black Tetra.  Staff has been very nice to him!

Since we have been going there, service has been top notch.  Every server we have has been attentive, knowledgable, and willing to accommodate special requests.  This is a RARE find today.

On to yesterdays lunch...

Red Devil has some great lunch specials under $10.00  They have several pastas to choose from and all the pasta dishes come w/ either a salad or soup.  They also have a couple of pizza's on the lunch menu for $5.99 (they call it a personal pizza, but it was about a 12\" pie).

I have been getting the spaghetti and meat balls lately.  The pasta is thinner than a regular spaghetti and is cooked al dente.  The red sauce; while not as good a mine, is very tasty.  The red sauce is thick and not watery at all.  They give you 2 average size meatballs in the dish.  I have had meatballs at some restaurants that are so dry, you need a glass of water to choke them down.  Not the case here.  The meatballs at Red Devil are very moist and go great w/ the sauce.

As I stated earlier, the pasta entries on the lunch menu come w/ a side of salad or soup.  I have been getting the salad; it's the standard iceberg lettuce w/ croutons, cucumber, carrot and onion.  What makes it so good is the house made Italian dressing they have to go with it.  The dressing has a very good flavor and they are not skimpy w/ it.

My son had the personal pizza w/ pepperoni.  Nice sized pizza (no salad w/ this one).  Thin crust NY style and plenty big for lunch.  Every pizza I have had at Red Devil has been good.  This one was no exception.  Sauce was good and had a nice amount of pepperoni on it (about 3 pieces per slice).  The sauce and toppings extended out to within 1/4-1/2 inch of the edge.  

Lunches also come w/ house made rolls and real butter.

I have been to Red Devil about 8x in the last 3 months.  The service and food have been good each time.  The lunch specials are a good value and the service has been great.  I hope they don't change a thing!"}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Their hot wings are my fav. and also the meatball sub is so good too. My husband loves the calzones and the pizza is always a great go to. If you are looking for something healthier- go for the Strawberry spinach and apple walnut are so so yummy! We have craving nights for this place."}
{"text":"Red devil has been my favorite pizza ever since I was a little kid. I remember standing Out Front watching them make the dough... best pizza in town"}
{"text":"I ordered veal parmesan and it came with a side of broccoli cheddar cheese soup the food is pretty good here but the prices are a little bit high. The lady server was very nice and friendly"}
{"text":"Kid at the take out window acted like a jerk who was being inconvenienced.  It's Tempe-there are a million pizza places you can go to where they're happy to have your business.  Go to one of those places instead."}
{"text":"Kind of bummed to be penning a 2-star update for this place, especially given my history with them (see my previous reviews). That said, I've reached the point where I just can't in good conscience give them a 5-star anymore. 

Where did it go wrong? I guess I'll start with the newfound inconsistency in the food, because at the end of the day, that's what stings more than anything else. Take, for example, something as simple as the chicken wings. Some days they'll be great, taste fresh and be lavished with sauce. Other days, you get skimpy, non-existent sauce, dry, almost old tasting meat, overcooked or rubbery, re-heated tasting wings. How, I ask you, can it vary that much? Used to be some of my favorite wings in the Valley, but now? I'm afraid to order them half the time. Another inconsistency is the soup. Yes, you read that right, the soup. How it is that someone can mess up on something so basic, I have no clue, but it has happened with frightening regularity as of late. How can the soup have cheddar, bacon and potato in it and still be utterly tasteless? Likewise, how can it be thick and wholesome one week, but then the next, runny and watery? Again, you end up with something that was once a staple, but now you're afraid to order it for fear of disappointment. 

The biggest food let down though, at least for me, has to be the inconsistency in the pizza. I am not sure how this is possible, but it's as if there's a different person making it every week. One day, you'll get perfect crust, just the right amount of sauce, and be in pizza heaven. Then, the next time, you'll get way too much sauce, or crust that's way too thin and overcooked to a crisp. If it looks and feels like a saltine cracker with melted cheese on top, that's not pizza. Worse still, even on the same pizza, it has now become par for the course to get wildly different thickness in each slice. How can it regularly be the case that one slice has crust as thin as a paper plate, and then the next is a full quarter inch thick? It's one thing to be inconsistent from week to week, but on the same damn pizza? Come on. 

Last but not least, the service and the staff. There were some really good people in there at one point, but now it seems like a growing contingent of the waitstaff are new and inexperienced or perhaps just not very bright. Case in point, on a recent visit, I didn't like the soup. I was even asked if it was good, to which I responded that it was merely \"ok\". This didn't even register with the server. To wit, when they later returned to collect the bowl, and found it almost completely full, they still didn't bat an eye. Seriously? Likewise, when refilling a drink, if there's no ice left, why not bring a fresh glass with ice? Iced tea is not whiskey, and I'm fairly certain that nobody enjoys it \"neat\". Finally, some of the host staff could really use a lesson in customer service. Despite having what is quite literally easiest job in the restaurant, I can't count how many times I've seen resting bitch face, or folks with their back turned as you walk in, chit chatting away instead of acknowledging you. You don't have to love your job, but you could at least pretend to give shit.  
 
All told, if I'm completely honest, I really am wearing thin when it comes to this place. Some of the folks working there are great, and sometimes so is the food, but if you can't trust a pizza place to at least be consistent with pizza, of all things, that's an issue. While I'm disappointed in recent developments, I sincerely hope they get their act together before I find another pizza joint. What a shame."}

{"text":"Gosh, I want the Red Devil I remember to come back so badly I gave them another chance at delivery.  The food wasn't any better than my last bad review and this time it didn't come until 20 minutes after they said it would.  Even worse than the last bad experiences, so - sniff - I guess we're done with Red Devil.  I might cry."}

Service always great and the food delicious! 
Was here last night. Scored a booth in the bar! 
Love the locals hanging out and telling stories. 
Jesus was our server. He is outstanding! Always attentive and so nice. 
Had pizza/wings and Greek salad. 
Also had the ziti with clam sauce. 
Brought so much home.. but love the left overs! 
A must visit!!"}
{"text":"Have been going to RD for quite sometime. 
Went this evening... Our server Chelsea was not that with it. 
Had to repeat our order many times. Had to ask for our drinks and extra napkins. 
Food was okay.... But honestly... Service to me is a deal breaker. 
We ordered so much food. Our bill was close to $100. 
Never offered water or bread and just not impressed. 
Love the original location on Mc Dowell. 
Yes it's busy but those severs are on it."}
{"text":"I remember my first red devil experience vividly. It was almost 5 years ago. I was having one of those typical really crappy IT industry days. The NOC was slammed with calls and of course all from the worst of the worst customer wise. My manager at the time says he has something to make the day better. Takes off for about 45 minutes. I didn't know what to expect... hookers? blow?... no.. its a huge pizza and a giant pile of wings.

Holy crap these wings are AMAZING even with the steam effect you get when you take out wings. They are super crispy and sauce is the baseline hot/vinegary/buttery awesomeness by which  I measure other wings. Their ranch is absolutely amazing and they are not stingy with it. Enough left over to dip pizza in afterward for the ultimate in glutton. I always go for the hot but their other flavors are good. If  you want a real treat just ask them not to sauce the wings and get a few sides of dipping sauce. The teriyaki they coat their chicken in for their oriental salad makes a GREAT wing dip.

The pizza crust is super crunchy and has an amazing flavor, cheese is nice and greasy, and the toppings are good quality. The sauce is a little flat but I can look past it considering all the other pros.

If you are lucky enough to dine in the wings are even better and they will serve you these delicious pizza bread rolls. They tear like string cheese and are always fresh. Sometimes they come right out of the oven mmmmm.

I have never once encountered a rude server. Service has always been at least 3.5 stars.. mostly 4.5 or 5. This is just a fun place to go and a great family restaurant.

This is a valley icon/staple and has been around long before I was even a thought. Apparently we have some family history. This used to be my uncles college stomping groups and Tee Pee used to be my dads. Guess love of the local grease pits is hereditary."}
{"text":"Didn't know this place was here. Was at auto repair shop and needed a close place. First off the location isn't the cleanest. Old strip mall. Looks run down. Walk in and you see a small counter with a older man and a long hallway. Weird and unpleasant. Needs to be open and would like to quickly survey the place. This odd man that did not fit in at all walked me down hallway to seating area. Wow! This place is outdated big time. The carpet is old and dark and grungy. Looks like a bad 80's hotel carpet. Old booths and tables and lots of old people. I wanted to back out but felt obligated to try it out.  Decided to try a lunch special of the spagetti  and meatballs. Came with choice of soup or salad. Tried chili and that was a mistake. Was not good. Much better at Wendy's. The spaghetti was ok. Definitely won't order that again. I think this place must have good pizza. Seems to be a great place for a take out pizza or for old people. I even tried to google pizza places while inside this place and they don't show up. Sends me to here other pizza joints a few miles away. They need a good updating in many ways. If I come back it will be to try the pizza. But can't see that happening."}
{"text":"Great for togo!

We ordered from here for our office meeting yesterday. They were very helpful over the phone. Plus they were the first place that when I call them before they open they don't give me attitude about ordering early. \"Yes I understand that you don't open for another hour, but if you could please take my order so that I can make sure it's ready in and hour and  a half I would appreciate it.\" Do I really need to explain this to people? Annoying. 

Anyway, I didn't need to have that convo with them at all, took my order and let me know if would be ready exactly when I wanted it, and it was. 

The quality was good, the salad dressing was great and they didn't skimp on the pizza toppings. They were a little pricey, almost $20 per 16\" pizza, but it was worth it I think. Especially since I wasn't paying for it. haha!"}
{"text":"Have been to red devil on a number of occasions and have enjoyed each visit. If you are not a fan of waiting for a table or waiting for a while on your food, don't stop by Friday nights. The place is packed. It you like white pizza, this place is worth the stop."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  They took a last minute reservation for 11 of us, no problem.  Table was ready when we arrived.  Wings were DELICIOUS.  Perfectly crispy.  Pizza was amazing too...love the thin crust.  The manager was so friendly and attentive the entire time, making us feel very welcome!  Can't wait to come back and have those wings again soon."}
{"text":"We went there for Fathers Day lunch today. We got there 15 min before they opened, but man was it already HOT outside, my car read over 120*. We were there with my 90 year old grandma and 15 month old daughter, waiting outside for them to open. I saw an employee in the lobby and knocked on the door to see if they could let us wait inside. She shook her head \"no\" at me and walked away. They refused to open the door until noon when they opened...even though they had a comfortable waiting area for us. By then my daughters face was beat red, and grandma was sweating profusely. What a bunch of jerks. We will never be back."}
{"text":"BEST CHICKEN WINGS EVER!  And the PIZZA is good too!

We used to go to the Red Devil way out in the West Valley.  Now that we have moved downtown we finally decided to give the original Red Devil on McDowell a try.  I was surprised and I'll just say \"what a great place'!  Our server was Jenny . . . very pleasant and didn't hover over you.  We had our usual \"Supremo\" all meat pizza (pepperoni, sausage, canadian bacon and hamburger).  it was so good and tasted so close to what we had grown to love at our old stompin' grounds.  But the chicken wings were the star of the show.  Wings don't get any better that this.  Crispy, hot and I dare you to eat just one.  I'd go here just to order the wings to-go.

By the way, there is a $5 off coupon on their website.  $5 off any order of $30 or more (so get it before it expires)."}
{"text":"Grabbed a medium 2 topping pizza to go. The toppings were fresh the cheese was a little sparse but it worked. The star was the crust. Everyone has very specific things they like. The crust was a chewier texture. Thin but held up perfectly under the flavorful sauce and toppings. 
The saltiness and chewiness of the crust hit the spot it was not the cheapest pizza I have had but the crust is exactly what I have been looking for.. in the sea of pizza places around town I am hooked."}
{"text":"I used to love going to the red devils on the west valley. I came to this one because it was closer but it was the worst experience ever. We saw our waiter make our salad with his bare hands and didn't even wash them. We told the manager and he acted like he didn't care. He also \"forgot\" to take the salad off our bill. The server was acting like he was in a rush the whole time when he only had two tables. The pizza and wings was good besides that."}
{"text":"Cannot believe your closed on Sunday! Drove all the way from east Mesa! Grrrrrrr.... does not say that anywhere on your on-line menu I printed. I'm giving you this rating based on your pictures on here and average. I was looking so forward to trying you for the first time! I have a large event in January that needs a venue. I wanted to test your place out to see if I should bring 55 people back. Ok, well I'll try another time. You really should add your hours of operation to your menu. Thank you"}
{"text":"I think my wife summed it up when she remarked something to the effect of, \"Why would anyone want to go in that dive and buy overpriced, mediocre pasta?\"

Yeah, it was pretty mediocre.  Little more than edible, The pasta really didn't make the prospect of returning very attractive.  The marinara had so much oregano in it that it probably doubled as the pizza sauce.  The minestrone was okay, but the bread roll was a tasteless ball masquerading as sourdough.  Service was friendly enough, but that's not going to save this place.  

I love me some pasta, but I don't love me Red Devil.  Pass."}
{"text":"Best pizza and wings in the valley.  The place is a bit of a dive.  But it's been that way since I've been going there since 1978 and if you want great food and don't care about the environment, this is the place to go for sure."}
{"text":"First visit tonight. We just had the Red Devil Combo pizza which was pepperoni sausage mushrooms onions and I think bell pepper. The ingredients were fresh but lacked flavor. I added salt Parmesan cheese and red chile flakes to it. Red chile flakes had absolutely no heat. 
We had wings also. Half were NY mild and half were medium. Those were excellent. I wasn't crazy about the bread rolls. They did have a nice crust to them and were pretty hearty. My preference is just soft light rolls. 
The service was excellent, attentive throughout our dinner. There was a huge private party in the back room but our servers never left us waiting for anything .
I would like to go back for the wings and something different than pizza."}

{"text":"When I have a hankering for Italian cuisine, I pay a visit to one of my two favorite Red Devil Italian Restaurant & Pizzeria locations (3004 East Bell Road, Phoenix, AZ 85032 / 3102 East McDowell Road, Phoenix, AZ 85008). I traditionally order the large Antipasto Salad, which proves itself to be a full meal for a \"hungry man\" like me. The robust salad is loaded with radishes, capicola, artichoke heart, roma tomatoes, provolone cheese, pepperoncinis, black and green olives, genoa salami and roasted bell peppers. A complementary basket of warm, freshly baked rolls (yummm...) is provided to each table. The restaurants are geared toward hosting parties of all sizes (families, large groups, couples and singles). Parking is readily available and the facilities are clean. Auguri! (Best Wishes)"}
{"text":"Try the new deep dish pizza!! Very good, small perfect for 2. Also, we have ordered chicken Alfredo,  spaghetti and meatballs, seafood pasta, manicotti, cheese ravioli and garlic bread. All surprisingly good and the pasta was not over cooked which I was scared of because it was delivery . Great portions and tastes even better the second day. Always get prompt delivery and friendly drivers."}
{"text":"So I came to Red Devil not sure what to expect and I left a big fan.  

I ordered a glass of their house Riesling and was duly impressed with the bargain glass of wine.  It was very fruity , with just the right amount of dryness.  

My husband ordered a large, thin crust cheese pizza and I ordered a spinach and strawberry salad with grilled chicken breast.  Now I am not one to brag about a salad, in fact it's very, very rare for me to even order a salad, but that night a salad made sense so I went ahead.  Man, am I glad I did...  It was the most amazing salad I've ever had.  EVER.  The chicken breast was a quality cut and grilled perfectly, and the salad greens were flavorful and crunchy and the strawberries were sweet, fresh and delicious and the whole salad was dressed in an amazing, light and tangy dressing that was almost non-existent in appearance, but exploded in flavor on the first bite.  I can't explain it better than that.  It was just the freshest, most flavorful salad ever.  

My husband enjoyed his cheese pizza quite a bit as well, but he still found room to steal about half of my salad off my plate too!"}
{"text":"Great pizza and wings. But very disappointed with the entrees. Eggplant Parmesan was the soggiest mess I have ever seen. I will stick to the wings, pizza, it seems this is what they know."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been in the same locations for 55 years... and the decor kind of shows that although you can spot attempts at remodeling here and there.

Who cares!  Even though this place resides in a seedy part of Phoenix, the food and service is absolutely outstanding.  I can't state how good everything was and what a tremendous value it was also.

Our server, and every server we saw which was many, were very pleasant and had no trouble saying \"You're Welcome\" in response to a Thank you.  Crazy how many people in the service respond to a Thank you with \"yeah, no problem\".

Full bar/wine/beer.  Drinks poured deep and pricing is fair for a restaurant.

On the darker side for atmosphere and also a tad warm.  Dress lightly.

TV's with sports on all over but no sound so it doesn't disturb you.

Now the pizza...

Wow!  The waitress told us they've been using the same Pizza ovens the entire 55 years and the recipe for the crust has never changed during that time.  I believe it... when something is right, don't screw with it!

Outstanding pizza crust with an excellent crunch on the outside with a chewy texture and no crumbling of crust to the table.  A very large selection of toppings too.  I decided to be a little unconventional and went with Red Onion, Hamburger, and Green Chile.  Outstanding!

These guys are going on my Pizza LIST."}
{"text":"The manicotti's marinara is flavorful and tasty however, the pasta itself though is dry and overcooked. I've tried it both while dining in, & take out and they are essentially the same. The Portobello ravioli is inedible and gross with the pasta far too thick and pasty to be enjoyed. The accompanied sauce was just more of a magnified flavor of mushrooms which repelled rather than delight this diner. This sauce should be 86'd altogether and replaced with a more appealing marinara. The restaurant itself is tired and old and in sore need of upgrade and redecoration. The service is very s-l-o-w but cordial when you get it. All in all, I give Red Devil 2 stars as they are living in the past and are in dire need of upgrade; menu, building & service. Their long history is one of the only positives which attract me."}
{"text":"Always good quaity!!! And very reasonable. I had the chicken parm and it was to die for."}
{"text":"This is an Italian wannabe restaurant. If you're looking for true Italian food look elsewhere. Nothing bad per se, but nothing good either. My meatball hero wasn't properly toasted, had very little marinara sauce & the flavor was overall bland. My gf had to return her chicken platter since it didn't look or taste like chicken. 

If we ever go back is to try the pizza, other than that I can cook much much better than this at home & for a fraction of the cost"}
{"text":"Love this place, my family has been coming here for years. We love their pizza and their friendly staff. There are others in the valley but they aren't the same as this location. I highly recommend this place if your looking for a good Italian location."}
{"text":"I'm not a pizza fan but oh ma dayum. I think they just got themselves a new customer."}
{"text":"Really good pizza and I like their cheese steak sandwiches. They have an outdoor pick up window that opens right to the kitchen, no having to go inside to the restraunt, and..it's hot out of the oven. Easy the best pizza in the neiborhood."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza joint. 

It's simply the best. Never had a negative experience with the people or the food and I visit there often.

Keep it up Red Devil, we love you.

(Just wish you could bring back the Arrowhead location!!)"}
{"text":"Awful service, awful food.

Was here several weeks ago as part of a large group; I arrived partway through the meal and did not order anything, so can't speak for the food on that occasion (though it looked good), but the service was excellent. We had a male waiter who handled our giant group with ease and was very pleasant.

This time, we had a girl serving us. I did not catch her name, but she was short, kinda squat and had darker hair. She seemed to have a bit of an attitude, and was nowhere to be found when we needed refills, dressing, or the check. Another server also delivered all our beer from the bar, so she must have really been pulling a vanishing act.

As for the food... We had chicken alfredo and a pizza. The alfredo sauce was ridiculously salty and the noodles undercooked. The pizza was lukewarm when it arrived. The crust was insanely chewy to the point of making your jaw hurt. The only good thing about the meal was the ranch dressing."}
{"text":"We have eaten here before and its one of my girlfriends favorite places and even though I am gluten free, I have always been able to manage in the past even though they don't have a \"gluten free\" menu.  It was a friday night and we didnt have to wait to be seated which was amazing.  Our server however was very poor.  When i asked her about a gluten free menu (it had been over a year since i had been here so i figured i would ask just in case) - she replied with \"we dont have anything gluten free\" .  I rephrased the question.. No we dont have anything gluten free.. I asked.. Salad? She replied oh yeah i guess that is gluten free.. so anyways.. I have been gluten free for a couple years now so i can pick out things i know i can eat and what i cant.  I ended up ordering.. Salad - no croutons please... of course, the salad came out with croutons... i sent it back asking for one without.  
Wings came out after entrees... 
food was mediocre at best.  
Just really not what i have come to expect."}
{"text":"I ate at Red Devil for the first time a couple of days ago and I thought I would share my experience. I had heard of this establishment through a local newspaper and I decided to give it a try... Upon first glance, the exterior left much to be desired, but I wasn't coming for the ambiance (well, kind of); I was interested in finding a good pizza. We started with an appetizer, which was the fried mushrooms and zucchini, a pleasantly crisp take on the classic fried duo. The ranch sauce that accompanied was a decent ranch, it was rather tangy, which is a good thing when it comes to ranch (although I am unsure of it is house made?) We decided to go with a classic pizza--cheese and red sauce. I feel like simplicity offers the best avenue for accurate pizza judgement... Too many toppings can alter the taste and the texture too much, so it's better to keep it simple. The pizza was very good; the crust was thin, but not so thin that it resembled a cracker. The sauce was flavorful without being overpowering and the amount of cheese was not offensive... Although the pizza was a little on the greasy side regardless. But I don't think it necessarily took away from the pizza by any means, because I think sometimes you just *want* a a little grease on your pizza! Nevertheless, I enjoyed my experience and our waitress was very pleasant and attentive. The only thing stopping this review from being a 5 star review is the ambiance and overall presentation of the space. I would love to see some updating of the decor! The waitress told us the Tempe location had been there for around 20 years... And I believe her because it doesn't seem to have been updated in 20 years."}
{"text":"I walked into Red Devil randomly, I've been past this place a million times, never stopped, but I'm glad I finally did. The service alone deserves 5 stars + and much praise.

 I was greeted immediately upon arrival by young man at the host stand. I was looking to sit at the bar, but it was Thursday night and football season, so there were no available seats. The young man not only walked around the bar to see if anything was available, but also searched around the restaurant to see if he could find me stool to squeeze in. He insisted I sit at one of the 3 large, patron-less booths in the bar area even though I was a party of one. Being in the business myself, I was hesitant, I didn't want a server to lose out to a party of 6 that could comfortably sit in this booth.

Amber was my server. Amber was phenomenal. She greeted me with a comforting and inviting smile. I immediately told her I would move if she had other opportunities for the table, she insisted I stay even after room at the bar  opened up. Amber rattled off the specials with ease, ($2 pints, some good ones too, as  well other great specials during NFL games) gave great suggestions when I was between items ( I had fried zucchini there and a build your own calzone to go) and was amazingly, on top keeping my beer full, and making sure I had everything I needed. Again, I'll say Amber hit the nail on the head with her hospitality. 

The restaurant is huge, clean, and inviting. The food was great, as was the atmosphere. Everyone had a smile on their face and was eager to help. Those are the reasons I'll be back, as well as sending many others their way. Ask for Amber! 

Kudos Red Devil Bell Rd, and of course Amber, thank you for a great experience."}
{"text":"Went here with an empty stomach but armed with a coupon, because that's how we roll! *ka-ching*

'They say there's no such thing as free lunch' - Well, they've probably never used a coupon. We got the buy one lunch entree with beverage, and get another lunch entree for free!

My husband ordered the Chicken Parmigiana.
Verdict: \"It's okay but it's not gonna win any awards.\"

I got the Spaghetti with meatballs.
Verdict: It looks like someone threw up blood on Kermit The Frog's face (see pic). It's okay, but I won't nominate it.

Service: The waitstaff's friendly but we got there early so we didn't really need to scream for attention like a spoiled 5 year old kid.

Anyway, we heard their pizza's great so we'll probably be back to try them (with a coupon, of course). :p"}
{"text":"Alright, I'll admit I've been driving past Red Devil for a decade now and always wondering what it was all about. It was always busy, seemingly always open, and really odd looking enough that it drew my interest. 

After all these years, I finally decided to try Red Devil only because it was time I actually stopped, and I had a craving for spinach and artichoke dip. Upon walking in, it was obvious this place has been here forever. It's a relic, and it probably hasn't been remodeled since, well... ever. They still have the light up signs for hte order numbers, and the entire restaurant feels like a cave. It's reminiscent of all those old school Mexican restaurants you find scattered around town with no windows, etc. We were friendily greeted twice upon entry and seated almost instantaneously. The crowd was mixed, but one thing everyone had in common is it was almost an entirely blue collar lunch break crowd. There were some people from Honeywell, and some contractors, as well as some teachers. 

The appetizer spinach and artichoke dip was very tasty... if not a bit overly greasy but with the right amount of fat, salt, and other artery clogging goodness. I ordered the lunch special small cheese pizza, and at the table was also a small white pizza. The red sauce pizza was average, with a very sweet sauce, a tough crust as if it had been made earlier in the day but overall a \"it's low quality but oh so tasty\" kind of taste to it. The white pizza had no olive oil, no garlic, no anything outside of breat and cheese. It was cheesy bread, make no mistake. 

Overall, I thought the food was average if not slightly below average, but there is something about Red Devil that made me feel comfortable here and welcome. The staff was friendly, there was no sense that you were being judged... it was just a good happy experience... with sub standard but still acceptable food. I walked out the door under $30 including tip for an appetizer, two pies, and two iced teas. I felt it to be very reasonable."}
{"text":"Ordered pizza and wings tonight to give them another shot after they messed up a order weeks ago. Now that was  a mistake. The pizza was so tough and tasted terrible. The wings were super dry. This place use to be great what happened. The night manager Kathy when I called was rude and said didn't care if I was lost as a customer when I been one for over a decade. She gave me a partial credit for my order which is now in the trash as its not edible."}

Other people double-parked to pick up to go order. What a load of crap! Been in the valley since 1976. Switched over to Red Devil maybe 13 years or so ago. Call the manager Kathy!. She said sorry honey. FYI, don't call someone honey that's older than you. She said to go on the Red Devil website. Disappointed. I guess I will go to Sardella's now. I'm right in between both. Adios, Red Devil"}
{"text":"This is, hands down, the best pizza period. I've had pizza at several restaurants and at hole-in-the-wall spots, but they pale in comparison to Red Devil pizza. The wait staff was the best, too."}
{"text":"We've always loved Red Devil. My family has been eating here for years. Tonight, my son broke his leg. I decided to order pizza when he was discharged. I was having a bit of an issue ordering through the Yelp app. It had taken a few minutes and I got a bit frustrated. So, I decided to call and order. My call was answered at 9:31. I was asked what I wanted. I stated I wanted to place an order. The young lady on the phone told me it was too late and I had missed \"last call.\" It was at 9:30 and they close at 10. 

What? 

It was 9:32 when we hung up. I went back on the app and was able to place my order. If we weren't hungry, tired (I'd been up since 4:30 am after 2 hrs of sleep) and my son didn't have his heart set on pizza, I wouldn't have bothered. There are TONS of other places that will allow a customer to order food while the place is actually open. I placed a $51.00 order that I won't be placing again. If the customer isn't first, I can find a restaurant with a more customer friendly policy. Even if it makes their Friday night later. 

Thanks for making my night that much harder lady. 

Follow up. I was actually nice and originally gave 3 stars just because of the relationship to this place. But when I got here, my order that I had to place online, the one I was having trouble with in the first place, was WRONG. So I had to spend another $17.00 for another pizza. What's weird is that when I was waiting at the window, people came up to order. The guy at the counter told me that they don't stop taking orders until 11 on weekends. WTH Brenda. Don't you want to help keep long-time, loyal customers. The guy at the window also originally told me that I ordered from the wrong place. I called bRenda and verified the address and phone number. NOT ONE person offered to make any of this right in any way. No discount, no soda while I waited. Nothing. I'm now waiting for another pizza. And spent $70.00. Customer for more than 25 years and I'm NEVER coming back."}
{"text":"We tried the cheesy bread and pepperoni/sausage pizza. It was delicious. I would definitely recommend them. We were in/out in a reasonable amount of time."}
{"text":"Pizza was decent. Highlight of the pizza was the crunchy crust. We ordered the Red Devil combo which contains pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, onions and green peppers. The wings were good. The sauce has a nice amount of spice. The spaghetti was average, ambience is great as is the service. The cookie dessert was delicious but not as warm as other places. We'll come back."}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood favorite.  The dining room has a vintage charm that accompanies the recipes that have an old world taste.  The pizza is always piping hot, cheese that is like liquid, crispy crust, fresh toppings that seem to be made just for you. 

Always ask about the special. We get the pizza and wings special when available.  The wings are always crisp like a they were flash fried.  The sauce base is a BBQ sauce instead of butter like many chains.  

The service is always attentive, seldom do I have to ask for a refill or other item.  This makes Red Devil a must for our birthdays, date night with other couples or just some comfort food.  Great bang for your buck."}
{"text":"Ok here is the deal with Red Devil Pizza.  The key to making pizza with crispy crust is to have ovens that great sufficiently hot.  That is why I like places with brick over pizza's. They don't use Brick Ovens at Red Devil but  I have been told that Red Devil has some really old pizza ovens that are not available any longer or hard to get.  I can't verify that, I don't even remember who told me that, maybe I read it some where.  Don't know if it is true or not. What I do know is that Red Devil is one of my favorite pizza place in the Valley.  Their pizza is consistently good.  Thin-Crisp and delicious.  I have had pasta's and salads there as well. They are fine, nothing to get excited about. But the Pizza at Red Devil is something I will stake my reputation on.  Actually I don't really have a reputation, but if I did I would lay it on the line for Red Devil Pizza. The long and short of it is, I am very passionate about their Pizza.  Period."}
{"text":"I recommend the Pollo Siciliano and the Pollo basil.

Good Stuff."}
{"text":"Ate here while exploring Phoenix. The outside doesn't have windows but I like the dim low light inside. Host seated us immediately. Server came shortly after. Table ordered 8 piece wings, a small pepperoni pizza, and a fettuccine alfredo with grilled chicken. The pasta was good and came with a soup. The bread rolls were also good. The only thing I kind of did not like is that all the food came out at different times."}
{"text":"I was expecting the same service as from any other Red Devil restaurant, but it was completely opposite. I picked up my take out order only to have it spill all over me and the inside of my truck just setting it down. I grabbed the bags and took it to the counter and made the 2 so called employees aware and all he did was grab a small plastic bag, another paper bag and told me to handle it because he didn't have time. I grabbed my order and took to the lobby and expressed my frustrations to him and he tells me that I need to calm down around his customers. I believe I was a customer as well, but didn't get treated that way. That is the first and last time I will eat at that location. Pathetic service at best"}
{"text":"It's Super Bowl Sunday and someone suggested wings. Okay, I grew up where wings were invented and there are two things true about me and wings ... I will eat them over Cheerios for breakfast; and I won't put up with bad wings.

I'm calling them wings here because back home NO ONE calls them Buffalo Wings or Hot Wings. First off, buffalo wings only grow on buffalo's and buffalo's are very reluctant to part with their wings. And second, we don't use the word \"hot\" because that's the only way wings are made. In my home town we frown upon putting fancy foo-foo sauces on our wings.

Now, back to the game. Now I'm in the mood for wings now and no one is going to get in the car and go out to find some while the game is getting exciting. Not having a clue which if any of the places listed here are good or even tolerable the #1 criterion simply becomes which place offers the most wings for the cheapest price and they absolutely positively have to deliver them. And fast.

Red Devil was the best deal and because it was football time we expected to see them in an hour or two ... maybe.  Nope, a cool friendly guy delivered them in about 30 minutes. While they have several sauce options (none prohibitively foo-foo) they oddly insist that the only way to order them is half and half from several preselected choices. We selected mild Buffalo and hot, which by the way were both impressively hot.

The wings themselves were fat and juicy and 10 of them were enough for me to call a full meal. The only weird thing is that their definition of half and half was 12 of the so-called mild and only 8 of the hot. I actually deducted a star for that because the driver told us that despite the big game their store was dead slow, so they can't blame it on being too busy to not be able to count out 20 wings properly. And unfortunately for me I liked the hotter ones that we only got 8 of better.

One more thing - has anyone ever told them that they have one of the worst websites on Planet Earth?  What are they thinking, it's almost like they are purposely trying to drive people away. The number one reason people visit a restaurant's website is to see the menu and find out what the hours are.  While they do have a link that says \"menu\" it doesn't show you a menu, and if you click on the \"takeout/delivery\" menu it's almost useless. The sad thing is it looks like they're paying some dude big bucks to \"design\" that so-called website.

Red Devil for wing delivery during a football game overall impressed me for price and quality.  They were given one simple job ... put 10 medium wings and 10 hot wings in a bag and deliver it. Too bad they messed up."}
{"text":"Always great Pizza and Wings. The wings are deep fried, but good. The pizza is one of the few pizzas I like with thinner crust, but it has good sauce the crust isn't crispy hard thin. More like NY or Boston style. The ambiance is a bit old school, looks like they have had the same wooden tables and chairs for the past 30 years, but I do like it. It has an old school Phoenix vibe, which there aren't many places that have that anymore. They also have good lunch specials."}
{"text":"The reviews on this place are pretty high so I was excited to check it out. I ordered a pizza and a calzone. Both were decent but nothing too exciting. I'd be interested to try them for dinner and see how their pasta and other dishes are."}
{"text":"This place was  recommended to us for their wings. My husband loves wings and has not found a place he likes as of yet.  Red Devil wings get a thumbs up from him. We got the bbq bone in wings and they were pretty good. Some of the wings were dry in spots from being over cooked but the bbq sauce was delicious.  Very nice bbq flavor with just a little tang to it, not spicy or over peppery.  My husband had the philly cheese steak, his opinion... it was ok. The roll wasn't right, it was too chewy, supposed to be a flour roll he said not a Kaiser type like he got. The green peppers were to big cut  in chunks, supposed to be thinly sliced and cooked with the meat. The meat was oily/greasy and a little rubbery, wasn't cooked right.  Now I had a calzone which I enjoyed. I got the white calzone since I can't have tomato products at all and I have to say it was pretty good. It was huge so I only ate half of it but the half I did it was tasty. Not greasy at all, just a tiny bit from the pepperoni but nice amount of cheeses inside and good flavoring with the basil and oregano. Crust on it was also good, not tough or chewy. The calzone is definitely one to enjoy right away and hot. We got our dinner carry out and it was still good when we got it home, but the cheese in the calzone started to solidify once it started to cool off.  Over all Red Devil Italian is pretty good, we would definitely go there again :)"}
{"text":"Red Devil on 32nd street and McDowell is my favorite restaurant of all time.  I've tried almost everything on the menu since I've started visiting (1983).  Being born and raised here in Phoenix why my family never brought me here as a kid, I'll never know.  The ambience is great.  They have a cozy bar and the lighting is perfect(red like).  I have been to the others on bell and in Tempe as well but the original is near me.  Joe D, Doug, Diane and Melvin are 4 of the reasons why Red Devil lives on...."}
{"text":"My dad used to work down the road from here oh, (hack cough) 40 years or so ago, when I was ... wait, I'm dating myself. Stop that Janet. 

Ahem. Anyway, our family ate a lot of pizza here over the years, and I'm happy it's still here. I like mushroom and  black olive pizza... my dad put sausage on his half. Of course he's since had quintuple bypass surgery but I'm quite sure it had NOTHING to do with the pizza he consumed. No, of course not.

I'm  also quite sure we never had pineapple. I wonder when that showed up on the menu?

My mom used to eat eggplant parm,which was covered in marinara and gooey cheese, and my brother would eat a mountain of cheese ravioli. I remember the portions being really big. And I remember the garlic bread as being pretty good. 

I'm headed back here next time I'm in town with my kid so she can check out where grandpa used to take mommy. I love it when places  have been  around longer than I have been."}
{"text":"I love chicken wings and this place catered to my \"special\" needs on how I like my wings.  Multiple sauces on the side and extra crispy.  Wings came out just how I wanted them and they were very tasty.  Together with a couple of glasses of beer that the bartender recommended, I was set with a good dinner.

Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Checking out the North Phoenix location... very good home style Italian good .. thick alfredo sauce, great white pizza - good wine list and awesome desserts .. topped off with excellent and friendly service .."}
{"text":"I was just recently introduced to this place and I am addicted. They have the best wings and ranch sauce! I also was a fan of the pizza. If you are not into eating in the restaurant they have a super easy pick up window and you get to watch the guys make the pizza while you wait. The only thing that sucks about this place is the parking. However it is good when you see a ton of cars in the parking lot you know you are in for a treat. I have not had any pasta but will be trying it soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently moved to the area and we were looking to try a new place.  I came across this place while looking at yelp reviews.  On a Saturday night my husband and I went to try this place.  We were really impressed they had a to go window so we didn't have to go inside to order.  We ordered a pizza with half cheese and the other half had sausage,  bacon,  and pepperoni.  We also ordered a small cesar salad and half order of buffalo wings. The food was done in 15 minutes.  Really quick service for a Saturday night.  The pizza was pretty good. A little too greasy but overall it was tasty. I like the crust on the pizza. Also, the ceasar salad was really good. I really liked the dressing. My husband ate the wings and he said it was pretty good. Not too spicy and good flavor.  Overall I was happy with our food.  We will definitely be back to try something different."}
{"text":"I didn't eat the pizza, so I can't comment there.  I sampled three dishes.  My friend ordered eggplant parmesean, and that was tasty, but I've had better.  My husband and I both ordered pasta dishes.  The pasta itself was ok, but I am a big stickler for a good sauce, and this didn't fit the bill.  I expect my marinara sauce to have some tang, and not taste like jarred tomatoes with no spice.  It almost seemed as if the joint had toned down the sause to ensure it would be more palatable to the masses.  There are much more delicious places in town, but the service was good, and you could bring your entire family here and squeeze them all in.  If you're simply going with your spouse or a friend or two, I'd give it a pass."}
{"text":"Love this place, I usually go to the bar and have a few drinks with dinner. The bartenders are fun and fast. The pizza is simply amazing. Not much more to say,
Great service 
Great prices
Great food
The end"}
{"text":"Not a place I would recommend, it does not seem very clean, I order to take out and the guy who handling the money at the register was also making the pizza dough without washing his hands in between."}
{"text":"Worst Chicken Parm of my life!! No kidding, it was greasy and cold when I got it. The alfredo was sort of gritty, but the cheese ravioli was ok (you could tell that it was pre-made). I went because my friend said it was good pizza, but I wanted to try a little of everything. If there's a next time I will stick to the pizza."}
{"text":"I have been going to this restaurant for over 30 years. I still think that they have the best pizza and also have a great Italian menu to choose from. From manicotti, spaghetti, salads, and great service. Very authentic."}
{"text":"Been coming here for years.  I haven't ever been disappointed.  For years all I ever ordered was Pizza & Wings.  They have the best Pizza & Wings hands down! 
Then I started exploring the rest of their menu. Again every dish I tried was amazing.
So if you are in Tempe (although I travel from Casa Grande) and want some great Italian or just Pizza & Wings, this is the place! 

Also the owners are great people who know what it takes to have a great restaurant."}
{"text":"First time going and it was great! Amazing service and such a cute set up. The food was super tasty and our waiter was so nice.This location is right around the corner from my house and I regret not coming in sooner! We will be back."}
{"text":"Our fav pizza and wings place! The hostess is already so friendly when she greats us. The places decor is simple. But don't let that fool you. They have the best chicken wings and pizza I've had. And I don't even like pizza. But I love coming here. All the servers we've had are great."}
{"text":"I'm from the area and my family loved this place when I was younger, I was never a fan. My mom still loves it and wanted to go here for her birthday recently. Of course, we reluctantly agreed. There were about 15 of us with no reservations on a Saturday night. We were seated quickly and our waitress was awesome. I hadn't been in so long and didn't like it when I was there, so I asked my sister what to order. She gets the chicken romano. I decided I would give it a try... OMG! It was absolutely amazing. It's a thin piece of chicken, breaded and fried, then placed on melted butter (almost overflowing the plate) and topped with green onions and garlic. It was the size of the plate so I didn't eat the side of spaghetti that came with it. Since this visit, I have been back weekly and would recommend the NY Style Mild Wings and the Chicken Romano, sometimes I get them on the same visit and take the leftovers home. Portions are huge, service is great and the flavored iced tea is awesome! We will continue to visit and hope the food stays the same!

Side note: We went there two nights ago with our 1 year old daughter and realized we were out of milk, we asked if we could order a tall glass of milk. The waiter said he'd be glad to fill the bottle for us, so he asked us to take the lid off and filled it. When our bill came the milk was not on there. We asked them about it and they said, on the house!"}
{"text":"This place has been open for 50 something years. Now i know why its still open. Haha. Man oh man oh mannnnn. Boy was i wrong about this place. My friend took me,  after bragging about it for months, I just have to goooo. So..... we had the delicious fried zucchini, to veggie pizza, lastly to the baked pasta.  Everything was on point!!!! Okay, I know the fried zucchini is really bad for you, but what can you say. Yolo!!!!!! Lolz. It was mouth watering. Even the ranch was rich. The vegetarian pizza was amazing, I loved everything about it. The crust was crispy and thick. The marinara sauce was sweet and it was just perfect. Bell peppers,  onions, mushrooms and olives. ( of course I had to pick the olives ) :))

The service was wonderful, great atmosphere. Cute little homey place. I like it.

I shalllllll come back."}
{"text":"Finally got my hands on this pizza.........a little back story, first!

About 5 months ago, I was sitting at work, about to go to lunch, and a pizza craving hit (pizza cravings hit me ALL THE DAMN TIME...but I need to have some self restraint or I would be eating pizza every day and weigh 500lbs.)!  I had been to most of the \"good\" pizza joints near work and I kind of wanted to try something new.  Enter Red Devil.  I looked up their website online, picked up the phone and placed an order for a small cheese pizza.  The guy told me it would be about 25 minutes.  That was perfect timing since Red Devil is about a 20-25 minute drive from work.  I get down there, park, go up to the take out window and give them my number.  The guy looks at me and says, \"You never ordered a pizza...we don't have that number in our system, plus, I was the one taking orders for the last hour and we don't have your pizza\".  I know for damn sure I ordered it, had my number, drove all the way down here and was not hallucinating on ordering a pizza!  I show the guy my phone with Red Devils number on it and my minute long conversation.  He goes, \"Um...yeah...that's the Red Devil down on McDowell\".  My dumb ass ordered it at the wrong location.  I felt like such an idiot!  The dude was like, \"No worries man, I can whip you up a pizza in about 15 minutes\".  I passed because it would have been pushing the limits of my lunch break and I sadly walked away with my tail between my legs and with no damn pizza!  Bummer!   Fast forward to today.........

I called the correct number this time, and placed my order for a small cheese pizza with fresh garlic.  The guy said it would be ready in about 25 minutes so I drove down Bell to capture my pizza.  I walked up to the window, gave the guy my order number and he handed over my pie.  A small (10 inch...that's what she said!) pizza with garlic came out to $8.64.  I gave him $10.00 and told him to keep the change.  I took this pizza out to my car and dug in.  Here is how it was...............

Small 10\" pizza-  I opened the box and was impressed with what I saw.  It was cut into 6 small slices and it smelled great.  It had a ton of melted mozzarella as well as globs of minced garlic everywhere!  The crust had a nice little char/brown to it and you could tell it just came fresh out of the oven.  I picked up a slice and took a bite.  HOT AS A MOFO!  I should have let this thing cool down a bit.  The flavors were so good though, I didn't give a shit and motored through that first piece burning the roof of my mouth as I went.  Good cheese (a tad greasy), great tasting sauce and a ton of garlic did this pizza right!  The best part of this pizza was the crust!  It's a medium/thin dough..more on the thinner side but with a little \"body\" to it.  Right when I bit in, I knew it was great!  It had a slight crispy crunch on the bottom and then enough of a doughy chew to compliment it.  I studied the crust and noticed a whole bunch of little air bubbles in the dough.  I LOVE dough like that!  It's almost like eating fresh baked bread out of the oven.  It was mighty fine pizza dough and crust!  I mowed down my 6 slices in a matter of minutes and was sad when I was chewing my last piece of that amazing crust!  I would put this crust up there with La Grande Orange as being my favorite in Phoenix (strictly on crust rating/preference).  Both places have the same type of texture, and both places are absolutely fantastic!

Overall, I thought it was pretty damn good.  Red Devils have been around since the 60's and I can definitely see why.  I would not hesitate to come back for another pizza (Their Mediterranean pizza sounds awesome) and can hopefully make it through some of their other menu items, too.  Add this to the list of another great pizza joint in Phoenix!  It was great and with a few more visits, I can definitely see this becoming a 5 star joint!"}
{"text":"I was here with a friend on 4th July..

The Mushroom Ravioli was real good, flavorful.
The Chicken Romano was not real good. the flavor was deep fried right out and the sauce reminiscent of movie theatre butter..
May I suggest pan searing the chicken and rethinking the sauce...just saying"}
{"text":"I've never ever had a bad meal here. Service is fantastic, menu is huge. A fun place. If you go in with a bad mood, you'll walk out in a good mood."}
{"text":"We came here with family and it was a nice place that accommodated us perfectly considering we had 13 in our party. The server was fast and attentive. The kitchen was slow. The wings (medium and mild) and the fried zucchini were mmm mmm mmm. The pizza, however, was a total miss. I don't appreciate all the toppings sliding off of my slice due to it being soggy. The cheese was very good but the sauce lacked flavor. The ambiance of the restaurant is nice with dimmed lighting. Parking is limited but there is an empty lot across the street with additional parking."}
{"text":"Went here again on Valentine's Day with my goofball. Well, there was a wait, but what exactly do you expect on Valentine's Day? We were immediately greeted, and they put our names down and we waited. Was about a 20 minute wait, so honestly not as bad as I had expected considering how busy they were. We were offered water to drink while we waited. We were seated at a nice clean table, and our server this time was Jonathan. The love got a cherry Pepsi (well a Pepsi with cherry flavoring or something like that because they didn't have cherry Pepsi but were more than willing to make it) and I got an extremely delicious sangria with cherries in it and that tasted more amazing than any other drink I have ever had. We shared an order of 10 mild wings (the spicy sauce mixed with barbeque so it was amazing) then I ordered the trio which came with chicken Parmesan, pasta alfredo (which I added shrimp) and cheese raviolis. The chicken was good, the alfredo was good, and the shrimp were simply amazing. The ravioli was also good, I have zero complaints about my food except for the fact that I don't have any left lol. There was definitely enough for two meals though, which I did end up taking home and doing. Josh got a chicken Parmesan sandwich, and that sammich was so big he was stuffed even though he hadn't eaten all day. I finished the meal up with a piece of their amazing cheesecake, and I must say it was a great Valentine's Day. Wings: $7.50ish for 10, sangria:$7 Trio:$14(I think....) Sammich: $8 Cheesecake: $4. Oh also, the trio comes with soup, and you should try the clam chowder...yum. So food was great, price wise, about average for a fancier Italian place, and service was amazing. Even under all the stress of the day, our server never once lost his patience, and continued to be helpful, friendly, and informative the entire night. Also, something I don't usually see at restaurants, the manager was walking around checking up on everything. We'll be back."}
{"text":"This place has been a local spot for quite some time, and they definitely cater to the lunch crowd accepting takeout orders for pick up and speedy lunch service at the tables. My faves are the hot wings and the chicken Parmesan sub, they also have tasty fries and salads. The lunch specials are always worth checking out and they have a few TVs in case there are any sports on tv. The staff is friendly and the bathrooms are clean, all this makes it a great spot for lunch during the workweek."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I came here for the first time last week for our weekly \"cheat meal\". He wanted in n out but I convinced him to try this place out. We loved the pizza so much!! The bread was crispy all around. We went back today for our cheat meal, and we are going back next weekend! We are hooked!"}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough. Not a place I would drive by and be like \"I want to eat here\", however my boyfriend wanted to try it so I went with him. All I can say is this place has the best pizza and wings I have had in Phoenix. Great prices, always drinks specials, and  the service is awesome. We love this place! Definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"It's been a while since I have been here but I stopped in with mom the other day, so I figured now is a good time to give it a review. 

Decent pizza. I like the thin crust. This is a thin crust pizza that needs to be eaten with a fork and knife. Not crispy enough to pick up. 

The servers were very affectionate. By that I mean they called my mom babe and me love. I thought maybe it was just our server until I heard the server at the next table refer to her diners as sweetie and hun. Not a bad thing at all. Just kind of funny. And sweet. =) 

So if you are looking for someone to call you sweet nicknames while eating good pizza this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Red devil for 35 years and even worked there during college. The food is always pretty good! Now for the bad news, we went to dinner there last night and encountered a rude hostess named Cara. We arrived exactly at 6pm and wanted to get drinks on happy hour. She said, \"no but you can have dessert. This young lady should NOT being making the decision. Red Devil just took a LOYAL customer and tossed them out the door."}
{"text":"This place rocks! Great service, awesome food, and comfortable atmosphere. The prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Yum yum yum great food I like ordering the special myself Pizza n Wing Combo  1 topping pizza 20 wings hot is super yummy with some zucchini"}
{"text":"the owners know us by name, which is a bonus, however, I love this place, I have been coming here for quite some time, you can get a very good lunch special, however, I specifically like to order the combo, which is a large pizza topping with 24 wings, half boneless half bone in with a side of zucchini and I add additional top can't beat it"}
{"text":"Nothing too special here, but they have decent food and the service is usually pretty good.  The bar is kind of neat too, or I like it for some reason.  Very cozy and cute with a couple big flat screens on the wall and a dark atmosphere.  I reccomend it for grabbing some wine and an appetizer.  If you are in north phoenix and don't feel driving far then it's a good place if you're craving Italian."}
{"text":"I've been going to this Red Devil since I was a kid. I remember my Dad used to know one of the guys who made the pizzas in the front of the restaurant. Anyway, I went by Red Devil last night to pick up a pizza after getting out of continuing ed at 8:00. I had ordered a half cheese half Mediterranean pizza (spinach, ricotta, garlic, tomato). The pizza was 16$...a little pricey, but not for a specialty pizza. I brought the pizza home and unfortunately it was on the cold side (always a hazard when picking up a pizza) and they didn't include any crushed red pepper in the box (I guess I should have asked). Anyway, the pizza was good, but it was a bit too garlicky....and from me, that is a statement (I'm a huge garlic lover). The garlic stayed in my mouth after brushing my teeth so strongly it was hard to fall asleep....kind of a funny thing. Anyway, I will probably return here, but it isn't at the top of my list for pizza."}
{"text":"I have been to this Red Devil location a few times and it has been fairly good each time. They have decent pizza, and (imo) good bruschetta, because they put the tomatoes and whatnot on garlic bread... yum. Also, they give you a lot of food for reasonable prices. I had bought the living social deal and ended up getting a 14 inch three topping pizza and bruschetta for around 1$. Whoa! I was pretty proud. I went there for dinner tonight, and it was good, but the service was a bit shakey. Also, I got a white pizza with garlic amongst other toppings and it tasted like the garlic was forgotten.... sad day. I would recommend sitting in the bar. Also, PINBALL!!!!"}
{"text":"We picked up some pizza from here last night to take over to a friend's house and this is the Red Devil I always went to for family functions as a kid. I love this restaurant! The pizza was delicious and what really makes it is their italian dressing.....This dressing is soooo good and perfect to dip crust into. In the past I have tried many of their items, but mainly order their ravioli, which have always been quite tasty. Don't pass this place up for tasty pizza and pasta."}
{"text":"When I don't want to cook or drive far for dinner I find a spot in the cozy bar and dig into a crusty pizza or a weekly special. The early dinner menu is the bomb and includes dessert. Really! The wine pours are generous. Finally. It is like eating at mama's."}
{"text":"My pizza had no cheese. It looked like it was drop kicked. I'm from NY. I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed. You made me very sad."}
{"text":"Although we've never had the pasta or entrees, we've been coming to Red Devil for pizza, wings, and salad for over 20 years.  We love the crust and sauce of the pizza, and the wings are very saucy, but not soggy...perfect every time.  We love the dark, cozy ambiance of the restaurant.  It's a nice departure from the typical chain restaurants found in AZ."}
{"text":"I appreciate this place for its quiet existence. Humbly taking up a corner spot behind a Frys parking lot, specials everyday, friendly staff. Never had a bad time! The food isn't anything mind-blowing, but it's consistent. The Cheese Ravioli was obviously not house made, but still hit the spot on a late night 4/20... the salad that came with it was meh, iceberg mix. Garlic Bread is always good. I've had the Eggplant Parmesan here, it's good! Boyfriend has had the Veal Parmigiana, he really likes it! I don't eat veal so can't comment besides that. Overall, it's a decent spot for carb loading and for when you're too lazy to cook. I wouldn't drive out of my neighborhood for it but since I live close, I'll support the fam!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best pizza and wing joint in the Valley! This is the type of place you don't have to special order your wings to be crispy. They just come out perfect. Crispy on the outside and meaty and tender on the inside. The pizza also comes out perfect without modifying your order. Thin, crispy and a perfect New York fold. Our sever was friendly and funny. It's just a good Ole joint! Thank you Red Devil!!!"}
{"text":"Horrible. Lasagna taste bad. The garlic bread was a glorified hot dog bun. 
Chicken tenders were cold and mushy."}
{"text":"This place might not be the best of the best of the best sir, with honors.... But I really like the pizza here, nice and crisp with quality ingredients. I took it to go so I could not really evaluate the service and atmosphere but all that matters to me is the food! Way better then papa johns, Pizza Hut, dominoes, or any other commercial mass produced pizza chains. I actually ate the pizza for the first time up in pine top lakeside in northeastern arizona and been hooked ever since. It's above average. See if it's for you"}
{"text":"We had great service here, no complaints! Bread is addicting. Portions are very large here (thankfully so since this place is a little expensive in my opinion). $17 for the trio dinner (chicken parm, cheese ravioli, and fettuccine alfredo). The marinara sauce was really good. Kind of in a rougher part of town."}
{"text":"really great lunch small pizza special.  cold beer and great service at the bsr today.  first visit to this location.  if in area again will return!"}
{"text":"I've enjoyed dining at the Red Devil many times, though I hadn't been there for about a year until last night.  The food seemed pretty fresh, though I don't imagine how it could be.  I really enjoyed the \"Red Devil White\" pizza in a 10\" size; it's the perfect amount for two or three little meals (i.e. lunch, late-night snack, etc.)  Entrees like the Eggplant Parmesan or Lasagne come with a salad or soup and bread.  Several entrees also come with the option of a side of spaghetti included.  Each entree is between $10-$15, so this place isn't super cheap.  You do get enough food for your money, and service is relatively fast and easy.  It seems to be a very laid-back, East Coast style establishment, with simple decor and a somewhat tacky vibe.  I will definitely keep coming back when the mood strikes.  It beats waiting in line for two hours at Oregano's!"}
{"text":"Placed an order just after 7p and said would be delivered at 8:05p.  First they call me to tell me they don't have the soda I ordered and they will give me a store credit for the cost. (A store credit?).  I know I will never see that so let them substitute.  My order is done and he is just leaving. Driver calls 15 minutes later completely lost.  He's not sure how to use the GPS. 35 minutes later I still don't have food and don't want cold pizza. I call and speak to the Manager.  He says he will give me a store credit?  What?  I haven't eaten the food!!!!!  You can't give me a credit card credit for food I don't have and haven't eaten?  Shocked.  He says that he cannot help me and will have the general manager call me tomorrow.  How likely is that?  Probably never.  Lost a good customer. I do take out there about once a week.  Still dumbfounded by the lack of a credit card credit for my order that I didn't get or eat."}
{"text":"So, for more than a year, I drove by this place on my way to work but never checked it out. I wasn't sure what to make of a place with a walk-up takeout window. Last night, I followed a group of friends there for a late dinner. Didn't try any appetizers. I just split a 14' Italian special pizza--sausage, green olives and fresh garlic. The pizza was pretty good, not spectacular but definitely a couple steps above a place like Mamma Mia's whose pizza has a fast-food quality at times. Red Devil is very generous when it comes to toppings, at least on this one. I am an olive lover but haven't had green olives on pizza before. I enjoyed olives in every bite. But if you think olives are just okay, you might have found it a bit much. The pizza was kind of big for two people and with tax, it was about $18. So, I'd say it's fairly priced. 

I have to say that the service, more than the pizza, would draw me back. Servers who think of the little things before you even ask are much appreciated. We had a party of nine and our waiter was super patient. We also brought a birthday cake on the premises, which they allow. Our waiter started clearing all our plates and silverware and before I could ask, he said not to worry, he'd bring us clean plates and forks for the cake. He also saw someone with a camera and asked to take a picture. He just gave off a genuine vibe of being helpful. I would definitely consider it if in the mood for something casual but not carbon-copy fast food."}
{"text":"This used to be my \"go to\" pizza place back in the late 70's, and I suspect what many places have tried to copy since opening. The outside order window can't be beat, and I don't know of any other place like it...the only thing missing is an outdoor place to sit and eat.

Last night (Saturday) was a typical busy night, and I appreciated the attitude and patience of the employees, as the entryway is tight and crowded and not a lot of places to sit and wait for a table, let alone stand. Fortunately it had stopped raining and waiting outside was an option.

The pizza was better than expected and I was surprised it was as flavorful and fresh as I remembered. I guess I shouldn't be, for Red Devil is still around and as popular, if not more so, than it was back when I was a teenager and didn't appreciate quality like I do now...oh, and my 3 yr old granddaughter thought the cheese pizza was great! Passing on a tradition is going to be fun!"}
{"text":"For dinner take-out I ordered the Chicken Lasagna. It was amazing!!! So much flavor & right out the oven. The parking lot was packed so the dining experience must be good; I'll have to dine in next time."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza to go last night from Red Devil for the first time.  (It's actually closer to 34th than 32nd st, right across from the Dutch Bros coffee)  It was really good!  I got a white pizza with garlic, seasoned mushrooms, and canadian bacon.  Loads of toppings, great crust.  The only downside is that they don't deliver."}
{"text":"Took almost 10 minutes before I saw someone at the front. Waiter was not friendly. Food didn't have a lot of flavor. Bill was over $60 for two large pizzas, a childs meal, 1 drink that wasn't water. I won't be back."}
{"text":"It's amazing that I've never been to a Red Devil before.  Grew up right down the street from one, and a friend's family did big dinners there all the time.  Just never happened for me.  But today was craving Italian and figured I'd give it a try.  

The atmosphere of this location is definitely - utilitarian.  Kinda reminds me of some Chinese buffet restaurants.  Old school padded/metal stackable chairs and booths with rips in the vinyl covers.  Based on my seat, I got to hear all about the conversations of the folks working there as the waitress hang out seemed to be just out of my eye shot.  Not the smartest kids in class, but they're young.  My server was very, and a bit overly, attentive.  I had to avoid her eye contact as if I lifted my head and looked straight forward while eating she was at the end of the wall just staring at me.  Can you say uncomfortable? 

Anyhow, pretty good selection of food, but on a weekday at noon there was no lunch menu.  Not that dinner prices were over the top or anything, but it surprised me.  Pizzas looked great, and I'd heard good things in the past.  I tried their chicken lasagna and it was pretty good.  Nothing that is going to make me go running back for more, but it was fine.  

My favorite thing about the place were their rolls.  Hard on the outside with a crusty cracked top and when you open it the inside is soft, doughy and dense with quite a nice flavor.  Again, even that wasn't 100% amazing, but with a little tweak, or some garlic butter or herbed butter  vs. regular butter, they could really be great.  

Anyhow, seems like a nice family spot.  I may go again if the mood strikes, but I wouldn't feel heartbroken if I never went again either.  And that about sums it up."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the best caccitori in the valley. It's no gourmet Italian food, but if you ate Italian food at home growing up, try this place if your name ends in a vowel."}
{"text":"Ive been coming here for years and years. I have always loved the pizza, service and tiramisu! I always get the same thing but occasionally when I bring friends, they order different things and I try them. Always delicious. The cheese sticks are perfect, the garden salad (you can get get small or large, small is big enough for 2-3 people) is pretty plain but the house made italian and bleu cheese is great and then there's the pizza. I've tried a hell of a lot of pizza and this is definitely up there in the top 5. Seriously, no bullshit, just great pizza with delicious sauce and it heats up perfectly fine, too. I've had just about every server in there and service is always fantastic. Try this place, you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Great Phx original! Wonderful pizza & Italian food. A must try & great to go window. Several locations but McDowell is the orig."}
{"text":"In a word...grody.

The second I walked in the door I was lambasted by a serious stank. It smelled like sewage and industrial cleaners. I should have done an about face at this time but I foolishly pressed on.

I ordered the Red Devil white calzone, which was advertised as mozzarella, olive oil, fresh Roma tomatoes and garlic. The mozzarella was over abundant and flavorless, the tomatoes were mealy, underripe and were decidedly not Romas (likely Beefsteak or Mountain Pride). The garlic was nearly raw and jammed into the calzone by the fistfull. 

I'm not a restaurateur but in my estimation the two most oft repeated sins of Italian restaurants is to not make their mozzarella in house and to overload every dish with garlic. Mozzarella is easy and inexpensive to make and I love garlic but there is definitely such a thing as too much.

I will not be returning to this location. However it should be noted that I ate at the Pinetop location last year and both the food and the ambiance were excellent."}
{"text":"I ordered spaghetti and meatballs on Uber Eats and they refused the order. Lame. Guess $25 with salad, garlic bread and delivery fee wasn't enough."}
{"text":"I first heard of Red Devil because a friend of mine who used to live in Phoenix needs to stop by when she is visiting her family.  I needed to know what the fuss was about and so I gave it a try. We ordered two salads, veggie pizza and wings.   The house salads was really fresh and the dressing (ranch) was really good, the pizza was not overly greasy, if you want traditional pizza, this is the place and the sizes are fair too. The wings are amazing, although I could always use more sauce, they were perfectly crispy, not too dry and didn't have the frozen taste you sometimes get with some the other family pizza places."}
{"text":"very sad that a place i have frequented and enjoyed for over two decades has decided to change the way they make there pizza pies. this place had the perfect cheese to sauce ratio now its all cheese and no sauce. and way under cooked what the heck happened Red Devil, time to find a new affordable pizza pie this is truly a sad day."}
{"text":"NO.


This order as you walk in, pay there (including a tip) and have the food delivered to your table concept is awful and confusing and no bueno.  

The food at Red Devil is delicious, I'll state that for the record.  

The standing there and deciding what your whole table wanted to eat and drink as people queue up behind you and out the door idea is awful!!  And to make matters worse, since the person running the food out to the table (are they a waiter? a food deliverer??) has no idea what you ordered at the register, so when you mention that you also placed a To Go order to take to someone at home, you can expect a lot of confusion between the food deliverer, the kitchen and the person at the cash register.  What a frigging mess.  :/

I'll stick with the old fashioned sit down Red Devil restaurants, thanks."}
{"text":"I love this place. Since we moved a few years ago we forgot about this place - but realized that the house we are currently in is only about 10 minutes away.  This place could be considered a hole in the wall, but the restaurant inside is actually pretty spacious with rooms divided.  We sat towards the back, which is fine since we have a toddler.  Their hot rolls come out with butter and the rolls are so delicious and fresh and hot!  One could get full off of them.  

I ordered the seafood marinara pasta dish.  SO GOOD.  It's packed with big scallops, clams, shrimp and calamari mixed in with thin spaghetti and flavorful red sauce. And it's a huge portion, too!  

The hubs ordered 20 wings, naked (dry) with a side of buffalo and honey bbq sauce.  Perfectly crunchy skin.  

I have to remember that this place is not far from me - it's WAYYYYYYYYYYY better than an Olive Garden! :)"}
{"text":"We ordered take out.  Was great food. Had s large sausage and black olive pizza with no spices.  Very good. Excellent extra crispy chicken wings(10) and fried zucchini. Thank you Red Devil excellent take out dinner. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place has the best pizza and wings. I have been comimg here for 30 years and love it. The baked manicotti is really good as well. And their house salad with Italian dressing is a must"}
