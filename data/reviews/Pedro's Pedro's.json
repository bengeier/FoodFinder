{"text":"Mostly disappointing, but the price is good and it's palatable.

It's not as good as any of their competitors I've been to (Chipotle, Moe's, Qdoba, Hotheads) - which is disappointing because I really want to like this because as far as I know it's a local Cleveland chain/restaurant, I could be wrong but there doesn't seem to be any outside a couple in Cleveland.

I got a chicken bowl, bag of chips and guacamole - the grand total came in the ballpark of about $6.50. Bowl was $5 (for chicken, add $1 for steak or some other more expensive meats. The chips and guac I guess was $1.50, but based on their menu I seem to recall it being priced higher than that. Anyway the price is the best thing about the place, as a similar meal at their biggest competitor would ring around $10.

First of all the chicken was horrible, I should have known when I saw it and changed to something else. It was completely submerged in liquid, they shoveled it out from the deep depths of reddish liquid and drained it out - then put it on my bowl.. It tasted basically like it came out of a can - soft weird texture, with a tinge of taco-bell taste. I'd venture to say the chicken at taco bell is better, and that's about as bad as you can get. I don't know why they don't just opt for a simple marinated grilled chicken - if I came here again I definitely would not get the chicken, I'd try another meat or go vegetarian.

Otherwise everything was OK-good. The cilantro-lime rice was good although it was bland, didn't get much lime and didn't look like there was much cilantro - but it was cooked right.

The Pico de Gallo was good - probably the best salsa there, corn salsa was bland and soaking in water, the hot salsa was not hot or particularly flavorful.

The guacamole - again pretty bland. Not bad, but it's nothing particularly special.

Chips were a weird one, they were a yellow-corn chip which is fine - but half the bag looked like more of a white-corn chip. I'm not sure if they ran out of one, if it was just a different mixture. I'm not sure if they make them on-site or buy them, they tasted more like a higher-end grocery store chip. Could have probably benefited from some lime and maybe a coarser sea salt or something.

The line of about 3 people also moved way slower than it should have, I have no idea why - but the whole reason I came here was because it had one of the shortest lines in the place and I was in a hurry, but I probably could have gotten through the much longer Sakkio line in the same amount of time - for example.

Basically, the chicken was horrendous. Everything else was OK, nothing was as good as I wanted it to be except for probably the pico de gallo which looked fairly fresh and tasted good.

The price is really the only reason I give it 3 stars instead of the 2 it probably deserves. You can walk in with a $5 bill and get a meal that will fill you up.

Personally - I'd spend the extra $2-3 and go out of my way to go to any one of their competitors if I was in the mood for this type of quick american-mexican food, don't think I'll be coming back here personally."}
{"text":"Bland food and rude customer service. Skip this place, you will be disappointed. The food isn't that good and they were so rude."}
{"text":"Rude, rude, rude! They are never friendly, they act like they are mad that you're doing business with them, and they constantly treat a customer like you're an inconvenience. It's unfortunate, as I was really excited when this place opened in Tower City hoping to have quick Mexican food nearby work, but I've given them several chances and it's consistently poor service with bad attitudes and the food has usually been cold.  Avoid!!!"}
{"text":"Just awful! By now, enough of us out there have had Chipotle. It's loved by many because of their fresh ingredients and lack of greasy deep fried objects. Pedro's attempts to be a Chipotle-like business but completely misses the mark. If you're going to mirror your business with an existing/successful one, you'd better make sure your food looks and tastes good! It should, at the very least, taste close to the original. 

The cilantro-lime rice was wet and mushy, the steak didn't even look (or taste) like steak and the remaining toppings were bland and uneventful. On top of that, the staff seemed very inexperienced and borderline rude. It's hard to find REALLY good food inside Tower City. Pedro's now gets added to the list of places I'll never eat at again."}
