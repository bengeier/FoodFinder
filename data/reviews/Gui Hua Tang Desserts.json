{"text":"This place is decent.  It is one of the few dessert places, so I don't have much to go against.  My sister and I ordered 6 desserts and waited at the table.  We took out our cameras and started looking through the pictures we took.  The girl at the register suddenly says in an angry tone, \"don't take pictures here!  It is not allowed!\"  My sister and I was in shock.  I have a very quick temper so I turned to her and said \"don't worry.  We won't try to steal your menu.\"   Because of this, I can't even force myself to have the dessert.  On top of the rude attitude, they just threw our dessert on top of this crappy and sticky grey tray.  Needless to say, the second time I visited Toronto I did not stop here."}
{"text":"A great, little dessert shop in the Market Village you should definitely check out if you're ever in the mood for something sweet and refreshing. I've been here a couple of times and they offer a variety of good stuff ranging from teas, soups and puddings! They serve up both hot/cold desserts but no matter what, I will ALWAYS get the cold desserts (even if it's freezing and there's a snow storm outside - people will think I'm crazy but whatever). They're just soooo thirst quenching and I like the cold, chilly feeling it gives me in my mouth as I eat it. My all-time favorite dish would have to go to the Tapioca, Herb Jelly and Watermelon Combination. It's ooohh soooo good, I wish I had some right now! It's a nice once in a while change from the typical waffle, crepe and ice cream desserts."}
{"text":"Brought walnut paste from Gui Hua Tang today. It was not what I expected. The dessert came out to watery. There was a hint of rice but you can't really taste the walnuts."}
{"text":"If I can rate this a 0 I would. Worst place ever. The desert taste old, the price they charge are estimated on a very high charge, the bowl they use are for kids. After been though hell, they make you pay high tips with out giving you proper change. Just the worst place you can go."}
{"text":"This place is quite good! I enjoy their mango sago and sago cream with grass jelly. So refreshing after a hot day or just the end of a heavy meal. Price is not that cheap, but hard to find a good Chinese dessert place in this area."}
{"text":"My friend starts taking photos and the staff there started to comment that Menu shots are not allowed.  Okay, respect other businesses policy of course.  We sit down then realize it's a SELF-SERVE environment.  We ask for Herbal Jelly and pay the \"Lady with Attitude\" that grab our Desserts and place it roughly onto the plastic tray.  I can accept attitude most of the time but not from her FUGLY face.    We ate our so-so Herbal Jelly that did have bitterness to it however not as BITTER as some others, but the Lady's look brings another level of Bitterness to our overall experience.  I bring back the empties to her and she ignores me.  Good thing I don't have to TIP her."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of black sesame paste but my aunt insisted I try some of hers. Surprisingly I liked it! My aunt said this place is her favourite place to get this. My cousin got the watermelon grassjelly and he seems to really enjoy that too. I will remember this place next time I'm around the area."}
{"text":"In my previous review I said I wouldn't come back until I tried the other desserts in the area. Well, we had to come back after our awful experience at Tracy Dessert.    Black sesame paste ($5) is SO GOOD, and not just in comparison to Tracy. We also got two bowls of cold Gui Ling Gao ($7.50 each) to share among three people. We ended up ordering two more! I prefer the cold over hot, but the hot Gui Ling Gao showcases the herb taste better."}
{"text":"This place has Hong Kong written all over it.  I had a smile across my face as I walked closer to this place. It brings back so many memories as I sat down and ordered the guilinggao and tea eggs. The coconut sago was so refreshing since it felt like the first day of spring in April. The service was fast, place and tables were clean.   Over all, this place is as authentic as it'll get when you're from NYC like me."}
{"text":"OMG! I don't know why we don't have legit HK dessert places like this in the states! Seriously the only reason why I come to Toronto. These r desserts that I grew up on but can find any restaurants or shops that have them."}
{"text":"As other people have said, people have attitude here.  I don't know if it's the same lady everyone's talking about but she has glasses.  We have an expression \"give them a gold cow and they still wouldn't smile\" sums up the staff here.  If you want anything hot they just put it into a microwave to heat it up (sago pudding).  It must really bite to work here or else people just don't know what happiness is here.  It's too bad there aren't more dessert places, I think people come here because they are desperate since there's nothing closeby."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here and I come for one thing; black sesame paste.  Their black sesame paste is made with a stone grinder, and they don't use corn starch to thicken the paste.  On top of the thin and silky smooth paste is a flimsy layer of oil; that's how to differential between a good paste and the bad.  This is the most delish black sesame paste!  I am adamant; the 5 star is for my fave dessert - the only dessert that I have ever tried here.  Good friendly service!"}
{"text":"Old school tea/dessert parlor. Only a few tables and it's self serve (score! don't need to leave any tip puhaha). My dad ordered the grass jelly and the rest of us ordered the black sesame paste/soup. Super smooth and one of the best I've had. I guess, I shouldn't be surprised, it's Canada! It wasn't thick, or thin, but just right. Drool. It was a nice finish after a meal.   Be warn, don't take pictures. Although I didn't try, I wouldn't chance it to ruin your dessert experience.   This place is tucked inside a mall."}
{"text":"Out of absolutely nowhere, I was craving Almond paste/soup. Like, out of NOWHERE. So, I asked my parents if we go to Pacific Mall for dim sum so I could get some almond paste. Luckily, they obliged! (only 'cause it's asian food)  But you know what's funny about this whole situation? I used to -hate- almond soup. We would come to this dessert place and I'd always get either Black sesame or... y'no that's about it. Then like I said out of nowhere I just HAD to get my little hands on it.   Breakin' it down:  Buy. Search. Sit. Wait. Look. Sniff. Sip. Smile.  Then sip some more.  It was good. But after halfway I was a bit bored of it. I guess it was just to satisfy a bizarre craving.  I also tried the pumpkin basil sago. I'm sure it contained granadilla as well since there were bits that looked like toad eggs! The taste was pretty much like a pumpkin soup. I forgot it even had basil in it and the granadilla didn't really work for me.  Overall:  Doesn't compare to Hong Kong, but hey,  good to satisfy your asian needs once in awhile!"}
{"text":"This dessert place has been going strong for at least 20+ years now. My boyfriend and I stopped by here for a quick snack today. $3.15 for 2 tea leaf eggs. They were pretty good. Tasty but not too salty. I've also had their chilled lima bean pudding with coconut juice and it's one of my favorite things there. Prices have definitely gone up over the years due to inflation but comparable to other Asian dessert places.   Small store with only about 4-5 tables that seat about 4 people max. Not recommended for big groups. Love their traditional- looking tables and chairs. Decor hasn't changed much in the last 20 years. A good place to stop by and grab a sweet refreshment."}
{"text":"Many places claim the use of freshly grind for their Almond, Walnut, Black Sesame paste, etc.  This place does a decent job of such, and the Almond paste and Black Sesame paste I had were very fresh and full of flavors.  Not too sweet just like the way I prefer.  Good place to take a break from wandering around this mall that resembles a throwback to the 80's.  Surprisingly, some of the businesses have been around since the early 2000 when I first visited.  This is one of them."}
{"text":"Gui Hua Tang Desserts is set up in a way of more like a self served dessert restaurant.   You placed your order in the front counter, if your food does not need any preparation, you just carry it to one of the tables on a plastic tray. If you order a steamed egg custard or something need preparation, the cashier will tell you the waiting time and you just pay and wait for the order to be called and you pick up your food.  Yes the service is quick, as I don't have to wave down a waitstaff to place my order and wait for it to be delivered or wait for them to bring me my bill! so great if you are in a hurry!  The Jelly Essence I ordered tasted pretty good.. not too bitter, just need a touch of syrup to make it tasty.  And if you need some water to go with your dessert, it is also self serve.  The menu is more limited to dessert, not like other places that serves a lot of snacks, set lunch or afternoon tea set. However, this is good in a way because Gui Hua Tang can concentrate on what they do the best, Chinese desserts!!  Cash only!"}
{"text":"All time favorite - I can eat it three times daily.  Watermelon sago/grass jelly in coconut milk   Double baked egg   Chinese tea to reduce inflammation"}
{"text":"I totally agree with \"girl with attitude\" staff! In fact ALL of them are \"girls with attitude\" except the kitchen because they are not girls and not young. The kitchen staff are older and nicer. But all they do is bring out the order.  The girls (like 16-20) at the front are terrible.   Still this is a decent, sure I'll visit again, desserts place with lots of great choices! Prices for tea are pricey, I think, but average in Canada. It's $3-5 ish per cup. $2.75 for small so I will pass.  The mango with aloe and sago (this place calls it \"gold with white pearl\" or something pretty like that). It's milky mango soup with sweet aloe chunks (very little) and sago, served cold. It's super small of course for $5.50  Again it's pricey. But average price in Canada. How sad.  Tip: I didn't notice much the bad attitude because my best friend and I were having the best date ever. Nobody could bring us down. So for all future visitors: bring some great company! We smiled and laughed and talked as I scrambled for change. OMG I might have been her worst customer that day because I couldn't calculate 45 cents. The only reason I notice the \"bad attitude\" was when I read the reviews here! And then I remember her b*ch face!!!"}
