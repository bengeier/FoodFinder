{"text":"It's morning and the leftover still taste amazing. We ordered the standard butter, taste great and not like your normal butter chicken. We also ordered the chicken korma which had a nice fresh tasty sauce. Even the naans were fluffy and flavorful. Would love to go back again."}
{"text":"Craving Indian on Yonge Street?  This is the place to be, the food is decent and authentic,  the service is great and the menu is reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Loved chicken momo's, service was good. If you are having buffet, it is worth the price."}
{"text":"I was surprised just how good this place is!

A few months ago, I had a Groupon, so I thought I would try out Kathmandu at its new location.  It shut down at its old location.  I went with a friend.  We were both amazed!

From the beginning, the service was excellent.  In fact, I wish I had written down the server's name, because he was courteous, attentive and prompt.  He explained each dish in detail, especially since Nepali food is unique [although some people confuse it with Indian cuisine].

In general, when going to South Asian restaurants, if you want to taste the best dishes, avoid the lunch buffet and instead, ask the server about a la carte dishes that are either unique or specialities of the restaurant.  Which is exactly what we did:  We asked about uniquely Nepali dishes.

The food was delicious and different in taste from Indian cuisine.  I love Indian cuisine, but I also enjoy the distinct tastes of Chinese, Thai, French, Mexican and Italian cuisine--especially their regional differences.  So, my friend and I were about enjoy the Nepali food for what it is.

We left a generous tip because the server deserved it.  Overall, there is no doubt that Kathmandu is one of the best South Asian restaurants [including Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Sri Lankan] restaurants in Toronto in terms of taste, service and value.

Bravo!"}
{"text":"I was on my way to an Ethiopian restaurant and saw this place along the way and thought, why not. Oh how I wish I'd kept on walking.....

First, this is not a Nepalese restaurant, it is definitely indian. I was lured in by the fact that they listed a number of goat curries on the menu and I do love me some goat. I haven't seen many restaurants in College Park with goat on the menu and since they had so many varieties I figured they must know what they are doing. I ordered the cucumber salad (3.99) and the goat thali (13.99). When I arrived the restaurant was somewhat empty, though there was one large table that was being served entrees and another very large group that was filing in. 

The server brought water out immediately along with papadam + chutney, which was nice. They were diligent about refilling water in my experience. Also, my food was served pretty quickly. The cucumber salad was huge -- I mean giant, certainly not appropriately sized for a single person. 

The food was ok, but not great. The flavor of the goat curry was ok, but the goat was not cooked long enough and was quite tough. You wouldn't be able to eat this curry with naan -- it needed a knife! Much of it was bones, which comes with the territory and would be fine if it were tender such that the bits of meat were capable of being removed from the bone. The goat thali came with daal (lacked flavor, good texture), and aloo gobi (meh) and a gigantic mound of rice. This was the largest thali I had ever seen in my life and I have eaten many a thali. It was honestly preposterous. Needless to say, there was no way I could finish.

And then came the waiting. Things kind of picked up in the place and they are horribly understaffed. I waited no less than 30min before someone finally came to ask if I was done. There was a ton of food left and I assumed they would box it up, but instead, 10 or so minutes later they brought the check. I didn't bother to argue, because honestly, I just wanted to leave at that point. 

I think I've been spoiled by living in the California Bay Area for a long time before Toronto and I have found the flavor of the curries etc in Toronto to really lack depth. The exception to this is Mehran on Church St in College Park. It ain't pretty to look at, but they know how to cook. Next time when the desi urge strikes in College Park, I will head for Mehran."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Indian/Nepalese restaurant downtown.

The lunch buffet, served from 11:30-3:00PM M-F, at $11.99 is great. Their salad dishes are fresh and tasty. The main dishes are delicious and taste just as great as if you ordered a la carte.

Prices outside of lunch hours can be a bit steep ($15 for a take out order of saag paneer with naan bread), but totally worth it.

They also deliver but require an order of at least $30."}
{"text":"Had dinner here in January 2016. Wonderful experience overall. Delicious, well-prepared food and friendly servers. No complaints from anyone in our group. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place - I wasn't expecting much considering the shabby surrounding stores. 

We had the aloo ghobi (typical), chicken khorma (yum!!) and mutter paneer (pretty good!). I was also impressed by the naan - it was flat unlike other places that make it more puffed up. 

If you're in the area and looking for Indian food, this is your best bet."}
{"text":"Yesterday night was the first time I came here and had a very pleasant experience. The restaurant was nice and warm so we felt real cozy after coming inside from the Toronto cold.

The host who seated us was very nice. Same goes for the waitress and guest appearance from one of the chefs who brought out a dish for us. The employees who work there have such a nice aura about them.

The food was good but it is a bit mild compared to some Indian restaurants. My friends and I ordered the chicken biryani, butter curry paneer, butter chicken, goat vindaloo, and the tandoori naan. It came with complimentary yogurt as well. We were very big fans of the goat vindaloo and the tandoori naan which was baked to perfection (very soft and fluffy). The other dishes were okay, they weren't tasteless but lacked the quintessential spice kick that we were used to. Their butter chicken is made sweeter than conventional butter chickens but it is nice. Wasn't a huge fan of it but that's definitely a preference bias; some may love it.

Worth noting was how accommodating the staff were. I requested for some additional peppers to add to my dish and they were very cool about it. Brought me some very delicious hot peppers right away. 

My friends and I ate for 25 bucks each and I believe it was a pretty good amount of food for that price. Also, the service was flawless so that was also a plus. 

The restaurant does cater to a more diverse crowd, which is good as I know not everyone can handle a lot of spice. Personally the lack of spice was my own little qualm with it but the restaurant is a really good place to check out.

If you're like me, just order some additional hot peppers and you'll be good to go :)."}
{"text":"I went to get take out from this place the other day. The server was really friendly but the ambience was absolutely terrible. The air conditioner didn't work that day. I would probably not dine in ever. I ordered the chicken biryani which also didn't taste like biryani. Neither did it taste like biryani nor was it good. I've heard their butter chicken is good so I would be willing to get take out and give it another shot. But I will definitely not be Dining in the restaurant"}
{"text":"The food here was among the best I've had in quite a while, but the service was slow.  At least two other tables became frustrated because they couldn't get water refills or their check, and there appeared to be a dispute between two of the wait people that played out in front of the restaurant in the form of scowls and terse comments.  After we finished our food, we sat for an inordinately long time with no one to pull our plates, offer us dessert or bring the check.  People arrived at the front door and were turned away while we sat wishing for an opportunity to clear out.  We finally approached someone in the back and requested our check.  The food is definitely good, but I'd suggest going to this restaurant at an off-peak hour to get better service.  Better yet, just get take-out."}
{"text":"They seem proud of their nepalese culture, but when I asked what on the menu is distinctly nepalese, I got an uncomfortable pause... so really, think of Kathmandu as an Indian restaurant.

Still, what food!! We got the eggplant bharta and the butter chicken and it was delicious. Service was good and I thought the price was very reasonable. A tip: just go with the regular naan, the fancier cashew nut naan didn't add anything to the experience and turned out a bit oilier. 

I think the only thing keeping this from being a 5 is the ambiance and d√©cor, which is pretty old school. I will go back for the food though, which is really whats important!"}
{"text":"Best Indian/Nepali food around.."}
{"text":"Amazing food, quick service, and excellent customer service. 

The Kashmiri naan was amazing, as was the house special- full of chicken. The momo's and Samosas were the best part of the meal. Even the wine selection was good. Reasonable prices too for a 1/2 liter of Parteger b&g! definitely will be making the 5 hour drive from michigan more often for this gem"}
{"text":"Love the food here. The quality is consistent!! Been coming here for years! Amazing staff. Quite ambience and quick service."}
{"text":"We had the groupon for the lunch buffet for $7 instead of $12 (the lunch buffet is 12.99 so we had to pay an extra dollar).
I see a lot of bad reviews about the service, but our waiter was great! He was very attentive although the place was full and he was the only waiter. We didn't have to ask for anything - he just kept the water and the naans coming :D
The buffet had various vegetarian options and a lot of salads so was more than enough for vegetarian and all were yummy. Also a nice selection for the deserts: rice pudding, Ras gula, and ice cream.
Food wasn't as spicy as I like, but I understand they make it to cater the north american pallet. 
I'm not a fan of buffet meals, but with the groupon, this was a great deal."}
{"text":"I went here based on Yelp reviews and was not disappointed. The food was great. I had shrimp in spicy sauce and cheese naan. Both very good. Decent service, reasonable price. I'll be going back here the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I bought a voucher based on the review of about average of 4 stars.   I was disappointed.   I don't understand why other people give 4 stars average.

I thought this is a high class restaurant based on the voucher price but I was disappointed.   They claim the original price is $40 each person which I expect a good meal.   I found the renovation not good, need update.   The food is salty.   The entries are very small, smaller than the appetizer.   There are restaurants which give you small portion if you have a voucher.   I believe this restaurant is one of them.   They charge 4 small shrimp for $19 which they called jumbo pawn.   Just 4 small shrimps, nothing else.   The shrimp is not fresh, just salty.   I should have taken pictures to show how small it is.   If I order the entree alone I will stay hungry when I leave."}
{"text":"The only reason this place got two stars is because I am quite unqualified to judge Indian food, not liking anything spicy hot.

I do like lamb (the special posted on the window which was never mentioned inside the restaurant) so I ordered some and, although the sauce was too hot for me, I simply scraped it off and the lamb was very nice.

The naan was good as an appetizer.  I cant discuss the veg as they were too spicy for me.  The cucumber tomato onion salad seemed oddly dry and rubbery and was too heavy on very strong hot onions.

Service was downright awful.  The servers were Chinese or Filipinas (not sure), with zero knowledge of the food they were serving.  I asked what were the two sauces served with the naan, they did not know.  Other questions about the food were met with quickly dissolving smiles.  The food took forever to arrive, though the special was supposedly prepared in advance.

Not much else to say on this one that could be helpful to anyone, just that it wasn't for me.

Jen"}
{"text":"I live a stone's throw from this place and wouldnt have visited it if I hadn't read the reviews online. Firstly the name Kathmandu doesn't make you think of delicious Indian cuisine. Secondly the appearance from the outside is just about ok. However, the food is amazing! The butter chicken is soooo good. It's my husband's favourite dish and he can safely say it's the best butter chicken he has tried so far in Toronto. The chicken vindaloo is also great - just the right level of spiciness! Another dish I would recommend is the Eggplant Bharta. Absolutely amazing. Also try the bullet naan (naan stuffed with green chillies)."}
{"text":"Great food, but the Eggplant Bharta has a lot of oil in it.
The vegetable Thali is great.  It comes with basmati rice, saag paneer, naan, and curried vegetables.

This restaurant is located on Yonge St (South of Maitland ST)."}
{"text":"I had a pretty bad experience here. While the staff were friendly, the service was extremely poor. My friend and I had to ask for a refill on our tea about three times and it still took about 45 minutes to arrive. Our food also took about an hour and fifteen minutes to arrive at our table. Also the food was extremely spicy so we needed many refills of water, but the servers seldom came by with water."}
{"text":"Had their $7 take out lunch for the first time. Excellent butter chicken and large servings also. Pakorkas were also really tasty! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Bought Groupon for four for $92. Which says each person get appetizer up to 12.95. but when u order nothing is more than $6.95. BIG CHEATER. Same with main meal Can order hoti 18.95. but no  vegetation dish is more than $10.95. BIG SCAM to get people in. I do not think we ate what we paid. Got cheated by these crooks. Took one hour before we got our food. Had  no taste. With taxes end up paying $120. Please do not buy Groupon."}
{"text":"If sub-subpar chicken biryani is what you're looking for, look no further. At this culinarily South Asian sauna (the air conditioning wasn't working, making a three minute wait seem like an hour long ordeal), the biryani was touted as 'saffron-infused rice with chicken'. My finely honed brown senses, although, told a different story: it tasted like nothing more than steamed rice with some sort of basic curry mixed in and left to sit for a good while. 

If you happen to chance upon this place, though, worry not: the butter chicken I'd tasted once was 100% legit. Let's see what a future visit has to say."}
{"text":"Good and cheap Nepali food. Love the sizzler and thali. Momos were decent and the achar/sauce was amazing, which I consider to be a very important part of the momo eating experience! Would definitely recommend the regular menu rather than buffet."}
{"text":"Great food, the butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, aloo mutter, pakoras, samosas, garlic naan and every other dish we have tried have always been consistently delicious.

It does get a bit busy, which means the service can be a bit slow at times, but it's always friendly."}
{"text":"Went here on a non-buffet hour. The restaurant was completely empty and that should've been our sign to leave, but we stayed and ordered anyway. Service was extremely slow and prices were outrageous for Indian food. I could tell that what I was eating was leftover from the buffet lunch. They have very little combos / deals / specials that you can order from, and they add gratuity for groups under 5?!  Not ever going back there again."}
{"text":"Having grown up in Nepal I was SORELY disappointed to find that all Nepalese restaurants in Toronto, are just Indian restaurants that also serve momos. I don't get it... the market is saturated with Indian restaurants, and the only place that sort of serves Nepali food is Himalayan Kitchen, why would the Nepalese not want to take advantage of being the first?  Kind of ironic, Nepali people serving Indian food, and Tibetan people serving Nepali food. 

Ahhh, anyways, I guess this is meant to be a review and not a rant. So I will say, I went in expecting Nepali food - so I tried their momos (tibetan/nepali dumplings) and thaali. The momos were okay, but then for me any momo is better than no momo. When I read thaali, I expected the Nepalese curry, daal and veggies, but it was all Indian. :( oh the travesty! 

Don't worry Kathmandu Restaurant, you're not the only one I'm disappointed with (here's looking at you Mt. Everest). Come on Nepalese people of Toronto!!! Open an authentic Nepali restaurant already! I would cash in on that so fast if it weren't for the fact that I suck at cooking, but I excel at eating, so you'd already have one loyal customer in me."}
{"text":"Was craving some Indian food and heard about this place that offered Nepali food as well. Jackpot, momos here I come. But I won't be back. 
Being the glutton for variety, Of course I pick a Sunday to come and there is no buffet option. 
Needless to say I decide to try some variety. The menu has a lot to offer, but not overwhelming like other Indian places, but it is a bit pricey. $8 for momo appetizer and $21 for the thali. 
I decided to try the samosas and chicken momos to start. To my surprise the first course was actually a papad served with mint chutney and jaggery sweet sauce.  
The momos (Nepali version of dumplings) were fresh, a little thick on the batter, the filling was seasoned heavily with coriander and served with a tomato chilli paste that was probably would not have been my first choice. It tasted more like the tomato base or marinade of a curry. 
The vegetable samosas were hot, fresh and tasty with a decent amount of filling, but served on wilted lettuce and dehydrated carrots. 
The soup of the day (dhaal) was hot but average at best. It was more like rasam but needed a kick and salt. 
And now the non-veg Thali. Minus the thali. Served in individual bowls, there was a mixed grill with a deliciously marinated and flavored tandoori chicken and prawn. The chicken kabob was dry and meh, the Sheek kebab dry and not fresh. 
Accompanying this was the vegetable dish, a mixed vegetable South Indian style dry dish with carrots, pumpkin, potato, peas and zucchini(?).... When did Indian dishes come with zucchini? Nevertheless it was tasty. The basmati rice (pulao) was seasoned well but dry. 
The lamb saag was good and the boneless lamb was tasty with just the right amount of ginger and spice. The plain naan was soft, hot and light. 

The restaurant itself is quaint and chopped off with multiple floor layouts/sections and clean. The service was good and very polite. A huge plus is it doesn't smell like curry so those worried about going out after a meal should have no fear. (Seriously it's a thing)"}
{"text":"Best Nepalese restaurant I ever been to. Staff are very friendly and nice ambience as well. Recommended!"}
{"text":"We've been here four times, and have never left disappointed.  We had the chicken tikka masala, lamb korma and garlic naan last night.  My tastebuds are still dancing happily =) .  The decor is nondescript, but the food here is outstanding.  Five stars!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food.  I love this place.  I used to go all the time when I lived over off of Yonge St.  Now I go across the city for this place.  I love the pappadums, the butter chicken, and the alhoo gohbi.  The lunch buffet is a great deal.  I always leave completely stuffed!"}
{"text":"Went here for the lunch buffet and loved it.  I'm not an expert on Indian but I loved this place."}
{"text":"The food is really flavorful here, but the wait is long so I usually take out from this place if I am craving indian food. They do give you less food than other indian restaurants, but I think their quality if better than an average indian restaurant. I usually cook my own basmati rice at home and order the lamb vindaloo and tandoori chicken. Delicious!"}
{"text":"just came back from a lunch buffet at this restaurant (my first time here), and felt the need to yelp about it immediately! the buffet was $12.99 (its a dollar more cuz its a saturday), and it was absolutely delicious! every item i had was amazing (other than the veg pakora which didnt taste so fresh).. the butter chicken was divine (a little sweet, thats exactly how i like it!), and the tandoori chicken was ridiculously good! i was actually super full and wasnt planning on tasting the tandoori chicken, but i kept seeing people go back to the buffet just for the tandoori chicken, so i decided to try it! and im glad i did! the vegetable curries were also all excellent, there was saag paneer, a chickpea dish, and another vegetable dish with a mix of vegetables, and a green bean dish (sorry i dont know their indian names).. i tasted all, and they were all really good! i didnt want to waste space on salads or desserts so i cant comment on those! ive tried so many different indian restaurants in toronto, and i found the quality of the buffet items here to be better than the a la carte in most, and much more reasonably priced of course! we paid just under $40 for 2 people, (2 saturday lunch buffets, 2 soft drinks, tax, and 15% tip).. which is pretty cheap for the quality and quantity! will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great food and great service here. 

I always find that when I order India food the portions look small but once I start eating I'm extremely satisfied/full by the end. 
The staff was really great here.  One of the guys even put fresh cherries in out drink that he just got from the market,  he said he thought we'd prefer fresh Cherries to the maraschino one,  and he was right, so much better. 

The food was good, not the most amazing but still good.  Great naan and lassies.
All in all,  delicious food,  friendly staff and a spacious place.  What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"I don't think we've had a dish that we didn't like here.  Good food, friendly service, ambiance is par for the course.  The buffet is good, but its worth stopping in for dinner to order a-la-carte.  And if you have the stomach for it, try the bullet naan. Absolutely torturous."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night with my brother. Based on the store front, we probably wouldn't have entered. Don't let the decor or lack of customers throw you off but the food was pretty good!

Neither of us were very familiar with Indian or Nepalese cuisine aside from samosas, pakoras, butter chicken, biryani, momo, etc so we ordered samosas ($4.49/2) and the everest non vegetable thali ($14.99).

I got the curry chicken and my brother got the lamb. Both came on a segmented metal tray with seasonal vegetables, plain basmati rice, curry chicken, raita, pickled veggies, tandoori naan, lentil curry and rice pudding which was the dessert.

The samosas are about the size of a fist and were so delicious! Crunchy on the outside and filled with steaming spiced potatoes and peas!
The rice didn't have any flavour like the kind I'm used to eating: fragrant and slightly chewy. It did however complement the heavy spices and seasoning of each curry very well. The chicken was slightly overcooked but the creamy sauces helped with the moisture. Both of us agreed that the tandoori naan was the best part! Perfectly warm, slightly crisp and had an amazing chewy and fluffy texture. Great for soaking up the curry with! 

Overall, staff were very friendly and food came fast. The dishes were so full of flavour and complemented each other so well. The naan is a must!... even on its own. It may not look like a lot of food at first but we definitely left feeling stuffed. Again, decor could use a makeover but the food speaks for itself."}
{"text":"Went here after a raving recommendation from someone. Was disappointed. Especially if you are Indian and have eaten real Indian food. I think it's catered more for non Indians.
Food was ok but very pricey for the quantity and quality. You can get great food for less or same price.  I wouldnt come back here. 
Staff was friendly and nice though."}
{"text":"Visited with some friends for a quick dinner on a chilly night. Quickly noticed that this is a nice warm and cozy place to have a quiet dinner to catch up. The servers are friendly and show passion for the food being served. 

The dinner special is well sized and has a good mix of flavours, though there are also some good combos which can be found on the back page of the main menu that should also be looked at. Their vegetarian and meat options both come out well so both dietary options are well covered. The only issue I noted with the food is the proportion of carbohydrate base that was given, rice and pita bread... just a bit heavy on the starches. I'm thinking it would save them some trouble and waste if they asked the customer if they wanted half portions or just one of the two. 

The prices are pretty reasonable for dinner, but I felt like the prices would make for an expensive lunch."}
{"text":"I would say the food is decent and you can specify any sort of modifications. It's not 'wow' but just 'meh'. You could go to any other Indian restaurant in the same price range ($9 and up) and get the same tasting stuff. It also takes forever for the food to get on your table. 

The decor is just ghastly. It's terribly lit. And I don't think they have had a make-over in more than a decade. The music, furniture, and staff make it one hell of a gloomy place. 

If you are in the area and want to fork out money for 'Indian food'  - then you might as well go to 'Biryani House' which is just one block north, by Wellesley station. Their food is definitely worth every dollar!

I have visited this restaurant a couple of times over a few years. Recently, there has been a huge turnover off the staff and I am definitely not going back any more. The service is just terrible now."}
{"text":"I love you, Toronto!  Where else in the world that I could have Spanish tapas for dinner and a lips-smacking good Indian buffet for lunch on the following day?

I was afraid this would happen.  I knew I should have come here for the buffet.  Kathmandu Kathmandu has already won me over and earned 4 stars for their awesome dinner items.  Now, I'm completely head over heel.  Thanks to their impeccable buffet.

Fresh.  Hot.  Tasty.  Good variety.  Affordable.  Great service. 

No tiny bits and pieces of tandoori chicken here.  Instead, large pieces of drumsticks and breast+wings.  Holy Heaven, they are scrumptious.  I dare you to have only one piece.

The divine Butter Chicken, it is one of my favorites.  I just can't get over the generous size of the chicken pieces.  The sauce, that flavorful sauce!

Saag Aloo, I don't know how to describe the love I have for this dish.  Just trust me, it's wonderful!

To top it off, fresh hot from the oven a basket full of naan delivered to your table as a part of the buffet.  

Oh, Kathmandu Kathmandu, what are you doing to me?"}
{"text":"We landed up at the restaurant unplanned after our previous choice was closed and were taken care of immediately. The place looked great, and the food was brilliant. The person who took our order was very knowledgeable and friendly.
Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Tried to use the online ordering system, waited the 40 min, got to the restaurant and the staff looked at me with a blank face.  No order received, no food ready-there goes $75 in profit for them."}
{"text":"Me and my husband went in for lunch buffet on weekend and were quite disappointed by the quality of food. We are vegetarian so only tried vegetarian dishes, so can't comment on meat dishes. First of all the variety was quite less compared to other similar buffet places. It was like any other Indian place but the food was bland. The chickpeas were slightly undercooked, the potatoes in mix veg was also undercooked. The saag paneer was totally bland with very little pieces of paneer in it. Even in desserts, we tried gulab jamun, which was hard and cold. The only good thing was the ice cream. The place is expensive with average quality food. I would not go again and not recommend the place to anyone, specially if you are looking for Indian food."}
{"text":"I went to this place for a late lunch/ early dinner. It was fairly busy for Family Day, and unfortunately there was only 1 waiter for the whole place. Needless to say, service was very slow, decor was lacking (looked tired and old) -- but the food was excellent. We ordered: chicken jalfrezi, paneer butter masala and aloo paratha. Everything was super delicious and came out piping hot and fresh. The chicken was good size pieces of white meat (no bones or fat). 

I feel that the prices were a bit high, considering it looks like a whole in the wall. The food was great though, and I would probably come back here again."}
{"text":"This restaurant represents a rather serious disconnect between myself and apparently most other Yelpers.... I've given this place a couple of tries and frankly, do not see the appeal. 

AUTHENTICITY:   At best, it's diluted Northern Indian - there really isn't a whole lot of Nepalese anything going on here...

FOOD - Well, it's not the worst I've ever had, but the price/serving/quality ratios are so out of whack that it's kind of an affront to the senses.  Also noticed a high degree of sameness - even among dishes that share very few core ingredients.

SERVICE - Just the right blend of indifference deftly laced with incompetence and just a tiny dollop of contempt.  

PRICING - Seriously?  Five bucks for plain Naan?  FYI they had the testicular fortitude to call it a four piece order (one average size naan

You can do sooooo much better for soooo much less in sooooo many places within 2km of here. WHY WOULD YOU BOTHER?  The second star?  Kind of a mercy pop -simply because we get a lot of enjoyment out of making fun of them ...."}
{"text":"We have been patronizing this restaurant since it was on Yonge Street and the quality of the food, especially the vegetarian food (my husband, mother and I are vegetarian) is consistently exceptional. 
A lot of Indian/Himalayan restaurants which have a few similar dishes, have let their standards drop over time. The food has become greasy and all the dishes seem to be soaked in the same oily sauce. I have stopped visiting and ordering from those. Kathmandu has remained every bit as good and even gotten better over the years, with fresh, clean tasting food exploding with a variety of flavours and textures. The Paneer Tikka is a personal favorite.
The staff is very friendly and the prices are reasonable.
The current chef(s) seem particularly talented.
Please don't ever change, Kathmandu Restaurant!"}
{"text":"Good food I didn't try there buffet yet but there biryani is tasty.  I recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"I had butter chicken here two months ago. Huge plat! Finished everything, but super stuffed! It was great with friendly services. That's all I remembered!"}
{"text":"I love the food here, and it hits the spot every time. I usually order the chicken tikka masala with basmati rice, and a garlic naan on the side. The portions are reasonably large and the quality of the food is very good. The butter chicken also looks amazing.

I understand they have a lunch buffet here during the day, but I've never tried it so can't comment on its quality. The service can be quite slow and the food takes a long time to arrive, so if you're very hungry either get a starter to keep you going or order takeout.

Tip: There is a 15% off dinner coupon on their website."}
{"text":"The food is authentic and very good. Great ambience and service too. Quantities are a bit less but I'm not complaining. We ordered the momos,shekwa(a sizzling meat platter), mutton jalfrezi, mutton vindaloo and a biryani. I probably wouldn't recommend the biryani as I've had better but everything else was top notch. Buddha,our server was very welcoming and friendly. Definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"The husband and I are huge fans of Kathmandu - and we love that the waitstaff remember us though we aren't in on a regular basis. Their vegetarian items are universally fantastic, thought the Bengan Bharta and Paneer Butter Masala are really standout great. Their bhajis are kind of meh, but the samosa chat and/or chat papry really make up for it.  We've had the lunch buffet, and while we enjoy it more than most Indian lunch buffets in the city, the a la carte items are really where Kathmandu shines. They have recently partnered with JustEat.ca for delivery, which is a huge bonus."}
{"text":"went for lunch buffet and should have know that as empty as it was this was not going to be a good thing.  There was my mother and myself and then another group of about 8 very loud people.  choice at buffet was minimal, all dishes were Indian and not Nepalese.  Had to keep asking for naan.  food lacked spice, service sucked and when you got it they had attitude.  My advise, if you are near it, walk on by."}
{"text":"Eh? Yelp?

Unless the dinner here is amazing (and based on the lunch/left-overs, I don't entirely feel it would be), I don't know why it's a 4-star rating. I came here for lunch buffet, and it was a solid 3-star that might get 2 stars from customers picky on service.

Was the food bad? No. It was Indian food done decently. But if you've ever been to Trimurti or Little Indian on Queen West, you will know what a $12 lunch buffet can buy you in terms of quality and service. And this did not rank especially high for either.

I might come back if I'm starving in the area and want cheap, decent Indian food. But only because Queen West is a challenging walk on an empty stomach."}
{"text":"The food was mediocre. It wasn't spectacular, but it wasn't bad. I thought the shrimp dish was overpriced, since it's quite expensive but only comes with about 4 pieces of shrimp, and it was a bit dry. Service was very very slow.

When we got the bill, I noticed that they were charging us for some items that we didn't order. I showed this to the server and they took out the mistake. I don't like having to double-check the bill when I go to a restaurant, especially when it's ta long bill of about $180.

Here's something else that bothered me: We got a Groupon for this place. We called ahead of time to ask if we'd be taxed on the pre-groupon amount, or on the actual amount that we paid. They told me it'd be on the actual amount paid, and not the \"value\" of it. After we eat, the bill comes up, we find out that the info was incorrect and they taxed us on the \"value\" of the Groupon, and not the actual amount. That would have been OK if they told us the truth from the beginning. Knowing this, we would not have bought the Groupon, but we would have rather ordered from the menu. So yeah, even with the groupon, it ended up being over $240 after tax and tip."}
{"text":"I backpacked across India early this year, or more accurately ate my way across India - so naturally after consuming copious amounts of curry, I've deemed myself an expert in Indian cuisine. 

Although the name of the restaurant - Kathmandu suggests Nepally flair, they serve a fusion of North Indian, South Indian, Tibetan and of course Nepally inspired dishes. 

I came here with a girlfriend on a Tuesday night and we ate: 

- Papdam Lentil Chips: Our meal started off with a complimentary serving of Papadam lentil chips. At first bite, I was reminded of India. I am gluten intolerant and often ordered papadam chips to dip into my curries. It's a flat crisp made of chickpea flour and seasoned with black peppers. A great appetizer to share. 

-Lamb Sali Boti (4/5) (~$14) Tender lamb cubes stewed with freshly ground spice, dry apricots, and garnished with fine straw potatoes. The sauce was thick, rich in flavor and mild in spice. I would have liked to taste the flavor of the lamb more; I knew I was eating meat, but couldn't distinguish what kind of meat I was eating.  

Eggplant Bharta (3.5/5) (~$12) - Eggplant grilled over charcoal, mashed and cooked with fresh tomatoes, onion and spices. The curry was sweet, aromatic and also mild in spice. The composition of the curry was outweighed by tomatoes rather than eggplant. Still superb in flavor, but would have preferred the dish to have more eggplant texture and flavor.

Basmati Rice (~$3) - the two of us shared a dish of rice. The rice portion is quite large and was enough to fill two of us. 

Chai Tea (4/5) - We ended the meal with a pot of Chai Tea to share. It was masala spiced with a hint of ginger.  I gave the chai tea a 4/5 and have to admit this score may be unfair as it was delightful but nothing has compared to the shots of Chai from the streets of Mother India. If anyone has any recommendations for a place serving chai tea in Toronto, don't hold back on sending me a message!

Summary:
Food (4/5) - See ratings above. The curries here were thick, finely spiced and rich in flavor - overall very enjoyable.  

Service (9/10) - Incredibly friendly and conversational ready staff. If you like to talk to your service staff, then you'll really enjoy the service here. They are pretty eager to maintain a conversation with you throughout dinner and may perhaps even interrupt your conversation to engage in conversation. Possibly annoying if you are in a deep conversation with your company.

Atmosphere (10/10) - Lots of seating available, great for family and kids and relatively quiet. 

ProTip:  The restaurant may be difficult to find. It is located on the north side of Cumberland, just west of Yonge. It's beside the Pizza Pizza, down a set of stairs with a red sign."}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch buffet today.  It's located on the lower floor and can be tough to find.  Though there wasn't too much selection (3 meats, 3 vegetable dishes, rice) the service was quiet good and the food tasted good as well!  The lunch buffet is $12.99

There was samosa, pakora, a variety of salads, tandoori chicken, butter chicken, lamb, and 2 types of dessert.

I'd recommend for a quiet, simple, and tasty lunch."}
{"text":"If you like sharing your food with cockroaches, go ahead. The food tastes good but there were cockroaches running on top of the buffet.  I mentioned it to the people working there, not sure what they did about it....just saying."}
{"text":"Went along with my friend in a snowy evening to have momo.  It took a long time for them to serve the food. The food was okay."}
{"text":"We've loved Kathmandu for the longest time. Unfortunately the last time we were there, it wasn't so great. Soon as I walked in the door, I looked back at the buffet to see a huge cockroach crawling down the wall above the food. I alerted my partner, and he went over to the food area. Sure enough it was in the food by that point. I know cockroaches in old buildings is common, but if you have food out in the open a restaurant must be extra diligent with pest control. It was such a turn off, I doubt we'll go back."}
{"text":"OMG this place is yummy and right on Yonge street and, unlike many Indian restos, it has my two favourite (not just one of 'em but both!) dishes: baingan bharta and malai kofta. 
yyuuummmmmmyyyy

It's  not uber cheap but also not that pricey, especially given the location. 
It used to be my ex's and my go-to restaurant when we were too lazy to go all the way to Gerrard street but really needed some good desi food and a nice \"date\" spot (which can be tough to find in the annex and downtown core). 

The waiters are nice, not overly talkative or friendly, but for the atmosphere it's pretty fitting. 

Yummers, worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday for lunch with a large group from work. I recently transitioned from vegetarian to vegan and was nervous I wouldn't find anything to eat on the buffet (especially after reading the Yelp review saying nothing was vegan) so I called the restaurant that morning. A very friendly man, maybe the owner, assured me that several vegan dishes would be available and he asked me what I liked, suggesting he could prepare chana masala and okra dishes in addition to the things he was already planning to serve (among them a vegetable coconut curry, spinach salad, sauteed mushrooms and bell pepper, beets, basmati rice). When I arrived the owner showed me which items were vegan on the buffet and he also brought me naan without butter (he serves naan at the table). The bottom line is that the vegan options were plentiful, hearty, nicely seasoned and very tasty. The chana masala, okra, and vegetable curry were standouts. I'm planning to go back."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the worst indian food I have eaten in the whole of downtown Toronto. I went for lunch buffet on a friday for $12.99. The service was very slow, only one waiter! I found their butter chicken to be descent but the rest of the curries were absolute shit. Even I can cook better indian food at home (and I am pretty average). 

Also, don't even think of using the washrooms, they are pretty disgusting. I don't know how resturants like this are even profitable being on Yonge street.

PS: I am Indian"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed the lunch buffet. Lots of delicious options!"}
{"text":"Visited this place for dinner with friends. I don't usually go for Indian food (as I get all that at home) so when I saw that they had butter chicken, I went for it. Butter chicken is not something that is part of traditional Indian cuisine, so for me, it's something special. This place is also special because it's not just Indian cuisine, but also Nepalese cuisine. While we didn't try anything that's traditionally Nepalese that evening, I really enjoyed the atmosphere and service, as well as the food. I will be back to try more things. Something that's interesting is that they served food on thalis (those metal tray-like dishes each item is separated in it's own place). I do not enjoy eating off thalis so much, but it's a different experience if you've never tried it before. The prices are fair, and the portions are large. Worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Wonderful flavours.  Most of the dishes aren't obviously Nepalese vs. Indian, but they definitely have a different flavour than a regular Indian restaurant.  The stuffed naan is especially good.  Not the cheapest, but well worth it."}
{"text":"First let me start by saying this is my first time at a Indian food buffet. I was apprehensive because Indian food is quite heavy, and I always have leftovers. But, the quality of the food here was great! And so many options for vegetarians and meat eaters a like! The quality of the food was so good! And having the buffet is exciting because you get a bit of everything. I'm a vegetarian and was so happy to see all the veg options, the servers are super friendly and everything was so great! The down side - my stomach is too small."}
{"text":"I don't go out for lunch too often anymore, but when I saw a $12.99 Indian buffet in Yorkville, I had to go in (I was actually going to just get a salad from Salad Days).  

While the selection isn't large, they still had a very good salad bar, 10-12 hot items, soup and some dessert.  There is definitely a focus on quality here as opposed to quantity.  

-Fresh naan bread
-Bean masala was excellent
-I can't comment on meat since I don't eat it on weekdays, but they had butter chicken, goat curry, and tandoori chicken but they all smelled very nice.  
-Even the salad was well dressed.

In addition, they have a loyalty card.  Have 5 meals and your 6th meal is free. 

Verdict: Good quality buffet and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Another place I used to go to when it was on Yonge street and I went when they first opened.  This time I'm going to Yorkville using a groupon. It's a deal so how could I resist?
My friend and I had the chicken momos, vegetable pakoras, okra, butter chicken &  lamb korma.
Plus we got dessert!  I really enjoyed everything. I think my least favourite was the korma but I know I've had a lamb dish I was crazy about before but can't remember which!  I usually order vegetarian when I'm there so remembering a lamb dish eluded me.
I find their food has been consistently good over the years. And I've done take out, dinner dining in and lunch buffet.
I never thought their prices were cheap but I have always found the quality there and I'd much rather quality over quantity and have been disappointed with other places that just lowered the quality. So I would say this is still one of the few Indian restaurant's worth patronizing as it's still good today."}
{"text":"We ordered take out from here, so the review is of that :)

Service was great, they had our food ready in 15 minutes. Cool.

We ordered:

1. Daal Makhani (off menu, or atleast off the online menu) - it was okay. Not the best, lacking a bit of spice. But it's daal. No one absolutely \"loves\" or \"Craves\" daal except white people.

2. Lamb Vindaloo - OMFG. SO GOOD. THE GRAVY WOULDN'T STOP. JUST OMG. Thick, meaty, delicious. Surprisingly there weren't any bones, which I was kinda expecting. Tomato-ey, spicy, but not super spicy as Vindaloo should be. For Nepalese people making Goan curry, fuck yes.

3. The BBQ Half Chicken- Standard fare as all other tandoori chicken places. Delicious.

4. The BUtter Naan - was alot like a paratha. 


I really wanna check out the lunch buffett now, especially since I'm always next door to this place. Like, my crashpad is right there. 

Only downside, is the price is a bit expensive IMO. our total for the above came to 60 bucks. 2.99 each for butter naan? GURL PLZ.

3.5 rounded to a 4"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant a few times. Their lunch buffet is great and cheap. I got momos for takeout today. Sauce was very delicious but I have had better momos. Got free papad with my momos, and it was wonderful."}
{"text":"Great food. The spice is appropriate and consistent. I love the papadums....please excuse the spelling. The chicken biryani is wonderful. And I love their curries as well. Great place for both eat in and take out"}
{"text":"The rating is more of a 3.5 stars. Came here today (Thursday) around 1pm, the restaurant was quiet with 2 or 3 tables of people eating. We had to go inside to the register to find someone who actually works there. We were given the option to seat wherever we wanted to. 

Personally I feel that there is not enough lighting in the dining area, but it felt pretty comfortable as it was quiet and you get your own food whenever you wanted. The service was also good as the server came from time to time to refill our water and to take our plates, but he did not stand there or walking around while waiting for someone to be done.

Foodwise, I only had the meat curries & spinach with rice and naan. The curries were all good & delicious, but they only have 3 different types of meat curry: goat, (butter) chicken & fish. They also have lentil soup, mixed vegetables, chickpeas, a small salad bar, ... I also tasted something that I thought was meat & didn't like it (not because it's not meat), but was something else and I couldn't figure out what it was made of. As for dessert, they only have gulab jamun and something like rice pudding in milk. 
The lunch buffet price is $14.99 per person + tax + tips. I've been to other indian buffets, and they offer many more varieties of food for the same price. Might come back one day if I'm around the area and looking for indian food. 

Food: 3.5/5
Price/value for money: 2.5/5, can get more delicious dishes at other buffets for same price. 
Service: 4.25/5"}
{"text":"I have been to several Indian restaurants in several cities/towns and this is about as authentic as you get! My friend, who is from Northern India (where most of the food at this particular restaurant is based on) also loves the food and felt right at home. We went for dinner around 6:30 and the place was quiet. We were served quickly and efficiently, and my friend helped guide me on some of the dishes since she was familiar with them. We grabbed the assorted platter of samosas, pakora and one other item. Then grabbed individual dishes, her the okra, and myself one of the eggplant dishes. We ordered naan to eat them with and easily finished it off, with leftovers of the main dish for take home (Woooo!). We tried each others meals and were definitely satisfied. I would definitely love to visit again for a well cooked and flavourful meal, but explore a bit more with other dishes next time."}
{"text":"came here for lunch with a few coworkers the Friday before Christmas. 
Kathmandu has a wide variety of a-la-carte dishes they offer.  For those who aren't so sure, they do have a lunch buffet that's reasonable and quite popular among its patrons ($12).  Our group however decided to go with the a-la-carte. 
Here's the breakdown:
Lamb korma- This was a delightful dish, the gravy saved this dish as it went well with the tender pieces of lamb.
momo's (dumplings) - I've had better, outer skin was too thick, was probably frozen.
Chili chicken- Pretty good, but again, not really Hakka style as I've been to one too many of them to know if it's Hakka style.
basmati rice- Great, no issues.
naan- same, no issues.

Overall the place was okay, however next time I may try their buffet as it seemed to be the popular choice."}
{"text":"Deeeeelightfully delicious. Had the mixed grill (a must try!!), lamb saag and fish malabari curry. Portions are amazing so I've been lucky enough to snack on these leftovers for days. Will certainly order from them again and again and again."}
{"text":"Nice, small Indian/Nepalese restaurant. I was here for lunch. There are pluses and minuses for this place, but all in all it is a place I would visit again for dinner.
Positives for the lunch buffet: 
- Price: The buffet is affordable, and I got free masala chai (this is a big plus);
- Variety: The buffet has both vegetarian, meat, cold and hot dishes;
- Service: Service is nice and attentive, it is possible to order many extras.
Negatives:
- Space: the space is quite small and smells like Indian spices. This is quite yummy while you are in the restaurant; but it stays in your clothes, for your workmates to know that you had Indian for lunch...
- Food: It can be better; also, they could have served fresh naan at the table.
More positive than negative, this place gets a strong 4 stars."}
{"text":"This was GOOD, certainly not a 'better' Indian buffet.  There was a smaller variety of food; at $12 the price is reasonable.  I found the family teenager who entered and wandered around and talked REALLY loudly ANNOYING.  Keep your kids home, I've noticed this with 'certain' restaurants; they treat the restaurant like their living room."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends for dinner on a weekday, and we did not know this restaurant had lunch buffet during the weekdays. If we had known, we would probably void since we may be getting buffet quality food for a-la-carte pricing. We also wanted to try a new cuisine, thinking this restaurant served Nepalese food as advertised. The menu was 95% Indian cuisine with only a several items that was Nepalese. This is very misleading to customers.

Service: The restaurant was really quiet with only a few tables occupied during peak dinner time. Service was horrible. The server was not friendly at all. The plates and utensils we all got had stains on them. Several plates had stains and we requested new ones. The server gently grabbed a cloth and wiped it in front of us... He is that lazy to go grab new plates for us...

Food: Food was mediocre. For the prices, I expected better. It tasted like take-out quality from a food court. 

Overall, I will NOT come back based on many reasons. It is overpriced Indian food. Food was mediocre. Most importantly, this place is extremely dirty since many of us had stains on our glasses, plates, and forks. Lastly, the server did not seem to care that we asked for new plates when he clearly saw stains on them. 


AVOID!"}
{"text":"we have only had take-out but the food is sooooo gOOd ... ummm butter chicken

the restaurant itself is sort of looks shabby could use a make-over but the food is wonderful and the staff are very nice and polite"}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious. A great choice for a quick lunch and Yonge and Bloor. 

There are guys at my work who are here a couple of times a week for lunch so they must be doing something right. 

Fresh Naan is awesome and the lamb curry is a must have (just wish it didn't have so many bones, lol). 

Also do all the classics well (tandoori, butter chicken, pakora, saag paneer etc.)"}
{"text":"I hit Katmandou every time I visit Toronto, twice this trip, only to find out they are being torn down for yet another high rise condo. I guess they're moving about 6 blocks up the street thankfully. Always order the dall soup with chicken and the chicken tikka masala or vindaloo. Never disappoints. Service is friendly and the prices pretty good. It's never very crowded but there is a steady stream of people picking up take out which tells me the locals love it too. Atmosphere is very classy and relaxing making it the whole package."}
{"text":"Possibly the best Indian Buffet in Yorkville hands down, if not all of Downtown Toronto and the whole of GTA!!!

We went in with a Groupon (Lunch Buffet for Two + Lassi Drinks for Two). The service was very friendly, food was fresh, warm and/or cold (as necessary), and best part was that they brought fresh from the oven Naans straight to your table, unlike most Indian Buffets where the Naans go Cold & Hard.

They even kept the Tandoori (BBQ) Chicken covered, so the chicken was warm & soft. The lentil soup was very good. But the best part of the experience was the Kheer (Sweet Rice Pudding) wasn't sugared like every single Indian restaurant I've visited. It tasted like home, and for once you could taste the rice, milk/cream, and the spices, not just the sugar.

Food: 5/5
Service: 5/5
Location: 3/5 (Located next to a Cigar Shop, so there's a constant linger of cigars in the area)"}
{"text":"Tried their buffet once. The meat dishes were from the cheapest cuts and overcooked.
Bleh!"}
{"text":"I have come here for years off and on from when it used to be a small take out place. The flavours and prices have increased as costs and inflation have. I would say it is comparable to many other Indian style restaurants I have been to except they garnish with fresh coriander and ginger. For some this is a turn off but I find it only adds to the explosion of tastes and flavours. I recommend samosa chat as an appetizer. I have never found it anywhere before but the naan breads are made fresh and hard to resist. It's a bit difficult not to leave over stuffed. Service is slower but worth the wait if you aren't rushing."}
{"text":"I'm always looking to try something different so I was intrigued when I saw that Kathmandu offered Himalayan/Nepalese cuisine. From what I've read, and what my server told me, it's a blend of Indian and Tibetan influences. I haven't had that before and the buffet meant I got to try several different things.

They offer a small buffet, not too many choices. There were some popular Indian dishes, including butter chicken, goat curry, chick peas, basmati rice, and naan. I'm not sure I'm seeing the Tibetan influences. The butter chicken was a little sweeter than I'm used to. Is that the Nepalese style? The food tasted good but I felt like I missed something."}
{"text":"Very Cozy and cute restaurant with mice exotic dishes. They are open late and always have smiles on.  Favorite local place"}
{"text":"Same friend and I came back to enjoy this place (she had been craving the Butter Chicken) and it did what we all want restaurants to do. They got better.  Service was faster and more attentive, the food was delightful and full of flavour.  The soup that comes with the feast is meh.  Rest is a treat.  Have a feeling this may be her go to spot when visiting. And I'm good with that."}
{"text":"With its name adopted from the largest metropolitan area of Nepal, Kathmandu is an Indian restaurant located in the heart of Toronto's downtown Young Street area. The interior d√©cor, though nothing particularly eye catching is good. The tables are nicely set with base white and overlapping red table cloths, the glasses hand dried spotless and restaurant with an overall clean appearance. 

The menu is extensive in Indian cuisine with various starters, salads, fish, chicken, vegetables, curried items and tandoor specialties done in a clay tandoor oven. 

I went for their traditional recipe of Goat/Lamb Curry cooked in a base of ginger, garlic, tomato and hot spices. When presented it eye appealing and had a good spicy curry taste about it. The goat was nicely done, had a good texture about it but it was more than obvious that the dish consisted primarily of goat with hardly any lamb, but at the low price of $11.99, pretty much what one might expect. The goat was also not all that nicely trimmed and in fact some hunks of the flesh in fact consisted of pure goat fat or grizzle. 

Though I'm not any expert on this, one thing that struck me was that the food offered at Kathmandu didn't exactly have, at least to my mind, the taste or flavors of what I would consider being true or authentic to regional Nepal, but in fact more like that of what I might term as being generic of India. I wouldn't even mention this, but while there I had the opportunity to speak with a native of Nepal who, without any hesitations, confirmed my suspicion on that point."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday dinner with a party of 14. Took up almost half the restaurant. Despite our huge number of people, the wait staff (3 of them) were very attentive and helpful. Wait for food was quite normal.

My friend and I split the 'feast' for one, as we were told it was quite a lot of food for one person. It included Naan, rice (which we declined for more Naan), Tandoori Chicken, Kebab, Chicken Tikka, Tandoori Prawn, and a choice of Curry. Plus dessert!

The Kebab was okay, the 2 chickens were quite dry though. The goat curry we ordered was good though. Very rich! Price wise, all the entrees are approx 12-14. Our feast was 21 bucks though."}
{"text":"The Saag Aloo & Chicken Tikka Malasa were excellent. Staff was a bit slow. Food arrival was quite slow even though the place was only half full. I suspect they were doing many delivery or take out orders. Decor could certainly be improved.
Price was quite fair.
Overall 3.5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great Indian restaurant located close to Yonge and Bloor. I have been here many times and the food is always really good and fresh. The restaurant is not that big but they have plenty of dishes for their lunch buffet. They usually have few meat dishes and about four veggie curries plus salad bar. In the winter time they also have masala chai included in the lunch buffet. I especially like their Saag Paneer and Chana Masala, but also their veggie and zucchini dishes are so good! The employees are very friendly, too. They recently raised their prices a bit but I think it's still worth the price! Will be coming soon again."}
{"text":"Came here with 2 of my friends on a Friday night. The waitress put two tables together to make a table for four and served us water right away. I don't know much about Indian cuisine so we asked the waitress about butter chicken and she recommended the butter chicken dinner special for $12.99.. all three of us got that. 

The wait time was very long.. Probably around 50 minutes. That was probably the main reason for the 3 stars.. Does Indian food always take this long to cook? 

The dinner special portion was very good. It came on a big plate with 2 small side dishes (one salad, one vegetable curry I think), butter chicken, rice and naan. Both side dishes were delicious and the butter chicken was good but I don't have anything to compare it to since it was my first time eating butter chicken lol. The naan was my favourite though very good texture and taste. 

Overall the service was acceptable. They constantly refilled our waters which was nice. I would come here again if I crave Indian cuisine."}
{"text":"I was really pleased with this place.

First off the bat, they use Ritual for their lunch buffet. But points!

What got me wasn't the food (which was great!). It was the service. I've been to other places in the area where they monitor what you get in the buffet and limit a lot of the things for you which is REALLY greedy. This place isn't like that. i picked what I wanted, all for under $12 for a large container. 

Suffice to say I was the envy of a lot of coworkers in the office when I brought it into the kitchen.

Extra points for the amount Na'an I got. They didn't skimp on it at all and it was all delicious. 

Yes I recommend this place, if you like Indian food, then this is a place you should check out."}
{"text":"I went there last night for dinner (a la carte, not buffet). Food was absolutely great. Meat was tender, sauces were flavourful. Naan was fluffy, lots of rice for $2.99.

However, what really annoyed me was how long it took. I don't know if it's because of all the delivery orders they had to fill or because they're slow in general, but we sat there from 6:44pm to about 7:50pm waiting for our food to come. Ridiculous.

The noise level at this place is also above average. It sounds like a packed Chinese restaurant, when it clearly isn't one... maybe it's just the wall material or something. Tables are also fairly close together so that might be part of it.

Won't go there to get a sit-down dinner again. I might try delivery some time."}
{"text":"Delicious! The dry spiced okra is delicious and though I didn't try their kebab, I saw one come sizzling past me and I'm definitely trying it next time."}
{"text":"Not bad.  We had the Indian lunch buffet on a weekday.  Relatively small variety on the buffet.  I found the food not quite as flavorful as other Indian food.  
The surroundings/decor were very pleasant."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic!!!

I dont know how I ate $60 dollars worth for two people but it was sooooo good.  The butter chicken and the mango lassi were UNBELIEVABLE!  

I just started to drool a bit...."}
{"text":"This place is terrible.  

Case 1:
waitress: Do you want anything to drink?
us: We will all have water, and can you bring the pitcher and leave it?
waitress: no.
me: what do you mean no? I can see ten pitchers and you won't come by enough to refill it... nothing against you, but I can see that this place is full and there are only two servers.  Can you please just leave the pitcher?
waitress: [awkward smile] no, I'm not allowed to leave it.
me: ummmm... ok.  
her: [awkward smile] [also note she was like 19 so this probably isn't her fault]

Case 2:
me: I notice the naan is $5-$6... how many pieces are in one order?
waitress: four.
me: sweet, that seems right, we'll only have one order then.

Case 3:
[seventy five minutes pass. 75. SEVENTY FIVE MINUTES]
[food arrives]
[four naan actually = 1 naan cut into 4 pieces. But it's not like I was going to order more at $5 per naan and wait the equivalent of watching a feature length film for it. This place sucks so bad.]

Case 4:
The bill.  It's $50 for 3 very, very small dishes and 2 pieces of naan. The chicken dishes had 5-6 pieces of chicken in them and the veg dish had 6 pieces of cheese.  The value proposition here is terrible.  The dishes were $12-$14 and they should have been more like $8. I still cannot get over the naan situation.

Overall:
- the food here was fine but it's not outstanding.
- the service was appalling. Not only was it slow, it was somewhere between apathetic and resentful. Not once did we hear a \"sorry for the wait.\"  2c tip worthy. Don't spend it all in one place.
- negative value rating. I would have been happier eating a $5 bill and keeping my other $13.

I will NEVER eat here again and I am shocked by all the 4 & 5 star reviews. I don't know what else to say other than this establishment is terrible."}
{"text":"Love, love, love their creamy butter chicken! Staff are nice too! We've only tried coming at dinner time. They do have lunch buffet which we still have to try:) My sister and I always just order butter chicken and naan bread every time. The staff recognize our faces now and they are very sweet with accommodating us. There's always a friendly chat. They even gave us Gulab Jamun to try for free and we loved it! ;) The staff would also recommend other entrees for us to try, but we have trust issues and we dont want to miss out on the butter chicken! This is my favorite place to eat butter chicken vs butter chicken factory. Price is even better because two orders of butter chicken and naan with a pop, plus tax and tip is less than forty dollars. Great price and great time guaranteed here!"}

Everything was very flavourful and bursting with spices.  I ate a lot more than I should have but it was well worth it.  A little bit on the pricey side, but not outrageous, and the service is a little slow, but also not outrageous.  I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Thank you Toronto Yelpers!
 
Kathmandu Kathmandu was the first place I dined at during my current project stay in Toronto.  It is really close to the TTC College subway station.
 
I went for lunch on Monday, and decided to skip their $17 CDN buffet because the offerings didn't look so great.  Instead, I opted for their Butter Chicken ($12.99 CDN) dish, which proved to be excellent!  It was very tasty and had a nice spicy kick to it.  It was the best Butter Chicken I have had in the States and Canada.

Naan and basmati rice do not come with the dishes, so I had to tack on a rice order ($2.99 CDN).  Although the dishes seem nice and cheap, after rice/naan and tax & tips, it still comes out to a shade above $20 CDN.  It's still one of the more affordables places and delicious too, so I am a fan of this Nepalese restaurant!

My friend at U of T says many of his classmates agree that Kathmandu is their favourite Indian restaurant in T.O."}
{"text":"We ordered from this restaurant and I agree with the others... the prices are through the roof! They came for delivery an hour and a half after we ordered even though we were told it would be an hour (still quite a long time when we live 7 minutes away from the place). By that time, we were just fed up with the wait. The food is reallllly greasy which is sad because there are tons of other really good indian restaurants with half the grease and much more taste. 
On a side note: we were also overcharged by $2 on one of the dishes (did a quick online check to see what the prices were for the dishes)...
Won't be ordering from them again :("}
{"text":"Butter Paneer was too sweet. The Vindaloo was really good though. If you want real Roti do not get it here as it really just whole wheat Naan."}
{"text":"Overall an amazing experience. Authentic North Indian cuisine and service goes above and beyond to accommodate you. The only sad thing I found out about this  place is we left a generous tip because the female server seemed very friendly and dedicated to us only to find out that the owner does not allow them to keep the tips as 'he pays them out of the tips'that is their base salary that is shared."}
{"text":"Awesome food (soup, lamb korma, and garlic naan) and a quiet atmosphere. I will be going back!"}
{"text":"It took me 90 minutes to travel one way on driving/TTC to have lunch buffet ($11.99) at Kathmandu! And it better worth it! And yes I have a good filling spicy lunch that put a smile in my face! 

The buffet selections may not be huge.. don't expect to be at a Chinese buffet or a Japanese AYCE when there are 50 items for you to pick from. Here we are talking about quality not quantities. 

All the food were all tasty, spicy and fresh... Yes spicy enough that I don't need any hot sauce and so delicious that I start having bits of food on my face and everywhere... Sorry for my friend that was eating with me, I hope I did not splash some of the sauce in his face! 

Lunch Buffet only serves from Monday to Saturday, so for me it will be another painful TTC trip if I want to come down again! But I am IN if my friend says let's do it!"}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed my last meal at Kathmandu. Three of us shared orders of saag paneer, butter chicken and a lamb sali boti. (Aside: Sali boti is a Persian dish. Not really a stone's throw from Nepal, is it?) 

All three were delicious and we left the table stuffed. But I feel I must make the point, and vehemently so, that the service here is SLOOOOOOOOW. Not a little bit slow, but we're-waiting-for-the-paneer-to-curdle slow.

But the food is still decent."}
{"text":"Great food, very filling and cheap lunch buffet. My Indian roommate is begging me to take her back there, hmm.  The location is a lil questionable (below a staircase), but i'll be back anyway."}
{"text":"After hanging out at home for awhile in the afternoon we decided to head out for an early dinner at Kathmandu, one of our favourite Indian places. We used to visit it fairly regularly years ago when it was located on Yonge Street just north of Alexander Street. They moved four years ago to Cumberland Street in Yorkville and while we have ordered takeout from them using Just Eats we had never actually made it to their new location. 

Located on the north side of Cumberland, just west of Yonge Street, they occupy the basement of an old house that was long ago converted into shops. There is a double entrance that sits in the centre of the restaurant that leads to a couple of more steps down to a dining area that is split into two separate sections. We opted for a raised seating area that looked south onto Cumberland Street and while the place was empty when we arrived there was lots of takeout traffic leaving the restaurant. The ambience is dark and muted with a beautifully painted eggplant-purple ceiling that was very relaxing. The service was quick and polite and the food as delicious as I remember from when we ate at their Yonge Street location."}
{"text":"Our first visit in this small hidden Indian/Nepalese restaurant. Located on the lower level of a building near Yonge street entrance covered by a big concrete stairs.  It was a Father's Day gift certificate from our daughter last year. Hubby forgot about it and here we are four of us to use it this year. The server said it was expired but later said it's okay to use it. We started with 4 lassie drinks. We joked about the tiny hole straw was perfect so you can slowly sip this thick drink while waiting for the food. We ordered mixed grill platter (grilled salmon, tandoori, sausage etc), goat vindaloo, chicken korma, fish malabari curry, plain basmati and butter naans. For dessert, we ordered gulab jamun. We enjoyed the food. We love the butter naans that we asked for another order. Chicken korma, vindaloo and fish curry on its thick tasty sauces are just enjoyable. Small servings but just perfect for us. We gave a compliment to the chef for the authentic taste of their dishes. It's not a pretty place but the food is good. It deserves a five star rating. We highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Time for a reality check. The overall 4.5 star rating led me astray and I wouldn't want this streak to continue for other yelpers, so let's get on with the facts about my experience at Kathmandu Kathmandu.

PRICES: egregious. How can one justify charging $17 for buffet and $13 for a vegetarian dish? $5 for plain naan?? Indian food should not be this expensive. In fact, other than The Host, this is the most expensive Indian restaurant I've ever visited in Toronto (of dozens) and the service certainly didn't match the price I paid.

PORTIONS:  I ordered the paneer butter masala (recall: $13) and counted 7 cubes of paneer. The value was more like $6. My $5 naan was 1 medium-sized piece cut into 4 squares. Rice was out of my price range so I didn't order it.

SERVICE: deplorable. 30 minutes before we were given water (after we had asked multiple times) and 75 minutes before our food came out. This restaurant is understaffed by aloof and unapologetic amateurs. As a final note, I must mention that I didn't see any South Asians among the staff.

Avoid."}
{"text":"For my desi fellas, food is white washed and sweet, specially the buffet. Never coming back here."}
{"text":"I've been going to Kathmandu regularly for about 6 years now. It's hard to find authentic South Asian food in Toronto. I always get chicken vindaloo and momos with their fresh made, delicious naan. The food is spicy. It takes a while to get the food, but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Only go to this place if you have no idea of what Indian or Nepali food is like
Service is very poor, despite being nearly empty
Dry chicken, tasteless rice

On the positive side. The Gulab Jamon were warm. Thanks for microwaves

They forgot our order repeatedly, and had to be reminded of missed items

Save yourself the agony"}
