{"text":"Wow. Amazing service terrific menu! Upon arriving late for our reservation we informed out server that we had less than an hour to eat and catch our movie at the TIFF light box.  Not only were we able to order our food and catch our movie with plenty of time to spare, the food was terrific, the drinks were perfect and we both had a great time."}
{"text":"I ate here on a Saturday night and the food was fantastic.  I had the special which was halibut and it was prepared perfectly- best I have ever had.  My friend had the octopus and she loved it.  My niece had steak and also loved her meal.  As an appetizer we had calamari which was also very good.  We tried a couple of desserts which were equally tasty.  Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I visited Luma before heading out to see Wicked the other night, and I'm glad we did! 
Our reservation was for 5pm and we had initially requested a seat on the balcony, but due to noisy construction outside, we opted for the dining room. Our waitress (whose name I simply cannot remember, much to my regret) sat us at a lovely table near the windows, giving us a fantastic view of King St and the CN Tower. She was very attentive and made us feel right at home. Not once did we feel pressured or rushed, which was a load off of my shoulders. 

For drinks,  my girlfriend had a glass of Hinterland  sparkling wine, which was very bright and crisp - Perfect for the warm evening we were having. While I decided to try one of Luma's signature cocktails - the Pear's Prince. It was an amazing blend of Buffalo Trace bourbon, ginger, black pepper, pear, and soda, with just a slight bit of nutmeg to top it off. 
The only way to describe it was that it tasted like Christmas. It is definitely something I will be attempting to recreate at home! 

We decided to skip appetizers (as the cute little basket of warm sourdough bread and Hummus, that arrived with our drinks, had held us over quite well) and move right on to our main. 
I decided on the Braised Rabbit Cavatelli, while she opted for the special that night, which was a Seared Pickerel dish. 
I tell you, I cannot gush enough over the immaculate plating and presentation these meals had. They were gorgeous! My girlfriend said she almost didn't want to eat hers because it was so pretty.. But that lasted about thirty seconds, because once tried - it was difficult to put your fork down. 

Pickerel - By far the prettiest dish between the two of us. The fish was cooked perfectly and almost melted in your mouth. The flavours were completely on point, marrying well between the chickpea mash, greens, and the pumpkin puree. 

Braised Rabbit - Having never tried rabbit before, I was a little leery despite my slightly adventurous order - thank goodness I was delightfully surprised. The rabbit was shredded and cooked to a nicely tender state. The taste was mild and slightly spicy, but paired magnificently with the spinach, cucumber and pesto toss. The cavatelli itself was light and fluffy, and cooked to a perfect al dente. 

All in all, I cannot recommend this place enough. 
If you're looking for somewhere romantic and posh to treat your significant other, to celebrate a special occasion, or even to have a few nice cocktails after a long day at work - head over to the TIFF Light Box and check out Oliver & Bonacini's Luma. 

You wont regret it."}
{"text":"We were super hungry and got take out from here, came up to $60 for 2 people (no drinks) but it felt like literally 3 bites of food. lol 

so we were still hungry 

so it depends on what you are looking for 

but if you are hungry , dont go here ! lol

you get very little food for your mooola"}
{"text":"The food was excellent and it's not overpriced.  We ordered a dessert sampler and it had a variety of tasty treats. Our server was friendly and helpful,  and the ambiance is great. It's definitely worth trying out. I think it would good for a date night."}
{"text":"I'll chime in with the positive reviewers here. My wife and I just had our anniversary dinner at Luma and they treated us very well. Our server made just the right amount of fuss over us and our occasion and was just the right amount of attentive. The design and atmosphere of the space is really inspired. We loved the room. The food was terrific and every dish had a unique aspect. The peanut butter ice cream on top of the chocolate delice was particularly bud tickling. Luma is on of those restaurants that I would like to 'show off' to any visiting friends. It points to how Toronto can be world class when we do it right. We're looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"My partner and I went here for the 2012 Winterlicious menu. 
I had their root salad with a mustard dressing to start. I enjoyed it. The description mentioned it had bacon, but I didn't see any.
My partner had their chicken liver and fois  gras pâté which he said was good 
For the main I had their flat iron steak with mushrooms,potatoes and a truffle creme fraiche. This was good as well.
My partner had the seared tuna, which he didn't enjoy as it  tasted too much like sushi and he expected it to be cooked more.
The dessert for me was a chocolate bread pudding which would make me come back. But then again I love good bread pudding.  My partner ordered the panna cota  with an apple compote which was also good. He said it reminded him of a cheesecake and apple pie mashed into a blender.

Overall it was a nice night, but would not go back as the normal prices for their food is beyond my entertaining budget"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try out LUMA since I generally love the family of restaurants under Oliver and Bonacini. So when Winterlicious rolled around, I jumped on getting a dinner reservation. Located on the second floor of the TIFF light box, the location and venue is perfect for a date. 

After climbing a flight of stairs, we see a huge LUMA sign to reconfirm that we have gone to the right place. It was a little confusing trying to find the place! We were greeted by a hostess that takes our jackets for coat check, and then to our tables. The venue is cozy and inviting. Lots of tables, sofas, high ceilings, and windows spanning the entire wall. Some tables have an amazing view of the CN tower!

If you're here for just a couple drinks, you can opt to in the Blackberry lounge connected to LUMA. It's brighter and a bit more casual than the LUMA dining room.


\"Roasted Beetroot Soup\" -blue cheese, walnut and apple:

As a starter I ordered this Roasted Beetroot Soup. I almost never order soup (i'm more of a salad person) but decided to switch things up a bit. Wasn't the best soup I've had, but I don't regret ordering it. It's very simple in flavours, and the beets are pureed to a very viscous but smooth consistency. Could almost pass for a pasta sauce!


\"Chicken Liver + Foie Gras Pate\"-confit duck heart and braised lentils:

When this appetizer came, I don't think we knew where to start eating this. It didn't look like a million dollars, but it turned out to be a delicious messy pile. There's a lot going on here in this one dish, but once it goes into your mouth it all converges into a creamy thick paste of fois gras. To balance it off there are some crunchy nuts and croutons. It goes great with the bread, so good thing the waitress came by with another basket. For such a rich, heavy, and flavourful dish, I thought the portions are extremely excessive. Even with two people we had lots left over.

\"Scallop Sashimi\" ($13) - with celery leaves, herbs radish and ginger vinagrette

We ordered the Scallop Sashimi off the regular menu (not the Winterlicious one), and to be honest it was a bit disappointing. This was a very minimalist dish. No sauce pairings, no fancy garnishes, just scallops with a bit of lime, lettuce and ginger. While it does allow you to taste the scallop freshness, the dish lacked inspiration. An unnecessarily gigantic plate carrying only a morsel of scallop sashimi makes me wish they could have done something more with all that white plate space.


\"Seared Albacore Tuna\" -braised sunchoke and heirloom bean salad, red wine rosemary vinaigrette:

For my main I ordered the Seared Albacore Tuna and was pretty apathetic about it. I thought the tuna was dry and not nearly as raw in the middle as it should be. The bean salad was decent on its own, but with the tuna, I felt it was all the same texture: dry and starchy. The salad definitely could have used something along the lines of diced tomatoes or apples to contrast the heartiness of the fish and beans.

\"Grilled Flatiron Steak\" -butter whipped potato, oyster mushrooms and truffle creme fraiche

While my tuna was a bit underwhelming, Rob's order of the Grilled Flatiron Steak was much more impressive. In fact, he couldn't stop complimenting how well it was cooked, and on the quality of the meat. I think his exact words were \"I've never had a striploin this good before.\"  It was so very tender and lightly seasoned with simple salt. I guess when you have such a good piece of meat you don't need much to make it taste good! I really enjoyed the oyster mushrooms and mashed potatoes too, which soaked up all steak juice goodness.

\"Apple + Buttermilk Panna Cotta\" - maple granola and apple compote:

I love the taste of plain yoghurt so I really enjoyed this cold Buttermilk Panna Cotta served with warm apples. It was light and refreshing, and not overly sweet.

\"Chocolate Bread + Butter Pudding\" -butterscotch and shaved white chocolate:

I am a big big chocolate fan so scanning the Winterlicious dessert selection I knew right away I was getting this Chocolate Bread and Butter Pudding. It did not disappoint. The bread pudding had a flakey light top layer and a moist decadent center filled with semi-melted dark chocolate ribbons. The white chocolate shavings were nice and creamy and topped off this dessert perfectly. I'm not sure if you're supposed to eat the flowers, but I did anyways.

With the except of desserts, I am sad to say I did not like LUMA as much as I had hoped. There were definitely some excellently executed dishes, but still it lacked that extra dazzle and charm. Perhaps Winterlicious experiences never does a restaurant justice. I would be open to trying LUMA again for their regular menu, but probably only if I was already at TIFF for a movie or something."}
{"text":"Came here for my anniversary dinner. The service was wonderful, attentive and unpretentious. The appetizers were good but the mains were only ok. We had the arctic char which was underwhelming and the chickpea puree that accompanied it didn't complement the fish at all. Would still recommend the place though for a nice evening out."}
{"text":"My fiancée and I love the Oliver and bonancini franchises and so visiting luma was a natural choice. We tried it out for lunch this afternoon and I thought this restaurant has been underestimated. 

The atmosphere is lovely and the service is great. We were started off with water and wine, and then we ordered our appetizers. The service is slow, but that is how I like it when I am with good company. Although, for the amount of money we paid for lunch, maybe a touch more professionalism would have been nice. But hey, not a huge deal. 

The soup and fish were really yummy. Next came our entree. They weren't served or garnished with the same kind of flourish that other restaurants might have, but the food was honest and had strong flavors. 

Dessert was delish. The willy wonka is worth a try for chocolate and peanut butter lovers. 

Over all. I'm happy. Smidge expensive."}
{"text":"Great Summerlicious menu.  The vegetarian choices are great.  My favourite of the three was the gazpacho.  The lasagna was very good but also extremely rich - a good thing I know but keep this in mind because it is the only vegetarian main.  The berry desert I had was pretty good and the Summerlicious wine choices were quite enjoyable.  Can't say I'd go for the regular menu but Summerlicious for lunch is worth it."}
{"text":"I love the poached egg and chicken breast so much I just wished there were more of them!"}
{"text":"Brunch at Luma is a simple affair. 

It involves clean lines, sparkling cutlery and china, no fuss menus and a down to earth humane amount of food. There are no homefries or stringy potatoes falling off your plate, there is no sauce spilling over your white t-shirt and you are not drowning your insides in grease in the process.

I had the eggs benedict served on cloudy croissant-halves made in-house. The croque madame, with stinky overpowering gruyere, was rich and tasty. Both were great choices since the menu is not extravagant in any way. 

The cocktail list is extremely inviting and a must-try."}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing food. My family went here for a Xmas dinner and the service was fantastic. I ordered the yellow fin tuna and a small side. Ambience was really nice. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Salt Salt Salt.  Couldn't taste the food for all the salt. The organic halibut (all halibut is organic) was so small it would fit on a cracker.  For $34 i expected a real piece of fish. The staff are amazing and the wine was great , if only the food was,!  Don't waste your money so many great restaurants in that area. I am so glad I went, we were thinking of it for our christmas event there...not anymore !"}
{"text":"Attended Luma during the Winterlicious event in February. It's a great atmosphere for a date or having a girls night. They have a great wine list. From the Winterlicious menu I choose the Ginger Sangria, a little too much ginger for me but still good. For an appetizer I got the shrimp \"cocktail\" salad, great portion size. For entree I got the Squash Ravioli, which in my opinion is the best dish offered in the menu and it's vegetarian and local which is a plus for me. Finally for dessert I got the Date Square with vanilla ice cream on top. I would recommend this restaurant to those who enjoy dining in the entertainment district. Perfect location (inside Tiff Lightbox)."}
{"text":"The menu here is on the short side with only a handful of appetizers and entrees to choose from. They do have a great cocktail menu and a nice bar/lounge area... maybe for my next visit.

 What I tried:

Tongue + Cheek - braised veal tongue, duck pate and pork head cheese with wild Canadian flavours ($15). The dish arrived on wooden board and I was impressed by its whimsical presentation. Looked like something from a fairy tail! The duck pate was simply wonderful and was incredibly light... my favourite part of the dish. The thinly shaved veal tongue was tasty and the head cheese, while a touch oily for my liking, was still delicious!

Steak Tartare - spiced raw beef with chicken liver parfait, pickles and grilled o&b artisan bread ($15 appetizer/$28 main), which came topped with a quail egg. A big hit! Reminded me a lot of the steak tartare at Auberge du Pommier (one of my favourites!)

Ricotta Gnudi - sautéed mushrooms, parmesan and chives ($15 appetizer/$20 main). Light, fluffy, pillowy gnudi covered in a parmesan foam. Earthy, fragrant... a mushroom lover's dream!

Pappardelle - braised short rib, caramelized onions and horseradish cream ($19). The dish contained pieces of pulled, tender short rib and I loved the caramelized onions that gave the pasta a great flavour. Despite the generous amount of horseradish cream, it wasn't actually too potent. 

Chocolate Delice - dark Valrhona chocolate, caramelized bananas, peanut butter ice cream and brownie crumbs ($10). Love. Love. Love. A must order!

A fantastic meal from start to finish... remember to save room for dessert :)"}
{"text":"I chose this restaurant based on reviews, its closeness to the theatre (short walk), menu, and wheelchair accessibility. Great place! 

I don't understand why the profile has Wheelchair Accessible = NO, as I called to check and obviously also saw the set up. There is an elevator to the second floor (this restaurant is on the second floor; elevator is to the right if you enter from the main entrance); staff were accommodating in terms of reserving a spot that would work for our party and double-checked on that spot and its suitability when we arrived. The washrooms are single and reasonably spacious with individual doors (not button operated and not wide, mind you). Provided you are either quite independent in your chair or willing to ask for a little help with doors this should work in many cases. The building also has other restrooms in case, though I can't find a map of the building layout online.

Ambience, food, and service were lovely. The menu is smaller than at some restaurants, but we found great dishes despite having a few dietary restrictions. Those were well accommodated and an error was quickly addressed. (I could give this place a 5, but in good conscience an error, though corrected (from the kitchen in plating a dish) would make it 4.5 in my mind.) Our waiter was good-natured with a sense of humour and made our dining experience positive. The braised beef cheek was delicious as was the salmon with rosti and rotkraut. The cocktail was also refreshing and well done. Though we arrived later than planned, we were served quickly and would have had time for a full appetizer-entree-dessert meal if we had wanted in the hour and a half/45 ahead of our show. 

I'd definitely return as we were impressed and happy with the experience."}
{"text":"I recently came to Luma for dinner for a night out with my wife.  We were quite happy with the food and service overall.
Our server introduced himself as Tyler, and was very accommodating. He gave us a very detailed description for the menu items, as well as wine pairings for the food. The restaurant seems very high end and fancy, but Tyler made it feel much more comfortable while maintaining a professional stature.

Our appetizer was the \"Ricotta Gnudi\" (also available as an entree) with a truffle foam and sauteed mushrooms. It was a 10/10. A very rich dish I've never seen before but I must definitely come back for.  Highly recommended.

For our entree I had the chicken served on top of garlic kale and creamy polenta (although the bus boy who served it, a tall, heavy set, baby faced bus boy, informed me that it was buttermilk mashed potatoes! Know what you are serving guests!).  It had an excellent combination of flavors and was very filling.
My wife ordered the Garganelli with ricotta, squash, and almonds. Even though I'm not a fan of squash the pasta was very tasty and the squash was blended in perfectly with the dish.

We were unsure about our dessert as all the choices seemed quite delicious, so I asked someone close by who was another busboy (this one with black hair and a beard). He seemed like he knew the food quite well and gave me a very good description of all the desserts. But his description of the Luma Chocolate Bar was the winner.  So me and my wife each ordered it as we are fans of both chocolate and peanut butter.
It is basically a chocolate ganache, served with caramelized bananas, peanuts, brownie and peanut butter ice cream.  It was fantastic another item I must return to Luma for.

Excellent establishment, the fourth of O and B restaurants I have been to and is definitely the best one so far! (With Jump as a close second)
If you are ever in the King and John area, I highly recommend trying Luma out.  I am excited for the summer time when their patio will be open as well!"}
{"text":"Excellent decor on the second floor of Festival Tower overlooking King St with giant windows that give everyone a view. This place has a lounge look and sound, with an inviting atmosphere that favours groups more than couples.

The entrance bar is a bit too exposed for my liking, providing next to no separation from the main building where all the theatres sit, but this isn't a big drawback.

Service was above average with friendly smiles, professional look, and informed answers to questions about the menu.

Food wise, the sliders were a nice juicy starter with a fine aioli sauce. The organic chicken was tender with a notable jus, and the handmade paperdelle with braised shortrib and horseradish sauce was unique and tasty. Portions were just right too.

The drinks were not free poured but were made with care, resulting in fine balance. That's to be expected at this price. A glass of delicious 2010 Andeluna Malbec cost 13.50.

All in all, a nice place to enjoy an evening's meal."}
{"text":"Good flavour combinations though the portions are a bit small. The rooibos tea variant is excellent."}
{"text":"Came here for a birthday celebration yesterday. The happy hour drinks were $5 and they were good! We ordered the wasabi cosmo. We had their summerlious menu. Food was quick, served warm and was alright. The salad was good but the main entre (pork)  that I ordered was a little dry and tough to eat. My girlfriends order thr steam and catfish and they liked it. I Will definitely come back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Had drinks at the bar, and when I couldn't decide, the amazing bartender created me something brand new. Fantastic service, great view of the Film Fest, pricey but worth it."}
{"text":"Came here for summerlicious lunch this year.

Food:
Albacore tuna sashimi- this was decent
Cold poached wild salmon - both my guest and I thought this dish was very bland 
Pana cotta -  okay
Maple + whiskey marinated cheddar - good 


The service was great, the servers were very friendly.

The food is decent. I would recommend coming here for their regular menu"}
{"text":"Not impressed and won't be returning: rude service and a misleading promotion. They are currently running an after work promotion for $5 drinks and \"bites\". The menu was clear about which drinks were included in the special and it again confirmed that bites were also $5. We were very excited by this; we each got a drink and were perusing the menu to pick which bites we were going to order. To be sure about the bites, I asked the manager to confirm but he then told me none of the bites are on special. Some are listed under $5, which is why they felt it qualified, but they are as marked on the regular menu (one item is as high as $16 - a far cry from $5). Despite that, we were still willing to buy a few more drinks, but when my boyfriend and I were then ignored by the wait staff when try to order on two separate occasions, we were done. Thanks anyway, Luma! Won't be going back."}
{"text":"3/5. Recommend the tuna sashimi and maple whiskey cheese for dessert! The Arctic Char was okay. Overall, not too impressed with summerlicious at Luma. Healthier than other options though"}
{"text":"Me and my husband went to Luma for dinner before heading to the theatre. We ordered a bottle of Santome Merlot 2013 as written in the Wine menu. However, we were served a 2015 bottle and up on asking the server she said that their menu is not updated and if we didnt like the taste of the wine. Extremely upset and disappointed not only regarding her answer but also at her rude dismissive behaviour. It is about deceiving false advertisement. Moreover, she should have told us that they only had the 2015 bottle, in which case we would have chosen a different bottle. Trying to pass off a 2013 for a 2015 is just deceitful along with rude behaviour of the server. The taste of wine varies based on Year, soil, grape quality and we wanted 2013 red with our prime rib. Very disappointed, terrible experience and would not recommend Luma to anyone."}
{"text":"Huge place. Not a cozy joint. Booked through OpenTable and it worked perfectly.

The service was excellent. Attentive and professional the whole way through. Really impressed. The food was creative and the cocktails were very good. My vegetarian partner had a great meal. My salmon was perfectly cooked.

Lot of larger parties around us. Seems like a great spot for events."}
{"text":"Went for dinner before a show at the theatre next door and was extremely satisfied with my meal. I order the Marinated Tuna, the dinner size, and it was delicious. The flavours were perfect and not overwhelming. I will note that the dinner size is still very light, as it's slightly more tuna on some salad but the flavours are well worth it!
Then because of other reviewers, I tried the Luma Chocolate Bar for dessert and boy oh boy was it ever amazing! the peanut butter ice cream with the brownie, fudge, candied banana was just perfect. Every flavour blended well together and never felt too rich or too dry. I highly recommend this dessert and in fact will take my wife here just for the dessert!"}
{"text":"Yikes. Every time I eat here (maybe 10 times) I am disappointed. Today takes the cake.  In my lamb burger at lunch there was a huge piece of hard fat/gristle the size and heft of half a deck of cards. I actually pulled it out of the middle of the burger with a fork when I  hit something foreign with my teeth.   I'm still gagging when I think of it.  They didn't make me pay for it .... And apologized but so what.  Strike three"}
{"text":"A few coworkers and I went to Luma for Summerlicious lunch - $20 for an appetizer, entree and dessert.  Since O&B has a reputation for great restaurants and food, I was excited to try it.  I was not disappointed, and my entire party was extremely happy with our meals.

I started with the cured albacore tuna.  For some reason, I thought it was going to be a tuna salad (chalk that up to a long week!), and I was happily surprised to see a pile of plump, cured tuna morsels arrive on my plate.  The tuna was succulent and melted in my mouth and had the perfect amount of salt and acidity.  The pea gremolata tasted fresh and clean - a perfect balance with the fish.  This meal was starting out well!

For my entree, I ordered the poached wild salmon.  I don't usually order salmon as it's not one of my favourite fish, but I figured the other two options (pork loin or truffle lasagna) would be too heavy for lunch.  The salmon was delicious and perfectly cooked.  It flaked just as expected and had great flavour.  The accompanying salad had egg, tomato , green beans, anchovy and potato and was a wonderful combination of texture and flavour.  Everything tasted extremely fresh and summery - a great dish for a hot and humid day.

To end everything, I had a citrus custard and pine nut biscotti.  The custard was a tad heavier than I anticipated, but the flavour was spot on.  The candied zest was a great textural balance and provided some sweetness to the dish.  The biscotti was also the perfect match with it's muted sweet flavour and crunch.

Overall a great meal, and a great chance to hang out with my fellow foodie friends."}
{"text":"Our meal here was good but not great. I would give it three and a half stars if I could. Our favorite part was the dessert sampler. It was fun to try mini sized portions of the restaurant's various desserts."}
{"text":"Decent space for a quick drink. Roomy and air-conditioned. $9 for plain fries without the Parmesan and truffles was silly."}
{"text":"My wife and I went to Luma for dinner.  We had high expectations given that it's an O&B and it got such great yelp reviews.  What we found was that the ambiance was fine, the service was fine, but the food was not fine.

The bread appetizer had a hard crusted bread that was actually painful to eat, and the butter was hard and therefore difficult to apply.   We did order the warmed marinated olives with garlic, rosemary, and chilly, and we both agreed that this was delectable.

I ordered the Tagliolini for my main. You can tell when something is made and mixed fresh right before serving because it looks moist and textured.  This Tagliolini looked flat, dry, as though it was pre-made and put in a fridge, and reheated.

My wife ordered the steak frites. She ordered medium well, it came back dry.  I can definately cook up a tastier steak here at home, and i'm just an amateur chef.

hope this helps!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing...melt in your mouth meats with unique flavor. Service was a little slow."}
{"text":"Decided on Luma for a Summerlicious lunch with a couple girlfriends this weekend. Granted, I knew from past experience with 'licious dining to lower my standards by a few notches, but this was quite a disappointing meal.  Based on previous Yelpers' reviews I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised despite the overall decline in quality during Summer/Winterlicious promotions. 
I had: octopus salad to start, grilled albacore tuna is my main, and the melon with sorbet for dessert. The octopus salad had good flavours and was balanced well with the chickpeas and sharpness of the greens, however the entire salad itself felt like it was at an odd temperature; it wasn't quite chilled enough and felt like I was eating lukewarm food left to sit out for too long - this may just be a matter of opinion. The tuna dish arrived as three thick slices of seared tuna, sadly sprinkled with coarse sea salt which was not nearly enough to hide the rather fishy taste and otherwise boring blandness of the fish. It came on top of some green sauce with fennel mixed in; the sauce did not provide enough complexity or bite to complement the fish and felt overall too heavy. The one good thing about the entree was the crisp, fresh green beans. As disappointing as the rest of the meal was, I have to say the dessert was the absolute worst. I was served a trio of melons: watermelon, cantaloupe and honeydew, none of which looked or tasted fresh. The sorbet was overly sweet and grainy in texture. Sad end to a rather sad meal, despite the perfect patio weather and great company. 
I also had a taste of my girlfriends' dishes; in short, the fried chicken was bland and flavourless beneath the battered fried skin and the beef ribs were cooked to fall off the bone but severely lacked moistness and flavour. We had also ordered a pitcher of their sangria which, while packing a decent punch, was way too tart to enjoy; the pitcher was $44 and the value is definitely questionable considering it yielded about 3 and a half glasses (single glasses are $11 each). The service was friendly but a little absent toward the end of the meal; we had to wave down a bus boy to ask him to request our bill from our server."}
{"text":"Just came from Luma. 

The huge interior  was sleekly designed but we opted to sit at the glass-balconied patio overlooking the busy streets. Not the best view but al fresco dining from the 2nd floor is a rare treat in Toronto, or anywhere. 

The caesar salad was slightly bland, if not for the anchovies and bacon.  I'm surprised it came with half a boiled quail egg.

Much to our dismay, the main dishes came one hour later.

Arctic char, with red beans and brussel sprouts, was tasty....soaked in a sort of vinagraitte.

The tenderloin steak, perfectly sized, was also enjoyable.

Fries (with hints of garlic?) were delightfully crunchy.

We were too full to have desserts. 

Probably a bit pricey but this is a place to visit from time to time, particularly for the patio in summer."}
{"text":"Luma has the yummiest drinks in T.O.  Thanks to the 007 exhibit, the Luma bar is serving delicious martinis. My favourite is the \"Mary Goodnight\"... so yummy as a dessert item! My husband enjoys the \" Goldeneye\" with real flecks of edible gold. We enjoy sitting at the bar chatting with fellow patrons. The appetizers are always a perfect sharing size. We have found the burrata and beet salad to be two of our favourites. The bar staff are super friendly and remember you when you return...we appreciate this! This is a wonderful spot to enjoy pre-show and post-show drinks and always creative, delicious food."}
{"text":"Loved the location, overlooking king and john makes for some great balcony dining combined with sitting on the tiff lightbox. This provides a great atmosphere to share a dinner with a dining partner or two.

Came here for the summerlicious menu, the dining partner got the soup with crab and avocade, the arctic char with quinoa, and the aged cheese plate. I got the tuna sashimi, arctic char, and the peaches and cornbread. 
Both meals were top notch, great quality, perfectly seasoned and cooked, the server had great timing and made sure to keep our water's topped up . 

Would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"We had an excellent experience at Luma during Summerlicious.  We booked a table for 7 at the last minute and they were able to accommodate us on the patio in the corner table overlooking King and John St.  Fantastic table during the summer with a great view of the CN tower while dining.   For a Wednesday night the restaurant was packed.

Everyone at the table ordered from the summerlious menu.  I ordered the saigon salad, seared albacore tuna, and summer berry pudding and really enjoyed the meal.  Most of the table ordered the grilled flatiron steak as their main and raved about it.  We also ordered a few options from their main menu - truffle and parmesan frites, grilled octopus and scallop sashimi.  The frites were amazing!   I have to also add that the service was excellent.

It was my first time going there and we really enjoyed our night. We will be coming back."}
{"text":"This is a few months overdue!! So I returned to Luma for dinner and had one of the most enjoyable dining experience.  First off, the set menu is really affordable and jam packed with quality.  The truffle oil, wild mushroom lasagna was simply my kryptonite. We shared the Burrata, fresh cheese flown in from Italy...never had it before and also it was heavenly. The Tuna tartar was very different, almost like a ceviche and again so good. Our waiter put up with my friend who's super difficult and allergic to everything. Chef Bangerter also came out to make sure we were having a good time.  I think LUMA is a special Toronto gem.  Glad to see how much it's grown thru the past few months."}
{"text":"Barely gave it a 3 stars but i really like the location and the ambience. very modern , spacious and comfortable. 

the service was great , loved our waitress, fabulous smile , fairly attentive. 

the food is where the issue is. its not bad.. its just honestly very average, nothing at all stood out to us on the table. some points to consider:

-the chef tomato soup special of the day , tasted like the paste came from cans. \
-the marinated yellowfin tuna was literally raw fish, few slices of raw veg and a droplet of jalapeno sauce on the side. it was fairly bland.. 
-the beef ribs were touch dry, but mostly severely underseasoned.
-the garlic whipped mash potatoes, were almost liquid like on the plate.
-the parmesan truffle fries, had almost no hint of those 2 ingredients.. could have fooled me
-the norther woods mushroom was simply oyster mushrooms , underseasoned and with some stems left which were super chewy.
-the marinated olives came with the maincourse when we asked for it with our starters.
-the coffee tasted old
-the sorbet was mediocre at best.

i was just a bit let down as i expected a bit more bang from this place. i honestly regret not going down to the OB canteen below which had a nicer menu ! 

again if it wasnt for the friendly waitress and the ambience this place was certainly be 2.5 stars at best"}
{"text":"Luma a reasonable choice for a meal at John/King (certainly better than the string of restaurants on the South side of the street). If you're looking dinner and a movie, it's a convenient and likely non-disappointing experience. 

The food is fairly pricey, but the wine list is quite good, and the service top-notch. Had my napkin refolded for me about 4 times."}
{"text":"Not worth the price. You're just paying for location. For a fine dine restaurant, food is so-so and the plate had this disgusting black crack. The best part was the dessert and even that, I've had better. This place is a tourist trap. The service is above average, though and for that, I'm adding another star."}
{"text":"Terrace is fun, a lot of action at King & John, but too loud for an intimate dinner.
Food was good.  Vidalia onion app is a bit misleading, as there is only modest amount of onion - more like a salad with blue cheese and roasted onion (based on flavour prominence).  Calamari was nice, and halibut was well prepared.
Service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"***4.5 Stars ***

I was at Luma last night to try their Winterlicious menu.  I had heard great reviews and experiences at Luma so it was on the must-try list for Winterlicious.  I made reservations online versus call in, the reservation process was a breeze.  When they called back to confirm the reservation, they stated that we had 90 minutes to dine because of the Winterlicious menu!  I was a bit taken back, but half expected it.

The food was top notch - both my friend and I tried the beetroot soup with blue cheese and walnuts.  My friend did not want the blue cheese topping and they were able to accommodate her request.  The soup was comforting, loved the sweet and savoury flavour profile.

Now to the mains, I ordered the tuna and my friend ordered the flat iron steak.  The tuna was cooked to perfection, seared on the outside and raw in the middle.  I really enjoyed the bean mixture it can with.  My friend could not stop talking about the steak, it was cooked to her taste - medium rare.  Each morsel was divine.

Desserts - we both had the bread pudding - it was delicious.  I could have eaten more if there was more.  It was the right amount of sweetness to end the meal.

Service was fabulous - our waitress was attentive. My glass of water was never empty.  Funny enough they forgot about us at the end when we were trying to pay our bill.  We did not feel rushed to leave which contradicted what was mentioned to me at the reservation confirmation time.

I am curious to come back to Luma for a non-Winterlicious time.  For $35 for three courses, it was a great deal for a memorable meal."}
{"text":"I came her for lunch during Summerlicious, and had an absolutely stellar meal. I really have nothing negative to say. The decor is simple and beautiful, the service friendly and professional,  and the food was extremely good.

I had the smoky tomato gazpacho, chilled poached wild salmon, and citrus custard. My boyfriend had the romaine salad, truffle and ricotta lasagna, and the chocolate bread and butter pudding. Everything had a pretty, clean presentation, and a truly memorable taste. My favourite dishes were my salmon, boyfriend's lasagna (we mutually agreed that it was the best lasagna we'd ever tasted), and the phenomenal bread and butter pudding. Oh. My. God. I'm almost glad that it carries the price tag that it does, or I would probably be eating it for three meals a day. 

Don't hesitate, try this place!"}
{"text":"Dinner here on Saturday, pre-show. Even though I had to send my steak back because it was undercooked I have to compliment the chef as it was very delicious. Also, the charred octopus is fantastic. I would recommend this restaurant to my friends."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was nice and interesting at first but over time it was just too crowded and open. Felt like a cafeteria. Food was great. I loved the pork hock and my steak was pretty good. I did not enjoy the parmesan fries, the truffle oil was a bit overpowering.
Service was prompt and friendly. I will not likely go back however. Not my style for an expensive dinner. Convenient if attending TIFF."}
{"text":"Waitress was a delight- cheerful and pleasant. The food was average- I liked the braised short ribs. The pear and Goat cheese salad was a huge let down. Two crumbs of cheese does not make a goat cheese salad. The chocolate dessert they have is amazing."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place out! I was very excited to dine here and honestly I had a wonderful experience. 

We came here after some horrible drinks and service at Weslodge to have dinner. The hostess was friendly and quick to get us to our tables, and even took care of our coats. 

The seating area is beautiful and elegant. We were served drinks and bread with a potato purée and butter immediately. 

Our food took some time to come however we were a large group. My friends enjoyed their meals as we ordered the lamb, ribs, lobster burger, steak and squid. 

The least favourite of the night was the lobster burger and squid. Not so tasty as my friends said. But they enjoyed the ribs and lamb. My steak was excellent, cooked and seasoned to perfection. The side of fries were great as well. 

The customer service is amazing. They are friendly, and best of all so quick! We got our bill right away when we asked and paid separately. No hassle! 

I would come here again especially for their winterlicious. Had a wonderful time."}
{"text":"I was given a task to find a place to eat.  Usually since I'm the planner, I did the anti-planning thing and was procrastinated until the last minute to find a restaurant before our show.  

I knew I read on twitter that there was a restaurant that opened in the new Bell Lightbox which was 2 blocks from the Royal Alex.  I also thought I read about another Oliver and Bonacini establishment.  I was right and made reservations to Luma.  On the Open Table website they had no reservations between 5:45 and 8:30.  I put down 5:45 and then had to call to book for 6 PM.  I didn't want to deal with the Friday downtown early evening traffic.  

Very nice set up on the 2nd floor of the Bell Lightbox.  We didn't get the window view but had a nice view of a huge mirror while my gf sat on the comfortable bench side and could people watch.  

If you're one to not worry about meal prices then this would be the place for you.  They  have a small menu with about 10 entree items and 10 appetizers.  Just the way I like it.  As some who have followed me on Yelp, I tend to not like restaurants who give you pages upon pages of options to choose from.  Simple is all I ask when you want to wind down for the evening.  

I ordered the lamb sirloin and  my gf ordered the chicken.  The flavouring was succulent and cooked to perfection.  They both come with an array of veggies with the dishes.  What's interesting too was that with your dishes, or at least they ones they had, they added shredded pieces of the meat your ordered which made it that more exciting.  Mind you the plates were relatively small so you know it's more about the conversation than wolfing down the meal.  

For dessert my gf order the choco delice and I ordered the opera cake.  The choco delice reminded me a soft version of a hershey dark chocolate bar topped with a strategically places spoonful of very delectable peanut butter ice cream.  My opera cake was light with many layers.  It came with a bowl of caramel popcorn and a side of popcorn ice cream.  

The only negative of this was although we had one main server, I think we had about 5 different people come to our table.  But I guess was kind of made up for this was the geriatric couple who sat beside us.  They were pretty funny because the men were talking about \"dirty sex\".  I don't remember the context but at the time we couldn't believe what we were hearing from them.  A good laugh to end the evening at Luma."}
{"text":"Really, really, really liked Luma. I thought they did a tremendous job in an event we had at the Bell Lightbox. 

Food was well prepared, they took into consideration the dietary needs of our guests and the servers were fantastic. 

It is great when you can rely on a restaurant to provide fantastic service and comparably thoughtful food and menu design. They really made my event fantastic."}
{"text":"I'm not huge on going out for Winter- or Summerlious as I typically find the menu limited and value minimal at most participating restaurants (I much prefer just going outside of the event). However, Luma was a pleasant surprise. 

We enjoyed a 3-course pre-fixe dinner at Luma on Saturday night for only $38 each.  S/O and I ordered cocktails to start and shared a bottle of Californian Cab Sauv for dinner which brought our dinner experience up to about $200 but it was all well worth it. 

Start:  We tried the Ham Hock field salad and escargot dish. They were both quite substantial for a starter.  
The escargot came with 6 large snails, some sausage, caramelized onions on a piece of soft yet crunchy bread. Very tasty.
The salad was dressed well with niblets of smoked ham and blue cheese as well as some green apple to cut the savouryness.  Very good and all components blended together well considering the strong flavours of each.

Mains: I had the duck confit, the duck was crispy on the outside, soft and juicy on the inside.  Came on a bed of bean (salad?) The bean salad was the only thing I would have changed. The flavours were good but the beans were too starchy and dry to pair with the texture of the duck.
We also ordered the Roasted pork loin, it was perfectly cooked and juicy.  It has a very traditional canadian pairing of apply and maple jus as well as roasted potatoes and cauliflower.

For dessert we both ordered the ripened goat cheese.  I've tried a lot of cheeses both at restaurants and specialty cheese stores around Toronto and it's hard to find new or unique cheeses but this goat cheese was a first for us.  It had a dark rind texture was a lot of a aged brie.  Tasted like a goaty brie with some blue cheese tones, very interesting and yummy. Paired well with the figs and honey they provided with the dish. Excellent finish to the meal.

I would easily go back again to Luma, it's an easily accessible location, reservations aren't hard to get and the value is here for modern Canadian cuisine.  Service is fast, efficient and personable.  The ambiance is airy yet warm for the large space they have."}
{"text":"No restaurant in the Tiff Building/Tower/Condo is good. The canteen downstairs was bad, and unfortunately, Luma was equally disappointing. One would hope that an O&B restaurant, coupled with its attachment to a Tiff building, would spur good Canadian cuisine. But, nope. I think the restaurant was really just piggy-backing on the location and name of \"Tiff\" without much thought to anything else.

Having said that, I did read other reviews for Luma and most people have really enjoyed the food. So, was it the time of day we went (Saturday night at 10pm?) Or was it just a bad night? Who knows.

My fiancé and I went out with 15 guests who had come from Montreal and so we decided on a central location. The interior is nice: lots of amber lighting, modern, glass, etc... No complaints there. Service was spot on: waters filled, made sure our wine glasses were never kept empty, etc...No complaints there.

But the food, oh the food!

Everyone around the table had an average to less-then-mediocre experience. Short ribs were dry. Not fallin-of-the-bone-melt-in-your-mouth kind. It seemed that this short rib was just a left-over for the day. My gnocchi wasn't traditional Italian style, but rather, tasted more like fried dumplings. I don't like cucumbers with my gnocchi. Another friend had the fish which was dry. The accompanying quinoa was even dryer. Other friends had salads (can't go wrong with leaves) and the mushroom soup was overly salty.

So. In essence, I (and none of these people) will be coming back again to Luma. 

I find with O&B, it's either a hit or miss and Luma is a definite miss. My fiancé and I thought it was just the end of the night so we felt like we got the left-over food and tired cook staff. But, is that any excuse? Luma wasn't cheap so a restaurant should be providing great food any time of day. Either way, what a shame."}
{"text":"Atmosphere seems really nice, sat outside and enjoyed the hustle and bustle. House made ricotta on top of compressed watermelon was amazing but the service here is terrible! Although we were shown our table almost immediately, it took almost 20 minutes to place a drink order and get our drinks. Then after another 20 minutes, I had to go inside and locate a server in order to place our order. Server has not checked back in and we are eating lunch at 2pm so it's not busy at all. I believe we are only 1 of 2 total tables. We are on vacation from out of town and had plans for our last full day here in Toronto but with dinner reservations, we no longer have time to do what we wanted since we have waited so long on service here. Very disappointing. Food was good so 2 stars."}
{"text":"So I came here for the lunch recently...going in I didn't think Luna would live up to the hype... but I was proven wrong. It was late lunch, so the restaurant was very quiet. I ordered the lobster and shrimp burger with no bun and my bf got a fish and chips sandwich.

First of all, the waiter was super helpful and well versed on the menu and the various ingredients used. He made suggestions, and we enjoyed every bit of it. 

My lobster and shrimp burger was moist and taste. It came with a light cucumber salad. I'm glad I got it without the bun because I really got to enjoy fresh ingredients without hiding the taste. $23

The fish and chips sandwich was delicious. It was open face with tartar sauce, capers and lemon. Kettle chips light peppered. Yummy. $14

We also ordered a side of their spicy fries.$6

I don't remember what the same of our dessert was but it had poached pears and pistachios! I wish my bf didn't like it so I didn't have to share but he did =( $9

It hasn't been too long ago but i'm already craving this meal. Will definitely go back for dinner."}
{"text":"Dinner at Luma is fantastic! (Although Brunch reviews aren't so fab.)
Pre-theatre dinner reservations were made on Open Table. We arrive just on time to see Massimo Capra, one of Toronto's 'famous' chefs leaving... good sign! 
Since I know the drink menu is fantabulous, I ordered my fave, The Adjuster- a strong drink to loosen up the appetite. 
I also ordered 'a lot' of tap water, which was the big downfall of the evening. Having just worked out, I was dry, but my water glass was always empty. I asked for a pitcher that I saw on other tables, but perhaps that was not Toronto's finest, but a bottled water in a pitcher??? 
The other drink I ordered was the Beatlejuiced (Tim Burton special) with gin and cucumber and real pink peppercorns. Well, if you get really creative with the drink menu, there are bound to be a few 'misses'. Peppercorn skins kept get stuck in my mouth and throat and I just gave up and orderd a wine with my main course. 
The food was perfect. I started with the special soup- celeriac puree with toasted almonds and then had \"The Big Fish\" Tim Burton special, which is popular with Yelpers, but one of my top dishes this year so far. Lots of chick peas, full of nutrition, some lettuce, and seared tuna slices. Filling, but not heavy.  After this perfect meal, I didn't have room for dessert and headed down the hall for my movie after a quick stop at the unisex washrooms that are cozy and well-lit. 
Great location for dinner and a movie and even drinks and dessert afterwards!"}
{"text":"Saturday night, somehow managed to get a table for 7pm. Normally in good restaurants i struggle with which item to pick from the menu. I usually um and err over 2 choices. But in Luma i was stuck between the rabbit, the steak, the salmon, the chicken or the venison.
Eventually i went with the steak to try out the parmasan frites that go along side it, my choice was made easier too because my dad chose the rabbit so I could test some of that dish as well!
The steak was medium rare just as i asked, deliciously tender and the frites were good! The rabbit was amazing with a herby flavouring. I also had the garlic confit mushrooms to start, this was a plate of many different types of mushroom which was interesting, ive never noticed the difference in tastes and textures before. Mushrooms were always just mushrooms to me. My dad had the squid to start that was a nice light japanese battered dish with a fresh salad.
The vesper's rose cocktail is delicious, it tastes like grape soda, not sure how considering its rose gin, vodka, creme yvette and .... Oh i forget, it was so good i had to order a different drink in between to stop myself from chugging them.
Shame we didnt get a window seat, would have loved to people watch from that great view. But wherever u are seated in that room, its a lovely place, nice simple decor but still luxurious.
Our waitress was kind and attentive, but she was one of those people that put her smile on purely for the customers when she got near a table.... But i suppose thats the grind of daily work life and is the same with everyone in all jobs.

I am so going back! I need to try the venison and the salmon, oh no maybe the octopus....

But not for a while, cause its expensive!"}
{"text":"Directed to Luma by the concierge at the Intercontinental. Located 2nd floor of the same building that houses the Tiff Bell Lightbox / home to the Toronto Film Festival... the space is modern clean and warm... The service staff is excellent ( i have to say that they were \"tested\" by a patron who was very unfortunately acting a bit like a jerk until his table succeeded in getting a few drinks in him) and very tolerant, not batting an eye.
The Wide Awake cocktail is a tasty combo of  Jameson's irish whiskey, espresso, fennel, orange...this hit the spot as a fan of non-dessert espresso martinis...in other words its not a glass of liquid sugar...which is appreciated.
The most pleasant surprise of the evening was the grilled octopus / eggplant pickle, lemon, candied olives and romesco! I'd almost fly the 5 hours back from LA for this appetizer! A+ Luma A+!
Main was yellowfin tuna  organic bibb lettuce, green beans, tomato, chickpeas and tonnato with a texture, taste, temperature and presentation of A minus.... there was a little something about the blandness of the chickpeas that did not honor this wonderfully prepared fish that ultimately left me smiling.
No dessert as this was quite filling, satisfying, pleasing!
Thank you Luma"}

{"text":"Great atmosphere, good location, amazing food. 

Located in the TIFF building, this restaurant is cozy, classy and great for a girls night out!
I recently visited for a friends birthday. We were all blown away by the dishes, our waitress went above and beyond to met our needs, and she was great at making conversation and making us feel welcomed! We felt like she was apart of our group. She was great at making recommendations to our party. 
The food was well seasoned, cooked perfectly and exceeded our expectations and more. 

Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a late night Wednesdate dinner at Luma last week.  

It was 9pm and seating was abundant in both the dining and lounge area. Lighting in the dining area is extremely bright, which is what I usually prefer, but seeing as it was date night we opted for the more romantic feel of the corner booth in the lounge. 

Starter:
Lamb Kabobs - Not the typical Mediterranean style kabobs that usually come to mind - these ones were intentionally charred, filled with spicy herbs, crumbly in texture, and leaning a bit too much on the dry side. 

Mains:
Wild Sockeye Salmon - My second choice after looking at the menu, but a great choice none the less. My date selected my first choice of the braised rabbit gnocchi and naturally I had to select another dish - we can't both order the same main right? Salmon was cooked perfectly and delightfully paired with the side of butternut squash, brussel sprouts and beets. 

Braised rabbit and Gnocchi -The rabbit was shredded and gnocchi was softly cooked in a creamy sauce. Good ratio of carbs to meat, really no complaints.  

Dessert:
Luma Bar - A sensation of fudge, peanut butter ice cream, nuts and fruit - definitively share this to end off a great meal. 

Overall: 
Food: 9/10 for well made Canadian cuisine - would opt for a different starter next time. 
Service: 10/10 , waitresses were friendly and had timely service.  
Atmosphere: 10/10, Luma is located on the second level of the tiff light box with a view of king street west. Dining and Lounge seating available.  Great vibe for a date or for groups.

Eat here."}
{"text":"Went to luma for dinner on the 21st.  The service and the food was amazing as well as the mixed cocktails.  Myself and boyfriend had the duck lettuce wraps as an appetizer...delicious!! We then ordered the steak frites and the braised lamb, highly recommend them both.  I will definitely be returning to Luma and recommend everyone give this spot a try."}
{"text":"I have a backlog of reviews to write, but I had to prioritize this restaurant first because I would avoid coming here at all cost. The food is not good (strike 1), the service is incredibly slow, (strike 2) and the price just makes you question the entire experience (yeah, you're out). This is just my 2nd 1-star review out of my 2 years on Yelp, so this 1-star decision was really difficult for me. 

I've been here twice. My first experience was not so good.  I ordered an appetizer at a friend's birthday dinner and the thing was dressed, covered, singing, and dancing in sea salt. There was no way I could take a bite without getting a mouth full of salt. (Please see picture). The clam-like things were also sprinkled with sea salt. It was impossible to scrape all the salt crystals off. There must have been something else that bothered me about Luma, because I still have a negative impression of the restaurant from my first time here, but I can't remember anything aside from the Salt Dish. (Seriously, what kind of dish concept was that???)

I forgot this restaurant even existed until my other friend and I were walking into Luma. It then dawned upon me that we would be getting the worst of the worst. I should have realized this was *THE* *TERRIBLE* *RESTAURANT* as I was the the one who made the reservation. In my defense, I probably blocked it out of my memory because it was so bad. 

I made a reservation for 6 on OpenTable for Winterlicious on a Wednesday evening and I indicated in the Notes section that it was for a friend's birthday. I usually put additional notes for special events because I never want to pick a bad restaurant for a friend's party! The additional notes is just for me to tell the people working to PLEASE be timely with the food and make it extra tasty.  

We arrived at 6, and we were seated on the complete other side of the window that was facing King. My Birthday Friend's GF asked the waitress if we could move towards the window since there were a lot of free tables. The waitress said no, that we were not allowed to sit by the windows. I didn't know how more VIP I was supposed to be for sitting there. I made reservations crazy early in advance, and plus, it was someone's birthday. In hindsight, I'm assuming they don't put their Winterlicious guests there. 

The service seemed to be really slow, ESPECIALLY for Winterlicious when the menu is already set. We arrived at 6 and we didn't even end up leaving the restaurant until 8:30ish because no one would come pick up our food or give us our bills. I don't remember the last time I was at a restaurant for over 2 hours, especially for Winterlicious. Honestly, I thought we'd be done in an hour. 

For the appetizers, I ordered the sweet potato soup and it was just underwhelming. There was nothing special about it, but a drizzle of olive oil. Birthday Friend's bone marrow was pretty much all bone. 

And then my roasted trout came. The brussel sprouts on my plate was incredible, that was really good, but the star of dish was plain. For a Winterlicious meal that was $43, I could't believe the skin on my trout was NOT CRISPY. I'm sure roasted fish can still be crispy. The eggplant puree? whatever it was (it's the brown stuff in the picture) just tasted nasty to me. I didn't realize it was eggplant until my friend asked me, \"Did you think the eggplant was really salty?\" 

I'm not sure why the dessert took 20 minutes to come out. While we waited, I was really regretting come to the restaurant. The dessert was good, but way too sweet for me to finish. 

TLDR; If you're looking for upscale Canadian cuisine, just avoid coming here at all. To an extent, I can excuse bad food and bad service for an inexpensive meal, but I cannot excuse bad food and bad service for a crazy expensive meal."}
{"text":"I give this a 4 star, though not well deserved. The thing that brings it to up 4 was the service we received from our server. She was delightful and warming. My friend and I tried their winterlicious lunch menu. I have to say the wait time for our main dish was not impressive. The bite size smidgen appetizer could have been double the size. I have to admit it, it was tasty as was the dessert. The ambiance of the restaurant was great with vaulted ceiling and an open feel. 

I understand its part of the winterlicious and the high end restaurants would like everyone to have a glimpse of what they have to offer but perhaps you could increase the portion just a tad.

Disclosure: This was sitting in my incomplete list and I haven't frequent Yelp for some time. This visit happened 1 year ago and just being posted now. My apologies Yelpers!"}
{"text":"I visited Luma on New Year's Eve much more quiet hen I anticipated but perhaps most people were partying. 

We chose the a la carte menu which may have been a bad choice in the end. Both I and my sister had the trout celery clam chowder to start. The creaminess of the chowder and saltiness of the trout were not palette friendly at all. I did not eat much of this. 


As my entree I got braised beef which was delicious but I would have appreciated if they asked me how I liked my beef cooked because they gave me medium rare and I prefer medium well. My sister had duck and was singing its praises. 

For dessert (my favourite part) we had lemon ice cream with blueberries and chocolate creme ....delicious! 

Dinner was pretty good it was the service that brings down the rating of Luma. The waitress never checked on us after we were brought each dish to ensure we were enjoying our meal. On top of that we had to continuously ask other waiters to get us drinks. Unacceptable!! 

I would visit Luma again but I hope for better service."}
{"text":"Luma has drink specials after 3 pm on weekdays, and they are all $5 drinks.  This is only in the section of the second floor that's a \"bar\".  The drink specials are pretty solid, from martinis to manhattens. This is a good deal.  This is how they earned 3, and not 2, stars.

The problems lie with the rest of the space.  The bar area has a shit ambiance.  It feels like a church basement bar or something.  They've attempted to make something of it, but it falls flat.  I don't really know why, I just know that it felt very un-hip in there.  

Meanwhile, the communication of the team that works there is also shit.  I had made a reservation online, but then realized it may not be for the bar area, where the drink special is.  I called in to ask and she said that yes, the drink special is only applicable in the bar, but that they don't serve food there?  Wasn't really clear on what that meant because that made no sense to me, so I told her we'd decide where we wanted to sit when we got in.

Arrived and checked in with the hostess, and my friend and I decided to sit in the bar because this time she said yes, there was food there and they'd even be willing to serve us the full dinner menu in that space if we wanted.  Great.  (By the way, she also marked me as a \"no show\" on OpenTable, so be sure if you have a reservation to over stress your arrival)

We find seats and sit down.  Waiter comes over.  He tells us we can't drink OR eat in the seats we've chosen? So I'm like - ok, tell us where to sit then? and he's like, oh no ok i guess it's fine?  So I still have no idea their drink or food policy, or what space is what.  It was confusing as heck.

They only had one food and drink menu for the entire bar, so we all just kept having it passed amongst us.  This was odd.  Get more menus.

In the end, the drink special would bring me back, but you sort of hope those deals are going to lure you in but then you discover some great place that you want to come back to for other things.

Oh, and my friend said the chicken taco was awful.  :)  I did pay in nickels and dimes, sadly (still tipped appropriately, just had awkward amounts of change), and the waiter said, \"Can I bring you some change?\" when he came to get the bill, and I thought that was hilarious.  Maybe an extra star for that, too."}
{"text":"So Ive heard about this place for years and finally got a chance to experience during the Luma Magic Hour. Love the ambiance , atmosphere and food. Its a great place for intimate converstion with friends or a dinner date. I always recommend it to people I know ."}
{"text":"My friends and I came to Luma after venturing to Second City and we had a really nice time. The waitress was really friendly and the restaurant looked really nice. They have a dining area and a cozy lounge section. 

We sat in the lounge section. It took a while for our waitress to come and take our orders but it was a nice experience.

One of my friends had the cafe Nanaimo and it looked amazing (she said it was too). It arrived with gold flakes on top of the foam (or whip cream). My friend said her drink was to die for. However, this drink cannot be made for the lactose intolerant clientele. 

My other friend and I ordered the jasmine tea. Our teas arrived in iron tea pots, which made the experience even more unique.

I would definitely venture back to Luma to try their main menu.

Our experience was definitely 4-stars. However, when I called Luma in February to book my birthday dinner with 10 guests, they informed me they could not accommodate my food sensitivities during winterlicious because it is a pre-set meal. I found this absurd because Winterlicious is created so foodies can try new places to see if they want to go back.  I found this attitude unacceptable and as a result I have to lower my rating to 3-stars."}

The rolls were perfect: great consistency, refreshing and light...and very summery. It was a tad salty but i washed it down with a root beer float and it was great. The Chef was very friendly and put together a platter of 10 lobster rolls for our famished group. 

Too bad i can't say the same for its pathetic sister restaurant O&B Canteen. Terrible food (see my review for O&B Canteen and keep away until they spruce up service there)"}

I ordered the chicken liver parfait, fish cake, and the stone fruit cobbler for dessert. The appetizer and entrees were great in terms of colour, texture, flavours. Dessert was pretty standard, although still a treat to end the meal with!

It definitely is a Summerlicious location to check out, especially with the $23 price tag. I will be returning :)"}
{"text":"I love the location and quiet ambience of this restaurant. The mixed drinks were great. My food experience was inconsistent.  The braised beef cheek and truffle fries were delicious, but the fogo island cod ($36) was overcooked and rubbery. I also tried the strawberry shortcake which wasn't a strawberry shortcake at all.. it was a lemon cake covered in strawberries. I wasn't a fan of the dessert, the lemon cake was dry and dense."}
{"text":"The experience lived up to its recommendation. The staff were very knowledgeable, the wine selection was great; recommend a lazy cabreze. So goooood!
The seabass was a new edition on the menu and did not disappoint.
Had the opportunity to meet the head chef and made us feel right at home."}
{"text":"Amazing food! I ordered braised short rib dinner, savoured every moment. Will definitely be back. Servers had great personality, ambiance was relaxing. Nice spot!"}
{"text":"Went to luma with wife and friends this weekend for winterlicious menu. 

I've been here a few years ago for winterlicious and this time the menu was different which was a pleasant surprise. It was a 3 course prix fix meal for $28.

Our group got for appetizer a potato pear compote, shrimp and avocado salad and a mozzarella and grape pomegranate salad. For the main course salmon and cream cheese on bagel and the seared trout on bed of potatoes and peppers. For dessert we got apple fritter with vanilla ice cream and a mint chocolate brownie thing.

Overall everyone  liked their meals and it was definitely filling . Presentation was great. The apps were delicious and the trout and potato was solid. The dessert was delicious o wanted seconds of the apple fritter. 

Really a sloid place for any meal with lots of selection, more than ample seating and very nice decor inside. The servers are very nice as well. There s ample parking on king st and behind the building."}
{"text":"I came here because of Summerlicious 2014, review online looks ok that's why I picked LUMA for lunch. The interior is ok and service is ok too. But the food which is the main point of everything was not delicious at all. All three courses were very so so. The picture of the foods look great, but taste is below regular. That my honest review."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located on the 2nd floor and they are very accommodating to families. The ambience is great and the patio overlooking King street was cute. Kept our 2 year old entertained while we tried to feed him. But be careful there are cracks in the wall and the deck feels a little loose!!

I had the rockfish which was ok. Husband had the chicken to share with the 2 year old. We thought the food was just ok. Not overwhelmingly delicious but not bad either. 

This place looks like a great drink spot. Probably better for happy hour than family with toddler and 6 month old baby."}
{"text":"I generally don't leave reviews, but, this meal left me confused. I'll preface this by saying that I'm vegetarian, so those looking for a review on meat dishes need not read further. 

Overall, the service was adequate. The waiter was pleasant and we were seated and served promptly. I don't have much more to say positively or negatively about the service. 

With regard to the meal. I wasn't really hungry so I skipped ordering an appetizer and only ordered an entree. I ordered the Charred Broccoli for $21. It was described as Charred Broccoli - tofu tahini, sesame, pickled onions, radish, orange, black garlic. I also ordered some truffle fries and chili garlic rapini for the table.  Admittedly, I should've clarified what tofu tahini was. I assumed this dish was broccoli with marinated tofu. This was literally a plate of grilled broccoli. It was flavorful broccoli, but still, a $21 dollar plate of broccoli. So you're probably wondering why I was confused after the meal. Well, the rest of the menu had dishes that included interesting things like \"wild mushrooms, barley porridge, mustard greens,\" and \"bok choy, glass noodles, vietnamese coconut broth, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, green mango, peanuts.\" You'd assume that a chef that could be creative with most other aspects of the menu, would be capable of adding some flare to a vegetarian meal as opposed to taking the lazy way with a plate of grilled/charred/boiled - vegetable(s). 

In retrospect, perhaps, I should've ordered the \"always vegetarian soup of the day,\" or the \"spicy green salad...\" Or, maybe I should've snacked on \"warm marinated olives, edamame or mixed nuts.\" On it's \"about\" page, Luma describes itself as \"a culinary tour of Toronto's diverse cultural neighbourhoods. Luma then describes it's menu as \"innovative...\" There's nothing innovative or diverse about charred broccoli, warm olives, edamame or mixed nuts. 

I came here as part of a group for a work function. I doubt I would return on my own. 

For vegetarians considering this restaurant, you may want to order lots of appetizers, the soup and ask for additions to your charred broccoli."}
{"text":"I came in here with a small group during Winterlicious and while most of the group went with the Winterlicious menu I opted to order off their regular menu (not that there was anything wrong with the winterlicious menu) but I saw a couple of things I found interesting in the menu I wanted to give a try. 

They have a small but exciting sounding  cocktail menu with many interesting sounding drinks and most of our group went for the same drink which was the Lazy Caprese which came garnished with 2 pieces of bocconcini and was spectacular. 

For my starter I went for the \"tongue and cheek\" appetizer which had spized raw beef and chicken liver parfait, cheese and \"wild Canadian flavours\" (could anything have been more open for interpretation?!), it's pictured above and it had an interesting dish presentation and ended up being very good, it's also perfect for sharing. 
My main was their lingcod dish (never heard of lingcod before) and our server (who by the way was very friendly) suggested that over whatever else I was pondering. And it really was very delicious even with a hint of lobster thrown in there. I was extremely satisfied and both those dishes cost me less than $40 (before tip and tax) which I would say is reasonable for a restaurant of this calibre. 

There was also a special event being held at the Lightbox that evening and Luma also had a visiting chef and they were preparing a dish that was identical to one that was served in a particular scene of this movie that was involved with the event. And as a result us diners had the option of ordering a very fancy sounding pancake type dish as an appetizer, I was very tempted but opted for my tongue and cheek instead. But that is a great example of how Luma benefits from being housed in Toronto's \"home for the movies\" and how us the patrons stand to benefit from this partnership. A big reason why I'm awarding Luma that 5 star rating. I will most definitely be doing repeat visits here with their regular menu changes which I've heard of."}
{"text":"My very first stop for Summerlicious 2013 -- not a bad start!  

I had the Albacore Tuna Sashimi for the appetizer, Arctic Char for the main, and a Creme Fraiche Parfait for dessert. Here's a brief overview: 

Sashimi: Tasted really fresh and it was well complemented by the thinly sliced cucumbers and melon; it was a refreshing way to start off the three course meal. 
Arctic Char: It was ok. The arctic char itself was cooked well; the fish was tender and the skin was light and crisp. Not a fan of the quinoa salad (I don't like the beady texture). 
Creme Fraiche Parfait: SO GOOD! It came with a generous amount of strawberries and lemon crumble. The parfait itself was light, tart, and fluffy. I can eat this dish ALL DAY. 

Price: 
$35 tax and tip not included
+ $10 for a \"mojito-inspired cocktail\" (nothing special, just a regular mojito) 

Service was great -- we had multiple waitresses and waiters serving us and they always seemed happy to serve us. They were quick, too. 

I would definitely come here again for their a la carte menu... when I have the money. Their regular prices are high, but you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Luma is located upstairs on the second floor of the TIFF light box. I came for a dinner with some friends to try their summerlicious menu. While the service was great and the atmosphere was perfect, the food was disappointing. I ordered steak frites off their regular menu. The steak was good, but their Parmesan fries was far too salty. Nonetheless, the seasoning on it was very tasty (could've used less salt though). I've tasted some of the items on their summerlicious menu from my friends' orders, and they were not appetizing. I would recommend ordering off their regular menu for summerlicious 2015."}
{"text":"Went here last night for Winterlicious with my boyfriend. The front desk was nice, they took our coats and led us into the dining room. We were seated at a table near the front.

My boyfriend and I ordered the potato leek soup and the shrimp cocktail salad for appetizers. The potato leek soup was the right temperature; not too hot and not too cold. It was really delicious! The salad was amazing as well, it was a good portion of greens, shrimp and sundried tomatoes with a tangy sauce. 

As for mains, we got the lamb ragu cavatelli and the welland county flat iron steak. The ragu was really tasty and the pasta was cooked to perfection. The steak was seared nicely while still being medium rare on the inside. The mushrooms, onions and especially the mashed squash (so delicious!) complimented the steak nicely. 

For dessert we ordered the cannoli and the date square. The cannoli was good, they filled it with goat cheese instead of ricotta cheese which gave it a more bitter and sour taste, which is not my preference. The date square was extremely delicious! It went so well with the accompanied vanilla ice cream, it reminded me of apple pie. 

The service was great, they checked up on us often and refilled our drinks whenever it seemed appropriate. The only negative I would have to say is the noise level. It was hard to hear my boyfriend at times with everyone else in the room talking.

Will visit again!"}
{"text":"LUMA is located in the TIFF building. The patio has gorgeous views of downtown Toronto. I would definitely recommend LUMA for the ambience and the view. 

The food is good (it is what you would expect from an O&B restaurant).  For appetizers, we tried the bison tartare and beet salad. Both of the appetizers were delicious. 

For the main courses, we tried a combination of different dishes: Roast Chicken, Scallops, Flat Iron Steak, Tagliatelle and Risotto. My favourite dish was the roast chicken. The scallops, iron steak and tagliatelle were fine. The risotto was a bit salty for my liking."}
{"text":"Ambiance/decor-5
Service-3
Food-4
Strikeouts-1/3

The one and only strikeout was the music. We came to Luma for the yearly \"evening at Iceland\" with the guest chefs cooking Icelandic dishes. This event comes with live music and group tables(randomly sat with a bunch of people). The problem is that we were situated right in from of the speakers and the guitarist, it was impossible to talk to anyone but the person next to us, making conversation difficult. There should not have been a table here, for this type of event. We did not have a choice of seating, it was already pre-arranged.

The decor was very modern with dim lightning as expected with an upscale location like Luma. My only gripe here is the Lightning as it's quite difficult to take good foodie picsXD

Can't say much about service since it was a pre set dinner for everyone. The problem here from a perfect rating is that our table was always served last and the advertised h'orderves were only a messily one helping of each type (2 types for the whole 45 minutes coming early).

Foodie time! It was a total of 4 main courses.
Icelandic Cod
Langoustine Risotto
Icelandic lamb
Icelandic Skyr

The cod wasn't anything special, but it was delicious and was very refreshing for a starter. It was a very good mixture of the seaweed salad and other cuisines mixed in with cod which is the Icelandic staple. 

The langoustine risotto was to die for!! Every bite of this dish was so rich with flavour. This was definitely the best dish I've had for risotto period. It felt like eating a buttered lobster to perfection but better!!

I'm not even going to say much about the lamb, it wasn't quite a lamb chop or lamb meat you would expect. It wasn't bad. It wasn't great.

The dessert was okay too. A sorbert and a cream cheese mousse. Definitely a very interesting combination. Left me wanting a bit more, second to the risotto. 

I'm not really a wine person, but even I could tell the wine pairings were below par.  

Overall, I enjoyed the food at night, mainly because the risotto shined like a dynamite. A special mention to their bread and butter which tasted like eating popcorn without the pop! I would probably go again next year with more people if possible. *drools*."}
{"text":"It used to be a great restaurant, but when I visited here again during Summerlicious, I was quite disappointed. The server constantly made mistakes, including serving wrong dishes, bringing main dishes before the starters and the soup was damn cold. However, I will still rate it as OK based on other tasty dishes."}
{"text":"We came to Luma for a Winterlicious lunch. I ordered the shrimp and avocado cocktail. For the main, I chose the roasted trout. I thought the centre was not warm enough. And for the dessert, I chose the apple fritter; it was okay. I took a bite of my friend's honey sponge coffee and it tasted better than mine. I don't think she would have switched with me. 

The ambiance was nice, reminds me of the Shangri la. Food was mediocre. But the service was good and fast."}
{"text":"As far as O&B restaurants go, this one by far exceeded my expectations.  I've had some lack lustre experiences with other restaurants of the chain, but Luma was the best in comparison. 

On the 2nd floor of the Bell Lightbox with a cinema theme throughout (it's a little gimmicky, and doesn't seem to add any value to the meal), the large windows of natural light facing the busy King Street made it seem like it was a private dining experience inside the busy cityscape. 

Food here is modestly priced and you get good value for your meal . Average was about $18-25, for a good portion main. We started with an appetizer of the lamb croquettes. It wasn't amazing, the breaded portion around the minced lamb fell off the meat and made it messy to eat - but it was very tasty!
Hubby got a calves liver, which was a very good sized portion served on the best mashed potatoes (with green garlic) that we've ever tasted. The liver was good - a little tough. 
I got the brasied BBQ beer rib. Fall off the bone, and tender. Good decent size as well - served with a coleslaw and roasted peaches and tasteless potato (needs more flavour!). Otherwise, I would recommend this too. 

For dessert, we got the Luma chocolate bar - must try! Peanutty ice cream a top a semi/melted chocolate bar covered in almonds. Very simple, but decadent at the same time. 

I would definitely come back to Luma and something I cannot really say about some of the other restaurants. I wish all of them can aspire to this."}
{"text":"I've been to Luma a few times now.  For dinner, for lunch and then for drinks.  The service is outstanding and pushes them into the 4 star category.  The front of the house staff is exceptionally friendly and accommodating.  For the dinner, we arrived early for our reservation so we headed into the lounge for drinks.  They were great about holding the table until we were ready rather than rushing us into the dining room when our time came up.  I tried the scallops which were perfectly seared.  Also the truffle fries were delicious.  During the lunch, I tried the cauliflower salad - so good (I need to find a recipe for this) and the duck confit sandwich - yummy and rich!  My friend tried the lamb ragu cavatelli - I'm not a fan of lamb, but she loved it.  The only thing that disappointed both of us was the dessert.  I had the cannolis - the shells were too thick and the entire pastry was dry, including the filling.  I also tried the date square - it was just fine.  Overall, I'm a fan."}
{"text":"This place is pricey, but it's well worth it. The tastes are exquisite and the wine was amazing. Even the bread to start was tasty, since they paired the butter with honey. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"good dishes but each could be improved. warm mushroom as appetizer was amazing. for main course I had duck breast as chef's special, they did not ask how well to be cooked and it came out really raw! hard to cut or chew. my friend had the piglet as main course. It smelled really good and the crispy taste was good, however, it tasted plain inside."}
{"text":"I wasn't hungry when I arrived, but I still had a great meal.

I came for a little meet-and-greet dinner with my wife's coworkers and their clients.  Since I had already topped myself off an hour earlier (Due to the 3 hour difference from California, I was starving by 5pm.), I came ready to drink.  

The ambience was quite lovely.  Modern lines and lots of slick, shiny things and mirrors.  Since it was a work event, I kicked back and enjoyed their wine list.  Taking advantage of the location, I worked over the Canadian pinot noirs off Niagara-by-the-Lake and found them surprisingly robust and comparable to our Santa Lucia Highlands.  My companions focused on their favorite treat, the Duckhorn cab sauvignon, which is a solid if routine choice for Bay Area locals.

I got the lightest entree they had, a grilled octopus.  It paired well with the pinot.  Between the six of us, we polished off 3 bottles and a round of cocktails.  I think the total with included gratuity came to about $1000 Canadian or a little over $700 US, a pretty good deal for a very cool hangout."}
{"text":"Went to Luma for summerlicious - and really wasn't disappointed! Sometimes I find with summerlicious the restaurants treat you poorer than if you were paying full price for the regular menu items. Not so here! The waitress really went out of her way to make sure we had a good meal (no shortage of bread! which was steaming hot BTW). The Asian pork salad appetizer was delicious and not too big. But the real star was the steak with mashed potatoes. Sounds pretty standard, but it was delicious! Dessert was also great - again not a huge portion - just enough.

Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I came here for winterlicious.  Service was great but the food was so so. I had the duck confit and it was pretty dry.  The appetizer and the dessert wasn't impressive either."}
{"text":"I came here when it was a regular summer evening - not during winterlicious or summerlicious. 

Super easy to find, located on the second floor of the TIFF Bell Box. You can easily walk up through the white staircase! Walking in, many people were dressed in business casual clothing - I felt a little under dressed in a cardigan and shorts. The ambiance is bright (large glass windows on one side) and beautifully decorated. We sat by the booths where one person gets to view the whole restaurant and the other person USUALLY doesn't. I love how they install a mirror behind the person at the booth, so both sides are able to enjoy the view of the restaurant.

Similar to all of the other O&B places, food was delicious - nothing to complain about. The price of this O&B is in the middle - not as expensive as Auberge Au Pommier or Canoe, but not like their O&B Canteen or Bannock, which are their more affordable options."}
{"text":"We went last night, our first impression was good. It was not busy and they were very helpful at providing and excellent table with a nice view. 
We started with the seasonal all vegetable soup and it was extraordinary, truly delicious. The bread was served with an amazing hand made curd cheese butter amazing and very unique. 
The entree my date and I ordered was the B.C Halibut after the initial dishes we expected much more. It was a very small piece of Halibut which was very good but 1/2 the size it should be this was served on a bed barley porridge with wild mushrooms and the Halibut was served topped with a poached egg and a garnish. The egg was a large as the piece of fish to illustrate how small the Halibut was. 
But the barley porridge filled most of the plate, the wild mushrooms were mush and the barley main flavour was salty. Worse still the meal kept repeating. 
The wine was 55$ for half bottle and was excellent. 
The cost with tax for two was 160$ Plus gratuity. (Service was very good) 
Except for the soup it was disappointing."}
{"text":"Delicious food from the winterlicious menu, prompt service despite being very busy. Good atmosphere and nice decor. Thoroughly enjoyed our dinner, no reservation required."}
{"text":"Made a yelp account to tell you all just how bad the food was at luma. 

All 8 of us eating different things from the summerlicous menu were completely dissatisfied with our meals. Bland tasting beef to over salty chicken, and mediocre chocolate whatever it was called for dessert. 

Avoid wasting ur summer at luma."}
{"text":"Luma was just meh.  The atmosphere was noisy and bustling. Our table had a chunk out of it where my plates went.  Service was generally good, although I had to ask twice to get another glass of wine.

The soup of the day was excellent based on my hubby's review - creamy onion. I had a fattoush salad - nothing special. Weird actually because it was barely dressed with anemic lettuce. The odd thing was the pickle slices on it which didn't match the rest of the dish. They seemed like store bought dills.

He had a pork dish and said it was just ok. I had a vegetarian rice/chickpea dish, and it tasted good, but again nothing to get excited about. 

The best part of the dinner was dessert. I had a cookie sampler which came with creme brulee.  The cookies were ok, the creme brulee delicious. Hubbie had a lemon dessert which was very delicious.  I would give the desserts 5 stars.

With drinks, it amounted to $165 for the meal. Given the food and the experience, we weren't impressed. I've had better meals for a third the price."}
{"text":"Came in during Summerlicious.

Very spacious, great location and really stylish contemporary decor.

Staff were friendly and attentive.

Overall, the food and drinks that we had were good - I didn't find it amazing, but it wasn't too bad either. My only complaint was ordering the cornmeal-crusted catfish. While the catfish was prepared really well, I wasn't too keen on the romaine and radish combination. I found the vegetables to be a little too bitter for my liking. Should've ordered the pork duo or jerk spiced AAA steak. The best course would have to be dessert - loved the cookies and cream panna cotta!"}
{"text":"I went here for brunch and had their Rueben sandwich which was incredibly greasy as they appeared to have buttered every side of the bread. The meat didn't seems as fresh as I'd expect for an $18 plate. We shared an tartare venison which was the highlight. Everyone else at my table had the eggs Benedict which everyone liked, but again, was on the greasy side. The restaurant looks amazing and the service was great. Won't return based on the food. There is better in the area for less."}
{"text":"Recently visited Luma with my partner for his birthday. I ended up ordering soup of the day which was roasted pepper soup and it was really good. My main dish was Roasted chicken and that was pretty good as well. However, my partners dishes were very disappointing. He ordered the Caesar salad and it had fish in it which totally ruined the dish. And his steak was way too chewy. Although the portions of the food were great, the food itself was not impressive. 

The place itself was somewhat nicely decorated and the view was not bad, but the food was very underwhelming. Will not revisit."}
{"text":"This place is really nice on the inside in terms of looks and has a nice view, especially if you're right beside the window, CN tower is literally beside you. 
The food was great, pricey but the portions are large (sometimes it feels like other pricey places have small portions). And the deserts were average. 
I got the beef cheek, which like the server said literally melts in your mouth. My gf got the duck which also tasted really good. 
For desert we got the sweets plate with several different sweets, which are not bad but not amazing... So just average.
Lost a star for because the service was a bit slow (the server was good) even though it wasn't packed. And the washrooms were kinda far (outside of the restaurant but on the same floor)"}
{"text":"Great spot for dinner date. We sat on the patio which is 1 story up from street level and it doesnt feel loud or crowded like most patios in the area. They also have specials on drinks from 4-9 which is nice. We shared the mushroom salad which was served in 2 separate dishes for us so that was a nice touch to split it. We had the flat iron steak and the chefs daily special which was a soft-shelled crab with some succotash-type side and yellow squash. Both dishes were delicious and very different. The soft shelled crab was very summery and fresh and light, and the flat iron steak was also delicious and served with potato and mushroom pave. Really good! We were too full for dessert... service was also very good and attentive. Its best to make a reservation if you want to dine inside as it was fully booked but the terrace patio is available for walk-ins."}
{"text":"I came by here on Valentines day for a friend's birthday party. She had it in a very nice private room off the to the side of the restaurant, it was so pretty. 

I want this to be 3.5...b.c my server was so pleasant the stars are for him. I wish I remembered his name!

I was the last one to arrive to the restaurant, everyone had already ordered...I wasn't too hungry so i decided to get their crab salad. The server told me it was filling, it was rich in flavour, bit it was't big. He was right....It was very tiny. It tasted good, but the taste kind of got a little redundant after a couple of bites. I  really didn't want to finish it, but this thing was a good $20+...for something the size of my palm. 

Anyways, my friend had ordered the steak and fries...he graciously shared his meal with me....except for the fact that he had ordered it well done, which I can't blame on anyone but him, it was good. Nothing spectacular...just good. 

Wine: I got their Riesling....really wish they had more of a wine selection, maybe it was because we were in a private room? I have no idea...but I don't think I got to see the full wine list. 

Anyways, service was A+...especially since it was valentines day, past 9 PM, I can imagine how a party of 20 can be for a server..yet, the server was so nice, so courteous, he was great.  

Overall, I would come here again out of curiosity of the rest of the menu, but not anytime soon."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night without reservations and was immediately seated! The restaurant is located on the second floor of the Tiff light box, and is absolutely beautiful. The five of us weren't too hungry so we primarily focused on the mains rather than apps and desserts. I had the piglet on mustard spaetzle, and it was ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. The portion size was huge, and the pork was perfectly cooked - crispy skin, perfectly rendered fat, and moist succulent meat. The spaetzle and apples were the perfect pairing. My friends were also all really happy with their meals too (the braised short ribs especially). I fund the service to be pleasant and attentive, and the price per main to be very reasonable.

My only negative was that they charged us $2.50 each for still water! Who does that?! Anyway, aside from this minor point it was an excellent meal and I would definitely return."}
{"text":"3.5 star rounded up to 4***

This is located @ TIFF on King St....came here with my bestie during sunmerlicious...to try it out and I hafta say I'm impressed with the service. The gal that served us was attentive, big smile on her face and checked upon us accordingly during the night. 

The food app as tossed octopus salad.. tasted delightful...the chicked peas with arugala was served beautifully...so yummy for my tummy.. 

Chicken supreme.. didn't  really know what was so supreme about it but it was slighty dry to my taste...with canned beans and bak choy and gailan...it was an a-ok... not like it wow'd me... 

I enjoyed the service and atmosphere quite a bit. Its
 casual and feels comfy to sit here and drink..

Chocolate parfait ...I'm ridiculously full to eat anymore ..my stomach is  screaming at me to stop but my mouth keeps going.. =p ...first bite was 3.5 than it just suddenly becomes oh so yummy... 

I can't help but to keep eating.. so fattening yet so delicious.. I'm in a dilemma... help me... 

Ok I'm gonna stop now.. get ur butt here and come eat!!"}
{"text":"Had their winterlicious menu and was thoroughly disappointed.  I know that a lot of restaurants tend not to bring their A-game on their winterlicious/summerlicious menus, but I expected a lot more from Luma, an O&B chain restaurant.

Here's my opinion on the food:

Appetizer: Chicken Confit Pate
The star of our entire meal.  I really enjoyed the flavours and the mushroom sauce was the perfect complement for the dish.  I only wished they gave more than 2 small croutons to eat the pate with.

Entree: Pork Loin
Three  word, \"dry and tough\".  It was not what I expected.  The dish just failed in all aspects.  The flavours were weak, the pork loin was cooked as though there was some fat on the meat to retain some moisture.  The fact that it was a lean cut, the final product was maybe 2 degrees away from being a hockey puck.  Sent it back and had it re-fired.  The second attempt was better but still lacked in flavour.  A big fail in my books

Dessert: Date Cake
Way too sweet.  The sponge cake soaked up a lot the dates sweetness that made the heavy handed helping of caramel sauce dumped on top overwhelming.  

Service
Excellent service.  The waitress was very engaging at the appropriate times and made us all feel very welcomed.

Final verdict
If this is how they execute their winterlicious menu, I have serious doubts their regular menu would be any better. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Looking for a cool place for some happy hour drinks, well Luma hits the spot!  The drinks are $6 (sangrias, manhattans and a few other of their specialties).  Located on the 2nd floor of the TIFF building the space is huge.  There are 2 more formal seating areas (we were told often they are booked for events) and in the middle of the 2 seating areas is the bar area with plenty of seats at the bar as well as along the window facing the street.  Drinking and people watching at it's finest!

The service is friendly, the atmosphere is of course upscale.  It doesn't get busy until after 5:30pm on weekdays so we had the whole place to ourselves for a bit (we got there at about 5pm).

My friend and I came here for drinks - we didn't have food here so can't comment on that, but from the drinks to the service to the atmosphere here I would definitely come back to check out the menu."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food, decor, service are all spot on. 
My husband got a Cornish hen dish with a side of truffle fries, and I got a duck carbonara. And a Caesar salad with puffed wild rice. The carbonara had duck prosciutto in it which I had never tried before, and it was quite good. Pasta was cooked very well and the egg made everything very smooth. The puffed wild rice in the Caesar salad added a nice smoky flavour and crunchy fun texture. The truffle fries were average - the truffle flavour was kind of there, not exactly strong.

Now the hen. This was the reason we returned to Luma - they make excellent chicken dishes. But one bite of the Cornish hen made us frantically reach for the water. It was SO salty, it felt like I had a mouthful of some chicken flavoured salt. We sent the dish back to the kitchen for the first time in our lives. TWO servers came and apologized, and a new dish came out, very nicely seasoned this time, piping hot and extremely soft and juicy. We were extremely satisfied with the prompt service and excellent food. We will return... again and again!"}
{"text":"Fantastic meal - the wait staff was superb - wine list was excellent.  Recommend the steak frites - and the Coppola Cabernet Sauvignon was perfectly matched."}
{"text":"One of the best winterlicious places (and restaurants) in general. It's classy enough to take a date to, but you can go wearing jeans and still feel super pampered. 

The atmosphere is very open concept and the windows face down on king street perfect for people watching. The decor is beautiful and the lights aren't too dim where you can actually see who you're having dinner with. 

I went for lunch with my boyfriend and it was one of the best. 
Apps: Shrimp cocktail was on point; it was a good serving and tasted amazing. 

Mains: Lamb Meatballs: absolutely loved it. It was filling and the sauce was so good I wanted to lick it all off the plate.

Dessert: Sorbet: not too sweet, and of course presented beautifully. 
Goat Cheese Pastry: this thing came from heaven. It was like sweet and savoury all in your mouth in the perfect combination and you couldn't get enough of it. 

To top it off, our server was wonderful, and drinks wonderful as well (the two things that REALLY matter right?) I would definitely come again on a non-winterlicious lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"I find O&B restaurants hit and miss. Love Jump. Oliver & Bonacini Cafe & Grill on Bayview  is a disaster. Oliver & Bonacini Café Grill  on Front is adequate. 

Luma lumps in with Jump. The decor isn't quite sexy like Jump or the Front street Café Grill . But it's second floor location offers a nice street view of the Entertainment district.

The food is quite excellent. My date, Madame Cheese, enjoyed her pasta. I had the steak frites. The fries were ample and tasty. The best I've tasted. The steak was quite nice, although I wish they trimmed some of the fat."}
{"text":"Overpriced. Good food, good view but very small portion and too expensive."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my family after my graduation.  I really wanted to sit on the patio, but unfortunately it was quite small so it had filled up quickly.  They sat us by the window to make up for the lack of space on the patio.  

The menu was small, but it was lunch time.  The reason I wanted to come here was because I saw a halibut dish I really wanted to try on the menu online.  Unfortunately I realized that I had looked at the dinner menu, so it was not there! :(  

Despite that, I really enjoyed my steak frites.  The steak was cooked beautifully and the parmigiana fries were incredibly tasty.  

I would recommend this place for anyone willing to spend a bit more, but enjoy some quality food.  I have always been a fan of Oliver & Bonacini's restaurants."}
{"text":"Been to Luma a few times before for Licious and their regular menu. Tried the following for lunch:

CAJUN-SPICED CHICKEN LIVER PARFAITgrilled corn, snow peas and carrot salad, orange tarragon dressing
BEEF BRISKET SANDWICHcrispy onion, cabbage slaw, L1 sauce, potato wedges
STONE FRUIT COBBLER (vegetarian/local)sour cream ice cream

The parfait was pretty good. Sandwich seemed more like a burger because of how big the bun was. Couldn't finish the cobbler because it was too sweet for my liking."}
{"text":"I have a huge weakness for GOOD gnocchi, and Luma's was fantastic! I also appreciated that they had multiple vegetarian options on their menu, and that their soup of the day is vegetarian everyday. They were also friendly and helpful to accommodate the dietary restrictions of my pregnant friend that dined with me."}
{"text":"I haven't eaten here, but this is one of my favourite places for happy hour drinks! Monday - Saturday, 4-9pm is their \"magic hour\", where they offer $6 martinis, manhattans, and grolsch lager pints. 

It's no bar chef, but it is has a great view overlooking King st, a nice and warm ambiance, pleasant service, and decent cocktails. There are only about 3 varieties of selection for the manhattans and the martinis, but they are different enough that you should be able to find one that you like. I don't think you can find a more convenient, nice, or reasonably priced place like this anywhere in Toronto, and if so - please let me know!!"}
{"text":"Came here for $23 lunch Summerlicious and this is what I ordered:

CHILLED GOLDEN TOMATO SOUP smashed avocado, sweet pepper relish
This was super spicy. I liked the tomatoes, they were sweet and balanced it out. Could not finish this.

VEGETABLE GUMBO warm cornbread
Mine tasted a little smoky, I think it might have been slightly burnt. Gumbo also on the spicy side. The cornbread was really sweet.

STONE FRUIT COBBLER vanilla ice cream
Pretty standard. Too much fruit. Ice cream portion is very tiny."}
{"text":"Went to three Summerlicious this year and this was my favorite of the three.  Our party size was 14 and we came for a 1pm Saturday lunch. Restaurant was about 30% full with lots of empty tables.  Staff were very friendly and accommodating.  They didn't auto charge us gratuity which is always appreciated.
For first course I got Grilled Octopus with broccoli, almond & focaccia salad, preserved lemon & harissa dressing.  It was a good appetizer with a decent amount of octopus in it.  The broccoli salad was good too and dressing went well with it.
For second course I got Charred Marinated Steak Salad.  The steak was full of flavours and nicely tender.  Didn't like that they precut the steak also the size of the steak was small.  The salad that came with the steak was average.  I was able to sample the Cornmeal Haddock and Grilled BBQ Spiced Chicken Thighs.  The Cornmeal Haddock had a nice crunch to it and the fish was seasoned well.  The Grilled BBQ Spiced Chicken Thighs was really moist and had lots of flavour.  I still prefer my steak salad more.
For dessert I got the Sauvagine which was disappointing.  Never had Sauvagine before and didn't like the texture or taste of the cheese.  Maybe if it came with crackers it may have been better.  The apricot and honey helped a bit in finishing the dessert.  I was able to sample the Strawberry Lemon Poppy Seed Cake and Cookies & Cream Panna Cotta.  Both were much better than mine.  I'd go with the Cookies & Cream Panna Cotta next time."}
{"text":"The atmosphere makes this place stand out! We opted to eat on the rooftop patio for an amazing view of the CN Tower and Downtown Toronto and the view was breathtaking. We ordered a bottle of Rosé under the Sommelier's Selection and it was tasty, not too sweet like most. I ordered the Roast Chicken paired with buttermilk potato purée and green bean slaw and it was great! I removed the bacon from the dish. 

The service was also outstanding! I'd definitely recommend this restaurant to a friend."}
{"text":"Our waiter was very friendly. Main course (rabbit gnocchi) was good. Dessert was excellent.  I would go back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Nice drink, servers very smelly. 

I did not want to comment because I feel embarrassed. 

Everything else nice."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the Luma spin on dining.  My major complaints are the wine list and service.  The wine list is lacking in selection.  There's a lot of Canadian wines, but I'm not into Canadian wines.  The selection beyond this is lacking severely.  We did find a nice French wine finally.  The service overall was decent.  They didn't finish strong however and we had to wait 20 minutes to get out of the restaurant.  Our group was very happy with the meal overall.  I had a steak and it was perfect.  I think if they improved a couple of minor things, this would be a great place."}
{"text":"I recently made a dinner reservation for large group for my birthday. It was a really nice experience for all of us, the atmosphere is sophisticated but cool. Our server was awesome, very attentive and informative. 

There is a prix-fixe menu that comes with an appetizer, entree and dessert. Most of us choice to order off the regular menu. We had a vegetarian friend and they were very accommodating towards her as well. 

I had the mussels for my appetizer and the duck carbonara with a side of truffle fries. 
The white wine mussels were delicious! Just the right amount of garlic and wine, and the mussels were plump and cooked to the perfect softness. The left over sauce was so good with the garlic bread they give you. 
The carbonara was a little disappointing because it was a little bland except for the bits of duck prosciutto giving it some flavour. I thought I would've especially liked the perciatelli pasta they used for it because I love the texture of thick pasta noodles, however it didn't really wow me. 

I also tried some of their braised beef cheek, which is one of the best dishes there in my opinion. The beef cheek was soft and tender, filled with juices and flavour. The burnt onion aioli sauce complimented the beef really well. 

Overall it was a great experience, awesome vibe and the food was delicious!"}
{"text":"I'm always nervous about eating in a touristy place from a corporate restaurant, and the TIFF Lightbox wit its Oliver and Bonacini Restaurant group meet that definition.  Thankfully my concerns were quickly allayed during my recent Winterlicious meal here.

--AMBIANCE: It's got the trendy aspect going (read lots of Edison bulbs) but also some nice natural woods and a warm feel to the decor.  Trendy, modern, yet comfortable.  I found the sound level to be perfect...just enough going on to feel like the neighbors aren't joining your conversation, but quiet enough that I can just say everything once (quite unlike talking to my Dad).

--FOOD: We had three courses here and thankfully we each chose different items and shared liberally.  The appetizers were truly enormous.  The celery root soup was rich and hearty, and a tad bit monotone.  The fregola salad was also quite solid, with a significant enhancement from a sous vide duck egg.  The highlight for me was the roast pork shoulder...after slowly braising for many hours, there was no need for a knife.  My trout was also quite delicious, even if I'm a bit of a wimp about eating the skin.  Dessert was also good.  

--SERVICE:  This was a star of the show, led by Nadia, our incredibly well-trained and friendly server.  When we had eaten half the salad wondering where the magical duck egg was, she quickly replaced the entire salad when we pointed out its absence.  She knew a lot about the dishes and gave honest opinions.  I think I could have pulled a Portlandia moment with her even.  Pacing was good, and all the other staff really were warm.  The only weird thing was the bread guy, who spoke in a whispery mumble...and that's being generous.

--OVERALL, this restaurant has brought out its A game for Winterlicious.  I've been burned in the past with places throwing out cheap cuts of meat poorly cooked for a rushed service, but they clearly were cooking their prix fixe menus with care and treating their customers like they wanted repeat business.  I think they'll get it from me.

It's not cheap...but it was good value."}
{"text":"One of the best Winterlicious lunches of 2015!
A very open and airy atmosphere which was very welcoming. 
I ordered the apple spiced cocktail which was a little strange a quite strong on the cinnamon...didn't turn out to be my thing, but the food which came later made up for it.
The shrimp cocktail salad featured a generous portion. Mind you, there was nothing too over the top or spectacular about it, but the simplicity in the dish is what made it stand out. Larger shrimp nestled in the fresh watercress was a nice light start to the meal.
The lamb ragu cavatelli main course was exceptional. Not too heavy on the sauce or cheese, but just the right amount to bring out the flavour. Was very happy and satisfied. I must also add that my partner's duck confit & pistachio butter sandwich was outstanding. Again a very nicely cooked meat between the toasted and crunch bread made for a good lunch.
The date square for dessert was a bit on the heavier side, often leaving me thirsty. Nevertheless I do give it a 4/5 for a good flavour and the ice cream. Would have preferred some type of sauce to complement the dryness of the square.

Overall a great lunch for $23."}
{"text":"My friends and I went to LUMA for their \"Creature Comforts\" special that was related to the Tim Burton exhibit. Sadly, they didn't have it for lunch (apparently there was a mix-up ) - the Creature Comforts food specials were only on from Monday to Friday; and on the weekends - there's only brunch in the morning and the special starts at 5.  

Nevertheless, we stayed there to eat.  

The ambiance was nice and quiet - there wasn't too many people.  We had brunch there (I ordered the eggs benedict, which was on the croissant instead).  Absolutely delicious.  Definite recommend for brunch.

I must say, service was AMAZING!  We had the nicest waiter ever and he joked around with us the whole time.  Definitely will be going back some time soon."}
{"text":"Haven't had a bad meal here yet.

The food is excellent and the service it great.

I'm usually a sucker for the beef brisket burger at lunch or the steak frites. The fries are really tasty and rich."}
{"text":"Great food, fantastic service.
We were a group of 10 and we had several apps...the nuts, olives and edamame. The edamame was seasoned so wonderfully.
The mushroom salad was fantastic and the gnocchi just melted in your mouth. The others loved the steak tartare.
I had the cauliflower dish made dairy free for my main. It was amazing. The others had the tuna, lamb or fish. The halibut came out too dry but the chef/server happily exchanged it and everyone was happy with their meals. We had the dessert platters and the server kindly brought my sorbet (vegan).
The restaurant is clean and spacious and the individual washrooms were nice."}
{"text":"Loved the lemon grass chicken with Vietnamese noodle slaw. The Tiramisu desert somehow was a let down"}
{"text":"The review rating is mostly for the food.  The service -- well - I'll get to that in a minute.

This is O+B's newest addition in the Bell Lightbox building.

Nice layout and ambiance.

The menu had great choices and the food was great, but the service and some aspects of it were \"off\". There were periods when we were looking around for our server and they could not be found.  Matter of fact we waited quite some time to ask for the check.  It was not that busy either, so we found this fascinating.

Also, when they brought the food to the table - the person who brought the food (who btw was not the same as the wait person), proceeded to describe the meal -- uh - yeah -- I picked it off the menu based on the description -- I think I get what I am eating.  This was pretentious.  O+B if you are reading this - drop this practice.  If you are dealing with people that know food -- it is more than a little annoying.  Have your staff spend their time instead paying more attention to their diners more frequently.

Anyways, the food was marvellous and we'll probably be back, but their is definitely some fine-tuning that needs to be done on the serving side.

Enjoy!
PS - the picture I chose as my first photo was the dessert I had (Opera Cake)-- but I thought my hubby's dessert was much better (Chocolate ?)"}
{"text":"Service at Luma is consistently amazing. Attentive, accommodating and happy serving staff really make coming here a great experience. 

The food is also incredible. The salads can be a bit hit or miss, but the rest is always spot on. Had an amazing charred octopus app and tuna steak entrée last night. Pricing is about right, too. 

Gotta love the location! Right inside the TIFF lightbox. For all these reasons and more, Luma makes it to my list of favourites."}
{"text":"It was the last day of the Winterlicious menu and I saw a sign for $20 lunch. Since they're a part of the Oliver & bonacini group, i figured that the standard should be up to par. And I wasn't wrong! We came really late in the after noon ... but still weren't the only people in the joint. 

Food wise? Started with a seared tuna type of appy ... amazing. Partly because i love seared/raw anything. It was great. My main was the potato leek lasagna. A little portion? but just about right because the cheese was so rich. He had the chicken and it was yummy! Dessert was awesome too ... a little cup of buttermilk or something and a bread pudding with little crystalized sugars that pop in your mouth!

3 course meal ... a drink ... tax and tip? Comes to just under $40 per person which is a steal for the quality. Of course, this isnt' a regular thing so make sure you come next time!"}
{"text":"Like others, I really want to love Luma; however, the wide range of reviews here serve to reinforce the inconsistency I've experienced at this restaurant.

Stopping by for a late brunch for two, my gf and I had a great time. Quick efficient service, and a great meal (eggs benny and the croque madame). Though I would have liked some supporting players on the plate (no fruit or potatoes), the fries are great and easy to share.

The space itself is gorgeous, large and airy, and if we could rent it out as a wedding venue we would.

Buoyed by this experience, I thought it an easy choice to bring my family here for a Sunday brunch. Many of them hadn't seen the Lightbox, and I knew this place had large tables to accommodate our party. Unfortunately, we left underwhelmed. 

While our server was an absolute gem, the food was coming out at a glacial pace. I'm certainly respectful that for a table of 10 we should expect a bit of a delay, but the restaurant was half-full and other tables were getting equally shoddy treatment. Two people ordered tea at my table, only to be informed later they were out of tea pots. When tea pots became available, they had run out of green tea (and this was early in their brunch service).

After waiting an hour without any food, I asked the manager as to the cause of the delay. Rather than man up and apologize, he felt his energy was better spent investigating when our order had been punched in, and proceeded to explain that it hadn't been that long. First, what the hell? We had been sitting for an hour with nary a breadcrumb. Second, our server (awesome as she was), was clearly stretched thin. Did it not occur to this man that it hadn't been that long since we ordered (in his opinion), because it took forever to place our order? This fellow could have done much better to assuage our issues; he did not.

Graciously, they comped our drinks (coffee/tea is $3.50 each), and thankfully, the food was still good (though I wonder if this is because we were all starving by the time we got it).

A recent interview with Michael Bonacini reveals that he's disappointed with the performance of Luma (http://www.thestar.com/living/food/article/971982--their-gamble-grew-into-an-empire). With the inconsistency I've observed, I am not surprised.

Note: there's parking underneath the Lightbox - flat rate $5 on Sundays."}
{"text":"Located at the TIFF Bell Lightbox, this restaurant was fantastic and as romantic as it gets.  

First impression was that the decor was elegant, and the service was excellent.  The wait staff was extremely polite, friendly, and attentive, couldn't ask for more.  The atmosphere was pleasant (not too loud, even on a Saturday evening).  They have free coat check at the front.

The menu had a nice movie credits theme to it (fitting since it's located at TIFF).

We ordered the appetizer (octopus) and a main dish of steak.  Was pleasantly surprised that they asked if we would like to share it, then brought us the dishes split into two equal portions each.  Both were great, but I did not finish my octopus as it was too difficult to rip apart for me (more difficult for me to eat than squid).  Still it was an interesting dish to try.

Overall, a great place to bring your date."}
{"text":"- Ambiance (5/5)
Upscale, chic.  Nice white Christmas tree in the center made the whole atmosphere very festive!

- Service (4/5)
Great, professional, informative service.  A little slow to refill water, so I thought that was slightly inattentive, but overall great experience.

- Bread (3/5)
The bread itself is kind of ordinary, but they served it with a scrumptious pumpkin puree!!

- Pumpkin Pie Cocktail, $10 (4/5)
Seasonal cocktail using Maker's Mark bourbon, maple syrup, orange bitters, and pumpkin puree.  Great cocktail!

- Roasted Cauliflower Soup, $9 (4/5)
Very velvety texture.  You can definitely taste the roasted cauliflower in there.  Personally, I could've used a slight kick to it, but it was very good/

- Braised Short Rib, $20 (3/5)
This is the one component that wasn't as refined.  Served in a sauce that was a little bit too salty, the short rib also was short of super tender.  It was just ok.

- Value (5/5)
Given what I ordered, I think the value here is superb.  Creative, contemporary dining without breaking the bank is always a winner in my book.

- Final Word
If not for the beef short rib, this would've garnered some consideration for a 5.  As it is, it's already a great experience, and I would happily return."}
{"text":"Did not seam as though the food was thoughtfully prepared. Very bland, they were not very adventurous with flavors of any kind. We did how ever enjoy the ahi tuna but overall the meal was overpriced and not worth exploring"}
{"text":"One of the O&B chain restaurants, this restaurant is located above TIFF.  We came here for Mother's Day brunch because we thought it'd be nice to extend our palates beyond Canoe and O&B so we decided to try here.  

Food was mediocre at best.  We ordered a burger and fries as well as belgian waffles.  The waffles were something I could have put together at home and not worth the $15 or whatever they were.  The fries lacked any sort of fried texture and were quite mushy. 

To top that, service was actually quite slow and it took forever for us to get any water refills or have anyone even come to take our order.  Our server even forgot to give us stir spoons for our teas.  Overall, it was a less than optimal experience and we will not be coming back. :("}
{"text":"I was here for a birthday celebration. The service was excellent, right from being led to the table, jackets taken up till we had our last bite of desert. Really friendly and efficient wait staff. 

For food, the appetizer was quite disappointing - ordered the ceviche, and I definitely did not get the hit of lime/cilantro or juices with the seafood I was craving. I was a very very tiny portion (2 bites!) and dry fish, with some proscuitto or bacon. Not recommended for a $15 cost! 

What saved the night was the steak frites, done to perfection with excellent frites. The meat was so tender and moist. Dessert was also excellent and came complete with a happy birthday message and candle (who doesn't love to blow out a candle :-)

We also had some martinis which were very tasty too. Overall, this restaurant feels modern, airy and cozy at the same time. You get to see the action on King street and feel the ambience in the room with the great lighting. Definitely has an older crowd (probably due to prices) but if you are younger, and have special celebration, they know how to make you feel special. Thanks Luma!"}
{"text":"This is the kind of place where after spending $50 on a meal for 1 person you are still hungry and wanting to grab a burger after. The food was ok nothing amazing by any stretch of the imagination."}
{"text":"Cant say we'll be coming back. First impression was great tho because one of the chefs gave my baby boy a free appetizer. And then he said he felt bad so he made a bigger appy for everyone to share for free too!! It was actually really yummy & off the menu. Can't say the food was bad. It was actually done quite well.  They definitely try to go for the unique factor with their upscale dishes like foie gras (did i even spell that right?) and tongue.  I was a little weirded out by some of the appetizers' ingredients but maybe i'm just not that big on eating flower petals.  

Their dessert menu was a major fail. Their selection of dessert wine & tea was bigger than the actual desserts. I ordered a cake & it was maybe 2 bites with a side of popcorn icecream & some caramel popcorn?!? Okay...guess trying to be different means serving you up some cheesy dessert too...at $10 a pop!!

Take note though, pop refills are not included so u will be charged the $3.50 for another pop (which may take up to an hour to get.) The glass is tiny & it's half ice!!! What the heck!?  Ya this place is pretty pricy for what you get serving wise.  Their whipped potatoes are really good & probably memorable.  Our server was not the brightest. She was quite clumsy & dropped a knife & fork...almost on my baby's head!!!  Not impressed with that!  And it shouldn't take her an hour to get another drink order in & a little checking up on our table more than once per hour would be nice.  

The atmosphere is cool & it's a beautiful restaurant.  I only give it 3 stars because for the price, the food & the definitely the service (maybe just from our server) wasn't up to par.  I give them props for serving us a free appetizer just for my baby though. That's very sweet & definitely gave an awesome first impression in my eyes.

Oh, and make sure u really lock the washroom door!!  It was stuck in between a full turn & i thought it was okay.  Was just about to unbutton my jeans & an old man walked in!! OMG!! The washrooms are private but unisex so u have to make sure the deadbolt turns completely!!  How embarrassing...but hey, it could've been worse & he could've walked in on me mid stream...LOL!!!

Not coming back tho...there's just way too many other restos across the street that would probably be better & at half the cost."}
{"text":"I came here for a celebration. The customer service was really good. Did the $38 summerlicous menu which is 3 courses, you choose app, main, dessert. It was ample of food, was very full after. The taste of the food was good. The only thing I didn't like was my seared tuna entree. I think I might have gotten a bad batch, it was over seared and end pieces. I think it could have tasted better.

However, I loved the ambiance. Perfect place for catching up with friends or even a business meeting."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends for birthday celebrations.  It was surprising they were able to fit so many of us seeing that it is a more upscale O&B resto that's also quite busy.

The prix fixe is $40 that includes an app with a main - which seems like a pretty good deal except I wanted to try the braised rabbit cavetelli which wasn't on the menu.

I had the much raved Pear's Prince and was extremely disappointed.  The alcohol taste was too strong for my liking and I had more fun munching on the lone slice of pear than drinking the actual bourbon.  

Braised rabbit cavetelli - the swiss chard was perfect.  The entire dish was seasoned well except there was way too much green visually.  You eat with your eyes and I hope the chefs of Luma step it out with the plating of this dish and add some non-grassy colours so I don't feel like a rabbit eating this.. however, still enjoyed it and was quite satisfied after.

Friends all had a great time at this resto, service was great - would be back.  Perhaps after a viewing at TIFF :)"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner on a weeknight. They open at 5pm, but my friend and I arrived just before 5 and they hadn't quite opened yet. The hostess was really nice and let us sit at the bar and look at the menu while we waited for our table. You can also order food and sit at the bar/lounge area, but we decided to sit in the dining room -- which is beautiful, by the way. 

Right now, they have some Tim Burton inspired additions to the menu -- \"Creature Comforts\". There was a 2 course prix fixe ($25 for soup or salad + entree). My friend has the soup of the day (Lobster bisque) and the \"Big Fish\" aka seared tuna on a bed of vegetables and chickpeas. I went for the roasted cod from the regular menu, which was amazing. Perfect texture, served over wild mushrooms (with some kind of mushroom foam -- first time I've had a main course with foam... it was actually so tasty and an interesting mix of textures), sweetbreads, celery and porcini cream. There were also some pieces of chicken -- I thought it was weird that they didn't mention that in the menu description, but anyways, it was tasty. For dessert, I just had to get the \"Willy Wonka\" -- dark valrhona chocolate delice with a small piece of caramelized banana, a dollop of peanut butter ice cream, and cocoa nib crisp. Bonus points for stunning presentation (gah! I didn't bring my camera!). 

We both tried cocktails from the Tim Burton menu. I had the Alice in Wonderland inspired \"Drink Me\" -- wiser's and ginger-pear juice. Yum! My friend had the \"Sweetie Todd\" - absolut rasberri, white cranberry juice, lemon, and bits of crushed raspberries. 

So, the food offerings were excellent and went beyond expectations, but this place gets 5 stars because the service was also impeccable. Our server was really professional yet warm and personable, and very attentive without being intrusive. She gave suggestions without seeming pushy, and never hurried us, even though it took us a really long time to decide what to order. She also had all the specials memorized and recited them like poetry. When she set our dishes on the table, she stated/pointed out what the different components were (okay, not always necessary... uhh yeah I can SEE that is the ice cream). It's really an atmosphere where the servers seem to actually care about the food and your enjoyment of it. 

The space is perfect for an intimate dinner, special occasion, or a date. Not too noisy (actually, come to think of it, I can't even remember if they were playing music at all?), not too bright nor too dark, tables spaced out enough, elegant, simple decor, and floor to ceiling windows with a nice view of King St. W. 

Oh and the far bathroom (there are 3 gender-neutral private bathrooms) is bigger than some downtown bachelor apartments. 

Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We went to Luma for Summerlisious dinner.  Warm bread with hummus   Was a good start. Octopus salad was professionally  made and the best I had. Short rib was just yummy. Wine paring was lovely. The desert though was just fell a bit short of  just being ok. The atmosphere was abut like hotels restaurant and I am not personally fan of those"}
{"text":"Engaged in their WinterLicious menu based on the hotel concierge recommendation. Luma knows how to deliver the service, atmosphere and cuisine! My meal consisted of sweetbreads (trying them for the first time), braised short rib and a cinnamon pavlova for dessert. Each course was perfectly paced, well executed.

Sweetbreads were delicately fried. They were described as an 'exceptional chicken nugget' which got my attention but you wanna know something? They tasted as described! The short rib was fork tender and the pavlova was generous and sweet as only meringue can be.

An exceptional evening with hat tip to Danielle for the excellent service!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like Luma. I may need to go again for dinner to give this a fair chance as I've only had brunch there and only one dish, but based on my experience I would have to give it a 2/5.

Pros - beautiful space and plating and good service. Waitress was very discreet but our coffees and water glasses were always refilled.

Cons - I can't say I enjoyed my eggs benedict at all. The sauce had a very sharp lemon taste, and when combined with the saltiness of the ham, it was actually hard to eat. This is a tough feat as I actually LOVE eggs benedict, even cheap versions so for me to not like it, it's actually a pretty big deal. I had a bite of my friend's steak and eggs, and while the steak was well prepared - it was tender and perfectly cooked; the meat itself was kind of bland. Kind of like a hamburger. At $10 maybe this would've been ok, but at $21, we expected a bit more.  The \"fries\" that came with it were really thin and crispy and tasted like hickory sticks. Again that was good, but i would've preferred meatier fries."}
{"text":"This place disapointed me! I am not gonna ever again spend 150 dollars for  nothing! 
Food  is really so so or even worse , the prices are too too high for such place. They pretend to be fancy and classy place but the service and food are not at appropriate level!! Girl waitress was not too polite, looked like she gives me a favor serving me. We ordered lobster salad but ooopss there was no lobster in it..... 
so to tell you the truth i do not recomment this place and i have seen too many places that cost less and food much better and service much better. 
guys lets me fair - if you charge like this so make good food and good service!!!!
xoxoxo"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant inside..and happy hour every day(weekdays) after 4 for Manhattan's..but the bar get pretty noisy, even there is no music playing at the bar area"}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for weekday happy hour drinks. The location is convenient and the price for the happy hour martini is just unbeatable at 6 dollars. Instead of martini, you can also get pint of grolsch beer. It's a very fine line of print on the menu, so I bet most people miss this option!

There's a list of specialty drinks that are $10 during happy hour. If you are looking for bang for your buck, that's a good deal for 5 ounce of alcohol!

The large glass window view is very relaxing, and definitely set the stage for any summer or winter casual get together. It's the first time at luma for the girls I came with, and it had immediately became their top choice for happy hours as well!"}
{"text":"If I had reviewed this restaurant after my first visit about a year ago I probably would have given it 5 stars. I had a wonderful meal with my bf and my mom and her husband. I had tuna tartare which was delicious and a lobster risotto that I absolutely loved. 

Unfortunately my second trip was not as wonderful. I still love the space, its warm an inviting despite being a very large restaurant with a lot of tables and high ceilings. The view of downtown is spectacular and the wall to ceiling windows are beautiful - note, I was chilly the first time I sat by the windows. 

We made a last minute (day before) New Year's Eve reservation as I guessed such a big space was likely to have a table left and they did. It wasn't even that busy when we were there although we had a 9:30pm reservation so perhaps we missed the rush. I didn't mind, we had good attention from our server and wine guide. 

First, the drinks. They made a good martini - our favourite is a dirty, dry martini and they didn't disappoint although the olives were a bit dry - old? The wine however was WONDERFUL - a Niagara-on-the-lake winery that my bf and I have been to before so have a special place in our hearts for it - Lailey - Pinot Noir - 2009 I think? It was delicious. 

The food...there was a prefixe that didn't interest either of us so we ordered a la carte. I had the tuna tartare again - it was good, not amazing, I think it was better the first time. We shared the scallop sashimi which was the best thing we ate for sure. It was delicious with a touch of radish and greens which was amazing. My bf had the octopus - not something this vegetarian (obvious occasional fish eater - usually went at a restaurant) eats and my bf said it was overcooked on the outside pieces and he didn't love it. 

Our mains were a lingcod for me (I asked the waiter who knew I wasn't a meat eater and was iffy on fish whether the lingcod or yellowfish tuna was better and he said the lingcod) and scallops with beluga lentils for my bf. Mine came out - GASP - with a whack of prosciutto on and around the fish!!!! You would think that's something you'd mention in the description of a fish dish...it wasn't - nor did my server tell me which was odd and he even seemed surprised when I told him we sent it back. The good news is they did bring me a fresh one (not just the previous one with the prosciutto removed) - the server said he grabbed it before it got to that stage - and the dish was pretty fantastic. A creamy sauce with good vegetables and a perfectly cooked piece of whitefish. I was pleased at the end. My bf was not as thrilled with his scallops. He didn't like the beluga lentils which pretty much ruined the dish for him. He should have had a steak...

We didn't stay for dessert this time and were only mostly happy with our meal. I had been really looking forward to going back there and making it one of my favourite Toronto restaurants but was disappointed. We are hard to please, but not that hard. Don't put ham on my lingcod...or at least let me know its coming ;-)

I'd be willing to give it another try sometime - perhaps it was the New Year's menu that threw them off - by the way the lobster risotto I loved so much last time was not offered - so perhaps it will be back if I am."}
{"text":"Been here for summerlicious and the food was ok. Service and atmosphere is great though. Don't think I will be coming back here any time soon though."}
{"text":"I'd been wanting to try Luma for awhile after going to Canteen a few times.

Went around 2pm on a weekday, wasn't busy at all. Manager sat us down, waiter took our drink orders. When we were ready to order, the waiter never even bothered to look in our direction and disappeared. After about 5-10 minutes, I got fed up and I had to physically get up and complain to the manager, who was actually very nice and took down our orders himself.

We each got lobster salads and shared a plate of pierogies, both of which were absolutely delicious. We got the maple cake and lemon cake desserts, which were pretty good.

I think I'll be sticking to Canteen for the better service."}
{"text":"I'm torn about this place. I went here three times over the course of TIFF and had really different experiences each time. My overall feeling is that the service and the food is hit or miss, which for the price point is unacceptable. Can you please get whomever trains the staff at Canoe to whip this place into shape? That being said, it is fun to sit at a window seat at the bar and watch all the people milling about below. So the view isn't as pretty as Canoe but it is interesting.

Visit one (At the bar for a quick dinner): Waiter was great until it started to get busy and I was trying to get my check then he forgot about me. Sliders were delicious and the Chunking Express was tasty. 4 stars - 5 food/3 service.

Visit two (At the bar trying to grab a quick breakfast between screenings): I waited forever before one of the two people working behind the bar acknowledged me. By that time I opted for a pastry to go since I didn't want to deal with them anymore. I think the girl who was going back and forth to the kitchen/storeroom restocking things assumed the guy had helped me already but he was busy talking and didn't acknowledge me until the girl had already started helping me. If it wasn't for the girl I would have walked out. The croissant was delicious.  2 stars - 4 food/3 service (female) 1 (male).

Visit three (in the restaurant for lunch): The hostess made me feel like a piraña for being a solo diner at lunch during TIFF... I know I am not the only person who was eating by themselves all week... deal with it. But the waitress was awesome. Super friendly and nice. And when they didn't have a tea I liked (can't drink green teas and hate engilsh breakfast) she didn't flinch when I asked for hot water with lemon. Too bad the shrimp and lobster burger didn't live up to my expectations. After eating at Canoe (another Oliver Bonacini restaurant) the night before I was expecting fireworks on a plate, but the burger was just meh. I think it could have used a little more salt and maybe a little bit of spiciness. 4 stars - 3 food/4 service (waitress) 2 (hostess)."}
{"text":"This was my second time going to Luma and both experiences were great.  This visit was during winterlicious 2014.
Was initially disappointed that we were seated in the outer lounge area for dinner but was quickly turned around by friendly and professional staff.  Though I quickly made my choices (celery soup/trout/banana pudding), my date opted to have our server pick their menu.  She always does this and always ends up with fantastic meals, I should be less stubborn and do the same.  She ended up with the bean salad, pork and banana pudding as well.  
Everything was perfectly cooked and delicious.  They also offered wine and beer pairings for each item, the wine being available in both 3 and 6oz glasses.  
Will definitely be back, even if I have to sit in the lounge every time."}
{"text":"Their Magic Hour special can't be beat. Strong, tasty cocktails for $6 between 4p-9p.

Another consistency after many visits is the staff almost completely ignore you. Be prepared to wait up to half an hour for a server, or stand at the bar for 5 minutes until someone notices you."}
{"text":"About a 4. I thought the service was 5/5, food prob. 3.5/5. 

As noted by some, the restaurant was on the 2nd floor of TIFF. Parking on weekends wasn't bad at all... for $5 (entrance to the west of the TIFF building). The restaurant wasn't too busy and when we got there, we got to experience their A+ service, from hanging our coats, greeting & seating us right away. They made sure everything was always \"to our liking\". 

We had...

WILD SOCKEYE SALMON - butternut squash, brussels sprouts, beets and sea buckthorn
STEAK FRITES 8oz flat iron, five onion gravy, northern woods mushrooms and truffle parmesan fries

The Salmon was cooked to perfection. I liked how the outside was nice and crunchy but inside was just perfect and moist. Didn't look like they seasoned it very much. The veggies blended very well with it. 

Steak Frites was nice! Hubby found the medium rare a little too rare (imho it was perfect). The waitress was very nice and offered (a few times) to have to bring it back to the kitchen & have it cooked a little longer. When they brought it back out again, we ended up getting a whole new dish (with more fries). All nice and hot again :D The fries were awesome... but imho a little too much salt. But it was crazy good... likely my fav fries after McD's.

Ambience and decor was very nice, chic and modern. Prices are high for me...but typical for downtown Toronto."}
{"text":"The Yelpers below summed up pretty well what I thought of the rabbit cavetelli. It didn't wow me and I dont love it but I dont hate it. Just okay/decent.. Especially for the price of $26. i probably would order something else next time.

But 4 stars cause I love the environment and service. I came with a group of approx 15 people. Luma is great for groups and events - the environment isn't quiet or just for couples etc, so it's very comfortable to have a great conversation. Ambience is lively while being classy. 

Also props to the service! We accidentally underooked our reservation and the waitresses were so kind to accommodate. We requested to squish in more people at our already quite large table (sitting 2 people at each ends of the table that should fit 1) At other nice restaurants, it may be frowned upon and waiters may not be as nice, but Luma was lovely!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has great food.  It's well decorated and if you are lucky enough to get a window seat you get to face the CN tower and people watch.  The food is delicious.  Service can be slow though depending on who you get as a server.  Overall great atmosphere and a nice place to eat prior to seeing a show."}
{"text":"We were in Toronto for TIFF in September. People in the industry recommended this place to try. While having a super busy schedule there, we finally got to come here for lunch. The decor was pretty but since the weather was very nice, we decided to take a patio table. 

We had Lychee Gimlet, Mango margarita, and Olive and Cheese Plate. The drinks were very delicious. Very flavored and tasty. Olives were great as well but some of them were unpitted. We also had fun to watch people from the second floor patio. The service was great! It was a quick lunch but it was all good."}
{"text":"400th review in a year and four months! This post is dedicated to my birthday dinner, which happened in November (it's been a busy fall, ok?!). 

VIBE 
Luma was my birthday dinner, so you know it's a big freaking deal! Note: if you want the movie-menu themed birthday dinner you have to call their events department. I did not know this so was a bit frowny face at my lack of knowledge. Chef Jason Bangerter more than made up for this. Service was swift and friendly. (It was a Friday night.) The bar is luminous as well. A great spot to hang out pre or post movie/exhibit if you can't cough up the coin for the meal. We got a corner booth. It was cozy. 

WE ATE/DRANK 
We got a little bit spoiled. The burrata was light and refreshing with the accompaniment of Cantrell, melon and watermelon. We then moved onto a medley of beets accompanied by a tzatziki-like sauce punctuated with dill. Again, amazing! That said, this meal was in November so these items might not be on the menu because of seasonality. 

Because it was my birthday, I was allowed to ask for something off the menu. So I asked for a side of cabonara (one of my favourite things in the world). Bangerter came out with a huge bowl of cabonara with truffles and shaved 100% rare buffalo milk parmesean over the dish. It was so good we couldn't speak. Despite being a busy chef that manages two restaurants, he came over and had a glass of champagne with us. Honestly, it's one of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me. I can't guarantee this will happen with everyone but it was nice to have talked to him on twitter and then meet him in person. 

The other thing that Luma does is adjust portion sizes depending on your level of food coma. I enjoyed a half portion of the Halibut (not currently on the menu). It was light and flaky, accompanied by lentils. Friends enjoyed tuna and calf's liver (currently on the menu) and said they were both ace. 

We finished off with Luma's chocolate bar, which was more like a brownie topped with a variety of nuts and peanut butter ice cream. Bangerter came out with a birthday candle and lit it with a blow torch. That's my kind of celebration. 

We drank champers throughout the meal. Unforgettable! 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Luma lights up my gastronomic dreams! One of the most memorable meals I've had ever. At the end of the night,  I ate the leftover cabonara in the cab with my bare hands, it was that good. I'm older but I still have no shame."}
{"text":"The 5 of us met at Luma on Friday for summerlicious at about 4:40pm for a 5:30 reservation. Seatings don't start until 5pm so we had a drink at the bar first. Great service and comfy couches by the window. I had a glass of champagne ($21) while the rest of the gals had a negroni aranciata ($11), a bubbly basil ($12) a green tea mojito ($10) and a dillon's dream ($12). Great cocktails! 

We decided to move to our table at 6pm. It was really nice not to be rushed. Our server Steven was fantastic! Friendly, knowledgeable and a lot of fun. We ordered old fashions...highly recommend it! I decided not to go with the summerlicious menu as I really wanted to try the braised rabbit that came with gnocchi ($26). The zucchini, peas, and asparagus were cooked perfectly and the kale pesto was delicious. Highly recommend. 

Back to the summerlicious menu... A few of the gals ordered the octopus salad and the verdict was a 3/5. The short ribs was a sizeable portion and very tender from what I tasted. The chocolate parfait sundae was the hit of the summerlicious menu. We also tried the Stilton which was tasty but would recommend the chocolate :)

The truffle Parmesan fries are a must try at $8 and Steven was good enough to split that between the 5 of us on our bills. The scallops were also tasty and cooked very well. 

Great service, atmosphere and food but would go for the regular menu...

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great space. Fantastic service. The food tries to be a little too avant garde and fails at just being good. My review is based off of the Summerlicious menu where I had the cucumber/coconut soup, which tastes like a spa facial mask; the seared albacore tuna --which was very fishy and not sashimi grade. However the incredible staff were intent on pleasing me and switched out both my appetizer (for the much better soba salad) and the tuna (for the amazing fried chicken.) Disappointed for my first visit but I would try it again on a regular menu."}
{"text":"Me and a few friends went to try out the menu during the Icelandic event. For a set price we were given a 4 course menu. If I had to describe in one word the taste of all the dishes it would have to be 'Rich'. From the started to the dessert, all had this rich taste to it. It would've been great if there was something lighter in taste that came along just  to balance it out. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious and was filling.

If I had to rank the meals it would have to be 1) Risotto 2) Seaweed salad 3)dessert 4)lamb. I have had lamb before but the meat tasted so gamey. The risotto with langoustine was the star of my meal followed by the seaweed. Sometimes I felt I wanted more in terms of portion size but the richness of the taste always reminds me that what was served was enough. 

On a side note I had an Icelandic mojito as it was very fruity (berry flavored) and what was entertaining was that it came with dry ice and so it had this bubbling effect.

As expected, the staff, the service, and the cleanliness is on par with what is to be expected from a restaurant with a good reputation. I  started my experience with Luma with the Icelandic menu (and would recommend people to try it as well) but I will definitely come back to try their regular menu"}
{"text":"I ate lunch at Luma with clients a few weeks ago and was very pleased with my experience. I ate the tofu dish, which was delicious - spiced really well and the portion size was reasonable (and great for lunch). Service was attentive, but not aggressively so,  very knowledgeable about the new menu, and funny. Everyone was very welcoming. 

The space has very high ceilings and large south and east facing windows, so lots of light. I was able to leave without feeling like taking a nap. Definitely recommended for a good lunch."}
{"text":"Now that I've been here multiple times I can say that the staff is consistently the most amazing friendly staff in the area. Great meals and great recommendations from Marta and Matt this time."}
{"text":"We went to Luma for winterlicious. It's quite a disappointment. The bone marrow was overwhelmed by the herbs and oil, also slightly overcooked. The pork shoulder was dry beyond rescue, left most of it on the plate. The ambience is also agitating and uncomfortable, deluged with loud music and lack of a solid theme. Did I mention the meat was dry?"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere. Brand spanking new for the TIFF. I wanted to be excited about the cocktail menu but we ended up ordering wine instead. Everything we ordered was either good or great. Place gets filled up for reservations according to the waitress."}
{"text":"Luma is basically O&B gold, but doesn't get a five star because of sometimes patchy service. 

First off, I want to say that I LOVE the food and atmosphere at Luma! Everything I have ever had there has been super delicious, including (my new favorite appetizer) Burrata, which is basically a pretty blob of mozzarella. I've also had the pressed duck confit (delicious, but slightly too fatty for me), the steak tartar (MMM), scallop sashimi (probably my favorite food, so definitely loved it) and my favorite main there, the seared yellowfin tuna. Hilariously enough, the waiter had to warn me that it was raw, because apparently people don't know that's what seared means and constantly send it back. If you're going for dessert, make sure you try the Opera Cake!!

So, the location of Luma is what really gives it a special place in my heart - nestled into the Tiff Bell Lightbox, complete with cinematic themed cocktails! What's not to love! 

So, why this is a four star review and not a five (I guess I could call it a 4.5) is because of the service. When the servers are around, they are absolutely fabulous, but sometimes you can wait for even 10 minutes before they bring you water. And sure, if it was a busy place, I'd let it slide, but it really isn't at all. Usually the seats are less than half full. 

To end this review on a positive note, if you tweet about Luma, the head chef will respond to you! Aw. He really cares."}
{"text":"We had a reservation for 8pm but showed up early for Magic Hour. From 4pm onward, the bar serves cocktails, martinis, sangria and a selection of beers all for $5! The bar snacks are also quite good. We tried the truffle parmesan fries and ate them up way too quickly. 

Around 8pm, we went to claim our reservation. Our table was quickly set and we were met with our server. Throughout the meal he was very attentive, and very diligent in his duties. We actually had not realized it was winterlicious, but our server went through the menu with us and we decided to give it a shot. 

I decided on the roasted parsnip salad for my appetizer. Very Dominant texture was coming from the crunchy parsnips. With the accompanying burnt honey dressing, the parnsips were tart/acidic. The presence of sweet figs and chestnuts in each bite helped to balance the tart. 

Main: Beef Coulotte Steak- 3 sizeable cuts of perfectly medium-rare, juicy meat. I must stress how succulent this meat was. I don't usually order steaks because they are just not my thing, but I'm definitely glad I changed it up. The rutabaga came in mashed form and in a good way, it was incredibly buttery as the name implies it should be. I found the brussel sprouts a little underwhelming- grape jus was useful in giving them some flavour. 

Dessert- My dessert choices are very predictable. Chocolate and cheescake are some of my favourites, but I really wanted to steer away from the usual. I decided on a more savoury cheese dessert, Le cendrillon. The mildness of the cheese was a pleasant surprise for me. It was very fresh and palatable, not offensive. As always, honey turned out to be a great companion with the cheese. It was a great finish to the meal. 

Experiences tend to vary greatly at Luma. All in all, we had two drinks each for magic hour, truffle parmesan fries, another drink each at the table and our winterlicious meals. The bill came to $135 without tip. I would say it was well worth it."}
{"text":"2 stars for how the food tasted but overall 3 stars only because I'm giving them points for their presentation of the food, great service and fancy atmosphere.

Thoroughly, thoroughly, I was disappointed with the food here. All the dishes were bland. Wedge Salad was basically an iceberg lettuce cut in half. I was appalled. Let's be nice and say that I at least liked the orange pieces in it, lol. Chicken Paillard was a grilled chicken breast meat with a poached egg on top. It was my first time trying an egg yolk covered chicken breast. Great idea but not something I would expect to eat at a high end restaurant, because I can make that myself at home. I left my Cinnamon Pavlova uneaten after few bites. It was too sweet and sticky. The only thing I liked was fresh blackberries. 

On the other hand, the service was awesome. They provide a coat check service. They will fold your napkins while you excuse yourself from the table. They will smoothly move you from appetizers to main dishes to desserts. Too bad that the food wasn't on par with the level of the service.

To sum up, the dishes were lacking in creativity, imagination AND taste. Their menu was also a little confusing with the way they had listed their wine pairings for all of their dishes including appetizers and desserts. The meal was not a good value for what I got. If this Winterlicious lunch is reflective of their usual offerings, I probably won't return."}
{"text":"Dined here with a large group, about 15 of us.  Food was excellent as was the location.  However it was our server who made our dinner extra special.  Megan I believe, Went above and beyond what is normally expected.  Not only was she knowledgeable about the menu and wine list, she was an absolute sweetheart to my 3 year old son.  Megan obviously enjoys her work and our positive experience was a direct reflection of the attention and care she showed my family. I wouldn't hesitate recommending this restaurant and I would ask to be seated in Megan's section when we return."}
{"text":"Like other reviewers, I wanted to love Luma but the best that I can say is that I liked it.  If it were possible to do so, I would have given it 3 1/2 stars but it doesn't quite get to 4 stars for me.  

The restaurant is on the second floor of the TIFF building.  The modern space and aesthetic was well executed.  We sat on the patio overlooking the corner of King and John street with a view of the CN Tower - great view if a little loud with the passing traffic.     

I thought that the service was very good, although not superior - it took our waiter a very long time to get back to us when we were not ready to order right away.  

We ordered the steak tartare and the Burrata to share as apps ($16 and $17 respectively).  Both were excellent but I enjoyed the Burrata the most.  It is basically a large blob of mozzarella cheese on a bed of legumes in a fresh lemony/basil dressing.  Really delicious.  The steak tartare had nice flavour - not bland at all.   

For our mains, we ordered the lobster burger which was delivered conveniently cut in half for us to share.  It was delicious but looked kind of lonely on the plate all by itself.  I noticed later than for $6 more we could have ordered a side soup or mixed greens but for $21, I thought it was kind of cheesy to just present this rather small burger on the plate by itself.

For our second main, we ordered the coconut milk poached red snapper which was a disappointment.  The fish was overcooked and dry, although I enjoyed the sauce and vegetables it was served on - they were very tasty.  Unfortunately, the waiter never did ask us how our mains were or I would have mentioned the overcooked snapper.  I regret that I did not have an opportunity to tell him that this dish was disappointing.  

For dessert, on the strength of other reviews, we ordered the opera cake.  The presentation was lovely but for $10 I would have expected a larger piece of cake.  It was very rich tasting (almost like sweet pure butter - which I liked) but when we split it in half, it was barely two bites worth for each of us.  The popcorn which was served with it didn't blow me away but the scoop of popcorn ice cream on a bed of chocolate pop rocks which explode in your mouth made the dessert for me.  The sensation of the exploding pop rocks with the cold ice cream was very cool.  If I ever go back, I am going to have to see if they would serve just the ice cream with the pop rocks!  Loved it.  

Overall, I enjoyed lunch but I can't see myself rushing back here."}
{"text":"I took my friends from San Francisco to Luma for dinner.
My friend wanted a root beer but the restaurant did not carry it. As we explained to our lovely waitress that it was probably the 3rd time he got let down. She took the liberty to go downstairs and actually purchasing a bottle of root beer for him!

It was a pleasant surprise for us all, because let's face it... nobody is that crazy about root beer. we were all joking around. but it's the gesture that counts! 

Thank you Luma. As we left the restaurant my American friends gladly admitted to the fact that Canadian are really a bunch of friendly folks. 

10/10 for service.

Food was a bit pricey for the portion size. but they were delicious. Meat were cooked perfectly and the staff made sure we were happy with the temperatures. They also have a good selection of local wine. 

8.5/10 for food."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, we went here during Summerlious without knowing. So the Summerlious menu was a whole lot different than what our online research reflected.We went here to celebrate my birthday and while the location is neat, right above the TIFF lightbox, and the patio has a lovely view of the CN tower, the food is below average. So we had to order an appetizer, main course, and dessert, and everything on the menu I unfortunately forced myself to order. Things like chicken liver for the main course, and a watermelon salad for an app. It just wasn't very good, especially if you're not too adventurous with your food. The watermelon salad was just bizarre.. a very tangy, bubbly taste..the best way I could describe it is diced watermelon covered in soda. Perhaps there normal menu is a lot better, and maybe more affordable, however when we went there were no more than 2-3 options for each course and it was unfortunately not very tasty and very expensive. I suggest skipping on this one, there are better restaurants around Toronto"}
{"text":"Good for an early dinner. Gets busy on weekends.
Service was really lovely. I loved my beef tartare, wonderful presentation."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of friends during a bachelorette weekend. The food was good and the atmosphere was nice. I found the portions small and it didn't have enough flavour or richness to make me feel like the meal was complete for that amount like other equivalent restaurants would have."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. I had the beet salad which was paired with plain yogurt and was just NOT good. I asked the waiter if he could recommend a protein to go with the salad and he recommended pulled chicken - it was awful. Service was super slow but in all fairness it's TIFF. Still gross. Never again."}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Their slow and inconsistent service leaves little reason to return given the competition in the city. Management should re-examine staffing issues.

One poor experience is sometimes all it takes to ruin a dining experience, but judging from what other Yelpers have written, exceptionally slow service would seem to happen more often than expected (even in the main seating area).

So I arrived late Saturday night with 3 other starving diners. Their main restaurant was full, but was advised that they would be able to accommodate us in the lounge, which was only half full. This was probably the single worst decision of the night as their lounge does not appear to be adequately staffed for diners.

Having read what other Yelpers have written, I was aware that the price to portion ratio was high and wouldn't exactly be described as a good value. That's fine but the portion size does come into play when you're starving and service is virtually non-existent, as I will articulate below. The food IS good, but pretty standard affair at this price point. I'll defer to other Yelpers for descriptions of each of their dishes.

I counted one, maybe two, servers in lounge, and as a result of an understaffing issue, SERVICE WAS UNBEARABLY SLOW AND UNRESPONSIVE:

-We had to wait forever between each step of being attended to, given our menus (had to return twice because we weren't given the full menu the first time), ordering drinks and then our dinner.

-Drinks were often left sitting empty for prolonged periods (only one of my friends managed to order another drink)

-After each finishing an appetizer and a main, we remained hungry and were ready to order more, but after waiting for what seemed like an eternity (and with our server no where to be seen), we decided that it would actually be faster (and more filling) to grab the bill and get some street meat. We even paid in cash because we didn't want to risk waiting another 10-20 minutes for our server to process the credit card.

The level of service was abysmal for a restaurant of this purported calibre. When you understaff your restaurant to this degree, it is truly a disservice to your customers no matter how well-trained each individual server is or how talented your kitchen staff may be. With so many other wonderful places in this neighbourhood, let alone the city, it's difficult to recommend Luma."}
{"text":"Been here few times and it's always been 3.5 star experience. I'm a big fan of o&b so I like trying out each of their restaurants couples times at least. Try their tuna app, it's got amazing aroma of flavours. We also had few other apps to share but nothing stood out. I had halibut for main which was dry and boring. I tried tofu salad and pork dish that my family ordered and their dishes were better tasting than my halibut. The desserts were highlight of our meal so make sure you order them! The server was friendly but she was bit slow with everything. It was difficult to get her attention every time we needed something. They should work on service component a bit if they want to keep up their name value."}
{"text":"--- Food ---
Decided to enjoy a nice dinner with my partner here. We ordered Bison tartare ($21) and Kung Pao octopus ($19) for appetizer. Strip loin ($43) as main to share. And luma chocolate bar ($10) for dessert. 

First I just wanted to say they gave some bread (free) beforehand.  It was really tough - why was it so hard and seemed so dry. We just had a little piece each before giving up haha. 

The tartare was delicious, I would recommend it! I would skip the octopus - it is a huge slice of octopus that was a bit too overwhelming and a little dry. The strip loin was tasty though. The luma chocolate was delicious!! Overall the food was pretty delicious but quite pricey indeed (need to consider if it's worth it or not...). 

Note that after 4pm you can get martinis and manhattans for only $5 each! We both ordered one and enjoyed it. 

--- Atmosphere --- 
Very nice atmosphere - we felt at ease and liked the interior design. I made a reservation for dinner, requesting a nice private table with a scenic view if possible. I was grateful the host accommodated our request, gave us a nice private booth in the corner behind the windows with a view of the CN tower behind us. It was very nice. 

Our waiter was attentive, helpful, and kind. 

--- Overall --- 
We may come here again just for the magic hour drinks at the lounge area near the front of the restaurant because it is a nice environment to spend time with your friends/loved ones. A little overpriced for the food for the quality I think."}
{"text":"I had meetings with my agency in the area so I met up with a friend here for dinner after work. I avoided this restaurant for the longest time because I was convinced there was better food on King and that the location here was probably more appealing than the actual food. 

It turns out I was kind of right. Food was reasonable, I had the chicken and it was good but nothing really special. My friend had the fish which he also thought was fine but he wasn't raving about it. The only thing I really liked was the bread and the dip that came with it - that was actually delicious and exceed my expectations. Everything else was good, but not incredible. Dessert was a cake that was pretty good, I'm not sure if it came from the bakery/cafe downstairs or not but it was fresh and light and I quite enjoyed it. 

Overall, ambience was classy but laid back, service was very good - our waitress was there just the right amount and very nice and pleasant, food was fine. 

For $100 for two people it was fine, I probably wouldn't come here again to be honest but I wouldn't rule it out if someone insisted."}
{"text":"As a proud foodie, I am ashamed to say this is my first O&B experience.  O&B chains are touristy famous but I was never a believer in chain restaurants. I wouldn't have thought of coming here until this place was the last place that wasn't booked out for winterlicious. 

Prix Fixe:
Appetizer: 
1.Fragola salad : I'm NOT a fan of beans, from my impression it's only a filler  in cheap burritos. But this salad changed my mind about beans. Its not too well over cooked so it doesn't have the mushy texture most beans carry. 
2.Carrot soup: the blue cheese and bacon is what sparked my curious. I like blue cheese but the blue cheese is just a little too strong for my liking. If you're a \"OMFG I LOVE BLUE CHEEESE\" person, then this would be your kind of soup.

Entree: 
1. Pork shoulder: not a fan of the spice/sauce they used. reminded me of Indian food. But the meat itself is tender and fatty. Can't complain about fatty  :D 
2. Trout : best baked fish I've ever had. baked medium , skin is salted and crispy, but the meat is not overly dry.  scallops that accompanied the fish was a little too small for my liking though. But seafood in Toronto isn't generally good anyway.

Dessert:
1.Baked banana pudding: I was quite dissapointed, it was just banana muffin with banana chips and banana sauce on top. 

Overall my first O&B experience was quite good. I find they try to make everything sound fancy than it is. I guess they try to package their food to be more upscale than it actually is (this is from my disappointment with the dessert) ..Their \"london G+T' is made of beefeater gin, fever-tree tonic water, grapefruit, and basil..... It's just G+T with ...a grapefruit. .. woo-hoo.   -.-\""}
{"text":"I had really high expectations for this place, which might have contributed to my slightly disappointing experience. Don't get me wrong, the place is really nice, very brightly lit, looks classy, etc. It's nice that they have free coat check service in the front, although the downside is that it really slows things down at the beginning and end, and also makes the hallway really congested.

I got the Pear's Prince to drink, which is one of their signature cocktails, I thought it was pretty interesting and quite enjoyed it - the drink is a mixture of bourbon, ginger, black pepper, soda, and had a slice of pear in it. The pear was sweet and crunchy, very delicious!

In terms of the actual food though, I was also a little bit underwhelmed. I got the braised rabbit cavatelli which had swiss chard, zucchini, peas, asparagus and kale pesto. The dish wasn't bad overall, but again, my expectations might have just been a little off. I was expecting huge chunks of rabbit meat, but instead there were just kind of little blobs of meat, and the texture was similar to pulled pork. The texture of the pasta was perfect though, it was firm and al dente, so I really enjoyed that. I liked the kale pesto and all the vegetables and the dish as a whole, but I wasn't blown away. Also the portion was a lot smaller than I expected, so I wasn't quite full after my meal.

My friend ordered the steak frites, medium, and when it came it was definitely overcooked and looked a lot more like medium well. I tried a piece and wasn't too impressed since it was too dry. I will say that the truffle parmesan fries were quite delicious though.

Overall, I think this place is kind of overhyped, just because it's in the Entertainment District and because it's in the TIFF building. It's by no means a bad restaurant, but considering that it is kind of pricey, I think I was hoping for a little more \"WOW\" but unfortunately didn't get it this time."}
{"text":"Gorgeous atmosphere, definitely a great spot for a business lunch or evening date! Upscale spot, interesting decor. Staff is very professional and helpful with the menu. For lunch, I had the barley and mushroom porridge (I was on the fence about this one) and it was pretty tasty! My friend has the Vietnamese salad and thoroughly enjoyed it as well. For two, I believe our total was just under $70. I enjoyed my experience here and would come back!"}
{"text":"We went on Saturday night for dinner and the reception was very extremely friendly and I liked that they had a complimentary coat check. We had made a reservation and asked for a window table but when we got there the window tables were full. But some folks who arrived after us got seated at a window table so... we didn't let it bother us.

The service was very friendly and courteous without being overdone. 

The food was delicious; the gnocchi was melt-in-your-mouth soft and the seared scallops would have made Chef Ramsey proud. The kamut rice was rather chewy so I wouldn't get that again but the cauliflower and other flavours in the scallop dish were fantastic. The bread was served with hummus, which was very fresh. The endive salad was an extremely healthy mix of dried fruit and nuts and was very tasty. They were out of a few things, including mint, so I don't know what happened but what we did have was very good. I love that their ginger lemonade is organic, worth the $7.

It turns out we both read the dessert menu wrong; it looked like the description for 3 of the 4 desserts was just flavoured ice cream so we didn't end up getting any, but after seeing the photos here I realise that they were a dessert plus ice cream! Oh well, we were stuffed anyway.

It has a nice classy atmosphere, so I would probably go back for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Perhaps if I had ordered something from their Winterlicious menu, I would be completely content and satisfied. Disappointment is an understatement for my pappardelle. It felt like a greasy spoon from a diner. I would not have finished my plate if my friend did not tell me to. 

I would have rated this 1 star if my friend didn't enjoy their meal so much."}
{"text":"The service here is excellent and the decor is decent as well. However, for the price the food could be better. The braised rabbit + gnocchi dish was excellent as was the squid appetizer. However, the black pepper tofu was one of the worst dishes I've ever tried anywhere. They put so much black pepper in that it was inedible."}
{"text":"I can here twice for the Taste of Iceland (Nov. 13th and 14th, 13th for my best friend's birthday dinner, 14th for my dear friend's going-away dinner). I'll recount the events separately.

Nov. 13th: 
The wine pairings were great. 
The first course: Icelandic cod with dill mayo, seaweed salad, and salmon roe. The Flatrock Twisted Riesling/Gewurztraminer/Chardonnay was lively and highlighted the dill. 
The second course: langoustine risotto with shellfish sauce and fennel salad. The shellfish sauce was divine! The risotto was perfectly cooked - I like mine with a bit of texture to it. The wine pairing for this was genius, it was the Cannonball Chardonnay, the hint of vanilla in it really emphasized the fennel. 
For the third course, which was the Icelandic lamb with small potatoes, creamed mushrooms, with port and garlic confit, the wine was the scene-stealer (Penfolds 'Bin 2' Shiraz/Mourvèdre), it was so flamboyant that the lamb wasn't as showcased. Also, I found my lamb was a tad well-done for me. However, I am picky about how my meat is done. 
Finally dessert: the Icelandic skyr with sorbet, caramelized white chocolate, cream cheese mousse, raspberries. I made the mistake of eating all the white chocolate instead of sampling it - the sweetness was too much for me, so I didn't take a wine pairing for this course. 

Nov 14th: 
My friend absolutely loved it. He said it was the perfect night before he flew tomorrow. There were two main differences this night in comparison to last night.
The third course: the lamb was perfectly medium, it was so soft and buttery. They ran out of the 'Bin 2' so they used the 'Bin 5' and I loved this pairing! It was subtle and worked in harmony with the lamb. 
Dessert: I took bits of the caramelized white chocolate and sorbet instead of huge scoops of it with my skyr and mousse, which made all the difference. The sweetness of the chocolate and sorbet contrasted with the mild and subtle taste of the skyr and mousse. And the wine, it was so lovely. On its own, it was a nice ice wine (Cave Spring 'Indian Summer' Select Late Harvest Riesling) but with the dessert, it took on a spicy taste - it was quite unbelievable! 

Also, the servers for both nights were gracious, charming, and courteous. 

All in all, I'll make this place my normal go-to spot when I'm in the area. And I'll definitely be a regular for all future Taste of Iceland events!"}
{"text":"A few of my girlfriends and I went to Luma on a Wednesday after work for Magic Hour.
Magic hour truly is magical. Drinks are only $5 and you really cannot complain with that price. Our server was a lovely lady by the name of Jenel who was personable and made our experience delightful - she made suggestions and was attentive. 

My first drink was the bottomless Havana- I didn't really taste much alcohol so the drink in my opinion was OK. I prefer to taste (even if just a bit) some alcohol in my beverage. I decided to change gears and finished the night off with a couple of glasses of wine. 

My friend and I shared the beef sliders and truffle parm fries. We opted to get an additional slider so we can have two each and both the sliders and fries were DELICIOUS. I wish more fries came for $9.00. The bowl is somewhat deceiving. It comes in a beautiful wooden bowl but you'll notice that a couple of dips in that you are almost done as it's not steep. For $9.00, I think they should consider new plating or a new price.

Our whole group had a lovely time. We hung out on couch, the benches, we took up two small chic golden tables. I felt as though as I was hanging out at a girlfriends place. The ambiance and atmosphere were great and it wasn't overly posh (not my type and hard to find in Toronto). I feel that in Toronto there are usually two types of places you'll find: you either get hipster dives and don't fit in or the I am a business professional, don't bother me or cough in my presence type of vibe.  I had this fear going into Luma that it would be that type of place- but it was polar opposite. There were people of all kinds there and it made our experience comfortable.

 We had a great view of King Street and on a nice sunny day, it really gets the energy going.

I suggest that they also get some more bartenders though, for our last round of drinks we almost waited a good 15 minutes. With a great promo such as Magic Hour and being located on a busy work oriented sector- you need to be prepared for that kind of slam. 

Overall though, everything was awesome, I was content with the food and drink options.

I will certainly be back for some more!"}
{"text":"Fancy-schmancy.
We went for dessert & drinks.

I had Fellini's Bellini & my partner-in-crime had the Fruit of the Luma (the lychee was more overpowering then expected).  Sure I ordered mine mostly because of the rhyming name but I quite enjoyed it ...all the way down to the non-soggy raspberry at the bottom.

The dessert we shared was the Opera Cake.  A trio of little goodies, sparse but decadent.  I love the idea of caramel corn as part of a fancy restaurant.

I doubt I'd necessarily choose this place for dinner as they only have one vegetarian entree option for dinner."}
{"text":"Good restaurant with a fancy vibe. I would recommend to wear a dress shirt or something more than jeans and a tshirt. 

Hostesses were nice and very friendly with coat check. It can accommodate large groups but you have to book in advance. Based on it's limited availability, it's a popular place. 

I ordered a rabbit dish and was below my expectations. It was shredded rabbit with some pasta whereas I was expecting a good chunk of meat. It tasted decent but not the quality for the price I was paying. The portion is small and delicate which left my stomach unsatisfied at the end of the night.  
My friend had a steak with fries and it looked absolutely mouth watering. Will definitely get that next time."}
{"text":"It was aite. The food was okay, nothing special and the service was okay. 

The thing I was most ticked off about was there was a fly in my cup of coffee. They serve it black, so surprise surprise when I poured in the cream. Sometimes, I do take my coffee black but this time I definitely dodged a bullet. The server was there when I discovered this wonderful tidbit and she nonchalant said, \"I'll get you another one, it's just a fly\" it makes me wonder how many times this has happened before. She didn't even sound sorry. 

We went for the winterlicious menu. I got the sweet potato soup, the trout and the grasshopper cake. The grasshopper cake is chocolate mouse with mint fjnishings. The trout was pretty good! They did serve up warm bread which is a plus. 

Google says this restaurant is closed on Sunday's but they are actually open. At such an upscale restaurant in Toronto, I was expecting a little bit more,"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a post theater drink.  The place is beautiful and has great views of the theater district but it was empty on a Saturday evening.  The prices are a bit high but it is a captive audience."}
{"text":"Summerlicious menu is delicious. The restaurant's atmosphere is great and the food was yum."}
{"text":"Looks matter. Presentation of the food is beautiful. Luma fits right into a building filled with movie theaters. The service is thoughtful and good-natured."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a nice little restaurant that goes out of their way to create new dishes while mixing and matching different ingredients, look no more. Stop by at the LUMA of O&B which is on the second floor of the tiff Bell lightbox, right behind the BlackBerry lounge.

Nice contemporary decor, cool private bathrooms, fancy table settings together created a great atmosphere... It is visually enticing. The menu looks simple with less than 15 choices of entrées, but the way I see it,  fewer the choices, more effort was put on each dish.

My family and I went there for our Thanksgiving dinner last Sunday. I had the Burrata as a starter.... Wow, it was like a little taste heaven :p My god-daughters ordered the butternut squash soup. Delightful!!

Since it was Thanksgiving, the chef cooked up a glazed ham over mashed potatoes with Brussels sprouts... It was soooo good!!

The service was excellent. I am very pleased. The only problem was at the end, we were offered a thanksgiving dessert. We checked with the Manager and she told us to enjoy it, but then it was charged to our bills.... Perhaps it was just a misunderstanding somewhere, but we didnt bother asking the waiter to remove it since we found out only after we ate it. Oh well!!!

I was beautiful.... Definitely worth trying it out!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food presentment and flavours; great atmosphere, fabulous location in the heart of Tiff excitement, attentive service. I will definitely return, Luma offers a wonderful experience for diners."}
