{"text":"Over-priced frozen food. My husband ask for special of the day - Shrimp Ragu with no vegetables, when the waitress brought it to the table she said \"the cook tried to take as much of the vegetables out as possible\". That was a sign right there! There were 2 huge slices of carrots and one large piece of brocoli mixed in the pasta. My \"Salmon\" also a special of the day was obviously pre-packaged frozen salmon, veggies on the side (carrots and brocoli) were very familiar - same cut as the ones we found in the pasta and also frozen. The owner sat at a table nearby with customers and started drinking wine with them. When the bill came it was a a generic hand written check bill with no indication of the restaurant name or tax number. When we asked to get a proper receipt, the waitress ran downstairs and came back with the same bill with a generic stamp of name/address, still no tax number. You know how that bookeeping is done !!!"}
{"text":"Heads Up! The Big Ragu is not going to be your traditional Toronto Dining Experience! This isn't a place that you come for a quick bite before you rush out somewhere else, this is a place for an evening out. Carm and his team have really taken a slice of small village, family-run Italian restaurants and brought the experience to us. With homemade breads and crisps, courses made with true Italian passion and easygoing atmosphere, you will leave feeling like you had a mini vacation. The calamari is always spot on, agnolotti I return back to again and again but that's not to say the daily carne specials aren't amazing too! Three desserts, made in house and so tasty I actually have to make my sever decide every time I order.   I've been a regular at the Big Ragu going on 6 years now and truly feel like family whenever I walk in the door. The great thing is, I notice that the staff try their best to make every guest feel this way whether it's their first time or a familiar face. If you want to experience real family Italian dining, come for a night out to the Big Ragu, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"After reading several big hyped up reviews by some foodie websites, I decided to visit this place with a friend.  It is located on St. Clair, but you have to drive through the ghettos to get there... so keep that in mind.  Parking was free on the side street.  The restaurant itself was very tiny.  Cute and quaint, but borderline clusterphobic.  Tables were really small; you really had to think about where to place your glasses, cutlery, etc.. (luckly the waitress was attentive and picked up used plates right away).  Right away, we were served some water and a basket of breads while we decided on our dinner.  The garlic bread was room temperature, and was extremely salty, and so were the the flatbread biscuits.  For appetizers, we ordered the P&P salad (pear and parm), which was pretty good but quite small in size.  The sausage and rapini was huge in portions though.  I wish they controlled the portions better--one person would be half full, and the other would still be hungry.  For entree, I ordered the chicken marsala.  The chicken breast was coooked bone in with skin on, and it was nice and moist.  The skin was not crispy, however.  The sauce was very rich, and the potatoes were superbly done, with rosemary herb and crunchy on the outside.  I only received 3 pieces though.  My friend ordered the lamb ragu... I sampled it, and it was yummy as well.  The pasta very nicely done.  For dessert, we both had tiramisu with cappuccino.  It was advertised as the best in the city--but it fell way short.  It was a bit of a wet slop in a martini glass.  After tip, the bill came to $130 (included two glasses of wine each).  Overall, despite some high points, not very impressed, and a repeat visit is highly unlikely."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! A large group of us went to the Big Ragu for a birthday celebration. The food was unique and authentic Italian. The dining experience felt like all of the patrons of the restaurant were one big family. The owner made his rounds to each table and had everyone in stitches. Not great for an intimate first date but fantastic for a solid second!"}
{"text":"I went on a Tuesday night and the place wasn't too busy and I was so shocked. I had an fantastic time. I went with a friend visiting the city and he was most impressed. We started with Magic Mushroom which were literally perfect. He had the lamb shank which smelled amazing and he said it tasted even better. I had the crab ravioli, which was unbelievable. The waitress was lovely and the owner even came over checked in on us. I can't believe it isn't busier, this place is a gem!"}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times and can honestly say each time was a disappointment. The last time we were in was truly monumental, the waitress complained the entire time about her boss and all the people who had quit or were quitting!!!!!! Are you kidding me!!! The Lamb Ragu had no lamb and the Risotto was a bit disappointing, hate to say but mine is better!!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favourite restaurants in little italy district in Toronto is everything you wish for perfect ambiance with a romantic twist for all ages the food is mesmerizing in your mouth when you eat it the cheff /owner has done it you want a real Italian taste you go here dishes you never new existed, clean and wow."}
{"text":"Big Ragu is very close to my heart as this was the first joint where I had my dinner when I arrived in Canada.Most importantly food is always fresh. We are a regular..and we go there to celebrate, to think, to eat, to look back, to relax and just to have a good time.  Quantity is good and quality is excellent. Price is reasonable. I just love Big Ragu! specially there pasta and simple salad ...it will always be special. I make sure all our friends and family members visit there once during their trip."}
{"text":"Food was excellent and reasonably-priced.  Service was poor.  One inexperienced waitress not enough for a place this size on a Saturday evening."}
{"text":"Amazing southern Italian food, old world charm and some pretty interesting wines. I also like that this is a small restaurant where the owner/chef will sit with you and have a glass of prosecco."}
{"text":"Over priced, over cooked pasta.. Service is so so, not sure what's the hype about this restaurant,"}
{"text":"Had the \"magic mushroom\" and antipasto apps to start out. They were a nice start to the meal I had the Linguine Shrimp with mussels as my main. It was fantastic. Shrimp was over cooked but other than that it was perfect. 3 others with me also enjoyed their meals"}
{"text":"BEYOND DELICIOUS!!  Great value, new tastes, cozy atmosphere. Loved it!  Highly recommend trying the Aganotti!"}
{"text":"Before coming to the restaurant for Mother's Day, I checked Yelp, saw the mixed reviews and hoped for the best. Unfortunately, it is clear that the one and two star reviews are far more accurate.  The first problem is the service. I've seen slow service before but this was atrocious. It took over an hour and a half from when we were seated to when we received our entrees. That is just unacceptable, especially in a restaurant that can only seat five or six parties.   As for the food, I can't say it was much better. The magic mushroom salad was the only item that I can rave about. A perfect combination of mushrooms and cheese that I would recommend you order. After that, it was downhill. The ravioli in bolognese sauce was rather bland. The mushroom salad side dish had about 10x more thyme than was required. The rapini was soggy and literally dripping in oil.   I would never return to this restaurant and I suggest you take my word for it and save yourself the $30/person."}
{"text":"Honestly, the food is great, the guy who runs it really cares, the servers are a bit slow, and the bread was toasted too much. Little details like the hot sauce: homemade, with two different locally sourced peppers and gherkins and a whole lot of process and love. The place has been around seven years and I think it's important to support places like this on their way up. The prices are better than terroni and the products are made in smaller batches and imo with higher quality ingredients. A very nice dining experience.   The gnocchi and Lamb Ragu were excellent. The gnocchi really is some of the best I've had at any restaurant anywhere, including in Italy."}
{"text":"This is a remarkable restaurant. I've been there on many occasions and the place never lets me down. Although when it gets packed, don't expect it to be as good as it can be.  The menu always changes and the food is traditional and home-cooked. The owner really loves his food, so his passion for the restaurant really shows. The eggplant parmigiana is delicious and their seafood platters are wonderful. The menu isn't cheap, but when you consider the ingredients, you simply get what you pay for. It is certainly worth trying a lot of little dishes. You should consider sharing up the platters and having the whole multi-course dining experience. However, if you want to go light (and more economical), try a couple of appetizers and a pasta, skipping the more expensive fish and meat entrees.  The wine list is extensive and well-paired with the menu items Ask for advice and you'll get honest answers. The wait staff and owners certainly drink and try their stock--so you won't get some rehearsed tasting note that involves words like \"peppery,\" \"full,\" and \"vanilla.\"   They sometimes have live entertainment and when I was there one night, we were asked if we could take our wine down to the basement where a live band was playing. It was a lot of fun and very welcoming.  The roster of well-known Torontonians that eat there is apparent. People in the know know.   Make reservations as the restaurant is small."}
{"text":"Ridiculously hectic day, miserable rainy fall night, big hunger... The answer: Big Ragu.  This is the place to go for a big plate of comfort pasta and a glass of chianti -- just the thing to cure the Toronto weather blues.  The food: The house specialty, papardelle with lamb ragu, is good but not outstanding. Nice red sauce, but could have more lamb. The pasta al forno (that evening's special) is everything I want: ricotta, spinach, bits of smoky bacon... delicious -- my stomach couldn't be happier. We also get the evening's contorni, roasted broccoli with parmigiano. The broccoli is overdone, but anytime you stick good grated parmigiano in the oven, it's hard to fail completely.  Half-litre of red does the trick - we relax. Our bellies full, we are ready for bed."}
{"text":"Food was awful. I wouldn't feed that lasagna to my dog. Not to mention the fact that they seemed really put out that we didn't have a reservation though the place was completely empty! Really bad experience."}
{"text":"It was the absolute worst dining experience that we had to walk out!!! I've never walked out of a restaurant, but we literally were disgusted and quite frankly insulted.  I normally am open to trying new restaurants in the city, and groupon is an amazing way to get to do it. Four of us bought the Groupon and were looking forward to our double date night. I called earlier in the day asking about the menu and was told to look online. I couldn't find the Groupon menu online which was why I was calling and he said he wasn't in the restaurant and didn't know the menu by heart. I let this slide and just hoped there was enough variety on the Groupon menu for us since we have a couple dietary restrictions.   We got there and actually loved how small and cozy the place was. Saying it must be a hidden gem and we would tell our clients about it. An older waitress came over and gave us regular menus and I asked what do we order if we have groupon? And she said oh hold on and took those menus away and got busy doing something else. I actually had to ask her twice to get a menu so we could look what to order. We got a very nice server who seemed to really be trying for us. One friend asked if they could get the antipasto plate but take out the meat and add more veggies. She asked the owner and without hesitation he yelled NO SUBSTITUTIONS! My friend asked if he always yelled like that to his guests and was ready to walk out then but we calmed him down and got to order the gnocchi which came 45 minutes after. For such a small place how can your food take this long to get? The older woman asked if we wanted parmesan and we all said yes but she only put it on 2 of our plates then walked away. We had to ask the nice server to put cheese on the other 2. The sauce had no flavour and was very salty, but we were starving at this point and just ate it. 3 of us ordered the beef and the other ordered the chicken pasta. We waited..and waited...asked for water and the wife of the owner came over poured 1 glass of water when they all were empty and walked away. We had to ask for water again. It was really bizarre. Our entrees came another 45 minutes and the owner came and brought them to the table. Two of our pieces of meat were a nice size and then he placed my Husband's plate in front of him with a piece of meat that was a third of the size of ours! He also happens to be the biggest of all of us as he is a body builder! I said why is his beef so tiny? And the owner didn't respond and asked the table is everything satisfactory? The four of us just looked at each other in bewilderment. My Husband spoke up and said I'm wondering why anyone would pay so much for a piece of meat this size? The owner said it was the last piece and he ran out of beef. I said so why didn't you say that and he could have ordered something else. Why give him a tiny piece like that. My Husband was so turned off that we had waited so long for our horribly misproportioned food that he said he was so embarrassed and wanted to leave. The owner just walked away! We were all in such a bad mood at this point we called the nice waitress over gave her a $50 tip and left. We will never step foot in this place again. We ended up going to another restaurant and spent over $500 on amazing food and drinks to try to get over this horrible experience. Avoid this hole in the wall at all costs!!!!"}
{"text":"So the food is great, honestly this place change in the last 2 months. The chef is wonderful the food is fresh and cooked daily. With changes coming soon to this place honestly to go place on the weekend in the area."}
{"text":"Cute ambiance - very 'Lady & the Tramp' (right down to the red & white checkered table cloths!).  Food is good quality.  Good selection of simple, home-style Italian dishes made with fresh ingredients.  ANTIPASTO for 2 is a generous portion, but ask for extra bread with it. Service is very friendly.  Overall a tasty meal but a bit too pricey for what you get, especially when compared to higher end restos downtown."}
{"text":"Good pastas at good prices!  Came here last week with my roommate and his father. I had the Ravioli. It was nice, delicious and flavorful and had a good price point. This place deserves to be busier!"}
{"text":"They say hunger is the best sauce, so take this in the spirit of the famished post-moving day spirit my family and I were in tonight.  We headed over to the Big Ragu because my brother-in-law just moved into the neighbourhood.  I was skeptical, due to some previous reviews I read, but we were hungry after lugging boxes and our choices were limited.  I have to say I was really impressed.  Cocktails of prosecco, Campari and soda provided a great combo of sweetness and bitterness while still being refreshing.  Off to a good start...  The magic mushroom salad was terrific.  Mushrooms and goat cheese are nothing new, but these were baked which gave them an intensity of flavour and texture that matched beautifully with the fresh arugula and sweet balsamic reduction/dressing.  I also snuck a taste of the rapini starter and it was fantastically smokey and garlicky.  Really delicious.  We all ordered pastas and to a one they were satisfying, yummy and certainly not over-cooked.  I had a super-garlicked light lemon pasta with spinach and capers.  The salty capers blended really well with generous shaves of slightly sweet grana padano cheese.  Tomatoey penne and rich mushroom pappardelle were also hits.  Our server managed the packed restaurant on his own and he was efficient, confident and warm.  Generally, things moved slowly (only 2 people staffing the kitchen as far as we could see) and it's a pretty small place, so don't come when you're in a rush.  Vegetarian score = 7/10 (lots of choices, didn't feel discriminated against)"}
{"text":"Ok, so I'm of Italian descent and this restaurant is around the corner from my house. It has a quaint atmosphere and looks like a family run establishment so I was excited and expected something truly special.  Not so much !!!!!! I've even gone back 3 times to give them an honest chance but in the end I think I'd rather go to Terroni .. and I hate Terroni. Extremely underwhelming."}
{"text":"Great litter restaurant at the corner of lansdowne and st clair.   We stopped with a few friends for a quick dinner at a very late hour (1140pm).  The restaurant was about to be closing for the night but we were welcomed in and served food within minutes but also we had a plate of appetizers on the house (something cheese amazing wrapped into eggplant - delicious!)  We also had a bottle of suggested to us red wine and it was great!  Not only that - we had two additional groups of friends joining us after midnight and not only they were welcomed with friendly service and smiles they were served freshly made pasta cooked for them after-hours basically.  Great little spot with friendly staff and yummy food.   Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"Don't go out of your way for this place.  It's small, quaint and cute, too bad the food is disappointing and sad.  It has the charm of a family run, mom and pop Italian eatery, but the food is Olive Garden."}
{"text":"The place and atmosphere are amazing but the owner is a really bad person. He forces the servers to write good reviews about that place. He always tries to keep tips from the servers so if you want to tip the servers please do it cash and directly to them. The owner has already been involved in legal issues because of this. I think this place has the potential to be an amazing hidden gem if they were only going to change the management"}
{"text":"My mother is not a very good cook. Even so, I keep going back to her kitchen because it's one of my favorite places to eat. Such is the same with the Big Ragu. The atmosphere is  so intoxicating that it makes me forgive the fact that the food is often so-so.  Red checkered table clothes and the smell of garlic bring warmth to the quaint & unpretentious space. Specials are written on the blackboard, which hangs lopsided on the wall. The wine list is small, and approachable. But it was our waitress, who was the star of the show. With infinite patience and humour she tended to our large, boisterous group without ever losing her smile. Carmen joined in to help with the desserts, making the night feel even more special  As for the food? Well, some of the appetizers were thrilling, while most of the mains were not. But it didn't matter. I just washed the dry clam pasta down with a few glasses of Pinot Grigio and basked in the charm of my surroundings."}
{"text":"Ventured out to this resto as it participated in Toronto Summerlicious... Place was cute with a mom and pop ambiance. The quality of ingredients of all three course dishes were subpar."}
{"text":"Eating dinner at Carmine Accogli's restaurant the Big Ragu is like coming home to an old friend's place or better yet dinner at Nonna's casa! The BR is an old restaurant spot (formerly Venezia) and stepping into it one can't help but to feel like you've really stepped into an authentic Italian experience. What a great change of pace from the College Street Italia chichi scene or the overly hyped overly priced Bene Note.   It was my husband's birthday so I invited friends to celebrate with us. I made a reservation which was a good thing because the BR is a small dining spot (between 30-40 seats) and the place was hopping. Right from the minute we got there Carm took care of us and treated us like we were la familia! :) He is so personable and his love for his business, the food he serves and the customers is so very evident.   We started with cocktails and asked Carm if he could bring us some antipasti. No problem. A few minutes later out came three plates. Two with assorted salumi's/prosciutto, artichokes, roasted peppers and olives. The last plate had three Italian cheeses and they were plentiful. Then he took his time to go over the specials of the day and answered any questions we had. In detail he talked about how things were cooked and what spices, herbs, wines etc. were used.   Three different salads got ordered. A magic mushroom salad, a grilled calamari salad and a pear & Parmesan salad. All salads were fantastic but I have to say the magic mushroom salad stole my heart! Baked mushrooms with goats cheese atop a bed of arugula. Sometimes goats cheese in salad can drown the greens but not at the Big Ragu.   Our mains included the Braised Lamb of the day; a baked Cod and I opted for the provimi veal, pan seared in white wine and sage and then topped with prosciutto. It was a flavour explosion. The only downside of my veal dish is that that potatoes just weren't cooked enough, just a tad to hard still. The lamb was fall off the bone tender in a gorgeous sauce that was so good my friend next to me used a spoon to scoop up the last of the sauce. The baked cod completely caught me off guard. I'm usually not big for cod, I find it smelly and salty but boy was this fish de-lish!   We ordered a side of rapini sauteed in garlic and olive oil and a bowl of spaghetti because leaving the Big Ragu without trying the pasta just wasn't going to happen. Everyone got to taste and we agreed the sauce was hearty, stuck to the pasta and had a slight edge of an arrabiata attitude. We washed down all this home styled Italian goodness with a couple of bottles of Chianti.   Carmine showed his class and his host who is the most side by bringing out a tray of glasses filled with Prosecco to mark the birthday occasion. Let me tell you something about Carmine, this boy can sing! He's got opera pipes! All of a sudden the lights in the whole restaurant go out and in the darkness out comes Carmen with a slice of cake and a candle and he is singing in this unbelievable voice, rendering his operatic version Happy Birthday. For the most part I usually find the singing birthday cake thingy kinda cheesy but at the Big Ragu it works. We finished off with coffees, espressos, cappuchinos. It was a great night.   So the low down was this: 4 cocktails, 2 beers, 2 bottles of Chianti, a table sized antipasti for six people, 5 salads, 6 mains, 5 coffees and the total of the bill with taxes came in at $350. We felt that for the level of food and service that the Big Ragu put out this bill was a bargain.   Check out the pics. If you are ever up in that neck of the woods (Lansdowne & St. Clair) then I would highly recommend you stop in and meet Carm and treat yourself to some really awesome, home styled Italian food."}
{"text":"Family restaurant with nice, cozy ambience (except for the gaudy neon red lights in the window spilling inside).  The food was great and the portions were moderately sized (so maybe a bit small if you're really hungry!).   On the downside, the place was so \"family\" our waitress was was talking on the phone while we were waiting to be asked about dessert (and this was on a Friday night!). This normally wouldn't phase me at a local resto, but with upscale prices you'd expect ambience and service to match.   Note: small-ish menu, with no pizza (but really good pastas)."}
{"text":"I live in the area walked by this place a number of times bit of a hole in the wall no Lansdowne not on the main St Clair strip of restaurants.  It is smaller but quaint restaurant.  Saw they usually took part in Winterlious and Summerlious which was enticing .  Finally made reservations and had dinner there on Saturday night.    My husband and I were stunned by how amazing the food was.  Started with the calamari which was not your usual breaded and deep fried but grilled.  Probably scary for some people but beyond delicious.  I have the crab ravioli, it came out fast and delicious.  Then both had tiramisus for dessert.  The meal was fast, fresh and hot.  Service was great the watress was friendly and quick.  Just to note though we were there early 6pm dinner resturant not full just two other table at the time so I can't comment on service when they are busy.  The chef (not the gentleman in photos below)  came out to see how our meals were he was very personable and that was a nice touch.  This meal was on par with those we had in Italy on our honeymoon.      We will be coming back again and again after this experience.  They have reasonable prices in general and as I mentioned take part in Winterlious and Summerlious.  They also have wine available by glass, bottle and half liter.  The 1/2 litter is something that few restaurants seem to have and for I and my husband a bottle is too much and 1 glass each insufficient."}
{"text":"Didn't get a chance to eat here unfortunately. Stopped in to ask to see a menu  after seeing 'Best of Toronto' stickers on the menu and was told to look at it online. Not sure why they didn't have a dinner menu at the restaurant for us to look at ?"}
