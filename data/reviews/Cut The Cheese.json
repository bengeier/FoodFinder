{"text":"Before I went to try this place I read a number of discouraging reviews, so I had pretty low expectations going in.  I ordered the Egg-celent and the classic mac and cheese: both were delicious!  

A lot of people tend to complain about the portion size: I don't know if they've corrected the issue, but I thought it was A LOT of mac and cheese.  I dumped the box out into my pasta bowl at home and it was oozing out of the bowl: could not finish my dish!  

The fried poached egg on \"Eggcelent\"was a unique touch that added great texture to the dish.  The fontina cheese was nice and subtle, which was great for carrying the bacon, house made ketchup, and hot sauce. Another thing I liked was that it was not oversalted: too often have I been burned by oversalted comfort food!

The regular mac and cheese was gooey, cheesy, and delicious.  Only issue with the regular m&c was the rosemary: if you're not a fan or are feeding a young child, you might want to ask it to be left out as its a strong herb. The pieces are rather sharp too: I wonder if they could infuse the sauce with the stalk while making it and pull it out before serving?  

Both dishes worked out to be about $20 in total, so I think the price is definitely fair. That kind of pricing is comparable with any gourmet fast food place (like Hero or Ravi Soups), which is what I would compare it to.  If you want to be served a hearty meal at $11 dollars a plate, you should go over to the Purple Onion, which is a very different type of restaurant. 

YES, I will go back!"}
{"text":"It's a good thing I don't live close to this place as I would be frequenting it much too often. Feeling tired and peckish as we were strolling Dundas W, and the name caught my eye. Grilled cheese and Mac n cheese - the ultimate comfort foods. Husband and I split the Bull Fighter Mac - Chorizo sausage, roasted spicy cauliflower, peppers and spicy havarti. Thought we had died and gone to heaven. Served in a retro tin bowl. Interesting optional toppings and house made ketchups. Daily specials today were a poutine and French Onion Soup. Clean shop, friendly staff, and local artists on display. Yum!"}
{"text":"Randall and his crew create some amazing sandwiches in here - stuff you'd dream up at home but never succeed with. Really adventurous and delicious. Daily specials do not disappoint.

Homemade condiments are a great touch too.

Walking by? Great little stop for anyone feeling a little peckish."}
{"text":"I am really glad this place opened up. Their cartel sandwich is awesome especially with the chipotle aioli. The guys there are super friendly and outgoing so it makes for an all-round good experience."}
{"text":"Went in here for lunch the other day and was pleasantly surprised. I had the veggie Harvest sandwich and it was mouth watering and so flavorful! It was a good portion and it came with an unexpected pickle and side of popcorn, a definite bonus! I also really loved the house made garlic ketchup.

The staff here are friendly and my sandwich was made quickly. I'm not sure why this place has such low reviews. I would definitely go back. I only wish they had more sit down seating as it could be a nice place to stay a while."}
{"text":"The food was good but nothing out of this world. With restaurants that make comfort foods you can easily make at home for a fraction of the price,  it really needs to wow you. This did not,  but I will say the place was immaculately clean and the food was well prepared.  The staff were very helpful and friendly. 
Food: The mac & cheese was bland and could have used a more flavourful cheese or any seasoning (salt). Don't bother getting the grilled cheese as takeout or delivery as the bread goes soggy which pretty much defeats the purpose. The flavours were very good on the grilled cheese though.  All in all a pretty good experience I'm just not sure I would want to pay $8.00+ for grilled cheese again. $20.00 for a grilled cheese and small plain mac & cheese is not good value."}
{"text":"I have never written a review before and unfortunately, this isn't going to be a good one. My boyfriend and I went here for a quick lunch. I figured there is nothing that I love more then cheese so really there's no room for err, I was wrong. WE both grabbed a classic grilled cheese and shared a tomato soup and classic mac & cheese. For 25 dollars we got two grilled cheeses comparable to a piece of dempsters bread with a slice of processed cheese. The soup was almost like a minestrone base and the mac & cheese...well let's just say ketchup fixed that watery mess. As I stated I have never written a review, I really didn't want to write this review. I hope the best for the company and I really hope they can lower their prices or at least make larger portions. Bottom line, you robbed me of $25. I DO NOT recommend."}
{"text":"Had the southern comfort, it was bland and honestly pretty bad. The cheese they used wasn't sharp enough so it just tasted like milky noodles, and the chicken they topped with tasted like frozen nuggets. It turned into a kind of a chore to eat just so you felt like you could get your $13 worth. The portion was just fine in my opinion but maybe it just felt like too much to me because I didn't like it. However the portion they provide in regards to paying $13 was pretty small."}
{"text":"I agree with some of the other reviewers that the portions are not huge for the price but the quality is excellent. I was really happy with my order. I tried a few of the sides too including the deep fried potato balls, they were pretty awesome."}
{"text":"Loved my grilled cheese and, as a rule, I don't like grilled cheese sandwiches."}
{"text":"Cheese in ma belly!! So good!! My four year old son proclaimed it \"better than McDonald's!\" (And with dollarama across the street you can still get a toy)
We split a classic grilled cheese and fries with candied bacon on the side for just less than $11. Staff was friendly and service was great, place was clean and had neat art on the walls.
I'm definitely going back to try the more adult palate sandwiches.
The homemade ketchup (dill pickle ketchup, I'm in love) is fantastic."}
{"text":"Food is great, but I wasn't full after I had the southern comfort, which is a highlight dish. For the price, I felt I should have had a bigger portion, but the quality is great. The curry ketchup Is delicious."}
{"text":"Just ate \"Southern Comfort\" ... $11.95 for a flavourless snack sized box. The 5 little pieces of popcorn chicken inside were good though. But could not taste any cheese what so ever."}
{"text":"Came on opening day. Attractive, but small space. The seating area is quite small with seating for about 12 people. The seating by the door needs some lights, which will hopefully come in the near future. 

The place has Mac and cheese and grilled cheese. We opted for one of each. The Harvest grilled cheese with squash, carmalized onion,slaw,balsamic glaze emmental and fontana cheese ($8.45) was a bit overpowered by the balsamic glaze. The bread hardened pretty fast, but I did walk home with it. 

I also ordered the Southern Comfort Mac and cheese which was much better than the grilled cheese. It had fried chicken, corn, peppers and plenty of melted cheese. It had a nice spice to it and was pretty filling.  The cost of the Mac and cheese was $11.50. 

Total cost was $22 which is pretty pricey as the portion of grilled cheese is tiny. I did not love it. But it was alright."}
{"text":"New Junction spot good for a quick bite. Dropped in here for lunch on a Sunday afternoon and got a great lunch and even better service. The owner made a point to talk to us personally regarding the gluten free options available. Gluten free bread available for grilled cheese but no gluten free pasta options at the moment. I had the deep fried buttermilk fried chicken which was great (FYI minimal chicken) and my girlfriend had the harvest grilled cheese with butternut squash which was great. Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I cannot give this place a good review. My daughter was so looking forward to this place opening, she would fawn over the coming soon sign each time we walked by. We wasted our money. The mac and cheese was bland, seriously tasteless. I ordered the one with mushrooms and they couldn't have been skimpier on the extras. The whole time our food was being cooked the owner was telling the cook he put too much in and I was thinking, you're kidding me? I asked about a make your own option and he replied with what sounded like a practiced response (and likely because he got the store where we all thought a Subway was going): We are going for something greater than a Subway experience. Then he condescendingly went on about the chef he had help out with the menu. Blah Blah Blah. This is the Junction, not Bloor West or Dundas and Ossington. You can't get away with that attitude. 

The limited menu means that nobody who loves it will go more than a handful of times because who wants to eat the same bloody thing everyday? And once he has exhausted the people who actually like it, he will stand empty.

I give him a year, unless he shakes things up and creates a menu that offers more choice and not until he realizes the REAL worth of macaroni. It's not like he's making it himself. He offers a portion that feels like it costs him 50 cents. And charging $1.50 for added ingredients is just insulting."}
{"text":"so good, not at all what i was expecting.  have to admit that it took some testing to find exactly which dishes i like best, but oh man, they are good.  a lil pricey but totally worth it"}
{"text":"My craving for some cheesy goodness led me to tummy regret. I stopped by to have a try of their mac'n'cheese item called 'Egg-celent!' and let me tell you that it was more like 'Not-So-Egg-celent'. In fact, it was a waste of my money ($10.95+HST). One is definitely better off making this classic family dish at home. 

Does the deep-fried poached egg make this anything special? No. In its case, it added nothing but extra calories. Let me also warn you that the portion size is insufficient! That said, nothing spectacular about this addition to the Junction area food scene."}
{"text":"Some great combinations to the staple comfort food!!! We had a grill cheese and mac'n'cheese. The portions was perfect for 2 people sharing; filling without feeling the beginnings of food coma. Will definitely try different flavors when we are in the neighborhood~!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations for this place, because there's nothing I love more than mac & cheese and other comfort foods. My first visit, I ordered the regular m&c as well as a \"Cartel\" grilled cheese (Guacamole & Corn, Roasted chicken, Banana Peppers, Jalapeño Havarti; I got mine without the peppers).

The mac & cheese was a little disappointing. It tastes pretty good, but it wasn't special. I'm no chef, but I prefer my own mac & cheese to what I got here. There are fancier versions on the menu; maybe those are better. Portion was a bit on the small side.

The grilled cheese was better (though also smallish), but I think I made a mistake in getting the food to go. The grilled cheese sandwiches kind of need to be eaten immediately, I think.

The second time I went, I got the \"Big Bad Wolf\" grilled cheese (Deep Fried Pork Belly, Coleslaw, Southwest Chipotle Aioli, Hickory Sticks, Asiago Cheese; got mine without the coleslaw), which was very tasty. One thing I noticed about these gourmet sandwiches is that \"grilled cheese\" is almost a misnomer, because the cheese is somewhat overpowered by everything else (unless you're having the \"Classic\", I guess).

As a final note, this place is a bit expensive. You can tell they use good ingredients, but the prices would make more sense if the portions were bigger and came with a side.

Oh, and to the other reviewer: I'm not too timid to be harsh (a look at my other reviews would bear that out); I simply see no reason to be harsh in this case.

[This replaces my earlier review, based on a second visit.]"}
{"text":"I really wanted this place to be good, but it was not. :(  

I live in the area so I was thinking it would be a sweet spot for lunch or after drinks. Serving was small and over priced. I could have made it at home. I may go back and if they change my mind, I would change the review."}
{"text":"I'm going with a review in between the nay sayers and yay sayers for now. I really like the idea behind this new place and will continue to try it over the next few months to see how they iron out the kinks. 
The space they have on Dundas West is awkwardly laid out and not very inviting for a dine-in experience. But the mac 'n' cheese... Well, I really liked mine. I had the egg-celent: double smoked bacon, roasted bell peppers, leeks, fontina cheese and a freaking deep fried poached egg on top. Sinful. Cheesy. Egg yolk explosion on your mac. Yum. 
Another friend had the plain mac 'n' cheese and finished it in 2 minutes, which is always a good sign. 
When you go, make sure to have the fried cheese coins: tiny cheese bits breaded and fried that you can dip into their selection of homemade ketchup."}
{"text":"We'll be back and would recommend this place to others.
Relaxed atmosphere. Outstanding, friendly, helpful service. 
Great value - I see other people who reviewed complained about the serving sizes. To me the serving sizes were very generous. Our order was just under $25 and we're taking home leftovers. The cheese coins are a unique, great snack!
The house made hot sauce and ketchup are sensational, delicious and an added bonus to an already tasty meal. 

Added note by daughter - So much cheese! Excellent combination of savoury and sweet, smooth and crunchy with both the grilled cheese and mac n' cheese. Service was awesome as well (very friendly, attentive... But gives you enough space to make choices without being pressured), no need to be nervous here!"}
{"text":"This place is starting to disappoint me. I ordered the big bad wolf(I've had it before and it is a spicy sandwich) I didn't know certain staff require you to tell them you want it with the chipotle that the menu indicates it will have. Aside from that the pork belly was pure fat no meat what so ever. I detected a. Hint of another meat in the sandwich as well. This place is good but, just remember not all staff will make the sandwiches exactly the same so as I will do next time be specific."}
{"text":"I love the food here. From the mac and cheese, to the poutine, to the grilled cheese sandwiches...it is all incredibly flavourful and tasty. Don't even think of looking for a low-cal/low-fat option on the menu, because I don't think there are any.

Portions are generous and filling, so be careful not to order more than you can eat.

Seating is comfortable enough for a quick meal, it's not a place for a long, leisurely dinner, though."}
{"text":"I love this place. The staff are pleasant and the food is great. Personally, I enjoy the Sasquash (butternut squash Mac 'n' cheese) and the Shroomin' Mac. Really like the Beet It grilled cheese as well.

They have weekly specials that change all the time at limited quantity. It's great to see new things, the chef is quite creative. 

I would give this place a 5 if the noodles were cooked al dente and the Mac 'n' Cheese a bit less liquidy. 

Tips: Try the homemade ketchup and hot sauce! Great for when you are suffering from a hangover!"}
{"text":"Let me wade in with the other three star reviewers who are too timid to be harsh, yet too smart to gush just yet.

1. The Classic Mac n Cheese is just like any Mac n cheese you would eat at home. It lacks flavour (I hate saltiness, but this needed salt.) For 7.45$, the portion size I got to go was small.
2. They mainly have Mac n cheese is a few varieties and grilled cheese. The prices are a bit high to attract an under 14 demographic that eats lots of this, and the menu is a bit limited to woo you back. This kind of food is also damn tough to cater to \"to go\" customers, as grilled cheeses don't do well on cold walks home.
3. The service is personable and aiming to please. They are still ironing out kinks getting food out and explaining things. For example, don't tell someone who is waiting on a to go order that it will be five minutes, when in actuality it is 11-12. Don't over promise!!
4. There is no alcohol here, but they are open til 2 a.m on Weekends for those who have the munchies after the neighbourhood bars' kitchens have closed.
5. No credit cards, which sucks. I get not wanting to pay 2-3% on my 7.45$ Mac, but the great customer who wants to feed his entire work crew does want to get airline miles on his credit card for his 200$ order.
6. The inside space needs a tv showing sports or some other inducement to get people to sit inside. Right now, it has some dark corners, and the seats face a blank wall.
7. While this is not a cheese shop, they should possibly experiment with a particular \"cheese of the week\" or sell fresh locally sourced cheeses for people to take home to try to attract a wider audience.

It is super tough to start a business, especially in the \"up and coming\" Junction. The Junction has lots of mid-range coffee and restaurant competition with no weekday business people (virtually no one besides local residents who stay at home, shop owners, and traffic cops are here during the week in daylight hours. Weekends and nights are different.)

Hopefully Cut the Cheese will continue to improve its product and evaluate its menu and pricing structure. I hope they can succeed. It is worth trying."}
{"text":"My favourite thing about this place? Their ketchup. I'm addicted. Seriously, I can't get enough of their house-made, flavour-infused, psycho ketchup. It's like a drug, give me more. 

But really, what a great little place. They offer really tasty gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches and drool-worthy mac' n' cheese. The combinations of flavours are fun and you can customize it to your liking. I really like the Pearisian and the Shroomin'. 

It's comfort food at its best. Gluten free and vegan versions are also available."}
{"text":"Love this place, going there since it's open and even before that ate their grilled cheese. Southern Comfort and Shroomin are out of this world."}
{"text":"Tasty stuff. I had the \"Big Bad Wolf\" and the traditional Mac and Cheese. 

I'm usually let down by restaurants in the junction area and sometimes hard pressed to find food that's actually worth my hard earned money.  Glad I found this place.  I will go back."}
{"text":"Came on a weekday night and had the southern comfort grilled cheese and the harvest grilled cheese. Enjoyed both meals and came with a side of popcorn. You are able to choose which type of bread you would like and they have their own homemade ketchup and hot sauce if you prefer."}
{"text":"I came here because of the T.O. Food fest and it was SO GOOD!! I loved their original mac and cheese mix. Contains the right consistency to the aged cheese and the macaroni was made JUST RIGHT (aldente - right?). I had their tomato soup on the side and there was no complaints. 

I'd come back to try their other menu items for sure!!"}
{"text":"I've been trying so many different places around Toronto for mac and cheese lately; however, they didn't quite cut (the cheese) as much as this place did! 

I decided on the original (because you can't mess with a classic). OMG so good! It was just the right portion, creamy and the delectable bread crumb topping sealed the deal for me. I think my search for the best mac and cheese has come to an end, because I can't wait to get my hands on another bowl of this cheesy goodness! 

Seriously, try it out! Trust me, you'll be impressed!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  The sourdough is amazing.  Seriously though, the sandwiches are awesome, the mac'n'cheese is awesome.  This place has become a once-a-week place for me.  Sometimes you just need exactly what Cut the Cheese is selling.

Try the \"cartel\".  Definitely my favourite item on the menu."}
{"text":"They need to add a \"make your own\" menu, press the sandwiches, and include a free side. Otherwise, unfortunately, this will be a relatively mediocre, overpriced experience. Cheese coins are pretty tasty though."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to this place. I love a good helping of mac n cheese. This place, however, was not a good helping.

The place is very clean! Very nice looking! Staff are friendly and inviting. But the food is what makes a restaurant.

I got the Classic Mac n Cheese. Added on Buttermilk Popcorn Chicken and Candied Bacon. Cause who doesn't love popcorn chicken right? And bacon makes everything better! The mac n cheese has way too much garlic flavour in it, the cheese is bland and just not very good.The popcorn chicken, which is a $3.50 add-on, was bland, tasteless, and I only got 4 little pieces probably the size of a quarter. Serious rip-off! The bacon was okay. Can't really mess bacon up though. Even that was another add on.

For the price, I was seriously disappointed. $3.50 add-on for popcorn chicken of that quality, taste and size is outrageous! It left a very bad taste in my mouth. Did not even want to finish it. Maybe ill go back and try the grilled cheese. But if its anything like the mac n cheese, I will not be returning. Worst 12$ I ever spent."}
