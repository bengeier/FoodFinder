{"text":"The food was pretty good.  I'm only giving it 3 stars because it took over an hour to have a couple corn dogs and a hamburger delivered."}
{"text":"The food is tasty, prices are reasonable my only complaint is the woman who takes orders over the phone. Every time I order she forgets something. whether it's a modification or an extra side of ranch, if I place an order for delivery it is definitely going to be missing something."}
{"text":"Ordered a Gyro combo with fries and a drink for $6.44, well worth it. Great taste, a bunch of gyro meat and crispy fries. Will definitely go there again soon. Just wish there were a few more choices for Pitas and such."}
{"text":"Amazing food tried it for the first time today the Wally Philly is a must! The Fry's The bomb!"}
{"text":"Currently sitting inside. We have been here over 15 minutes. We are the ONLY customers in here. Ordered 2 burgers, 1 order of fries and 1 mozzarella sticks. How dang long can that take? A restaurant like Chili's would have our food to us more quickly on a busy night! It has given me time to notice how dirty the inside of the store is. Dust and crap hanging from the roof tiles, etc. 

Last time we will be coming here."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and it took a while for just two burgers and two kids meals, but besides that the good was really good."}
{"text":"Iv been eating at Wally Burger for years. I just ate there again and found out its under new management. Food was awesome and Place was really cleaned up! Ill be eating there a lot more often now."}
{"text":"Had only been here one time before but last night ordered a gyro.... Omg it was soooo good. 
The shakes are great too ... Especially since i have a peanut allergy ( its so severe that its deadly .)he took great care in making sure i didnt even come in contact or even get a trace amount with any peanuts/ tree nuts in the shake he made. 
Frys were hot not reheated and gyro sauce was great. 
Great customer service. 
Only thing is .....
Need to be open later and on weekends too."}
{"text":"Good arrived after delivery window. No bacon, ranch or thousand island I paid extra for. Mediocre at best. Save your $$"}
{"text":"What a disappointment!!!!!! I visited today around 2 pm. I cannot say that I often do not enjoy a burger, so this was a first. I selected the Thousand double burger, and what I got was 2 over cooked patties - no juice and minimal moisture remained. I should have just asked for another or my money back I guess. There was no one at the grill when I walked in and what appeared to be the owner went back to cook after the order was taken. I guess he was more interested in getting back to the conversation vs exercising some care in cooking the beef properly.  Prices were reasonable and included fries and a 20 oz drink. I opted for onion rings $2 extra. They charge an extra .50 for cheese per pattie. The onion rings were what comes standard from Shamrock, Sysco or US Food-- barely edible and were overcooked as well. I asked for ranch dressing, but did not use because of a weird taste -- possibly about to go bad. 
I was the only customer in the place for about  20 min and yet not a soul asked how I was doing or if I enjoyed my meal. Typically, in a small joint like this, especially when it is slow, someone will check up on you-- not here, not today.
Anyway I will not be giving this place a second chance. I guess it is good value but not what I would call \"good\" by any stretch."}
{"text":"My daughter and I love The Gyros. She gets hers plain with sauce on the side! She is very picky......usually just picks at food! She ALWAYS eats all of the Gyro! She always says she is going to order something else....but when I place the order she says \" mom, mom, mom, can I have the Gyro?\" We dream about these things. So freaking great!"}
{"text":"Humble \"Mom 'n Pop\" place.

Great hang out for couples, families, kids or a quiet time alone enjoying the scrumptious deals!

Friendly, helpful owners. Generous portions, made-to-order the way you want it. Fresh ingredients and free drink refills.

An all around quiet and calm place."}
{"text":"Called this place 4 times and no one answered. How do they take orders? Yelp says they deliver..."}
{"text":"When visiting family in the neighborhood we needed a good restaurant for dinner. When searching on line for a good burger spot I found Wally Burger. The reviews were good and I always like to try new places. The fact that it is family owned and not a chain was a plus. We took everyone's order and drove over to get takeout. We were immediately greeted by the owner and his family, who were all working on a Saturday night. They took our order and went straight to work making our food fresh. All the burgers came with a drink and fries. We took the order home and realized we were missing one item. I called and they offered to make the missing burger right away AND DELIVER IT! We had the burger within 10 minutes and they threw in a pizza too, which was delicious. All the burgers has great grilled flavor. The crinkle cut fries and onion rings were crispy and flavorful. My husband is very picky and he loved it.  We will definitely be back when we are back in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Ordered two burgers w/fries. Took an hour to get to my house, food was extremely cold and they only delivered one burger even though I paid for two. I've been trying to call them for hours now and it appears their phone line is cut off or something. Pretty unprofessional if you ask me. Never ordering from this place again."}
{"text":"I love their gyro's!  Haven't had better since I left California.  The fry's are really nice too.  I just moved into the area 3 months ago and was lucky enough to come across them by accident.  If they were in a better location I am sure they would do a lot more business for selfish reasons I like them where they are at and hope they stay there.  Be prepared to wait for your order, it does take them time to cook it, but once it is in front of you, you will agree that it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Nope. Not worth the money spent here. Burgers are tasteless and dry.  I was looking forward to eating here, as I have patronized this establishment many times in the past. Looks like things have changed here, especially quality. Sorry to see this place go in this direction.

Thank you ladies and gentlemen."}
{"text":"So Bomb! But we had our burgers with a lot of added yum! Jalape√±os and super sloppy! Burgers, fries, onion rings and drinks were perfect! Definitely will be back and we totally liked the eating area! Super Kid friendly! Ate and watched Captain America with the little one! So wish you guys were in downtown Phoenix!!"}
{"text":"Wow just wow
Make McDonald's look like Ruth Chris
Total garbage food
Dried out is an understatement 
Nasty people working there
No restrooms to wash your hands before you eat
The gyro meat was not even meat not sure what it was
But on a positive note they do love god and make sure you know it even if they go to the biggest cult church on the plant I thought god loved all people so I went to this Harvest church that Wally burgers very much promoted and was told at the door that my husband and I are not welcomed and we are an abomination of god for our gay lifestyle lol"}
{"text":"Just ordered delivery from them, driver was too lazy to look up directions to my address before coming so he couldnt find the place. Called me and refused to look for my house and demanded i come to him, which i did. My order was totally wrong and cold too. Just another crappy restaurant where the employees dont care."}
{"text":"they messed up my order and when I tried calling twice they hung up both times and blamed me for hanging up poor service as long as you do not care what you get feel free to order away"}
{"text":"Stopped in with my son today for a quick lunch.  People here are so friendly and personable.  Food was excellent and fresh.  They are in process if changing owners and are adding about 20 new menu items in the next two weeks.  Super excited to have authentic meditarrian so close.  The good was good, people are nice.  Can't ask for more."}
{"text":"Great burgers. Go for the Mighty Mike. It has double meat, double cheese and bacon. Plus it comes with a giant pile of onion rings and fries."}
{"text":"One of the best burger joints in town! Customer service was great and the food is absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"The owner is nice but the Restaurant was very dirty the floor & chairs were filthy. The food was way below average. A big disappointment."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time yesterday. The burgers were flavorful and juicy. I love that they use King's Hawaiian rolls for the bun. The onion rings were thin and crispy with onion in every bite. There are lots of condiments to choose from. You can build your own burger or get one of their specialty burgers. The food was fresh and hot. Great customer service. The owner came by our table to make sure we were happy with our food. She was very friendly. This is a small, family owed business. Cool Marvel comics decor. I want to try thier cheese steak when I return. They have many desserts also ( deep fried brownies, Twinkies etc). This is a foodies paradise which I highly recommend."}
{"text":"If I could give a quarter of a star, I would- if that. My friend and I ordered through grubhub and JUST received the food and it was a lost cause. No chili cheese on the fries, but paid for it. Asked for a medium burger with dressing on the side but received a hockey puck with soggy lettuce because they put the dressing on the burger but also on the side. My friends gyro was basically a pita with 3 slices of beef and chopped tomatoes. The mozzarella sticks were cold and hard. The WORST experience ever. She even called right away to speak to a manager and voice the issues, and in return he wanted to just about argue price over ranch and whether she paid for it or not and then he had the decency to ask the cooks if they put chili and cheese on the fries while still on the phone... as if she was lying? And to top it off, went to dump my drink only to find a small bug in the cup which we were blamed to have put there. Let's just say we paid more than necessary and was only offered 20% back. Yes, it's better than nothing, but that's only like $7 from the order.  It's like two ripoffs in one! HORRIBLE. HORRIBLE. BLAH"}
{"text":"First Time here. Got the western burger. Great food great service. Definitely worth the visit."}
{"text":"My order took two hours to get here. It was cold had to use microwave to heat it up. They gave my shake to someone else may be last time I order from them."}
{"text":"My family and I love coming here. Super friendly and amazing food. We live right around the corner,  so my 2 year old son and I walk there! Totally worth it everytime"}
{"text":"Love wally burger. Always get super friendly service and love the flame grilled burgers. They deliver which is great but the fries are always cold by the time it gets here."}
{"text":"This place is so disgusting. I am surprised that the health department has yet to close this restaurant.  Upon entering the building I immediately  smelled years of buildup of dirt and grease.  The burger I ordered left me feeling extremely nauseous. If you are considering eating here reconsider."}
{"text":"At the suggestion I offer myself up for sacrifice from another Yelper I went here for lunch.  It is situated well back from the street in a strip mall.  The major tenant is Target and for spotting purposes El Paso (at least the building) is right on the corner.

I opted for the 1/4 lb burger and fries for $2.99.  With the addition of cheese and a shake the total came to $6.46 with tax.  I was an OK burger, it came with a large bunch of fries which were crispy on the outside and soft in the middle and lightly salted.  The shake came with spoon for a reason, no way could it be sucked through the narrow straw.  

The menu board is sort of confusing and I should have picked up one of the to go menus as I noticed many folks ordered from that.  There are Gyros and Hummus which I would not expect to find in a burger shop.  I noticed several of the adults ordered Gyros so maybe I ordered the wrong thing. 

This place is not fast.  When it gets busy, the food takes longer to arrive than to eat.  Unknowingly I arrived just as students from a nearby school were also arriving and even though I got my order in before them there were already several people waiting for their orders.  By the time I got my meal the place was standing room only and several kids outside.  I would say this is a popular hangout spot, even a couple of their teachers were there for take out."}
{"text":"The only reason I give this place a four star rating is because of the Gyro... It is pretty good. Not the best, but definitely good. the burgers use to be way better. I went here recently after having moved away and coming back and this was just tragic. It use to be one of my kids and I favorite places for a quick stop in and bite to eat."}
{"text":"Nothing better than an old school burger with a killer shake love this place. I love having them close by"}
{"text":"This place... how is it still open? Its really dirty empty unorganized. The food was edible however for those prices I'd rather go to another place down the road!"}
{"text":"Place looks a little run down outside, and they have a truck parked by the street that is a terrible advertisement, it looks like it was new in 1971, has graffiti all over it, and has flat tires. That truck needs to go. You would not expect great things based on appearances. BUT, you have to try this place! The burgers are excellent! Really is a gourmet burger at a burger joint price. Better than Smash and Hopdoddy for my money for sure."}
{"text":"Happened to be in this area of the valley today, a long way from home and was looking for a place to eat. My son said Wally Burger has great reviews on Grubhub, so we stopped in. The owner was very personable, and stepped out from behind the counter to go over the menu board with us, since we were first timers. I ordered a #1 (single) burger combo and my son ordered a #2 (double) burger combo. The food arrived promptly, on plates, I might add - and the food was great! The burger tasted like you'd make at home and the King's Hawaiian bread bun was an added plus. The fries were extremely good and seasoned just right. This is a little hole-in-the wall, decorated with Marvel superheroes, but if you're ever in the area, don't miss the opportunity to enjoy a really good burger."}
{"text":"Dirty ceiling and walls. A little pricy but the gyros are good. I'd give these guys a year before they're out of business."}
{"text":"Good food. One thing bothered me, though. I ordered a number 7 combo which is supposed to be $6.49 and it comes with chicken sandwich, fries, and a drink. I asked if I could sub the fries for onion rings and the drink for a shake and she told me yes. I was assuming it would only be a couple bucks extra. WRONG! It came out to be $12.12!!! The price was almost doubled. That's ridiculous for just a little substitution. Other than that the food was good. Don't know if I would come back for that price though."}
{"text":"Eh... 

Stopped in because of a gyro special ... also ordered a plain burger.  Kind enough to wrap the thinnest patty I have ever seen on lettuce for me even though they didn't really understand lol and was charged $4 too much because the special isn't valid... she was kind enough to blame her dad and give us the difference back.  :) I like to support local but it's not it my fav. Gyro was pretty good."}
{"text":"Ordered our food at 2:28, finally was delivered at 4:03, nice and luke warm/cold. All the food was 50% burnt. It was horrible. 

We ordered 2 cheese burgers, 2 fries, 2 shakes & 2 sodas. 



Nice job Wally, never ever order from here. Horrible service."}
{"text":"I'm assuming this is a family owned and operated business, for as we walked in two younger I mean young girls like 12 and 14 maybe taking our order and running the register..We had the gyros ,that I'm assuming was frozen meat popped in the microwave because they did not have the fresh gyro meat like they do back in Chicago :/ Gyro was just ok,but now the onion rings were fantastic! Very clean kitchen/ cooking area and friendly youngens the counter,for this we will be giving this place another try maybe for a burger and some cheese fries next time!!"}
{"text":"Couldn't even really give it a one star; should be zero stars honestly. My boyfriend ate a gyro and I had a burger. We both felt sick; but he was at the point where he couldn't be three feet from a toilet the rest of the day. I even had to go buy him Imodium. I laugh at anyone who still eats here and will never recommend this place."}
{"text":"We've always passed by this place when going to Target but thought we'd try it out. I got a gyro because I can never pass them up and it was delicious, plenty of meat and all the usual gyro trimmings included like tzatziki sauce, tomato and onion. Hubby and son got burgers and they seemed to be impressed by them compared to most places. Fries were excellent and plentiful. Employees working at the time were attentive, pleasant and checked with us while we were eating to see how things were. Will definitely go there again when it's lunchtime and in the area! :)"}
{"text":"I just tried this place for the first time, and I can honestly say it's really good! Totally going back."}
{"text":"I have to preface any review I write about a burger shop by saying that for me it is hard to find a bad burger at a one location mom & pop dive and it is hard to find a good burger at any chain restaurant.  There is something more than the meat and bun, it is the love and need to pay the rent that goes into a burger in the small joints that makes it special.  I will also say that the worst way to impress me with a burger is to make it 6' tall with every known thing that should never be added to a burger so that any possible taste of ground beef is lost forever under all the add-ons.  The absolute best burgers I have had in my life are in tiny out-of-the-way shops where the owners are aged far more than the beef, with a bun, a burger and some mustard.  I'll go for lettuce, tomato, onion and (yeah I know, some people hate it, ketchup).  And I ALWAYS test a new place with their plainest burger on the first visit and maybe next time, if there is one, will try something fancy.

All that being said, what about this small one-location place called Wally Burger in a far corner of a Target parking lot?  To their credit they have been around for a while (not many Phoenix restaurants can say that) and they are consistent.  This was my 4th visit and instead of a burger I made a last-minute choice to go with a Philly Cheesesteak sandwich (pictured).

The sandwich combo came with some nice crunchy ripple fries (probably from frozen) but deep fried just right and a 20 oz fountain drink.  I suspect they load the ratio of syrup to water in their drinks a little richer than fast food places because my orange soda had a nice satisfying taste of orange.

The sandwich, though not huge, was absolutely perfect ... something so close to what you would find in Philly that you probably wouldn't want to quibble.  The bun was just slightly crusty with a warm soft interior, loaded with real meat (yes, I even found a tiny bone fragment), loaded with saut√©ed onions and green peppers and the gooiest cheese you can imagine.  It was the lunch special of the day and the total cost was almost exactly what McD's would charge for a Big Mac, fries and a drink.

What I love about Wally Burger is there is no pretension.  They never seem to have many customers but most likely it is because of their odd location (I hope this review helps people discover them), but they are just nice kind good people.  I so want them to move just a little to some location where they can be seen from a main street (but never open more locations).  But on the other hand I also so want them to just stay exactly like they are so they are always my little secret."}
{"text":"Honestly...the burger I had wasn't that great...I experienced better. I went there for lunch and there was like a young kid was taking my order...poor customer service...and my burger came on OK. Wasn't that great and kinda pricey."}
{"text":"I read the reviews on this place. I wanted to try the philly cheese steak sandwich. I have to say it was AWESOME. Very good and nice service. I requested shredded lettuce and some tomatoes in 2 of them. me and the wife killed them. If your a big guy like me get 2 there not huge like charleys. but way more flavorful. wish they sold them in a 10 or 12\""}
{"text":"Yummy burger and fries with jalape√±o and cheese. Nice crinkle cut fries. Freshly prepared while I waited. Highly recommend this local spot. We will definitely come back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Man I'm dying to give this place bigger reviews!  Its in my list of places to revisit, but for now...3/5 is all.  The French fries are crinkle and great.  The Greek influence is obvious and a welcome change  from the typical.  Their business model is a cross between fast food, family diner, and cultural experience. It's definitely worth a trip to try for yourself. I'm told the wings are fantastic... They will be what I have next trip. 
The staff is extremely kind and welcoming! Lots of smiles and happy faces make for a place worth visiting often."}
{"text":"This place is a really hidden! Good prices and okay service! Needs to be updated and cleaned, Looks like it must be under new ownership but the food is just okay."}
{"text":"First time coming here and the service is great they great you as soon as you walk in. If you have any questions they are right there to assist you. They have a wide variety of food. We plan to come back because one the food was great and second so was the customer service."}
{"text":"!!!!!!!!!!---- STAY AWAY -----!!!!!!!!

I've been going to Wally's Burger for over 7years. They now have new owners. I took my family for some delicious Wally's Burgers but was very disappointed to say the least. The burgers were extremely dry, plain no flavor and it was obvious that the patties were sitting for a while ( NOT FRESH AT ALL). Poor excuse for a burger the lettuce,tomato and onions were also not fresh very old. Wings were dry, hard and flavorless just disgusting. Honestly never wrote a review before but I feel the need to let Wally Burger lovers know that they have new owners and the food is not worth your money McDonald's would definitely be a better option. It's not even about the $45 I threw away, it's about the food quality for the customers. How can any owner or anybody with a little bit of common sense think it's okay to serve a family that garbage, they are definitely not up to the old owners standards."}
{"text":"I have seen this place a few times but decided to stop in tonight after a quick Internet search for someplace to go.
Glad I stopped in !!
Had the Mighty Mike special. What a great burger. Double cheese with bacon. Half fries - half onion rings. On a kings Hawaiian bun. Holy hell !!! I will be back !!"}
{"text":"This is my new go to burger place. My husband likes that he can get food delivered or I can order online and go pick it up. The owner even waited to make my fries til I got there so that they wouldn't be cold when I got home. Can't wait to try more on their menu."}
{"text":"Changing it to a 5 star. Is the food gourmet? Nope, but I love the passion the owners have. They truly want you to enjoy the food and experience. It's the only place we get burgers from now!"}
