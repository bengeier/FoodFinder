{"text":"Absolutely amazing device and great food. Alaska Rool is one of its kind and a great delight. Will visit again with more friends for sure."}
{"text":"I loved it here! My mouth is still watering thinking about their sushi. I thought the service was good too. It's in a lovely (albeit secluded) place and it was quite nice to sit outside by the fountain after dinner."}
{"text":"I went for the all you can eat lunch meal. I must say the kitchen food, I.e. The Chinese and Thai dishes were not good at all. We ordered the dry chili chicken, general Tao and sweet and sour. All of them were sub-par. 

I'm only giving this 3 stars because the sushi was decent. Notice I said decent - not very good. Out of the ones we ordered, I would say the Red Dragon rolls were the best. However, There are much better sushi places in Mississauga. 

The only reason why I would suggest someone to go here is because of the low price. $15.99 is decent lunch price for even all you can eat sushi."}
{"text":"Went to zem one 2 days back!! Pathetic experience.. We, family of 6 went.to zem.one after reading the reviews, but zem.one turned out to be highly disappointing. Ordered soup as an appetizer which came after ages , but then there were no bowls and soup spoons,after waiting fr 7,8 mins we had to call the waitress to get us the bowls and spoons which again.took abt 5 mins. After a while our curries came, but there were no rice,or plates , we kept on waiting and again had to call waitress to get us the required stuff.we were highly infuriated for spoiling our weekend dinner..you should go there only if you want to embarrass yourself infront of your family members. Pathetic service. Extremely small serving size. NEVER going there again."}
{"text":"Nice looking place. Ordered Chicken Pad Thai for take out. Great service. Good food."}
{"text":"I wish I had heeded the advice of other posters here on yelp, and stayed away. This place is their way or no way. Now I know why they have to continue to get their business from coupon sites, preying on the unknowing. If you bought, get a refund before it's too late. Enough said."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the worst meals I have ever had in my life. The sushi made my boyfriend and I sick and the chop suey was so stale tasting.

I wish I could say that the service was at least good but it was a fail as well. We stood at the front waiting for a table for about 10 mins (it's a very small place) and it took another 10 before they even took our order. When the food came we had no cutlery and waited another 10 minutes for that. 

The bathroom was so disgusting that I would have walked out before eating but we had just placed our first order. If the bathroom was any indication of the hygiene of the kitchen... :( :(

Lastly when we asked for our bill the waitress wasn't coming so after 15 more minutes I just got up and walked to the front to try and pay. She at that point came, saw food on the table and said she had to charge us for the leftover food which we flat out refused since it made us physically sick.

I highly recommend that you NOT eat here. Food is a 0, service is a 0. $50 I will never get back."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed by the place, decided to visit the place since we were starving and it was Tuesday,  arrived at 2:30pm,  came in with a friend and was told to find a table which we did. We were attended to, took our order, the appetizers were rather quick to come in although it's not appetizing at all to see your waiter open up two sachets of powder Miso into two small bowls of boiling water and whisked and served.. but we were like \"ok\" and kept going with it. You'd think it's a weekday mid afternoon and you'd have good attendance towards your table, not the case! The place was empty and the one girl  had left with her shift done. The only people at front were the sushi chef and the one guy who did home deliveries and that was the one person whom was serving the food as well, once he left to deliver an order the already served empty food dishes were piling on in the side table and the sushi chef had to come and pick up the dirty dishes. Afterwards we had to call the sushi chef to give us water and then I noticed one of the glasses had white residue on the bottom. disgusting.. also we had only two items of sushi served and were already asked if we'd order more, seriously? If I order something on the sheet is because we want to eat it! Then afterwards the food stopped coming and what had happened was that we were expected to approach the sushi chef and tell him to go ahead and give me the other order I had already given him at the start, seriously? Omg.. Really bad, people were friendly but that's not justifiable! Too bad."}
{"text":"The Hot and Sour soup was soooo Salty!! The edamame had too much salt. The Thai basil dish does not taste good. It's sweet and minty. Gross. The red curry was sooooo salty! The salad is watery. The booth was wobbly. This place does not care to improve on the many bad reviews they get!!! Not coming here again and will not recommend."}
{"text":"Compared to the other AYCE places in the area, this place is probably the worst that i've ever been to.  The food looked nothing like the pictures on the review page here, and the taste was mediocre at most.  

I ordered my food at 7:30 pm, and by 8:30, some of the dishes hadn't come out yet.  When I inquired, they said they probably didn't make it \"because they were closing soon\" (9pm closing time).  Honestly, I don't know what kind of business runs on the mentality that it's okay to not produce a customer's order, and follow it up with that excuse when questioned.  If you want to close down the kitchen, close down the restaurant first!  And I think that 30 minutes is enough time to make an appetizer, not to mention 1.5 hours! 

I would not recommend this place and I would never come back!"}
{"text":"We used Groupon voucher for take out and was disappointed as value was not there. Freshness for 50 pieces platter was Ok at best, they did not give miso soup nor salad or tea. Oceans grocery store next door would have been better for prices we paid."}
{"text":"Nice decor, nice ambience but overpriced. Sushi isn't anything to write home about. I ordered this chicken stir fry type dish and I kid you not, I could've made it at home. It was three pieces of cold chicken breast with teriyaki sauce drizzled on top and laid on a two pieces of lettuce. There were four steamed pieces of broccoli on each side of the plate and apparently that made it worth $14. My friends ordered an assortment of sushi, rice and soup and by the time our food arrived (40 mins later) our food was cold. One of my friends waited a full hour for her dish to arrive and it was disappointing. Haven't gone there since and don't intend on going their again."}
{"text":"I've gone half a dozen times to this location on a weekday evening and it's usually been me and 1-2 other tables customers max.

The service is decent depending who is serving you.  Some servers are way more attentive and pleasant than others.

I've had the sushi, sashimi and some of the Thai dishes.  My go-to is the orange and green dragon and the salmon sashimi.  The chef is very nice and has even made a custom order for me avacodo, mango and salmon and it was very delicious.  I call it the \"birdie\" roll and hope they would add it to their menu one day!!

Average about 60 bucks for two, all you can eat.

They also have halal meat which is a huge plus for those who observe Islamic dietary laws.

They have free wifi if needed, and flat screens on the wall.

Would be 5-stars if they had a place to pray (like many restaurants in the GTA with halal meat) and cleaner more functional bathrooms.

Overall would recommend for the sushi and I will be going back."}
{"text":"I wish I had listened to reviews before I decided to have dinner here. The only reason I went here was because there was a Groupon and I was in the mood for sushi. 

This was hands down the worst service I have ever experienced at a restaurant, not to mention probably the worst sushi I've ever had.

The host seats us and asks what we'd like to drink. I asked for a water and my father asked for a ginger ale. The host then goes over to the sink that's in the middle of the restaurant and pours me a glass of WARM water. He also gave my father a can of ginger ale and no glass when he specifically asked for one. Our waitress comes over and asks what we'd like to eat. I ask her a few questions, none of which she is able to answer, and keeps running back to the kitchen to ask someone. We finally get our order in and it takes an hour to get our food out. The waitress apologizes profusely and says we'll get miso soup on the house. That would have been nice if the soup wasn't cold (the tofu pieces were like ice cubes). The waitress finally brings out our food and with one of the plates, she knocks my entire glass of water over on the table and on my lap. She apologizes again and leaves. She didn't bring me a new glass of water and she didn't bother to bring me a few napkins to clean up (or clean the table herself). 

After we're finished eating, we ask for the bill, which takes another 20 minutes. I finally go to the back and say I'm ready to pay, and she prints my bill. From here I can see all the other people that are noticeably upset. On top of that we had to ask multiple times for things like: wasabi, soy sauce, plates, spicy mayo, drinks, etc. We'd ask for them at the same time, however our waitress only brought one thing at a time and forgot about the rest. 

It took approximately 2 hours from start to finish and quite frankly I was embarrassed to take my dad somewhere so awful. Please do not eat here, you'll be wasting your time and money! :("}
{"text":"If you live in Mississauga and you work in the village court area, you may know of this place. Since it only opens during business hours, Monday to Friday 9-5, the usual customers are professionals in the area. I have had their chicken shawarma on rice, this other chicken dish, broccoli cheddar soup (which tasted so good and I don't think there was even cream in it), I also had my friend's salad which was also very tasty. The service was great, there was one particular lady I always saw and she was very sweet and helpful. It's a quiet place with large, comfortable seating areas. Since Sq1 is close by, I assume a lot of people don't opt to eat here but I do reccomend doing so."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch all you can eat sushi and ordered following list (with reviews):

DJ Dragon Roll (9pcs) - simple. Not a lot of flavour. Nothing special to talk about. Next.

Spicy California Crunch Roll (10pcs)- very filling. Deep fried potato wafers with spicy mayo in a Cali crunch roll. Decent taste.

Red Devil Roll (8pcs) - spicy. Jalapeño pepper slices topped off this roll with spicy tuna and avocado. Good taste. Nothing jumps out.

Mississauga Paradise (8pcs) - known as the most popular roll. Good flavour. Wish BBQ eel was in this. 

Ginger slices didnt taste fresh.

Overall: alright sushi. Nothing mind blowing.  Fit the bill for a lunch of all you can eat sushi. Found a lot of the special rolls were \"California roll with\" various ingredients. More creativity would be appreciated."}
{"text":"I could rate this as a decent place to eat. The location is central and the place inside is quite nicely decorated with good cushion chairs and booths. 

The service was very good and the person serving us was very attentive and help full. She took the order quick and the food came flying and was hot and fresh. The soup had a small hair but she brought a new one, quickly.

The food was above average as a whole. We ordered sushi box A which comes with soup and salad, Pad thai and sweet & sour soup.  

Soup - Miso soup was just ok and was missing tofu but the sweet and sour soup was really great.
Sushi - was fresh and tasted good. They have a bar in front of where we are seated and they make it right their.
Pad thai - was too sweet for my liking so we asked for some hot sauce to spice it up. But the pad thai was done well and all the ingredients were used wisely. They put the peanuts on the side which I liked as some restaurants put them on the top and we might not eat as many peanuts.

price/ value is 3/5 as the mean does fill you up but is not for sharing. 

For my Muslim brothers and sisters - they mention it on their site and is listed on the front door of the restaurant being Halal and alcohol free environment. I also verified it on zabihah.com but do your due diligence."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with my mom as she wanted to try it out. I've never heard of the restaurant but looked it up on yelp and decided to stay away from the sushi.

We ordered the shrimp tempura and chicken  pad thai. I can see why people say to stay away from anything sushi related because the tempura was extremely bland and unappealing. The pad thai was the only redeeming quality of our meal.

Price of the meal was average and the quality of the service was mediocre at best. Washroom was dirty and the light over the sink would hit my head if I didn't duck (I'm 5'11). Tons of better sushi restaurants in the GTA to try instead of Zem-One."}
{"text":"I dig this place, mind you it was a damn near impossible to find if you've never been before (like me), so thank goodness I had GPS! For those on the lookout for this place it's on Village Centre Place which is most easily accessed by going north on Hurontario St and making a  right on SherwoodTowne Blvd followed by a quick left onto Village Centre Place which is a court surrounded by low rise offices (think a business park).

If you go towards the back of the court you'll see the ample parking that services the entire area. Once parked Zem-One is easy to find, identifiable by their tall Zem-One flags and sandwich boards out by the curb.

Those sandwich boards come in handy since they are the ONLY sushi spot in the 905 doing Drive-thru sushi. Huh? Basically you call in advance, place your order and they will meet you at the curb with debit/credit machine so you can essentially drive up, pay for your lunch and go - super convenient.

If you're dining in/taking out they've got some incredible lunch specials that include sushi and even some thai and noodle options. I was dining in the other day and ordered a maki lunch special. It was excellent, a very creative creation with amazingly fresh ingredients. They've definitely done a great job here.

Consider this a hidden gem in Mississauga and worth checking out! I'll reserve the 5th star for future visits

Eatcrest Out!"}
{"text":"Does anyone know if the original owners of zem one (hurontario and eg) opened up a new one?!"}
{"text":"Horrible Sushi. We had a big piece of Hair in our Sushi and the Manager told us he could give us 50% off because the hair was only touching one piece of the sushi..... umm... okay sure.  Quality control is obviously not important to them.  AVOID THIS PLACE.

This place is a weird Fusion \"Sushi\" joint that serves Thai, Chinese, and Japanese food.  At first glance the place looks clean and inviting.  The menu is organized well and the prices seem more expensive than they have to be.  All you can eat Sushi is $17.99 for lunch which seems really high for the quality of food.....

My experience here started off on the wrong foot. We ordered green tea and it was Luke Warm.  We told our server and she informed us that their hot water machine was broken and offered to put it in the microwave for us.  We opted to drink water instead.

We ordered the Small Sushi and Maki combo for $24.99.  The combo came with 6 California Rolls, 6 Salmon Rolls, and 12 pieces of Assorted Sushi.  The Sushi tasted like it had just been taken out of the fridge from Oceans supermarket.  It was really nasty!

I guess they thought that adding a piece of hair for garnish would make it taste better.... guess not."}
{"text":"This was by far the worse \"sushi\" restaurant that I've been to. It serves Japanese, Chinese, and Thai food so it clearly this restaurant can't specialize in one cuisine. I came here for lunch and wanted a reasonable meal at an affordable price but prices were more than what it should be for less than mediocre sushi. I asked for green tea and when I took a sip of it, it was lukewarm to cold so I asked the waitress for new one because it wasn't hot and she said their hot water machine broke and would warm it up. Seriously?? Big FAIL if a sushi restaurant cant get their tea right then you know the rest wont get any better. My bf and I ordered the small sushi combo for $24.99 and by the first bite we felt it didnt taste right, there was no flavour and the fish was not fresh. And what turned my appetite down even more was a piece of hair on one of the sushi pieces. I immediately complained to the waitress and she spoke to the manager about it whom said that he will give 50%off because the hair didnt touch the other pieces. Really?? Not even an apology or anything complimentary! This was by far the WORST experience ever! DO NOT waste your money here."}
{"text":"This place has gone through many different iterations since I've moved to 'Sauga.  It was Kobe Sushi, then Pad Thai and Sushi and is now called Zem-One and is more of a fusion style Asian food.  I'd like to call it Spring Rolls Jr.  

Order: lunch special - pad thai with soup and salad for $8.99 and spicy salmon sushi combo (with 6 pcs California roll) and soup and soup for $8.99

1. Pad thai - very good and much better than Spring Rolls 5/5
2. Spicy Salmon - not spicy and not much fish. 2/5

Service: 4/5 - very attentive 

Ambiance: 4/5

Value: 3/5

I found this very reasonable but the problem is that the combo's/lunch specials were not good value. I would expect for any combo around $9, that there should be tempura or glass noodles or some gyoza (dumplings).  I have no problem with the quality of this place but the value is not there because a Japanese box should include more than just soup and salad.

Luckily, I had a 10% discount because it was grand opening special, but if this price and value keeps up with the discount, rating might go down.  

If the owners are reading - add something to your specials so the meal is more filling!"}
{"text":"I've been holding off my review for this place in hopes that they were just trying to get their stuff together after a move, but after nearly a year, I think it's time to rate it.

I very much fancied this place when it was located on Hurontario.  Sure the place was often quiet and dead, but the food was consistently good, decor was nice, and the service was also fine.  And for that I would give it a 3.5 star rating (oh, how I wish Yelp had fraction ratings). 

After they moved to the village centre, things just seemed to fall apart.  I'm not sure whether it was a change in management or something, but in my opinion, it just wasn't a good move. 

The food is still relatively good, don't get me wrong.  But for the first time ever, I've been so off put by the decor/atmosphere that it's left an impression on me.  

The first thing you notice is that upon entering, you feel like you've entered from the wrong side of the restaurant.  No matter which side you come from, it feels like the entrance where there should be a 'please use other entrance' sign. The restaurant has a rough layout. It looks to me like they decided to open up a sushi restaurant in a previously owned fast food/takeout joint. Assets from what previously appeared to be sandwich/deli shop still remain, the sushi counter appears to be the counter where a cashier once to be,  boxes upon boxes are stacked around the restaurant, and the tables are all inconsistent, even going as far as high-elevated tables with matching bar chairs.  Also, from what I can tell from their menu, they also serve breakfast items, which from a strategic standpoint makes sense, as they're in the middle of a work complex, but detracts from an overall 'sushi' experience.

Our most recent experience, will most likely be our last.  I had heard that there was a roll they had created in conjunction with yelp (not too sure what that means), but it looked tasty: squid tempura roll with crab and their house sauce I believe.  Unfortunately, it was out of stock, along with some dumplings, a few appetizers, certain sushi rolls, and all but one ice cream flavour.  As mentioned previously, the food was decent. Sushi rolls were quite nice, and kitchen items were good, but wrongly portioned.  An order of fried rice was enough for about 4 people (aka a la carte portions), though it was just me and my partner. Same could be said with the chicken we ordered.  Wait staff was friendly enough.  

At the end of the day, I had really hoped that this place would take off.  But it seems like they had made a transition they weren't able to complete.  For the sake of the good food, I hope they're able to figure out something that could get them back on their feet.  Until then, I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Dined there and I must say it was the worst service ever, the prawn Manchurian was stale and they didn't give serving spoons with anything. The waitress brought cold chicken corn soup and dipped her thumb init, seriously bad. Also did a take-out one time for chicken corn soup, ordered a large and the serving was half that of what they give when u dine in, not enough for even 2 people, same with the chicken manchurian stale and mostly just sauce with 3 pieces of chicken. 
Take out from here definitely not a good idea"}
{"text":"i had such high hopes for this place and was so excited as it is one of the few halal sushi places around. My experience however was one of the worst experiences I've ever had at a restaurant. I went there with a group of 6 friends for iftaar we arrived at about 8:30pm. The only people who got a menu were the first two who arrived the rest of us had to get our own. We placed our orders about 15 minutes before iftaar but did not receive any food until 15 minutes after. Thank God they at least gave us water. We got about four of the rolls we ordered and a full 55 minutes later we still had not received half of our items. The servers however were very apologetic and kind even though they weren't good servers. This one server for example would come and put all the bowls of soup in front of me to pass around to the people who ordered them instead of giving them herself. We had to ask for basic things like a spoon for soup. We also asked for water refills and did not get them until about half an hour later. After we complained to the servers about our missing food they started sending out our orders. Unfortunately it was the sushi rolls we had already got. The staff although polite seem very unorganized and would bring out things/quantities we did not order. The sushi rolls were pretty good but they did not taste good enough to overcome the taste of bad service. The pad Thai we got smelled really awful nobody dared put it in their mouth. Some of my friends had some soup which they said was decent. finally after waiting we gave up and asked for our bills. We waited about half an hour and didn't get our bills so we went up to the register to pay so we could leave.  We asked to be billed a la carte since we did not get the majority of items but we were charged the ayce price with a $2 discount. I know I definitely won't be returning to this place any time soon. I do appreciate however that the staff was at least apologetic and did acknowledge the poor service. I also liked that they had prayer mats set up outside for people who needed to pray. Also would like to note that the restaurant was not busy, there were two other tables of groups inside and 2-3 tables outside. We also saw a table that arrived after us be served long before we were. Overall just disappointed as this is a great location, good sushi rolls and I think has a lot of potential."}
{"text":"I found the lunch price 15.99 weekdays and 17.99 on weekends a little pricey. But the food is good and service is getting better. I wish the menu was easier to understand. It is a bit confusing. They need to simplify the AYCE menu not just have one menu for both a la cart and AYCE."}
{"text":"Halal Meat is served here. Went here recently with party of 3 people. We decided to do the \"All You Can Eat\" price ($21.99 per person) since it was more affordable that way. We tried several of the sushi rolls, Pad Thai with chicken. Thai Mango with chicken, Mango Salad and Spring rolls. Everything was pretty good but the serving sizes were bit on the small side (another reason why AYCE option is better). The sushi rolls were very good quality. We also had fried banana with ice cream for dessert (it was ok). Service was friendly. Nice atmosphere. Good to have halal meat options at a sushi place."}
{"text":"Just moved into an office in the area, and am glad to have such a great restaurant at walking distance. Dynamite Shrimp roll is to die for, Tuna sandwich on bread is good and light. Butter chicken with rice is awesome when its on a daily special."}
{"text":"Good food, HORRIBLE SERVICE

Okay so we went for the all you can eat. First off they only brought half the things we ordered. Then they came for last call, we made an order, only to have the waitress come back 30 minutes later and say that the kitchen closed already. HOW DOES A KITCHEN CLOSE BEFORE LAST CALL?

Then we ordered dessert and were told that only ice cream is available. After ordering we were told we can only have one scoop each because they had to scoop it manually (as opposed to robots who scoop it for them automatically?)

Worst experience ever. Learn to treat customers with respect before serving tables. Tipped them 10 cents."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were very dissapointed with this place. We went for all you can eat during dinner, and we were not happy with the service at all. Our waitress always forgot our order, we had to keep reminding her and she would still forget our order. She didnt even come back to clear our table and give us the bill, we had to go up ourselves. The food did not seem fresh, and the dishes were very dirty. One thing that really put me off was the washroom.. It was filthy! I was to grossed out to stay in so I just left. Things like that always make me wonder.. If the place cant even keep the cutlery or washrooms clean, what makes you think the kitchen and food is clean? Just a heads up people, you can definitely go to a better restaurant."}
{"text":"So I went on a Monday, and honestly the sushi were not fresh compared to other places I've been, and also the chilli chicken was not good at all either, all the food were not great. They also don't have a lot of options for sushi without crabmeat. Maybe I went at a bad time. My favourite was only the desert which they probably bought off of some store and served it."}
{"text":"This is an interesting place to review.
When I ordered for delivery, their sushi was AMAZING and delicious, better than most take-out/delivery sushi. 
But for some reason when I eat in, and from most people I know that eat in...there is nothing but disappointment. What is up with that? It doesn't even make sense really. 
When you order for delivery, they even give you complimentary things and discounts. I can't explain...but so far it's been true every single time.
I think the major disappointment in this place is that even though it SEEMS like they got all kinda of crazy different rolls...it's actually pretty much all just California rolls with different things on top. The prices are also not too friendly."}
{"text":"I would give this 4.5 stars. SUSHI is good and fresh. I highly recommend the mississauga paradise. Never had any roll like it. Plus their general Tao is amazing. For my Muslims friend, this place is Halal so you can have the meat here"}
{"text":"Red Devil is the best roll you can have here... a bit pricey for the food... but All-You-Can-Eat deals are amazing..."}
{"text":"There are a lot of options on their menu. The first time I went I had teriyaki chicken and the second time I went I had sushi. 

The service is extremely slow. When I asked for my bill she served other people and then was standing by the sushi bar chatting with her coworker. Even though there was a long wait for my meal she offered me some miso soup salad for free. But that doesn't help when you have to get back to work though. Even though the service is slow, the waitress is nice enough. Dont go there if you have somewhere to be by a certain time after.

The teriyaka was lame and not well presented and the sushi was okay.

Id go again to try cold sushi bc there are so many options."}
{"text":"Tried twice but didn't feel the kick of freshness.
Also forgot the chopsticks in my delivery order 
And can someone plz tell me THAT WHY IS UR PRICE ON UBER DELIVERY MENU IS HIGHER THAN UR DAILY PRICES???"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but I really don't think it managed to wow me. 

We ordered some simple sushis (California Roll, Salmon Roll, and Spicy Tuna Roll), all of which were very standard. Nothing special.

We also ordered some soups. The chicken soup (I believe called \"Tom yum\" or something similar) came out fresh and piping hot, while the miso soup was disgustingly barely warm. This really bothered me because I'm a huge miso soup fan. When we asked the waitress about this, she offered to microwave it which I didn't feel was the right answer. 

Other dishes we ordered included some noodles (vegetable, chicken), and General Tso's chicken. Again, nothing stood out. Standard standard standard. 

The service was decent, but I feel that the place was understaffed. Our waitress was also everyone's waitress, and she was running around from table to table, and that made us feel uncomfortable to ask her for anything! 

In general, Zem One is a good place to get a halal fix of sushi. Although overpriced in my opinion, the sushi is halal, which is worth the extra money. Spare yourself the time and money and don't order anything other than sushi. I'd like to come back here for more sushi, but based on this experience, I probably won't be back for a while."}
{"text":"This is not the address of the store. They moved to square one and it's not stated anywhere. Once we were able to find the place it was highly disorganized, took way too long for our food, and the tables and booths were very uncomfortable and awkward. Cheapest furniture I've ever experienced. Did not have a good time. Probably won't go back."}
