{"text":"I NEVER thought I'd say that a pizza from a GAS STATION is the best in town...but there you have it.  It really is--hands down.  The crust is PERFECT: yeasty, with just the right amount of chew.  It's not greasy, like some of the OTHER establishments in town, and the toppings are first-rate.  No delivery, but I prefer carry-out anyway.  And so it was that I found one of my favorite pizza places--right here in DeFo!"}
{"text":"(This is only regarding their Casey's Made to Order Pizza)  The Taco Pizza is AMAZING. For a large Taco pizza, it costs about $16 bucks. It's HUGE and has about 5 times as many toppings as any other pizza joint I've ever eaten at. The price is so fair for what you get and it tastes great for just a \"Gas Station Pizza.\"  Seriously, people, try it. It doesn't look like you'll have a good time getting gas...but at least get a pizza!"}
{"text":"I buy gas from here all the time. Now all of a sudden today they take a $75 hold on my account after I already pay for my gas and it's taking me calling corporate and my bank to get my money back. Never happened before but I bet I won't be buying shit else from them."}
{"text":"3:24 PM in the afternoon. A line almost out the door, and one slow cashier.   Decided to leave rather than make a purchase."}
{"text":"Strike 3 and you are out! I have ordered pizza from this place for the very last time. They brought an incorrect order the last 2 times. This time, my third and last, the order taker seemed to doubt that I had a coupon?  What the heck...hassling me about coupons!?  And then hang up angry on me? Like I am bad for having a coupon...come on man!  I will be shocked if the pizza even arrives.  Do yourself a favor, avoid being treated like a thief because you have a coupon...get your pie elsewhere."}
{"text":"After moving to Wisconsin from Iowa I was afraid there would be a shortage of Casey's. Well, I was correct in my assumption, but I an super happy about there being a Casey's close by in DeForest. The pizza is incredible, the breakfast pizza is even better. Just wish there were more a lot more Casey's around."}
{"text":"Listen.  Casey is on my last nerve.  The taco pizza is so nasty.  You can order pizza for delivery- if you are that sad of a person- but the delivery drivers are like deadbeat dads.  They rarely show up when they say they will, if they do show up the are usually over an hour late, they ask for money for something stupid- like their taco pizza-yuck."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town but you have to pick it up.  Hut is so boring and Pizza Pit closed.  Kind of wierd that the best pizza in toen is from a gas station but it is good!"}
{"text":"The absolute best breakfast pizza I've ever had and from a gas station! Staff is friendly. Easily the best pizza in deforest. I know they do or did deliver but Iive to far out. Worth the drive for pickup though. Gas is always a bit better than the stations near the highway as well."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever! It's beyond good! I'd pick this pizza over pizza hut, Dominos and papa johns! It's the best!"}
{"text":"This location sucks.  They continue to count change incorrectly and I'm was still waiting for them to figure out why they can't get me added their computer to order pizza.  I won't be going to this location or any other caseys ever again."}
{"text":"Stopped in only to fill the tank.  Quick and easy access.  No problems with the gas station part."}
{"text":"This is absolutely the best pizza in DeForest. Everyone there is always super friendly too!"}
{"text":"So this is a typical gas station store with pizza food service. I know I'm not all that smart with food items, but I felt sorely disappointed with the word \"ground beef\" as one of the toppings for their specialty taco pizza. I was expecting the type of meat that you'd see in a taco at Taco Bell, but all I got was sausage. I definitely felt lied to; the website should have just said it had sausage in it. Not only that but they were five minutes late with my order. The only good thing about this place is that they put a lot of toppings on your pizza. I also really wanted to get some donuts, but they had such a bleak and paltry selection that I passed on it."}
{"text":"Having just moved to the area, Casey's has been such an amazing place to have available.  They truly have a little bit of everything available 24 hours a day.  Everybody who works here has always been so friendly and helpful. Their pizza is also really, really, really good.  It's my favorite so far in the area.  Who would've thought???  We have only done carry out up to this point, but they do now offer delivery.  Delivery hours are 4:30 p.m. - 10 p.m. There is a delivery fee of $2 per order with a minimum purchase of $10 required. Forms of payment accepted include major credit cards, cash and check."}
