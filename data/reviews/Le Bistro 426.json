{"text":"Just awful!!!
Avoid this place at all cost. The food was horrible. The margarita pizza, which was supposed to have tomatoes and fresh mozzarella was in fact a burned cheese pizza with no toppings. This place seems like a temporary joint run by teenagers/young adults who are trying to make easy money on tourists who fall for the nice location of this place."}
{"text":"Weird thing is that I didn't find a single reference to this restaurant anywhere on the web other than on a Canadian jobs website... it is located on a very touristy area of Old Montreal and I've got a feeling that it is a \"pop up\" type of place that just opens during tourist season. It straddles two other inside food establishments on the open spaces around Place Jacques-Cartier, which is always humming with people, street musicians, etc. And for that it is good, as one can grab a bite, drink a brew and watch the people strolling up and down the esplanade.

It's aimed at tourists, and that's OK.

I was tempted by a happy hour promise of \"two for one\" for drinks, so we went in, grabbed a table (they're all outside), ordered a draft beer (5.95$) - and got two - and an antipasto (16.95$).

When it was delivered, as there was no bread, I asked for some, and re-learned the lesson to always ask the price of things... all together I had the beers (5.95$) + the antipasto (16.95$) + bread (???) + a glass of apple juice (????) and somehow my bill escalated to 32$ after the massive Canadian taxes on everything that moves... tip was not part of this huge price hike... but we all learn.

Anyway, the one star rating is based on the antipasto (the service was great and all the really pretty young wait staff seemed to be very efficient and friendly)... but back to the antipasto...

This was perhaps the oddest antipasto that I have ever consumed.... it consisted of:

- two pieces of sausage (bland, but OK)
- six black olives
- two slices of cucumber
- two pieces of tomatoes
- assorted canned mushrooms
- pickled white eggplant
- two slices of mortadella
- two slices of some other deli meat
- four pieces of bruschetta

Feh!"}
{"text":"Simply the worst meal I have ever had.  I ordered an old fashioned, which did not taste anything like any drink I have ever had.  My wife ordered a dry martini which tasted of lemon liqueur and definitely had no vodka in it.

Steak frites was absolutely crap, over cooked and a horrible cut.  Salad Nicolas definitely had canned tuna in it.  Even the fries were terrible.

Salmon tartare was edible.  Escargot had more cheese on it than a cup of Onion soup.

Server could not secure the wine I ordered.  Brought a bad Pinot noir from USA, I reiterated my order, he sought it, nope, ordered a different one, nope, brought back the American Pinot, we drank it, than he tried to charge us for the most expensive bottle they had to offer.  

All that it to say, this was the worst meal I have ever had."}
