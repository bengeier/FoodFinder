{"text":"Un accueil bien que tiède mais sans le mélodrame éperdument blasé. Nous étions des convives du brunch dont le menu se précise en un abécédaire illustré. 

Le Bénédicte à la florentine se défini à l'aisément sans l'esthétique attitré du paprika. Le plat ''2 ufs et saucisses'' est accompagné de rôtis et de patates. Celles-ci sont râpées et cuites en hash Brown et non rissolées. Nous avions été servis en moins de 10 minutes. Un service rapide sans être précipité par un volume de clients excessif."}
{"text":"Steak, meh. Pizza, meh. Veal, meh. Every time I go to this place they only deliver mediocre dishes. I once ordered a pina colada which tasted medicinal and slimy. It happened that their pina coladas are the pre-made ones that are sold in grocery stores. Kind of disappointing."}
{"text":"Very decent Italian restaurant. Good for kids as well with their kids menu, relatively quick and decent service"}
{"text":"Acceptable food and price, but probably won't go back. Their pasta was really average but salad is decent, the price is fair for me."}
{"text":"I rarely go for italian food as I always get disappointed. Only Italy did not disappoint me. Well I gave it a try again and Marcello did not do it for me. please note that I am very picky when t comes to Italian food.
Service was excellent, entree was also excellent. Portobello mushrooms with cheese and peppers. Highly recommend. 
My main meal was veal with lemon. Was just OK meat a little rubbery and Napolitana pasta just OK. I needed to put a lot of chilly to get some taste....I am just not a pasta guy. SORRY!!!"}
