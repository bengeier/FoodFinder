{"text":"I had the sandwiches at Vienna Lux many times and really enjoyed the food. Unfortunately Vienna Lux closed, for whatever reason, a couple months ago and re-opened as \"That Schnitzel Place\" this week.  I tried out the new place today and I was quite disappointed with the sandwich. I had a pork La Dolce Vita and it was not even close to being as good as what was offered previously at Vienna Lux. The pork was much thinner and smaller and the breading was not as good. I may be wrong but it seemed like the pork was breaded with Panko, which I normally like but it wasn't what I was expecting in this case. There was a lack of cheese and a lack of sauce on the sandwich. I also asked for no onions but the cook made a mistake and put onions on it anyways.   The bread was quite good though.  The price seemed quite high at $10 and I think the old Vienna Lux was a much better value.   It's a shame that Vienna Lux was replaced with this. I'd like to have the old Vienna Lux back."}
{"text":"Schnitzel sandwich made me wish for a bigger stomache.  The bun (fresh, moist and soft!) is about 6\" arond, and the schnitzel pokes out of two ends.  I added mushrooms and sauerkraut on mine, the sauerkraut on a recommendation from my friend.  With the sauce that comes with every sandwich, it made for a very yummy sandwich.  Only ate half, ate the other half for dinner.  The bun was not so fresh after reheat, but still a really good satisfying meal.  Only disappointment was there was no apple struedel that day, which I had heard a lot about.    New place, very clean.  The lady who runs it is extremely friendly and very kind. Service was fast as food freshly made.  Will definitely go back for the Schnitzel, hope apple struedel is there."}
{"text":"If you're looking for the biggest schnitzel sandwiches that you've had in your life, you've found 'em. I had the chicken schnitzel for lunch and I couldn't even finish it. It was extremely good though.   The sandwiches are made on a freshly baked bun and all of the schnitzel's (wiener, chicken or pork) have their homemade tomato sauce and either medium or hot peppers. They also serve a great beef sandwich, a \"Blue Danube\" (pork, ham, cheese) and a fried eggplant sandwich.   At only $6.95 each (with a ton of toppings included), it's well worth it.    Here's the full menu: http://www.viennalux.ca/"}
{"text":"Schnitzel schnitzel and more schnitzel!  Vienna Lux is a charming Austrian restaurant/cafe tucked into the bottom of a downtown apartment complex. While the drab exterior of the building and the large vinyl sign with the Vienna Lux logo and slogan \"Always Hot and Juicy\" may not be appetizing to all, the food is.  Schnitzel sandwiches are the core of the menu here and there's pork, veal, chicken, the Kaiser beef and, for vegetarians, eggplant.  We tried a sandwich, salad and soup of the day (curried cauliflower) and were impressed.  The sandwiches are the size of a children's football and are stacked with as many toppings (most are free) on a soft, fresh kaiser roll. The soup was fragrant and was redolent of curry without being overpowering. The salad with a vinaigrette, while simple, was fresh and clean.  Vienna Lux also offers beer ($5.95 domestic and $6.95 import including Guinness!) but sadly doesn't have any Austrian beer (yet).  Our meal was filling and fantastic. Also, affordable as all the sandwiches are $6.95, as is the huge bowl of soup and salad.  If you're in the area Vienna Lux makes a great stop for quick lunch, though they're also open for dinner.  I have a feeling Vienna Lux will do for Austrian food what Jonas did for Hungarian."}
{"text":"2nd trip to Vienna Lux - Had the Kaiser - Tender chunks of beef with green peppers in a delicious sauce, topped with sauerkraut and sauted onions.  So goood!  I like it!  Dessert - Chocolate Muffin with Fruit and Cognac and the best Apple Pie I've ever had!  Yum!"}
