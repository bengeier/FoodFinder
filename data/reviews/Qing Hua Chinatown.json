{"text":"Super tasty and fresh, broth inside every bite, some of Montreal's best dumplings."}
{"text":"Always will come back here regardless of the horrible service. It's so bad it's almost a necessary aspect to the experience, I might even be disappointed if a dumpling night wasn't paired with a bully of a waitress who makes you feel as though you are doing her a tremendous disservice by ordering anything at all. The dumplings are good though, both fried and steamed, get pork shrimp leek or one of the lamb ones. All in all its kind of a gamble some times better and some times worse, sometimes soupy sometimes dry, but the service never fails to be terrible. I still love this place :)"}
{"text":"I went here after hearing good things about the place. The first thing I noted was that the place was crowded yet the restaurant is clean. After quickly going through the menu, I slightly disappointed to see that only dumplings were on the menu (meaning no side dishes or noodle with dumplings). We ordered the pork/shrimp and the pork/mushroom, both steamed. Service was quick and prompt. You can see the chefs in the back folding the dumplings. When the food came, the dumplings were still steaming. The pork/mushroom was very flavorful, with the soup providing a lot of flavor. The pork/shrimp was also pretty good. However, there was barely any shrimp and they were very small. Overall, if you want soup dumplings and only that at a reasonable price, this is your place."}
{"text":"I've been to Qing Hua a couple of times because the dumplings are excellent. No complaint there: they're cheap and delicious. However, the service has been consistently terrible: very slow and inattentive.  Today was the final straw. I went out to dinner in a group of eight. It took them ten minutes to take our order, and another thirty before anyone was served. I ordered boiled bok choi dumplings with mushroom. 

My order never came. Ten minutes after everyone else was served, I asked a waitress what had happened to my order of boiled vegetable dumplings. She replied that they were unable to make boiled vegetable dumplings, as they exploded in the pot of water(?). Apparently, the waitress who'd taken my order didn't know this, and no one had bothered to tell me that I had ordered something un-cookable. I decided to not eat anything rather than risk another forty minute wait. 

Conclusion: probably the most incompetent customer service I've ever experienced. Although the dumplings are tasty, I will not be returning. 

P.S. Why can a dumpling restaurant not manage to make boiled veggie dumplings?"}
{"text":"Their dumplings are really really good. They're so good that my sister who lives two hours away from Montreal always buys about 200 of their frozen dumplings before going back to her place.

The one star off is because their water sometimes tastes really funky, which makes me wonder about the hygiene of the place. But hey, you don't come to Chinatown for food prepared in a sterile environment (and I'm sulking at you, Qing Hua dumplings, for not being ready to open exactly 11am on that day when I was craving your dumplings to death, and making me wait for about 20 minutes!)"}
{"text":"Oh. My. God. Unreal. Every dumpling I have tried is amazing. I dream about these dumplings. My mouth is watering just thinking about them. Lamb and cucumber. Yes. i have nothing bad to say."}
{"text":"J'avais une rage de dumping et elle a été bien assouvie. Ce n'est vraiment pas les meilleurs dumpling que j'ai mangé mais c'est loin d'être les pires.
Je ne conseille pas les frits, il n'était vraiment pas génial et seulement grillé d'un côté.
Difficile d'y aller avec une poussette."}
{"text":"Food: In a place like MTL where \"authentic\" Chinese food is scarce, Qing Hua deserve an applause. I would give them 4-stars just because of the food. Yes it's not perfect but hey, probably one of the best ??? here~ Flavorful, juicy and always HOT when it comes (so important for dumplings!! +10 points!!) because dumplings are to be eaten hot! (Golden rule hihi) 

Service: Euh... I guess here we have to use a little Chinese magic? We do the Chinese ways, ask, ask and ask again or you will never get what you want ^___^

Price: very good quality/price ratio~

Ambiance: Like most of Chinese restaurant in the area, we go for food only, not a place to linger to talk about your life, at least clean, that's the most important thing here~"}
{"text":"The photo says it all. If you are a fan of dumplings, this is the place for you! Our meal came out hot and steaming, just watch out for the juice in the dumplings as it has a tendency to squirt out. In terms of the other reviews on here, I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised at hot clean this place was. As for the service, well, this is chinatown. It doesn't matter what city you are in, chinatown is chinatown. Dial down the expectations and you'll do just fine."}
{"text":"five stars easily for the dumplings and the service. Got beef/curry and pork/scallion, both fried. They weren't greasy though, just delicious. We came all the way from NY for the jazz festival and after having the dumplings would seriously consider coming up just for that."}
{"text":"Found this place a few months ago and haven't been dissatisfied yet
Delicious steamed dumplings; especially the pork ones. 
Pros: restaurant's nice and clean; friendly service
Cons: Not a great place if you're short on time; slightly slow service but that's only cause the dumplings are made fresh"}
{"text":"Affordable dumplings in Chinatown which came  prepared with soup inside. Atmosphere was no-frills and felt a bit dated.  Service could have been a bit more attentive."}
{"text":"Why is this place empty??? Chicken ones were good, but the Cha-Qing flavor comes from the pork! Anything pork was just oozing with liquid. Literally, you'd take a bite and juices will spew across the table and hit your friend in the eye! 

Don't waste it on your friend's eye or on your plate! Instead, ask for a spoon, place the sack on the spoon and take a tiny first bite - eat it xiao long bao style. The soup in the sack will spill into your spoon waiting for you to slurp it up! Now they do have XLBs, but don't waste your money on those. You get only 6 as opposed to 15, and they are not even close to the world renowned XLBs of Din Tai Fung. I put them on a pedestal so not even gonna compare (even though I am).

Minus a star cuz the moody waitress was un attentive. We looked at her three times (and she did make eye contact each time) before she finally came and took our order. Just because she was cold, she wasn't gonna come between me and my delicious dumplings!"}
{"text":"The place definitely looks very clean and proper. The staff is nice... So that's a good start. 

Now onto the food.  We ordered only dumplings so I can only comment on that. When the dumplings arrive fresh (about 15 dumplings per order), you should be cautious when biting because they are super hot and quite juicy. The anything curry dumplings are best fried. 

However, after the dumplings  cool  off, they're less juicy and after the 3rd dumpling, you really taste the dough. For others, it might not be a problem, but I like the dough to be a bit thinner so I can taste more of the inside. 

It's good.. But not the best that I've had. And if they didn't have deals on dealfind, I might not have returned since there are better dumpling places not too far for roughly the same price."}
{"text":"The food was good - probably worth more than the one star that I'm giving the restaurant.

Service was horrible. Waited half an hour to order ( we had to go and find a waitress ), then they were rude when taking our order, and then took forever to get us our check. Server wouldn't bring the check so my dad went up to the front desk; then they made my dad go back to the table to bring him the check but they never came with the check, so he ended up going back to the front again.

Now, don't get me wrong. I'm used to less-than-stellar service at Chinese restaurants but this was truly one of the worst. Worse than in China, which can get pretty bad.  I like food but not enough to tolerate this experience. I am leaving this angry review as   I'm leaving bc I'm so upset by the service."}
{"text":"heard people talking about this for quite a while. today passing by Chinatown.
the pork dumplings we ordered were ok but the service was uhhhh......"}
{"text":"Wonderful, authentic, the real thing, no bullshit. Very original with taste mixing inside dumplings. The easy going service is what makes this place so special and conformable. 
Cucumber cold salad Is amazing."}
{"text":"Pretty solid soup dumplings, and definitely worth the price, but I prefer the location on Lincoln."}
{"text":"Excellent dumplings with soup inside. Dough is a little tough once the dumplings coil down."}
{"text":"In short, 

Great food! Even better prices! (10ish dollas fo 15 pieces of dumplings) 

I didn't like that they only had 2 employees for the whole place (which was packed 30+ peeps)

I have a thing for washrooms and this washroom passed my minimum standard level. 

Menu had a large variety (chicken, pork, shrimp, beef, lamb) and a variety of mixes with different veggies."}
{"text":"VERY BAD PLACE!! DON'T GO THERE. First of all, me and my girlfriend are very patient and we understand lot of problems since we both work in customer service and study business.  We arrived at the restaurant at 7:55 and got seated right away. Right away, we didn't like our table because of a group of 4 people screaming near us. Also, we were put in table for 6 people with half of it already taken. Then, we had to ask the server 2 times to take our order. After 25 minutes, she took our order. She also had the time to receive an order of 2 jugs of beer 10 minutes from each appart and serve it. We assume we would get the food quickly as the table of screaming monkeys got 60 dumplings in less then 15 minutes and we ordered 30. 20 minutes later, she comes back to us saying that half of our order wasnt possible due to lack of stock. No prob, but she should know before asking us what we want. Lack of communication. She puts back our order in the last spot (she should of put it back where it was in the order, how dump is that) Now, there were people that came in 20-30 minutes after us, that started to receive their food. After waiting for another 30 minutes, we had to complain at the cashier that it has been 50 minutes and nothing yet for us while people there 20-30 minutes after us are almost done eating. She cames back 5 minutes later saying that every thing will be ready in 6 minutes. LIE. Half of it came in after 12 minutes (They were on the clock). Food came in. IT WAS BARELY COOKED PROPERLY.  Shrimps inside were transparent (meaning not cook) and the skin of the dumplings were still half frozen. To sum up, cashier wasn't even respectful enough to ask me where I sat and tell me the amount to pay. First time I've  left no tip at a restaurant. We got out at 10 pm very mad.As we left. there were 5 people waiting in line. when clearly there were enough (emptied) tables to accomodate."}
{"text":"I had a very mediocre lunch with my Chinese wife, and decided not to go back. Then a Beijinger-experts on dumplings-said, \"pretty good dumplings-acceptable by Chinese standards-mabye best in Montreal\". So i went back without my wife. Someone posted a review a year or so ago saying that the food was going downhill. I visited the Chinatown location for lunch today upon my Beijing friends recommendation.

I LIKED IT-

GOOD: I had the lamb dumplings-excellent dough. Insides were a little bit low quality ingredients. I loved the springy texture of the dough wrappings very much. The pickled daikon before the meal was good and fresh, and lightly pickled in a pleasant way. I loved that the food is made to order. Dovetails with my sensiblities

BAD: The soup-free with the lunch-was miso based soup-not Chinese-but Japanese. Very very bad quality compared to real Japanese miso soup, but I tend to by hypercritical when people try to replicate cuisine of another culture sloppily. Real miso soup is wonderful and healthy. This was not that. I am not even sure if they used dashi or even instant dashi mix. Dashi is such an amazing and magical basis for Japanese food. But I don't usually love it when without rhyme or reason, a Japanese dish shows up in a Chinese restaurant.

If I go back for dinner, I want to try the bones with brown sauce-what a name-I suspect it's oxtail with a hong shao style sauce, but I will drag my wife in and find out. I love well prepared Chinese take on braised oxtail.

The 4 star rating would be about 1  star lower in New York or Toronto.  But here in Quebec, it's nice to have acceptable Chinese food.  Also, when I first went to Qing Hua it was the Lincoln street location.  I noticed that the riviews for the Chinatown location are much lower-so perhaps when I took my wife here, it was bad because it was bad.  I think that they have resolved their problems and this place seems very good now.  Go."}
{"text":"TAKE OUT

This is the first time visiting Montreal and in their Chinatown. The food was ready quick. I've tried many homemade steamed pork and cabbage dumplings but cooked good ones are hard to come by. They were juicy. It came with 15 pieces with separate sauce to dip in for $8.50. I notice only 1 other dumpling spot in the area and this was the best option. The pickled cucumber were delicious. It had red flakes but was not spicy at all. It had a sweet taste to it.

They only take cash. They accept U.S. dollar but you would end up paying more since they won't convert it for you. The staff speak English and Mandarin here."}
{"text":"Had fried tofu dumplings that were a bit boring for my taste. Tried some vegetarian cabbage dumplings also and liked them better. Still not a big fan. Surprisingly, the dessert cheesecake was a perfect ten, even better than at many places that specialize in pastries and cakes! The combination of chocolate crust and cream cheese was divine. Gotta go back for the cake."}
{"text":"Pretty sure I got food poisoning from either their spicy tofu or there chili sauce on the table."}
{"text":"I had totally forgotten that Qing Hua had a Chinatown location until I found myself in Chinatown one Saturday afternoon with a rumbling stomach.  I had originally set my sights on some ramen, but when I saw the happy little dumpling logo of Qing Hua I quickly changed my mind.

I found the dumplings themselves to be on par with those of the Lincoln location: excellent!  The space itself is really nice, big and airy.  The walls have what look like carved stone decoration.  It was a nice change from the Lincoln location, which is more like a cosy little cave.  I could see myself coming here with a group of people and sharing steamer tray upon steamer tray of dumplings.

Of note: this location also does frozen dumplings to take home like the Lincoln branch.  Not quite as good as having them in the restaurant, but a welcome weeknight dinner solution when you don't feel like cooking, and only have to pull them out of your freezer and steam them up."}
{"text":"Since our first choice for dumplings was closed, we decided to stop in here. Upon entrance, the establishment was quiet with an employee passed out on the table. Sprawled across the table, the day must have taken its toll...I have to admit, it was pretty hot that day.  

As we awkwardly stood at the entrance, another employee came from the kitchen and directed us to our seats lol. Once seated, menus and water was provided. Dehydrated, I drank the water in one shot, but refills are hard to come by unless you ask, which I made sure to do so! 

As we reviewed our options, you get three choices on how you get your dumplings served: steamed, boiled or pan-fried. We settled on steamed pork/leek dumplings and per our server's recommendation, pan-fried lamb/leek dumplings. She said it's her preference and that it's popularly served that way. Okay, sure! to balance the amount of meats, we also got a cucumber salad on the side. 

Portion servings for the dumplings are plenty. There's about 12 dumplings each and they are filled with a decent amount of meat with some soup. Definitely eat with caution since the soup will spray everywhere if you don't, which just leaves you a hot mess. 

If you like the flavor of lamb, you'll appreciate this one since it distinctively tastes of lamb. The pan-fried dumplings had a nice seared bottom, but it didn't have the crisp texture I was hoping for. Regardless, they were really good.

Condiments are provided on the table, but it's just soy sauce, black vinegar and chili oil. I was hoping for the chili paste since I think that would have been more suitable to my preferences, but the ginger from the marinated cucumber salad (similar to that of cucumber kimchi) provided a bit of the heat I was looking for. 

Overall, the meal was great, but not the best. Service was a tad slow, but we also came through during an off time, which was right around 4-5pm. What I do appreciate is the portion in comparison to price. Two sets of dumpling was a little much, but one would have not been enough. Come hungry."}
{"text":"We ordered the hot and sour soup, it was luke warm and cloudy looking. Didn't taste good. we order shrimp dumplings and after about 10 minutes received our order, but it was pork. My girlfriend doesn't eat pork. The waitress then asked the other table if we could switch, but they had already started eating. Then she came back and asked if we wanted to just keep it and pay for the pork ones still. WTH! Couldn't believe it. Then I had to speak to the manager, he had no idea what I was talking about. Plus no one spoke English. I'm Korean, and this is ridiculous. Horrible service plus no English is just hell for a restaurant."}
{"text":"went to have cheap lunch, since it's known that they have a veeeery good deal.

6.99$ for 15 dumplings, juicy soup coming out each bite, 3 choices in cooking way(steamed, fried, boiled), simple system, simple service, fortune cookie in the end. 

i feel comfortable there, as if i was back in Asia. seeing ladies making dumplings inside, workers having fun in Chinese, waiter can leave us alone, always cheap...i'll come back when i miss it."}
{"text":"Sometimes it takes 30mins to even an hour to receive dumplings... BUT worth it. Best dumplings in Chinatown for sure."}
{"text":"Pour apprécier un restaurant chinois, souvent il faudra fermer les yeux sur la qualité du service, la salubrité des lieux ou le décor. Ici, on y va pour la nourriture et le faible coût des repas. 

Ceux avec des crevettes apportent une texture intéressante. Ceux au curry apporte un gout qui fait changement. Sinon, je trouve qu'il est difficile de gouter la différence entre toutes les variantes de porc, sauf ceux aux champignons. 

J'ai essayé presque tous les restaurants de dumplings possibles et je retourne le plus souvent à ce restaurant. Qing Hua a 2 succursales sous le nom de Qing Hua (quartier chinois et proche métro Guy-Concordia) et une autre sous le nom Sammi Soupe. Le goût des dumplings du restaurant Mai Xiang Yuan est semblable. Mai Xiang Yuan a également une succursale dans le quartier chinois et un sur ste-catherine Ouest. J'ai également gouté à Trilogie que j'ai apprécié, mais pas autant que ceux-ci."}
{"text":"Finally - Yelp has the St. Laurent one.  As of last Saturday no one had it.  My sister and I went from hungry to fangry (f*cking angry hungry) all because we couldn't find the Chinatown location of Qing Hua.

We Yahoo'd, we Googled, we Yelped and we Urban Spooned.  Nothing.

So my sister called the Lincoln location.  Finally, we find it.  It's just south of Rue de la Gauchetière above a Korean restaurant called Chez BONG. 

This one is cleaner but service is bad. My sister warned me, but that doesn't mean I was going to take it lying down.  No, that's why I'm mentioning it here.  In fairness, I get it, they make the dumplings when you order them.  In fact, three women are back there stuffing, pinching, steaming, and frying.  But how does that explain the fact I didn't get more napkins when I asked - twice.  I finally went and got them myself.  

We had the steamed pork and shrimp and the fried pork and celery.  It's an extra 50 cents to fry them?!?

We demolished 30 greasy little pockets of goodness. The dumplings were hot, fresh, and tasty, although a little pricey.  They`re not quite like the Shanghai ones I love; the skin is thicker and it's not so much a soup dumpling as it is a dumpling with some soup.

I learned a valuable lesson though, no matter what Canadian city I'm in, I don't like Chinatown.  Service is always you do, not they do."}
{"text":"Best dumplings you could find in Montreal.  The menu seems changed recently with more choices."}
{"text":"Was told the wait should be 15-20 minuets but it ended up  be 45 minutes wait to get the food on the table. Not coming back again!"}
{"text":"Not bad, but not good either. The food took over an hour to arrive, and the fillings tasted as if the ingredients were not very fresh. Even then, the flavors were not too bad, so it could've been much better on another day.

Knowing how cheap it is to make dumplings, I am quite amazed at how much they charge you, when it is advertised as a one-dollar-sign restaurant. I would have to spend closer to 20-25$ to be full after eating here."}
{"text":"Very good, but when the table next to us did not finish their delicious looking dumps the waitress did not deliver their leftovers to us upon request"}
{"text":"My soup dumpling cherry has burst! My girlfriend says these are better than the ones in NYC, more flavor in the meat filling and the broth. Don't put the whole thing in your mouth or you will burn a new hole!

We ordered the pork and shrimp dumplings, which were about 15 piping hot beauties for $11. You can watch the ladies making dumplings in real-time so you know these puppies are fresh!"}
{"text":"I have rarely been disappointed by a dumpling joint but this one somehow found a way. I waited a full hour before my food arrived and the service was terrible. 

The food wasn't anything impressive for the wait. The lychee drink is also very disappointing for the price.

The Qing Hua near Downtown is miles better."}
{"text":"Overall, I'd say not the best dumplings in Chinatown, not even the best dumplings on the street.  Maybe it's a personal preference thing, but I don't like that the dumplings drip soup/water."}
{"text":"dumpling love; wash em down with an ice-cold tsingtao = happiness. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This second time I been here. The food quality goes down a lot. The dumping stuffing is dry and no juicy unlike the first time I ate here."}
{"text":"Reasonably good dumplings horrible service and they seem to have loads of difficulty getting orders correct. No matter the language used. Ordered one large soup and received four. Took nearly 2 hours to get lunch. I'd go elsewhere."}
{"text":"C'était un 2e choix vu que l'endroit où je voulais aller était fermé mais je m'attendais quand même à mieux. 
D'abord, le service laisse vraiment à désirer. Les serveurs nettoient les tables plutôt que de prendre notre commande et lorsque l'on obtient enfin leur attention, ils laissent les verres en pile, ne servent pas l'eau, déposent les couverts et ustensiles sur un coin de la table ou encore nous servent les entrées avant les baguettes donc impossible de les manger en attendant les dumplings. 
Nous avons commandé des dumplings au porc, crevettes et coriandre vapeur qui étaient bons et d'autres porc et champignons frits qui m'ont beaucoup moins plût. On ne sentait pas vraiment le goût ni la texture des champignons et le dessous était sec au lieu d'être croustillant. 
J'ai aussi essayé les concombres marinés qui avaient clairement commencé à fermenter vu la texture et le pétillant...
Je crois sans aucun doute qu'il y a mieux dans le quartier chinois."}
{"text":"We ordered two dumpling dishes - pork and shrimp dumplings are great......lots of soup and you can bite anywhere on the dumpling to get the soup (most xiao long baos...you suck the soup from the little opening at the top and if you bite into it, most likely you will get squirted with soup but not the Qing Hua dumplings).  Also ordered tofu with mixed vegetables dumpling which had no soup and is somewhat bland."}
{"text":"Best dumplings in Montreal. Bad, unfriendly and lazy service, but excellent and cheap dumplings made right."}
{"text":"The dumplings were very tasty, juicy on the inside, great flavors. We ordered boiled pork+cabbage which were a bit bland and hard to handle, but steamed pork+cilantro were amazing. We also got the cucumber salad (vinegary and a little spicy) which was delicious.

The quality+quantity/price ratio was great, considering we paid ~8$ for 15 dumplings, which was more than enough to fill us up.

Only con, I've found the service a little slow and tone-deaf. Even as a francophone trying to speak understandable French we were coerced into speaking English, which, even as a bilingual, I find rude. The waitress came within a minute to take our order, we weren't ready, and then getting her back took maybe 10 minutes despite repeated eye-contacts. When it came to paying, we just stood up and went to the till.

Pros: Flavor, quantity, price
Cons: Service

I'd go back for the food despite the service. Hopefully they can improve. I will try the other dumpling spots though."}
{"text":"Service is a only a tad bit better than the Lincoln location. The big difference between the two locations is that It's cleaner and more new looking. What I did NOT appreciate was how misleading the waitress was. I asked how many were there for the fried oysters which was 5.99 or 4.99 (something like that). She said 4. When we received the oysters it was two \"large\" fried oysters. I was wondering where are the 4? So she waitress came back and told us it was 4 SMALL oysters and since they only had large ones they gave us 2 large ones. Um...ok? So why did you say 4 oysters in the first place. In general the service was ok, not as atrocious as the Lincoln location. dumplings are really juicy and I like them. But....misleading waitress = big no no,."}
{"text":"The dumplings were amazing, I'd give it 5 stars if it hadn't taken 40 minutes to get them. That being said, definitely give it a try, they may have just been running slow when I went."}
{"text":"The order:
Broth/boullion filled steambuns (soup dumplings? - the lady called them steambuns and had no clue what soup dumplings were, but they're dumpling-like imo)
Pork & shrimp dumplings
Lamb & cilantro dumplings
Won Ton soup

The verdict:
I absolutely loved the steambuns, the chicken broth inside them was very flavourful, and it was overall a treat to eat. 
Both the dumplings were rather disappointing in my opinion, maybe they wouldn't have been if I hadn't discovered Mai Xiang Yuan first..but I did..and they're MUCH better there.
The soup was meh, unfortunately, the dumplings had a really small amount of stuffing and the broth was pretty \"run of the mill\". 
There was also a chili oil/sauce provided with the aforementioned, but neither me nor the husband liked it much, it had an odd sweetness to it.

So will I go back (to either location)?
I will, for the soup-buns/dumplings/whatever, for the dumplings I'll stick to my much loved Mai Xiang Yuan."}
{"text":"J'ai toujours ma commande assez rapidement, il y en a beaucoup pour un prix plus que raisonnable (je fini souvent par prendre le reste pour emporter) et le goût des dumplings est excellent. Ce petit bijou de quartier mérite un \"rating\" clairement plus haut!

En temps normal, je suis plutôt \"picky\" sur ce qui est question de propreté, et je dirais que l'ensemble me satisfait par contre il m'est déjà arrivé d'avoir des baguettes/ustensiles pas complètement propres... J'en ai demandé des nouvelles et le \"problème\" était réglé."}
{"text":"Told to come here by various sources for their fresh dumplings handmade. Severely disappointed. Came by and the waiters and waitresses talked for quite a while before noticing we were standing there in our coats waiting to be seated...

When ordering, they were missing most of the things on the menu; mind you we came at noon when you should be completely stocked. 

We got shrimp and tofu dumplings pan fried. Dumplings were okay, yes the dough was amazing and chewy but I've had better. I had expected a chinatown dumpling place to be more authentic."}
{"text":"I'm a dumpling enthusiast, and Qing Hua is a new favourite. It's super cheap, and there are large quantities. The quality of the food is top notch, yet the service was atrociously slow. Expect to wait a while when ordering your food, but I assure you you'll forget about it as soon as you taste their soup dumplings."}
{"text":"Love their dumplings but the old waiter is too weird always hitting on girls including me and even when I went with my boyfriend. So I stopped going. Their homemade noodles dish is pretty good too. Damn waiter"}
{"text":"Very freshly made dumplings.
And service is fast

Though you could skip the wonton soup. It was just so-so."}
{"text":"Fresh, authentic, delicious dumplings!
They have LAMB filling, which is amazing!
They also serve beer.

If you can't get enough, you can even buy them frozen to take home!"}
{"text":"Ugh we were v ignored bad service dumplings were pretty good but ordered way too many because were fu**in hungry #ragrets"}
{"text":"I have to agree with a lot of the previous reviewers--service is only marginal. It takes a while to get anyone's attention and I had to ask for the same things a few times before receiving them. Nothing truly horrible, just inconvenient.

The shrimp dumpling soup was tasty. 
The kelp salad...ugh, I could have gone without.

I ordered half shrimp and half cabbage+mushroom dumplings. The shrimp were so-so, but the cabbage were very good. 

The table next to me ordered some with dill and they smelled divine."}
{"text":"A restaurant that is dedicated to only 'dumplings', this I had to try. Montreal's Chinatown has some local gems, I must say. Perhaps the influence and standards of French Cuisine? The dumplings are made fresh by order right in front of you. A steam try holds 15 dumplings enough for one person. Delicate flavors, light dough, brimming with juiciness, these dumplings were worth the wait. Be prepared to wait at least 1 hour before you get to taste these scrumptious dumplings."}
{"text":"I decided to go here for dinner with a few friends and was skeptical at first as sometimes i question the quality of these places however when the food came out and i took my first bite that claim swiftly disappeared. 

The place: Located within the heart of Montreal's Chinatown, Keep an eye out for the number as it is easily missed. As soon as you walk in the door the smell of the delicious food hits you straight away which start to make your mouth water for whats on offer. The vibe is similar to other Chinese restaurants i have been, which is good as its not too fussy on the decor just a clean place with good lighting and sound level that you can converse with your friends and enjoy the food. It looks like you can seat large enough groups as i saw a group of 8 eating when i went in. 

Food: Where do i start, my experience with dumplings has been limited to say the least. I could count the amount of times i have had them on one hand. One of these places however was a very established Chinese restaurant. There was 5 of us all together so we decided to buy 3 different portions of dumplings. Each portion of dumplings contains 15 dumplings ! The dumplings were brought out on steamer baskets and were very hot when they came out (which is good). As i took my first bite the juices splattered everywhere (recommend) eating them whole. The quality of each dumpling was amazing and found myself reaching for another before i had the one in my mouth finished. After about 10 dumplings (i eat the most) i was well and truly full to the brim. I could still taste the flavors in my mouth long after i finished them. 

Price: The price of the 3 portions worked out so cheap. Between 5 of us it was about 6 dollars each which is an absolute bargain. 

I would highly recommend going here especially if you want to try something different. 
Also they have fortune cookies at the till which is always exciting at the end of meal :)"}
{"text":"During my dumpling hopping, I made it a point to stop at Qing Hua.  I suggest you come after lunch as the soup dumplings are not available during lunch.

I ordered the Lamb and Coriander dumplings, Beef and Onion dumplings, and Sea Urchin Soup Dumplings.  These dumplings are a little different from Mai Xiang Yuan as they come out in Bamboo Steamers and actually have soup inside!  I preferred the steamed dumplings to the boiled dumplings but the fried dumplings at MXY were better.  The Lamb and Coriander was really fresh and the flavor was BAM in your face but the Beef and Onion dumplings were kinda boring.  I expected a little more POW from the Uni Soup Dumplings but still a relatively good deal since they do put in half a piece of uni in each soup dumpling.  I was hoping the Uni was wrapped tightly on the top so the flavors didn't get diluted so much.  Still a very good visit when in Chinatown!"}
{"text":"I've already written a review for the Qing Hua, Lincoln Ave location. This one at Chinatown is like a notch below its Lincoln ave counterpart. Its lags a bit behind in all aspects.... Food, Service.... Maybe not the Ambiance & Price. The dumplings here are a bit cheaper than the other location.  Also the menu here is limited. Think of the Lincoln Ave location as Batman & the Chinatown location as Robin. Even though both are on the same team, Everyone prefers Batman....

Food -  Good
Service -Ok
Ambiance - Casual / Clean
Worth the money - Yes"}
{"text":"Amazing selection of dumplings including vegetarian options, beef, lamb, chicken and shrimp! Serves pretty much only dumplings so you might be disappointed if you want other dishes. The restaurant is in a nice location but usually crowded. Nice atmosphere and the prices are pretty good 7-9 dollars for an order of 12 dumplings! I would recommend this for anyone who likes dumplings and wants a casual place to go!"}
{"text":"We got the pork and leek dumplings (steamed) and the beef and celery (fried). We also tried the peanut butter dumplings. The peanut butter dumplings were surprisingly good. It comes with hot oil and the flavor of the dumpling and the peanut butter go well together. Between the pork/leek and the beef/celery, I preferred the steamed pork/leek. They provide good portions. The order came out pretty quickly and service was good. They were on top of it. They do accept credit cards!"}
{"text":"The specialty here is dumplings, and they do a nice job with them. You have a choice of several varieties and you can have them fried, steamed, or boiled. I had the lamb dumplings with coriander, steamed, which were very flavorful. The skin was soft and chewy, but the edges hardened a bit as they got cooler. You mix your own dipping sauce from soy, vinegar, and chili oil provided on the table. Worth a vist if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Belle découverte. Étions un groupe de 5 et avons eu un très bon service rapide et sympathique. Les entrées commandées: Concombre mariné,  tofu épicé ainsi que  salade de chou vinaigré.  Les dumplings sont fins et raffinés. Nous avons partagé plusieurs variétés qui viennent en 15 morceaux. Je le recommande sans hésiter !"}
{"text":"Chicken Curry Dumplings? Crazy tasty. Chicken and Coriander, OH YES! My friends did pork and beef too, but that's not really my thing, but I can assure you they like it. 

This location is much bigger than the original one on Lincoln St near Concordia, and looks clean too. When I went to pay I watched 2 ladies rolling out the dumpling skins and stuffing them up ready to be steamed or fried. 

They have a few select dumplings available frozen too! So if you are ever in need of some dumplin' lovin' I definitely say yes."}
{"text":"There was no sign displayed anywhere at the place that they don't accept credit cards. I had credit card only :( but I had to get cash :(! I was very unhappy about it. Also the server was extremely rude and was not nice at all and didn't understand English well. The food was not good either. Don't order chicken and mushroom it's not good :( very unhappy here."}
{"text":"I've been to this place 2 times and the first time was ok , I'm a bit disappointed in how I let myself get fooled a second time. I'll elaborate a bit on my 2nd time experience. The waitresses don't speak English nor French and their extremely rude. Our waitress was also extremely unhygienic ( very bad breath) and came to us 3 times within our first minute of being seated to ask us what our order was. After telling her we needed at least a few minutes to take a look at the menu she seemed annoyed and I had a feeling she wasn't going to come back so I set a timer just out of curiosity. 25 minutes later she came back and asked us our order. The food came out at a decent pace . We still left a 15% tip but were dying inside. This place feels unhygienic and just not the kind of place I'd waste any more money on . One of my rule of thumb is , you can always judge a restaurant by the cleanliness of its bathroom , I won't go into details of how these ones were but I'm sure you guys can imagine. 0/5 if it was possible."}
{"text":"The food took a long time to come to the table. Fried costs an extra 1.50, NOT .50 as another review suggested. Cash only. I would return, but would not have Pork and Green Onion, because there was not much taste, of either pork or onion. The room is big and clean and modern, unlike so many of the chinatown places. Forget the hot and sour soup"}
{"text":"We come here every once in a while with my family for a casual meal. This is a really no frills kind of place. The service is pretty slow and not particularly attentive. The dumplings are yummy though. They come nice and hot, exploding with delicious juices. 

For those who care, this place has plenty of high chairs, but no changing table. Definitely safe to come with kids."}
{"text":"Great food, sub-par service.  Above average soup dumplings"}
{"text":"The one on Lincoln have better dumplings but this one is way faster. You'll wait about 30-40 minutes, in places like theses the wait is usually 1h or so."}
{"text":"This hub for dumplings did not disappoint. We stopped by on impulse after walking by. Simple interior, serves small selection of beer + wine. The orders are huge in my opinion. We split one order of pork and cabbage steamed dumplings and they were delicious. Service was average, not terribly attentive but we did not need much."}
{"text":"Amazing dumplings!!!

Ambience and service: very casual and good for groups! The servers are nice and polite and explain the menu. If asked, they make suggestions so that's always helpful!

Dumplings: I've only been there for dumplings since I'd feel like a visit there wasted if I don't have dumplings.. The sauces on the table vary to suit your tastebuds.. The lamb, shrimp, pork - all are great! 

Price/Quantity ratio: Super cheap and huge portions so very much suitable for groups since we can easily order 3 plates to share amongst 4-5 people! Depends on how hungry you are though.. We got that and were filled but not bursting - which I find is healthy :P

Will I go back: YES! :D The location is lively, ambience is great for hanging out with friends and sharing plates of dumplings always give a bonding opportunity! You don't burn a hole in your pocket, either!"}
{"text":"Grande variété de choix qu'il est difficile de choisir. L'avantage est qu'on peut mixer plusieurs variété (ajouter 0,50$), choisir la cuisson (vapeur ou frits +1,50$ pour les frits). Ce sont des plateaux de 15 raviolis, pour un prix variant de 10 à 13 $, plutôt pas cher. Par contre le service est déplorable, voire agressif. Dans un pays où le pourboire est obligatoire, je trouve ça inacceptable."}
{"text":"I've wanted to check out Qing Hua for quite some time after reading reviews but left a little underwhelmed.  I guess I was expecting more after reading so many cool reviews.  Let me preface this review by stating this place is still pretty good value for 15 dumplings! You have the choice of Soya sauce, vinegar or hot chilli oil to mix with your dumplings. 

So here's the skinny: 

The good: 

- value is phenomenal just over $10 plus tax for 15 dumplings is a great meal. If you want fried it's $1.50 extra. 
- lots of different selection of dumplings 
- freshly made behind the glass kitchen window
- they speak English, French, Mandarin and possibly some Cantonese
- dumplings I had were fried and still had some nice juice and soup in them 
- service was quick and efficient

The not so good:

- condiment containers (soya sauce, vinegar and chilli oil) were disgustingly greasy. I'd recommend you use a napkin to hold for cleanliness. This is for someone who usually doesn't fuss for unclean. 
- fried were not as crispy as I was anticipating. 
- pork, shrimp and chive were lacking in shrimp (their recommended most popular). I believe to have tasted shrimp in only 3-4 of the 15 pieces. 
- flavour was okay but not as wow amazing as I was anticipating. 
- no Xiao long bao. 

Overall it was  a decent experience to lower experience. I need to come back here and try some other dumplings and I'll update my review after."}
{"text":"Place was nice and clean but understaffed. It took half an hour to get the dumplings. We read the other reviews regarding the food and the other rest having higher quality, so we took it easy and just ordered soups (wonton and hot and sour) and two orders of pork soup dumplings- six per order at $6.

The soups were not great, would not order those again. The hot and sour was super thick and looked old, the wonton soup was bland and the wontons and filling did not taste good.

However, we will return for the soup dumplings- right on. They were big, perfectly steamed, and had a LOT of soup. These were thin-skinned and gorgeous. The pork was somewhat broken down inside, but there was plenty of it, and it was not that bland. Eat them fast because once they start to cool down they stick to the steaming baskets. The rest doesn't put them on parchment paper or leaves, so it doesn't matter how great you are with chopsticks,you will lose some of that marvelous soup!

I douse my dumplings with 1 part soy to 2 parts vinegar and a teaspoon of chili oil. 

The dumplings will keep us coming back. Order them with confidence."}
{"text":"The soup dumplings here are amazing.  We had some fried and some steamed and both were delicious.  The pork, shrimp, leek filled dumplings were especially good."}
{"text":"Not the friendliest service, but honestly, who cares? Those dumplings were damn good. The menu was very easy to order from, the helpings were generous, and the food came rather quickly. Definitely a place to go to if you enjoy a tasty dumpling, or 15."}
{"text":"My husband & I decided it would be fun to do a \"dumpling hop\" in Chinatown, Montréal while here for the F1 Grand Prix. The 3 restaurants we randomly dropped into while walking down Chinatown: Restaurant Noodle Factory, Restaurant Pain Farci, and Qing Hua. We only ordered their juicy pork dumplings at each place.

Qing Hua = 1 star. Bad service + long wait + bad food. The worst dumplings we've ever tasted...unless you like tons of extra hard dough with your dry dumplings. I would caution anyone from going there. Boo! Thumbs down, WAY WAY down  Maybe try one of the places below? 

Restaurant Noodle Factory -  4 stars. The 6 dumplings weren't very juicy but they were tasty and I really enjoyed their sweet dipping sauce. Worth the $10 price tag. 

Restaurant Pain Farci =  4 stars. The dumplings here were super soupy, flavorful, and ginormous (hence the $13/$14 price tag for 10 pieces).

NOTE: We've been to a few Din Tai Fung restaurants in Singapore, Japan and southern California so we have something to compare the dumplings to."}
{"text":"The soup dumplings (xiao long bao, or \"juicy steamed buns\" as they list them) were incredible! These were at least as good as or better than my favorites in New York City -- and there are more varieties at Qing Hua. I'll have to come here on every trip to Montreal now."}
{"text":"A must-try in the Montreal food scene. Over 50 types of dumpling ranging from vegetarian to lamb. An order of dumplings comes with 15 per order and one order typically ranges $10-13 depending on fillings. 

You can order your dumplings steamed or fried. I recommend one order of each style. Lamb and beef are better fried while the seafood and vegetarian are better steamed. 

We had shrimp with zucchini, beef with coriander, lamb with green onion, and oyster with pork and pickled cabbage. All were SO GOOD! 

Previous reviews said cash only but we had no issue with our cards. Perhaps depends on your carrier."}
{"text":"3.5 I guess. These soup dumplings failed to impress. yes they are fresh but there isn't a ton of soup. I liked all the options that they have. Ended up with lamb/green onion. Cash only."}
{"text":"Take it from someone who lived in China for half of her life. This place is the real thing - it is as authentic as it gets!

There are many types of dumplings and the making varies depending on the region they originated from, Qing Hua specialized in 'shui jiao', which literally translates to 'water dumplings', which means when you bite down on them, you'll get a mouthful of flavorful juice. This is also the Northern style, which differs somewhat from the Shanghai and Cantonese styles of dumplings. I think this is the major point of confusion of 'authenticity' in other reviews.

That being said, we had the pork and cabbage dumplings (boiled) as well as the lamb and  leek dumplings (steamed). From the time I first bit down on the dumplings, it's as if I'm being translocated back to Beijing. The meat and veggies inside are extremely fresh; moisturize is preserved to the perfect degree; the flavor and seasoning are done to perfection, not too salty, not too greasy; the peels the perfect thickness, held up well to the high temperature and maintained its elasticity. When you bite into that little pouch of pleasure, the plentiful juice that marinated the dumplings with flavor spills out.

The 5 star is solely for the tastiness, heavenliness of their dumplings. The hot and sour soup that we ordered did not taste sour or hot, but the dumplings more than made up for it! Even in Boston and NYC, I never encountered my hometown dumplings made so perfect as these.

We've also been to the sister restaurant near Guy-Concordia, however, the authenticity there is many levels lower than this one. The cleanliness and spaciousness of this place is also a huge plus. So if you are craving for some juicy, authentic, northern style dumplings, this is the place to be!"}
{"text":"We actually loved that place. You have 15 huge dumplings for CAN$7.50, which is amazing value-for-money. We were so happy to find soup dumplings, which are pretty difficult to find in France, so we gorged ourselves on these. Sure, they were not the tastiest ever and the dough was a bit too thick, but hey, for the price, it was great (try the pork & cabbage - pretty sure it is a best seller)."}
{"text":"Soup dumplings is what made me walk into this place and try it out. But little did I know they didn't actually have xiao long bao (soup dumplings). However, I settled for their steamed pork and leek dumplings and their pan fried pork and leek. What surprised me about their dumplings was that even though they weren't actual soup dumplings, they had soup inside! One bite and seriously soup will splash across the table!! I really liked their dumplings and the extensive options they had for them. Steamed or pan fried they're all good! Just don't fall for what I did.. Thinking that they had actual xiao long bao. However; I will come back one day if I ever come back to Montreal."}
{"text":"I came here because I was hoping to get xiao long bao/siu long baos, but to my surprise, they didn't have any. I asked the server and she said they don't have them anymore - not sure if she meant they don't serve them anymore or if they ran out for the time being.

We ordered two types of steamed dumplings - 1 order of pork, and 1 order of lamb.
I found their dumplings larger than the normal dumpling size. I would recommend the pork dumplings, but the lamb dumplings tasted funny to me. 

Overall: Good place for dumplings with reasonable price."}
{"text":"The marinated kelp was amazing! it was coated in a spicy sweet soy ginger sauce.  As previous reviews have stated this place has very slow service, but the steamed dumplings were awesome. 

I orderd the beef coriander and lamb dumpling. One order comes with 15 dumplings so you can do half and half, which is nice! My only real compliant was they never checked up on us. I am usually not a fan of dumplings, but these were spectacular. The dough was very tender and the meat inside with tender with the right amount of juiciness. My only real concern is if they used MSG in their food. They didn't mention MSG free. Overall, solid food but slow service."}
{"text":"Slow as hellllll. I oder an very easy dumpling soupe, and I waited more than 30min. People who came after me sitting on the neighboring table almost done and I just received mine. I'm not gonna come back. ???????? ????"}
{"text":"Excellent dumplings, service wasn't any spectacular.  The wonton soup was amazing! The shrimp, pork and leek were great.  Oyster, pickled cabbage, and pork not as good!"}
{"text":"I didn't try the dumplings, it's true, but when you screw up something as simple as a wonton soup ... you don't deserve a good review."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of dumplings, I eat them often. This is place is one of my favorite spots. I enjoy the selection they offer and they are pretty fantastic dumplings. Now and then they screwed up and get some a bit dry but overall I love this spot. I had the spicy tofu few times, it is pretty good, I would recommend it for an appetizer if you are super hungry. The service is horrible so be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Wow! J'en reviens pas que le monde est si sévère avec cet endroit.
Je vois 2 raisons possible d'être sévère avec cet endroit
1: Pas de buns steamer ou menu assez petit. S'il était rotatif ou changeant, ça serait cool, mais le menu est juste vraiment trop basic comparé aux autres endroits.
2: Le staff est weird et vraiment peu conaissant en anglais ou en français. 

Sinon les dim sums sont excellent. Le jus dans le dimsum C'est supposé être comme ça. Un Dim sum tu suces-bois le jus, trempe le dimsum dans la petite sauce, et on mange.
Il y a 15 dim sums par sortes a envrion 13$ par  choix. C'est donc un peu plus dispendieux. Les drinks sont boff mais honnêtement, tous les points possiblement allouable à la qualité des dim sums, ils l'ont, C'est délicieux. C'est un peu moins bon que Mother's dumpling mais beaucoup moins sec que ceux que j'ai mangé. On a le choix de les avoir a la vapeur ou frit. 
J'ai mangé Porc et crevrette, Poulet au Cari et Agneau et Coriandre. C'est vraiment le choix le plus logique à mon avis."}
{"text":"I have been coming to this location for years but.... today was Victoria day, and I arrived for lunch with my boyfriend. there were 2 other customers present at the time that we ordered, and the k-pop playing through the aux chord was so obnoxiously loud that staff could not hear each other, let alone our order... and we could barely hear or talk to each other during our meal. They'd also let their phone ring OVER THE RESTAURANT SOUND SYSTEM while standing around ignoring it- fully oblivious to how disturbing this was to everyone trying to eat lunch.

I also must say that a solid 5-6 of my dumplings were much smaller than the rest of my basket (chicken & coriander, steamed).. and.. my guess is that those tiny dumplings were made with whatever remnants of filling  were left in the mixing bowl.  My best guess is that, by the time the filling was used up, it went bad.. meaning, they do not take proper precautions with handling raw poultry/meat. I literally mean that I would bite into a dumpling and the taste was that of rancid chicken or rancid broth. So I'd spit into a napkin, and hope the next one was ok. That is NOT OKAY and goes to show how little f*cks they truly give.

I told my waitress... she got nervous.. She apologized, but I still had to pay for my half rotten meal. When I paid, the change owed to me was literally put into the tip tray. The staff has never been the most attentive, but this new batch of employees is absolutely unimpressive, unprofessional and awkward. I'm not sure I will ever have the time to risk salmonella, or the courage to go back to Qing Hua. FULLY unpleasant, unacceptable experience. So sad!!"}
{"text":"We were looking for Qing Hua's Ave Lincoln location, but saw one in Montreal's Chinatown, so decided to just go ahead and eat at this restaurant.

The won ton seemed more like noodle with no meat in the won ton?  The soup base was good, not too salty.  We tried both fried and steamed dumplings.  Just OK for both.  We are from San Francisco, and the dumplings back home are way better than Qing Hua's."}
{"text":"Definite bargain in terms of dumplings for the money.  15 dumplings for $6.99.  Wonderful homemade taste.  The place is very basic inside.  We had pork and leek and pork and mushroom dumplings, steamed and fried.  Both excellent, but I would give the edge to steamed over fried.

Cash only for payment, but we think it was worth it."}
{"text":"Qinghua is not a typical Chinese restaurant. The menu is skimpy. But, what is has is largely superb. 
     The dumplings, for instance, are not like other others which tend to be dry. In this case, they're  juicy and delicious. 
     I especially enjoyed the chicken mushroom, and pork cabbage dumplings. But, the curry beef dumplings were just average. 
      The cheapest dish we ordered, marinated cucumber, turned out to be the best cucumber dish we have ever tasted: sour, sweet, with a tinge of spiciness, a perfect combination that proved to be just a culinary delight. I wish every four dollar appetizer was like this. If so, even poor people can have a good life.
     In a nutshell, I encourage you to go. When you leave, you will think to yourself, \"life is good. After all, your stomach is full, your tastebyds are happy, and your wallet is still full.\""}
{"text":"We stopped here after the Montreal Pride parade, What can I say for 10$ you get a lovely steaming plate of dim sum that will make you want more and more. We took 3 different types all were wonderful."}
{"text":"Just to make this clear, the only reason I give this place a 3 is because of the service.

After waiting for a table we just sat ourselves down since the waiters seemed to be pretty busy. We ordered the pork with mushroom, pork with shrimp and chicken and coriander steamed dumplings and my friend also ordered the kelp salad. We waited for around 25 minutes and saw other tables who came later get served before us which was a bit disappointing and also they gave the kelp salad to the wrong customer so my friend didn't get the salad until near the end. The good part was, after the wait was that the dumplings were pretty good--very juicy and steaming hot. Personally, I think the pork and mushroom dumplings seemed to be the best! The price was also pretty affordable but because they seemed pretty disorganized don't know if I would go again. Still not bad though!"}
{"text":"No frills dumpling place in Montreal. What a great find!! They had lamb dumplings which was such a treat. The service was ok but with tasty and cheap dumplings i ain't complaining."}
{"text":"I need to thank whomever left the NY Times 36 hours in Montreal article in the Lonely Planet book I checked out from the library so that I discovered this really delicious sea urchin dumplings that you can't even get anywhere else!!!

I LOVE sea urchin...and when my friends all said they wanted to go to Chinatown for lunch after we got into Montreal, I immediately suggested this place because I saw NYT mentioning its 40+ dumplings offerings, and one of these being sea urchin dumplings.

Even though NYTimes mentioned this place, I was expecting their dumplings to have like an inch thick skins, like most of the places in the North America. But I was so wrong. Well, it's not as paper thin as you would expect from some places in China or something, but it's thick enough to hold the juices of the fillings (but they aren't the soup dumplings), yet, not thick enough that it tastes like a bun more than dumplings.

We had most but one orders steamed, and we ordered pan fried for one of the orders since it cost extra. Man! The pan fried one was really good too. Not greasy at all and the juices are all retained inside the dumplings as well! And I wonder how they do it because some dumplings were \"connected\" by the \"rice paper\" (Think of the sheet of dried up condensation from cooking rice)

The best of all, and it's probably biased, is the sea urchin dumplings. I like the lamb dumplings we ordered as well. 
The sweetness of the sea urchin blended in with the meat, and all the juices still captured inside the dumpling skins....i was in heaven each bite i took!

The only downside is that they either are not too good with refilling your glasses with water, or they are short-staffed that day. 

o...and it's cash only! tourists be aware!"}
{"text":"Delicious dumplings. You can mix your order, which I'd recommend -- better yet, go with a friend and order several types, then share!  You get 15 dumplings, which is a huge serving. Walk it off around Chinatown."}
{"text":"another dumpling place in montreal which is great. service i found a little slow but my the food made up for it. i had lamb with dill steamed dumplings. they we good and juicy full of flavor . i would come back."}
{"text":"The dumplings here were very good. They came in wicker steaming baskets, which was a nice touch. The restaurant itself is big and spacious and the servers were courteous, however hot tea was not included in the meal."}
{"text":"Le service est horrible, lent, fastidieux mais c'est tellement bon qu'on en oublie les inconvénients. 1* pour le service inexistant, 4* pour les dumplings goûteux."}
{"text":"The best dumplings ever! Filled with soup, so they explode if you take too big a bite! Rolled fresh steamed or fried."}
{"text":"One of my favourite dumplings restaurants to go to. Literally anytime I have a craving I will go in town just to order these then go back home. Every once and awhile the service can be a little rude but getting these dumplings for me is totally worth it. I order about 30 minimum each time but at this price I can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Wow, this place was amazing! Delicious soup dumplings with incredibly tasty dough and broth. My friend and I shared the curry chicken and chicken and mushroom dumplings - both were wonderful, but my favorite was the chicken and mushroom. One note: the service is not incredibly friendly. Go for the food, not the setting."}
