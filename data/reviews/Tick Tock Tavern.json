{"text":"Breakfast great Kim good waitress coffee great Price cheap .this a deal the bar side is
Also the best be coming for year's something is special and historic here.
Free WiFi best ribs in state. All you can eat fish nights."}
{"text":"I don't know how else to describe how my rib and chicken combo tasted, other than maybe lukewarm leftovers topped with mothballs. It was just gross. The coleslaw was ok. The rice pilaf tasted about a week old... But the meat... Ugh... How is this place known for their ribs? Dry, overly chewy, and no effort to take off the inedible silver skin. The chicken was just kind of ok. I'll just avoid this place from now on."}
{"text":"When I have a taste for ribs, Tick Tock Tavern is where I head. The ribs are fantastic, and the prices very reasonable. After the ribs I move over to the tavern.  PW gives it 5 stars and says in his review, \"There is a lot of weirdness here.\"  But it's all interesting and fun. It's a place where a lot of well known Clevelanders hang out."}
{"text":"Saturday night 5:30 PM.  Waitress Christine poor service, ribs all fat.  When we told them, she brought only for the ribs, no side.  She claimed he ate the side. He did not eat all of the side. Seriously you could not add a small side of hash browns. She had an attitude since we walked in since we were her first customer since her 3:00 shift!  This is not our problem!  We have been going to Tick Tock for decades, worse service ever!  Don't go on Saturday
 nights!!!! Our first sign no ribs cooking.  Christine claimed the cook just took them out. Who knows. Very sad."}
{"text":"A neighborhood bar with tasty appetizers and strong drinks!  It doesn't take long to become a 'regular' there; good vibes!"}
{"text":"I have come to the tick tock tavern for years and I have a consistently excellent experience from the friendly attentive waitresses here, the portion sizes are excellent and I would recommend the tick tock tavern to all my friends."}
{"text":"Great food great people! Bartenders are very attentive and informative!  They definitely look out for their customers!  There was a very intoxicated man almost falling off the bar. Every bartender and some of the regulars assisted him with a cab home, one bartender even offered to take him home. Their specialty wings are a must and their burgers are to die for!!! They even knew my wife and I were splitting the wings and burger so they put half on separate plates. We used to go to this place for a couple drinks and because it is right down the road but this is our new spot for dinner! Can't wait to try the ribs!!"}
{"text":"Will never go back. Ordered a makers mark on the rocks and got FRUIT FLY'S in the bottom of my drink!!!!! The barmaid is very rude and acted annoyed when I complained about the disgusting BUGS in my drink!  Food and drinks are cheap, but beware!!  The staff basically ignores anyone who isn't a \"regular\", I guess they don't complain about flies in there drinks! It is very dirty and smells in the bar. Didn't try any food , lost my appetite after the disgusting drink!!!"}
{"text":"This is the worst place we have ever eaten!!!! My sister and I took my mom and our kids here after not seeing our mom for months hoping to have a nice family dinner. The waitress we had didn't smile once, didnt never ask us if we needed refills on our drinks, didn't tell us that the refills were not free, keep calling my niece that had all pink on a boy and our dinner didn't come out until like 45 min to an hour after ordering and they were not busy at all. Then when we finally got our food, it was dry and burnt, along with an extremely greasy calamari while it tasted extra fishy too. Although one of our meals were taken off, the manager never came over to apologize. Also before I even went in, I saw a guy had a dog at the back door of the kitchen but didn't realize it was their kitchen until I saw the same guy in there. This place shouldn't even be open if they have animals in or near the kitchen. Also people smoking at the back door with it open and then not wearing any gloves while preparing everyone's food. How do we know they washed their hands. Also waitresses we're doing nothing but standing around in a group talking while there were customers waiting. So as we were about to leave and talking about the horrible service amongst ourselves. The waitresses keep looking at us laughing and talking quietly amongst themselves.

Sincerely a waitress from a different restaurant"}
{"text":"WILL NEVER RETURN! 
Came here for lunch, ordered soup and reubens, soup was ok, very basic. Our server was rude and seemed very frazzled even though there was only 1 other table there. She never asked if we wanted anything to drink besides water, then failed to bring drinks we asked for until after our food was served. Our ruebens were only toasted on one side so the bottom was completely soggy and the quality of the corned beef was horrible, more fat than meat, I couldnt chew it. When I explained why I didnt wnt to take my almost full plate of food home, I was offered more crappy corned beef and still charged $27 for our barely touched meals.  Not worth a second chance in my opinion."}
{"text":"the place is dirty smells finicky. about the food, I had cheddar broccoli soup very good had all kinds of veggies in it. I got chicken marsala. my husband got Cole slaw no flavor, and ribs they said the ribs were fresh yea fresh out of the pot of water from being boiled."}
{"text":"Found myself back here the other day for the first time in years. And I have to say, the place hasn't changed a bit. Excellent home cooked food that there's always enough to take home. Service is great! And the atmosphere is always entertaining."}
{"text":"tick tock is around the corner from my place and i love it. nice people, good food and cheap prices."}
{"text":"The food is awesome & the wait staff is funny as hell. The prices are amazing! Drop $20 on two people and walk out happy and stuffed. Never been to the bar side... so I can't comment on that. But it's a nice lay out, if you want a sit down meal then it's one side of the diner... if you want to get hammered and watch a game it's on the other side of the wall. Good for families that don't want to eat at a bar, but want a great meal cheap... or a drinker that doesn't want to look at junior while drinking a boilermaker."}
{"text":"Incapable of getting an order correct. No exageragtion, at least 10 times. One thing consistent they will always miss something. Whether it's a side order an order of fries an order of coleslaw and even an entire dinner once.100% of the time they will miss something without fail."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is decent, especially the fish fry. It's under $10 and it's all you can eat. He prices are really good and the service is quick. Nothing special or fancy, but just a good place to eat at if you want decent late night food."}
{"text":"This place is a Cleveland classic. This spot offers THE most bang for your buck. Prices are low, atmosphere is authentic. The St.Louis ribs and Santorini wings are where it's at, meaty, original rub, and they make all of their own sauces. They also have great beer specials and taps. We have our family party every year in the Argus room, the owner is very accommodating and nice. The menu has a classic diner feel, but also has items such as an unbeatable deal for the Friday Fish-Fry. The Tick Tock will always be a big, wonderful piece of Cleveland to me."}
{"text":"Cheers to another great dive bar, with good food, low pricing and is also conveniently located. Not the biggest of bars, but they do have a nice outdoor space for those of us who tend to chain smoke when drinking. They have a juke box for tunes, extensive menu with daily specials, on the lower end for drink prices and a mixed crowd, usually filled up daily with regulars. I have been here several times and have tried several things off their food menu, everything is decent for what it is: bar food. For what you pay and what you get, it's great. If you only drink champagne and eat non greasy food, go somewhere else and save us your stuck up review, thanks!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrid. My partner got food poisoning, as did two other people I know - all at separate times! This place needs to be investigated for sanitation issues."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  The food is homemade and large portions.   Menu is extensive with great lunch and dinner specials and very reasonable prices.  Some of the best ribs, chicken paprikash, beef stroganoff, and gyros around.  Great burgers too.  They do substitutions and will happily take requests.  They grill the onions for me on the chicken gyro (thank you Mike), which is delicious.  Chicken paprikash, beef stroganoff and yankee  pot roast are to die for.  Actually, everything is really good.  I haven't had a bad meal yet.  Kim (waitress) makes you feel welcome the minute you walk in the door with her smile and friendliness.  She is one of the best waitresses I have seen."}
{"text":"Been to the Tick Tock a couple of times while in C-town visiting the parents. It's got a nice, neighborhood cafe feel to it. The menu is a carnivore's delight (they rotisserie cook many of their own meats), but there are enough seafood options to keep mammal-averse diners like me happy as well. Pretty much everything I've had on the (fairly huge) menu is good, and, because it's the Midwest, huge portions and low prices are the norm. Also, how many places specialize in barbecue and pierogies at the same time? This is why I love the 'Land.

So why three stars? Somehow, every time I'm in here, the service is like glacially slow. Like geological epoch slow. It takes a while for someone to recognize that you're there, and then another while to get your drink, and so on, until the intervals add up to an hour plus for lunch. Sure, last visit was on Labor Day, and so maybe I should have expected a crowd with everyone off work, but than again, maybe the Tick Tock should have scheduled more than one server for the whole place. Sure, she was a wonderful Cleveland original, with that gruff-but-sweet Polish thing that you can really only get here and in Milwaukee, but c'mon--try staffing adequately for holidays.

In any case, get some crab stuffed mushrooms and a catfish, or a slab of ribs and fires, depending on what tasty version of 3,000 calories suits your fancy. It's a dive with character. Full bar available."}
{"text":"I used to like Tick Tock for the great portions, lack of pretenses, simple American/Greek food and great staff. Lately though, every visit has been a little worse down to being served yellow lettuce and old coleslaw in my last trip. I used to like the mom-and-pop feel of this place, but lately it's become the lunchroom/daycare for the barstaff next door. To get in, you have to push big drunk guys out of the way then not get greeted and sit down at a booth. Eventually someone will come around, take a drink order and forget to bring what you ordered to the table. You get to listen to whatever awful music is next door and listen to all of the wait-staff-domestic-drama. They've gone from casual servers to completely unprofessional waitresses who could care less about your experience. It's sad that one of my favorite little gems has become such a nightmare."}
{"text":"WORST PLACE I HAVE EVER BEEN TO! Had been wanting to go there for years because of all the great reviews in the papers.  What a disappointment!  It took 20 minutes for the waitress to come to our table.  We didn't get our drink orders until the food arrived, which took over 45 minutes. After delivering the food, our waitress disappeared!  We never saw her again!  It turns out she went on her lunch break! The food came overcooked, cold and greasy.  I had to flag down another waitress to send all the food back to the kitchen.  No other wait staff came to our table during our stay.  We had to ask for refills, extra BBQ sauce and so on. Even when the food came back it was mediocre.  The only way I was able to get the check was to threaten to walk out without paying.  The hostess actually had the audacity to ask for a tip for the waitress!  A friend of mine had warned me that the place was bad.  I should have listened.  I will never go back there and tell all my friends to stay away."}
{"text":"Had a very nice breakfast here this morning! My wife satisfied her hankering for blueberry pancakes with a large stack and enough left to take home. I had a meat lover's omelet. Everything was well-prepared, waitress was efficient and very personable. Great little neighborhood restaurant for home-cookin' cuisine. Not fancy, but great value!"}
{"text":"Well, I was looking for a place to eat that was around my neighborhood (it was around 5 o'clock)...ran into this place. So there was someone sitting outside and I asked him if the food was any good.  He said yeah and I should go right in.  Walk through the doors and was NOT impressed.  It wasn't really packed but was ignored by the barmaid (or whoever she was) for about ten minutes and an patron noticed (funny) and had to call her over for me.  She gave me a menu and disappeared again for some time.  The wait alone in an almost empty bar did not encourage me to stay, so I just left."}
{"text":"This review is good based Bc we only drank beer, which was fine.

You eat here Bc it's convenient not Bc you seek it out for good food. We ordered a burger and fries and perogies. Perogies were good, not enough onion but they were seasoned great. The burger was gross, even cooked at mid rare it was dry and seemed compressed patty. Not good, fries were obviously frozen tasteless and soggy. Frozen food section type of stuff."}
{"text":"Used to be great. Terrible now, they took down the rib slow roaster didn't have baby back ribs and short changed/ stole $3 when I paid. What happened?"}
{"text":"So, this quirky little place is over on Clifton and reminds me of a place in my hometown of Twinsburg that is no longer in existence; remember the little local bar/tavern in your town, where all the \"characters\" hung out? 

That's the Tick Tock all over. We went on a Saturday morning, quite by accident, and ended up going just to check the place out. It was an interesting trip. Firstly, the breakfast we got was tasty; I got a Monte Cristo that was really good, and Patty's breakfast of the day was good as well. The price was very reasonable, and the small cafe area was really comfortable and packed with lots of local sports memorabilia. It felt like home. The waitress we had was really great and was full of good, topical conversation. 

 Now, the Tick Tock is still a tavern, so they do have a full bar and that bar draws a really fascinating local crowd...

With that in mind, heh, we almost got to see an \"altercation\" as the barmaid got in an argument with someone. We did not SEE it, but it was loud enough that we sat wide-eyed as the offending individual was \"asked to leave\" ... (and I'm putting it mildly.)  It was...hilarious. I like a place with chutzpah, and this place has it in buckets.

(And the food's good too:) 

So, if you get a second, make some time for the Tick Tock!"}
{"text":"Disgusting food. Great Service. I couldn't even eat my food.  One star because our server was so nice."}
{"text":"This used to be a wonderful West Side Rib place, but the ribs are over cooked and the place is not clean - just disgusting."}
{"text":"Tick Tick Tavern is my favorite place! the food is awesome make sure you try the lamb chops. Love the bartenders and staffs. 2 thumbs up for the Tick Tock. oh yeah the summer is amazing relaxing outside I love this place and everywhere I go i tell everyone about the tick tock."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for 15 years! Always has amazing and pleasant waitresses. The place itself is     a little dated but that's fine with me. The service, and atmosphere is very relaxing and the menu will suite almost anyone.  The FOOD ,well is OUTSTANDING! There are two other things that also fit that description: The SERVICE and the PRICING!  When I want to party I head downtown but when I want to eat I head to the Tick Tock!! See ya next week."}
{"text":"Service was horrible;it took an hour and a half for fried fish. It was an all you can eat fish fry, but after you wait for an hour and a half for two or three fish, who wants to go through thae pain again for more! This place looks like it has a good atmosphere at the bar, but between the wait for fish, long wait for the bill, the server taking my ketchup and giving it to the table next to me before I was done, no silverware for the first few minutes, having to get up and ask someone for water, messing up an order next to me and the two people next to us getting there first and our order still coming out 15 minutes before there's I think is a good indicator that I will go someplace else in the future..."}
{"text":"I'm giving Tick Tock 4 stars because frankly, they are a group of lovely people. Great service with decent food. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years, since I moved into the neighborhood in 2010. The Tick Tock is a great dive with good food and even better people watching! The portions are enormous. They have all the fried bar staples and burgers you are looking for, but the menu is almost as long as Cheesecake Factories. The daily specials will have no less than 15 options. I've never heard of Mousaka until I came to Tick Tock, it's like Greek lasagna and I couldn't recommend it more. The service can be hit or miss depending on who's behind the bar and how crowded but I've never had an awful experience."}
{"text":"Good ribs. Great homemade salad dressing. The food was served lukewarm, but tasty."}
{"text":"Perfect greasy spoon / dive bar ! Best screw drivers. Lori is a feisty bartender;) We stumbled upon this place while walking in the morning so glad we did. Stopped there twice for breakfast while we were in Cleveland"}
{"text":"The experience here was absolutely magnificent. A special friend took me here and explained in detail the charm this establishment provided. Wow did it not disappoint!! 

The portions were huge. The taste was amazing. The price extraordinarily low. The service was delightful. 

I just can't find anything critical to say. I only hope that I can visit the area again soon so that I may stop back here! :)"}
{"text":"I have been going to Tick Tock for about five years and I never thought I would be writing a review that was not flattering. Today is the day.  For the past two years the place has gone downhill.  The servers have attitudes ( We said we had a party of 6 and the waitress actually said \"Shit\" ) and seem disgusted. The place was empty.  The food has been served lukewarm.  Burgers when asked to be medium rare are bloody and cold from the raw meat.  Though they are willing to make it right, after four or five consecutive times of bad dinners you just give up."}
{"text":"Some what run down local bar and restaurant but one of our spots to get food late. The chicken tenders are great around $8 come with fries, they have good wings. If you need get food for take out and enjoy. They have a juke box which is always fun to put in your request."}
{"text":"Yes!!!  Just got my chicken and shrimp Alfredo.  And yes I received cutlery. !!!!   Love tick tock."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for lunch about 2 weeks ago, they were advertising all you can eat fish. The lunch came with fries and coleslaw. The waitress brought out my food and I began eating the coleslaw, I noticed something black in the coleslaw, I took a closer look and discovered it was a nasty bug, I immediately felt sick to my stomach. The waitress informed me that the restaurant had just been exterminated. I stayed there anyway :(, the fish was horrible. I ate 1 piece of fish and requested the check. I asked the waitress could I get 1/2 off the bill due to the fact that I had only 1 side dish and a bug in my food. She told me that they could not do that....I was appalled. I left there and will never go back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Besides the wait for the food everything about this place was nice it was definitely a place that you can bring your friends or family right next to it I believe is connected to a bar which is a very nice thing if you're having a relaxed I'm out and on the other side is the diner where they have the booth seats and the friendly way waitresses and Waiters."}
{"text":"Been here many times in the past. You walk in and it acts like a tiny diner, but you realize after a minute or so, that there's also a bat attached. The seating is very limited, and the bat isn't all that big, it is in a share store front.
    The service is mediocre at best, you dont wanna come here expecting to get the up most service at all. We sat, then waited about 10 minutes to have a server, which wound up being a good server. The menu is slightly diverse but they are known for the ribs. They have a choice of sauce or dry rub. Dry rub, you can get sauce on the side, it just adds to the taste of the already great taste of the ribs.
    So, overall, front to back, i would come back again it's local and it helps my community to do so, but don't come with the intent or assumption that youre gonna get any kind of up standing service. The food is the experience notbthe service(Not here)."}
{"text":"Ah The Tick Tock Tavern. It's one of the things that I actually miss about Cleveland. There's really not much, but this is one of them. 

Gyro Burger with fries for $4.25 (that's what it was five years ago) has to be one of my top five meals of all time. A good sized hamburger patty topped by a HUGE chunk of feta, several slices of gyro meat, grilled onions, white sauce.

Not to mention the old skool Terrel Brandon pictures on the side of the table."}
{"text":"Good Retro Dining Bar!

I went there to order a meal and they were sold-out, but it didn't let me down...and neither did the drinks. I'm sure that I'll be there again!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here in numerous times over the years and can't remember a time I was disappointed. For starters, If you leave hungry it's your own damn fault. Generous portions. No one will be late on the rent eating here. Prices are more than fair. The food is non pretentious and well prepared. The ribs will run circles around any chain. The specials really are specials. It's one of our family's go to restaurants. Two words mozzarella kabobs! The Greek dishes rival anyplace in town."}
{"text":"Biggest shots! Always a pleasure to talk to the bartenders. Really affordable too. Good for any day of the week, although on weekends it
 gets crowded."}
{"text":"The crowd at this place is worth the trip alone--that and the plethora of old school, fried foods to choose from. 

Wings seem to be a big hit--I had chicken tenders and fries. Really. The food is just simple, bad-for-you, comfort goodness. 

The bartenders are middle-aged women who get stark-raving mad when you shut the bar doors, even if it's under 30 degrees out. It's hilarious. They'll kick you out just because you weren't born in a barn.

I'd come back to this dive for sure. Solid 3-star dive with a cleaner bathroom than I've seen in nicer bars. Cheap and entertaining."}
{"text":"Don't let the decor fool you, good home cooking and amazing service.  Makes for a fun local"}
{"text":"Went for the clambake. Didnt realize it was a menu item and not an actuall event. The place is old. You can see it is not cared for as well as it used to be. While we were there one of the servers had her child at work sitting in a booth directly behind us. She was watching the learning chanel. The programing was somethong related to health and was discussing feces...
I will NOT be returning...
Oh, almost forgot...the food was awful."}
{"text":"It is your typical dive bar crowd and all. We went there for breakfast because they were one of the places where we could get it at 11 on a Friday and also get a bloody. Bloody Mary mix is made in house and is delicious. Bartender was very cool and our drinks were poured right. Yea it is a dive bar so if you want something fancier you probably shouldn't go there. We ordered a simple breakfast and it was pretty good. No complaints at all. The crowd was interesting and nice. Will definitely visit again if we are in the area."}
{"text":"This place is definitely one to steer away from. Very deceiving. Interior is dated and deteriorating. Menu is large. Ordered the hot garlic wings and the sauce was bland and very unappetizing. Wings were undercooked and tasted like something out of the frozen food section at Save A Lot. Menu said Fresh Cut Fries which sounded good but then they come out with these cheap looking sad fries that you would expect from someplace like Denny's or Bob Evans. Not fresh cut at all. My buddy got the Chicken BLT which looked good but the bacon came out half raw and it looked like something you'd expect from a McDonalds drive thru. His brother got a salad and it basically was bag lettuce and carrots that looked old. Service was awful and they were way understaffed. Will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough.   Great food.  Great service.   

GET THE RIBS.   TRUST ME!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite dive bars on the planet. Sure, the food is actually pretty great (the santorini wings are my go-to) but the bartenders are the best. I bring my friends who live in large cities to this place and they can't believe how cheap and strong their drink is. 
The bar is can get rowdy, even violent, at times- but the patrons are diverse and real friendly if you bring the right attitude.  I've shown up at this place in dirty work clothes and in tuxedo.. no one gives a rip. 
One thing is for sure- you're going to need an uber ride to get home."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's definitely a dive bar/restaurant hole in the wall but the staff is friendly and food is cheap. I just enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! It's my favorite dive bar that serves food for sure!

I've had several different dishes here so far. Fried Chicken Steak is delicious, crispy on the outside and juicy white meat on the inside with savory sausage gravy! The dinners come with fantastic soups. (The best is the beef vegetable with barley! I'm addicted.)

The Greek Burger is delicious, comes with gyro meat on top with onions and feta. A perfect combo. 

I've also had the chicken wings, tenders, and the reuben sandwich. All great choices that were very good!

Place has very strong drinks and a cheap price which is a must for a diver bar. 
Shout-out to Ruthie who is the sweetest bartender, always pleasant and a great personality. The rest of the staff in my opinion is great too. They are always very sweet and I haven't had any problems so far.

The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because it can be a little slow at times getting in the bill or flagging someone down for attention but they seem to be busy quite often when I visit, especially during sports games, so it's forgivable. The place has some rowdy, classless people that can make the atmosphere slightly uncomfortable as well, but after all it is a dive bar - so this should be expected. 

In conclusion. Check this place out if you want cheap good eats & drinks and that divey vibe."}
{"text":"This is probably the last time I eat at Tick Tock but I might stop back for drinks and sit at the bar and watch all the lunacy.  Place is a GOLDMINE for that.  Came here late on a Fri nite and was craving a fish fry.  The server lady we got was maybe 70?  Ordered 2 VODKA and diets to drink.  When they came out we could not tell this was NOT vodka.  We both asked her twice what it was and we were told vodka.  Later upon receiving the bill it said: BAC (in her own handwriting).  Anyone who loves booze as much as I do knows what Bacardi tastes like this was Bacardi.  Fish fry was gross and fries were bagged, frozen, cold and greasy...yumm..  When they took my full plate of food away one would of thought to ask how our food was?  Nah.  Come to find out I could of gotten any potato side instead of the crap fries but I was never given the option.  If you like to flag down your waitress for everything you need and be told what your going to eat/drink without any input then come here!  Maybe Gertrude needs to hang up the orthopedics and retire?  Only reason this place gets another star is the staff is (mostly) friendly and there is that excitement in the air while walking to your car at night here that you 1) might get robbed or 2) may get asked to buy rocks.  Both are pretty sweet."}
{"text":"This is probably more of a three-star joint, but there are some nasty reviews on here that are simply unfair. Besides, it deserves a bonus star for value. First, some clarity: This is NOT a barbeque joint! What the hell!? They do rotisserie ribs, and they're pretty good, but even Ohioans know better than to call that barbeque. I don't know why Yelp classifies it under \"barbeque.\" The second thing to know is that it's pretty much a Greek diner. It's good, cheap food prepared by competent line cooks. The salads are iceberg lettuce, but they've got a great, garlicky house dressing. The fries are fresh cut. The Santorini wings are excellent. The Greek standards, like grape leaves and spanakopita, are reliable. Probably not the best you'll ever have, but good. And the value is tremendous. Beer is cheap. Wine is cheap. Service is friendly. It's like a great diner overall. Who the hell hates a diner?"}
{"text":"If you wanna be ran out by the locals, come here. The customers are fine, but the bar tenders give them all special privilege. 

Funny cause i just moved down the street and was trying to make this my regular spot. Bartenders serving everyone around me. Tryed closing my tab for literally 20min calmly waiting. People walk up to the left of me and right of me, get served right away. 

Felt veryyy intentional. Servers obviously know these customers. Treat the new locals like shit. I dont pay people to give me terrible service, moving on to a new regular spot. 

Fyi, too cheap to turn the lights on during happy hour. Dark awkward feeling in there. Straight sunlight only is not how to light a bar. 

Foods decent. Ill give it that. What a shame though."}
{"text":"If you want home cooked food up until 2am this is the place... I get the half slab of ribs baked potatoes and a side salad every time and I'm always so amazed by the meal and the 10$ cost! So worth it. You get tired of fast food and take out and just want real home cooked food. This is it!  Wish I could offer a pic but I was too busy eating the food lol"}
{"text":"40 minutes for a burger on a we'd?  Ridiculous.  Walked out and will never return again.  Years ago this was the place"}
{"text":"My fiancé, her youngest daughter and I went here on the advice of friends in Lakewood.  Decided to try it before going to the Art Festival on Detroit Ave. today.  Easily make the top 5 of worst dining experiences ever.  

The kid had the chicken tenders and fries, tough to mess that up.  We had the open faced prime rib sandwich.  The meat was under cooked, even though the server asked us how we wanted it done and was a mostly fatty.  My napkin was filled with unchewed meat.  The server never came and asked us about the food or offered to refill our drinks, simply dropped of the check as she blew by the table once.

When I complained about the sandwiches, she got rather defensive about it so we figured it was pointless, paid the bill and vowed never to return.  I will gladly not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Was told that they have the best ribs in town.....Weeelll...ordered half rack baby back with original sauce 11$ what I got was boiled and broiled..bagged fries..bagged coleslaw that tasted a week old..disgusting..asked for Frank's hot sauce and got a bottle that said Frank's but was far from it can't forget the missing top..they have a smoker but it doesn't look like it's been used in five years...everything is dirty...now I know why they call it tick tock just a matter of time before something happens to someone"}
{"text":"This place is great. I've been here since 2013. The bartender won't let me leave. I was married. I have kids somewhere, I think. My mail comes here, but so too do my paychecks. I told the bartender \"one drink\".
She stuck a straw in a bottle of Jameson and said \"sure, here\". 
I laughed.... 
She was serious. 
I was a young man, full of hope and optimism. Now, I'm full of Santorini wings, and a pickled liver. 
Please help me.... 
Tell my kids I love them. 
Loved them.
I only love tick tock now. 
Tick tock took my wife. 
Tick tock is my life.

{"text":"If I were to come home and ask my parents to make me the best meal they could possible think of, I am confident they would say, \"son, you need to high-tail it right now to the Tick Tock Tavern because they are the only ones capable of making you that happy\".

The food here tastes exquisite and you can tell that the owner Chris puts his soul into his meals. He was there to greet me at the door as if I've known him all of my life.  I've been here multiple times now, trying different things and I'm having the hardest time NOT liking something.  His Greek food is delicious (probably because he's Greek), the dishes are beyond affordable (I was actually offended with how cheap the prices were), and the St. Louis ribs made me dance a little out of pure joy.  

I wish more people knew about this place because it deserves all the praise.  I'll definitely be going back here and I will continue to share this place with complete strangers, while standing in line... or rolling down my window at a red light and telling the car next to me."}

Had eaten here several years ago and wasn't impressed then but I figured we'd give it another try as we were in the area.  

I should've taken a clue from the fact that we were the only people in the dining room. I ordered the open-face roast beef which for me is a litmus test sort of item. If you can screw it up, something's wrong. Well let me tell you, the mashed potatoes were instant - watery and tasteless. Maybe that's why they were smothered in a gravy that was so salty it was inedible. The roast beef was paper thin and reminded me of the cheap crap that comes pre-bagged at low-budget grocery stores. But honestly, the problem overall was the saltiness. So the waitress comes and asks how everything is, I ask for a box. What I should have asked for was for the roast beef to be taken off our bill because she could see I'd only eaten maybe 5 bites of it if that much, but whatever. She brings me the box and I tell her about the salt factor. \"Oh, hm. See sometimes they make it and it's too salty but then they taste it and it's okay...I'll tell them.\" She comes back with the bill - I'm thinking well maybe she'd at least take half off, but no. She says she told the cooks about it. Well that doesn't do me much good since I'm still hungry and out the price of lunch. 

My son was with me and I gave it to him to feed to the stray cats at his place later but even then I told him to rinse the meat off. 

I will never go back to this restaurant nor will I refer anyone. Fool me once, fool me twice as the saying goes."}
{"text":"Tick Tock draws some of the best crowds of any bar. There is a lot of weirdness. If you are looking for an authentic, weird experience in Cleveland, Tick Tock is where it is at. Places like Austin, TX and Portland, OR claim to be weird or pride themselves on it. Tick Tock is really weird and wants to be normal. 

The picture that Steve L posted says it all. A dude straddling over another guy with his knees pinning the other guy's arms down and his crotch in his face. That is the physical manifestation Tick Tock. It is like Marty's dance quintet in Big Lebowski. His \"cycle\". 

There is a superb Youtube video of two drunk girls fighting in the daylight outside Tick Tock on Clifton Blvd:

Like that one country singer who sang the terrible song said \"I love this bar\". To the Tick Tock you don't stop!"}
{"text":"Congrats, my first one star rating. Cheap barely edible food. This place was a destination 20 years ago. Now it's just an abomination."}
{"text":"Just home from a Saturday night dinner with hubby and son.  I had the special, stuffed peppers with mashes, really good very homemade looking and tasting ! The bread basket was fresh, salads w/their own ranch dressing was super !  Portions are large, so we have enough for lunch tomorrow !! Hubby felt like he did not even put a dent into his chicken stir-fry!  Son loved his Jack Burger !  Oh, we had the Teriyaki chicken skewers with peanut sauce, very tasty !!   The prices are super, they accepted our restaurant.com certificate with ease, so our bill was really low considering all we had to eat!  The waitresses are attentive.  We have been eating here for several years, at least 2 to 3 time a year since we moved and its still very good food."}
{"text":"We have eaten her a couple of times.  The food is great for the price.  I would definitely recommend this for a good inexpensive meal."}
{"text":"I used to love Tick Tock and would eat here several times a month. The service was so-so but I knew the food was good and the prices decent. The last 2 times I visited here the food has significantly decreased in quality. I will not be coming back. When I feel scared to eat the food I know it's not a place to come to again. It's super disappointing because I really loved this restaurant!"}
{"text":"This place is extremely underrated. There's a bar and a restaurant connected by a door. I haven't been to the bar but it was a decent size with lots of tvs. The restaurant part reminds me of a cheap diner, so if you're looking for great ambiance, don't come here. 

The important part is the food. Its delicious from the bread and salad (great house dressing) to the meal itself. You will not leave here hungry, ever. You get a ton of food, its delicious, and the prices can't be beat. You'll be hard pressed to spend more then $25- $30 for two here, but the food tastes so good. 

Lastly, the food is all home made and it tastes like it. Servers are very friendly and helpful too. Highly recommend for a casual dinner if your concern is food and value."}
{"text":"We went to the Tick Tock years ago. The sauce was unique and ribs were great. What a disappointment tonight. Fatty ribs with no flavor. Tasted like they had been baked not rotisserie like they use to be. Flavorless! The sauce is not the original."}
{"text":"An awesome dive bar with great ribs on the west side! Despite living practically across the street for months, I never stepped foot inside for food other than the occasional beer. I'm happy to say I've had their St. Louis styled ribs with a cajun dry rub and was impressed. The meat was well cooked, the seasoning was fantastic and the sides - fries and coleslaw, were fantastic. Decent drink selection too."}

There a few times that I would ever walk out of a restaurant without getting my food. I am patient, will give anyone the benefit that the kitchen could be slow, orders backed up, etc... but this experience was so incredibly awful that I left and didn't feel one bit of remorse. Started nice enough, my friend and I just wanted some dinner to go. We we're just passing through Ohio on a cross country road trip, got in late and needed a quick bite, before we hit our Airbnb. We ordered two Caesar salads. Simple enough. After roughly 25 minutes our waitress came over and said \"oh, sorry, the kitchen needed to cut up new lettuce,\" okay awesome. 

After this we remembered the recent E. Coli outbreak and realized the salads were made with romaine. We needed to wait another 10 minutes roughly to chat with a waitress regarding our concerns. When she arrived we wanted to ask the waitress where the romaine lettuce is grown that they use, and our conversation went as follows..

Me: \"Excuse me, so, I'm so sorry, but I didn't know even think about it when we ordered salads, but there's been that E. Coli romaine outbreak\"
Waitress: interrupting me \"Oh, no, I don't believe that.\"
Me: \"... I'm so sorry, you don't believe E. Coli exists?\"
Waitress: \"Oh yeah, I don't think it's real... well lots of places are doing there thing and I have heard anything... I just saw it in the internet.\"

At this point my friend and I felt it was prudent we leave this establishment and left before our meals came out and after roughly 45-50 minute of waiting for our salads"}
