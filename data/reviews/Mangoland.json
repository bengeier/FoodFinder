{"text":"My husband and I happily stumbled across this awesome food kiosk in CrossIron Mills yesterday when we were strolling around before heading back to Edmonton.  I was so impressed that I had to be the first person to not only add this business to Yelp, but also to write up a firet review for them!

The first thing that caught my eye was the bright and happy sign proclaiming Mango Land! I looooooove anything mango so immediately I pulled my hubs to the display. Surprisingly I realized quickly not only does this place serve up fresh mango in different ways, but that they are a Colombian chain and serve up many other Colombian snack favourites like Salpicon (kind of like a fruit salad); Cholao (kind of like a slushy & fruity drink); regular fruit salad or with ice cream added; other fruity or ice-cream laden drinks; plus popular hot cheesy breads like buñuelos, pan de bono and almojabanas!!! Score!! I love all these breads and have missed having them while I was in Colombia a few years ago! Plus there's another popular snack called Obleas which is essentially two large thin round wafers with arequipe (dulce de leche) smeared in between. 

Important to note is that all the fruit that they offer in their creations are FRESH!! (Well except for the maraschino cherry toppers!)

I ended up being able to try all three of their cheese breads and for the most part they tasted equally delicious! We had originally ordered just 2 each of the buñuelos and pan de bono. But when I went to take a bite of the pan de bono, it had been heated up too long so the bottom was burnt and hard. But not a problem as I just went back to let them know and with no hesitation they replaced the two with two almojabanas (as they were out of everything else). Don't let that dissuade you from trying all three varieties though! They have slightly different tastes and textures and are served hot! Soooo good!

The hubs ordered a Cholao which looked amazing! We both said \"Wow!\" when the drink was handed over as it was overflowing with color and fruit and slush! I didn't try any as I try to avoid straight dairy but he enjoyed it!

It's so great to see someone bringing the spotlight of Colombian goodies to Alberta! Whoever you are... Good for you! I think they have another location in Deerfoot Mall too. 

The service from the two lovely gals at the stand yesterday was also great and friendly!

Bonus: They have 4 tablets set up on one side of the stand so you can play games while you wait for you order to be prepared!"}
{"text":"Mmm food is good if they would have enough supplies and products of the menu .  Not sure if because they are renovating there are not plenty of fruits or other products.
Long ride to CrossIron and desapointing because of that.
