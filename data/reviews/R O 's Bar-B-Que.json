{"text":"Over all I am underwhelmed. The slaw is very good, and the cherry sundrop is a local favorite. But for the money I spent on the sandwich it was small and not very satisfying. For almost $5 I think a squashed hamburger bun with less than 1/4\" of meat (sandwich was pressed, but still thin on the actual BBQ.) is kinda weak. Staff was friendly, but i would look else where for BBQ."}
{"text":"I had never been to RO's.  I was driving by there today, though, and picked up a take-out order, a minced pork platter. It was completely disgusting and inedible.  The meat was completely dry and minced down so fine it looked like beach sand in the bottom of the foam plate.  The packets of institutional-type packaged barbeque sauce were disgusting. What passes for cole slaw is more like sloppy soup. The fries were unremarkable frozen crinkle cut. Absolutely a stretch to call this barbeque.  To quote Poe, \"Nevermore.\""}
{"text":"The BBQ was amazing and the hot dogs where the beat I have had in while and you get a lot for ur money which I like"}
{"text":"I grew up on ro's BBQ and everyone and myself love it.  And yes their slaw is the best.  You can't beat a slaw burger with cheese on an always toasted bun.  Curbside service.   People from Kansas don't know what the hell they are talking about!"}
{"text":"Not very good. I had the minced sandwich, which was probably a mistake. I should have had the sliced BBQ...... The roll the sandwich comes in is toasted, which I wasn't expecting. Mine was a little bit \"too toasted\", which means burnt!  It was a nice atmosphere, and the employees were extremely nice, however, the BBQ just wasn't that good."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit to R.O.'s.  I normally go to Black's but, they are on their annual July vacation.  The food is good but not as good as Black's.  My main issue with the restaurant is their service.  It took about 20 minutes to get my food.  It was busy however; they were preparing the food out of order.  I was ticket 876.  When I was getting my food, ticket 871 was asking where their food was."}
{"text":"Just to clarify. I have not been to Ro's in 10 years. The review is from memory. I spent many an evening going to RO's as a child."}
{"text":"Maybe I've been spoiled by the great Carolina and Kansas BBQ places that I've been to, but R O's was extremely disappointing, to say the least. The chopped pork was very dry with little to no flavor, and how can you call yourself a BBQ joint when you serve pre-packaged Bull's Eye BBQ sauce with your plates... it made me think I was in a cheap fast food restaurant."}
{"text":"A BBQ spot I've been to many times over the past 30 years and RO's has never disappointed! If you're looking for good BBQ then look no further check em out you're tastebuds will thank you. While there get the cherry lemon Sundrop it'll knock your socks off."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! Everytime I am in Gastonia I make a trip to eat here. I even plan some trips around them. This is the best bbq and slaw in the world. I buy a pint or two of the slaw to take bake to Florida with me. Do yourself a favor and go eat there. And get the slaw!!!"}
{"text":"The slaw/sauce/dip is really what you come for.  It's different from what I have had before, but it's good. The meat itself is not spectacular, but it is what it is-an interesting local experience with really nice people in a clean environment."}
{"text":"Not my cup of slaw  I'll start off by saying I'm not from Gastonia.  If you live there and love RO's, then you already know about it and nothing I say here will make any difference other than annoy you because I'm going to insult a local institution.  If you are not from Gastonia, and you're in town looking for some Carolina barbecue, you'd be well advised to keep looking because you probably aren't going to like it.  One of the things I like about traveling on business is that I get to visit local places that are off the tourist path.  RO's in Gastonia appeared to fill the bill.  It's a dive with architecture in the Early Utility Shed style.  The parking lot was covered up with cars and people.  Some people were eating in their cars and staff members were running out to the cars to take orders.  Obviously a local favorite.  Good signs proving that there is no accounting for taste.  The interior decor matched the exterior in all its dingy glory, but an A rating from the local Health Department was prominently displayed.  We waited behind 3 or 4 other customers to get to the counter.  I ordered a sliced pork sandwich.  My companions ordered chopped pork sandwiches with fries and onion rings, and a cup of \"barbecue slaw.\"    The sandwiches, fries and rings arrived in grease-stained wax paper -- a look back to another time while the slaw came in a foam cup.  I eagerly unwrapped my sandwich to discover bland pork loin slices drenched in pink mayonnaise that soaked through a soggy bun.  Other reviews here have called the pink sauce spicy.  Maybe it's because of my southwest tastes, but the word \"spicy\" never entered my mind.  Bland and mayonnaisey was my take.  The slaw, which appeared to be more pink mayonnaise than cabbage, was soupy and also bland.  We all looked at each other and knew that we had made a mistake.  RO's is obviously a local institution with a loyal following.  That's fine.  If you aren't from there and haven't been raised on the pink stuff, my bet is you won't like it.  To those who know and love it, well, enjoy!  You can have my place in line."}
{"text":"The bbq at RO's is not pit-cooked bbq,never has been,and has never pretended to be-A Gastonia \"BBQ\"is a unique roast pork SANDWICH-sliced or minced-I've been eating here almost 60 years,never had a bbq plate or know anyone to order one and would NEVER think of putting any bbq sauce other than the slaw-which is really more of a sauce-on this meat,although the roast pork sandwich with lettuce,tomato,and mayo is very good.There used to be a lot of places in Gastonia selling this type of bbq-Tom's and Van's(my favorite 40 years ago)are long gone and only Black's and RO's remain-The slaw is also great on hot dogs and burgers-The onion rings used to be heavily battered and very unique,but now they're quite ordinary and mediocre-Other than the onion rings the food's just as good as it ever was.They've started taking credit cards but don't tell you there's a fifty-cent fee for doing so-I noticed the tiny sign with this information AFTER I paid-I guess they want the increased business taking cards will encourage,but want to pretend to be such a great value they have to charge a fee-Which is ridiculous since they're overpriced with minimal service anyway-I notice on the menu they now charge $2 for a slawburger-which might be worth fifty cents as a novelty-Pretty shabby and sad-I have a lot of nostalgic affection for this place and the food and wish I could give it 5 stars-C'est la vie."}
{"text":"Sure, I come here.  But not for the BBQ, which is tasty, but mainly for the cherry sundrop. The sandwiches are messy, and as I stated, tasty.    RO's is a Gastonain tradition.  It's been around for a while.  Are there better BBQ joints?  Of course!  But it's quick, no frills, and hits the spot."}
{"text":"The slaw sauce is a must have.  They have many options on what to have burgers, dogs, minced pork.  This isn't BBQ as you see on TV, it's a love it or hate it place."}
{"text":"i agree w/all of you, my friends wife is from that area and got me to eat there a cpl of times....people from that area think this place is the Second Coming of BBQ...its not good at all...only thing I will give them props for is their R.O.'s Hot Slaw, pretty good stuff"}
{"text":"Little fast food joint in Gastonia, NC. Sliced bbq and pimento cheese on toast were good, and the slaw/dressing was super yummy! The place had a lot of character,  but I think maybe I have overindulged a bit to much to give a truly impartial review."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I'm a native Gastonian, and I grew up regularly eating RO's BBQ. My dad even worked there, back when the waiters were required to be attractive. That was apparently part of the appeal, my mom tells me. Pull up, handsome guy comes to take your order and delivers the food to your car with a wink and a smile.   BUT  That was 1989, and I am not blinded by nostalgia. It has become apparent that in recent years, RO's has relied less on taste and quality and more on the misplaced trust of patrons from years past.   The RO's slaw is the main attraction for most natives. The closest thing I can relate it to is thousand island. Hell, it just may BE thousand island with a little spice added in.  I hadn't eaten here in quite some time when I brought my out of town fiancé to the food truck on the corner to try it out (after explaining the decor of the main restaurant wasn't anything special). If you decide to try the main location, thinking maybe this was a food truck experience gone awry, read on. The main location (in scenic ghetto Gastonia) has tiny booths, the chairs do not move, there is no handicap seating available, and the waitstaff seem more interested in socializing with one another than serving you. This is especially true if you eat inside, where tips aren't expected, vs eating in your car where I guess you're supposed to tip them for walking that 15 feet you didn't feel comfortable traversing.   We ordered two platters ($19.11 total, one minced, one \"pulled pork\". The \"pulled pork\" is listed as a third option but truly, it is just the same thing as option number one: sliced.   Thankfully, the staff was very nice and talkative.  What I was most grateful for however was that the \"slaw\" came in a separate container, and you put the meat on the buns yourself.  Granted they are store bought buns they warm up and flatten.   The meat. Dead. That's the only word for it. Or maybe \"gray\". No, dead sums it up. My fiancé's \"minced\" meat was pulverized and decimated to the point that he didn't even realize it was supposed to go on the sandwich. It was buried under hush puppies and pale, undercooked fries, to be fair. His comment that really struck me was \"...is...what is this...? Is it cat food?\" My \"pulled pork\" aka \"sliced\" pork, was pale gray and darker gray and seriously resembled what month-old turkey slices may look like.  It didn't taste like pork. I seriously am doubting whether they truly use pork at all, or whether they have a secret deal with the local pound for cheap meat.  I kid you not, it looked disgusting.   While it *looked* disgusting, it didn't particularly taste like anything. It was just dry, so dry. So, so dry. The only way to make it edible would be to coat it in the thousand island- I mean, slaw.   They do give you two tiny packets of tomato based BBQ sauce that they probably buy in bulk from Sam's Club.   Silver lining: the hushpuppies were okay. Teensy tiny, but okay.   If you still think you ought to give RO's the good ole' college try in memoriam of your delicious, nostalgic childhood memories: DON'T... but if you must... bring cash- no debit/credit cards allowed."}
{"text":"I first ate at this place in1971. Was very good then and busy. Cherry, lemon, sun drop was fantastic. Had a slice of lemon and a cherry or two also. Now is a different story. No more cherries and the food is marginal at best. Menu is too long. Who needs to sit and study the menu for 10 min.  Fries were terrible. Soggy and from the frozen variety. Need fresh fries. Cheaper and taste great. The BBQ sandwich has really changed over the years. It used to be hot with a good portion of meat and slaw. Now it is a small amount of meat and slaw smashed in a bun and cooked in a \"MICROWAVE\"!  Are you kidding me?  They charge an arm and a leg for this processed food they serve. They are living off their past reputation. Sorry, that doesn't work. Food speaks for it self.  The dinning room is a joke! It sounds like you are in a drum. No sound deadening material at all. Ketchup comes in little packets. 15 or 20 of these will work for your fries. Of course the fries will be cold after you spend all of you time squirting them all over your plate and hands. Location of RO's is deep in the hood. Work your way past the prostitutes and druggies and you will be greeted inside by local cop on weekends. Nice place......"}
{"text":"YUCK.  Sliced pork sandwich was gray and had the consistency and flavor of warmed sliced processed deli meat. There is a reason the pork is covered in the slaw sauce stuff - to hide that bruised looking pork. The slaw sauce was ok...kind of a pickley thousand island with cabbage. The pimento cheese was good but not great. The cherry sun drop was tasty like a cherry slushy. Bottom line - it's true that you eat with your eyes first and that gray meat blinded my appetite."}
{"text":"They have the best cheeseburgers anyone could ever ask for! My first one was so big that I couldn't finish it even though I wanted to! And their fries are to die for. Best service so far."}
{"text":"I had such high expectations, only for them to be dashed--so dashed.  I ordered the RO's lunch plate. I'll start with the end first, and then go back to the beginning. Tears. I was almost in tears at the end. I was so let down--my expectations for delicious North Carolina barbecue dashed. I mean, if this god-forsaken place isn't good for barbecue, what is it good for?   The lunch place came with a pile of shaved pork (rather than minced--which sounded unappetizing), about 5 onion rings, a scoop of fries, two hamburger buns, two small prepackaged packs of barbecue sauce, a small container of their \"famous slaw\", about 6 hushpuppies, and another small container of their baked beans.  The slaw: Picture cabbage chopped very finely in a food processor and mixed with a 90/10 mayo/tomato sauce mixture. Yuck.  Baked beans: Served at room temperature. I think they just opened the can, too, so maybe they consider them fresh. I can open a can of beans at home, though. And mine taste better.  The fries: Tasted like bland, regular fries. Probably previously frozen. I ate one. Eh.  The onion rings: Tasted premade and reheated--again, probably previously frozen. Overbattered, no onion flavor. No flavor at all, really.  The buns: Squished and warmed, unappetizing. Bland.   The hushpuppies: When I ate the first one, I couldn't believe my mouth. How could something be so devoid of flavor? I ate two more trying to find some flavor. Nothing.   The meat: A travesty. They tasted like they were marinated in water and cooked nowhere near a barbecue or smoker. The meat was terrible; it was so bland.  The barbecue sauce: Prepackaged from some distributing company in Georgia. I don't have anything against Georgia, but in my opinion any self-respecting barbecue joint should be making their own sauce. And if they don't use a sauce, their meat should be bursting with so much flavor that the idea of using sauce would be absurd.  All this cost NINE DOLLARS AND FIFTEEN CENTS!! That would normally be on the steep side, but it was terrible. To me, I tasted that no effort had been put into the food. It was a culinary travesty. I ate the meat, tasted everything else, and tossed the rest."}
{"text":"This is the best bbq sandwich on the planet. Put everything you know about bbq aside and open your mind to something unique and spectacular. I now live near Memphis, a bbq capital, and I have had bbq in Texas, Kansas, MO, and lots of other places. I had this style of unique lean pork deicacy beginning when I was just 4 years old and everytime I get within 10 0 miles of RO's I make the trip, and get lots to go. Try the sliced bbq sandwich that has an amazing and uinque slaw and get ready to be gown away. Whoever writes funky reviews for this place must have been expecting something familiar, but trust me you have not had anything like this before, and can't find it anywhere else, period. Expand your horizons and get ready for a new absolute favorite...... Go to RO's, and I would be grateful if you could FedEx me a dozen or so sandwiches :-) This place is really terrific!"}
{"text":"Maybe back in the day this was acceptable as BBQ. In Gastonia we now have so many places that are so much closer to what southern barbecue is supposed to be, and this is really nothing but bland roasted dry pork roast, zerosmoke is added, and they are doing it in their version of BBQ slaw. They're BBQ slaw used to be decent until they started marketing it and stores, now it is full of shelf stabling nitrates and other junk preservatives. Their pricing has gone completely nuts, and if you stop by their mobile truck they tend to park in Mount Holly and Belmont you will pay double what you pay in their store. I recommend you skip it, head down to Ray's country Smokehouse, or go to Mount Holly to Peace & hominy, even Carolina Country Barbecue is bad as it is is better than RO's. If you really want to buy some barbecue slaw to put on your properly cooked pork barbecue at home, get it from raise or go to Black's Barbecue on South 321. I don't recommend their pork either but they make good slaw. You can also go to Bessemer City to McDonald's family restaurant and get the version of this BBQ done properly with Excellence law"}
{"text":"$25 right down the drain. French fries were 100% under done and terrible as they came out. The sandwich...LOL! Wow, is that what NC calls barbecue? That was the single nastiest sandwich I have ever eaten. Save your money and go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"A unique BBQ when their unique slaw is added to the BBQ.  I normally do not eat slaw on my BBQ Sandwhich but was encouraged to at R O's!  I am glad I did!  It was a good experience and a great meal!  Prices are right as well!  I will join them again soon for lunch!"}
{"text":"Is RO BBQ off of the beaten track, yes. Was it worth the  drive off of the interstate to get here, yes. Did this San Franciscan born, Los Angeles raised urbanite feel like he was in Mayberry, absolutely!   And that is part of the charm of RO. It's this North Carolina back country look and feel that gives this diner its nostalgic comfortable charm.  Don't get me wrong, the food is good also, but the ambiance is what did it for me. I felt like I went through a time warp and was looking for girls with poodles on their skirts and guys in hot rods......which (BTW) they had across the parking lot on this Saturday afternoon - PERFECT!   The lady's in our party of four had fried chicken and us men had chopped pulled pork sandwiches. We all shared hush puppies. Again, the food was real good. But their home made BBQ sauce was the star of this show. It was very good.  We ate, took pictures, grabbed menus as souvenirs and left for Asheville happy, content and feeling 50's / 60's. Darn, now leaving the time warp and getting back to 2016."}
{"text":"This was my first time at this barbecue joint and I must say it's probably one of the worst barbecue restaurant I have been to in the last 30 years. Although the restaurant was clean the food was ridiculously bad. This food is what you expect from a gas station.  First, this was a dine in order but everything is served in carry out boxes that you can eat at your table- no plates are available only styrofoam containers. The bbq is a very dry highly minced meat with absolutely no favor. Hard to believe considering Gastonia is bbq country. This placed has earned the 'Chef Boryardee' of bbq. Yes, their slaw/sauce was tasty and I recommend it. Additionally the bbq sauce comes in packets (picture attached) Just like public school cafeterias.  Also a cup of water is not free- only .75 a cup (tap water).  Don't waste your time or money- Fetchers bbq is close by and wonderful.  Lastly, the cashier didn't recommend the bbq either, I should had listened ...."}
{"text":"Been going there my whole life with my family. It's something that is Gastonia. Great food, service, and quality."}
{"text":"\"Shot's fired at Ora Mae's Bite Shop\" in Gastonia. Apparently these two business associates were having a discussion involving each other's wives and up come two nickel plated 38's. Neither was a very good marksman it looks like. Ody fired four shots...he hit the sidewalk, a parking meter, a fender, and the sleeve of Tommy Earl's favorite cashmere blazer. Tommy Earl fired four shots...he hit the sidewalk, the sky, the Cheerwine machine, and the loafer on Ody's left foot. It looked like he was going to lose his left toe but Ody told the paper \"That won't affect my golf swing none.\"   The article in the local paper was titled \"Gunfight at the Ora Mae Corral\"!  RO's is terrible. This is the worst \"BBQ\" I've ever had, and they smash the sandwiches flat for cryin' out loud. The extra star is for the slaw, which is one of the reasons I still visit North Carolina. Here's a tip, go to Harris Teeter and load up on slaw, and stay the hell away from this place."}
{"text":"Really old school atmosphere. The food was good. Felt like we should have got more food for the price but that's just my feeling. Although overall really good place to eat!!! Love the history and story behind the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a place for locals that rarely leave the city limits goes to.   I happily went with my neighbor to get food to go but I got it confused in my head with Kyle's that Ive heard great things. Total disappointment in the food and counter help. I think the BBQ coleslaw is a sloppy disgusting mess and the sliced BBQ pork looked like it was boiled. The smell totally turned me off when I opened the container when I got home. I ended up feeding my wasted $25 to my pug (I'm sorry for going that to you) This experience was as bad as my visit to Hillbilly BBQ on Garrison. Don't get their turkey because you get a slab of turkey bologna, yuck!!! I only go to RAYS SMOKEHOUSE when I want BBQ in Gastonia."}
{"text":"This feels like you are in the 1950's  I think it hasn't been updated since.  They seem to have the philosophy that if it isn't broke don't fix it I've been living here for 30 years and I alway get the same thing . I get the Chopped pork with their slaw It comes warm on a big Hamburg type roll and the slaw that is more like a sauce than the usual slaw you find in other places. Very unique and always good. This is one of the first stops when my kids come home  Get a container of slaw to take home   It good on anything  They sell the pork by the pound too, I often get that for parties"}
{"text":"Love eating here the cherry lemon sun drop is amazing. The food is worth and wait which isn't long any day. Last week I had an issue with a lady telling me to tell my 17 month old to quit laughing. So beware of snarky rude blonde headed women with an obvious loss of joy for life. What I love it's a family restaurant and a kids laughter is welcome!"}
{"text":"This venerable barbecue restaurant reminds me  a little of Snappy Lunch in Mt Airy - a following built on a single speciality food item, that is beloved locally by many, should be visited once by most of us for the uniqueness of it, and pretty much left at that.   The Pork Chop Sandwich of Snappy Lunch does seem somewhat more culinarily substantial than Pink Slaw, even an 11 ingredient Pink Slaw, but there is a certain uniqueness, a charming nostalgia, and undeniable character to this 66 year old family operated barbecue joint that somehow manages to draw you back - almost despite the barbecue.  The barbecue sans the famous slaw is tender, relatively moist, with no hint of smokiness - it is cooked in an electric pit; comes minced or very thinly sliced - all in all, rather bland. The addition of \"the slaw\" removes this barbecue combination forever from the Eastern vs Lexington equation - this is a different pork product now, and not one that I would seek out often - I'm just not a big fan of \"the slaw\" - it does not combine with the pork, it over powers it, and putting it on burgers or dogs, doesn't improve them either. And the Slaw Sandwich simply leaves the slaw totally on its own.  Still, there is much here to bring you back - the curb service is efficient and totally cool; the burgers here are pretty good (not as good as some found in nearby Cherryville, but pretty good), especially with the home made Pimento Cheese; and the Cherry Lemon Sundrop is definitely different. Unfortunately, the hot dog is not one I care for, the chili just doesn't get it done.  The folks here are friendly, efficient, and part of a family environment - the kitchen manager has been with this operation for 59 years, since he was 15 years old - hard to find that at many places. I'll visit again - probably for a burger, without slaw."}
{"text":"My husband just ate there yesterday and has not shut up about how awful and disgusting the BBQ is. All food awful, coleslaw and hush puppies shouldn't ever be served again. He said the only positive to the experience was the employees were nice."}
{"text":"OMG, Ellis, I am SO sorry to have to dump on your restaurant, but my meal from RO's tonight was absolutely HORRIBLE.    First off, BBQ must be cooked SLOWLY over a wood fire/coals - smoke must be present.  This stuff tasted like a bad pork roast, no smoke flavor (or any other flavor) whatsoever, just kinda bland.  I had the sliced, minced (eeww) was the other option; no pulled pork for me.  This place serves 100% food-service grade food.  I overheard the cashier talking to a lady about how they had to go up on their prices because \"Tyson went up on the price of hams\".  Hush puppies: greasy, not crisp on the outside, just kinda... thick.  French fries: ditto.  Onion rings: just above Burger King grade (sadly the 'rings were the best of the plate).  Baked beans: straight outta the can.  BBQ sauce: \"Bullseye\" food service single-serve container.   There was a container of what appeared to be mustard-ketchup-mayo sauce that was kinda interesting, but that was the ONLY food on the plate that  didn't look as if it fell off a US Foodservice truck.  In fairness to USF, the onion rings, fries and hush-puppies would have been a lot better if cooked properly.  I literally couldn't eat it - $7.99 + tax down the drain.  Look, I'm from SC.  I've been eating BBQ all my life - raised on the stuff - and I haven't had a decent BBQ plate since I moved to NC - these ppl are unbelievably BBQ deprived!  They use ELECTRIC COOKERS as a matter of course!  OMG - heresy!  \"Minced\" is a popular option - yeah, like i want my BBQ and my cole slaw to have the same consistency...  Is it just the Charlotte area, or is the whole state like this?         Anyway, RO's musta went WAYYY downhill in the last couple of years - it just plain sucked.  Don't waste your time or your money."}
{"text":"Best bbq sandwiches in Gastonia. It's so old school bruhhhhh. I usually get the minced bbq sandwich and an order of fries. Looks like a totally hole in he wall because you have to go through the hood to find it. Once you get here and take a bite of the meals here you won't regret it."}
{"text":"These guys do barbecue like nobody else. Their burgers rock and the turkey burger is the best I've ever eaten anywhere. This is truly a Gastonia secret that needs to be told to everyone."}
{"text":"Took my Mom and meet up with the family for a Saturday lunch. After 6 years since my last visit..I was overdue.   It's as good as it ever was. Sliced BBQ sandwich and that good tasting BBQ cole slaw. Wow, I sure missed it.  Too bad they don't have a large room for groups or even a big table, it's all booths."}
