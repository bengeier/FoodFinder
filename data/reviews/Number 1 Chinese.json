{"text":"I ate at this place consistently years ago and always found the kung pao chicken to be pretty good. This past weekend I ordered some orange chicken, General Tso's chicken, House Lo Mein and crab puffs. The crab puffs were standard and good, but the rest of the meal was kind of disappointing. The orange chicken was simply chicken in a sauce which I could tell was citrusy, but was mostly just sweet. It came with zero vegetables. The General Tso's chicken was the same breaded chicken as the orange chicken with some scallions for decoration, but otherwise very little vegetables again. The Lo Mein had more veggies and other types of meat, but the bulk of the vegetables were string beans-almost as many as the noodles. For $25 bucks, I just don't think it's a meal I'm willing to repeat again. Panda Express might have been better.   For anyone wondering, this is really a take-out place. They have one table in the very small establishment where I usually see their drivers sitting between orders. I don't think people actually eat there. Maybe a perky comment on my part, but the ladies that work there have adorable accents, sound really sweet and look totally huggable (I didn't actually try to hug them)."}
{"text":"Customer Service over the phone was very excellent. BUUUUTTTTTTTTT i waited an hour and still didnt get my food I ordered at 7:15 and they didnt arrive till 9:02 I was very upset i turned them away I wasn't hungry anymore..."}
{"text":"GROSSSS!! Order the egg foo young and it was stringy some kinda of contraption and the gravy was bland... If ya want real Chinese go to Ming and Gee!!"}
{"text":"I love the food here. For being fast food chinese its pretty good. This is the only chinese delivery place that delivers to my house, so I am glad they are good. Get the Canton spicy chicken or the Asian spicy lo mein if you like spicy. make sure you tell them you have a coupon for 3 free egg roles if you order over 15 bucks.!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoy the shrimp in lobster sauce and the veggies great and cheap fast chinese food."}
{"text":"Food was great and goood portion size, my kids and i had alot left over, delivery was like 15 minutes. I will be ordering from here again. FYI we got the lunch special very cheap and its allt of food."}
{"text":"New to the area and this is already my 3rd visit. Food has been delicious every time. It reminds me of the good chinese take out back in my hometown of N.Y.C.  I've never done delivery and the couple that own and run the place are always friendly and courteous.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place deserves nothing. I got house chicken and chicken fried rice. When I got home to mix the two I bit into it and found a thick sharp plastic!!!!! I didn't really care because I didn't swallow it no harm whatever. Called them to let them know. Or see if they can fix the problem for me because we are starving and find this crap in our food. Thinking they give us a new meal and a refund on the inconvenience and  apologize for the object they yelled at me! They yelled at me. Are you kidding me? told me if I wanted new food they wanted the old food in full. they asked me how much of it I ate. Making it seem like there doing me a favor. Wth no. I found a price of plastic that could've had me choke! I had to stop my meal to argue with these guys on the food for 20 minutes. To find out there's no way out of this. I hung up because I didn't care enough to argue in circles. But hey if you want A HUGE SHARP object in your food that the restaurant will blame you for then hey this is the place to go!!!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the previous negative reviews. We had take out delivered this evening and everything was great! The delivery came in just 20 minutes and everything was hot and delicious! I'm visiting from out of state but will be sure to order from Canton Wong next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Ordered around 11:05, yelp told me it wont be at my house untill 12:05 so i started cleaning the house at exactly 11:37 i hear a my door bell ring and theres my food. Food is nicely packaged and just looks good overall. The taste of everything is just soo goood."}
{"text":"We received terrible service at Canton Wong! We placed our order online and were given an estimated time of 45-60 minutes. After about an hour of not receiving our food we called and were told they had just finished making the food and it was out for delivery. We called again after 20 minutes of no food and were put on hold for several minutes and had to call back AGAIN to let them know we hadn't received our food - but again were told it was \"out for delivery\". We asked to speak with the manager and were told there was no manager on duty. They said it should be there in 5-6 minutes. It's been over about 1 hour and 45 minutes and we finally received our food."}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed by this place. Yes it's a hole in the wall. But I think they are very generous with their potions and flavorful. This is my go to place."}
{"text":"I'm so bummed this place was so awful! It's Chinese food for goodness sakes. Didn't think a place could make it so tasteless & just plain bad. 2 sick kids plus my self on Valentine's Day I was hoping for at least a yummy dinner for my poor husband and us. It was effing GROSS."}
{"text":"Everything fresh and hot. Tried cream cheese won tons, egg roll and orange chicken.  All very good.  I will go back for egg foo yung, chow fun, and spicy shrimp dish.  Well run establishment."}
{"text":"Omg this is the best Chinese food that I had I will definitely be ordering from here more offen"}
{"text":"WORST FOOD EVER ! Beef was slimy and no flavor, the sweet n sour beef was rock hard, the chowmein was angle hair thin with micro scoping pieces of egg and plenty off egg shells for that garunteed crunch every bite it's horrible, I ordered $50 in food to be delivered to my Apt and after the first few bites of every item, I Instantly threw everything into the trash, my first and last order from this place, just drive yourself to Panda Express and Dave the horror"}
{"text":"orange chicken was alittle spicy, in a good way.  the szechuan beef w/lo mein was really good too. food was still hot when it was delivered. i'd order from here again :)"}
{"text":"The egg drop soup is some of the best I've ever had. Unfortunately, after waiting more than an hour, the sweet and sour pork was soggy and flavorless and the accompanying fried rice was under cooked...I would say hard even. I only had one bite of my egg roll and did not like it. Not sure if it was the egg roll or the sweet and sour sauce. Let's just say, I few bites into the entree and it went in the trash. Thank goodness for the soup. It was the only stand out."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food I have had since moving to Arizona. Very tasty full of flavor and freshly made to order."}
{"text":"This place is now called Number 1 Chinese.  We have ordered delivery food from here a few times.  We have regretted it every time.  The food is entirely tasteless and slimy.  They skimp on the rice.  It sucks that there are very few good Chinese restaurants in the Phoenix area, and none are near our house.  I am writing this review basically to remind myself to never order from there again."}
{"text":"This is actually called Number 1 Chinese and it is ok... The egg drop soup was really good... The fried chicken wings were very greasy and over cooked... The dishes we had were just ok... The owners are very nice and it looked clean inside... We placed our order to go and it took around 15 mins... It was hot and order was correct..."}
{"text":"I love this place. Their dumplings are amazing sooo delicious and the sauce??? My gosh it's so damn good!!!! The orange chicken and fried rice I also recommend along with the sweet and sour chicken. My kids also enjoy the food, there is just so many dishes to chose from. My husband and I enjoy take out from this location. Every time I order delivery it's always on time and they always deliver what I ask for I absolutely recommend this place."}
{"text":"Every time I order from this place (Delivery) it's awesome. The services is nice and actually cheaper than ordering pizza. Idk I enjoy a Chinese Delivery Services any day or time."}
{"text":"So, this place is no longer at 6721 W Bethany Home Rd. Glendale, AZ 85303. Number 1 Chinese is there! And we get food from there at least once a week. We'll either order for delivery or we'll walk in and pick up ourselves but it's great food with great prices! The man and woman that cook up the food are so nice and the food is ALWAYS hot and fresh no matter if you pick up or get delivery! The egg drop soup is REAL egg drop soup! They will make the food the way you want it! It is family owned and the two kids that are always there always have a smile and hello for you when you walk in as they do their homework! You can even order online and the delivery price is less than $2, the man that delivers is fast, and they have great coupons! The only day they are closed are on Mondays.   number1chineseglendale.com"}
{"text":"Order taker spoke good english. The delivery woman was nice . Mongolian pork not enough pork. Should be called Mongolian onions. Sesame chicken too soggy. Too much rice and noodles as sides not enough entre. Egg rolls were okay crab puffs did not have enough cheese nor any crab or artificial crab for that matter. Won't order here again . Favorite thing from meal was the spicy mustard !"}
{"text":"We had several items delivered and it was great!  Delivery took about 20 minutes.  Everyone in the group of 6 were happy.  We ordered Kung pao chicken, moo shu veggies, pepper steak, Szechuan steak, Hawaiian blue plate, veggie fried rice and the crab wontons.  The were free because we ordered over $15.  Ordering process was easy and there were no communication issues.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I normally get Panda Express (yes I know, mainstream) but me and my family wanted something that delivered so I googled a close delivery place and this one came up. We got chow mien, sweet and sour chicken, pu pu platter, magnolian beef and cream cheese wontons. I am fully satisfied with all we ordered. I'll definitely be ordering from here again and I'll recommend it to anyone who wants to try a new Chinese place. 100x's better than Panda. Also they quoted me an hour for delivery and they delivered within 30 mins. Thank you for your service. I shall be back :)"}
{"text":"Order delivery as I just moved into the neighborhood and was starving after a super long day. Delivery service was fast, driver was really friendly and told me that after my 2nd order of delivery for over 20$ they give you a free 2liter or egg rolls thought that was awesome to know! As far as the food goes I had the dinner special  orange chicken, it was a great deal! portions were awesome but really soggy not my favorite the husband had the sesame chicken he said it was good but I think he would've ate anything lol!"}
{"text":"These guys are never open. It's a waste of time. It seems they close at the drop of a hat. Very unreliable. Good luck!"}
{"text":"This used to be cantong wong the food is Still good but the kid who answers the phone is not we will stillorder from them but hopefully won't have to talk to him again."}
{"text":"Yummy and not overpriced . Super fast too you order as you drive there and 10-15mins bam your order is all bagged up and ready to go. Don't mind the Mexican bar next door as it's a really small hole in the wall so takeout only. Family owned always the same people working there which is nice l."}
{"text":"Good tasting cheap takeout.  I enjoyed the house chicken, sesame chicken, rice and lo mein.  The crabpuffs and springroll were also good.  Lo mein could have used less sprouts but that is my only complaint."}
{"text":"First time eating here, I ordered delivery. I was Alittle nervous from the past reviews but decided to try it anyway. My order was perfect. The sauce was tasty for the orange chicken and sesame seed chicken. Everything was great. Portion size was excellent. Only thing was the chow mein, it was very thin noodles instead of the thick ones I'm used to, but nothing bad  to give it less stars."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery on GrubHub from this place. I got the jumbo shrimp with vegetables and a couple of spring rolls. The spring rolls were a little too greasy but the shrimp with vegetables was so yummy! I wasn't even that hungry and couldn't stop eating. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Decent delivery and chinese food is sub par. Good if you are in a quick hurry and need something for lunches as they come in nifty containers."}
{"text":"To sum up the long story below, save your time, money and energy. Super rude. Screwed up the order 3 times. And we got our food nearly 2 hours later.   So we ordered from here at 6:20. It is now 8:00.. Still no food. No manager, or anyone in charge we can speak with. We've called 3 times, first time (an hour after we placed the order) we were told the food was just finishing up and the driver will be on his way (we're literally a mile down the street).. After 20 mins we call a second time and we were put on hold for 6 minutes with hearing the employees just talk. So we hung up and called back and they told us he has many other orders to deliver before ours. After we asked for a manager or someone in charge they informed us that there is no working manager or anyone in charge for that matter and just passed the phone at least 4 times. Then they told us that since our order was online their machine was broken and they didn't get  our order... But when we told them our order 20 minutes earlier they said it was done cooking and the driver was on his way.. Weird. After we asked what they can do to fix the situation they told us maybe next time they'll give us a discount..  But there won't be a next time. So about 10 minutes later our food finally arrives.. And we're missing the order of sesame chicken and received chicken low mein instead if Vegetable lo mein for our friend who's a vegetarian. Sure enough we call them back and they ask me to double check the bag by 4 different people. Telling me that it is in there and making me feel like I was wrong for asking for the full order we've been waiting nearly 2 hours for. We had one bag of food, 4 meals and an appetizer. We received 3 of those meals and didn't even get our free liter of soda we added on.  So they said they'd bring it right away, which they did.. But again the order was still screwed up. We compared the orders from what I received in email for confirmation and what they had to redo since their machine was broken and it was wrong. Never ordering from here again. Save yourself a headache, time and money!!"}
{"text":"So good and so affordable, you guys are doing a great job !! Thank you we appreciate your business."}
{"text":"Got Some Dinner Yesterday! I moved to Phoenix from California & this food is just delightful.  The rice was tasty & there orange chicken was so amazing. I would recommend them incase you are craving some Genuine Chinese food."}
{"text":"I always order delivery from here through Grub Hub and I have tried other Chinese delivery places that come about but I always end up coming back to Number 1. Now I know it is a delivery place so I don't expect anything fancy but the food is not bad so I can't complain. Plus I like the coupons that add just a little more for free. The delivery drivers lately have been random people but I usually get this Eastern European guy who's English isn't always the best but he is just a really cool guy."}
{"text":"We've been craving Chinese for a few days & since Number 1 is the closest, fastest, cheapest to us that delivers, we decided to try them out again after a several month hiatus.   I don't know if there is a new chef or new management with better quality controls or if its just been too long since we had Chinese but the food today was aaaah-maaaazing! Fabulous rich flavors & super moist rice. Very satisfying meal today! We'll gladly make Number 1 our go to for as long as the quality stays like this!"}
