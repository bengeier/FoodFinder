{"text":"BEWARE!  If you pay for your food with a debit or credit card at Luciano's Bethel Park, watch your statement carefully.  It is a shame that I am compelled to write this because Luciano's has some of our favorite pizza in the South Hills.  However, I have now caught them processing my charge for more than what I wrote on the slip for the second time.  Once is an \"accident\" but two times is a pattern.  This is THEFT and I don't appreciate it.  The amount was insignificant, but I had already tipped 20%.  If you must patronize Luciano's I strongly suggest you pay with cash."}
{"text":"Great pizza, BUT be careful while you order. Specially when picking up - make sure your box has what you ordered. No matter if order details are repeated several times by both parties you could end up with something different."}
{"text":"Their pizza and salads are great!  We ordered French fries once, they were mushy, gross, and the serving size was very small for the price. I wouldn't order them again.  The delivery time is usually always around 45 minutes or more  but the food arrives hot and fresh."}
{"text":"Great local pizza shop.  The pizza is one of my top 5 ever. I could probably eat it everyday but I won't haha. The Italian hoagies there are great too!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come home to the burgh I make it a point to stop here.  Having lived in various other parts of the country and the world I can safely say that Lucianos has the best pizza.  A large pizza with 2 toppings will be at least $20 but its worth it.  Slices are large and toppings are plentiful.  If the pizza is delivered in a timely manner and the cheese is still warm you will be delighted.  Should your delivery driver stop a smoke a dubbie with his friends (most of the delivery guys are high school seniors) you may be a little let down.  Regardless of temperature, lucianos is still the best around!!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here since I was 4 to my earliest recollection, and I've NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED. Arguably the best Italian subs I've had in my life still. The pizza is light but they don't BS you on sauce or cheese, it's good stuff. Their meals are fantastic, chicken parm ( a classic) is still my favorite meal.(next to those Italian subs that are more addicting that soda). Oh, and if you ask for extra toppings/sauce/cheese, be prepared, they don't mess around here. You're getting you're extras and you're gonna like it. Garunteed"}
{"text":"Best pizza EVER. I have not found any pizza places that are better than this. I live far away from it now, but will drove over an hour just to get some bacon and pepperoni deliciousness!!! Their dining room is small but if you get there early, you will be seated right away."}
{"text":"This place is good, and consistent.   The eat-in experience is pretty nice, there are standard beers on tap and the small dining room doesn't get too crowded.  However, this is the type of place you might want to avoid on a Friday night when EVERYONE wants pizza - expect a bit of a wait.  But it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Always prompt service. Pretty damn good pizza, at least the white pizza. It's the only one I've ordered. I eat pizza so infrequently I stay with my old standby. White Pizza done right."}
{"text":"I love Luciano's. My family has been ordering from this location for over 15 years and we have never been disappointed. Don't go here for a nice, sit-down meal. Their dining room is very small. However, the dining room isn't he highlight of this place; it's the pizza. I live out of town now, but whenever I come home to visit, Luciano's is at the top of my to-do list. The toppings are fresh and the crust is excellent. (Their breadsticks are delicious, too!) Call them up for carry out or delivery. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"We love this place for dine-in and delivery. It's nothing fancy, but it doesn't need to be. It's good pizza. The crust is just right, the sauces have good flavor, and good toppings too."}
{"text":"Poor attitude trumps good food!  Went in to place an order for take out and while I was waiting (30 min) for my food, I had the pleasure of listening to the staff complain relentlessly about their customers. One girl shouting out \"how can people call and expect their pizza on time when the order at 7pm on a Friday!\". Ummmmmm....customers call, place an order, you give a time, and they expect their food.... isnt that how it works????  The amount of complaining and banter that went on was entirely unprofessional and it has really changed my view of this business. I can't patronize an establishment that shows such public disrespect of their customers."}
{"text":"The service was exceptional. The food was delicious and the price was perfect. Their hoagies were fantastic."}
{"text":"The pizza is great, but I've called like a billion times in a row and their line is busy which is annoying when you need your fix of buffalo chicken pizza. Not cool, guys. Not cool."}
{"text":"This rating in concerning a visit November 21, 2014.  Visited the dining room for dinner, arriving at approximately 5:15pm.  The dining room was crowded , but nothing unusual for dinner time.  Order a hoagie and my wife eggplant parm along with drinks and salads.  The drinks and salads came in a timely manner, but after that things turned bad.  After waiting approximately 45 minutes the waitress informed us that one of the fryers were down.  This would delay our order for the chicken parm.  Next we were told that the printer that send the orders to the kitchen were not working properly which might be the reason our order wasn't complete as of 6:45pm. At no time did anyone suggest that we alter the order so that we could eat a little faster, possibly change the chicken parm if the fryers were down.  We were about to leave mentioning this to the waitress, who told us our order just came up.  We decided to stay, but we're very surprised that the owner who was reportedly there at no time came up to our table and tried to make a bad situation better.  No offer of breadsticks or another beverage until the order came out, no apology or attempt to make a bad situation better.  We asked to speak to the manager, to which we were told what he looked like if we wanted to go talk to him.  We watched another table leave in disgust, part of the table receiving their order, part never did.  In this situation I feel the owner should take a minute and seek out the customer, not the other way around to try to make a very poor experience a little better. I then proceeded to write an email to the owner on their website and have gotten NO RESPONSE!!  Shame on you......"}
{"text":"RUDE RUDE RUDE RUDE ABSOLUTELY HORRID SERVICE WITH ABSOLUTELY ZERO PEOPLE STILL  The OWNER yelled at me and called me a liar when I called them to let them know that the order was messed up in addition to how rude two of the employees were when I placed my order and subsequently called to see how much longer it will take to get it delivered. Screamed like a tantrum ingredients toddler and told me to go ahead and dispute with the credit card. STAY AWAY PEOPLE"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice in the last 14 years.  The first time which was back in '02 I got very sick after eating their sauce.  Years later, 2012 I decided to give it another go, bad bad mistake as I got sick again.  I think it is their oily sauce.  Food in general their has no flavor and is bland, blah at best. There is another restaurant in Bethel Park which is equally gross called Danny's, must be the same owner?  There are a lot of great places to eat Italian in Bethel like Pasta Too.  Do yourself a favor, keep driving past this place and go to the other locations."}
{"text":"I order there multiple times a week and my last 4 orders have been wrong...I'll be going somewhere else sad because used to be a reliable spot for a good meal, sorry but you lost me."}
{"text":"I have had better, wings were uncooked and pizza lacked flavor"}
{"text":"The North Hills unfortunately lacks a \"premiere\" pizza place, and I've tried most of them. Luciano's is a solid pizza, and they are definitely affordable. We make it here every now and again, and rarely are we disappointed. Although, oddly enough on our last visit, I tried to order a Sierra Mist only to be told they no longer carry it - which is strange since they have Pepsi products.  The restaurant is small, and they tend to have families, which just means it can get loud on occasion."}
{"text":"Not their best showing!  Warm lettuce in a warm dish with warm dressing.  Rigatoni cooked (3) minutes past proper, slathered in a tepid pasta sauce.  80-degree cheap (I wouldn't have it if weren't cheap, I admit!) Malbec.  A roll delivered for...  desert???  I know it's not Mama Lena's or Tambellini's...  (I know:  I'm old!)  This was painful.  My wife's salad was the same.  Her ravioli was tepid; AND delivered (15) minutes before my rigatoni!  I know what Luciano's offers.  I've been there before.  That it's been many times would indicate my approval.  Not this time.    Our \"server\" needs (to be) schooled.  The supervisor, owner needs to know.  [He/she should've seen!]  This is one of those \"regret\" situations:  \"I know it's not much, but take it off my bill!\"  I didn't do that.  That's the second regret.  Going was my first.  I should've driven a bit further..."}
{"text":"This place is going down hill for pizza.  It was much better in the past.   The cheese on there lately is very salty and tastes like a cheap version of mozzerella.  Maybe they are trying to cut corners.  Whatever is the case, please don't buy cheaper ingredients owners!!!  For goodness sake offer a better cheese on your pizza's (like mix a good provolone with mozzerella ) and it will taste better and increase sales.    At this time, I prefer Ephesus pizza to yours."}
{"text":"We went there on sunday for a casual lunch, i ordered a veggie supreme pizza, my husband got half a steak hoagie, and mu daughter got a junior new york style pizza (essentially a cheese pizza with thin crust), we also got a bowl of wedding soup and zucchini for appetizer. Wedding soup was so so (a bit on the salty side), and i tasted my daughter's cheese pizza and it was so so. But my veggie pizza was delicious and my husband's hoagie is good with a decent portion. I would prob just order her the regular cheese rather than the thin crust next time. I do recommend it for family dining as the staff was very friendly and helpful. I would go back to this place again."}
{"text":"One word DELICIOUS. This is such a great change from the last place I lived. Employees are personable and helpful. The food is a 10/10. I cannot wait to try more items on their menu."}
{"text":"Took your advise and ordered BLT pizza.   Excellent.  Will order again. Always appreciate your efficiency.  Ann"}
{"text":"The spinach calzone ... add artichokes ....delicious.  The wedding soup is made onsite daily.  I like their white and traditional tomato sauce pizzas.  Extras are generous portions.  The front line staff are consistently friendly.    I usually do takeout ... my order is always accurate."}
{"text":"It's hard to believe I'm the first to review this incredible North Hills pizza destination.  The Luciano family has been serving up delicious, hand-tossed pizzas for dine-in, take-out, and delivery in McCandless Township for over 20 years. As far as I am concerned, they serve the best stuffed pizza (spinach or sausage) in the Pittsburgh area, while their traditional pizza is on par with some of best pizzerias in the region.  But the reason that I return to Luciano's is for their pan pizza with Chicago sauce, an incredibly zesty, wonderfully garlicky, red sauce that stands out as one of the very best pizza sauces I have ever tasted!  We first learned about Luciano's when we had friends living just off McKnight Road, but became addicted to their Chicago-style pan pizzas when I was working up the road in Warrendale and would stop down and pick up a pie to take home at least 2-3 times per month.  It's actually even better if you dine in, but the crust is robust enough to survive transport without becoming a liability."}
{"text":"Ordered a medium pan pizza with pepperoni. Did I eat it? Yes. Did I love it? No. Still can't find a killer pizza shop in the North Hills, but this is better than some. Delivery took almost an hour on a Tuesday."}
{"text":"Ate here last Friday night. As everyone knows, I am a pizza junkie. This place was great. We had excellent pizza. The dine in area is small but we had a short wait for a table.  Wait staff super friendly and helpful with menu. Wine was good and pizza was hot and crust baked perfectly. Love this place. Just sorry we were visiting family and live states away. If able, this would definitely be my \"go to \" pizza place."}
{"text":"Love their bruscetta and white pizza. 6 packs are what you'd expect at a pizza shop, with only a handful of craft options.  Seating area is either completely dead or very crowded depending on when you go.  I've only sat there once, on a weekend afternoon. When I've picked up my pizza, I've seen the dining room completely full. They do have a weekly unlimited pasta and soup special.   As far as delivery is concerned, they deliver quickly and their drivers act extremely professional; much more so than any pizza place I've ben a regular customer of. If you are a visitor perplexed about Pennsylvania's beer/liquor laws, you should know that neither Lucianos nor any other pizza shop (that I know of, at least) will deliver a six pack to your door.  Yeah, I definetely asked them..."}
{"text":"Used to love this pizza, ordered two pies recently for a construction crew, and only one came out of the oven, had to wait for the other to be made & cooked, then checked first one, and it was missing two of the three toppings!!!!...response was...\"it's a bad day back here!\"... no free pizza coupon, no discount...no more business from me!!!"}
{"text":"With about 30+ pizza shops in the area...why try Luciano's?...Because it is the best. Fresh dough...no shells...good sauce and toppings. Tried all 30...still go back to Luciano's when I have a hankering for a pizza."}
{"text":"My FAVORITE pizza!  Within the first two days visiting back in the Burgh it is either take out or eating at the restaurant.  I have converted my husband into being a pizza snob.....He now looks forward to real pizza when we visit!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area by far. No comparison. No argument. In fact it is the only pizza I've ever had in Pittsburgh that actually tastes like it is supposed to taste. Also, prices are very reasonable and delivery was very quick. Ny style with pepperoni was good and the Chicago style although it was kind of just a thick pizza (no butter crust) was very flavorful.   I will get from here now on. Never crossed my mind to try them because I usually order from eat24 or GrubHub. I'm also from NY like the previous reviewer and I agree that this place is very good and most other places in North hills are just not that great"}
{"text":"good pizza. would order Chicago stlye again"}
{"text":"No gluten free options. I had a gyro w/o pita, left hungry.  The pizza may be good, can't tell ya."}
{"text":"Good place for delivery when you've got a pizza and pasta craving.  I'd avoid ordering at a busy time though because they can end up running a little slow.  The pizza is consistently good and never stale or burnt.  If you're ordering their basic and traditional pizza, expect thin style pizza.  For the pasta, you can opt to order a half order of it instead of the full size and it's a decent sized portion.  If you're ordering something with specific alterations, be sure to emphasize what you want and repeat it because otherwise the people on the phone may get your order messed up.    The actual venue itself could be better.  The dining room is so tiny.  I wouldn't recommend eating there, go take a drive out to the Luciano's brick oven location in Mars if you're looking to dine in."}
{"text":"I've only ever eaten in. I get a certain craving sometimes... and that's for an old-school pizza joint. You know, the kind that is reminiscent of 80's video arcades, where you got a pizza and a pitcher of coke after the last game of a little league season or something.  After eating, you'd spend all your quarters on Galaga, Donkey Kong, or Gauntlet if the place was fortunate to have such an awesome four-simultaneous-player game.  Luciano's is my go-to place for this.  The smell (aroma if you will) hits you as soon as you enter. The pizza is a bit on the saucy side.  I always get a pepperoni pizza. Recently, I went there and got an Italian hoagie as well.  Bonus, if you read the menu, you can get a 2-liter for $2.75, whereas a pitcher costs you $7.50 I think.  I asked the waiter, and he sort of scowled and said, \"congratulations, you figured out our menu. I'm not supposed to recommend that you get that, but it's on our menu so if you want it, I'll get it.\"  I tipped him more than 20% because of the savings we got in drinks. He brought four cups for us along with the 2-liter.  The pizza is cheesy, it reminds me of Mineo's in Squirrel Hill."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza and the best when I'm visiting the North Hills! Great staff too. I'd recommend the PIZZA! Duh LOL   I usually get pepperoni, mushrooms and extra cheese.. enjoy"}
{"text":"First time customers and LAST time customers.  The appetizers of mushrooms and provolone sticks were mediocre at best but they give you a whopping bowl of sauce, I bet you can guess why.   The salad was a blahh salad with what you would buy from the supermarket in a fresh express bag. Basic  The dinners of pizza, calzones and gnocci were pathetic.  The pizza was a sloppy over sauced mess. The cheese calzone was undercooked and still raw.  The gnocci was undercooked so my wife sent it back. The person (not our waitress) said he'd take it back and give us the perfection we'd expect. Well it came out again and it left a horrible after taste and we're guessing they were freezer burned. Even my 16 year old daughter tasted one and spit it out immediately.  The service was pathetic but in her defense she was young so I'm guessing again that she wasn't trained properly. We had to ask for refills on our drinks and she literally pushed one glasses straw into the cup with her hand.   There was no offer from any employee to make our evening more satisfactory even after the complaint of freezer burned gnocci. Spend your hard earned money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Our effort to find good pizza delivery continues with Luciano's.  We ordered 2 of their specialty pizzas last night. ( buffalo chicken and Mediterranean). The Buffalo chicken was ok, but it had way too much bacon crumble on it, so it was very salty. A little bacon goes a long way IMO, especially when it's the Buffalo chicken taste that you want.  The Mediterranean was a little bland, though I have to say, they were generous with the olives, which is not usually the case with pizza places I have been to. The crust was ok. It was a little too thin and sloppy, but had an ok taste. As with every other pizza we have had since we got here, it was much better cold.  We also ordered onion rings. The portion was small, and I definitely would not have them delivered again because they put them in a hard plastic container that held steam and made them really soggy and gross.   It wasn't horrible, but we continue our search for proper pizza."}
{"text":"Luciano's makes their pizza exactly how I like it. Thin, floppy crust, slightly heavier on the sauce than the cheese, and the toppings are perfectly portioned. In a land of bleak pizza offerings Luciano's is certainly a bright spot."}
{"text":"You can find what you need for a good pie right here.  Good cheese, good sauce, and good dough.  Arguably, the older seasoned ovens also add an ingredient to the mix that adds to the perfection. The sauce is tomato-savory. The toppings are just the right amount, not too little and not too much.   Hoagies and Salads...nom nom nom.  They rival the pizza deliciousness to an extent that you may not be able to decide what to eat first.   They do get busy so check your takeout order before you leave.   Next time you want a pizza and six pack, stop here and you will be back again soon."}
{"text":"Been ordering their pan pizza for years...I think it's remarkable! Crisp, buttery crust, wonderful sauce and plenty of cheese. It's the BEST! The eat-in area is small but homey. Service was great...didn't feel rushed. Their Caesar salad was really good. It's no wonder they have been a local icon for years"}
{"text":"I have yet to find pizza that is better than Luciano's -- it has been my favorite for years. It's either less expensive than or on par, price-wise, with the pizza places around me now (I live in SF), but it doesn't compare, and every time I'm home, I try to get some. I think it's the sauce, or maybe the balance of ingredients -- it has just the right amounts of doughiness, cheese and tomato. Love, love, love."}
{"text":"We decided to order from here since we were at trader joes. The chicken supremacy pizza made white, garlic wings and tenders with fries. Wow the pizza was amazing Chicago style so flavorful. Wings were meaty nice garlic flavor and not over cooked only down side to them the wings tasted a little salty for me. But still delicious. You get only two chicken tenders but they are big and fries were good. I will definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Luciano's and I just recently moved to the area and have heard good things so I wanted to give it a try. I called at 6:40pm to place and order for pick up. They told me 30 minutes. So I went to pick it up at 7:15...I did not receive my order until 7:45. For reference I ordered a small pizza and a chicken salad, so it was not a large order. It was clear upon my arrival that they were backed up with a long line of customers waiting to pick up orders. Obviously they severely under estimated the amount of time needed to make their orders. I have never waited that long for a pizza during pickup and I don't know if I'll order again from them for this reason. I am only giving them 3 stars because the food was indeed very good."}
{"text":"I ordered a large pizza for delivery. ALL of the cheese was on one side of the pizza and they didn't bother to cut it. It took over an hour to get it. I will not be going back. Go to Bellisario's instead."}
{"text":"My husband and I are in Pittsburgh for the weekend and I was really craving pizza. Luciano's was close to our hotel and the reviews looked good so we decided to try it. Boy, we were not disappointed! We got a pizza with pepperoni, green olives and extra cheese-it was perfection. The crust was thin but not too thin. The sauce was perfect-not too sweet and didn't taste canned. Although the pizza was amazing the real winner was the wings. We got an order of their buffalo ranch wings and they were amazing. We will definitely return here next time we're in the area."}
{"text":"Worlds worse service I called at 5:10 for a delivery was told 45 minutes it's 2 hours and still haven't received my food. I called the manager and got I'm sorry"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places by my house. Its probably the best in shaler. I would rate them as one of the better tasting pizza places in the city. (Outside classics like Mineos and vincents) but definitely worth it. Both the standard crust and thick crust are awesome!"}
{"text":"I love Luciano's. This is pizza made by real \"pizza toughs\". Sometimes, when there is a party at Mom and Dad's house we get pizza from here. I like the sausage and mushroom a lot. Rica has never had it, which is her loss.   One time, we ate in the restaurant. I wanted a thin crust because I thought it would be more delicious, but Dad said, \"no, get the pan pizza, because you get more calories per dollar.\" It was still good, so I have no regrets."}
{"text":"I will say one thing. Every so often the hand tossed pizza is prepared by newbies and it is thin in parts and toppings weigh it down   The bad side.........the pizza slides off the crust almost every time. The workers say to not eat it hot. Well, my drive home  cooled down the pizza . I only get one topping on my pizza but this crust doesn't hold up.   This place makes a killing and offers no coupons. They aren't going to change because they are rolling in the dough!  When calling to complain, they just tell you they will make another one..  Fried zucchini is superb .  The pan pizza is light and airy, oddly so. It has been lukewarm lately. Don't order the Chicago sauce, it will weigh down your pan pizza.  They need to be humbled by more competition."}
{"text":"Sorry Luciano's.   I used to love you and order here a few times a month but you picked a bad day to have poor customer service.   I ordered delivery and requested two sides of dressing with my buffalo chicken pizza which you charge additional money for.   When my order showed up an hour later sans dressing you told me you were too busy to correct it (even though it was your error and you charged me for it) and couldn't have someone deliver it on their next delivery run because of how busy you were.  While you offered to refund the charge for the dressing via phone, I really had no interest in my pizza without the blue cheese and you refused to refund the delivery charge or the pizza via phone because the error wasn't large enough to warrant you eating the 11.30 you charged me for the pizza itself.  When I do delivery for convenience and pay to tip the driver and for a delivery charge (a combined extra $5 on my pizza charge) and am a regular customer, you could have treated me a little better instead of calling my request ridiculous.   Being in the customer service industry myself, I can tell you it takes much less effort and cost to retain an existing customer than it does to attract a new customer.   Also, I'm pretty sure making the effort to fix my one order, was worth the several hundreds if not thousands of dollars or more in business that I and the family I've recommended to you have contributed since I moved here.  Plus I previously raved about you on yelp and gave you free advertising!  And to top it all off, I was aggravated enough to drive there, return the pizza and get my full refund so you lost the entire sale anyway plus my future sales!"}
{"text":"Takin' it back to Old School cause its still \"SoCool\".   Luciano's is still the best Pizza spot in the South Hills next to their family's other pizzeria Fioris.   Always stellar service, consistency in sauce and dough. Amazing sauce!!  Yes, if you follow me, I am Gluten Free, so I had a HUGE Chicken Salad.   Alcohol available : Beer, Vino   Mangiare!"}
{"text":"We order Luciano's for delivery quite frequently. We have been patrons of the restaurant for over 15 years and the reason why we continue to order from them is their consistency. We always know what to expect from them and we love it. Their pizza is great; the ratio of crust to sauce to cheese is so important since too much cheese makes a pizza gummy, too much crust makes it too dry and too much sauce makes it, well, too saucy. You will not find any of those issues from Luciano's pizza.  We usually order a hoagie as well, we usually get the Italian which is always good but today we got the steak and it was fine but I think the Italian is better. Just my personal preference though.   I've also had their wings which are always just the way I like them too.   Delivery is fast and the food is always hot when it arrives. Affordable, fair prices. Maybe someday we will try something else new, but we just love our regular spread so much that it's hard to branch out. I'm sure we wouldn't be disappointed whenever we do decide to try a specialty pizza or another different menu item. I definitely recommend this place and we will continue to order from them!"}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty.darn.good.  My favorite kind of pizza is the thin crust, sweet sauce, dripping with oil kind - and this is it!  The pizza is really really good.  The wings, however, are hands down my favorite in the North Hills area.  We had the buffalo ranch and they were amazing.  Great flavor, still a little crispy, even after being slathered in the buffalo ranch sauce.  We found our new wing place. :-)"}
{"text":"Ive only been here once when i went on a trip from my hometown of Los Angeles to Pittsburgh, but i am a fan. the pizza was so so as far as i remember but the calzone.....i cannot find one as good as that anywhere else, and i have tried. soooo yummy. it appears as though the decor hasnt changed in a long while, but i found that to be very common in Pittsburgh...and of course beer to go...yuengling if i have anything to do with it....man i want to go back now..."}
{"text":"Do not base your visit on Heather's review.  Ive never had a bad meal here.  The pizza is excellent, among the best Ive ever tasted, regardless of if I eat in or take out. The crust on good pizza is supposed to show signs of flour. If you like it loaded with sauce and cheese, with crust thats always crispy and brown but not burnt, this is the place to try in the north hills.  The menu is full of classic Italian dishes that will not disappoint.  I almost dont want to sumit this post because I consider Lucianos the best kept secret in the McCand/Shal/Hamp area.  This I a fine family business that I am glad to patronize.  The owner employs several people in this small family restaurant.  He can be seen during the busiest times of day, working alongside of them.  Its a great place to order takeout and beer, or have a quiet, casual meal in the small dining room.   You need to order the cheesy garlic bread next time you call or stop."}
{"text":"LUCIANO'S used to be my favorite pizza place in the South Hills. When I first moved to Bethel Park and found out that there was a Luciano's in town (I had been to the one on Rt. 48 several times) I was extremely happy, because friends out on that side of town know it's the best pizza around.  When I looked at YELP and saw that somebody gave the Bethel Park Luciano's a ONE STAR RATING in a review, I had to laugh, because that jerk probably enjoys the cardboard garbage they serve down at Danny's!  Nothing like that \"vendetta review\" when somebody makes you angry, huh?  THE FACT IS that Luciano's has outstanding food.  Their pizza is first-rate, and so are their calzones.  (although what they call a calzone is actually a stromboli, technically.  You have to ASK for ricotta cheese...)  They have family dine-in specials like all-you-can-eat pasta, and the prices are very modest, while the quality of the food is great.  The hoagies are superb.  You can get a good beer on tap, or in a bottle, and you can get it delivered to your doorstep.  Luciano's is everything that a local pizza place should be, and it's even better because they have a nice little dining room with table service.  I have probably spent more money at Luciano's than I have at any other pizza place in my considerably long life of eating pizza, and only a couple of times have I ever been disappointed, mostly because the place was SLAMMED with lots of loyal customers and my food took a lot longer than usual as a result.  If I call in an order, I always ask the phone person to repeat my order to me, because Luciano's is a local joint, a low-budget place, and they hire the local kids.  It's AWESOME that they are hiring our local kids, the kids need money and they need to learn what it's like to work.  BUT, once in a while, a kid screws up.  They're kids, and they make mistakes, especially if they are new.  BUT, despite the fact that the faces working behind the counter are sometimes quite young, I've NEVER been disappointed in the food.  The only reason that Luciano's is #2 on my South Hills pizza preference right now is because somebody a couple of miles further away is surpassing them in quality right now.  I still call Luciano's, and their food is still in the 99th percentile, and this is not based on a small sample size or a single experience!  Pay no attention to  hotheads."}
{"text":"My family has been getting Luciano's take out for as long as we can remember, and the pizza is always excellent. We dabble in breadsticks, salads and hoagies too and nothing has ever been short of excellent. Love Luciano's!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Tuesday night with my fiance and a friend for dinner.  We arrived to a mostly empty dining and were told that we could sit anywhere.  The dining room is quite small, maybe 10 or so tables but was very bright and clean.  There weren't really any decorations to speak of but I will mention that I really enjoyed the cheese and red pepper flake shakers that they had on the table.  They had replaced the traditional caps that are at every other pizzeria with much better versions that while still controlling the flow allowed you to put on the right amount without getting clogged.  For dinner the three of us decided to split both a large pan pizza with no toppings and then a large traditional pizza with chicken as a topping.   As with most pizzas, they can be broken down into the major components, cheese, sauce and crust.  Both the cheese and the sauce were the same for both of the pizzas that we had ordered.  The cheese was actually pretty good and I enjoyed whenever I got a large amount of it on the piece that I was eating.  The sauce was, well, different.  Its not that it was bad as it was certainly acceptable but I couldn't put my finger on what made it different.  Finally the crust.  The pan pizza came out looking much like what you would get at a Pizza Hut but it certainly had a better texture and flavor.. While a Pizza Hut pizza is dense and greasy this pan pizza crust was crispy throughout and yet still kept a light and airy interior which was nice.  The traditional pie also had a good crust where the outside was crispy and the inside was warm and slightly doughy.  The chicken on the traditional pie was also good and as our friend said, \"not rubbery\".  I guess she has been to too many places that cook the heck of the chicken but this was not one of them.  The bottom line for me is that I would probably head back here again in the future.  While it is not at the top of my list for a traditional pizza I also would not stay away from it but if I was really craving a pan pizza, this is where I would head."}
{"text":"Been here and ordered from here several times.  We just went there Friday night (3/16/18), and horrible service as usual.  I've given them enough chances, and that was certainly the last time!  We waited 45 minutes for a pepperoni pizza.  Sat down and ordered at 4:55pm...didn't receive our pizza until 5:40pm!  Waitresses are very unfriendly, and the kitchen staff is just about the same.  They all seem rude, and bothered that you're there.  I just checked my bank statement, and they overcharged what I signed for.  This is actually the THIRD time they have done this to me.  This is theft! I hope people are very careful when paying with a credit/debit card.  Hate that we won't be returning, because the pizza is actually good. Nothing else on the menu is any good, but we really do like the pizza."}
{"text":"Their pizza is one of my favorites. Sauce is great. Employees are generally pleasant. We ordered 2 large plain pizzas tonight for $23. It was ready in 25 minutes and still hot when we got them home.  Only downfall is they don't deliver to our house."}
{"text":"We just returned from Luciano's on Clifton Rd without having eaten our meal. Why? Because we waited for at least 15 minutes for a table and not one employee looked our way much less talked to us! There we were standing as we watched an employee clean off a four top (which we assumed was for us). Well, she only cleaned half of the table then walked away! True story! I mean it's almost funny!  She then proceeds to go to a two top on the other end of the room. She started very slowly cleaning the two top. There were at least 4 dirty tables but I could see that at not only the rate she was going but the system she employed to clean off tables she was going to take an indefinitely long time! None of the other employees even looked our way!!! There were about five people working at this time from what I saw.  I walked over to a guy behind the counter and relayed our experience to him. He just shrugged his shoulders!!!!  Unbelievable!  We felt like they wanted us to leave so we did!!! Never again! We are a local family and I plan on blasting our horrible experience out to everyone I know!!! Who is running this joint anyway? So we went home hungry and called in an order to Lorenzo's (I spoke to a very pleasant/professional lady by the way)! I've had 100% better service at McDonald's! You'd have to Pay Me to ever eat or order food from Luciano's again!"}
{"text":"I tried their pizza for the first time not too long ago and was excited to order it again.  I was very disappointed with the phone service and will most likely not order there again.  The girl who answered purposely called me the wrong name twice (she called me Jenna) even after I spelled it out for her politely.  She was so quick to hang up after I placed my order and I didn't even give my card number to pay ( I had no cash on me ).  So when I called back to give my card number, a man answered and was also unpleasant.  I felt as though I was a burden to call back even when they should've asked if I was paying cash or credit the first time.  I'm very disappointed with the service, even though I loved the pizza, and that's a deal breaker for me. I work at the Apple Store where we see over a thousand people some days, so I understand what being busy is like, but that should not compromise the customer service."}
{"text":"Lucianos has always been a favorite of my families and continues to be so. I usually get a large pepperoni and sausage pizza that is a decent size (if you want bigger, get the 8th wonder lol). The calzone are also very good and large.  The only downside is if you eat in their dining room. It isn't very big and sometimes gets a little too crowded/loud, but other than that, you shouldn't go wrong with trying it out for some nom noms."}
{"text":"Best pizza ive ever had ! My family have dinner here often. The waitress are great remembers are drinks and food every time. I recommend this place to everyone!"}
{"text":"A group of my friends and I go here almost every week.  The service has always been great and polite, they just redid the inside to include better seating, and the best part is that they can split your check to any number of members.  We're going to miss the one server they had there though as she would know our usual order and bring us a round of Mt. Dews, 2 8th Wonders, and a side of bread sticks without even asking if we needed menus."}
{"text":"I've given this place 3 chances and they struck out. White pizza was the first try and it was basically a tortilla with cheese and garlic. The pepperoni, my bench marking pie, was just as lousy. Strike 3 was today when I ordered wings, garlic bread and a baked Italian hoagie. They forgot the dressing for the sandwich, the ranch for the wings and the food was flavorless and weak. Buffalo sauce is real easy to make, yet they botched that. The highlight from my meal was the luke-warm 20oz coke I got from the gas station across the street.   If you want a good pie in the North Hills, try Large Plain or La Bella's. if you want some comparable 'za, get a frozen Tony's."}
{"text":"Three strikes and you're out!  A two topping pizza...over $20 and it was terrible. It arrived slightly warm, under baked and soggy. They do have a good product if they could get their act together and bake a pizza right! Some good pizza warming bags like the guy on S. Park Rd. has would help too! Bye, Bye..we won't call again!"}
{"text":"I've had the same experience as a previous post.  Good pizza, missing an ingredient.  My order was for pick-up, so I didn't notice until I got home."}
{"text":"Got to update my review.  I phoned in my usual order of 2 medium pepperoni and pineapple pizzas.  The girl wrote down 1 pineapple and 1 pepperoni instead.  I could have dealt with the pepperoni pizza but not a pizza with just pineapple.  The young tall lanky guy, who I've never noticed there before, told me I have to pay for them anyway.  I said no, its not what I ordered.  He thought if they put raw pepperoni on the pizza it would make it right.  I don't think so, bub.  So he told me to not come back, ever.  Damn, that was the worst experience I've ever had anywhere.  They made a mistake, the cook said to the girl \"this is why you repeat back the order\" which means he knows the girl made a mistake.  Nevertheless, tall lanky kid was rude and told me not to come back.   Well, ok tall lanky dude.  I won't ever come back.  And I'll be sure to tell all my friends in Bethel Park to also never go back.  As if there is a shortage of pizza shops."}
{"text":"This place used to have very good food. We ordered a couple pizzas from here the other day and I must say it was probably the worst pizza I have ever eaten. When you picked up a piece it was as limp as a wet noodle. When you took your first bite all of the cheese and toppings slid right off. The buffalo chicken pizza only had about 10 pieces of chicken on the whole pizza. We will not be back."}
{"text":"This is an antiquated, small restaurant whose parking lot is badly in need of resurfacing, but one sets these factors aside when biting into the delicious pizza and calzones that I have enjoyed on countless occasions.  One cannot go wrong at Lucianos.  The restaurant regularly offers $20 gift certificates for $10 through DoubleTake Deals, which makes this the best buy in the region.  Be careful that you receive what you ordered: most recently, I asked for a greek pizza without olives: it was presented to me loaded with olives.  Mistakes have been made on occasion in the past as well. This is not a place I where I would want to dine in (if you have a large party, you are likely to be seated right in front of the pick-up and order counter, where these customers will hover over your table), but for take-out Italian food, it is tops!  Luciano's Bethel is a neighborhood gem!"}
{"text":"The meatballs are highly underrated and probably some of the best I've had. Pizza is good, prices are average, dining area is small so I would recommend take out."}
{"text":"honestly ive died and gone to heaven!  this pizza is on point to full fill  your every taste bud.  amazing pizza  amazing prices  i received minor attitude  when i came in to pick my pizza up one time  though, seemed busy i guess.  but 4 stars for this place!!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and subs. Can't go wrong. Decent delivery times too. You can get six packs as well. This is the only place o order pizza from, and I love pizza. Great local joint."}
{"text":"One of our favorite pizza places in the North Hills. Cooked perfectly, and ready in a reasonable amount of time every time! Take your pick from anything on the menu and no doubt it'll be good!"}
{"text":"The vegetable primavera is the best vege pizza i have ever eaten in my life, the italian hoagie us pretty decent too !! I will defintely be coming back !"}
{"text":"You know how it is when you throw up a little in your mouth? That's the flavor of the Chicago-style sauce at Luciano's.  The crust was full of flour and flat. I seriously couldn't choke down more than the fist bite. It was the worst pizza I have ever eaten. The price, however, is reasonable. ;) And,as mentioned in the name, you can get a six pack to go. Maybe you should just pick up a six pack, and skip the darn pizza."}
{"text":"I moved from NY so my bar is very high for pizzas. I have been somewhat disappointed in the pizzas that locals here think are OK. Someone said Luciano's is really good and guess what? They deliver!! We ordered a large cheese pie and medium pepperoni and an order of bread sticks. The cheese pie was so very cheesy and yummy- could have been done just a little bit more, the next time I'll order well done and it'll be perfect. Pepperoni was good - would have been better if we ordered NY style rather than traditional. This will be my go-to pizza joint for take out."}
{"text":"Great place to go in, have a few beers, eat pizza and watch the game with friends. I've done that many times here, and it never gets old. Pizza is very good and fresh. Service can be slow depending on how busy it is. Know the peak times (6-8pm) and you can't go wrong here. The pizza is some of the best in the area, which isn't saying much because Bethel has some pretty bad places. If pizza isn't your thing, they have other options which I never tried. I did try the wing dings, and I didn't care for those.  If you're looking for nice pizzeria in the area, look no further than Luciano's because it is probably the best in the area. They do need to hire more servers though when the dining room gets busy."}
{"text":"Hadn't been there if forever and I don't know why...the pizza was SO yummy!  Had the Italian Sub as well.  Oh my...DELICIOUS!  Will definitely go back to enjoy some more goodness!"}
{"text":"Pizza was excellent.  We ordered Traditional Crust Vegetable Primavera and Pepperoni and Bacon pizza.  The vegetables tasted so fresh that we were able to differentiate each one, each bite.  The crust was fabulous not to thick and not too thin. Best pizza I've eaten since being in the pittsburgh area. We will order again."}
{"text":"One of our favorite pizza places. The pizzas are incredible, wings are very meaty, spaghetti w/ meatballs is pretty good too, but you have to order the cheesy garlic bread!  No matter what I order, I always get the cheesy garlic bread.   I always do pick up instead of delivery. The staff is always friendly and treat you personable, not like a random anonymous customer. And .. You can get six packs here!  Beer and pizza, one stop shop ... what a great idea!"}
{"text":"Please pass up on the chain pizzas, spend two more bucks and come to Luciano's.  Best pie in Bethel Park.  Great tasty dough & and savory sauce.  Service is always quick."}
{"text":"Let me clarify the star rating. The rating is really only based on the pizza/food because customer service gets ZERO stars. Too bad Yelp doesn't have negative stars.   Absolutely miserable customer service here. We've been to Luciano's four times this summer. They have a pretty tasty pan pizza and good pizza in the North Hills is like finding a needle in haystack. Our third trip - the pizza was ready long before the 20 minutes we were told, so when we picked it up and got home (literally, a mile away) the pizza was COLD.  Tonight was probably the worst trip thus far. Here's the timeline: 7:00 - order pizza and wings. Told 25 minutes. 7:20 - arrive and pay for pizza. The pizza is done and sitting on top of the oven. Wings are not ready. 7:30 - I asked a man who I believe is the manager, how much longer our wings will be. They just went into the fryer - 3 more minutes. 7:35 - Wings are done.   I asked the 'manager' why my pizza was done long before the wings. It doesn't make sense that wings take longer than pizza. He mumbled something about the fryer sometimes backing up and walked away from me. HE TOTALLY BLEW ME OFF! Irate? Oh, yes.   So they hand me the pizza and wings, and the bottom of the pizza box is cold. I said, so when I get home and open this and the pizza is cold, can I come back and get my money back? They offered to reheat it in the oven - but as expected - re-heating it also dried out the crust and cheese.  Fail.   There was no apology. No empathy. Just plain terrible customer service. Is it really that hard to time cooking pizza and wings?!"}
