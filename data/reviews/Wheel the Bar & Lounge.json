{"text":"This place boasts they have \"the best fish in town\", but they should also include SMALLEST fish in town.  I ordered the fish sandwich and onion rings to go.  It cost $11 and some change. The portions, or lack there of were ridiculous.  Most places where you order a fish sandwich (I.e. Armstrongs, Beez, The Burgh) their portions are enough to feed trip people.  This piece of fish didn't even cover the crappy little hamburger bun they put it on!   To make matters worse, when I called the Wheel to inform them of this minuscule portion, the manager was completely rude and said 'if you expect more you have to order more.  A fish sandwich goes with one piece\"  I will NEVER order from there again.... and warning all of you!!"}
{"text":"This is where the guy's from work like to stop and have a few for happy hour.  This is one of the only bars in Bridgeville that allows smoking  They have reasonably priced drinks and have surprisingly good food. The fish sandwich is a monster."}
{"text":"Smokey dive bar with a couple dart boards and karaoke sometimes. Food is all deep fried, but decent. Service is good and the drinks are always cold."}
{"text":"I had heard they have good food and are famous for their fish sandwich. Maybe back in 2010 when Josh wrote his review. NOT anymore! Their fish sandwich was not only NOT a monster; it was a measly portion. In my opinion it was not even good! Next time I'm hungry for a good (actually great) fish sandwich I will go just a few minutes up the street to Bee'z Bistro & Pub!"}
{"text":"The first thing I noticed when I rolled on in here (get it? It's called the Wheel) was the divey feel and lack of exhaust fans that whisked the smoke from the bar area. Another thing I noticed were the shale workers wearing hats, polos, and tea shirts reading \"don't tread in me\". Oh lord I thought to myself, I've done and gone walked into a a teabag party bar.   As it turned out, to my surprise, they had a decent selection of IPAs. I listened to the tea party secret meeting and heard references to beck, Hannity, and Limbaugh, chuckled to myself, and went back to watching the Pirates game and chatted with friends. It won't be a regular stop for me, they did have food, although, pretty much everything is fried. I was there almost three hours and no one ordered food. Is that an omen? Finally one of the tea party members ordered wings, they looked good and saucy. He scarfed them down pretty quickly so I guess they were good.   Dive bar fans, rejoice, there is a dive bar in Bridgeville where you can get cheap beer and get caught up on your tea party gossip."}
