{"text":"Known the family for years!!!! Amazing Chinese!! You will love it no doubt. Huge portion size"}
{"text":"Other people in our party enjoyed their meals but it just wasnt for me. It seemed very sketchy to me and I only liked their wonton soup."}
{"text":"Ok.  First I have something good to say at the end so hang in there.  I've held off writing this thinking we must have been ordering the wrong items....and just hadn't gotten to the good stuff yet.  But tonight sealed the deal.  Worst food (see last comment) ever.  Tonight we thought besides won ton soup we'd get the Mu Shu Vegetables with two pancakes.  I love Asian pancakes and what can you do wrong to vegetables?  So the pancakes are just 2 flour tortillas!!  No kidding.  Flour tortillas.  And the vegetable dish was 7/8 onions.  I told my husband that as I opened it.  \"It's just onions!!!!\" He didn't believe me. ....I could tell.  But yup, he scooped some out and sure enough.  Onions.  I envisioned snow peas (there were about 8), bamboo shoots, broccoli, baby corn.  None of those.  Onions.  But why was I surprised?  Our first night we went there we ordered two dishes.  Kung Pao Chicken and Mongolian Beef (spicy).  Although it was an enormous amount of food (which was so sad given how awful the food was) the vegetable that was in each dish was almost entirely onions. ....and both dishes tasted nearly identical despite the different meats.  And to top if off they were absolutely not spicy and pretty bland tasting.   I thought it was an off-night (a woman I am acquainted with told me hands down best Chinese food in area) given the glowing recommendation I had of the place.   We've now ordered food 6 times and each and every time have wondered 'where is the good stuff?\"  I'm done.....except for the won ton soup.  It really is best I've ever had.....so why, oh, why can't the rest of the food be better???"}
{"text":"It's a small placed tucked away in Forest Hills, it's a Ma and Pa shop, the seating is limited, you can tell by the look that it was once a neighborhood bar. The wife is very sweet and so is the husband, the food is cooked as ordered so everything is fresh, HUGE PORTIONS and the wonton soup is to die for. Very hard to find good quality Chinese Food i for one don't care for the american version. I want the real deal i will give this place a five star, based off of the quality and that it is authentic."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices for excellent Chinese cuisine.  The family is friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Thee best chinese food in the area..cash only...small place/clean..but the best fresh cooked chinese food when you order. Same couple running it for many many years. Best shrimp egg rolls too."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what people are thinking when they say this place is good and deserves 5 stars, but AVOID IF AT ALL POSSIBLE.  The fried rice was greasy and had no vegetables or egg in it to start.  We ordered sweet & sour chicken.  It also came with no vegetables and the sauce was clearly watered down because it was so runny.  The egg rolls were not very good and the lo mein was off in terms of flavor and odor.  Overall, we spent $34 and it wasn't worth $4.  Never again."}
{"text":"The family ordered from Kar Hing this evening. 2 Shrimp Egg Rolls , Shrimp Fried Rice, Chicken /w Mixed Vegetables and Beef Lo Main.   I did not care of the egg rolls, I still believe that ChinaTown Inn in Downtown Pittsburgh makes the best egg rolls on the planet. I did enjoy the chicken w/ Vegetables. The brown sauce was. It over powering and I did like it. I usually order the white sauce and will the next we order.   The fried rice was good, I do like an egg in my fried rice. Everyone else enjoyed the beef. I don't care for beef dishes.   We will definitely order again and I do highly recommend!!  It is CASH ONLY! They do not have a menu online."}
{"text":"I rarely eat American Chinese food nowadays, but we happened to stumble upon this place after a jaunt in the area and seeing how long they've been around. The restaurant is run by a very nice Cantonese family, and indeed they say that the place has been open since 1979. The menu is very typical, though they do serve roast pork (cha shao / cha siu / ??), which is a Cantonese bbq meat and less often found in similar establishments. It wasn't served freshly roasted, since they don't have the facilities, but rather as part of a chow mein (??) noodle dish which turned out to be pretty tasty. The choice of vegetables and abundance of sauce showed the American influence fused with the Cantonese-style noodles, but it was fine overall. And the serving size was pretty huge as well, so it was definitely worth the price."}
{"text":"Really a great little place. Nothing fancy just great food , nice and a frendly family staff...  have ordered various thungs from sweet and sour chicken,  moo goo gai pan to walnut chicken.  Never disappointed."}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place. I love family hole in the wall places, and this one is a prime example.   Great food, well cooked, and served with a smile."}
{"text":"We've been going here since I've been born, about 30 years. The family running the restaurant are incredibly friendly and feel like family. We've been there many times for lunch, dinner, and sometimes as a reception for special occasions. The food is fantastic and pretty authentic. They have terrific tea, thin noodles for wanton soup (which isn't too normal for this area), and a pretty mouth watering menu. They have a bar, and a decent selection of domestic bottles. Prices are pretty decent and portions are big!"}
{"text":"I love this place...in my opinion of of those \"best kept secrets\" kind of places. Small, not fancy...but the food...never a disappointment, always excellent. Love it."}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was a kid and I love it. Best egg rolls, hot and sour soup and fried rice in the area. The egg rolls have so much more flavor than most places around here. The portions are large so you'll always be able to take home some leftovers."}
{"text":"I've lived nearby (Forest Hills) since 2000 and am just now trying Kar Hing. After numerous word of mouth prompts through the years, i tried it. The reviews are accurate. Delicious, authentic Chinese food. Friendly service. Family owned and operated. Very clean restaurant. And the fact that they grow their own vegetables in the yard next door boosts my review up to a 5. Its worth the trip no matter where you are."}
