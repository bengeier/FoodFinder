{"text":"Fish tacos are good most of the time.  My problem with this place is the crappy attitude of the little manager.  He's just a rude person and has been on several different occasions.  With that said, I've moved on."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a couple of times. This is definitely a higher priced restaurant but the food is a step above traditional mexican restaurants. The menu offers salmon Mexican style and other interesting combinations. You get a lot of food on your plate and the tastes are interesting. Their sangria and margaritas are fresh and cold. The chips and salsa are warm and yummy.  We will be back again!"}
{"text":"I have visited this location 3 times and each visit I had a good experience.    I ordered a combo two every visit, seems to be the best value ($8.50).  You choose two items from a list of about 7 selections including burritos, hard or soft tacos, enchiladas, chimichangas, tamals, or tostadas and it is served with rice and beans.    Overall the quality may be one notch higher than your standard mexican restaurant that many of us have grown accustomed to in the south. You are also paying a little more for this great location.  If there is anything that stands out to me about this place it has to be their shredded beef that you can get stuffed in just about anything on the menu.  It's delicious!  I have not visited their other location so I cannot compare the two."}
{"text":"The service here is so, so bad. We went last night with a small group of friends (we had 5 people). We were seated right away as the restaurant was only half full when we got there at 6 pm. We ordered a round of drinks first, which took 20 minutes to get. Our food took over an hour and came out cold. No apologies from the wait staff at all. I've eaten here several times for lunch and the service is typically slow but not this bad. There are so many other better Mexican restaurants in down where dinner doesn't take 2 hours."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience ever. My friend chose this restaurant for her birthday which happens to be Cinco de Mayo so naturally we expected a wait. When we put our name on the list we were given an expected wait time of 45 minutes for a party of 6. Nearly 2 hours later we were finally seated. We placed our orders and when the food came out everyone's came except mine. The waitress seemed confused about what happened to my order and said she would be right back. She came back about 5 minutes later saying my food would be up soon. 15 minutes later after everyone else has finished she comes back saying it will be 2 more minutes at which point I explain that I am no longer willing to pay for it. She sends her manager back who seemed annoyed that I was unwilling to pay. Long story long, after being there nearly 3 hours I never received any food nor an apology. I will not frequent this establishment again."}
{"text":"I have recently moved much closer to 1900 and find myself here about once a week. I have really enjoying it lately. Their veggie burrito is superior to the local competition, the fact that they use lard-free re-fried beans is awesome! The complimentary salsa is okay, but has a hint of canned tomato to it that prevents it from being great.  They have a very nice selection of mixed drinks that are very tasty. On of my extremely picky friends tried their jalapeno margarita on my suggestion and was ecstatic about it.  The place has a nice wide open dining area with plenty of seating and nice cultural decoration. Good for everything from a family dinner, to a business meeting, to a date. The bar is kinda of small compared to the dinning area, but I have always been able to get a seat there. I'm really glad I started trying this place out more often."}
{"text":"Always love this place for the great food and service. This our favorite 1900 location. Fresh guacamole is made at the table. The restaurant is clean with a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"I am not going to rave about 1900 as far as the food goes but I still like going there and I'm not sure why. Maybe the service and atmosphere  make up for the less than stellar food. Don't get me wrong, the food is not bad, it's just not great. I love fajitas so I usually end up ordering those and next time, I am going to have to tell our server to please ask that the onions and peppers not be overcook as they have been recently. I also wish that the refried beans were not so skimpy b/c I love refried beans but I guess I could always order a side of those. So all in all, I would recommend 1900 and I don't think you will be disappointed, you just won't be blown away!"}
{"text":"They recently completely overhauled their menu and it feels like a very different choice of dishes. The favorite Pollo con Crema is gone, and so are a few other solid dishes. I had tacos lengua - they were alright but not especially flavorful and lengua wasn't very tender. With a smaller menu, there is definitely much more emphasis on drinks/margaritas, which I find on an overpriced side.  Overall, a cute place to get together with a few friends for appetizers and laughs, but I wouldn't do dinner."}
{"text":"I work nearby and come here often.  Most of the time I get friendly, quick service. However, there are some days when service is slow for lunch even without many other diners there.  Food never disappoints though!"}
{"text":"Good place for tex mex. went here for a team dinner and it was 12 of us on a Saturday. Yes one of the working Saturdays it was. They accommodated us, no problem. Guess they weren't very busy. Started off with the house chips and salsa. Oh boy the salsa had a kick!! Guac is a must and was made well. Queso was a hit too. The food was decent, can't complain. Good option if you are in the mood for Mexican."}
{"text":"The drinks are good, hence the 2 stars... but the food quality has gone way down in recent years. I had the arroz con pollo and it was ground chicken (tasted like out of the can) mixed with greasy cheese and Mexican rice with undercooked onions and peppers. I doubt that anyone who has ever ordered that dish has actually liked it..."}
{"text":"Food was absolutely horrible - the worst meal of any kind my husband and I have ever eaten.  A frozen dinner is better."}
{"text":"The best Mexican I've found in Charlotte. I find most east cost Mexican food to be very bland (says the girl raised near the Mexican border), so I was very pleased to discover 1900 Mexican grill and it's very flavorful food.  I typically avoid any house Margarita since most places use mixes with artificial ingredients, but decided why not try, and was very pleasantly surprised at the freshness.  I visit 1900 every time I am in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I am in love with the steak quesadillas here! They have a lot of great lunch specials that you can choose from. Their chimichanga is also delicious. The service here is always fast and the staff is friendly. Definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"We popped over to our new walking-distance Mexican food place this weekend, and were very pleasantly surprised. The food was very good; rather authentic (this coming from a San Diego native) and delicious.  But the big surprise was the drinks. They were really, really top notch. SO excited to have this place across the street!"}
{"text":"Having visited a few times, we've found the food to be consistently good, consisting of decidedly fresh ingredients served in big portions. On each visit, the waitstaff has been attentive and quick to fill water and tea glasses, as well as offering the next beer or margarita.  Speaking of drinks, I had the best big ginger (whiskey, ginger ale) I've had in Charlotte, despite it being a decidedly odd drink order for a Mexican cantina.  I should say, we find the ambiance to be a large part of the charm. When you look up, you'll notice high ceilings and a wall of elaborate, colorful Mexican wrestler masks. The theme is continued on the small LCD television screens that adorn some booth walls, where a crazy, strange zombie/vampire/dwarf/Mexican wrestler movie shows on a loop. We found the latter immensely entertaining, but can't say with certainty that they show anything other than the movie on these TVs. Sports fans, you may want to call ahead if you're wanting to catch the big game."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years, and I have gotten the same thing every time....great service and great food. Try the burger, and have someone to share it with."}
{"text":"We headed here for our date night after a suggestion from a friend. It was very casual and had good (nothing over the top) mexican food. I had the chicken taco salad and the hubs got the fish tacos. We also got table side guac which was really yummy.   The overall experience was great; wonderful and friendly wait staff plus the usual mexican food choices. I will say it's super kid friendly, so if you want a little peace and quiet, come after the early dinner rush. It's also nice they have a patio to sit outside."}
{"text":"Celebrated a graduation dinner here and was very pleased. After making the reservations for 19 people, I then went on Yelp and read reviews. I was nervous b/c many reviews weren't that great. I went through with the reservation and had a great experience! The food was good and the service was even better. This is my first ever Yelp review and I'm glad it's a good one that  is much deserved. Oh and the quac & the jalepeno margaritas were outstanding!"}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful experience! My friends and I had dinner here for the first time tonight. Our waiter was David (we made sure to ask his name before we left), and he was more than amazing! He was so polite, sweet, and provided us with one of the most satisfying dine-in experiences I have ever had. The food was delicious, but David's excellent customer service is really what left a big impression on me. I will be sure to request him every time I come in! Wonderful food, clean restaurant, and outstanding customer service. I will be sure to refer my friends, and I can't wait to come back again. Thanks again, David!"}
{"text":"So so food but the service was terrible.  Our server got our orders wrong but i was unable to even tell her about it as once the food was delivered she never returned to our table until she presented our check.   It was not like the restaurant was terribly busy as i dont think she even had more than a table or two that i could see.    Finally when we were ready to leave she brought our bill.  I was never asked how our meal was or had my drink refilled.  When i asked her about it she said they were short help and they had a new girl .  For the first time that i can remember I left no tip.  I read several other reviews from their patrons and the common theme is poor service.  Wake up management and owner or look for another career and a going out of business sign.  If this is typical i would recommend you go elsewhere!    We will likely not return."}
{"text":"I went to 1900 Mexican last night.  I have been there several times and keep going back.  The staff are very nice.  There are lots of items on the menu and the food comes out piping hot in a very short amount of time.  I noticed last night that they had kicked up the lighting a bit which helps with the darkly printed menus.  :)  Great neighborhood place!"}
{"text":"The best cheese dip in town! I love this place!  MY husband and I go all the time.  Everything is good, but great chicken taco salad and fajitas! Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican Restaurant in Charlotte by far. Good prices, great service.  Fast and every dish has been great. Arroz con pollo is my favorite.  The chimichangas are wonderful."}
{"text":"Decent and plentiful entrees. Made at table guacamole. Nice ambiance, attentive wait staff. Only criticism- They need to print new menus, the ones they are using are worn out!"}
{"text":"This place has excellent food and drinks. The carnitas tacos are crispy and tasty. My favorite thing about this place is the tequila selection and mixed drinks. The bar staff is very knowledgeable and willing to teach you about tequila and mezcal."}
{"text":"Go here if only for the margaritas, no where else in town comes close. The Margarita de la Casa is AMAZING. They also have a great mole sauce, if that's your thing (it's mine, but I know you either love mole or hate it)."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the area. Service is great and friendly. Taco alambre is where it's at.... and the guac. And the cheese dip. And the churros"}
{"text":"The best carne asada!  My husband ordered it the last time we were here and I was so jealous of his entree we had to come back so I could get my own. Comes with amazing poblano mashed potatoes and a delicious chimichurri.  Not only will we be back, but this might become a take-out staple!"}
{"text":"I went here several times when I lived in Charlotte, and it's legit.  Likes:  Never crowded, even though it's street parking it's convenient, large portions for a reasonable price.  I've gotten the carne asada dinner several times, and it's pretty awesome.  Huge portion, tasty, and I always got at least one more meal out of it by throwing the leftovers into a tortilla at home.  They also give you more than one type of salsa with your chips, I love that for a change.  I'm a fan of the outdoor seating.  Dislikes:  Definitely tastes like \"Americanized\" Mexican food, though they still do a good job at that.  I went on a Sunday night once and got the margaritas on special, but the marg mix was fluorescent in color and pretty terrible (I cant judge the normal margaritas, since I never wanted to try them again).    Take it or leave it:  Take it.  I like this place.  It's a little Americanized, but so are most places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Didn't feel like going out, and just received a to-go order via delivery service. My 3-taco meal contained only two tacos. The rice was cold, the tacos tepid at best. Very disappointing. Surely mine was one of the first orders of the day?! I hope that I didn't get last night's leftovers. Look elsewhere. There are at least half-a-dozen mom and pop taquerias on South Blvd who do much much better for less. I won't make this mistake again."}
{"text":"Please invest in hair nets there was hair in two seperate dishes. When the server was told about the hair she laughed before offering to get my friend more food. Servers were rudely talking about my table right behind us. Takes way too long to get VERY simple orders."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving two stars instead of one is that my husband ate at their and said his was good.  I, however, was unable to eat my Togo order. The food was cold and the carnitas meat was so crispy I couldn't bite through it.  I reached out to management and we were offered a $20 gift card to come again. I declined it since we are from out of state and we're here while our child was in the hospital.  Lesson learned? Eat at the hospital.  It is fresher and much tastier."}
{"text":"Love this spot.I think it is a combo of the food, (both portion and quality,) the prices and the service. I will clarify that the service I have received at the bar far exceeds the service when in the dining area. My experience in the dining area has been spotty, but not enough to deter me from going here.  Nice outdoor seating on a large sidewalk when the weather is right.  They make a mean Michelada-- which is almost impossible to find in Charlotte!   My favorite menu items are the sopa de lima and the ceviche. The bowl of soup is HUGE- easily 2 servings . Everything my friends and I have ordered there is great!  The portions are plentiful, you will most certainly have leftovers for lunch!"}
{"text":"I like this place! The staff is nice, the facility is clean and the food is authentic. It is not just gloopy 'mexican' food on the plate, there is presentation and some good composition dishes, not just taco, burrito, enchilada combinations. The restrooms are spotless and the bartender is knowledgeable. The only reason they get 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have not eaten enough dishes (i'm hooked on the chimichangas) to give the 5th star. Now they serve aguas frescas & have daily drink specials. Would recommend you to try them out!"}
{"text":"Bad experience! For a friday night it was very slow for 830pm. It was so hot i could barely stand it! Service was not great! I ordered fajitas which were not what i expected. I have had fajitas at lots of places, and i am also a server. First, the fajitas were not served on a hot plate, the  like it was boiled! The set up plate was sour cream, lettuce, a dab of pico, and the worst rice i have ever had!!!  Bland !! And this dish was $14. Needless to say i will never go back."}
{"text":"A-Ok is the best way to describe 1900. Nothing fancy, but ok level Mexican food.  1900 is tucked way in a small shopping center near a Harris Teeter and one of the many gyms I go to, 9 Round. Temptation after sweating is a killer combo.  I have been here numerous times and love their tableside guac. They also have really good drink specials. My most recent trip, I ordered to go chicken fajitas. (Note: They tried to charge me for chips and salsa. When I questioned it, he said they do have a smaller portion of chips and salsa for free. Just a warning if you get to go food. I thought the smaller size was just fine, portion wise.) I do think it's weird that they don't serve the fajitas on a sizzling plate, like most places. I also thought the price was a bit steep for chicken fajitas....though, i noticed shrimp and steak were the same price, so next time, shrimp it is! The chicken was well cooked and tasted delish. The refined beans were pretty good too. I did think the to go portion for the rice and beans was suuuuper small, especially after seeing the portion of those that ordered in around me.   Overall, decent Mexican food, great location, and service was fine."}
{"text":"Probaly in my Top 3 mexican spots in Charlotte. Chicken Fajitas SOO GOOD and they make the guac tableside. Atmosphere is nice again like I said. Solid Mexican. worth a spin!!"}
{"text":"My favorite traditional Mexican restaurant in Charlotte.  Generous portions, consistent quality.  Try the classic chicken quesadilla.  Best quesadilla in town, in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken fajitas and they were absolutely terrific! I might say the best fajitas I have ever had. The chips were hot and had a great flavor and the salsa superb! The food gets 5 stars!  Why do I only give it 4 stars? I had to wait at least 10 minutes to get another beer... the waitress should never let your beer run out.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I happened to eat here twice in two days.  The lunch menu is 5 stars!  For an app, we ordered guacamole, which they make in front of you at your table (I always love that).  It was one of the best guacamoles I've ever had!   I got huevros rancheros and it was so good.  I cleared my plate!!    The dinner menu wasn't as good  IMO, but it still offered a good selection of items I would order.  I wound up getting the veggie burrito.  It was ok - there wasn't any beans in it which I was kind of surpised about.  Usually veggie burritos = black bean burritos in my experience.  My margarita wasn't the best by any means.  I think I'll have the fajitas if I come back for dinner."}
{"text":"Its been a while yelp!  Back from my trip in Charlotte and this place deserves my first review.  I was fortunate enough to catch a few of the World Cup 2014 games here.  Great vibe, food, and drinks all around.  I was seated at the bar with a couple of my buddies and the bartender took care of us with quickness and efficiency.  Making sure our food orders came out on time, and that we always had chips and salsa.  I am from the Bay Area, so I have pretty high standard of what Mexican food should taste like, aside from having real Mexican food in Mexico.  Drinks were decently price, not too expensive.  I tried my first \"flight of tequila\" and with it he made his own special sangria mix as a chaser.  I thought that was pretty cool.  Didn't catch his name, but my friends and I thought he was a cool dude.  Non-locals try the Hop Drop n Roll IPA if they have it."}
{"text":"Excellent knowledgeable service!  Great house margarita.  I had the Mole poblano and it was excellent.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times using CitiPass book coupons that's I've hoarded. But trust me, when they run out, I'm still coming back! My boyfriend and I are big Mexican food fans (thought not picky about authenticity per say) and we are VERY pleased with 1900!  The chips and salsa are my favorite in town! The salsa isn't chunky, which I actually prefer and it's just the right about of heat. My bf doesn't approve of the salsa, but definitely agrees the chips are legit.  I'm also in love with the refried beans here. I could just eat a plateful of these and be happy!   1900 has a decent selection of vegetarian options, but they could definitely add more to get more stars from from me. Even so, they are great about adapting their other menu options to become veggie-friendly... like substituting beans or grilled veggies instead of chicken or beef.  My favorite part of menu is the CREATE A COMBO on the back. I usually avoid these sections at most Mexican restaurants, but 1900 is a little swankier so I gave it a go....I was not disappointed!!  You can choose between burritos, chimichangas, enchiladas, hard tacos, soft taco, tamals, or tostadas.  One item is $7.50, two items are $8.50 and three items are $9.50. Since all of these come with a heaping pile of rice and beans... this is an excellent deal!  My favorite by far is the CHIMICHANGA! Holy moly these things are amazing! Especially since they let me substitute the meat for those glorious refried beans.  My boyfriend loves the soft tacos here. He's so happy that they come with 2 tortillas to make them extra durable and hearty. He tried the chicken, beef, and pork until he settled on the pork being his favorite and that's all he orders now.  On a final note, I really enjoy the atmosphere at 1900. It's not your typical kitschy Mexican decor, but has enough flare with aztec art and prayer candles that it's got a definite style. The restaurant is neutral enough so that you can dress super casual in yoga pants and a tee or dress up classy with a cocktail dress and heels."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today, told waitress we had only one hour to get back to hospital. Only 3 other tables with people. After 3 baskets of chips and 26 min later we asked for the food to go. The waitress actually rolled her eyes and said \"it hasnt been that long\". She brought 4 separate checks, took our money, then brought all the food thrown together in the same box! For 4 separate people!   We have eaten here regularly over the past year, even had very large groups for lunch with no problems. WILL NOT GO BACK.  There are many, many other places in Charlotte that will happily take your hard earned money and can easily provide a better dining experience."}
{"text":"WE FINALLY FOUND GREAT MEXICAN IN CHARLOTTE and we haven't wavered since!   Both my boyfriend and I LOVE good Mexican food! We have tried lots of different places in Charlotte but didn't find anything particularly good until we tried 1900.  It's reasonably priced for such great quality! We love their Queso & Fajitas! Definitely a must-try in the Charlotte area---where good mexican is hard to come by!  We've gone so much that the people that work there know us when we walk in or even when we call to place our pick-up order. It's a fun, local, unpretentious, delicious spot!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night with a party of twelve for a birthday celebration. I have been here once before, probably about two years ago so I was excited to try it out again.  Overall, I just wasn't really impressed. The chips were meh and salsa with just ok. Sangria was on special, I believe $6. It was just ok again. I got the enchiladas verde for my entree. I'm not sure what it was, but the verde sauce was not my style. And I don't really call myself a picky about food. Rice and black beans were standard, no wow factor. Great portion size though.   Our server was great. She tried her best with our large party. Staff did refill our chips and waters regulatory. Maybe I'll try again... in a while..."}
{"text":"Not my favorite by far.  I've eaten inside once and had delivery through a local service.   My friend and I first had a late Saturday lunch weeks back when weather still couldn't decide if it was was winter or spring.  For an appetizer we ordered the table side guacamole... the large portion.  Our server arrived at our table with a cart containing all the ingredients (even a convenient tip jar prominently in front) and two, yes, two small avocados.  When I asked if this was the large portion, she merely nodded as if she didn't understand or didn't know.  $9.95 for this in which we were finished in moments each having about 5 scoops.  You would expect guacamole to be served with chips.  While we were presented with an initial serving and salsa, we were out of chips in no time having none for our remaining salsa.  We did finally get some more but no salsa making them kinda pointless after just moments.  When we did ask for more while waiting for our meal, they kindly obliged not bothering to note only the first two orders were complimentary tacking around $3 to the check without note.  I did complain to the manager noting we never got but one initial serving of salsa and had to use the first serving of chips for our meager guacamole appetizer.  He did offer to remove the charge taking our word as to the situation.  I only wish there was an El Chico or Don Pablo's in the area as I've never been disappointed with those experiences."}
{"text":"We have been here a handful of times, and every time we come we always have a horrible experience. The owner yelled at us for ordering more chips for our queso dip, we sat for 20 minuets waiting to be addressed, never got refills, never talked to after our food was delivered. It's just endless negative visits. The only reason we come back is for the food, but this will be the last time. I had to get my food to go because it took forever to be brought to the table, and it was cold too."}
{"text":"Terrible service and flavorless food.  Worst Mexican any of us have ever eaten.  Don't waste your time.  We'll never be back."}
{"text":"Food is Great! More expensive than your typical Mexican restaurant.  Service is horrible.  Expect to have to flag someone down for anything.  This is also when the restaurant only has 2 or 3 other tables."}
{"text":"We LOVED this!  The house margaritas are just right and very consistant. The guac is made in front of you, at least at the bar, with all fresh ingredients and it was perfect! Chille Rejenos are the way you expect them to be; real poblano chillis are roasted first, then stuffed, lightly battered and fried. Yum.  The Carnitas were wonderful chunks of pork that had been flash fried so crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. There were only 3 good-sized chunks which I thought was too little at first, but plenty in the end. We may have found  our \"go-to\" for Mexican close by."}
{"text":"This place has a nice view of the city on Elizabeth Street but it's customer service and food quality kill it. We where greated by our server and did not see her till the end of our meal. The salsa taste store bought and the tortilla that came on my buritto was cold and hard. It tasted microwaved. I ordered a carne asada buritto but it came with little steak and a lot of sour cream. The customer service is horrible. They forgot we where here. We had to ask to have our waters refilled after 20 minutes of waiting. We asked another server to get us some water. They filled our glasses half way. Wont be my first choice for Mexican Food in the city. I would rather eat Taco Bell than this place."}
{"text":"Excellent service, amazingly good food, very fair prices, massive portion sizes They also do table side guac Everything was excellent and I will be returning shortly and often"}
{"text":"Since moving back to Charlotte, my husband and I have been trying to fine \"our\" Mexican restaurant. I think we found it today!    As expected, a basket of tortilla chips were placed on our table on arrival.  What I didn't expect was an amazingly fresh, flavorful chip.  I asked our waiter if they were made in the restaurant and he confirmed that they do fry them on-site. What a difference it makes!  The salsa was perfectly balanced combo of tomato, cilantro, and heat. Yum!!!  We tried the queso dip and it was super creamy and delicious.  And to my surprise we were given individual dipping bowls.  I can't remember another restaurant ever doing this.  Impressive!  For my entree, I ordered the \"gringo combo\" of a hard shell beef taco and a chicken enchilada with rice.  (Beans are standard, but I standardly refuse them. My husband ate his and he thought they were good.) Our food came out piping hot and tasted excellent!  Our server was polite and attentive.  The rest decor was bright and fun. The restaurant was given a score by the Health Department of 97%, so I assume the kitchen was as clean as the dining room.  Overall I was very impressed and plan to return make this place regularly."}
{"text":"1900 Mexican Grill offers great traditional Mexican foods.  The location on Elizabeth Ave managed (thankfully!) to survive the year-plus-long trolley rail road construction (for the non-existent trolley!).  The dining room area is beautiful, with high ceilings, nicely themed decor, and great lighting.  It feels like a higher-class Mexican restaurant, but still with very reasonable regular-restaurant pricing.    We went early on a Friday night and were immediately seated (without a reservation).  The later it got, the more the dining room filled up, so we were glad we went earlier with our party of six.    The free chips and salsa served seem fresher and more homemade than some Mexican restaurants.  You're given a sampler of regular salsa, hot salsa, and corn salsa.     In the past, I've ordered the enchiladas, a giant-sized smothered burrito, or one of dishes with mole sauce.  I opted for something different this time around:  Tacos de Carne Asada.  It was three doubled moist corn tortillas with carne asada with rice and homemade hot sauce on the side.  They're supposed to resemble Mexican street cart style tacos.  I think it's one of my new favorites.  I'm not a big fan of corn tortillas (I prefer flour), but the flavor of the meat offset my aversion to the corn tortillas, and the double layering of the tortillas helped hold together corn tortillas that normally fall apart.  The hot sauce was very flavorful, chunky, and OH-SO-HOT.  Don't get me wrong, I love spicy foods, but this even pushed my limits.  That's when I ordered some water on the side of my Diet Coke.  Yum, though!   I normally don't care for the semi-bland Mexican rice (unless I dump the leftover salsa on it), but the mildness of the rice helped cool down the tacos in this case!  If not for gorging myself with the chips, this would have been the perfect-sized entree to fill me up, but not make me feel too full (mostly because there were no beans,  cheese, or other heavy foods).    Our server was right on top of things, too, so we had a fantastic experience.    p.s. They have a huge tequila menu, too, for you tequila connoisseurs!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Their sangria is the only place I will order it. (Red) I have had taco salad, tacos and fajitas here. All great flavors and my husband gets the enchilada mole and it's so yum!! Always great service !"}
{"text":"The food was bland, all of it. I had to add salt. Over priced and not worth a second visit for sure."}
{"text":"The shredded chicken is horrible. Arrow Con Pollo is disgusting. The put cheap, poorly cooked rice on the plate, topped with frozen cheap shredded chicken, and shredded american cheese on top. A meal at taco bell would've been cheaper and better.   My boyfriend got the chimichangas. They were made with the same shredded chicken, but it was more edible because you could just eat the fried dough with the melted cheese, which tasted better than the shredded cheese on the ACP.   Just don't go. Penn Station is next door. Go there instead."}
{"text":"1900 Mexican Grill is a cool, little tucked-away Mexican restaurant off Park Rd (near Fairview).  The inside is themed and decorated very well in bright colors.  I recommend the booths!  They provide a private, intimate experience.  They also have outdoor seating on their patio in the courtyard, which is nice to enjoy during the warmer months (but not too warm -- unless you're sitting in a pitcher of margarita!).    The chips and salsa they serve are average, but a little on the hotter side than some places.  My favorite dish is the Chicken Mole.  Yum.  I love a good mole sauce and 1900 Mexican Grill does a great job.    We've always been able to get seated right away, too, no matter what night we've gone on.  Give 'em a try!"}
{"text":"I am here once a week. This place is awesome. I love the cheese queso and the cafne asada."}
{"text":"I'll never go back. Before I start in on how horrible the food was, let me say this...the wait staff was great. They were friendly and very professional.   Now...the food and drink....  I paid $8 for \"lime green colored water\" with salt around the rim, that they called a margarita...go figure. I had the bean soup for the appetizer, which really wasn't bad. It was made up of pinto beans, some sort of shredded pork and loads of cilantro but still edible.  I ordered the Margarita Ribeye, medium well, and they brought  out a Top Sirloin, well done. Top Sirloin can't even be eaten well done. Oh and they served Cactus salad with it. UUUUGGGGHHHHH...... Anyway,  I was going to \"play\" with it and pay for it.  One of my  friends who I went with told the waiter that I didn't like it and he brought out  Fried Chicken Salad...she was eating that.  It was equally as bad. The lettuce was brown and wilted.  Is it possible to have two bad dishes in one evening?"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant with good authentic food. Ordered the house margarita with fish tacos. The plates were huge with 3 fried tacos, rice and refried beans. Did arrive fairly quickly.  The fish was fried and battered nicely. Service was nice. Pretty nice dinner for a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Two friends whom I hadn't seen in awhile and I decided to have a girls' night dinner.  We arrived and were seated quickly.  The hostess was very polite and our server was wonderful throughout the evening.  I was happy to find that they had some local craft beers on tap, so I ordered a new one I had never had... it was great!  Shout out to the NoDa Cavu blonde ale!  They each had very tasty margaritas (lucky me, I got to sip).  The complimentary salsa was very good - not too spicy, but with a kick.  The chips were brought to the table warm, just the way I like. We ordered the tableside-made guacamole... holy moly it was delicious!  She made sure were were good with all the ingredients as well as how spicy we wanted it. We were slow about ordering entrees just because we were having so much fun catching up.  Our server occasionally checked in to make sure we were good, but we never felt pressured or rushed by her to go ahead and order.   When we did, I got the Fish Tacos and requested for them to be grilled rather than battered and fried.  I love when that is possible, because it means they aren't just pulling pre-breaded fish out of a bag.  And to me it tastes so much better!  Inside the 3 flour tortilla tacos was the grilled fish piled high with slaw, pico de gallo, and valentina aioli.  They were fantastic and perfectly balanced with the sides of Mexican rice and refried beans.   I was absolutely stuffed after two tacos, so I got to enjoy the 3rd along with some leftover rice and beans the next day for lunch.  I will definitely be returning when I'm in Charlotte again."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican in Charlotte. Both locations are good, but this particular one is my favorite. Whether I'm looking for an inexpensive date night (combo 3 with 3 chimichangas and the AMAZING queso sauce is plenty big enough to share) or a good spot to check out with friends, this is the perfect pick."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever,Cheese dip is awesome,great food drinks ect,love it ,,,,i can eat this everyday,my daughter can live on this ,very authentic"}
{"text":"I stopped in for lunch a little after noon, so the place still wasn't too crowed yet. The staff was wonderful, chips and salsa arrived the moment I sat down. The chips were okay, but I wasn't a big fan of the salsa.   After a quick review of the menu, I was very impressed with the selection of lunch combos! You can pretty much mix and match whatever you want. Tacos, enchiladas, chimichangas and more...and it's all for a very reasonable prices.   I went with Amy C's suggestion and got the chimichangas. One beef and one chicken, the combo comes with rice and beans.   My food arrived quickly. The chimichangas are pretty small but I did love how they were coated in the cheese sauce. First thing I notice is that they didn't skimp on the filling, both of my chimichangas were packed with well flavored meat. Overall, it was very tasty. The rice and beans (covered in cheese) were just a little blah, but overall it still makes for a good meal.   Next trip...I will be having some table side guacamole because it looked delicious and of course I have to try the cheese dip!"}
{"text":"I've only been to 1900 a couple times but was pleased each visit! They don't seem to be too terribly busy during lunch but the restaurant is very spacious. Our service was impeccable and the food was pretty tasty. I didn't notice anything too spectacular about this Mexican restaurant but I don't have any complaints either. The location is very close to uptown and I imagine stopping in for lunch would be quick."}
{"text":"Met a friend at 1900 for dinner tonight. The pico was delish but otherwise my tostada was nothing out of the ordinary. The prices seemed a bit high for your average Mexican restaurant but I would probably give it another try!"}
{"text":"This place is still just \"okay\" in my book.   I met some girlfriends here on a rainy afternoon. I decided to go with the lunch special chimichangas. You get two chimis with your choice of chicken or beef and your standard sides of rice and beans.   It's not that this food is bad by any means; it's just all very average to me. However, the portion sizes here are good and the food arrived hot.   So if you want to get rid of that Mexican craving this place will hit the spot."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of 1900.  The place is clean and pretty swanky for a cheap Mexican restaurant.  They have good drinks and I would hope so since they claim to be a Tequila Bar.  The margaritas I've had were good, albeit expensive.  We were there last Saturday night and they had $10 AYCD sangria.  I was so pumped when she said that.  It was Saturday too, get outta here!!  I walked out with a nice little buzz, so I'm happy to report that the sangria wasn't all mixer.  The chips and salsa are some of the best I've had in Charlotte.  They have quite a kick, so I think they might add jalapenos...a good thing.  I've had better queso, but I still swiped every last bite of cheese out of the bowl.  As for the meal, I split a 3 entree combo with my girlfriend.  It was $9.50 for a burrito, chimichanga, and a tamal.  The chimichangas here are great, crispy and topped with queso.  Burrito and tamal had good consistency, but lacked spice.  It's ok though, I threw on some Cholula and it was perfect.  We were stuffed for spending only $14 on food between 2 people.  I'm sure all those sangria refills helped as well!"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Waiter was busy serving owner or manager and her friends. It wasn't even busy. The chips taste like recycled corona boxes. The order for my husband was wrong/ missing item that he added and paid extra for. My food was boring and the black beans were cold. We will never go back and waste our money. Avoid disappointment and skip this joint!"}
{"text":"1900 is an acceptable place to grab a bite to eat. I would put it on par with your average chain style Mexican but with a much better atmosphere inside. The decor is colorful and the ceilings high. It is a very high energy environment and all of the staff is very helpful.  The food itself ain't bad. We got guacamole and cheese dip to start. Both were pretty solid. I got the fish tacos for my entree. They weren't bad-- though I have had better.   I might come here again next time I am in the area. Maybe the next menu item I try will wow me. Comparable to On the Border."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte. The food is wonderful and extremely well priced! I've never had a bad meal at this restaurant."}
{"text":"We had a great experience. The food was amazing! We had plantains (off the chain), black bean torta, and the wedge salad. Amazing food and great staff."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon, not busy at all. Service was great, the food was pretty good! We had both the fish tacos and the chicken tacos. Better than other Mexican places in the same price range! The Fried Ice Cream has patron XO drizzled on top... It was delicious, and was big enough to easily split between 4 people. I would recommend to it to others!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little addition to Elizabeth. The food was good and decently priced. I had a 3way combo and there was plenty on the plate for 10 bucks. The location, and the view was very inviting. If you sit on the patio you can feel like you're really part of the neighborhood. I will be going back soon."}
{"text":"Warning - don't come on a busy weekday if you are in a hurry.  We came in right at noon and were seated immediately.  The server brought our drinks, chips and salsa pretty quickly.  Good start.    However, after we placed our orders, we waited and waited and waited... 40 minutes later, and still no entrees in sight! Jeez, this is standard Tex-Mex fare, not a 7 course gourmet meal people!   So, when we finally got our food, we had less than 15 minutes to scarf down our food, pay our bill and get back to our meeting down the street.    Not exactly an enjoyable lunch - we had to gobble our food down so quickly, I can't remember if I even enjoyed it."}
{"text":"Attentive and very friendly service. Best combo fajitas I have had in years. Nice decor and atmosphere. We will be back. Best Mexican food in the area. Great location with plenty of free parking in back too."}
{"text":"No wonder my drink took long!!! Best bar tender ever#neveragain I was just staring at her waiting to see when she could get up to get my drink like wow r u serious girl !!! I should have gotten up and made the drink myself LOL"}
{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that the food was good.  Nice portions and tasty.   We went on a Monday night so there wasn't a crowd, but the service seemed to be somewhat slow. Our server was friendly, but it took a little while to get someone to come over after being seated. My fiancé had been here a couple times and really enjoyed it. The server recommended a new lager and an IPA. I ordered the lager.  He came back a little while later to inform me they were out of that specific beer. Fine. I noticed the dos Equis signs hanging and asked for that lager. Also out. I said ok, I'll just have a corona. After a bit, the server informed me that they no longer carry corona, nor dos Equis, and haven't for a year. He then recommended a Pacifico to which I agreed. No beers were listed on the menu only the tequilas, which is great, but it's Monday and I was not in a tequila mood. All of this could have been avoided if the beers were listed on the menu. Don't hang signs of beers you don't carry. Maybe its just me, but I like the Mexican-American beers when I have Mexican food.  Finally my bill showed I was charged for the lager that wasn't available. Something seemed off, but because the food was decent we may be back."}
{"text":"When my roommate and I walked into 1900 Mexican, I remember being taken aback by the chic design (especially the chandeliers, OMG I covet the chandeliers) and thinking that I hoped the food and the service were as excellent as the decor because if they were then this was going to be a 5 star experience.  If wishes were fishes we'd all eat well. As it was, we ate passably.  Like many mexican restaurants they started us off with chips and salsa, which came in two forms, standard red and corn. I hoped the latter would wow me, but it was pretty bland. But, hey, it was free.  The drinks, on the other hand, were most certainly not at $9 a piece. I know better than to order anything containing the ingredient \"margarita mix\" but i let the spirit get the best of me and ended up with a overly sweet cherry drink that may once have made the brief acquaintance of some tequila.  For our entrees, I ordered the Enchiladas Verde and he got the Fajitas de Casa. To their credit, both were so generously portioned that we ended up unable to finish. The chicken in the enchiladas was tasty, but the sauce was bland, especially when I spread the allotment of sour cream over them before realizing it was far too much (and I rarely admit such a situation exists). He enjoyed the mix of proteins in the fajitas but I tried one of the shrimp and found it unpleasant, so the seasoning is for some but not all palettes. Overall, the food wasn't bad, but it was also unremarkable.  The service did meet the standard I had originally expected, with both servers that came to our table being prompt and friendly.  I really did want to be able to write a glowing review of 1900 Mexican, but as it turned out, I won't claim to never be returning, but next time I plan on dropping decent money on Mexican, I am likely to try somewhere else."}
{"text":"I think this is the best Mexican restaurant in Charlotte. I like their lunch special for chicken fajitas. Chips and salsa are pretty solid. Also a great environment. I moved here from San Diego and it's been hard to find good Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place is great.  It's beautifully decorated and has a light and airy feel due to the ample natural light from the windows.  I have to note than I hail from Texas, and I didn't think the chips and salsa were quite as exciting as other reviewers have mentioned... That, however, didn't stop me from eating a good basket or two while I waited for my entrée. (I'm a sucker for these types of starters at any restaurant!) :P  I had the Combo Two with a shredded beef chimichanga (at the recommendation of fellow Yelpers) and a chicken enchilada.The pico de gallo is a must-request with the combo dishes.  It was fresh and delicious and probably my favorite part of the meal! Again, I wasn't blown away by the chimichanga despite the rave reviews, but I enjoyed it along with the enchilada and found the meal to be quite satisfying overall.  As a whole package (ambiance+food+service), the experience was great and I would definitely go back. I have my eye on the carnitas for next time."}
{"text":"Amazing hole in the wall Mexican place. I highly recommend this spot, but don't expect their other location in Elizabeth to be nearly as good. The husband and wife personally run this place and I've always had an outstanding experience. This place is definitely one of Charlotte's hidden gems."}
{"text":"I had a late lunch at this fantastic restaurant. The service was fast and the food was wonderful. They have a great selection of import beers which included my favorite, Dos Equis Amber. My server was in good spirits and polite. Her name is Ingrid..ask for her if you happen by. I will definitely be a regular."}
{"text":"Went for dinner and were two of three diners.  Still, drinks took 10 min. Waitress said she got busy with something else. The food was mediocre. Save your money and go to Chipotle."}
{"text":"Love their food and prices. I frequently order the three chimichanga combo to go on my way home from work. Great deal!"}
{"text":"Great experience, walked in close to last call for the kitchen.  There was no eye-rollling and staff was very accommodating, did not rush us one bit.    The guacamole is made in front of you, a staple for any Mexican restaurant that wants to be a player in the game!  Also, the pancho villa candle is a nice touch, a slight minus was the waiter could not tell me who Pancho villa was. All good. #IGoogledIt  I ordered the mole shredded chicken plate and subbed the rice for more vegetables, no problem. #Paleo  Nice place, will go back."}
{"text":"Great salsa and chips . The spicy is one . So maybe get the original one.   Good selection of tacos, burritos, enchiladas. Good selection of margaritas and beer. Call for a reservation on weekends ...place gets packed.   Bound to have a fun time!    \"¡Arriba, arriba! ¡Ándale, ándale!"}
{"text":"Good to great food nice place but the music was Rap do you know what it's like trying to eat a good meal with that crap playing way to loud.   The music just stopped the waitress is awol so visit is going downhill.   Need the check and s box then we can get out of here  Might not come back"}
{"text":"Quick and attentive service. Tableside Guacamole is yummy although my daughter thought it tasted too citrusy.  Good portions for lunch."}
{"text":"Heard good things about the Park Rd location, so decided to try the one in Elizabeth since I wasn't in the mood for Viva Chicken (how is that possible?!) and already in the area. Chose the Pick One Burrito Gringo Combo on the dinner menu. My burrito was very plain inside and about 3 inches long. The refried beans were definitely out of a can as well. For some reason, the salsa tasted strongly of cocktail sauce as well...  I think Taco Bell would have been a tastier choice... now that's saying a lot."}
{"text":"I always forget about this place, but it is one of the better Mexican restaurants in all of Charlotte and the prices are extremely reasonable.  Usually go to 3 Amigos, but this place has been consistently beating it in quality, price, and taste.  Their queso actually has some substance to it (3 amigos tends to be watery).  I usually get the grilled chicken salad and the chicken is very tender and fresh.  Great fresh avocado and the dressing is tasty too.  I wish they gave a little more salsa with their to-go order, but I'll bet they would do it if I asked."}
{"text":"Below average food, a dirty, sticky, smelly environment, and a series of rigid (and unposted) menu restrictions all add up to our first no star dining experience in years.  The server was nice, so we'll give it a star."}
{"text":"First trip to 1900 Mexican Grill - loved it.  Service was very attentive, food was great, and the Obama Margarita was super.  Started off with tableside guacamole; we got the smaller size ($7) and it was plenty for two.  Burrito combination plate was very good, and the carnitas were excellent.  Very large chunks of pork compared to other places, and the meat was super tender.  Some of the better corn tortillas I've had also - they were thinner and didn't taste dough-ey.  Not sure if that is a word...you know what I mean.  They have over 50 different kinds of tequila, and offer flights so you can taste three different kinds if you like.  Flights are $16.  Great atmosphere, friendly, and very clean.  I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite Mexican restaurant in Charlotte for several years now. Guacamole and queso dip are both incredible. Fajitas and arroz con pollo are also among my favorites. The service is incredible, everyone is so friendly and remembers you when you come in regularly."}
{"text":"This was my second time at 1900 Mexican Grill. The first time was during a job interview so I was much more nervous about the day rather than what I was eating. Now that I'm not feeling that sort of pressure, I can report a more accurate experience.   The service is good, the atmosphere seems lively, and the restaurant is busy (at least when I was there both times). However, the quality of the food is less than great. I ordered the veggie fajitas and while the sour cream, guacamole, and salsa added some flavor to the tortilla, the veggies seemed over cooked (a bit on the mushy side) and lacked seasoning. Beans and rice accompanied the fajitas, but also were lacking a distinct flavor.   I can't remember if the dinner menu is the same as the lunch menu. This previous experience was during lunch and the veggie fajitas were $7. The portion seemed to be a good size and for a light lunch, I could have shared. Other items on the menu were around the same price. My husband ordered a salad and it seemed just his portion size.   I was disappointed in the quality of the food and I do not plan on returning. I remember I had similar thoughts my first time around; I guess even under a lot of pressure, like a job interview, the quality of food is still on my radar!"}
{"text":"Sticking with Vida.  1900 Cantina ambience is comfortable & attempts to be higher end Azteca.  Portions were huge, they couldn't figure out how to change the syrup for the soda.  Menu offerings are what you would expect for any Mexican joint.  Service was non existent & was overall disappointed esp when it is situated in the company of Carpe Diem & Custom Shop expected more from what could be a gem."}
{"text":"The two lessons here are 1)listen to your wife and 2) trust your initial gut instincts. My wife said she had not heard anything positive about this place but I wanted to give it a try to support a neighborhood business. We should have known better seeing the menus as soon as were seated. They were totally trashed, peeling plastic on the edges and parts unreadable. The service was very slow despite only five tables being occupied at 6 on Thursday night. It is honestly no better than Taco Bell. Average food at best. The $11 house margarita was right out of a mix and pretty flavorless. Bland salsa. Fajitas served on plates---barely warm. To top it off, next door is a bike store, which is very nice and a great addition to the neighborhood, but the outside patio of the bike shop had a bunch of PBR swilling, unemployed BMX / skateboarders who looked to be in their early to mid 20s. Smoking, climbing trees in front of the restaurant, dodging traffic and the streetcar on bikes and skateboards.... Made for a great spring evening with my family on the patio next door. I should have listened to my wife and gone to RURU but I wanted to support a local business in Elizabeth. I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt but I should have trusted my instincts---why wasn't a place with a killer patio not totally packed on a spring 70 degree Thursday evening? Clearly, the crowds read the bad reviews and stayed away. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Here for dinner on a Saturday Night  From the outside it was just another building but as you walk in it was dark and filled with Mexican design and decor. Head straight back and you can see the bar and the TV on with the latest sports game.  There were 2 cases of Lucha Libre Wrestling Masks hung up high on the left wall as you walk into the restaurant. Cool Mexican decorations all around the restaurant.  Really enjoyed the Margarita straight up. Festive Mexican music were playing.  The guacamole is creamy, smooth and addicting after one bite.  Arroz con Pollo was tasty with shredded chicken sprinkled on top of rice with onions. Side of black beans was tasty.  My friend ordered the Grilled Quesadilla and wanted shrimp added on. Nice portion which you had enough food to share with another person.  Will be back for drinks and dessert."}
{"text":"TEQUILA TUESDAY. All pitchers are half price and if you aren't sharing drinks a margarita is $3 or $4. I split the house margarita pitcher for only $14! I loved the table salsa it had a slight kick and was very fresh. I do have the agree the spinach in the spinach Queso was less than fresh- but not so off putting that we didn't finish the dish or maybe i was just hungry. I ordered the Carnitas. The meat was juicy, grilled perfection. The sides are typical- just a tiny scoop of guacamole was offered. Overall- everything is pretty solid here- medium priced- nothing ridiculous like Vida in the EpiCentre but not Central Ave cheap either. However, $14 margarita pitcher earns this place an extra star- but I guess just on Tuesdays!"}
{"text":"This place really doesn't get enough credit.  Great drinks, excellent food, and a big patio!  I've only eaten outside but it was wonderful.  We brought our dog and the waitress was really sweet about it.    Every single thing we got was good.  Mojito, Hibicus Margarita, Chicken Fajitas, Al Pastor and the Enchilades de Mole.    We were all pleasantly surprised and made note to come back here soon."}
{"text":"This is not your moms Mexican restaurant. This is the real deal and it's fantastic. Great service. Wonderful atmosphere. Outstanding food. We will be back, without a doubt. It's 6:20 on a Saturday and is already very busy, so be warned. The carnitas were to die for and the carne asada was the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I usually meet a girlfriend for lunch at 1900 about once a month.  A regular meal that includes cheese dip is required to keep me running.  Located in the Park Selwyn Shopping Center, this place is always hopping during lunch time.  I order the same thing every time cheese dip ($4.50) followed by the lunch special of beef chimichangas ($6.50) served with rice/beans and some sour cream (mmmmm dairy).  The chips served at the beginning of the meal are always hot and fresh, served with a salsa that is a little too heavy on the cilantro for me (I am not a fan of cilantro), but request some of the corn salsa - it is YUM - fresh tasting and a great start to your meal.  The cheese dip is a little thinner than at most Mexican restaurants, but it thickens as it sits and is delicious - very creamy with a slight kick to it, but nothing that will light your tongue on fire.  You get 2 small chimichangas with your lunch meal that are fried, but not to a fast-food heavy crunch, these are lightly fried, so slightly crispy without being rock hard.  They are covered in a cheese sauce and served with refried beans and Spanish rice.  I clean my plate every time - delicious!  There are TV's around the bar area, which are usually playing soccer or ESPN when we go.  Comfortable seating in booths or at tables.  Service is fast and friendly and the food has been consistently good."}
{"text":"The low carb margarita is so awesome. It's unfortunate that it's $10, but it's worth it.   The customer service is very good. Guacamole ($5.50) and queso with chorizo ($6.50) are good, not the best but worth it."}
{"text":"Meh. Really. The food is okay (at best), the prices are on the higher side and the service is not what you would expect for a restaurant in this area. I've been here a few times and typically order vegetarian entrees (enchiladas, quasedillas, salads). My husband tends to order beef or pork dishes. Each time we've come we've had leftovers that go bad in the fridge because we're just not interested in them. That is a really bad sign in our house. The last time we came here the service was mediocre. The wait staff was nice (when we saw them), but I basically had to shout someone down for water after getting zero refills in the 15 minutes my glass was empty and sitting at the end of the table. It really wasn't that busy, so I wonder if they are just that under-staffed. I don't think I'll eat here again, but I may come for a drink with friends. The bar and outdoor patio are the best parts of the restaurant."}
{"text":"We sat outside by water fountains and the view was lovely. Server was friendly and attentive. Water was refilled often. Chips and salsa were good. Fresh cilantro in the salsa was a plus. Good portions and chicken was flavorful. Plenty of parking and convenient location."}
{"text":"This is a nice little Mexican place-  the food is good and pretty authentic.  I really like the chili rellenos, and the make your own combination platters.  The staff is friendly and the portions are huge.  There is a mariachi band on Friday nights that is great but they are REALLY loud, so don't go on Friday's for a quiet evening out."}
{"text":"In my opinion, in the top 5 best Mexican food in Charlotte, I really, really enjoyed this place. Service was good, food was awesome. Music was a little strange."}
{"text":"Nothing special here other than the location. We were headed to a show at the Visualite up the street. This is your same old Mexican food joint with a large tall open dining room. I had the steak tacos and my friend had the enchiladas - both tasted good, not great, we left a little on our plate. We did have the 1/2 price pitchers of sangria - again, good, not great.   I was just as ready to leave as I was to arrive. Will I go back...only if I am around the area with no other options - too many other places to try!"}
{"text":"After moving here from Austin Texas I'm not sure anywhere can really compare but I had a good experience here! I had the jalapeño watermelon margarita and it was delicious! I ordered the black bean torta and it was HUGE I couldn't finish it all even though I wanted to! The service was a little bit slow, but we also did have a large group!"}
{"text":"The service here is a crying shame.  The food isn't bad at all but the service is so bad you feel like you are being wilfully ignored.   I have walked out before my drink order for the 2nd and final time never to return.   No wonder it is always dead in the place."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. I got the salmon and it was chewy and the sauce was so overpowering. Grilled vegetables were pretty good. We sat at our table for about 30 minutes after we were already being rushed several times to pay be the waiter.  Then as we were walking out the hostess said \"finally\" in Spanish as we walked out. Such a rude staff. Definitely won't be going back to this place."}
{"text":"Not good....best Mexican in Charlotte???Not in the top 20 in Charlotte! Stale chips,salsa is tomato plus tomato and the fajitas are like you would get in the frozen section at Harris Teeter!!!! Really disappointed!!!!!"}
{"text":"We have eaten at 1900 several times. The service is always stellar. The consistency and quality of their food is what brings us back. The problem that I see is food temperature. We have sent entrees back because they were just warm. Tonight our waitress brought our plates to the table using the OVEN MITTS; telling us the plates were very hot. I could pick up the plates with my hands! The food temperature was palatable. There is no reason why these plates (food) do not arrive at the table absolutely steaming hot! We will be back but if my food comes out any temperature below 140...it's going back!"}
{"text":"I never like to write a bad review....but if I experience bad service for the money that I have spent with you, then you're gonna get it.  Only 4-6 people were actually inside dining- I stood at the bar for nearly 5 minutes to pick up food before receiving the first 'hello.'  Food wasn't that bad, actually even better the next day as left-overs  But for the $$$ spent, I'll stick with my other favorites...will give it another shot someday when its nice outside and I can take advantage of their outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Think I've found a New Mexican spot to hit up for Cinco de Mayo. The food was great. Went on a Monday so there wasn't a crowd and it really is in the cut so maybe that's why. I'm pretty sure the locals frequent here. Prices were good too and the food was so flavorful. I ordered the Chicken flauta and it was different than what I'm used to. They came small like egg rolls, about 8-10 of them. I just wish they use a better grade of lettuce. I mean who still eats Iceberg"}
{"text":"Great location. Trendy, casual setting. Customer service was very good. Food was quite typical for price. I would return, but don't let the decor create a false impression or heightened expectations."}
{"text":"Food was your a little above average, my wife and I enjoyed our dinner.  The location is very cool, great for a quick meal before heading downtown.  The setting is great!  Very roomy and cozy!  I am not sure what is up with the Mexican wrestling masks on the wall.  LoL, the place is big enough to put a ring in the center and have some authentic Mexican WWF wrestling!!!!  Booya, bring it!"}
{"text":"THE HOUSE MARGARITA!!!!  Ok just had to get that off my chest because a big pet peeve of mine is house drinks that suck, but when they are actually GOOD, my day is made!  Came here for a weekday dinner and chat with a friend.  Typical cute Mexican ambience going, friendly staff(for the most part) and the chips were fresh... Be warned the salsa is spicy... But I like spice so it worked for me.  I wasn't super hungry so at first I was going to order a taco salad which wasn't too big but then i say they had BEEF TONGUE tacos and of course I had to go there (I immediately was transported back to Mexico in 2003 that time I took a road trip from Cabo to La Paz and stopped at a few,what some might call, sketchy places for a quick bite and each place had their versions of tacos with all the little nasty unrecognizable bits of the animal but taste absolutely AMAZING) So yes, I went for the beef tongue!  I was a little disappointed that you are not allowed to mix and match tacos or order single tacos... I like options, but whatever. The tacos were ok... Not exactly as life changing as I remember but tasty.  The salsa served with the tacos however was something special... It had fresh ground chilies and everything!  The pinto bean purée that also came with the dish was also tasty.  I sampled my friend's carnitas and it was delicious and I now understand why she doesn't order anything else.  Overall the food was pretty good.  Our server was a little odd but he also seemed pretty young.... He seemed to want to rush us out toward the end of the meal but I will chalk that up to a one off.. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Cinco de Mayo, and my friends and I were searching for ways  to some how be involved in the festivities. We went with the obvious choice, eating Mexican. I suggested going to Aztec ( A splendid restaurant on Woodlawn) but this place was closer. Are arrival was during lunch and it wasn't extremely busy. We sat down and got our menus, right away we noticed the Guac was $7. We did not place an order,since I believe there can't possibly exist such an impressive costly Guac. The plain cheese dip was $6. Maybe they obtain their cheese from 100% grass fed, non GMO Mexican cows? I overlooked the pricing and thought maybe I'm being cheap. So I ordered the chicken fajitas, which where a reasonable price. Once I received my food there was barely any chicken on my plate. For a moment I questioned whether I had ordered vegetarian fajitas? The food was standard, nothing special about it.About 10  minutes go by and my friends and I are conversing/eating. The waitress stops by and questioned us about our method of payment. We were distinctly not even half way done with our food.  We did not want to be rude so we answered. In the next five minutes she came back and handed us our checks. We were not done with our food. We felt rushed and I was particularly irritated. We payed and left. Abbreviation: The food is average, the service is okay."}
{"text":"I love 1900. The service is always spot on, your drinks and chips stay full, the inside is super cute and there's plenty of parking across the street. The food here is great. I normally get the mole enchiladas because I'm a sucker for a great mole sauce and this one is outstanding. I haven't had anything on the menu that I haven't liked (the pastor tacos are to die for, by the way). The portions are pretty large, too, and it's reasonably priced.  Plus, they have a great beer selection."}
{"text":"1900 Mexican Grill has mediocre food at gourmet food prices. The only great thing about this place is the location!"}
{"text":"The cheese dip was too thin and the salsa was without much flavor.  The service was good but the food was just okay."}
{"text":"Friendly service, but food was just average. Everything was just a little bland. We had mole, tacos and enchiladas - we all thought the same thing. I like the spot, but wish they would put more effort into the dishes."}
{"text":"For some reason, my family likes this place. I'm not such a fan. This is a very mediocre Mexican restaurant. There are much better options in the area. I find the food to be flavorless, American versions of Mexican dishes. For example, the fajitas are served on a plate, not a skillet. Everything just seems watered-down and lackluster."}
{"text":"Met a couple of friends for dinner prior to the Todd Snider/Kevin Gordon show at the Visulite Theatre.  Apparently our friends had quick service from the minute they arrived, but once we arrived, it took forever in between visits.  We realized next time we ordered a drink, we should order two at the same time.  Horrible.  And we ended up being late for the show.  The food was okay.  I much prefer Don Pedro or Azteca, though, especially for the price and service.  Oh, and watch out ordering the Low-Carb Margarita.  The prices aren't listed on the menu and we were stunned when we got the bill and they were $10 each (served in a lo-ball glass!)  Luckily I only had one to try as my friend was enjoying her 3rd, only to wish she hadn't either.  She wasn't feeling any effects, so they made them pretty weak, too.  On top of that, we thought we were getting a great deal with $3 drafts, but they were short-poured and served in very thick glasses.  Deceiving.  Ahh well.  Live and learn.  The show was great, though and the drinks at the Visulite more than made up for this unfortunate experience."}
{"text":"Yummy good Tex Mex.  The lime salad dressing is delightful."}
{"text":"We decided to give a chance with our Groupon. Hardly deserves 2 stars. Bad service! Ok food. Never again!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food. This place is a gem in South Park park road area. Chips are amazing.  Place is clean and love the decor. Margaritas are on point. My favorite is the carne asada tacos. Not too expensive and great place for kids."}
{"text":"Have been there several times and never have been disappointed. The food is very good. Simple, good Mexican food! Very clean restaurant located in a great spot. Tons of parking out back (if you don't get a street spot), beer and drinks are VERY good. This is NOT a \"dive\" Mexican restaurant that you see in every other plaza. This is a great place. Went for my birthday with 7-8 other people and it was great! Rarely crowded and the bartenders are very friendly and professional! Also it is located in an awesome part of town on Elizabeth!"}
{"text":"Update (that was fast) Spoke to the manager. He was very nice and apologetic and took care of biz as best he could. Hopefully, this doesn't happen again. I'll delete the below once the fod redeems itself   I had to find my Yelp PW to make this review. I ordered nachos & requested CHIPS ON SIDE due to time and soggy factors. Picked up, no chips on side. Ok, I'm starving but Idw to be totally disappointed so I go back in, the bartender rudely asked if I \"actually asked for chips on the side.\" Duh, check YOUR system. She passes it off to a server & doesn't talk to me again until 10 min later when my new order comes out. Her attitude was trash & Idk if they took it personal that MY food was wrong or what, but they put EVERYTHING in separate containers and left out my beans-the reason I wanted nachos itfp! Seriously?! It's not the 1st time and it sucks that Idw go back because 1900 used to be my spot! But seriously, SIX separate cups!? Y'all were being smart @$$#$ because nobody said separate everything and I was overly polite to them as if I'D messed up my own order or smtg. Do better."}
{"text":"First off, I'm a lover of all Mexican food!  I could literally eat it everyday.  I could also eat chips and salsa everyday, unfortunately for my backside lol.    I like this place- it's a bit more \"fancy\" for a cheaper Mexican spot.  It's a cute date spot.  Cozy booths so you can talk to your dinnermate in peace.    We had table side guacamole.  It was great!!!  We asked for it extra spicy, and she even brought us an extra huge side of slice jalepenos to get it to the heat we were wanting.  The ambiance here is great.  If you want big portions- stick to my spot Three Amigos on Central.  I got the mixed grill fajitas.  The shrimp were tiny compared to Three Amigos and the portion in general of fajitas was half the size.  Ulimited chips and salsa were delish!  I'd go back, but may try something besides the fajitas."}
{"text":"What a terrible experience. Waited 30 minutes and food never came. We were treated like idiots. Wife and I are older and I think they didn't care for our age.  They said one group ate all the food so there was a delay. Huh?"}
{"text":"Review for Cinco De Mayo festivities at 1900.   There were a gaggle of people when I rolled up. Got lucky..and found parking right away. Big ol' tent on the lawn with satellite bar. Beer pong table busy. Two cornhole games set up. Sizeable stage with band in the back. Throngs of people with beers in hand just chilling. Inside, tons of people hanging around the bar, tables filled. Took a while for the bartender to get to us, but she was quick getting my gigantic can of Tecate.   Festivity-wise, could've been more festive. Band kind of sucked. Still, it was fun to just hang out with peeps on a lawn with large beer in hand.   Perhaps I will visit this place for a normal meal one of these days."}
{"text":"Lunch on a cold rainy day....For starters we had the cheese dip which was delicious, but  how can you really mess up cheese and chips.  A little guacamole, some salsa verde(by request only).  My girl had the salsa verde enchiladas, which she loved and i tried the homemade black bean burger. Which was served on a  soft hot huge bun, topped with this black bean spread, guacamole mayo.   Surprisingly good.   We usually eat Loco Lime, but thought we would try something different.  Yes i recommend this place ...Oh yeah, the Margaritas are Incredible! -aNDy"}
{"text":"A Step Above Regular Mexican!!!!  Both in Cost and in Quality.  My wife and I ate here for Dinner.  We both really enjoyed our meals.    My tacos were really good (can't remember the name of then). They tasted fresh and they were not greasy.  Truly better than most other Mexican restaurants.  My wife's enchiladas with Mole sauce were closer to what you expect from a Mexican place (meat and cheese in tortillas covered in sauce) but even they seemed a bit better than expected.  Expect to pay more than other Mexican restaurants.  All plates are over 10 bucks."}
{"text":"We love this place. Our daughter absolutely loves this place.  Every time we ask we should we go to dinner she votes 1900. The food is awesome the service is always good and the prices are what you should expect. We love the queso and their margaritas.  They are always friendly and just a great family restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is overpriced cheap Mexican food. It's not terrible , but it certainly isn't good. The portions are large, and there's a nice patio."}
{"text":"Their spinach dip is my absolute favorite! Love the service and the arroz con pollo. Great place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Not a fan.  Couple reasons why, one the food is mediocre at best.  It's certainly no better than your run of the mill Azteca, Monterrey, etc.  Keeping that in mind, my second reason for not being a fan is that I find that the dishes here are priced a little on the high side for a standard Mexican restaurant.  I like the decor of this location a little better than the Park Road location but that didn't make up for the lack luster food and the barely acceptable service provided.  If I'm looking for a quick Mexi-fix, Loco Lime or Azteca is still my go to choice!"}
{"text":"My classmates and I go here because we go to cpcc and its walking distance from our classes! They are always friendly and they have great drink specials! We always have quick service, it's a little on the expensive side for the food but it is pretty decent food!"}
{"text":"Came here one afternoon with my mom and sister it wasn't what I expected at all food was horrible service from the manger was horrible as well my mom had to take her food back 3 times"}
{"text":"Decent Mexican American food. It's not disappointing but I go to pacos tacos instead. The service is pretty decent as well. It's a great lunch spot if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Decent Mexican place in a great location along the future streetcar line. Food was adequate, margaritas better than average. There are better places in Charlotte for Mexican, though."}
{"text":"On the suggestion of a friend who thinks this is close to authentic Mexican, we went on a Sunday evening. The service was slow that evening and had some communication problems. We ordered their fresh guacamole which was very good...enough for 2-3 people. We ordered a classic margarita (special $3) and ordered a no-carb margarita. Very dissappointed with the no-carb and then shocked that it was $11! Total rip off. We ordered 4 entrees, steak faijtas and 3 burritos dishes. The entrees were just ok. Burritos had a lot of rice and beans...maybe too much. Some of the  meat was a little dry. Nothing on this visit would compel me to return."}
{"text":"Warning: food is served utterly flavorless.  I eat Mexican food 2 out of 5 meals, and I've never had more bland tacos in all my years. There was undoubtedly no flavor in that ground beef.   In fact, this is the second time we've been here, the first I ordered fajitas, cheap chicken chunks. It was lukewarm, and not served on a sizzling plate as in traditional fajitas. I wouldn't be surprised if they microwaved it because it was a lackluster  I ordered fries on the side with my tacos and rice; it was to substitute the \"bean paste\", that will be $1.50 extra, which means the beans are so cheap they're nearly free. Honestly, the fries were seasoned, and that was the best item I ate. Now only if I were in an all-American pub, then it'd be worth the visit, but let's not forget this is a Mexican restaurant and an attempt at being authentic, but it horribly failed.   The conclusion is: go here if you want cheap substance to throw down, and not flavor or quality to enjoy."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Charlotte and def my favorite in this area. I love their ground beef Chimichangas.  Smoothed in queso the well seasoned beef is wrapped in a crispy fried shell.   Their salsa and chips are great and they will keep them coming if you'd like. There burrito is good as well. Smoothed in red sauce and topped with cheese."}
{"text":"If you like carnitas or carne asada, I would check this place out.  I've been here a couple of times now and I just love this place.  Their chips and salsa are pretty great, but their guacamole is amazing.  We haven't done the table-side yet (even the small appetizer you can get made at the table looks too big for 2 people to eat), but the small side order is the perfect size.  The first time I came, I had a combo plate with a chimichanga and a tamal.  The tamal was just all right, but it did have a fair amount of filling compared to some of the others.  The chimichanga, however, was fabulous.  I loved the flavors in the filling and it was the perfect size.  My partner ordered the carnitas, which were perfectly moist and flavorful.  Last time we came, I ordered the carnitas tacos, which came with their own smoky sauce, which added some great flavor to the tacos.  My partner ordered the carne asada, which he declared to be the best he'd ever had.  I loved the spices on it as well.  Like many Mexican restaurants here, they have a large selection of tequilas for tequila tastings or for your margaritas.   The dining room is fairly sizable and they have a few tables available out on the patio.  I have never been here when it is completely full, but I can only imagine how loud that is.  It was a little over half full on our last trip, and I could barely converse across the table.  We also had a table right in front of the bar, which added even more noise.  I swear they have one of the loudest blenders I have ever heard in my life.  The acoustics in this place are quite lacking.  Service has been pretty good both times and the prices are pretty reasonable.  They have good food for a good price, but beware of the noise level if you go at a busy time or get seated near the bar."}
{"text":"I was hoping this was going to be the Mexican place I have been looking for.  Good food, good atmosphere at a good price.  It was not.  Listing my points,  I had the enchiladas verdes.  My wife had pick 2 chimichanga and enchilada.   1. Table side Guac was good, could have used a bit more salt, but overall no complaints 2. Chips and salsa were ok, salsa was a little weak 3. Both of our main dishes were just bland.  No real flavor, nothing really fresh about it.  It came with your typical rice and beans, but no pico, no lettuce, no Guac.  4. The Enchiladas Verdes has very little sauce.  5. Lots of kids, seemed to be a very kid friendly spot 6. Service was fine. 7. 2 stars and here is why.  If you had told me that my meal was a $6 deal from some hole in the wall, then sure, you get what you pay for, But average price for meals ranges between $8-$11 and at the price, it just seem like it should have been better."}
{"text":"I am big fan of this place for lunch. Seems to be a good value for price.  I went for the \"Gringo\" combo.  You can pick 1, 2 , or 3 items and it includes rice and beans.  The pick 2 is under 10 bucks.  The beef chimichanga has a crisp tortilla and top it with creamy queao. They do not skimp on the queso either. Had a some excess to dip my tortilla chips in. They just give you half of the chimichanga if you get another item to pair with it.  As you can see in the photo i paired with a taco.    Service here has always been good and they always send me on my way with tea to go. We visited on a Monday and it was not crowded but they were very efficient and fast. While i am sure i could find less expensive Mexican this place is nearby and come in clutch for lunch.  In case you are wondering i had leftovers it was so much food.  My only suggestion would be to use white cheese instead of the yellow on the tacos. Just a personal preference."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I consider myself a Mexican Food Aficionado. I've lived in Mexico City and other Mexican States that are known for their regional cuisine.  With that said, let me speak on what I ordered:  Fresh Quacamole Queso con Chorizo  House margaritas (Okay, I ordered a Pitcher-- Don't JUDGE ME!   Beef fajita with tortillas de maiz, cause a REAL MEXICAN, will only eat maiz...  The fresh quacamole was prepared table side. Nice touch! It was fresh, not overly dressed with lime.  RECOMMENDED  The queso was the highlight of the meal. When a Tapa outshines the main course... You know it's gonna be GREAT.  I was not disappointed.  And now the Fajitas.... Great caramelization, great flavor and well balanced with onions, green peppers and charred jalapeños. Again, it's a MEXICAN thing...   MY ONLY COMPLAINT... The tortillas should have been warmed on a comal, instead of being steamed...  WOULD DEFINITELY EAT HERE AGAIN... This time to sample the Mole!   Hope this review helps..."}
{"text":"I heard a few people rave about this place and finally checked it out. The deocr is interesting with huge chandeliers. They were playing Reggae music the night I was in so that was a little odd.  The menu is short compared to other Mexican restaurants. The complimentary chips and salsa didn't arrive until after I had ordered so not sure if that's a regular practice or not. Most other Mexican places, they are there as soon as you sit down. The chips were decent but the salsa had an odd flavor to it that I couldn't pinpoint what it was.  For an entree I ordered the Enchiladas de Mole.  The highlight here was the mole which was amazing. Everything else was meh on this plate.  The enchiladas were like a folded tortilla, not rolled. The beans were nothing special and the rice was the worst thing of all with absolutely no flavor. I had to mix in the mole and beans to give it something.  Service was average and nothing really stood out.  So for Mole, I'd give them a 4 which allows this review to average out to a 3. Worth trying but not sure I'll be back since there are plenty of other Mexican places around."}
{"text":"Great food and very good atmosphere! Mexican wrestling movies and luchador masks on the walls! One of my fave restaurants in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I went to eat here with some old coworkers for lunch & came away pretty happy with the whole experience. 1900 Mexican is tucked away in a nice shopping center off Park Road so it's a little tough to spot unless you know about it.  The place was pretty packed for lunch, but we didn't have to wait at all for a table of 7. The inside seems very cluttered though, with lots of tables & booths very close together. Maybe this is one of the ways they seat the lunch crowd so quickly. They also have a nice patio area that seemed pretty popular when we rolled up. Other than the cluttered feeling, the atmosphere is typical of most Mexican restaurants, from the decor on the walls to the spicy colors throughout the place. They also have some good tvs throughout the place so catching a mid day sporting event during your meal is quite easy.  The food was nothing too special & the lunch menu prices were right around the average for similar Mexican places. I had the burrito & taco combination lunch & can't complain. You won't get as big a portion as some of the other Mexican joints, but you still get quite a good amount of food for the price. And everyone at the table seemed to enjoy their meal, so I'd say that the food is quite good, but nothing special.  While 1900 Mexican isn't anything special, it does serve good food for a good price just like your similar Mexican restaurants. I'd definitely agree that there are better Mexican places in Charlotte to eat at, but this is a good choice if you want Mexican & you're close by."}
{"text":"Have been here three times.  Once with wife and 2 kids, and twice with work buddies.  All 3 times the food was excellent, the service was top notch, and the atmosphere was fine. Visit 1: The Camarones Special recommended by the server was incredible.  It was Friday so they had cheap Dos XX Lager deal going.  Wife's meal was a quesadilla that was huge and delicious.   Visit 2: Got the Carne Asada Tacos, also chosen by same server.  She has great taste.  These were incredible.  More Dos XX Lager.  Buddy got Chicken enchiladas and said the \"best he ever had.\" Visit 3: Acalpulco(?) Fish Tacos.  Not bad.  Huge meal and I was starving so that worked out.  It was a different server so I went out on my own.  Shows what I know.  Still a great time and I do not regret my choice.  Look forward to trying more from 1900.  Did try the guac, which was pretty good.  I will be disappointed when my work in Charlotte is over.  This place is great.  The missing star?  Their salsa is average at best.  The corn relish is great, but salsa needs improvement."}
{"text":"We came in for a late lunch around 2:15 pm and were the only guest in the restaurant. The older female server was very inattentive and the order took far to long to come out. The plates were hot from sitting under the warmer while the server sat in the restaurant floor reading a book. Neither dish was properly prepared and the Carnitas were burnt. When alerted of the issue, the server grunted and walked away without and word or apology about the  problem. This is the third and last chance this place gets to fail for me."}
{"text":"Our favorite restaurant in town. By far. We have tried all the other Mexican joints in town, recently tried chuys. It was a relief to get back to our home spot. Always beyond amazing customer service and the food never disappoints. Been coming here for years after be referred by some friends. Our absolute favorite dish is steak tacos funditos. It literally doesn't get better. Anywhere. Hopefully will be back next week?! :)"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Menu is varied, but not overwhelming.  There's a kids' menu.  Drinks are great. Hostesses are always friendly and our waiters/waitresses have always been friendly, attentive and knowledgeable. They take their time with their customers.  Food has always been good or great with every visit and reservations are welcome. Restaurant is only noisy when there's a loud party. Of course we'll be back!  Very kid and group-friendly."}
{"text":"Very standard Mexican food. Nothing to write home about. The margaritas were awful and the service was awful. They acted like I was asking for their firstborn child when I asked for a second cup of salsa. The servings were large which was nice but otherwise just go to chipotle."}
{"text":"Amazing margaritas and food!! Love this place!! Great customer service and the bartender is great!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were driving around last night and trying to decide where to eat when we came upon 1900 Mexican Grill. We were a bit leary as we'd not heard much about this place and felt like we would have if it was any good. Since I had a Citipass coupon, and we were both getting crabby because we were hungry, we decided to check it out.  The atmosphere is a bit generic but there were a ton of tables inside; it is much bigger than you'd expect. There was a bar in the back and quite a few of the tables were taken, but we were led promptly to a booth. Chips and salsa immediately arrived and they were pretty good. I decided to start with the orange pineapple crush, which was delicious but a bit pricey at $9. I saw a happy hour menu with prices listed that were the same as the regular menu, but they did have drink specials ($2.50 bottles of Mexican beer on Thursday nights).   Our server, Karen C, was quite attentive (without being annoying) and even helped me choose my beverage. We got the guacamole made tableside ($9) and it was actually very good; I'd give it 4 out of 5 stars for how fresh it tasted. My boyfriend got the Enchiladas Verdes ($13), which came with only rice, so he had to order a side of refried beans (which ended up being enough refried beans for about four people). Being quite the enchilada aficianado, he said he enjoyed these. I ordered the fajita quesadilla, which was very good as well, but huge. I ended up eating a1/3 of it and plan to eat the rest for lunch AND dinner today...three meals for $10 is a great deal in my book.    Ultimately, if you just have to have some Mexican and Cantina 1511 is on a two hour wait (as they are frequently on weekends), this is a solid back-up choice. Plenty of parking available in the lots behind and across the street."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and myself met our realtor and her assistant after work to discuss a few items. We arrived at 6:00pm on a Monday night and it was mostly empty. We immediately got a seat by the bar at one of the high top tables. Our server was kind, but I believe he had a little bit of difficultly understanding us. We ordered drinks (2 margs)  and decided what we wanted to eat, while we waited on those. It took hardly 5 minutes to get our drinks- super quick service! And we had the same experience with our food, we waited probably just 10 minutes before our food arrived.   It was delicious! I ordered the Arroz Con Pollo and it was perfect, it was served on a very hot plate so it kept it's heat throughout the entire meal. As we were chatting with our realtor more people began to fill the restaurant and the noise level started to increase, we started to have to raise our voices a little to hear one another. So I would assume once all the tables are filled it might get pretty noisy. We left around 7:30pm so we weren't there very late.   We'll definitely be coming back here for the yummy food! Probably just after work though as I'd rather not shout to be heard. Although there is patio seating so during warmer weather you may be able to sit outside and avoid the noise."}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice now and both times I noticed the lack of anything red or tomato-ish?  The plates arrive very \"beige\" and bland looking.  The menu says you must request lettuce, sour creme and pico??  So when I requested it, I expected it to be awesome.  It just wasn't anything special at all...  the \"pico\" is simply cut pieces of refrigerated tomato with one or two pieces of jalapeno.?.  and it's a tiny little portion, very much feeling like an after thought...   It's also their policy to bring you the hot salsa with your chips so you won't eat much of it, so if you don't enjoy the hot salsa, you'll have to ask them to bring out the mild salsa.  And have them bring 2 bowls so you'll have some to pour over your bland food too!    The location is good, the servers are alright and the food will keep you from starving, but none of it is very memorable or really worth repeating  :-("}
{"text":"I was really hoping to like 1900 Mexican Grill based on the great things Ive heard about it.  Went in Saturday evening after finding out that Cantina had a two hour wait : ( .   Started with the Sangria which was a little to sweet for me. I wouldnt have believe there was red wine in it- and despite its large size and my empty stomach id say they were on the weak side.   We first asked for Guacamole and our server asked us if we would like it table-side and if we wanted one avocado or two. We gave him our answer but we were never given our Guacamole. When our meals came out I assumed he must have forgotten so I asked for it again and he came back and asked the same questions as he did previously, almost acting like we had never originally asked for it...no apology either. I will say once we did receive it I really enjoyed it.   My enchiladas were nothing special - it was quite a sad dish really. Nothing tasted fresh nothing was exciting about the dish.  I am not sure that id go back. I love Cantina and La Paz and this restaurant cannot compete in my opinion."}
{"text":"Loved the ambiance, service and food! There's plenty of options for goodies and for some of the picky eaters (like me). I had the enchiladas verdes with cheese and extra rice! So delicious and definitely plenty to take home for later.   The pay attention to every detail and it looks great and it very clean!! The staff is very helpful and the food is delicious!  I look forward to visiting and enjoying one of their popular events."}
{"text":"We chose this for Cinco de Mayo. Food was very good, $5 house margaritas were decent and potent, but the service was extraordinarily slow. We were there over an hour with no sign of appetizers or food, but hopefully that was because of the holiday. I would rate it higher if service were faster. I'll come again and see if they do better."}
{"text":"On the one hand, 1900 is a pretty cool space. In fact, it is almost too much space. It's freaking huge, a fact that is especially noticeable when there is no one else inside. Not having been there before, I really had no idea if this was regular or not, but it felt more than a little creepy.  The good news is that service was solid - something that some other places can have a problem with when the restaurant is nearly empty. Definitely not an issue here though.  Tableside guacamole was definitely a nice surprise - seems like more and more folks are doing it, and it makes for a fresh treat. But after that, the rest of the food was nothing memorable. There are better places around town for a run to the border."}
{"text":"What a wonderful experience here! We decided to come here last minute and they weren't that busy. Our server was very friendly and helpful. I got the combo with two burritos, one taco and rice and beans. Everything was delicious and filling. My husband got the chicken fajitas and he was happy with his meal. Their salsa is good but not spicy. We asked for a spicier salsa and they gave it to us and it was much tastier! Overall, the experience was great and we would definitely be back."}
{"text":"How about you guys/gals actually serve people at least water less than 15 minutes in to being at your restaurant? Took us 18 minutes before we upped and walked. Too many choices that serve food around the area that have far better service. Good luck going down this road to failure."}
{"text":"I used to like this place. Now there is a charge for many items that were free and they no longer make the favorite part of the menu- the salsa with corn and black beans.  The fish taco's were black d and the toppings minimal. It is expensive for the type and quality of the food, especially since they charge for even the sour creme. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere here for sure. Lots of tequila choices and some good beers as well. Chips and salsa were ok and I loved the tacos fundidos with steak. The fresh guac was excellent. They didn't come around too often on the rounds of drinks as we would have had another brew or three had they been sighted near our table. The cast of Banshee was hanging here and seemed to be regulars."}
{"text":"New menu alert: went here Sunday and was heartbroken to see that my favorite item was no longer on the list. Moment of silence please.   Tacos fundidos are my go-to here. Grilled chicken and cheese dip. Come on... yum!  The waitress saw my sad face and asked the manager if I could still order it. He said yes. Hooray!  Starters wise- The cheese dip is a good sized portion. So is the guac... and it's made is made table side. To put it in perspective for you: with a group of five girls we did both of these. We still had guac leftover.   I hope the tacos fundidos do not go away permanently with the new menu. I don't want to pick a new go-to. If so, fajitas it is then.  Parking is available on the street. Just make sure to pay attention to the meters. There's also a lot across from Nothing But Noodles.  I like this location a lot better than its counterpart on Park Road. Bigger restaurant, better service."}
{"text":"Sometimes, I drive here for takeout chips 'n salsa then walk next door and grab soup from the Chinese place. Does that make me a fattie? Oh well.  A-OK nails this place. It's not bad... it's not the absolute best.   When you sit down, there is a big empty bowl in the middle of your table. This is something I like to call guacamole entrapment. You may not have wanted to order it before, but you will now. 1900 will make it right there in front of you.  I pretty much order something different every time. What's my current food mood? Tacos? Fajitas? Something I can't pronounce that is covered in cheese? (yeah, that was my most recent order on Sunday). No complaints about any of it.  Although I have moved away from the Montford area, I relocated to a 'hood where there is another location. So don't consider this a break up 1900... just an it's complicated."}
{"text":"1900 Mexican Grill  5110-1E Park Rd Charlotte, NC 28209 Sunday May 14, 2017 3pm  I gave them 3 stars for being understaffed. We got quickly seated but had to wait for 10-15 minutes for our server to come to our table. I had to request drinks from another employee but they never came until we repeated the drink order to our server. Our server was very friendly and helpful but it was just a strain to get his attention.   I ordered the Carne Asada salad and it was amazing. The chile-balsamic dressing is the perfect compliment to the veggies and steak in the salad. I did ask for a side of cilantro ranch but it did nothing for the salad. They knew what they were doing with the dressing choice. My grandma had the Taco salad with Chicken and it seemed to be very wet/soupy. She didn't finish it. My other grandma had the grilled chicken and veggies. She really enjoyed her dish and even packed some up for later. My friend had the Enchiladas De Mole and was very satisfied with her dish.   I will def come back for the salad but if it seems busy I may just order togo. The waiting process was too much and the lack of staff really concerned me."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, location isnt bad - parking can be confusing the first time but it actually has a lot of parking behind the building. We went over lunchtime on a weekday, it was busy but we didnt wait long for our food. Salsa was good, service started out good but kinda slacked off. Food was very very good!!! Overall it was a great place and I def plan on going back!!"}
{"text":"Yummy Yummy in my Tummy Tummy.  I love my Mexican food and what a good little Mexican food place this is.  I can't remember what I got off hand but came with a group of 6 of us, and everyone tried everyone else's dishes, and they were all loved - which would tell me you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"As a veteran of So Cal Mexican food some 30 plus years, I feel qualified to say this is the real deal on Mexican food. Its upscale, the decor and the menu prices reflex this but in the end, they deliver the goods when it comes to bringing your table great Mexican food. Reservations are recommended on the weekend as this place was packed by 7pm!"}
{"text":"I went there at 730 on a Friday night. I had made a reservation but honestly I didn't need one. It wasn't crowded but it wasn't dead to the point where you thought the food was bad. I really enjoyed the ambiance.  My waitress was nice and friendly. The food was delicious and for me was reasonably priced.  And I also loved the drinks! Overall I enjoyed the restaurant and will be going back. The only downside would be parking may be a bit tricky. Just depends."}
{"text":"Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale, a tale of a tasteful grill, That started with some ice cold beer, and we didn't even spill,  The guest was a mighty Yelp!-ing man, his buddies still quite new, The dishes all tasted great, but the server didn't have a clue, didn't have a clue,*  The business started picking up; she didn't take our ord'r, If not for the chips and salsa there, I'd be headed for the bord'r, headed for the bord'r  The grub arrived on the edge of our barren dinner place, with fajitas, salmon rice, tacos asada and salsa, few more drinks, accoutrements, more napkins, here at the local grill!  * The server had no clue... we told her we wanted to go ahead and order dinner while ordering drinks, but when she took the drinks, she immediately left.  It was awkward.  Later on that night, it was impossible to get her attention--I think she was holding down two other tables, but man, she would laaaaaggggggggg.  And to top it off, after hardly checking on us through the night, she brings the bill over and tends to other diners.  While I'm filling out the tip, she comes right back, refills our waters (first time that night!) and then asks me if something is wrong.  Awkward since I was filling out the tip portion right there, and she kinda hovered.  Few other service hiccups, but will leave it at that.  So yeah, my lyrical prowess is limited since these details are missing from the theme song.  What a cop-out!  I'll come back here again bc the grub was amazing.  Everything hot, cooked well, meat still juicy, and everything had a great flavor.  Hopefully we get a different server.  I'm going to leave the stars at 2 for now, with room for improvement!  dmo out."}
{"text":"Good, but not great. It's always reliable for a solid meal to fill you up and is more consistent than a lot of the Mexican restaurants in Charlotte. Normally, I select from the Gringo Combo items because I'm usually hungry when I go there, but my favorite entree is the Mole Poblano."}
{"text":"I absolutely love 1900.    As a frequent flyer of all cheap Mexican restaurants I was a little hesitant at the $9.00 margaritas.  However considering the couple of entrees that I have had, the chips and salsa, and their rather large (and intimidating) tequila list....it is definitely worth it.   We've been a couple of times and I've had the taco salads, enchiladas, and chimichangas.  Holy chimichanga.  It was incredible. They put some kind of homemade cheese sauce on it that I would probably bathe in given the chance.    Also, if he is in ask to sit in Oscar's section.  He knows everything there is to know about their drink menu, including the best and the interesting.  We met him one night when we came in on a Tuesday at 9ish (they close at 10).  While we broke the cardinal rule of week night dining Oscar did not make us feel rushed at all. He told us to take our time and chatted it up with us until we were finished.    He even gave us the secrets to getting a good table there for Cinco de Mayo...which I will not be sharing.  I definitely recommend this place and plan on going back regularly.  The food amazing, drinks delish, and chips and salsa some of the best I've had."}
{"text":"Love 1900! The location rocks! The service is always amazing. We love sitting at the bar. Sean & Jose always take great care of us.  (we moved to another city and when we come to visit, the guys still remember our names and our drinks!) The food is great! The salsa is spicy with great flavor. The black beans are wonderful. I love both the enchiladas verde and the mole! 1900 has more flavor than Vida and more character than Cantina!"}
{"text":"Easily some of the worst food I've had in this town.  After dipping into the free salsa (read - v8 with some cilantro floaters) I asked for something spicier - and was brought huy fong cock sauce. I'm sitting there, staring at it, saying to myself, there's no way they're trying to pass this Pho condiment off as a housemade spicy salsa, but there it was, and that was the gist.  Aiight. Perhaps a beer will shroud my anger in a warm blankie of malt and hops and we can move along. Except they don't have most of the list - so I end up with a Dos Equis Lager, aka Mexican Bud. Sigh.  Fajitas were sub par and eerily sweet. Guac was olive-fading-to-bark brown, and dispensed very stingily. What did I attempt to eat? Their tortafication of a veggie burger, which despite muchos toppings, was mushy boredom. Served on waaaay too much Teleras bread. And unripe avocado, which, when put on a sammich, likes to make a run for it and squish out onto your lap/plate/shoe.  Our server was good. Poor girl. Find ye another fake-Mex place to practice your arts in cuz this one ain't gonna be here much longer."}
{"text":"It's disappointing because it *could* be so much better. The food, service and cleanliness weren't there. Whole thing can be summed up by this misspelled side item- so close, but still just not there"}
{"text":"I came here with friends and the food was really good. I ordered the fajitas and the meat was seasoned very well. The salsa was also pretty good and they increased the heat upon request. One thing that I would love to see improve...the hostess. Such a sad looking young lady with zero enthusiasm. You don't want to arrive to a place where you feel as if you're unwelcome .  Otherwise, the food and portions were spot on!"}
{"text":"Well, what can I say. I love Mexican food and this is pretty good. A group of us had just left a meeting and needed a place to unwind. It was a quiet Tuesday evening and the weather was perfect for sitting outside. The view of Uptown was perfect. We chose our Kryptonite and it was a pitcher of Margaritas on special. We were like Superman and folded after the first one. It was delicious!   A few of us ordered meals and the food was good. All of us being Latino and growing up with Mom & Grandma's cooking makes us a little tough to please but this certainly passed. I would definitely go back for more. This may become our new hangout after our meetings. :)  The wait staff was fabulous. They were so helpful in pulling a bunch of tables together for us quickly without disturbing the other diners and were quick to bring out the chips and salsa as soon as we were seated. They got all of our orders right and we were more than happy with their suggestions. BRAVO!"}
{"text":"Great fun....decor, staff. Drink specials and a Sangria are awesome! Good choices for food at a good price. And EXCELLENT Guacamole!"}
{"text":"Found my new Mexican spot! I ordered the Pollo con crema and it was wonderful!  The prices are higher than what you might would expect but it's not a hole in the wall authentic Mexican type of  place.  Elizabeth creamery is in the same building so it's perfect!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food and service has always been outstanding. I've been coming here for 2 years now. The table-side guacamole is the best! I think if you order the same simple stuff you can get anywhere (chimichangas, burritos...), there is not much difference. But if you order something a little different, like carne asada tacos, you will be pleasantly surprised.  I'm not much of a drinker, so I can't comment on the mixed drinks but they have Modelo on tap!"}
{"text":"Went last night with hubby and son (11). Great food, lousy service.   The meal started out well with salsa and corn salsa that was out of this world. Asked for more corn salsa 3 times before we received it.   Seemed that the servers were rotating around, and lost track of where were were in the cycle. Took a long time to get our food though it was not a busy night.   Ordered the pollo con crema and it was absolutely delicious. The fajita steak quesidilla was a bit salty, but good.   Service was not personal at all, beautiful atmosphere. May return."}
{"text":"Blown away about how good it was. Order arroz con pollo it was delicious, added the grilled veggies for an up charge it was totally worth it! Tasted fresh. The red sangria is not to be passed up. Suggestion is fried ice cream is great to share but the coffee liqueur was a little sting for my taste... they serve the liquor on the side I will know next time just to omit it.  Look forward to my next visit there!"}
{"text":"Definitely a fan of this place. They really know how to wine and dine you here.  1. There's a lovely hostess greeting you at the front (top 1 girl I've seen in CLT thus far) 2. The wait staff is friendly, fast, and graceful 3. Their bar is ideal if you want a quiet environment to watch a football game. 4. Their food is pretty phenomenal as well. 5. Enchiladas de Mole are top chart.  Didn't really pay attention to anything else as I was trying to make sure my gf didn't catch me sneaking that peek kiddddd.  LBD scale: 8.5. Definitely a really good Mexican place that everybody should try."}
{"text":"I had the Carne Asada served with rice and refried beans. I'll keep this short and sweet: tastebud explosion! I mean bursting with delicious, authentic flavor! The atmosphere is awesome! As soon as you walk in, you transition into a small Mexican town that's bursting with great music, excellent food and really cool art; mixes of modern pop culture and traditional pieces. This is a MUST-GO"}
{"text":"I got a laugh out of the idea of the \"burrito chingon,\" but the food was mediocre. The arroz con pollo was in shreds rather than chunks, so it was dry despite the sauce, and the cheese was just dumped on top instead of having any creaminess to it. The service was depressingly unremarkable. I doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! Great chips, great salsa, great queso, great everything! Orange was our waitress tonight and I can't say enough good things about her. She was so sweet and attentive and absolutely deserves a raise! :) I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"When you  gotten stuck in rush hour come in to this place for a soup and the guacamole fresco made at your table."}
{"text":"Good food and service.  I enjoy a good Mole Sauce, and theirs did not disappoint.  With a group of friends, all the food came out at same time and nice and hot.  I had chicken stuffed with goat cheese and the mole sauce, with rice and fried plantains.  Would order again. Many good items to pick from on the menu, and the prices are decent--a good value.  May be my new favorite Mexican restaurant. Did I mention they have a good Margarita?!"}
{"text":"A recent purchase on the Restaurant.com website brought us here, and I was pleasantly surprised.  -Chips and Salsa.  You get regular salsa, as well as a pico de gallo-type corn salsa.  Delicious, and with free refills.  -Appetizer.  We got the cheese dip.  This was very good, even though I suspect it was from a jar.  Still, it's pretty hard to mess up cheese dip.  -Bevs.  It being Sunday, margaritas were $3.  They were fine.  For $3.  a bit weak, but again, $3.  I noticed that some very good drink specials were featured on other days of the week, including a $2 pint night on Fridays.  -Entrees.  I had the \"Fajita Salad,\"  for $10 with carne asada.  The steak was a little bland, but the rest of the salad really made up for it.  The taco shell was still warm, and the salad didn't have an overly large amount of the shredded iceberg so common to taco salads.  There was a generous amount of cheese, sour cream, and the \"good\" type of jalapeno (not too spicy, kelly green).  My boyfriend ordered the \"pick three\" combo for $9.25.  It came with three items of your choice (enchilada, taco, etc) as well as rice and beans.  Service.  Our waitress was very attentive and prompt.  All in all, this place is worth a visit.  On a side note, they feature probably more than 80 tequilas."}
{"text":"Ive eaten here for 7 years or so now. I enjoy the food, typical mexican. Their shredded chicken is one of my favorites of all the mexican places I eat it. Good service, never had to wait, patio is nice when it isnt blazing hot. Lunch prices are good, dinner I usually split a combo since its a good amount of food!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Food was delicious, although the menu selection was sorta slim. The combo meals are good though because you'll always find something you can eat. Delicious margaritas were on special for Cinco de Mayo, wait staff was very friendly and the free birthday dessert was a treat as well. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great place. Friendly/efficient service and delicious food. Got a three combo platter, was plenty of food and was able to take a taco home. Generous amount of chips. Frozen margarita was strong. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"A neighbor recommended this place.  No difficulty being seated, and our drink orders were taken immediately.  Chips and salsa arrived.  The salsa had a canned taste; however, our server brought a corn salsa and guacamole spontaneously.   I got the chimichangas stuffed with cheese.  They came with rice, beans, lettuce, sour cream and guacamole. Quite good.  My husband ordered the vegetable fajitas with corn tortillas.  He seemed surprised when a plate of rice, beans, lettuce, guacamole and salsa arrived with his grilled vegetables.  He did not use the corn tortillas and appeared to prefer eating his rice and bean plate, along with the vegetables.  My husband stated that the vegetables had no seasoning, but, to be fair, he did not consume them in the way intended.  I did try the vegetables, and they needed salt and pepper when consumed without the other items.  Salt and pepper not on the table, which seems to be a trend with restaurants these days. My husband had a touch of the grouch that night, so my review is primarily based on my experience.  I will return when he is having a night out with the guys!"}
{"text":"I suppose the fact the place was completely empty on a Saturday nights should have been my first clue that this wasn't going to be that great..  We had a party of 4 and everyone pretty much had the same response...everything was \"ok.\"  The highlights...or should I say lowlights are below...  --Salsa was like hot sauce poured in a bowl.  Too hot to enjoy and nasty --Tableside guacamole was bland --I ordered the steak tacos...the steak was shriveled up and disgusting.  It was like baby food and cow toenails marinated in lard.  The consistency was more like chicken but softer.  I can't explain it...it was just wrong.   --Wine menu was limited and expensive for the brands --Service was so-so   Overall, wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"TERRIBLE. JUST AWFUL!! When I arrived 15 min late for the birthday party, the other guests were just getting served water after being there since 7:30. Chips and salsa were already on the table, and not a drop to drink? They started to place drink orders and I was confused...in all the restaurants I've ever worked if you did not SERVE the drinks within 5 min, you were in trouble! But no matter, let's have fun...once we finally got the drinks and appetizers (reservation at 7:30 to go to a show at 9:00 down the street - should have been more than enough time) at 8:00, we placed our food order. A different server came to our table each time. It was almost comical! We had to bus our own table to make room. We finally called the manager over and he just said they were really busy. The restaurant was full, but it was a Sat nite, we were a large party that called ahead, and they were just so completely disorganized. Amazingly, once the orders finally came out (9:00), they were relatively correct. Mine was cold, though others were hot so it was clear mine was ready long before. The food was okay, nothing particularly special. Certainly not worth that kind of a wait! The manager offered to take off 1 round of drinks and the guacamole.  The least they could do!! He was clear to point out only ONE round. Got it. Then it was time for the bill...oh boy! You guessed it - one check. I get that restaurants sometimes have a policy about splitting checks or whatever, but there were 10 of us, any decent server would have asked ahead of time just to avoid major confusion!! So, we were left to fig it out on our own. Easier said than done. Some had cash and needed change, some cards, etc. Just a nightmare from beginning to end. Finally left about 9:45, missed the 2 opening acts, but made it for the headliner. Will not ever go there again!! Save your money and time!!"}
{"text":"It has been years since I have been to this location and tonight was somewhat disappointing since my last review. Service was VERY slow! I ordered the chicken fajitas. What Mexican restaurant doesn't serve fajitas in a sizzling platter??? The chicken, onions and peppers came on a plate with beans and rice. Unfortunately everything was like warm. The sizzling platter would have kept everything warm. Needless to say I enjoyed the salsa and margarita, but definitely was underwhelmed with the food. Too many other better Mexican restaurants out there, but is a good spot for mediocre food."}
{"text":"When you are looking for some good Mexican food, not tex-mex, nothing fancy, just good old Mexican 1900 is a good choice. Although the food isn't the greatest it hits the spot. Unfortunately on this visit the chips were very stale with a truly bland salsa. With that said we enjoyed the quesadillas and fajitas. The Refried beans with melted cheese, yum! The service was good, nothing spectacular and the margaritas could use a little more tequila, ha ha!"}
{"text":"1900 does one thing amazingly well. Their drinks are unique fresh and you can tlel they put energy into their drink menu. I had a guava mexican mule and my girlfriend had a great vanilla infused marg.  Checking the menu it seems the drinks rotatae and I see a great passion fruit Marg i would try next.   The guac is also great but for the food I say stick to the basics such as tacos.  The more expensive items just don't deliver.  Service is friendly and competent. That is all I ask for and they delivered."}
{"text":"love the arroz con pollo but is the terrible service even worth it??? We had to go on a hunt for our waitress Diana every time we were in need of a refill or the check. Also... why don't they give you your coins when they give you change for paying in cash??? every single time???"}
{"text":"Good Mexican Restaurant.  This was the 1st place that i experience where they make the guacamole right at your table.  This way you could tell they were using fresh ingredients.   The staff were very friendly and came around often to refill drink and check if everything was ok.     The food was good for east coast Mexican.  I still haven't found a place the serves green chili's they way they do out west.  The chili's good, but they just tasted different'.    If you haven't been they are worth checking out at-least once.  Keep an eye out for groupons."}
{"text":"Food is pretty good, but we had horrible service and the food and drinks were overpriced for the quality. The margaritas were the worst I've ever had, no alcohol in them at all."}
{"text":"I arrived with a coworker at 12:15 which should have been smack dab in the middle of the lunch rush. Most of the tables were filled, but the hostess was able to seat us promptly. A minute or two later, a bowl of chips with two different salsas was dropped off as our drink order was taken.  The chicken fajita burrito was served on a very hot plate with a large amount of rice and no refried beans. Freshly made, it had a lot of flavor and good consistency. The rice was cooked properly - I've been to other restaurants where it was dry and crunchy. Not here.  There were a few large screen TV's set up and tuned in to the sports channels.  The waiter was attentive, but not too much so. We were left to enjoy our meals in peace. Separate checks were offered without our having to ask.  As Mexican restaurants go, this was good. I've had better. And I've had a lot worse. Three stars today."}
{"text":"Stupidly ate here a second time.  Never again.  Food is bad and prices are high."}
{"text":"We came here last night for a quick dinner since we've always been curious about 1900 ( and we didn't realize Cajun Queen closed at 9:30p). The interior and decor is nice, had a darker atmosphere. Our server was less than friendly and didn't really say much. She also seemed rushed despite it being an hour before closing but, I guess I get that. But, I didn't appreciate that she didn't bring out the chips and salsa until after we asked her for them. Chips and salsa are Mexi food staples. The chips were good, not great, and the salsa was only meh, they need salsa tips from On the Border.   The bf ordered the chimichanga enchilada combo for $9.50 and I ordered the mole enchiladas for $13. Our food came out surprisingly quick. The bf like his chicken chimi, it had good, white chicken pieces and an ok size portion of queso while the enchilada was a little dry, it tasted pretty good, even their regular rojo enchilada sauce was good. The mole sauce on my dish was very good, definitely hit the chocolate notes with some spice, I just wish there was a little more spice. The chicken inside was also flavorful and seasoned. I loved the consistency of the beans but, the rice was weak sauce. The Spanish rice was really bland for me. For $13, there needs to be more food or the dish needs a price reduction. It's good for $11 max."}
{"text":"Except for Salsa, which is very good....food is just average.   Chicken and steak fajitas were mostly green peppers and onions with very small pieces of chicken and steak...flavor was ok.  Other folks had beef taco plate and chicken burritos...also all very average.  My server was great...friendly...attentive.    If you're in a pinch or coming out of the Harris Teeter it is a \"functional\" Mexican restaurant"}
{"text":"Full Disclosure: I am rating this place without trying any of their drinks.  The drink menu looked great, we did not get anything.  The highlight of our meal was the queso dip.  I liked this queso as much as any I have had in Charlotte. I almost licked the bottom of the plate clean.  For dinner the burrito was good, not great, as it was 90% rice.  Another plus was the servers, though.  Very friendly and on top of everything.  I would return here, but not sure if I would go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"So I try to enjoy what I have heard is excellent cuisine, however,  I never got service. While waiting I saw plenty of fairer skinned people come in after me, and receive service. After waiting for a while we decide to leave and did not even get a glance from the staff. I realize most people assume that blacks can't afford their menu, but we were completely ignored. This establishment will never receive a dime from me."}
{"text":"Ate lunch there today, the food was bad, the service was worse.  We were given menus, then seated, then given chips & salsa before our server came to the table.  We waited quite a long time, but nothing that a \"sorry about the wait\" couldn't have smoothed over.  When she finally came to our table she didn't welcome us or introduce herself, she took our drink order, then came back & took our food order.  Cheese dip came (delivered by a runner), thick and pasty & tasteless.  We had to ask for more salsa (we thought that adding some to the cheese dip might help it), the server we flagged for the salsa then noticed we were out of bevs & refilled our drinks.  A runner also brought our food, I had the arroz con pollo with vegetables $11.50.  Bland chicken, bland overcooked vegetables smothered in tasteless cheese over rice with a side of sour cream and tasteless pico de gallo.  My friend had a salad with chicken, she said the chicken was ok, but the salad was soggy.  We wait for a long time for the table to be cleared, when our server finally came to the table she asked \"you want a box for the queso?\" (which was hardly touched) & when we emphatically said \"NO!\"  she never asked \"was anything wrong?\". (Note that there was not an opportunity to complain to her since we did not see her from the time she delivered the queso to the time she cleared the plates).  She delivered the checks, didn't say even so much as \"thanks for coming\".  I tipped her $3 cash on a bill of $17.  I wrote her a note on the bill: \"I tip you as as a recognition of how hard a job it is to work in food & bev. Your service is terrible though.\"  Or words close to that effect.  There's nothing she can do about the poor food - but the poor service is inexcusable"}
{"text":"Not a good experience. Took the family after church today. Chips were just ok, salsa was super runny, like a bowl of watered down salsa with hardly any tomatoes. Ordered fish tacos and it was the kind of fish you get in the frozen section at the grocery store, fried. Topped with a small amount of tomatoes and a little slaw, and doused with sauce. Came with refried beans that weren't tasty and a side of rice that was bland and not good. My husband got a mix of hard and soft beef tacos with the same two sides, they are kind of standard. He was not at all impressed with his food either. Got two kids meals and those were no good either. Honestly it's hard to believe how this place is staying in business. Walking out there was a couple on the sidewalk thinking about eating there who asked me how it was. I said not too good and they thanked me and kept going. Certainly won't be going back and will not give any positive reviews on this place! I hate that we spent the money we did, definitely our loss. :-("}
{"text":"They have a great house margarita and the carne asada taco's are to die for. Very authentic."}
{"text":"Stopped in to 1900 on Saturday night at prime dinner time.  Luckily we were able to be seated quickly.  The standard chips and salsa were brought to our table.  The salsa was good with a nice kick.  The chips were just ok.  Sangria was on special ($6) that night so I ordered a glass.  It was well-made with fruit flavors that paired well with the wine.  I ordered the Huitlacoche Quesadilla which featured mexican cheese, corn truffle, roasted poblanos, and corn pico.  The positive is that they give you plenty of quesadilla.  I think there were 8 sizable slices.  I wish they had come with some sour cream or extra corn pico on the side.  Our service was fine but defintely not overly warm."}
