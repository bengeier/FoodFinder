{"text":"Expected a decent bacon cheese burger, but was disappointed. The frozen, not fresh patty was excessively salted. The bun was so hard and stale, it must have been one week old. The lettuce was fresh, but lost in the stale bun. 

We will not return."}
{"text":"I am typing this with a smile on my face and my belly full of cheese burger and fries :') ! Tat burger is a great addition to College St ! It's good food for cheap which sounds great to me! The atmosphere inside the restaurant is casual; and for restaurant that serves burgers and fries, the furniture is rather nice ! I wish I had stayed for my meal! 

The restaurant was originally the Taurus Grill House. It looked like a promising place and I actually regret never going inside... Anyway, they closed up recently (I suspect they were barely scraping by and they hadn't made enough profit to keep the restaurant going) and within a week or two, the restaurant was being renovated to become the new Tat Burger! They kept Taurus' lighting, marble table tops, counter and sign. Except the big gold bull and \"Taurus Bar and Grill\" on their marble sign was replaced with a simple \"TAT BURGER\" in bright bold red. The seats are nice as well! Maybe they were also \"inherited\" from Taurus :P! 

Upon entering the empty restaurant, I was greeted quite kindly by the chef of the place. He quickly took my order for a cheese burger and fries and another worker came to collect my money while he started on the food. I am very happy with the food I got for my money. The burger pattie was thick, juicy and delicious and there was a generous amount of fries that came with it ! It cost me \"$5.09\" tax included! Soooo worth it! 

The worker informed me that I was welcome to take a seat while I waited for my food which was a good idea. I can guestimate it took about 10 minutes to prepare my order which I was surprised with ! Isn't fast food supposed to be a lot faster? I didn't mind though. The chef was being very dilligent with the food and I had a comfy seat for my bum :) 

After a brief 10 minutes, the chef called out that my burger was ready. I picked up my bag and headed for the counter. I hadnt noticed before, but behind the glass window they had a very colorful array of different \"toppings\"(?)  for my burger! I got everything on mine ! That would include: slightly roasted bell pepper (green), sautéed mushrooms, sliced purple onion, iceberg lettuce, sliced tomato, chopped cooked asparagus, pickles, jalepeño, hot pickled pepper rings, relish, mayo, feta cheese, blue cheese and grated parmesan cheese, and finally ketchup and mustard :') what a variety eh? He assembled the big burger, wrapped it in a red and white checkered burger wrapper, packed it in a big styrofoam box and  proceeded to the fryer to load it up with some fresh made fries. Yum ! He then turned back to the counter and set the closed box down for me. \"Here you go, okay ?\" he said with a genuine and happy smile. I thanked him graciously. I assume they haven't had many customers come through their doors (which needs to change asap!) but I have VERY high hopes for this place! Great food, low prices, nice place to dine and kind service ! I love it ! Very very glad they opened in my neighborhood ! I will be returning soon ! 

Ps! Their menu consists of more than burgers and fries! They have bagels, omelettes, sandwiches and dinner specials ! I highly recommend others to try this place out :) I had a great experience and you'll be glad you stopped by too!"}
{"text":"This is just an update from my previous review, from about 8 months or so prior. 

The last several times I've eaten from this location, the food quality has gone downhill. The burgers are under cooked, I can still see red uncooked beef in the middle, on which I can't stand seeing or eating without having the urge to puke. 

The fries on the other hand, different story. They're usually over cooked, and a bit stale. Enough salt brings in the extra flavour though. Although the serving size has gotten smaller too and more expensive. 

I don't think I'll be eating here again, but if I do, it won't be for a long time."}
{"text":"Tat Burger shows there's a difference between cheap and inexpensive. Mind-bogglingly lowball prices may set expectations low, but the food is delightful. Burgers are well seasoned with a bounty of free toppings to choose. The poutine is great, despite another reviewer's tip otherwise. Open till 3am on weekends which is perfect. Go there and try it yourself."}
{"text":"First time to tat burger last night was also my last time.
Unfortunately my complaint isn't about the food... food was ok... wouldn't go out of my wsy to go there with so many better spots to choose from... I don't care about the prices of stuff when it comes to eating.
As I'm ordering my food I hear a customer flag over the owner... there was an issue with her meal. I stopped ordering and tried to listen in... I felt the woman taking my order was trying to distract me from listening just on case it was something nasty in her salad. It wasn't anything nasty... it was  worse... it was extremely extremely dangerous... there was steel wool (wire) in her salad. If she ate that and it sneered her intestines that could have been really bad. 
The offered her another dish she declined... I agree... she looked a little scared from that ordeal... anywsys the owner comes over and I immediately ask him what was the issue.... he absolutely tried to sugar coat it from me which shows u what kind of owners they are. No concern for customers well being. Fuck that shit!! 
Moving forward.... me and my buddy ordered the super combos. Double burger fries and a drink. We ordered gravy on the side. 
Once paid he asked what my order was... I told him and mentioned the gravy on the side 
Then when he started to prep the orders the cashier reminds him gravy on the side.
2 min later he fills up a container with fries and puts gravy on it 
I told him gravy on the side. His face expression.. he knows he fucked up. Oh well shit happens right?  U apologize to the customer and make a new batch of fries to correct it.. sounds logical no? Well this is what I really didn't like about this mistake... instead of apologizing he asked if we were sure we couldn't eat it with gravy on top. Bad move but it gets worse... in his peanut sized brain he thought that he could now place our burger in a take out container along with the ridiculously small side gravy and fill the remains spot with fries 
Basically he took one order of fries and made 2 orders  from it cause he didn't do it right the first time 
So basically we paid full pop for our order and got half the fries 

Look mistakes happen... it's how u deal with them that make the difference 

Not apologizing 
Asking if it's cool to ear the way it is instead of fixing 
Splitting one order of fries into two orders
Not explain to a customer what another was complying about 

All these things are extremely wrong when running a business 
I was there one time and seen all this ... scares me to think what else the cut corners on 
I do not recommend this place cause burgers are flat pan cooked not on a grill 
Horrible ownership is a recipe for disaster"}
{"text":"Super nice chef. Dirt cheap food made fresh to order. What a find!"}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place I have to say.  Service is ok food is ok like I said nothing special. Clubhouse is good and depending I assume on when you go the fries are ok too...Fries seem to vary for some reason lol. Looking for a cheap belly filler can't go wrong"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Prices are fairly reasonable and no real burger options in the area. Lots of different toppings to put on the burger which is nice and the fries are good. 

I'd only come here if it's late and you're in the area or you're really craving a burger and live in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"First came for breakfast and got 2 orders of 2 eggs with bacon or sausage, home fries and toast, along with an order of 3 pieces of french toast, an orange juice and a coffee for under $20. Everything tasted very plain and the coffee was apparently really bad, but it certainly was a rather good amount of food for the price.

Then I most recently got a bacon cheese burger and fries to go for under $6 after tax. The burger looked really good, but ended up leaving me rather indifferent towards its end result. They had a decent variety of toppings to choose from but I'd skip the mayo. It looked like it had been sitting out for a while.

The bathrooms are an interesting experience. The walls and ceiling along the downstairs hallway are covered with obscure record sleeves (the type of mish mash that could only assume came from value village), and records are glued along the stairwell as well.  It's actually kind of cool but very out of context for the place as everything else is newly renovated.

Serving staff are friendly, and everything is priced super cheap (rib eye steak and potatoes are $8.95?), but didn't find anything impressive in the flavour category."}
{"text":"Very happy with my burger. Wasn't anything amazing but for $5 couldn't ask for more. The burger was filling and reminded me burgers off the BBQ. 

I wouldn't go too far out of my way to try this place. Many better burger joints out there but if you're close by this place is worth a try."}
{"text":"Burgers tasted fresh. And all day breakfast! Had the best service from the server named Nan. 

Definitely recommend if you're in the area."}
{"text":"3.5 Stars*
Pretty decent.
The burger is okay, nothing special about it, with lots of great toppings on it. The fries were actually pretty good, and cheap. There is a nice seating area with a T.V. The menu, looks kind of cheezy. The distorted pictures of the food, brings the place down to a lower class, and it seems they are all over the place with items on the menu. They had only  one option of wings, bagels, burgers, greek salad, fish..etc. Stick to one item will you!"}
{"text":"The burger patty was bland. The fries were refried. The toppings looked stale. Wouldn't go back."}
