{"text":"Went there not long after I came back from a trip to India.  The food was good and tasty. We had a bunch of dishes to share. The only issue is that it was during winter and the restaurant was cold. I don't know if it was a heating issue or if it's always that way. In any case I would suggest going there in the summer to bypass the only inconvenience I have with the place."}
{"text":"OMG sooooooo full.  We ordered 4 different meals, which we shared among. All was outstanding.  Avoid Saturday to busy, for obvious reasons. Thanks to Haseeb, we were well served and he guided us well with the menu selections."}
{"text":"Great food, I order off menu asking for a dry garlic sauce on fish and it's phenomenal! The menu is very creative, and tasty.  If you like variety, and spice to your dishes Royal Tandoori Grill is definitely a must experience."}
{"text":"This location used to house one of my favourite Indian restaurants, Karma. After an incarnation as a Mexican restaurant, I am happy to see it back to being an Indian/Pakistani restaurant. While much of the former elegant decor that was Karma is now gone, it remains an attractive space, just far more casual than it was.  That being said, the food is delicious. It is clear that fresh and quality ingredients and being used and prepared by a skilled chef. The classic Indian dishes do not disappoint, right down to the naan bread.   The staff are all super friendly and provide helpful guidance in navigating the extensive menu. When we complimented the food, they were genuinely pleased that we had enjoyed our experience and remarked that the chef took great pride in making delicious food. This attitude, lacking in so many restaurants, makes me want to support them and I hope you will as well."}
{"text":"We took some of our friends who wanted to try authentic Indian/Pakistani food to this place last week. Being our first time too, we didn't know what to expect.. The restaurant is set in a quite a grand building, with ample parking and also a terrasse. The interior is very fancy, beautiful colours and also a gorgeous grass & floral wall! There was an anniversary party happening at the same time upstairs - it looks like a popular place for parties and banquets etc. We ordered the mix grill for starters, onion bhajis and cucumber salad. I was extremely pleased with the grill as it included a great variety, not mainly tandoori chicken like most places do. The flavours were gorgeous and more on the spicier side which I loved! We had naan bread accompanied with mint chutney and a chilli sauce too - both lovely! I had the lamb jalfrezi for my main course with naan bread which again I found very well done... The lamb was a bit chunkier than I expected, I would have preferred it more tender. The food, ambiance, interior and service was all perfect however, the disappointment for me being my first time was that parties have the buffet set up on the main restaurant floor and so it can get quite loud and overcrowded. Though they seem to  have an upstairs floor for parties, it seems they do not cater up there... Maybe we were unlucky to have an event happening at the same time.  Other than that aspect, I would definitely return to Royal Tandoor for another spicy meal!"}
{"text":"Friday is also called treat day ! Called up my best friend and his girl ' time to go on a double date ! Left the south shore and drove up to the West island, got some traffic but a great mini road trip to an amazing destination ! The restaurant is very easy to find and is actually a very big location, we ordered a mix grill for 2 but were able to share it with 4 people as an appatizer accompanied with 2 naans :)! We had onion bhaji and cucumber salad :) the complementary chili sauce and minth/yogourt was too good couldt stop dipping the naan in it and eat it :)! We ordered lamb balti, butter chicken and beef jalfrezi ' we share them and all were excellent ' not too spicy and great balance in the flavors ! We tried kulcha naan with sesame and also the regular naan both very soft and super hot ! We didnt have place for dessert !   They have an 87 place area on the second floor like a mezzanine, great place for bday party or anniversary ... The only downside is during our dinner the buffet of the attandees was beeing setup in the main hall, suddenly all the guests from the party came down and took over the main dining hall and there was a long queu around the tables for their buffet !   Overall amazing experience !  Always order your naan one by one so you always get fresh and hot ones :)!"}
