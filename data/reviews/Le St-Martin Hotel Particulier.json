{"text":"We stopped in Montreal for a couple days on our way to a wedding. It was our first time in the city and we were looking for a central location with plenty to do within walking distance. We had 4 fantastic meals within 2 blocks of the hotel and there were plenty of shops. There was an entrance to underground Montreal right across the street. We also walked 2 blocks to the tourist info office where we were able to purchase tickets for and board the Gray Line hop on- hop off tour. I only wished we had more time there. There was so much nearby that we never explored much farther than 2 blocks from the hotel.

As for the hotel itself, the staff was fantastic! Everyone was extremely friendly and the bellhop staff in particular were especially attentive. We chose all of our restaurants based on recommendations from the staff and never had a bad meal. There were 4 of us and we were comfortable in our 2-queen room. It was clean and nicely decorated. Both the room and the bathroom were bigger than expected. In fact, I think it was the largest bathroom I've ever had in a hotel. 

There was a restaurant in the hotel but we never ate there as there was plenty within walking distance. The staff parked the car for us. It was about $20 a day. I didn't notice any public parking in the immediate vicinity but I still would've used the hotel parking for convenience-the staff unpacked and packed our luggage for us. 

Overall we had a wonderful experience. If I ever decided to visit Montréal again, I would definitely be staying here."}
{"text":"This boutique hotel is without question the BEST I've ever stayed in, and I've booked here twice. It's intimate, new, super chic and modern with a small but well designed pool. The rooms are top notch, regardless of your particular room specs. 

The customer service here is also second to none. It was around 11pm or so when I asked the front desk what time the pool closed. I believe he said 10pm, then winked at me and said that he didn't mind that we hopped in anyways. What a way to treat a guest!!! We had a GREAT TIME enjoying the pool after hours, and it made us feel as if it was exclusively booked for us for the remainder of the night. I even burned one freely with me and my lady (at the time). That's what I call a vacation baby.

I ABSOLUTELY LOVE MONTREAL- Old and New - the smell, the people, the French influence, everything. Le St Martin Hotel helps make my annual trip an absolute blast.

Go Bruins!

{"text":"Thank you, Hotels.com for placing this hotel within our search terms.  The room was very well-appointed (very comfortable furnishings, fireplace, great decor, large bathroom), the staff was incredibly professional, music greets you in the lobby, elevators, and hallways, and the location is ideal.  It's easy to drive to, a block from the Peel Metro stop on the green line, and close to several wonderful brunch spots, stores, museums, and the Bell Centre.   If ever in Montreal again, I'd definitely choose to stay here."}
{"text":"So we were going to be in Montreal for a night, and I wanted to stay someplace cool.  My wife started looking for rooms at chains where we had points, but I wanted something just a little bit different.  Something that fit my image of Montreal as being so close, yet so far culturally speaking.

Nailed it.

The room was beautiful and beautifully decorated.  The art was nice, the bed was nice, the sitting area was nice.  The bathroom was maybe the best I've ever had in a hotel, with white tile, glass shower and gorgeous tub.  A tub so big it could comfortably fit even my fat ass.  Which I tested out...twice in one day.

In fact, the stay started out perfectly!  We arrived on a cruise ship that morning around 8, and headed to the hotel to drop our bags off.  I had called the day before to make sure they had a secure place to store our luggage until our room was ready, and the (very friendly) staff did us one better: they actually had our room ready for us at 9:30 AM.  

As to location, it's a 10-15 minute walk to the Museum.  McGill's campus is a couple of blocks north, and the amazingly beautiful Cathedral Marie Reine du Monde is a couple of blocks south (I highly recommend Mass in French).  Also within three blocks walk is a flagship store for the Roots clothing brand, an Avis car rental facility, plenty of bars, lots of restaurants and patisseries, ice cream, fun shopping, and movie theater.  There are, I'm not even joking about this, no fewer than three good coffee places within one block.  Yes, including a Tim Horton's.

But the best compliment I can give this hotel is to repeat something my wife said.  As I marveled at the tub, and the view, and the Tivoli stereo that was already playing Montreal's classical music station as we entered (and which we had on all the time we were in the room, and awake, for excellent mood setting), my wife said, bemusedly, \"I've never seen you be in a hotel room for ten minutes without complaining about something.\"

Yep.  That sums it up."}
{"text":"In two weeks I've been two times there for a total of 9 nights. I've had two different rooms, one with a large bathroom. Both of the rooms have had a nice (faked) fireplace. Service personnel has been very kind and reliable. The only two thing to be criticized is the very little gym (don't go on the trendmill if you are tall!!! you will hit your head) and the in my opinion too expensive breakfast (only à la carte).

Otherwise highly recommendable! Next time I will be in Montréal I will go there again for sure."}
{"text":"Stay Away!!! Not sure what any of these people who reviewed this hotel are talking about. I had the worst experience of my life at this hotel. The staff was rude and thought my friends and I couldn't afford a place like this.

I have travelled all over the world and I would rather sleep on the street than stay at this hotel again!"}
{"text":"We got a voucher from a group coupon type business, and we loved our stay here.
The staff was very friendly and very knowledgeable. We loved our room. The big bath tub with the mini tv was a bonus. The rooms only issue was the temperature. Too hot then too cold. The staff made many restaurant suggestions for dinner and even booked us at a great Portuguese one. The included valet parking was also very convenient. We will be staying here again."}
{"text":"Hotel is located in a great spot - very close to the Metro. 

Unfortunately, our experience did not meet our expectations. The A/C in our room was not working - after multiple calls to the front desk and people coming up to \"fix\" our A/C we had a terribly uncomfortable first night. 

The next morning my husband went downstairs to speak to someone and change rooms and the staff had no idea that we had been having problems. Once we explained the situation again - we were provided with a new room with working A/C for the second night. My husband asked what the hotel would be doing to compensate for our first night and was told that no manger was available at the moment but that they were sure a discount would be provided. 

When we checked out - we again had to bring up the A/C story as once again no one had made a note in our file. The manager on duty promptly came over at our request - however again had no idea about our problems during the first night stay and couldn't actually compensation without checking in with upper management. We had to pay for both nights - no discount and he told us that he would be in touch with us once his boss was out of a meeting. 

TERRIBLE customer service - if you cannot react to a clients immediate needs you do not understand customer service. The hotel should have had managerial staff on site in order to be able to OK these situations. 

We left the hotel and were suddenly chased down by the on-site manager who called us back into the hotel and provided us with a gift certificate for a future nights stay. 

Once again - this was not what we were looking for in terms of retribution - not to mention it expires in 6 months and we are well over a 6 hour drive from this hotel. 

This on-site manager told us he would follow up via email to discuss further..... we are still waiting for his email almost one month later. 

TERRIBLE customer service. 

- the staff at the reception counter were friendly, professional and helpful and offered us water for the long drive back as she could see we were not pleased. Much appreciated. 
-rooms were new and decent sized
-good views from the hotel rooms
-excellent outdoor pool"}
{"text":"I surprised my girlfriend with a weekend getaway to Montreal a couple of weeks ago with plans to propose to her. When planning the trip, choosing Le St- Martin Hotel was an easy choice as it is centrally located to great shopping and dining and offers great amenities (heated pool & clean fitness center). We had a very early flight and arrived at the hotel way before check in time and instead of telling us we could not check in, they told us our reserved room wasn't ready yet but they had suites available for only a $30 upgrade charge. The suite was spacious and had a beautiful bathroom with a large tub. Wifi was super fast and reliable which was great for us since we were travelling from the states with no cell phone connection in Canada. The best part of this hotel was the helpful staff. They helped me plan my proposal process through email a week before I arrived and also made sure everything went as planned on the big day. I couldn't thank them enough for being so helpful and caring about this big event in our lives!"}
{"text":"This was a beautiful hotel! Perfect location being only a few blocks from Crescent St and right next to the metro. The rooms were pretty spacious too with a nice sized bathroom and shower. I had breakfast at their hotel and that was pretty good too! The beds were super comfy and they had complimentary water bottles in the room. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because the service can be a hit or miss. They do not have a formal concierge and the people in the front desk can be helpful at times and sometimes not. We arrived on a Sunday so it was pretty dead and the one person at the front did not know much. But overall a good experience! Oh and also, the wi-fi is free in the entire hotel!"}
{"text":"One of the nicest boutique &affordable hotels ,with European flavour you can get.
Friendly staff,well appointed rooms & washroom,with ample coffee in room.
Beds are comfortable,surrounding is tranquil,even though near the highway."}
{"text":"When we got to the room we were greeted by the music playing off the radio. Room was clean and tastefully decorated. Great place to stay for a romantic getaway. The room came with a Keurig coffe maker and Acca Pacca toiletries. Outdoor heated pool was to die for. You can't beat the location -- 1 block away from Simons and right in the middle of everything!

Why the 3 stars?

Service was a hit and miss. One valet parking guy was friendly and accommodating, the other one was cold. The front desk staff was okay. Not very warm and welcoming either.

We went to their restaurant/bistro for breakfast the next morning. Let's just say we had better food and service! The staff barely cracked a smile. They looked unhappy to be there! They served us burnt toasts and they messed up my husband's eggs. He ordered fried eggs/over hard, but got over easy. 

Overall, it's a nice hotel. Just don't expect great service!"}
{"text":"I don't usually write bad reviews. about once a year I end up somewhere I feel deserves it though.  this one is it. 
I stayed with a large group. we had about 25 rooms. I have never heard so many complaints about staff being rude and  unaccommodating in our party... it was almost comical.  

the hotel is great but if u want to be treated like shit, this is ur spot. maybe some people like that.  maybe we didn't look or speak the part of such a French boutique... oh well. there are much better spots for next time."}
{"text":"Favourite hotel in Montreal, hands down. As a frequent female business traveller, I visited quite a few hotels before settling on one that would become my regular - and Le St Martin it is! Love the modern black and cream decor, conveniences like the Keurig coffee maker and a fridge that I can put my own drinks in, the beautiful shower (incl plush robe, and high end toiletries), comfy beds and pillows, and techie touches (TV, radio/dock, touch lamp). Oh, and definitely their superstar customer service. Wish the restaurant would have a few more simple selections for dinner after a long day at the office, but the breakfasts are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Worse snow storm of the year prediction caused us to abandon our hotel in Quebec City at midnight. We arrived at this hotel  at 3 am and were greeted by nice front desk gentleman. 

We finally got tucked  in for some needed sleep only to be awaken hours later by a long false fire alarm that made us all get dressed, then pounding on doors next to us an hour later , followed a few hours later by a call from the front desk to tell us check out is  11, and we needed to be out by 12 or pay $40. 

Don't come here for rest or refuge"}
{"text":"Love the rooms!!
the full soaker tub with the TV was very sweet!!"}
{"text":"OK where to begin?

The good:  the rooms are nice and the beds are comfortable. 

The not so good:  overall, it's a waste of money.  Over $350 per night.  The elevators are set up so you have to swipe your card to access your floor.  However, if you're on the 2nd or 3rd floor and not the first person on the elevator, then expect not to get off on your floor on the way up.  The scanner is very slow and the elevator very fast.  Not a good combo.  Wake up call at 5 am so I can make my flight?  Well I got it bit at 4:45 am.  Not so good for a jet lagged traveler wanting that extra 15 minutes of sleep. Guess I'll sleep on the plane. And that internet?  Yeah, the first night took me over an hour and two calls to the front desk to get anything.  Plus the front desk had to call a technician. Twice. You may wonder why the bell hops wear pith helmets?  Because you have to fight through a jungle of plants to get to the front door.  Seriously, those blessed grasses in the planters cut my arms each and every time I entered or exited. Tis merely a flesh wound so no worries.  But don't plan on actually getting inside if you're on crutches or in a wheelchair. Lastly, bring your own toiletries.  I think the soap is 100% lye. I've had better in a Motel 6.

The final verdict?  It's probably better than some hole in the wall but I cannot recommend it. The bed was comfortable enough that it kept me from giving it one star.  Otherwise not impressed at all."}
{"text":"We got two standard rooms for a weekend stay in Montreal and couldn't have asked for a better hotel. From the second we pulled up to valet to check out it was a fabulous experience. Didn't get to check out the pool, but the gym was on our floor and it was small but very nice, new machines. The rooms were clean, bathrooms were large enough for all the girls to get ready and the beds were very comfortable. Around 8pm on Saturday a lady passed through with a complimentary snack cart which was a very nice touch. 
The hotel was centrally located for us, just above st Catherine with lots of shopping if that's what you're looking for. 
I would absolutely stay here again!"}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVED our stay here! Great service from the front desk staff the minute we walked through the door to check in. The location is great -- right next to Rue Saint-Catherine with all the shopping and restaurants. We also ended up doing the Hop-on Hop-off bus tour, which has its pickup location at Dorchester Square, which is an extremely close walk from the hotel.

The rooms are beautiful with comfy beds, a fireplace, and gorgeous bathrooms. This is also a very small detail, but we appreciated the complimentary bottled waters provided in the room, which were replenished each day (don't you hate it when hotels charge $5 or more for bottled water?).

Would definitely recommend Le St-Martin to anyone looking for a nice boutique hotel experience in downtown Montreal."}
{"text":"This is my 2nd stay at this hotel, both times on business trips. The hotel is located right on the corner of Maisonneuve and Metcalfe and is pretty much central to shopping, restaurants, the Metro, etc. The hotel is clean and the staff are very friendly.

I booked the Grand Lux room with the fireplace. It was a nice layout! The bathroom had a separate shower and claw-foot bathtub. Three louvered sliding doors separated the bathroom from the bedroom. There was a little \"fireplace\" in the corner, but it didn't actually have fire. It was one of those ones with the fake logs in front with flames projected onto a screen to simulate fire. It was cute and nice for some nighttime light. I liked it! The room was a good size with a nice work desk area. I was able to get work done without many distractions.

I was out most evenings during their 5-8pm turn-down service where they come around with a cart of free snacks, but did catch it once. I grabbed a couple of bottles of water and a bag of chips in case I got peckish. It's a nice touch!

I found the WiFi to be a little slow, but it's free and was good enough for me to check my mail and access websites. That you could connect up to 5 devices was a nice feature.

The service is friendly and the location is great! I'd stay here again for sure!"}
{"text":"Beautiful hotel, but a little noisy.

Found a decent deal on this hotel and the reviews looked positive so decided to go for it. My husband and I were spending one night in Montreal before heading to Quebec City and opted to be closer to downtown. 

The pros: The rooms were clean and modern as shown in the pictures. Staff was nice and accommodating and helpful with answering questions around restaurant recommendations. Hotel is close to all the great shopping on St Catherine St. and a wide variety of bars and restaurants downtown. 

The cons: Very noisy! We had a room that faced the street and you could hear all the street traffic as well as the people that were eating/drinking at the restaurant in the hotel. Also, while the hotel didn't have much control over this, there guests that were running up and down the halls and yelling at 4am!!! This went on for a good 30-45min and was super disruptive -- especially since this was a Wednesday night! I assume they were drunk, but it would have been nice if the hotel staff took notice so that people who were trying to sleep could do so. 

Overall a decent hotel, but if you stay here, keep in mind the walls are thin!"}
{"text":"This is a lovely hotel, well managed with comfortable rooms. It has a certain quirkiness to it that is unique to the Québécois culture (the safari hats that the concierge wear, for example). 

I stayed with a friend. We had two beds, the room was large as was the bathroom. The glass wall (with shutters) between the shower and the bedroom was another quirky but cool detail. 

Beds are comfy, wifi is free, mini bar fridge, and late afternoon (free!) snack lady that knocks at your door. Very prompt room cleaning as well. 

I recommend this hotel, and will come again. Centrally located in downtown Montreal."}
{"text":"This place was simply amazing. I found them through their deal on Groupon. Our valet parking was included but initially they thought it was not. They had no problem looking further into it and letting us know that they were in fact mistaken. The valet was an awesome young man and very helpful. He was eager but not overbearing. 
The front desk staff was knowledgeable of the area. The location of this hotel is awesome. It's close to many restaurants and shops. The Metro is also right across the street. We were able to park our car and not drive at all until we were ready to leave. We walked to the Montreal Museum of Contemporary Art, Old Montreal, the Old Port, and many restaurants. 
The gym and pool are cute but not really that usable. The pool is really just something to look at...it's one lane...literally. the gym is a tiny space and I'd be afraid to use the equipment...lol. 
I would definitely go here again and again."}
{"text":"I'm writing my review as I'm spending my last night of 6 nights at this hotel. My favorite thing about this hotel is its location. It's about a block away from the nearest metro stop (Peel), although you probably don't need to take the subway to get to most attractions if you don't mind a bit of walking. It's about 5 blocks away from one of the main entrances into Parc du Mont Royal (at Rue Peel and Avenue des Pins Ouest), and it's a must visit on a nice day!

Oh heck, that's not my only favorite thing about the hotel. I love their daily complimentary coffee and bottled water refills - two things I need daily, their super firm yet fluffy pillows, and their workstation with desk top outlet (so you don't have to crawl under to plug/unplug. The big shower head makes me want to take 4 showers a day. Standard room comes with a sizable shower stall, no bathtub, in case you're into that stuff...

Some reviews on Tripadvisor complained about the wifi. Let me just affirm that I haven't had any wifi connectivity issues during my entire stay here. Wifi is consistent and relatively fast. It resets every 24hrs so you just need to reenter your room info to restart the cycle.

The gym is on the 4th floor right by my room, which I never used. I took a peek and thought it was pretty small, but I really didn't have the need to run like a hamster on my vacay when I'm walking everywhere.

The room service from the restaurant downstairs (L'Aromate) is prompt (but pricey as expected)! It took them 10-15min to deliver my food, and they were pretty tasty.

My only gripe is the full size mirror. Mine has the fattening effect, or maybe I'm just in denial about my food consumption in Montreal. If that's the case, leave me alone. 

Thanks Jetsetter for the great deal!"}
{"text":"This hotel, a little Valentine's Day treat we gifted ourselves, is an awesome establishment.

Not only were the staff super courteous and easy to deal with, but our room was phenomenal. Windows from ceiling to floor spanned the entire room (Verriere room - stay in that one!) and gave a cool view over Maisonneuve. Despite being in the heart of downtown, we heard nothing from the street which was a pleasant surprise.

The bathroom was beautiful as well and had double sinks with a gorgeous jet tub. 

A nice surprise came along around 6 pm where free snacks were being offered to the guests (sodas, juice, chips, etc) - I found this to be a nice touch!

All in all, a great hotel.. Possibly one of my favorites in Montreal so far!! Stay here - I promise you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Elegant and classy place in the heart of Montreal's \"Golden Square Mile\". Expensive as all downtown hotels are but apparently they sometimes have special deals. The location is great, with a metro station across the street and many nightlife hot spots (Cresent St., Rue Ste. Catherine) within walking distance. Staff was extremely professional. Would stay here again."}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon and we were not disappointed. It was super cool and modern without feeling too trendy. We also took advantage of the deal through hotels.com and we're so glad we chose this place!

From our fourth floor fireplace suite, we could see the Peel Metro stop across the street. That was really convenient. It's also right around the corner from Rue St Catherine- a busy shopping area (which has one of my personal faves- LUSH!) complete with restaurants. We were able to walk to breakfast every morning as well as the Musee des Beaux-Arts. Since it's downtown, it's not quite as a traditional tourist location as Old Montreal, but all that is accessible via the Metro or a cab ride. 

The room itself was really comfy. The bed was cozy and soft and the bathroom was big with a tub to die for. There was a \"wall\" of sliding wooden slats that separated the bathroom from the rest of the room so you could open that up if you wanted. I made sure to visit LUSH and pick up some fun bath products and took advantage of that tub! 

The staff was very helpful- one of the valets even escorted us down to our car to retrieve some things even though you could tell he didn't want to. Then he disappeared before we could tip him! 

We didn't end up eating at the hotel restaurant. It looked way overpriced.

We would definitely stay here again on our next visit to Montreal (which I hope is sooner rather than later!)."}
{"text":"3 minutes walk to Peel Metro, 1 minute walk to underground city via Le Cours Mont-Royal, and close to rue St Catherine . We chose the more fancy room with fake fireplace, standing bath tub with TV and corner room. It was clean,spacious and there is classical music greets you from the music pod. Considering the location and room condition, it was a good deal. However,no breakfast included, you have to pay for the mini chocolate, there's nothing special about the toiletries and we don't like how they have a 11 AM check in and 4 PM check out policy. For any late check out ( up till 3 PM) , there is CAD 40 + tax fee."}
{"text":"My husband took me to Montreal on a weekend getaway recently and we stayed at the St. Martin Hotel.  

The hotel is very clean and the staff are nice.  I was slightly disappointed that it took us 25 minutes to check in though because they only had 1 staff member working the front desk at 8pm on a Friday night.  

I don't know if all the rooms are like this, but our room had a glass wall separating the bedroom and the bathroom, so one person can lie in bed and watch the other person take a shower (!).  Great for lovers on a romantic getaway, but probably not so great for roommates or \"just friends\" sharing a room on a trip.  There was a wooden sliding door with slats/blinds on it though, so you can close the door and blinds for privacy.  However, the person in the bedroom has control of the sliding door, the person in the shower has no control of the door.  You have been warned...

I loved the fact that this hotel is just across the street from the Metcalfe and de Maisonneuve entrance/exit of the Cours de Montreal, so when the weather is terrible, you can just duck into the Cours de Montreal and access all the other downtown malls, including the VIA train station, all underground.

Now on the website, they state that they have a \"turn-down service\" where they come around with a cart of free treats (nuts, chocolate, chips, etc.) between 5pm and 8pm.  Other reviewers have mentioned this too.  Unfortunately, we never got to experience this :(

The WiFi is really fast and reliable.  

Toiletries are from \"Acca Kapa,\" which I had never heard of, but when I looked them up online, I found that \"Acca Kappa\" (with 2 p's) is a company in Italy that makes luxury spa products.  I am looking at the toiletries from the hotel right now and they all only have 1 p in \"Acca Kapa,\" so I don't know what's up with that (?!?).

Overall, a clean hotel that looks very new.  I would stay here again."}
{"text":"Beautiful hotel! Prime location! Friendly staff! Top two hotels in Montreal if not the best!"}
{"text":"I stayed at Le St-Martin on a recent trip to Montréal and I really enjoyed it. 

+ First of all, the people working here are so, so friendly. (I think everyone in Montréal is super friendly though.) 
+ Then, the rooms are really, really nice - spacious with comfy beds and good showers. 
+ Thirdly, the location is good, fairly close to a metro stop even. 
+ And finally the price was more than reasonable.

They have a restaurant onsite that also offers what may have been the best room service breakfast I've ever had. And free Wi-Fi. I would definitely stay here again!"}
{"text":"So the hotel was really good! Gym disappointed, but the pool more than made up for it. We got a surprise charge for extra guests, but I guess that's just policy. It's $20/night per person extra that you have. Loved the area and the room though!"}
{"text":"Great hotel. Lovely rooms. Very comfortable and cozy setting for a weekend away. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I stayed here recently while in town for Osheaga. 

It was nice coming home everyday from the festival to a gorgeous, sparkling clean hotel. 

The location is fantastic - under a 5 minute walk to the metro, shopping, restaurants and nightlife. 

The hotel itself is clean and nicely decorated. There is a bar with outdoor seating that is open until 11pm. 

Great security - no one can access the building without a key after 11 pm, and no one can access any floor but their own. 

There is a pool - I hungout here most of the day when I didn't feel like going to the festival early. 

Would recommend 100% and would certainly return next time."}
{"text":"This hotel is new--since June 2010--and they are doing so many things right!  First, it is well positioned in downtown Montreal with the underground and many fine restaurants and cafes nearby on Rue Pell or Rue St. Catherine.  I speak no French, but the staff immediately switched to perfect English and sought to make my stay absolutely trouble free and comfortable.  They made restaurant recommendations, provide travel advice, even printed my airline boarding passes for me.  So kudos for great service.  The room was spacious and lovely--I had 2 queens in an uncrowded room which was stylishly decorated.  But the BEST thing about the room was the shower.  There were 2 rainshower heads--one hand held--and HOT water.  A hot shower is exactly what I needed after each day of hard work and the shower was invigorating!  The restaurant food was pretty good too!  A nice plus was the gorgeous chocolates that I was greeted with at the end of my work day--not laid out on a pillow, but offered on a platter as you walked into the lobby.  Plus free wi-fi.  Found this gem on hotels.com with a great deal--listed as a 4 star hotel at $165/night.  This is the real deal.  I'd love to stay here again!"}
{"text":"Le St. Martin Hotel Particulier is a very nice luxury boutique hotel. We stayed in room 904 from 22 July to 27July 2014 ( still checked in at the time of this review ). The room type we booked is the Verriere Suite. It has huge windows that span the length of the room over looking Boul. de Maisonneuve. The room was a little smaller than it looks on the pictures on the website, but over all it is a good sized room. The bedroom area had a fire place with a small chair and ottoman. It would have been nicer to have a second chair and a small coffee table or something so we could sit together to have coffee or do some work. The bed was super comfy and luxurious! It was hard to get up and out of it every morning because it was so fantastic! There was plenty of storage space so we could fully unpack our luggage. The closet is not huge, but we brought our own hangers from home and made it work. The bathroom was a gem! The real icing on the cake for me. The tub was so huge I could almost take a swim and the shower head had great water pressure. There is also a TV in the bathroom which was great! I could watch CNN every morning from the comfort of the bathtub! The counter had his and hers sinks which was very helpful in the mornings, I only wish there were some shelves to store toiletries and makeup. Our counter was literally covered with stuff because there was no space and that was a little hard to navigate. There is a magnified makeup mirror near the counter which was very helpful, however the lighting in the bathroom is not the greatest - but I make it work. There is a small desk area with outlets and a reading lamp which served as a great place to research activities and restaurants during our stay. Housekeeping did a great job every morning, save for a few inconsistencies. Some mornings the coffee mugs/supplies were left in the bathroom and not where they originated near the coffee maker. Also, a lot of mornings the had soap was not replenished. For two days we had only a sliver of soap which was a bit ridiculous. Over all this was a great stay! Customer service was super helpful in allowing us to store a bicycle in the luggage room although it was against protocol. My boyfriend is a cyclist and having unlimited, immediate access to his bike is crucial for him. We greatly appreciated the front desk accommodating us on that! I would most certainly stay here again! No major complaints from me!"}
{"text":"Cash in those capital one miles, yep too cold too swim, even in Montreal's cool, not cold weather.  Service, food, directions to the best spa and fine dining, they knew all the hot shopping spots and the museums we wanted to peruse.

Tremendously impressed when I stated I needed a 4:00 a.m. wake up and a 4:45 a.m. taxi, typically can't find a cabbie or someone aplogetic they snoozed thru your wakeup call.  Expensive yes, a respite after a long day.  Room service speedy, not much selection on menu.

The staff so helpful while we were going through a harrowing home purchase and faxes were flying back and forth they were helpufl, remained calm, and remained true to speaking English.  Room was spotless, sometimes they forgot the coffee pods, but no worries. Be ware of the tub, it has a shower head that goes off the grid and if you happen to have a splash of a bath you will bust your butt and have to pay them for the radical shower head which has affinity for splayin the tv and celing, very romantic room with the fireplace and chilled wine, wined down after awesome spa services across the street.  

Not into duck or rabbit and the bistro is really really loud, service slow, martinis good, and the risotto and steak swimming in truffles sauce, desserts you dream about.  Convenient to anything, grab a bike and pedal to McGill Museum.  

First evening there, something was burning, the elevators closed and fire department called - they buzzed the rooms but never came over the loud speakers after an hour they assured us we could walk down the 9 flights of stairs to get our own ice, they could have exceeded our expectations...reason they did not get 5 stars."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the nicest hotels I have stayed at....I stayed in a suite and had nothing but top notch service and it's located right in the heart of where you want to be....Great bar, great food.... nothing but the best with this place! I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"My friend and I stayed here for four days and here's my review: 

Good:
--You cannot beat the location. Right in the heart of downtown and steps away from the Metro, it's a prime location. That being said there's always construction/traffic going on so if you don't mind that, it's a great area. 

--The room we had was perfect: Two comfortable plush beds, TV, microwave, fridge, coffee maker, etc. The bathroom is a bit weird since there is a window between the shower and the living room. Not sure if voyerism in the shower is a thing in Montreal, eh? But a big plus for the hot water pressure! Bathrobes and slippers are available too. 

--There is a pool and fitness center which we didn't use, but I did take a peek and it looked really nice.

--Despite being in the middle of everything, the hotel is very quiet. It has somewhat strict rules about noise so I wouldn't suggest the hotel as a place to bring young children. It is nice after a night of partying to come to a quiet hotel. 

--Free wifi. Spotty at times but it did the trick, I was able to use it when necessary. 

Not so Good

--Housekeeping overall was ok, there was a few spastic moments, but nothing that would cause me for concern. They do keep this place very very clean. 

--I had forgotten my sunglasses at a cousin's house and she dropped it off at the front desk for me, the first time I asked the girl she barely looked around and said nothing was there. Tried again before we left and no nice. I would think they could've kept it there with my info or simply brought it up to my room or left a message.

I think overall it is worth the money, the location you can't beat and the service was overall great. I would try this hotel again."}
{"text":"Since I'm a pro in online shopping, I found an awesome HauteLook deal for the weekend.. This hotel is beautiful. The inlaws upgraded and got a sweet room, ours was small but no complaints. The location is very central, close to shopping and great restaurants. Free wifi is always a plus.. 

They lose 1 star for the not so pleasant guy at the front desk.. Aside from that, my experience was top notch."}
{"text":"It's an attractive hotel with excellent staff.  The attached bar is expensive, of course, but the breakfast is incredible in the morning.

I had no trouble throughout my visit with the exception of one relatively minor point.  Apparently the person in the room prior to me had helped themselves to some minibar popcorn (the minibar is really just an open plate of snacks, and someone comes in once a day to take stock of the plate) and due to some accounting error, they were never charged for the missing popcorn, and it was never replaced.  So guess who got charged for it when the woman came to take inventory after my arrival.  Yeah.

It wasn't a major problem though, since it required no effort at all to have the charge removed.

Everything else about the hotel is top notch, and the location is excellent -- walking distance from... well, walking distance from more than you could possibly see in only one visit.  I'm coming back again, for fun rather than business next time.  If I can swing the cost without my company footing the bill, this is where I'll stay."}
{"text":"5 star all the way, clean, attentive staff, price equal to the service recieved, proximity to everything, and a mint on your pillow.
Seriously stay here if you want to be pampered."}
{"text":"I was so disappointed in my stay here after reading so many positive reviews. 

I had booked for or a special weekend with my boyfriend.   Yes, the hotel itself is beautiful. The Classic room itself is very tiny, but very nicely decorated and cozy. The bonuses the hotel offers, such as the pool open late, are nice features. Minor things - the television having very few channels - aren't a big deal and don't matter in this review.   

First of all, valet parking. I called the front desk twice to ask where we were supposed to go. Both times, they told us Metcalfe/Maisonneuve - and both times, I explained we were in front, there was traffic, there was no where to park (the 'designated parking areas' - being full), and it was impossible to simply remain in front. I explained both times that we couldn't remain double parked and were just driving around. I had to get out of the car while my boyfriend tried to find parking somewhere and explain this to front desk. I explained this to the representative at the front desk, and she kept repeating 'De Maisounneuve and Metcalfe'. Out of frustration she had even added, \"I'll park the call myself.\" I simply said, \"Sure.\" - before she finally called the valet and had him assist us. He actually said, \"Yeah, I saw them diving around outside.\" ...Okay. No problem.  

When the valet finally moved another car for us to leave ours, it was 4:40 - 40 minutes after check in (yes, that's how long the issue with parking took) - and when I tried to check in, the room still wasn't ready. I had to ask again some time later before the representative confirmed it was ready. No apology or anything. 

Yes, front desk is frosty, not helpful, not sympathetic . There was no question about this each time I had to speak to them.   

At night - on a Saturday - the elevators simply didn't work. It was around 2am. I had to tell a representative at the desk who had to call. They eventually started working again.  

 I chose a package that included free parking, free breakfast and check out at 2pm. The day of our check out, someone disturbed us at 1pm - even with our sign on. When we didn't answer after 3 knocks, she tried to come in. When we answered her, it was a representative of the hotel. She said, quite simply: \"Why are you still here?\" We replied that our check out was at 2. She said, \"Oh, okay!\" then proceeded to go to the room beside us and do the same thing.  Check out is normally at 11am.

 I would also expect a hotel of this quality to know who paid extra to stay 2 hours later.   For a hotel of this quality and price, these 'minor inconveniences/annoyances' simply shouldn't exist. I was so disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a very smooth check in. I was impressed with the Immediate phone call I got asking how I liked my room. Upgraded for $20/night for a bathroom with a soaking tub, high floor, fireplace. The bed was so comfortable. Room was very elegantly decorated. Not too gaudy. Complementary Asian pears and water available during the stay. Great front desk staff. Good location. Also I asked for scissors and a band aid during the stay and this was promptly provided. Downside is construction but the noise stops during sleeping hours. So happy I ended up here from Expedia."}
{"text":"Where to start? This hotel defied all of our expectations! Upon arrival they took our bags from our rental car and parked it for it since we were going to utilize their hotel parking during the duration of our stay. The check in process was a breeze and they allowed us have a very early check in. A staff member took our bags to our room and showed us different areas of Montreal on a map that they provided to us in the room. The front desk staff couldn't have been friendlier throughout our stay. The bed was comfortable and the room was large. The bathroom was surprisingly big and also had a big tub which we didn't expect. The outside heated pool was really nice at night.

There were zero negatives about our stay at this hotel. If we return to Montreal we wouldn't think about staying anywhere else. One of the best hotel stays that we have ever had in all of our travels."}
{"text":"Searching for a hotel in Montréal was difficult for me. From most of what I saw, they all looked interesting, but was unsure if I wanted to stay in the back roads or Montréal's metropolis. I analyzed every image, to satisfy my picky ways and Le St Martin, came on the very top for me in terms of their noticeably classy style and reviews. Additionally, their non-typical look, also, sold me. In essence, Le St. Martin has all the elements of a boutique hotel: (at least for me it did) upscale design with a nice contemporary vibe! 

It starts with Le St Martin's high-rise exterior, which is no comparison to the upscale appearance once I went inside. Right off the bat, lobby alone, spoke volumes: it's modest but so plush. My room? Even more so. Not a hair out of place and bathroom was pristine! Le St. Martin offers free wi-fi- only for the first day, Valet service is always up and ready, (if you're going to use your car, call and allow Valet 10-15 minutes prior, leaving to your destination) and gym is opened, around the clock. The combination of pleasant staff on hand with smiles and great hotel stay, made my mini vacation feel luxurious. To add, service was extremely personal and attentive.

I'm extremely delighted with my choice here, as I didn't want to stay in a traditional, branded hotel and Le St Martin went above and beyond, to fit the bill."}
{"text":"I stayed here for a weekend throughout the celebration of my Grandfathers birthday. The experience was perfect. I was greeted at the valet, the bell hop was ready to grab my luggage and i was escorted inside to the reception desk. The gentlemen at the front desk had everything ready to go simply grabbed both card and ID. Scanned it, in a matter of minutes i was being shown to my room. Everything is so clean and the staff are all very nice. There is a sense of pride with the entire hotel that emanates clearly throughout the presentation and staff. The Valets were courteous and very easy going. It was very smooth and i would only stay at this hotel when visiting Montreal. There is a attached restaurant and we were able to dine there and the food was incredible. The building as a whole is just a pleasant experience. would absolutely stay again."}
{"text":"My best friend and I stayed here a couple of nights for a girls trip. We arrived early to the hotel; way before check in time. We were greeted by their friendly doorman and concierge. Early check in was not available and only pre check in which includes a $150 hold on a credit card; the normal no big deal. We finished our pre check in and we were both handed complimentary bottles of water (for first time check in clients only). We proceed to hand over our bags to be held until we could check in later on. Our friendly concierge informed us of places we should go and marked out a map with directions of the Metro and Old Montreal. 

We returned to the hotel later in the evening and check in. We were giving our key cards which operate the elevator and our room; also large towels for their pool (Located on the second floor) our bags we taken directly up to our room. Our room was beautiful, bright with a king size bed, decent size LCD T.V, beautiful bathroom but no bathtub. The only downside of the room was the sliding doors that opened from the shower to the bedroom (see photos), no real sense of privacy. It's not a deal breaker for me anyway. The hotel is located in the business, shopping district and about a 30min walk to Old Montreal. It's a great location with a lot of things to do, from shopping to climbing Mount Royal and having some fantastic meal too. 

After a long day of walking around you can enjoy a nice dip in their tiny, cute and comfy pool. I only got to enjoy one night in the pool since my second attempt of a night dip left me with a sad face emoticon since it was closed for maintenance at 8:30pm on my second night stay. I didn't check out their gym because my thought is, I'm on vacation and I'm not working out. So if you're looking for a great hotel to stay at while in Montreal, Le St-Martin has me sold and I will stay here again when I return.

FYI it's a little pricy and can cost you $200-$300 a night."}
{"text":"5 star boutique hotel and 10 star service. Stayed here for 2 nights back in June and wow it was great experience here. They are so kind and will answer all your questions along with helping you as much as they can.

My boyfriend and I got a suite and the room was large and extremely comfortable. The hotel also allowed their guests to use the heated pool outside which was a great addition to our stay!

Will be returning here next week and can't wait. Very reasonably priced for the great large clean rooms and outstanding service.

Recommended for everyone!"}
{"text":"I have been meaning to write a review about this amazing hotel for a few weeks now. I stayed here for several days and can say it is one of the nicest and most chic hotels I have ever been to and gave me a great impression of beautiful Montreal. The rooms were clean and elegant and the staff was friendly and helpful. The hotel itself is well-located in the busy Centre-ville section of Montreal literally one minute from the Peel metro station and TONS of shopping. I'll let the travelers decide for themselves, but the main things I thought stood out:

1) GORGEOUS albeit small lobby with the most beautiful creative floral arrangements, changed every few days. Those things must be expensive, but they really looked amazing! 

2) Super friendly hotel staff, not annoyed that we didn't speak French like some other Montreal natives we encountered. The people at the front desk as well as the doormen were so accommodating and gracious. 

3) A bathroom unlike any other, as seen in some of the pictures. Instead of a wall between the shower and bedroom, there are wooden panels THAT OPEN FROM THE BEDROOM, not the bathroom. In essence, that means that someone from the bedroom can simply open them and watch someone in the shower. I imagine that could be quite romantic in some sense, but it just made us laugh and go \"what the....?\"

4) Beautiful little restaurant where we had breakfast and delicious cappuccinos. We were in a hurry, and they were very quick. 

5) Fresh fruit in every hallway replaced daily, and a complementary food and beverage cart that visits the rooms nightly offering soda and snacks. Keurig machine and complementary k-cups for quick coffee every day. So nice and unexpected.

This hotel is a gem and a definite must if you want to stay somewhere upscale with a practically perfect location."}
{"text":"Well located, clean hotel with friendly staff. Parking available for about $20 a day, and there's a nice, warm little outside pool worth visiting. If you get a good deal it's a great option."}
{"text":"I did some research and with the price I paid for a weekend in this hotel...I think I scored.

Free wi-fi, small but decent sized fitness center and an outdoor pool with a mini waterfall built into it. Also the location in between two metro stations was a plus.

Caroline street is only a few blocks to the south and there is plenty of restaurants all around.

And as for my room, my bed was super comfy and the shower has a glass window that looks directly into the room. Pretty neat stuff.

Ice was scarce and the elevator did take a bit of some time, but other than that, I had a pretty good time here."}
{"text":"My friends booked this hotel, so I expected the worst.  It was actually probably too nice for the group of guys I was with.  The room was nicely appointed and the location is perfect for anything you want to do downtown.  I would definitely recommend this place to families or business travelers.  Check-in was really slow, but I guess that is something you deal with when you skip the big chains.  Overall I was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"Cute hotel in the heart of downtown Montreal. Very concerned with how we were doing (i.e. Called room after we unpacked to ask and asked every time we left the building if we needed anything ). 

The hotel is very pretty inside -- carpets, lamp covers, lobby, all very well decorated and coordinated. 

Layout of the rooms are interesting - there is a glass wall between the bedroom and bathroom (see picture). There is a sliding privacy screen, but you can see into the room from the shower. A bit odd, but okay for us since we are a married couple. May be an issue for other pairs. 

Parking is crazy overpriced so we parked down the street at the bank for 6$ overnight. One block away. 

Turndown service! They knocked on our door at 5:30 with tea, coffee, and pears (which were delicious). Knocked in the morning with coffee and tea as well. 

We are walkers and it's an easy walk to the Mont Royal and Old Montreal and Chinatown. 

Not in our usual chain hotel repertoire, but it may get another overnight mini-vacay from us next time!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best hotels I've stayed in. Ever. The check in process was easy and the front desk staff was great. We had a pretty hectic day of travel and checking in here was quite the respite after all that. 

The hotel is beautiful, and not just the lobby. It's attached to a restaurant also so if you don't want to get out and about in the city you can eat here. Also, this hotel is convenient to the subway, the underground city, and a large variety of shopping and dining. Our room was outstanding. When we walked in there was classical music playing and I'm telling you they must have known I needed to chill after traveling. The bed was big and comfy and I never wanted to get out of it, but I guess I was in Montreal to see stuff and not just lie in this big comfy bed and watch tv. The bathroom was a good size and the shower was very spacious. I had more than enough room to shave and shower without getting a leg cramp or something. There's a mini bar in the room too. Of course, it's more costly than just going outside but the convenience factor is enough to make me pay a premium. 

Oh, and shout out to the housekeeping staff. Our room was on point every day and I appreciate that.

This is definitely where I'm staying the next time I'm in Montreal."}
{"text":"Great hotel!! Very nice rooms and staff was very accommodating ! Definitely will stay here again when I visit Montreal"}
{"text":"I'll start with my biggest complaint, a fraudulent charge to my CC 11 days after checkout.

A little back info: I stayed here May 10th 2018 to May 13th 2018, approximately $750 USD for 3 nights. On my drive up from NYC, I was charged over the full amount, $1000 total per room, at around 12 noon on the 10th. I called to see why, and they stated its standard procedure and the extra money was for room incidentals. Ok, whatever, no big deal I guess, should have waited until I got there. 

On May 13th I checked out and they went through my room while I waited at the front desk for them to finish. I was told everything was fine except a small charge of about $3.50 USD for my use of the mini bar. My $250 for incidentals was credited to my account and I left.

On May 24th I got an email alert of a $350 USD charge to my CC from the hotel again, which was not authorized by me and is illegal and fraudulent. I did receive an email from the hotel which stated that I broke a desk chair in my room and I have to pay $450 Canadian dollars ($350 USD). 

1) I never authorized my card to be charged for this, 11 days after my stay.
2) I never used the desk chair, let alone break it.
3) You checked the room at checkout and released my $250 incidental deposit, and charged me for the minibar use. This means you cleared the room.
4) Its 11 days after I checked out.
5) Its been 2 days, I've replied to the General manager Rossella Rao twice, and I haven't gotten a reply. I have also called the front desk and was told I had to call back the next day to speak to a manager.

Thats my biggest issue I had this time, not only was there a fraudulent unauthorized charge to my card, but it was for something that had nothing to do with me, and no one replies to my emails. 

Second complaint: I stayed here in sept of 2016 and we enjoyed the restaurant for breakfast every morning, so much so that we ate here on our 2017 trip, even though we stayed at another area hotel. We paid more for this hotel this year for that reason, and when we got there, the restaurant was closed. No notification at all and we were promised a discount at checkout by a manager for the inconvenience. At checkout I forgot to ask, and when I remembered at home, I figured it was no big deal, we survived without it. But it was a cute trick to offer a discount at checkout knowing we may forget since 4 days would have passed.

Third complaint: The Valet, that is $40 a day, needs to get their act together. The first trip I was waiting 15-20 minutes for my car, and I was told I should call ahead next time. This year I did call about 15 minutes prior to my departures, and when I would get to the lobby the car was not there. Not only that, but 3 of those times I asked the front desk when I got to the lobby if my car was ready and they said yes. Then the valet that was standing in the lobby ran out to get my car, which took another 15 minutes.... Whats the point of calling down? $40 a day plus tips, at least have my car ready.

4th complaint: This place really isn't for Americans. The staff is cold and not attentive to english speaking Americans. When a local speaking French would ask a question, the demeanor of the staff would change right away for the better. I know Americans aren't liked, but its no way to treat paying customers.

This next issue isn't the hotels fault, but due to the construction this hotel is in a terrible spot and you always end up diverted the wrong way due to construction and end up in heavy traffic, there are far better places to stay based on location, like the Sofitel a few blocks away.

Safe to stay I would not recommend this place to anyone and I would never stay here again. I'm sure I'll get a reply to emails after I post this because they'll pay attention if it hurts their reputation and future bookings."}
{"text":"This hotel was amazing...the best part was the staff. I can't thank them enough for being so attentive and accommodating. The location was perfect, close to everything. The room was wonderful, the prices were reasonable for the location, and I just loved everything about it. Will stay there again!"}
{"text":"Stayed here while in Montreal on business. The hotel is centrally located downtown and within walking distance to the business district as well as many restaurants and shops. This was critical for this trip, and St. Martin served this purpose well.

The hotel is fairly modern and very clean. The room was larger than average and the beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was extremely nice and the shower was one of those see through walls that can be viewed from the bed. 

The only complaint I have is that the walls were very thin. There was a point in the night where I could hear every word of conversation from the people next door. I was on the brink of complaining, but managed to fall asleep as I had a long day coming up.

Overall, this was a really nice hotel and I had a great stay, minus the noise through the walls. The location is a huge draw and should definitely be considered for anyone who needs to be in the downtown area."}
{"text":"I am smitten with this hotel!  It takes me around a hundred hours of browsing hotel reviews and making sure the one I choose is priced well, clean, safe, and quiet - before I click purchase.  

The reviews for Le St. Martin were consistently strong throughout every review and travel site, and now I know for myself, exactly why.

First off, I got a fantastic deal through hotels.com, and used a coupon code from retailmenot for an additional 10% off.  

Second, this hotel is in an excellent location if you are visiting Montreal and want to see all of the main attractions.  If not within decent walking distance, you can hop on the Peel Station metro (which is literally, a skip away..   One block down, but the block is SMALL and extremely safe), and it gives you the green line which takes you to other stations if you need to get on the Orange line..  and that is only a few metro stops itself) - or take the bus from the corner of Maisonneuve and McGill.  Rue McGill is a block down.  

From the airport, you can the 747 bus that drops you off a couple of blocks south of Maisonneuve, on the corner of Rene Levesque and Peel.  It's the same way back to the airport.  You can purchase a daily metro card from the airport for $7 (or was it $8?), and you're good for 24 hours from the moment you scan it on the bus.  I ended up buying a 3 day pass later on, but that's another story.  Anyway, it's about a 25 min or so ride to/from the airport, and both times I was around rush hour.  

When you arrive in the hotel lobby, you're greeted by very welcoming bell hops and reception desk.  It's a small lobby, but very pristine, and there's a fireplace to the corner - and the bar/bistro behind.  I had no issues checking in.  I like that your room card/key is also what allows you to click on your floor level whilst on the elevator.  For example, if you are on the 10th floor, you swipe your key/card and then the \"10\" will activate if you click it.  No other floor will.  An excellent addition to safety.

I had paid in full prior to arriving, so it was a simple few moments and I was off to my room.  The hallways have speakers/music which is quite nice during the day, but it's on 24 hours.  I'd suggest they turn it off between 11pm and 6am, because it can slightly be heard in the room, especially if it's a song with strong instrumentals! :)  I'm a light sleeper, so this probably wouldn't concern others much.

You walk into the room, and greeted with a decent amount of walking space, an immaculately clean and modern bathroom (granite countertop, a wood vanity with open shelving underneath, a large shower, and overall a very spacious bathroom).  The shower has wooden blinds on the other side of the glass, leading towards the bedroom itself, and they can be shut for privacy if need be.  I was on my own and so there was not any matter over that.  They provide you with lots of fresh towels, and also a bath robe and bath slippers in the closet!  The toiletries they provide are from Italy.  I did not ever hear of the brand, but the bar soaps smell nice.  The rest are a tad strong/masculine.

The bedroom itself is spacious, and I had a nice view of Maisonneuve, although I was high up (which I wanted).  My room was with one king bed and perfectly wide and comfortable.  The only issue for me was that something in the room or from the springs in the bed, made a light clicking noise all night.  Actually the other issue was that the bed was not 100% comfortable.  Don't get me wrong, it's a new and clean bed, but not the best sleep I've had in a hotel.  The pillows are abundant, and I believe they could be down-filled, as they sounded a bit crunchy.  You get four pillows with the King, two standard and two long ones.  Again, not the most comfy, but that's just my own preference, because the quality seemed great.  

The room also has a work desk and chair, and it's extremely convenient that the outlet for the power cord, and everything else, is in a compartment *on* the desk, rather than under the desk against the wall.

They leave you with two complimentary water bottles on your bedside table.  The wine and everything else in plain view, has a fee.  The TV is an LCD, although I probably only turned it on once for the weather.  

For those who may want this information: There is a floor to length mirror, a closet with hangers, iron/board, hairdryer, soaps, shampoo, conditioner, lotion, shower cap, Keurig coffee machine and coffee, bath robe, slippers, towels galore, great pressure showerhead (stand up shower, not a bathtub in this room), black-out curtains, water, and oh.. FREE WIFI!  That is always a plus, as not all hotels will offer this.  It's also very easy to connect to.  It requires two pieces of simple information and you're logged in for 24 hours and just need to re-login each day of your stay. 

Service:  You won't find better!  Daily housekeeping and meticulously clean.  Staying here again, for sure!"}
{"text":"What a gorgeous hotel! 

I'll admit it, I usually skimp when it comes to hotel accommodations while on vacation. My thinking that if I am on vaycay, I am going to spend the least amount of time possible up in my room. I don't know if I could go back to that frame of thought though after staying at such an upscale hotel. 

Le St-Martin is beautiful on the inside and out. The crackling fireplace was always going, warming up the luxurious lobby where leather couches welcomed you to take a load off from a day of pounding the pavement. Chandeliers and a spiral staircase add touches of elegance ti this 5 star hotel.

The staff was always friendly and willing to help give directions or recommendations. Each member being professional and affable our entire stay. 

The rooms were glorious! The decor was sophisticated and cozy, and the beds were decked out with the plushy, warm down comforters and pillows that made nap time an everyday must. Even the basic room had a huge whirlpool tub and double sinks, perfect for two girls! The room had a Keurig coffee maker, but lacked any creme or sugar. However, if you happen to be in your room later in the afternoon, someone will come knocking on your door to offer you tea or coffee and you can always request the proper accouterments from reception if need be. 

Free wifi is a great added plus, as is the close proximity to the Metro Station (Peel or McGill). Le St-Martin Hotel is right in the heart of activity, close to shopping and downtown and great bars and restaurants. 

The gym is small, only one tredmill, one eliptical and one bike.. but heck, who wants to work out on vacation anyway?! The pool is also very small, as is the space, so if you are looking for a summertime hotel where a hit or miss is the availability to lounge by a pool, this might not be your spot. 

Late checkout is an added fee, but they are willing to hold your bags for you at no cost if you have time left to explore the city before departing. 

Highly recommended for couples looking for a romantic spot, friends on the get-away or a business traveler. I'd say not the best family spot or hotel for kids."}
{"text":"What a great place! 

Exceptionally clean. Beautiful décor. Helpful staff. Great location.  

And an outdoor heated pool!!!

Did I expect 25-40 degree Fahrenheit weather in Montreal during the first week of April?  No, I did not.  Did that keep me from going in an outdoor pool?  No, it did not.  Let me explain....  The hotel pool was open two hours in the morning and two hours in the evening. The pool is a magical little oasis surrounded by taller buildings and has a cute little bridge going over it. The pool is heated to a very warm temperature and you can see a layer of steam coming off the pool in cold weather.  It is a wonderful experience as long as you keep your head dry and when you finally get out of the pool, you dry off as quickly as possible and get back inside.

I really enjoyed my stay.  If I am ever back in Montreal, this is the place I will stay.  Also, don't be afraid to take one of the free apples in the bowl near the elevators or in the lobby.  They are for the guests to enjoy!


One last thing...
Pourquoi ne pas avoir du savon et du shampoing en provenance de France plutôt que de la Chine?"}
{"text":"I had an excellent stay here.  The front desk speak both French and English and are very helpful.  The hotel is close to the metro and in the middle of town.  They have a cart that comes to your room in the late afternoon with lots of free goodies!!!!  The pool and gym are small.  The gym only has one treadmill, one bicycle, and one elliptical.  At least that was free.  They should have made the pool a water fountain instead.  At least you can hang out there and have your snack and/or drinks.  It was kind of annoying you had to go to one floor to get your ice.  It is also cool there are lots of places you can walk to."}
{"text":"Fantastic 2-night stay. Nice, clean hotel in a great location downtown, right by a Métro station.

The room was beautiful and spacious, great shower and tub. Super comfortable bed. I wish the door to the corridor blocked more noise though, since I woke up both days by the sound of my neighbors' door.

Special mention to Lucie at the lobby for her exceptionally courteous and friendly service."}
