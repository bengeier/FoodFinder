{"text":"Went there for dinner recently.  Very accommodating staff from the hostesses, the bussers, the wait staff, the bartenders.  Everyone was enthusiastic and very polite.  The food was excellent and the environment couldn't have been more perfect.  Excellent place for dinner regardless of occasion."}
{"text":"If you accept the fact that this restaurant is extremely high end for steak houses (price-wise) then you can just sit back and enjoy the experience because the food here is fantastic.  Service is also wonderful but the food here is simply awesome. I had the 12oz filet mignon and asked for medium rare to rare (to which the waitress advised me they have a medium rare plus or something like that which is what I want) and it was beautiful how perfectly this was cooked. My mouth is watering just thinking about it!!!!!!!  For sides we had several including the potatoes au gratin and cauliflower au gratin (I actually preferred the cauliflower) but both were fantastic."}
{"text":"At this price range, I expect a lot: Great food and great service. The atmosphere is swank for a steakhouse and what I got was VERY GOOD overall. First, we made an 8pm reservation via OpenTable for a Saturday night. We got seated about 20-30 mins late...no big deal, we weren't in hurry. After a round at the bar we sat down. The waiter was very professional and courteous, though he just took our order, checked on us and served drinks. Others actually served us our food and cleared our plates. I thought he was a touch arrogant in his opinions on the food. When I asked if they offered any special rubs, he replied they only offer the house rub. OK, but another at the table likes spice and asked for jalapeños, the waiter replied they have none...but our calamari and shrimp appetizer showed up with jalapeños... Go figure. The shrimp and calamari was very lightly crusted and fried...excellent. Next we shared the Alaskan King Crab legs...AMAZING!  Also amazing was the FRESH bread. The salad was tasty, but too drenched in dressing. The bone-in ribeye was on the rare side if medium-rare and delicious, but the rub was nothing special. The creamed spinach and brussell sprout sides were tasty!  Mashed potatoes, well whipped, but wanting flavor. The molten chocolate cake with ice cream was huge!  Enough for 4. I'd recommend this place for special occasions and over-the-top business dinners. Enjoy."}
{"text":"After my second dinner at Dominicks I have found I was truly disappointed in the food and more so in the strange aroma that permeates the building.    The positives: The opalescence demonstrated through hard woods, crystal chandeliers, water features is common to high end steak houses.  The negatives: The steaks were mediocre and nothing on the menu has left me \"needing\" to go back.  Then there is this terrible smell of \"feet\" that hits you just as you walk into the bar area. Just not acceptable if you want to attract patrons.  It does appear to be a hub for the seniors in our community and with the close of Marco Polo they now have a place to call home."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a \"FABULOUS\" dinner  at DOMINICKS last night! Great Happy Hour prices in the beautiful lounge! Dinner upstairs \"rooftop\" was SUPERB! Our entree (Ribeye Steak) to die for, cocktails great, dessert delish! Impeccable service from the moment we walked in. Complimentary valet a great touch. 5 Star! However... Turn off the Tv's especially rooftop!!!! The loud 50/60's music...NOT appropriate for such beautiful ambiance! Bring the baby grand piano back PLEASE!!!"}
{"text":"I would not choose this steak house if you are in the area.  Me and two friends went a couple of weeks ago and they burnt my steak.  A Chef should know how to cook a steak no matter how it is ordered.  I get embarrassed to send it back, so I just asked for steak sauce and dealt with it.  There are just too many other great steak restaurants here to waste your money at this one, and I think they even charge more here. I go out monthly with Vendors and would never refer them to this place."}
{"text":"Wonderful meal and service. I would have given it 5 stars but they don't allow patrons to bring in our own wine. I guess this is a state issue but still Disappointing. We both had none in Filets. They were the bomb!"}
{"text":"Went Friday night for happy hour. And meet up with friends. There was 7 of us. All drinking and eating. Not sure if it was our server or the bar but it took at times 30 mins to get a drink delivered after ordering it. I think even for happy hour to wait that long is crazy. Plus how do they plan on making money if it takes that long to get a drink. Dominick  'S is one of my favorite places. But was a little disappointed last night."}
{"text":"Mediocre. And I'm being nice. Overpriced for steaks that you can get elsewhere. Meat was grizzly. Their 'special' Veal Parm was disgraceful. Save some money. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Being a frequent diner at this great establishment (great Happy Hour specials!) I generally know what to expect. The top shelf Management team is always there to greet you, check in, and maintain a high level of quality. Our waiter, Chad, however, must have missed the  Dominick's  memo. Our family table (specifically requested to be upstairs) of 9 folks were taken care of by Chad in a manner more suited for someone who wished he was anywhere but delivering the fine, memorable dining experience I've come to expect. It was almost as if he was tuned out and disinterested  the entire evening. No emphasis on making it a pleasant dining experience for anyone in our party, that's for sure. It was too bad that my family had an incredible meal that was left unnecessarily bitter by the apathetic service of one waiter. Dominick's (and my family) deserved better."}
{"text":"OK so mixed feelings about this place.  First off, the ambience and appearance of the restaurant is beautiful and classy but not pretentious.  THE BAR!!! wow... really pretty display of the bottles all the way up to the ceiling.  Sat at the bar first, service was great.  This place is PRICEY! I mean I knew it was higher-end, and I GLADLY will pay a high price for a great meal any day.  But $18 for a martini?? whoa... I got one martini, my date got 2 and we shared a Charcuterie platter.  Total bill was $77.   Then we sat down for dinner.  Our server was outstanding.  The service in general right across the board I felt was top notch.  Also they have a really nice wine list and the server seemed knowledgeable about the wines that weren't even on the menu which we got a bottle of.  We ordered prawns and lobster for appetizers... the lobster was ok, the prawns were HUGE wow!  No complaints there.  Served with butter, cocktail sauce, atomic horseradish and a mustard sauce.  I ordered the short rib for dinner.  Very salty and on the fatty side.  Super rich.... and it's so dark in there its hard to even see what's on your plate.  For sides we got the lobster mashed potatoes and the Brussel sprouts.  Both were meh. Nothing spectacular.    For dessert we got the crème brulee which was fantastic, we ate it all.  And a smore dessert, super sweet and rich but good.  they blow torch the marshmallow topping right at the table which I thought was a fun touch.  Overall it was bot a bad experience, I just didn't feel the food was necessarily worth the price.... but I will definitely go back and give them another try!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed dinner here earlier this week and was blown away!  When we walked in we were greeted with a smile. The decor and ambiance were spectacular!   For our meal we shared a variety of items including the mac n cheese, onion straws and the 16 ounce NY Strip...So delicious!!  Great service, all of our needs were anticipated. I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"The ambiance of the restaurant was very nice. We dined on a Sunday evening, so the pool side dining wasn't an option. Our steaks and the rest of our food was great. We are treated very well by the staff for our wedding anniversary."}
{"text":"The faux quintessential atmosphere is not reminiscent of any quality restaurant I have visited in New York, or any quality restaurant throughout the world; with, perhaps, the noted exception of Russia - if you made a wrong turn.  The quality of the product and temperatures of the protiens were impeccable, spoiled by an over abundance of seasoning; cheesey potatoes were exactly that - uninspiring.  Salads & Deserts were fine.  Server cute/nice,  not particularly well trained.  Not what someone would expect from a 5 Star restaurant or the Mastro family."}
{"text":"Went in on a Friday at about nine for a quick bite to eat. Far underdressed but I was welcomed warmly. Looked for a seat in the bar but it was jam packed, standing room only. Fortunately ran into some friends who let me sit at their table. Was greeted by a server after a few minutes and brought back drink and food menu. Ordered a la Paloma, NY strip medium and broccoli . I was promptly brought my drink, water and silverware. After just the right time my food was brought to me. I enjoyed my steak but my only negative was the plate it was brought on. The plate was so hot the moment it was set in front of me I could feel the heat radiating off of it. I did not enjoy eating my meal while sweating from the heat of the plate and being in fear of burning myself with any accidental touching of it. Not long after that some more friends showed up and we had a very nice 2005 Napa Cab. I didn't browse their wine list but if I do go back I am curious to what they have. Overall it was a nice experience, but I'm not sure I'll be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere but steak was mediocre at best. Everyone's steak were done incorrectly. People that ordered medium, the steak was barely pink and others that ordered medium plus, the steak was bloody rare. Besides it not being cooked well the cut of steak did not compare to other steak houses in the phx area."}
{"text":"I had been looking forward to dining here for some time.  I liked the bar alot but once we sat down for dinner things didn't go so well.  I had one of the fish, I forgot which one, that came with a lemon sauce.  It was tasteless.  They were very nice and I sent it back and got the Veal Piccata.  It wasn't good at all.  The veal was more 4 thin McDonald's hamburger patties and had no flavor.  It wasn't just me, I had 3 others at the table try the dishes.  One of my guests had the Artic Char and it was nice.  The other person had a steak and it wasn't cooked properly so he sent it back at which time it came back fine.  Overall, not impressed.  I'll go back to the bar for a cocktail, I won't try the food again."}
{"text":"This place is really good.  The ambience is awesome and so is the food.  If your willing to deal with the Scottsdale wanna be crowd, this is restaurant that won't disappoint.  Ask to dine upstairs.  The natural light has an appeal in this up scale restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great ambiance, reasonable prices and phenomenal service!  Thank you Mariah for making our anniversary dinner and trip to Scottsdale wonderful.  Mariah went out of her way to check on public transportation to and from the Diamondback game for us (which was so unexpected and refreshing) and went out of her way to personalize a special dessert for us for our anniversary based on my diet restrictions.    We will definitely be back to this restaurant upon a return visit to Scottsdale."}
{"text":"We went here to celebrate getting a new part time job.  We reserved a table pool-side (on the roof).  The atmosphere on the roof (once they opened it) was really nice-and our table was right next to the pool.    The appetizers (Shrimp Dominick and Fried Meatballs) were very good.  We ordered steaks.  My wife ordered the filet-medium.  I ordered the bone-in ribeye.   Her filet was very good (not the best we've ever had, but OK)  My ribeye (for just under $50) was the worst ribeye I have ever had.  It was dry (if you can imagine a ribeye being dry). And instead of nice marbling, gristle seemed to rule in may spots.   I've had better ribeyes at home that we bought at Albertsons.  I didn't complain at the restaurant, although they asked often how everything  was.  Maybe I should have--but I didn't want to make a scene, and I didn't want to wait for any kind  of correction. But my experience with the ribeye caused us to say--this is a \"one and done\" restaurant.  Way too many other good steakhouses to spend this kind of money (total bill was $240 with tip).    In fact, the best ribeye I've had in a restaurant lately was at Longhorn Steakhouse--and it was \"only\" $25.  It beat Dominicks ribeye hands down."}
{"text":"What an experience!!! I was taken on a double date here a couple weeks ago. Everything was amazing and I was not disappointed. I really like how the sides are served family style so you can try a little of everything if you go with a big group. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"so disappointed. I tried this place one of family member recomended.  I had Filet and beef was good but salty salty salty everything. Service was soso. The waiter pretend to be friendly however didn't ask how I liked the food after serve either. He was just ignorant all the time.  I won't go this place again. ruined my bd dinner so much."}
{"text":"Overall good but prefer other nearby steakhouses...We started with the crispy shrimp which had the just the right amount of spiciness; shrimp were moist and cooked amazingly.   We were brought some garlic rolls that were initially tasty but after 10 minutes got hard and tough.  The Caesar salad had too much grated parmesan that overpowered the wilted lettuce.  I am not sure if the lettuce was already wilted or the amount of cheese wilted the lettuce. I would have liked to see sliced parm instead.  The mashed potatoes looked like a kids slime project as they were super gluey and sticky. The brussel sprouts were cooked to perfection with large chunks of bacon.  The NY steak was cooked as ordered and was very succulent and melt in your mouth delicious.  Our waitress was very nice but the several people who delivered the other items (water, bread, sides, dessert) were not friendly, no smile/stoic, and literally slammed down the plates of food on the table and left.  They all seemed very robotic; actually a robot would probably have been friendlier.  We went on a Tuesday and the restaurant was crowded.  There seemed to be a lack of wait staff.  We were waiting 10 minutes for our check because our waitress was busy serving a table of 8 each of their sides.  She seemed like she had all the upstairs tables with no real assistance.   All in all this is a good steakhouse but the service at others is much better.  With so many similar places nearby and paying a premium for the experience, I would expect better service."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to visit in Scottsdale! My birthday was extra special we had in as the bartender he came out and bought a birthday cake with a candle on it to celebrate my birthday. Thanks to Ian for making it a extra special day!"}
{"text":"I took my son to Dominick's tonight to celebrate his pending college graduation and new job. Unfortunately what we found was poor quality meat and an indifferent wait staff and management.  My son had the $57 12 oz filet mignon which was riddled with inedible veins of tough sinewy cartilage about halfway through. Unusual for a restaurant that hand cuts its meat, but mistakes can happen. We let our server know and Rebecca quickly explained it was a \"fat cap\" and, well, the chef can't know what's inside.  Would we care for a free dessert? We declined and asked to speak to the manager. He or she would not come over and instead removed a $7 beer from our tab as the remedy for an inedible steak. Of course most restaurants of this purported caliber immediately prepare a new steak and remove it from the tab altogether. We simply wanted them to remove half the cost since half was inedible. Drop in quality and concern are always the telltale signs of a restaurant on its way out.  Don't reward this behavior with your patronage. There are several other steakhouses in the area still trying hard."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to try this establishment tonight.  I have to say, I loved it.  Yes, there were 3 pr 4 young ladies waiting at the door. That made seating us flow smoothly. The decor was beautifully done, perfect for a steakhouse.   I had one of the best dirty martinis I've ever had.  The bread was good, loved the bread sticks. My spinach salad was perfect, all the flavors blended so nicely.  I had steak, done to perfection. I loved the clarified butter on the steak. The side order of creamed corn was enormous and tasted like fresh off the cob.   Dessert of caramel cake was sublime! Not for the faint of pocketbook as it was very spendy, but great place and nice addition to Scottsdale dining."}
{"text":"Wow! If you think Ruth's Chris on steroids then this place is much better. Similar 1000 degree plate thing but the steaks are tender and cooked to perfection. The sides were delicious. The pre-bread serving just awesome. The server, she was great. A little on the $$$ side but well worth each 10 dollar bill."}
{"text":"Lovely decor, wonderful meal! The filet Mignon was the best I've ever had and the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Took my wife here for Valentine's Day and had a wonderful night . The atmosphere was excellent and the food was top notch. Nick was our server and he dazzled us with great service . I highly recommend this steakhouse"}
{"text":"Can only comment on the bar area which was great! Chris was friendly and fun! We will go back to try out dinner....to be continued."}
{"text":"Went to Dominick's on a Monday night with my husband because we had heard great things about the place. The place was beautiful, however, the upstairs was closed, which is where we requested to sit when we made reservations. The service was good and our waiter was really friendly and was very knowledgable on the menu. The food was good, but wasn't great, which was a disappointment because it's a very nice and expensive restaurant. The music wasn't that great either. They were playing new pop hits and I would have much preferred something more classical for an upscale restaurant. The music didn't match the ambiance."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, excellent food.  Great service too.  Props to Dan.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"We went here for Mother's Day.  We took our 3 kids (13, 11, 6).  They were great and enjoyed the food.  It was our second time eating here.  I was very excited to go back, because the first visit was amazing!  This time we sat upstairs where the roof opened after the sun went down enough to not bother anyone.  It was beautiful!  The food was outstanding!  I ordered bone-in filet medium with truffle butter, creamed spinach, creme brûlée corn & lobster mashed potatoes. The sides are all served for sharing.  Even the truffle butter was served on the side with enough for 3 of us to share.  We had the strawberry butter cake for dessert which was wonderful!  It is pricey, but for a special occasion, completely worth it!  I can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Terrible service ho hum food. Was with a big group last week for a celebration. My seat mate ordered a specific cut of beef. They brought the wrong one but insisted that was what she ordered. After a couple go arounds they plopped the plate of the wrong order in front of her. They had worn her down. Unacceptable.   Then when desert came she asked for a spoon. The server pointed to a spoon that was closer to the next diner and said that was hers. After another go around she said she wanted a different spoon. Unacceptable.   I ordered lobster that was so over salted I couldn't taste the seafood. And when my desert came there were no spoons left on the table!  Ridiculous for any restaurant particularly one as pricy as this. The customer is not right here."}
{"text":"A very swanky place, they have red carpet at the door way!!  As it was the last week to have my dad in town, we decided to try this always-have-fancy-cars (Aston Martin, anyone?) parked outside steakhouse. It was not busy at 6:30 on a Thursday night, we both felt the restaurant is too dark and too loud!  Food was delicious! Medium rare filet was juicy and nicely cooked, the steamed asparagus on the side was very fresh, and the Alaskan king crab legs, wow, a lot of them and very salty!  While we enjoyed the food, served with excellent service, we just felt like it was missing something, but can't really describe to detail. Personally, I just didn't really get the outside to be all so fancy swanky, but no peace to be found anywhere inside, and what's up with the metal-ish decor?  I will just say, yeah, I tried, for a better quality of food and price, I would much prefer J&G."}
{"text":"We have been to Dominick's steakhouse a couple times now and it's always consistent.  The steaks are the best, I always get the filet and its melt in you mouth tasty!!  The Alaskan king crab is fabulous and hugh portion!  Everything on the meal is a good choice, hats off to the chef!!  The service is excellent and the atmosphere is very elegant.  Definitely one of our favorite restaurants, by far!."}
{"text":"food was awesone, service good, ambiance elegant.  But as a 5 star restaurant they failed miserably to my first time there.  One thing alone made me feel inadequate and taken advantage of by the corporate evils.  It may seem innocent or even incidental, both here is how I sew it....  6 of us spent $700 total. just after and even during the meal serving,  i made aware to the waitress that we dis not receive a side item. She asked me if she could bring it or take off of bill. I said take off of bill. When thr bill came an hour later,  we paid.  Then i noticed that the $9 side item was still on bill and we paid for it. Again I told waitress about this. She came back and put $9 on the table where 6 people just got finished paying $700.  who gives a crap about $9 cash between 6 people??  sheeesh after the heads up I gave the waitress, I would expect a different customer service tactic. What do u think?"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE!   Pretentious, over-priced, poor quality food, terrible service.  Complete waste of money.    When I went with three friends the other night - we were greeted by no fewer than six people at the front.  The \"manager's\" are walking around this Mastro's copy... with earpieces like they are at some fancy club in NYC or Vegas.  They are useless.  We waited almost an hour to place our order.  The food and service would have been better at ANY Chipotle Grill.    Also... the music!!  Hello??  80's rock with lyrics in a fine dining room?    Do NOT GO!!  Atrocious!!"}
{"text":"When I walked threw the door, the hostess looked at me up & down. I felt uncomfortable, she led us to our table, with a cracked smile. Im a travel nurse, so I've been to most of the best eateries around the country!  The food was mediocre ! The twice baked potatoes? with gouda was hard as a brick. It was good, up until you got to 1 inch around the skin of the potatoes?. Just hard. The scallops was ok, nothing but extra butter & a lemon. My date said his salmon had a stick of butter melted on top & no other seasoning. When people spend $200 on meal, they expect art! I mean, my soul should be uplifted, I should gain something from the experience. Not here!  Just typical American business as usual. Low quality, but great advertisement! Blah blah blah...i don't want to hear....\" this is a steak house\" everything on your menu should be superb & fine quality\" \" Where are the Gods? ...not here!\" \" where is art...not here! \""}
{"text":"Was okay. Not living up to the hype. Steak we asked for was medium well, came out bleeding rare! Then after I bit into it they took it back and cooked the same steak to bring back. Guess that $10 you lose if you make a new steak would really hurt ya! Cheap , cheap, cheap! Felt like I was at a chilis. Once they re-did it, everything was great! But that was about 45 minutes later. Next time get it right, this is scottsdale! Not the slum! Scottsdale we don't tolerate mediocre! Only the best :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I just celebrated our 2 year anniversary here tonight.  The bread basket was amazing!  Husband had the 20 oz Rib Eye (bone in) and I had the Chilean Sea Bass with bread crumbs.  Both were perfect.  Their signature scaloped potatoes were mouth watering as was their asparagus.  We shared the vanilla Creme Brule and that too was divine.  We've both enjoyed other restaurants around the valley and beyond and this has just toped our list. The ambiance was so chic.  I'm glad we got to dine on the roof top by the fire and pool.  The service...the staff, waiter, servers...everyone was very kind and hospitable.  We are already looking forward to another great dining experience.  Thank you for opening here in Scottsdale.  This city would be happy to keep this gem hidden, but based on our experience and the packed tables, Dominic's is sure to do VERY well in other states.    Best of luck on expanding to other locations.  My only request is adding a Lobster Bisque to your menu.  Cheers!   J&J"}
{"text":"This place has slipped significantly.   Usually a spot where my family celebrates birthdays and I entertain clients regularly.   My bone in filet was I under-seasoned and they must be using a new meat supplier because my cut of meat was very chewy.   Waitress was very pushy on the up-sells to entrees. On top of that, she seemed to be trying to push us out of restaurant while neglecting us with a very empty restaurant.   Normally I receive top notch service from this establishment but not sure what has been going on.  The usual highlight of the birthday meal is the beignet tree presentation. This has been replaced with a much smaller \"world famous\" butter cake that is nowhere near Mastro's actual world famous butter cake. It was a much smaller dessert which makes me think this place is suffering from low traffic which I completely understand now.   I can only hope Steak 44 their sister restaurant has held up, as it is preferred."}
{"text":"Went with my wife for our anniversary and we both had steak. Probably the best steak we've had in years! We ate upstairs on the roof, it was quite romantic. They had a shallow pool in the middle with floating candles and flower petals, the roof even opened up to show the stars and night sky. Was very classy. A tad but dark though, I couldn't see very well at first."}
{"text":"Had Friday night at 7:30 reservations, and everything was ready for us when we arrived.  Place was packed!  Server Jeff was excellent, and all of the staff were professional and prompt, which is what you want and expect when spending $53 for a steak!  My wife and I each had a cocktail, and the pours were excellent.  The martini actually is almost 2 martinis.  The wine list had an excellent selection of quality wines in the $50-$75 range....sometimes hard to find in restaurants of this caliber.  The Duckhorn Pinto was excellent, as was the price at $51.  Appetizers....both the Jumbo Shrimp and the Blue Point Oysters were perfect.  Wife ordered Filet, I ordered bone in NY....both medium rare and cooked just as ordered.  Split the sides....creamed spinach and half fries/half onion strings....wonderful.  Since we noted on our reservation that this was a special occasion....17th wedding anniversary, they served a great chocolate cake with Happy Anniversary on it, and it was also excellent.  Everything was $260 plus tip, and was well worth it.  5 stars....they deserve it!"}
{"text":"The steaks were great - we had filet mignon and ribeye - well seasoned and cooked perfectly.  That said, the steak tartare lacked any flavor and the signature lobster gnocchi side was really overcooked and heavy.  The smores cake tasted liked a chain restaurant dessert.  But the entire experience was ruined by the duo singing/playing in the bar.  The noise level was extreme throughout the restaurant-  a woman at the next table was literally yelling to be heard and so we were (unfortunately) privvy to her entire conversation.  We could not relax and enjoy our own conversation, and the band very bad so it was not even a pleasure to listen."}
{"text":"the Scottsdale food scene is full of the the newest trendy hot spots.  Razz's is a refreshing solid workhorse that will not disappoint.  Very professionally run establishment with top notch friendly efficient staff. Plus top notch menu prepared by the very warm and gregarious chef/owner.  His attitude is contagious and permeates with the staff.  Delicious different menu items make this an extremely solid venue for any major city."}
{"text":"Went to Dominick's with a friend last weekend, and wondered why I had waited so long! Very fine, upscale dining. Excellent food and a very professional staff. They even followed up with a phone call the next morning to ensure we enjoyed our dining experience. My only complaint is we walked away too full :) It is very rare to find a true \"fine dining\" place, even though they all claim to be. I will definitely go back, and hopefully this time with a date. The atmosphere is low-lights, classy, and romantic."}
{"text":"Didn't get service tonight for having a paper government state Id, I talked to the manger and he was no help, I've been served here many times before"}
{"text":"Ambience= 9/10 Reaching the table=4. Had to wait to maneuver through a maze of tables at the bar Waiter=5. Never smiled. Didn't seem interested. Thought he was in Paris or something Appetizers=5. Stone crab was rotten. Salads Ocean Club wannabes.  Entrees=6. Everything was dripping in butter and salt. Head chef definitely is simple minded, put more butter and salt when in doubt. Bone-in-filet was inedible. Lobster was not fresh, completely chewy. Veal was chewy. Side dishes=2. Gnocchi was disgusting! Where was the lobster in it? Veggies could have been done better.  Dessert=6 better than rest of meal but completely forgetful.   Overall, for dropping about a thousand dollars I thought I could have had a better meal just about anywhere else. This place is hip, but won't last in that location unless they upgrade their food and service. Ocean club, City Hall, and Capital Grill are all better."}
{"text":"Amazing steakhouse with great service.  Good atmosphere and drinks.  Pricey but worth it if you're looking for a good night out.  Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"With all the hype, I was so hesitant to even go within a mile of Dominick's until a girlfriend from the East Coast here on a two-day trip made it there before me! Glad that I had a real foodie give me her honest opinion before I ventured through the door on a Saturday evening. My hopes were high, my expectations realistic.  Random thoughts I jotted down in my notes section of my iPhone . . . the decor is dazzling with its crystal chandeliers which are much less pretentious than I had imagined. They need to fix the chandelier in the dining room adjacent to the bar, separated by the glass panel . . . it's crooked and with my OCD, it drove me crazy. Watch the floor and steps, the hallway leading to the bathroom downstairs slants, the steps leading up to the third floor pool bar and dining are a disaster waiting to happen with patrons going up and down at the same time servers are carrying large trays . . . seriously in need of some dumb waiters. The live music was a great accompaniment for the setting and not intrusive at all. In fact, the female vocalist had a lovely smoky, jazzy voice which was quite enjoyable. Mr. Piano Player . . . Please skip the Neil Diamond ballads. The bar was definitely the scene. I have never seen so many bleached blondes in platform heels all in one place. Gentleman wearing the baseball caps . . . not proper attire, even in the bar!  Getting down to the nitty gritty . . . our server J. Lee was fantastic! I have read some other Yelpers opinions of the service, including that of my foodie friend, and had some concerns, but J. Lee was totally on the ball. I wouldn't hesitate to ask to be seated in her section whenever she is working.  The food . . .   Reminder to self . . . easy on the bread if you want to eat your entree and sides and maybe save room for a bit of dessert. The bread basket offers something for everyone, and then some. The stick-thin breadsticks, the fig bread, the onion focaccia . . . incredibly delicious. We had oysters on the half-shell, six Blue Points that finished beautifully, accompanied by cocktail sauce, a tartar like sauce and \"atomic\" horseradish. We also split a spinach salad with warm bacon dressing. (I had heard that they don't split salads, but this wasn't the case for us. In fact, they gave us two plates with dressing on the side.) Nice, nothing fancy.  My hubby ordered the chef's cut filet, his daughter the petit filet, and for myself, the Chilean Sea Bass Spiedini syle.  The filets were cooked rare per our request. Totally awesome . . . melted in our mouths. The Chilean Sea Bass was huge . . . it, too, cooked to perfection with a light coating of gently seasoned bread crumbs. All main entrees were seasoned well . . . Everything is a la carte, so we ordered two sides, the Signature Au Gratin potatoes and the Creamed Spinach Spiedini. The portions are colossal! The potatoes were so creamy. The spinach was divine. We ate maybe a third of both, brought the rest home and polished them off this morning for breakfast. They were just as delicious! As it was my husband's daughter's birthday, which we had mentioned when we made our reservation, they offered her a dessert on the house. They brought her the flourless chocolate cake with a candle, Happy Birthday drizzled on the plate. She ate two bites, said she was in chocolate nirvana and had the rest packed up to go. Hubby ordered the Bananas Foster cake . . . OMG! What a sensual experience . . . and way too many calories, but heavenly.    Not big drinkers, we ordered a bottle of Duckhorn Migration Pinot Noir. Reasonably priced I'll admit for a swank restaurant. We also ordered coffee to accompany our dessert. It was the only negative . . . very bitter.  Our experience at Dominick's exceeded my realistic expectations, and then some. The service was attentive and spot on, the food was top-notch, and atmosphere purely Scottsdale. I was reminded of that as we walked across the street to our non-valet parked car . . . a gleaming white Rolls was pretentiously parked right in front . . ."}
{"text":"I live in Texas and travel extensively. This was the best steak I have ever eaten. And considering it was Suoerbowl weekend and the place was packed and the service and food were outstanding says something about this place. We had a large group in their private dining room. This room is also the best private dining room I have ever been."}
{"text":"Celebrated our 34th wedding anniversary along with our son and daughter-in-laws 1st wedding anniversary. Our party of six was seated at a beautifully decorated table that recognized each of our anniversaries. We all had a drink and ordered the spicy shrimp and calamari for appetizers. For our main course we ordered the bone-in veal chop, bone-in filet, New York strip, bone-in Kansis City strip and sea scallops. Our sides were au gratin potatoes and brussel sprouts with bacon. Everything was cooked to perfection and delicious. For dessert we were served two beautiful and tasty complimentary desserts. Our wait staff was headed by Ula. She and her team were appropriately attentive and made the entire evening a memorable experience we will not forget. Kudos!"}
{"text":"We went as a group of 6.The food was average, same level like other steak house in the area. The other thing about this restaurant  that we complained was the lighting.  It was way too  dark.  We had to use our cellular phone light to read the menu.  Later we had hard time to see the color of the food, it took the fun off the night  and I feel sorry for the friend who had to pay for the dinner."}
{"text":"Obviously a beautiful establishment.  And the food is certainly well prepared, although somewhat pricey. However, my one quip is that the staff is not as welcoming as they should be. And have felt a bit of condescension on more than one occasion. A hostess staff cannot judge a guest by their appearance. They should welcome everyone as if they are a guest at their home."}
{"text":"Amazing food and delightful staff!! Highly recommend this place! You will not leave hungry or unhappy. Bone in filet is a must and funnel cake dessert is delish!!"}
{"text":"Great service and atmosphere. Very polite workers and excellent food. Great for a date night!"}
{"text":"I thought this place was the most overrated steakhouse in the Scottsdale/Phoenix. The service was mediocre, the NY Strip had no flavor, and certainly was not aged like many of the other fine steakhouses in the Valley. The side dishes again were mediocre at best. For the $100 plus dollars we spent I feel very disappointed especially considering it was one of those \"special\" Birthdays."}
{"text":"Just returned from New Year's eve dinner. This place deeply embraced the highest level of mediocrity. The waiter was highly indifferent and not attentive at all. Once we got the food it was decent. The entire place was overrun by the lowest class tackiest loudest people I have  ever seen in my life. It was obviously a gathering place for all of the Irish Travelers who live in Chandler. Loud and obnoxious and bouncing between tables.   Over half an hour from seated to ordering.   Waiter making veiled comments because he believed we were out of town people. Translates into\"I'm giving you crap service because I expect to get stiffed\".  Table wobbles by 6 inches. Partially fixed once.  Then got worse. Why bother.   This food is easily obtainable at multiple generic steakhouses here in Scottsdale.  Without the hassle of bad service and the throngs of deeply low class loud people dressed like disco Dans with hookers.   Save the hassle. Go to Ruth's Chris, Mortons, J&G. This is just a huge ineptly run chain. Glaring fake managers at the entrance clearly ogling the bimbo parade. Disgusting.   Update.  We were invited back as guests of the management. The level of attention is overwhelming. The food was good. Not great. It's a steakhouse. Food should be exceptional. It's a fun restaurant for tourist to AZ."}
{"text":"Wow, great experience with the service and food at Dominick's!  Asked if they had jalapeño olives with a martini and they did not have them however the fabulous waiter (Sean) decided and made jalapeño olives!! Delicious  steak, Ahi and Scallops- fun atmosphere- the whole wait team was in point.  Very enjoyable! Above and beyond.  Thank you for a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"Elegant decor and excellent service. Our every need was met, and the food was absolutely delicious. Husband and I both had steaks which were the best we've ever had and the side dishes were amazing - snap peas were bright green, crispy, and tasty, and the hasselback potato was perfectly sliced and cooked- crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. We topped it off with the Chocolate molten cake with vanilla ice cream- which should be its own food group. Will definitely come back the next time we are in the area."}
{"text":"One of the best in Scottsdale.  They treat you like royalty!!!"}
{"text":"FANTASTIC as usual! Love this place. They know how to make a special occasion fun and delicious! Service was awesome and we HIGHLY recommend this restaurant! Filet Mignon Oscar style and Mac 'n Cheese with lot's of crab and shimp mixed in! It's to die for! Chef de Cuisine runs a tight kitchen. The wait staff was exceptional too! They were on top of their game! Great job everyone!"}
{"text":"This high end steak house made some hits and misses and falls short of the competition \"Eddy V's\".  The service was very good and mechanical, the wagoo steak was excellent but the appetizer and potato fell short.   The furniture was wobbly like they bought chairs for a home and were over used for industrial use."}
{"text":"Amazing restaurant. Food, service and ambiance is hands down my favorite steakhouse in Arizona. We celebrated a special anniversary and they were all about making our evening special and memorable."}
{"text":"Fell in love with this place the instant I walked in. We sat at the gorgeous bar and enjoyed the view of the chandelier-like towers of every single bottle imaginable. We ordered the mac&cheese which is to this day one of thee most outstanding mac&cheeses I'll ever consume! The bread selection that came with and the martinis we ordered were also incredible. I was in awe of the gorgeous upstairs that had tables surrounding a shallow pool,  dining poolside at a steak house?   Coolest idea, this place is all around awesome!"}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Scottsdale! A+ service, A+ food, A+ ambiance, A+ interiors.   You get a choice of black or white napkin. You get a choice of hot or cold plate for your steak. And there's a pool on the roof! What more could you ask for.   Steaks were deliciously prepared, perfectly cooked to order. Just enough choices for appetizers, entrees, sides, and desserts - not too many, not too few. Everything we ordered - wedge salad, calamari, filets, ribeyes, Dominick's scalloped potatoes, brussels with bacon (brussels are a little oversized and could be quartered/chopped), and beignets - were perfectly cooked and seasoned. Courses were well spaced but timely, service was excellent! Can't wait to go back, thanks again!"}
{"text":"This was our first time here and had requested a poolside table; however, I did not know the poolside availability was only on weekends. We were sat on a two top table in a side section, not the bar, which was perfect. We got the choice between a white or black napkin which was unique. Marcus was our server. He made our night memorable with great recommendations and patience with our questions.  We started off with individually priced Colossal Shrimps and Blue Point Oysters which both had great flavor. We followed up our appetizers with our entrees of Wagyu Petite (8oz) Filet Mignon for my girlfriend, and I had the Colorado Full Rack of Lamb. Both were delicious and melted in our mouths. The entrees were served on 500 degree plates , which Marcus told us would heat up our entrees so we ordered Medium-Rare in order to get Medium. We had asparagus fries and King Crab & Shrimp Potato's which was a special side recommended by Marcus which we would have licked off the plate if the plates weren't scorching. After the best meal we've had in a couple months, we finished off our dinner with the house warm vanilla caramel cake which was good, but not to my preference.  Overall, the whole experience was delightful and very satisfactory. Our lemon drop martini and margarita on the rocks were well balanced and refreshing as well. Thank you Marcus and we shall be back again!"}
{"text":"Have only been to Dominicks for cocktails but I was impressed by the bar menu and atmosphere.  Great selection of single malts, including Mac18 for $18 (by far the lowest price in town).  Food smelled amazing so I will definitely be back to try it.  Only complaint - can't a restaurant that spent $7m+ on TI's spend $10k on a website?  The 'Coming Soon' sign doesn't really cut it anymore."}
{"text":"TOURIST TRAP!!! Sorry to those that I know that work there but this is a place you go once and do not come back. Over priced, overly loud, and the product does not match the scene. We ordered wine by the glass and the waiter had to check the wine list to see what I had ordered. We ordered crab cakes and they came out in under a minute(sure sign of someones mistake sitting in the window waiting to be re-sold), and our steak was over cooked, however we couldn't even send it back due to lack of attention by our server. He checked back once during the meal and then again to see if we wanted dessert. The inside was poshly decorated and the dining room with the pool was very cool, but not enough to overcome the feeling of being lost in the shuffle. I hope Steak 44 has more to offer."}
{"text":"Another solid dining experience at Dominick's!  I've dine here several times and its slowly becoming my favorite steakhouse in all of Arizona.  The customer service always shines though and the food and ambiance is amazing.  So here's an updated review, everything was on point from the great customer service to the awesome food that we ordered.  So my wife and I made a reservation on Saturday Night at 6:30.  We arrived and were seated promptly.  The location of the tables wasn't the greatest, cause there are a lot of waiters running by and the bar was on the other side, which made it a little noisy.  Other than that, everything was fantastic.  Our server was Kevin, the guy was attentive and on it.  It seems they work as a team, cause every time my lemonade or water reached half full, they were on top of it!  Soon when we finished our dishes, they cleared it with the quickness.  Impressive service for sure.  So we ordered the prime meatballs, shared a super salad for appetizers.  Then we ordered the Heritage porkchop, and cluster of King Crab legs, and shared the corn and Dominick potatoes.  My wife likes her meat well done, so I \"imagined\" it was cooked to her liking, she said it was very good.  My crab legs were delicious.  They were split open with a side of lemon and clarified  butter.  I would hate to see what I looked like smashing those legs, they were so damn good.  Alaskan Red King Crab probably one of my favorite foods, and this cluster did not disappoint.  Overall, another solid experience, Dominick's is the real deal.  Right now, i would put them over Mastro's Ocean Club, which used to be my favorite.  I know Scottsdale is loaded with great steakhouses, but Dominick's is slowly separating themselves from the competition.  Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Great service! Love the ambience!!! We sat right next to the pool. Filet had great flavor! Hawaiian poke was good. Brussel sprouts were recommended by staff- didn't disappoint."}
{"text":"We have family in the area that loves this restaurant so we wanted to send them a nice gift for the holidays. We called and they directed us to their website where you were able to order and personalize the gift with a message. Their online process worked seamlessly. Perfect for someone who wishes to send a gift from afar.   5-stars for the ease and convenience of being able to purchase gift cards to this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is good (for the most part) but could not possibly be more expensive.  The salmon was the worst I have ever had in a restaurant.  I honestly think it had spoiled.  The problem with Dominick's is the service.  Our waiter was training a rookie and the classic corporate restaurant behavior was in full play.  Our waiter topped up two wine glasses (twice) in order to quickly empty the bottle and immediately start the used car salesman routine for selling another.  I watched the waiter top these glasses and the guests had not started drinking yet.  They were so full I am surprised he did not offer a straw.  Our entire table sat in silence watching this (and other) tacky corporate resturant routines while the trainee patiently (and politely) watched.  This is Scottsdale, I live here, and this behavior embarrasses me thinking that we have such \"B\" rate service staff in what is suppose to be in an affluent travel destination.  Dominick's needs a purge, send your staff back to a Tulsa TGI Friday's (where they might fit in) for re-training.  These waiters make top dollar so act like it.  Stop behaving like the guests have never been to a restaurant.    Besides the waiter and the salmon, the other food was pretty good but not worth the price.  The music was loud and not appropriate for the clientele / atmosphere.  If Dominick's is trying to be \"hip\" they are missing the market.  Most of the restaurant was filled with a 45-70 crowd.  The music was more for Millennials and drained the ambiance.  I might try Dominick's again another time but PHX/Scottsdale offers many choices in expensive steak houses."}
{"text":"Service is always on point! Our server Tina was fantastic, knowledgeable and personable, warm elegant atmosphere.  My friend and I thought as a joke try the fried deviled eggs as an appetizer and OMG they turned out to be fantastic! Rhode Island calamari and shrimp  was another good appetizer pretty standard tasting like at any steakhouse.  Amex arranged the Prime Meatballs to be sent to our table as another appetizer which was a surprise since we didn't order them, they were two huge meatballs filling and hearty okay flavor but not my favorite.  My friend had the bone in ribeye I wandered from my usual filet to try the crab cakes, they were so good and fresh,  we all split the double baked truffle potato with Gouda (incredible) and the mac and cheese (also fantastic) for dessert we had the beignets which came presented on a tree with fantastic rich sauces.  Left so full but already have reservations for next week."}
{"text":"Service is 4 stars. Food is also 4, but for the price it gets kicked down to 3. I've had better filets (and tastier sides) at competitor restaurants for a tad less $. I have no problem paying top dollar for five star food, but you can't joke a joker.  Add'l Con: Tables are so close together that it passes the 'intimate ambience' and enters the 'I'm way too close to the next table' zone. I actually enjoyed the dim, mellow  lighting, but it does make it hard to read the menu."}
{"text":"Amazing. Celebrated my 30th birthday here. Amazing food, service and atmosphere. Definition of the saying \"you get what you pay for\". I'll be back."}
{"text":"This was the second time I have chosen Dominick's to host a dinner with eight associates and this visit was as impressive as the first. The staff, lead by Brad, was attentive and anticipated all of our needs. His suggestions for appetizers was SPOT on...fried devil eggs, asparagus FF and pork belly...!  The steaks were the absolute bomb and could not have been tastier or cooked any more to our likings. Bone-in filet to Tomahawk rib eyes. Great 1.5L of Nickel & Nickel Cab and the evening was set. Will return here over and over as my schedule brings me back to Scottsdale area.!!"}
{"text":"We went last night for my birthday and it was excellent! the hostess staff left a little to be desired, bunch of young girls at the front desk that don't impress, weak for a high end restaurant. Once inside the service was great and the food was outstanding. I had the bone in Fillet and it was AMAZING, my girlfriend had the Arctic Char and it was great, we split a side of sautéed mushrooms that were very good and huge quantity and the drinks and dessert were great."}
{"text":"Four men on a holiday night out. We all agreed to stop in to enjoy happy hour at this fine establishment. What should we order with NO wives to direct us??? Not a one of us could make a choice from the appetizer menu. We agreed that one of everything was best.......and what a great decision it was. All of the boys were in heaven with all of the selections. There was some question when I ordered the fried hard boiled eggs. Much to our surprise, they were fantastic. Great appetizers and adult beverages made for a fantastic boys night out!"}
{"text":"This is an updated review to my previous post. General Manager Jeff contacted me personally to discuss the issues in the previous review.   Upon return to Dominick's for a second try, it did a complete 180. The restaurant was full yet spacious and waiters were exceptionally accommodating. The waiter Brad was extremely knowledgeable and was able to answer all questions regarding menu. He explained, suggested and gave us a little background on several items on then menu.   The Sauté shrimp appetizer was the perfect size for two people. A little kick to it, large and full of flavor. My guest simply said \"this is the best I've ever had\"  I ordered the sea scallops again which were delicious. The portion was perfect and seared to perfection.   My guest ordered the Chillian Sea bass and wow! I'm not a fish eater. I like shell fish and that's it. I do not like any fish but he assured me this would be different and Wow! This was just phenomenal. We added bread crumbs which gave it a bit of texture but it wasn't breaded. Very unique and definitely made a difference.   Three words ...Creme brûlée corn. Amazing!   We really enjoyed our dinner compared to our last visit. I will chalk that up to the PGA in town and it being extremely busy. I would definitely recommend Dominicks and will return."}
{"text":"My favorite steak in town. The bone in filet is to die for.  Haven't had anything but a flawless experience the 10+ times I have eaten here.  Reserve the pool side dining if you can."}
{"text":"Went to celebrate my 30th birthday and was looking forward to a great evening. Our waiter was rude and talked down to me like I was an idiot. Both of the steaks we ordered were cooked incorrectly. The food was mediocre at best. We won't be coming back and it wasn't worth even half of what we spent. We will stick to the other steak houses in the valley."}
{"text":"Dominick's Steakhouse is fantastic! I was recently in Phoenix/Scottsdale for business and my work colleagues and I decided to stop by Dominick's Steakhouse for dinner. We were not disappointed in our restaurant choice. From the start, the service at Dominick's was great. Although we arrived a bit early for our reservation, we were able to be seated fairly quickly. Our waiter Marcus was the absolute best. Friendly, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic, Marcus made sure we had an excellent dinner experience. Among the eight of us, we ordered a decadent amount of food: fresh burrata with tomato jam and figs, rhode island calamari and shrimp, the wedge salad, the heirloom tomato salad, the roasted beet salad, the superfood salad, the super colossal shrimp cocktail, the filet, the ribeye, the colorado whole rack of lamb, the chilean seabass, dominick's potatoes, sautéed mushrooms, roasted brussel sprouts, asparagus, chocolate cake, and warm caramel cake. Everything was absolutely well cooked and delicious. My bone in filet was a perfectly cooked medium rare. Highly recommend Dominick's if you're in town and looking for steak!"}
{"text":"Dominick's is an attractive place to dine-- yes, it's not eating, it's fine dining.   We began with garlic buns which were still in the hot pan in which they were made.  Soft, hot and delicious.   We had fried calamari as an appetizer and as perfectly fried as they were, they lacked in seasoning and in that seafood flavor one expects.  If I had closed my eyes, I wouldn't have known that they were calamari.  I ate them with the red sauce but they also offered up a mayonnaise based sauce as well.  We had a chopped salad which while well dressed, was not a wow for us.  I left most of it.    Hubby had the salmon and I had the New York Strip steak.  I asked for the steak to be cooked medium rare.  The steak arrived more on the medium side and as most people know, steak continues to cook for a few minutes even after being off the grill.  So as time went on, the medium was not so medium any more.  The salmon was very well prepared.  Mashed potatoes were probably the best I have ever had in a restaurant.  Truly perfection.  The corn creme brûlée was just too sweet to enjoy.   Dessert was a warm, caramel, vanilla cake with gelato.  An enjoyable dessert and a big portion so we couldn't finish it.   Service was very much on point and the food is worth the price.  There will be a next time."}
{"text":"I decided to take my Husband to Dominicks this past week for his Birthday dinner.  My Boss has been raving about this restaurant for awhile and since my Husband is a steak lover, I thought this would be the perfect option.  I made the reservation a few weeks in advance and called the week of to request a table poolside (per my Boss's recommendation).  I found it somewhat annoying that every time I called the restaurant I was put on hold for several minutes... this was mostly annoying because I called around noon each day; they certainly weren't busy then.  Anywho... upon our arrival I was happy to see my table request was accommodated, since they said that they couldn't guarantee it (not sure why since we were only 1 of 2 tables seated upstairs at 6:30 on a Thursday).  The decor upstairs is very nice.  It's kind of odd to see a small pool in the middle of the restaurant, but I thought it made for a nice ambiance.  Our waiter greeted us promptly and was very nice, friendly and knowledgeable.  All the the staff that helped him were also awesome.  We ordered some drinks and enjoyed the bread, which was served before the meal. My oh my was it good!  There was some onion bread, which was warm and cheese bread, which was also warm and quite good.  We shared the shrimp dominick for appetizer.  The sauce was garlicy-good!  This was the perfect start to our meal.  Each of us ordered steaks... I had the fillet and the Hubs (aka Birthday Boy) had the rib eye.  I really liked mine and thought it was cooked perfectly.  We both loved the sizzling plates they were served on.  The Hubs liked his steak, but would have preferred the fillet I got, since that is what he usually gets - liked the leaner meat.  We shared the dominick potatoes... talk about cheesy goodness.  We both could only have once serving, but it was like potato lasagna.  It was unbelievable!    The restaurant gave a very nice slice of chocolate cake to the Hubs for his birthday, which was also very good.  He loved the whipped cream, which was served on the side.  Ultimately, we both had a great time at this restaurant.  The serve was quite good (other than a long wait for the check).  It was SUPER expensive, however, so for us this was only a special occasion place."}
{"text":"Great Happy Hour. Food and drinks are wonderful as is the service. The variety of food selections is better than most Happy Hour fare. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came to this restaurant tonight for a romantic dinner with my husband. From the moment we walked in the door, we were wowed! We had the good fortune of being sat upstairs by the pool, and private dining space. This room had the intimacy and romance that we were hoping for.The staff was incredibly professional and attentive. Our needs were anticipated, and we never had to ask for a thing! Our server Anthony was very knowledgable and led us through the menu to help us make our choices. My husband and I shared many courses, including the NY Strip which was to die for, and you must try the butter cake, YUM! All in all, 100% recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"We were just there for the first time. The ambience was sophisticated elegance. Stellar service and amazing food. Everything was on point. So impressed with the service. The wait staff ran like a well-oiled machine. The hot towels are a nice touch - before and after our entrees. The dessert menu is incredible! We can't wait to come back to try the seafood entrees and the other desserts! If I could give 25 Stars I would!"}
{"text":"Last night we held our company Christmas party at Dominick's  I had made reservations 3 weeks in advance of the event. Dominick's had called that day to confirm our reservation as well.  When my party got there we were told that we should be seated in about 15 minutes.  Well......ok.  You know I come from the old school that a reservation holds a table that an 8:15am reservation means you will be seated at that time or very near to it.  Front  lobby staff were 5 very young girls that were not overly impressive.  The placed was slammed.  I have eaten at most of the best steak houses and I really enjoy the food and the level of service that you normally get.  I am more than happy to spend the type of money that a large party like ours would get in this enviroment for a great steakhouse experience.  We were then told that we could go in the bar and to \"check back\".  Really?  Seriously?  At this type of place I have to come to you?  Anyway, the bar was so full we could not even get in and ended back in the front lobby area.  We asked several times if our table was ready, and we were told 3 times \"Oh, it will be about 15 mintues.\"  Then the obvious stalling excuse was put forth \"we are setting up your table.\"  We heard that 3 times.  This came across as a trained response.  ONE HOUR AFTER OUR RESERVATION WE WERE FINALLY SEATED.  We did not even get an apology from anyone, and were made to feel that we were lucky to be there and spend $1,000+ for dinner.  It reminded me of the Seinfeld episode of \"You can take a reservation but can you hold a resvervation?\"  We were really excited to eat there as again I love the big steak house experience. Christopher was our waiter.  He was good, worked well.  Not overly warm.  The food was good.  On a scale of high end steak houses I would give it a 7-8.  My bone in rib eye was flavorful, but had more fat around it than I expected.  The gnocchi and lobster alfredo was dry and over cooked.  The potatos au gratin were really good. The oysters, shrimp, and crab were good.  An 8.  The wedge salad was really good.  Frankly, I'd rather go to the Mastro's North then this place again."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time last night for my anniversary.  It was excellent and the service was impeccable!! The Iceberg wedge was so good and the raw oysters as well.  I ordered an 8oz filet, which was mouth watering, and my husband ordered a ribeye which he loved.  The truffle twice baked potatoe was a bit spendy but soooooo good.  I can't say enough good things about this restaurant, they even called me this morning to see if we had a nice time.  I would definitely recommend this place for someone looking for an upscale dining experience.  We will be back for sure!!  Oh, and the bread rolls are delicious."}
{"text":"One word comes to mind when I think of fine-dining \"Mastro's\".  Mastro's collection of sophisticated, classic steakhouse and ocean club seafood locations are recognized for their combination of world-class service, highly acclaimed cuisine, and live entertainment in an elegant yet energetic atmosphere. A truly unparalleled fining experience.   And now in North Scottsdale you have Dominick's Italian Steakhouse here are my personal recommendations.  APPETIZERS & SALADS Shrimp cocktail, Dungeness crab cocktail, Dominick's chopped salad.  STEAKS & CHOPS Filet mignon, New York strip, Chef's cut bone In rib eye, Birkshier \"double cut\" pork chop.   SEAFOOD Chilean sea bass, Salmon, Arctic char oreganata.  SIDE DISHES Garlic mashed potatoes, Gnocchi (with crab meat and truffles), Sautéed spinach with garlic, asparagus, creamed corn, creamed spinach."}
{"text":"We came here for my girlfriends birthday and it was a pretty cool experience. The restaurant ambiance was modern and trendy. We requested to sit upstairs by the pool. I wouldn't recommend it because even though it is a big dining area, it feels like you are secluded from the restaurant. I suggest sitting downstairs in the main dining area above the first set of stairs. For the appetizer we ordered the Shrimp Dominick which was pretty good but only had 3 medium sized shrimp. It was served in a garlicky vodka sauce which tasted decent and it also came with 3 pieces of cheesy garlic toast. We split a Caesar salad which was excellent. The whole anchovies in it was the perfect touch. When I got my steak I knew it was a little over cooked. I could tell it was on the medium-medium well side even though I ordered it medium rare. I didn't want to send it back because I didn't feel like waiting around. My girlfriend pointed out that her steak was a little over cooked as well. We also got the mashed potatoes, Mac n cheese, and creamed corn. All sides were great and I would recommend getting the half portions if you want to try a little of each. For dessert we got a butter cake on the house thanks to our server Janice and bussed Evan. I couldn't have asked for better service. Overall, we had a pretty decent dining experience minus the over cooked steaks."}
{"text":"Very nice bar area, I havent actually eaten here yet so I'm reserving, my 5 star rating until after I have a filet..But easy three stars for the ambience, staff and decor"}
{"text":"I want to take the time to write about the most wonderful dining experience I have ever had. From the moment we walked into the door everything was 1st class.  The food was so wonderful and hot and fresh and flavorful and the staff was just as exceptional. When the meal arrived it was like a fine, orchestrated dance.  One server after another brought out the different dishes and offered them to everyone at the table. I am always happy to pay for excellent food and service.  It was so refreshing to enjoy a wonderful evening with top notch people."}
{"text":"Last night we went to Dominick's for the first time.  It was for our 25th Anniversary.  It was a great experience.  The atmosphere was great.  The food was the best.  I had the 16 oz NY Strip and it was cooked to perfection.   I also had the fried meatballs.  They were better then I could have imagined.  My wife had the Maryland Cab Cakes. She grew up in Baltimore and she said they were very very good.   The coffee was excellent.  They surprised us with a desert for our anniversary.  It was great.  Overall we had one of the best nights out in a while.  And we go out two nights a week for dinner.  We have found our new favorite steakhouse.       PS:  The live music was great."}
{"text":"This is my anniversary spot.  Amazing atmosphere with the finest foods and beverage!  I recommend grabbing a rooftop table on a beautiful night.   This is a high roller type of place with class and will not disappoint.  Shine your shoes and give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Food was some of best I've ever had.  Ask for Brett, he was a great server and had extensive knowledge of the menu and wine list."}
{"text":"Went to Dononics for Easter brunch. The only thing special for Easter was a items from their dinner menu with an added egg. No special items or prices.  For a bright sunny day the inside of the restaurant was dark and gloomy. All the large windows were closed Just didn't feel good. The bread was stale and no butter. Closed out are bill and left. One of the main features of Dononics is the open deck and pool which was closed.  This restaurant needs a new manager."}
{"text":"Came here with my bro since we got a gift card for Christmas, so my expectations for the meal were low/average. However, I thoroughly enjoyed everything I ate at Dominick's and was very satisfied with the friendly natural service and the taste of the food.  Start off with the bread. They have several flavors, of which we opted for sea salt and butter. I'll be straight with you, this is probably the best free bread I've ever had at dinner. The rolls are served monkey bread style in a hot cast iron pan. From the richness of the salt and butter on the outer layer to the soft bread on the inside, this was a perfect fusion of dinner roll and pretzels. Would love to try to other flavors - but unfortunately I ate three pieces by myself.  Our appetizer was the shrimp and calamari combo. Two seafoods, three sauces, one solid dish. You get a solid portion of both proteins. While the sauces are somewhat basic from ketchup to some sort of remoulade, they were all enjoyable. Gotta love the banana peppers slipped in there as well.  Now for the main attraction and the sides. My bro got the bone out rib-eye Oscar style (crab cake, asparagus, and hollandaise) while I got the hefty bone in version. Both medium rare, and well seasoned compared to some other name steakhouses in the area.  My bro is still a little bro, so the least adventurous sides he could eat were steamed broccoli and truffle fries. With the small version of each, that should have been plenty. The broccoli was a manageable size but came with hollandaise sauce to dip (say what!?). The truffle fries seemed much bigger by comparison, and I like how neither the truffle nor the cheese was overpowering.   If you order any kind of appetizer, I would recommend one side at most for two people. Otherwise two could be fine.  I came in expecting some okay overpriced food, but honestly I loved everything here. Would love to come back on my own dime and take the family on a special occasion."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great experience! My friend and I were staying at a nearby hotel for a work event and stumbled upon Domincks! Man, are we happy we did! Great service from Sarah, seriously she was amazing and made our experience. We both had rib eyes and shared a few sides and everything was perfect! We will totally be back next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite steakhouse in AZ!! This place is amazing. I ordered the Bone in filet with crab legs. It's the best I ever had !! The ahi is great as well. We ordered the banana split dessert as well!!  It was sooo good. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Walked over to Dominick's again this evening. Our first experience with the hostesses the other day wasn't very good so, my wife and I by past them completely, as the same one that was rude the other day was working, and we sat at the bar.  Boy, am I glad we gave Dominick's another try! There were a few bartenders working but, Lindsay (I believe) was so personable and made us feel very welcome. Our cocktails were delicious, and dinner was incredible, worth every penny! We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Well unfortunately this was our third and last try for Dominicks. We tried it during opening week..service was so so. Gnocchi was pasty and sauce was canned. Our table was regrettable as every waiter in the place passed by, way too close every few moments. A year later my husband had some business associates who wanted to dine there. Once again food was sub par. Got the tomahawk steak, seafood tower...seafood was good , steak was super greasy and fatty, not much meat as the waiter advertised for a large party to share . So noisy had to lean in close to talk to anyone, we had a party of six. Our last visit was last week. Sat in bar, ordered meatballs, came sliding on a plain white plate...very dry, not worth the calories. I was in the mood for fish, got the Dover Sole. Honestly looked and tasted like a frozen fish stick, couldn't eat it. My husband got the Ahi, fish was ok, presentation was horrible. Fish on a white plate..no more. All in all the $3000 we spent there was outrageously wasted. Our bad, should have never gone again after 2nd disappointment."}
{"text":"The folks who own this restaurant used to own Mastros, so they know a thing or two abut steaks.  I had the filet and it was wonderful.  Make sure to get the warm butter cake.  But save room, it's a small meal itself and you can't leave any on your plate.  We had great service and a wonderful experience.  Go."}
{"text":"Been there several times since they opened, inconsistent, service poor, steaks good, sides mediocre. Too many high-end steak houses in town to put up with the inconsistency and at times very aloof service from the wait staff."}
{"text":"My friend and I took a drive up to North Scottsdale to check out the new Restoration Hardware and FLOR store at Scottsdale Quarter. I happened to valet outside of Dominick's so when it was almost dinner time, it's where we ended up!  Lovely interior. It has a rich charm and is complete with a guy playing the piano. If I were mob, I surely would be having major deals go down or bring my goo-ma here. I love that there are hard-boiled eggs on the bar for \"snacks\" - forget that disgusting party mix or popcorn.  Shrimp cocktail to start (comes with 3...ordered 1 extra), bone-in New York (asked for it sliced so it was easy to share) and then creamed spinach. Of course, the bread basket comes out first - there was a delicious onion bread that was incredible.  The shrimp came out large and in charge. They have a seriously hot horseradish - love this (although wasn't as amazing as my all-time favorite... City Hall's crack-laced horseradish that I want to marry.) Bummer... there was no spoon for the ketchup/horseradish - probably just got overlooked in the kitchen. Steak came out perfectly, even though they forgot to slice it. DARN! But we managed to saw away at the hunk of meat anyways. It's the best to order it rare or medium rare and then you can sear the slices on the butter-laden smokin' hot plates! Learned that trick from a friend, try it next time.  The creamed spinach was INCREDIBLE!! It was less \"creamed\" then you'd usually expect but the texture and flavor was perfect. It had a Parmesan crusted top or something that was magic and just added the perfect touch. Hands down a winner.  Overall great service, great food and if I find myself in the area, I'd definitely be back."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  The ambiance is nice and the steaks are buttery and good. They also make pretty good drinks.  Great place for date night or celebrating something special."}
{"text":"Service was very good, steaks were OK comparable to Flemings and nothing near Mastro's. Side dishes limited and not very good and the lobster tail had absolutely no flavor - thought I was eating Orange Roughy. Everyone bragged about there being a swimming pool upstairs but it wasn't much more than a large wishing well. For the price I would stay with Mastro's."}
{"text":"To start the night off they offer complimentary valet. This was a good hit for me because I HATE driving around looking for a parking space.  The serves at this restaurant was superb. We ordered the 12oz steak and shared. It's was More the. Enough. The sizes are very BIG. It's enough for at least 4 people to share. So try to order different things so that you get to taste a little bit of everything.  Spinach- I'm not a spinach fan so I won't say much about it but my friends said it was just Ok  Mushrooms- Once again I'm not a fan of mushrooms but my table thought it was the best side dish. It was seasoned to perfection (so I was told)  Broccoli- I like my broccoli a little tender. Not hard has a rock. Sooo the broccoli would have been better if I informed the waiter what I wanted.  Potatoes- now this was yummy. It was like eating potatoes in the style of lasagna.   Onion Focaccia  was a different treat to start the night off. Totally not your typical bread.   I enjoyed my experience with this Dommicks will definitely come back."}
{"text":"as far as steakhouses go, this is nice place with a good piece of meat. it has a classy steakhouse-esque ambiance (cushy chairs, dark lighting, every table setting imaginable) and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful.   i feel like steakhouses are all fairly the same and this one doesn't really do anything to set itself apart. one note: sides are shareable (which is nice) so try different ones at the table.  all in a nice experience but it felt general."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with a cool atmosphere; the top floor room has a pool. Really enjoyed their fried calamari and their butter cake has changed my life!"}
{"text":"So I went here for the first time with a friend a couple months ago.... The bread was amazing along with the service. I ordered the filet steak and it was amazing! The service was extremely good and the restaurant was very comforting."}
{"text":"The food was good, exactly the same as Steak 44, which has the same owners. Comparing the atmosphere and ambiance of the two, we prefer Steak 44. That said the meal was great, however, we do prefer the old recipe for what was called \"Butter Cake\", the fruit was a nice touch. Nonetheless, everything was satisfactory."}
{"text":"Side dishes and appetizers were good. The steak was horrible. The location is nice but will I ever return to this steak house, no. I would say Ocean Club & Flemings are better."}
{"text":"Dominick's is by far the best steakhouse I've had. Our server, Rauson was a top notch waiter. He knew specific details about the menu. He tended to our requests and was so diligent. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Took the wife for her birthday.  I have been here before  and it was fantastic. This time we tried the fried deviled eggs. All you tasted was the oil from the deep fryer and the dipping sauce was lacking of taste.  The hash browns were rectangle, deep fried that tasted like they got them from a fast food drive thru,  the cream cheese was mixed with sour cream  as a dipping sauce rather than being mixed in with the hash Brown before cooking. Once again fryer oil tasting. The sauté spinach had a very strange taste to it, that I only took 2 bites and left the rest to be thrown out.  I happen to love spinach. The mushroom medley also had a strange taste.  My steak and ahi tuna were very good though.  My wife's filet minion was very dry. Can definitely say I won't be returning."}
{"text":"We and another couple revisited Dominick's last Saturday the 5th of March for dinner and drinks. The level of service and food dropped significantly from our last visit.   On the food side, we were disappointed with many things. My oysters were the smallest I have ever seen. Maybe they were some special midget oysters from a far away land, but I considered them a poor value for the price. I should have been warned that they were going to be tiny when I ordered them. Two of the four entrees were a let-down. My friend's filet was cooked properly, but tough and sat too long before it was served. His wife's soul (the fish not her spirit) was the low of the evening. It was very mushy and not fresh. The mashed potato side dish was watery and under-seasoned. My rib-eye was good and my wife's chicken was just OK as she put it.   On the service side, our server Robbie did not make us feel comfortable enough to ask for new entrees. He seemed busy and pre-occupied all evening. He never made a connection with us. The bus staff was inattentive leaving empty plates on the table for too long. We had drinks in the bar following the meal and our server was Sara. Her service was the best of the evening.  The experience as a whole did not meet our expectations for the money spent. I can only speculate that more attention from a management standpoint has been paid to Steak 44. All of our trips to Steak 44 have been fantastic. It was interesting to see many empty tables at Dominick's on a Saturday night. This makes me wonder if our experience is typical. We really love the menu's at both restaurants, but Steak 44 is consistently excellent while Dominick's is going to get crossed off my list of hangouts."}
{"text":"My wife had been here previously for a work function and said it would be a great place to celebrate.   We decided to celebrate our 1 year anniversary here and enjoyed it thoroughly. Calamari was fantastic! We both ordered the petit filet with 1/2 portion of sautéed mushrooms, corn and mash potatoes. What I liked most was their presentation as they brought you over and extremely hot plate with your steak on it as the food runners plated your sides in front of you onto the sizzling plate. It was nice as it kept your sides hot while you ate!  Drinks were made and delivered promptly, usually a problem at high end places like this. Server was friendly and attentive.   Will return again  Update: my wife would like me to add their bread was delicious but we were not offered the variety of flavors the other tables were. Initial person who greeted us did not ask."}
{"text":"After all of the rave of Dominick's I had to give this restaurant a try, and well it was no disappointment. Service was outstanding, we had 3 people in our party and although seated in a side room with not much view of the rest of the restaurant action it was fine the service made up for it and also gave us time to be fully engaged in our good company we had in town. The steaks were cooked to perfection the fish was delightful and the potatoes au gratin was out of this world! I will highly recommend this restaurant to my friends and clients."}
{"text":"Whenever there is some sort of holiday or reason to take someone out to a nice steak and seafood dinner this is the place.  I wish I could eat there once a week but it's a little pricey for that. In am a huge fan of mastros as well but  Dominick's has a really cool ambiance that appeals to me more and it's basically the same menu.  Their fresh bread basket has some really tastes breads and I would highly recommend the seafood tower which is my favorite to start or I could just fill up on the seafood tower and a salad alone.  I also recommend the shrimp Dominick which has this amazing sauce that you can also dip your bread in.  I have never has a bad cut of meat there and the sides are so delicious and they are pretty large so I am always taking home tons of leftovers.  And there is nothing better than steakhouse leftovers (except maybe cold pizza but anyway) the next day.  The butter cake is by far my favorite dessert if you still have room after everything else which is usually not the case for me.  If you are looking to impress, this is definitely the spot.  Plus the quarter is a cool place to walk around after dinner and iPic is right there to catch a movie at too."}
{"text":"We were so looking forward to eating at Dominick's, but left with such shock and disappointment!  First of all, we sat upstairs where they have a lovely reflection pool.  Nice touch, although the decor was so beautiful, it wasn't really necessary!  We also enjoyed the roof opened up at dusk to allow a view of the skyline and stars and fresh cool air.  That part was lovely.  Our server, Beth, was really a delight and also made the food sound fabulous!  However, That's where the good part ended!  We ordered a spinach salad, LOADED with bacon grease and not much flavor.  The veal Parmensan, supposedly a signature dish, was dried out because it was over cooked.  The veal was quite thick, which made me suspicious that it was veal.  The steak has a peppery rub (also used on the veal chop), that we didn't expect nor did we like.  We also had an appetizer of calamari that looked so good at another table that we decided to try it also!.  Bland breading made it disappointing.  The saving grace was the nice dipping sauces that accompanied the Calamari.  We had one vegetable that was Spinach with garlic.  Nothing to write home about.  All in all, this place needs some tweeking.  It was so mediocre, that I doubt we would even return!  They do have right now, a great singer in the bar."}
{"text":"Just came from Dominick's steakhouse. Food excellent. Service okay. We were celebrating our anniversary   When we arrived they could not find our reservation. Sign #1. Okay seated poolside as requested   Food great service ok. Music so loud even wAiter said they asked for it to be turned down.   Now we went from the chest stomping bass to someone screaming so loud i thought my hears were going to bleed even the young people at the table next to us complained. We were celebrating our anniversary and could not hear each other. SAve the $$$$$$ dont go complained to the manager and she really didnt seem to care"}
{"text":"If you've ever been to any of the Mastro's family of restaurants you know what I mean when I say Dominick's is like Ocean Club and City Hall had a baby. The original owners of Mastro's took the best of the local dining legacies, added some Italian dishes to the menu (yay!) and opened Dominicks.   Simply pulling up to valet and walking the red carpet leading into the restaurant is like food foreplay! It's all good lovin' from there!! It's all-star dining with 5 star prices but worth every dime.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"11 Stars out of 10  Great Food, Knowledgeable waiters, unbelievably helpful staff.   A great place for special occasions. The bill will run you at least $40 a head, more around $60/head with alcohol but is absolutely worth it. The steaks are fantastic, the sides delicious, and the whole experience incredible.  The top floor has a retractable roof and a little pool which makes for a fun environment.   You will have no regrets here as long as you are aware it is a pricy steakhouse. But well worth it."}
{"text":"Dominick's Steakhouse is the Willy Wonka's factory of steakhouses. The ambiance and surroundings are very calm, and the overall shape of the restaurant is, well, perfect. Everything about this place is of the highest quality and perfection. Immediately you are prompted for what beverages you would like to be sipping on the rest of the night. The wine selection is endless and so are the refills. If you are not swayed by alcoholic beverages then you are sure to be enthralled by the water. The bottle water is expensive for a very particular reason; it comes from a melting glacier that is literally 10,000 years old. The tap water is just as good though.  To start off with an appetizer, my friend Jeff and I tried the Shrimp Dominick for the appetizer. The creamy sauce perfectly accented the shrimp and accompanying thin slices of toast. I ordered the Filet Mignon with bone in prepared medium. This steak was absolutely amazing. It instantly melted in my mouth after each bite. It was as if God himself came down and gave me this steak. Then for my sides I had the mashed potatoes and sweet, creamy corn. These sides were large enough to feed 3 people generously, and just like the steak provided a feeling of absolute pure euphoria with each bite. The mashed potatoes were as white as a Minnesota winter, and had just the right creamy texture. The sweet creamy corn was fresh of the cornstalk with a CAT truckload of crème to back it up. To tie it up, we ordered a Molten Lava Cake, which literally sealed the deal on the entire meal. The service from the staff was absolutely above and beyond. Our waiter was always around the corner to make sure our drinks were full, and tended to our every need.  All in all, if you have $200 to blow on a dinner for two; go to Dominick's Steakhouse, you will not regret it. However, if you are looking for a reasonably priced dinner, then this will probably not meet your criteria, but I highly recommend you still look into it as an option."}
{"text":"Great food, great atmosphere, & great service.  We got a table on the top level by the pool and it was a great experience.  Perfect mix of being classy yet hip and unique.  The Crispy Shrimp & the Calamari were great starters.  The Filet and Loaded Baked Potato were superb. Great wine selection and great wine recommendations."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, food & service! Definitely request the top level, open air rooftop with a mini looking pool in the middle of floor. We took the kids, unfortunately they didn't have a kids menu."}
{"text":"We made an early reservation for my husband`s birthday dinner. I really wanted him to have an exceptional meal, and they absolutely delivered. Jennifer was our server, and she is top notch. As this was our first visit, she patiently and graciously answered our many questions and offered excellent recommendations. My advice? Come hungry. The portions are generous, the food perfection.   We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on Saturday.  Overall the experience and the food were pretty average.  Server was nice but not top notch.  For the first time I had to use table salt to make my steak have any flavor."}
{"text":"Good food, sometimes the service lack.  Great atmosphere,  Would recommend this place based on that.  Otherwise pretty typical prime steak joint."}
{"text":"We set up a privet dinner for a friends birthday . Well all I can say was dinner was just okay and service was bad . I guess when you have a set gratuity they don't really care part for 19 friends . I will never go back . Over priced and bad food . I want to say something good but I can't just all bad .....  oh wait the valet guy was cool ."}
{"text":"This place is incredible. Luckily j was able to go for a business dinner, because heck this place is expensive. I would never ever pay these prices to eat anywhere! Seriously though I had the pork chops and they were so good. Everyone else was dying over the steak and how it melted in their mouths. I really enjoyed the meatballs but some thought they were salty. The bread was  delicious too. I am just not a foodie. It was a really nice experience and our waiter was fantastic. Overall a great place to celebrate a life event or if your into high dollar food!"}
{"text":"Food is ALWAYS amazing. Poor rating based on service alone.   My wife and I took one of our best friends to Dominick's for dinner for his 30th birthday. Upon being seated we we're greeted by our server after a few minutes. He got us each our water and asked if we would like bread to snack on and we said yes please. The bread was brought out by someone else and we did not see our server again until the check was delivered to our table. Luckily I used to work in the service industry and knew another server that was working that night and he took our wine order and food order, refilled our wine glasses, AND checked on the taste of our meal. We would have ordered more wine but there was no server. My wife only drank water bc she was driving us and her water glass was never refilled after its initial appearance. The next time we saw our server he dropped off the check at the table and said Thanks.   Overall, the food is outstanding every time we go to Dominick's. I even proposed to my wife here. However, this time was also for a special occasion and the service was about equal to what I would expect from a Chili's or Applebee's. That is besides that of a friend that could only offer limited support to our table AND received none of the tip.  This would Not be expected of our favorite steakhouse in Phoenix and Scottsdale...And definitely not a up to par with a $400+ tab."}
{"text":"My family and I were at Dominick's last night celebrating my '50 something' Birthday. Everything was great from cocktails to dessert. My wife and daughter split the crab legs, they were monsters of the sea, The N.Y. Strip and Filet were perfectly cooked and seasoned. The creme brûlée corn was a great side!! Our waitress added to our awesome dining experience. I hope you have as good a dining experience!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try somewhere new for a special birthday. Nothing special, food was just alright, service okay. My husband steak was over cooked, mine was undercooked. Presentation, just a piece of meat on a plate. My son asked for a blended drink, they don't serve blended drinks. Very noisy. Will stick to Ruth Chris next time!"}
{"text":"This is a traditional old style steak house, leather seating wood grain ambience. Service is impeccable. Great appetizers and a menu that suits all with steaks to seafood. I am having the short ribs tonight, melt in your mouth good. Plan to share all the sides are great"}
{"text":"I came here to meet with business contacts while on a business trip.  We were seated quickly at a nice table and the service was impeccable.  Appetizer was perfect and the warm bread and butter was fantastic.  My water glass was never empty and they have a way of being very attentive without disturbing your meal at the same time.  Decor is beautiful and what you would expect in a nice steakhouse.  I ordered a steak and wow.  It was aged and cooked perfectly (medium so still very pink to red in the center)  They really know their steak here!  Potato sides were also amazing.  The chocolate cake dessert at the end was super rich and chocolatey.  Fantastic.  This is definitely a higher-priced choice in restaurant, but worth every dime.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"First, I typically don't post reviews, but when you pay $150 for dinner and drinks, you expect perfection. So let me say that the atmosphere and service was exceptional.  Very attentive, friendly and responsive, in fact, my water glass never dipped below half full before someone came along and filled it.  We had a party of 8, and we all had the same experience. Awesome service.  My only complaint was my steak. I ordered bone in rib eye, medium, with Brussel sprouts and Dominic's potatoes.  The veggies were awesome but my steak was a huge disappointment.  Mostly fat, but I only ate half while there. I took the other half home. I should have said something while I was there, but the party was awesome and I didn't feel good about disrupting the flow. The next day, I went to heat up my left over steak,,, obviously hoping for the best, but no different.  I ended up throwing it away.  Having cooked rib eye countless times, you know the second you pick out ur steak if you got a good one or a bad one,, so I can't believe the chef let this one out, but none the less it did. And as I started my review, it was a huge disappointment.  I guess the best advice I can give is that if you get s bad steak, don't be shy.  I have to believe they would have made it right had I spoken up at the time."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! Atmosphere, service ,food quality , and portions. In town on business , also anniversary, will definitely be back. 3 meat meatball appetizer ,  New York strip steak cooked to perfection , shared a giant baked potato wedge salad , corn , desert to die for and a libation list second to none. All of it comes with a pretty good price ...but worth every cent and then some. Special thanks to James our server. Spoil yourself here    - Paul  Orlando , Fl"}
{"text":"OK here's the deal.  We were there for a special occasion.  We were first seated next to the bar area.  It was way to noisy and we had them change our table (no problem).  we ordered drinks, husband had bottled beer and I had an elite martini.  No appetizers but they brought a bread basket.  Half way through my drink I felt a bigger \"buzz\" than usual but didn't think anything of it (after all I was drinking vodka).  Our dinner came, delicious, and I finished my drink and told my husband that all of a sudden I felt \"loopy and really drunk\".  1 drink !!!!  From that point on I remember just patches of my evening until I went to the ER (3 hours later) and found out that my blood and urine tests came back \"off the charts\". So CAUTION LADIES, someone put something in my drink that night.  Who?  I will never know but this is where it happened and it was quite frightening.  Thank God I was with my husband who took great care of me.  I did file a police report ~~~"}
{"text":"Mind blowing experience !!!  My friend and I decided to visit Dominicks for some beignets. I had never had them there before and she assured me they were good and we had to try them. I love beignets and was very excited about them.   We walked in and I asked the hostess if they have beignets and she informed us they did and we decided to head over to the bar for much anticipated beignets! As we were about to sit, we informed the bartender we were there for some coffee and beignets. He told us they don't have them!!! We thought he was joking but he was not. We went back and forth about 5 times and finally went back to the hostess. She assured us they DO have them and that the bartender will be notified. We went back to the bar and told him we were told they do have them. At this point the bartender told us they do not place orders for them unless it's a \"Special occasion or special person\" Whaaaaaat????? I could not believe what I was hearing. They are only for special people? How is that determined at dominicks!?  We told him AGAIN we were told they are available, he walked away who knows where to check. With my blood boiling, I decided to go back to the hostess and tell her we will not be staying as this type of treatment is unacceptable.  The beignets were already ordered so we stayed, they were ok nothing I would ever come back for. The whole experience was ruined. I wanted to order a latte and he told me they only have was press or cappuccino. Really? I think there is a lot of training needed at this pretentious restaurant, if you have espresso then you pretty much have any other coffee drink."}
{"text":"I had dinner at the bar.  Ian was the bartender.  I could not have asked for a more professional server.  My tenderloin was delicious.  The mac and cheese is the best I have ever had.  The best part really was the service by Ian.  He knew the menu and made great recommendations."}
{"text":"It's really hard for me to review Dominick's. I expected so much more but was disappointed with the atmosphere and the food, however, the service was excellent-- attentive but not intrusive. Concerned with my satisfaction.   I've had steaks just as good at Mastro's, City Hall, and Donovan's. Steaks are just under $50 so my expectations were high. I had rack of lamb, ordered medium but came very nearly well done. DH ordered bone in filet, medium, which came med-well. To his credit, our waiter, Brad, noticed without my saying anything and offered to take it back. I declined, as I didn't want to ruin my husbands birthday dinner. He took it off the bill. A very classy move.  Caution -- the plates come out VERY hot. We had to wait several minutes to eat because the food was molten hot. I'm sure that's what caused it to be overdone. Seems to be over-pretentious.   Wine list has good variety. We paid $102 for a bottle of cab, which was about middle of the road, price-wise.   Au gratin potatoes are fabulous but very hot at first (see above). We had butter cake for dessert. I think they had planned to bring another dessert for my husbands birthday but they accommodated his request and there was no charge. Another classy move.  Live music was nice but added to a pretty loud environment. It was hard to converse.   So, mixed reviews. If you're dying to try it, go for it. Maybe your experience will be better than mine. I'm not sure I'd go back, though."}
{"text":"Planned a night out with girlfriends. We called for reservation for Tuesday night. They said, No need to, not a busy night. We sat at the bar. The bar tender was great help with picking  out wine for the meal we ordered. Service was outstanding food was great. Would recommend trying it out. Although we did miss out on music since they play Wed- Sat."}
{"text":"I have no other way of saying the food is not worth the cost, they never get the steak right.  Its either undercooked or overcooked!  The service is fine but the food is blah."}
{"text":"LOVE the Happy Hour options!  Get here early for a seat at the bar.  The drinks are well-prepared, bountiful and delicious! I suggest the Beef and Bleu for an appetizer.  That sauce is incredible!"}
{"text":"Ruth Chris, you have nothing to worry about when it comes to steaks. Good sides, great cocktails, unbelievable service at Dominic's."}
{"text":"After being seated at Dominick's I mentioned to the others at my table that today most steakhouses seem the same and expected a good meal and service, but nothing surprising from Dominick's.  I have read some of the other reviews about service, butter cake, and other items just seemed fair.  I disagree, but does all that really matter.  I came to a steakhouse for a steak and Dominick's knocked it out of the park.    I had an 8 oz. medium rare filet mignon and it was flavorful and tender.  Actually I would say it is the best filet I have ever had.  I really wanted to try the 18 oz. bone-in filet, but that is too much steak for me in one sitting.  The only reason I rated Dominick's a 4 compared to a 5 was that personally I dig the old style feel and decor of the older steakhouses.  Enjoy."}
{"text":"W o w.  So yes, let's make one thing very, very clear: Dominick's is expensive and it definitely is fine dining.  You're not only paying big bucks for your food, but you're also paying for the experience.  This place is gorgeous and the staff are all EXTREMELY professional and friendly.  We were sat in the wine room, which is on the first floor, right behind the main bar.  It's a pretty small room.  I think it fit 4-5 tables so it's definitely a great private and intimate area.  The wine room is surrounded by huge glass doors, each one displaying countless bottles of wine.  It was BEAUTIFUL.  And I'm super bummed I didn't take any pictures! The wine room is super-duper romantic! I also hear the top floor's pool seating area is also romantic, but I didn't get a chance to see it.   Our waitress (omg I forgot her name) was unbelievably charismatic.  She made us feel extra welcomed.  One thing you'll notice about Dominick's menu is that there's 4-5 different side potato dishes! Feeling overwhelmed, I asked our waitress which one I should choose, and she laughed and kindly described each dish.  She recommended the crispy hasselback potato so that's what we ordered.  10/10 would recommend, over and over again.  We also got the sautéed sweet corn (which were EXTREMLY and oddly yellow? Anyway, this is beside the point), which was just as delicious! One of the chefs and a different waiter brought out each of our sides and served us! I thought it was a lovely touch. Each side dish is pretty generous so I definitely recommend sharing.  As for the steaks, I got the bone-in ribeye medium, and my SO got the bone-in KC strip medium rare.  Honestly, I'm practically drooling right now from just thinking of the steaks.  These steaks are HUGE!!!!!!!!!!!! I got the \"regular\" ribeye, which is 22 oz.  I'm not sure why I always do this to myself, but I convince myself that I can easily eat a gigantic steak at whatever steakhouse I'm at, but each time I order said steak, I end up eating only 1/6 of it.  Anyway, if you're like me, definitely save a few bucks and order a smaller steak, or order something else and split a steak with your SO.  For the record, my SO didn't finish his steak either!  The only thing that I wasn't a huge fan of was the black truffle green peppercorn sauce that was (fortunately) brought out on the side for my steak.  I can't accurately describe the flavor, but it just... wasn't good.  It just tasted like really sour wine? It didn't really even have a hint of truffle or peppercorn.  I literally dipped once piece of steak into it and that was it.  My SO didn't seem to be a fan of it either.  He was also too enchanted by the blue cheese he got on his steak so...  As always, my SO picked the wine and I have no idea what I drank - all I know is that it was expensive and I liked it and we finished an entire bottle.  I should mention that we went to Dominick's to celebrate my SO's birthday.  I called ahead to make reservations and told them that we were going there for a birthday.  Upon our arrival, they had a birthday card for him! Another lovely touch.  Although, I will admit that I was a tiny bit disappointed when I saw that the card was just a piece of paper folded in half... Honestly, I would've loved some branded stationary, especially for the $$$$ we paid!  A piece of paper with Dominick's on the letterhead would've been sweet!  Word of advice to Dominick's: this is a golden marketing and branding opportunity!  In addition to the card/piece of paper, our waitress surprised us with the desserts menu and said that it was on the house.  Of course, my SO ordered the sweetest thing on the menu. It was a vanilla cake with gelato and caramel, I think.  They brought it out on a nice long, white plate, with a huge pile of whipped cream and a candle.  They also wrote \"Happy Birthday\" in chocolate.  Another great lovely touch!  Long story short, if you want to seriously woo that special somebody in your life, take them to Dominick's! We had a wonderful experience and the staff certainly impressed us with all of their little touches (aside from the piece of paper/card; maybe this was fluke or maybe they ran out of branded stationary... who knows!)  Will I come back here? Probably.  Will I come back here soon? Probably not.  I need to talk to my wallet first."}
{"text":"The oysters On the Half-Shell were amazingly fresh. My bone in steak was perfect. My fiance had the crab cakes and it had lump crab in it the size of quarters! The service was perfect and the food was amazing. The only issue I had was with the entitled millennial wife beater who screamed at his date for 10 minutes then tried to start fights with the tables around him. Management kicked him out and they comped our drinks. Not the ideal situation to propose to my girlfriend but Dominicks management handled it with class. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Super slow service to get started. We sat for over 36 minutes before we ordered our food. Seems like they were understaffed. We were thinking of walking out because it took so long just to order and we were afraid it's going to be just as long to get our food.   Surprisingly after we finally ordered , the food came out quickly. The portion and quality was excellent.  The bread was really good. Salad was so so. The appetizer and sides were huge and had a lot of variety.   I will go back again soon and I hope the service will be faster next time."}
{"text":"Went there once not sure I'll ever go back.  Pros:  Good steak and great bar.  The Cons list is long:  you have to pay $6 to valet your car to spend $400 on dinner, everything other than the steak was mediocre at best, server failed to bring the right scotch 2 times, server failed to bring the detailed receipt which proved he brought the wrong scotch twice, the bar is just like Marco Polo a meat  market for both blue hairs and hookers.  I was shocked such a new place had such a clientele out of the gate.  Don't waste your time if you want a great meal and service.  You won't find it here.  Overpriced and over hyped.  They need to change their ways quick to make this steakhouse a winner.  I'm going back to my old favorites......"}
{"text":"We are going there for years, but today the overall experience was below par. The food was luke warm and the server forgot to introduce herself. We mentioned our concerns regarding the food quality and the manager came over to ask us. We explained, but never felt we were taken seriously. Interestingly two other tables brought up the same concerns, but same result. Disappointing and won't go there for a while. Looks like there is a new chef and recipes have changed but same description on the menu."}
{"text":"Took my husband here for his 40th birthday. We did not have a reservation on a Thursday night at 7pm and they got us in and boy were we in for a treat!! Our waitress Mariah, was so attentive, kind, and knowledge on food, flavors, drinks, etc. Not to mention Marcos(I believe), he was there to take plates away, he was there to really make our night feel special. Everyone there was absolutely AMAZING!! This place is pricey but, honestly the service we received made it worth it. Could not have found a better restaurant to enjoy a magnificent night. Thank you Dominick's for giving us such amazing customer service. We'll be Back!!!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. After hearing about the rooftop dining, I decided the next time I came here I would try to get the poolside table. So this past weekend we decided to come here and just as my request they seated me next to the pool. The service here has never let me down. The food has always been amazing. It was just so beautiful being able to see the clouds and stars while eating. The rooftop has a different ambiance more quiet and intimate. I cannot wait to come back again!"}
{"text":"I had the 12oz wagyu filet and it is the single best cut of steak I have ever had in my life. That is reason enough for me to give this place 5 stars. I have eaten steaks all around the world in some very high end restaurants, and in my opinion nothing I have had beats the wagyu filet at this place.   The remainder of our culinary experience was very good, though nothing that can't be found at other high end restaurants. I felt that the food lacked a certain creative flair that you would typically expect to find at an establishment like this. There was nothing exceptional about the calamari we ordered and the presentation of the clams seemed kind of... well, drab. That said, Dominick's is a fine restaurant, but that is to be expected in this price range.  I highly recommend the beignet tree for dessert!"}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my Fiancé's birthday and it was simply a wonderful first experience. Wonderful service, amazing romantic atmosphere, and most important ---the food was AMAZING.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is a great place!  My first time in a couple weeks and loved it!  Reminds me of Matro's Steak House.  I think these guy were some of  the prior owners of Mastro's.    We had a table of four.  Crab bisque for the starter. The steaks were perfect. Crab cakes were great!  The Lobster Mac n cheese was good. The cream corn was great!  Service was very good!  He was attentive but not too much. Not aggressive, humble and friendly service.  Just how I like it!  The bar looked like a good place to hang out.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Let's start off with saying that I came here for a medical lecture with a group of about 35 people and was seated in one of the large dining rooms.  So without having to deal with many of the annoyances it seems other people have had, I was seated immediately and the service was impeccable from start to finish. When I first walked in, my ears and eyes were immediately titillated. With the peppy live jazz that was playing in the background, I just kinda stood in awe and couldn't help but appreciate the opulence of the decorations. The thousands of wine bottles that adorn the bar, the leather walls, marble floors, hundreds of pieces of artwork and 6 foot handmade chandeliers just made it an amazing environment. I wasn't here to celebrate anything, but if I did indeed did have something to celebrate - this would be the place to live it up.   I had heard that this place cost $6 million to make and let me tell you that this place does indeed look like $6 million. I do want to say that as spacious and grandeur this restaurant is, i completely agree with the statement \"this place is a collection of intimate spaces,\" made by the owner. You can seriously have as private of a dinner as you want in one area and go all out with 15 friends in another. It's amazing how versatile the environment is. I don't think I've ever raved this much about a restaurants' decor and atmosphere, so you gotta believe me. even if you're in the area and have to use a bathroom, come in take a sneak peak inside and you'll be blown away.  On to the food...if you like to to know how much the food costs before you order, you should not eat here. For two people, budget at least $200. I was lucky enough to not have to worry about the cost on this evening, but at the end of the night I did ask myself, \"If I had to pay (what probably amounted to $120 for just me) would I do it ?\" And I think it's a really tough call. If you're in a financial situation where you do not have to worry about budgeting - then absolutely. But just for a regular Friday night outing on the town - it would be hard for me to justify doing so.   What did I eat? I'll only give you a few because I tried a lot.  They start you off with a bread basket that has bread sticks, fig bread and crispy onion focaccia...i made the all too common mistake of chowing down on this before the actual meal...the onion focaccia was way too dangerous.  Rhode Island Calamari: Best calamari I have ever had. You have no idea how many times I get calamari that is too salty or too peppery or too mushy or too etc, this had the perfect consistency, just the right blend of spices and was complimented really well with the dipping sauce (i forget the type, sorry). Usually I love lemon on my calamari, but this time it was so good that I didn't dare cheat any of the flavor by adding lemon.  Filet Mignon (9 oz) - You can hear this bad boy sizzle as they place it front of you and it lies there just dripping with sweats of taste. I ordered mine medium and it came out as pink as I could have wanted it. So full of yum - every little bite was it's own flavor rocket. If you have a family history of heart disease, or suffer from high cholesterol, coronary artery disease or general obesity - you will most likely have a heart attack after eating this. I felt like I was a New York Yankee during my meal...so over the top good and expensive.  Creamed Sweet Corn (double corn)...this was by far my favorite. i never imagined creamed sweet corn to be such an amazing side dish - but it was so creamy and it did reset my palate after a few bites of filet. A completely different spin on corn - one that I've never experienced.  By the time dessert came, I think I stopped caring. I was too full to move. I think dessert was creme brulee, which was....wait for it...it's a surprise....it was also good. I are it in 3 bites are went home to go straight to bed. Sorry creme brulee, I chowed you down so quickly that I probably didn't appreciate how sweet, warm, and crisp you were.  This is the perfect place to be spoiled or spoil a special someone....but be prepared to drop some serious coin."}
{"text":"After hearing reviews about Dominicks from several people, I finally had the chance to go. Many of what I have heard was hit or miss, with many people saying the food was extremely salty. That being said, walking in and being greeted by the 4 girls wasn't the best. The girls almost seemed to be bothered I was approaching them and asking a question...they barely looked up from the desk. The interior is very dark, kind of like City Hall.  As for the food, the bread basket was very good. Next, the appetizers we had were the meatballs and calamari. The meatballs were average at best, however the calamari was very, very good. Light, crispy, and cooked very well. This is where things started to go downhill fast. The servers were not friendly at all and not attentive at all. I normally drink only water with dinner, however, through the night, I had two glasses of water total. One that was sitting on the table when I arrived and one refill. I hardly think it's much to ask to refill water. Upon taking orders, the waitress seem to want to get through it as quickly as possibly. As for the main course, there were six of us at the table. In total, we ordered 3 filets, 1 salmon, 1 pork chop, and 1 whole chicken. The people who got the salmon and the chicken both said they were lacking flavor and didn't taste like much. The three filets looked completely different in size and shape (they were all 8oz). I ordered mine medium and it came out medium rare, another filet was ordered as medium and came out rare, and the last filet was ordered medium rare and came out rare. As for the taste of steak, the rub was decent, but overall, it was extremely salty. The broccoli was as good as I could make in my microwave, but the mashed potatos were very good.  Overall, the experience was lackluster at best. Comparing Dominick's to City Hall, Mastro's, Ocean Club, etc, Dominick's does not compare. Each time I've been to these other three, you can expect a good meal that is consistent. I would be hard pressed to go to Dominick's again. With the prices being relatively equal, I want to know I'm in for a good meal. It seems to me the owner's (apparently the old owners of Mastro's, Ocean Club, City Hall) are more concerned with glamour and glitz. If your food isn't good, I don't care what cars you have parked out your front door. If you want a good meal, skip this place and go to one of the other places mentioned, you won't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my wife's birthday and had s fantastic meal. The steaks were cooked to perfection. Excellent service as well."}
{"text":"The hostess told us they were booked till 8:00 on a Thursday night.  She got on the phone and asked if there was anything pool side.  What?  I wanted to sit in the main dining room but oh well.  We were escorted to the second floor where there was a second host stand, a bar and tables and chairs.  In the middle of the room is a pool of water.  I thought it was cute but my date was reminded of his near drowning incident.  He was nervous next to the pool which is where we were seated.  Liz and Wendy were fun.  They took care of us.  They got our cocktails just right.  Here is why I gave Dominicks three stars. Trout- Flavorless and a little burnt Asparagus- The sauce was weird tangy hollandaise Ceasar Salad- Nothing special, no anchovies Bad music selection-  karaoke versions of pop songs  Every Item is a la carte so the bill adds up pretty fast.  I think I will stick to Durants."}
{"text":"I have eaten here many time and I have always had a great experience. The service is amazing the food so delicious. I have had steak, fish seafood and it has all been so good! It's a plus in the Scottsdale quarter such a nice mall.  Not so much different than other fancy steakhouses but it is still great!!"}
{"text":"Four of us ate there last night.  Overall very disappointing with overpriced food and mediocre service.  We had a 7:30 reservation and didn't get seated till after 8:00 and only after reminding the staff how long we had been waiting.  Our main waiter was efficient and helpful but not big on personality.  We ordered Caesar salad and chopped salad and both were wilted and looked like they had been siting around for hours and we sent them back.  It took quite a while to get the steaks and sides that we ordered.  The 22 oz.rib-eyes were chewy-not a great cut for $49 a pop.  The 12 oz. petite filet mignon was a very good cut and was tasty.  The sauces- one bordelaise and one green peppercorn had a very strange underlying taste as though they were made from the same mix and not from scratch.  We let the maitre d know how disappointed we were and his response was \"what would you like me to do\" instead of showing any real concern as to our dissatisfaction.   Considering the top notch competition from Mastro' Steakhouse and Mastro's Ocean Club who do provide exceptional food and service this was the first and last time any of us will dine there again.   Total waste of time and money."}
{"text":"Great food! Really...it's the best we've had since moving to Scottsdale a few months ago. But the service was t-e-r-r-i-b-l-e. We couldn't get drink refills to save our thirsty little lives. No one cleared our plates. And the WORST moment of the evening: About 10 minutes into our dining experience, the music was turned up so loud, it seemed it would have been quieter to have our dinner at a night club. And the music stayed that incredibly loud even when we requested otherwise. It's not the ambiance we hoped for at a nice-candle-lit-white-table-cloth steak house. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Went to Dominick's to celebrate an anniversary with friends.  We were able to reserve a seat upstairs by the reflection pool.  We had a fantastic dinner and the service was excellent.  The steaks were delicious and we had the shishito peppers as an appetizer which were out of this world.  I love going to a steakhouse with high expectations and not being let down.  All in all, everything was classy and upscale, including the level of service.  Great place to celebrate a special occasion or romantic date."}
{"text":"Our excellent waiter, Dan, took care of us for dinner on December 7th. My mother's NY strip turned out great, my super large shrimps cocktail had an amazingly strong \"atomic horse radish\" on the side, and the recommended \"butter cake\" was amazing (not one morsal remained)!"}
{"text":"An exceptional experience from start to finish. We were seated promptly upon arriving around 10 minutes early for our reservation, without any issues. Waiter was excellent in every way, from suggesting items that were enjoyable, to stopping by at proper times for drink refills, and ensuring the food was cooked correctly. We started with the king crab and avocado stack, which was recommended by our server, and were very happy. Moving on to a couple of steaks, the NY strip and bone-in KC strip, both ordered and cooked medium rare. The 28 day wet aged steaks were phenomenal, lightly seasoned to allow the flavor of the beef to shine, and served on exceptionally hot plates. I am also fairly sure the steaks are intentionally cut visibly larger than the estimated sizes listed on the menu, nothing wrong with feeling like you got a larger steak than expected. If I had to find something to nitpick, I would say the music choice didn't feel that it fit the restaurant atmosphere, going between older and current songs.  Yes Dominick's is an expensive restaurant, but I absolutely felt that the food and service quality justify the prices that they charge. This is a hard task when two people dine for over $200 after one drink and gratuity."}
{"text":"Happened to try Dominicks and Eddie Vee's.  Between the two Dominicks wins by a mile. Food and ambience is way better and the wait staff is ready bay a moments notice. The happy hour steak and fries for $10 is perfectly proportioned."}
{"text":"This is one of the best Steakhouses I have been to the quality of the food and rich atmosphere made it a fantastic experience.The top floor roof open on nice evenings letting you see the night sky!:)"}
{"text":"I have eaten at every great steakhouse from Beverly Hills to Texas to NYC the bone in filet had as much flavor as a ribeye!"}
{"text":"Love this restaurant! Five stars for service and atmosphere. The burrata and PB&J appetizers are both delicious. If you are to choose just one, I would go with the burrata. I ordered the chilean sea bass and it was cooked to perfection.  The corn creme brûlée was sensational and the roasted brussels sprouts were delicious. The ambiance by the pool is fun and relaxing. This restaurant is worth the price if you are in north scottsdale."}
{"text":"This review is for NEW YEARS EVE ONLY!! !. My girlfriend and I had an 8:30 reservation and when we arrived there was a line out in front of the door. They were NOT ready for the 2nd seating and took almost 20 minutes to finally start getting everyone in and to their tables.  2. I ordered a very EXPENSIVE bottle of champagne and you would have thought the waiter would have taken care of us, but he pretty much ignored us. After he poured our champagne, he placed the champagne on the piano where ANYONE could have just poured themselves champagne from OUR BOTTLE. I had to ask him to get an ice bucket and move it NEXT to our table!! 3. The waiter took our order for appetizers  which was about 6 different options and he would bring them to us with sauces. He brought back our \"order\" but had lobster claws and only a couple of stone crab claws. I asked for what we ordered and he went back to get more. He came back with only 4 and said this was ALL they had they were out. OUT after only 30 minutes into service!!?? 4. We ordered a Caesar Salad for 2 and when they brought it we tried it and you could tell it was pre prepared as the lettuce was soggy and the salad was over dressed! 5 Dinner came and at least our steaks came out great. 6. The waiter brought us dessert (no choice on this huh?) and they were from a crappy pre prepared bakery complete with the paper on the bottom of both desserts. Both un edible.  7. This was by reservation ONLY, so for you to be so totally UNPREPARED on service, food etc is inexcusable!! For the prices you charge, you should be ashamed! 8. I have traveled around the world to some of the finest restaurants in major European cities and they know how to take care of their customers where you want to come back. Dominick's is arrogant and thinks they are the be all, end all. Guess what, you're NOT all that!! Restaurants are driven by customers and how you treat your customers will determine how well you will do. Unless you FIX your problems, not only will you fail for next New Years, but I can't see you being in business for long. In this economy restaurants are NOT a necessity and people will go where they are taken care of, as well as for the food. You're NOT cutting it with your customer service and for your sake, you need to take a good long look at how you're mistreating customers and change it. If not, you'll be another asterisk of \"and this was where Dominick's USED to be!!\""}
{"text":"Wow that's all we can say so so good!!  Beautiful inside with a great and professional staff!!  Highly recommended for date   Had another date night out and Dominick's always delivers a great meal and service!!  Brett was our server he did a awesome job taking care of us!! Thank you so much  Steaks were perfect and our drinks cold and perfectly done!!"}
{"text":"Dined at Dominick's last night, and unfortunately, was less than impressed.  I was really looking forward to checking this place out, as I am new to the area.  I compare this to the likes of Del Frisco's, Morton's, etc.  We had a reservation and were seated directly behind the \"band.\" It was so loud and we felt like we had one foot in the lobby! We asked to move and were seated in the wine room behind the bar. Much better, but still, the \"band\" was way too loud.   Let me address the \"band.\" This was one woman singing, and a man playing tracks from his computer. It was rough. The combination of song choice and her vocals was awful. It was impossible to ignore and really put a damper on the night.   The food was ok. In my opinion, way over priced. I am a frequent diner at upscale steak restaurants due to my job. Dominick's was nothing special but was a little but pricier than local competitors.  I do not think we will be returning. We would rather hit Ocean Club, Eddie V's, or Morton's for sure.  Such a shame, as the location and service were fantastic."}
{"text":"We like trying higher end steak houses around the valley so when we have a special occasion, we know where to go. This was our first trip to Dominick's. The service was on par with what you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. The meat was delicious. The sides were average to below average. We ordered macaroni and cheese, potatoes au gratin and creamed spinach. The macaroni and cheese was average. The potatoes au gratin were the best of the three sides. The creamed spinach was super disappointing with a heavy smoky flavor that obliterated every other flavor possibility for the dish. What surprised me, was that when I ordered iced tea, the server brought tea in a bottle to the table. I very much enjoy fresh brewed tea. The server was attentive and kept my glass full from the bottle sitting on the table. However, when asked if I would like a refill, a second bottle was brought to the table. The bill ended up showing I paid $12 for ice tea! None of the desserts got our attention, so we passed on the final course. We may try it again, but will continue the search for that perfect steakhouse with a stellar blend of service, meal quality, and upscale atmosphere."}
{"text":"My husband and I fell in love all over again at Dominicks! O.k., joking! We spent an evening, just us too basking in the wonderful atmosphere of Dominicks Steakhouse. I ordered the Ribeye and it melted in my mouth. The fried meatballs were good but I wouldn't order it again. The shrimp appetizer was amazing, the sauce was FANTASTIC! Service was awesome too but the steaks, OMG, so tender and full of flavor.  It's expensive. Our bill was $250 but it was a date night and we really needed to treat ourselves!!!  Oh and try the Italian Blood Martinis, HELLO BABY!!!! Order one because they give you the shaker and whats left in the shaker is the amount of another martini. Yeah baby!  We plan on going back for our anniversary."}
{"text":"Went with friends to Dominick's for Happy Hour last night! OMG!!! My mouth is still excited about the steak and scollops! and the shrimp were delicious too!  This has to be THE BEST HAPPY HOUR in all of Scottsdale!  Very inexpensive!  And they serve the martini's in the shaker so it stays cold and as the ice melts it makes another drink to pour! If the filet on the HH menu is anything like the steak in the restaurant, then this is the VERY BEST!!! and out wait person was so nice!!!  We will go back again and again!!!"}
{"text":"This place is super swank, great for people watching and the food/service are top notch.    Here are the highlights:  * bone in ribeye = awesome but a bit fatty just the way I like it.  Perfectly cooked and great flavor. * filet = melts in your mouth * shrimp coctail with atomic horse radish = how can shrimp as big as your hand be bad? * roast corn = sweet and crunchy * potatoes au gratin = potatoey cheesy goodness  Here are the lowlights:  * the wedge salad is sub-par  and not steakhouse quality at all * the bar area is too cramped and it was a mess for our waiters and servers to maneuver.  No way I'm sitting there for dinner next time.  I would however sit there and have some drinks while listening to the piano player/singer.  * no pretzel bread * yes everything is pretty pricey but its just about what other high-end steak joints are  Anyway, I can't wait to return and hope to do so ASAP!"}
{"text":"The food clearly was overpriced and the ala carte sides were not enough for one person-- the steak too was not five star--- I had never been there before but Houston's is a better deal and better food---- disappointed"}
{"text":"Five stars! Absolutely incredible staff, delicious food by an mp restive chef, cold cocktail (which are a must in Arizona), and an incredible experience. This is our go-to steakhouse to wow guests from out of town. We haven't disappointed anyone yet."}
{"text":"This was one of the best dinners I have had in my life. The food was out of this world, but the icing on the cake was our waiter Brad Wood and his assistant. He went above and beyond making my 2.5 year old son feel like he was an actual person at the table. He would talk with him and made him a fitted chefs hat. They made sure our son was taken care of so the rest of our party of 5 could enjoy our meal as well. The food was amazing, we had the crab cakes which was ALL crab, no filler, the scallops which were tender, the pork chops, petite filet and chilean sea bass. Everything was tender and flavorful without losing the flavor of the meats. The side dishes were to die for as well, I highly recommend the Corn Créme Bruleé. We frequent Scottsdale a lot from Houston and will be back. It's also great that Brad let us know that there is a sister restaurant in Houston and Chicago where both parties are from. Thank you for such a wonderful and memorable evening, we talked about it for the rest of our trip in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great,  we were greeted and seated right away.  Luke came to our table to check on us several times, to make sure everything was going well.  Great new management. I'm glad that we decided on coming here tonight!"}
{"text":"As long as I have lived here and been in Keirland I have never been in here. Had a guest from Miami who wanted a steak so we went and for good reason. First off they have complimentary valet which is nice and waters for when you are waiting, I mean it is Arizona so it's a nice touch and a continuance of the upscale ambience.   We didn't have reservations and went on a Saturday night and were seated right away. I was personally it dressed the way I would normally be and was concerned I wasn't going to be able to be \"accepted\" with my red Nikes on. However not one negative look or undertone or anything but acceptance and we were seated just as any other. Which was nice, next time I will look better for myself LOL.   We had the absolute pleasure of meeting Brad and Brett. Great guys and Brad really and I mean really took the time to chat with us, relate to us, interact and build a relationship within the timeframe he had with us. I was impressed and him being am original in Dominick's he never lost the fire or seemed burnt out. Just being personal and going the extra mile to make sure we enjoyed every second of the experience, he delivered. Thanks Brad for making it happen. Brett also did great and made sure we were taken care of and also very pleased with how they worked with each other. They get it. Yes going to a place like this I am expecting the best service but everyone knows we are people and people fail, they didn't one step at all.   They have warm garlic butter bread in a personalized skillet and that was awesome to start. I had the medallion steal filet, lobster Mac and the noodles were money, and sweet creme brûlée sweet corn which was fantastic. The filet came on a smoking hot plate and hearing the sizzle when the sides were added just brought the experience to life. I love steal and I have been to many steakhouses in the past this one is up here. I loved every bit of it. Done and done. We had some ice cream dessert and it was a nice touch to the night. My guest also enjoyed the experience immensely.   Brad will be the one I will come back to for sure. It's always good to have great experiences and I am very pleased."}
{"text":"Beautiful new steakhouse in Scottsdale!  The decor was really well done and it was interesting that they had a pool area upstairs...I am imagining that could be quite a scene on the weekends.  The service was helpful and attentive.  The food was quite good, but pricey and very large portions.  A friend and I shared a salad, the halibut and two sides (asparagus & corn).  Everything was delicious though!"}
{"text":"WOW! Let me start with this was the best dining experience of our lives. We made reservations months in advance for Valentine's Day & I'm glad I did. This place was packed & rightfully so. The service is second to none. The waiter Jeff took very good care of us. The appetizers were awesome & the drinks were top shelf. They allowed to us to mix our own soft drink in the more than adequately poured glass. The steaks and seafood was first rate. The 22 oz ribeye is the way to go. Aged, seasoned & cooked perfectly. My wife had the 8 oz & was blown away. The lobster mash, baked potato, mac & cheese, asparagus & mushrooms were to die for. The sides were large enough to share with the other couple that accompanied us. For the two of us, we got out of there for $200. Well worth the cost for a beautiful experience. We have decided that Dominick's is our new favorite restaurant. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Had my birthday dinner last Thursday.  Food was only fair but the service was very disappointing.  Empty bottles were left on the table, had to ask for water refills, waiter did not know this was a special occasion in spite of the information given in the reservation.  The waiter was not knowledgeable about the menu items (other than the steak), forgot the side dishes.  We had oysters and they were sandy.  The main courses looked as if they were just tossed onto the plates.  The \"Valli\" cheescake was made with so much whipped cream it was just too rich. When compared with the Capitol Grille, they are really a distant second."}
{"text":"My husband had a work function in Scottsdale.  It was for 4 days and for 1 of the days, we were able to go to an off-site restaurant.  My husband picked Dominick's because of the great reviews on Yelp.  We had a private room upstairs and it was called poolside dining.  The \"pool\" was about 6 inches deep and it was a pretty decent size, where if you weren't looking at where you're walking, you'll easity fall in.   Our menu was preordered so we had the following served samily style except for our steak. Caesar Salad - Very good, I loved the dressing. Fried Calamari - Very good, not a lot of batter and the marinara sauce was delicious Crab Cakes - Not my favorite.  It had more bread crumbs than crab. Meatballs - I highly recommend!!!  Lots of flavor and good meaty texture, it would have been perfect over pasta.  Bone-in Ribeye - it was cooked Medium Rare and it melted in my mouth.  The steak was still sizzling when it got to my table.   Sweet Peas - Delicious.  it was cooked perfectly.  It was crunchy but didn't taste raw.  Lobster Mac N Cheese - Just Order, that's all I have to say. Sauteed Mushrooms - You can never go wrong with mushrooms!!!  I highly recommnend this place, I love it even more because it was in an outdoor upscale mall :) :)  The perfect paring :) :)"}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Sat night for a glass of wine.  Cool place. It has an old NY steakhouse feel to it.  Wife and I had a couple great glasses of wine and the entertainment was awesome.  Wine - seemed expensive for a glass but we liked the vibe so decided to have a glass anyway. The pour is about a glass and a half so any thoughts I had about price quickly went away. And, the service was really good in the bar area.  Entertainment - there was a lady singing that was incredible. She was just chillin in a booth singing Adele, Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, you name it. Awesome! Lastly, the people watching was great. Lots of sugar daddy's with their lady friends.  Cool place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came for dinner and had a fabulous experience. The ambiance was upscale but still casual. I had the bone in filet and he had the bone in ribeye, both excellent. We will definitely return."}
{"text":"I've been here for the last three weeks in a row and I just love it.  The steak is cooked perfectly, the ambience couldn't be more swanky, and I just feel at home when I see the artwork of the glasses saying cheers to a great time.  Also, their pours on glasses of wine are FAT.  Well worth the $14 - $39 a glass whatever it is you may be ordering.  Stay away from the 401k though.  Spend the extra $2-$3 and get something thats not from \"California.\"  The Porterhouse was amazing, best creamed spinach anywhere, and the mushrooms were perfect.  I also liked how the waiter hurried my wine to my table as soon as the steak got there!  That is a level of service reserved for the best of the best.  Finish the night off with their butter cake, and you can't go wrong.  It's not cheap, but it's truly one of life's great pleasures to be served such a spectacular meal and not have to clean up after.  Well worth the $300 price tag."}
{"text":"Great accommodations for a group of 8.  The food was fantastic.  Great drinks and service to top it off, including a complimentary \"donut tree\" for dessert.  Highly recommend upstairs seating near pool."}
{"text":"First time here last night to celebrate Valentine's day and I loved it overall! Food was sooo good! Pricey but well worth it. The waitress did an excellent job best one yet, and loved how she could explain all the food and her enthusiasm on how good the food was!she wasn't lieing! Only thing I did not like was that we took our food home and it wasn't the whole amount that they had taken from our table to pack."}
{"text":"Yes!!! I have found my new favorite happy hour spot. Sorry I enjoyed thoroughly my meal too quickly to get a photo! The sangria is fantastic and a great pour. The filet with bleu cheese sauce is now my absolute favorite. I'll be back soon!!!! If I could add happy face emojis I would!! WOW great drinks and food and reasonable prices for the quality. Make this place your next stop."}
{"text":"Went for a graduation celebration with a party of 7. Service and food (a mix of steak and seafood dishes as well as sides and desserts ) were excellent , all cooked to order. staff were attentive and the atmosphere was great. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Best steak I've had out in Phoenix. I ordered the New York and thought it was more flavorful than the fillet. Loved the modern atmosphere.  I will definitely return!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the food was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! Best Filet I have ever had. I made reservations for my boyfriends 31st Birthday and we were seated up stairs next to the pool which was different from any other restaurant and a nice touch. When we started to order the appetizer our waiter said \"is this your first time here\"? In a very snooty way. I guess we ordered the appetizer wrong?! So immediately I was annoyed because it's unnecessary. The place was really loud and there was drunk idiotic people screaming and getting into the pool all around us. Thankfully the manager put a stop to it. We both ordered the filet which was amazing with the crab mac and cheese side. My boyfriend also received a complimentary desert which was great it made the night a bit more special. Over all the place is nice, I am giving it 4 starts due to the noise level and our snooty waiter."}
{"text":"As a frequent traveler into Scottsdale, I was looking for something new and different to celebrate with a young up and coming professional baseball player---who happens to be my nephew. We were forewarned this place had no prices on their online menu and appeared to be owned by Mastro's which consistently has excellent food.   Michael Dominick opened Dominick's Lincoln Avenue Prime Steakhouse last fall after baseball season in the small, but excellent Scottsdale Quarter. (I'll admit to frequenting this Nike store in travels to Phoenix.) The ambiance is that of an elegant steakhouse. The rooms are dark with huge crystal chandeliers. Very opulent without being ostentatious!.   We both ordered the bone-in filet which is an excellent aged prime cut. Supposedly, according to our very professional server, this cut is about 16 oz with a bone yielding about a 14 oz serving. My limit on steak is typical 6-8 ounces and I ate my entire meal, making me think (1) This place really is THAT GOOD, and (2) I doubt this is more than a 10 oz serving.   We started with a warm assortment of breads and in deference to my guest, we minimized the veggie's ordered. (I'll go back during baseball season :-) )   After ordering a glass of of the extensive, but reasonably priced wine list, we looked at dinner entree. The steaks come with a choice of rubs and sauces. The house rub was described as \"cajun-style, but not overwhelming\". My theory is sauces on steaks are useful for poor cuts of meat, but take away from great cuts; hence, I went no sauce.   The result was an incredibly great dinner of Bone-in filets ordered medium rare, no sauce and a loaded mashed potato side. (This side comes pre-prepared or you can ask for ramikans of cheese, chives, bacon and sour cream and build as you like at the table. We finished with a scoop of ice cream and a cappuccino for desert.   Excellent steak spot and a welcome high-end addition to the Scottsdale food scene.  One comment: The \"Branding\" of the restaurant is confusing. Either call it \"Dominick's\" or \"Lincoln Avenue\", but not both. This actually caused confusion in trying to locate this spot and diminishes the feng shui and brand loyalty you'd want to keep and associate. (Qualifier: I'm not a branding expert and this is strictly my opinion.)   I would love to see Mastro's try a southwest cuisine spot!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing!! The steak was the perfect portion, and the sides, hassleback potatoes were delightful. Our waiter was so very pleasant and kind. The atmosphere was relaxing and sexy. A wonderful night all around with great food and service!"}
{"text":"We went for Happy Hour and sat in the bar.  All the bar food was good and the discounted cocktails hit the spot. This is definitely still a hot and trendy spot worth taking a friend to!  Although the previous visit for a full meal wasn't up to par.....try the bar!"}
{"text":"We went for a happy hour after work on a Friday.  We had the filet and scallops app...sooooo good.  Both were perfectly prepared, but the filet was the favorite for both of us.  We also had the calamari.  Also, very fresh and tasty.  We'll be back for another happy hour or dinner soon."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. Julio was our server I would suggest asking for him. We were celebrating our 32nd Wedding Anniversary and they brought us an anniversary dessert of warm Benoit. The managers Danny and Tim were very nice and stopped to check on us and thank us for coming. Wonderful one of the best."}
{"text":"When you spend this much on food you expect a high level of food and service. The servers are always friendly and I always feel like I get what I pay for at Dominick's."}
{"text":"Went for Happy Hour with a very special friend and we had a blast!  Great server (Amanda)   She was super attentive, smiles and laughs.  She did great!  House Vodka martini with goat cheese stuffed olives were amazing, tried the filet and  scallops appetizer and it was fantastic.  Then the incredible meatballs and home made bread!  All in all, wonderful evening.  We will be back!  Thank you."}
{"text":"I hosted a 14 girl dinner at Dominck's and I couldn't of asked for anything better. Our waiter Austin was fantastic. He was attentive to all of our needs, kind, and able to make great recommendations. He enhanced our stay tremendously. We also rented a beautiful room with a spacious table that was set so we all were able to look at one another and not just stacked in a long line.   The food was delicious. Every morsel! We ordered things from king crab to steak, to poke and it all was cooked perfectly. Portion sizes were perfect and the family style sides made the group truly come together. We also finished off the dinner with Austin recommended desserts and everyone had a third stomach open up as they arrived at the table.   To Victoria and Madison, thank you for making this night a possibility, you are known around town as one of the best steak houses and I conquer. We will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Steaks are amazing. Lobster is amazing. Bread is of course amazing. BUT, hands down the best service we have ever had! My husband and I love to visit Doms whenever we have a free night. We have popped in once very dressed down while doing some Christmas shopping and I love an upscale restaurant that doesn't care what you wear. We have always received the best service here! 6 stars from us!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed an absolutely delicious meal at Dominick's with a large group of friends and family. They have a great menu - any size of steak you can imagine from filet mignon to tomahawks the size of a cricket bat. The sides and some of the appetizers are meant to be shared family-style. Great place to come for a drink and enjoy live music in their beautifully-decorated bar, with their extensive wine and cocktail menus.  Overall our service was very good. However, my ONLY point for improvement was that the server commented that he was under-tipped which was actually not the case. I felt that this was in poor taste to openly comment to customers that their tip was too low, regardless of the fact that we had left a substantial tip."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Dominick's - by far the best steakhouse in the Phoenix area.    However, the one complaint I have is the recent change they have made to their bread service.  They used to bring a beautiful basket of assorted breads including pretzel rolls and an amazing onion focaccia.  Last time I went, they brought out a little cast iron skillet filled with yeast rolls that weren't even very flavorful.  The server informed us that this was their new bread service.  I was sorely disappointed as this silly skillet with a kitchen towel wrapped around the handle really cheapens the Dominick's experience.  If management reads this, I truly hope they will consider changing back.    Other than that, Dominick's is truly fantastic and the steaks melt in your mouth.  Happy hour is amazing as well."}
{"text":"I arrived 25 mins early for my reservation to enjoy a pre-dinner cocktail as I usually like to scope out the place before enjoying dinner.  My Manhattan was made quickly, precisely to my request, with the utmost attention to detail.  I pay attention to the small things; even the weight of the glass felt good in my hand.  I didn't mind my party was 20 minutes late, the live music was pleasant and the Scottsdale scenery was better than it normally is - after all, proper attire is required per the sign posted out front.  Once seated and our cocktail order put in, or waiter explained the menu to us - at length.  Agreed we had not been there before, but do I need every item explained to me?  That aside, my mouth was watering from all the delicious choices!  Our table ordered the salmon both ways (comes either breaded and fried, or butter/oil braised0, the filet, and Idaho Trout.  Sides included asparagus and scalloped potatoes.   The trout came only one way, breaded, and was delicious.  I can't say I was a fan of the sauce, a ranch/mayo like dressing that was too tangy and heavy for the mild and succulent 12oz trout.  The filet was everything one envisions a steak to be - sizzling, dripping with goodness.  Ordered medium, of course, the filet was the perfect amount of red in the middle.  I preferred the breaded salmon over the braised.  Slimy may not be an appropriate word, but the braised salmon was too oily which affected the texture.  Breaded is definitely the way to go.  Oh, and the dessert.  We had both the chocolate and banana fosters cakes, which were divine.  It was a dark chocolate lava cake with the best of liquid chocolate in the middle; while the banana fosters cake had a brown sugar, creme, sliced banana filling that was completely unreal.  So good there was nothing left."}
{"text":"A truly wonderful evening. My wife and I were in town for a golf weekend and this turned out to be our best dining experience. The ribeye was cooked perfectly. We order our steaks Pittsburgh medium rare and most other steak houses just don't do it correctly. Not the case here. The wine selection was great. The service was absolutely top shelf. Will definitely make it a must go to destination on our next trip to the Phoenix-Scottsdale area"}
{"text":"We went to Dominick's Saturday night and I have to say it was great! Everything from the service to the food was spot on.  We usually go to Mastros  but after finding out the Mastros group started a new restaurant, we had to give it a try.  Wow, were we please, they are definitely are giving Mastros a run for their money. Keep up the good work.........we will be back! Two thumbs up Dominick's!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has great steaks! We rented a private room for a birthday last year. Everything was good, but for the price I'm not sure we would go back again. They have very similar quality steak to some more affordable steakhouses. It was fun to try it once tho, but I think ill stick with mastros. If you do go here be sure to try the chocolate cake, the size is huge and really good!"}
{"text":"We were in town for our 25th anniversary and decided to try Dominick's and so glad we did. The ambiance was great a little noisy but still very relaxing. Jonathan our server was great as well. The food, OMG was out of this world. One of the best bone in filet I have ever had. Cooked to perfection. My wife's fish dish was just as good. The appetizer Shrimp Cocktail w/ Atomic horseradish was fantastic. I highly recommend Dominick's if in the Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"My husband and I had an incredible experience for our first time trying Dominick's Steakhouse. Very elegant, fine dining experience. We loved our servers Kim & Ethan! They were both fantastic! We loved their recommendations. The crispy shrimp appetizer, 19 crimes red wine, and the ultimate warm vanilla caramel cake were our favorites! We would love to come back again."}
{"text":"Sadly, I can definitely say we weren't impressed. I made our reservation on Open Table for 6:30 on a Thursday. I requested a booth for date night with my Wife. We were hoping to have a quiet dinner in what we thought was an upscale venue where clients would be dressed accordingly. The hostess seated us  between two other tables which were no more than maybe 30 inches away. It wasn't a booth at all but rather booth like upholstery on a bench up against the wall that had 3 tables total. I guess to her that was a booth.There were no booths, at least where we were. Absolutely no privacy. As far as the clientele being dressed accordingly, lets just say shorts and tennis shoes abounded throughout. My Wife and I like to dress nice for dinner and we were for the most part overdressed. Let's move on to the insane noise level. Who has a radio playing at a self titled upscale venue????? Billy Joel was singing \"Piano Man\" and quite frankly for me to hear it having spent my entire adult life around commercial aircraft, it has to be REAL loud...it was. People were trying to talk over it and it was chaotic. My Wife couldn't hear our server yet when it's quiet, she can hear my beard growing. He had to repeat often. On to the food. We both ordered the 8oz Filet, Mac and Cheese and Creamy Potatoes as our shared sides. My Filet was without a doubt, in my top ten, served piping hot and kept hot on a heated plate, AWESOME. My Wife's, a completely different story. I noted she was not eating after just a couple of bites, I asked her why and she said \"Try it\" I did, but I don't know what happened to it or if it accidentally touched something else while it was cooking but it was flat nasty. $50 and two bites and that's all she wrote. The Mac and Cheese was simply some pasta with cheese baked onto it. Very dry, no creamy melted cheese, just dry cheese flavored pasta. The \"Creamy Potatoes were delicious, no complaints there. We were seriously just going to leave when I finished my Dinner (She quit eating her steak altogether) as it was so incredibly loud and chaotic we just had had enough, but having vested so much effort coming to this place, we agreed to skip dessert and decided instead to have coffee. It was delicious, loved it, both of us. We didn't tell our waiter about her steak as we didn't want to prolong our visit any more than we had to as it was so loud. So........to summarize, it took me (yes me) an hour to iron my clothes to look nice for my Wife, an hour one way travel time to dine at an insanely loud venue. 2 drinks, 2 Filet's, 2 sides and 2 coffee's $202. Honestly the best part of this experience is when we left the restaurant and waited outside in the peace and quiet while the Valet retrieved our car.  For those of you that might be inclined to say this venue has booth seating...   Definition: A seating area in a restaurant with a table and seats whose HIGH BACKS serve as partitions.....Google it.  Disappointing"}
{"text":"The stars are for the service.. impeccable service there was never a moment anyone was without anything. The food was ok.. nothing special at all. The sides were sloppy and basic the corn was not fresh. I had a steak and it was ok not great not bad by any means.. decent but no where near a high end steak house. The place is very loud and the tables are tightly packed."}
{"text":"really excellent service. a little bit of a strange crowd, but whatever. the food was great.   they start you off with this really yummy garlic parmesan bread served in a little cast iron skillet. i had to stop myself from eating too much of it! got to save room for the steak.   we ordered a bottle of wine and started with the PB&J. if you're debating which starter to have, definitely go with the PB&J...the bourbon isn't overwhelming, the pate is super smooth and the crostini a perfect complement. not too heavy either, so you can leave your appetite for the main course.  i ordered the bone in ribeye. it was served on an extremely hot plate and cooked to PERFECTION. it stayed warm throughout the meal even as i took my time to savor each bite.  for sides we ordered the dominick's potatoes. get those for sure. also ordered veg, our server recommended keeping it simple with those so we got the brussels.  finished off the meal with a bit of sorbet and the cutest most delicious little cookies. i can only hope my next steak is executed just as well!"}
{"text":"Couldn't imagine a better way to spend my two year wedding anniversary then at this beautiful steakhouse with my husband the service was excellent all the servers & servers assistants were very attentive and sweet the food was absolutely wonderful it definitely lived up to our expectations as well as our dessert. I would recommend asking for Ethan he is wonderful made us feel very welcome and took amazing care of us. We will be back definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Can't believe I haven't reviewed this restaurant yet.  Excellent ambience, great food, great service.  We went with a party of 8, the wait staff was very attentive, without being intrusive.  I had the chilled shrimp appetizer which was excellent, as was the petite filet I had as an entrée.  My wife also had the shrimp, and then the lobster tails, which were amazing."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely phenomenal. I took my girlfriend here for Valentine's Day and we got top-notch service. We ordered the seafood tower which had the Oysters and the jumbo shrimp. Delicious. I had a ribeye steak and my girlfriend ordered the Filed. The steaks were perfectly prepared. The dessert was phenomenal too. If you come here, I highly recommend sitting upstairs by the shallow pool. Very romantic and our server was a real gentl man. A+"}
{"text":"Steak good, not great. Place is crammed. Atmosphere good. More of a palce to be seen.  City Hall is better I think for steaks.    And yes they do have a website. Thing is when they opend, I googled them \"Dominick's steakhouse Scottsdale\" after getting to the 4th page and didn;t see them, I figured no website. It would have helped if there was a link to their website on the YELP's review page. There still isn't a link to their website on this page. Strange."}
{"text":"This place was top notch. Steaks were amazing. Side dishes were delicious. Service was perfect. I would have given it 5 stars, except for the fact that we sat by the mini-pool upstairs and the AC froze us to death. They opened the roof which my wife loved, and the air handlers were still blowing. I will definitely go back, but I won't sit by the pool ever again!"}
{"text":"we came here for the happy hour on a Friday - long wait for a table and the bar was full. Despite the wait, the food was surprisingly good for the HH specials, which were only $10 each. The crab cakes and scallops and steaks met our high expectations. Fried calamari and shrimps were decent but not outstanding. The batter outside could be more crispy, and the calamari pieces were kinda small. The portion for the dish was pretty big though.   The waiter dropped the sauces onto my sunglasses and phone, but they cleaned up pretty quickly and gave us a free dessert. I will come back for a proper dinner for test our their entries and customer services one more time.   Overall,  it would be great to add a bit more \"high touch\" to our experience, from both the food and services perspectives."}
{"text":"Best steakhouse in Az. Food is excellent. The best huge Shrimp Cocktail ever. NY Strip is perfect. The chopped and the super food salads is fresh and tasty. We had a problem weeks ago. It was handled beautifully by our server Rebecca and management. Not many place would have handled as well as you. We have always been regulars. And that will continue. But I do miss the old bread basket!   If only the best will do, then Dominick's is your choice. From the top notch service to a very fine dinner and dessert. They are tops. It can be a bit loud, but it seems like that's a problem in all fine dining places."}
{"text":"I wasn't feeling great when I went, but the service was good and the food was decent.  Will give it another chance when I'm feeling better:)"}
{"text":"A great steakhouse in a great location. The food and ambiance are top notch at Dominicks. Their ambiance and decor are unlike any other upscale steakhouse around. Being in the Scottsdale Quarter is also a plus for after dinner hang outs.    From time to time, the service does lack the quality and attention to detail expected from such a restaurant and the steaks are not always prepared the way they should be. The consistency is not quite there when compared to a rival like City Hall.   Regardless, Dominick's is a great place to be! Cant go wrong."}
{"text":"Had a awesome dinner there, steak great baked potato and Brussels sprouts. Waiter was excellent, overall 5 stars .tell your friends"}
{"text":"As I passed the velvet rope flanked by shiny, exotic cars I knew I was in for an experience.  Some might call it a fine-dining experience, but clearly this was something more.  A tribute to opulence and Regan-era excess, Dominick's is your seven-figure foodie fantasy come alive; from the moment you enter the swanky foyer to the gleaming 10 inch tower of tiramisu that finishes your meal.  It's glittery, bedazzled, and oozing pretension - and I loved it.  The Service My visit to Dominick's was the night after it's official opening.  The service tried very hard to be as impeccable as the surroundings and, while not perfect, the charming staff and the sincere effort put forth made little things like missing napkins and bread plates instantly forgivable.  Our server, Drew, let us know that the wait staff only had 2 - 3 tables each and it was very evident in the personal service we received.  A few more weeks of experience for the staff should easily iron out the little wrinkles.  The Food We started with the jumbo shrimp appetizer, which unfortunately came with 3 shrimp - hardly conducive to sharing - so we ordered two. And \"Jumbo\" they certainly were, accompanied by a kicky cocktail sauce which my dinner companion felt was spicy enough.  Ever the daredevil, I added additional horseradish to mine because who doesn't like to burn the inside of their nostrils at dinner. For the main course we both had the 9-oz filet, lobster gnocchi and steamed asparagus.  My filet was a perfect rare-plus with a dark pink center, expertly seared and juicy. Surprisingly the lobster gnocchi really stole the show for me.  I'm not big on starches or cream sauces so when it was suggested I wasn't particularly excited; I should have been.  The dough was light and fluffy, the cream sauce not too rich and the lobster added the perfect amount of salt & texture. After dinner I indulged in a grand marnier while my companion ordered the tiramisu.  He was presented with a 10 inch tall hunk of cake that could easily have been intended for 4 people.  The tiramisu was spongy and light, with a lovely cool custard and only a subtle flavor of rum.  A nice finish to an excellent meal.    Atmosphere We were lucky enough to score a poolside table which started off as very romantic but over the course of the evening became quite the place for people watching.  The scene at the small bar area on the 2nd floor was bustling and both the waiters and I wondered aloud how long it would be before a guest fell in the pool.  I bet they didn't make it through the weekend without someone making a splash."}
{"text":"Gorgeous interior, friendly and helpful staff, and great food!  I'm a vegetarian and found great options here( the beet salad was incredible ).  My husband loved his steak and we will definitely be back when we return to Scottsdale in the spring. Thanks for a great evening!  Do you ever have live music?"}
{"text":"We had such an awesome time at Dominick's Steakhouse. The clients were impressed with drinks, food and service; and if the clients are happy so am I. Thank you for a creative and professional establishment to bring cool people to enjoy."}
{"text":"Dominick's is a beautiful restaurant!  It's absolutely stunning!  The problem is that the food is so rich and just over the top with oil and butter on everything they prepare!  All night long after the meal, I felt the effects of the food and felt pretty lousy as did my husband.  In addition this is one of the priciest restaurants we've ever eaten at.  So you have to ask yourself, is it worth it?  My answer is no unless you have money to burn and don't care if you gain three pounds in one meal."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service. Our server (Tina) was tremendously helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. Food was top notch, one of the best steaks I've ever eaten. Can't wait to visit the area again so we can bring the rest of the family to Dominick's."}
{"text":"SO glad the Mastro family has retained the old Mastros quality. Brings me back to Mastros in the early 2000s before it sold to those who now cut corners.  Treat yourself to a margarita but make sure Daniel makes it because his are THE BEST. By the way the scallops in the lemon butter sauce are amazing too!"}
{"text":"Best Maryland Style Lump Crab Cake!"}
{"text":"I've been to Dominick's twice now.  As Charles Dickens wrote in \"A Tale of Two Cities\", \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.\"  My first visit I dined at a nice table upstairs by the pool.  That meal was fantastic and my experience was similar to Marsella M's epic review which will surely be a ROTD in the near future.  This recent visit was upsetting.  Dining alone at the bar I ordered a glass of wine, a filet mignon and a side of creamed spinach.  Before my food order was rung in the bartender asked for my credit card.  \"Are you sure?\" I asked.  Yes, he said, it's management's policy.  I challenged him and told him it's always at the server's discretion.  Grudgingly, I handed over my card.  The food itself was very good but I had a very bitter taste in my mouth from the credit card debacle.  Two prominent food writers I know were sitting at the corner of the bar.  I asked if they were asked for their credit card when they ordered their food and wine and they said no.  They were both aghast when I told them about my experience.  After paying my bill and leaving a 20% tip, despite my tremendous dissatisfaction, I asked to speak to the manager.  I was told that it was company policy to ask for a credit card.  When I informed him that my friends weren't asked for theirs he told me that when I come back they'll treat me like a regular and won't ask for my card.  Come back again?  Are you kidding me?  Next time I want a steak I'll go to Eddie V's where they know me by name."}
{"text":"I want to give this place 5 stars but my steak had some inconsistencies that just fell short of 5 stars.  The meat itself was 10 stars... absolutely a perfect bone-in ribeye.  Where it fell short was the seasoning which was excellent but certain areas of the steak had too much salt.. so the perfect bite was awesome but the next was much too salty,  so that's on the cook.  The butter also makes this a verrrrrryyyy rich steak.  I almost wish I had the option of just salt pepper garlic for my seasonings.  I don't know if I had that option by was not givin the option.  My server was fantastic.  Was it good hell yea but almost too rich for my taste.  At 60-100 bucks for a steak I would expect more options.  Would I return yea but would have to tell them salt and pepper only."}
{"text":"We were there for the official first night, last night. I had the bone in fillet,which was exceptional,and my husband ordered the bone in veal chop. Maryland crab cake and meatballs were our appetizers.  Everything was first class, hot, delicious, perfect! Our server, Elizabeth was a delight,on the ball and well informed by the kitchen. The lavish surroundings complete the picture.  Staff were friendly, and knowledgable. Great bar area. Food cannot be too expensive, when it is that good, but be prepared to pay for the finest grade of aged meat, and fresh fresh seafood.  If I have one small criticism, it would be that the tables are too closely grouped, making it difficult for the less experienced servers (water bearers) to navigate without bumping into the diners on chairs in their path. Seems to be many different levels, making it a visually appealing restaurant, but perhaps a bit of an obstacle course."}
{"text":"Dominick's was on the list of places I wanted to try for quite some time, so when my parents asked where I wanted to go to celebrate my recent birthday, I didn't hesitate with my answer.  We did have a lovely meal -- mostly because of the fabulous company, and it is indeed an elegant feeling steakhouse, but service was not amazing, salads were nothing special, and neither was the steak.    The complimentary bread basket was good, and the sides we had were excellent (creamed spinach, asparagus, and shoestring fries).  But for the prices we paid, I'd go to Ocean Club or City Hall next time in a heartbeat over Dominick's.  Not much more to say than that!"}
{"text":"Always an awesome dinner experience. However, I am very disappointed by their recent music change. Instead of live music in the bar area they now play a random mix. A mix that goes all across the board from lady gaga to frank Sinatra. It is really unimpressive, please switch back to the live music or at least some sort of playlist that's not as awkward!"}
{"text":"\"DONE with DOMINICK's\"........Just got back from my first Happy Hour at Dominick's.  Although I have had dinner there on multiple occasions, some frieds have been urging us to try their Happy Hour, supposedly one of the most popular ones in the area.  Let me start with saying from a food standpoint and the service staff.......top notch all the way.  The filet and scallops appetizer was incredible.  But I am getting sick and tired of the finer restuarants, or any retail establishment for that matter, playing games with the public and our pocketbooks.  So the menu says \"Any Well $7\" and \"Any Call $8\".  It would appear that their interpretation of \"ANY\" is somewhat different from what I recollect from my school days even though we are going back a few years, OK a few decades.  Nevertheless, I proceed to order several \"Crown Royal and Cokes\".  When the bill arrives at the end of the evening, the drinks are listed on the tab at $11 each.  When I inquired about this I was informed \"Oh, those are not included in the Happy Hour specials\".  I said \"any\" means \"any\" doesn't it and she replies \"Oh yeah, we\"ve been meaning to get that changed\"..............REALLY?..............are you kidding me?  I mean we're talking about Crown Royal, a middle of the road at best Canadian whiskey.  We're not talking about \"Heny IV Cognac\".........when I asked what bourbon waws part of the Happy Hour special I was informed \"Bacardi\"...........lol.........I mean really where do tehy find these people.  On the scale of 1-10, I would give the food, servie, and atmosphere an 11.  But be it petty to some, I am tired of the \"games\" played at some establishments.  I will miss this place, it was ideal for taking business associates and clients.........................but in this day and age there are too many other options to spend this kind of money to enjoy a good \"BACARDI\"................."}
{"text":"Great dinner. We sat at the bar, the food and the bartenders were fantastic. After requesting clarifications on the domestic wagyu ( 8-12 rating which should be fantastic).. we settled on the bone rib eye,shisito peppers and sprouts.  Ribeyes were perfect @ a medium and peppers were excellent. Lucky made perfect cocktails while being attentive to our orders and providing stellar recommendations . Amy took over after and closed out everything we needed."}
{"text":"Quickly becoming a favorite. Very nice bar and excellent service. Definitely a pricey place but they have reasonable wine if you want to avoid the $12 cocktails.  The food is always good: filet, sides, appetizers, and that bread! The happy hour menu is good but the portions sure are small. If you go earlier in the evening (before 6pm) the dining room is pretty empty and there will be plenty of waiters to serve you.  The atmosphere inside is very nice whether you are on the bar side or on the dining room.  Definitely worth a shot if you're celebrating something or just feel like some having protein."}
{"text":"Am I in steak heaven.... but they don't just have amazing steaks their damn calamari is LIFE TO ME!!!!  Yes, I know calamari.... here I am thinking it's all about the STEAK..... no people, this is the best calamari ever.  I know I should be telling you about \"What an amazing, juicy steak I had .\"   Nope, I had the calamari which was brought to my table with a side of horseradish and a mayo tater sauce that was  devine.  The calamari is lightly fried with jalapeno.  It's so good.   Don't judge me fellow Yelpers!"}
{"text":"Dominick's was one of the best dining experiences that I've had. We have always seen it in Scottsdale Quarter when shopping, and finally a couple months ago we decided to try. We sat in the lounge while we waited for a table to be ready. I got a Lemon Drop and we got the Calamari to start. The Calamari was some of the best that I've ever had, plus it came with three different sauces so there were a lot of options taste wise. For my entree I got the Scallops and the Brussel Sprouts which were both very good, though I've had better scallops. Finally they gave us cookies as a complimentary dessert which were very rich and delicious! Definitely want to come back again!"}
{"text":"Went hear with a group of people. It was a very nice place to go have dinner. The service was excellent. The food was delicious. Will go here again."}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere but music was so loud, we couldn't hear anything the waiter said and our ears were hurting for days after. We asked management to lower the music but they refused. I guess they think people will buy more drinks if the music is louder. It honestly ruined our evening and we won't be back. Mastros has better for and you can hear yourself think."}
{"text":"This place is great! I celebrated my birthday here and I was not disappointed. You will get what you will pay for   A beautiful, and classy place. Our food was good and my drinks was amazing! Our server was polite and knowledgable.  She made us feel comfortable and welcome! My husband did great job choosing this place for my birthday! Thank you."}
{"text":"They have amazing happy hour here. Caitlyn is an amazing and sweet blonde bartender. She remembers our drinks every time we come in without fail. That is why we continue to come back to Doms."}
{"text":"Best place ever! We truly love it here. Food is amazing, service is great, & atmosphere is the best!"}
{"text":"This and Steak 44 are the same owners and same concept (for the most part)... So either location with blow you away! I still suggest dining at both, just to experience the elegance and beauty of these restaurants!  Dominick's is hands down my favorite steakhouse in AZ. Whether you come for the well-priced Happy Hour, or do a nice sit down dinner at a table, you with be pleased in either scenario.  Kevin always provides me and my family with excellent service on the dining floor, and good ol Dan always makes a perfect martini behind the bar.  Try the NY strip of any size, it's definitely a gem. The sides are all wonderful, particularly the Brussel sprouts. Butter cake isn't called \"Butter Cake\" anymore... But ask about it. It's the best thing you'll ever eat.  Mastro's, City Hall, and Ocean Club still have a ton of popularity... But chef Lupino cooks for Dominick's and Steak 44. So obviously the best steak in AZ has found its home with this company."}
{"text":"Nothing exceeds like excess. Dominick's exceeds expectations on every level. Service, ambiance and food are top notch, and a notch above the multitude of other premium steakhouses in the area. Pours, steaks, sides, all generous portions, exceed expectations. This is how a steakhouse should be."}
{"text":"Best steak in the area! And I'm a steak snob!! I think I cook the best but when I don't feel like cooking this is the place to be! Hang out at the bar! It's always hoping! Bartenders and wait staff are very experienced and love there job!"}
{"text":"We had dinner there tonight. We were up on the second floor. The pool was filled with water. The roof was open to the beautiful azure sky. It was a pleasant evening. The bartender was very nice. She suggested an Italian blood orange cocktail that was sweet, tasty and quenched your thirst. Appetizers were crispy shrimp and crab cakes.  We ordered superfood salad and chopped salad. These were all very tasty. For the main course we had Bone-in Ribeye and Alaskan King Crab legs.  The ribeye was to die for. Marbling in the meat was a work of art as the fat just rolled off of the tongue with every canine tear of the meat. It was ordered medium rare.  It became more medium rear towards the center.  The flavor gave reason why one is a carnivore.  The king crab legs were huge and beautiful. Although it was a bit salty. Sometimes you wonder why something as beautiful as this is salty. Is it to cover up some flaw in the taste. Otherwise it was not overcooked and it was moist.  The shells were packed full of meat.  The service was impeccable.  The bathroom was mostly clean.  There were a few splashes on the floor."}
{"text":"First time being to this Scottsdale staple.  Ordered the bone in ribeye, and loaded baked potato-outstanding.  The apps that our table ordered were amazing also-prime meatballs with marinara, calamari and shrimp, and pork belly.  This a place that should be check out when in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area."}
{"text":"Gorgeous venue, truly perfect steaks, and the Hasselback potatoes are out of this world. We came here on a night when Larry Fitzgerald was hosting a charity event upstairs, but were seated promptly when we arrived. Our waiter was quick, thorough, and unobtrusive, and we never had to ask for cocktails, which is a big plus for me. The place is pricey (especially the wine list), but not any worse than most of the other high end steak houses in town. I have only two complaints about our experience: 1)The music was a little loud (which is fine in the bar, but not so much in the dining room); and 2) When they called the next day to ask how we'd liked our meal, I told them both of us thought the music was a hair too loud. I was informed:  \"... oh ... well our managers like it that way.\" If you don't give a damn about your customers' opinions, why ask for them?"}
{"text":"Went to Dominick's Steakhouse for the Happy Hour and sat in the bar area. They have a fairly good bar menu for happy hour with nine or ten items for $10. And a $10 cocktail menu that had a few doubles listed and they bring you the whole shaker. We enjoyed the Steak and Gorganzola sandwhich, Fried meatballs and Calamari. The appetizers were very hearty and plentiful. Overall the happy hour menu was a real good deal. A little crowded and crazy but typical for a happy hour. The atmosphere was fun and lively and the wait staff work hard to get you everything that you need."}
{"text":"Best of the BEST in food, ambiance, wait staff, drinks, and entertaiment and MORE! With out any doubt~my all time favorite! Thanks to Dennis Mastro and Scotty the owners, this city has gained it's class back once again. LOVE! LOVE!  Now go there and see for yourselves! Debra Savittieri"}
{"text":"Revisited Dominic's steakhouse again and was very satisfied  The atmosphere,the service and the food was great. We really liked the side dishes and the filet was awesome"}
{"text":"This is easily one of my favorite Steakhouses in Arizona.  It reminds me of Vegas when I'm here.  Why?  Because it's always full of life & energy...at least before 9 pm....and the food & service is outstanding.  I've dined here several times for personal & business reasons.  Each time, Dominick's delivers in the clutch.  When I'm entertaining clients, I enjoy dining in the back room on the 3rd level.  It's best suited for that scenario.  When I'm here with The Better Half and we want some privacy, then we ask to be seated anywhere but the bar area.  When TBH and I just want some appetizers and a glass of Wine or a late night drink, we sit at the bar.  Some menu items I've had here:  Iceberg Wedge Salad, $10.95 Tomato & Mozzarella, $12.95 Fried Meatballs Appetizer, $14.95  Petite Filet Mignon (8oz), $41.95 Filet Mignon (12oz), $47.95 Mashed Potatoes, $9.95 Au Gratin Potatoes, $13.95 Creamed Sweet Corn, $9.95  The Salads are pretty hearty portions, so be prepared.  The Bleu Cheese Dressing on the Wedge Salad is very good and rich.  If you're hungry, split the Meatballs Appetizer....it's very good, but I don't recommend having it by yourself.  Simply put, the Filet is awesome.  Depending on my hunger level, I will either get the petite or the regular size.  They cook it to your preference.  I like it Medium-Well.  Their sides are enough to easily feed 2 or 3 people.  TBH and I usually share an order of Mashed Potatoes or Au Gratin.  When I'm dining with clients, I usually get 2 or 3 for the table so they can sample them....the Sweet Corn is amazing.  Their Wine selection is excellent....we've had so many good ones here.  The service is outstanding.  In 10+ visits here, I've never had bad service.  Some notes: Although there's not really a \"dress code\", I've heard that they won't seat people who are not dressed appropriately.  Shorts & flip-flops, t-shirts, jeans, etc....they'll probably tell you that there aren't any available tables....that's hearsay, but I'm passing it along so there are no surprises.  I've never showed up here dressed casual, so I don't have personal experience with it.  Return Factor - 100%"}
{"text":"I do not give many 5 stars, but this four star restaurant gets bumped to a 5 star because of the great waitstaff and mostly our waiter Tracy. This lovely woman was attentive, charming, funny, helpful and a huge asset to an already good restaurant.  we cancelledour reservation  for 22 at maestros ( over rated) to go back the next night.  thanks to tracy Dominicks is now a staple"}
{"text":"A classic for a reason!  This is a meal worth paying for... and you will (but, again, worth it). Busy and lively, this is a place for the pretty people who like excellent food. Our meal wasn't extravagant, Shishito peppers to start, two fillets with Brussels, Asparagus, and their take on scalloped potatoes. Add in their delicious bread, a bottle of Duckhorn chard, and the comp dessert for our anniversary and it was fantastic!  Jennifer the server was engaged though clearly a professional who keeps boundaries. This is a place you don't need to worry about... it will deliver."}
{"text":"Top notch service and delicious food!  LOVE Dominick's!!  Amazing food and even better service.  Tim and Jenn were awesome!!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal here! I got the New York strip steak and my wife got the fillet. We both agreed it was the best flavored steak we ever had! The atmosphere is very swanky! Pricy of course but worth going even if just once!"}
{"text":"When I wanted to come to AZ for a weekend, I specifically choose Dominick's for my birthday dinner.   My boyfriend made the reservation and indicated that it was for a birthday and that we would like to be seated near the pool. If you do get to sit near the pool, make sure to bring something to keep you warm IF you get cold easily. It wasn't cold on the top floor, it's more the wind that is pushing through that was not from outside, so you can get a little chilly.   Why I could not give it a 5 star was not because of the food or the dining room. It was mainly because the server we had. Our server did not seem like he wanted to be working that night and it showed on his face. Also, my boyfriend and I only had one bread roll each, out of 6 pieces, and they took it without asking us if we were done. Not sure why they did that but it really confused us and I was hangry so I really wanted the bread.   But I will say, this is one of my favorite steakhouses (hands down)!"}
{"text":"Went here NYE. We have been to Ocean Club, City Hall, Steak 44, you name it. I LOVED Dominick's! We had a table pool side on the rooftop which was probably the coolest area I can remember sitting at any restaurant. We had the colossal shrimp for a starter with the atomic horseradish. The shrimp were HUGE and horseradish was great and sooo spicy! Bread was great, steaks were great, sides were great, drinks were great. Take my money. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  Care is given to the experience from beginning to end...  Anyone coming to town, that requests steak, is getting the recommendation of Dominicks from me!!!"}
{"text":"How come so many of my reviews start off with the words 'happy hour' somewhere in them?  So on to their happy hour....absolutely the best wine deals around.   Fantastic 'by the glass' list and crazy reasonable for what you get.   Additionally, they have some outstanding 'small plate' options to give you a taste of what a full meal would be like.  Be prepared, everything they offer is quite rich; smaller portions but not a light meal by any means.  I have also hosted business dinners here and its a fantastic spot to be on an expense account at.   Although our bill was quite hefty; my client was equally as impressed.  The bone-in filet is a must; thank goodness it is on their regular menu instead of only being a special.  (I hate when I am at a steakhouse and they run out of bone in filets before I can order.)   The setting is dark and intimate.   The valet parking is well appreciated given the crowds at the shopping community that surrounds it.  Granted, you get the plastic Scottsdale crowd here, but what did you expect?"}
{"text":"Very dissapointed , the food was so tasteless and low quality . The lobster mac n cheese was extremely fishy and plain gross . In a steakhouse you would assume that the steak is flavorful . My steak was rubbery tasteless and made me dislike food for the entire period it sat on the table . Mastros will always be the best steakhouse ."}
{"text":"Every time we're at Scottsdale Quarter, I walk by and say we need to try this place. Finally, this past weekend we went for my boyfriends birthday (which was hard to do since we love Mastro's City Hall and Ruths Chris). There is complimentary valet so we took advantage & got seated right away for our 7:30PM reservation. It was pretty hard to get to our table because there's almost no room in between tables, but no big deal. We got a bottle of the William Hill cabernet which was very reasonably priced (I think $33). The bread came in 3 options -- sea salt, garlic & cheese. We got the garlic and it was amazing, 5 huge rolls, but we only finished 2 & then took the rest home (would be great with some pasta Mmmm). Then for dinner we split the Caesar salad, I got the petit filet mignon (8oz), my boyfriend got a bone-in rib eye, and then we got 2 sides: sautéed mushrooms ; Dominick's potatoes which were like potatoes au gratin. All of it was AMAZING! The potatoes were so great, and we had leftovers of everything. I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed this restaurant and we have been to several high end steak houses like Maeatras. Steaks were Amazing we Ordered bone in. We has mashed potatoes and their signature scalloped potatoes, Should have just ordered one. One of the best blue cheese wedge salads I have ever had. Great wine list even Silveroak  by the glass"}
{"text":"Ok Dominick's deserves 5 stars for our last visit.  Everything came as ordered and service was top shelf.  We had 8 fellas at a round table in the dining room on a Saturday evening in March, busy time.    Pre dinner cocktails, martinis are made well and our server did a nice job of explaining the specials and not over-selling.  I tire of these spots trying to market their seafood tower, we get it.    Several different cuts of meat were ordered: each prepared to satisfaction.  NY strips, filets, veal chops, etc.  Side dishes:  , mushrooms, spinach, mac and cheese, brussels, and creme brûlée corn which was sweet and tasty.    Like any steak spot the wine list is marked up pretty well.  We had a few bottles of the Mt. Veeder and Heitz cab, both good and around $100.    I think our tab for the table and wine was about $ 1,300.  I've written before about this restaurant, it has earned my repeat business."}
{"text":"Always delicious! This place is a staple for my wife and I when we celebrate big and they never let us down. Great service and drinks as well.  Wish every night could be a Dominiques night!"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this yet, it's a must!  Ask for Brad!! The best server!  If you love steak and good service, this is the restaurant for you!!"}
{"text":"This is a top notch restaurant... from when u first arrive greeted by the valet. The wait staff and management is exceptional. The   cuisine is five stars...the filet melts in your mouth. I highly recommend Dominick's if u want a first class dining experience."}
{"text":"Dominick's might be expensive for some, but for me it was worth the price for the food and the experience I had. This steakhouse had an elegant ambience and the bone-in veal chop met my expectations."}
{"text":"The boyfriend took me to Dominick's for my birthday and I couldn't have asked for a better place to celebrate.  We went on a weekday and were seated downstairs overlooking the bar area. Upstairs there is a pool (weird but awesome!) and if we ever go back on a weekend I definitely want to sit poolside - ha! Anyway, our table was very nice and our waiter was attentive without being overbearing.  To start we ordered the wedge salad. This may be a salad but there is nothing healthy about it. Very traditional in its preparation - iceberg lettuce, bleu cheese dressing, bacon and onion. It was a little heavy on the dressing but it had a nice flavor. We split one salad and it was plenty.  For our entrees we both ordered filets. For our sides we got mushrooms and the steakhouse tater tots. More on the tots in a sec. The steaks come out on a sizzling hot plate, so no worries of your food getting cold. Both of our steaks were done just the way we ordered. The mushrooms were a great complement to the steak. A little salty, but I kind a like salty so it was okay. Okay, now the tots. These re NOT your typical frozen tater tots. These things were fantastic. They are made by hand and it's basically like they take hashbrowns, form them into oversized tots and deep fry them. Oh my tot, are these things good. A highlight of the meal for sure!  As if we weren't stuffed enough after all the tots and meat, because it was my birthday they brought me a slice of chocolate creme pie. Sounds like a weird thing to get at a steakhouse but it actually went with the meal quite nicely. My favorite part was that they brought an extra bowl of whipped cream out with the pie. No skimping on the whipped cream at this place.  After all that we left with full bellies, smiling faces and a bag of leftovers. (yay!) I would highly recommend Dominick's for a special occasion or when you just feel like blowing a lot of money on a really good meal."}
{"text":"Ate with Monty on his return visit.  Food and service was great.  I don't give many 5 stars either, but have to agree."}
{"text":"Well... What can I say. I gave them 3 stars only because the Scallops and Lobster appetizer was very good.  This is a steak house! And for $40-$50 just for the steak it should come out perfectly cooked and tasty.  I don't recommend the surf and turf combinations.  1) My first Filet Mignon came out over cooked. And on top of it the crab I ordered with the surf and turf came slopped on top of my steak.   2) the Crab was very salty and over seasoned  3) The second Filet came... Cooked better but more rare than medium.   4) I tried to cut it ... But it was a bit tough and gritty. Filet was not perfectly cut and was separated on one end. I had them being me a second steak knife because I thought the first was dull... But steak was hard to cut for what was supposed to be \"PRIME\" beef.  5) The taste of the meet was very strong.. It was not well rubbed or seasoned. It tasted like I just cut a slab of meet off the cow and ate it.  6) I sent the 2nd steak back and changed my order to a cold lobster appetizer.   7) Manager came after the first steak was poorly cooked and apologized... But never came again after the 2nd was under cooked and tasted bad.  8) The restaurant .. After 2 mistakes .. Never offered to comp my meal. I expected more from an upscale steakhouse charging $50 a steak!    9) We even left a $20 tip .... Probably should not have in hindsight.  The atmosphere is great... Elegant .. Especially the second floor with the affinity pool inside.   The side dishes are family style and good. Sauces and other items like serf and turf are extremely salty and over seasoned.  Overall was a disappointment ... I went there to enjoy an awesome steak and celebrate my promotion..., and was let down!  Very unhappy with how management handle the issues with my steak... They just ignored it. Maybe they thought I was a tourist... But I live in Scottsdale."}

They really pay attention to the dtails..There is just not enough that can be said about the atmosphere.. This is a game changer for the Valley IMO..This is the best Steakhouse in Arizona.. Probably a top 10 USDA Prime Steakhouse in the country..."}
{"text":"Best steakhouse in Phoenix/Scottsdale IMHO.  Bone in ribeye was perfectly prepared and served on a sizzling plate.  The meat was aged to perfection and was as tender as a filet mignon cut.  We were not going to finish an entire bottle of wine tonight, so ordered by the glass.  The pour was generous.  The prices are what you'd expect from a tier-one steakhouse.  However, the quality, ambience, white linen service without the stuffy attitudes, really sets this place apart.  If you're a car aficionado, there will usually be something parked outside that will get your motor running."}
{"text":"Classic steakhouse atmosphere, dark rich colors. Live music in the bar serves as entertainment for the restaurant (downstairs). Singer is very talented.  First server was strange, but when our actual server came ver he was better (first was very staccato, no welcome, just down to business....\"hello. Tap or sparkling water?\").   The pretzel bread is to die for. All the bread is amazing!  Oysters were great (expensive, though). Friends got crab law appetizer & liked it. Caesar salads were pretty good.   We ordered lobster potatoes; they brought lobster Mac instead. The mgr brought a small side of potatoes, which were better than the pasta, in our opinion. My friend ordered petite filet, thy brought bone in filet instead.   So sort of a rocky start....but got better.  My hubs and split a bone-in filet + scallops (plenty of food!). It was delicious, after my first bite which was gristle (I had to spit it out). I had the bone, and the meat flavor was great, cooked as I'd ordered. My hubs had the non-bone side, and by the time his sizzling hot plate came cooled down, his was overdone.  Plus: cocktails are great. Sides (snap peas, mushrooms) were fantastic. Warm butter dessert s recommended. Big portions. Quality of meat is high.  Negative: $40-$50 for a steak, it should come in cut and cooked as ordered, no gristle. Wine is 3x markup.   I might try it again and see if I can upgrade to a 4-5 star. It's just that, for the price, I expected things to be better."}
{"text":"I had the filet mignon and it tasted pretty good.  Medium rare was really cooked to a good medium rare. The highlight of the night was the butter cake the portions of the desserts were massive!! I could go to this restaurant just to get the butter cake and the other desserts. Came with whip cream and ice cream of never had anything like it!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food the waiters and waitresses are amazing and during happy hour the prices are amazing g for the buttery delicious steak you get!!! Would definitely recommend this to anyone willing to spend a pretty penny but even so the appetizers are filling and my favorite is the steak and fries it is only $17 and for what you get (a small steak but delicious and some fries) it is totally worth it for dessert I recommend the beignets (learn how to pronounce it before you get there so you don't look like a fool like me) they come with a vanilla sauce and a Nutella tasting sauce both heated up and it comes on a metal tree that is small but the flavor is incredible this place is amazing and I would come here more often if I had the time and the money to do so!!"}
{"text":"Best service by far I have EVER received ! The staff is very attentive , professional and yet friendly . Atmosphere is upscale, dark and awesome music.. The food is beyond amazing , full of flavor and cooked to perfection . They constantly make sure you have beverage , crumbs wiped off the table and clean napkins at all times . They thought we waited to long for our appetizer and brought a free beignet donut tree after our dinner ! But before the donut tree they brought us hot wet towels to clean our hands . There isn't 1 negative thing about this place !"}
{"text":"You really get what you pay for with Dominicks.   Amazing food/experience from start to finish with the only slight negative being a somewhat noisy atmosphere (could've just been the night we went on) and a somewhat pricey menu but it's truly worth the price. The seafood appetizer was fresh and mouthwatering with  succulent oysters and delicious jumbo shrimp. For dinner I ordered the filet mignon.... Without a doubt the best filet I've had!"}
{"text":"Had a dinner reservation and decided to show up early for happy hour. Appetizers were excellent, we had steak and fries, calamari, and crab cakes. Bone in ribeye for dinner cooked to perfection. Whipped mashed potatoes were very good. The only weak spot in this meal was mac n cheese, it was good but not outstanding.!our waitress, Amanda, in the bar was so attentive we decided to have our dinner in the bar. We were celebrating our anniversary and received a complimentary dessert which was excellent."}
{"text":"Great Steak and sides and a mm exclusive ambiance! Felt like a boss at Dominicks! Definitely down to check it out again next time I'm in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I had the petite filet & sides.  It is a nice place to go for dinner.  The cocktails were on the weak side.  The steak was wonderful and the lobster mac and cheese was dry good with large chunks of lobster.  I love Brussel sprouts but theirs really wasn't that great - I would definitely go back but skip the Brussel sprouts & opt for wine."}
{"text":"The service was amazing, starting off with complementary valet. The bread serves at the beginning of the courses was soft and warm. Our waiter was very informative and guided us well. The serving size of my ribeye was perfect. It was cooked to perfection. The sides we shared we're bought to feed all of us. Dessert was exquisite and rich! I ordered a chocolate layered cake, super decadent! All-in-all, I was impressed and will return again."}
{"text":"I came here for a special event so maybe I'm biased, but how does this place have under 5 stars?! From the gorgeous rooftop pool bar to the mouth-watering food, I was very impressed. Definitely one of the best filets I have ever had - cooked to perfection - and I think the shrimp appetizer is a close second on my list of favorites. I agree with other reviewers that the sea salt bread is a must-try.. but if you're really ready to go all-out, get the new chocolate chip brioche bread pudding for dessert!!! It is HUGE and even so I was basically licking the plate until the server finally dragged it away lol. Beautiful venue, live music, great evening!"}
{"text":"Birthday treats!  Beautiful environment!  Natashia was amazing!  Twice in a row having her be our server!  Thank you!  Looking forward to more visits!!  First went with friends and then alone with my husband!!"}
{"text":"FIVE STARS FOR FAKERS. Red carpet entrance and horribly silly and stupid revolving door set the tone for this ridiculous adventure.  #layout just makes no sense. it's like someone had a vision for a bar and then squished in all this other stuff wherever it could fit, including the tables. #the singer is real, but his music accompaniments are all cheap karakoke tracks, akin to their casio bossanova-button-rythm and one-finger-bass section ancestors. think price-is-right canned tracks but where are the beauties? #come on, they've got a baby grand up there. where's the live music like they have at EDDIE V'S across the way? #shuffled up to the rooftop pool patio (enclosed) for table at pool's edge. #ordering computer/POS/credit card terminal is on low shelf behind us. great spot to learn your servers' underwear brand preferences! #check out the pics. steak served alone, plopped on a searing hot plate. except there's nothing to sear. i try to explain that the steak is still cooking on that hot plate, but server just ignores.  HEAD TO EDDIE V'S FOR THE BEST STEAKHOUSE EXPERIENCE IN THE AREA."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The food is amazing, ambience is really nice, and the manager (Luke) is fantastic.  My friends and I come here often and we love it."}
{"text":"This is one of the best steakhouses in Arizona. The environment is amazing - we sat on the roof and had an amazing night. The service is incredible; we never once went thirsty or hungry. But above all, the food absolutely cannot be beat."}
{"text":"Got seated on the second floor open atrium court, what a surprise! Seafood platter was top notch as was the ahi poke.  The bone in KC steak was cooked to perfection and the meat off the bone was to die for.   Top it all off with their world famous Butter Cake and you will die and go to heaven!"}
{"text":"BEST happy hour in Scottsdale...KIM was our server and the service was impeccable! Can't wait to go back for dinner! Food is outstanding"}
{"text":"By far my favorite restaurant. The lemon drop martini is the best drink I've ever had- you must try! Excellent service and food quality. Highly recommend the pool area!"}
{"text":"Tonight was my first time here and I have to say that I am very impressed! I didn't really know what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised. The service was excellent from the moment we walked through the revolving door until we got back into our cars at the complimentary valet area. To me good service is everything but good service can sometimes be all you get. Well, I think this place is well worth the money you will spend here. Everything that touched our table was top notch from the steak to the sea bass. And the atmosphere is very comfortable. Not too stuffy but not too laid back either. I thoroughly enjoyed my night here! Definitely a revisit in my future :)"}
{"text":"Had I not had an office Christmas party to attend at Dominick's, it's unlikely I'd have ever made the trek up North to dine at one of the latest trendy, pricey, steakhouses Scottsdale has to offer.  However I would have been missing out, because D's provided me with one of the most succulent, incredible cuts of sizzling meat I've ever sunk my sharp little teeth into.  A brilliant New York strip, medium rare with a nice crust of salt, pepper, & butter, served with perfectly gooey au gratin potatoes and sweet & spicy sugarsnap peas- utter perfection.  Also, I'm always particularly impressed when a business can pull off exceptional food and service for very large parties, and they did just that.  It's very showy and elegant, with a red-carpet to boot, but a really fun reason to get dressed up and feast like a Queen."}
{"text":"Michelle and I had dinner last night with some great friends here at Dominick's.  The service was outstanding.  Apps were fantastic, great portions, and the main course was delish.  We enjoyed the Scottish Salmon, Petite Bone-In Filet, King Crab legs(huge), and KC Rib eye.  Dessert was too much.  My new fav steakhouse.  Thanks Mari and Brandon, Will return!!!"}
{"text":"I hate to say it - but Happy Hour here is KILLER! Some great bites to try a little bit of everything! Of course you're going to want to have A martini, just one it will catch up on ya! Super friendly staffing, lovely interior vibe and great tunes!"}
{"text":"Went to Dominick's last Thursday for dinner.  Thought about Mastro's but we wanted to try something a little more unique.  We sat at a table for two overlooking the bar area.  We were getting the brunt of the music that was being played, and it ended up being really too loud to have a conversation with my companion. In addition to that, there were a number of little things.  Our waitress seemed like she was going through the motions - everything sounded rehearsed.  I hate to be picky about things like this, but at a higher end steak place, I expect our server to be engaging.  It felt like she was more or less reading from a script, absent mindedly.  We also felt a bit rushed thorugh the meal, to the point where we literally waited to eat our salads to slow the pace of service.  The food was delicious - I had the bone in filet which was probably one of the better steaks I can remember. It was cooked perfectly and very flavorful.   I waffled, nearly giving four stars.  It's a good dining experience, but I was really hoping for more than we got. Our server may have just had an off night or something, but there seem to be other really good options to try next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"When I die, I'm pretty sure I won't be going to heaven, which is why I come here, for their warm butter cake.  I don't have drinks. Or appetizers. And I don't eat one of their signature cuts of beef.  Only the warm butter cake.  This cake is served on an oval platter. And on this platter is a six-inch long, two-inch thick, oval shaped butter cake cooked to golden browned perfection.  Also on the platter is a small lake of warmed caramel sauce, a generous dollop of freshly whipped cream, and a scoop of softened, french vanilla ice cream.  In concert with all its accoutrements, each mouthful of this buttery delight will have you looking forward to the next with so much enthusiasm, you'll find yourself shiftily speeding your shoveling gait so as to out-consume your date by at least a five spoonful margin.  I say forget all those other useless calories from drinks and entrees and shoot your entire calorie wad on a dessert so sumptious, it's likely the nearest thing to heaven you'll ever experience."}
{"text":"Celebrated our 2nd anniversary here and loved everything about it! The server was attentive and the food was great. Once you sit down, you get to choose from 3 or 4 different types of bread rolls. We got sea salt option. Rib-eye and Short Rib were cooked perfectly. The sides were super big and we got three, I wasn't aware they you could get half sides, but we will next time! They surprised us with dessert at the end which was a nice touch. We thought the price for the value you get was excellent. Would love to try their happy hour, I've heard great things about it and the bar. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Place is just beautiful inside, I've been twice now.  First time on a date with the wife for dinner and the steak was great and the sides were fantastic, service is just ridiculous.  Second time we were on a double date to iPic theater and we stopped at the bar and ordered a ton of their appetizers and had several of their specialty drinks.  I wish I could remember my favorite but I was pretty lit.  Its not cheap so dont come here expecting any deals but you will impress the woman in your life for sure."}
{"text":"Always excellent food but the service really made it tonight.  Brett was there, just enough but not too much.  He listened and really got my salmon cooked PERFECTLY !  Thanks too to the chef ..job well done!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Everything we ordered was incredible. The steaks were perfect! Exceeded our expectations."}
{"text":"I live near this restaurant and have eaten here at least once a week since it's opened. It's that good.   Best steaks in the area.   The cocktails are expensive, but the bartenders aren't cheap. The drinks are as good as the food.  Sides are exquisite, as well, including their signature potatoes.   Best dessert in Scottsdale? A TIE. And both are at Dominick's; the beignet tree and the butter cake. Both to die for and guaranteed to add ten pounds to you."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places! Not only is the atmosphere incredible - rooftop pool, private rooms filled with glassed in wine bottles from floor to ceiling, I could go on and on! We came for happy hour and ordered wine, calamari, lobster Mac and cheese, lobster grilled cheese, beet salad, and thinly sliced steak on crostini! Everything was delicious and the service was great. Can't wait to be back and bring my friends!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love trying new restaurants. Dominick's came highly recommended, as I wanted a steakhouse, to treat him to dinner. He thoroughly enjoyed his steak - in his words, \"It was amazing!\"  We shared the loaded mash potatoes and they were okay - a little too thin, I like thicker mashed potatoes. I ordered the scallops and wasn't happy. The lemon butter sauce they were served in was great, but the scallops themselves, were bland. I just expected more. The bread basket was fantastic. The service was fantastic. Everyone was polite and very knowledgeable. And the live music added a lovely touch. I've heard so many good things about Dominick's, that I have to give them another chance. So, we will be returning."}
{"text":"Way too expensive for this food fare at this location.  Service is impeccable and if you want to pay for such, then this is the place to go.  Food was overrated for sure.  It was good; but, not excellent.  I will not recommend this spot unless you don't mind average to good food for the very high price point (everything seems to be a la carte).  By the time you complete a meal with a few sides you have spent enough to mortgage a single family home in Scottsdale!  Not on the top of my list at least.  Without question and in my experience there are many better venues for steaks in the Phoenix/Scottsdale metropolitan area. If it were not for the heavy price point for average to good food, then I would have recommended this place.  I am a steak maniac and do not mind spending money to get what I want, but I do not have any plans to return to this location if that gives you a sense of my experience at least."}
{"text":"I had no idea what this place was when we came here the first time.  Regardless, the food was spectacular.  Service?  Personalized and amazing.  Did I think that could happen TWICE?  Hell NO!  But guess what?  It DID.  In addition to the food being as great as it was on our first visit, our expectations for service were EXCEEDED upon our 2nd visit.  Rather than being the \"snooty\" type of establishment, our server was ADORABLE as was before and she definitely went above and beyod to make us feel special.  I have no words, really.  We are fans."}
{"text":"Our first time at Dominick's Steakhouse to celebrate a Saturday Valentines Day, with my husband and son. Service and food were excellent, we couldn't have asked for better.  I made the reservation on Open Table and yes and they do require Credit Card and if its a no show and you don't cancel 72hrs in advance, it's $50 per person penalty charge, stated in the fine print. Our reservations were at 6:45, we were greeted and seated promptly at a table for 4 by the bar area, though it was fairly loud it but manageable and fun to people watch. Our server Victoria was great. We started off with the Super Colossal Shrimp (house-made cocktail sauce - atomic horseradish) and the Steakhouse Caesar Salad (romaine, classic dressing, fresh baked garlic croutons, fresh anchovies). Entree were the Boneless 12oz. Ribeye, the 22oz. Bone-In Ribeye, 12oz. NY Strip with the Truffle Butter, Baked Potato \"loaded\" and the Hand Cut Fries. All the food was excellent and perfectly cooked.  Perfect Service, perfect dinner, perfect time."}
{"text":"Would go back again. The creamed spinach was amazing, and mushrooms for our steak. Was less than impressed w the shishito peppers but the bone in rib eye was awesome as well. Good variation in wine ($-$$$$$). Even got a great free dessert for my dates birthday!"}
{"text":"Good food perfectly prepared at an exorbitant price. Come in park the Rolls you'll love this place. Park the Honda, $42 dollar steak will probably get your attention. Service was great."}
{"text":"Best steaks ever!! We had the rack of lamb. So delicious. We shared and couldn't finish. Desserts are amazing. Love the s'mores in a jar!!!"}
{"text":"Friday evening. Sophisticated atmosphere but disappointing background music that makes one fell like they are in a juvenile space. What happened to the piano entertainment or quality music that sets the mood?  You have now become no different then any of the other generic establishment that is all over Scottsdale. What set you apart???   The background music is ....undignified to this caliber restaurant and lounge .   And one huge problem.... Bartenders do not scan the bar.... In a place like this I should never have to ask for service....."}
{"text":"Being from Nebraska, I can taste a good steak from a mile away. Up until visiting Dominick's last night, I had not eaten a good steak since moving to the Valley three years ago. The flavor, texture, presentation and everything about Dominick's steaks, along with all of their other dishes, is phenomenal. The staff really knows how to make each person feel like an elite and the ambience surrounding the restaurant is fabulous as well. I can't wait to make a reservation for pool-side dining underneath the stars up on the second floor next time!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. I had the wagu steak. No other steak will taste the same. My kids had Alaskan king crab legs and they were half the length of the table! The wait staff was unbelievable! Great experience!"}
{"text":"Thought we'd get a bite in the bar for our first time trying Dominick's.  Wow. Amazing wine by the glass list - the best I've seen in the Valley.  Definitely worth hitting up this bar for a great glass of wine.  It's a beautiful restaurant, too, with lots of dark wood and  modern touches you expect in a fine steak house.  That's where the good bar experience ends, though.   The music they play is horrid.  Please. I love the Bangles Manic Monday more than 90% of folks, but it's not something I want to hear when dropping this much money on a Saturday date night.  Other tracks included such greats as Steve Miller and the Beatles...again, all outstanding artists, just not here and now.  The music made me feel 90 years old. Customers were all dressed in shorts and t-shirts and would have fit in fine at Outback but not here. - Dominick's needs a dress code.   It took forever to get a food menu and for the bartender to come take our orders, so we decided they weren't really set up for good bar food service and didn't want our steaks sitting at the window too long waiting to be delivered to us  We walked over to Eddie V's bar to eat and enjoy their live music (where the customers were all far better dressed but the wine was not as good!)"}
{"text":"Legit!!!! I actually had their King Crab Legs and my husband had a wagu ribeye and we both devoured the crab legs and left the steak on our plates. Both were great both the crab was DYNAMITE! Service was on point and the drinks were SO GOOD!!! I had the orange blossom something and then the pomegranate orange something  both amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Mastro's 2.0....ambiance is as expected the streaks are awesome.  I had the ribeye and my wife had the filet, both were  cooked perfectly and had the texture and flavor only Mastro can provide.  We have have steak in many, many places in the country and they are always compared to the Dominick (Mastro) brand and none come close. Now we have to decide.... Dominick's, Mastros, Domincks, Mastros.... Mmmm warm butter cake is good but why not stick with the original creator?"}
{"text":"I love steakhouses and I was excited to try dominick's, but I was very disappointed.  First, the service was terrible. They were busy, but not  any busier than I would expect a steakhouse on a Friday evening. We were definitely forgotten about. We had the lobster cocktail, was okay. Next, we tried the chopped salad. It was your average house salad. We both got Filet's, which were the most disappointing. The meat had a bad flavor. I have never sent an item back at a steakhouse, but we both sent back the filet's. I ended up ordering the sea bass instead, which was better than the steak, but not the best I've had. My friend's appetite was ruined though and chose not to order anything else. I would not go back, especially when you have Mastro's Ocean Club across the street, which is delicious."}
{"text":"We went here for my boyfriends birthday and it was disappointing to say the least. My bill was $400 so I expected perfection just as I do at Gordon Ramsey's dining establishments when I eat there. I have spent less at Capital Grill or Maestro's and they always deliver perfection.   My boyfriend got the Ribeye which he loved and had no issues. I got the chef special or that night and it was a $98 steak. I ordered medium and it came out raw, literally red and uncooked. Even our waiter agreed the steak was not cooked properly. It had to be sent back and this should be unacceptable at this type of establishment. My side of brussel sprouts were very hard, so it was difficult to eat them. The plate the steak is served on is 500 degrees and it splatters the grease from the steak all over you. Hot grease hit my chin, neck and shirt and it took a good five minutes for it to stop. The plate is also so hot, that every bite of your steak will burn your tongue, as it did mine until the plate cools down. My steak must have been extremely fatty or greasy because there was a good amount of popping grease which not appealing. I would prefer my steak plated on a normal temp plate...and not swimming in it's own grease. I felt like I was eating directly out of the pan. The manager came by and we did tell him this stuff and I was surprised that nothing was comped on our meal or done for us, just an apology.   I may be picky but when you command $100 per steak, you better be delivering perfection.  The establishment was noisy between the music being turned up and the guests, we couldn't hear anything our waiter said. The music should have been turned down and just in the background."}
{"text":"Went to Dominick's for the first time last night! My family and I shared a 32 ounce Wagyu ribeye bone-in! It was one of the best pieces of steak that I've ever come across. Along with this we also tried the rack of lamb which was very tender! For dessert we tried the beignets that came displayed on a metallic tree! We loved Dominick's and can't wait to come back for future celebrations!"}
{"text":"Great service! I wish I remembered our server to give him a shout. It's hard for a steak to impress me because my dad grills amazing steaks. I think the only reason I liked theirs better than his is because they are bone in and cut in house. Flavor wise, my dad is beck and neck but these were more tender."}
{"text":"I've walked by Dominick's many of time but never really had a desire to visit. Anyways, my son gave me a gift certificate for Father's Day. So I decided to have an early Father's Day dinner.   When we walked in I could smell its fancy. Staff dress really nice, dark, pop music playing(I think). We were taken to the main dining area and they had a small marble stairs. Very nice.  The hostess brought us to our table and seated us. We sat for a minute or two without menus (can you say awkward). Never been to a place like this before. Anyways, the waiter brings us the menus and makes sure we get our drink orders and bread basket. Our waiter was Geoff and he went over the menu and was very knowledgable. Very impressive.   We started off with the bread basket. I usually don't write about the bread basket but all I have to say is WOW. You get a pretzel bread (so good. Excellent), sour dough, bread sticks, and red onion Focaccia. The focaccia was soft and sweet. I loved it. Also, remember I really don't like onions but this was really good.   I ordered the 22oz Bone In Ribeye. My wife ordered the Filet of Sole Francese and we got the side dishes of Sautéed Spinach with Garlic and Mac & Cheese. The ribeye was something special. It was so tender, juicy, cooked perfectly, and melted in my mouth. It was sooo good. Also, be aware that the always state that their steak plate comes out at 500 degrees and it was hot. Sizzling hot. My wife had the Sole and it was good. It tasted okay. Nothing special. They do give you two large filets. One thing that stood out is after they served our meals, they asked us if they can serve us our side dishes. Very nice touch. The spinach was very good and the Mac & Cheese was good too. The main meal and bread basket was so big that we couldn't even finish the side dishes. Yum yum good.   We were stuffed but left a little room for dessert. You always got to leave room for dessert. So we tried their signature dessert which was a hot Butter cake with vanilla bean ice cream, homemade whip cream, and Carmel syrup. Really good. Soft and buttery (of course) with a nice sweet taste. The ice cream had something different. Couldn't put a finger on it but was so darn good. Excellent dessert.   The service was excellent. Our waiter checked on us just enough, our water cups were refilled all the time, dishes were removed in a timely manner, and they boxed up our food too.   I really enjoyed Dominick's. They claim to be  focus on Midwestern Beef so definitely try their steaks. So if you really want a great steak with a nice atmosphere then Dominick's might be that place. Just be aware of the prices. It's at the high end, but food is great, service excellent. Enjoy but be ready to open your wallet."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants in the valley. We've never been disappointed here. Food and drinks are great, as is the wine list. The \"pool room\" upstairs adds additional ambience. Great place for a nice dinner with your loved one or for a business dinner."}
{"text":"We just finished our anniversary dinner and the food was great.. the service was good but I felt like our waiter kinda forgot about us towards the end of the meal.. after we were finished with our meal and about to order dessert I felt he could have checked up on us a lil bit more bc there was period where we were just sitting there waiting for our check.. so I knocked down 1/2 star for that.. (4.5 out of 5) the food was great, we ordered the bone in ribeye and Kansas City strip steak along with Dominick's potatoes and asparagus.. we also ordered the braised pork belly with spinach (sweet chili sauce on top).. everything was delicious and I loved their sangria.. we finished off with s'mores in a jar which was good and they also give you three small chocolate chip cookies at the end.. they do have happy hour from 4-6 at the bar area if you would like to go to munch on some stuff before ur dinner along with getting some drinks few bucks cheaper before u go to ur table.. lol"}
{"text":"Always a wonderful meal at Dominick's! Have dined here several times since opening. Never a bad meal, always great wine and the service is absolutely stellar. A great place to celebrate something special!"}
{"text":"The rudest bartenders ever!!!!  They all run around and do everything but wait on you!!   The bar was barely full and waited for 2 of them to even acknowledge us.  NOT worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Ok Dominicks,  I see your manager does read the reviews on here as they were nice enough to contact me and ask for a \"DO OVER\"  and yes it put you back on my list of great Steak Houses!  I am in the people business too and I know sometimes things happen and the only thing you can do is try to earn that business back and I commend you for doing so.  I had the Fillet and not the Ribeye this time and it was great.  Will recommend you to my new out of town clients again.  The pork belly was yummy as well for all you meat lovers!"}
{"text":"I'm on a roll! This is my second time here this week.  This 8 oz. medium rare filet mignon has got to be the best steak EVER. The cream spinach equally matches it. Oysters were Fabulous with very fresh \"atomic\" horseradish. Side dishes are very large.  Added to the ambiance a very rich feel, blue pool upstairs, open roof to let a light breeze in and a very good piano/singing talent. This is by far my favorite place to dine. If you want to impress someone, bring them here."}
{"text":"Reminiscing my last night in Scottsdale. Dinner at Dominick's Steakhouse was delicious! I had the Filet Mignon with a glass of Shiraz. The Fielt had a salty, crispy outside and tender, juicy, medium rare center. We ordered several side dishes for the table but my top 3 definitely had to be the Corn Crème brûlée, Dominick's Potatoes and the Asparagus. The service was pretty awesome too!"}
{"text":"It's certainly a beautiful steakhouse located in the desirable Scottsdale Quarters. And you'll find Aston Martins, Maserati, Porsche & etc valet at the entrance of this establishment. I enjoyed the live entertainment, a band singing oldies and R&B. It's low lighting stages a romantic feel. Service is as expected. Portion sizes are large enough to share. But I've had equally better and worst steaks. The food is simply average. It's honestly a ordinary steakhouse that charges extraordinary prices."}
{"text":"Great location and ambiance, especially if you're looking for a romantic evening out. I had the petite filet which was melt in your mouth, and the service as to be expected was excellent. It can be a little over the top and feel uppity, but considering the area in North Scottsdale I think it's par for the course and I'm sure most diners actually appreciate that about them.  The desserts I don't think are that great...which is surprising to me. I'll order an extra glass of wine the next time I'm there instead. Overall I think this is a great steakhouse and if you haven't tried it, it is a definite must!"}
{"text":"I really hate to only give them 3 stars, but it's gotta be done. I don't generally drop $200+ on one dinner, so I expect it to be \"Holy crap that was awesome\"... and this wasn't.  This is a beautiful restaurant, let's get that out there. Very impressive and elegant.  The pool area was closed, so we were seated in the 2nd level interior area. The place was cacophonous, between the other diners and the LOUD music; I work in a nightclub, and I was using my work voice just so my other half could hear me. There were a ridiculous number of staff and managers about; it felt as though someone was always hovering nearby. Not very relaxing.  Our server seemed like he was burnt out of his job. He brought the wrong bottle of wine, and was visibly irritated when I pointed it out. My filet and OH's strip were both requested medium rare; mine came out raw and bloody, and again when we pointed this out, our server lectured me on \"Well, yours is a thicker cut\". Ok, so cook it longer? That doesn't change what \"medium rare\" should be. He cooked it up, but by that point it was charred so badly it had no taste left.  The prices are fair for a high end steakhouse, but I was a little floored at $76 for the 'add-on' surf and turf to OH's steak. It was one very small lobster tail and 4 crab legs. Definitely overpriced.  They did bring out a piece of cake for OH's birthday, though it tasted like Frys bakery cake, and we weren't offered coffee or a dessert menu at all otherwise.   We will be trying Mastro's next time.  PS to management: We already let someone know, but we were very impressed with the server assistant named Riley. He is the kind of guy who should be a server, super helpful and great personality."}
{"text":"The restaurant is beautiful, great food & the server/Ula was supurb!! We were disappointed at how they packed everyone in at the top of the stairs right next to each other, instead of spreading their customers around the restaurant, to keep the noise at a tolerable level & not so packed-in like other less costly restaurants do!  There were two extremely loud tables (of adults) right next to us (and we had a well mannered & quite 6 y/o) & nothing was done!  The mgr was on the floor watching the floor throughout the time that we were there.  It was so frustrating having to deal with rude customers where we would have to raise our voice to hear each other for the couple of hours that we were there!  We didn't expect to have that type of disruption to our dinner in this type of restaurant."}
{"text":"The place was just beautiful. I was able to sit next to Tyne pool and there was a retractable roof above it. I thought it would be cold but I was fine since they had heaters. Ordered the calamari and was surprised because o didn't realize I also was getting shrimp! Everything was exceptional! From beginning to end!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place to go. The service has been impeccable, the food always done perfectly, and an unparalleled ambiance. I recently went for New Years Eve, where Ula ran our service. She is a grade-A server - attentive but not intrusive, and warm but not saccharine. She orchestrated our meals & service without a hitch. She offered guidance on the menu, actually discouraging we order as many sides as we originally communicated, assuring us we had enough for the table as-is. She was right. ...and we still had enough for tomorrow's leftovers! I highly recommend Ula. We overtipped because she's worth well over 20%."}
{"text":"Next to Eddie V's, this is hands down one of the best steak houses my hubs and I have been to in North Scottsdale.  Five stars for service: water never got half empty as there was always a waiter to fill it up. Our meal orders were taken perfectly and to our liking. Friendly  staff and we never had to wait for somone.  Five stars for food: My husband LOVES a good, rare filet and Dominick's delivered exceptionally. No frills, just a perfectly cooked filet with excellent flavor. I loved my beet salad--delicious!  And all our sides, including my mashed potatoes (though a little over-salted) were rich.  Five stars for environment: Just as I expect a steakhouse to be--low, sensual lighting, beautiful light fixtures,  and clean dining tables with just the right touch of elegance.  For special occasions, this is not one to miss!"}
{"text":"I know my steak... as I don't drink any more, my only vice is food, and, specifically, awesome steaks!  Had steak all over the world, Peter Lugar in NY, etc.  Had 2 out of 3 best steak meals of my life at Dominick's.  Both were wagyu selections - the Bone in Tomahawk Ribeye for 2 was #3 and #1 was the Wagyu Ribeye Cap.  Unreal.  Just order either medium rare, you won't ever have anything close to it.  The #2 best steak was at sister restaurant Steak 44 - the Wagyu Fillet 12 ounces of softball-sized heaven on a plate.  Don't mess around with Mastros, Flemings, Mortons, Eddie V's, blah blah blah, dude just roll up to Dominicks or Steak 44 I'm telling you their wagyu is da bomb.  Also try happy hour at Dominick's the value is unmatched."}
{"text":"There's only one thing I can say about this place... AMAZING!!! If you love food you will absolutely love Dominick's!"}
{"text":"EXCELLENT STEAK & ATMOSPHERE Filet was superb - flavorful, moist, tender and delicious. Ribeye was also great tasting, but not very tender as compared to the filet. Lobster mash is dynamite. Enjoyed the option of a smaller side portion, though the small is enough to feed 3-4 people. Loved the binget tree for a light dessert. Dark, intimate and romantic modern setting.  Though we love Maestro's we prefer Dominick's. We will be back!! A \"10\" in this foodie's book.  ...next time we'll try the Tomohawk."}
{"text":"The filet melted in my mouth. Hottest steak I have ever eaten better than Ruth Chris, Morton's, Prime and others. We were with a large party in the wine room which was stunning.  Amazing appetizers of the meatballs and spicy shrimp. Our group had the asparagus, Brussel sprouts and scalloped potatoes. The vegetables were fresh and not overly seasoned as with most chop houses. Ended my meal with fresh berries. Portions are large. The staff was amazing and the service top notch. Only reason not 5 Star was due to a billing error."}
{"text":"This restaurant screams expensive with decked out lighted floors, gorgeous lighting and a lovely dinning room. However it is not as great as the ambience it tries to provide. I ordered a filet mignon and I think it was good but not amazing. The salad I had with Artichoke to start was good. The mixed drink I ordered was so so. I had to add honey since I didn't think it was sweet enough. The staff is very attentive and the portions are huge. Expect to pay $100 a person if you all get a starter, entree, drink, and share a dessert. I found the potatoes au gratin to be terrible. Way too cheezy I almost died. The spinach side was okay but sour. I would come back but skip the butter cafe, the mixed drink, and coffee. Also it is $6 to valet which I find to be not horrible since parking at Scottsdale Quarter is hard to find."}
{"text":"Absolutely the BEST steak I have ever had! The service was outstanding and the pace was perfect. This is a must do when in Scottsdale! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic service and great food!!  We were first timers here for my husbands birthday, and had a great experience. I actually made the reservation through open table and Im glad I did it in advance! They were very busy for a random Thursday night.  Atmosphere is classy looking like most steakhouses, but they play more modern beats which is a nice change. We were seated at a booth table \"upstairs\" and our servers name was Brad. Let me tell you, Brad provided amazing service!! He was very enthusiastic about the menu & wished my husband a sincere \"Happy Birthday.\" You can tell he likes his job and he was very personable.  Food was obviously great! We ordered sauteed shrimp & fried deviled eggs to start, then petite filets, crab & rock shrimp mac n cheese, & corn brulee. The menu is very similar to Steak 44, but I much prefer this location because the overall experience exceeded any from Steak 44. Steaks were perfectly seasoned and cooked to order, the mac n cheese is to DIE FOR, & I loved the crunch sugar bits in the corn brulee.  For dessert, we got a complimentary Cookies n Cream popcorn sundae which was also very delicious. We also enjoyed drinks-- Strawberry Rhubarb cooler (very refreshing) & my husband got the Effen Vodka blood orange drink (I forgot the name.)  Overall, excellent service and food-- will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place was well worth the money!  The ambiance was great, our server was helpful and the food was great. I highly recommend the crab and avocado appetizer, the hassleback potatoes as a side and the butter cake for dessert. Pick whichever steak you want- you will be happy!  We got to sit upstairs near the pool which was very nice. Fun times!"}
{"text":"Came here with the extended family for Christmas Eve.  Service was excellent.  Nick was our waiter and he did a great job.  Everyone had steak except one the of the munchkins.  Everyone's steal was cooked perfectly and delicious.  The kitchen was happy to accommodate a few off-menu requests to appease the kids' palates.  This place is one of the best steakhouses in the country.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"First time here and it won't be the last! Amazing Happy Hour menu! On Saturday! Lucky our bartender was super nice and efficient. I could not believe the Maine lobster grilled cheese on sour dough bread! It was DELICIOUS! If I could give this place ten stars I would. We will see you next year. We own a restaurant so we only can get away once a year. I wish we had a bartender like Lucky! You are lucky to have her!"}
{"text":"The dining experience at Dominick's never disappoints. The restaurant is elegant and relaxing, with a unique upper floor swimming pool surrounded by tables. My top choices are the Mignon, Wagyu, Chilean Sea Bass, and Scallops. I don't feel that the New York Strip or Ribeye has ever been tender enough, especially after several minutes. The side dishes usually have about 2+ servings (or 4 small), so if you have a party of four, you will want to choose a few sides. My favorites are the Dominick's Potatoes (Creamy, Cheesy Sliced Potatoes similar to scalloped), Corn Creme Brulee, Mac & Cheese (Italian style with Romano and Provel cheese added to the cheddar), Bacon Brussel Sprouts, and the Creamed Spinach (buttery and sweet with corn). My favorite dessert is the layered Chocolate Cake with Cherry Compote, garnished with white & dark chocolate sticks. The spectacular bar area often has a pianist playing popular songs, and they have private dining for large groups & events. The waitstaff has always been excellent, and the steaks are served sizzling on the hot plate. Price per person: (steak, sharable side, drink & tip) $80+  Dominick's is located in Scottsdale Quarter & near Kierland Commons (shopping areas), and has Valet Parking."}
{"text":"Some really Great selections of Corn Fed Beef as well as some special toppings. The Beignet's were better than New Orleans! The Blood Orange Italian Martini was one of the best I have had.........  Upscale and yet not too stuffy."}
{"text":"Excellent steakhouse. The butcher's cut is one of the tastiest steaks I have ever had. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"LOVE Dominick's! The food is equivalent to any other steakhouse i.e. Mastros, Donovan's etc. But sitting up by the pool makes it so much greater! I take all of my friends and family who are in town visiting for dinner there. Always a great experience."}
{"text":"Upscale, white table cloth, servers truly trained to spot when someone seeks service.  We were downstairs for this experience.  It was a packed house and truly so noisy having a conversation was nearly impossible.  If this is your thing you will be pleased - a great place for a couple having relationship problems - lol.  Hey, it all looked good!  Unfortunately my filet was not very good - which doesn't fit with what I hear about their steaks.  I hear the upstairs open patio is pretty amazing so I may be back for that - and maybe that's where you should start!"}
{"text":"Two thumbs up! We went with a group of 6 and had a lovely experience. The food a service was top notch. Average steakhouse prices, but above average attentiveness of the staff. Jonathan G. really took care of us, even brought us a group desert on him! Thanks Jon!  My only criticism would be for them ot offer a grass-fed beef option, I was told all their meat comes from corn-fed cattle, sans the Wagyu."}
{"text":"Been a while since we have dined at Dominick's, so we hit it up Sat. night.  We have found that dining in the bar high top tables is the way to go, more living an better people watching. Walked in and got a nice table, more empty that we thought it would be and even at leaving at 8pm still wasn't fully crowded. Dining in the rooms is nice, but not really where the action is.   We were greeted pleasantly and as always the service from the hostess to the bus boy is always top notch. Very accommodating. The were out of the wine I choose from the reserve list, but we found another great bottle. No biggie.  Had the steak as always and the bride had the Halibut special, both were great and seasoned perfectly. The mac & cheese is really good. Deserts were tasty, and they accommodated some changes we asked for. The coffee which is great, was only warm and not hot, again no biggie.  Its a great place to enjoy a night out, and a nice crowd with no riff raff.  Valet is the only way to go here, it's that or fight for parking around the place. Then have to fight the army of strollers and kids running around screaming. Not Dominick's fault though.  Again, glad we dined with them and will come back again."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the service was great. We brought our well behaved 4 year old along and even though they don't have a children's menu, they were very accommodating. I had the scallops and I would give those 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I only give them a 3 due to the service and excessive bread crumbs.   First impression was the girls upfront are snotty bitches. We had to push our dinner reservation an hour and the three girls up front literally talked shit to each other about our group when three of them walked away to get seated. Should have saw the look on there face when they realized I was in the party and just heard everything they said.   The restaurant itself is very nice. It would have been better to sit up top but someone rented that out for a private party.   Our initial waiter passed us off to an Asian guy which we all thought was odd, including our \"new\" waiter.   Entrees were very good. Filets, ribeye and sebass were what you would expect. The sides on the other hand were extremely disappointing. The creamed spinach and mac and cheese weren't just topped with panko, they were completely mixed in which made them disgusting. Thankfully the mashed potatoes didn't have any at all.   Make sure you are very specific when asking to box up the leftovers!! Out of a ribeye, two filets and 3 sides all that was packed was the ribeye and 1 filet. And there was a lot left on the sides since we hardly touched 2 of them.   Might give it another shot when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Impressed!  The atmosphere, service, quality of food was everything I could ask for.  I had the Filet Mignon and it was so tender and perfect tasting. I can easily say that it was the best steak I've EVER eaten hands down.  Sides and wine were also amazing!  I love this place and will be back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Met some new friends for dinner (their suggestion) with reservations at 5pm on a Sunday evening.  Upon entering through the awkward revolving door, the two hostess were friendly enough but said the party we were meeting was not there and would we like to be seated.  We agreed to be seated at our table but I stopped to admire the pretty bar on the way and there were our friends, having a drink at the bar!!  They said they had checked in but apparently the hostess had forgotten!  The place was empty (one other table seated) and we were seated in a dull area, on the edge of the dining room.  We asked for another table and they said they had to check which tables were available!  We were then seated under the stairwell, which was weird and uncomfortable.  We asked to be moved again and they again said they had to check availability!  Mind you there was only one other table in the whole place occupied.  We finally found a good table and moved again.  After asking for the loud music to be turned down we could finally settle in and get to know our new friends! (btw, the place never did get very crowded).  So, wanting to make a long story short.....  This place is soooo overpriced it isn't even funny.  And the service does not even come close to the high prices!  Very mediocre service.  We had to ask our server for more bread, more butter, more drinks and just about anything else that a waitress should have been aware of us needing!!  Really??  We will not be going back!  The steaks were so small they looked microscopic on the huge plates they were served on. Plus the super hot plates, continued to cook them until they were overdone for what I ordered!!  And the cost was absurd.  If you want a much better steak and dining experience, go to Roaring Forks and give them a try.  Way better quality and service!!  Not at all impressed and number one on my do not go back list!!"}
{"text":"My gosh what an excellent steakhouse!  Polished front end staff. Courteous people throughout. Service was appropriately attentive. Utterly spotless.  Steaks prepared perfectly to temperatures ordered. Servings appeared to be larger than sizes advertised - a smart move! Small NY strip was plenty big and bone-in ribeye was incredibly flavorful. Whipped potatoes were very tasty. The hand cut fries do have truffle oil and you really should know that flavor and like it or take a pass - a bit oily for me.  Their wine, spirits and bar menu are for the novice to the most picky connoisseur. The 14 year old Oban, served neat (a singular orb of ice is an option), was a decadent treat to accompany my meal.  Here's a steakhouse that keeps things pure and simple. No need to ruin a good cut of beef with pounds of butter or herbs or any number of other ways to ruin the experience.  My ONLY negative: what is up with the music played in the dining room? I don't get it. From Frank Sinatra to current pop. Why not a simple set of innocuous classical music or gentle jazz? I did find this a distraction."}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent entertainment was only topped by the unreal bone in fillet!! Possibly the best steak I have ever had!!"}
{"text":"Dominick's is an upscale steakhouse with superb service. Owned by the original Mastros team it has same atmosphere, service and food items.  We had a really great table overlooking the bar area.  A perfectly done and tasty calamari appetizer shared by four of us. I split a really well seasoned and tender bone in filet with my \"date\" and shared a Caesar salad with jumbo prawns.  A huge side of shoestring potatoes that  were so addicting. Two bottles of decent wine, shared delicious raspberry sorbet and butter rum cake and a hefty bill.  Special occasion restaurant or happy hour.  Pricey place and although food very good it is difficult to justify it being good enough for the cost.  However, portions are large.  Must say I did enjoy the evening and like being in that atmosphere!!!! Maybe I can justify the cost occasionally!!!"}
{"text":"I am sorry this place is beautiful to look at but the food is a huge disappointment.  I wish I didn't have to say it but City Hall is better.  I should start from the beginning...........  I had been looking forward to come here, so by the time our reservations rolled around I was ready to eat!!!!  We arrive about 15 min before our reservation, and proceeded to the bar to order a drink.   First the access to the bartender was impossible and when we finally ordered my boyfriend had his drink in a few minutes and my glass of champagne no where to be seen ( we will revisit this later)  We waited for 10 min before the rest of our party showed and we were seated.    NOTE - they do have good music, and you can sit at the grand piano and have apps and cocktails.  The live music is a great cover.  Upon sitting we promptly notified our waiter that we had not paid for our drinks at the bar and that I had ordered a glass and never received it.  He then took our drink order and returned with the beverages and I finally received my glass.  About 5 mins after that the server comes back with the first glass I ordered sitting down a 20 min old champagne that was flat and room temperature at that point - and proceed to charge me for it!!!!!  He appeared to think this was an accomplishment that he found the glass, I was at this point just annoyed and thought it was poor taste.  The Food:  Such promise to fall so flat, the menu does offer a variety other than steak, but a larger seafood selection and some chefs specials.    Apps - we ordered the Calamari and the Burrata with Roast Peppers ( why they give 1 piece of crostini for 4 people I don't understand)  I had to ask for extra 2X and then is dropped about 7 pieces on the plate ( OVERKILL)  The calamari was decent but nothing to rave about, the breading is lighter and there are two dipping sauces, and remulaude and cocktail.  I ordered the Bone in Filet Medium, this is were I just get upset.  It comes out half well done and the other half raw!!!!!!!!!!!! I am not even sure how one can achieve cooking a steak that bad but it was the worse I have ever had, EVER.    Sides - FAMILY STYLE, so if you order, 1 side will split 4 ways easy, the server said that it would serve 4 tops, but I think it could push serving 6 people.  We had the Gouda Cheese Au Gratin COLD & UNDERCOOKED  Broccoli - UNDERCOOKED AND HARD, in fact I really wanted to send it back, but at this point it was just pointless.  I really just wanted to finish my meal  Gnocchi - Has to come from a BAG, no one would make gnocchi that big and you could barely taste the lobster in it.    Needless to say, just the whole place fell flat.  The service wasn't bad but not steller as I would except for a $700 meal (4 people and booze included)  They are suppose to have another bar and water feature up stairs on the 3rd level, they were at capacity so we were not allowed to check it out.  I think the place my stay busy because of location and the crowd is definitely a certain crowd.  However I will be staying to old faith full City Hall in Old Town."}
{"text":"You know what!! This place and its happy hour is just amazing! Lindsey at the bar was amazing and very knowledgeable! Family had the steak and potatoes and steak and scallops!! The wine and mixed drinks! I have nothing but joy speaking about Dominick's !! I shall be back"}
{"text":"Had a bday party there last night. Ordered the ribeye and shared sides- cream corn, broccoli and tater tots also some oysters. Steak an oysters were fantastic- sides were just ok and small portion. Cocktails were incredible. They also have live music 7 nights a week- could end up being one of my new favorite places to eat/drink and listen to music. Service was great- had the private room for our party, very attentive staff and then took the party upstairs and enjoyed the night while seated at the piano and great Arizona weather with open roof."}
{"text":"My first time dining at Dominick's did not disappoint! The layout of the building is quite interesting; downside here is that it's pretty crowded and very dimly lit. Makes for an interesting journey up to the top floor. There's a pool upstairs in the middle of the room which makes for some sweet ambiance. The music was also great; a blend of pop, rock and house set the mood for a vibrant evening.  The food exceeded my already high expectations of the place. For appetizers we went with crab cakes and shrimp Dominick; both very delicious. I went with the lobster for my main course; it was cooked to perfection. Don't even get me started on the lobster mashed and the loaded mashed potatoes..... They were melt-in-your-mouth heavenly. My mouth is water just thinking about them.... Last but not least, the créme brûlée.... Woah. This is by far my favorite dessert of all time, and I kid you not when I say this was the best I ever had! May go back just for the dessert. All in all it was a great experience and I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Decided to take a break from our regular steakhouse that we usually go too for date night(Ocean Club) and give Dominick's a try. From the moment we walked in it was such a pleasant experience from the over the top friendly hostess to the buss boys. Our server was Ula, she was so sweet and very informative! We ordered the Ribeye with the truffled lobster it was amazing. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and this place was amazing. I didn't care much for the seafood tower. The bone-in ribeye is to die for and I would definitely recommend getting the Au Gratin as the side. I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"Our night began by pulling up to the Valet parking and opening my own door as well as my girlfriends door and about to walk into the restaurant before they even acknowledged us and gave me a ticket.  We waited a good 10 min before being greeted and given menus.  The service over all was some of the worst I have had for a \"High End\" restaurant.  The music was the most bizarre blend of everything from 80's to Justin Bebier, which is not what I expect from a classy steakhouse.  The food was decent, I will give it that.  After spending $550 for two people to eat, and having to ask for our glasses of champagne and water to be refilled, I doubt I will return again. The service needs major improving.  The dishes were less than exciting to look at.  Just a steak dropped in the middle of a huge plate and boring sides to look at.  I almost forgot about the uncomfortable chairs I we were sitting in.  They have these silly cushions with the zippers broken and plastic coming out the sides."}
{"text":"First, the not so good. We went to Dominicks to celebrate Father's Day. I called the night before for a reservation and was told that they only had 6:30 or 8:30 available, no problem we'll take 6:30. We arrive and are seated next to the kitchen and busing station. The entire time we were there the restaurant remained half empty. Why force us into an early dinner at a bad table when there are plenty of better options? I thought the place was supposed to be fairly fancy, and they even have a \"proper attire required\" sign at the hostess desk. Unfortunately they don't enforce it at all. The \"gentlemen\" at the table next to us were wearing cargo shorts, flip flops, t-shirts and ball caps. Sorry if it makes me a snob, but it kind of annoyed me. Now on to the good. The steaks are great, though I agree with what others have said about them being too salty. The bread basket is amazing! The creme brulee was the best I've ever had. The service is excellent with plenty of help around to make sure your glass is refilled and you have everything you need. The decor is fabulous, in my opinion. Over the top, but in a good way. Overall though I don't think its worth the price. You're looking at $100 per person unless you drink water, skip a first course and desert. There are so many good steaks in town these just don't stand out as being all that special."}
{"text":"I was so ready to enjoy Dominick's... my husband and I save eating at expensive restaurants for rare occasions in our life. Enjoying the anticipation and the reward we're about to give ourselves is as much a part of the experience as the actual eating itself so it's something we treat ourselves to sparingly so it doesn't become mundane.  We had reached one of these time-to-celebrate occasions for something or other and it happened to coincide with an overwhelming desire for a good steak. Dominick's is just across the street from us and we'd not been there yet so we decided it was the perfect opportunity for our evening out!   Unfortunately, we both ended up a little disappointed.  Let me say firstly I don't mind a high priced restaurant menu, not at all. But if you're pricing your menu in the realm of the 4 and 5 dollar signs, your restaurant - the ENTIRE restaurant experience - should live up to that rating.  That means knowledgeable and courteous wait staff, smooth handling by hosts and hostesses, elegant decor and atmosphere, professional management, creative and beautiful food presentation and exquisite quality. Skillfulness should be present in all areas. And in Dominick's I found it lacking.  We had reservations around 7:30 on a weeknight. We were greeted by a gum-chewing hostess at the front propped on her elbows looking bored and then escorted to a table against the back wall of the restaurant.There was hardly anyone in the place and they seat us in the most remote spot, away from the only people that *were* there.   (Note to Dominick's - atmosphere in a restaurant is generated not by making remote islands of guests at either ends of a space, but by putting them just close enough together so that a collective energy is born from people enjoying themselves being in proximity to one another.)  Personally I found the decor cliché: padded leather walls, dark colors - design choices that smack of old rich white men in their exclusive country club yukking it up with their gin and tonics. I understand the style may resonate with some so I don't find any fault with the restaurant about it at all, it's clearly a personal preference. Just not one I'd make were I to design the interior of a high end steakhouse in Scottsdale.  After having been seated, our server couldn't be bothered with much beyond \"What can I get you?\" He was preoccupied with something all evening. I realized only after I heard another server present some daily specials to her customers that our guy completely blew over that part of the usual routine. He also hadn't asked if we wanted cocktails or wine and when we got there, he didn't mention dessert possibilities at the end... nothing. The guy was adequate at best and did nothing to contribute to an enjoyable evening.  Unfortunately this says to me, even if it's not 100% true across the board, that the bar isn't set very high during Dominick's hiring process. It's a delightful feeling when you sit down at a table in a restaurant and find yourself being taken care of by a consummate server -  in the industry for years, knows the menu like he created it, and handles his customers with aplomb yet not intrusive. It's a magical thing. I acknowledge it's not fair for me to expect that every single time - after all, not everyone's an artist - but I do expect a little more from a server at a supposed high-end restaurant than \"What can I get you?\" or \"Anything else?\" which is all we were treated to.  The food is fine - although I give presentation a big fat ZERO. No creativity here - bare white plate with a piece of steak on it. I almost laughed. While it wasn't extraordinary, the steaks were cooked as asked and the quality of the meat *is* excellent, but something was off. To me, the place was masquerading as one thing (high end primo restaurant you should want to visit because of its name and location), but in reality it's something else and I couldn't put my finger on it until we got home.  We were also graced by two roving managers who didn't know what each was doing. The first gentleman showed up wanting to know \"how things were going\". Um... ok as I have a bite in my mouth? Then not 10 minutes later a different man, also introducing himself as a manager interrupted our meal again asking the same thing. Come on guys! Really? Here we are in cocktail attire, in a mostly empty restaurant, stuck against the back wall in la-la land, trying to enjoy time together that we've purposely set aside for an expensive meal and you bumble about the place like it's ... like it's...  A tourist trap.  *That* was what I couldn't put my finger on while I was there. Packaged up all pretty (oh you should see the foo-foo cars they like to park in front of their entrance) but on the inside it was slightly cheesy, dated, mundane service, and food that looked like someone slammed it on the plate in a hurry.  Do yourself a favor if you're looking for class. Go elsewhere."}
{"text":"First time here, what a cool location, the whole space is very unique and on a very grand scale.  I dined with a large group last night for a co-workers 40th and we had a really great time.   The service was impeccable, they didn't hover, but for a large somewhat rowdy group everyone's wishes were met promptly.  We were seated in the top floor \"pool area\" and they opened up the roof, the weather was amazing last night so this was a very nice touch for the event.    The menu was prix fixe, and I loved that they went as far as to print a special and personalized \"Happy Birthday\" menu for friend.  We had the Calamari and their amazing dinner rolls for the appetizer and I had a wedge salad with blue cheese to start and chose the 12 oz NY encrusted with blue cheese (not on the menu but they accommodated) as my entree.   The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare, and the blue cheese was browned on top.  We had mashed and brussel sprouts, both were very good.  The standout, and it's a small thing was the Blue Cheese both on the salad and the steak it was amazing.   As a special touch they had a magnum of my friends favorite wine and asked all the guests to sign it with a silver sharpie, what a great reminder that will be for her for years to come.  Hats off to Jeff and the team at Dominick's for taking extra special care of us and filing our bellies with a delicious meal.  The \"upgraded\" desserts at the end were brilliant, they gave a sampling of every sweet treat on the menu.   Killer beignet trees, S'mores, and buttercake!"}
{"text":"Fantastic, swanky, fun restaurant. Go for a nice meal or happy hour (I was surprised to see how great their happy hour specials are). My parents dine here regularly and we were lucky enough to join them last night. We had a little bit of everything. Every dish was delicious and our server, Liz, made the dining experience extra special. We had a small hiccup on the preparation of a steak, but the manager, Brian, went above and beyond to make it right. Fantastic customer service all around. If you have been contemplating going...GO! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"It's a crime that these guys only have 3.5 stars.  I have been multiple times and always had a great experience.  5 star steakhouse....no doubt."}
{"text":"We had our Christmas party on the upper floor.  Sliding roof was sweet, eating inside but has the sky open to the stars.  Food and service was excellent, maybe a little on the automatic and less personal side, but it could of been because we were a larger group.  Occasionally they were a little quick to take are plates and food with out asking if we were done yet to bring the next part of our meal.  All in all good service, great food, great atmosphere, I had Prime Rib and it was amazing.    TIP: There is a pool in the middle of the room, it is shallow with lights floating like candles. It creates a nice atmosphere but for larger groups it makes it hard to mingle and get around with out the fear of falling/stepping in. I would not recommend a group of over 50."}
{"text":"Happy Hour Heaven!  Love this hip happening spot!  We enjoyed the Calamari and Shrimp app and thought we had died and gone to heaven-crunchy, generous, soulful seafood.  We also indulged in the steak and scallops-which were delish but I wanted a few more scallops to make me swoon. To top off all of this yumminess are the over the top yeast rolls, served piping hot and buttery in a cast iron pan.  No butter needed! The cocktails and wine are a large pour and expertly mixed.  We love to find happiness here!"}
{"text":"I had never been to Dominick's and I like trying new restaurants so I was excited to check it out.  We had a reservation for 8 pm on Saturday night and when we showed up the restaurant was busy.  It definitely is catering to those that want to be seen and show off what they have.  As we were walking up they had 6-7 of your finest vehicles backed in right next to the front door.  Calling it a front door is a little misleading however.  I found it interesting for such a nice restaurant to have a revolving door as there entrance.  Once inside the door you are greeted by what is a darkened \"Liberace\" type decor.  Think big chandeliers and crushed velvet.  We were seated promptly for our 8 pm reservation.  Top line the food was mediocre.  We between the 4 of us we ordered the  Scallops, Halibut, and the Ribeye as our entrees.  For our sides we ordered the potatoes, gnocchi, and creamed corn as our sides.  The main issue that we all had with the food was that it was very salty.  At one point my buddy across the table asked me \" does yours taste really salty?\". I answered yes and everybody else chimed in that theirs was quite salty as well.  I don't know if the chef was having a bad night but if not he needs to pump the brakes on his salt usage!  Finally this place isn't the cheapest place.  I am not one to complain about prices and I eat at fine dining restaurants on a weekly basis as part of my job.  Our bill for the 4 of us was $500.  We did have a couple drinks a piece but the price we paid did not match the quality of food we received.  My advice is to check out the bar for a few drinks and enjoy the people watching.  Think Phoenix Open.  Otherwise if you are looking for a good steakhouse head across the street to Ocean Club."}
{"text":"We've been to a lot of steakhouses all over the country. This one wasn't somewhere we would go back to. The steak was over. I found my filet a little flavorless. There wasn't any salt or pepper on it. The atmosphere was a little strange. They were playing music from Madonna to Simon and garfunkle. Just odd. Our favorite so far in the Phoenix area is Steak 44."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! We went here for a company outing and the steaks were amazing."}
{"text":"Everything you can expect for a high end steak restaurant. The appearance from the outside beautifully matches the appearance on the inside. We were seated in the bar area which was great because I was with a friend so we preferred the lively atmosphere. If I had gone with my wife I would have definitely selected the dining room or most likely the upstairs area. The upstairs area had a decorative pool and cool open roof.   Now for the food. We split the bone in filet, and side of lobster mashed potatoes, asparagus and mushrooms. The steak was excellent! It was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. I really enjoyed the lobster mashed potatoes and the asparagus and mushroom were tasty but nothing out of the ordinary.   We also split their famous butter cake which was so good we almost ordered a second. Next time not splitting the butter cake!  Service was solid, attentive but not intrusive.   Can't say enough about this place. I have eaten at easily over a dozen high end steak restaurants across the country and Dominick is near the top of my list."}
{"text":"Have you ever heard the statement \"it's in the details\"? Well apparently Dominicks hasn't. At least when it comes to some drinks. Don't get me wrong, I love the food. My gripe is about the drinks. When I order a good glass of scotch, paying $25 for a measured pour, knowing that a bottle would cost me $70 at Total Wine, I absolutely have no problem with that. I'm sure Dominicks has a huge overhead and I'm paying for service and atmosphere, which is always good. My issue is, if I am paying a high price for the scotch, don't give me a crappy cloudy obviously made in house ice ball. Any restaurant of this caliber should have a reputable ice company deliver and provide crystal clear ice balls or large single cubes that I could read my menu through. I'm sure this adds to the bottom line a bit, but when you're paying off the cost of a bottle in as little as 2.5 pours, I'm sure you could swing the expense. If that's too much, charge me for the ice ball, just don't continue to muck up customers high end liqueurs with your junk ice balls. Thanks.  Update : 3/8/18. I made another visit to Dominick's last night and once again ordered a glass of scotch. To my delight, it had a single large crystal clear ice cube instead of the cloudy sphere I had on a previous visit. This is how a high end steakhouse should serve their high end liquor when customers request on the rocks. Thank you. My previous 3 star rating is now a 5. All is right in the universe now at Dominick's. ;-)"}
{"text":"The best steakhouse in AZ period end of discussion. They have great seafood too especially the scallops. Creme brûlée corn is like desert and the margaritas are probably the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Dominick's is very much an old-school steakhouse, and I mean that as a compliment.  Their New York strip was simply the best steak I had during my recent Scottsdale visit -- generous portion of perfectly cooked and seasoned meat.  The sides were unambitious (potatoes, snap peas, sauteed mushrooms) but perfectly executed.  Salads were meh.  My sorbet assortment (lemon, grapefruit, blood orange (I think)) were on the bold side (thought the grapefruit was the best), and the portions were extremely generous.  Beer selection was a little weak at the upstairs bar, but good wine list.  Excellent service."}
{"text":"Steaks are perfect! They are a little pricey but worth every penny.   We also had a large group of 35 people-poolside. Everyone raved about how beautiful the place was. The jumbo cocktail shrimp were as big as small lobsters!  The bar is really big, & plays piano music which is cool."}
{"text":"Finally went to Dominick's...  I love steak houses... So I was overdue for a visit.  Ambiance: awesome. No other word (perfect if you want a romantic date or out with close friends).  Service: outstanding.  They knew the menu, timing, etc.  anticipated my need for black napkin, never had an empty drink, extremely polite and prompt without hovering.  Food: fine.  The beet salad was delicious.  The steak was fine... But over-cooked (ordered med rare... Got medium).   Side dishes were fine... But nothing outstanding.  I tasted my friend's pork chop which was very good.  Overall, I expected the food to be better for the high prices.  But I enjoyed the ambiance and service very much."}
{"text":"AMAZING!  The steak is unreal. It comes out sizzling and melts in your mouth. I have dreams about this steak almost every night--cant wait to go there again! We also ordered the truffle fries--SO GREAT! The side dishes are huge!  The place itself is VERY dim lighting and very proper. The waiter we had wasn't very personable but the bus boy was AWESOME! In the end the food made up for any negative aspects I had!   Prices are high--BUT SOOOOOOOOOO worth it!  RECOMMENDED"}
{"text":"So the feedback on this joint is that it is owned by the guys that founded Mastros.  Looks like it.  From the live music to dark wood interiors the restaurant could double for the old location up at Pinnacle Peak and Pima.  The food is good, but inordinately expensive.  Overall, the heavy buttered steaks and 1000 degree plates are really not my thing so I came away unimpressed but in fairness I'm splitting the difference with a 3 star review.    One thing to note is that this place is NOT KID FRIENDLY.  Not even a little bit so even if you get there early and hope you might be able to slide one by your kids, I'd encourage you to reconsider.  No one wants to dine next to a family of screaming children when their average ticket is $150/plate.  Trust me cause I'm the one with the kids."}
{"text":"My husband & I come to Tempe at least 4 times a year.  We just ate dinner here & I can't say enough good things about this incredible upscale Resturant.  The servers were attentive, the management was sincerely concerned about customer service, which is extremely rare these days.  The food was delicious!  Can't wait until our next visit."}
{"text":"The service in this place is unreal. We had an army of servers attend to us. The steak was cooked perfectly and the sides made a perfect match to our main course.   The ambiance of the restaurant was a bit dark and we had requested through a reservation that we would have liked the pool side table. Not sure what happened.   Over all, for the price you pay it could be considered a bit too expensive but the service more than makes up for it"}
{"text":"Very impressive restaurant. Maestro has it down pat. Very nice bar & private area upstairs w/pool. Food & service is what you'd expect & not over the top price-wise. Prefer to steak44."}
{"text":"I revisited Dominick's again in January 2016. Once again, it was a cold evening, as per usual. We were seated pool-side again. I didn't expect for the heaters to work so I brought a big coat and a scarf, but really--my question remains: WHY DON'T THEY TURN ON THE HEATERS???? I have dined at many establishments that have partial outdoor set-ups and they always have their heaters humming. I even took the time to email management about this situation to find out what their answer was. I haven't received a reply. It just ticks me off when customer service drops off. Once you've dined, they no longer seem to care...  The Food: Was delicious. It was as good as the first time I dined. I have no complaints about that. My steak was better than many other \"big steakhouses\" I've been to in 2015. You can read my other reviews to know where I stand on various restaurants that specialize in cow.  The Service: Good except for the lie about turning on the heaters. The waiter agrees to do it and then walks away. He just figures you'll forget by time the food arrives I guess. I don't like being lied to in any area of my life.  Tips about where to sit: The upstairs isn't just COLD in the winter months, but there are other factors to consider. If you want to have a romantic evening or even a nice conversation with your dining partner, I would recommending sitting elsewhere. The problem with the upstairs location is that is where large parties are seated, along one wall. We had the good fortune (NOT) of being next to a table full of haughty 20-something Scottsdale children who were loud, unrefined, and basically an embarrassment to my gender. I was taught good manners for restaurants. I guess this is a demonstration of the \"everyone gets a trophy\" society that we live in. I was appalled at the drunken chatter emanating from this table. I knew EVERYTHING about this 23 year old girl by time they left: age, marital status, that she was no longer on her parents' insurance or phone bill (IMAGINE THAT?). Thus, if you'd rather be insulated from Scottsdale's Finest, I recommend requesting a table elsewhere in the restaurant.  Reservations: Don't show up early. You will NOT be seated one minute before your time has arrived.  To those commenting on the music: Yup, it's a pretty lame mix. I'd rather have nothing than that."}
{"text":"Service: lackluster/unpolished (I expect not to ask someone more than once at this type of restaurant to bring out my bread with my meal and to refill the champagne) Food (except desert): great, no complaints Desert: disappointing  It's a shame Dominicks is such a beautiful restaurant and my husband loved the lobster gnocchi.  Mastro's will continue being our steakhouse of choice."}
{"text":"Mastro's does it again!!!!   Top shelf, outstanding menu, top of the line service and they delivery what they cook.   I had the flash fried shrimp appetizer and it was out of this world.  Salads were incredible.  King Crab is as good as you'll get dining out, scallops off the charts and what can you say about their steaks.................best anywhere.    Not an inexpensive place, but if you want a nice high end steak house.......look no further."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a reservation for dinner at Dominick's and dinner was amazing!! We were sat upstairs by the pool and under the retractable roof which was a nice touch.  What we had: -Super Colossal Shrimp Cocktail -Steak Knife BLT Wedge -Wagyu Filet 12oz -Alaskan King Crab & Rock Shrimp Mac & Cheese  Everything was delicious and the service was excellent! We were way too full for desert but maybe next time ;)  We will be back for more!"}
{"text":"The customer service is absolutely amazing here! If your order comes out wrong they will take a really good care of you and make sure they make it right. The reason why I give 4 stars not 5, is because this is not the first time when my food comes out over salted. Also I think the menu is overpriced (comparing to other steakhouses like city hall or steak 44) and they don't have a live music."}
{"text":"Nice place. Good food. The best steakhouse I've been to in arizona. Dessert, a butter caramel cake, was awesome. Great place to celebrate a special occasion. Only negative, music got a little loud. Just unexpected I guess for a nice atmospheric place for dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing food, great ambiance and impeccable service! Thank you Miroslav for making our experience absolutely delightful. The seafood, fillet, wine & desserts were all fabulous.   We ordered the fillet on the bone prepared medium, it was like cutting into butter. Seabass was cooked perfectly and dusted with light bread crumbs. Whipped mash potato were soft and full of buttery flavor. Mac n cheese topped off with shrimp and crab?? The noodles cooked to the perfect temperature and tossed into a number of cheeses along with seasonings. Topped off with crab and shrimp. Must try!! It was heaven in my mouth!"}
{"text":"Biggest shrimp you can find at a restaurant.  Looked pricey, but it was delicious and my boss paid.  Great place for a business meeting, date, etc.  Hope to try a steak next time."}
