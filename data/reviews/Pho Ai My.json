the food was not spicy. i love spicy food. This place is for people who would like healthy food, then this would be a great choice. the service was good and things went smooth. :)"}
{"text":"Got take out from here the other day and was very pleased. My girlfriend and I ordered pad thai, chicken curry with roti, and lime jalapeno wings. They were all delicious and came in fairly large proportions. I would definitely recommend the jalapeno wings for anyone who likes fried chicken wings. The chicken curry with roti was excellent and pretty spicy (FYI, I soak my food in sriracha!). The pad thai was very tasty--altogether a good representation of the dish. This was the second time we've gotten take out from here and we will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Unpleasant experience with the waiter... place seemed to be understaffed as well 

Food was decent, but overpriced. I ordered a rice dish that came with a sauce. I was given the tiniest amount of sauce. I've been to many other places where the same dish was cheaper and came in larger proportions. 

Lack of condiments. No tea... which is quite unusual for a Viet restaurant"}
{"text":"The pho noodles are flat which was nice because most places I go to are skinny. The broth was light and tasty, not too salty. I chose the chicken pho ga. The spring rolls were light and flaky. Overall, pretty quality pho joint and I will be returning again if ever in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Great bang for buck, despite the degraded interior."}
{"text":"There isn't much to be said that hasn't already been said. 

Ai My is just like any other Pho restaurant, serving dishes that are near impossible to screw up.

The service was attentive, the food came quickly and was delicious and the bill was cheap as hell.

It's why I love falling into darn near any Vietnamese noodle house I can find."}
{"text":"Great spot to stop in for a cheap hot dinner. 6 bucks gets you a nice sized soup full of noodles and chunks of beef. Clean environment, friendly staff. Sort of like, white people Asian food. Except cheap."}
{"text":"It was good food but not great.  Wanted more meat/tendons in there than I got.  But cool place, chill server, quiet atmosphere good for chatting.  Solid."}
{"text":"I was actually on my way to another Vietnamese restaurant but when we passed Pho Ai My, I was all \"Ooh, lookee! So shiny and pretty!\" And against my better judgment we parked ourselves on the sleek white chairs at Pho Ai My. (This is similar to the brain malfunction straight men must suffer when a hot chick enters the room.)

I should've realized that Pho Ai My is in the category of restaurants that have an inverse relationship between the decor and food; the nicer the decor, the worse the food. It's almost like they plunked all their money into the furniture and stylized tableware then didn't have enough funds to pay the chef.

I'd skip the food here and maybe just gaze at the glistening interior and kickass aquarium while sipping a Vietnamese iced coffee."}
{"text":"This place has deteriorated. From the furniture, the service/staff, and now to the quality of the food.

One night, as we were finishing our meal, the staff started to mop the floor. The smell of bleach made us lose our appetite.  Word to the owners - please wait until the restaurant is closed or atleast until the customers have left to mop the floors.

I ordered pho and spring rolls.  The pho came with little to no parsley/green onions/onions and basil. I had to ask for extra.  The spring roll was stuffed with mainly cabbage - it was one of the worst i've ever had.

The service is strange - young kids that are friendly, but not sure if they know what is going on or what needs to be done. 

I am not going back."}
{"text":"Don't know why so many people hate that restaurant... 

I went a couple of time with some friends and we like this place because : 
1) It's cheap
2) the pho is good
3) the place is nice

and... they have the best BÃ¬ Cun (Shredded Pork and Pork Skin Rice Paper Rolls) EVER !!!!!!!

Pho Ai My... what else ?"}
{"text":"Very friendly, Nice atmosphere, clean however, the food is not as good as some other Vietnamese place in China town. Price is is also very reasonable."}
{"text":"Not the worst but not the best. I wouldn't come back. The soup is very single noted, they forcefully add in the mint and toppings which just adds bitter mint flavour to the soup. 

On the plus note they are clean, the ambiance is quite hipstery, and they do have an interesting take on Banh Mi with their sliders. 

Seriously guys, stop featuring Pho as your main, you should consider the other lesser known vietnamese dishes such as, Banh mi, Fresh rolls, Banh Xeo, Banh Uot, Thiet Kho. 

And get your staff to suggest different and memorable food items. Customer service is very sedentary. You get more thank you's at McDonald's."}
{"text":"This is a new restaurant in Chinatown. The restaurant gets points for being clean, the modern decor, and decent service, but the food is lacking that flavourful \"oomph\" when compared to offerings from its more established peers up the street along Spadina."}
{"text":"The chicken bun vermicelli with spring roll I ordered was barely passable, the chicken was sparse cut thin and dry. 

The place itself is dirty, not maintained and worn out.  

Consider other restaurant options in Chinatown."}
{"text":"Ordered a pho soup on the phone and they though it was 4 of pho soups. But... Handled it really nice and quick! Great service and awesome soup!"}

{"text":"I know this as Pam's.  I visited during La Nuit Blanche and it was empty.  Guess what?  It is still a great choice!  Friendly service, astounding Viet food, and good value.  I had Viet style pho for $9.  Nice, upscale, with good washrooms!"}
{"text":"Walking from from Eaton Center to Queen Street, not feeling like sushi or indian, I made it all the way to Spadina, got REALLY hungry and ended up here.  This is what happens when you don't have internet to check yelp! You end up at a pho place that is just not that great.  Stupid people inside! You tricked me and made me think this place would be decent.

I don't even know how to describe the pho. It was just mediocre at best.
sad day."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy, just hot pho which had a nice flavor and warmed my soul.  Bit skimpy the chicken but other than that, good flavorful cheap eats.  Also close to the streetcar."}
{"text":"Despite having dined at this establishment during its previous ownership and after, both food experiences were, nevertheless, unsuccessful. That said, the post-renovated modern interior is absolutely fantastic and much needed; however, I just wished that the quality of what I ate was of a similar calibre. The 'Pho Ga' (chicken noodle soup) was ordered on both visits, yet the conclusion was that they were both equally terrible. The broth should have been fully aromatic and rich, but definitely came across as watered-down. The chicken used was immensely dry and shredded to oblivion; and the dish lacked the flavourful--and otherwise greatly influential--garnish of crispy shallots that it deserves. I felt cheated: Pho Oh My."}
{"text":"save your time, money, and palette and go elsewhere! such a disgrace to Vietnamese people all around!"}
{"text":"Tea was good.. Sadly that was about it. There was nothing particularly good about the food and the service was slow. Don't think I'll be repeating the experience."}
{"text":"One of my fav places. Good simple food with fresh ingredients. Great service. Recommend the vermechilli n the curry dish."}
{"text":"Underwhelming. It didn't have a ton of flavor and was lacking meat. The meat that was there wasn't the greatest quality. The serving was very generous--small was HUGE. Service was good too, but I've had a lot of pho and this was average."}
{"text":"Almost as bad as my mother's pho... never again. They also got my drink order wrong and gave me what appeared to be green dye mixed with ice. 

The interior design was modern and attractive, though, and the tables were of great quality.

It's too bad the pho wasn't as good."}
{"text":"Due to the contemporary design I had initially expected non-authentic pho. I was pleasantly surprised by the delicious soup and perfect ratio of soup to noodles to meat. The pho was great!

I have been back several times and Always ordered the pho because it's that good. I haven't tried other main dishes. Spring rolls were yummy too. Well done.

This is my go to Vietnamese place in the area despite the numerous other offerings in Chinatown."}
{"text":"* Pho is average and portions are less then other comparable places
* Place looks clean
* Average priced
* Service can be better"}
{"text":"Dudes and dudettes. What is all this hate.

Don't be fooled by the presentable decor - the food is actually really good, and at very reasonable prices (contrary to the trend of dingy-means-delicious in Chinatown). This might actually be my favourite pho place (yes, yes, I've tried Pho Hung, etc), and they make a mean avocado smoothie.

After much adventuring of Chinatown pho, I have mentally awarded this place my \"favourite\" status. I will be back often - at all hours, but most likely post-drinking."}
{"text":"Located near Queen and Spadina and they recently renovated.  Place look a lot more modern and clean.  Pho was pretty good and the large portion was up to par.  Lots of noodles and enough rare beef.  Soup broth itself was tasty.  Service was quick and friendly.  Place was half full on Sat night so no need to wait for spots."}
{"text":"We ducked in this inviting looking Pho joint on our way up Spadina after a night out on Queen St. It was open after 2 am, so that was great, but we were the only ones there which was rather odd on a Friday night. The interior is attractive with white ceramic tile walls and a nice view of the street with its corner lot. Interestingly, there is a small patch of no-man's land between the restaurant and the street that seems out of place for such a modern looking restaurant. It appears that a patio could go in that space but there possibly was a problem using it. I'm not sure what our crowd was expecting that night, but when we got a blank stare when someone asked for cold tea, we knew that we weren't in the right place for that! The young guy was trying hard, and came back with our order of bun and glasses of tea with ice cubes. The presentation was first class and the bun was tasty. I got the impression that if one knew the dishes to order, the food could be fantastic. We left, deciding to move on up Spadina for more adventure..."}
{"text":"Et allez encore un viet Ã  rajouter dans la liste ! Etrangement vide un jeudi soir, ce resto se trouve pourtant en plein chinatown. La qualitÃ© de la nourriture est bonne mais ce qui est Ã©tonnant c'est la quantitÃ© de plats et entrÃ©es proposÃ©es, pas loin de 250!.
A essayer si vous Ãªtes dans le quartier.
Comptez 16$ pour entrÃ©e plat et boisson pourboire compris."}
{"text":"3.5 stars?

Bun bo hue was not quite what I was expecting.  It wasn't very spicy though it was indicated as such.  It was good, but not true bun bo hue good.  Does that make any sense?  Not that I'm a Vietnamese food expert or anything...   

The pho was good too.  Most bowls come in small or large sizes.  

Decor was clean and modern.  Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Had a 5 hour lay over so I thought I would venture down to Chinatown for some pho. I would normally go to Pho Hung, but Pho Ai My caught my attention and my appetite with it's modern and clean decor. 

Shortly after I was seated, I started yelping and was kind of surprised to see some of the negative reviews on here.  I decided to give them a benefit of a doubt as most of the negative reviews were written during grand opening week. 

I got the Pho Dac Biet, it was surprisingly tasty and very refreshing too! The Spring rolls were also crispy and satisfying.  Judging from the food and service I received, it looks like they've tweaked their business - I would definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"Pretty good Pho, i did not hate it by any means, but it was just OK, nothing as flavourful, as aromatic and as good as the others within walking distance on Spadina. 

Overall the pho here has a decent broth, it's aroma had strong hints of cinnamon,  but I found it was lacking severely in the Anise department. Again a passable and decent broth, but I've have MUCH better. 

The spring rolls were pretty good as well but again I've had better. One thing that this place does excel at is it's decor, it's definitely a step up from the greasy plastic table cloths, mismatched furniture and questionable cleanliness of the majority of the restaurants on Spadina, if they could only elevate their flavour as much as they did their decor. This place would really be great. 

This place is worth trying but again. there is better and cheaper. 

It should also be noted that This is the only decent pho place that delivers. 

They are also a little more expensive than the other PHO joints on Spadina too, 

large bowl of Pho = $9
2 spring rolls = $4
Cafe Sua Da = $4"}
{"text":"I came here with a group of people last night and we had a good time. The food was really yummy and the prices were pretty good. Everyone seemed happy with their dishes. 

I ordered a chicken curry and rice dish. The rice was interesting. Some of it was crunchy, which I didn't love. It was as if it had been sitting in the rice cooker for too long. Luckily, I was able to continue to enjoy my dish since I knew why it was crunchy. 

The chicken curry was a bit smaller than I thought it would be. When I looked at the bowl I couldn't even find the chicken pieces within the curry sauce. They were there but there wasn't a lot. I found it a bit skimpy but I am happy there wasn't more because by the time I got to the end of my dish, I was full. It was definitely enough food but I wasn't too hungry when I got there either.

This restaurant is okay. I would give them a 2.75 star rating."}
{"text":"Goodbye Ai My.  That was the last time.

I've been going to this place on and off since it's been around.  Nothing remarkable ever happens in my mouth there, but at least, it was clean and pho was pho.  And it was reasonably priced, and great for when you're too lazy to cross the street on Spadina to venture for essentially the same stuff up towards Dundas.

This time: gristly beef (pho tai), bottom-of-pot sodium-shock broth, too few noodles for a medium ($6.50).  Like, NO herbs (one sprig of a browning thai basil is just mocking to an Asian).  Overall, it reminded me of tapeworm.

My dinner date remarked that the shrimp on his rice-plate order was so dry, it was like powder.  

These are clearly end times for the uninspired owners.  White vinyl chairs flaking.  Still clean, at least.  Point."}
{"text":"That Umbrella Guy @ Pho Ai My.

Came back for lunch. Last time I tried a vermicelli bowl and wasn't too impressed (mostly to taste preferences), but perhaps the pho will be better!

Upon walking in the front door, they have an automatic door on the inside. However, it opened halfway and then just suddenly stopped and slowly made its way over. Saw some people walk into the door lol

Tea was served, but was quite flavourless. Way too diluted. Or perhaps it's the tea they use, but it was pretty much like drinking water. Wasn't hot either.

Ordered a large bowl of pho. It came with a few pieces of beef, tripe, and balls, and those were ok I guess, but the noodles were flavourless. The broth itself was also flavourless. Looking at the picture comparing small vs large, it sort of looks pretty much the same, except the large costs $2 more.

In terms of service, you don't really get any unless you call them over.

Washrooms are not well-maintained; toilet paper roll holder is broken so it'll just fall out if you're not careful.

It isn't that much different from the last time, but I wouldn't pay $10 for pho like this."}
{"text":"The restaurant itself has a modern decor with a beautifully backlit wall and grey floral applique which is actually falling off the wall, but still effective. The seats are plush with tall backs and the whole vibe screams money bags especially in Chinatown. And yet the prices of the food are reasonable like chinatown.

There's so much selection here but I decided to go with the tried and true. I had the pho with chicken rice (which is actually just tender boiled white meat chicken without rice) + brisket and beef balls. I really thought the broth was so-so (no cilanto??) but complimented by the brisket which was good and not too fatty. The beef balls actually had flavor in them which I've never experienced in all my pho eating years.

 As per the ordering the unknown, we ordered spring rolls and they brought out these fried egg rolls. In my crew of viet friends, spring rolls are those soft rice paper wrapped rolls that we'd made at \"spring roll parties\". Here at this joint they're the fried stuff that are served at chinese restaurants. We were fortunate to change our order but at first the little server girl refused because \"you ordered it and we made it\".

If you aren't sure what you're ordering here, don't order it. Or ask and prepare for a confusing answer.

In short: 
Flavorful beef balls?? YUM! 
Pho? Good!! 
Ambiance? Nice, romantical almost.
Service? What service?!?"}
{"text":"Not the best place to go as a vegan or vegetarian, but my boyfriend liked his meal so I'm giving it three stars. I ordered some sort of stirfry with tofu, and substituted the noodles for rice. It was a bit bland, I could only taste saltiness from the dish. Service is ok, but the restaurant itself is pretty."}
{"text":"Probably one of the nicest pho places in Chinatown! Pho Ai My is the new kid on the block. Sadly the pho here is rather bland in terms of stock though the beef was of a decent cut however that and the stingy herb dish didn't make up for the rather tepid broth. I may go again to see if it was an off night."}
{"text":"I used to get lunch/dinner here occasionally and  remember that I was so happy to find a good Vietman cuisine near work. The two times I went in recently, I was very disappointed.

The portions were way too small. There was one small piece of tendon and tripe in my soup. I complained the second time it happend. I ordered the large size for take out and opened the box before I left to check. They got my order wrong and would refused to give me what I ordered. And I told the server that portions were too small to be a large. She said the \"noodles would expand in the hot soup.\" Plus the server couldn't speak any english so it was pointless even to argue. 

 worst service and just completely incompetent. I will never be dining here again."}
{"text":"I had Rare Beef and Tendon, which had an amazing broth. I have tried Pho in few other places and the broth was either too fat or too plane very fat but this one was amazing. The meat which came in the soup was a very good cut (no fat parts)"}
{"text":"This was a late night find for us and it was ok. The pad Thai was good and fresh, but the service was slow and distracted."}
{"text":"Been here before a few years ago. Gave it another shot, looks like they did renovations and new owners. I ordered the pho tai. The soup was really tasty and flavorful. 

Place is clean and the waitress was good looking. Mango shake was decent. 

I'd definitely come back for the pho"}
{"text":"++NOTE TO OWNERS++ 
- do not allow your idiot teen-aged kids to serve people, especially when they clearly don't know how to conduct themselves in front of paying customers.
- first impressions matter, because I've blacklisted you based on one experience

++NOTES TO WHITEY++
- don't order and pay for coconut rice, then complain about how much it costs
- don't be surprised if they tell you it will take 20 minutes and it actually takes 20 minutes for you order
- don't pretend to be upset with their service because you are too cheap to pay for the coconut rice and feel you were wronged (the payment transaction has already been completed, you already had a warning!)
- last but not least, DO NOT pull the \"my sister works for Eye Magazine\" bullshit to threaten a small business (even if the business sucks).  No one gives a flying fuck what your ugly sister thinks about a Chinatown Vietnamese restaurant 

++NOTES TO TEENAGE SERVERS++
- do not get into a shouting match with a customer, especially if there are other customers in your restaurant
- last but not least, DO NOT pull the \"we don't need business from 'your kind'\" race card bull shit.  You're clearly trying to attract those who are scared of the dirtier Vietnamese restaurants, which really means the white crowd.  So you DO NEED their business!  I know Asians ain't eating there.

++OTHER NOTES++
- food is average
- won't ever go back because there are way more options with less explosive potentials elsewhere in Chinatown
- congratulations on being blacklisted!"}
{"text":"What I really like about the restaurant is the warm, relaxing, \"hipster\" (the wood panelling and light bulb chandeliers) ambiance. There are not many Vietnamese restaurants that focuses on ambiance. The food itself is okay - nothing special. Prices were relatively inexpensive.  The duck confit banh mi that I ordered was kind of a disappointment though - there was not enough duck confit and there was too much cilantro and carrots. The beef pho that I ordered however, was quite generous, which made up for the disappointing banh mi. The staff were quick and friendly but they could do with a bit of improvement. Despite the restaurant being relatively slow, I was not seated until I actually approached one of the servers. Overall, Pho Ai My isn't the best Vietnamese restaurant, but it's definitely worth stopping by for a quick bite."}
{"text":"This is a solid, modern and comfy place for a quick fix Vietnamese. The food is only average with a slightly bland broth but the fixins and noodles aren't too shabby. The nice setting makes this a great stop to a no hassle meal."}
{"text":"We took a lunch break from meetings, walked to Spadina and it was the first restaurant that we came across. What a surprise. This is Pho and simple Vietnamese food. The spring rolls (chicken) are the best spring rolls I have ever had, we were blown away, fresh, light and crunchy and the filling was just right. We all ordered the Pho Tai, simple.The owner was serving us and gave us the chicken wings, lightly salty and pepper and then the dipping sauce, a lemony peppery sauce, wow! It worked, simple and good. For those below who said the pho is salty, they don't know salty pho, the broth was not too sweet and not salty, they have found a good balance. Menu choices are just right, if I was staying in Toronto I would be back to try their rice dishes. Good food, clean restaurant, reasonably priced, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Came here with the lady the other day, the food was chowed down within 30min. The pho is good size and springrolls are cripsy fresh. It was a very good experience. They renovated the place and now the restaurant is even more welcoming! Absolutely cool pho place in GTA. Go pay them a visit you will be happy!"}
{"text":"updating my review and all i have to say is i'm so disappointed! pho broth was lacking  flavor, chicken wings were a bit on the salty side, and the smoothies were watered down and tasted more like ice than fruit."}
{"text":"The pho was really really salty. I really didn't enjoy it very much. I've had much better pho at Xe Lua. The server didn't speak much English also so communicating was hard.

The seats inside are all ripped up but they have nice walls... Bizzare. The only pro of this restaurant is that it's open late. I won't be back."}
{"text":"This pho restaurant actually looks like a boutique, what with it's minimalist white theme and wrought iron flowers to decorate.

All but 1 table was occupied when we sat down in the front window-table, which was hot because there weren't any shades or curtains to block out the sun.  We migrated to an open table when one became available.  

Most customers seemed to be having pho, so I ordered the pho tai.  The food arrived, and this was when I got confused.  For some reason, this place was bustling - why, when the pho was so bland?  Broth - bland and lukewarm.  Noodles - a little soggy.  Steak - lacking in abundance!  Priced - over.  Bleh.  

Amongst our party, the rice plates didn't seem impressive, either.  I guess you can't really mess up rice, but the chicken was apparently dry, too.  

There were 3 servers, but none came by often enough until the dining room started clearing out.  We had to flag them down.

Overall, I think this place focuses more on their \"hip\" image than they do on the menu.  if you ask me, the food should be first priority.  I'd rather sit in a hole-in-the-wall and have bombass pho than this froufrou dining room where the decor is the highlight of the joint."}
{"text":"Delicious broth and great service. Restaurant was pretty quiet and I like this cafe looking pho restaurant. Good atmosphere and fast service. They filled water every time they pass :)"}
{"text":"Visit : 2 am , Oct 5th 2014 ( Nuit Blanche Night )

Our party of 4 managed to step into the restaurant just as someone was turning off the open sign. The owner was kind enough to allow us to dine, with a welcoming smile and a disclaimer that the kitchen has run out of staples and that only a very limited selection of dishes were available. 

the interiors were sleek, cozy ( though the door lets in a constant draft ) and the tables are spaced well to give just enough personal space.

As famished as we were, we asked what was on offer and ordered Pho Tai nam, Pho Ga, Duck Slider and Bun with Grilled Chicken.

The wait staff were visibly exhausted but mustered up a smile when we wanted to switch tables to sit farther away from the draft. Kudos to them for pulling off service with a smile after a crazy evening with the Nuit Blanche crowds.

The duck slider on bakery style bun was juicy, with just the right amount of seasoning blending into a memorable short eat. ( I do Wish it was a tad bit bigger to last another mouthful .. :)

The Pho Tai Nam was AMAZING and even though they had run out of Thai basil that evening, the subtle but complex flavours shone through ( One of my guests requested and downed an extra bowl of the soup and still wanted more ). The Bun was presented well, and the nuoc mam added the right salty balance to the vermicelli.

During the last half  of our meal, the owner waited on our table letting the wait staff rest, clean up and made sure that we were nourished and satisfied. 

Will certainly make a trip to try out the rest of the menu"}
{"text":"This place has seen much improvement under new management. Service was quick and friendly. 

The place has a new rejuvenated atmosphere that is very welcoming. Very modern decor is pleasing to the eyes. Came here again on a Friday evening and the place was packed. 

I ordered the Bun Bo Hue which is one of the restaurants specialties. You cannot go wrong with this one. Highly recommended for a date night."}
{"text":"Trying out another Pho place after my bad ezperience a few days ago.

Place is pretty clean and modern.  Wasn't busy but given it was 6:30pm Thursday night, what do you expect.  Note: walked by around 7:45pm and they were empty.

Ordered their #1 large and spring rolls.  After taxes, it was just under $15.  Considering the other places in Chinatown, this place was more expensive.  The food was ok, but I think it could have been better?  Noodles, broth, meat etc was just ok.  The spring roll was good.  It was nice and crunchy.

To all you YELPers, I got a free pop when I checked in for the first time.  Don't know how long this offer is for, but make sure you check in.

I would try this place again."}
{"text":"This is an excellent pho place close to Queen and Spadina. They offer a great lunch combo of spring roll, any pho and a drink for less than $10.00. I think a small bowl should be enough, unless you normally get the large bowls. 

I think they renovated since the decor is woody and trendy which is refreshing to see in a humble soup shop. 

The menu is simple and not over complicated. They offer about 6 different kinds of pho with daily specials and appetizers. They also offer vermicelli and rice dishes, but again, not a large menu. 

We also ordered the chicken wings for under $5 and it came with a jalapeno and lime vinegrette. It was quite tasty and it soaked right into the breading. 

Pho didn't take long either and hot and hoisin were already on our table, with little metal cups for the dipping. 

This is going to be my work pho place PHO SURE."}
{"text":"After four days of Polish and Swiss food (I was in Eastern Europe for four days), I was craving Asian food...so stumbled into Pho Ai My thinking that this will be good Vietnamese food.  Given the nice decor, I was hoping that the food would be really tasty, but I was wrong...it's basically just slightly below average.

For $14 CAD, I was able to have the Cha Gio (spring roll), which was okay, the fillings were fine, but the spring roll sheet itself was way too oily.  I ended up getting the sugar cane juice, which was not very good.  I also ended up getting the Com Suon Nuong Trung (pork chop with scramble eggs over rice), which was on a bed of overcooked rice, which did not make me happy.  I looked at the table next to me that had the bun (vermicelli) with cha gio and beef, which was what I would have ordered instead, but that didn't look very good either.  There was also the pho option, but given that it's 25C out, I was just not in the mood for pho.

I was starving at this point (and not sure what time zone I was in), so the meal was fine, but I would never come here again."}
{"text":"Place is actually really good and way better than the other pho places. Not sure why the low ratings here but definitely see for yourself."}
{"text":"For the first time in my life I was shocked that this place did not have dessert. Pleasant service and great location. It was not too busy on a Friday night. There was no background music either. Clean comfortable seating and ok prices. Tried the lemon grass chicken with vermicelli and spring rolls. I wish the portions were a little bigger though. There was chicken fat between the meat which I didn't enjoy with about five pieces of chicken in the entire wish...was a little disappointing."}
{"text":"I have a lot of love for this place. Staff are super friendly and helpful, they genuinely want you to have a good experience, unlike many of the places in Chinatown. They are great with kids. Also unlike most of the neighbouring restaurants the ambience here is actually pleasant, with wooden floors, sleek decor, clean tables, and floor to ceiling windows letting in a ton of light. The pho is great, IMO, although I'm no expert. The bun bo hue especially is excellent - spicy and lemongrassy and cinnamony, rich deep broth, delicious chewy gelatinous chunks of meat, with lots of herbs, cabbage and onion for crunch and freshness. They used to have a calamari patty soup special that I really wanted to try (I think it's northern Vietnamese?), but sadly they took it off the menu before I could. The chicken wings are AMAZING, salty and juicy with the sweet dipping sauce and the spicy jalapeÃ±o slices... so good. The only two things I would improve would be 1) sell beer!!! I thought they applied for a liquor licence ages ago but nothing seemed to ever come of that, which is a shame for those who like a cooling beer with their spicy soup; and 2) get that side patio fixed up and licensed! Then I would probably be here all summer long."}
{"text":"Located just south of Chinatown on the east side of Spadina north of Queen, this restaurant has a modern decor and is very clean. Pho is something you basically can't screw up, so I won't to talk about their Pho dishes.
For starters we ordered their chicken spring rolls, and they were incredible. Lightly fried, they were packed flavour and definitely had the wow factor. They also have a nice selection of very tasty Viet style small sandwiches which make great appetizers too. Service here was very basic, and their servers definitely lack personality. However if your main mission is food, you will definitely like this place .  Prices are very good and you can get a small bowl of Pho (which to me is still very large) and an appetizer for under $10.00. This place does not have a liquor license, and the location is great (especially if you live near Spadina and Front) I have walked by this restaurant several times over the past year and it never appears to be busy, but I am glad I finally tried it out, and I will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Tried this place again now that the ownership has changed. What a difference! Really good Pho. Flavourful broth and  quality ample meat. The salad roll was really good too... Shrimp tasted fresh ."}
{"text":"I always go to Pho Hung, so I figured it was time to give another place a go.  I was hoping for a cold pint on a muggy day, but this place isn't licensed. Settling for a Diet Coke instead, I ordered my regular - Bun with grilled chicken and a spring roll. The roll was legit, but the chicken wasn't as flavorful as it could have been. I prefer some lemongrass, but this had none. It was, however, tender. I enjoyed the Thai basil in the Bun, but I missed the shredded carrot and diakon I am used to. 

Since it was late for lunch and very early for dinner, the restaurant was quiet. We were served fairly quickly, but the server never came back to check in and we had to flag him down to get our bill.

This place was okay, but I wouldn't return. Too many other Pho places to check out."}
{"text":"My go-to pho place when downtown toronto!! The restaurant looks even 10x better than it already once did before renovations!! Food is good, and smoothies are the best here. I highly recommend pho ai my"}
{"text":"Pho is good here also the deep fried spring rolls. One of the better Vietnamese restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"So this was my first time coming here. I was told that it was under new management and had been revamped. What I enjoyed about this place was the modern feel it provided. The food and utensils also reflected this by being very clean. In terms of the menu it's a lot smaller than other places which made making my choices very simple. I got the Pho Dac Biet and it was very good. The meat to noodle to broth ratio was very good. The service was also excellent and I would recommend this place for a group of university students who would want to go out and catch up. It provided a really warm atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went out with friends and decided to try this place out spontaneously. First impression cute lighting decor. 

Service was EXTREMELY slow, egg cost extra on the rice dishes but the grilled pork and chicken were cooked nicely."}
{"text":"I got food from here through door dash. I don't recommend it. They gave me pho with no siracha or hoisin like some other places and no add ins like lime/beansprouts etc which should be basic. We also got a pork noodle dish. It came with a spring roll which had no fish sauce or dipping sauce and no fish sauce or anything for the plain white bland vermicelli. I'm not sure if it's proper but I usually eat the spring roll then use the leftover sauce over vermicelli.
Pretty disappointed. 
Bahn Mi apps were alright, very western. Mini hotdog bun with a piece of meat, piece of coldcut, veggie and some sort of siracha mayo. I really like pate mayo butter on mine and I love the flaky bread so it kinda sucked for me. 
I don't expect the best with these food courier services due to the time between completion and delivery  but I do expect an effort to maintain the service or quality up until it is picked up. Especially because these deliveries usually have extra fees and the prices are already made more expensive than in store. 
With this lack of service I don't think I will be heading to this restaurant anytime soon with so many pho less stingy places in that area."}
{"text":"My rule of thumb for pho places is, if it has somewhat nice decor, it means the food is not very good.  

That being said, Pho Ai My was actually not that bad.  I give Pho Ai My about 2.5 stars (if that were possible).  I ordered my usual Pho Chef's special, which was not too bad.  The broth was unique - it had a more vegetably taste than usual pho broths, and it tasted very homemade.  Not too heavy on the MSG.  However, the noodles had a strange chemically taste to them, and the meat, bean sprouts and basil were decidedly scant, although they were quite good.  

On the note of the decor - it looks like it was nice when it opened but for  the love of god, never pick white decor in a pho restaurant!!?!?!  There were unsightly stains all over my chair (shudder).

All in all, if it's close and you need some quick food, go.  If it's not close, don't go out of your way to come here."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. Service was okay. I ordered the number 74 and my friend the 107. The location is perfect and the place was very casual."}
{"text":"It's -20 celsius before factoring in the BS windchill. You better believe if I'm leaving my house it's for hot and spicy soup. 

I was heading for ramen at Kinton with a few pals, but they were filming in there. Oh no! So cold! What to do! We headed up Spadina thinking initially we would make it to Kensington for Jamaican, alas, the frozen cheek sting was just too much. Then we saw it: PAM. 

A PEPPER PLAY
(Frozen Toronto)
EA: It is so cold. What's that? What's PAM? 
KP: It's pho.
EA: That'll do... 

For under $8 I had the small chicken and it was hot, decent and the place was decorated nicely."}
{"text":"Saw a rat here during my experience. Unsanitary - avoid at all costs.

Food was average. Drinks were average. Poor value for money. To add again: we saw a RAT here in the dining area during our experience."}
