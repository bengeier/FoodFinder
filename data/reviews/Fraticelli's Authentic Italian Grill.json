{"text":"Came here for dinner for a friend's birthday and was extremely disappointed and would NOT recommend anyone come to this wannabe upscale restaurant.  So to start with we had 13 people and were forced to have the party menu which hardly had any selection and most likely contained items that were most easy to cook.  Apparently their policy was that any tables over 12 people MUST have a party menu even though we insisted that we wanted to use the regular menu.  Well guess what, half way through our meal there was another large table with 13 (I made sure I counted) who I guess had greater preference than us who all received the regular menu!  Next complaint was their forcefullness to upsell.  There was 1 section of the table that ordered a bottle of wine, and in my section we ordered individual drinks so I didn't want a wine bottle.  The waitress kept asking \"Are you sure you don't want a bottle of wine?\" I'm thinking in my head \"Hello we all have drinks here already\". Ask once and it's enough!  To put it even worst some of my friends were drinking tap water and everytime we would ask her to refill our water she would ask \"Do you want Sparkling Water?\".  The waitress asked my friend 4 times!! Come on 2 times might be okay but 4 times?!?  The best part of the meal was probably the antipasto appetizer which contained cold cuts, cheeses, breads, etc.  The calamari was awful and had a bad fishy taste in it.  I ordered the Chicken Garganelli and it tasted like it was burnt.  My friend who got suckered into getting the Brocollini said it was horrible and extremely salty.  He was only able to eat a few branches.  Worst of all, the waitress NEVER ONCE came back to ask how the appetizers or main course was and didn't even offer to put pepper/cheese on our food.  Okay so I thought okay nothing else bad can happen.  I'll just never come here to eat again.  But wait, there's more when our group paid the bill.  So our group was autocharged an 18% tip which is normal for groups over 6.  I was like yeah they totally don't deserve the 18% tip but whatever.  When I was adding the bill up, the HST wasn't adding up correctly.  I then figured out that they tried to charge HST on the gratuity amount.  Now WHAT RESTAURANT CHARGES HST ON GRATUITIES?? So I talked to the waitress saying that charging HST on Gratuity is absurd.  So finally she was like \"you know what.. FINE i'll just take it out of my own cash\" and slammed the counter when we were paying and gave total attitude.  Okay if the restaurant was great, I'd let it go and I wouldn't complain about the extra HST they charged but after such a poor experience I DO NOT want to give them anymore that shoudn't have been given to them."}
{"text":"Overpriced, horrible service, cold food. I will probably never return.   Came as part of a large party.   Ordered an array of food and only the lobster pizza was passable. Even though it was cold.   Steak was overcooked.  We had demonstrated that we didn't know much about wine and we discovered our waiter gave us a wine that wasn't even listed on their wine list. .  A chicken pizza came WITHOUT chicken on it.  Wine was never repoured. Water, only when asked.   FLIES! A waiter that addressed us as \"buddy\", reached over people too often to save himself from walking.   He gave us a birthday canoli, even we had brought our own cake. And he brought them out separately.   No offer of dessert, coffee or tea. And no refills of water after the tables were cleared.   Pleasantly surprised that our party was not charged a service charge.   Value: 0/5 Taste:  0-2/5 satisfaction upon leaving: 1/5"}
{"text":"Would not recommend.  Slow service Saturday night. Food was nothing special. Poor quality for the price. Mains are $20+. For my chicken fratacelli: the pasta was not al dente and the chicken was charred. We waited over an hour for the food to come. Even drinks and bread service was slow. Bottle of beer took close to 15 minutes to arrive at the table.  Spend your time and money elsewhere."}
{"text":"this was my very first time at fraticellis and I have to admit that it was beyond disappointing. My first step into the restaurant...I was impressed with the ambience and the general setting of the restaurant, lighting was nice and well furnished. However they had an extremely poor choice of music playing for a wanabe 'upscale' italian restaurant, the rock music playing was definitely not suitable for the type of food and mood they were going for...it was awkward to say the least.  Then moving onto our server who had completely forgotten about our appetizers and brought our main entrees out without offering fresh black pepper or cheese while I sat and waited for her to service other customers before I could even start on my meal. Our appetizers finally arrived nearing the end of our meal.  The food itself was also unimpressive to say the least, my boyfriends pappardelle was completely undercooked, inedible, and rock hard...while my pasta dish was sour. The manager came by and asked us for our opinion and we informed him of our disatisfaction with our dishes, he brought my boyfriends back into the kitchen only to have them bring it back 2 mins later with the plate hot because they had used the microwave to cook the underdone pasta. For a 'wanabe upscale' italian restaurant I wouldve expected for them to do better than pop a dish in the microwave and call the problem fixed.  Nonetheless we continued our meal and as the waitress was cleaning our dishes she carelessly dropped a fork onto my jacket and didn't even realize, I wasn't completely thrilled with getting pasta sauce on my $600 jacket, however she did slightly redeem herself for being smart and bringing soda water to help wipe it down. She then brought our dessert menus and we ordered...she informed us that it wud be complementary because of the mishap with our pasta dishes, though it was the least they couldve done, I do think that the pasta dish itself shouldve been complementary and not some cheap dessert. We finally got the bill and made our decision to never return to fraticellis again.  So...to sum everything up... Pros:  - well furnished - looks appealing - well priced (if the food had been better) - manager was trying to be helpful  Cons: - horrible choice in music - food was terrible - service was beyond terrible - service was slow and inefficient   Bottom line: will not return and DO NOT recommend"}
{"text":"My hubby and I went there tonight for our date night.  We were seated right away (we did make a reservation though). We ordered an app Fritto Misto. My hubby also ordered the 7oz tenderloin. I ordered the roasted mushroom risotto with no green onions. I am pregnant and I also don't want green onions because of taste not because of allergy.  Our food came. The Fritto Misto was pretty good. My husband said his tenderloin was awesome and very tender (I didn't eat any because it's cooked medium and I can't have raw meat). My risotto came with green onions and our server Meghan took it back no questions asked. She came back and apologized and said their manager will also be stopping by to talk to us.  The manager came back with my replacement risotto and again apologized. He asked me when my baby is due and he said his wife is due in 2 weeks. My risotto was pretty good and I could enjoy it freely because it had no green onions.  Later on we asked for the bill and our server said they comp'ed our appetizer because of the confusion with my risotto and again she apologized. She also congratulated us.  I would say we had the best server. Meghan was very professional and very friendly. The manager was also very friendly and they really didn't have to comp our app but we really appreciate the fact that they went out of their way to make us feel special. I would highly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We were there on March 2011 (week night) and had a horriable experience.  We ordered Sea Bass, and it tasted off, advised the server.  Server bring the dish to the Chef and came back reporting Chef tasted the dish and there's nothing wrong with it.  We insisted we want to order something else.  The server offered bad service from this point on, ignoring us etc...That night wasn't even busy!!  At the end we go the bill, and they charge us Sea Bass that we didn't even eat, we asked to remove that from the bill and te server gave us a look and adjusted it....Worst customer expereience EVER!"}
{"text":"I'm very surprised with a lot of negative reviews here. It doesn't seem like a good setting for a large group of people. That may be the issue. But it's a great place for a date or in a small group of no more than 4 people.   The setting was romantic. Bit like Moxie's or Keg but better. The server was very good too. Complimentary bread they give as an appetizer was nice and warm and tasted good.    I ordered the Risotto and it tasted really good. Very cheesy. You can always ask the server to add extra cheese on it and they will bring a block of cheese and scrape it in front of you.   Of course the things were bit on the pricy side. But then again you pay for the setting and the service. Not somewhere I would go everyday for lunch so thought the prices were fair compared to other restaurants that are similar."}
{"text":"I went with a girlfriend and we ordered drinks and some crab balls which were really good! We also ordered a pizza with black olives, chicken, spinach and cheese. The pizza dough was a little dry and floury and there was not very much cheese or chickenon the pizza. All round the experience was pretty good, i would go back."}
{"text":"Went for dinner last night and the entire group was very impressed. The meal starts with complementary bread and dipping sauce...absolutely incredible. I could've just had that for dinner. For appetizers we got the specials they were offering- one was crab cakes, which were crumbly, tasteless, and over-all mediocre. The other was toasted bread slices, goat cheese, and cranberry relish. Basic, simple, but very, very good. For the entree I got the spaghetti del pescatore. Nice sauce, generous amounts of mussles and calamari (although only 3 shrimp), and the pasta itself was cooked perfectly. The only other entree I tried was my younger sister's spaghetti and meatballs ordered off the kid's menu- this, surprisingly, was also quite good...had a real 'homemade' taste to it. For desert I ordered a chocolate amaretto creme brulee. This was truly a masterpiece, one of the best deserts I've had. Thin, crispy top layer, and creamy rich wonderfully flavoured custard. Service was great as well. Friendly, courteous, and prompt. I easily go through 5 or more drinks through a meal and this is one of the few places where I never found myself waiting for a refill."}
{"text":"Been here several times now, and I find the food is just so-so...nothing amazing. Not very \"authentic\" either. But there's not that much else around the area. The interior is pretty nice!"}
{"text":"I came here in a group of five people for dinner over the weekend. It was noticeably empty for a weekend and I found out why over the course of the meal.   The atmosphere is nice and looks upscale. A live band started playing later into the night. The service was fine. But the food was so unmemorable that I struggle to remember what I even had when I went. My main dish was the atlantic salmon with asparagus. The salmon was terrible and tasted like it was marinated in a household cleaning solution. Extremely disappointing and hands down one of the worst things I have ever eaten in a restaurant.   For dessert, I had the flourless chocolate hazelnut cake, which was nice and lighter than your average flourless cakes but nothing to write home about. It comes with a berry compote that cuts the sweetness of the cake. This was a nice touch to the dessert.   Overall, my experience here was mediocre and unmemorable. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. You can get better authentic Italian food at nicer restaurants for a better price. And for the same price, you can probably get better steaks at the restaurant complexes a few blocks down. To be avoided."}
{"text":"Wow... I'm really surprised at all the mediocre reviews here. Maybe the experience is different with large parties or when they first opened up? I've been here several times now and have been satisfied every time. The food looks good and the waitresses look even better!  The best part is that the food is really good here too! I've tried almost all of their apps and have not been disappointed. Try out their arugala pizza!"}
{"text":"Im surprised to see low ratings for this place. I have been here a few times, and its always been excellent. I usually get the sambuca shrimp; its always tasty. The atmosphere is nice too, but its not exactly family friendly.   I saw Chef Massimo here once too."}
{"text":"Visits 5+  After numerious visits I will write a review. Even though many people base their experiences on the first visit, which is understandable. No business runs perfect. There's always ups and downs.  I've dined in both the dining room and the bar. If you want to have a quiet dining, I defeinitely recommend the dining room. If you're heading out for a meal and drinks with a 1 or 2 friends the bar is the way to go.  Food and Atmosphere is great. I definietly like how they have a temperature controled room for the red wine. Water is automatically served with a slice of lemon.  recommendations: Appetizers: Fritto Misto, Crab Arancini, Fonduta Fraticelli  Mains: Butternut Squah Ravioli. Roasted Mushroom Risotto, Arugula & Prociutto pizza, Lobster Pancetto Pizza  Never had a chance to order dessert yet, so no recommendations.  Wine: paired perfectly with the above choices, Chianti Classico 2008  Only reasion why the score is a 4/5, is because, 1. There was no one to greet us at the door when we arrived, 2. The investors/owners were having a meeting at the bar, they were blocking the walk way to the seating area, even though they heard me say \"excuse me\" they stood there and didn't move out of the way. That's a BIG nono as an investor/owner of a restaurant.  Enjoy everyone.  Till next time"}
{"text":"It's shrimp app is probably one of the best I have ever had. All the rest that we tried were simply average. Nice decor and awesome staff though."}
{"text":"Food was excellent but waitress made mistakes and ignored us"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I have been here quite a few times - when we wanna do something nice but are too lazy to do something super nice downtown.  We always ALWAYS get the short ribs (without the sage, do not like). It's so so good. The meat falls off the bone and it's so yummy. The mash potatoes...ugh no words.   Then there's the parmigiana (chicken) that we get too, along with a salad. They also serve this bread that has herbs on top that you dip in oil and I just...I get full off that bread.  The only thing is that they've made little mistakes with our meal here and there for which they've amended by offering a dessert on the house or a coupon for a free appetizer for our next visit (Maybe that's why we've been so many times). One time our pasta was cold to the touch. Another time the mash potatoes that comes with the short tasted so off I couldn't eat it (too much blue cheese mixed in...don't be turned off I don't like blue cheese either but I love the mash potatoes!)  I've ordered soft drinks and just water. I've had a amaretto sour.   We've had the cheesecake and they used to have a vanilla gelato drowned in espresso on their menu but they took it off. I ask for it though and they make it for me, so you can still try it.  Go try it!"}
{"text":"Came today for my 16th birthday and I absolutely loved it. The ambience was very nice and chill, definitely the perfect setting. I enjoyed every part of my experience here--from the service, which was excellent, to the food, which was incredible. The hostess and waiter were both so friendly and patient, and I was extremely satisfied with the food!"}
{"text":"This was the first time I came to this new restaurant.  I was surprised that the restaurant was so packed and festive during the night (Saturday). The deco was amazing and beautiful.  The atmosphere was casual to dressy, perfect for the fancier night out with the family or a group of old time friends.  For appetizers, I ordered the Fonduta, a five cheese dip with bread.  This included fresh pieces pita pieces, garlic bread pieces, and a fried dough which was kind of like a thick french fry.  I liked the cheese dip which wasn't too thick nor salty.  The appetizer was big enough to satisfied the 4 of us.  I tried the recommended Arugula and Proscruitto (pronounced PRO-SHOOT-TO) pizza. I found the Arugula weird at first, to be having raw leaves on top of the pizza (salad on pizza?). But it did go well with the ham, and I became quite accustomed to the combination by the end.  The pizza was a flatbread and very little oil, which makes it also a healthy choice.  So overall, I liked the food. Our waitress was also very friendly.  We had a great time.  Here's a little tidbit, this restaurant is managed by Massimo Capra, from TV's Restaurant Makeover."}
{"text":"Very good food and friendly staff! We ordered  and  fettuccine alferedo and chicken parmigiana with salad, nicely cooked with lots of spices and herbs. Cheese balls were fresh and crunchy. We'll go back again!"}
{"text":"Great Italian food. Loved their Lobster Pizza. Nice elegant restaurant. Great for luncheon meetings for business and pleasure..."}
{"text":"We went here with friends for dinner. Service was awful- he couldn't even remember we wanted water with no ice. Food was mediocre at best. Ingredients didn't seem to be of high quality. I would not go back!"}
{"text":"This is our third visit to Fraticelli's, and we had a great time.  This is our early New Year's Eve dinner. The place is busy but not hectic. The ambiance is just right to make you feel comfortable. The food tastes good. Three of us had steak. Sirloin and New York strip. And we all liked our steak. For dessert one of us had the molten lava cake, with ice cream on top. It was delicious. The amaretto in it heightens the softness and sweetness of the cake, while the ice cream brings it down just a bit to strike the perfect balance. Service is prompt and friendly. Our waitress is pleasant and helpful. Overall we had a great meal and great time. I think we have a new favorite restaurant for family and friends gathering.  The only drawback to me is that there is not enough pasta selections.  But then again they do call themselves a Grill restaurant."}
{"text":"Excellent up-scale Italian food.  Not what Mama used to make, but very tasty, well presented, and very satisfying."}
{"text":"We went tonight to celebrate my daughter's birthday, at her request.  The bruschetta was burnt--Black charcoal on the edges.  The pizza was so undercooked that is was almost like raw dough. My kids didn't eat any of it and said they didn't want it sent back because it left such a bad taste.  The other dishes we ordered were mediocre tasting at best.  It was an expensive disappointment."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant a few nights ago with a group of six.  We tried it out because Massimo Capra is a familiar personality from cooking segments on various television shows and we liked his penchant for fresh ingredients and his flair in the kitchen.   The decor of the restaurant is beautiful, harmonious and modern.  It has a very chic, expensive feel.    The service was very slow.  We waited almost 15 minutes for menus, and another 15 minutes for drinks (of which our server forgot half).  She was quite young and not very knowledgeable about the menu or the wine list.  She was pleasant although she seemed to be overwhelmed by the number of tables assigned to her.  The food was unremarkable for the most part.  The second star here is for the crab arancini - fried crab and risotto balls.  Fresh crab, cheesy, not greasy, with a tasty tomato garlic aioli dip.    The Chicken Marsala was 'unremarkable', but the gorgonzola mashed potatoes were smooth and savoury.  Others in my party ordered the Chicken Garganelli which was described as 'Bland' as black pepper and salt were liberally applied.  Higher praise was awarded to the Roasted Chicken Rotolo, which was described as 'pretty good', but rich.  Probably won't go back for dinner, just for drinks and crab arancini at the bar!  aside: About the website....PDF menus are not friendly!"}
{"text":"sounds like a typical chain restaurant along the lines of canyon creek, etc. but boasts a 100% italian menu. the LOBSTER PANCETTA PIZZA with tomato cream sauce comes on an ultra thin, really delicious crust - balances crisp and chewy nicely. THere is only just enough sauce to prevent the pizza from being dry; lobster pieces are few and far between, tiny when you do come across 'em. Crust is salted, a little bit too much so, but a little salt did make eating pizza bones enjoyable.  appetizers all sounded pretty tasty; settled on the FONDUTA FRATICELLI -- a 5-cheese dip with pita, bread, and polenta cakes. This most definitely is one of those all-beige-meals-that-is-pretty-tasty-but-you-know-you-shouldn't-be-eating. Polenta cakes were fried fingers of polenta and really satisfying on their own. bread was fresh. dip best enjoyed warm -- i.e. before it cools and congeals. Garnished on top were wo cherry tomatoes to trick you into thinking that the dish is remotely healthy.  more free bread on the side rounded out our carbo-loading adventure. it's so flipping hard to turn down fresh bread. so. hard."}
{"text":"Went back for dinner and was sad my delicious sandwich was a lunch-only item :(  Dinner is much more expensive but I went with my in-laws so no $ out of my pocket and yes, very busy considering its about $30 pp so I didn't receive the same excellent service. With my husband I wouldn't go back due to the cost + lack of service but if someone else is paying, SURE! ;)   I would recommend the butternut squash ravioli which was delicious and the spumoni ice cream. It's a clown-coloured slice of ice cream that is super fruity, very kid like but apparently is a traditional Italian dessert."}
{"text":"Fraticelli's nicely decorated and the atmosphere felt very high class.  I love the booth seat they gave us as it gave you a sense of privacy.  Started with the appetizer - Fritto Misto.  The Calamari was over cooked but the shrimp was very tasty but too bad there was only 2 of them.  I had the 14 oz rib eye steak and it was very well cooked to my liking - medium rare.  Also had the flourless chocolate cake which tasted the ferrero rocher was amazing.  The service was very good as the server checked on us many times and was very patience with us.  Even giving us recommendations and describing each dish to us.  Overall, the food quality is pretty fresh and providing a relax dining experience.  Rating:  Service: 4/5 Food Quality: 4/5 Comfort 4/5 Decor  4/5 Value: 3/5 Parking: 5/5"}
{"text":"Food is good, atmosphere is loud and busy which is good for a party or larger group gathering.  The restaurant is nicely decorated.  Staff is friendly and service is good.    I have visited Fraticelli's several times, I tend to order the spaggetti del pescatore dish.  Fresh spaghetti, mussels, calamari, and tiger shrimp all tossed in a spicy tomato white wine sauce.... $19.50."}
{"text":"The reviews for this restaurant are all over the place!  Our friends had a coupon and said we should try it, so we did.   Things started off kind of shaky when the hostess said our table was ready.  But it wasn't, according to the gentleman at the front.  He walked us in, saw it was set for 7 (we had a party of 5), and had us wait in the dining area.  Awkward.  He came back only to tell us that it was, indeed, our table.    We ordered:    Grilled calamari Pappardelle Short ribs Ribeye steak Duck Special  Every dish was much better than I originally expected, especially after reading not-so-great reviews.  I was pleasantly surprised by the portion sizes and the quality of food.    The fresh baked bread was nice and warm.  They give complimentary refills on pop!    Service by our actual server was very good in the beginning, but definitely went downhill as the evening went on.  We waited quite awhile for our bill to be picked up and processed.  I think he just got really busy and had to attend to several tables at the same time.    The next awkward moment was when a different server came to ask us if everything was alright (as we were about to leave through the front doors) because we didn't leave a tip.  Since we used a particular coupon, it stated gratuity would be included in the final amount, and it was 18%.  We had to point out the gratuity amount on the bill was charged already and then we left.  This might've rubbed some people the wrong way.    Overall, the experience wasn't bad, but it wasn't \"whoah, amazing!\" either.  3 stars!"}
{"text":"Meh. Nice place and the waitress was very pleasant. No reservations so we sat at the bar.  Bruschetta appetizer was very good , flavourful and presented nicely.  My wife was deciding between a chicken picatta and pizza. Waitress recommended the Picatta- a house specialty! Not impressed at all. Less than mediocre. Could barely taste the lemon and was very bland. The green pasta that came with it didnt have any sauce. My wife's homemade Picatta is way better and we're not even Italian!!!  I had the beef short rib. It was tender and pretty good but nothing special.  The manager was very nice and came by and spoke with us. The decor and staff were great but the food just wasn't up to par. Too many other Italian restaurants in the GTA to settle on this place. They need a new chef. Everything else is there, just not the food."}
{"text":"Consistently: Great service and food right from the reception at the front door to our table, server(s), (especially Sydney), delicious food and our exit.   We shall return!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't done a review for this place yet! Been here numerous times, and gotta say that I enjoyed it every time!  Decided to come here again after a long while, and had a really good meal! First off, the interior design and decor was beautiful. With a modern twist on a classic design, it gave a sense of a true Italian restaurant with modern lighting! There was jazz music playing in the background as well, which is always a plus in my books. Everybody loves some Franky!  One of the amazing things about Fraticelli's is that they have an amazing featured menu. It changes every once in a while, but offers different dishes you don't get to try often. Once I had a mahi mahi that was magical, and last night they had a swordfish (which I didn't order due to the price). The items are typically more expensive, but if you go for it, you definitely won't be disappointed.   We decided to go for an Arugula Salad, the Penne alla Vodka, and the Meatballs al Forno to start. The meatballs are homemade, which is always a nice touch, and came with 4 little meatballs in a tomato sauce. The meat itself had a strong herb taste and a little on the tougher side, but paired very well with the tomato sauce and cheese on top! The Arugula Salad my friend got was very generous, with a lot in the bowl, especially the cheese and chickpeas. My friend chose to add in salmon, and it was cooked nicely to a medium. The Penne alla Vodka was really good, with bacon and onion cooked in with a creamier sauce, it was done very well.  For dessert, we shared a Chocolate Tartufo, which was really good as well. A nice decadent chocolate covered in cocoa powder made a nice contrast between the sweet and bitter.   The service was very good though, with attentive and informative servers, they really understood their menu and was able to give some nice advice and recommendations.   Would definitely consider coming her a little more in the future, as it has been a while!"}
{"text":"I been coming here since it opened. It was actually pretty good but the last time I went in Dec, this place has gone way down hill. The service here has always been fine but the food has gone way down hill. The taste and quality of the food has gone way down.  The lounge is great for drinks just pass on the food."}
{"text":"Completely garbage in terms of their grilled meat items,  texture and wellness of meat subpar at best.  Seasoning was overly salty. Waiting staff inexperinced; incapable of not spilling wine while performing bottle service. Lack of efficiency and attentiveness to dirty utensils requiring replacement. Will not return.  Will definetely recommend others to stay away."}
{"text":"Had gone here for dinner last night with a couple of friends and we all had had a really bad experience, especially for the amount of money we spent. Here's why:  1. The meals are overpriced. I ordered the top sirloin which came with 3 small bites of grilled zucchini and 4 small potatoes. Paid $30+taxes. The steak wasn't that great.  2. Menu selection sucks. There wasn't much to eat at all and nothing seemed appetizing. I was there with 4 friends and as we were reading the menu, we were wondering why we even decided the restaurant, considering there wasn't much selection.  3. We ordered one drink, the bellini, and it wasn't that great. Had better bellini's at Moxies. For some reason, it was also watered down.  4. Later, we decided to have a latte each, so we ordered 4. The latte's were freezing. They were literally ice cold. We sent them back, because, at $5 each, we should be able to sit and enjoy a warm latte. The latte's came back 35 minutes later. Still cold.  5. Portions. We all complained about the portions because they were very small for the price they were. The resto is very overpriced.   Overall, if you're wanting a nice italian resto, this isn't it. Choose to spend your money wisely and go somewhere where you're actually going to enjoy the food. I had: a steak, a bellini and a lattee and I ended up paying $55 plus tip for just myself. Kind of a rip off."}
{"text":"We've avoided Fraticelli's in the past as it seems like a mediocre chain run restaurant with middling reviews. However we've eaten here twice in the last year and the food is pretty good. We ended up here on a recent Saturday as a last resort after starting at the Keg near Hwy 7 and taking a pass after seeing dozens of people waiting in line for tables. Fraticelli's was only at half capacity so we were expecting an average meal but the service was  good and everyone was satisfied with their meals. We noticed that the menu has been changed so hopefully the food is better. We ordered vegetarian risotto and the short rib dinner.  I would return because the risotto was so good! give it a try as there is a dearth of Italian restaurants in this area."}
{"text":"I asked for lots of fresh grated Parmesan cheese on my Spaghetti Carbonara; I love cheese!  I really liked the texture of the stringy hand made spaghetti.  It was like comfort food and very al dente!  I also liked the double smoked bacon slices within the spaghetti.  I wish there were more egg and caramelized onions in the dish though and even more cheese would have made the dish come together more in terms of flavour.  When comparing this pasta dish to the one that we all had here on our first visit (a creamy fettuccine seafood dish that was on special that night), this one pales in comparison.  Nevertheless, I still really enjoyed the quality of the pasta here! :)"}
{"text":"Great service, very friendly waitress.   The music was a bit too loud for my liking.   I received a $20 off of $40 coupon. My friend and I shared a Caesar salad to start. It was good. We both got the pappardelle alla bolognese. The egg noodles were good, a little bit chewy for my liking. The sauce was pretty good.   Overall a pretty good meal. I'm glad I had the coupon though because I feel as though the items are pricier than they should be."}
{"text":"I went for lunch and the next day for dinner. The food is average over all. But when the bruscetta arrived very very salty, and nothing was done about it, I was disappointed. Customers need to be satisfied to compete. The pizza was thin crusted and flavourful. The lasagna was average. Would I go out of my way to go back again, no."}
{"text":"If it wasn't for the service, it might have gotten a 3, but let us discuss.   The atmosphere in here is nice. I would recommend coming here if you're making an evening out of it. It's a great place to lounge, drink, chat with your friends and not feel rushed or need to go.  The high ceilings and oak tables give it a higher class feel, without the price points.   But, the service here was lacking for sure. We sat at 7:45 and we didn't not get served food until 9:15pm (just uploaded my photos which I took as the plate arrived to our table - 9:13pm and 9:21 pm for mine). I understand that we are a big group, and the foods were all meant to come at the same time - but maybe then you need a bigger kitchen or more staff. I bet we werent the only ones complaining that night.  The servers were super friendly, cracking jokes with us, helping us take photos. Our main server did put our large party into smaller separate bills when requested.   The food.  It was okay. A bit mediocre. I've definitely had better italian food than this.  I had the Four Cheese Gnocchi in brown butter sauce. I expected pan fried and slightly burnt (i.e. crunchy) gnocchi smothered in a four cheese sauce. However, when arrived, the gnocchi was to the side and sauted in butter briefly, and it was just melted cheese on the other side of the plate. and topped with raw chopped tomatoes. It was a weird combination, very oily and not anything to call home about. I put a lot of pepper on this to make it taste decent.   The girls also had Butternut Squash Ravoli (\"the worst i've ever tasted\", \"too sweet\"), Spaghetti Carbonara (\"hardly any taste\" \"i've had better), Eggplant with bowtie pasta (\"i can make better eggplant at home\" \"pasta too oily), Bowtie Pasta with pesto (i had some of this and it didn't taste like anything).   Also, some pastas were definitely prepared in advanced, then place in the oven for warmth and the pasta became hard and not tasty.   I don't even know how the bill taking went down, as I had to go and left cash for them to deal with. it was already 9:45pm!  Like I said, come here and lounge with a whole night ahead of you and you might enjoy yourself here."}
{"text":"Good food, ambiance.. Liked their seafood chowder.. Had good amount of salmon morsels.. They also had pulled lamb on a bun with a fried egg sunny side up on the top... Very delicious..."}
{"text":"The grilled salmon was divine. Its made over a wood fire and the difference was noticeable. I have the house wine (white). It was nice but i am no wine snob. For desert i had the Tartufo gelato."}
{"text":"Received a gift card in the mail from Fraticelli's for $25 off my meal if I spent more than $50 (so essential 50% off, or less depending on what you order). So I decided to give this place a try with my boyfriend. We went in on a Friday night. Decently busy. We sat in a booth in the bar area. Our waiter was very friendly, very helpful and very considerate.  However, I wasn't that impressed with the food. The card in the mail came in a little card that promoted their lobster specials. There's also a huge banner outside their restaurant and a separate menu encouraging you to try their lobster. I'm guessing it's the same reason why McDonald's has their McLobster right now (cheap, good, fresh lobster available in the market at the moment). So I tried their lobster bisque ($8.25?). It was really tasty and smooth BUT I would have preferred some lobster chunks in there. The whole thing was just like a puree. The soup was the best part of my meal unfortunately.  THEN we waited 45 minutes to an hour after we finished our appetizer to get our entree. That is pretty unacceptable. Our server could tell that we were getting antsy and checked on the kitchen for us without us having to ask, which was great. He assured us it would be ready shortly. My entree was the lobster pancetta/pizza ($17.25?). One hour for a pizza. It was thin crust, had a nice sauce BUT there were only 4 small chunks of lobster on my pizza. Really? 4??! When lobster is in season? Where did the rest of my lobster go??? That's pretty stingy to say the least for a $17 pizza. If I go back, which I likely wont, I would just get the lobster tail for $24. That way they can't gip me of my lobster.  Overall:  Service: 5/5 Food: 3/5 (good, but not worth it for the price you pay)"}
{"text":"First time here and it was a good experience. Our waitress was knowledgable on the menu and very nice to us. I ordered a spicy penne pasta with grilled chicken. It was served piping hot which I love!  I expected more pasta options. I didn't see any with seafood, but maybe I missed it on the menu. They had steaks and risotto. A fish dish was the special and a lasagna.  The restaurant had lots of booths which I really liked too."}
{"text":"This is in the same chain of restaurants as Turtle Jacks nearby. However, it is much more upscale and fancy, looks very nice and is a pretty good dinner date location. Service was attentive.  The food was good on both my visits. Desserts were delish too. Not sure about the authentic-ness of the Italian food served, but I do know it was yummy.  Unless it was outstanding, I usually wouldnt give chain restaurants 5 stars. Would come back when craving italian nearby and wanting a fancier atmosphere for special-er occasions."}
{"text":"Very good food. Although I asked for a medium rare steak and it came through as a medium. Still an outstanding meal. Would have been 5 stars if not for the steak prep. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Had dinner there with my nieces and little brother. Service was good, food was interesting. Price was a little on the high side, dinner for 4, appetizer and 2 drinks was $140 before tip. Had the ribeye which was tasty, but not quite $36 tasty."}
{"text":"Decided to come here for dinner with my friend. The atmosphere is always great and food has decent portion. I ordered the Pappadelle Alla Bolognese and I love how the noodles were cooked to perfect al dente. Sauce was just right in flavour. Our server always checked on us to make sure our needs are met. Oh, must try the tartufo for dessert!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here and let me say their impeccable service really left a great impression. First of all, my boyfriend and I had a $15 off coupon that was sent in the mail which prompted us to give this place a try in the first place. Unfortunately, it was expired. The owner came out to personally greet us, ask us if it was our first time there, and generously gave us the discount anyway. What a great start to the meal. We then proceeded to order.   To start, we got the cheese fondue. Wow, this plate is literally a plate of carbs. Garlic bread, flat bread, and thick cut fries served with a warm bowl of different white cheeses. It was extremely filling but delicious. Then came the entrees, a lobster pizza and an aragula salad with salmon. Both were really good. The lobster on the pizza was so flavourful. The only thing I was not a fan of was the wait time in between the courses. It was really really slow. Hopefully, that was an anomaly. Also they were very courteous about it, having a server come out and personally apologize for the wait, so that made up for it.   We didn't even try for dessert, we were stuffed, but we did share an alcoholic pear cider which was refreshing and big enough to share.   I loved this place. Decor was very nice; casual enough to be relaxing but elegant enough to make it special."}
{"text":"My wife and I walked in and they said they were full and ask us to go to the lounge side. We went there and nobody served us. Server was talking on their own so one server walk by and i waved at her. I said excuse me and waved her at the same time and she walked right by me. Are you Serious??? We got up and left this suppose to be a upper class restaurant. Management should realize this!!!"}
{"text":"I'm giving my most recent experience here a two star.  I would have given zero if it weren't for the excellent customer service.  However, when the food is lacklustre and you are charging premium prices no wonder the restaurant was not busy.    The server was awesome and attentive her name was PJ she made sure we were well taken care of.  We started off with some bread that was nice and fresh along with olive oil dip.  We ordered the kid's spaghetti and meatball, penne arrabiatta, and a egg noodle special pasta.    When the kid's spaghetti came it you could tell the noodles were overlooked and just stuck all together and there were two meatballs on top.  My daughter only ate the meatballs and the rest of the pasta was left enough said.  The penne arrabiatta was ok in that it was spicy and had chicken, but the sauce itself was very thick and sticky.  It was very pasty if I had to describe it.  Lastly, my dish came and there was egg noodles, mussels, Italian sausage and broccoli in a saffron sauce.  The eggs noodles again weren't cooked right and the \"fresh\" egg noodles were stuck together and the sauce was subpar.  The mussels were good but the sausage was so so and I tasted some grit in the pasta probably from the mussel.    Bottom line: save your money and go some where less expensive.  For an upscale Italian restaurant it definitely needs to re vamp it's quality.  Customer service they have down pat, but without the matching food to deliver on the experience it falls short."}
{"text":"I have been here several times but today was a disappointment.  The apps were very good however we had to send the mains back. The pappardelle bolognese were terribly undercooked, we could stand the noodles on its end.  Also the veal parmigianno's taste was also off, slightly stale breading."}
{"text":"Food is subpar for the price in my opinion.  Atmosphere is so so and service was acceptable.  The restaurant was so hot when I went that our table was very uncomfortable.  The waitress spoke so slow that it ws a bit annoying.  Very typical chain restaurant but quality of the food for price ... questionable."}
{"text":"I am very surprised to see many bad reviews for this restaurants.  I came here twice so far within the last 6 months and both time I had a wonderful good time at Fraticelli's.  The server that was serving us did say they had new management around more than half a year ago, so maybe the foods are a lot better than previously.  The decoration in this restaurant is nice, although I have to say it was a little dim, but it didn't bother me that much.  My most recent visit is when they were having a special lobster menu and they were very appealing.  For a dinner for three, we ordered the following items:  Calamari Alla Griglia - appetizer Lobster Bisque - appetizer (soup) Caesar Salad - appetizer Americana Pizza - Main (Pizza) Chicken Alfredo Fettuccine - Main (Pasta) Pappardelle Alla Bolongnese - Main (Pasta)  That is quite a lot of food for 3 people! Out of all the food above, I was most impressed with the Grilled Calamari (Calamari Alla Griglia), Lobster Bisque and the Bolongnese.  The salad is average, but the pizza, I thought it was very dry and I prefer the Pizza Hut style pizzas!  The calamari was displayed very nicely and with the sour sauce on top, it created a good chemistry. The Lobster BIsque had very strong lobster flavour which was fantastic for a lobster bisque lover like me. The Bolongnese sauce was great, the server did recommend us to add Meatballs on top and I did, but I thought the meatballs were not that good and if I can redo this, I would prefer eating the pasta by itself.  The texture of the pasta was normal, definitely not as al-dente as the bigger name Italian restaurants in downtown such as Terroni (I wrote a review for Terroni too!)  To end the night, we wrapped up with a Latte.  The latte was great, but I was hoping a little bit of latte art on top.   Overall, I would give this play a 4 for offering solid environment, appetizers and pastas!"}
{"text":"My dad and I popped in here to grab a bite to eat! Sadly we were very disappointed with not the service but the quality of food. My dads veal sandwich was over cooked the bread ding of the veal being burnt as well as the bun being very dry. My dad has had his share of authentic Italian veal sandwiches and he didn't even finish his because he couldn't eat it.   The server was very nice and checked on us regularly. Although when we brought to her attention the overlooked veal and even showed it to her on the plate she simply apologized and said she would bring it to the kitchens attention. We would have appreciated it if she had spoken to a manager perhaps and made some sort of small adjustment to our bill, but this was not done. That was also a little disappointing. None the less we paid our full bill and went on our way.   I should mention this was lunch. This is not to say that perhaps their dinner kitchen staff is more competent. My review is simply for the lunch experience we had."}
{"text":"Though the reviews for this place can cause a detterence, I'm sure everyone has their reasons.  Both Iriana and I came here Friday night after the Markham Jazz fest to lightly indulge ourselves in some Italian food.   Firstly you can't help but gaze at the wall of wines from floor to ceiling.  The decor is very contemporary, chic, high ceilings and beautiful chandeliers.   Our server, and the service was approximately a 4/5  The food..aka the WORKS!  We shared their   Fritto Misto; fried calamari, fennel, shrimp, and zuchinnis, this dish was an overal 3.5/5.  I found that there was a lot of batter on it, but nonetheless there was flavor in this dish.    Mains we had their Fiorentina pizza which came with a shareable caesar salad.  We both came to an agreement the pizza was good, but not overly impressive, as the distribution of ingredients on the pizza was off. The salad was good, just wished they put more cheese...again its a personal thing. Overall rating for this dish was approximately 3/5  For drinks I had their chianti classico :) nom nom.... Would I come back, yes to try something different..........."}
{"text":"Never been here before and decided to go for a drink at the bar on a Thursday night. Pretty happening spot with great live music.   On Thursday there were some bar discounts available.   Will be coming again.  Servers were awesome too!"}
{"text":"We had received a $20 coupon in the mail so my family decided to try it for my parent's wedding anniversary. The decor looked like your typical chain restaurant, spacious seating with dim lighting. It restaurant focuses on a full italian menu and had a good selection.   The meal started off with bread and olive oil. The bread was seasoned with spices and very flavourful, but was a tad salty. It was hot and soft, like it was fresh from the oven.   We had ordered the Crab Arancini and the Antipasto board as our appetizers. The crab arancini are like fried risotto balls and it came out piping hot! It was crispy on the outside, and creamy on the inside. It was a perfect combination of textures. It came with a tomato pomodoro sauce and an aioli dip, which only added to the flavours of the dish. It was my favourite part of the meal. The antipasto board came with meats, cheeses, olives, grilled veggies and pieces of crostini bread. It had good variety and great to share.   For our entrees, we ordered the special for the night, which was lasagne along with the mushroom risotto. The lasagne was a sizeable portion and each layer was filled with cheesy goodness. The tomato sauce was a good balance to the richness of the dish. The risotto, despite the poor presentation was very tasty. It was a tad undercooked in my opinion, but the flavour was good.  Lastly, the server was very nice and had given a free ice-cream dessert to celebrate my parent's wedding anniversary. It was a very nice gesture by the restaurant. We had ordered everything to share, since we are not big eaters and the server was very accommodating.   Despite being a little pricey, I would definitely come back again to try the pizzas and the fonduta fratcelli (cheese fondue)."}
{"text":"Last night I took my wife and daughter to Fraticelli's.. I have to say I was very impressed with the food and the service . Everything was amazing and its nice to see a manager/owner walking around making sure everyone is enjoying the food . We will definitely be back ."}
{"text":"I go to this place very often and its literally my go to. The service is always great. I come here at least once a month. Literally the place my family goes to and last minute date plans with my boyfriend.   For the starters I recommend the sliders, the mussels (my ultimate favourite.. The sauce is HELLA good), calamari fritti and the fondue. My go to is always the chicken Parmesan, the pastas are also pretty good but not all, well not every pasta is everyone's cup of tea. My aunts favourite is there gourmet pizza, especially the one with arugula on top. Every time we go to a different restaurant she always tries to see if they would have it on the menu.   I'm giving this a 5 star because they have a good selection of food, great service with the servers always smiling, and the place looks great. It may be a little on the pricey side but it's worth it trust me."}
{"text":"Though I've only been here once, I still wanted to write a review while my (good) experience is fresh on my mind.  This place opened almost 2 years ago, and from reading some of the negative reviews around service and food quality, I was very apprehensive about going....but...I had to see for myself!    Up until now, I've only frequented the \"more casual/less expensive\" Turtle Jacks next door, which coincidentally is physically attached to Fraticelli's and from what I heard, is owned by the same people.    First off...I adhered to the many recommendations of NOT going on a busy weekend, and NOT going in a large group, because it seems most of the \"complaints\" are in large group settings on the busiest day of the week...Saturday.  So...I chose a Friday lunch, and only went with my significant other.    We got there right at 11:30 to beat the rush, and 2 of the cooks were just walking in (you could tell, because they were wearing all black).  They each held the door open for us so we walked straight through the double sets of doors.  That felt nice...but it was the hostess that really made our initial impression a very positive one.  She put on a huge smile (braces and all) and looked us both in the eyes and welcomed us.  She then explained the 3 different seating areas and asked which we preferred (her braces made her enunciation a bit entertaining, but she was trying really hard to speak clearly so we couldn't fault her for that!).  We chose the dining room.  As we were being guided in, she gave us an option of a booth or traditional table, and then asked if it was our first time (which it was).  At the table, she welcomed us again, told us the name of our server, and with another big smile was off back to her station.  And yes....she was rather attractive, but it was the positive demeanor and the way she made us feel welcome that we appreciated.  Let's face it...looks only go so far, because there are many attractive people out there...but if the attitude stinks, they're still unattractive! So yes, she was very attractive!  Our waitress came within a couple of minutes.  Yes, she was attractive too, but a bit older (35?), and very professional, not wearing anything skanky, and definitely not doing this job as a summer job.  She welcomed us and knew it was our first time already (the hostess must have told her).  She explained all the specials, and knew all the main ingredients of each.  No summer-student bimbo here...another plus!  We ordered a beer and pop for drinks.  When she returned, she gave us a free sample appetizer as a welcome to the restaurant!  She explained the 10+ different items in the sampler (which is a scaled down sampling of their appetizers), and took our food order.  We had the Calabrese Pizza and the Vegetable Panini.  Both were excellent.  The pizza was slightly spicy with lots of provolone and gorgonzola cheese....just wonderful!  I would recommend asking for it to be well-done if you like a crispy crust though, because with all that cheese and toppings, the pizza sags a bit due to the weight.  Regardless, it was very good, and quite filling. The vegetable panini came with parmigiano truffle shoe string fries - Excellent!  I've never had that before, and the parmesean cheese really added that extra taste.  As for the service...our server definitely knew her stuff.  She would walk by without disturbing us, but would glance over at our dishes, and then take a quick glance at myself and my date to see if there was anything we wanted, but not interupting us.  When we needed something...a quick eye contact was all that was needed to get her attention, and we were once again welcomed with a smile.  Her attentiveness, but unobtrusiveness made our lunch very private, while still being constantly \"served\" when needed.  Our lunch came to $50 with tax and tip, so this is not a cheap place, and probably not a \"regular daily\" lunch spot.  But if you're celebrating something with that special someone, I would recommend this place.  Some \"yelpers\" compare this to Moxies and Milestones, but I think it's a notch above, and not in the same league as those chains.  The Turtle Jacks next door is more on the level of Moxies and Milestones, but not Fraticelli's!  On leaving, we were greeted with another big smile from the same hostess....braces and all...  :-)  P.S.  The only reason this is a 4-star and not a 5-star rating is because I've only been here once.  A 5-star rating should be earned with consistency (food and service), so now I have an excuse to return many more times ;-)"}
{"text":"This was my first visit, the restaurant was very aesthetically pleasing and the waitresses were very attentive; however, the food was basic and lacked flavour. I ordered a the Roasted Mushroom Risotto  with a side of meatballs. The risotto was still hard and flavourless. The meatballs were tender, but the sauce was salty and tart. I aslo ordered the Goat Cheese Bruschetta and the tomatoes lacked seasoning. Overall, the food was disappointing and I wouldn't return to this resturant!"}
{"text":"I cannot put into words how bad of an experience I had at this restaurant.  Terrible terrible terrible service. Food is okay, but over-priced and nothing you can't get at Milestones.  Please don't go."}
{"text":"I went with my husband Jan 27 and the server Chandler was very nice and informative.  We ordered two glasses of wine, bruschetta appetizer, lasagna and Butternut squash raviolli and flourless chocolate cake.  I felt the ambience was nice the food was perfect and I will return with my friends next week!"}
{"text":"Even though Jennifer K. gave it two stars I had to go give it a try because of all the reviews. I really regret coming here and should have listened to Jennifer K's review.  Service was amazing but the food was below average.  Meal comes with bread as appetizer. It wasn't a garlic bread but but very similar.  Chicken Alfredo fettuccini $17.75 - portion is very small. Tasted very bland with no flavor.  Pappardelle alla bolognese $17.25 - same comments as above.   Rib panini and soup $19.75 - not on the menu but one of their seasonal specials. The rib meat was boneless and very tender fall off the bone. The seafood chowder soup didn't have any seafood that I could visually see but had a nice flavor to it. This was best dish that was ordered.   Steak panini $16.50 - comes with a arugula salad. The meat was really tough. If trying to eat this with your hands like you would eat any sandwich then good luck because the meat was so tough it was impossible and became very messy. This sandwich had to be knife and forked.  A very disappointing meal and especially for the price they charge I really was expecting much more.  The food gets a 1 star and the Service gets a 5 star - I know this doesn't average out to an overall 2 star review but the food just ruined the experience altogether."}
{"text":"Had a business lunch here this week and it's ben a couple of years since eating here!  We ordered the antipasti as an appetizer and I ordered the Tuscan Burger with house salad.  The salad was a little drenched in a pool of oil with some balsamic.  The Antipasti was good.  Tuscan burger was amazing. I thought the service was a little to be desired.  Reason being is that we had to ask for drink refills.  Also when I was looking to leave I had to take the bill up as our server was busy chatting it up with another table.  Maybe I'm just being picky but we were in a rush to leave!  For the price I expect a bit better service!"}
{"text":"Awful service, unfortunately the good food here does not make up for the unplesant experience.  First off, I have been here several times but sadly will no longer be coming back to Fraticelli's. My first experience was pleasant, the server started us off with warm bread and olive oil/vinegar and the mushroom risotto is great. The interior decor is very warm and the staff are dressed very uniform.  My last (and most recent) experience, we were not offered any bread, our server never came to check up on us at all during our meal, and, to top it off he never offered us the dessert menu for after-meal desserts/beverages.  Overall, for the price (~$20+ per entree), I expect a lot more, including consistent food and good service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to Fratichelli's for Valentine's Day. Although it was a busy night we still had an excellent meal and excellent service. A big thank you to our server for amazing wine choice! Well be back soon!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had dinner here last night.  The place has a great ambience, style and excellent service.  However, I found the food lacking.  It was my first time there, so I won't fully discount it yet.  But the pizza I had was mostly all dough with very little taste.  On a plus note, I overheard the ladies att he table next to us complain about their pasta.  The manager immediately made them a new dish,  Great service, but mediocre food."}
{"text":"Customer Service was tremendously great. I went in during valentines day alone, and I ordered a margarita pizza, and an espresso. Due to the sheer amount of couples, my order was delayed by quite a bit. But when I was trying to pay for my meal, they told me they took care of it, since my meal was delayed, so I didn't have to pay anything for that meal. The good itself isnt bad either."}
{"text":"The food was about average 3/5 but I really liked the atmosphere and the service was excellent !   I booked about a week in advance via open table and had no problems. We were almost 30 mins late and they still had the table for us. Of course it was Sunday and it's probably busier on Saturdays.   I ordered the mushroom risotto and thought it was tasty. The portion was quite decent and I ended up eating the whole thing (don't skip lunch what a bad idea). Was so full afterwards! My bff ordered the same thing but thought hers was too salty.   My hubby ordered the pizza but I think they put too little cheese. He had asked for extra cheese... imagine if he hadn't.   I would recommend this place if you have a large party. It's great going to places like these w/o having to travel all the way DT or midtown.   Not sure if it's offered for a limited time? But if you let them know you're a first time customer, they might offer a complimentary appetizer. When we got the bill, they had a feedback survey for us to complete online & you can also get a free appetizer at your next visit. But remember not to fill it out until you're actually going cuz it expires in 2-3 weeks.  Lots of parking."}
{"text":"Not a fan.  1. For the price I would expect much better. Food is bland, greasy and salty. After my meal I actually felt like I had eaten at McDonald's (not a good sign) 2. All the servers are skinny women wearing black tank tops and inappropriately short black skirts. wtf? Just weird.  Basically I must accept that there are very few good lunch options near my office. This place is not a good option and I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I'll get right to it, the restaurant looks nice, clean, but the food is over priced and subpar, and worst of all, EXTREMELY SLOW service, food took over an hour to come (and the food it wasn't even good).  Never coming back here ever again!"}
{"text":"Not sure why the review is so low for this place. I went here with a couple friends on Sunday night. The atmosphere and service were good. The food was quick and pretty good. Very likely to come again."}
{"text":"Came here with my family last Friday night to celebrate my niece's birthday.   It's been a long time since we had dinner here.  The place felt very warm as we walk into the restaurant with the bar area on one side that is partition very well from the main the dining room.  With 8 of us, its always hard to find a place with a variety of dishes to choose from.  Fraticelli's definitely has a big selection of pasta, pizza, ravioli and steak.  Unfortunately my sister was looking forward to ordering the lobster ravioli as it was on the website but it was not available at this location (maybe not in season).  My daughter got the mushroom ravioli which she said it was delicious.  My husband steak pizza with fried onion was also very good.  My top sirloin wasn't as tasty as I had hope.  Everything else that my family ordered was just okay.   Our server was very attentive and overall we enjoyed our evening."}
{"text":"Why bother damning Fraticelli's with faint praise?  It would be a waste of praise.   Toronto and its suburbs enjoy an Italian dining renaissance. From low end to high, this city has embraced the local, seasonal, soulful goodness that is rustic Italian cooking. I don't need to point you to the glowing reviews for restaurants that have been penned by better writers and bigger foodies than I.   Even the chains have gotten into the act. Toronto boasts decent pizza/pasta joints in Terroni and Mercatto. These places make a virtue of authenticity-in Terroni's case-to the point of obnoxiousness. The vibe is casual, the food fresh and well-priced. Cheap but drinkable plonk and short espresso flow easily. East Side Marios aims low; Toni Bullonis aims a bit higher.   So what did RIchmond Hill do to deserve the disaster that is Fraticellis? Were they bad?   Set in a big box block of similar corporate restaurants, you get the sense that Fratricellis is someone's attempt at a casual fine dining flagship on the order of Milestones or Moxies. All black walls, booths are crammed together so diners compete for elbow room and narrow tables make sharing a challenge.   Said tables are guarded by an attractive team of hostesses. We are nudged towards the bar despite a lack of 'reserved' signs, or any indication that somebody cooler will come along to commandeer one of the many empty tables. When we decline the wine list, the pace of the meal turns glacial.   We are serviced by a pretty but inexperienced wait staff, who huddle in the corners while we wait for drinks and bread that's fresh-baked, but only appears after appetizers have been served. By bread I mean a few slivers of what might be balled-up pizza dough. It's stingily portioned, accompanied by a puttanesca-esque olive oil dip which is the most flavorful thing we eat all night. Between the long wait and the mistiming, we resent it.  Appetizers offer limited value. A small Caesar salad comes with curls of fresh parmesan, but wears a heavy garlicky coat of dressing. It's about a coffee-mug's worth of lettuce. Six bucks may not be a lot to ask, but there's even less offered here. A $12 Fritto Misto is an outright ripoff. Promised fennel is absent. Two types of zucchini range from pleasantly crisp to outright mush; and seafood is limited to a pair of decent shrimp and two rolled curtains of uncuttably overcooked calamari. The plate is taken away without asking why the squid sits, barely punctured.   Pizzas may be a popular item on other tables but they are tiny and topped with disturbingly unmelting cheese and uniformly circular condiments. But for the thinner crust, they channel memories of high-school cafeteria pizza hut.   Mains fail to inspire. Spaghetti is properly al dente in carbonara, but the sauce lacks any kind of salty punch beyond more freshly-grated cheese on top. It's a mystery considering the amount of cheese, bacon, onions and black pepper that go into this dish when done right. A massive hunk of chicken parmesan hasn't been trimmed of cartilage, and its red sauce is also muted, much like the chicken fraricelli, which arrives dry from the grill. Accompanying pappardelle noodles in sundried tomato pesto cream sauce need salt, but have nice texture. The less said about industrial veal piccata the better.  We skip dessert and coffee.  Most galling is the  presence of Massimo Capra's smug mug on the menu, moustache waxed and teeth bared in a villainous smirk. This man captained countless Restaurant Makeovers. He's listed as a consultant here. Maybe he can call in a friend from the show to bail him out."}
{"text":"We received a $20 coupon in the mail so my family and I decided to pay a visit and try out this restaurant. I came in without much expectations but I was still quite disappointed.  to start we ordered an appetizer: Crab Arancini ($10)  there were many reviews highly recommending it so I decided to give it a try. It was essentially deep fried crab meat risotto balls. Not only was the food not hot but i could rarely taste any crab and it just tasted like a fried rice ball to me.  My brother ordered the mushroom risotto (17.25). i couldn't believe the way it was served, worst presentation ever. it was just a splatter of risotto spread flat on a plate - if you are going to serve a dish without sides or something solid, i would suggest you putting it at least in a bowl to make it look a little nicer. in terms of taste, it lacked flavor.  My dad ordered one of the linguine specials for the day - his dish was good, served with lots of veggies and the pasta was lightly dressed.  My mom ordered the chicken alfredo fettuccini (17.75) - i thought there wasn't enough flavor in the alfredo sauce and the pasta was not soft enough - could have been cooked lightly longer.  I ordered the Lobster Pancetta pizza (17.50) i think my dish tasted the best the entire night. i liked the thin crust and sauce, but i felt like there were too little lobster pieces.   One thing that i disliked the most was ALL the food dishes were NOT hot, just warm yet we waited quite a long time for our food."}
{"text":"Horrible restaurant. The Crab Arancelli was good. But the Chicken Parm was horrible, the Papardelle pasta wasn't fresh. And the pizza was ok.  Not only was the food experience disappointing, but the service was horrible. We waited for 40 mins for our server to come back to us, while we remained not eating, to bring us a container and our bill."}
{"text":"Im fairly surprised by all the negative reviews on here. Fraticelli's is one of my favourite sit down restaurants in Richmond Hill. Their decor, and food is amazing. Although their  service is a bit of a hit or miss everything else about this place is amazing. The complementary bread and olive oil sauce is so good and sometimes I wish i could just eat that as my main. The chicken piccata with basil pesto orzo is amazing!!! This is a fairly generous portion including two chicken breasts and lots of orzo topped with delicious capers. Im not a fan of pasta but I do love me some ravioli and Fraticelli's did not disappoint, my only negative comment would be that the ravioli was a bit too buttery but nonetheless still delicious. Overall im always fairly pleased with this place, and I have yet to sit on their patio :)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and we ordered house salad, lobster pizza, caprese sandwich, and carbonara. None of their dishes stood out and pizza was bit too salty. I find that it's pricey for the quality of food you get there It ended up costing over $25 per person after tax and tip. I remember this place being really good when it first opened a number of years back but it's not the same anymore. I would not return here."}
{"text":"This place always been one of the top spots in the city! I have been coming to this place for years now since it first opened few years ago.  Always great for couples or semi-big groups, the bar area is pretty hipped as well, very cool spot!  My favourite and recommendation are the muscles, chicken bites and calamari..and most definitely their Chicken Parmesan is amazing!  Service is exceptional, host and manage"}
{"text":"Thanks for the $20 off coupon from Fraticelli's via Email, I got to come back and give them another try.  I love the idea of having a feature menu as the regular menu had not been changed for years and I always like the try new things!  Lamb Shank ($31) was so tender and tasty. I love the Parsley-Mint gremolata garnish and being braised in Chianti gave it a more complex flavour.  Fettuccini Gamberetti ($20) was just so pretty in Green with the help of pesto sauce and baby arugula. Love the plating!  There was no hostess at the front when I walked in and waiting in the front for over 5 minute until one of the wait staff noticed me. I could tell the restaurant was really understaffed. But good to see that the place was busy."}
{"text":"went in for Winterlicious last night.  the atmosphere is great and the service started off lovely but then as the night went on. our server cared less and less..... we had the Lasagna and Mushroom Risotto.  Risotto was pretty salty but still acceptable.  don't think I'd go back when there's so many other choices though......"}
{"text":"The restaurant is definitely very similar to moxie and milestone, but prices, services and food are definitely better at moxie and milestone.   My friend ordered a risotto and it was mushy and salty.  This has really disappointed me big time considering this is a higher end restaurant, my salad was not bad.  However what needs to draw attention here is the service.  The waitresses are all pretty looking but the service was hardly there and not to mention she became very rude towards the end of the service.  I definitely won't come back here again, and by looking at the reviews that other Hellers have been giving here, I doubt this place will survive for more than two years.  Honestly I would rather go to moxie or milestone for better service and food quality."}
{"text":"Well, I did go back to try it out one more try. I ordered the Lasgna this time. The server was really nice. She smiled everytime she came to our table. She walked quickly and always checked to see if our food was okay. The most impressive thing was she remembered our order without writing it down!"}
{"text":"We've been there before with our family and the food was amazing. Our last visit was a week ago and it was disgusting.  Seating was perfect and hostess was kind and attentive.  The food was dressed with mayo as sauce.  The gnocchi was fried ..tasted like rubber.  It's not a cheap place and I'm guessing there must be a high rate of chef turn over.  Very displeased considering the price.  Never go again."}
{"text":"Not an authentic Italian restaurant. But I love this place all the dishes I've tried were very good. I love there fried calamari with fresh fennel. And there seafood pasta in a white wine cream sauce. Is to die for. Price and portions are reasonable, service is very good. Not a place where you take small kids or family. I would recommend date night, friend night or even business meetings. The atmosphere is very modern and elegant. The only thing I would recommend is to get better desserts not a big fan of there lemon tirimisu."}
{"text":"I've been coming here off and on since the place opened.  I had a love and hate relationship at the beginning.  Years ago, depending on which night you went, the food was different and had no consistency.  One time, I loved they antipasti and then the next time it was completely different.  We asked about it and then they told me it was me...I must have been mistaken.  Well in that case...looks like a FUGAZI.  Didn't go back in years until a friend wanted to meet there.  Well...Well...Well...Welcome back Peter.  The place is exactly the same as I remembered it but things have changed.  First of all the staff in the Lounge are great!  Everyone of them are attentive and friendly.  Service has not been an issue the last several times I have been there.  I'm there usually for drinks - beer and wines.  They have an acceptable wine list for a Turtle Jack's place - not sure it they are affiliates anymore.  The only thing lacking is the food.  I find it not up to par to make this a 5-star rating.  Don't get me wrong.  The food is more than acceptable, however, let's make sure the sauce and arancini is heated through.  The calamari was overly salty....etc.  Still need a little bit of work with the kitchen but overall, they go out of the way to see that the customer is right and deserves the best they can do.  What a great change.  If you like crowds and live performances, go on Thursday night.  Place is packed and $6 Moretti and $10 pizza doesn't hurt either.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant many times. The passed couple of times I've been impressed with the service. It has been getting better. They have a nice patio and I have heard their one man band a couple of times. I must say I enjoyed the music.  In total, it's a nice place which is getting better and better when it comes to service"}
{"text":"Returned with the family.  My one child ordered the salmon again and said it was an improvement over last time.   I had a striploin which was ok...  Nothing g special but was satisfactory. I'll keep this place at 3 stars.  It's a ok by me."}
