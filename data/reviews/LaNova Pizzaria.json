{"text":"I would eat here 3 times a day if I could. I've had pizza, gyros, hoagies, and appetizers from this location. The staff is very friendly, and the food is great. If you are in the neighborhood do yourself a favor, and order a $5 gyro."}
{"text":"Delicious. I asked about the dough, made fresh everyday. The sauce, not too sweet, informed was also made by the owner. Two types of mozzarella and provolone cheese. Fresh vegetable toppings. Some of the best pizza I've ever had."}
{"text":"Typical yinzer pizza. Bland cheese, cardboard crust, and ragu. Save yourself the trouble"}
{"text":"Ordered gyro  and jalapeño poppers for delivery at 3:00pm, Friday afternoon. Came to $11 and change. I am within walking distance so delivery should be pretty quick.  (yeah, I could have walked but just didn't feel like it). Delivery was quick as expected but driver didn't have change for a $20!  Gyro was just delicious. Best $5 sandwich if found anywhere. Jalapeño poppers were standard fare. I'll have to walk down and try the pizza soon."}
{"text":"An okey pizza joint for a quick bite to eat while out drinking.  Nothing really special about their food, as most is just heat and serve from a mass supplier. I would pass on this place if something better is at hand."}
