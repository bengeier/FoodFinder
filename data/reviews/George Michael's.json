{"text":"Decided to try this restaurant based on recommendations and reviews read, which all rated it highly. We found the restaurant decor to be dated, the service slow and unfriendly and the food very average. The starter of prawns consisted of cheap ingredients, that appeared frozen, much like that found in your local supermarket. The main course was to be served with seasonal vegetables, however we were served three types of potatoes  carb over load, cheesy carrots and beans. Not very seasonal and not suiting the fish dish ordered. The wine list is mediocre, cheap supermarket brands.  I could not recommend this restaurant based on our dining experience and personally would not visit again."}

{"text":"Located centrally in the middle of town, this Greek restaurant is well worth a visit if you're in the mood for something a little different.    The staff are friendly and enthusiastic, the menu is simple and yet provides for everyone. The wine list is more than suitable and the choice of other alcoholic drinks is very good - the brandy sour cocktail in particular is recommended.    The food is, as you'd expect, mostly greek style food, but they also offer things you wouldnt necessarily expect to find on a greek menu - chicken kiev for example. Either way, its hot and tastes fine, and is brought to your table in a timely manner. Desserts are, as in most cases, slightly over-priced, but an excellent way to round of the evening.    Twice we've taken parties in excess of 30 people to George Michaels, and both times they've coped without any strain or problems. One of Scarboroughs better restaurants, to my mind, and well worth a visit."}
{"text":"Average food. Tacky pseudomediterranean decor. Inattentive staff with slow service with a scowl. Dish with lobster was without lobster. Prawns were supermarket basic grade and clearly defrosted. 'Seasonable vegetables' was cheesy carrots, green beans and three types of potato (as if one wasn't enough). The name should be george and michaels after the two that set it up, not george michaels, no relation to the washed out homosexual celebrity but somehow trying to allude to him to gain kudos from his former fame? We will not be visiting here again. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"An unpretentious restaurant with simple, pleasant decor. Run by genial host and partner. The four of us had the meze which comes in at £39 for two. The first selection is pitta bread strips with a Greek salad, taramasalata, hummus, olives and another dip. This is followed, and I may have the order wrong, by generous portions of Mousakka, Dolmades, kebabs, calamari, kleftika and ended with sweets. It all tasted great and we were all stuffed. We also had a bottle of the house red which was a reasonable French number. Total bill for four was £95. The service was friendly and attentive. Only complaint I have is it was cold in the restaurant despite three electric heaters being on. I would recommend this place as a change from the usual Italian/Indian/Chinese you may plump for. I would happily go with mates, a loved one and even the family."}
