{"text":"I'll give 3 stars because the staff is friendly, however worst fish sandwich I've ever had in my life. The chicken wings are very good. Don't go for fish!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for drinks and bar food if you don't mind the stench of cigarette smoke. Don't expect to escape the foul smell by sitting in the \"non-smoking\" dining area, separated by doors used by bar patrons to use the bathroom.  I'll never know why any business owner would cater to the filthy, unhealthy habits of a few and risk losing the business of 76% of the population that do not smoke."}
{"text":"Love the Burrell Inn. I usually sit in the dining room but they also have a bar. My go to meal is a salad with the house Italian dressing and the Buffalo chicken sandwich. It feels me up and is not to expensive at all."}
{"text":"Love this bar. We have been visiting the Burrell inn for years. Amazing wings, pizza, beer, and apps. The chicken salad is a weekly take out for my family. I get it with breaded chicken. If you go to drink ask for the river hound it's Jameson red bull and grenadine, it's fantastic and they make it best. The owner is almost always there and he makes you feel welcome. If you don't like the smoke the outdoor seating areas are complete with coverage and tv,s. Please go to the Burrell Inn  INN FOR THE WIN"}
{"text":"Stopped in to order a White pizza after shopping. Do I did not order ahead. First time there, wasn't a menu posted to see what options were... Ordered the White pizza almost 30 minute wait and was unimpressed with the pizza. Thin and no flavor."}
{"text":"Dining room's in the back & no smoking. They have great outdoor seating too. My go-to's are the House salad with house dressing (I crave this dressing & you can buy a bottle, which I recommend), jumbo wings with regular seasoning, pierogi pizza, & delicious Fries + gravy!"}
{"text":"I love going here! You can go to the bar, or be more family friendly and stay on the other side or nice pation. I usually only get the steak salad, which I love!! It's huge and has lots of ingredients in it! May I add their house dressing is amazinggg!!! I have had their fish sandwich on Friday (it's different on Friday than any other day). It is very good and again a nice cuz piece of fish. I definitely recommend trying it!"}
