{"text":"Kathy's is not filthy! The decor is a little off putting, but best described as good old fashion \"hole in the wall\". The food is great, freshly cooked after you order, thus the reason for the wait., which can seem like an eternity, when you are hungry. I wish they would serve some complimentary cornbread or some type homemade bread to nibble on while you wait. It is cheap and could help with patience while you are waiting.  Might help with customer service. Fried chichen is great, greens, oxtails, porkchops you name it we have had it, and it was all good. The peach cobbler was JUST like Grandmas, I almost cried !!  A little pricey, but it is very good. Pay in cash, their pay system is weird and you get charged $3.50 for using your debit, no warning about it either. So take CASH."}
{"text":"I was visting Las Vegas and my family came down from Utah to have lunch with us while we were up there. We tried to go to a catfish place, but they were closed so I managed to find this gem on my iPhone. Yes, it's a bit off the strip, but it was yummmmy.
First walking in, it's really small and kinda cheesy looking but the waiter was ok not overly friendly though, but cute. :) 
The menu is kinda small, but it was still hard to make a decision, everything sounded good. I finally settled on good ole chicken fried steak with mac n cheese and mashed potatos. I know, it's not the greens and stuff people would get here, but I'm picky. :) 
The fried chicken was supposed to be amazing so my boyfriend ordered that, my grandma got catfish and my uncle had the shrimp etouffe. 
After placing our orders, the guy came back and told me they were out of chicken fried steak, wtf?! So I changed my order to friend shrimp.
It took awhile to get the food out, which is okay because it was homemade. But we only got our glasses filled up once while we were there and we had to flag the guy down to do it. And they wern't busy so I was really confused as to why our service wasn't better. Seriously, there was like no one in there. 
After a bit, our waiter brought us out some cornbread, and oh lord, I don't know if I was starving or if it was really that good, but I ate it up so quick. It was sweet cornbread with yummy melty butter on it. Sigh, it was great. Bad thing is they don't give you unlimited, only one per person. 

The food finally came, and I think all around everyone was pretty pleased. My shrimp  was huge and done in cornmeal, I've never had it that way before but it was delicious all the same. They didn't have any coctail sauce which kinda stunned me but whatev, Their tartar sauce was good and I don't normally like it so eh. Mac and cheese and potatoes you could tell were homemade, nice and cheesy and hot. :) 
The fried chicken was good, nothing to quite write home about, same for the catfish. HOWEVER, the shrimp etouffe was absolutely AMAZING! It had a nice cream sauce, big pieces of shrimp, like basically yummy looking. But you bite into it and flavor explodes in your mouth. It was kinda spicy, but not overbearing and so.... uh... delicious! 

Anyway, all in all a fun experience, definitely something out of my comfort zone, worth the trip, but pretty pricey. Be prepared to drop some dough here. Looking at like $15+ per person. Pay with cash, their credit card/debit card thing is weird. They can only do it in increments of $10 and then give you cash back, kinda rubbed me the wrong way."}
{"text":"I've been feenin for some good fried chicken and when our fellow Yelpers Nelson and Sylvia invited us to eat at Kathy's I knew this place had to be legit.

We arrived a bit before 6pm and we were immediately greeted by the staff.  Talk about Southern Hospitality! Each person greeted us with open smiles.

I ended up ordering the 3 piece fried chicken meal with two sides and cornbread.  The two sides I ordered were the sweet yams and the collard greens. The wifie ordered the same meal but with the mac and cheese. Be prepared as the chicken is made to order so it took a good 20-30 min. but it was well worth the wait. 

As our food came out my mouth started to salivate as pieces of chicken were pretty big. It came with a breast, leg, and thigh and it was cooked to perfection, crispy on the outside but nice and juicy on the inside. It had a very light crust that packed a lot of flavor. I like my chicken with a good hot sauce so had to smother some Louisiana hot sauce on it for some heat.  I felt like a kid again saving my chicken skin for last. I was even a bit jealous as the wifie's pieces were a little bit bigger than mine. The sides were good but the highlight of the meal was the chicken. 

I hope to come back and try their other southern dishes maybe even order a fried chicken family meal just for myself. These types of hole in the wall places usually serve the best food. If you don't mind the area then I would definitely recommend checking out Kathy's Southern Kitchen"}
{"text":"I had some wicked pregnancy cravings for Southern cooking tonight... so I stopped in to cure it.  Thank you so much for the delicious food!   Felt my baby move for the first time tonight... I'm sure she was giving this business a high five!"}
{"text":"Love the food and the \"homelike\" service. I've only hand 1 thing on the menu but it's so good that I can't get off it...Fried Chicken (the best I've ever had) dinner with potato salad and red beans and rice. 
I have 3 different cakes all very good but keep and eye out for the German chocolate cake...it's amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I love Kathy's.  My favorite is Smothered Pork chops and Fish/Shrimp dinner.

Feels like home when I walk in.  A very friendly environment! !"}
{"text":"I would first like to say that the location of this place was easy for me to find. I rated Kathy's Southern Cooking 2-stars for the following reasons. #1 Customer Service/ Etiquette was very poor. In my opinion when an order is placed and you do not have that particular item (i.e. Peach Cobbler) available at that moment, you are to express a little sympathy or at least be a TINY bit apologetic for that item not being available at the customers request. To ask the customer \"What do you want me to do about it\"? Is extremely rude!!! I would have gladly waited for said item had the man at the front counter had a different approach. I took off 2 stars just for this particular reason. There are certain ways you should speak to people. I understand that when cooking any southern meal/food that it takes a bit of time. I was very excited when I walked into this establishment. Poor service etiquette is very unacceptable. And #2 Food was just above average. I ordered a catfish dinner for myself w/ a side of greens & also ordered a chicken dinner & a hot-link w/ banana pudding for someone else. We both agreed that the Mac N' Cheese was at best rated a 1 out of 10. It tasted exactly like the Mac n cheese from KFC! The greens that I ordered were very good w/ hot sauce. They weren't seasoned heavily at all, I assume to give you the option to add seasoning yourself. The mashed potatoes & gravy were delicious! No complaints. The hot-link was covered in BBQ sauce & was regular, nothing too good or too bad. I have tasted better, I'm not sure where they get theirs from. Both the catfish and the chicken were good!!! The batter for both was good as well! And the banana pudding was pretty tasty. I did not get to try the cornbread that was supposed to be included with my dinner because unfortunately, they left it out. My overall opinion is that the food is good, the service is extremely poor. I actually still would have come to this place but due to my experience, I will gladly return to M&M's Soul Food Cafe! I hope that this review is helpful to someone when going Kathy's Southern Cooking."}
{"text":"Where do I start? I ordered chicken fingers and fries for the kids... they are hand-breaded and as fresh as you can get it. I ordered the Gumbo that was delicious and the portion size was so large that I will have lunch for tomorrow. My spouse got the fried chicken dinner with greens and black eyed peas. The fried chicken is to die for and also made to order. Yes, this location is smaller than the other place in Henderson that they used to own, but it is definately worth it. So many of the reviews that are on here talk about the wait, but what do you expect with homecooked meals? I mean Kathy's is not like McDonalds with frozen chicken. I say try it once, and I am sure that you will be a regular."}
{"text":"I don't understand some of the other reviews because this is our most favorite place to eat in las Vegas. We've probably been there 20 times already and everyone we take loves it too. 

Ok, being from Hawaii we don't know much about southern cooking but this has the best fried chicken, pork chop and collards ever. Wish they would open in Hawaii. It is a \"hole in the wall\" kinda place but great food, good value & great hospitality."}
{"text":"Kathy's Southern Cooking has THE BEST fried chicken!  Absolutely delicious.  The mashed potatoes and gravy, and mac and cheese also rock. 

Everything is made fresh, so to avoid waiting at least a half hour, call your order in beforehand.

The staff at Kathy's is always pleasant. They care about producing quality food and they do not disappoint.

This is the only place I will go to when I want fried chicken."}
{"text":"5 stars for southern cooking...not healthy and definitely a take-out only spot in my opinion (we have never been here but the reviews seem to imply it's not worth the trip). Anything U Want picks this up for us every once in a while. They don't use pork in the preparation of their sides which is a huge plus for us, as M & Ms soul food does. Their fried wings are always cooked properly with the right amount of seasoning. Their mac & cheese is just decent (which I know is a huge disappointment) but I make a little adjustment to it by adding a little cheese to the top and baking it prior to serving it.

Pros: Great take-out, fried chicken, sides

Cons: a little pricey for fried food"}
{"text":"My wife and I have been driving by Kathy's for the past 8 years. Back when they were still located on Mountain Vista. Last night we decided to finally try it and found out that they relocated. Despite the extra 10 minute drive we found ourselves at Kathy's. First I did not expect to meet the Kathy but sure enough she was there to take my order. Very nice woman and took my order like I was her first customer ever. I ordered the chicken dinner my wife ordered the catfish. Both were phenomenal great crunch and seasoning. I also enjoyed the red beans and rice, but the Mac and cheese was awesome."}
{"text":"Took a friend to Kathy's since it's down the street from her office annnnd ...my usual, following in the footsteps of Master Nelson.

Fried Chicken ( $10.75 ) and catfish ( forgot the price but the total bill including 2 canned sodas and a side order of a link was $31.)  Both include 2 sides and corn bread.

Sides - greens, cole slaw, potato salad and mac n cheese.

Nondescript store - except, interestingly, kitchen area ( burners, flat top and others ) in front area of place yet you don't see them using to cook your food.

Have to ding this place one star .....S L O W !!  Best you call in the order in advance.

Fried Chicken - excellent - crispy yet tender and juicy - perfectly cooked.

Catfish - decent crunch yet flaky fish - large pieces would've been nice.

All the sides average to above average.  I did not try the cornbread.

Servers were nice.

I'll be back.

pics included"}
{"text":"We were looking forward to going here, but by the time I left it was by far the worst meal I've ever been served here in vegas.  Yes, people have mentioned that the place is dirty...I wouldnt disagree with that, however, its so much more than a little dirt thats wrong with this place.

First, the decor.  Come on.  There's half of a To-Go box stapled to the wall with $.50 written on it.  You have to pay $.50 to have your crappy food brought home with you.  The rest of the place looks like it was straight outta some sort of factory employee break room in 1975.

Second, the employees.  The waiter came up to our table and took the extra paper place mats and said nothing to us.  No greeting.  Nothing.  After he came back he asked what we wanted to drink.  Once he brought our water back (im seriously surprised they didnt charge for water) he sat it on the table and then stared at us.  I guess this was our queue to order!

Third, the prices.  Alot of things on the menu were $16.99 or $17.99.  Not a good sight for any eyes sitting in this dump.  Maybe it would have been worth it, maybe not.  Im guessing the latter.  The \"sides\" such as collared greens, FRENCH FRIES, mac and cheese and coleslaw were $4.75 a pop.  Paying $4.75 for a side of fries is ludicrous.

On to our actual food.  Being that I wasnt about to spend $40 on a meal here, I opted for the BBQ Beef Brisket sandwich special with fries.  My husband got the Catfish sandwich with coleslaw.  Kathy took her sweet time making this that's for sure.  After our \"waiter\" took our order it took 35 minutes for 2 sandwiches, 1 that was a special, to arrive to our table.  Being that I had to be home to get ready for work sooner than later, I was watching the clock like a hawk.   That is unacceptable being that there was literally ONE table in the place and they were already eating.  I saw ONE take out order come in to pick up.  What the heck took Kathy so long???  I guess its that slow southern livin' i dontgiveadamn attitude that exuded from that place.

Once our food actually arrived I should have refused it and left right then.  My sandwich was on half a hoagie roll with a mediocre amount of semi-stale fries.  My husbands \"catfish sandwich\" was served as 2 pieces of the driest looking catfish Ive ever seen next to 2 slices of bread.  Now these were 2 slices of bread that come straight out of the $.79 loaf of Great Value bread from walmart.  The bread was cut in half.  Thats it.  That was the sandwich.  There was a tiny side of coleslaw next to it.  No lettuce, no tomato.  Nothing.  It was disgusting.  I tasted a piece of it and it was SO FISHY tasting, I thought it was almost uneatable.  

So now was go on to pay.  Our bill came to $16 and something cents.  As my husband went to pay with his debit card, Kathy told us that she would have to charge his card $20 and give us the rest back in change!!!  Oh, but here's the kicker....it would also charge us an extra $1.50 JUST LIKE AN ATM.  

What the F*CK.

Luckily I had cash with me.

Kathy's Southern Cooking should be ashamed to even be open.  Its a dirty, dingy, overpriced, restaurant with horrible food.  I wont ever be going back here and I hope you dont either."}
{"text":"Hubby and I are craving for soul food and found Kathy's here in Yelp. We were greeted by a friendly waitress. I ordered sweet tea while hubby had a can of soda. The sweet tea is hella sweet, just how hubby likes his tea but it's too sweet for me.  We got our drinks right away.  Hubby ordered fried pork chops with gravy on the side with rice and mac n cheese. I ordered the fried chicken with mac n cheese and sweet yam. First I was told that I can get the fried okra as one of my side dishes but the waitress returned and informed us that it needs to be ordered as appetizer. I want the fried okra so we ordered is as appetizer anyways. We waited for our food (including the appetizer) for half an hour... mind you we were the only customers there. The corn bread, fried okra and our meal arrived at the same time. The delay on the arrival of the food cost them a star. 

Let's talk about the quality of food:
1) Corn bread - dry, nothing special just like what other reviewers said.
2) Fried Chicken - not bad at all. They gave me 1 wing, 1 small leg and 1 small thigh. It was crispy on the outside but juicy on the inside.
3) Mac & Cheese - not bad as well but I've had better. (Was stationed in Mississippi,  Louisiana and Oklahoma so I've had quite a lot of great southern food experiences).
4) Sweet Yam - its not bad as well but I was never a big fan of sweet yam anyways.
5) Fried Pork chops - Hubby enjoyed them very much. It has great taste and perfectly cooked.
6) Gravy - this was a little disappointing as it was lumpy and lack seasoning.  It was bland. Thank God hubby didn't get the smothered pork chops coz I know he would've been disappointed because good gravy is really important for him. This cost them another star unfortunately.
7) Fried Okra - was cooked well but nothing special. The batter would have been good if it was seasoned well.

For the quality of food and the portions, I have to agree with other reviewers...they are quite pricey. I don't think we will be back here again."}
{"text":"I'm really torn between B.K.  & Rachel M.

I was referred by a friend so that always helps, They should have called the place \"the little hole in the wall\"  It was extremely hard to find. Once inside I was not impressed. The walls were poorly painted an ugly beige color, although there was a nice mural on one side. 

Were were seated right away and our drink orders were taken. 
The menu's did seem a bit old but no big deal, right? 
While givin our order, I failed to notice the small print under the \"sandwiches\" that said only from Tues -Fri... so Today on my Saturday visit, there was no choice but to get a \"full dinner\" some of the menu seemed a bit pricey for the atmo too.

We noticed the place got rather full very quick! A very nice couple was seated next to us & that made for some nice \"small talk\".  

Something else we noticed.. it was taking FOREVER to get our food.
WE WAITED A WHOLE 50 MINUTES BEFORE OUR FOOD ARRIVED!!!!
but it was good. My daughter had a fried pork chop, mashed potatoes & gravy w/ a side of corn.... she totally loved it. 
 I ordered spareribs.. super good & tender.  My friend ordered hot links, she said they were excellent. I noticed my daughter pork chops were a little dry but she didn't seem to mind.  Mac & Cheese was pretty good, the yams were really good, although I felt the potato salad was not my style. Corn bread was good/not sweet. 

If you want someone who went & passed top of the class at the Culinary art institute YOUR NOT GONNA FIND IT HERE...

but if you want some GREAT HOME COOKING, this is were it's at.

I fell B.K. ,may have been turned away at the site of the place without giving it a chance. 

Worth a try but give your self a good 1 1/2 to eat... or just call for a take out order...that would be best!

(although my 6yr old loved it I said not good for kids because they took so long & some little ones may get restless)"}
{"text":"I  found this place while doing my laundry.  I figured I would try it out, I like to try the small local places while travelling for work.
It is small and unassuming.  The menu is not very big, which I like.  Some places are so varied I lose faith in their ability to nail anything down.
I had the fried chicken, mashed potatoes and man & cheese.  Took twenty minutes, that's great, it usually means they don't have food laying around pre-made.
Well worth the wait!!  Not over breaded, not over greasy.  It was delicious and EXACTLY what I wanted and just the way I wanted it.
The only reason I gave it four stars was that I wish the chicken would have been a four piece instead of three.  I love a drumstick.
BIG PLUS--- She made the gravy right there in front of me for my mashed potatoes.
It was delicious.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!"}
{"text":"As I was slowing down for a light I looked over and noticed the restaurant and knew that I had to try it.  

Settled on the smothered chicken (three pieces in brown gravy) which came with two sides of which I had red beans and mac & cheese.  To drink, I had sweet tea.

The very nice lady that took my order (I believe it was Ms. Kathy's daughter) was very nice and accommodating.  She offered to throw some rice into the beans and to top off my sweet tea that I was nursing while I waited.

I look forward to coming back."}
{"text":"MmmmmMmmm I love me some Southern Cooking! And although there are a few other Southern places in town that I like for different food items I come to Kathy's for their Fried Chicken.  Seriously the best fried chicken dinner in town!  

You will wait for about 20 minutes for your Fried Chicken since \"Tiny\" does not take shortcuts and once your plate arrives you will taste why.   Three pieces of fried to perfection goodness!!! The crispy well-seasoned lightly crispy battered chicken is always juicy and goes even better with their many sides to choose from.  It comes with their Cornbread which is okay, a little on the dry side but it is served warm with a side of butter.  For my sides I always get their Yams, Mac-n-Cheese, and Collard Greens but they also have Black Eyed Peas, Potato Salad, Mash Potatoes and Gravy, and Fried Okra to choose from. 

Also save room for dessert because their Banana Pudding and Peach Cobbler are a must try. They also on occasion have German Chocolate Cake or some kind special cake of the day. 

The ambiance definitely needs some TLC but the food and service make up for it IMO and it is certainly better looking than their former location.  

There are so many other items on their menu to choose from and glancing over to the other diners it all looks and smells delicious. I will eventually try their other specialties but so far I can't convince myself long enough to stray away from their Fried Chicken!"}
{"text":"Being from the Pacific Northwest I was looking forward to some good soul food. Sorry to say I was very disappointed. The smothered chicken I ordered seemed to be  old and reheated. The mac and cheese was just average, but the greens were great!  unfortunately I can not recommend this establishment to others."}
{"text":"I was referred here by a friend after finishing up a very long and difficult Vegas weekend (you all know how that goes), and sending off for the ride home simply would not have been possible for my friends and I if not for Kathy's Southern Cooking. Mary was very kind to us, and the food was just as kind! 

I had the fried chicken, and it was honestly some of the best I've ever had; extremely tender and juicy. The sides (I had potato salad and macaroni and cheese) were amazing as well; and the lemonade was probably the best lemonade I've ever experienced (hand squeezed). 

All in all, the experience at Kathy's was a very warm and welcoming one. You can always distinguish when a restaurant makes their food with normal ingredients or with love; this place certainly makes their food with love, and the proof is in the chicken."}
{"text":"I live real close and go there like twice a month.  The food is wonderful, I like the fried chicken so much that I've only had that.  The yams are like my Grandmother used to make.  Kathy is a lovely lady and a pleasure to talk too."}
{"text":"I love the food, I would not eat there, but the food is worth it just to take it out.   A lot of the reviews complain about the decor or lack there of, but if your going there - your going for the FOOD.  The fried chicken is to die for, well cooked and crispy.  The yams I could not have made them better myself.  The sweet potato pie was delicious.  While taking out last week another customer was raving on about how good the smoothed pork chops were , how she goes there at least 2 times a week for different things.  I've been there a few times and it's well worth looking past the horrible decor and service to just be able to take come some wonderful homemade food.  I'm actually gong to call in an order to pick up tonight...."}
{"text":"There is a new location open on the corner of Desert Inn and Sandhill. 
702-433-1005. 
 I ordered the fried chicken dinner and the smothered chicken dinner. It came with two sides and corn bread. The dinners were about $9.00 each. 3 large peices of chicken and 2 sides.  I had to wait 30 mins but it was well worth it. Next time I will call it in. The fried chicken was delicious. Crispy, fresh, moist..a little bit of hot sauce and wow! The yams and the mac and cheese were amazing. I am very particular about mac and cheese and this was the best I've had in a long time. I see that this place had really horrible reviews when they were at the old location. I guess maybe they've stepped it up. The place isn't dirty and I found the service very friendly and prompt. Honestly this place is very good.   Try out the new location. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"There is something about the south that intrigues me.    The Beach boys might have said it best by singing, \"the southern girls with the way they talk they knock me out when I'm down there\"  or maybe it's the food?    We'll come back to this shortly.

Today,  I went to Costco Henderson  to get some in gas, and then decide to take a new shorter route to Chinatown, and found Kathy Southern Cooking on Desert Inn road.    I was stunned to see them, because I thought they went out of business from their old Henderson location.     

I didn't do a illegal u-turn, but I made a mental note to make this my next fried chicken fix;    The sad thing about this, that darn mental note mixed up the neuro synopsis in my brain, and told me not to eat anything in Chinatown.    Slowly and surely, I was started to become like Pavlov's dog.     The word, Fried Chicken, Fried Chicken was shouting out for third time in a week, and I could resist any longer.

Somehow, I made it back to Kathy's that evening, and gave in to the fried Chicken gods.    

I remember the old place in Henderson, and this restaurant is a reversal of the old, and Kathy's has a bigger kitchen but less tables.     It didn't matter to me, I got there pretty late, and was their last customer of the night.     

I knew, what I wanted, and understood a fried chicken dinner ($ 9.99 for three pieces, 2 sides and corn bread) will take 20 minutes.    What makes Kathy's kitchen unique is it open view of the cooking area.    i was surprised that they make their mac and cheese by order, and not some pre-made sitting in a warmer.     Service was good, but not Marvelous.  (I just wanted to use that word today...lol)      

After taking my first bite of the chicken, and I have to say sorry Flavor flav, you don't have the best friend chicken in the area.    Mama Kathy just knocked you out.   It wasn't too salty and was very juicy, and crunchy.    Kathy's side are very good too, and made it meal to remember.  I forgot to  mention, the homemade gravy is to die for.

I'm very happy to find Kathy's again, but my age old question is still hanging  there....is it the food or the way the women talk from the south?    Well, for today...my stomach is saying the food.     Maybe it will change tomorrow :)"}
{"text":"The location was not hard to find thanks to google maps. When we walked in there was only one other customer seated and already waiting on his meal. The staff was friendly and greeted us as soon as we walked through the doors. We ordered the catfish and chicken dinner with identical sides of mash potatoes and Mac n cheese . The chicken was DELICIOUS!!!! The fish was ok, it did not have much seasoning at all but still edible. I personally liked the mash potatoes and gravy. The macaroni and cheese however lacked in presentation as well as flavor. The food did take a while to come but I'm not complaining because it was fresh. The prices however were a bit pricy, but they may have a pricy overhead. Overall it was good, I would definitely come back, especially for the chicken."}
{"text":"I am always on a quest to find great soul food joints here in Vegas and this place might possibly be my new favorite thanks to the goddess Kathy and her heavenly cuisine. I swear I feel like I have stumbled into my mother's kitchen every time I eat here. Some of the best soul food I have had in a very long time. 

The space is very small but the food makes up for it in authenticity, flavor and taste. I can't say enough about the Seafood Plate!! It is a platter with all the fixing's from ettouffe, fried catfish, crab and shrimp...a must have on every visit. The cornbread is always cooked to perfection, the cabbage and black-eyed peas sides make me feel like I have been tossed into the back woods of Louisiana somewhere. The smothered pork chops with a side of mac n' cheese is another favorite. The meat literally falls off the bone and that is seriously all I ever leave on the plate afterward.....the bone! Don't forget accompany your meal with a glass of sweet tea! So much good food and because now that I have adopted Kathy as my second mother, I will be back!"}
{"text":"Just had Kathy's two days ago and I must say it was the highlight of my Vegas trip. The fried chicken was some of the best that I ever had. It is a small, hole in the wall place that isn't much to look at, however, the food was amazing and our waiter was very nice and attentive. The macaroni and cheese, in addition to the red beans and rice were delicious. The cornbread was yummy as well. My only complaint is that they didn't have any yams and it was in the middle of the day. I would recommend this place to all soul food lovers."}
{"text":"Wow, am I glad I saw some Yelpers mention this in Talk or what?! Kathy's is in a small center on the SW corner of DI & Sandhill. Don't ask me how...but we managed to drive right past it without seeing the sign. The inside is the same, it doesn't look much like a restaurant...more like a take out only kinda place. There isn't much to look at and only a couple tables.  

I ordered catfish and the wife went with fried chicken. Both dishes were unbelievable! Definitely some of the best catfish I've had in town and my wife says it's the best fried chicken she's had here. The catfish has an amazing crust! It's cooked perfectly, super flaky and tons of flavor. The chicken is the same...fried perfect golden brown, juicy & most on the inside and the skin is really crispy and flavorful. They also make their own hot sauce and it goes really good with both fish and chicken. All the sides were pretty good besides the mac n cheese which was a little bland. Their cornbread is delicious! And they have some killer desserts...the banana pudding is amazing!

We really loved Kathy's! For the portions, you can't beat the price. They have great customer service and 20 minutes isn't long to wait for some fresh fried chicken. I don't drink sweet tea so it was disappointing they don't serve unsweetened tea. The restaurant was clean for the most part but it just doesn't feel like a place to sit down and eat which is a knock for me. Besides that, I'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"We tried Kathy's last night for the first time. We loved it. We had Shrimp Etouffee served with green beans and Fried Chicken with yams and mac n cheese. The Etouffee was rich, savory and delicious. Loved it. The Chicken exactly what you want friend chicken to be, crispy, juicy perfect. The sides were all very good too and the yams really stood out, not over sweetened, good layers of flavor. We also had corn bread before our meals arrived. It was perfect, not too sweet or cakey, just the right amount of grit. Just like mom made!The place is a bare bones storefront with about 6 tables. Service was friendly. This is the kind of place you love to find and we will be back, a lot. It was so good, cant wait to try other food on the menu."}
{"text":"Review is based on food.  Food is always, always good here.  We ordered the catfish with mac n cheese, greens and yams.  Mac n cheese are decent, I've had better.  The yams and greens were super good!!  Catfish was fresh and fried in clean oil, you can just tell.  Staff is friendly.

Now onto the decor.  They moved from their old location. New location is a store front restaurant.  The kitchen is huge and the space for tables is small. Seems like they're accommodating for takeout orders.  They only have about 6 tables.  Plain white walls and a small tv.  But who cares, you're not really coming here for the decor right? If you're looking for some good ole southern food in Vegas, this is the place.  Get your mind off of the decor and concentrate on the food and you'll enjoy yourself!!!"}
{"text":"The place is pretty small and they only have about 5 tables... Once I ate the food I knew why. They don't want people falling asleep. The food its delicious like Sunday dinner @ grandmas house. There are a couple of things that need to change but overall I was happy with my visit."}
{"text":"used to go occasionally to old location and had pretty good food and went back and found it was gone. That was a couple years ago. We found it again on Desert Inn and had to try it. Went day after Christmas and found it was closed for 2 days for holliday. Went back next day and it was open. Ordered food at counter and was asked if it was \"for here or to go?\". Wife and I both ordered catfish but wife had greens and yams for sides and I had fries and slaw. We joked about who was from the farthest south by the sides. New location has 7 tables and seats 22 people. It is as one reviewer stated like an old factory break room. There was one table occupied with a couple and a teenage boy beside us. When food came both orders were identical including the sides. I pointed out I ordered different sides and waiter said \"no you both ordered the same\". I pointed out he agreed that my wife had ordered a more southern side and then he admitted that I had ordered slaw and fries. He asked if we needed anything else and I asked for some tartar sauce and ketchup for my fries. The fries arrived about half way through my meal and he put an empty ketchup container on the table. I called him back and asked for one with ketchup in it and he brought me a dish full instead (only have 1 container)? While there were only 3 other customers there, there must have been 10 or more people in the back kitchen not including our waiter who stayed there through most of our meal. I guess that they were family members or friends of Kathy. She never showed herself only her daughter and the waiter.  Service was almost nonexistent and lackadaisical. The food: Greens and yams were very good. cornbread average, catfish OK. It went from very thin to very thick which means some of it is either overcooked or undercooked. The other table had chitterlings and they seemed to enjoy them and ate it all. For chicken I have had better at Popeyes (I have also tried Paula Deen's and said the same thing). Kathy may be a great cook but has no concept of how to run a restaurant. Good home cooking but bad service and \"I don't give a damn\" attitude would not keep her in business in the south. My suggestion is if you want Kathy's food, call for take out. You will get better service at home and the decor has to be more attractive. You also won't feel obligated to tip for bad service."}
{"text":"I will NEVER  go back!    The food is good, but over priced!
They charge you for drink refills, they charge you for togo containers.  The blinds are broken and nasty, the ceiling fans are nasty.  And then they have the nerve to post a sign no plate picking!  Give me a freaking break!  Make your place upscale , then maybe put a sign up like that!"}
{"text":"Its been over a year since my FTR of Kathy's at this location, so its long overdue for an update, also since we were in the mood for some Fried Chicken, and as I said in my previous review, \"I'd probably return for the fried chicken\" and that's just what we did! .We stopped in for lunch and ordered up two fried chicken dinners($10.75 ea.) and wifey chose yams and mac & cheese for her sides. I went with potato salad and collard greens. Ordering different sides allows you to try different things because they're big enough for sharing. The Cornbread was nothing special and always on the dry side

I'm usually a leg and thigh guy, but somehow, a huge breast made it onto my plate!
No complaints here, but as many times as we've had their fried chicken dinner, we would always recieve a thigh, wing, and drumstick. Breast pieces cost extra. There are reviews that slam them on service and cleanliness, but when I went to wash my hands, there was no sign of backed up sewage smell. Service has always been great, and our waitress even remembered us from when we used to dine at the old Mountain Vista location (Yelp HQ STILL hasn't taken that old business page down!?)

Crispy skin and juiciness in every bite, some may feel its on the bit on the salty side, but balance it out with all the tasty sides and sweet tea, It ended up being one of the tastiest lunches we've had in a while, and the pictures don't lie...Yes, Vegas has slim pickins when it comes to soul food places, and I've tried many other places(House of Flavor-RIP, M&M's, and Ella Em's, and these places don't even come close when it comes to fried chicken IMHO. If you're in the area and got the patience to wait for fried chicken done right, you may want to give Kathy's a try....ALOHA!!!

YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2013-(40/100) \"KFC...Kathy's Fried Chicken\""}
{"text":"Look, the food at kathys speaks for its self. Matter of fact its singing the gospel to you with every blissful bite. Now I know soul food like my last name, I was practically raised by the waitresses of soul food restaurants that my pops took me too, not to mention soul food is the only thing my grandparents cook and eat. With that said, the food at Kathy's southern kitchen is by far one of my top five on my list, no question, hands down with ten toes on the ground this spot is on there job. Last night was my second time eating here, the first time a family friend took me and my folks here when we first moved from L.A like six months ago. We came in and seated ourselves because it was only like four or six tables in the joint and besides some dude waiting for his take out order there wasn't any other customers there. We were greeted, Kathy said high and Tiny came over and took are order. I got the smothered chicken, greens and mashed potatoes n' gravy. My girl got ox tails, somebody got the catfish and I forgot what every body else ordered ( it was six months ago and there were five of us so I refuse to remember all the details.) It took about 30-45 minute's for all our food to hit the table witch is quite a wait but there cooking the food to order which is all cool with me, ill practice a little patience. When  Tiny did come with the plates it was evident that it was worth the wait. My smothered chicken was hot, fresh, and the gravy was thick enough and flavorfully but didn't make the chicken too soggy. I had two wings and a breast and they were all moist on the inside, no dry choking hazard white meat here. The greens were good, perfectly seasoned, made me wish I had some pepper juice ( its a down south thing when they get some peppers put them in a jar with what I think is vinegar and let it sit on a shelf for a couple weeks, its bomb on greens ) I could tell the mashed potatoes were made from real mashed potatoes, and that brown gravy on top was no joke. My whole meal was delicious in every meaning of the word. I pressed my girl for some of her ox tails and they were delicious as well, tender, nice size and flavor on point. The food gets my praise, yeah it might be a little pricey but its money well spent. The staff is hella' cool, it feels like I'm just going to the homies moms house for a plate. Kathy's kitchen is were its at bottom line."}
{"text":"Have to completely disagree with the first reviewer -- as a Southerner, this place is an insult -- a total sham -- 1) it's FILTHY  2) it's FILTHY and 3) it's totally overpriced...oh did I mention how dirty the joint is?

Took some Southern co-workers all the way from UNLV for lunch -- won't do that EVER again.  The wait was 20 minutes for the gal to step out from behind a counter to bring us a menu... we were the only ones there....!    Hello?  

The menus were sticky -- the place smelled bad -- they had cleaning chemicals out on the same counters where they serve food -- finally put them away about midway through lunch service.

We were hoping for something authentic lunch-wise -- like a \"meat and 3\" plate -- in the South, it's easy to find about 20 mom and pops that offer this for oh, anywhere from $3 inclusive of tea and pie (!) -- to $6 (for a fancy joint) where tea and pie are extra...

No meat & 3 here (all a la carte) -- so to replicate that, we're talking you're in for $20+ easy for lunch... I'm serious.  

Bad fried chicken, bad mac & cheese, bad greens, bad canned beans, bad bad bad... tea that was so sweet my teeth still hurt.

Shame on you, Kathy -- real Southeners know better...I would love to bring my Mama here when she's feeling homesick -- but this will just make her sick... and break her heart...this place truly has no soul.

To add insult to injury, when it was time to pay the check, they have this ancient system that charges a set amount -- plus a service charge to run your card... it's such a scam. 

I really wanted to love this place -- as it stands now, it's probably tops on my list of places that I'll NEVER give a 2nd shot... Hope this saves you a trip!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yummy, yum, yum!

Yeah, that about sums it up when it comes to Kathy's Southern Cooking.  

I was hanging out at my mom's and we wanted something different for lunch.  Enter Yelp and it's awesome suggestions, which is how we found out about Kathy's Southern Cooking.  After seeing the pictures of the food, I knew we had to get there right away!

We went for a lunch on a Saturday and were the only ones in the place.  At first I was a little worried because I was hoping we didn't make a mistake in going to Kathy's.  Then I got my glass of sweet tea and I knew we had made the right choice.  A great southern cooking place has to have great sweet tea, otherwise what's the point?  It turned out to be a treat to have the place to ourselves because 1. my toddler daughter wouldn't bother anyone, and 2. the lady working the counter (sadly, I can't remember her name) was a doll and we had so much fun chit-chatting with her through our time there.  She really made our experience great from her lovely personality and excellent service.

Now to the important part.....The food!  We are a southern family and wanted some of our go-to comfort foods, fried chicken and fried catfish.    The fried chicken was just like the chicken we used to get in Tennessee at my grandma's dinner table.  The catfish tasted like the catfish from Mississippi and my childhood.  My mom swears that the catfish is the best she has eaten outside of the South.  I can't argue with that statement because it was YUMMY.  

We also ordered the mashed potatoes, mac n' cheese, red beans & rice, and fries as side items.  Everything was amazing! The highlights had to be the real mashed potatoes with gravy made to order and the gooey mac n' cheese.  Everything was good, but those were both REALLY good.

We finished our meal with Banana Pudding.  It was delicious!  My mom decided she is never making banana pudding again and will just order it from Kathy's from here on out.  I'm ok with that.  I just want my banana pudding please!"}
{"text":"Fried chicken, greens, black eyed peas, smothered pork chops...I could go on and on.  When we lived in Las vegas this was a staple!  They have since moved but we found them on our most recent trip back to Vegas.  The location is fine as was the other one.  This one has easier parking.  

The food is still the same...perefect.  This is exactly what I wasnt and expect when I go looking for southern cooking.  I don't go looking for decor or ambience; I want good comfort food.  The service is always fantastic as these are real people.

Great place, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I needed to get my fried catfish fix, and boy did they sure deliver, catfish was seasoned and cooked to perfection, I got Mac n cheese and greens as my side, and lemme tell you it felt like I was eating at momo's house for Sunday dinner"}
{"text":"I have eaten here since they were located on Mountain Vista and Sunset. Never disapointed but I really wish they offered unsweetened tea. I dont do sweet tea or carbonated drinks so I am usually stuck with water. I almost always get the fried chicken. OMG it rocks!!"}
{"text":"Are you kidding me????!! This placed SUCKED big time, I ordered the Gumbo with crab and a side of greens with sweet tea.  The gumbo was the consistency of dish water and they had the nerve to serve it with old rice (You know when it is kind of crispy) I will never return there ever, the servers were more interested in watching the basket ball game on TV than they were in their 3 customers.  I never did get my side of greens, but I paid for them because I was in such a hurry to get the heck out of there.  Save your money it cost me 40 dollars to learn this hard lesson!"}
{"text":"The best fried chicken in town seems to be KFC...Kathy's Fried Chicken, that is, of Kathy's Southern Cooking.  The fried chicken dinner is $11.75 and gets you three pieces of chicken, corn bread, and two sides.  Sides were decent, corn bread was good, but the chicken absolutely steals the show.

Service is casual but super friendly.  Food is made fresh to order, so be prepared for a bit of a wait; our party of eight was there for 2-3 hours.  For fried chicken!  It's so worth it though.  The breading is not too heavy, is cooked to that perfect golden brown, spiced just right, and encapsulates a perfectly cooked, juicy piece of chicken.  My friends are now no longer allowed to recommend fried chicken to me, unless they've tried Kathy's."}
{"text":"Went to Kathy's today and was excited to find out they had the chicken fried steak.  It was fantastic, which is why I'm bumping Kathy's up to 5 stars.  The steak is large, you will likely have leftovers, but it's doable.  Like all the other dinners, it comes with 2 sides and a large corn muffin.  Great deal.  The steak was tender and crispy.  The crust adhered well to the steak, which is ideal.  The white gravy was peppery and creamy.  I was not surprised given how much we like the brown gravy.  Once again, Kathy's more than delivered.  If you are on the east side and hungry, absolutely hit up Kathy's."}
{"text":"I was glad to see Kathy's had closed because I have NEVER eaten in a dirtier place.  Sure, the food was okay, but afterwards I was just waiting for the impending food poisoning.  It was only by the sweet, merciful grace of God that I didn't contract something from this place.  I hope the new location on Desert Inn is cleaner!"}
{"text":"Ignoring such negative comments below.  They just don't know what they're talking about.  But the others, just like myself... We love love love the food at Kathy's  It's great food, plain and simple.  Go check it out for yourself!  Easy as that!  I guarantee you'll love it!"}
{"text":"My suggestion to anyone who's reading this.  (In spite of all the haters and the negative comments!)  Why don't you go to the restaurant, and find out for your self how the food is.  The new location is on 3799 E Desert Inn Rd, Las Vegas, NV 89121.  For me, the food was excellent!  Who cares about the decor or atmosphere.  These are hard times!  I'm there for the food, not the decor.  The staff there are very friendly, and very courteous.  I am definitely going back there, and try out the rest of the menu!  After I had my lunch there today, my soul was SATISFIED!  Amen."}
{"text":"Kathy's Southern Cooking has the best chicken fried steak ever!!!
I challenge anyone to find any restaurant in town with better chicken 
fried steak.  I am a soul-food connoisseur and this is the real deal!"}
{"text":"After a morning of fun, Sylvia Q suggested that our group should go to Kathy's. At first I was thinking she was talking about going to my place to eat leftovers from Thanksgiving. Oops!

I really wanted to try the chicken but Sylvia said the ribs here are good too. What a dilemma! Good thing I was able to negotiate with a good friend for us to share the chicken dinner and the ribs dinner...the best of both worlds. Then there was a debate as to what sides to get then my tastebuds told me I should have fried pork chop instead. After all that, I got so thirsty for some sweet tea. The dinners come with 2 sides and cornbread for $11-19.

Despite the starvation, we were laughing and telling jokes the whole time we were there until the food came. The whole restaurant got quiet quick. The food was THAT amazing.

Cornbread:
There's not too many places that wowed me with their cornbread. It's up to you to put butter and honey on your cornbread. It was cornbread...nothing unusual. 3/5

Mac n Cheese:
I dislike runny and soupy mac n cheese. Kathy's wasn't. It was thick, creamy and the cheese sticks to the macaroni. 4/5

Mashed Potatoes and Gravy:
Made with real potatoes. You'll come across some bits of potatoes. The gravy was pretty tasty. 4/5

Ribs:
This is the wet saucy kind and not the dry-rub kind of ribs. A little spicy and a little sweet. The meat was easy to get off the bone with my fork and knife. 3.5/5

Fried Chicken:
You get 3 pieces of breaded and fried chicken. They're not heavily-breaded and are seasoned well. No salmonella-scare here either as each piece is cooked to perfection until the breading/skin turns golden brown. You get a leg, thigh and breast. The skin...oh my! I had to close my eyes and savor how good it was. 5/5

The food is made fresh and you can tell that it was made as if they were feeding their own family. So, the food takes a while. You don't rush good things.

Tuesday to Friday you can get their fried chicken sandwich until 5pm but on any day you can get fried catfish, fried pork chop, hotlinks or BBQ spareribs. The dinners are fried catfish, fried chicken, smothered pork chop, fried pork chop, smothered chicken, oxtails, chitterlings, meatloaf, chicken fried steak, shrimp etouffe or gumbo. The sides you can choose from are cabbage, mashed potatoes, mac n cheese, black eyed peas, rice, coleslaw, red beans, fries, potato salad or peas. They have family meals with 16 pieces of chicken and sides to-go only. They have chicken fingers. For dessert they have banana pudding, peach cobbler and sweet potato pie."}
{"text":"This is based solely on their fried chicken, which I happened to be craving (thank you top chef), and as they are close by to us it was either here or KFC.

Well we decided to try here for the chicken and honestly, it was good, the wife loved it, I was more than happy wife it, the skin did not have that little kick that I like, but the meat was perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"The food was somewhat above average in soul food starved Las Vegas, but the restaurant was as if they felt their food was so good nothing else mattered. 

The food.  Fried chicken, greens and potato salad.  The chicken was pretty good.  One big breast and 2 wings.  Crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  The chicken didn't seem to have any seasonings on it other than salt.  Of course I drenched it in hot sauce so it tasted all right.  The greens were good - salty - but good.  Potato salad was just fine.  The food was pretty decent - not knock it out of the park good, but decent.

The place has ultra bright white walls decorated with a cluster of c-list black celebrities pictures that have been autographed. (except for Iron Mike, A-lister).  There were six oddly aligned tables.  The dining area is stark and completely uninviting.  The reception area at Terrible Herbst  oil change place is nicer than this.  Definitely not a place you want to sit down and have dinner.

It has a huge counter that takes up half the dining area and the rest is a rather large open kitchen.  An open kitchen looks cool sometimes, but if it looks like crap then its not a good idea.  So, there is a huge room with a tiny dining area, large counter and huge open   run down kitchen.

One thing that bothered me was the worker eating his dinner at the counter.  I know people got to eat, but he just left his chicken bones there.  It just seems unprofessional.

The service was okay.  Not warm and inviting but it was okay.

Of course everyone has their own opinions, but there is one thing we can all agree on... do not enter the bathrooms.  Luckily, I went when I was done eating.  The smell of backed up sewer almost knocked me on my ass when I opened the door!  Grosssss!!!!  I literally had to hold my breath.  Call a plumber and have him clean your drains!

Okay food - everything else... fail.

You just get the vibe that the owners don't care - so why should I care?"}
{"text":"The service was friendly..
The food is fairly overpriced and should be  updated on yelp.
Walked in there were 4 guest in the resturant still took us 30-45 mins to get our food then 20 more minutes to get the check 

Food: catfish dinner with yams, greens, and cornbread

My friend had the smothered pork chops with mac n cheese and rice the pork chops where decent but the mac n cheese again NO FLAVOR.
how does a soul food restaurant have no flavor maybe my expectations of this place was too high

Catfish was the only thing slightly good, ill pass on Kathy's I drove across to town to get here and it wasnt good @ all"}
{"text":"All I can say is the service and food here are absolutely implacable. I ordered three meals for three people, carry out. The hot link & fries, catfish dinner w/greens and yams, and the fried chicken dinner w/yams and red beans & rice.  The staff and cooks REALLY believe in turning out an excellent product here. The store is clean and for soul food, they stand head and shoulders above any Las Vegas restaurant I've ever been to. 

My food all ended up being shared by my family because everything was so good, we all had to sample each others! My only disappointment was that I did not get my greens, but I received a very tasty macaroni and cheese instead. The mistake however is bitter sweet though, because I get to go back and eat here again. 

If you are from a different place and craving your hometown's soul food cooking, I urge you to go see Kathy's Southern Cooking...you won't be disappointed."}
