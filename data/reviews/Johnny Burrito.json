{"text":"Great service, a nice alternative for lunches in uptown. The owner is so helpful and friendly, gives great suggestions for mixing and matching proteins or sauces. Place can get packed for lunch."}
{"text":"Friendly service, fresh and delicious food -- A truly local and consistently excellent establishment!"}
{"text":"VEGAN OPTIONS!  I eat here often since I can get whole wheat and vegan options!  Johnny - Add whole grain brown rice please!  Go here if you want create your own amazing burrito with fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"Wade through the Atrium at the Wachovia building and head down the escalator.  Hang a right and you will see the line for Johnny's Burritos.  Even after 1:00 on a Friday the line was still out the door.  However, the line moves quickly and at the end of the burrito building process you walk away with your own custom burrito (or salad).  On my first visit Johnny started my veggie burrito order followed by 'regular size'?  After sizing up his customer.  He then went on to give me a cinnamon jaw breaker for Fireball Friday and explained that my take away bag would contain napkins and gum and that I should peel the foil and eat as I go.  After some encouragement that the first time was the hardest, I was on my way down the line.  You can finish your meal in the heat/air conditioning of the atrium for some extra people watching or on a nice day sit outside in the court yard in the sun or shade.  You can't beat that with a yummy burrito stuffed just the way you like it.  At the very least, you have to envy this guy for his enthusiasm and creativity."}
{"text":"Still waiting on JB to reach out after I was overcharged for using a credit card. Not a word in 5 months. That said, the menu has been updated since my review. Everything is about $.50 more expensive and JB is offering a $.50 cash discount.  https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=MoVAiPgONz2vSae4ffzCOA"}
{"text":"I always just do a veggie burrito and it's great. They have a large selection of meats as well but their black beans are really good.   All of their veggies and add ins are fresh and plentiful. You can also get a \"burrito\" salad if you don't want the tortilla.   Also don't be scared if you see a long line. They move everybody along pretty quickly and you'll be out of there fast.   Finally be sure to check out their selection of bottled colas and drinks. Try the Uncle Scott's root beer if they have it.   When they have tamales they are worth a try as well. Not the best I've ever had but there aren't many places to get tamales in Charlotte much less uptown Charlotte."}
{"text":"I am from southern California and have been eating Mexican food my whole life. A coworker suggested I try the place as I had only 10 min to grab lunch. I was apprehensive as us Californians are used to amazing Mexican food. I went in and was immediately greeted by the owner. He stated that he had been to California prior to setting up the restaurant to research and master the cuisine. I got a regular burrito with spicy pork, black beans, rice, and lots of yummy toppings. They had the best spicy pork I have had and also a large variety of other meats cut just like in Mexico! They also had hundreds of hot sauces, fresh cut jalapenos, a staff that seemed very happy and helpful, and shared that they have home made tamales on Tuesday and Friday. Yummmmmmmm! They also give you chiclets gum in the bag when you leave!! Just like Mexicoooo! I am very impressed by this restaurant and will go back for sureeeeeeeee! Thanks for a great meal!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and the food is great, very similar to Moe's (or) Salsarita's but we can get many varieties of hot sauces that you can choose in a small container.  However, I am a big fan of this restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for lunch when I work downtown.  I like to eat healthily for lunch so I don't feel like I'm in a food coma after, and they have many healthy options.    Also, you feel like you're walking into a friend's kitchen to grab lunch with the chatter going on. You get to pick all of your (probably 20 different ingredients) for your salad or burrito and... Bonus:  they have Twizzler Tuesday's, free chicklets (old school - love it!) etc. - that stuff cracks me up.    The ingredients you can build for your burrito, salad, etc. are fresh and delicious.  Love this place and everyone who works here!"}
{"text":"I'm a firm believer of rating business in the context of why you are going there. I typically come here for a quick lunch spot and it is by far one of my favorite places  - Food is fantastic and local and everything you could ask for. Spicy chicken burrito with great guac and the famous El Diablo sauce. So so so good. There is also such a variety of sides it's amazing. A cooler full of non fountain specialty drinks? A rack full of snacks etc. You can buy a Moonpie here!?! Love it. - The story behind the burrito shop is amazing. Google it and look it up. - The decor is more unique than any other place in Uptown - Johnny is a character and will greet you at the cash register. You've probably heard. He likes cash, but he will still sell you a burrito if you don't have any.   Highly highly recommended!"}
{"text":"A fun, unique, friendly place to get great food. Try the Sundrop icee! Don't miss it!"}
{"text":"I miss Phat Burrito but Johnny B has been consistently great for years."}
{"text":"One of the most unique places for lunch uptown! The portion sizes are HUGE! I loved that I could load up my nachos or burrito with any toppings for no additional charge! They also give out twizzlers on Tuesdays and chicklets with every order. They have thought of everything you could need to enjoy a Mexican lunch! I also love the vibe of the restaurant because they aren't trying to be anything fancy, it makes you much more comfortable when you walk in the doors!"}
{"text":"This place is so delicious and you get the best bang for your buck since you can add any toppings with no additional charge.  Service is fantastic as well!"}
{"text":"I always forget about Johnny Burrito, its tucked away in the wachovia atrium building where its not front of mind. But when I do remember I am very excited to go there!  The food here is pretty good. I usu sally get the salad (with chips and lettuce). They have very fresh ingredients to top your burritos and salads. It is a little more expensive than salsariats and qdoba but you get more food for your money and you are helping a small business by going here!  The line looks so long but as others have said it's fast moving! It's another great place when you want to change it up with your lunch options!"}
{"text":"Massive portions, free guac/mushrooms and other usually pay per ingredients, and very fast once you get through the line. And there is usually a line during the week. Really good stuff"}
{"text":"Great burritos, I don't think I can say anything not said elsewhere in the reviews. The only thing keeping it from a five star is that their hot is clearly \"white guy hot\". I haven't had anything approaching what I would consider moderate heat. Quality of burrito and the customer service is on point though (despite the somewhat odd pressure for cash while taking space in banking central).  Overall, my favorite lunch spot when visiting Charlotte"}
{"text":"The burritos are some of the best in Charlotte. However the owner who takes the money at the register has issues. I'm not sure what his deal is but he's very rude and obnoxious every time. Also if you don't pay in cash he gets pissed off and will make a scene. Tip for the owner: times have changed not everyone carries cash these days anymore just so you can save .25 on processing fees from a credit card."}
{"text":"Got the regular size steak burrito with queso, guac, sour cream, cheese, salsa and beans. Awesome! Lucky to have found this gem on my visit to Charlotte."}
{"text":"My boyfriend works uptown so I occasionally meet him for lunch, this time he chose Johnny Burritos.  They instantly could tell I was a newbie (I must have had a took of confusion)  They were super friendly and helpful.    I had the Chicken Verde burrito which was tasty but missing the kick you'd expect with a salsa verde. It's insanely fast and the regular isn't so huge that you can't reasonably finish it, it's not a behemoth like Chipotle's.  You can mix and match all kinds of ingredients to get the burrito you so crave. I think they also change up the base meats and they have a tamale friday special.  and as a plus, guac isn't extra!    It's a tad gimicky, they hand out fireball candies on fridays and you get chicket gum with every order and newbies get a bottle opener.    They also have a great selection of old school sodas and a sun drop slushie."}
{"text":"I think of this place as more like Meh, OK instead of A-OK  Needed a quick lunch-grab to get back to a meeting so coworker suggested Johnny Burrito.  Initially thinking we'll never make it as I see the line out the door but boy, does it move fast  Coworker had his usual chicken burrito & said it was the usual yumminess he expects  I had the veggie burrito & it was super bland.  It was absolutely ginormous & filling as all get out, but no real flavor.  There's a huge assembly line of various beans, cheeses, veggies & other fillings you can include so at the end of the day, you've no one to blame for your combo-satisfaction but yourself  No chips included  Don't forget to ask for LOTS of hot sauce"}
{"text":"Second time there today. This burrito is amazing. The meat is so flavorful and ingredients fresh. The guy at the cashier (assuming the owner?) is the friendliest person serving lunch uptown."}
{"text":"This place is overrated. The food is no better then the other burrito places in uptown. I guess the private ownership and legacy reputation leads people to give it more credit than it deserves. You also get lip from the owner if you want to pay credit."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today and it was a great experience. We got there a little before 1pm. There was a line, but it wasn't bad. The line does move pretty quickly. If you pay with cash, you save $0.50 since they don't have to pay for the credit card processing fee.  After reading the reviews on here, I made sure I studied the menu so I am ready to order lol I mentioned that it was my first time there, and Johnny kindly explained how everything works and even passed along the rookie card so I can take my time ordering. I thought that was a nice touch! I also got a little souvenir (a key chain). Everyone there were super nice and friendly.  I got a regular taco salad with combo meat (chicken and steak). You have the option of lettuce, spinach or both. I opt for both, and without chips. I like that spinach is an option because most Mexican places offer lettuce only which has no nutritional value. From there, you get to pick as many toppings as you want. No extra charge for queso or guacamole. I got a little of both rice and black beans, mushrooms, zucchini & squash, queso, guac and mild salsa. My lunch was absolutely delicious! I will definitely be back when I am in town again. Less than $11 for a nice filling lunch with lots of protein, you can't beat that! Oh they always give you gum with the order. Next time, I know to order a medium salad instead of regular because that was too much food for me."}
{"text":"First place my coworkers took me for lunch after moving to Charlotte. I will be back often!"}
{"text":"This is the best burrito in Charlotte in my opinion.  I have been to Phat Burrito too and was unimpressed.  They have more meat selections than your typical Moe's, Chipotle, Qdoba, etc.  They load the burrito up with toppings and they don't charge extra for guac (YES!!).  The hot sauces they have are HOT and I love it!  It sucks this place is uptown or else I would be a regular."}
{"text":"Best burritos in Charlotte!   By far my favorite burrito place in Charlotte. Don't let the long line deceive you - it moves fast and is totally worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I SO miss working downtown & enjoying the ever so delightful Johnny Burrito! Their burritos are so delicious...but it is filling. (c) Ron Burgandy.  The regular size burrito is the way to go! Picadillo (spicy beef), lettuce, tomato, pico de gallo & cilantro is my weapon of choice. The chips are always fresh & have just the right amount of crunch, but again...you have to be pretty hungry to eat the burrito & chips!  Mind you the space is small & there will be a line at lunchtime.  However, the line moves quickly as long as you know what you want prior to placing your order.  Think of it as a \"Subway\" or \"Quiznos\" type of order.  I defintely put Johnny's up against Moe's, Qdoba, or Salsarita's. Not to mention, you're supporting a small business owner!"}
{"text":"I felt compelled to give this place 5 stars because there are a bunch of \"reviewers\" giving it lesser stars for the dumbest reason.  Sorry, they don't have shrimp burritos.  Sorry, this isn't a sit down resturant.  Its a take out place.  This doesn't take away from the fact that this place makes the best burritos I've ever had.  It is all fresh ingrediants.  It is a fantastic place for lunch.    BTW have a brain when you write a review on here."}
{"text":"Amazing customer service !! the staffs are super friendly ! They have 2 sizes of burritos,regular or large and you can choose white,whole wheat or spinach tortillas. I had the regular burrito with spinach tortillas and fire cracker chicken. They also have a diablo sauce for spicy lovers! It is savory and spot on !  The burrito is delicioso! The ingredients are very fresh unlike the franchise places.  Awesome experience can't wait to go back !!!"}
{"text":"My favorite lunch spot. Always some great meat selections, friendly staff... and of course, Johnny himself. It's not mexican cuisine, it's just a damn good burrito."}
{"text":"Best burrito in Charlotte.  Easily outclasses qdoba or chiptole.  Haberno salsa is perfect blend of heat & flavor.  Chic-let gum with every order.  Favorite lunch spot uptown Charlotte."}
{"text":"You cannot do better than Johnny Burrito for good food, fast!   Owner, Johnny Bitten, is a WONDERFUL man and his employees have been there for as long as I can recall and they always seem happy. He has a lot of choices and they are not skimpy with toppings.   I only have one check in here--I need to get better about that--but I eat here several times a month and am quick to recommend it to anyone new in my office.   The line might look long, but they are SUPER QUICK!   You can take it upstairs to the seating either in the Atrium or outside by the fountains as there is no seating at the actual shop, which I consider a plus!"}
{"text":"Great food, great people, solid prices. The burritos that are on special are always on point. Make sure to get a side of their hot sauce!"}
{"text":"I stopped in randomly for lunch the other day and it was great. there was a longer line but thought it must be worth it.  the line moved pretty fast due to the guy behind the register.  he moved the line along with speed and not at the expense of the customer.  funny guy.  the burrito was perfect and delicious.  I will visit Johnny Burrito often when i buy lunch in town."}
{"text":"With being in the basement of the Watch-Ova-Ya/Hells-Fargone atrium, I feel like JB is the best unkept secret in Uptown Charlotte.  They have been around forever and a day as the yellowed newspaper articles smattered across the walls will tell you.  As will the \"best burrito in Charlotte - 1999\" award.  Nothing recently?  The wait can be hit or miss to get grub from JB's, and if it is hit, you have a little of a wait.  I have seen it stretch almost back to the escalators before.  The easiest thing is to get a regular (pronounced reg-OO-lar with a tinge of spanish accent).  The steak is nicely cooked and the chicken is good as well.  Their guac is muy chunky and not too shabby.  The rest of the ingredients run along burrito standards.  You can either do one of the tasty cream sodas or birch/root beers or hit the fountain for washing down your meal.  Its just a quick take out, allowing you to find seating upstairs, outside, or back at the office.  In and out in only a few minutes with a $7 regular that has knockoff chicklets in the bag to take care of post lunch breath.  Oh, and they offer beano at the register to take care of any other olfactory offense you might commit later on..."}
{"text":"First time at Johnny Burrito today.. all of my coworkers were right! Do not let the long line deter you, it moves quickly and it is well worth the wait. For less than 10$ (.50 cent discount for paying with cash) you can get a burrito with relatively unlimited toppings. I went bold with the special chicken of the day in a tomatillo sauce (sort of like slow cooker chicken) and LOTS of toppings including guac. I was lucky to visit on a day when Johnny himself was working the register and he guided me through with a personal touch you don't get anywhere else. WOW. I will be back soon."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time today since we just moved offices downtown and I was blown away! Incredible burrito and extremely friendly staff. I've never been to a burrito spot that can make it as specifically spicy as I like it and they nailed it. Nothing bland about the food here.. create whatever you want and as spicy as you like. Great experience and will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Worth waiting in the line (which does move quickly). You go along the line & tell the preparer what you want in your burrito. Excellent every time. No seating, but there is open seating in the WF atrium above."}
{"text":"Decent food...but pricey. After being asked to bring cash next time, when paying with a credit card....ill pass the next time. I'll take my $ and my appetite somewhere else."}
{"text":"Solid mission burrito spot tucked away in hard to find spot in uptown Charlotte.  Got be here for a while before you here about it, but its definitely a great burrito that uses fresh ingredients.  Best part is that you can build your burrito exactly the way you want it and no BS $2 uncharge for Guac. They also have a great selection of bottled drinks including Mexican Coke and Orangina, which aren't available everywhere.  Reasonable prices and they prefer cash, but don't let them pressure you into it.  They will take your money any way got it.  I intend on being back at least once a month."}
{"text":"Felt compelled to write a quick review after having a phenomenal burrito here today. I've been going here for about three years and had some fine meals, but today was over the top.   I usually get the regular size, but this time went for the big, along with the spicy chicken in green chile sauce. Since I was in a hurry, I just told them to load it with \"everything\". That included, rice, black beans, three kinds of salsa, cilantro, onions, sour cream, guac, chopped jalapenos, lettuce, and tomato - it was monstrously large! Still not sure how they wrapped it but they did.   The taste was perfect - spicy, smooth, crunchy, warm. A lot of different flavors that together were a symphony in my mouth! Utterly and totally hit the spot. Added bonus - local place with local owners just putting out great product.   Thumbs up Johnny B's!"}
{"text":"I have worked Uptown off and on for about six years and it wasn't until December of last year that I finally made my way here. I was always intimidated by the long line and seemingly sparse ordering details on the way to the cashier. First off, don't be intimidated. The line moves quickly and the folks at the register (often the owner I'm told) are super friendly and love first timers. Second, best burrito in Charlotte? Yeah, I'd put it up there. I've NEVER been disappointed with the taste, quality or portion size. I haven't tried the tamales yet but I've been told by others who have been there that they are 100% worth branching out and there is a reason they are usually sold out by 1-1:30. I think they serve them on Tuesdays and one other day. Good news is, I'll be back to find out for myself. this now on regular lunch rotation."}
{"text":"I am usually not a huge fan of burritos since they give me heartburn everytime I eat it. Decided to give this joint a try and was pleasantly surprised. It took us some effort to try and find this place and it is definitely a hole in the wall type of place. The owner who was behind the cash register was very friendly and could tell right away that it was our first time there. I initially wanted to get the steak but they looked really dry and did not look very appetizing. I tried the spicy beef instead and loaded it with pico de gallo, guac, garlic mushrooms, rice, and cilantro on a whole wheat tortilla. The end result was absolutely delicious. The beef was juicy and flavorful with a nice kick to it. Everything meshed really well and there was just so much flavor to it all. It was indeed sloppy to eat so I highly recommend asking for a plate and getting a knife and fork to dive into it. The chips and guac are also dirt cheap and makes for a nice afternoon snack. I would definitely come back again, service was friendly and quick and you simply cannot beat the price for the amount of food you get. An added bonus was that I didn't get heartburn this time!"}
{"text":"Johnny's is still great after all of these years. The line can be long, but it moves very quickly. My favorite are the tamales on Tuesdays and Fridays. Johnny and his staff are super-friendly. You can tell he treats them right because many of them have been there for years, I work at the other end of Tryon St. from his building, and I walk by at least two of the chain burrito places to go to Johnny's."}
{"text":"First off thank you Yelp for finding this place for me 4 and 1/2 stars with about 80 reviews I am so sold love Johnny met the owner he's a stud great food great atmosphere good energy thank you again made my day I'm from Vegas and when I'm back in town I'm coming right here thanks again guys!"}
{"text":"\"Regular por favor\" has become a phrase we here often after moving into the Wells Fargo 2 building.  Johnny Burrito definitely does it right in terms of customer service, burritos, and style.  How many restaurants can move a line of 30 in 10 minutes?  I also like the fact that \"You're the boss for the next 8 feet\".  This place is amazing.  More or less, you determine the amount of toppings on your burrito.  Even the salads are filling if you prefer a healthier meal.  Free refills until close."}
{"text":"4 food. 5 service.   Pork & Chicken: regular on wheat Black olives, cilantro, sc, guac, cheese, hot salsa.   Good, but sloppy to eat. It was a while back & it didn't stick out to me enough to remember more than that..."}
{"text":"A little expensive but first class customer service and fresh veggies and food all the way around.  Very personalized and very fast.  This is hands down the best burrito place in Charlotte and I am a burrito aficionado.  Sorry, but Phat Burrito has nothing on this unique dining experience."}
{"text":"There is no better burrito place in the city.  The portion sizes for your money are outstanding, and the customer service is consistently the best I've ever had.  I go a few times each week...I have for a few years now, and I have never grown tired of it."}
{"text":"Lots of food, great vibe, and can pack as much as you want into the burrito. The chicken was good, but they don't have very many meat options. Additionally, grilling the burrito would bring it to the next level. That said, definitely recommend the spot for the best quick burrito uptown."}
{"text":"The spot was a bit difficult to find so I ended up asking a guard in the Wells Fargo building where the restaurant is located on the bottom floor. There was a very long line that moved pretty quickly. As a first time customer the owner, who was working the register, greeted me acknowledging I was a new face and gave me a little gift as a welcome. I chose the smallest burrito which was still pretty large filled with lots of fresh and tasty ingredients. I definitely plan on going back to try the nachos and tamales (served on Tuesday and Friday)."}
{"text":"First of all, I love burritos. And anything that tastes authentic it's even better.   Johnny's Burrito is always crowded. Line out the door, but there isn't really a large inside area anyways. Atmosphere is very eclectic and original. Option for your burrito are endless, all meats and add ons you could think of. the meat isn't anything to rave about, kind of bland. But their guacamole is pretty tasty. You can get everything on your burrito wrapped or in a box. However, with all the options available and on your burrito, the tortilla doesn't stay together.   I would likely visit again as it's convenient downtown, but it wouldn't be my #1 on the list."}
{"text":"I've hit up Johnny Burrito's for lunch a few times in the past but I've never been a big burrito fan. I'm not sure what was different today but my regular size, ground beef burrito was damn good.  I threw in a $.46 moon pie to top off the lunch.  We could have started a new trend, \"Burrito Monday\" in our office."}
{"text":"Great little lunch spot for the uptown crowd. Quick and painless. If you pay with cash you save .50. The owner at the cash register can tell if you are new and warmly welcomes and explains the situation to you.   I got the mini taco salad on lettuce with the spicy chicken. It wasn't too spicy for me. I also loaded up on the veggies and got the diablo on the side. Everything is fresh and they speak Spanglish. I love it.   There wasn't a line when I went around 1:30. I always go late to beat the crowds.  They also offer complimentary beano because, well gas and acid reflux is not fun"}
{"text":"Tasty, tasty burritos with super friendly service and a great soda selection. The grilled veggies are spot-on. Johnny is always around to make sure you are having a great experience."}
{"text":"I really want to love Johnny Burrito. I really do. I love Mexican food and I love burrito bowls and I love leaving my cube to go out to lunch in Uptown. But something about Johnny B's is just a little bit lacking.  The customer service is awesome. Lord only knows how that guy remembers every single person he's ever waited on. I don't get it. Nobody gets it. It's part of the mystique and wonder of going to Johnny B's; marveling at how the guy at the register remembers your face and how often you've been there.  I love the concept of paying before ordering. It frees you up to order what looks good in the moment. You've already paid, so when you see someone coming out of the back kitchen with a fresh vat of steaming queso, you can be a total glutton and ask for extra. You've already paid. It's pretty awesome.  The glitch in this system - what if I decide that I'm going to be healthy that day and go easy on toppings/burrito fillings? I've already paid $11+ for my burrito bowl, which is PRICEY. In comparison, a Chipotle burrito bowl is about $7, and only slightly smaller.  Another gripe? I want some free chips. Moe's has conditioned me to expect delicious, salty, warm tortilla chips with my burrito bowl. I always miss those when I pick Johnny B's.   Ingredients are fresh, tasty, and it's always served with a smile, but I can't say that Johnny B's is my favorite Mexican lunch around. Still glad to have it in the work-hood, and there's a line out the door everyday, so my 3-star review (hopefully) isn't hurting their business!"}
{"text":"Hands down best burrito in town. They don't charge extra for guac and queso like the bigger chains. Best well known secret in Charlotte$"}
{"text":"Not only do I love the food here, I'm impressed at Johnny's ability to compete with the big chains.  It's not uncommon for there to be a line out the door at this place during lunch time.  Varied meat choices, great toppings, local produce, and a great bang for the buck are just a few reasons to come here.   The grande burrito is massive, and a good deal for the price.  The regular sized is nothing to take lightly though.  Although Johnny doesn't provide as many toppings as Moe's, the quality and taste of the meat is comparable, if not better.  It's definitely better than Salsarita's and Qdoba in every way.    I do wish there was more of an effort to offer some more natural, organic, and whole grain options in the meat, toppings, and tortillas.  Chipotle and Moe's offer this, so if Johnny wants to make sure the new Moe's in the epicentre doesn't steal his business, he may need to adjust his ingredient options a little.  But overall, I love this place and have it on a 1-2 times a month rotation.  I like supporting the small business owner, especially one that can offer a legitimate product that can compete."}
{"text":"Hidden below the Wells Fargo building but I love this place.  I always get the chicken burrito bowl.  You pay upfront and then add all the toppings you want.  You don't have to pay extra for guac so I love that. They will also put chips at the bottom for you.  It goes 1. Johnny Burrito. 2. Chipotle. 3. Qdoba. 4. If I must, salsaritas - terrible."}
{"text":"Try to make it there at exactly 12! However the long line moves fairly quickly. The burritos are HUGE and so filling. The menu it straightforward and they don't charge extra for quest and guacamole (yaaaas)."}
{"text":"How bossy are you?  Sorry, let me be more diplomatic: how particular and assertive are you?  Johnny Burrito is as great, good, or indifferent as you make it.  Johnny is friendly and he empowers you with positive motivation that you are deciding your lunch fate.  The stakes aren't that high, you will be full and satisfied in either case, but if you want to be delighted then that is on you.  To be clear - if you want more guacamole then ask for more guacamole, if they still didn't give you enough then ask for some more again.  Don't be timid, be as bold as the flavors you want.  If holding up the line is too much anxiety for you then this might not be the best fit for you.  The sauces, cheeses, and other toppings don't get spread evenly by default.  They will put a dab here or there, and stack some toppings in a single spot.  You can either ask for more and that they distribute them evenly, or you can do it yourself later.  The flavor is satisfying, but not overly ambitious.  This is just fast fresh food that should appeal to most everyone.  I keep hearing from people how I needed to try this place so I did.  I don't regret it.  This is a small lunch counter and seating is available throughout the general area but none inside the actual restaurant.  If you have ever had Mexican food you will know what is to be expected.  I recommend the salad, it costs a bit more but you can really get in there and load up on toppings."}
{"text":"There's some caveats to this 4 star review so let's air them out. I'm a californian and burritos are an incredibly vital part of my diet. Johnny burrito does not make burritos that would compare to any actual taquerias at home, or in charlotte for that matter.  Still as a workday lunch that doesn't allow for a drive up N Tryon to to Plaza Midwood, Johnny Burrito can still hit the spot. The staff is also super nice and it's great they don't nickel and dime you for guac and the like.   Authentic, no. Good workday lunch? Sure."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Tried Johny's Burritos for lunch one day since everyone (local) seems to rave about this place... and the queues are rather crazy I must say. Johnny's is a tiny shop and the queues often extend way long outside.  Unfortunately, they don't serve shrimp so I would opt for the pulled pork burritos. We will often do a group order and get a chulala sauce to go.   Tried it for the fun of it but personally I still like my burritos with shrimp... Salsarita's here I come!"}
{"text":"Johnny Burrito is exactly what I want in a burrito place. For exactly $8 you can get a burrito with your choice of meat and all the toppings your heart desires, and they're all fresh and high quality. Even when the line is fairly long, they're very quick to move everyone through. The \"normal\" size burrito is still pretty huge (coming from a guy who eats quite a lot usually), but no matter how stuffed full it is, they always seem to wrap it up nicely, and it never seems to fall apart either. They also do a great job at distributing the toppings throughout the burrito so each bite is similar to the last..way too many times I've had burritos from other places where you get one bite of all meat then one of just guacamole, etc. You start with your choice of tortilla (white, wheat, or spinach) and meat (chicken, beef, steak, veggie or the special of the week), and then you load it up with what toppings you want including cheese, guacamole, salsas, pico de gallo, rice, black beans, refried beans, mushrooms, zucchini/squash, lettuce, jalapenos, banana peppers, tomatoes, onions, and probably more I'm forgetting. I usually order the chicken, and for toppings I love the mushrooms, which have a great meaty flavor, and I bet would make even a veggie burrito really good- although I've never ordered one. I also prefer the melted queso over the shredded, the refried beans, and the guacamole (which is flavorful and fresh, and they give you a lot!)"}
{"text":"Johnnys is one of the best places in Charlotte for Mexican food. It's a hard place to find at first as its tucked in the basement but once people do discover it, they always come back. There's always long lines for lunch but it moves fast because the food is worth it. The consistency of this place is also outstanding, in fact, my coworker told me a story about how he came back to Charlotte after 9 years of not living here and found the same people working here with the same great taste. I found that pretty insane. When ordering, you can opt between a burrito and a salad(equivalent of a bowl at Chipotle), either way you're not going to be disappointed. At the end if you're looking for an extra spice, ask for the el diablo sauce. It'll add that extra kick if you're looking for it."}
{"text":"Hands down the best burrito in Charlotte. Fresh ingredients and friendly service make Johnny a must visit for burrito lovers. My go to is a big spicy chicken loaded with all the fresh fixings. Get there before noon to avoid a LONG line."}
{"text":"4 stars for the service, 2 stars for the taste.  The big wasn't that big, it was normal size to me.  Lots of choices for one price, which was awesome.  6 different meats, lots of topping choices.  And yea, the service was really good.  The taste?  Just not there.  The rice wasn't flavorful, the steak had a hint of flavor even though they were generous with it...I didn't put sour cream/cheese on there, but they are generally masking agents - what doesn't taste good with those 2 ingredients????"}
{"text":"The BEST burritos in Charlotte!  I've been to Phat burrito, Chipotle, Qdoba, Salsarita's, etc.  Everything is fresh and basically build your burrito however you want. You've gotta try the Ground Beef and Green Tomatillo Chicken combo! (Beef and Green) Top it off with a Virgil's Cream soda. Mmmmmmm delicious.  If you hit a line, no worries, it moves fast."}
{"text":"I'm updating my review b/c I recieved a message from the owner. (Good Customer Serv.) its good to know owners care enough to reach out to patrons that use Yelp. I have not been back however, the message that I got from the owner is well worth the additional star. Plus, I've been told what/how to make my next visit more \"BANG\" for my buck.   thanks again"}
{"text":"Make sure you bring your casheesh :) The tamales are amazing really good burritos. Even if the line is long it will move very fast."}
{"text":"This place was pretty cool. The people were really nice and interacted with everyone that came through the line. The line was long do people must really like this place. I had the chicken burrito and it was really good. I'm definitely going by again."}
{"text":"As a first time customer, I was welcomed warmly - something I am not accustomed to at what on the surface appeared to be a hole in wall joint tucked away under 2 Wells Fargo.  Turns out the food is very good. Spice levels as high as needed with a pretty huge variety of fresh ingredients a la Chipotle, but of course with more of a personal touch.  Btw I was also surprised pleasantly to see that they stock Thumbs up and Limca :-)"}
{"text":"The best burritos in Charlotte. Period.  If you are in downtown and in the mood for a burrito just walk in here. You'll thank me later. :)  P.S. If you are an Indian and you find the burritos in other places kinda bland, you are gonna love it here."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot!  The burritos melt in your mouth, so delicious.  Same price regardless of what toppings you get.  It is ver filling as well.  Get there early or you will most likely stand in a line that is out the door.  Also, make sure you get that spicy Diablo sauce!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Burrito! So much better than any of the other burrito places in Downtown (Uptown?) Charlotte. The line moves surprisingly fast and the service is great. Owner of the place was working the cash register and thanks you for coming in.   Oh...Guacamole is included for free."}
{"text":"Friendly staff. The owner is always there, with a smile. My food is always good, and not overly priced.   Note to manager, great job on trying to speak spanish, maybe work on your accent?!"}
{"text":"Burritos are very good and they don't nickel & dime you on guacamole / queso or any other toppings. Great cherry lime sundrop slushies. Lines are long at lunch but move very fast. Owner takes care of the staff, they have been there forever and do an outstanding job."}
{"text":"Johnny Burrito is a small fast food Mexican restaurant in the basement of the Wells Fargo building. The line around lunch time is about 10-15 minutes long. The prices are a little high for fast food but you get a big meal, so it's worth it. The food is good, but somewhere like Chipotle is definitely a little better. One benefit is that they do not charge for guac. Also they give you free gum!"}
{"text":"Randomly walked into this place one day last year and was surprised by the best burrito I've had in Charlotte. Having just moved here from Socal, this was the closest thing to a real burrito that I've had. Quick service, friendly staff. Worth trying."}
{"text":"3.5 stars (It is probably my fault the rating is this low because I was in a hurry and didn't really get to play with salsas and toppings).   We walked in yesterday to grab lunch quickly and were pleasantly surprised to find such fresh product at Johnny Burrito. I got the customized veggie with rice, black beans, lettuce, pico, onions, corn, sour cream, cilantro and a little cheese. The burrito was huge and very filling. I just needed some heat, it was a tiny bit bland, but didn't have time to go through the salsas :( Despite losing out on salsa, I thought this was a great attempt at a burrito. It took me hours to finish it.   Great bang for your buck, especially at lunch. But, I will be back for more and I'm sure my rating will go up."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go to Johnny Burrito for years, it has a cult following in Charlotte.   The line was enormous, just prepare for that--a long line is always a good sign in my book! To be perfect honest, it moves quicker than you'd expect.  The decor is fun and bright and full of mementos which really speaks to the history of the establishment. You could spend an hour just reading everything on the walls. It's a small space, but the counter is structured to bring customers through one side and out the other. There are some tables outside Johnny's if you're looking to sit and eat.  The food is great. You order and pay and then move down the counter--adding ingredients to your burrito as you go! The menu is relative limited, it's the basics and it keeps you from being overwhelmed. The serving portion was big and well worth the money. They also have tamales on Fridays worth checking out!   I recommend a regular sized chicken burrito with all your favorite toppings to start. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"OMG Burrito overload!!  Delicious food, so many choices for ingredients, but watch out for that hot sauce on the side -Diablo, wow spice!!  The service is superb! It was my first time this past week and the man taking the orders could tell - he knows his customers. He was super nice and walked me through all the options despite the long line behind me. It was a little intimidating at first, but boy was I happy once I bit into my burrito!  Best tip about this place: unfortunately they are only open during the day Mon-Fri, so trying to make it to uptown on a weekday when you don't work in uptown can be a struggle!"}
{"text":"For going in 20 years now, THE BEST BURRITO in Charlotte. No questions about it, Johnny is number one. The ingredients are always fresh and delicious, with great variety. I love the pico, guacamole, habanero sauce and fresh jalapenos. The service is quick and friendly, many of the workers have been there for literally decades. If you're feeling adventurous ask for the secret diablo sauce, it will seriously put hair on your chest. Forget all the chain tex mex joints and get the real thing."}
{"text":"Johnny Burrito is A-Okay. Not great, not bad, just Okay. Logistics works like other burrito places. An assembly line of toppings. Order your meat or veggie, fillers, and sauces. Wrap it up, pack it, rub it down and grub."}
{"text":"This is in the basement of the Wachovia Bank Building in the back by college street and 3rd.   I waited all week to eat here for the Tamales on Friday. They were chicken with red sauce inside.   In your styrofoam container you get 2 Tamales($8) and whatever toppings you want on them from behind the counter. All the standard stuff, rice, beans, sour cream, onions, queso sauce I got put on top, plus some sauteed zuchinni.   I needed more hot sauce on it to make it to my liking, but since I was already outside in the hallway and it was super crowded now I didn't get any. Make sure you get anything you might want on your food before you walk out.  Most of the staff is latino. You can't eat inside and it got pretty busy just after noontime. You can sit outside in the hallway they have 3 tables and there are some more down the hallway in front of another eatery."}
{"text":"Some things in life are all about timing... same goes for Johnny Burrito in uptown.  If you hit it at the right time, you are in and out in no time, otherwise there is a rather long time for the eats here.  Located in the College Street Shops, you can either enter from the College Street or most likely take the escalators downstairs from the Wells Fargo Atrium.  The shop is rather small, but every inch of space is used... You can tell they have been serving lunch uptown forever since they have it to where the line wraps outside of the shop and you make your way to the register, pay for your burrito, chips, what-have-you and then move on down the line to have whatever your heart desires or as the clerk at the register says, \"You are the boss for the next min or so\"  toppings glaore:  beans, meats, salsas, hot sauces.  If you get a drink they encourage you to come back and get yourself a refill, but since there isn't really a \"close\" place to eat your burrito or nachos, I am unsure on how many people actually take them up on their offer.  They also close at 3pm.  Time it just right at 11... and you are good to go... other wise you might as well wait until 1 or 2 to get your Johnny Burrito fix."}
{"text":"Johnny Burrito is the best burrito in Charlotte, BAR NONE.  This guy used to work at one of the Charlotte banking giants, and left to start his own restaurant because no one uptown made a burrito like he wanted.   This is one of the most popular lunch places with the uptown bankers -- by noon the line stretches out the door, down the hall, past the florist to a soda shop that must be jealous of Johnny's business.  You can get regular or large burritos or salads, and your choice of meat (or not) and your choice of fresh toppings.  Do not be alarmed about the line: even from past the florist, you'll be in and out of Johnny Burrito in 15 minutes.    This guy knows how to make your burrito, and he knows how to move people."}
{"text":"Good burritos and fast service. Recent visits have brought forth burritos lacking the oomph of burritos past. The firecracker chicken poppin but not crackin, the hot salsa milder than it used to be. Still though, nothing so egregious as to take JB off my Uptown lunch list when I've got burreeter fever..."}
