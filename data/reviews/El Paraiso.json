{"text":"I finally tried this place and I am so glad I did. I had a great lunch here. The enchiladas blancas are delicious."}
{"text":"Service and food were mediocre at best. My steak was well done when ordered medium and the entire dish was fair. The prices were too high for average food. I would go to Zapatas 100 times before going back here once."}
{"text":"food: great inspired latin cuisine. The empanadas + taco al pastor are great  price: good price but don't get food to GO or at least check it before you leave the place (I got the wrong order twice)  customer service: I wish the manager was a bit nicer, discussing  how \" I \" messed up my phone order was not very nice."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The owner and the whole staff are very attentive.  Great service, great food made with fresh ingredients. Will come back again! The owner even provided us with take home salsa to take home. Very happy we tried this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Consistently quality food, and fast service, making it great place to go for lunch."}
{"text":"El Paraiso is a great stop for Mexican food that is consistently good. The service is usually really great, and they seem to remember us even if it's been awhile. I like their \"pick two\" menu (pick a burrito, enchilada, chalupa, etc), but I've tried a bunch of things and they are all really good - especially the fajitas. They have live music some nights, which can get a little loud (and sort of awkward since it's a small, bright space), but it's still a fun hole in the wall type of atmosphere that always serves up good food with a smile."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The Sangria and Bistec Mexicana are legit.  Great family owned business."}
{"text":"This past weekend, we hosted a bridal shower at El Paraiso for our dear friend that is getting married this fall. It was a party of 14 girls, so you could imagine the amount of planning, etc. that had to take place before the event! Working with Elizabeth (owner) and her staff was an amazing experience. Elizabeth was always diligent via email or telephone and had good follow up with us. She also worked with us on our budget, menu (provided options/ alternatives), and etc. and she made sure the restaurant could accommodate our needs. She even worked with us on the set up for the event! Fast forward to the day of the event... It was  a huge success and the service was phenomenal. The food also turned out good, along with the sangria was definitely a huge favorite and the plantains. If you're looking for a cost effective alternative with good service and excellent management/ event planning for a bridal shower, rehearsal dinner, company lunch/ dinner, etc. look no further! El Paraiso is an even better alternative and value than some of the restaurants in the LKN/ Davidson/ Cornelius/ Mooresville area. Keep up the good work Elizabeth and team! Thanks again for everything!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal.  By far the best food in the area, and one very well-kept secret.  Salvadorean family-owned and operated by the nicest people.  The service can be a bit hit and miss, but the food is fresh and the salsa is made by hand daily.  Truly a can't- miss for the Davidson/Cornelious area."}
{"text":"I spent a week in the Davidson area and I was very glad I spotted the banner out front for El Paraiso one afternoon.  The restaurant is small but it has a tiny bar area, as well. The bartender was very kind while I drank a delicious glass of Sangria while waiting for my take-out order.  I ordered the taco salad with roasted vegetables and the guacamole. Both were fantastic and I am disappointed I didn't get a chance to head back there for another visit. I don't know if I'll ever be back in this area, too.  This place is definitely a hidden gem in the Davidson/Cornelius/Huntersville area so if you live here - make sure you check it out."}
{"text":"There are better Mexican restaurants in Cornelius, but I had to try something new.  Food was not spicy.  Flan could have been done at McDonald's.  It did not meet my standards."}
{"text":"Wonderful, authentic Latin cuisine. The best outside of Central Avenue by far! Salvadorian papusas (Central American), Peruvian lomo saltado (South American) and all the classic Mexican favorites (North American). What I love most is that a local family owns, operates, and cooks the fresh foods you enjoy. It's fun Latin music, beers from Latin countries and the great flavors of the salsas and dishes are all authentic and make this restaurant one of my favorites."}
{"text":"We are now regulars (almost daily) when in town. Have had almost everything on the menu and all is great. Best salsa, guacamole and tamales anywhere"}
{"text":"The service was slow but she was nice. The tables were only half wiped down. Dining room was small but not so much you felt like you were sitting on top of the next table. Food took so long to come out, and was not hot at all. My daughter's quesadilla was no where near melted. Margarita was weak. We don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"If your looking for authentic Salvadoran food, you will not find it here.  Their yucca with pork chunks, which is a typical dish was awful to put it mildly. Pork was very salty and tasted like old meat.  The slaw was sub-par, the yucca ok.  That was the most expensive yucca I ever ate.  $9.99 for a very small portion of yucca and the pork which I did not eat.  I thought I would give them a second chance, but it is still a no go.  Pricey and food is meh!! Won't be back.  Staff is friendly.  But I don't want to pay pricey for friendly!!"}
{"text":"The service was great.  The salsa was great. The epinadas were pretty good. Problem is,  3 out of 5 orders at our table were served cold (and rice, beans, and tacos and burritos should be hot).  We sent one order back and they replaced it completely with a warmer order (still not hot).  We brought half of it home to heat up tomorrow, so it wasn't a total loss.  Looks like most folks have had better food here, so maybe they were just having a bad night. Even so, we probably won't go back.  It wasn't cheap either...60 bucks for 5 people, plus a tip."}
{"text":"Went based on the reviews on yelp....very disappointing.  One of worst places I've been to in the area and service was awful too."}
{"text":"We had a great lunch here a few weeks ago, finally got around to having a diner here.   It was really good.  Fresh salsa, the Papusa was homemade and good (although I thought it needed more seasoning), and the enchiladas were top notch.  Service was very attentive and fast."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place that will have us coming back time and again! We live just down the street and have always wanted to stop in. This Saturday was the perfect opportunity.  We were seated immediately and had fresh chips and salsa within 5 minutes of sitting. The fiancée ordered the El Salvadorian Treat which includes Pupusa, Chicken Tamale, plantains, yucca, chicken pastelito, & refried beans. I can speak to the good quality of everything on the plate except for the Chicken Tamale. She enjoyed the Chicken Tamale so much that I was not allowed to try a bite. I think I might need to order one for myself next time! I ordered a Pupusa and the Chimichanga with Cream Cheese and Chicken. The flavors were wonderful but what really struck me about the Chimichanga was the amount of chicken. It was stuffed full of chicken! No rice or other unnecessary fillers. Just delicious chicken! And finally, the Sangria. My understanding is that the rotate the fruit in the Sangria every couple of days. Saturday was apple and strawberry. I have no words. I can only say that I can not imagine that I will ever come here and not order the Sangria! My only complaint: We opened our menus to find salsa and chips inside. We asked for new ones and the server was quick to oblige. We opened the new ones to find salsa. Since there were no chip pieces we just made due. But it was an odd experience. Perhaps they store their salsa next to the menus... Just something little."}
{"text":"Ordered take out twice.  We cannot believe how many times we've driven by and never stopped.  Huge mistake!  This food is AMAZING and the prices are comfortable.  The atmosphere inside is really nice too.  Now we just need to dine in for the full experience."}
{"text":"I had an intercultural program with 5 dinners, and decided to have El Paraíso cater. I cannot say enough about how amazing their food and service is. Elizabeth Cruz was extremely helpful as I was ordering, making recommendations and accommodating our participants' dietary restrictions. The food was always delivered on time and the delivery people were quite friendly and polite. They always included chips and salsa with our order, free of charge, and waived the delivery fee because our orders were usually over $90. Some of our program participants were from El Salvador and they said that the food was delicious. I would recommend the tacos, enchiladas, and fried plantains."}
{"text":"Delicious authentic Latin fare. The best I've had in the US. Super fresh and generous portions. Very inexpensive and the service was excellent. I cannot believe it took me so long to discover this place! So grateful that I did and I cannot wait to return."}
{"text":"This place was beyond horrible! First off our salsa was cold like it had just left the FREEZER, chips were also stale. When it came time to order I said I did NOT want beans with my chimichanga and the waitress acted like it was a problem, also it said on the menu a \"large tortilla\", the tortilla was I would say 2 inches wide and 4-5 inches long. If you're going to advertise it as \"large\" make sure it is exactly that. The rice was clumped together and cold as well, also the shrimp that came in the chimichanga still had the tail on them which I was not aware of, I did not appreciate biting into that. My over all experience with this place is disappointed."}
{"text":"I adore the beef enchiladas - and the chips are always crispy and fresh.  i find the service is excellent - I am always tempted to drop in for a quick lunch as I am running errands, and I often do just that.  We even had my daughter's bridesmaids' luncheon here.  They were super accommodating, helped us set up a square of tables to everyone in the party could converse easily.  Everyone way thrilled with their meals."}
{"text":"Best Mexican/Salvadorian restaurant in Charlotte! Every thing is home made and so delicious! Also, everyone is so friendly and they have live music (not sure if every day but was there on Saturday evening). Would recommend the pupusas, cheese dip, plantains, shrimp Diablo, and bistec Mexicana. Can't go wrong, everything was very good! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Tried this place last night for dinner on the advice of a friend.  Not sure what they saw in this place but the three of us didn't!!  The menu that's shown on-line is not the menu they use, the actual menu is much smaller.  No chile Colorado, no chili verde, no chicken mole, etc.  The salsa choices they tout on line don't exist.  We had a young kid who looked like a deer in headlights when we asked about the other kinds of salsas.  The food we did have was ok, but it was rather bland and the portions were small.  We love to support family owned businesses but we won't be returning to this one."}
{"text":"Excited to try more of their menu.  I have had takeout from here one time for lunch and it was great.  Chicken enchiladas with green sauce.  The chicken was juicy and the green sauce was spicy and flavorful.  They are listed as Latin American, but they have your usual favorites you can find at Mexican joints as well."}
{"text":"If you go here, get the cheese pupusas!!!! Also, chips and queso are a must have. Very good food at a decent price. I often like to order to-go."}
{"text":"Such sweet people and so proud of their culture! We always do the take out method but this has been a family place for us. They always have the order correct, affordable and great if you need to feed the masses. The tacos are to die for!"}
{"text":"Best Latin/Mexican food I had in the area. We started with the pupusa pork/cheese. I had the burrito ranchero and my husband had the enchilada Suizas.  The complimentary salsa was definitely the best I had!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice since moving to the area - once on a work lunch and once for lunch with my wife. Both times, the food and service were excellent. I have had their enchiladas, quesadillas and tacos and everything has a fresh, authentic flavor. Their salsa is a great mix of spicy and flavorful, which pairs well with the chips. Even my wife, who isn't a fan of spicy, enjoyed the kick of the salsa. She got the spinach enchiladas and even said it reminded her of her grandmother's food (she's Colombian, though this restaurant is Mexican and Salvadorian).  A great lunch for a good price, we'll definitely have to come back for dinner. They have a great selection of beers and wines here to pair with the food. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone passing through the area who likes Latin food."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place that I have driven past countless times after reading such favorable reviews.  All I can say is thank you for posting these reviews because I would never have discovered this great little local joint.  We had lunch on a weekday and the service and atmosphere were both wonderful.  The food however was better than wonderful.  Super fresh and simply delicious, not to mention a great deal.  Do yourself a favor and check out El Paraiso for great food and friendly and prompt service."}
{"text":"Great little spot with a varied menu & nice sangria. Appears to be family-run and service is attentive and quick. Not sure what the gripe is with some previous reviews re service - I'd go back for sure.   Not long on atmosphere, but definitely worth a stop when you want some Central/South American food.  There's limited seating so call ahead for a reservation!"}
{"text":"So I drive by this place every day on my way home from work and it always looks packed.  I decided to go for lunch here with a friend from work.  The place was empty which was really weird to me because there was a number of cars outside.  Also, what caught me by surprise was how big it was inside, I thought it may have like 5 tables inside but it was at least double that with a bar.  Oh and the first thing that caught my eye was the container of Sangria on the bar, man if only I wasn't going back to work after lunch... I so would have had some Sangria.   My friend and I both got the enchilada platters, it was sooo... good and the service was great too!  I am definitely going to come back here!    I also agree with the other two posts, this place seems to be a secret to the area.  Which is disappointing to me, I want to spread the word about this place because it has great food!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Portions are generous, prices are reasonable, ambiance is cozy and food is sooooooooo good! And this coming from a Latina. Check this place out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I wasn't ready.. I wasn't ready for such quality and fresh authentic food! Ok, I throw down on some Mexican food and let me just tell ya that this place is the staple of Mexican food in my life! The staff and owners are SO friendly and awesome at their job! Other places are basically dead to me now.. I live right around the corner so I'll throw on some shoes and loosen my belt cause I know that once I get there.. It's. Going. Down. Seriously speaking, you're crazy if you don't like this place haha the food has always been fantastic! Oh! And they have live music from time to time! No idea what they are singing about but the man and woman who frequently play there have a voice that'll bring you to tears.. Just try not to cry on that beast of a burrito that lies before you!"}
{"text":"I went on a Tuesday night and it wasn't crowded. The service was a bit slow. I was not sure what to exspect since I drove by and decided to give it a try. I love mexican food. First the chips and salsa was ok. I have had better but not bad. I ordered a combo plate of Beef taco and chicken enchilada. I tought the food was pretty good for the price. I would go back for another visit. The only true complaint is that the sevice would get faster."}
{"text":"The 3 stars are mostly for their friendly service although our server wasn't the most experienced in Salvadoran/Mexican food she was very pleasant and was putting in the effort.    It's a nice restaurant with plenty of seating and they are very friendly, however I was not impressed with the food.   It started off wrong when we ordered a couple of Horchata's which were horrible and very far from authentic Mexican Horchata. Disappointed #1.  Their Chips were oddly dry and although we attempted to put salt on them it didn't help at all, the salsa was good. I try not to go to restaurants that supposedly specialize in more than one cuisine but we're new in town and decided to give it a try.   We tried their Pupusas which is a traditional Salvadorian specialty and a tamale. Both were ok and I suppose that coming from South Florida our standard for Latin Foods is very different. The food seemed bland and for sure my dish was microwaved as the plate was very hot and the refried beans were burnt around the edges just as it would if it were microwaved. My chicken enchiladas had no flavor and barely any seasoning that I could savor.   The owner dropped by our table and seems to have a great rapport with the customers and that's very important and was very appreciated. Even the customers were friendly as we casually struck up conversation with a patron.   I doubt we'll return."}
{"text":"As you can tell from my review stats I RARELY give one stars. This place is one of the few. I trusted the good reviews of my fellow yelpers and I was very disappointed. The salsa was sub par and the chips were stale. I ordered the chicken quesadilla which was just ok, nothing spectacular by any means. My husband ordered the Speedy Gonzales lunch special which consisted of 1/2 a chicken quesadilla and hard shell taco. The interesting part of his meal was the clearly microwavable rice. It was still in the shape of the plastic container it came in.   Now for the reason for the one star, the service was terrible. It took us 15 minutes to get our check after we finished. Few refills and once we got our food we never saw our waitress again until my husband flagged her down for the check. The place was empty, with only one other table in use. Our waitress was too busy sitting at the register playing with her phone to wait on her two tables."}
{"text":"We ventured out to get some dinner and WOW!!!!   We had been here a number of years ago but decided to come back.     First things first, they brought out the chips and salsa.  Like I have mentioned in other reviews that is a tell tale sign.   The salsa was fresh and had really good flavor.  For our main courses we had the shrimp tacos and Enchiladas salsa tomatillo with chicken.     Both dishes were done very well.  Portions were just right as we both were full but not overfull.  The enchiladas were heavenly.  The chicken was moist and the tomatillo sauce was very flavorful with just the right amount of heat.   The Shrimp tacos were perfectly cooked and had great flavor.  Both rice and beans came with each entree.  Both were cooked perfectly.     This is a great family restaurant that you want to come to everyday.   Will repeat."}
{"text":"Fabulous atmosphere,  highly recommend the shrimp ceviche  (tostadas), the Platanos fritos and the empanadas for starters to share are a great way to start the meal."}
{"text":"Very small place in the middle of nowhere but oh so good. The empanadas and tomals are top notch. The margaritas are made fresh and the entrees are great. I had the carne guisada which brought back a ratatouille like childhood flashback. Fantastic. Only issue was a small timing one. The apps came out at the same time as our entrees but the quality of the food far outweighed that minor issue."}
{"text":"This was an interesting experience. Drove by thought let's try this place. Clean atmosphere, pleasant greeting upon arrival. Started with a few traditional Salvadorian appetizers. Ordered 3, one came out wrong then the one we ordered was unavailable. She took the wrong food of our plate with her fingers....We decided to just wait to just keep the 2 and order our dinner.  All of a sudden a random plate of food came out. We did not order it..she stated we did. It was pork and I even mentioned how I do not eat pork when ordering our original meal.. Awkwardness happened she brought it back to the kitchen and came back and ordered our dinner entree. She asked if I wanted another beer I said no, 10 minutes later a beer that I DID not order was coming out. I just gave up & drank it..  Husband ordered a combo platter of shredded chicken burrito and beef chalupa and got all beef. My soup I got all the vegetables in it were raw.  To say the least there is a HUGE language barrier. Very very frustrating experience. We've been in different countries and did not speak the native language and had NO issues with wrong food.. Just overall an awkward experience that didn't get better throughout the night.."}
{"text":"I'm not sure that this was what id call \"latin\" or El Salvadorian, I looked and looked and its typical Mexican food, which I do enjoy. Our server was very attentive, there wasn't many people the day before a holiday. The chips were hot, great till the bottom when they became oily and chewy. Salsa was perfect. We had guacamole, also great. All in all it wasn't what I was expecting but an okish Mexican place."}
{"text":"Love this place. I haven't been here in a while but every time I come it blows me away. I just love everything here. My favorite thing is the plantains but the sangria, salsa, wine margarita, enchilada, and everything is tasty. I'm a little picky when it comes to Latin food as you can see from my other reviews but this place is a favorite."}
{"text":"My hubby and I stopped by for lunch. I ordered the chicken flautas and he ordered the veggie quesadilla. The flautas were really tasty and crispy. It came with refried beans and rice and pico and sour cream. The pico was so fresh and delicious. I wanted more. The flautas were small more like taquitos and they were drizzled in sour cream. Yummy. Hubby's quesadilla was crispy and looked good. They had Pepsi products and played decent music, not the standard Mexican restaurant type music. Service was not great but it was okay. Overall, it was a good experience."}
{"text":"Let's say 2.5 stars.  We went for lunch. We were greeted by a lady at the bar, given menus, placed our orders at the bar. I thought we ordered lunch specials with a couple of extra items (drinks, chips).   Our bill was $30.  Got home and no way was it $30 worth of food. Nor was it delicious. It was \"good\".  We'll stick with Chipotle."}
{"text":"The people here are very nice and the service is excellent. However, I had a bad experience and here is why. Be aware that their rice contains an ingredient that is very little and extremely hard. I took a fork full of rice into my mouth, chewed and out went one of my fillings in my mouth. It is going to cost me around $300 to get replaced. So, just food for thought on that one... Secondly, I ordered al a carte. Two tacos and rice and beans. The waitress conveniently overcharged me by about three dollars. So overall, I have to give this restaurant a one, which I hate to do because their smiles and the vibes were so sweet. Oh, the food did not have much flavor."}
{"text":"It's very good, the food and the service. About 20% more expensive than La Unica where we usually go to but the portion is bigger too, the ingredients are pretty fresh. We enjoy it."}
{"text":"Had the nephews [under 5] with us,so service had to get us in,and out.This place did just that,and their milk was a good size.We ordered to share:chimichurie ,empandada,pupusa,el tipico, flautus,and twin burritos.It was an early lunch,and I had never tried some of the stuff my inlaw ordered. Cruz mole salsa was really good."}
{"text":"Hands down authentic! Salsa is killer!!! We come here twice a month and have never been disappointed. Owner , Lovely Elizabeth, is always so genuine with her welcome as his her pappa who visits table side and is so grateful for our patronage. The staff is humble and friendly and patient as it always so hard to choose from the many offerings. Try it all."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!!! If you have not been here you must go!  Hands down the best Latin restaurant around!!!"}
{"text":"The first thing you need to know is that Google maps is wrong!  It will direct you to a supermarket, but don't buy it!  Follow street signs to address.  The restaurant is small and unassuming but such big flavors come out of that kitchen!  The chips and salsa are fresh and plentiful.  We ordered queso dip and it was smooth and creamy.  The chimichanga was crispy and smothered in delicious mole sauce and cheese sauce.  The chicken was seasoned perfectly and shredded, not in chunks.  Delicious!  The Pollo con crema was the winner of the night.  Flat planks of chicken grilled on the plancha with onions, peppers and mushrooms, and then smothered with the cheesy sauce.  The chicken was tender and charred perfectly.  The veggies were crisp with also burnt nicely on the edges which gave them a smoky flavor.  Sangria is sitting in a huge urn on the counter, though I did not partake.  The owner was also there and he was very kind, as was the whole staff.  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"El Paraiso is a wonderful place to enjoy a meal.   You will be greeted by Mr. Cruz, the patriarch of the family that owns and operates the restaurant. He is a warm and kind gentleman, and he will not only make you feel welcomed, he will speak to you as if you are an honored guest and friend.  I came by tonight for dinner and was not disappointed. I started with a pupusa- sliced pork and cheese between two delicious corn tortillas. For my entree I had the chicken and rice- two large chicken breasts, grilled and served with spinach, red and green peppers and onions, served over rice and topped with queso sauce. It was delicious.  I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 for this visit only because both my appetizer and main course took unusually long to come out of the kitchen. I do realize it was a Saturday night, but it was not too busy. So I think it could have come out a big quicker. But this is a minor quibble. The food still arrived hot.   Mr. Cruz gave me a warm abrazo (hug)  on the way out, so all was well.  Do give El Paraiso a try. You will be supporting a local, family run business with friendly people who take pride in the food they serve."}
{"text":"What a great find in a mini strip mall in Cornelius!  We love their homemade salsa...it's some of the best we've found at a local Mexican restaurant.  (You can even buy some to take home.)  Their plantain appetizer with refried beans and sour cream is the one I compare all others to.  Their prices are very reasonable, and their menu is filled with lots of choices.  Definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"Very nice people working there. Chips and salsa are great. Price is a little high. Very nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This past Saturday I was looking to go somewhere for lunch.  Keeping in mind Nicole's shop local initiative I decide to eat  somewhere that wasn't a national chain.  I drove to Toast in Davidson, but that was too crowded.  So I decided to rely on my trusty Yelp app to find an alternative, which brought me to El Paraiso.  I loved this place!  It has everything you would want in a great local restaurant good food, good value, and good atmosphere.  With my order I went simple and selected the two chicken tacos with rice and black beans (instead of the normal re-fried beans...being healthy).  Unfortunately, the very nice girl who took my order got confused when I requested soft tacos as she thought I had meant soft flour shells and not the soft corn I prefer.  She offered to replace the dish, but as you could see from the photo they were too tasty looking to return.  I really like that they use quality ingredients here.  The lettuce was shredded leaf and not the cheap iceberg stuff.  The onions were of the red variety and the chicken was fresh pulled and not processed.  All of this, plus chips, salsa (fresh made), and an iced tea came in at around $8.  A great deal for the quantity and quality received.  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Excellent and authentic, good service and friendly staff. Good size restaurant, nice ambiance and portions! I'll definitely be back! First time here had a tasty ground  beef burrito and shredded  chicken chalupa!"}
{"text":"Dee-lish! Try the sangria. Actually, try two--it's that good! :-)  And, the owner is a delightful man who greets every customer at their table.  Five stars!"}
{"text":"We eat a weekly meal at El Paraiso on Sunday nights. It is the best meal we have every week, hands down. The food is amazing, original & management and staff make the experience wonderful. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who likes good food!"}
{"text":"El Paraiso has quickly become my Lake Norman area standby. My favorite platillos are the enchilada fiesta, tacos el carbon and bistec a la mexicana. Mmmm. And for all you yelp pupusa converts, El Paraiso's got something special for yall too."}
