{"text":"DO NOT EAT AT THE PATIO!! THERE'RE A LOT OF BEES!!!!! We couldn't even finish our meal because there're at least 6 or 7 bees dancing around us we couldn't even enjoy our food. We had to leave after few bites of our food. Not to mention the toasts are completely burnt. The only pro is the decor which is really nice but very small."}
{"text":"I ate at Cafe CanCan Tuesday night, a beautiful night, a beautiful table, by the open back door, near the patio, we felt like we were at the beach! I ordered a la carte, mushroom soup, green beans and green salad. Everything was perfect or close to. My companions had steak au poivre and panisse, and eclairs for dessert. All terrific. I ordered a panisse to bring home to my housebound spouse, and was very disappointed when I got home to discover the whole thing, including sauce, sitting on the bottom of the cardboard container. Ick, shouldn't have to scrape a $$$ takeout out of the carton. Otherwise, 5 stars. Look forward to bringing my favourite friends here for lunch on the completely charming patio."}
{"text":"It says on their website that brunch was until 4:30 and dinner started at 5 but I didn't know that meant they're closed 4:30-5 and don't take any customers. Would've been nice if they made it more clear on their website."}
{"text":"Delicious food and service! I highly recommend! Environment was super cute and back patio was just beautiful!"}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to coming here but FOH and manager were incredibly rude and not accommodating. Did not end up staying and eating even though we had made a reservation several weeks in advance. I'm sure the food is good but the service? Terrible."}
{"text":"This is such a beautiful and inviting space.  The service was perfect, just the right amount of attention and no rush to leave.   Amazing flavours and dishes. Such attention to using seasonal and local produce.   I hope someday to have room for the dessert menu."}
{"text":"The interior of Café Cancan follows the same layout as the room's previous incarnation but with a Disney Princess makeover.  It's prettier, more open and way more instagrammable, and these days isn't that the goal?

We ordered cocktails to start.  They did not come quickly.  Our waitress apologized twice for the wait and informed us once that they drinks were indeed coming.  She must have seen the doubt and despair in our eyes.  Anyway I wouldn't mind so much if the drinks were great or if the bartender was slammed but they were just okay and he wasn't.  

I'm more of a beer person than anything and I always appreciate a well-curated, laser-focused selection of beer on a menu.  Which I did not find here.  What you'll find on tap are a pair of Mill Street beers (Organic and the session IPA, both meh) and Brick Works Cider.  There are also a couple of big bottles of Goose Island stuff.  Basically I think they called their Labatt's rep and said, \"Just give me whatever you got.\"  Too bad.

Service was friendly and attentive. Victor Barry was rocking a Hawaiian shirt and working the room and we had a lovely chat with him which was nice. 

I had the mushroom soup and it was incredible, with the gruyère toast to dunk it in.  And when the toast was gone there was also bread on the table which was quickly dunked.  And I basically couldn't stop dunking bread in this stuff until it was all gone.  As I was silent and unresponsively transcended by soup, my wife elbowed in on my dunkfest at one point to see what all the fuss was about.  She also couldn't believe so much deliciousness could be found inside one tiny bowl.

My wife had the steak tartare and appreciated that it was prepared as a composed dish with everything on it, including these darling little fingerling potato chips.  So cute.

I had the Panisse frite with seasonal vegetable fricassée--turns out peas and carrots are in season.  I thought peas and carrots were an all-year thing.  Who knew?  Anyway, whatever.  It was delicious.  With grilled halloumi and something which I could only describe as chickpea polenta.  I'd happily eat this again.

My wife had the skate as her main.  Don't' know that she was blown away.  She wasn't overly forthcoming with feedback.

For dessert we had grilled pineapple with rice pudding.  The pineapple was as advertised: Grilled.  The rice pudding lacked the moreishness I look for in a rice pudding, and I'm personally not a huge fan of the texture of coconut.  It was fine..  

The lemon cheesecake eclair whatsit on the other hand was amazing.  If you only get one thing at Café Cancan get two of these.  You're not going to want to share.

Overall we had a very enjoyable meal,  It's still early days and I'm sure as things get fine tuned it will only improve.  We'll definitely be back at some point to find out.

Nitpicky footnote: They should put one person in charge of the dimmer behind the bar.  The light level changed several times throughout the evening at the hands of a few different people.  It's distracting and wreaks havoc with my circadian rhythms.

PS. The bill comes in a duck."}
{"text":"To keep this simple- Stunning interior design and very well decorated, but the menu was disappointing and dull compared to other similar cafes. Service definitely needs improvement. 

The good:
- Absolutely stunning interior design- a very unique, cute, and pretty cafe. Patio was also very adorable. 

Areas for Improvements:
- Service was not the best. The waitresses were talking amongst themselves and pretty much ignored us the entire time. Also tried to make us leave as soon as we were done. Not a good place to go to if you're looking for a relaxing place to catch up with some friends. 

- Prices of foods and beverages are definitely overpriced. I was definitely disappointed by the taste.

Overall, I do not recommend coming here."}
{"text":"Such a great place!! Excellent service , I ordered food and didn't know there were pork in it, and I don't eat pork, and they changed it without charging any fees!! Definitely gonna come back again!!!"}
{"text":"Went in a group of 5 + a brand new baby.  Really amazingly delicious.  Our server had an attitude and was not helpful in making drink or food recommendations - the owner was lovely and super friendly. They serve Beefeater 24 gin which no matter what people say is garbage because Beefeater is garbage.Other than that - it was just wonderful.  

We shared: burgers, ceci et cela, eclairs, mushrooms, steak tartar, bavette, and some other delicious things that I can't remember.  All were so great but special shout outs to the ceci et cela and steak tartar.

Side note:  our friend that came with us had been before when her baby was 2 weeks old and the owner gave her and her husband champagne to celebrate."}
{"text":"The best Parisian cafe in Toronto - gorgeous food, the sweetest interior design and friendly service. We went for brunch early on a Saturday morning (with a reservation) and it was buzzing but in a calm Saturday morning kind of way. Scrambled eggs with truffle, cappuccino and perfectly cooked frites, everything was perfect. 

The couple next to us spent about five full minutes taking pictures of their food before they ate. It truly is an insta lovers paradise."}
{"text":"Cafe Cancan is the Perfect Example of the Trendy, Instagram Worthy Restaurant with is Pastel Colours and Amazing Patio at the back, all the signs for theses new restaurant all about style and no substance. But thank GodRamsay, i was wrong. CanCan delivered an amazing modern french classic Brunch with a succulent Croque-Madame that brought me right back to Quebec City in a Second. The Bread Pudding French Toast is also quite creative and delicious.

Average customer service in an amazing Romantic Pastel Ambiance. Perfect for a first date or meeting your new in-law. Set to impress with a humble side to it."}
{"text":"What an adorable little oasis!

My friend took me here for brunch the other weekend during my trip to Toronto. It's perfectly \"instagrammable\" - with adorable decor and colorful walls. It took 30 min or so to get in to the bar (we didn't have reservations beforehand). I highly recommend making reservations beforehand!

The coffee drinks were amazing and it's a great spot to just hang out. My friend got the wrong brunch meal and when she finally told a staff member (she felt bad asking them because it looked so good) they apologized right away and brought her a new meal. 

Make it a point to stop here on your next trip to Toronto! Perfect embodiment of the \"French 75\" aesthetic and a great Sunday brunch spot."}
{"text":"Came here for the cute ambience to take pictures. Restaurant didn't appear full but apparently it was fully booked that we had to result in sitting by the bar. It was a really small place surrounded with pink walls. 

We ordered the beef tartare, ceci et cela, coffee and tea. Honestly, food was just mediocre but coffee was good. I liked how they made my coffee fresh to order straight from the coffee machine. Service was good, he was attentive and polite."}
{"text":"Brunch

No complaints. Food, service and ambience on point. Really cute ambience. 

Repeat: Good yummy food, but nothing memorable (e.g. Takht-e Tavoos, Bar Buca etc)......perhaps in the future, but not immediately."}
{"text":"Honestly had no idea about Cafe CanCan. Someone I work with had made a reservation but could not go, so asked if I wanted to go.  Always open for something new I decided to accept. 

Located in a small, cute white house, we walked into an inviting, warm, pink room   To the left side was a line of tables and the right a beautiful bar. 

We were quickly greeted and seated. Server was very helpful and knowledgeable. 

The menu is not large but the selection is wonderful. 

I started with the Vesper cocktail. Mmm so good and very strong. 

Glass of beautiful Cab Franc with dinner 

I started with escargot, followed by the burger and ended with the Armagnac Creme brûlée. 

All the food was fresh, wonderfully prepared and perfectly proportioned.  

They had a foie gras menu that I will be going back for. There was one made with strawberries and rhubarb that I think will be perfect for patio season."}
{"text":"Loved everything! From the fun sorbet decor to the endless fois gras, oysters, steak. Food heaven! Great service perfect ambience killer playlist. Enough said, perfection! Sexy chic cool...."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch. Cute, quaint and the decor is very nice. The Truffled Scrambled Eggs were delicious.
The coffee and French pastries (truffles, eclairs) were amazing. 
Make reservations! This trendy popular hot spot gets packed quickly. 
Be sure to check out the patio in the back."}
{"text":"Rating - 3.0/5.0

A french bistro serving up contemporary dishes, Cafe Cancan is a relatively new restaurant that is brought to you by Chef Barry from Piano Piano and is also known for their aesthetically eye catching pastel themed decor that is sure to attract many folks. 

Went here to check out their brunch menu over the past weekend and the food was fairly decent. Here we have a burger dressed in mayo remoulade, red onions, pickles, and cheddar cheese. Bun was soft on the inside, buttery and nicely toasted. Beef patty itself was reasonably juicy though on the leaner side. Fries were well seasoned but as it was a thick cut, the outer layer was not crisp enough and felt quite starchy on the inside as if it was baked.

Service definitely needs improvement as there wasn't the attentiveness that you would expect. Folks were all lined up in front waiting and the host did not acknowledge us for close to 10 minutes. Also the hostesses could be more high spirited as the general experience felt a bit dull for a place with such a whimsical ambience. Hopefully they can take this feedback to heart and strive to create a better experience for their guests."}
{"text":"Ambience: the ambience is super cute and colourful! Really unique decorating and definitely photo-worthy
Food: the food is only average. My friend and I got the \"French picnic\" and the \"fried duck eggs\". The French picnic felt like a bunch of aesthetically pleasing foods placed next to each other but no cohesion. The smoked salmon was some of the saltiest salmon I've ever had--which felt very stark compared to the other gentle and mild flavoured items. The friend duck eggs were very savory but not overly special. We also got a chocolate croissant which was nice and buttery. However, I would argue that Costco croissants are better if you toast them. 
Service: the service was okay. They got my wrong the first time, but they quickly got the right one (granted my food was supposed to be cold so no cooking was involved). They forgot the croissant we ordered at the beginning and we had to ask again when we finished our food. 
Overall, I found it to be nice for the ambience but I probably wouldn't come back for the food--especially at the price point."}
{"text":"Loved the atmosphere at Cafe Cancan. Went there for brunch on Saturday morning and the place was quite busy. We ordered the Croque Madame which was absolutely delicious and the portion was very generous as well. Overall would highly recommend visiting, not only for the food but also the cute food pics for the blog too!"}
{"text":"Very cute spot for brunch with the girls. It's adorable inside and the food is styled very pretty as well. Service was just ok, food and cocktails were both good. Might be a little hyped but definitely worth a try if you're looking for a fancier brunch!"}
{"text":"Came here because I saw the decor on Instagram. But the food and service is terrible. And to tell you the truth the decor is not as nice as in pictures. You find that there are a lot of home decor items that are not functional and annoying in a restaurant. Such as pillows, fabric, and the lighting hung in weird places. But back to the food. I find it over all very fatty and felt very unhealthy after leaving the place. Service was rude as hell. Trying to be a high end place but with low end food. Very expensive and the chef came out to check on us but didn't have the heart to tell him we were very underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Very cozy atmosphere. The staff was friendly. The experience overall was great. The theme was very warm."}
{"text":"Nice French bistro gem near U of T campus. 
I would give the food a solid 5 star. Service staff are very friendly and knowledgable, but it can be a little slow.
Escargot apptitzer was good, Artichoke was innovative with prosciutto and cheese, but a little too tough for my liking.
The trout was a home run, smoked and slightly cooked to perfection. Duck confit met all the expectation of a great French restaurant. 
Will have to come back next time to try out the fix-menu."}
{"text":"ballin ass restaurant. shout out to fraaankieeeee

points for da sweet sounds spinning at night"}
{"text":"3 1/2 stars actuallu. Super cute decor, service was great! Food was ok..$18 eggs Benny  They should use English muffins...none of us ate the crunchy crust lol"}
{"text":"Service is terrible... I called the waitress three times, twice no one noticed me... And the third time a girl asked me to wait for moment but never came back, though I saw her chatted with other girls behind the bar...I actually consider it is a discrimination on asian. I definitely feel that I was treated differently than other customers. 
What frustrated me more is the food. Tough toast and salty mashroom! I will never come back to the place."}
{"text":"Interesting little find tucked away in a friendly family neighbourhood. Reservations needed for inside dinning room while bar and patio is good for walk-ins. Glad that was the case as we stumbled upon a very busy restaurant in time for a sitting in a comfortable backyard patio. 

The food is pretty good. Presentation very good and the service was also very good."}
{"text":"Cute little space. Came for brunch. Surprisingly, no vegetarian brunch option (maybe we didn't look hard enough?) Their bacon is absolutely worth it: no skimpy rashers here; we're talking a solid hunk of fatted meat :)"}
{"text":"WOW I am mad. My friend and I went to this place for brunch on a Sunday morning. Everything was fine when we first walked in, but the server's attitude was really rude. But I understand, it was a Sunday morning and you don't want to work, fine. In my head, I was going to give it a 4 star, cause the place was nice and I was with a good company. I ordered the Petit Dejeuner and it was very basic., fine whatever. The thing I was MAD about is that one of the toasts was so fricking burnt and when I requested for a toast that's not burnt, the owner gave me such an attitude (I will post the picture of the toast, let me know if you guys think that toast is over burnt or not). They also need more staffs, my friend and I finished our food for almost 25 minutes before they decided to take our plates away. We also lost our appetite for desserts when no one would check up on us after we finished our main. I really wanted to give this place a good review, but everything was just very rough and unpleasant. 

I ALSO WANT TO MAKE A PSA. 

They have a drink (Greenhouse Juice) on the menu and a  glass of it costs $6. I searched up on the website, A BOTTLE OF THE JUICE COSTS MAXIMUM 20 dollars and they charge you 6 dollars for a glass????!???? They filled the glass with half ice and half juice. I just feel like they over priced it, but that's for you to decide. I understand the juice is organic but like come on $6??? I don't mind spending $ on drinks, but the price is too high. I just feel bad for people who ordered it and a heads up for people who wants to try it in the future (just order yourself a bottle on the Greenhouse website)."}
{"text":"The setting is nice, but it's quite small. The menu isn't great for vegetarians. We only had dessert, we ordered 3 different flavour eclairs but they weren't very good. It's quite pricey and I'm glad I tried it for dessert before getting a meal. I wouldn't go back"}
{"text":"This place is ridiculously cute. When the decor is THIS NICE... I'm naturally skeptical of how good the food's gonna taste for the *ahem* inflated price. Cafe Cancan, I totally prepped myself to be underwhelmed.

I wasn't. All the dishes were good. I need to come back for the burger.

Recap:
The crepe is a SOLID choice--flavours blended well and wasn't too heavy. 
The buttermilk pancakes is savoury indulgence, deliciously fried and topped with bacon... and you drizzle on the maple syrup--UNF. 
Croque madame is quite the feast for the eyes--HEFTY.
I got the duck egg with 3 eggs. If you're a fan of mushrooms, get this. 

Personally, I'd skip the \"Le Brunch\" combo. The croissant, puff pastry, and juice were good but not mind-blowing; the incremental utility was marginal."}
{"text":"What a beautiful spot. In this day and age any new cafe has to be instagrammable, and they definitely took every detail into consideration. 

I had a coffee (they do not have any coconut or almond milk) and a lemon eclair - both were a generous size and very delicious. 

Service was inattentive, and we had to bother multiple people to assist us. 

But the spot is super cute for a date, majority of the people inside were females. 

Definitely a blogger home base, since it's so picturesque. So expect a bit of posh."}
{"text":"Ambience : 5 stars

This place is tiny but so adorable. Every corner worth a instagram picture. 

Food :2 stars 
The weekday lunch menu has very limited options. 
We ordered the French picnic and Ham'n' cheese baguette. Both are very disappointing. Nothing you would expect for a place like this...

Service : 3.5 stars 
The servers are friendly but they are so busy that it could take a long time for them to notice your need."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful, the interior is decorated nicely. Its a very cute cafe.
BUT, this place is not that much of a good place to eat at. The quality of the food is questionable for the price. 18$ for a baguette that was burnt black on the bottom and too hard to chew on, every time i took a bite i felt like i was eating a rock, and crumbs flew everywhere on the table. It was filled with slabs of ham and cheese that tasted like the typical ones i can get at a local grocery store for cheap. The platter with the egg, toast, ham, cheese, salmon etc was decent, the toast was burnt to black. The only good thing we ate here was the burger, it came with thick fries and a creamy sauce, the burger itself was pretty small tho.  

The thing that triggered me to write this review was the waitress. It was around 11am when we came and it was mostly empty besides 1 other group in the cafe. She did not greet us when we came in, when she came to our table she simply said \"what are you ordering?\" in a quiet voice. When we got our food she did not come back to check up on us like how most places did. When we paid for our food she only said \"Thank you.\" with half a smile. I expected a place that charges so much for their food to have service that would live up to the price.  I went to cheaper places that had better service than this place. She should be more enthusiastic and speak in a louder voice, she seemed so gloomy as a waitress.  Overall she made us feel un-welcomed and we will not be coming back here. You can eat at better places within the same range of prices that offer better food and better service."}
{"text":"Most of the reviews of CanCan are focussed on the decor which is lovely, I must agree. Lots of attention to detail here. Soothing colours, stylish patterns, and soft romantic music make the ambiance part a memorable evening. Right down to the charming little duck that contains the bill at the end of your meal.

But lets talk about how good the food is.

I believe French cuisine is the most difficult to get right. Many places give a dish a French name and that's where it ends. But for the true essence, the ingredients need to be very fresh and the seasoning bold but perfectly balanced. Chef Victor Barry does an amazing job while keeping the flavour and richness of traditional French dishes but updating them with a more modern flair. 

I was excited when I saw escargots on the appetizer list as it's been many years since I've had them. It used to be as common as calamari is now in restaurant fare but these days you don't see it as often. The plate came to the table sizzling. We were given some caraway rye on the side to soak up the delicious butter and garlic sauce. So good.

In selecting my entree, I did some wavering. I love duck. Scallops are my favourite sea food. Both were listed on the menu and the descriptions were mouth-watering. But tonight I was in the mood for red meat so I chose the beef Bourguignon. Wow. Absolute comfort food with class and debonaire. Generous portion. Although I tried my best, I could not finish it.

One of those meals I'll be raving about for a long time.

I need to go back for the foie gras."}
{"text":"Whimsical and romantic decor, more on the feminine side. Lots of diners taking photos because of the beautiful space. Cosy like the old Harbord Room. Love the rotating fan on the ceiling and the tasteful table floral. 

Flavour of my scallop entree was great, sauce was perfectly seasoned. Although it was waterier than anticipated, I wanted to drink it all up! Since the scallops were roasted, they weren't as crispy as if it was basted. Side salad was flavourful too! My friend said his burger was only ok but he enjoyed the jumbo fries. 

Service can be improved, she was polite but didn't feel warm. Felt like textbook customer service. Didn't check on our food or our experience, only came by when we tried to get her attention. 

Cafe CanCan is great for various occasions - date, girlfriends' gathering, work lunch and etc. Just needs to step up with genuine care in their service."}
{"text":"I don't get the fuss with this place. I went for brunch and the food was mediocre at best. 
- Ceci et Cela: Just a collection of different things (ie, salmon, avocado, ham, egg, gruyere) that you feel you can throw together yourself since they didn't really do anything special with any of the components
- Bread Pudding French Toast: generous serving, but really dry so that was a waste
- Barry's Burger: tasty, though not distinguishable from any other good burger in the city

Also, the service was subpar when I went. If the best thing I can say about a place is the decor was pretty, it's definitely not worth lining up for in my opinion. So disappointing considering all the hype."}
{"text":"The Harbord Room, which held this sacred space previously, served up the best burger in town and some amazing cocktails.

After eating at Cafe Cancan, I have pretty much forgotten the former place.

They do classic French here and do it well. Escargot, mushroom soup, steak tartare, oysters, you get the idea.

I had a watermelon aperitif cocktail (lower in booze and only 7$) that was amazing.

For my meal I went straight for the steak frites (29$). It was melt-in-your mouth delicious. The frites were great before the dipping sauce made them out-of-this-world.

The 12$ chocolate tart dessert and the 5$ lemon eclair were both off the charts.

A bit more wine (reasonably priced by the way) and conversation and the evening was simply perfect.

This place does have some connection to Piano Piano (which I really like), yet manages to be brilliant on a level that took me by complete surprise.

This will be regarded as one of the best restaurants in town."}
{"text":"I wanted to check this place out after seeing beautiful picture on Instagram by various bloggers.  I walked in with a friend for Sunday brunch and there was a 30 min wait bc we didn't make a reso.  No problem; my fault for not remembering that Sunday brunch is a popular activity. The hostess said they could take down my number and text me when a table was available which I thought was cool.  

When we were sat it was outside on the patio which had a strange smell. But it was cute and the inside was full so we sat down.  Not much variety for milk options for a cafe and our drinks took quite a long time.  It seemed like our server didn't care about us. 

The food was basic and quite expensive for what you get.  I recommend getting the eggs Benedict because it's hard to be disappointed with that since it's a classic.  

There was also a wasp harassing us the whole time."}
{"text":"Food was great. Simple, but prepared expertly. Foie Gras Parfait was a perfect mix of sweet and savoury. Duck Confit was rich and juicy. 

The restaurant space has a quirky, but intimate feel. The pink walls will definitely stick out in my memory!

I was a little worried about the service after reading other reviews, but found all the staff I interacted with to be cheerful and professional. No complaints here!"}
{"text":"Everything was perfect except the price. We got the table right next to the window and the pictures came out great. However, it is a bit pricey for a brunch location."}
{"text":"Omg this cafe is uber cute and instagram heaven for the foodie enthusiasts. I ordered the scallops and salad dish and it was absolutely perfect. Order the Peche et Fleurs to drink. It's got a great mix of flavours with my fav peach flavour. Thanks to the staff for letting us take photos and making sure it was picture perfect hehe"}
{"text":"Victor Barry has done it again! This lovely little french restaurant is exactly what the area needs. It has a colourful atmosphere, wonderfully attentive staff, and great food. Perfect for a drink and some oysters at the bar or a larger meal at one of their tables. I believe that they are planning on serving breakfast/lunch in the near future, and I am really looking forward to coming back.

We enjoyed oysters, the burger, and the steak au poivre, which came with some amazing frites. If I had one criticism it would be that the meat was a bit underdone - not necessarily a problem for me but my dining companion found it to be a little more on the rare side than he had hoped for. Everything we tried was delicious nonetheless! I also found the prices to be quite reasonable, as they are at Piano Piano."}
{"text":"A pretty pink palace fit for a princess, Cafe CanCan is where little girls who die a premature death go to instead of heaven. Just kidding! It's where social media influencers go for Instagram content. 

Of note: if this is your Instagram aesthetic then you should check out True True Pizza on Queen West for some girly Art Deco. 

Alright, so l'll cut to the chase. This is a fairly new cafe and as it is the stuff of girly girl dreams everywhere, especially Tokyo, it's busy AF. Expect to sit at the bar if you don't book a reservation. For some reason this place does reservations even though it's busy as hell and could use its resources way better, but I digress.

As it's a French bistro you're going to want to eat the more traditionally French menu items like French Onion Soup. I went for brunch and had the Madame Croque. It was excellent for the price point. In fact, the prices in general are reasonable here. I definitely recommend checking it out. Make sure to bring your 5 year old niece!"}
{"text":"I ordered the French picnic and it was disappointing for that price ($18). It had smoked salmon, charcuterie, soft boiled egg, avocado, cheese, toast. It looked pretty but didn't satisfy my hungry stomach. It just wasn't my cup of tea. I ate with two other people and they also felt their dishes (different from mine) was only \"okay\". The two stars is for the beautiful atmosphere and decor of the restaurant. Super cute. Love it. I might give this place another chance solely because of how pretty it is."}
{"text":"A great colourful space, brightening up your day, with great French food. Clearly, a restaurateur that knows what they're doing.  
Definitely more on the feminine side, making this place a great spot for a comfortable date.
 
At the time of writing this review, the patio hasn't been opened yet post renovation, but staff claim it will be the best in the city. We'll have to see about that."}
{"text":"The food was reallly good, I've been here for brunch before but it's def not as amazing as their dinner menu 

The fries for the burgers were HUGE and delish, also price isn't unreasonable at all

The foie gras was amazing and the crispy topping 

My dish, the Beef Cheek Bourguignon- super Yum and pretty, the potatoes are fluffy and flavourful also the beef is super tender and flavourful
.
The gnocchi are okay but I didn't find them too amazing compared to the rest of the dishes
."}
{"text":"In summary: beautiful space, good food, extremely underwhelming service.

First: a few days ago the owner (or someone) was delivering a box there, and he decided to park his car in the bike lane. At 9.30am, during rush hour, in one of the busiest bike lanes in the city. Even though there was a laneway literally a few doors down he could have parked in safely and legally. There were like 17 bikes lined up behind him because they couldn't get around. This is a) illegal b) dangerous and c) extremely arrogant behaviour. Lame move, dude.

That attitude kind of sums this place up really. It's very pretty, and the food is thoughtfully done. But as pretty much every other review has noted, the service kind of sucks, mostly because (with a couple of exceptions--there are two really pleasant servers) there is just So. Much. Attitude. From the \"hosts\" who leave you standing at the door for five minutes before you're allowed to sit down, to the barman who sees you waiting there but also decides to ignore you, to the way they look you up and down, to the constant stink eye unless you're spending big bucks - it's just icky. When it's not arrogant, it's inattentive. I was once there when three separate groups were all trying to get the attention of a server, who was too busy talking to her overdressed and overmanicured PR friends and Instagramming their cocktails to notice.

The kitchen turns out decent food; it's a bit pricey, but generally worth it for well-executed French bistro classics. The steak tartare was excellent when I had it. The woodfired oven is a definite bonus. Too bad - the space is so pleasant and the food is good. I would be there all the time if they fixed the staff's attitude problem, but it just taints the whole experience. C'est dommage."}
{"text":"Beautiful place for any brunch date with your girlfriends. I took my girlfriends here because CanCan was getting really popular but unfortunately, our reservation took us to a dingy little hole inside a wall underneath a low dim ceiling, next to their bar. We didn't really get the Instagrammable spots and it was quite stuffy where we were sitting. The food was okay, I got the French Picnic which was an assorted platter of meats, cheeses, toast and other small bites. If you're planning on going here, just make sure you're sitting near the windows or in the open areas instead of where we were."}
{"text":"This restaurant is extremely overrated.
Sure, the walls are painted pink, the decor looks semi nice, but to me this place is not that special. 

It's a tiny restaurant with loud music and mediocre food.
The brunch menu is only available for the weekends.
I came here for lunch and ordered the burger for $18. It tasted just about your average burger at any other restaurant. 

What turned me off though was that the waitress didn't seem like she enjoyed working there. We had to repeatedly ask her to turn down the music and we didn't feel like she cared about the customers much."}
{"text":"The food is decent here. Came here for a late bday brunch. Got the egg Benedict, the beef tartare and a breakfast platter... 

While the presentation and the interior of the restaurant is very pretty, none of the food was very standout and it didn't help that the service wasn't great. Our server did not refill our water or take away any of our plates until we called her over to. 

Glad I came, sad that this replaced the harbord room."}
{"text":"I had the eggs benedict and it was so delicious! Loved everything about this place from the dish I chose to the cute interior of the place, definitely want to go back!"}
{"text":"The French onion soup was fine, and my friend's steak was good.  

But, the burger and fries?  Amazing.  As in another level amazing.

The burger was perfectly cooked, full of flavour, and paired with a freshly baked bun.  The thick cut fries were perfect - crispy on the outside and moist & soft on the inside.  There was also a generous portion of them.

They've redone the old \"Harbord Room\" space in cute, warm, bright colours, so it almost resembles an old school French farmhouse.

The staff are casual and easygoing, without sacrificing efficiency or professionalism."}

\"While many diners visit restaurants to snap Instagram-worthy photos of the décor (and Café Cancan definitely falls into this category), la nourriture was also worth gabbing about. For a space that was aesthetically contemporary, le menu est composé des plats typiques de la gastronomie française, such as escargots ($16), French Onion soup topped with melted gruyère ($16) and steak tartare ($18). A daily three-course 'Neighbourhood Bar Menu' was also available for $39. And, Barry preserved a tradition by keeping The Harbord Room's much-loved Barry's Burger ($22) on the menu.

While the group I was with was tempted to experience the East Coast Oyster Mignonette ($32 for 12 pieces), especially after the server raved about how fresh they were, we were too tempted by the mains. The roasted scallops ($26), a new offering that replaced the sole, was calling my name. The opalescent scallops were plated delicately on a bed of de Puy lentils and sauce normade. One bite confirmed that the lentils had been prepared in a classic French way--aromatics were sautéed and the lentils were simmered until meaty, contributing to the dish's multidimensional flavour profile. It was a generous portion and also came with a side of Cancan salad ($8), a delicious combination of fresh greens and classic vinaigrette that had the perfect level of acidity.\""}
{"text":"We enjoyed the brunch at Cafe CanCan. It's not cheap, but the food is great. I feel like I would have had a better time if I had nothing planned afterward, as service was nonchalant from the time we were seated to when we were paid our bill. We were hoping to check out the back patio, but it was full. Maybe next time! We sat inside, decorations are very girly... my friend who I came with loved the design work. I just came for the food though"}
{"text":"Honestly this is one place that I will NEVER EVER recommend anyone to visit. The food was extremely salty and shit!  toast was extremely burnt for both times & like there's a way to screw that up?? Their french onion soup was made out of pure salt (I know French onion soup is usually salty but this is a whole new level) And the avocado.. please get some fresh avocados alright? I can't even believe the quality of the food.. like the entire time I was just so shocked. And For the price they're charging, it rly shouldn't be this unacceptably bad. And this is not just come from me and my experiences, ppl I know thats been to cancan also HATED the food. Honestly, its just another instagram famous trap."}
{"text":"Our server was amazing. Attentive, friendly but not overbearing in any way. And the food was amazing!"}
{"text":"I dropped by for brunch with my boyfriend on a Saturday around 1pm. I was unable to make reservations a few days earlier so we dropped by at a later time hoping that the morning rush was dying down. We were unable get a table outside where the patio was so we both settled for bar seating inside the restaurant. The restaurant itself has limited seating (maybe around 10-15 tables), so I'm pretty sure there will be long waits during the colder months. 

The decor of Cafe Cancan is very over the top with pink walls and flowery wallpaper. It all works well together and you can see why so many girls will flock this small eatery (myself included, I was drawn to the interior of the restaurant from pictures I saw online). 

Upon sitting down, service was slow from the very beginning. We were given menus by the host and it took us around 20 min to track down a waiter to ask if we could order. The service was shared between 2-3 people and it was very slow to the point where it felt disorganized and confusing. Food came out slow and it took a while for us to track down a waiter who could give us the bill when we were ready to pay (and that waiter took maybe 10 min to give us the bill). Nothing is worse than bad service because even though the food was good, I have mixed feelings about coming back. At one point the head chef, Victor Barry, came by to check on his restaurant. As he was talking to a familiar customer (or friend), he stated that \"there were many Asians here [in the restaurant]\". Although I believe that the comment was intended merely as an observation, I couldn't help but think to myself...did he have to say it out loud a few feet away from my boyfriend and I? (We are both Asian). The restaurant is not a loud place to begin with and is free to whomever would like to dine there. I bet he would not be making a comment like that if the whole place was filled with Caucasians. 

Food wise, I ordered the veggie breakfast sandwich and my boyfriend ordered the petit dejeuner. Both were great and we both finished our plates. 

Overall, good food, pretty decor, but slow service."}
