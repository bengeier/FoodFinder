{"text":"Love the food! And the location! Easy to grab a healthy dinner here before a movie. Highly recommend trying Me Va Me out!"}
{"text":"What can I say- the Laffa and hummus are of very high quality - maybe the best I've had in the city. Also, the service is excellent. I had an issue with an order over foodora that the manager made sure to fix to my liking. It's good to see that they take customer service seriously!"}
{"text":"Excellent falafel. Reasonably priced, fresh ingredients, very clean store. Overall a very good experience."}
{"text":"I had some pretty high expectations for Me Va Me after seeing countless reviewers and friends showing their praise for it. I can say I was definitely not disappointed!

They have a range of options: wraps, salads, mains, drinks, etc. I ended up ordering 1/2 laffa wrap of chicken shawarma with a side of beef soup and with tax, it made it up to about $11. It was delicious and very filling (it doesn't seem like a lot but it's quite a lot). If you choose to get a full laffa wrap....it's huge!

What I love about the laffa wraps is that you get your choice of fillings and sauces!

We also have a side of tahini hummus to share with pita bread and it was soooooo good!

Definitely recommend :)"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to having a late dinner here and all was going well. Ordered the Greek salad, potato wedge and falafel box. Wedges were okay pretty sure they were cooked from frozen as they had a mash potato mouth feel, seasoning was decent though. Greek salad was iceberg lettuce with peppers, onions and a few small black olives (also both the \"me-salad\" and the Greek came with the same vinaigrette). Finally we get to the falafels... Looked pretty great but they were basically chickpea-ran-through-it doughnuts. Wasn't a fan of the taste or texture, soft spongy with that distinct timbit taste. Tahini sauce was runny and flavourless. Maybe I'm being picky as the rest of my table enjoyed their dishes, but I'd rather go to one of a thousand hole in the wall shawarma places than come back here."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best. There are a lot of other middle eastern places with better hummus, falafel in the downtown core."}
{"text":"I LOVE ME-VA-ME, and have been coming here for over a year! Generally, I head up the street once every week or so, and I am never disappointed. Their chicken shawarma laffa wraps are delicious, and I always get a medium hummus and laffa to go, since my boyfriend loves it as well. Admittedly, I am quite \"saucy\" so I find the chicken is always juicy! Sometimes, there is definitely a wait, but it is never over 10 minutes, which is pretty good considering the volume of people there. It is certainly a delicious and healthy meal for lunch or whenever! I have ensured all my co-workers have tried it and they all love it every time too!"}
{"text":"Dinner with my kids on a Thursday night and it was a bit busy.  A little different from the thornhill restaurant since this little diner didn't serve a full menu but the food was just as good.  We had the chicken shwarma on hummus which also came with a pita and it was delicious. I saw the wraps and salads some people ordered and the servings were big...I would not be able to finish it.  The price was not bad for the size of rge food. Order in front and you can chose to eat in or take out.  Place was clean and servers were great.  The service was a little slow though and you will wait a little while for the food to be cooked."}
{"text":"I've been at many me va me locations and enjoyed them. But this location is really beautiful. The food here is great like the others. But the people here seem nicer.  The falafel is crispy and the potato wedges are really nice. I recommend this place."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. The falafel looks great from out side but quite tasteless as it is filled with bread rather than chick peas 
The fries taste like they are made from frozen processed potatoes rather than real potatoes 
Great brand that chose the cost cutting path making cheap tasteless 
food :-( too bad"}
{"text":"Delicious. Fresh. Healthy. Had a chicken skewer, two actually, and a salad. Loved it! Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"the best baba ganoush in downtown!!! reasonable price, nice place, clean kitchen and fast order!"}
{"text":"A friend invited me for dinner at Me Va Me Express, knowing how much I love Israeli food. But what a disappointment. 
I had the hummus plate, with a serving of falafel balls, pickles and pita bread. 
The hummus was the industrial type - like the cheap brand you can get in your local supermarket. 
The falafel balls were also sub-par. Where they pre-cooked? previously frozen? falafel balls should not be so compact and solid!. 
And the pita bread - oh the pita bread. I was just in Israel a few weeks ago, so can testify first hand that such inferior laffa bread is not to be found there.
At least the pickles were serviceable. 
The only reason for giving this restaurant a second star is the lovely staff. They were very nice (and frankly, the poor quality food was not their fault). 
What a poor representation of Israeli food."}
{"text":"I had always been loving food here since my mum often bought home for us, till the actual visiting, I was disappointed with their service. The lady at the counter should learn more patient with customers. I saw her almost got mad at a little girl  confused with her orders and could not tell what she wanted. 
The price is fairly high in general though the food is quite good. Trendy decor and an eye-catching window display, lively food counter that you can see all the food preparation.
But again, a bunch of mediterranean restaurant out there with better service to be desire."}
{"text":"The food is amazing place is clean and great service! We have been there few times for dinner always satisfied!"}
{"text":"This place has such good wraps 

I recommend the chicken schnitzel or falafel wrap. The laffa is made to order and the ingredients are always fresh

the baba ganoush is addictive as is the creamy cabbage

I love the fried eggplant and onion in tomato sauce you can buy there as well

its probably the best hummus ive every had too  

I didnt give it 5 stars because the wait can be quite slow sometimes"}
{"text":"Pretty low on the value scale -- expensive for what I ordered (fried chicken, french fries, salad), and the food is just mediocre. Plus, no full service. What am I paying so much for? Would rather go to a fast food joint to get served fast food."}
{"text":"So stopped in to try it out since my business is right next door. The service was really great. The food was delicious and very flavourful! I bought the chicken breast laffa. Extremely healthy, the cabbage was awesome and of course the hummus! :) plus I got chips on the sides. The chips were KILLER!!!! Highly recommended :)"}
{"text":"This Me Va Me is great! My husband and I go here all the time - can't get enough. The owner and the staff are all so nice. They have wine and beer now too :)"}
{"text":"We ate here when it first opened.  We had lafa falafel.   The pita was awesome.  Freshly baked.  Crunchy on the outside moist and chewy inside.  Yum.  The sides and dressing were very good too.  Fresh and very tasty.  Just like their restaurant location in Thorn hill.  BUT THE SECOND TIME AROUND, THE THIRD TIME AROUND were not as good as when they first opened.  Ordered the same wraps and they were just ok tasting and the quality from the first time they opened was not there anymore.  Too bad.  But I still go to their Thornhill restaurant and everything there is good."}
{"text":"This place offers really tasty food. I usually order through a lunch time pre-order app and it's always made fresh with generous portions. I usually get the lamb kebab or the falafel, think most of the meals can be ordered with rice, fries, salad or grilled veg."}
{"text":"Who can say no to hummus and laffa bread? A coworker told me about this recently opened joint. There are a couple that I past by before in the suburbs, but never really gave it a thought to try.

We went at around 12:30 which is dead of lunch hour, so the line up was practically out the door. They have an open concept kitchen and you can see the laffa bread being made while you wait which was pretty unique. They are pretty quick with taking the orders and prepping the food, so our wait was about 10 mins. I order the hummus plate (~$6) while the others got the mushroom on hummus (~$8), chicken shawarma on hummus (~$9) and grill lamb stick wrap (~$8).

There is a lot of seating at the back and has a nice contemporary decor, not your typical express lunch place. My only complaint is that I wish they provided more laffa bread for the amount of hummus that they gave. 

Keep in mind though, because this is an express not all things on the menu online are offered (eg: lamb burger)."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent.  Everything on the menu is fantastic.

The staff are friendly, but the restaurant itself is always dirty.

I always get takeout because it's not a nice place to sit. 

Needs to be redecorated inside and kept clean."}
{"text":"This is my go to place downtown for middle eastern food. The Laffa wraps are made in clay ovens located at the front of the store.
I always order the chicken wrap however you could order a half wrap with a side of salad. 
The sauces and toppings are to die for. The flavours melt into your mouth. The humus is fresh and to die for. 
Everything tastes authentic and fresh.
The restaurant is cafeteria style. Order and take a number. You take a seat and they bring the food to you.
The fresh mint lemonade Lemonana is amazing. 
There is also prepared items you can buy to take out (humus etc). 
You can't go wrong with anything on the me menu. 
Place is modern and clean. Staff is friendly.
Highly recommend this place. Too bad they don't have more locations downtown."}
{"text":"Me Va Me is the best place to get healthy, hearty meal, prepared fresh in front of you from the best ingredients. Their portions are very generous.... And the value for money is unbeatable! 

They have very efficient and fast service be it a take-out order or dine-in. The place itself is very spacious and has a modern feel to it. There are always tables available and there is a nice area right by the counters with high bar tables where you can comfortable wait for your take-out order while watching some TV..

They have a great selection for the sides with a Box meal and you also get their signature Laffa bread with your order. 

They have recently added a great selection of Ontario wines on tap which are priced very reasonable and pair very well with their selection of meats and seafood."}
{"text":"In-house made bread, lot of sauces to choose from and huge portion. New decor and clean kitchen. Very busy during lunch hour."}
{"text":"Ordered the falafel wrap. All the ingredients were super fresh, falafels were made to order. They were very generous with the toppings which resulted in the largest wrap I've ever seen. Bigger than my forearm!"}
{"text":"Stopped here after the place we planned to eat at was packed. I ordered the chicken schnitzel box with veggies. Delicious!!! The veggies were fresh and chicken was flavourful. Sauces that came with it were nice as well. The ambience is modern and not ur typical take out place. Friends ordered the wrap and they were rewarded with some pretty big and loaded with goodness wraps. We had to do take out containers."}
{"text":"Their appetizers are AMAZING, specially, baba ganug and labbnah. The laffah bread is so soft and delicious."}
{"text":"Busy place on Queen West for lunch. The bad was that the service was slow, and it took me about 25 minutes from lining up to receiving my food on a Thursday at lunch. People who got a wrap seemed to be served faster. However, the meal was great, chicken was tender, vegetables were fresh and the bread (Laffa) was fresh and delicious. Large area in the back to eat was also nice.

I'd recommend if you're in the area and looking for a more premium Mediterranean option, but do be prepared to wait."}
{"text":"Surprised by the mediocre reviews.

We had a book club event here in November 2016 and everyone enjoyed themselves and the food. It is awhile ago, so unfortunately I don't recall too much, but it was a good enough experience that I would could back.

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"Great food.  We ordered the chicken shawarma and the beef kebabs. The chicken and beef were very flavorful.  The service was great.  Our only complaint was that the portion size for the beef kebabs were small and the side of potatoes that we ordered were a little old... could be because we came in at 10:00pm at night."}
{"text":"Great little spot, 2nd time here so they must be doing something right. I love being able to watch my food being made and plated with care. 

Place is quiet and clean."}
{"text":"Ask me 6 months ago and I would have given this place 5 stars for their laffa wraps. They used to be so big and very tasty. I was going on a bi-weekly basis for almost a year. 
Fast forward a few months and they've increased their prices and taken away the babaganoush as an included topping. 

The place is still great but the price increase and topping restriction has left a bad taste in my mouth.

Chicken Shwarma, falafel, and chicken schnitzel are my go tos."}
{"text":"Went in for the first time today and got a Greek salad with added chicken breast skewers. The salad is all iceberg lettuce, but good feta and decent dressing. The chicken was nice and came separately on little skewers. BUT for the price, it's too much. $12 for an iceberg lettuce salad with (small) chicken skewers is too much, that's for sure. I'll go back for shawarma since it looked amazing and I've only heard good things."}
{"text":"The place is new and could still be trying to work out it's kinks, but this me va me express kitchen does not live up to its predecessors. We tried to ordered chicken shawarma and hummus and the beef skewer dinner and suffered a severe disappointment when told they had run out of chicken shawarma at 8pm on a Saturday night! Opting to just get the hummus and the beef skewer dinner, only the beef skewer lived up to expectations and were tender and juicy. The side salad and potatoes were adequate. The hummus tasted like it had been sitting out for too long and had developed a shell. Laffa bread cooked fresh on site comes with our orders but doesn't have the fluffiness that we had expected, and oddly did not even taste like it was freshly made. 

The place is meant to be no frills with customers placing orders at the front then servers bringing the food to you similar to panera bread. Service was fine but like the food feels like the training wheels have not yet come off. 

I might come back and try it again given some time, but for now, it's worth the longer drive to Bathurst and Steeles to go to the original restaurant."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and attentive. The menu has plenty of choices and because they make the food fresh you can ask to add or remove ingredients from your salads and other dishes. My husband and I ordered a box meal and a quinoa salad and both tasted good. We also decided to order a side of French fries and they were really good and a large portion."}
{"text":"Good food, but really disappointed by their inconsistency... Their sign clearly indicates that they are open 11am-11pm and the last 3 times I have gone all WELL before 11pm, most recently 10:15, they were closed and the staff inside would not let me in or serve me. For a new business, that is really poor customer service. Staff making single tear gestures, through the window when they close before indicated hours? Bad business practice plain and simple. Definitely will not return based on service alone."}
{"text":"Got some takeout from here on a Tuesday night. Ordered two boxes. One was grilled chicken and the other chicken shawarma. They only provided the white sauce for one meal and not both, got home before I realized, so wasn't too happy about that, but for the most part everything was delicious and service was ok."}
{"text":"The quality of the food was very good, the portions were generous and the ambience was friendly, clean and comfortable. I will probably come back here. More than once."}
{"text":"Oh goodness! The dips are amazing. There are fancy, sit down, servers and wine middle eastern restaurants serving dips that would cower in fear if these awesome dips ever approached their homes. The schnitzel laffa wrap is one of my all time favourite meat in flat bread wrap deals. The hummus with meat is very tasty. The food is reasonably priced and you can get a brew or a wine and they bring it right over. People need to start hitting this place up before the movies at Scotia bank or the Bell Lightbox. It is the best."}
{"text":"I am following up on my original review - went again with my gf and had their lamb. My gf had a massive filled laffa. Both absolutely delicious. Even though it doesn't match the amazing original place - it is still a great place to eat. Would always come back here. Also enjoying the nice clean eating area and flavour - so giving it the fully deserved 5 stars..."}
{"text":"A falafel joint that serves booze. Awesome. Falafel is made at the time, not sitting in a pan waiting for the next customer. Many options to put on your lafa bread. Tasty. Good service. Place is clean and would be good lunch spot with friends on busy Queen West."}
{"text":"Ordered the falafel laffa wrap through food.ee. It was delicious, and so large that even though I would have loved to finish it, I couldn't."}
{"text":"Excellent food and a lot of food for a reasonable price. Got shwarma on hummus and I'm stuffed. Super friendly service."}
{"text":"Delicious. Must try the hummus. Lots of comfy seating. Very friendly and accommodating service. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"At first glance you wouldnt think its food related until you see the words \"express kitchen\" but even then you cant tell what kind of cuisine they offer until youre inside (or if you happen to glance at the menu thats hung outside).

The decor is alright, but certainly doesnt feel like youre in a Mediterranean/Middle Eastern restaurant.  
In fact, the deeper you go inside the more you feel like youre at a bar or lounge. 

The menu is nice on the eyes and easy to read. Pretty straightforward food selection.

The food itself though was mediocre. We ordered 2 sandwiches (falafel and chicken breast) and in both instances there was wayyy too much sauce covering the protein items. Some parts of the sandwich were warm and other parts were cold. Halfway through,  the bread started to fall off and sauce dripped everywhere. The chicken was greasy and the falafel was dry. We couldnt even finish the whole thing! Theyre overly generous with the food portions to the extent that the sandwich was just not made right. The first 4 bites consisted of cabbage and sweet sauce. The tahini sauce they used was VERY sweet! (is it even tahini at this point?). As for the bread itself it looks and tastes good but its way too big and disproportionate to the ingredients included. Youll be bloated halfway through from all the carbs.

Their drink selection is also mediocre (pop and vitamin water) and certainly doesnt fit the atmosphere/vibe this place is trying to give off. 

To top it off I ordered chips with my meal but they never came. Note that the food was bought to our table twice by the same employee and he never mentioned the missing order once.

The icing on the cake is when one of the workers who made our sandwiches asked us at the end \"how was it?\" And when we replied \"nothing special\" he proceeds to tell us \"if you come back next time well make it proper\"... Extremely unprofessional. We certainly wont be visiting again. I give this place another 10 months before it goes under."}
{"text":"New location on Queen Street - Great for busy working people to grab a quick bite with option of dining in (plenty of seating available!)

They give generous portions, so come in hungry. I usually order the chicken shwarma plate that comes with laffa bread on the side. The salad is very fresh but a little bit too much feta cheese for my preference. 

Service is a bit snappy during the lunch rush. I get it, seeing a lineup all of a sudden can be stressful. 

Overall, this is a great place for a quick bite. I will certainly back when I need a shwarma fix!"}
{"text":"One of the freshest, healthiest and  tastiest meal I've had in a while.  Everything is very fresh, and they have the best hummus, and to top it of the best laffa bread.  I usually order to go, but, I have stayed in and enjoyed some of their wine on draft, great service."}
{"text":"If you're used to the uptown location, prepare to be disappointed! Poor service (incredibly slow with only 3 in line), a different menu than uptown (missing done of the best items like fried eggplant and other pita toppings). They messed up our order and the owner or manager was yelling loudly and openly at the cook right in front of us...awkward! Seriously disappointing. I wouldn't go again unless they make some changes. I'd rather drive to their uptown location."}
{"text":"Just for laffa!

The lamb burger laffa sandwich to be exact.
This is their most popular sandwich for a reason.
The lamb was juicy and full of flavour.  The bread was chewy and soft.
Fresh vegetables smothered in garlic and tahini sauce.
I loved my sandwich and even though I was full with half a sandwich, I just kept eating!

I'll definitely be back for hummus!"}
{"text":"Can be a challenge to find a healthy and reasonably priced meal to have near the Scotiabank Theatre. This is not a fast prepared meal but one that was quite good.  Had the lamb laffa wrap with a side green salad. Beautiful presentation and delicious.  Will return."}
{"text":"Having tried the location at Bathurst and Steeles for years I was excited to try out this express version of the store.  It's located at the heart of Markham's new downtown, still under construction.

It's a lot more sophisticated with a lounge atmosphere and a walk up order menu allowing you to order and sit down with your Panera-style buzzer without waiting.

Food options are what you expect. I ordered the baba ghanoush dip which came with flatbed and a pint of Steam Whistle.

Unfortunately I got ill after this meal so I can't recommend the health safety of this place. It's a shame as I love the original location and I can't imagine any problems with freshness and preparation of food there.  Hopefully they send someone in to train the staff on proper food handling."}
{"text":"Despite the good reviews our experience was disappointing. An foul odour permeated the restaurant and only through our insistance did the door to the back kitchen close which led to a reduction of it. I can only guess what was going on back there.

The falafel plate my girlfriend ordered had a long curly hair in the rice portion. Being a good sport she only requested to have the rice exchanged. Another bite into the falafel balls and there was another hair. We didn't bother asking for another exchange for it seems like the kitchen hand simply doesn't wear hairnets. I only finished my meal out of habit: I don't waste my food. 

To add to the experience. The faucet in the men's washroom wasn't working. So no washing hands after your business. Would the waiters go the kitchen to clean before they hand you your plate or fork? I doubt it.

The cleanliness of floor corners, seats, table edges leave much to be desired. If you value hygiene in your food. Maybe try elsewhere."}
{"text":"On a non busy day their service and food is good, but don't count on coming here for a pre movie meal on Saturday night.  They ran out of chicken shawarma, one if the main menue items, and the cashier said it would take 40 mins for a new batch.  You'd expect them to be more prepared in the kitchen for a Sat night.  We decided to eat elsewhere after lining up for 10 mins."}
{"text":"I always thought this was a Chinese or Vietnamese restaurant just purely based on the name. Boy was I wrong and was it one of the best Middle Eastern restaurants I have eaten at in Toronto. It is a fast casual restaurant and is very efficient. The decor reflects the city with a map of the TTC and other images. The service was impeccable despite no tipping option if paying by  credit card.

We ordered the chicken shawarma on hummus and the lamb sausage main meal.   The food came out within 10 minutes and every aspect of it was made by hand including the BBQ and spicy sauces.  For the chicken dish, the chicken was very juicy and tasty. The hummus was delicious and not too garlicky. For the lamb kebab meal, it came with 3 lamb sausages, a salad and a choice of another side (we chose potato wedges with garlic and dill).   The lamb was very aromatic and I could taste all of the herbs and spices.  The potatos wedges were perfectly fried and was not too salty. The dill and garlic added a nice kick to it. The salad was fresh and crispy.

I do not give a lot of 5 stars, but this place really hit all of the right spots."}
{"text":"Having been a fan of Me Va Me since the old days on Steeles Ave, I just had to try out this new Express location. I ordered my favourite, the Chicken Shawarma, and had it to go. It was quite delicious, full of the flavours that I remember and love. The wrap was slightly on the chewier side, so if you get jaw pains from chewing too much, you might want to take a back seat on this one. 

There was a lot on the menu and I was looking for a quick shawarma (the sign says express, right?) so I didn't get adventurous and order anything else. I liked that they had a little refrigerated section where you can buy containers of dips, like baba ganoush and hummus. 

The decor is very open, upscale-looking, and I can understand why (because of the area). But honestly, for an express place, it should be necessary, and would probably have saved the establishment a lot of money. But it IS nice, comfortable, and the washrooms are squeeky clean. 

Lastly, seeing the wraps being made fresh and witnessing them slapping the dough into the bucket-like ovens is really cool."}
{"text":"wednesday 8:30pm grabbed takeout for a quick dinner, we had the laffa with grilled chicken breast special ($9.95)and a side order of falafel($5.95). the falafel was great what you would expect falafel to be. The \"star\" of the show laffa was such garbage burnt chicken breast pieces and the bread was so chewy han solo tried to get it on the millennium falcon.... but really i only ate half and threw the rest in the trash it was like chewing on leather with the taste of burnt chicken. On the up side the staff was friendly but if you are planning on eating here prepare to take a L and that doesn't stand for laffa"}
{"text":"Never disappointed...as a vegetarian this place fills my belly with delicious falafel, sautee veggies and laffa."}
{"text":"What an improvement in the line up... Although still lots of people but instructions are very clear, not as congested as before.  Speedy service with the cashier.  Food quality still good!!!"}
{"text":"I used to live in an area with a tonne of middle eastern food and me va me was nothing special, so when it opened down here, I wasn't super excited. 
This location PROVED ME WRONG. 
1.The food is delicious and fresh. You can see the kitchen at work and that fresh laffa bread? Oh man.
2. The menu! It's different from other locations and very catered to the neighbourhood. There are amazing combos for great prices (re: \"The Box\" and the \"Half Wrap Combo) and the falafel laffa wrap... stupid good.
3. The staff. They're so friendly and you can sense their pride in their restaurant. 

It's nice and new, order at the front and grab a seat type of place. Great for quick takeout, but I've dined in often and it's a good spot."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my chicken shawarma dinner box with baba ganoush and laffa bread. 
As always, I get the regular me va me salad with garlic and herb potatoes. 
Service was on point. Portion was generous. 
Restaurant was quiet for a Friday night so it was a very enjoyable dinner."}
{"text":"I ordered take-out for 2 shawarmas at 5:30pm. Order finally came around 5:50. I assume it took a while just bc of the chicken, so that's understandable. Overall the service was prompt and efficient, staff were friendly and the wraps were delicious, had a good amount of meat and vegetables (personally I like more veggies), however the only thing I didn't like was when I brought the food home, the different wraps weren't labeled which was which, so it was a tad difficult to sort that out in the end. Overall, I'd say take out is your best bet during a relatively calm period, when you can afford some patience into your life =p =)"}
{"text":"The girl at the counter was VERY kind and friendly. Superb customer service. I ordered a half falafel Laffa wrap with a house salad. Took about a ten minute wait, which is fine, but the guys working in the kitchen looked exceptionally confused the whole time and I don't know why they were so flustered, there wasn't more than ten people in the restaurant. 

I didn't mind the wrap but I think the Laffa bread is too thick for my liking. I prefer thin pita bread. This was more like a naan. However it is very filling and depending on preference I'm sure some people will really like it. I just think they get away with less actual filling this way. Additionally, I found the bread was quite dry - probably wasn't from a fresh batch. 

Nice to see that they offered Amba (pickled mango) - you've gotta try this in your wrap next time!

I'll come back but would like to try their meals instead next time."}
{"text":"The Chicken Shawarma at Me Va Me was great. Almost perfect if not for, what I thought, was under flavoured chicken. Despite that, the pita bread was delicious and the vegetables were nice and fresh. In particular I enjoyed the red cabbage slaw in the sandwich, which I've not really seen in a shawarma.

In terms of pricing, I initially thought it was an absurd amount for a single sandwich. Upon receiving the wrap however, I could see that portion sizes were huge and these were not your typical $6-8 shawarma wraps.

To speak about service, the staff were very nice and responsive. The manager even asked how the meal was as he passed by. Additionally, staff did a good job at keeping the space clean and tidy.

Will definitely eat at Me Va Me again in the future."}
{"text":"I was introduced to their original location by a neighbor who is from the region. Always looking for authentic food I quite enjoyed their restaurant which has a more formal setting and menu to match. I had never tried their Express location beforehand though so was looking forward to trying this spot.
The place is clean and airy and even has a patio on the side. Menu is a bit limited as it is supposedly a quick grab and go food. Alas I was not expecting that won't have the Jerusalem Mix on sale here as mentioned by a Yelper in the review. Ah well. I ordered the Box combo and chose the Chicken Shewarma, Mesalad and fries. I am not a big salad eater so won't review it though it did look fresh. The fries were so so. The Chicken Shewarma was good. Nice moist pieces of chicken and not overly cooked which is a recurring issue for this dish IMO. The sauce added to flavor as well. Decent stuff here. I would say 3 stars but have to give Kudos for the immaculate service. I was consistently checked upon and water was refilled without asking and even inquired about my meal. I wouldn't expect this level of service in this price range. An extra star for the well trained and polite staff. Will be back for sure.
Minor update the Baba Ganough is very good and creamy. Would make for a great dip at a party. Also worth a mention are the pan fried chips which are great when fried fresh."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto visiting for a work trip and I'm so glad I grabbed a meal here. This is legit Mediterranean food and the service is outstanding. If you've ever had legit laffa, shawarma, and amba, and need it in your life -- come here. 
The service is outstanding. I was welcomed and given a tour of the menu and you can tell they are passionate about what they prepare for customers.
They prepare their laffa here every day, everything I tried
If I'm in Toronto again, I will for sure come here again!"}
{"text":"Great portions, tasty food and overall great service. They definitely know what they're doing here. The hummus could use a little work, but other than that, it's an incredible place for dine in and take out."}
{"text":"For a restaraunt where the premise seems to be fast food we had an excellent meal. Going in with a friend of mine I ordered a chicken schwarma. My friend ordered the falafel salad set. This was our first time coming here. The restaraunt is well designed with comfortable seating. We took our order and got an indicator for the server to bring us our meal which was quick and easy.

The food itself was great. The chicken schwarma was delicious. My friend, being a newbie to mediteranean food asked the server for suggestions. He thoroughly enjoyed the falafel salad which was suggested to him. Overall it was a good experience. I may seem a tad pricy but I belive it was worth the visit."}
{"text":"It's been years since I lived uptown and eaten at the Bathurst restaurant.  When I walked by and saw the signage a few months ago, I was so excited for the new downtown location.

Two of us ordered one laffa with the Jerusalem mix and a side of chips.  This was enough for two people to share as a snack or a light meal (it's a very healthy portion for one).  I noticed the plates were very generous as well.  I really liked the freshly fried potato chips!  Yum!

A couple of things to note:  
The wrap was a little too soggy.  Too much liquid was drawn when the peppers were added.  Also, the layer of waxed paper was stuck to the laffa (due to the drippy factor) which made it difficult to eat.  

Overall, for the price, freshness, and taste, this place is a welcome addition to Queen West.  You have the choice to grab your food and go, or find a seat in the back where there are large communal tables and a few booths.

The ordering process is a bit confusing due to the lack of space.  After you place your order, you pay, get your receipt and wait for your number to be called.  Don't go too far or you won't hear your number.  They do have a speaker system which they used only once, but how annoying would that get if they had to announce each and every number throughout the whole restaurant?

BTW:  You get to watch the laffas being made in the front window.  Nice!"}
{"text":"An Upscale Middle Eastern eatery (Israeli to be exact) this is a downtown outpost of North York Eatery I went to way back in the day. I have fond memories of their roasted eggplant dip, which unfortunately they don't do downtown. They do however offer massive plates of Israeli style Schnitzel and other Fare from the region. 

The Schnitzel plate came with lots of hummus and tahini as well as massive laffa bread for dipping. Fairly pricey compared to other mid east type joints but good taste and a lot of food!"}
{"text":"I'm on the fence about this one (between 3 and 4 stars) but since I'd be willing to go back and try more, I'll give it a full four with the promise of an update when I do go back.

Had a \"Jerusalem mix\" laffa sandwich, which is chicken heats and liver.  Liked the meats and topping, but my laffa fell apart after only three bites, which is pretty disappointing.  (I have eaten laffa before in Israel, so I swear it wasn't my fault!)  Liked the set-up, felt like dining at a restaurant and not cafeteria style, but would maybe go without the laffa next time."}

{"text":"Everything was fantastic and well priced. Schawarma were excellent, spicy and authentic but with a flavor unique to Me Va Me. Definitely recommend the triple dip plate with in house Hummus, labaneh za'atar and incredible fresh, fragrant baba ghanouj. Great atmosphere,  staff is super friendly and attentive without being pushy. The restaurant itself is nice and modern and clean with great facilities. Treat yourself to some of the best middle eastern food in downtown Toronto!"}
{"text":"In the same building as the Cineplex Markham & VIP theatre, Me Va Me is a convenient place to grab a bite before or after a movie. 

The restaurant is pretty nice. It's clean, comfortable, and sleek. The food is pretty good too. 

I ordered \"The Box\". You pick a protein, a side, and a salad. I ordered the chicken shawarma, grilled vegetables, and their \"Me\" salad (the only salad you don't have to pay extra for). The vegetables were average; I'm not really into really hard carrots. The salad was average as well. The chicken looked kind of dry, but it turned out okay and was pretty flavourful. They also give you a pita, I'm assuming for you to assemble your own wrapped shawarma. I didn't really understand that. I feel like it's just too much work for the average person. As a whole, the box was good. It was just too expensive at $16.90 after tax.

The best part of the meal was the service. Everyone we encountered was super friendly. They checked on us two, three times and let my friend know her food was coming and apologized for the wait even though we hadn't waited that long. 

I guess it's not a bad place to visit if you want a convenient pre/post-movie meal, but it's pricey and there's plenty of food nearby around Warden & Birchmount."}
{"text":"Me Va Me seems to be the fan favourite when it comes to Middle-Eastern fare. If you were to ask someone who is South Asian or Middle-Eastern their opinion, they might direct you elsewhere (e.g. Paramount), but I have no real qualms with Me Va Me. It's expensive ($21.95 for a salmon skewer box makes is not easy on a lunch budget) but the quality is great if you pick the right items. I've dabbled in many of its choices - the Moroccan cigars (which are so named for their shape - not a cigarette but more of a fried roll), the falafel, and two variations of the chicken skewers box (grilled vegetables or rice) and most recently, the chicken shawarma. The first two items were not as memorable but I have to say the chicken is great - tender, moist and brilliant when paired with the rice (if you are willing to spoil yourself with white rice!). The grilled vegetables aren't a bad alternative when in pursuit of a healthier option. My friend thought it was dry but I thought it was quite nice. I've ordered it several times and will likely continue if I have the chance! The shawarma was okay - not the best I've had (pro tip: if you're ever in Europe, find a hole-in-the-wall shawarma place and prepare to be kind-blown for 5), but not poor either. What Me Va Me does better than anyone else in my opinion is hummus. This is easily the best hummus I've ever had and I have recommended it to friends aplenty, none of which have returned displeased. It's so creamy and flavourful. The tahini sauce is also resplendent (and similar in flavour profile to the hummus). If anything, I will try to come back again and again for these two - they're simply fantastic."}
{"text":"I've liked Ma Va Me for years, but always knew it as a sit down or take away spot north of the city (similar to Dr. Laffa). I was please that this middle eastern resto opened up downtown a few years back; it's a great bet for delivery or takeaway. 

Often when I use a service like Uber eats, I am shocked at how much it ends up costing when you add up everything. Yet, when you order from MVM you are getting value for your money. The portions are generous; the food is flavourful and filling, and everything is pretty fresh. It's also pretty well priced to begin with; this is everyday fare after all. Big win!

Highlights: REAL hummus - not the meh stuff that you buy in the store. It tastes like it does in Israel and is creamier with a nice dose of tahini. I typically include a container in my orders (5.95) so that we have it in the fridge for the week. 

I haven't had a fail with anything yet. Love the dips (labneh + zatar, real hummus, baba ganoush etc.); the wraps (made on laffa bread); chicken skewers and Greek salad."}
{"text":"I've come here a couple times with my coworkers. They really love it. I like it okay. I find that the wait is a bit long for what you're getting (mostly salads and laffas). The first time I came here, I had the chicken schnitzel laffa. It tasted fantastic, but I'm concerned that there's some dairy in there because my stomach was upset right after. Or maybe I'm not supposed to eat an entire laffa in 5 minutes.

The second time I had the box: falafel, ME salad and roasted veggies. This was an insane amount of food. The falafel was very good... crispy and savoury. The roasted veggies were a little on the oily side and kind of heavy on carrots and onions (the most boring of the roasted veggies, in my opinion). The salad was good. 

It's a solid place for lunch, with a very clean, modern atmosphere."}
{"text":"It's 1:30 am and despite seeing the amazing Jungle Book movie, I'm still annoyed by the pattern of bad experiences at Me Va Me in the Markham movie theatre. Falafel is a serious matter.

When my falafel cravings hit, they hit me hard. Even if it means coming to a restaurant with consistently bad service for a 3rd time. 

I'll start with this, the falafel is average, not the best I have had, but not the worst either. I assumed the first experience where my order was overlooked was isolated but I now realize this should be expected. 

Let's keep in mind, I always ensure I ask how long the order will take and I'm always told 10 minutes for falafel - most people have a movie to catch afterwards. All 3 of my visits resulted in my order being passed over, taking well over 25 min (for a TAKEOUT sandwich order) and admittance of a wrong doing from a staff member, which I appreciate...though I appreciate decent service more. 

After the 15 minute mark of waiting, I approach a staff member and inquire about my place in the queue. The response is \"your order is being worked on\".. If that means 10-15 additional minutes of waiting and hearing the kitchen staff say \"we should really make the falafel wrap, she's been waiting a while\" ... then, sure, my order is \"being worked on.\" 

From previous comments, it appears management advises customers to order falafel if they want quick service - third times supposed to be a charm, but that didn't happen for me.

Me Va Me has dissappointed me enough to fight my next pre-movie falafel craving and eat the less appetizing express thai food, burgers, or God forbid, subway. I pray better options open up in or around the movie theatre, I'd hate to eat from Outtakes. 

I should also note I recieve a noticeable amount of attitude from some of the staff who take orders at the cash. The young kids who wipe down the cutlery and bag the takeout orders are peaches, though."}
{"text":"Went to the one in Markham and what a disappointment. It didn't same taste the same as the Queen St location. The reason I gave 2 stars as the sandwich was good but the boxes we ordered were just not good. The chicken shawarma was not flavourful, the bread that came with it could be cooked better. The owner was nice. He came over to check on us so I hope the food gets better."}
{"text":"Excellent food tasted fresh and delicious. Service was good after ordering. Water is provided at the table."}
{"text":"On Foodora, they charge an extra $5 on all their boxes. At first I was wondering how a place could charge $20 for shawarma when most of the competition is offering for around $10. Then I looked at the menus and noticed the difference. I noticed my previous review was $17 for the lamb box. Well, now it's $20 as well.

I suppose it is the cost of convenience, but the food gets cold and dry by the time it arrives, and the amount you get is pretty small as well.

I'm more surprised that  when you order their box set, \"rice\" is considered a side. Like, really? At least add some flavor to the rice if you're going to do that."}
{"text":"Food is 4.5/5 stars- it is consistent and delicious! Unfortunately, this spot's service used to be a lot better than it is now. Don't think of this restaurant as fast food- it's really just sit down service without the tips. The chicken shwarma is always amazing, I would recommend getting that protein for both the wrap and in the hummus. I've tried the wraps, salads, hummus dishes and some of the hot and crispy snacks and none of them have disappointed! It's also quiet most of the time so it's nice to sit down and talk here. Convenient location and good food!"}
{"text":"Following a recommendation of a native Toronto resident, I came here to check out some local eats.  I ordered the half laffa wrap with falafel and half salad (can also get soup), for $10.45.  I ordered the Greek salad, which I am disappointed to say looked like iceberg lettuce, although I guess there could also have been some hearts of romaine.   The wrap had great flavor, however I confess that I have never had authentic laffa great but this version was less fluffy and chewy than I have had in the past, which I prefer (in Santa Monica, CA). It is freshly made, like a chewy pita, so perhaps some people would like this thinner version. Either way, I enjoyed my lunch and the toppings went well together, with delicious creamy garlic sauce, hot sauce, and tzatziki."}
{"text":"2.5 stars for food alone, rounding up to 3 stars cause the service here is awesome.

Got the falafel laffa wrap with all fillings, and the tahini and tzatziki sauce. I think each component of the wrap was good individually, but I wasn't big on how it all came together. Ratio of laffa to filling was too much (had lots of extra laffa), and there wasn't enough sauce. My friend's chicken breast was also charred. The falafel wrap came out to over $10, and although the wrap was big and filling, I think there are tastier and cheaper options nearby."}
{"text":"This is not exactly another Shawarma place, quality of food is really amazing all ingredients are fresh, their grilled veggies for example was not precooked. However the food is on the oily side.

I have tried chicken kebob and schnitzel, both amazing. Food portion is huge, however it is not cheap and you pay 16$ for a dish with two sides.

Overall I suggest this place, oh I forgot the pita, they bake it right there fresh out of their cool oven."}
{"text":"The chicken shawarma 1/2 Laffa Wrap was gigantic!  Their wrap itself is the size of my face probably and it was so soft and doughy.  It was perfect!  You could choose what toppings you wanted on your wrap as well as the sauce.  I chose the tzatziki sauce and creamy garlic and all of the toppings they had (red cabbage, hummus, sliced tomatoes, turnips, salad mix, dill pickles, and onion herb mix).  It was so large but I was able to eat it with everything under control for the most part (not too messy).  I found that there was so many more veggies than actual chicken shawarma actually.  The chicken itself was very good and juicy.  I also liked how they put a lot of sauce on top of it.  Some people might not like it because it might be too runny for them, but it made the entire wrap juicy and not dry at all."}
{"text":"Very Classy Mediterranean Restaurant!

Vegetarian Paradise... 

Cosy Seating and relaxed environment.

Would go back again!

Ideal for an Office Group or a Casual outing too.."}
{"text":"Me va me has always been a go-to for me, whenever I'm looking for good Mediterranean! 

I always get the chicken schwarma box ($15) with side of potatoes and me salad, and this is enough for two people! The dill potatoes are so good, and they definitely give you a huge portion of it here.

I've always heard good things about their hummus, never tried it myself but will definitely try it next time!"}
{"text":"To be fair, I actually really like this chain but I'm going back a million years with their first location at Bathurst and Steeles. 

I was catching a movie last night and stopped here for the first time for a quick dinner (before finally seeing Star Wars - I wish yelp would also let me review movies)...

I had to Chicken Shwarma box - it comes with a side and salad. 

1) It's expensive for what you actually got. I was with a friend and we paid close to $40 for 2 boxes... It would have been so much cheaper at another Mediterranean place.
2) Chicken Shwarma wasn't juicy. It was dry and had a strange spice in it that I don't remember shwarma having but it could be a different recipe.
3) Their potatoes with lemon and dill is deep fried - I learnt the hard way... And eat them quickly, otherwise they get awful cold.
4) I paid extra for Greek Salad, an extra dollar and all it came with was iceberg lettuce, some tiny bits of feta and 3 olives. My friend who got the regular \"me\" salad beat me for sure.
5) If you like hot sauce, don't order it from them. They give you a weird slightly but not really spicy paste that tastes chalky.
6) My friend got the chicken skewers and was in pain for the whole night. Needlessly to say, her chicken was probably undercooked - NOT OK!!!
7) Your box order comes with flat bread - again, good but only when hot. If it cools, becomes cardboard.

The only saving grace of this place - the Tahini sauce. That was very well made, a bit runny for me but the flavour was excellent.

Sorry Me Va Me. Me ain't coming back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner tonight, was disappointed that they had no shawarma, instead I had the Chicken Schnitzel box. 
Previous reviews mentioned the chips were great, I wanted them, but ended up with fries instead I didn't love them), also with the box was a choice of house salad or greek salad, I had the greek (it was ok, but should have been dressed)
The schnitzel was very good, I liked the sauce that was served with it, more would have been good.
The laffa bread served with it, wasn't like laffa bread I had tried at other places, it was more like a pita. 
My girlfriend had beef skewers, the meat was very good, the sides were a bit weak.

Funny that they call this an express location, it took nearly 20 minutes to get our meal.

I'll be back, I figure the bad things are opening hiccups, and I do want to try the shawarma, plus the meats that we had were very good."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh made bread wraps take the shawarma to a new level. Really enjoyed the food, quick service and affordable price. Must try !"}
{"text":"Huge portion alert!  Tried the chicken shawarma wrap and it was delicious!!  However, too big to finish - not complaining. Service was friendly and very quick.  Next time I need to try the hummus."}
{"text":"Been going to the Cineplex here a lot. This is so convenient. Food is pretty good. Very clean inside."}
{"text":"The reason I tried this place was because it was listed at number 4 for best shawarma according to BlogTo. I must say, it tasted amazzinngg!! There's quite a few options to choose from (salad, wrap, or a combo box) and a lot of meat options as well ; they even had chicken schnitzel! I believe they also cater, so if you're having a party this could be a food option for you to choose from :)
I ordered the chicken shawarma wrap, and even got to choose between about 6 different sauces to have included in the wrap (i got tahini, tzatziki,  and hot sauce). They gave me an electronic order finder thingy(not sure what those things are actually called) for me to bring to my table and enable them to find me when my food was ready. 
When the waiter placed my wrap in front of me, I was in awe by the shear size of the thing!!! It was massive,  plus the chicken actually went through the entirety of the wrap as opposed to only being at the top and having nothing but lettuce at the bottom. Probably most impressive was tye quality of the wrap itself,  at the storefront you can see the employees hand making them in the window.....top quality for sure!!
Only bad thing was that they didn't have any air conditioning, so sitting in the place during my meal was more than warm to say the least. Would certainly recommend this place though if you're looking for some quality Mediterranean food :)"}
{"text":"This is a great place. I've been there at least 10 times. Food is awesome, I really like the schnitzel, but the shawarma, hummus are also phenomenal. Service is also over the top - owner makes sure you don't wait much for your meal. ....

Wish much success. Cheers."}
{"text":"The food is ok but not worth the high prices. Weird and not so fun vibe in the place. The whole experience was was just okay and not more than that. we won't come back again."}
{"text":"Wait, this isn't a Korean restaurant? I don't even know why I thought that for months walking past it, but it's probably the rounded letters?

Anyway, it's a wrap place--Mediterranean style. The wraps are the size of prize-winning fat baby arms. They're huge. They're what you get when your afternoon gym plans are never going to materialize. You get them when you brought sad leftovers and can't bring yourself to eat them. Yes, the place is polished in the way most falafel/shawarma sellers are not, but small things like quality, consistency, and ease make it a no-brainer when you just want to eat a giant wrap and ignore the mounting pile of work to-dos."}
{"text":"Aight so this place only gets 3 for the food. Unless you are dining in just call them for the food for take out cause almost on every single occation I've went and ordered with a group of my friends (on separare bills) and I'd be the first to order I would end up being the LAST of the bunch to recieve my food. Small problem but the point is in the back end they are reading their chits BACKWARDS. They are a chain and the one on York Mills and Don Mills is just better at doing their job I guess. On 2 dine ins some people just never got their order and just kept waiting and when my friend had asked it was just sitting on the counter. I'll wait a bit longer to update my review since this place hasn't been open very long. But I'll always come back for the food."}
{"text":"Finally a place that offers freshly baked laffa downtown!

Ordered a chicken shawarma and falafel laffa to split with two friends.  Big portion sizes and they are generous with the fixings.

A major disappointment of the night came when we unwrapped the laffas to taste.  The laffa bread was stone cold while the shawarma and falafel were warm.  

I want to give this place another chance though as it could've been an off-night."}
{"text":"Summary: friendly service* offsets slightly intimidating menu, and the tasty food for average \"Enterprise\" prices are enhanced by delicious humus dips, although it is not \"fast\" food nor big portions

Top Must-Get: \"Vegetarian Heaven\"
Top Regret: Chicken Schwarma Wrap

*In comparison to other yelpers, it seemed that my service experience was very different (or they read these reviews and made improvements!)

SERVICE
We came here after a movie for a bite. We stopped short at the cashier, oogling at the menu - they've got a ton of stuff. Thankfully, the man at the cash kindly asked us if it was our first time here, and whether we'd like a brief introduction to how everything works.

Basically, the emphasis here was on the dips. He was very knowledgeable and, when we asked about vegetarian options, he noted there is a \"vegetarian heaven\" choice. We went with that and a chicken schwarma.

This went for just under $20. The food took a little while (10 minutes), so I definitely don't think it's \"express\". 

FOOD
The chicken schwarma wrap was okay. Since there was a deal going on, I got free homemade kettle chips with it, so that was a nice bonus. The chips were actually pretty good - crispy, warm, and just the right amount of salt.

The schwarma itself? I definitely have had better, but I got to use some of the sauces from the vegetarian heaven, which was great! On its own, though, the wrap was not particularly impressive. If we go back and I had to get a sandwich, I'd be asking for extra tahini/sauce because it did feel a bit dry (again, why I appreciated my friend's humus!)

The Vegetarian Heaven came with three falafels, three dips, and an assortment of roasted veggies, including peppers, onions and cabbage, and a laffa bread. We had their default three dip choices (although you can customize if you want). The humus was my favourite, the \"labneh and zaatar\" (a cheesy dip) was my friend's preferred dip, and neither of us loved the \"baba ganush\" (eggplant).

Overall, it's probably not somewhere I'd go out of my way to visit, but it's not bad for a bite after the movie."}
{"text":"This place was okay! The portions are quite size-able but nothing was fantastic. It's not as cheap as you'd except for a fast-food type place. I got the chicken shawarma plate - chicken was a bit dry but still tasty. Service was fast and there's decent seating in the restaurant."}
{"text":"So good. It's like fancy fast food. You could take me on a date here and I'd be pretty stoked.

Food is delicious- a little expensive, but you pay for the ambiance of the restaurant.  It's always nearly empty- which is both nice and disappointing. (well over 30 dollars for two mains with or without drinks, etc.)

Meat, bread, rice, veggies, salad- honestly, I haven't had a bad item and can only hope to return and order something else."}
{"text":"It really convenient to eat something here while waiting for the movie. The environment is really clean and cozy. However I feel the price is a little bit expensive. I ordered a box lamb burger sticks and it only come with three sticks. I was expecting having two more. But regardless of that, the meat is really delicious and you can taste the herbs they put inside. Overall it's not a bad place to stay when you feel hungry but the movie will be start in half hour later."}
{"text":"Was walking along the Queen st strip and wanted to try something different than the typical.   Not knowing what to expect, we walked into Me Va Me, a Mediterranean cuisine.  Looking confused we were promptly greeted by a friendly staff member who took the time to explain the concept to us, along with the menu and how to order.   In no time at all, we were pros and ordered.  The meal came to us very quickly with help from the pager.  Very good meal that achieved the not so typical objective.  We will definitely be back!   The portions are decent-not crazy big or small but just about right.  Pricing is decent as well.  Can't wait to try some of the other items we saw others order!!"}
{"text":"The main approach to this place is basically choosing between wraps, salads, or \"boxes\". Wraps are in the $8.95 - $9.95 range and salads $5.95 - $8.95 without meat. A box item is $13.95-$16.95 depending on your meat choice (options include shawarma style chopped up chicken, chicken schnitzel, chicken skewers, beef skewers, lamb skewers, and a few other options) and then your choice of side (basmati rice, grilled vegetables, potato wedges, or french fries), a side salad, and piece of \"laffa bread\" which is essentially a pita type bread. 

I opted for the Chicken Schnitzel with a side of potato wedges and really enjoyed it. The schnitzel has a thin but flavourful breading crusted with sesame seeds. The chicken was tasty and tender, and the accompanying potato wedges were good as well. I was actually really impressed with my dining companions Chicken Shawarma w/ Grilled Veggies side though, as the vegetables were a large, thick cut, colorful and fresh looking arrangement of vegetables.

It's a good meal, and although an admittedly pricey lunch, it was really quite good to the point where I was full without even eating my side salad. It seems most of the mediocre reviews come from people who got the wraps, so my advice is pony up the extra bucks and splurge on a box, even if it is more than you'll be able to eat."}
{"text":"I hate to leave a bad review, but..
Had been at The Beverley Hotel with a friend, and was recommended by their staff to check out Me Va Me. 
We arrived at 10:25p, noting their google search, Facebook, and even their website noting hours of operation, 'open til 11p'. 
At 10:25p, Me Va Me had doors locked.  
Kitchen staff was cleaning up, and someone working there was making food for 2 people.  We knocked on the door to verify if we could have something to eat, but we were recommended to look at the website for hours, which indicated they would be closing in 30 mins.  We showed them our findings about the hours, and still were turned away. 
Not cool, not recommended."}
{"text":"As a transitioning vegan and refractory addict to Me Va Me's hummus (smoothest, creamiest, most heavenly vegan hummus EVER), I'm super basic when it comes to ordering at Me Va Me. Ever since my last rotation ended at Mount Sinai Hospital I've been experiencing intense Me Va Me hummus withdrawal, so I stopped by the Queen Street site today to get my veggie+hummus takeout ($6.72 after tax). They pack more veggies into the boxes at this site with comparable amounts of hummus compared to the Mount Sinai site. There's also an olive oil-free hummus option here for the same price, which I opted for today and would not recommend or do next time as the olive oil apparently adds so much more flavor and depth to the hummus. 

Space is huge, service is very fast, format is order at the counter (no tip), and Wifi is free. Yay, I'm a fan :)"}
{"text":"When I make a reservation for a big party, their manager call me right away to inform me of their party fixed priced menu. Each person get to pick meat of their choice which is mini skewer and drink. The restaurant  decide the appartizer, side dishes for you to share every 4 person. Also comes with hummus and unlimited nan.

Very efficient, good place for big group. Only complaint my party group mention is the food makes them thirsty."}
{"text":"I walked into MeVaMe after an extremely long commute on the TTC and decided to grab some quick food. Previous times I've been to MeVaMe, the wait time has been 5-10 minutes for take out, which is fairly reasonable. This time however, it was quite empty and I took my time ordering with no frustration at all from the staff. In fact they were very friendly and joking. I ordered the Chicken Shawarma plate to take out with fries and greek salad. Salad was fresh and fries were made to order (all the right way!). The chicken shawarma was good but next time I would try the Laffa roll and make it a sandwich. Overall great environment, clean restaurant, and good food."}
{"text":"Great selection of healthy delicious Mediterranean food! The foods a bit on the pricey side but I keep coming back. There now on the Feedback app so if you go order at the right times you can get a bit of a discount. My favorite orders are the chicken shawarma and out of this world hummus. They're bread and Caesar salad are delicious. Don't forget to ask for the hot sauce it's out of this world!"}
{"text":"Been here twice already in the past week.. Ordered the chicken shawarma laffa wrap. It was delicious and the wrap itself is twice the size a normal shawarma wrap.. so go hungry!!! The laffa is warm, fresh and a great change to the typical pita wrap. The toppings and spreads are yummy - hummus, baba ganoush, red cabbage coleslaw, and lots of sauces to choose from. Haven't tried the chicken schnitzel or the skewers but definitely will on my next visit :)"}
{"text":"Three words. 

SO
MUCH
FOOD! 

For a great price of like $12 I got the falafel meal. It comes with about 6 pieces of freshly made falafel along with a salad, side(I got fries) and a freshly made bread and dips. 

The entire meal was amazing. You could tell each component was freshly made and overall, it was delicious. 

It is also at a great location. Right across the hall from the cineplex in downtown markham.

The restaurant is also a very nice place. Nice and quiet and a great area for friends and family. 

Overall, loved it and would definitely return. Price, atmosphere and staff were all amazing!"}
{"text":"Best falafel in the city! I'm middle eastern and have and my fair share of falafel. Although it's different spices then say a Lebanese or Egyptian style falafel (which are typically my preferred flavours) I can gladly say the falafels here take the cake for me. Fresh! Always crispy and full of flavour. Don't even get me started on the fresh bread! A must try when you're in the city."}
{"text":"One of my favorite food chains I can always count on. THANKFULLY this location saves me a trip to their Thornhill location.
Serving Mediterranean food, this chain focuses on fresh ingredients, and you can taste it in the food they serve.  In addition their prices are reasonable for what you get.  
Coming here with my buddy before the movies we decided to have a bite.
I played it light and had a 6oz glass of their cabernet Sauvignon with an order of falafel. Freshly made, not oily, well presented, the quality was superb.
Meanwhile my friend had their mushroom humus served with pita. Again it was as beautiful as it tasted. ME VA ME is a great choice and a healthy one too."}
{"text":"Best food in town by far! Large portions. Healthy choices. QUALITY!!! Very well priced."}
{"text":"Ordered a shawarma \"box\". Asked for hummus and was told it's extra. This place just feels cheap compared to the original me va me uptown. The shawarma was not that good and it costed almost 20 dollars, which is overpriced. The manager did come by to offer a small size hummus on the house, but by this point it was too late. I suggest going somewhere else."}
{"text":"I went to the restaurant on Steele 7 years ago and recently came back to Toronto to visit.  I was craving the Shwarma and Baba Ganoush and saw Me Va Me Express on Queen.  I left very satified with my craving satisfied.  The service was very fast and friendly.   Will be back next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Got the Chicken Shawarma laffa wrap to go and it was pretty good. A little pricey for my student wallet and I think I cried a little when 11$ left my credit card BUT when I got my shawarma it was all worth it as it was bigger than a footlong at subway (also see, size of small child, large puppy, etc) and delicious. Probably won't be a frequent place for me, but perhaps every once in a while. 

There was no line up when I went in, around 7pm on a Thursday, and I got my food quickly. Guy working the kitchen seemed a bit confused but was really nice, piled on sides for me and asked me for anything I wanted extra of. This may also have contributed to the mammoth size of the wrap. 

Overall a good visit and shall be back!"}
{"text":"If you're going to order one thing on their menu, it had to be their Grilled Mushrooms on Hummus. It's sooo good with the freshly baked Laffa bread, you will be blown away with the gourmet taste!

We also ordered the ME Salad and added 2 grilled chicken breast skewers as an upgrade and enjoyed it as well. The skewers were juicy, moist and flavourful and complemented well with the salad.

The people who work here are all nice, from the person who takes your order in front to the person who brings your food to your table. They even asked \"How's  our food so far\" and even thanked us for coming! Talk about good customer service!!!!

We will surely come back at this location to try other food in their menu. Highly recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"First time here with family on a Sat afternoon.  Surprised there was 3 tables. We ordered vegetarian platter, chicken shawarma box & lamb box with falafel.  Like other yelpers mentioned the veg platter is a must.  chicken & lamb was over salted & dry.  But the bread and everything else was really good.Wish had more bread (3 pieces for all of us).
Service is why it's a 3 star. The girl at the register/server needs to crack a smile! She did not seem like she enjoy her job at all. Attitude with every customer that came in (maybe she was having a bad day)?"}
{"text":"Ummm...yum!  End of review.  

Just kidding!  I decided to try this place out because I was starving and it was close to where I was at the time.  I decided to get the Box (choose 1 main, one side and one salad) and depending on the main it's anywhere from $14-$16.  I tried the lamb skewers with the basmati rice and house salad.  Apparently laffas are their specialty but I had a craving for rice so I went with the box meal.  But since I will be back, I will try laffas next time.

The portion sizes are good (3 lamb skewers) and the house salad is not a ghetto house salad with one sad piece of lettuce and maybe a tomato.  It;s got carrots, beats, red onions, different kinds of lettuce, etc.  I saw some people with the laffa and t looked like a big portion - definitely something you could share if you wanted a lighter meal.  

To be honest, I'm not a big fan of the way lamb is prepared generally - I'm super picky b/c I find for the most part it tastes more \"gamey\" than anything.  But here it tastes just like my momma made them - the flavour and spices were just lovely...a little reminiscent of Indian flavouring.

There is a lot of open seating - the back has booths, the front has tables and a few long communal tables.  You order at the front and then they bring your order to your table.

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food is good and steady, but the service is way too slow for an express kitchen. We ordered two half laffa with soup and took over half an hour to deliver. They need to improve this area way more before getting more stars from me."}
{"text":"I wish I could give them a 5 as I love their food so so very much. However, I have gotten the wrong order countless times and didn't realize till I got home. Now I have to open my pick up order there and take a bite and check if it is correct and the. Re wrap it to go. It is super annoying! This has occurred about 3-4 times. The staff is friendly. For the cost of their food, it should always be accurate. Also upon ritual pick ups, they say it is ready via app but when you go there it takes another 15 mins! What was the point of that.

Good food but lots of errors on their part!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with this place.  I had the chicken shawarma.  The toppings are all a healthy portion and very tasty. The wrap must have been the largest wrap i've ever scene.  I look forward to returning but i'll split my wrap the next time... :)"}
{"text":"Killer shawarma. Quick eats for sure, you're in and then you're out (only if you manage to dodge the huge lunch line-ups). Super fresh ingredients and generous portions. Really filling but not sure about the price. If we were to compare the price of Me Va Me to somewhere else, I've definitely had the same (maybe even better) tasting shawarma for cheaper at another place. Nonetheless, it was convenient for me because I needed a quick bite for my lunch break.

The service is great and everyone is very friendly and I'll definitely be back to try more of their stuff."}
{"text":"My meal at Me Va Me was very good!! I went during a holiday because I knew it would be open since it's in a movie theatre. It was moderately busy, as most guests stayed to eat their meals there. The food was very good! I had the me salad. I asked to get the turnips they have added to my salad and it was $1.95 which I think is ridiculous for something that costs maybe $0.50 at most. The shawarma I added to my chicken came out later than my salad but it was tasty. Their baba ganouj is the best I've ever had!! That and the fried eggplant are must tries!"}
{"text":"Me Va Me was alright. 
The good thing about this place is that it's spacious and clean! 
Service was excellent.

CHICKEN SHARWARMA ON HUMMUS (3/5)
We ordered the naan bread on the side to dip with the hummus. This was good! But there was a bit too much oil on the hummus than I would've liked. The portion is big - good for two people to share.

CHICKEN SCHNITZEL (3.5/5)
(Chicken breast coated in breadcrumbs and sesame seeds with schnitzel sauce on the side)
I liked their schnitzel! It was nice and hot, freshly made. The chicken was crispy on the outside and surprisingly not dry in the middle.

Side note: I came here the same time as the fire that happened at the electronic store in the plaza - I felt so bad for the owner!! Firefighters and police came to evacuate people too. Relating back to Me Va Me, no one evacuated us while the whole plaza was on shut down lol."}
{"text":"I think this place is a bit above average in food quality and taste (falafel wasn't greasy). Pressing vegan was easy, still with the hummus and skip the cabbage slaw (it has mayo). Chips were nothing special. If they had unsweetened tea I missed it. I'd return if I was working in the area."}
{"text":"Oddly enough, my parents love this place! We've been trying a bit more Mediterranean cuisine as of late and this definitely hits the spot, and you can catch a movie after your early dinner. 

My dad always goes for the lamb skewer dinner, and I don't blame him. The lamb is more flavourful here than you'd find at most places and it's always cooked exactly as requested. We have yet to receive over cooked meat :) Fantastic attention to detail here.

I usually get a shawarma wrap and add some veggies. They've got loads of toppings to choose from and sauces as well. I think the flavours are very bright and well prepared. The ingredients always look and taste fresh as well. If you haven't tried their wedges, I'd say give it a go. I could grab a box of those to go and just munch of them. They've got herbs and other seasonings and it's just deliciousness. Why have fries at all? 

Price is pretty good. About $10-15 per person and the portions are fairly large. I almost always end up having to save some for later. 

I really really enjoy how fresh everything is here and they use the traditional methods of cooking their flat breads. It's delicious every time and you can watch them cook it too. 

Glad this place opened up in town. :)"}
{"text":"Like ... I was honestly shocked how good this was.  I just got it delivered by Hurrier on a whim, they had sent out a coupon for free hummus with delivery today so we decided to go for it.  We both got the chicken shawarma plates.  

They arrived hot, and absolutely delicious. The chicken has a really nice flavor and is very juicy.  I was expecting it to come slathered in sauce but it was just really nicely grilled, sauce on the side.  Not greasy at all.

The bread that you get is fantastic, and it's GIGANTIC.  I got the grilled vegetables and the house side salad as well. The side salad is pretty basic but everything tastes fresh and I really like the tangy house dressing.  The grilled vegetables were really good! They are seasoned well and lightly grilled so they still have some snap.

Only criticism is that the grilled onions still had that raw flavor, and I got a coke can instead of a bottle, but the coke mistake was probably a hurrier issue.

Overall, probably the BEST delivery I have had in a while. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Good fresh Mediterranean food for a low price. Lamb was very tender."}
{"text":"I had the ground lamb sticks with a side of grilled veggies. It was a delicious and satisfying meal. Being my first time here, I didn't realize that you place your order at the counter before going to sit down at your table but the staff was very nice and took our order from the table and brought it over. I will definitely be back. Loved all the healthy choices. Great location in Downtown Markham with free underground parking, a movie theatre and a Goodlife gym all in one place."}
{"text":"So disappointing. Ordered the falafels.  Don't know how you screw that up. The garden salad was decent. Never again."}
{"text":"The location is pretty good especially after a long marvel movie. The portions are big. The service and staff are friendly. They will explain to you how everything works. You order first in the front and pay. You find a table yourself and they will bring you your food. Not a bad idea but since they incorporated the fast food ordering component. It made me think the food would arrive faster. It took 30 minutes from the order to get our plates on the table! So I am confused is this fast food or dining-in experience? I order the chicken shawarma plate. This place has its own unique flavour. Don't expect authentic shawarma with garlic sauce. Instead you have shawarma that's shaved off, pan seared and tasting like there is lemon grass rubbed onto the meat. They also provide a sauce called tahini. It's like a watery purée of chick peas and garlic? Not sure. It wasn't so good. Overall if it wasn't for the expectation of fast food by way you order and the slow service that followed. I would've gave it a 4 star."}
{"text":"The chicken-over-hummus is exactly what it sounds like - crisp shawarma chicken on top of a generous bed of creamy and indulgent hummus. It also comes with two warm pita breads, which you can either use to construct your own wrap, or pull apart and dip into the sauce. It usually only takes 5 minutes to arrive, and often just slightly longer to devour (it's quite delicious).

There are other healthier options as well (the salmon skewers, for example), but those take quite a bit longer to cook, are a bit more expensive, and if you get down to it, just isn't as satisfying to eat as a mouthful of pita, hummus, and chicken.

You order and pay at the counter, they'll give you a sort of tracking device, so you can find a seat and they'll bring you your order when it's ready. The service is far better than most non-fast food full-service restaurants. Wish it were easier to tip (the debit machine doesn't give you an option to tip)"}
{"text":"This place opened up last year and was a nice addition to the area. There's a little food court beside it that has really high turnover so it's nice to see a more established place open close by. 

I've gotten the chicken sharwarma and the chips. Both excellent. The sharwarma is huge and the laffa bread is always so fresh and soft. Not dry like at a lot of sharwarma places.

I've yet to try the other items. Place is spacious as well. A"}
{"text":"I got the chicken breast laffa, it was huge and most importantly really good. My husband got the lamb plate and the meat was super tender. Definitely a good lunch option, quick and yummy!"}
{"text":"They are getting one star because of the way the store treats their customers.  I ordered take out at this location. Called in my order 6hrs ahead of time and when I got there at the time, they had nothing prepared and haven't even started to prepare my food despite that fact it was 5 o'clock in the afternoon and there were only two other customers in the store.  I had to wait another 20 minutes for my order to be done.  They initially overcharged me for my meal... then the manager was being stingy with the chicken swarma we got (I ordered a group meal 2lbs), the chef was initially scooping out the chicken and ran out, he was going to get more but the manager said it was enough and only filled 1/2 of a second container.   When he went to put the meat together into the container, he spilled some of it on the counter and then with his unwashed he picked the food off the counter and put it back in the container. This was after he had just cleaned off some trays/trash from the other tables.  I am never come back to this location and if I could, I would give them no stars."}
{"text":"I've been going to Me va Me for ages - since the original opened in my old stomping grounds at Bathurst and Steeles. After trying their new express locations, I have to say that the restaurant is nowhere as good as it was years ago. 

The Markham located is definitely the worst one I've been to. 

Ordered the Falafel plate and a plate of hummus with roasted mushrooms. 

Firstly, the falafels arrived 10 mins before the bread and the hummus. By the time the hummus and bread arrived, the falafels were cold. 

Let the owner know and he was nice enough to remake the falafels but an explanation that falafels take less time than the hummus with mushrooms. Unlikely - but ok. 

So after another 10 mins, all of the food we ordered was on the table. No side plates so had to walk up to the front to ask for some side plates. Express I get it but side plates. So simple. 

The Falafel itself wasn't great. While the outside was nice and the inside was undercooked. That tells me that the oil they're using is probably not super fresh. 

Hummus itself was good but why they pour tons of olive oil on it is not understood. A little bit fine but it's doused. 

Grilled mushrooms were great. 

Asked for a take out box and the guy who was spraying down the table beside us with cleaner forgot. I can blame him though as his boss was claiming around in the air shouting at this poor seventeen year old kid. 

Nicely reminded him and he was apologetic  

Music though is awesome."}
{"text":"That laffa bread is god-like -- made from scratch in-store and baked in a clay oven, it's moist, chewy with a good hit of char and a touch of sourness that I like.  I've been to their uptown location and didn't notice the bread being this good (not sure if they are doing something different here).  I haven't tried anything here that didn't come with the bread - it's that good.

Fortunately, like the other locations though, the value is good.  A $9 shawarma wrap is the size of an adult male forearm.  Oddly enough, I came here once after buying some shoes and the wrap was length of my size 13 shoebox - it's BIG.  It should last 2 meals or one if you're hungry - value point is similar to Burrito Boyz.  All the toppings and ingredients are fresh and they will apply as much (or little) as you like as you customize your wrap.

The only criticism is the speed.  The place gets crazy busy at times.  Also, I've seen who I can only assume to be the manager here everytime -- the man is fast, efficient and courteous -- however, he seems to be the bottleneck of the whole operation.  He personally tops, seasons and wraps every order (that I've seen).

While this is fantastic for quality control, it's odd seeing most of the other counter staff just standing around while he's a fury of activity.  Not sure if he's training or micromanaging, but it does slow things down.  However, the plus side is that he really gives a shit about your shawarma.

I debated about giving this place 5-stars -- the wraps are great, quality is valued and the manager is among the handful of people that I've met that I would headhunt to spearhead Johnson Heavy Industries (whenever that becomes a thing) and he'll join an elite team of ruthless efficiency consisting of a few waiters, a cab driver, an amplifier builder, a software engineer and an accountant once I figure out how I can utilize these folks all in one business.  However, I'm really turned off by the poor resource management - which I guess would be my problem when I start building my dream team."}
{"text":"Located in the same complex as cineplex, this is a convenient place for a meal before a movie. It never seems that busy.

I ordered the Grilled Lamb, with a side ME salad and vegetables. It also comes with some pita. The flavour of the lamb was decent with some good grill marks, but for the price I paid I expected a bit more meat. The salad seems freshly put together and the grilled vegetables were alright.

Service didn't take too long and the place is still new and clean. Overall an average meal, that I would've like to pay a bit less for."}
{"text":"Great place, I got the after 4pm special and it's delicious and enough for two people !  I would definitely recommend coming here to give it a try. Price is not too expensive for the amount they give."}
{"text":"I LOVE their Falafel Wrap and homemade kettle chips. All the toppings are tasty, as are the sauces. Fast & friendly service, no complaints. The place is modern and clean and big. Love eating here for dinner before watching a movie."}
{"text":"Me Va Me does not make it easy to order and receive food.

I arrived around 1:00 on a weekday and knew going in that I wanted one of the joint's Laffa Wraps. I asked for the Chicken Shawarma and was told that it would be a 20 minute wait, so I instead went with the Chicken Schnitzel. I was then asked what I wanted on it and I said everything, thinking I was done. Nope. The next step was to determine which sauce (or sauces) I wanted and I again said everything, to which the clerk looked at me funny. Exasperated, I asked her for her recommendation and she said Creamy Garlic and Chipotle and I said good, fine, done.

(As an aside, I love having choice when I order food, but sometimes I just want to order something without making any further decisions. Why not have a default Laffa Wrap and then offer choices to those who want them?)

I was given one of those buzzer things and told to wait while my food was being prepared, so I went and got a seat in the restaurant itself. It's loud back there, so if my buzzer went off at all, I didn't hear it - which meant a dude from the kitchen had to come back and give me my food.

Anyway, the wrap itself. This thing is enormous. But it's well put-together and quite tasty. There are quite a few chunks of chicken schnitzel spread throughout, while the many, many accompanying condiments work quite well. The bread is thick and obviously fresh, so that's a plus as well.

I will admit the whole thing did fall apart towards the end, but I was just impressed it lasted that long. There was a *lot* of stuff in there."}
{"text":"Shawarma is amazing. I think the secret is in the freshness of the ingredients used for sure. Plus its their sauce that completes it. Must try!!!
I had the box set before, and the salad plus the extra skewer but the chicken shawarma really kills them all. Make sure to put in the sauces! Garlic and taikini(?) sauce makes a great combo.
Ever since my first time there, i kept wanting to go back.
The taste is amazing, price is good and finally the portions are filling!"}
{"text":"Great food. Very reasonable prices. Their Humus is one of the best in town. Huge shawarmas! Fresh bread made right in front of you. Come on now. I am glad they finally opened one downtown and we do not necessarily have to travel north every time. Give it a try once and you will understand what I mean."}
{"text":"Amazing shawarmas! Freshly made laffa bread stuffed with a whole lot of filling! The guy basically makes the bread from scratch in front of you and bakes it in a tandoori oven. It was pretty fun to watch.

The chicken shawarma itself could be two meals! All the ingredients were fresh and the final wrap was as big as my arm! Service was quick and the restaurant itself is pretty nice and very trendy. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Thornhill location many times so I was excited to see the new downtown location. The food is as good as their other locations. I been there twice and had the falafel sandwich and the lamb box. Both were huge in proportion and tasted great. I only wish they served the peppers and pickles like they do at the full service location. Otherwise I love this place and will go back next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Been here several times in the past, tried it when it first opened and a few other times when it wasn't so new anymore. Decided to go back to this place since I hadn't gone in a long time. I have to say, it's not what it used to be. 

I ordered the chicken shawarma wrap and it was poorly packed and wrapped. Opening the wrap from the foil paper and just trying to grab the shawarma everything was falling out.. It was messy and all the sauces were just dripping everywhere.. The pita is also really thick/doughy. There giving less chicken nowadays when before they were giving larger slices of chicken so they are stinging out.. 

Overall, the wrap isn't all that good from what it used to be before.. Its put together poorly and  the pita is too thick. So your pretty much getting full off wheat and breading.."}
{"text":"I was a regular customer at their north location. And when then opened here in downtown I was so happy because I don't go to North York much now.

This is by far one of the best place with the Mediterranean cuisine! My favourites are chicken shawarma, beef screwer, red cabbage, eggplant salad, hummus! Everything taste soooo goood! Everyone here whether it's owners or employees treat customers very well! Everything here prepared with great care and quality! Sit down here or take out. Look no further!"}
{"text":"It's a Me Va Me, part of a small chain. Bright spotless restaurant with takeout. I went for quick takeout, laffa with schwarma. I asked them to go me half the meat otherwise I would have waste. They were nice enough to not charge me for the babaghanouj because I didn't want hummus or tahini. Warm, yummy, just the right size."}
{"text":"This was my first time going to Me Va Me. I've been meaning to try the other restaurant locations, but haven't had a chance. I ordered the chicken schnitzel plate and my friend ordered the chicken kebab. Both were huge portions, and the food quality was very good. The schnitzel was a bit on the dark side, but still crispy and tasty. The caesar salad was huge with lots of parmesan cheese.  My friend also enjoyed her chicken kebab, which was also huge in portions.  The prices were around $15 for each meal.

The Express chain seems to be like a cafeteria-style. You order at the cash, you take a seat anywhere and then they serve you the food a few minutes later. It was clean and the servers were very very friendly and courteous. I really enjoyed my meal here. I couldn't finish it all so they provided me with takeout containers to bring home.  I can't wait to try this place again, possibly one of their regular restaurants/non-express chains."}
{"text":"The location is great because I can get something to eat and go upstairs to watch a movie. The seats are comfortable. There are half with sofa like seats and half with hard wooded seats. Also, there is a circular table to accommodate 7 to 9 people right in the center of the restaurant. The restaurant is with a lot of clear glass windows which makes the restaurant looks bright and clean.

I ordered a Lemonana but it doesn't look anything like the one in the picture. However, the taste was not bad, and it tasted like a lemonade but with lime and mint taste, very refreshing. After I ordered my food, I got a number pager. I took a seat with the pager. When the food came, the pager didn't vibrate at all. Also, they messed up my order with a couple's from another table even with a huge number on the pager. My main was the Grilled Lamb Burger Sticks. The salad was fresh, and I like their lightly flavour basmati rice (white). However, the lamb burger sticks were kind of disappointing because of the black stuffs on them. The taste was alright, but I guess they didn't clean their grill or the lamb burger sticks grilled for too long.

I guess I might try again a second time because of its location or that movie night I want to have a big meal. I hope my next visit will be better."}
{"text":"First time trying this place today I had the laffa special chicken breast it comes with chips and a dri k for 11 bucks and the sandwich is freaking huge it  is comparable to the best shawarma place in toronto hands down."}
{"text":"Updated review:

Me Va Me Kitchen Express is a new addition to downtown Markham and is in the same building as the new Cineplex theatres. The restaurant looks grand and the decor is nice. However, the prices for the food they offer are very expensive. I can essentially get the same thing at Villa Madina. Ordered: Chicken Shawarma Box (14.99) and Chicken Shawarma Wrap (9.99?). 

Look, these dishes don't taste bad but the temperature of the food was questionable. The food basically came to us cold. Like if it was freshly cooked and took max. 10 mins for a waitress to pick it up and give it to us, it shouldn't be THIS cold. Initially, I suspected them to microwave the food but turns out based on the manager's comment, they don't microwave their food. Regardless of how they cook/heat their food, the food was still cold and that is NOT NORMAL. This is unacceptable on all accounts. Really not worth the money to come here. Also, my partner and I also had severe food poisoning after eating here. This was my partner's first meal of the day so the root of the food poisoning was obviously Me Va Me. And like other people's reviews, some people got sick after eating here. Something was definitely wrong with the dishes. Avoid this location at all costs!!!!"}
{"text":"Had the chicken schnitzel plate. It was amazing. Also, the service here is probably the best I've experienced in a fast-casual restaurant.

I will be coming back for the real Mediterranean options one day."}
{"text":"I really love the chicken shawarma wrap so flavourful. Big wrap too. The babaganush is to die for. 
The home made chips are addictive.
I wonder why the other locations doesn't make the same wrap."}
{"text":"I wanted to give this place 3.5 stars but half stars are not possible....I called ahead 15 mins prior for take out today. Food was ready and I met the lovely lady who took my order. The cashier however was indifferent. Food was good but not great. Loved their fresh pita. The chicken shawarma was very tasty; the falafel too battered, and left me with an oily after taste. You would think that side vegetables would be a healthy choice but they were also a bit oily
They also have a grab and go counter you can grab salads, hummus or other dips to go if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Staff are friendly and quite sufficient. Food also came quickly. However I've never gone during peak hours so I'm not sure how speed and service may differ when they are busy. The baba ganoush and shawarma were fresh and proportions were very well sized for the price. Great alternative to the other restaurants in that plaza!"}
{"text":"My office often orders catering from the Me Va Me location uptown and the food is just delicious, especially for catering. So when I saw that there was a downtown location, I was really excited to try their shawarmas in store. They offer boxes and shawarmas and I say, go for the shawarmas because their sauces are where it's at! 

Their babaganoush, which is a sauce that looks like hummus but made out of eggplant is out of this world! Lather that sauce on! The purple cabbage is also really creamy and adds a bit of tang. Get ready to have that shawarma drip all over, but it's so worth it. The service is amazing too!  They don't make a fuss when I ask for extra sauce. They make everything fresh so this isn't like a fast food joint, be patient. The shawarmas are huge, and I would recommend to skip out on the fries."}
{"text":"Me Va Me Kitchen Express offers a tremendous selection of food that's both healthy and delicious. In short, they've made sure Torontonians no longer have any excuse not to eat fresh, wholesome, affordable food every day.Me Va Me Express Kitchen's hearty hummus (a puree of chickpeas, tahini, garlic and lemon juice) was the first of our dishes to arrive, part of the tasty Trio Dip Plate. Perfect for sharing, this large platter boasted generous portions of hummus, baba ganoush (pureed eggplant and mayonnaise) and labaneh za'atar (a strained yoghurt cheese), garnished with extra virgin oil and fresh parsley and served with a generous portion of fresh tabboon-baked laffa bread."}
{"text":"Amazing foood. We had the chicken breast and the lamb boxes with the ME salad. Beyond incredible and very friendly staff"}
{"text":"Being a long time fan of the Me Va Me in Vaughan, I was super stoked to see it opening in Markham, but the Markham express location is a huge disappointment.
Food is a solid 4 stars, we got the baba ganoush, the house salad and a wrap to share. The baba ganoush is on point, garlicky and creamy, served with their in house bread. The bread is NOT unlimited like their restaurant location and so we had to ration the bread...I think if they aren't offering the same thing, they shouldn't charge things for the same price.
Wrap and salad both delicious, would eat again. 
The service was a mess. They collected the wrong buzzers, didn't know what we ordered, tables not cleaned."}
{"text":"Food: 3 stars, decent
Service: 0-1 star...being generous.

We came here as a large party (20+ people) for a birthday celebration on a Wednesday evening around 8PM..the food took a little longer than usual (for an \"express\" place) to come, but it was no issue. I ordered the box with chicken shawarma, grilled veggies and ME salad ($15).. the portion is a decent size and comes with bread as well. I thought the food was quite meh; I've been to the location at Rutherford & Bathurst before and felt the same way.

The restaurant is brand new (as is the entire building), it was clean and spacious.

Where the issue stands was the service. As a large party with there being another 3-4 tables in the restaurant at most, the service was lacking; we had to flag someone down or walk over to the counter every single time we wanted more water, plates, to order, etc.

After the dinner, we had two large cakes that were brought out; the servers did not clear our table, did not give us any plates or utensils to divvy the cakes; when we requested for plates, we were brought about 10...(we had over 20 people at the table, if they hadn't noticed within the past two hours).

The largest headache was the part when the bills came. They started off bringing us one bill.. we asked for separate and the (seemingly) manager came over with a calculator and the bill; he manually asked each person what they ordered and punched it into his calculator.. he had no way of keeping track of what was paid on the bill, what was outstanding, who ordered what. The entire paying process took at least half an hour and as the last couple paid in cash, they were waiting for change. After over 15 minutes of waiting, we went over to ask them for the change, and they said that they were not giving any as the total bill was short $10...are you kidding? The staff spent well over 20 minutes sorting through the different credit card receipts trying to figure it out but could not point out where the extra $10 was outstanding...not surprising if you are going around a table of over 20 people with no system to track what has been paid and what hasn't. On top of all this, we were all charged 15% gratuity from an \"express\" restaurant that provided minimal service.

I would not recommend this place for anything other than food-court style express dining."}
{"text":"This was one of my favorite restaurants when visiting Toronto. I really like the fresh schwarma with greens and vegetables. The set up is really nice and the service was excellent. I wish I had gone back for a second time during my stay. My friend had a falafel wrap and said it was good as well as it wasn't crispy but was soft."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. My only beef is that they can get really pricey for what they serve you. The place is clean, great environment for large groups and comfortable. Customer service is friendly."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday to score some Mediterranean cusine, as I was very hungry. I had been intrigued by this place once before when I desired falafel. Yet, just eats  or foodora doesn't deliver unless it's within 30 mins. So I couldn't order from them the first time around and had to wait until I was in the area. 

Yesterday was it! I ordered the mushroom and hummus, the field greens salad with the two chicken skewers. The hummus came with their freshly made flatbread. 

Overall, their food was pretty tasty. Their chicken was a tad charred more than to my liking. The thing with me is I eat chicken but not beef or pork. This makes eating out rather difficult because if I would like chicken,  I don't know if they grilled the chicken on to an area they've grilled beef or pork on. So, my chicken didn't taste so good.

In fact I felt sick afterwards. 

The salad was delicious.... their dressing was extremely flavourful. The bread was mmmmm mmmm so good and the hummus was very fresh. The mushrooms tast as though the flavour of a bbq were infused. 

I have a huge problem with the price though. the two chicken skewers were practically 6 bucks alone and everything together came to $26 altogether. This was a little bit extravagant!

I may or may not return. Guess I'll find out."}
{"text":"Could it get much worse than this? I guess it can, but really the sandwich at Me Va Me on Queen was terrible.
Their chicken shawarma sandwich is chewy, stale, old and even expensive.

First, if you go there eat on-site, but this will be one of the first several contradictions. We took our sandwiches back to the King Street food court and by the time we got there (10-minute walk) the sandwich was cold and chewy. However, the sandwich was low quality to begin with. The problem is they do not grill their dough and the wrap/pita is neither. Is this Laffa? it was like a chewy and stretchy thick wrap. Contradiction is they are busy and there is a long line-up, which tells you people will eat anything, line up for anything, give five stars to anything and also that if you want to eat there you may not find a table. Also, the sandwich is wrapped in paper, which is wrapped in aluminum foil and sealed with a Me Va Me stamp and still it was cold and starchy.
The chicken also (four pieces of chicken so not exactly a shawarma) was chewy. They were not hard, but you would have to gnaw to get the chicken  to come apart. The wrap itself was taking most of the space as well as the plenty of red cabbage they stuff in there.

I would take a low quality sandwich if I were very poor and desperate if it were cheap, but for a $9 sandwich I expect more meat and more importantly fresh or reasonable bread and better chicken. The quality of the dough and chicken they use is suspect.  
Of course, I won't be back, not that they need my business the joint is packed (but so was the line outside Burger King at the food court we were eating at - but Burger King is half the price...)"}
{"text":"Portions here are huge and very tasty. Got the shawarma plate (which comes with salad, potatoes/rice and chicken) and hummus with bread for two people and had enough left overs for another meal. 

The owner there is very nice and helpful, as were the staff that worked there. The set up is kind of weird as you order like a fast food restaurant, and they bring you the food, water, and take out boxes when you ask them. Which seems to be a hybrid between sit-down and fast food. 

Overall, this is a great place that I would highly reccomend."}
{"text":"Tried this fun place on Queen St/McCaul. You order, pay then grab a seat and they'll bring the food to your table. We had a chicken schnitzel plate with choice of salad- got Caesar- and grilled veggies. It was fresh and the breading on the chicken was crunchy with sesame seeds with a mustard dip. It was very tasty and reasonably priced at $15.50 plus a drink. Hubby had a giant green salad with beef skewer.  Definitely try this place as service is very good, it's clean and on a trendy street."}
{"text":"I've had various wraps, rice plates and their dips over the past year. Their food is consistently tasty with many ingredients and/or spices, but I especially like their lamb skewers with rice, which typically comes with a side salad. They take great care with their meats, asking how you'd like them done and my medium rare was perfect and fairly juicy for what is basically a fancier fast-food place. I also love the texture of the wraps and bread, and the sauce in them. Prices are around $12 - $20 for a meal, so it's worth it if you are looking for something relatively quick, healthy and delicious, but have a bit of time to sit down and enjoy for a few minutes. If you're in a hurry during lunch hour, go for the wraps not the plates. The latter takes longer as there is only one guy handling the side salads and there's usually a whole line-up of plates awaiting his attention before they are ready to be served."}
{"text":"Just after ordering I noticed that the manger/owner is picking at cooked fries and eating them while cooking my food and he's own food. Big No! Liking your fingers and then touching my food especially since he didn't wash in between. If it was a regular staff member it would only be a one star deduction. 

Sandwich was ok. The pita bread is very good."}
{"text":"So disappointing compared to the Me Va Me deliciousness I am used to. Markham location does not compare. Dramatically smaller portions and just okay. It's a different menu, small portions and nothing special. I really have no idea why they would change such an amazing product that they provide at their other locations.... will not go back"}
{"text":"Had a simple chicken shawarma to test out the basics here and while the bread was good, I was disappointed with the rest. Not good enough that I would try it out again unless I'm right next to it and there's not many options."}
{"text":"Excellent excellent excellent! Fresh everything. Love the dips, bought some extra for home. Very modern and clean interior, perfect to watch the World Cup! Friendly staff and very fresh food."}
{"text":"Whoever leaves a bad comment on this restaurant is straight up hating. Post a bad review about whatever you like- but the food is top notch. I recommend the shawarma plate with the hummus around it. Priced well, managed well, good atmosphere. PEACE"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. I got the lamb skewers and my friend got the chicken shawarma. The lamb skewers were pretty bomb. It was juicy and flavourful. I especially love dipping the lamb into the BBQ sauce (not sure if I'm supposed to do that). The BBQ sauce brings out the flavour of the lamb. However, my friends chicken shawarma was so so. I find that the chicken was really dry and rough. 

It came with a side and a salad - I got rice and the Greek salad. Thanks to my blurry eyes, I didn't know I have to pay extra for the Greek salad. 

What I didn't like about this place is that it smells like bleach wherever we sit. We moved twice cause the bleach/dish smell was so overpowering and unpleasant. 

The service was very welcoming. I don't think tipping is mandatory in this place as you order and pay first before we find a seat. The guy who brought us the food was very sweet."}
{"text":"Very good service. The bread is fresh..... made to order.

There was lots of food in my Shawarma... couldn't finish it all. Overall, it was a good Shawarma, I can't say it was great. I'll stop by if I am in the area again."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this Me Va Me. I've been to the Bathurst location but it's a bit far from my house. 

I thought the whole experience was average. I ordered the fried eggplant and chicken shwarma dinner to share with my husband. You do get large portions, but everything was lukewarm, which affected the whole experience. 

Service was fine. But food was disappointing considering the excellent food they have at their Bathurst location."}
{"text":"Delivery Review: via Foodora

Despite hearing good things about this place, I wasn't all that impressed with my order which consisted of two different boxes. Overall, the grilled lamb skewer box was better than the chicken breast skewer box.

Grilled Lamb Skewer Box
- I got this one with a side of grilled veggies which were too oily for my liking
- The skewers itself were decent but I wish they had cut the meat into more pieces
- For an extra dollar, you can upgrade the salad to a Caesar which I didn't think was worth it 

Grilled Chicken Breast Skewer Box
- The chicken was burnt and over charred in this one to the point that it had a bitter taste
- The jasmine rice as a side was actually quite tasty and better than the grilled veggies 
- The house salad consisted of some diced carrots, beets and greens

I think even if you're trying to be slightly healthy, you gotta opt for the fries here over the salads as a side. Overall, I would give this place another shot and visit the restaurant but I won't be ordering from them any time soon."}
{"text":"I really want to give this place a 4/5. The food is great, they are popular as hell on Foodora, and it's consistent. 

I've been a Me Va Me customer since they got their start at Bathurst and Steeles so it's great that they have a branch downtown. However, what I don't like is the price gouging and nickel and diminish practice. 

Listen, laffa is a staple table bread. Sure they make it by hand and it's good stuff, but charging $2 per laffa is just madness. The prices really climb here for two people to eat it you want a proper spread. You're looking at $50 easy, without drinks, to wash down that $2 laffa. 

At prices like that you may as well go to a proper sit-down restaurant or just the Keg and leave pretty happy. 

Thinking you want to take home some simple hummus? Get ready to pay $7-$10. 

I feel like Foodora probably saved this business as there's no way people would come here regularly for dinner. 

Food is good but the prices are an insult to one's intelligence. 

Cutlery is free though. So that's good..."}
{"text":"I'm a shwarma wrap snob that's not shy about identifying mediocre sandwiches. The bar for me was set in 2002 in London, Ont at Barakat. They were great and the only place that could compare is Boustan's in MTL but Barakat was better because of the technique they used to wrap it. After getting into a debate about the best shwarma places in Canada, I took it upon myself to hit as many of spots that made it on to BLOG TO's best shwarmas in TO to determine what I believed is the best in town. It took a some coordination and time but I was able to hit 5 different places on all around the 416/905 on multiple occasions and a couple others I was already familiar with. 7 places total. Every time I always got the wraps.

Without question Me Va Me is the best in Toronto. They hit the spot on so many different levels. I will be back there often. My order: All the fillings except turnips; all the sauces, but light amounts of each sauce; french fries in the sandwich. ENJOY!"}
{"text":"I'd rate this place 3.5 stars. 

I was looking at photos on my phone and found my late lunch pics from this eatery. I remember dining here after seeing a movie. I didn't buy any snacks at the concession stand and had worked up an appetite. 

You basically order from the front, find a table, and your food arrives. I ordered the chicken schnitzel. It came with grilled veggies and a side salad. I also got a Diet Coke. 

I recall enjoying my meal. Everything tasted fresh and flavourful. It was on the pricey side. My meal was over $20. Still, it was my first time there and the portions are large. 

Staff were helpful showing me how to place my order. Another person cleared my tray when I was done eating. 

It was pouring rain that afternoon. It wasn't a bad idea to have a meal while waiting for the rain to stop. I didn't have my umbrella with me.

{"text":"Nice place...nice location.
Food was test good BUT it was totally different from what I've ordered!!! 
Be sure from what you if what you ordered otherwise you'll eat upon to their test!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place always look so busy because it is NASTY

Even the hummus is nasty...not sure how something so basic like hummus can taste so gross. The consistency/texture and flavour of the hummus is all wrong."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place has such a high rating but this definitely misled me!!

I had visited the location in Markham and hated it but was DECEIVED to try this downtown location because of the 4/5 star rating.

I was craving falafel really badly so got them at Me Va Me. They were made fresh and smelled so good then I took a bite.... Let's just say I haven't had falafel ever since (been 8 months now) and I'm too scared to have another disappointing falafel :("}
{"text":"I have several friends that swear this is the best but I just am not all that impressed by their box lunches. They are very expensive and nothing all that great. Maybe it is the burritos, I'll have to try it next time."}
{"text":"Me Va Me opened a week or two ago and I've been anticipating my first visit. I am now finally pleased to say everything was pretty good than I imagined.

Me Va Me employees were serving samples of some of their food items they offer which actually helped me decide on what to order. Thumbs up for free food samples, if only every restaurant frequently did that. 

Upon arrival, we were informed about what Me Va Me is, what they offer, and were given neat menus which we are able to take home. There are plenty of seats around and I do admire the three round tables for groups, very thoughtful. Overall, interior and looked very clean and very admiring (probably because it's brand new but not complaining) 

For food, I ordered a Falafel Box with Aged Basmati Rice, Me Salad, and Laffa bread that comes with it [$10.95]. My friend ordered a 1/2 Laffa Wrap with Soup (Chicken Lentil & Bulgur) [$9.95]. The server was friendly and nice, he kindly repeated my order. After paying, they gave us a tracking device so they'll be able to find us and serve us our food.

The wait for our food was a tiny bit longer than I expected, but it did open recently so it'll become faster when the kitchen gets used to everything. In the middle of our wait, a server asked us if we wanted a glass of water, which we did, and she gave us them right away.

Once we got our food, I initially noticed how nice the presentation looked for both our orders. My falafels tastes great, but my Me Salad and Aged Basmati Rice tasted pretty plain and simple IMO. All attention should be going towards the falafel though since that is the bulk of the order. Although, next time I'd probably opt for the Greek or Caesar Salad and Potato Wedges. 

Overall, service was great, interior and cleanliness was amazing, and food was pretty good. I will be coming back to probably try their Laffa Wraps because they look really good too."}
{"text":"I have tried a lot shawarma places and most of them use a lot of vinegar in the veggies/pickles they add which makes shawarma a little salty. But this place is perfect. I always order vegetarian heaven and trust me it's more than enough for lunch or dinner. It comes with babaganoush, hummus and labaneh and all 3 tastes great. Falafel balls are crispy and fried to perfection. Even bread is soft and grilled veggies are perfect for complete meal. Best place to quench your falafel thirst."}
{"text":"I had the falafel lafa and I was delicious! The falafel itself isn't too dry, the dips ex: baba ganoush are delicious, and their vegetables are good too! 
Overall very tasty, full of flavour, and extremely filling!"}
{"text":"Me Va Me is cool Mediterranean place that straddles the line between fast food and eatery. I would lean towards the former even though if you eat there, they will serve you your food at a sit down table. The place itself is pretty big and cool looking with lots of tables and televisions on the wall showing various sports games.

The food ended up being just ok. I had a Mediterranean chicken dish which came with fries and Greek salad. The chicken was actually pretty good, but the fries were cold and the Greek salad was messy and just overall not good. 

This is a nice place to grab some food if you're in the area and want to watch some sports at he time. The prices are also reasonable. Food wise though, it's nothing special."}
{"text":"This was a newly open location (about 4 weeks old) so the inside looked brand new.

We got take-out so I can't comment on the service but it looked pretty busy and food was coming out quick. This is sorta like a order first and then they bring the food out to you.

Decor: Very modern and clean looking with large round tables and comfy curved seats.

Food: We ordered a side of falafel, quinoa salad, chicken schitnzel box (with grilled veggies) and dark chicken skewer box (with fries). I loved the falafel - crispy on outside and soft on inside! The quinoa salad threw me off a bit - I was expecting just quinoa and feta but it was more like a green salad with quinoa in it. 

The box meals were great plus huge - we definitely ordered too much food for 2 people. The meals came with ME salads which were quite big - I was expecting a small side salad but was pleasantly surprised. Also - the dressing was excellent! My schnitzel was super sized!!! Loved the crispy batter and tangy sauce (almost like a bernaise!) Grilled veggies were a bit bland but it matched ok with the meat. The dark meat skewers were also great - juicy still on the inside and they were dipped in a BBQ sauce.

We'll definitely return to try their lamb skewers and others items - the flavours were wonderful!"}
{"text":"Ate here on a Monday evening around 6pm. The place was rather empty. Ordered our food at the counter (I got the box - chicken breast, grilled  veggies, and Caesar salad), paid, and took a seat. Waited a little longer for our food than expected. I was happy with my meal - tasty and a good amount of food. It didn't \"wow\" me but I was satisfied. Wondering what the wait time would be like if the place was busier. All in all a good experience. I would return."}
{"text":"Me Va Me Kitchen Express is a Mediterranean restaurant on that caters to both takeout and dine-in and takeout customers at the busy intersection of Queen & John. 

While the focus is on fast food, the dining area can accommodate both individual diners and large groups for lunch and dinner. It holds up to 90 guests. Real plates and cutlery are used to serve popular menu items like their chicken shawarma, lamb, or beef dishes.

Laffa wraps are made fresh daily in the taboons that can be seen through the front window. A wrap will run you between $6.95 and $8.95. Salads cost $5.95 and can be topped with skewers for an additional charge. The portion sizes are pretty decent.

Service is as fast as you might expect it to be for a busy place like this. The place is sufficiently staffed when needed. You should anticipate longer lineups during peak hours, but make sure you try this place out at least once."}
{"text":"What a disappointment! I go occasionally to the location on Steeles & Bathurst. The falafel there is very tasty  & reasonably priced. After a movie this past Saturday night for my son's birthday, we decided to drop in for a quick bite. Falafel alone priced $9.95 & no sides with it seemed very overpriced.I tried it along with my son.My husband just had a drink
as he found the menu way too expensive. 
Is this a fast food place or dining in with a server? We were five people and everyone's food order came separately at different times.Why couldn't three falafels ordered come together? But the worst part of this after-movie experience was the falafel itself. It was a huge pita (laffa) in which I could hardly taste the falafel. Everything seemed smashed  together when I opened the pita to check inside it. Then the whole mess felt apart.
This was the worst falafel I have ever eaten in Toronto. For my husband who loves his food to just have a drink because of the overpriced menu is very unusual. Whether compared to Tov Li,  Me Va Me on Bathurst, or any other middle eastern restaurant this was by far the worst.
My son & his wife ordered some humus, salad, & falafel. There was hardly any pita with the humus. At the Bathurst location we get a basket of pita as soon as we sit down.
I will not be going back to this location, nor will I recommend it to others.As someone mentioned, there are many other good restaurants nearby.
To charge $9.95 for a simple falafel with no sides included is outrageous.And chips for another $1 were not fries as we thought but potato chips! Give me a break! If you want a good falafel at decent prices go to Tov Li (kosher) with two locations on Bathurst or even to Lazeez in \"Shoppes on Steeles\" mall.Again $9.95 Plus Tax for just a falafel which was mostly Laffa is just plain ridiculous!"}
{"text":"Came here twice so far. Long wait and expensive for lunch but the food is indeed good."}
{"text":"Great food and highly recommend, but they have no capability to stock appropriately and are constantly out of shawarma at a shawarma place.  Show up before 4pm or don't go at all if you want their main amazing staple.  Otherwise, fantastic.  If they learn to stock, this rating will go to 5."}
{"text":"The food is always delicious and fresh. The employees are all so helpful, nice and accommodating. I haven't had anything there that I haven't thoroughly enjoyed. Try the fresh mint and lemonade slushy. So refreshing!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I try to visit Toronto at least once a year. This time we decided instead of going to our usual spots- we'd play the Yelp game. He was really craving a Shawarma and the reviews of this place we're good so we gave it a shot. We went for an early lunch. The place was empty but everyone kept themselves busy, prepping, cleaning etc.
A cute girl welcomed us in a peppy, I like my job sort of tone and explained how they operated. We both selected out toppings and sauces and had a seat. She brought our food to us at our table.
Best chicken shawarma either of us have ever had. Not only was it delicious, it was also very visually appealing!
The only down side was that it was a $9 sandwich. 
Where we are from, you can get a pretty decent one for half the price.
But all together, the flavor, the visual experience, the clean and nicely decorated restaurant and the friendly staff made it worth it.
Sadly now that's all hubby talks about..."}
{"text":"I came here to get take out. I ordered half a wrap and soup. They had me sitting there for 20 min before telling me they had run out of the soup I ordered. They were making a new batch. I was very disappointment with the lack of customer service and communication. 

My wrap was drenched in sauce when I asked for it to be light. I called to speak to the manager to express my frustration and customer service was lacking. I will never come back here."}
{"text":"Really like the food and environment. This is one of my best choice with the Mediterranean cuisine in DT Toronto. Not expensive, but the quality is very high. Good choice for hang-out with friends or colleagues."}
{"text":"Me Va Me opening up in Downtown Markham is exciting! I have not yet been to any Me Va Me's location. Conveniently located in the same complex as Cineplex Markham VIP, this place can get crowded with slow service on Tuesdays and Weekends!

I do love how spacious the interior and the different seating options. The concept is like a fast food self serve: You order and pay for your food from the cashier and then it will be delivered to your table.

Lamb Burger Stick ($14.99) served on a huge plate looked colourful and healthy with a lot of vegetables and salad. Sadly just 3 small lamb sticks. Maybe it is good if you are working on your New Year Resolution to eat less meat. 

It was empty when we were there but it still took 15 minute to have the food we ordered served to us as it was made when order. I can understand why other reviewers were not happy with the wait especially when it is busy and have a movie to catch!"}
{"text":"Me Va Me Kitchen Express is a fast-casual chain of restaurants serving East Mediterranean cuisine with three locations in Ontario. Their downtown location opened in mid 2014, and overlooks the busy intersection of Queen St W & John St. The menu features a variety of Mediterranean classics such as hummus, laffa wraps, signature dips, falafel, shawarma, and more. 

During our recent visit, we started with an order of Trio Dip Plate ($10.95) - hummus, lebaneh za'atar and baba gonoush garnished with extra olive oil and fresh parsley. Served with LAFFA bread. The platter was perfect for sharing, and there was a generous portion of all three dips. My favorite out of the three was the baba ganoush (grilled pureed eggplant and mayonnaise), which was creamy, and the flavour of the eggplant was really prominent. 

Next up was another plate of starters consisting of the Falafel ($4.95) and Moroccan Cigars ($6.95). The falafel balls were served hot, and had a nice crunchy exterior. I found the inside to be quite moist, and full of flavor. However, my favorite of the two was the Moroccan cigars, which was fried, and filled with spicy beef.

One of the more popular hummus on the menu is their Grilled Mushroom on Hummus ($9.95). It had a nice consistency and the texture itself is creamy without being runny. I am not a huge fan of mushrooms, but the grilled mushrooms added a lot of extra flavor with the addition of olive oil and fresh oregano. Me Va Me Kitchen Express also offers a selection of pre-packaged dips refrigerated for takeout at the front as well. 

As my entree, I opted for the Grilled Chicken Breast Skewers ($13.95) - tender pieces of boneless chicken breast with our special seasoning and grilled to perfection. Served with our special B.B.Q sauce. All entrees come with a side (fries, basmati rice or grilled vegetables) and salad, which completes the meal. The chicken was well-seasoned and I loved the crispness of the fries. Lastly, the set boxes are reasonably priced considering how generous the portion, and it was a filling meal.

Overall, Me Va Me Kitchen Express is committed to serving healthy fast fare in a relaxing environment."}
{"text":"Some of the consistently best falafel I've had, especially in the downtown core. Fresh made laffa and fillings make all the difference I tell ya what. 

I typically get the 1/2 falafel wrap and a salad and its just the right amount of food for a filling lunch and late afternoon healthy snack. Not super cheap ($12 for the combo) but on par for a quality takeaway lunch in this part of town. 

Chewy bread, warm soft and crispy on the outside falafel balls, creamy tahini and hummus, crunchy lettuce, and tangy pickled turnips. Yum. 

Bonus that it is a) available on Ritual and b) plentiful on seating for when you do want to stay and eat. Not the coziest vibe in terms of decor, but welcoming nonetheless...at least in the, \"sure, sit down alone with your headphones on and tune out of work for 30 mins we don't mind\" kind of way. Which honestly, is just right sometimes."}
{"text":"The food is really good, I got the lamb burger sticks with basmati rice and me salad. The lamb was delicious but a little too salty for my liking. I felt like it needed a nice creamy garlic sauce to go with it. The laffa bread was soft and my family enjoyed the mushrooms and hummus. I enjoyed this place and would definitely come back. You get a good portion for how much you pay too."}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this place only is 3 out of 5 cus I love this place.  The food is the best especially the mushroom hummus.  The got cool combos you can choose from and lots of space to sit.  Love the signature dips they have too."}
{"text":"Portions are very generous so it helps if you can share. Service was quick and efficient.

Chicken shawarma was pretty clean.The greek salad was worth the extra buck or so. Ingredients were fresh and rightly proportioned. 

Seating was adequate (came in around 7pm Friday) though can see it getting busy during lunch time. 

Will definitely come again, provided I have burnt enough calories earlier in the day ;)"}
{"text":"I won't be coming back to this Me Va Me again. Long story short? Undercooked meat, long wait time, and poor customer service. Detailed review is below:

I went to this Markham \"Express\" location for my second time on Wednesday, December 30th at 6:50 pm with my sister and dad. 

The restaurant was filled to approximately 50-60% seating capacity. It looked like there was 1 person on cash taking orders, 2 servers bringing food to customers from the kitchen, 2-3 cooks, 1 person making bread, 1 manager.

We ordered two boxes to share since the portion sizes are large: Chicken Shawarma and Lamb Burger. With the boxes (each cost $14.99 plus taxes), you can choose one side and a salad. I made the suggestion to go to Me Va Me (now I'm embarrassed that I did!). I was excited to add a relatively healthy restaurant to my family's usual go-to restaurants. 

After you place your order at the counter, you're given an electronic table number and are asked to take a seat. The ambience is decent. It's a casual setting with modern decor. It appears clean because it is fairly new. There are high ceilings, floor to ceiling windows so you can look outside the building as well as see people passing through the movie theatre box offices. You can also see straight through to the kitchen (open concept).

After waiting for about 25 minutes, I was about to go back to the counter to check up on our order but the manager beat me to it. The manager came to our table and apologized for the delay. He explained, \"Now, I know you have been waiting a very long time for your food. I apologize. What happened is it was ready and half the order fell on the ground...and we don't like serving food off the ground so we are making a new one.\" I think that was his way of making a joke...I certainly hope they wouldn't serve food off the floor! At this point, I hoped the manager would offer to bring pita bread or a small appetizer to snack on during the long wait. Or another option would be to bring the salads ahead of the main and side dishes.

Finally after another 15 minutes (now around 7:30 pm, a total of about 40 minutes waiting time), we received our food. It looked delicious with large portions as other reviewers have commented on. My sister took one bite of the lamb burger. Before the second bite, she noticed the centre of the lamb burger was pink/red, slimy and stringy. It was raw/undercooked. The order comes with 3 burgers. We checked and 2 of 3 burgers were not cooked through. My sister brought the burgers to the front counter to show the staff. They offered to cook new burgers. She agreed and sat down again. (Regrettably, I didn't take a picture of the undercooked burgers! By this time, I think we were just wanting to get some food.) 

After the already long wait (for just 2 dishes) and seeing the raw meat, we lost our appetites and changed our minds. We also weren't sure how much longer we would have to wait for the new food. We returned to the counter and asked for a refund for the lamb burger box. The manager was mildly apologetic. First, he insisted that the burgers were being remade and offered hummus or other side dishes on the house. We declined the offers. I asked (calmly), \"Do cooks use meat thermometers to ensure the meat (especially ground meat) served is cooked thoroughly?\" He didn't answer directly or reassure us of the processes to maintain safe food handling practices. Instead, he agreed, \"Yes, of course. That kind of meat needs to be cooked through.\"

Other notes: once we got our food, we asked for glasses of water, an extra plate with a set of utensils, and ketchup. The open concept is interesting because you can see the entire restaurant flow. The server did something on the computer, served another table their food, and chatted a bit with a co-worker before coming back with utensils and a plate. We asked again for water and ketchup, then another staff member came out with that. 

Almost an hour after entering Me Va Me, my family and I left the restaurant without eating anything but some fries, a fork full of salad, and a few bites of Chicken shawarma.

Overall, the restaurant flow was disorganized, customer service was not up to par, and I was extremely unimpressed by the undercooked meat. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"We did not have a good experience at this location; both service and quality of food. 
It's an express restaurant; you order at the counter and they bring the food to your table when ready. I didn't expect any service at all except for them to bring food to me when ready but they failed to do so.

It was a non-busy Tuesday late afternoon, restaurant was less than half full.  We were starving and wanted to grab a quick bite after our movie. Three of us ordered food: 2 sandwich combos and one chicken shawerma box. These are common items on their menu so I wouldn't expect them to take a long time to get it ready.  
After patiently waited for 20+min, I went to ask them to check on my food order; staff weren't very helpful; just said food would come when ready. Another 7-10min wait, the first sandwich combo arrived. I asked staff to check on the other 2 orders as we wanted to eat at same time, it took another 10min for the other 2 orders to arrive at table. Total waiting time was 35-40min for EXPRESS food. Thank goodness this was after our movie. If this was before the movie then for sure we would have missed the movie. 

Sandwich combos were a good deal for $10; it was special of the day. You get a sandwich, a can of pop, and home made chips for $10. Sandwich was very ok, not whole lot of meat, more wrap than toppings; but for $10 this was acceptable. Chips were nicely crunchy and enjoyable. 
Chicken shawerma box was priced at $15. NOT worth it. I did not enjoy it at all. It came with chicken, salad and a choice of starch. I chose rice. My chicken was dry and cold; rice was bland and cold; salad could be fresher and less wilted. It also came with a pita which was cold and inedibly burnt. If I could, I would really like my money back for the shawerma box as I did not enjoy one bit of it. 

Overall, I was highly disappointed with the quality of food and the slowness of their service. After waiting 35-40min, my food arrived cold, burn and barely edible. I had previously been to their other restaurant location in a Thornhill (a while back) and remembered food was good then. I felt awful for dragging my friends here after our movie as they didn't seem too pleased with food and service. Needless to say, won't be coming back."}
{"text":"If express is waiting one hour for a wrap, come on in! Literally waited one hour for one wrap after letting the staff know multiple times. Awful customer service and ended up refunding my purchase with no wrap."}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation today as I wanted something cheap and fast. Little did I know I was grabbing a wrap the size of my arm. Chicken shawarma was my choice, and the veggies were plentiful. Bread was super fresh as I can see they make it on sight. Only slight disappointment came when there wasn't much meat in the first few bites, but it became apparently when it was all towards the end. So many options downtown and this is definitely a good one if you're starving for a massive meal and in a hurry."}
{"text":"I got take out from this place as a company lunch, i guess it's just not my thing. Got they box with Falafel with grilled vegetables and Greek salad. The falafel was pretty dried (although I think that's the way it is) I instantly bought a coke after a bite. I did dip it with some sauce and it makes it a little better. The vegetables and salad was good though. The portion was big but wouldn't try it again."}
{"text":"Food was great.  Only issue was that I ordered two meals and one came out ten minutes before the second.  If they see that two meals are on one bill they should be delivered at the same time."}
{"text":"Wasn't sure at first glance, but was pleasantly surprised at the great food!  Everything was delicious and fresh.   Went two days in a row when visiting nearby.  Definitely recommend and will be back. 
The hummus and chicken shawarma were great!"}
{"text":"Great shawarma laffa wrap - 4.5/5!  The box was not very good though - 2.5/5.  So that evens out to 3.5, rounded up to 4 for good service.

Let's start with the bad.  The box was fresh, but it was too dry.  I got the chicken leg skewers.  I liked that it tasted charcoal-y but it was quite singed, it was dry, and combined with the dry basmati rice and the salad...it was just a really dry meal. I didn't like the BBQ sauce it came with, and BBQ sauce doesn't go with basmati rice, you know?  And the chicken didn't really taste like anything - it tasted like it was marinated with just salt.  

The box would've been way better if the rice came with butter and/or the chicken was served with baba ghanoush/hummus so that there could be some kind of yummy sauce to go with it.  The laffa was good - but also (you guessed it!) DRY.  I'd never had laffa before - this one reminded me of naan, but better because the thickness was a bit more even (I hate the gumminess of the thick naans).  

The shawarma laffa wrap was very good.  It's not spiced like the other shawarmas I've had but it's probably because this place is not Lebanese.  Totally fine.  The chicken was reasonably juicy (why don't they offer this for the box???), the veggies were super fresh, the laffa was delightfully chewy, and most of all, the sauces were DELICIOUS.  I looove me some hummus and baba ghanoush.  I got both in mine.  Loved it.  So creamy and delicately flavoured.

Next time, I'd like to go with a friend so I could also have the fried eggplant or mushroom side dishes!"}
{"text":"Came here before the 2017 Yelp movie extravaganza! (Thanks again Guys!)

To begin this review I must say, this place is anything but \"express\". After ordering our food from the front.. we waited a whole 20 minutes before getting our food. Which is totally fine, on a busy night, with a lot of people.. but not on a Monday night at 5:30, when it's empty. 

Anyways, moving past that .. we saw our server once. She brought us our food and disappeared. We couldn't even order drinks. (Waiter takes your drink order here). 

Having been to the other location in Richmond hill (which isn't an express), it was a night and day experience compared to this one. 

Regarding the food; it was ooooookay. My chicken laffa literally had a laughable amount of chicken (see picture). Honestly for $32, I felt ripped off. Many other places that serve Mediterranean food in Markham where $32 gets you ALOT more food. 

I probably won't return here. Only reason it got 2 stars was for the kind gentleman who took our order."}
{"text":"A franchise shwarma place that has funky wall decor and smart and functional seating. Designed with community dining in mind, this is a take out / dine-in express service restaurant. 

Order at the front and they will hand you a buzzer and you will be notified at your table once the food is ready. They bring it to your table which is nice.

I managed to catch the world cup game while eating lunch so that was great. And they let me stay as long as I wanted which was almost two hours!"}
{"text":"My first and only time coming here...I was in a bit of a rush, which is the first mistake I made. Although the pita wrap is made by hand, after about ten minutes of not getting my food I was pretty pissed that others got food before me. Also when I ended up eating my food on the way to a concert I was disappointed by the flavor, I can't quite put my hands on it, but one of the seasonings they used for the chicken is...off? The portion size was huge, which was very nice for the price that was paid, and for some reason my schwarma had \"hard pieces\" in the wrap that made my teeth a but sore, cause I was biting down full force. 
The restaurant itself is very nice, pretty much brand new, one of the tiles on the stairs up was broken however.
The toppings and food is very fresh, but I do think I will go somewhere else in the area before coming here."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Food was relatively inexpensive, you get a lot if it, and it is fresh made and absolutely delicious.

Location:

Its located on enterprise drive in Markham on the first floor of the same building the cineplex is in. Its right next to the box office. Handy if you are going for dinner and a movie. That's what we did.

Parking:

There a tonne of free parking. Theres above and below ground parking.. The closest York region bus is about half a kilometre away so drive or get a ride

First Impressions:

When you first walk in, you see it is big with tall ceilings. There's a cooler with drinks and a counter to order and a semi open kitchen.

Ordering:


You order at the counter then take a seat. You are given a light up paddle to let you know when your order is ready. It wasn't busy, the woman at the counter brought the food to us, I'm not sure if that's what they do all the time.

I got a chicken shwarma wrap. You can get a whole one, or half. The half also comes with a soup or sandwich. I went with a whole one. I should have got a half one. You then pick the fillings and sauces that you want. It was a heck of a lot of food.

I also got the chips for a dollar, they are basically home made potato chips. They were salty and not too crisp. I would not get them again. My meal came with laffa bread straight out of the kiln.

Food:

The bread was soft and warm and pillowy soft. Thick chunks of chicken, and tonnes of fresh shredded vegetables. The humas on the wrap was delicious. The perfect texture. Next time I'm going to just get an order of humas. The combination of everything made the meal wonderful. The food was delicious and incredibly filling. I eat a lot and could not finish it.

My friend got a dinner box. A salad, veg and protein. He got a garden salad, wedge potatoes, and falafel. He said it was great. It looked great!!

Also got the lemonade with mint to drink. I love mint so I loved it. It is a lemonade slushy. Refreshing. Yum.

Seating:

They have the half booth chair hybrids, single counter seats, tables with chairs, or round booths.

There was a bit of an oops with me getting my order, but they were great with it and all was good!!

Result:

If I lived in the condos near there I think I would eat there every night!"}
