{"text":"This hotel had a comfortable bed and clean room, but it was dated.  The very, very old heating/cooling system was one of those fan deals -- very noisy and impossible to regulate the setting between hot and cold.  We ended up turning it off.  They gave us a room that we had to take an elevator, walk like a mile, go down a set of stairs, and walk another long ways.  The people at the desk were helpful, but we would not stay here again."}
{"text":"I got a deal for the room for a night it was $125 for the evening which included a 2 Queen sized beds and mini fridge. I slept great as the mattress was a great quality, Duvet that felt like a pillow and great pillows as well. They have an amazing pool area outside. Wonderful restaurant and bar which is also reasonable priced. I highly suggest their breakfast restaurant with freshly squeezed juices and great crepes !"}
{"text":"We chose Ruby Foo's for a last-minute road trip to Montreal, and it proved more than satisfactory for our needs. The room itself was clean and adequate in the amenities department; we didn't come to the city to sit in a hotel room anyway. Free, no-hassle parking allowed us to dump our car and explore the city by foot and on public transit, which is a short walk away. The outdoor swimming pool was outstanding (as far as hotel pools go), which made for a nice early morning treat for the kids. And the breakfast place downstairs was surprisingly tasty. Only downsides: WiFi was slow as molasses on most of our devices, and non-fast food dining options in the area are sparse (we made sure to grab dinner downtown before heading back to the hotel). Would definitely consider for a future visit to Montreal."}
{"text":"In summer of 2016 we travelled to Montreal, and did not have lodging that night. The manager of Ruby Foo's B. Wong made sure we had a room, and it was clean, comfortable, and reasonably priced. Thank you!"}
{"text":"First, the good: - Free parking - Large rooms - Nice outdoor pool - Friendly staff  The bad: - If you are a tourist you will be a minimum of 20 minutes drive (longer if there is traffic) from anything you want to do. - Rooms are not cleaned thoroughly. As other reviews note, our room was indeed dusty and there were also stains on the bathtub. We also found a previous guest's tank top folded up in the closet. - We had an issue with our toilet and it took three calls, starting at 6 PM and ending at 8 pm with us begging that someone be sent up soon as our kids were headed to bed soon. The excuse was that they lost our name between call #2 and the message getting to the maintenance person.  - Only fast food restaurants close by - The highway is incredibly inconvenient and often gridlocked.  We will not be staying here in future trips to Montreal."}
{"text":"I've been here dozens of times for meetings and I can't complain about much compared to other places.  The location might sound weird for tourists but I don't think it's aimed at them. It is centrally located with lots of cheap and not so cheap food options. There's shopping as well as... That's about it really aside from luxury car dealerships.  Traffic and construction aside, once here it's very modern and clean and the service is super friendly. Chairs and tables are nice and the branded schwag is cool to have.  I can't vouch for the rooms or the outdoor pool but I've been told from guests they are upscale which makes sense given the renovations they've done here."}
{"text":"Outstanding hotel.  Big, clean, and friendly.   Good WiFi.   Easy parking.  Great barber.  Comfortable bed."}
{"text":"We stayed here for 4 days and it's nice. The best part was the restaurant which is also very good. The pool looked nice too. Would recommend!"}
{"text":"An okay travellers hotel. It's in a somewhat industrial/off the beaten path area off Decarie. Lots of things within walking distance, including that orange julip. There's a McDonald's and a short walk from a plaza with more dining options.  An older hotel for sure but the rooms have a certain amount of boutique look. The restaurant attached to the hotel is good for breakfast. The gym actually is quite well done. Has everything essentially including full weight rack. I'd stay here again if I had to come to this area myself but it is a bit of a dated place."}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised by Ruby Foo's. When the tour guide told us this would be our hotel, just hearing the name gave me instant reflex that it was going to be ghetto. When we arrived, I noticed the lobby was quite modern and clean. The hallways walking to our room looked kinda ghetto... then when I opened the door, I was surprised at how spacious and well designed the room was. The washeoom was clean amd comfortable. The beds had duvets (and not those nasty layers of dirty thin blankets). The tv was centered between the 2 beds - minor detail but makes a big difference! The window covering is this wooden panel where when closed, it displays a \"chinese\" art. Cute touch!   Shampoo/conditioner mediocre."}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this place. It's a great price and a decent stay. The people at the front desk are marvelous. Staff provides prompt, courteous service. Bed is so comfortable. Room is nothing fancy.   On the down side, the Internet is terribly, terribly slow. And cable TV has few channels for U.S. travelers. Signs are posted, promising upgrades in this area. So my comment may be out of date very soon.  Also on the down side: dining options. Choices are mediocre in this area of Montreal. The on-premise options are is just... meh. There's Baton Rouge and fast food joints across the street. If you want better, hop a cab to St-Laurent, Crescent St, Little Italy or downtown."}
{"text":"This is our usual place to stay when we come to Montreal as it is closest to our family. This time we did not book a room because we were supposed to stay with family. When that family had a member suddenly become ill and hospitalized, we scrambled to get a room here. We needed three nights but were only able to get one to start. BUT Ruby Foo's put us top on a wait list and we were able to get the extra nights! Thank you to Frank who went out of his way to find us at breakfast to tell us the good news! We have slept really well on the good mattresses! From now on, forget staying with family! We are staying here always!"}
{"text":"Rooms are very nice. Hallways 'old'. Pool is quiet. near everything including a subway."}
{"text":"Great Location off Decarie and Jean Talon.  Good service, clean rooms"}
{"text":"Came here only once for a very quick short stay (6 hours only for the night.) A friend got married around by and  I needed a nearby place to just crash with the rest of the wedding group. Ruby Foo's staff is great with finding you a room according to needs and tries best to work with what you need. I didnt really use much of their services, but the rooms were well kept, moderately affordable with the adequate supplies. The bed was comfy and the check out  fast. But from what I saw while checking out they have a nice pool with great seating arrangements on the side. Its located conveniently just after the 40west near decarie express. Will positively recommend this place."}
{"text":"I stayed at this hotel not to long ago... During our 8 day tour of the East Coast when, I first heard the name Ruby Fool's Hotel... For me it sounded like a Chinese restaurant when I first saw this hotel from the inside and outside this Ruby Fool's hotel it wasnt that bad of a hotel... There is just two things that... I have to say about this hotel #1 the hotel room where I stayed was okay and for #2 didnt like when Ruby Fool's only had one elevator to use that was the only thing that I didn't like... But overall in what, I really like most about Ruby Fool's hotel is the free Wi Fi that they have!!!"}
{"text":"Quiet and comfortable. Staff was very helpful with restaurant recommendations. Breakfast at their restaurant was decent. Will stay there again on my next business trip to that area."}
{"text":"We booked one night at this place at the last minute through Hotel Tonight. The place is very old and worn down. Our room seemed clean, the bed was comfortable and parking was free, but the overall aesthetic was less than pleasing. The walls looked dirty and the bathroom doors inside the room were broken. Carpet was dark and didn't feel very clean. Overall, I think the place is overpriced and I wouldn't stay there again."}
{"text":"We always stay at Ruby Foo's when we come to Montreal to visit family.  While it's not downtown, it's a short walk to a metro station.  It's clean, updated, quiet and the beds are comfy.  There are also several eating place nearby - Tim Horton's, Wendy's McDonalds, Burger King and my favorite - Dunn's for smoked meat sandwiches.  Another bonus is free parking."}
