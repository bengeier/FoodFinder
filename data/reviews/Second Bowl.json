{"text":"I've been frequenting this spot ever since it opened! While I do have to admit that there are dishes offered here that are missing components I've experienced at other restaurants, you can't go wrong with coming to second bowl! It has great service (dining in and take-out), the food is always fresh and there's lots of it, decor is really modern and clean, and prices are super reasonable.  I've tried everything from their pho, noodle dishes, curry and vermicelli.  Last night I ordered their chicken lemongrass vermicelli with spring roll. I took it to go and they gave me lots of sauce to pour over top! The spring roll was crispy when I got home, the chicken was nice and tender, noodles were soft, vegetables crispy and not too many peanuts (for me it's an overwhelming taste when there's too much). I do miss that they don't offer pickled carrots and radishes like some other places. But there are still really nice flavours that it works for me!  My photo shows the dish all mixed together, as I realized I should take a photo after I started eating - note the bite out of my spring rolls, which are reason enough to visit!  If you want to support an independent hole in the wall, this is a must try for thai/vietnamese food lovers."}
{"text":"This has been our go to pho place in Newmarket for years but tonight something just wasn't right. The servers (I think the owners kids?) were arguing with their mother quite vocally, the tables were all lacking the little caddy of spoons, chopsticks, hot sauce and hoisin, there was just general confusion all around. We had to ask for chopsticks, cutlery and napkins numerous times and the portions were noticeably smaller than previous visits. Hoping it was just a one time thing because  we love this place......but if this is the new norm then we are done."}
{"text":"Love the pad Thai and the Thai red curry is probably the best meal I've ever had. Seriously."}
{"text":"Went there for lunch with my wife and a friend. I don't claim to be an expert when it comes to Thai or Vietnamese food, but the Pad Thai tasted unusual. Honestly it just seemed like rice noodles doused in ketchup. I've ordered Pad Thai from lots of other places, never had one like that. Other things: I was served 5 minutes after the other people at the table. Also,  $12.50 + tax + tip seems quite steep for the portion given in a lunch special."}
{"text":"This restaurant surprised me on all fronts with upscale modern décor, good service, reasonable prices and great food.   It was a busy Monday night when we arrived and while our food wasn't fast to arrive we chatted and sipped on complimentary tea.  Likeaphenomena's hot and sour soup was delicious and her Mango Bubble Tea, brought at the end of the meal was a tropical delight.   Menu selections are patron participatory - write your choice by number on the bill and then pay at the counter when you're done.  Tables seem close together, but this just makes the atmosphere more citified, a nice contrast to its suburban strip mall location."}
{"text":"For my second pho restaurant I tried in Toronto, this one was just above average. I really enjoyed the staff and food here. When you order apps, they present to you the sauces and plates and bring in the apps BEFORE the meal (how it should be). The Pho was good as well as the service. I would definitely come back here again, without worrying about the quality of this restaurant. The only downside to this restaurant i can think of? The washroom smelled like it was maintained on a regular basis. Or maybe i was just there at the wrong time... Well regardless, this definitely deserves a 4 star."}
{"text":"Great local spot for pho! Dumplings snd Fresh Rolls are also my favorites! Service is also consistent and great."}
{"text":"Second Bowl is one of our favourite places to eat in town.  The food is good and the prices are very reasonable.  My wife and I have often gone more than once a week."}
{"text":"3.5*   A pretty solid option for pho in the Yonge and Davis area of Newmarket (where pickins' are slim). Located in one of many plazas along Yonge street, Second Bowl is a decently sized restaurant that serves a selection of Vietnamese and Thai dishes.   I had the large pho with rare beef and beef balls ($8.50) - the garnishes were fresh, which is a good sign that the restaurant does have enough business that there is regular turnover for their produce. While the broth wasn't the best I've ever had (Pho Metro in Scarborough has that spot in my heart), it was clear, not too fatty, and has little/no MSG in it, judging by my level of thirst afterwards. The large size was enough to give me that satisfied/full feeling I look for whenever I have pho.   I also had the iced espresso + condensed milk over ice ($3.99). While not particularly memorable, it still hit the spot.   I'd give 4* for the food alone, but the service knocks it down half a star - while it wasn't unfriendly, I do think the service could be friendlier."}
{"text":"I keep coming here so maybe it's time for a review.  This is a small family run Vietnamese style restaurant in a strip mall.  Easy to find, but hard to beat!  I usually go for a bowl of Pho with its flavourful broth, subtle noodles and fresh bean sprouts.  Fantastic in cool weather.  I made the mistake of once ordering a large soup.  Only do that if you don't want to finish--it's huge!  However, don't fear trying anything on the menu--its all great!  The atmosphere is warm and inviting, the hospitality is very respectful, and the prices are excellent."}
{"text":"Old reliable. Great broth, fresh ingredients and skilled friendly staff. Very clean and tidy.  Staff makes great efforts to make every dish special and I always love the dumplings!"}
{"text":"I've been to second bowl a couple times. The other times I have gone to second bowl we were always brought tea as soon as we were sat. This time I asked for tea and the manager came over and said I would be charged for it which is news to me. I have never been to a pho restaurant and been charged for tea.   It's a nice restaurant, very clean and well maintained. My sister and I ordered fried calamari to start. It was not what we were expecting. It was a little rough tasting. The pho was amazing. I ordered the vegetable pho and the server asked if I wanted the beef broth or vegetable which I thought was considerate. Everything came out pretty fast."}
{"text":"Just ordered curry Pad Thai.... horrible is just one word that I can use to describe the good... hard earned money wasted....never again!!!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular here because they have the best Vietnamese restaurant in Newmarket with great service. Bubble tea is amazing and pho is amazing on a cold day! The appetizers such as dumplings or fresh rolls are great for a quick bite. Definitely try!"}
{"text":"I had bad experience previously but I decided to try again.... What a mistake.   I didn't even get to eat because I ordered an xl pho to share with my fiancé who wasn't that hungry.  And she asked me if I could order two small instead of an xl because you can't share here.  Excuse me?? WTF?!?   Ya I left."}
{"text":"I've heard that there are quite a few good Pho places in Newmarket, and I knew we were going to be in the area, so I randomly checked one out. We basically hit the first spot we came to, Second Bowl. Right off Yonge Street in the Yonge-Kingston Plaza, there is plenty of free parking. We were able to get a spot pretty much directly in front of the restaurant which was nice. The restaurant is actually a Pho/Thai place, which prompted immediate skepticism, but shortly overlooked since Thailand and Vietnam do share a border.  The place was not busy at all, but then again it was rather late (we arrived around 20:00). The decor was a little more modern, despite the plaza in was in looking a little out of date. It was a nice change, the dining area was spaciously laid out; with pot lights instead of florescent bulbs filling the room with white light rather than a glow.  The menu was actually a bit of a shocker, and I quickly came to realize that I should not associate this place as a Pho restaurant. Second Bowl is exactly as they advertise, a Vietnamese and Thai restaurant. They didn't boast Pho, instead they had a range of Vietnamese, Thai, and Chinese cuisines. The menu wasn't extensive in any category, but the variety was there. Since we were there for the Vietnamese, on the card for the evening was: (P6) Pho Dac Biet, (V7) Bun Cha Gio Bo, and (C1) Com Suon Nuong.  Pho Dac Biet. This is the house special Pho and came with rare beef, well done beef, beef tripe, beef tendon, and beef balls (missing my favs: brisket and fatty beef, boo). As usual, the bean sprouts; leaves of basil, coriander, and culantro; lime, and Thai chili peppers came on a separate dish. They were acceptable, with little to no brown spots indicating wilting. I never add any sriracha nor hoisin sauce directly to the soup as it clouds the true taste of the broth. Instead, I use it only for dipping the meats. Every spoonful has soup, noodles, and meat (note: I always ask for scissors to cut up the larger pieces of meat to about 1/2 of the size of my soup spoon). My first taste is always the broth on it's own with a clean palette. The broth: this wasn't bad and I was able to taste the beef flavours associated as \"Pho\". Also present, albeit mild, were flavours of star anise and cloves. I couldn't discern any anise or ginger, but I'm not a fan of either so that was just fine by me. The ratio of meats to noodles was spot on! I was able to eat the entire bowl with only a little excess soup. 3,5 stars.  Bun Cha Gio Bo. Essentially a deconstucted plate of noodles, vegetables, beef, tomato, pickled carrots and radish, lettuce, peanuts, and garnished with cilantro. Fish sauce is served on the side. Since Bun is noodles without soup, the Fish sauce and the beef would be what makes the dish. The Beef: this was slightly on the thin side, but was flame grilled nicely and the flavours were OK (No lemongrass flavour but ok by me, I'm not a fan). The fish sauce also wasn't bad, being able to strike a balance of fishy, salty, sweet. There was no Thai chili pepper and it didn't come on the side. 2,5 stars.  Com Suon Nuong. Grilled Pork Chop on an open flame, steamed rice, fried egg, and onion oil. A simple dish, but very tasty if made properly. With cucumber, tomato, pickled carrots and radish. Again fish sauce is served on the side, and was the same that came with the Bun. I prefer to eat this dish without the sauce and enjoy the marinade of the meat along with the onion oil. The pork chop was ok, carrying the same flavour as the beef in the Bun, but was a little on the small side. 2,5 stars.  I've had Pho in Vietnam and the experience was quite different. Primarily a breakfast food, and much smaller bowls, Pho was widely available on street stalls. While the word Pho is in relation to the fresh rice noodles, the dried one is often used in North America. Some places will let you choose between fresh and packaged, but to be honest, even I've become accustomed to the packaged. For this reason I don't rate the noodles, instead I focus on the soup. The broth should be clear like French consommé. This is more difficult to achieve than it sounds since the soup is made by the long simmering beef bones, flank, and/or oxtail. The fat and marrow from the bones creates a frothy coating that sits atop the broth. In Vietnam, they put a tiny scoop of this into each bowl, and this makes all the difference in the world! The frothy fatty marrow packs one heck of a punch when it comes to flavour, and in an amazing way. In North America this is skimmed out so that only the clear broth remains. So here's my tip to you: When ordering Pho, you should always ask for some!  From an authentic view, they were off. Missing some key ingredients like ginger, fennel, garlic, fatty beef, and brisket. Would Second Bowl cure homesickness? Probably not. But, for me, it's A-OK. 3 stars.  If you would like to experience more, come dine-with-me.yelp.com I'd love to have your company... Bon Appétit!"}
{"text":"Eaten here for both lunch and dinner and both times were excellent. The menu has both Thai and Vietnamese selections and the options are vast. The soup broth is very nice, homemade with the perfect level of spice. Fresh rolls are amazing with a hit of mint. They have beer and wine another plus. Prices are reasonable, very good value, enjoyed our meals and will be back!"}
