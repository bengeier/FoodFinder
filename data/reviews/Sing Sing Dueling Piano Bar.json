{"text":"SingSing!!! What a blast! One of my favorite places to jam on Earth!! Cool bar, cool town, cool people... What else do you need!! The piano players are great, funny, semi-good lookin'... I mean dude, you gotta go!!! :) Love me some SingSing!"}
{"text":"Paid $20 for my friend to go on stage for her birthday around 8:30. We left at 11:30 because they hadn't called her up yet. The show focused on these phrases that just didn't make sense to any of us."}
{"text":"A little pricy. Enjoyed visit though. Lots of fun. Bald guy with beard in the band the best. Bartender was very friendly although never caught her name"}
{"text":"Lame. Lame as heck.  The premise seemed kind of fun, but when I got there it did not take long for Sing Sing to disappoint. The $7 cover was way too high for this place, and the drinks were not good. The music the guys played was all stuff from like 1987. Nothing modern, mostly stuff you would hear on Bob FM during the two o'clock hour at work. The medley from Grease was a crowd pleaser I guess.  Part of their schtick is that if a member of your party is having a birthday or wedding or what have you then you can pay to have that person dragged on stage and they will sing a song to them. They were doing dirty versions of well known songs, and there was really only one joke.  \"Hey there Delilah\" became \"Hey There V****a\" and that was the cleverest one. Hope you like 7th grade dirty jokes, because you'll be hearing a lot of them. Mostly ones that you already know from 7th grade.  I would not recommend anybody go. I want my brain cells back."}
{"text":"Sing Sing is awesome!! Give a buck or more and they will play anything, and if they don't know it, they will search for who requested the song so they can do something else the person will enjoy! :) Great humor too!! :)"}
{"text":"I went here with a bachelorette party. We had reservations, which was good because it was packed that Saturday night. The performers were very talented, but the acoustics were strangely off.   The theme that ran through the whole show was, to quote some phrases they kept repeating, \"you bitch, you slut, you whore\" and  \"twinkle twinkle little slut, why don't you take it up the butt\" which one of the pianists wrote on the mirror at the back of the stage... You get the idea?  Perhaps if I had not been the designated driver, alcohol would have made these jokes funny the fifth, sixth, seventh time. Or maybe not."}
{"text":"My best friend took me to Sing Sing for my bachelor party. I had a blast. The musicians (dueling pianists) made fun of me in a bunch of songs. They also were really good at playing requested tunes (rock). When the show was over we shuffled across the hall to the connected \"Rock Bottom\" restaurant for some grub. We all had so much fun that we went back for my buddy's bachelor party.  There were some drawbacks though. We went on a Thursday night so the atmosphere was lacking as the place was pretty empty. And of course they are a little pushy soliciting tips when the place is empty. But it's not our fault the place is empty on Thirsty Thursday, if their drinks weren't so damn expensive maybe more people would show up. And sometimes they used vulgar language which was just unnecessary since they would have otherwise still been hilarious. Also there was no table service, and the only bartender was a bitch. I'll probably be back, but only for a special occasion when I can afford it."}
{"text":"The piano players are skilled, engaging, and they aim to please. I wish they had funnier bits than \"ha-ha gay\" for the dudes and \"I'd creepily have sex with you\" for the ladies. The best parts are when they play songs they clearly enjoy. The worst is the cringey gross banter."}
{"text":"I just had my last fling before the ring night here. The musicians we're entertaining and amazing, and my server was on top of it all night. It can get a little expensive, but the extra money is worth it to get your friend some attention on their special day! I will most definitely return!"}
{"text":"Celebrated my divorce here. My waiter was awesome. The entertainment was actually really good, but bring cash. They are tip driven and it can get a bit expensive with drinks and song."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time this past weekend. Needless to say I'll be returning! It was a blast!!!  It was cheap to get in and since we got there a bit earlier we got a semi-good table. Though it was very annoying that people had reserved tables right up front and never showed up. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE?! Everything if you ask me! Seriously though if you're going to reserve a table, you better freaking go!   I had no complaints about the place itself! The guys were hilarious and watching my brother get made fun of multiple times was just the cherry on top! Anddd this has to be the only place I've ever enjoyed being around people who were sloppy drunk, because the comedians take no prisoners!   I did enjoy when Matt and Joey were the ones up there because they are just amazing and make it so much better! They are great at what they do. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We had a great time! We haven't laughed that hard in quite a long time. Karl, Drew and Danny are incredible and very talented. We ate there too. Food was pretty good too. Beer was good, but don't forget your wallet. Not outrageous...about $5 a beer. We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"We have been here twice this summer & it's one of our new favorite entertainment spots! The first time we came without a reservation, but still got 2 seats on the surrounding bar ledge. There is not a bad seat in the place! Second time we came we made a reservation for Fathers Day. Our waitress was friendly, speedy, and made for an awesome night. Though the door opens at 7, music typically starts around 8. The guys that play are very talented musicians, but also throw some comedy into the mix. Going into the night, you have to be prepared for them to pick on the audience a little!  If you are easily offended, this show is not for you.  That's a part of the gig, and you cannot get offended by it. Music that is played is generated by the requests from the audience, so it is always tailored to the crowd that shows up that night. Karl Bailey is our favorite musician as he plays both the piano and drums, and is (in our opinion) the funniest, as well. ALL of the musicians are amazing piano players and can harmonize well with each other. Fantastic bar - I would highly recommend to anyone - especially if you like music."}
{"text":"Well, the experience did not start well. When we walked in the singing we heard was NOT good. Oy was it not good... Thankfully, it (mostly) improved from there.  So there were 3 piano players rotating out on a half hour basis. So each was on for an hour and off for half. Of the 3, two were really good. Good singers, good piano players, and very funny. The third guy, well, not so much. Piano skills were fine. But his singing was not. When he sang in his range, he wasn't too bad actually, but too often he reached for notes that he couldn't get to or forced things that just weren't going to happen. Often his jokes fell completely flat. Luckily the other two usually did most the talking.  They played a variety of songs as requested by the crowd and would do them in unconventional styles if requested (Closer by NIN as sung by a lounge singer was a highlight). We requested Britney Spears' Toxic cause we thought it would be funny and so they gave it a shot and as luck would have it, it turned out REALLY good. That takes some serious talent to pull off. If they didn't know it (like Toxic) they'd find it and play it. They played a wide variety of stuff.  Part of the experience is based on the crowd. We had a couple larger groups (there on a Thursday night, so smallish group in general) that they interacted with a lot, providing some running jokes and comedy. Of course, that also meant some annoying drunk people feeling like they could take over half the show.  My friends were BIG fans of the super cheap beer specials. $1 drafts from Rock Bottom next door. The waitress wasn't great but it could have been that she was the only one there and the layout isn't that easy to navigate. The bar was generally uncrowded though so getting service there was fast.  If in the Waterfront for a night out, definitely a place to hit and have some fun if you are up for some fun and willing to sit through a couple clunkers of songs/jokes. Having a fun loving group of friends to mock things with when they go off the rails a bit will help make it more fun."}
{"text":"I have SO much fun here!!!! The show is awesome!!! And the drinks too!!!! They definitely know how to entertain crowd!!"}
{"text":"$9.75 for a red bull and vodka? I'm sorry, I thought I was in Pittsburgh, not New York City. Sing Sing, a dueling piano bar, is fun, but it would be a hell of a lot more fun if I could have more than one watered down drink before I warbled my way through \"Paradise City\" with the rest of the crowd."}
{"text":"First time here tonight and I must say I wasn't sure if I wanted to go. It seemed like it might be ok but nothing special but I decided to go with friends and man did I have a blast. The $7 door charge was great figuring u had music from 8 until probably 2 am ( we left shortly after 1). The food was not super but good prices reasonable. The beer left something to b desired as they r a micro brewery so u can only get their crafts. I asked for something similar to yeungling but what I got was nothing like it. The musicians were great they made this place awesome. We will b back and this may b our new Pittsburgh hangout"}
{"text":"Came here with a group of girls and didn't have a reservation. We paid the cover, walked in and it was absolutely packed. There was nowhere to even stand. One of our friends was having issues with an expired license and when we found out that not all of us got in, they let us get our $7 cover back without issue.   I recently went with a big group who had reserved about 50 seats. People who were not in the group kept coming in to the reserved area but the staff was very helpful in dealing with the group.   They brew their own beer so do not expect to see any known brands. There are only about 6 beers on top, so if you are more of a light beer drinker you might not be too happy with the beer choices. They also have mixed drinks and wine. The mixed drinks around about $9 and they have a limited number of bottled wines (despite what it says on the menu).   The entertainment was great and I would recommend it for a group outing. But definitely make sure that you have a reservation."}
{"text":"Talented piano players, but I found it annoying they kept pushing for tips all night long. We got the message. Server was nice and songs were good. It was super loud in there so be prepared. Super crowded Saturday night so make sure you come early"}
{"text":"My friend is a piano teacher, so I took it as a good sign that Sing Sing would be quality stuff. It was her birthday, and I didn't really know anything about dueling piano bars. I was picturing glossy black grand pianos with glittering notes, pianists in black jackets and crystal glasses full of red wine. I am really, really glad I was wrong.   It was gritty, bawdy and quintessentially Pittsburgh. First off, the pianos are scuffed to hell, considering the number of tipsy people who sit on them nightly while being mildly humiliated. The musicians hammer away at them, and they're covered with N@ and Sing Sing stickers. It's obvious they've been well-loved. The music is anything but the elevator music I was picturing; it's rock, hip-hop, oldies, pop, and just about any genre imaginable thanks to the request system (send up a piece of paper with some money) and the amazing repertoire of the musicians. For instance, \"Rubber Ducky\" and \"Gangsta's Paradise\" were both featured when I was there, and both performed impeccably. They also honored a request for a Taylor Swift song only to receive $30 and a request for \"anything else,\" which they promptly followed. The musicians also do funny versions of popular songs, and throw in things like \"yinz\" instead of \"you.\"  I saw in awe of the performers for a decent portion of the night. It must take a particularly special type of person to put on a show like this, considering the energy, confidence, wit, empathy, boldness, silliness, cleverness, and sheer talent a job like this requires. They rotate performers in and out so there's not even an intermission. I've read comments about the baseness of the humor, but I had no doubt the guys up on stage were intelligent dudes. They had great personalities: one was about 140 pounds, cheeky, and quick-witted. He acted out every sport in the winter olympics, and was pretty into this 90-something-year-old lady in the audience called Joan. The other had crazy hair and bright blue Chucks, beatboxed as well as he sang, and made it point to play a handful of songs for my friend's birthday. \"I think Ray Charles is the most soulful guy of all time,\" he said when she requested him.  There were tons of people celebrating birthdays, and one big bachelorette party the Saturday night I was there. The performers bring the birthday boy/girl, bachelor/bachelorette, etc. on stage (for a $20 tip, which is pretty easy to scrounge up among friends) and humiliate the hell out of them, i.e. this is not the place to be if you can't laugh at yourself. My friend had a short dress on when she sat on the piano, and they sang a three-minute song about her vagina.  Luckily, the show eclipsed the bad service and overpriced, weak drinks, because those did feature heavily throughout the night. The rest of the staff was friendly, however, and I stumbled on the door guy singing and dancing by himself, which made me smile.  Sing Sing is definitely not an every weekend type of thing (much like Hofbräuhaus), but is a splendid way to celebrate a special occasion. Definitely belongs on every required Pittsburgh experiences list."}
{"text":"He was incredibly sexist/homophobic. He could barely play the piano and when we finally recognized a song we could actually dance to he literally asked me to get off stage because he didn't like another on stage who could actually dance with the girls."}
{"text":"Stopped in at Sing Sing to have a few drinks and hang out with some friends. The entertainment was fun. The guys do a great job singing, playing the instruments, and keeping the crowd pleased. Sing Sing is attached to The Rock Bottom Brewery so they have house beers. I did have the sampler and I enjoyed all six beers I sampled. What a great place to hang out. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Pretty fun place to go every once in a while, but, believe me, by the end of the night you'll be ready to go. The show lasts around 5 hours, by the 3 hour mark you'll be sick of sitting there in the crowd with your $9 a pop drinks listening to the same dirty jokes over and over and over again."}
{"text":"This place has gone significantly down hill.  I've gone to Sing Sing about once a year for the last 6 or 7 years.  When we started going there you couldn't get a seat unless you got there early.  It was always packed.  However, each year the crowd seems to get smaller and smaller.  Crowd is an important component of a piano bar due to the interactive nature of it all.  I was there last Saturday night (8/4/12) and there was about 20-30 people there.  Very slow and boring.  It appears the crowd is no longer allowed up on stage, taking a lot of the interactive fun out of what this place used to be.  This was likely my last time at Sing Sing.  Save your $7 and skip this place.  A real shame because this place was once a lot of fun."}
{"text":"We just happened to stop in after seeing a movie and ended up having SO much fun! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Dueling piano bars in Pittsburgh started at Station Square, and they died out. Then when the chain restaurant magnet \"waterfront\" opened in 2000 the parent company of The Rock Bottom Breweries decided to open Sing Sing in back of The Brewery.  When it first opened it was pretty cool. The very first house band could put on a show that led to standing ovations. I know, I was there. From Stairway to Heaven to Free Bird, Stayin' Alive to She's My Cherry Pie, Elton John to the Boss, they were amazing at sounding like the bands they were covering. Equally incredible were the obscure songs that audience members would shout out, songs only you though you knew, and they would effortlessly sing a good portion of the song, sounding like the band who's song they sung.  But today, Sing Sing seems like it's stuck in the early part of the 21st century. The whole dueling piano, shout out a song to stump the band, Sing us a song you're the piano man has run it's course. I don't hate Sing Sing, but I could never come here more than once a year. It's a been there, done that kind of place."}
{"text":"Had an absolute blast!! Great for any crowd, any occasion, any age! Ashley the waitress was AMAZING"}
{"text":"Always a good time, although it's definitely not a place I would visit often. It's great for groups....which is quite obvious since there are always several folks there for bachelorette  parties and birthdays.   Shut out to the piano players, who can not only play the piano, but also sing, play the drums and the sax. They are funny and know how to keep a crowd entertained. Also know some pretty obscure songs.   My big criticism is the set up. If you don't have a reservation and/or come later in the evening, it's difficult to get seats. Believe me, I don't mind standing, but it does become a bit awkward when you have to keep scooting over to let waitresses and patrons past you. If you do find a seat, it is often littered with someone else's empty glasses."}
{"text":"Picture Billy Joel's \"Piano Man\" DOUBLED mixed with beer, a rowdy crowd, and comedy - Welcome to Sing Sing!  A unique musical experience found in Homestead.  If you're looking to grab a bite to eat or a beer, come on in!  Serving food and brews from Rock Bottom Brewery, Sing Sing keeps your tummy full while you listen to two (or more) amazingly talented pianists take your musical requests.  They'll play anything you'd like, for tips of course.  Wanting to hear Britney Spears?  Toto?  Duran Duran?  Yep, they play that... new or old.  The crowd makes the show, so make sure you come ready for a good time.  If the crowd is dead, it's harder for the Guys to get a reaction.  If you're wanting to have some fun, it can be a GREAT time!  It's the perfect place for Birthday parties - especially if you want to embarrass a friend.  The guys will bring them up to the pianos and perform a little ditty.  For being a good sport, you get the coveted Sing Sing bumper sticker.  Now who wouldn't want that?  Dueling Pianos and brews... time to Shut Up & Sing Sing!"}
{"text":"Piano Man to the tune of Gangster's Paradise...what more do I have to say? Get there early if you want a seat, $7 cover and really fun crowd. We had sucha great time and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I had never been to Sing Sing but I had heard it was a fun place to go. We had finished a birthday celebration dinner and the birthday girl wanted to go karaoke. We headed to Sing Sing. There was a $7 cover charge and my hand was marked with a black light marker. We headed into the main area and was hit with a conversation/singing a song about women's private parts. The we're using the \"P\" word instead of vagina. I know that it's now acceptable to use the \"p\" word since women wore pink hats called \"p\" hats in the walk for women. I, however, think it's crass to use that word. So we weren't off to a good start. I stood next to a shelf on the wall. When I put my hand on it I discovered it was wet with beer. There weren't any napkins or anything to clean my hands or wipe off the shelf. We stood for awhile. We watched them sing versions of Happy Birthday to different people. They also sang special songs to brides to be. They were all a bit crass (to put it mildly).  At your table is papers where you can request a song but you have to include cash (ie tip the pianists). One of the gentleman made a rude comment about the ones without cash were only seen as a suggestion, not a request. I had watched the young lady take it up and when the guy made the rude comment she was embarrassed. I don't think she knew to put money with it.  Our server was great, as were the drinks. I was not a fan of all the crassness but by the end of the night they actually played some great songs and I enjoyed singing along."}
{"text":"What a fun place!! :) The 2 guys playing piano and telling jokes are great! We went there for drinks on weekend and the place had a good crowd. It's definitely entertaining and fun. Not family friendly though!"}
{"text":"What a great time!  This place was awesome!  I wish I lived right down the road, because I could see myself being a regular here.  Honestly, these guys have got some talent, like real talent.  They can play the piano, sing, play guitar, and the drums.  Did I mention that they are all pretty hilarious, too.  I'd easily pay the $7 cover to get in here any day because it really is worth it.    I am sure I will be back in no time at all.  Next time, I am bringing a big group of friends."}
{"text":"We went for New Years Eve so I'm not sure if things were different because of that, but we had an ok time. The cover with buffet and a glass of champagne was $75 per person, which is about average for New Years. The food was good, the drinks were good, the waitresses were attentive and friendly and the owner came over to check in, which was nice. People who came later for the $20 cover charge were getting food from the menu that also looked good. When we got there they were playing a good selection of pop music on the stereo. When the piano players came on we were pretty disappointed. They played about 90% 80s music. We tipped $10 early in the show for them to play something semi-current and they never played anything we requested. I'm pretty sure it's because they weren't familiar with any of it, though none of it was obscure. I was just expecting a good mix of tunes, but it was pretty much all 80s and maybe 3 current pop songs and several country. I hope they realize they're going to have to widen their repertoire to keep up with the younger clientele. We are 35/36 so it's not like we're that young. But you can only handle so much 80s music. I will say that the pianists were SUPER talented and did a fabulous job of playing what they did. Overall, if you're under 40, go somewhere else to party."}
{"text":"What a great time! The pianists are funny, talented, and just a tad crude. But just enough to be funny."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would.  The drinks were on the pricey side, but I didn't head here to get smashed."}
{"text":"We had a bachelorette party there and I would highly recommend. Lots of fun and laughs and the service is as excellent. The show was excellent. Small menu. I would recommend eating in rock bottom first. I would also bring cash since the night is tip driven. It can be a little pricey but for a special occasion defiantly worth it. Not a family setting but great for a birthday or bachelorette party."}
{"text":"While we were in Pittsburgh for the Winter Classic on New Years Day, we figured we'd see what the area had to offer for NYE. My wife and I, along with my friend and his girlfriend hit up Sing Sing in Homestead. It's apparently located on what was the site of one of the largest steel mills in the area. When it closed they turned the entire site into a large outdoor shopping and entertainment development. The only remaining artifacts from what once was, were the nine or so original mill smoke stacks still standing at the primary entrance. Pretty cool.  Sing Sing, which is a piano bar, is attached to the Rock Bottom Brewery and serves a selection of RBB's in-house brews and shares a similar menu. There are no TV's, no sports memorabilia (which is rare for this city), and no big booths for large groups. This place is all about being a cabaret with the focus on the musicians. Mind you this isn't a bad thing, just note that if you want a bar, go next door or across the street to Dave and Busters. I'd say Sing Sing holds about 150 people seated.  This particular night they were hosting a (shocker) NYE's party. For $40 bucks a person you got a choice of two entrees (beef tenderloin tips or lemon chicken), veggies, mashed potatoes, one free drink coupon, a midnight champagne toast, and, what turned out to be over four hours of non-stop music. Again... Pretty Cool.  There were three musicians holding down the fort playing more than just piano (drums, electric synth, bass guitar, and apparently I missed the sax). There was plenty of crowd involvement. As in most piano bars you request songs along with a tip. The larger the tip, the better chance of hearing your song you have. I put three requests on a sheet with a 10 and managed to get two played. Their rendition of Toto's Africa was fantastic and surprisingly, my curve ball got hit out of the park when one of the guys actually knew the tune and words to the Theme from TV's \"Growing Pains.\" I was sold from that point on.  I will take this time to note that this is NOT a family friendly joint. I'm not sure if it was 21+ only but I certainly wouldn't bring anyone too young to drive. A good amount of sexual refrences and strong language awaits you.  Drinks were stiff and not horribly overpriced. I think rail mixed drinks were $7.00 and beers were 6 or so (RBB doesn't brew anything I particularly enjoy so I stuck with rum and cokes). All and all my bill wasn't scary and I'm not used to that on Dec 31st. Waitress staff was really nice and incredibly attentive. No complaints there.   The only down side to everything was group seating as you're sitting at 2-top cab tables. It was easily fixed though as the group next to us was up for rearranging tables from side to side to front to back (allowing us to talk and share food/booze etc), also, being a tourist, we had no idea how hard it would be to get a cab in Homestead. Understandably NYE has its issues with cab availability but we had to wait 2.5 hours for a cab because, as we found out, Homestead is a very suburban community right outside of the city and everyone drives.   Ooops!  All and all a good time and someplace I'd certainly return to if for any reason I'd be back in Pittsburgh... as long as I have a car."}
{"text":"So.Much.Fun!   I WISH I could play a song at the drop of a hat. Too bad I never took piano lessons and I'd probably end up mumbling half the lyrics other than the chorus. Unless it's Salt n' Pepa's Shoop.   This is a really great place to go when you have out of town guests or are looking for a fun place to take someone for a birthday celebration or a fun night out. It's just something different to do other than boozing it up at the bars on a Saturday night.   Keep in mind you'll be paying around a $5-10 cover plus whatever drinks and food you get. The good thing is the food is coming from the attached Rock Bottom Brewery. So a lot of it is restaurant quality good. Plus the brewery beer is actually pretty good! OF course you will be paying restaurant price drinks...so of course they're up charged a bit. But you do pay for the whole experience....so you gotta get into the spirit with some spirits!   The guys who play are incredibly talented. There's 2 guys that will take requests and play songs on the piano. They pretty much play ANYTHING you ask. Contemporary songs, throw back songs, fight songs, rap songs, pop songs. You name it, they play it.   My favorite part is when they switch out to another two guys. They'll all four get on stage and play two piano's, a guitar and drums. They usually rock out with some fun familiar songs (um, Journey, of course!).   The birthday song is seriously the best. They sing to you....and call you some names....with expletives. But in a totally nice way of course. You just have to go!"}
{"text":"Went for my 25th birthday and had a blast! Servers are great, the show was hilarious and had the whole crowd involved. Only bad thing is it can get very expensive!"}
{"text":"Sing sing was the worst service ever. The server was rude and touched all the ladies inappropriately all night that most of them left early. We would have ordered more drinks but he never came back to us AND he said he \"had to\" TRY ( yes he tasted someone's drink!!) one of our drinks to find out what it was!!! Are you kidding me!!!!?????"}
