{"text":"I live really nearby so I gave Sushi Pro a try recently and thought that it was pretty good. To be honest, Center Street is far from a culinary hot spot so I was slightly hesitant about what I was getting myself into. But Sushi Pro delivered and I would certainly go again if I was looking for a local sushi fix.   Currently Sushi Pro has 4.5 star rating on Yelp which puts it amount the finest sushi restaurants in town. On that score I must say that the rating is slightly misleading, now they only have 3 or 4 reviews, so I'm  sure that this will work itself out over time. In my mind Sushi Pro delivers sushi that is sort of in the Sushi Shop spectrum. So decent sushi, but not something to drive across town for."}
{"text":"Cute little sushi restaurant in the Sud-Ouest area. Walking distance from the Atwater marker and right across Charlevoix metro.  Sushi is fresh, has amazing choices and great service.  They also deliver!"}
{"text":"Got take out from Sushi Pro on a recent evening. The party platter was ordered in advance and there were no issues with it being ready for the specified time. I believe it was the 54 piece platter and I thought it was a reasonable price for $53. There was a nice assortment of maki, only a few completely vegetarian ones (boring for me), a few with cream cheese (wasn't a huge fan but it was ok), some shrimp, salmon, crab sticks, white fish maki, mostly also with the sprinkling of crunchy tempura bits (yum). I felt like there weren't too many of any one particular maki so I wasn't bored of what I was eating. We also ordered one '5 seasons' roll which was fresh fish wrapped in a rice paper roll. I love these types of rolls because there's no extra rice to fill you up; just filled with the good stuff! Fish is reasonably fresh, no fishiness at all. I didn't order any sashimi because they only sell it by the piece (pros and cons to that) and I found it expensive. It is decent sushi, not great, but I would order from them again."}
{"text":"Very delicious would come again. Highly recommended! They also offer take out through JustEat. Little burgundy gem"}
