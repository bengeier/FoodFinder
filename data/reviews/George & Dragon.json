{"text":"I loved the food I received which was a shepard's pie.  Loved it, huge portion!  My boyfriend ordered the roast beef, he was not at all impressed and hardly ate any of it.  As for the service, it was pretty bad.  It was a Wednesday so it was not busy but there were two waitresses and two bar tenders.  The non-alcoholic drinks are not listed on the menu and when me and my boyfriend (both at separate times) asked what they had the girl literally ignored us and then walked away.  When she came back with water I asked again and she said, \"Soups?\"  I had to ask yet AGAIN.  After she served us our food we did not see her for 30 mins.  I literally mean she did not come out of the back for 30 minutes and I had to ask someone else to get her so we could get our check and go.  We had wanted dessert but did not want to put up with the service anymore so we left."}
{"text":"As a matter of habit I have gone to the George and Dragon for all my libation needs. Recently I have noticed a big down turn in the staff at this pub.  Specifically the bartenders and servers are inattentive and slightly clueless about the service industry and only mildly affable.  I consider Corin the gold standard of bartenders and miss her a great deal. I have not seen her in quite a while and assume she has moved on which explains the new staff.   Last night some friends and I were going to go to the G&D and I changed my mind at the last minute. I told my friends of the the change of venue and they were briefly shocked and confused (they are sensitive folks).  I reminded them of how bad the service has been the last several times we were there and with very little disagreement they also decided a change of venue was in order.  I like the G&D but the staff has been changing for the worse. Last night was the first night I could confirm that the staff there is costing the owner money. If I had no regard for the establishment then I would just stop going there and never take the time to write this review.  I'll be back in a few months to see how things are going..."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good bar in the downtown area this is definitely the place to be! Their massive selection of beers and cocktails is endless. Although their food is not my favorite, the service and selection of beverages makes up for the 'meh' food.  I have met the owner a couple of times and he definitely is a good time, I love how interactive and attentive the bartenders are and even on their busiest days, they find a way to accommodate you.  During the winter/spring time, you can grab a nice refreshing drink and make your way to the park festivals available at Indian Steele Park. My favorite drink to order is the cucumber vodka and soda. I think this is the only bar that has cucumber vodka, anytime I've asked for it elsewhere I get a crazy look. Their TV's around the bar area are spaced out nicely and the outdoor seating is awesome during the fall/spring months."}
{"text":"good food d prices but not to hefty om the portions"}
{"text":"Something has changed and not for the better since they were on bar rescue. I use to come here after school for lunch and was never left disappointed.   I went again maybe a month ago and something just doesn't feel right. The service is the same as always but the food has taken a turn. It's hard to put into words but I feel like eating here will lead to food poisoning.   Not sure if I can come back for the food :/"}
{"text":"Like many born and raised new englanders, from time to time I get the craving for *quality* British pub food, and in Arizona this can be a disappointment in the making... Until you try George and Dragon.  The fish and chips is hands down the BEST I've ever had. Scotch eggs are always good, again if you have a palate for this type of fare. They are served with a tangy fruit chutney, and everything is complimented by their exceptional list of beers on *fresh* tap.   Late nights can get a little loud and rowdy but otherwise its a fun and relatively clean establishment. Cant wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I mostly come here on Thursday nights for trivia night - and I always have a great time.   The happy hour is decent and I like to take advantage of the $1 off any beer. They have a great beer selection on both draft and by the bottle. As an added bonus, you can add a $1 shooter to your draft at any time. Food-wise, the Shepard's Pie is large and delicious - the perfect comfort food to accompany that pint. The fish and chips is another favorite of mine - the generous fillet is cooked just to the right crispiness.   The atmosphere is the real fun though, if you're into the whole English pub vibe. The place oozes Britain - from the flag painted on the bathroom ceiling to the tube sign tables. Plus the owner, David, is actually from Britain and mingles with the customers as if he was welcoming him into his own home. Be sure to check out the jukebox - it's one of the best I've seen!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is very English. Food was pricey, but quite authentic.   Tried the scotch egg, it was different, but good with the chutney!  Had the lamb roast, seemed a little bland, and the peas were frozen.  Overall, an average meal, with cool atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I like George, so I was really looking forward to their Sunday roast special. I've wanted to try it for at least a few years now, however long they've been running it, anyway. Due to my schedule, today was the first free Sunday afternoon I have been able to. The roast beef was tender, the gravy was perfect and so were the mashed and fried potatoes. However, the Yorkshire Pudding was not good. It's supposed to be golden brown. Mine was very dark brown and burned black around the edges. Basically inedible although I tried. I ate the less burned bottom half, which tasted overcooked, a flavor that repeated on me for the next few hours. When I mentioned that it was overcooked to the waitress, she was very nice and offered to bring me a new one. Then she came back and told me that the kitchen said it was supposed to be that way and all the others looked like that, too. She offered to get a manager so I could discuss it with them. I declined since I have better things to do with my day off than argue that the kitchen should know how to cook the special properly. I did Google Yorkshire  Pudding and looked at all the images just to prove to myself that I was right about the golden brown they're supposed to be. I left very disappointed that my first taste of something I'd waited so long to try was so subpar. All in all, I give the Sunday roast special about a 50%. Cook the Yorkshire Pudding properly and I'll try it again. Otherwise, I'll just go somewhere else Sunday."}
{"text":"The four of us were the only ones in the bar and the manager cane out and told us to stop cussing and bring our voices down. We were literally the only ones in the bar. I just don't get it. Did he hate the gays? He for sure did not appreciate the business we brought him. Never going back again. Such a shame. I want to select zero stars but this app won't let me."}
{"text":"Just like british food is, bland and no flavor at all in my fish and chips. I mean it was well breaded and fried, but the fish and the fries were just missing that one thing that i cant put my finger on... O i know, flavor.  Anyways, the long list of beers on tap is what saved this place from a bad rating."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and cheap beer.  Owner is a great guy that has a lot of pride in his establishment and is very friendly.  Honey sriracha wings are delicious."}
{"text":"Found this place by driving by. It was only place after driving a few miles that was busy, so, must be a good sign on a Sunday night. The waiter was very friendly. We  had to try the fish and chips...outstanding. Not greasy and you actually get fish instead of gready batter with a little fish. Drinks were good and strong. The owner was there and came by to greet our table. After ready some previous post on Yelp, some reviewers thought the owner was rude, I totally disagree. He was a nice guy that cares about his business, otherwise he wouldn't be there and be in business for over 15 years."}
{"text":"There food is really good! Affordable and great food! We live right behind the pub and just walk right over!! Great service and probably one of the best Fish and chips!! Also their shepherds pie is pretty good!"}
{"text":"Great service, divey location, but I liked it.  Stopped for a couple beers and had a Meatloaf sandwich. It was pretty simple, but still good. Fries were a bit boring. I'd probably go back to try some of their traditional English Pub Food, just wasn't in the mood for experimenting last night."}
{"text":"Love the George and dragon! It's my favorite neighborhood pub. The staff is professional and very attentive. The owner is extremely nice and friendly.  Any night I go is a great time, love trivia on Thursday nights. They also have a poker night as well as making sure to have all the soccer games. Always a good crowd great drinks and fun atmosphere.  Food is really good too!"}
{"text":"At one point the George was a favorite haunt, a definite 5-star pub.  But times have changed.  The George used to feature the pinnacle of excellent service, excellent beverages and delicious comfort food.  Unfortunately what's done them in is their service.  The drinks and food are still exceptional, but the service level has faltered.  Really, losing 2 whole stars for degraded service?  I went in again recently after about a year hiatus and I was unfortunately reminded.  Go for the drinks, the food, the darts (real or computer) or the pool... but not for the service."}
{"text":"I've been to GND a couple of times and I am always pleased with the service there. The food is good, especially the shepard's pie, and the beer is cheap. I would recommend that people should check this place out and if you do you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"It's a very lovely chic restaurant. Très Anglaise. The only thing is parking is very limited and be careful if you have a low car . The food didn't impress me. The 'spotted dick' was a pretty good dish. I wouldn't come back, it smelled like backed up water."}
{"text":"I want to love this place, truly I do.  The food is tasty and sticks to your ribs, and the drinks are cheap and strong.  HOWEVER, practically every time I've gone there I've been harassed by this creepy old man that NEVER leaves.  He is there everyday.  Most people consider him charming, but after he leered at me and made lewd comments about my boobs..I don't know.  I suppose it would be fine if I brought a man friend along as opposed to my usual girl troop, but I just get the chills whenever I think of that place now."}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is good and the drinks are fairly priced. We had Katie as our server, she was excellent . We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"We randomly stopped by this bar after dinner and it was such a great experience. Not only did the bar owner himself (David) come over and make sure we were doing well but he let us catch up on trivia and made us feel right at home. David was absolutely great!!!! Never have been approached and welcomed like this before. The beer and drinks were cold and the atmosphere is super welcoming.  There are a few other reviews on this site that mention how \"slow\" the service was or how they had a horrible experience. Yet, those days they mentioned were Sunday night when the bar is on a one server shift. (Any other sever can relate)   And the  \"once in a blue moon\" night they'd be packed, of course, would be on a Sunday night. He even apologized and comps food for long waits.   Anyone wanting a fun, chill environment with better prices for sure on drinks and good food come here!!! I'll definitely come back....and I never Yelp about anything!!!!"}
{"text":"I won't waste my time and money on this place - horrible food and kinda dirty and smelly"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this place. It's got a warm ambience, awesome location,  nice music and chicken curry to die for!  I also like the fish and chips and flaming chicken creole. They've revamped the menu, I'll be checking out the new items soon..."}
{"text":"great food ESP Sunday roast. brings a little bit of home to phoenix.  GREAT BEER and friends can be found here"}
{"text":"minus a star for not having an EPL ticket to show all the games. for F###'s sake you are THE english bar in phoenix and I can't watch my beloved gunners unless they are on ch 167?? come on.   If you are going to hang the flags and scarfs at least have the game, when its 7am and i want to get pissed watching arsenal-chelsea in the '5th' biggest city in the US and I cant, well, it doesn't make daddy happy. haha all in all not a bad place great beer selection nice decor, simply put, its one of those places where you get some drinks in for 2-3 hours, walk out and say \"holy sh!t, the sun is still out????\""}
{"text":"Good french dip. Great bloody mary."}
{"text":"not a big fan of the remodel, kinda liked it because it was dive but the food is still good and most of the bartenders are pretty awesome and the owner is pretty fun so i guess its fine. Best wings EVA!"}
{"text":"So I travel for work and I was staying at the Hilton Garden Inn down the street.  I got off work pretty late and wanted to have something to eat along with a beer or two. I saw some nearby Mexican spot but, I walked by and it didn't seem very welcoming or happening. I found this spot and thought I would just check it out.   Now first appearances can be deceiving, the place seems kinda seedy and definitely divey. You can definitely tell that regulars are a staple here.   I was crazy hungry and discovered they serve food until 1 am everyday... Kinda risky at a lot of places because kitchen staff usually falls off in quality around 11-12pm in most places that look like this.   I ordered a BLT and I have to say it was pretty damn good for the time I ordered. Bacon was crispy and the tomatoes and lettuce didn't taste old. Soooo gooood! Definitely hit the spot.  Super surprised and glad I wandered in to here as it doesn't seem like there is too many options in this area around the late time I showed up. Next time I am in the area, I will definitely be back. Compliments to the kitchen and bar tenders for holding it down. You know its good when you hear a bar tender mention she watches Bar Rescue. Always looking to improve upon themselves!  ( I am personally a fan of the show, so I might be biased in that sense. )   Keep up the awesome work!"}
{"text":"Been going here for about a year every weekend and i love the place. I highly recommend it to all my friends or people visiting town!"}
{"text":"Not bad for my first visit!! Not sure which red door I was supposed to use at 1st. But use the one on the south side ;-)  Okay, service is great during the lunch hour I came by. I'm a big pub guy...cuz I love fish n chips,  and I have to have a Black Velvet!   BONUS HERE! For you black velvet fans, they offer not only Guinness, but Left Hand Nitro Milk Stout...so I asked if they could use the milk stout for my back velvet...YES, so try it, it's AMAZING!  Also,  I went with the lunch menu chicken tacos...I was really expecting like 4 Oz of chicken...boom, I got prolly over 7oz. .. they packed it on and I was pleasantly surprised! I think the owner (dressed nicely) even brought it to my table which shows they go the Xtra mile. The waitress was right there for me several times! She was on point.  The music was nice and low so I could do Internet work, and they have free wifi so I didn't have to bother with putting in a password to use it.   I will be back!"}
{"text":"Stopped by last for dinner while on a biz trip to Phoenix.  Had a beer and the Shepard's Pie as described on the menu.  On the menu the shepherds pie was listed at $10.99 along with a full description: marinated  lean ground beef, mashed potatoes, Sharp cheddar and gravy on request. Pretty simple one would think.   When the bill came I noticed that the shepherds pie was charged at $12. So I asked the waitress. Her response was \"well you ordered cheese and gravy and that's a dollar extra\".  I asked to see the menu again and pointed out that on the menu it's shows that this is part of the dish and says nothing about cheese and gravy being extra. In essence it was part of the meal.  She wouldn't budge I asked to see the manager.  After about 10 minutes of hearing \"we can't find the manager\" or \"the managers not here.\"  A guy comes up and says \"can I help you?\"  I explain the entire situation one more time.   He pulls the menu out, reads it, and then states \"no cheese and gravy or extra it says it right here.\" I asked him to please show me where on the menu it said it.  He looks at it again thinking, furling his eyebrow and says well !I guess I can see how somebody would get that confused.\"  Clearly the menu did not state that. Unlike the cheeseburger where it clearly states cheese extra onions are extra. I commented that his menu was misleading and he's taking advantage of people. He reached in his pocket, Took out a dollar and slammed it on the table. He walked away no apology no \"thank you for your business.\"    I would suggest if you're not familiar with this business or it's business practices, you watch your bill very carefully.  the food wasn't bad, the service was so-so, but the management stinks!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Since discovering the George and Dragon, my friends and I make it a weekly stop. They have a huge selection of beer!  Also, a late night menu of home-cooked food... which is actually delicious!! The outdoor patio is a nice addition, especially for socializing and smoking!  Really, the only decent place to hang out in the NorthCentral Phoenix area."}
{"text":"From the other descriptions I am reading, I believe our party had the same blond bartender.  Granted she didn't curse out anyone in our party, but it wasn't a very pleasant experience.  It's like she can't be bothered and perform her job in pleasant manner.  Why employ anyone like that?  Last time I checked, restaurants were in the SERVICE industry, so provide better service or customers won't come back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch and drink. Was during the day so it was pretty mellow. My server, who was also the bartender was very helpful and friendly. Made me a great bloody mary and I ordered the stuffed meatloaf. It was fantastic. Definitely going to be stopping in again."}
{"text":"Went in for a quick beer but decided to have lunch too. Had the fish and chips and was surprised on the two large pieces of fish I received.the fish was hot and fresh, the chips were nice and hot too. The wife had steak and kidney pie which she said was perfect . They have a great selection of beer and liquor . Would absolutely go back again next time we see a Dbacks game."}
{"text":"George & Dragon is THE place to start your new year off right!  Me and my friends have a tradition of meeting up at G&D on New Years Eve to begin our new year's celebration!  We show up around 2 PM to get a booth and spend a couple of hours gearing up for the big countdown at 5 PM, which is when the new year begins in England.  Although it is always packed during the celebration, the staff is always super nice and able to keep up with the orders from our table.  Just before the countdown begins the staff passes out champagne and party favors to everyone in the bar!  We've never had a bad experience here and plan to continue our tradition for years to come!!"}
{"text":"I just wonder if this place is still haunted. I put in a lot of circuits 4 ISDN telecasts for the phone company 25 years ago in this place and the guy showed me closed circuit TV of rather strange things going on inside. I just wonder if it's still haunted or not?"}
{"text":"Hello all!  This place is great.  I went to high school right down the street and have lived in the neighborhood forever.  You can always have a good time.  Good atmosphere, great beer, and great location.  Why I didn't give it 5 stars:  Well, they have this slay the dragon thing...if you can drink all the beers on this paper they give you, not all at once, although I guess I would try that...but, you are suppose to get a T-shirt that says, \"I slaid the Dragon\".  Well, the problem is, they don't keep all the beers in stock so...boo.  Also, it kind of is a two-faced place...one Friday you'll go there and you wont be able to park and there will be standing room only inside...but the next Friday it's dead.  But, please go check it out, it's really awesome and the owners are knows to mingle with the crowed, can't miss them, they're the ones with the English accents.  CHEERS!"}
{"text":"I like going to George & Dragon for a beer because I know that, for the most part, G&D is dependable. You can always expect a crowd of people, you can always depend on the beer, and you know that there is good pub food. However, other than being dependable, it isn't too much more than that. I really wish the service was a little better - the waitstaff and bartenders always seem a bit grumpy to me, as if they'd like nothing more than to have nothing to do with me."}
{"text":"A cool pub serving authentic English dishes. Order up a pint, play some pool and try the bangers & mash, fish 'n chips, or their burger."}
{"text":"Average bar, chill vibe. Nothing too special or excellent about the place besides their bloody Mary's, those are on point!"}
{"text":"Great surprise. The steak pie was awesome!"}
{"text":"Been going to G&D ever since moving here to Phoenix a little over 3yrs ago.  My first experience at the place was a few weeks after moving.  It was the middle of August and the AC and all refrigeration at the place had gone out.  Despite the rising heat in the place the bartenders were still moving quickly behind the bar and trying to make the most of the situation for the customers.  They let people know the situation and were knocking down prices as beers started to get a lil warm before things got fixed later on in the early evenning.  I noticed that lots of people still stuck around even with it getting pretty warm inside.  That to me meant on a regular day this was a good spot.  Ever since that first time and thinking there was a reason people stuck around, my thoughts have been proved right each time I go.  I have never had a bad time when I go into G&D.  The food is great, especially with the newer menu and cooking staff.  I have yet to have a bad item when I order food.  Most recently had the Turkey Club and it was a huge sandwich and very good.  The wings are always great and the potato soup on Thursdays is a good eat during Trivia.  Yeah, I said it, soup in AZ.  Staff has always been great.  Like the servers at any and all restaurants, there are good servers and ok servers.  At G&D it is no different but here the OK servers are better than most you will find at other small pubs and bars.  When it gets overly busy orders can run slow but that should be expected during a huge rush.  Over all I have found that the staff is great and if you go there to enjoy yourself and treat them well, they return the favor.  I have been going to the G&D long enough that I have gotten to know most of the staff and have not had a bad experience with any of them.  I am a big fan of this place and try to make it there once a weekend.  I rarely miss a Trivia night on Thursdays.  Highly recommend hitting up the G&D, one of the better spots I have found here in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Every time we come to this pub, we go home satisfied and happy to have gone once more.  My favorite is fish and chips, but there are plenty of beer selection to make any event, dinner or even an appetizer a great one.  I'll come back very soon.  My kind of bar!"}
{"text":"Omg! Authentic, great portions, amazing staff, great atmosphere! My buddy and I seriously saw it and walked past it to go to restaurant next door, but they had a 45 min wait. We can back and it honestly surpassed their neighbor (experience in eating there already)!  This is honestly a hidden gem in Phoenix that I've never heard of. If you're looking for something different, low key, authentic then this is the place. The prices are amazing, the staff is spot on (and some seem to have a British/Sottish accent)!   I don't write these that often, so for me to mention and do this is a sign that it had a great impression on me. You can't go wrong! Give it a try if you're down for an authentic, low key and easy on your wallet journey away from the typical desert life!"}
{"text":"I had spotted dick!!!!!!!  Its not what your thinking pervs.  It was a dessert.  It is bread putting with currants in it.  What can I say English food and English beers how gross!!!  I am not a fan of either..  But hey they do have a full bar and good burgers and chicken tenders.  Plus, everything is reasonably priced especially for the size of the drinks they serve.    The atmosphere is pretty cool with all the English decor, big booths and the eclectic group of patrons.  Some still seem like they are stuck in the 80's listing to their metal bands but hey that is why I like living downtown because you see all types which is cool."}
{"text":"I went to GD for the USA v. England World Cup match. My group arrived just after 5:30 a.m. and we were about 40 people back in line!   So I could go on and on but the point of my review is to brag on the service. The staff had their jobs cut out for them that day! GD must have had close to 400 people packed inside, way over fire code- shhh it was a very special occasion. Of course service was a bit halted as you could barely move, but she kept the beers coming and everyone was happy.   Also I was pleasantly surprised because I enjoyed the English Breakfast more than I thought I would. Seriously, it is worth trying.   Thanks for the service on quite a spirited day!"}
{"text":"Came in here for a quick lunch with my wife. It's along the light rail so it's easily accessible. Seems to be an authentic English pub - it's dark and dingy, and football scarves and flags adorn the walls. We sat in a booth and I ordered a burger while my wife tried a veggie curry. I wasn't impressed with the grub but it was cheap so can't complain. People come here to drink anyway, not to eat. I'll return to watch the football again but just make sure you eat at home before hand."}
{"text":"Stopped in to meet friends this afternoon and after realizing they were running late, we popped next store to grab a quick lunch before they showed up (g&d's greasy menu did not sound appetizing). When our friends arrived not more than 20 minutes later and we walked back over to find George had towed our car from the parking lot!! We had full intentions of spending copious amounts of money in that dirty dive, but now I will never return. They towed our vehicle to cave creek northern valley and the 200$ spent on the tow, we could have spent on drinks celebrating in this establishment! I'll never be back and being in the industry I will make sure to spread the negative word!!! Thanks George and dragon, your greedy jealous owner does not go unnoticed! No wonder the place was a ghost town and smells like garbage!"}
{"text":"I have a somewhat love-hate relationship with the George. It used to be my Friday night bar for months. I always preferred it's dingy, dive-likeness over the pretentious, lame Scottsdale bars near where I live. Sometimes I miss camping out on the patio in the back corner, chain smoking with friends and people watching but the George has lost it's charm for me. My purse was stolen the one and only time I didn't bring it with me to the bathroom. I did leave it with a group of dudes thinking it would be safe but no. I've seen three arrests out front. One time these junkie looking dudes were licking each other's hands in front of the patio until the cops came. I've seen a girl pee her pants INSIDE the bathroom and then proceed to slip on the sidewalk which was wet from the misters nearly cracking her head open. Many, many stories came from that place. My last visit was months ago and I couldn't wait to leave. It's just not fun anymore. So long, George."}
{"text":"Last night was my first visit to George and Dragon....and unfortunately, it will probably be my last.  My boyfriend, my daughter and I decided to go there for FATHER'S DAY.  We walked in the front door and stood in the middle of the room facing the bar.  There were maybe 6 or 7 occupied tables--it wasn't busy.  So we stood there, unsure of wether we sat ourselves or waited to be seated.  3 servers were present as well as a blonde bartender who totally ignored us.  Finally we asked if we sat ourselves and the bartender said to go right ahead.  We picked a booth facing the bar and sat.  And sat........and sat......and sat.  One male bartender seemed to be working in a back room only.  Another girl stood alongside the bar, staring out @ us, drinking a soda as we sat there with no menus.  The bartender, who was maybe 15 feet from us, would look @ us sideways, and look away.  My boyfriend works for the City of Phoenix.  He's a HUGE tipper.  Maybe we don't look like much, but...??????? We waited 12 minutes (I am a server/bartender myself, so I watch greet times closely).  Finally we stood up and walked out...walked RIGHT past the bartender and she never said a word!!!!!!!!!!  I did call a spoke to a managernamed Bill, who sounded shocked.  I hope he took care of the problem or they will lose a LOT of business =(  We ended up having a very nice Father's Day dinner @ The Black Forest Mill...thumbs up to them!"}
{"text":"This place is solid. Good beer, good pub food, and they price everything decently. For every other new English/Irish pub that pops up, does a good few months, and goes out of business, this place is still here. Don't expect haute-culture and fine dining, just pub grub and beers. Not great, not horrible, but it's what it is.  The market is there, I just don't know why other places seem to have such a hard time filling the demand."}
{"text":"The only reason they get 2 stars is because I half way enjoyed myself the first time I went there the night that basically everyone in phx lost power a few weeks back .. Even then it wasn't all that great. Last time I wanted to order the French dip or English dip so badly but no one wanted to wait.   Tonight I'm sitting at home so hungry and pretty sick and wanted something other than McDonalds or filbertos so I call and ask when their kitchen closes and they told me 1230, I said thank you! And they just hung up. Rude . I called back and ordered food. I get there to pick it up and told me they actually didn't even have one of the items I had ordered and when I get home excited to eat my French dip.. There was not even any aju sauce for the sandwich. I went against the bad review for this sandwich because I thought the person was just complaining about every little thing.. But I too feel the same way.. No aju and it was not very good at all .. Probably will not be back.   Like I get it.. It's pub food but I have worked in many in the past that were better quality. Js.. I'm the most non picky and laid back person. It takes a lot for me to even write a review ."}
{"text":"Great pub! Everyone is friendly and fast service. Me and my best friend come here every weekend to enjoy some wings and beer."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting the George and Dragon for a little while when I pass thru Central Phoenix. The food is excellent, especially the cornish pasties. I enjoy the atmosphere, darts, and booze but I got to say that the service is hit and miss. There are 2 servers that are polite and most the rest aren't happy to be there. Sometimes there attitude goes hand in hand with the quality of service. I will continue to eat and drink there though the service is hit and miss."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  If you haven't been back since the makeover, GO!!  The staff, the food and the experience are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Great place to come with friends..   Sort of a dive but I like it. Awesome food, great pours and friendly staff.   My favs are shepherds pie and the bangers & mash. Still need to try the fish & chips.. Heard it's amazing."}
{"text":"I have never been to the UK, so I don't know how to compare what I ate to traditional English food.  I know that what I ordered, the pastie, was very delicious, as was the peas that came with it.  My husband and daughter split the Shepard's Pie and they both loved it.  Great beer as well.  I saw some other customers with the fish and chips and they looked great-I think next time that will be what I get.  The decor was aged and a little dusty, but all in all, it was a really good meal."}
{"text":"Went there Friday night, and absolutely amazing place.  One of my favorites actually.  Food is reasonably priced, the staff told me they sent my food back due to it not being cooked properly, overall I love this place.  I will become my new bar in the future.  I will always recommend this place to my friends and co workers"}
{"text":"Always a good time here. The food is consistently good and the staff is awesome. Shout out to Laura, Sammy, Kat, and Jenna! Stop in sometime and find out for yourself how good this joint is."}
{"text":"This place is dirty, the owner is miserable and the food is terrible. It's amazing they have been in business this long."}
{"text":"You should post a rainbow flag outside. The women there tonight were more masculine than the men. Good fish though."}
{"text":"Really authentic british fare. The ambiance is true to the food. The staff is absolutely friendly and knowledgeable on the menu.  They've been here 18 years  - that says a lot.  The appetizers are fabulous; the wings are my favorite!  They come out hot, they're spiced nicely, they're HUGE compared to most wings and you can order them crispy..and they come out crispy!  The prices are very fair. It's just a fun, solid place that is very comfortable and you are guaranteed a good meal.  Good parking, and there's a rail stop within 1 block.  I totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with a black and tan and wings at George and Dragons. Good music, Good Vibes."}
{"text":"OK, Shoes is in Phoenix and went on a walk from the hotel. I wanted some good British Beer on this very sultry day. But alas I wasn't impressed by the beer list. So, I had a brew from Portland, OR. I also thought I'd find some British eats. Naw, just a burger and fries. The place has been open since 1995, and well it has lost it's thematic origin. The burger was good, the beer was good but I could have had that anywhere in America."}
{"text":"No wonder Americans think English food sucks if they've eaten at the George and Dragon that's how they got the idea This is the worst English food I have ever eaten in the United States and I'm English"}
{"text":"I feel lik eI say this in all of my ratings, but I really do love this place! They have great comfort food, fresh vegetables (which are hard tom find even in upscale places) and it's got the classic pub feel, not the American \"pub\" feel, if you know what I mean. The only down side is that the wait staff/bartenders are hit or miss, the ones that are a hit are fantastic and genuinely friendly, but the ones that are a miss are LAME! Terrific place for groups also."}
{"text":"I've been going to G&D for a few years for drinks, but the other night we had a craving for fish and chips.  My GF had the fish, I had the chicken curry.  They both were delightful.  Our first waitress was literally on her last minutes of her shift and was understandably groggy, but friendly and funny, her replacement was great too!  I am so glad that the phony show \"Bar Rescue\" didn't ruin this place with the usual junk they do to places (make it bright inside, make a bunch of fruity drinks to bring in women).  The food was great, the servers were great, the atmosphere was dark and a bit divey....that is what makes it good."}
{"text":"Today I finally made it to George & Dragon.  I was in a pinch and looking for a place that had Telefutera so I could watch my favorite soccer team (Chicago Fire) play.  I called George & Dragon and was told they could accommodate.  One packed light rail ride later I was there and ready to get my game and drink on.  George & Dragon is my type of place.  The decor has been described by other Yelpers as very British.  Since I have not been the the UK, I cannot attest to that but it does look like what I think a British pub should look like.  It actually reminded me of the Winchester in Shaun of the Dead.  The football scarves are always a nice touch.  Perhaps one day I'll donate a USA or Fire scarf and see if they put it up among the UK clubs scarves.  The beer selection was not as good as I had hoped it would be but it's still better than most. Today I was in the mood to drink German despite being in a British pub so I opted to drink Spaten.    For lunch I ordered the Shepherds Pie and it was amazing.  It's the third different shepherds pie I've had in metro Phoenix and it might be the best one.  My team lost an ugly one and it spoiled my day a bit but I was happy to have made my first visit to George & Dragon.  It will not be my last.  With easy access to light rail I plan on being back soon.  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Great, low-key vibe.  Food is great!  They ran out of turkey for my friend's sandwich, so they comped her beers! Portions are HUGE, so split your food with a friend- even sandwiches.  Service was spectacular and very friendly, even though they were slammed when we arrived."}
{"text":"Like an old friend with an open door and a warm hug G&D is always there to feed you while getting you pleasantly sauced. The servers, by definition, are dark haired, tattooed sirens aloofly peddling the classic English fair.  The bangers and mash is enough for two, the fish 'n chips are decent but not great and if nothing else it is great that both are under ten bucks. Drinks are decently priced and they have real gingerale. (mhhh wiskey ginger) The owner either used to do tons of coke or still does because he is always frenetically bouncing around the bar talking a mile a minute to his regulars. I have been here on new years, week nights, weekends and anything in between; it is always good times. I believe there is even a lightrail stop right outside.  If you haven't been this is a must for any hardcore AZ pub-crawler."}
{"text":"This is a very good English Pub, Restaurant.                                                  The food is extremely authentic. Chicken Pie is my fav, although it might also be the Fish and Chips!  Great British Tea,and i love the fact that a portrait of the Queen is in the main dining room.                                        The decor is very British. I am not a Drinker however, everyone says there (patrons) the beer is fantastic.  Servers are nice, Manager Keith is fabulous. He is always there to answer questions! Lots of fun!"}
{"text":"What a fantastic establishment. The choice of menu items are true to the English heritage it claims. We had the daily special- corned beef and cabbage. Wow! It was delicious and the portion size was huge. The soccer match was playing and the patrons were enjoying the game with food and booze. The management was cordial and accommodating, making the time spent inside unbelievably enjoyable. The location is the cherry on top. Perfect for anyone venturing downtown Phoenix. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Despite having a really sweet and attentive server, honestly, this place is pretty gross. We wanted to check it out since it has been a Phoenix landmark. We saw, we drank, we ate mediocre food and crossed it off our places to go again. After touching and looking at the super greasy menu, I decided what I wanted to try then went to wash my hands. Granted, this place is not high class, but holy S@&$ the bathroom was disgusting! No lock on the stall and when I went to flush, a spider ran over the top of the tank and dropped onto the handle.. So.... I did not flush for fear of the spider.. Yuck!! So on to the food.. Reuben sandwich.. Hardly any meat, soggy bread and quite a small sandwich accompanied by a huge pile of grease laden fries.. The fried fish was described to me by my dinner guest as being way over cooked, grease laden and difficult to eat. Yet he did not want  to complain while there which prompted me to write this. Bottom line - your servers are really great and you are damn lucky for that! They are your first and last impression of your business. Your food is not worth the price and your restaurant is grossly dirty, but your staff rocks!! You better keep them happy!!"}
{"text":"Ah yes well its a case of wish I was there, when I lived in Phoenix its was great, the focal point of the British/football community great food drink and service a fun place to be. Funny since I left Phoenix and whilst on my travels once people know I use to live there one of the first questions asked by many is about the George and Dragon. I find people have either like me lived there or traveled to Phoenix and being to the pub and loved it. Yep wish I was there, that's probably gonna be how you feel too.  Andy P"}
{"text":"Place was fine. Was a busy night. Started by getting drinks at the bar but ended up sitting at a high table. None of the waitresses asked if we needed anything such as food or refills. We didn't but it would have been nice to have been checked on. We were there for drinks and to relax. We will probably try it again."}
{"text":"Had to bump G&D up to an A-ok status. My advice: Don't sit at the bar. Get a table where a cool waitress will help you even when it's crazy busy! Bumped up one star due to better service!"}
{"text":"I heard Bar Rescue was here. Could a fooled me! If Jen is your waitress, run! Food was pretty good and the beer was cold but service really was bad. David, owner, was busing tables and said he was doing it because his people were too busy. Not going well John Taffer!"}
{"text":"Ladywife and I have been coming to The George since before it opened (we dropped in on construction because we'd heard about it and wanted to see).   It used to be great. A little eccentric, a little eclectic ... but hey, that's the British for you. The food was everything I'd grown up with ... cornish pasty ... roast beef and Yorkshire pud ... steak and kidney pie ... bangers and mash ... honest-to-god roast potatoes ... and for desserts, spotted dick and trifle. THIS was the life. We and our friends ate there often.   Gradually, over several years, G&D slipped downhill. Don't know why. I know light rail construction kept much of their business away for the years it went on, but the rot had set in some time before that. Favorite items began disappearing from the menu. The place became dingy, kind of unkempt. Ladywife and I had our last (pre-Bar Rescue) meal there about five years ago, and it was awful.   So some months after Bar Rescue we decided to go back and inspect. First and second, the menu was a surprise -- one back-and-front sheet in place of the old eight-page plastic-covered volume that would almost cover your whole table ... and stripped down to a bare minimum, with only a handful of items uniquely British any more.  Oh, well.   Still, the food we ordered was nicely prepared, served relatively promptly and with all the tastiness of the old days.  (Except for the peas ... they used to be EXCEPTIONAL. Now, they're what you'd get anyplace.)  We were happy. The place was packed,, and customers seemed happy. Chatting with David (the owner), *he* seemed happy.   Things are going well. G&D has been pleasantly revived, and we'll be back.   Btw, don't pay much attention to the negative reviews. It's a PUB, for Pete's sake, not Eddie Matney's. Cut them some slack -- the food is really good, the beer flows nicely, the service is what it is, and you should go."}
{"text":"We were here twice. Every place (even with Guinness) can't be a 5 star place so some of the draw backs are it smells kind of funky and the parking lot really needs lines.   Both times I think the tap needs to be replaced because the stout was not as thick and creamy as usual. But the pubs in the UK did spoil me. The portions were a little small. We had to order seconds to feel full.   Make sure you try the HP sauce on whatever you order. This is a thick, tangy steak sauce that makes every flavor soar.   It does smell a little bar-like inside."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic. Me and my boyfriend went and enjoyed the food greatly. He said, \"I only wish they had more food.\" I'm only giving four stars because although the foods was good and our waitress fantastic, I've been here before and know it can take some time to get your food; other than that this place is great. Divert ask me about their alcohol though, because I don't drink. They did seem to have a large selection available however."}
{"text":"Hitting up a baseball game we took the light rail into downtown & parked the car at the good ol' George & Dragon. We have been here 2x and once to the now dead & gone G&D at the Hampton Inn off the I-10 and 143 freeways. We've never had the time to eat. It was just a place we'd hit for some Stellas or cider waiting to do something else or just wasting some time. Great place to hang out for quickie beer. The hubs is on a quest for the best fish tacos & the best fish & chips. Me not so much. So he suggests trying the fish & chips. I cave even though I'm full to the gills because I'm afraid if I don't say yes this time he may just leave my fat a$$ there. So we try the almighty fish & chips. He's expecting greatness he's disappointed. I wasn't expecting anythng & full so of course I didn't think it was the best either. Don't take this like it sucked by any stretch of the imagination. It's just not what we thought we'd get from an English pub known for it's fish & chips. I mean it was just ok. I think it was missing some seasoning on the fish & I personally dislike any steak fry that has salt as the only seasoning. Totally me totally my taste. If I'm gonna throw a fry down my gullet with all of it's artery clogging ways it's going to be for a reason. Like um I don't know taste. It's going to be goo-od period. The fish is fried perfectly, crispy, hot & juicey. The fries aka chips are just that & just what you get when ordering fish & chips. So bare in mind the fish & chips are good the service is spot on & the place is fun to hang out at. Good times at the G&D!"}
{"text":"I always seem to come on trivia night (Thursdays) service at the bar is on par, table service can be a little slow with no water refills but the staff is friendly and apologetic, fish and chips really good two huge pieces, a lot of reviewers say \"it's not authentic fish  and chips\" my answer to them is then go to the UK and eat there, in Phoenix we take what we can get and I thought it was good (having had fish and chips all over the UK) the decor after the remodel is fun and warm .....I like this place it has character which is more than I can say for a lot of restaurants/bars in AZ"}
{"text":"It's fine. Kind of a dive but it's cozy and quiet on weekdays. Service was nice. Food was just average: some of the meat was dry and flavorless, the flavors were overall forgettable, but it's hearty and you get a LOT of food for what you pay! A nice place for a large, affordable, and filling dinner."}
{"text":"Wow, can you please shut that group of obviously lonely and depressed middle-age men yelling and singing at the top of their lungs as they wait for The Reaper to collect their souls The Hell up, please???"}
{"text":"The biggest challenge here is getting your hands on a drink menu. IF, and I mean IF, you are able to obtain one of the elusive drink menus you are in for a treat.  George and Dragon is really different than other local bars and pubs. It's owned by a true Brit with a real cockney accent and run by a bunch of tatted up punk rock looking girls. The contrast of the football flags and the Camden town style of the wait staff makes the atmosphere interesting.   There is a good crowd at the bar. Except for the usual few a-holes you find in every bar, The G & D is patronized by hipsters and business men alike. Families eating bangers and mash sit seats away from rowdy college kids. Stock brokers drink ale next to drunkards slamming whiskey and stylish career gals drinking cosmos. It's a unique mix rarely found in Arizona.  The food is pretty good too. English food is by definition terrible. I lived in Cambridge for a few months and found it hard to digest most traditional English fare, but G & D does a good mix of American classics and British favorites. Even the cold egg thing that my boyfriend loves (and I hate) seems to be a hit with most patrons.  George and Dragon is a great place to meet with friends, have happy hour with co-workers or sit alone and stew. Either way you should have a good time in this gem of a pub.   Don't forget to try the fried pickles!"}
{"text":"We were out pretty late looking for a place with a kitchen that was open late, I called George and Dragon and they told me their kitchen was open until 1am! We walked in at midnight and were told we could sit wherever we liked. There are so many good things on the menu, we picked the Halo burger and it was absolutely amazing! It is perfectly seasoned and the crispy cheese on it is so so good! We also got the French dip and the au jus was suuuper tasty! The fries are thick and crispy yet soft on the inside. Yummy! I felt bad because I went to ask the bar for a server because i wasn't sure how the service worked when i walked in and when i turned around the server was already standing at our table (sorry!) anyway we had a wonderful attentive server, she even made me a cherry pepsi! Thanks for a great experience. We will definitely be coming back as we always get hungry when its late. Now its time for sleep because after all that food im in a food coma."}
{"text":"I like the look of this place. The food was not good and actually made me and my friend very sick. Bathroom was SCARY and non  air conditioned. I really wanted to like this place but it just wasn't good. I liked the atmosphere other than the bathroom.. I could drink here but wont eat here again."}
{"text":"I really like this spot! The servers and customers are very friendly. They have pool tables and plenty of TV to watch the game.  I ate the meatloaf, which was not awesome, but it was pretty good. I'll go back to find out how good is their fish and chips."}
{"text":"I gave it three stars because I can see the potential and the beer was cold. It needs a bar rescue to rejuvenate this local watering hole. The service is always friendly and it definitely has that European charm. England has several similar mom & pop pubs. The bangers & chips are go to when I visit. Great spot for futbol."}
{"text":"We came here all the time 6-7 hears ago, but we started visiting other places when their quality started to slip. We went there recently after \"Bar rescue\" had spruced up the place- what a joke. all they did was take out the booths that we like and replace them with uncomfortable chairs and cut the menu down, removing tasty items they used to have. so sad. They could win us back, but get back to what brought people in in the first place- great food with great service."}
{"text":"Good service, food and prices but a god awful sewer smell permeated the entire place!"}
{"text":"Slow service and $17 for a double Glenlivet during happy hour- the drink was obviously not a double and sat on the bar for 20 mins before being brought to our table, so it was watered down. We pointed this out, and the waiter did nothing about it and still charged us full price. Ridiculous. Won't be returning, which is too bad, because my colleagues and I were looking for a local watering hole. This place will not earn our business again."}
{"text":"This place is decent.  I live within walking distance but have only been once if that tells you anything.  It's just normal pub grub, and none of it is really impressive.  The slay the dragon program is kind of fun, although I haven't made much of a dent in my card because I never go.  Supposedly they have quiz night on Thursdays which might cause me to up my star rating..."}
{"text":"Oh King George, King of the Phoenix dive bars I live so close I require no cars You have pub food of plenty  And patrons a many But consuming such grease Makes me feel like a piece Your beer doesn't please me And leaves me feeling queasy A dungeon of darkness With lights so dim A place void of nobles and youth Most patrons barely have more than a tooth My visits here leave me full of sorrow I guess see you again tomorrow...."}
{"text":"I LOVE the Halo Burger, Stuffed Meatloaf, and the Cottage (they call it Shepherd's) pie. The Fish and Chips are the bomb. The food is fantastic, the drinks are inexpensive, the staff is friendly and hospitable. This is a great neighborhood pub right on the light rail line. I DO wish they would hire a professional cleaning service for at least once a month."}
{"text":"The fish and chips is where it's at. The coleslaw is pretty much the best i have ever had. The shepherds pie is excellent as well. The best pub food in Phoenix by far."}
{"text":"Great drink prices, good food, fun atmosphere, and friendly staff. We've been coming here for Thursday trivia for a few months now. It's a great place to get together with friends! The crowd is a nice mix and it's definitely not a pretentious place."}
{"text":"Yes, it's true.  You will hear British accents here. One of the better neighborhood bars in central Phoenix, George & Dragon is also one of the best British pubs in Arizona.  A very friendly and diverse crowd - I made some of my first friends here in AZ at George & Dragon.    Not exactly like a typical British/Irish pub crowd - as this place is frequented by a more punk-rock, rag-tag, counter-culture bohemian crowd.  Whatevs.  It keeps things interesting.  People playing darts or pool are always up for talking and invite you to join in.  The bartenderesses here are always very nice and well endowed at the same time.  Beer selection is among the best in Central Phoenix it would make any discerning Brooklyn hipster drool with delight. Chimay, Tetley's, Stella Artois, Kronenburg, Boddington and Anchor Steam are among the brews available. The jukebox is a gem - everything from The Kinks to the Police, David Bowie and Tom Jones.    No Country Karaoke on Mondays is a riot, and has one of the hugest song lists in town from which to choose.  They have also recently added a 1960s British mod dance night on Wednesdays."}
{"text":"An update to my original review, I just learned that those Curry Wings are something off the menu so please keep it a secret or they won't let me come back.  Now how about that Fresh skin on Haddock fillet I keep asking about G&D? If you do decide to serve it sometime please make sure you order them in fresh 10lb trays from Boston, put it on Facebook and I'll be there to consume an order or maybe even two I miss it so much. Now something like that would pretty much sum up my fish on Friday dilemma in this dusty old town."}
{"text":"I've been feeling kind of homesick (for Chicago [i got over it])) lately. Went to this bar/restaurant a few weeks ago and it felt like home. When I first stepped in there was that old nasty smoke smell. The Clash was playing on the jukebox. I'm not a smoker and I usually don't like that smell, but I instantly felt a sense of happiness. I know! Pretty wackadoo. But right away it felt like it had some history to it.   Love the big booths andthe service was great. The waitress was so friendly, but not in a so bubbly I'm going to vomit kind of way. The fried zucchini and sausage rolls were yummolicious. Cornish pasty was good. Yorkshire pudding. Not so good. It was almost solid. Yorkshire pudding is suppose to be puffed up and hollow. And it was in this yucky gravy. But I forgive them. You can't be too picky about English cuisine. But I will definitely come back to try the fish and chips."}
{"text":"I always pass this place and have been in here a few times.  Uh, it sucks - no simpler way to put it.  Sure, it's trendy to go to a \"british pub\" and have a glass of ale.  However, if that's what you're looking for - DO NOT ENTER THIS PLACE.  The clientelle is interesting to watch but the wait staff is very slow and if you're sitting outside, be prepared for EXTREME SLOW!  Then again, maybe being outside is good because then you don't have to have your clothes soak in the INTENSE cigarette smoke that has lingered in this joint for many years.  Oh, did I mention that CEMENT TABLES outside are beyond uncomfortable?  Well, they are!  If that's not bad enough, the little holes in the middle of the tables are filled with cigarette buts.  Also, the FISH AND CHIPS are disgusting and play second fiddle to even LONG JOHN SILVERS!"}
{"text":"We came in here a little earlier than usual to grab some dinner on the way to a concert.  We sat at a table for about five minutes and received no attention from the waitress.  We pretty much know already that great service here requires sitting at the bar, so when a couple left, we snagged the bar seats and were waited on immediately.  Sadly, our two favorite menu items no longer exist at the George:  the philly and the sliders.  Well, this meant we had to look at the menu.  I decided on the English kabash, and it was good!  Ground and seasoned beef and lamb mixture with the fixins. It still doesn't replace my beloved philly, but it's good to know some tasty bar food remains here."}
{"text":"During my last few months in Phoenix, we were coming here on a near weekly basis. Not only do they have a hefty beer selection (mainstream stuff, but some goodies nonetheless), but they have decent waitresses, hilarious trivia and karaoke, and really good pub food. I'm a big fan of their fish and chips (although it doesn't compare to Santa Moncia, CA's Ye Olde King's Head....but really, nothing does), and I remember really enjoying their chicken tenders and their Chicken breast entrees. Their kitchen is open super late, which is one of the best things about them. Their prices are low, and they've got just the right amount of divey-ness to them that makes you really love the place. Ample parking, pool table, games, and all around, a non-pretentious good neighborhood gem. And it's off the light rail, too!"}
{"text":"The food is good and the service is AMAZING!  If you come here ask for Sammy!  She's literally the best bar server I've had!"}
{"text":"G&D is one of my favorite spots to meet up with friends! They have great Happy Hour specials and even when it is not happy hour, their prices are very reasonable.   Almost daily they have something going on. Poker, Trivia (my fav) and karaoke, sports.   Their food is quite delicious as well. My favorites are the Hummus and the Curry Chicken.  Their staff is wonderful as well. Customer service is huge to me and they are top notch! Always a smile to go with your drink. The owner is great as well. He walks around telling jokes and interacting with the customers.   Give this place a try, you will not be disappointed!   Cheers!!"}
{"text":"I had been to George and Dragon a few times before the make over and I was excited to see it after it was \"rescued\".  I had some time with my oldest daughter today so I decided to drive from Chandler to Phoenix to check the place out.  We walked in, found a table, bushed off the dust and immediately heard a \"mother-f'er\" and \"I wanna f**** all day\" and another f-word from the speakers.  I have come to learn that this sonic atrocity is called \"Wax\" by Rosana.  We left before a waitress  came to our table.  Even if I weren't with my daughter I would sit a place playing crap I like this.    Even when I was 21 I wouldn't have thought it was cool.    Too bad."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy. Fish/chips and Shepherds pie! More than enough and delicious. Love my bartender Britney. Great personality, prompt on service and personable! Glad we came in!"}
{"text":"Love this place and will continue to go! The honey siracha wings are amazing! Their beer is always great."}
{"text":"I am back with a much improved experience. Stopped by last night in a hurry. Sat at the bar. A lovely and professional server told us not to worry, poured some beers, and put in our orders before we could even sit down. We were then served some of the best fish and chips in the city within 10 minutes.   Great experience. Great food. Great service."}
{"text":"Excellent service by Amber. We had a very large crew and she always does a fantastic job keeping up with us."}
{"text":"What horrible service!!! The bartender is incredibly rude and the manager could not care less. I could not believe you could have service like this. I will never go back and I recommend you don't even step foot in here. They will gladly take your money and give you nothing for it. Horrible experience!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a whim and was pleasantly suprised!  This is a great bar with great food.....try the scottish egg!  The bartender sat and told me about other sites in thePhoenix area that I should go check out!  Very friendly place.  I will be returning !"}
{"text":"Food was ok - atmosphere is fine.  I was not overly impressed on my two visits but nothing was really wrong with it either."}
{"text":"I was parked in the second spot from the street in front of a large Clever Koi sign two spots down from the George and dragon parking sign and apparently someone from Geoarge and Dragon called and had my car towed to 7th ave and happy valley road!!! George and Dragon sucks.  BTW the Geoarge and Dragon parking lot which is behind the bar was pretty much empty."}
{"text":"Great place! My favorite in Phoenix! Great vibe, friendly staff, friendly patrons, darts, pool, good tap selection, good prices, and lots of space. It's a nice neighborhood bar. Cheers! :)"}
{"text":"If you want GREAT food and service, please try the George and Dragon.  I've been coming here for ten years, and absolutely love it.  The owner is very accommodating to our huge soccer after-parties!  The wait-staff is fun and friendly.  There is a wide array of beer selection available.    This pub hosts a great World Cup party! Keep up the great work!!"}
{"text":"G&D is one of those places that I just \"end up\" at.. its centralized between me and all my friends, and they have everything you could ever need .. so its wicked convenient. Trivia, Karaoke, TV's, Beer, Wings, Scotch Eggs, Pool tables, cigarette machines, children running around screaming.. you name it, they probably have it.   The first time I came here was for trivia night.. it was dramatic and everyone was cheating, but the loaded potato app. made everything all right in my world.  The second time I came here was after the Switch OYE, which I totally don't remember.. as Brad E.'s review noted, there was a game that involved me falling asleep sitting up and everyone screaming my name as loudly as possible to interrupt my slumber, or something.... There was also war paint and apparently I ran into some co-workers.. I didn't believe them until a photo surfaced. I will say no more.  The third time I came here was for Georgie S.' 8th 26th birthday celebration. We actually came here twice, once for after brunch boozing, and the second time to sing Karaoke, but mostly we just listened to Nathan S. serenade us for 3 hours.. football was on, many beers were consumed, the photos reflected a happy setting and im pretty sure the bday girl was pleased with her final celebration. At least, it was supposed to be the final. I'm pretty sure it wasn't.   The 5th time I came here was last night.. for football and beers. As always, I was content and happy, enjoying myself and the wedding reception debauchery (yes there was really a wedding reception here) that was going on..  I just generally enjoy this place, there is always parking, its right off the rail, the bathrooms are gross, but manageable, food is actually really good for bar-fare, especially the English selections.. Great beer selection, KILTLIFTER WHAAAAT, full bar, always an interesting crowd and everyone is always having a great time.   Totally come here. Me and my friends will probably be there too."}
{"text":"I received a very nice email from the manager addressing our unsatisfactory experience.  I always appreciate when managers/owners care enough to reach out to an unhappy customer.  I will definitely give G&D another shot."}
{"text":"Had the Cornish Pastie and the Toffee Pudding here. The Cornish Pastie was great and came with a side of corns and mashed potatoes. Although the dough was flavorful and cooked well, the inside filling seemed a little cold. The Toffee Pudding however I can not say enough about - it was absolutely incredible! It was a toffee cake surrounded by a moat of toffee sauce. Very delectable! The prices were decent, and service was attentive. There's also ample of parking in the back which in downtown Phoenix is excellent!"}
{"text":"I was completely bummed out when I went to George and Dragon today to have a drink with my boyfriend... and left without being served. We walked in, went directly to the bar and stood there to wait for the bartender to take our order. Two staff members saw us standing at the bar, and neither person acknowledged we were even there. It would have been a totally different experience had someone at least greeted us and let us know it would just be a minute. Unfortunately, that didn't happen and we ended up leaving. I realize it may have been an isolated incident, but I am pretty sure I won't be going back; there are plenty of other places to get a drink in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times and generally enjoy it. The parking is not the best and it's a dark lit area. They have decent beer selection, the food is hit or miss. I have had the fish & chips 2 times and it was good but the coleslaw that came with it was horrible. The other times I had just a pub burger and it was nothing special. I've been able to catch a few of the bagpipe acts here and it's cool to see. They have darts and a pool table. Overall it's a cool place to come have a drink."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I love George and dragon! We live down the street and ride our bikes there a lot. The owner is very friendly and the bartender is excellent! Try the honey siracha wings they are to die for."}
{"text":"Good drinks and food for a English sports pub in Phoenix. I watch most soccer matches here. Lots of local fans-- good vibes and good people. If you're looking for an authentic \"British Pub\" like experience this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Most authentic British Pug you can get in the Valley. Been going here for years and love it!"}
{"text":"Great place for traditional English Pub Food. They put on lots of fun events to celebrate various British holidays, friendly atmosphere. Always feel welcome!"}
{"text":"A great place to hang out and chill with peeps after work. The fish and chips is kinda pricey but the restaurant gave great portion of the fries and I was able to share with friends. G&D had a great selection of beer and my fave is the Kilt Lifter. Love it!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give no stars on this one. This was my first time at this place so I didn't have the pleasure of seeing it when it was a shit hole. But honestly, it still is. I don't even know where to start with this bad experience. We had 8 of us in our group. After about 15 mins we were finally waited on. The waitress started out to be great but I could tell she was getting flustered. I don't know if it was us or that she had too many tables or what but she was super slow with a bad attitude. Got our drinks to us fine. We ordered food. The fish and chips, some sausage dish, and the Scottish egg. Our food didn't arrive for 45 mins. I don't know about you but it does not take 45 mins for fish and chips. The best part about it was when she brought out our food, she informed us that they were out of Scottish eggs. We declined to getting something else because I was not waiting another 45 mins to eat. And overall the food sucked.   Now it's time to leave. She doesn't get our checks to us for about 20 mins. She asks what is on what check so we told her. She still got it wrong. She put an extra beer on my check and I told her this and she just stared at me and said \"oh, I guess you're paying for his beer.\" And shows no effort to take it off of my bill. She was just getting everything wrong. So she brings back our checks and everyone has there card except for my one friend. She somehow has lost his card. She scrummages around in her pockets and then precedes to look at other tables checks like someone would leave a credit card in their check. Well we finally found it. Thank goodness.   Honestly, for just being on bar rescue and \"remodeled\" this place needs some more work. Nothing against Jon Taffer. I'm sure he tried his best and this bar just went back to the way things were before he got there    So overall, my experience here was a nightmare. You will never catch me in that place again."}
{"text":"I'm horrified by the way I got treated this morning. I was told to go in when they open, ask for water( just tap water nothing else.) It was cleared by one of the owners. They said they would fill up our two little water containers for a community event that I was working for.  It was a happy day the two of us from the event went in as happy as can be. When we got in my parter said \"hello\" we got ignored by one bar tender and one waitress. So we waited until they where ready to notice. Then the bar tender said just take a seat we will be with you. That's when we explain our purpose for the visit. The said no we don't know what your talking about. They rolled there eyes at us and just said we don't know anything. I said, you can't give us water from the tap. The bar tender shook her head no and just turned away. They treated us so bad I would never ever go there to eat. That's not how to work with the community. Plus the place was a mess and they had just open. The two workers were so busy working on nothing, to even help us they should be fired. I do believe I was treated this way because of black skin. Shame on you racist workers for treating us like that. Just so you know I am British, born in London but you are to ignorant to notice that different races of people come out of England."}
{"text":"A delightful Phoenix diver bar that is even more accessible now with the opening of what this pub's owner described as the \"bloody\" light rail.  The boisterous setting is made even more fun when the British owner announces drink specials and makes off-color jokes from his microphone. While I have not sampled most items from the menu, I have always found the wings at the George and Dragon to be a good choice.  This pub is a great place to hang out with old friends or make new ones."}
{"text":"G&D is my local bar.  Full disclosure - the owner is my friend, but that's a natural byproduct of how this place is run.  I know many of the people that I toss 'em back with a few nights a week here, and the clientele cuts a wide swath - doctors, lawyers, and Indian chiefs, if you will, to regular folks like me.  A lot of the knocks on the place I won't disavow - it's dim and not sparkling, but so what?  If that's a huge turn-off, you're better off elsewhere.  I like to think the place has personality.  But if you like a huge selection of beer (including Boddington's, Kronenbourg, and Chimay) and good food, you'll probably have a good time here.  The food's not frou-frou and \"foodie\" - it's just good.  My favorite bar in Phoenix - no place I'd rather get pissed."}
{"text":"Awesome bar.   I really like the English Dip but I add this mix of sour cream and horseradish making it creamy horseradish. It adds the perfect sauce to an already delicious sandwich. The pub makes a ton of stuff in house. All of the sandwich, burger and rolls are made there."}
{"text":"I have been coming to George & Dragon for years now.  Ever since they remodeled the bar is fun to come to and hangout.  Everyone that works that is really sweet and nice.  The prices is always right and they are open everyday until 2am.   Even the food there is really good for being a dive bar.  The reason beyond coming for years is because the bartenders actually care about you and hangout for a couple of minutes before they go to the next person that wants a drink.  Well, also they are close to my house."}
{"text":"I used to like this place as my hang out on Friday nights. I used to be friends with the bar staff and owners.    I am Indian from India with a nice beard. Some one offered me drinks and skipped on their tab and the bar wanted me to pay for the other persons tab even after my tab was already taken car of.   I refused because it was not my drinks. I offered to pay for my share. But the owners brother, who I thought I was friends with showed his true colors and  told me I was not welcome at the bar anymore.   George and Dragon used to be my favorite go to spot to hang out for drinks, but after the type of insult and racism I experienced, I do not think that it is a place I should go to anymore.   Maybe all us ethic people should visit this british pub to make it feel authentic like it is in England with a lot of ethnic people."}
{"text":"It's A really nice English pub. Makes me feel like I'm back in the UK. Clean. Plenty of space. Friendly staff. Restrooms clean. Good food. Great beer. Felt real welcome. Lots of parking. User friendly."}
{"text":"Had seven hungry guys there after a hard day on the job. Ordered drinks, appetizers and entrees. I will say the service was a little slow and smoky but vibrant.  The owner stopped by and said hi. Actually he said 'ello. When he found out that this was our first time he took a few more minutes to get to know each one of us better - was a class act and very friendly.  I did not see the Halo Burger listed on the reviewed. It was a nice sized one third pound hamburger with a large pan fried cheese garnish so the presentation was very excellent and the burger itself is a little greasy. The bill for seven of us was $200 including tip.  My test for the quality or likability of a restaurant has to do with would I return to the place and I have to say that this is one place I probably would return to solely with a large group of people who just want to hang have a little fun relax enjoy the atmosphere. You'll notice and some of the other reviews Thursday night is trivia night and the owner went through about 30 reasonably tough questions of succeeding difficulty. It's just kind of fun in the background with conversation and play while the rest of the crowd disappears in the background."}
{"text":"Being born in the UK to a long line of English, Welsh, Irish and Scots, so there's nothing more I'd like than for a good Brit pub to thrive in PHX.  That said, this place has the bones and makes an attempt, but falls short.   It's kinda divey, but that's fine.  The beer selection is great.  The crowd is diverse.  Good music, lots of sports on the TV, etc.  On the flip side:  The staff has good intentions, but is not well trained.  They do the job, but don't anticipate - you have to ask.  They don't seem empowered.  We ordered some happy hour food at 6:55, for example, and they said it was over.  It wasn't 7, but they explained the \"computers\" made the call.  This wasn't something we brought up at 10 p.m. - but before it was 7!   A guy next to us ordered food to go and sat there for 40 minutes.  He kept asking and the response was \"it wasn't up\" but then he got mad and it magically appeared all boxed and ready.  Bottom line:  service is o.k. for a bar, but the food thing seems to flummox them.  The menu covers a wide range of bases, but also is a series of hits and misses.  We went one weekend for the Sunday Roast.  It was a generous plate of veggies, mash and a massive yorkshire pud.  But the beef wasn't roast anything... more like steak-ums.  The gravy was from a can/jar.   Now some might say this is trivial, but a good Sunday Roast Beef meal to the English is like a Thanksgiving dinner in the US.  You can't serve shaved turkey from a frozen bag and surround it with good sides... the main dish needs to be lovingly prepared.  On another night, the Scotch eggs followed the same theme.  A great idea.  The dish was served with a wide range of extras, but the core food was odd.  Not bad, but the casing was an inch thick and dry.  I'd love to see this place work.  They offer a menu of what should be made, but just don't quite deliver a good food product.  To be fair, the market might not support it and are happy with ho hum stuff, but on the flip side I've enjoyed much more inspired fare in CA - not just the U.K."}
{"text":"The food is okay, the trivia is fun but they don't even know what  crown float is.  This is an English pub you say?  Pshaw."}
{"text":"Came here with a California ID that was vertical and was refused service because Arizona law says it must be changed to a horizontal ID within 30 days of your 21st birthday. It is not California law that you need a new ID, and therefore should be valid in Arizona. Arizona law does not have an affect on a California ID."}
{"text":"This is a very differant place. It has been here for about 20 years, maybe more.  They have a good menu for food. A bit high priced, but very authentic.  So my girlfriend says and she grew up on British food. Their fish and chips are really good, Chicken Pie and a good drink selection as well. Lots of parkiing in the lot. Big dining area and lots going on like pool, darts, and other games on different nights. Nice patio, but smoking is allowed there. good for smokers ,not good for me. Their is a strange smell inside, that i can't quite place, not bad just strange.   I like it though. Food is good!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great ambience, friendly staff, and great food and beer. This was a phenomenal first experience, an I will be back."}
{"text":"Okay... the bad reviewers must have gone to another bar or something. If you are looking for table clothes or elegant atmosphere, why go to a bar? I have had great luck here. This place is everything that I would expect an English pub to be. They have many beers (an amazing amount) and when I went there, I had a waitress remember me and my drink order from about 3 weeks prior. Make no mistake, this is a PUB! It is not fine dining! It is a local bar where you can let your hair down and relax! The atmosphere is great and the girls are pretty, both customers and wait staff! The food is great pub food! What more could anyone want from a bar? I haven't been disappointed yet, and I have been going there for at least 2 years. It isn't perfect... it's a bar. I'm looking to sit with my friends, have great conversation, drink a beer, eat good food, and look at girls. Isn't that what a bar is for? If that is what you are interested in, George and Dragon is the perfect place!"}
{"text":"There has been so much anticipation to go to G&D for Karaokee on mondays.  After a great bbq we all decided to go and sing our hearts out...well we arrived at about 10pm...added our names to the list...cheered othered singers on to encourage a good time, spent some money and tipped well....and waited patiently....well after 2.5 hours have gone by we had seen the same three girls go up the several times before we have...we get it...if they got there before us and signed up, its their turn...but then the host started singing songs and kept picking \"random\" chicks to sings songs...ok...now its getting weird.  Then when we saw the person that signed up right before us go up and then one of the same \"three\" girls and then the host \"randomly\" pick again.....we got pissed of and were ready to leave.  We were pissed and cashed out.  Then when we told the karaokee host that he was an ass and that we had been waiting over 2 hrs and were pissed, he pretty much talked crap and walked away.  Then he had the nerve to call our names when we walked right out of the door.  We came back in and talked to management.  We were there to have a good time and spend money.  I would rather spend my money elsewhere.  Star karaokee sux, IDK what the hell Michael the Karaokee host from star karaokee's problem was, but he was completely unprofessional and just plain RUDE.  We get it, you have your regulars, but we are cusotmers too.....we would have brought more people back in the future...but you can have fun with the same three people for your pitiful karaokee night."}
{"text":"Basically a no frills pub.  It's been here forever and they're unapologetically unpretentious.  If you're looking for fine dining or exquisite presentation you're in the wrong place.  But if you want some decent pub grub, a pool table, or a great place to watch some soccer, then this is a good spot.  Location is right on the light rail line on Central Ave.  During happy hour you'll see everything from corporate suits to motorcyclists to neighborhood locals.  And yes, the fish and chips are on point."}
{"text":"Love love love this place. Everything I've ever had on the menu has been great. Even the club sandwich!"}
{"text":"Not impressed for the hype and not sure I will ever go out of my way to visit here again."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite neighborhood bar, and mostly because it's just a hop skip and a jump from my front door - or a scoot on my bad*ss kick scooter. (like a razor scooter, but more awesome)  Lock that puppy up (again, bad*ss scooter reference here) on their bike rack, hop in with your pals for a late night clandestine meeting of the minds - at least that's what it'll seem like after a few of those $3.75 well drinks on a Friday at 9 or 10 pm, when in reality, it was just two or more buffoons boozing around making fools of themselves.  I'd say that I'm more a fan of neighborhood type bars than dance clubs, mostly because they tend to be lighter on the wallet than the latter. Call it a dive if you must, but I wouldn't classify George like that. Sure there's the obligatory pool tables and darts that make up a good dive. On any given evening, you might run into someone toting along their children for the 'grille' part of this bar and grille, but really, it's certainly more bar than grille by hefty proportions. I can't recall how many nights have ended at George, but you can rest assured that there will definitely be more.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, come meet George, he's kind of awesome."}
{"text":"Authentic British pub with excellent food and atmosphere. I would recommend anyone visit here for an authentic experience and excellent meal. Thank you for the hospitality!"}
{"text":"Nice environment. Waitress was awesome. Food was delicious. Had their zucchini sticks. Fish and chips, Cornish Pastie, and Sheppards pie were all amazing too"}
{"text":"Moved over here from England and this is her truest taste of home. It is not an American English bar it is a true English pub.   Loved it and the owner was great.  Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Loves it!  Nothing like the eery feeling that you might get raped in the parking lot to make a girl come back for more..... and that is precisely what I do.   Its super close to home for one thing...walkable.  The food is actually pretty phenom. for \"bar food\" . Oddly they serve a chicken satay in some sort of peanut saucy fabulousness that is pretty damn amazing. The pool tables suck, but hey, I suck at pool, we're even. Where else can you get hammered for 20.00 while wearing pajama bottoms and not feel the least bit out of place.  If you can get past the creepers that haven't been laid in centuries and the distinct feeling that one or more of the waitstaff has probably been smoking meth all day I suggest you check it out. Just make sure you bring an escort ladies."}
{"text":"I went here on the purchase of a Groupon. It was very interesting, I love pubs and this is the type of \"Cheers\" atmosphere that I could get accustomed too. Casey was our waitress and she was great, food was very good and prices not bad. We will definitely try it again, the only thing that prevents us from being regulars is the distance from our home. The Halo Burger is a MUST!"}
{"text":"Great for groups. The bloody Marie's are amazing! The atmosphere is great. It's a loud place but that's what I expect from a pub! So will come back!."}
{"text":"English Pub theme aside, this is one great all-around bar / restaurant.  After 6 or 7 visits, no element of this place has disappointed me.  George and Dragon \"feels\" like it could've been one of the first pubs in Phoenix, yet I don't know how long its been around... my point is it feels great.  The service is always friendly and prompt, the crowd is always diverse, and the frequent weekend live music is a big plus.  I've felt sort of a rockabilly theme more often than not, but I have yet to make it there on a Wednesday, so I can't speak to anything but the weekend crowd.  I also heard its a good place to get some work done in the afternoon, as they offer wi-fi, too!  Cool, eh?  Pool and darts live here, too, as noted in previous reviews.  Want a great place to catch up with some out-of-town friends without being annoyed?  Go to George & Dragon!  Great vibe, great bar."}
{"text":"I had a restaurant.com coupon so I got to try a bunch of stuff (but I guess they don't take these anymore, our waitress had to check with the manager to let us use ours).    Seems like a happening, dive-bar type environment.  They were finishing up a poker tournament which it seems like there's one like every day.  Not sure why they left all the tvs on a channel with a cleft-palate infomercial for a charity pretty much all night, it was kind of a downer...  The pasties were phenominal.  A definitely must-try, and will get every time I go there.  The wings were so-so, we ordered medium which were pretty hot, but there wasn't much to the sauce but Red-hot it seemed.  The fish and chips were good, which some places mess up with the batter being undercooked but they seemed to do a pretty good job.  The shepherd's pie was ok, though isn't it supposed to have a crust at the bottom?  Wasn't sure.  All-in-all, a good place to start off a night or hang out for a game.  Would not go for more than a happy hr type venture."}
{"text":"Always fun to hit up the George & Dragon Pub when visiting Phoenix.  The food wont blow you away, its standard pub fair, but the atmosphere is great.  Plenty of TV's to cover any game thats on, whether that be British Football or any American Sports.  Darts, Pool Table, and when they have Karaoke, seems like a few pros show up and put on quite a show.  If you are looking for a bar atmosphere that is a lot of fun, this place is worth a visit."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out for years, and finally got to hit them up on a Saturday night.  Overall I was quite happy, decent beer selection, and the table arrangement worked well with our medium sized group.  The bar staff was busy, but friendly. Sadly, they were out of a couple of the beers I really wanted to try.  The patio area is nice, with plenty of room and tables.  The single toilet for the ladies was a bit of a drag.  Overall there was a great atmosphere.  Didn't try the food, but would go back to check that out.  Best part is that they are so close to the lightrail, because I'd never drive that far to have a drink or 3."}
{"text":"Came in for a few beers to see if they would some playoff hockey - there was no important soccer... So they obliged and put the game on a TV - they also had the NBA and pitiful Diamondbacks - we asked for some sound or at least sound for the for only one TV - preferably the Hockey game since no cared about the D-Backs game.... Unfortunately, Shelby and Rocky were not empowered to use the remotes to higher/lower the volume... so after a few discussions with a \"manager\" - still no success and no common sense -  The paint looks good - but the rest of Bar Rescue has clearly didn't stick-  You can perfume the pig but its still a pig....  Derek M. \"Blues Fan\""}
{"text":"Ole Ole Ole Ole!!! 6 am pints and footy.  It doesn't get much better than that.  Cheers Until then, get the beers in..."}
{"text":"Had an amazing time here on New Years. Excellent service! The pretzels were enjoyed by all since they were definitely big enough to share. All of the other food was super delicious as well."}
{"text":"Good food. Staff is really nice. Erica she was a little snotty but over all a good place to be. Good vibes for the most part. They have karaoke and pool too. Cool place."}
{"text":"The food is bland which I guess is to be expected since it is English.  However, it was substance and not exspensive."}
{"text":"I don't know if this is as good as it gets because I have never been to England, but I really like the food.   I took my Dad here for Father's Day lunch and really enjoyed our meal.  The iced tea was fresh and my cornish pastie was really delicious.  I wish I had one now.  My Dad's steak and mushroom pie looked really good too.  Also, the prices were decent."}
{"text":"Came on a Thursday night from out of town, which had awesome food! Awesome service! They also had trivia night, which was a blast! Will come back again!"}
{"text":"We hadn't been to the George & Dragon in years, so decided to stop in for a pint this weekend.  Decent atmosphere, plenty of football on the TV's, friendly bartenders and a great selection of beer and cider.  I definitely recommend the pub pretzel with mustard and cheese...so tasty!"}
{"text":"a great laid back bar with tons of comfy booths, carlsberg on tap,  plenty of english football and memrobilia, and a lot of good people.   as others have said, the place has an edge to it pretty much just because of its location in the art district. its one of the great laidback bars for the hipster/punk crowd next to shady's and the paper heart. its a great place to go before/after first friday or roller derby. and just a great place to hang out or warm up before going elsewhere.  the one star off is for the food there which is pretty lackluster. its a little on the expensive side and comes in small portions and pretty mediocre quality. definitely not the best fish and chips you will ever have.   i would stick to the great beer selection which yes, includes carlsberg on draft. i haven't found another place in arizona which even sells carlsberg in bottles, but then there aren't many english pubs in arizona.  the no EPL ticket is pretty lame though, they really need to shell out the dough for that."}
{"text":"Well, tied and last try with this establishment. I understand \"Bar Rescue\" did a show here. Sad thing is the service is worse than before.   Ordered a Balvenie 12 year old with a splash of water. Waitress brought out a drink with water and ice. When I mentioned it wasn't what I ordered, she looked at me in disbelief. She really though Scotch comes on the rocks by default.  Really doesn't matter. I'm not coming back. damn shame."}
{"text":"If I could give less I would. Cool spot unless you're a woman getting harassed by male patrons. The \"security\" won't do anything except pat them on the back and bro up. Not a place for woman to feel safe, and what kind of place is that?"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, and friendly and helpful staff. Delicious pies, like all items from the menu. It is also a good choice when it comes to drinks. I recommend."}
{"text":"I enjoyed eating here! I tried this place about a year ago, and never came back because of the horrible food and service. I had the fish and chips, as well as some beer. I thought it was delicious compared to last time I was here! My friend enjoyed their food as well. I can't say anything about the mixed drinks because we didn't have any. But very good service and food! I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place is a really cool space and has such a great vibe to it.  This would be a cool place to come and chill with friend and drink beer and watch sports.  I would have to say that this review is probably more of a 3.5 stars.  I am not overly crazy about the food.  But hey, what do you expect from bar food and English cuisine.  I know my bf, who is from across the pond, loves the food as it takes him back to his memories of England.  The service is good and the people are always friendly!  The Blackberry and Apple crumble is the best!  Be sure to save room for that dessert!"}
{"text":"The fish and chips tasted very good. The problem was that the bar was on the grimey side and the food was not fresh. The corn that came as a side was definitely not fresh I would be willing to wager was frozen. The staff was polite but hard at work trying to obtain good tips from regulars and everyone else was 2nd class. I would return, but they have some shaping up to do. STOP using frozen food."}
{"text":"I ordered a Cornish pasty on Wednesday December 2, 2015.  It was served with a piece of hard plastic rivet or grommet inside. I discovered this piece of hard plastic by bitting into it. The staff was not helpful and in fact turned out to be extremely rude. She did not bring a manager. She made no  effort to correct this gross service. Obviously these food items come some factory some where. This is a dangerous and unhelpful bar and grill in my experience.  Having just traveled in Great Britain I find this establishment an insult to Queen and Country. The men's restroom had a broken urinal, graffiti on the walls, and urine on the floor. I loved the pictures of the Royals on the walls, but I am sure they are ashamed of the conditions of this establishment."}
{"text":"Cool English place on Central Ave downtown. Once you walk into the bar, there is English memorabilia all over the joint, it almost feels like you are in an English Pub. Great brews on tap as well. Thursday nights are trivia night, which are a fun time. I ordered an English kebab which was seasoned and tasty (English version of a gyro). My friend had ordered the Cornish Pastie and couldn't stop raving about it. Overall, we had a good experience and would definitely come again."}
{"text":"G&D is an authentic, dark British pub with friendly staff and cold drinks. I like the dart boards and pool tables. The patio looking onto Central would be cool if it wasn't always filled with smokers. Don't bother dressing up or expecting to see pretty people here. You go to drink! G&D was my best guess for a friend who wanted to watch early-morning Chelsea games as he does at pubs in San Diego, but I don't believe they open early for that."}
{"text":"First timer here, on a Saturday night, mini high school reunion. Been here for over 20 years, apparently we came after the Bar Rescue remodel. Cool little place, good beer selection and a heavy pour on the shots. We only had a couple appetizers for food and they were ok.  I have nothing bad to say, except for the small tiny bathrooms that has one urinal and one toilet with no door and a 2 foot partial wall. Hope you don't have to poop. George and Dragon gets a solid C from me."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere!  Drinks and service were great.   It feels like the perfect local bar and I got the impression that international travelers are drawn here too- great place to be!!   Soccer galore!  Darts and pool too."}
{"text":"Fantastic place, the owner is great and is super laid back. Fish and chips were awesome, great service and fun games. The nice part is it isn't loud and annoying! It's quiet and allows for you to enjoy your time here!"}
{"text":"This place ROCKS!   Just flew in from Denver, CO.  Worst flight of my life.  I was in a horrible mood.  I went to the George & Dragon for a late (LATE) dinner and had the most fabulous Pub Burger of my life.  The food was incredible, the wait staff was warm, funny, and just delightful, and the ambiance was out of this world.   I left the George & Dragon in a great mood!!!   Everyone in the restaurant was laughing and having a great time.   Most important, they had HOCKEY on the tv!  I would not only highly recommend the George & Dragon, but I will most definitely be back myself.  You have a customer for life!!"}
{"text":"Service was awesome! Katie was our server and Ronnie was the manager (both amazing!) me and my fiancé came to try the fish and chips...... A+ amazing fish and chips, service and atmosphere were also great! Good food, good people! Thanks Katie and Ronnie!"}
{"text":"Went in after Bar Rescue. I thought the changes were great! In the past the service wasn't very good and on our trip the servers were really attentive and very knowledgeable. I had always thought that the food was okay for bar food, but really loved the new streamlined menu and tried their fish fry. The servings were enormous and a great deal. My husband had the pasty which was the same as before. Overall a great neighborhood pub."}
{"text":"A cool place to sit and have a few drinks and chat with friends, it's not too loud to have a conversation. The beer selection is good and the drinks are strong so I felt I got my money's worth if your into pubs it's a good place."}
{"text":"Nice relaxing place, good staff, and great drinks. Had mozzarella sticks for happy hour and it was very disappointing. Besides that most things are good."}
{"text":"Good Food! PLEASE get some new Tv's Not a good place for NFL Sundays!"}
{"text":"If I could give a zero, I would. The manager (older white man with a bread) was EXTREMELY RUDE!!!! I understand not agreeing with a  customer, but he was flat out obnoxious! Didn't want to hear a word I was saying even though I ended up being right! I hope you're they guy that's reading this :) he tells me he can \"announce\" to the whole bar that \"I've lost my item.\" Well won't you know that HIS EMPLOYEE walks out with the EXACT bag I'm looking for! He was a blessing btw, and knew exactly my situation. Guess the bartenders should have asked more than just my server before asking the manager?! You guys are a joke and should have communicated better. I would expect nothing less than an apology from the a$$hole who said he didn't know all the \"unregular drunks\" he's used to on a Saturday. I'll continue to not recommend and protest, if required, this establishment! I wish you nothing but the worst, sorry!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once & so far I'm indifferent. If I never come back I'll really only miss the coleslaw. The coleslaw got this place 3 stars instead of 2.  A friend asked me to go on a Mon which is karaoke night. I don't inflict my terrible singing on others, but I did enjoy most of the other people singing.  I played a couple games of pool on 1 of the 2 tables while waiting for my food.  The main bartender was not a pleasant person. Words like \"sweetie\" don't disguise impatient, judgmental body language. I can't remember seeing her smile once. She made me uncomfortable. The other girls working there were smiley & nice looking. I also saw the general manager chilling outside.  Call me a cheap ass but I feel like I paid too much for fish & chips. Came out to $14.02. I expected to pay $10ish. I know it's market price & all but that still sucked. I should have asked the price before ordering.  The fish & chips were really good though. I could barely finish the 2 thick pieces of fish on my plate. They were perfectly crispy with just the right amount of batter. Chips could have been crispier though.  I LOVE THE COLESLAW! I can't say that enough. It wasn't sweet (yuck!) like other coleslaws I've tried. It was crisp & peppery. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Hmmm  When you order a shot I think you get more liqueur than just a shot because of their glasses. They're wide & the bartender wasn't measuring, she just eye balled it. Don't pay more ordering doubles since you're probably pretty much already getting that originally.  There are heaters above on the patio. Your top 1/2 will be warm while your bottom 1/2 might get cold.  There's 1 bathroom for girls. No stalls. If someone's in there you'll have to wait your turn. At least it wasn't filthy & smelly."}
{"text":"I met my old - and I do mean old - English high school professor there, so I'm giving this place three stars. Everything I ordered was greasy, I never realized that fish and chips could be so greasy. I needed Tums to help my heartburn. Maybe order something less fried if you choose this spot? Can't say much else, the atmosphere was OK, a lot of happy, semi-drunk people at 3pm, makes me wonder where the designated drivers were hiding. Maybe everyone was bicycling, who knows?"}
{"text":"If you want to chow on bangers & mash whilst sipping Guiness, Harp, or Newcastle (i.e. *real* beers), whilst watching (real) football on the tele, this is the place you might enjoy.   Come whenever, bring whoever, do stuff, and enjoy the drinks, pool, bar games, darts, poker, etc.  Good times will be had by all.  Or you'll just get a bunch of cheap beer, which isn't so bad either."}
{"text":"The service is absolutely top notch! Couldn't ask for friendlier service!  Overall, whole place smelled like vomit. Fresh, chunky, gastronomic spew. Fish is over battered, fries are limp and soggy.  Jana is the saving grace. Bless her for staying the course. \"Two consonants, two vowels, one woman\". She's a gem."}
{"text":"DH & I went for dinner there tonight, we had a veggie pasty and the crust was nice & flaky but the stuffing of the pasty was tasteless, peas were tasteless, mashed potatoes & gravy, weren't very good either. Beer selection was good, but food was terrible."}
{"text":"Went for a Trivia Night. 40 questions that take clise to two hours to finish. I had a fun night with my people. Didn't get to try anything other than fries, but I'm not going to rate this place based on reheated fries. Nice ambience that reminded me of the British pub.."}
{"text":"excellent English pub fare.  The service great, shepherd pie outstanding. Would go again and again"}
{"text":"I love George and Dragon! My number one choice for fish and chips! There's always extra to take home and eat later. The vibes there are awesome, the drinks are tasty, and the food (especially all the appetizers) are to die for! My only complaint is that the last time I was there, they were out of the jumbo pretzels because they're just so good!"}
{"text":"I've loved your for years through bad food and good food (food is amazing now, btw). Please please please please bring back the booths. I cannot stand sitting in the high chairs,  I don't care what the TV show did to you. Everyone I know hates the fact that the booths are gone.  That is 30% of the reason I come there."}
{"text":"Sometimes I am a little embarrassed to admit it, but I love the George & Dragon. The service can be a little slow, and the servers a little spacey, but the owner is super friendly and the bar's vibe is \"the more the merrier\". The bar has some entertaining activities, like poker and trivia nights, and fantastic wings (spicy and tart). Plus the kitchen is open late.  This is a great place to spend the evening throwing back beers with good friends!"}
{"text":"This is a fine English pub! The shepherd's pie is delicious and the bangers and mash are spot on! I recommend them highly! The only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because the music can be much too loud. The atmosphere is great and the employees  are fantastic!"}
{"text":"So many reviews so I'll keep it short. I really enjoyed this place I would soooo go here often if I lived closer, like probably daily. Guiness, good food selection and Spotted Dick!! K?? K!!"}
{"text":"UK pub atmosphere in Phoenix  I have never been to a pub in the UK.  Howerver, I have a image in my mind of what a pub in the UK might look like and George and Dragon made that image a reality.  George and Dragon is unpolished, and unpretentious.  The atmosphere is very relaxing and welcoming.  As I  sat muling over the menu I enjoyed listening to the random music being played.  In the short time I was at George and Dragon I  listened to  metal, George Michael, Aretha Franklin, classical and everything in between.   The customer service at George and Dragon in amazing.  The servers  were very accommodating without being intrusive. Our server took the time to explain the menu and even offered suggestions based on our preferences.  Moving onto the food.  The food at George and Dragon is great and served piping hot (which I truly enjoy).  The unique combinations of flavors were prepared and presented perfectly.  My lunch party and I tried Bangers & Mash, Roasted Vegetable Pastie, fish& chip, Shepherd Pie, and Meatloaf. All of the entrées were delicious.   Even though we were full from lunch because at George and Dragon the servings are large. We had to try dessert. So we ordered blackberry crumble and  bread pudding.  I have to say the bread pudding  was the best I have ever had.  We will definitely be making this place a regular stop."}
{"text":"Imagine a legitimate British pub of some kind.  You know the sort.  Football fans, bangers and mash, buckets of gin and beer.  Now imagine that same place full of beady-eyed punk rock kids wearing t-shirts with the names of bands on them that have been history longer than they've been alive.  Add a pool table, and a sense of the threat of random violence, and you have this place.  Three stars only because it's so hard to find a decent beer in Phoenix and these guys aren't bad in that department."}
{"text":"We've been going to G&D for a while now and always enjoy a low key time whether it be for happy hour and darts on a day off or a late night dinner after work. Staff is always great and the food is too. Last night I had the stuffed meat loaf and was blown away! I also really enjoy the wings! They were on Bar Rescue recently and honestly, I loved the bar before, and I still love it. Its the same great place, just spruced up a bit."}
{"text":"Belly up to the bar and grab a beer on tap.  Or grab a cozy table in the corner.  This English pub has friendly, welcoming staff.  Recommendations: Try the Fish & Chips, and pair it with the Union Jack IPA.  So good!"}
{"text":"I really hate to give this place a less than stellar review because I want to like it so badly! The location is great, far enough out of downtown to avoid the clutter and close enough to have train access and feel like you're in a more urban area. Big family style benches allow for friend-making outside and individual tables inside. I'm surprised I came back after the first time. On a busier night, we couldn't get service to save our lives. We made sure we weren't stepping on toes by seating ourselves and sat, staring at servers running AROUND us for 15 minutes before going to the bar and begrudgingly ordering a beer from there instead. We sat and tried to shake it off while drinking one of many draft choices and waited, trying to make any contact with a server so we could get a menu or so I could merely ask where the bathroom was at-but nothing. I even timed how long it would take to get any attention without waving my arms around and after 10 more minutes we gave up. Apparently we were also given up on because the only interaction we had was the server rudely ripping our drink menu off the table without a word! That being the last straw, our feelings a little hurt, and trying to dial down why we felt like we were refused service, we left half full beers and walked out upset. I still over analyze the situation and try and figure out what in the hell we did wrong!  Now, we came back to meet with friends almost a year later and service was slightly more decent. For mediocre bar food and bare minimum service that I usually have to flag down or jump straight to the bar for. I don't see all the hype in my own personal experience and that totally bums me out given that I like the atmosphere and location so much and so do many of my friends/coworkers. We still go here out of convenience and a quick beer occasionally but I can't seem to get the bad taste out if my mouth. Bummersville."}
{"text":"Would have given it zero stars. The waitress was awful. Completely forgot about us, we had to go to the bar to get refills on our drinks! To add insult to the visit, I got food poisoning! I wouldn't recommend this place at all....."}
{"text":"We came here for the first time. Came with the kids and another family. The kids had the French toast sticks and they were really good (our kids are picky eaters)."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to this pub in several years but spotted it on my first Valley Metro Rail ride.  I went straight for the Fish & Chips with a salad substitute for the chips as I have been doing lately to be more \"health conscious\".  The large \"fried \"cod was very good but the salad was ordinary head lettuce with a pink hydroponic tomato half and lone onion ring.    Otherwise, the pub experience with the assorted English, Scottish and Irish flags plus noisy crowd was reminiscent of pubs I had seen in London and Ireland.  If I hadn't been riding the rail several more years could have gone by before re-visiting so the rail should help some of the restaurants over time."}
{"text":"Located in the holy bermuda triangle of awesomeness and light rail construction of central Phoenix, I had to try this place out. Wednesdays apparently they host a mod/soul dance night. Since I had to be around the Indian School 'hood anyway, I figured-this is the time. Well, this must be one hell of a popular night to go-I had trouble finding parking in their huge lot! Only when I saw a group of young male hipsters go to their car around 11:30 did I score a spot...the farthest spot away from the pub!  I entered the side door, I was greeted by pool tables and went straight to the bar. Lots of random guys at the bar and fabulously mod, blackhaired ladies smoking were gathered around but managed to get a stool and just got an Amstel light on the tip their other beers were price-y. I looked around, seeing the DJ spinning some James Brown with an old American Bandstand playing on the TV above him. Some ladies in A-line dresses and guys were R&Bing their way while holding lit cigarettes. A small dance floor for maybe 20 people, the rest were holding court at large booths, round tables and standing around in the back-pretty much a full house. I also spotted near the pool tables DARTS. And while they have the shitty electronic ones, I did spot an AUTHENTIC old-skool one wedged inbetween-I def. have to bring my dart set next time!  The crowd was friendly and guys from other dance nights I attend were there and we struck up an easy-going conversation-hard to hear sometimes since right next to the \"dance floor\". I don't think there is much going on Wednesday nights-this is apprently \"it\". Some guys left to do Casey Moores, but since the dance floor wasn't packed and the other tables were filled, I just left after one beer. I have no idea what this place is like other nights, but the bartenders were friendly and the general vibe of this place is laid-back but not cheezy."}
{"text":"So I'm new to the city and heard about this place on the radio.  The 'chap told tales of cold brews and homemade English cuisine which sparked my curiosity and my thirst, so I headed on down the 51 for some suds and spuds.  Amazing pub feel with authentic techniques made the overall experience rather impressive, even more impressive was the Shepherds Pie  with brown gravy, that made my mouth scream for seconds.   It lost a star because of the somewhat questionable parking lot which made me feel kinda uncomfortable during the walk out, but perhaps maybe that's just my snot side speaking."}
{"text":"My favorite bar ever! Live right down the street and I've been going here for past year, everyone there is super friendly and nice. I love the music, food, the beer! They also have pool tables and darts. And have karaoke night, trivia night, poker night, and ladies nights. Love this bar, if you haven't checked it out yet, you should!!!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places but the service has gone way downhill as of late...I can't count how many times I've walked in there when  they are  dead and there is a swarm of servers hanging around but none of them can be bothered with having to work.....I guess they don't like money. On top of that there are a couple of them who are just downright rude...not sure if this is the direction the owners have decided to go in but they can count me out, perhaps this is why it's dead whenever I walk in?  The food is just ok....it used to be the \"go to\" when we were feeling super hungry but didn't know what we wanted (it's right around the corner!)  But I try to stay away from the place as much as possible now.     Beer selection is better than most places around here...but the well drinks have consistently been weak throughout the past year."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pubs. Great bangers, wings and beer. Always chill and dart machines!"}
{"text":"This is a pub.  Pool, darts and good beer.  The food is typical bar food with an English flavor to it.  The crowd is always a mix, and a pleasant one at that.  It's central location makes it easy for the after work crowd, which is when I went.  Haven't been there in the evening.  Plenty of parking, which is a plus in this area."}
{"text":"Loved the calm atmosphere. The Cornish pastie appetizer was delicious as was the classic Fish and Chips, which was what brought me to the spot in the first place.   I enjoyed the relaxed service as well. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Love coming here for team trivia night on Thursdays.  They have Guinness on tap, which makes this girl very happy, and decent irish food.  We love the team trivia guy."}
{"text":"My husband lived in England and had a strong reccomendation on this place because of the food.  We didn't make it that far.    When we walked in everything look dirty- the floors, walls, booths, pool tables - and the place was dimly lit!  I could not believe this bar served food.  Nothing about it said restaurant.  The decor was everything British which may have been cute if they took a rag and wipe the dust off.  No one greeted us when we walked in so we just sat down at a table.  There was a waitress wandering around that looked just as lost as we did.  She finally came over and gave us some menus, took our drink order and that was it... we never saw her again.  While we waited we had a while to look over the menu.  All the British food sounded like some type of variation of pot roast.  I guess that's what British cuisine consists of but none of it sounded appealing.  Still waiting it gave me more time to look around and I started to get angry because I couldn't believe I was about to order food from such a dirty establishment (I could only imagine what the kitchen looked like).  I was shocked to see kids running around... I wouldn't take Bebe's kids in there.   I clocked it; for 15 minutes we sat there without food or drinks, just menus.  Our booth faced the bar and the bartenders looked at us a few times but never sent anyone over to our table. Could I have asked for our server?  Sure.  But by this point I knew I wasn't spending a dime here and wanted to see how long it would take someone to come over to us so I could tell what I thought of their service.  Finally we receded, parched and starving we got up and left the George & Dragon.  What a waste of time!"}
{"text":"G&D was our first stop for our Pub Crawl, the fried food sampler was good and the drinks were decent pour and priced.   The server was nice and everything went well.   The location is lose to a rail station with just a short walk."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to check out George and Dragon last Sunday because it was such a nice day out and we wanted to do some day drinking at a place we hadn't been before. George and Dragon it was. The patio is long but narrow with only a handful of round tables on it. However, it's still a nice place to sit with a beer and chat. After a drink on the patio, we headed inside for our next round and decided to just cozy up to the bar. The inside decor is not going to wow you at all, but I appreciate the amount of TVs they have near the bar, showing everything from women's college basketball to English Premier League soccer. I'm also a big fan of bar sports, so the pool table and dart boards in the back get a thumbs up from me as well.  The draft beer selection is large...probably the largest of any of the pubs I have visited in the Valley. I believe it was about $4.75 for a pint, which is slightly cheaper than pubs like Rula Bula. The menu runs the gammet from traditional British fare to very Americanized food with very very moderate prices. Chris had a fish sandwich which he enjoyed and I had a BLT which I requested with no mayo. However, more than half way into the sandwich I realized there was mayo on it! This shocked me because normally I can always detect mayo on sandwiches as I hate it so much...so I'm not sure what G&D did, but they snuck mayo past me and I still loved the sandwich! The fries that came with the sandwiches were tasty. Our bill  (before tip) after five pints of beer, an appetizer, and two sandwiches came to $40.  The two bartenders that waited on us were incredibly friendly and quick. From the signs I saw inside, it looks like Sunday-Thursday, they do a reverse happy hour starting at 11 pm with 2 for 1 well drinks. I love the laid back vibe of G&D and the booths look comfy, so I will be back."}
{"text":"I was all set to write a review of this Friday afternoon and give it two stars, but Friday night, after the ball game, we headed up there.  Somewhere in between the good conversation, loud-but-not-too-loud bar noise and more than a few drinks I had a great time.  The trappings (flags, showy beer taps, etc) ring a bit false to me, but I am, after all, an Irishman treading in dangerous territory.    Drinks are stiff and relatively cheap.  There's usually always a free table to sit at and the clientele is varied and friendly.  Not the best of CenPho but not the worst, either."}
{"text":"Okay had to come back and edit my review. Honestly I couldn't be much happier. Previously the fish fry was barely tolerable. Now, it is THE fish fry I have been searching for since moving here from the NE.   The fish fry is excellent, the coleslaw is great. The service is good. I dunno not much else to say?  Only thing - I miss the old booths. The new tables are pretty wobbly. I won't take off a star for that though"}
{"text":"My head is still throbbing in protest after the 1st EVER George and Dragon Toga Pub Crawl:Just imagine  a bunch of drunkards in togas on the light rail terrorizing local bars such as The Old Spaghetti Factory;  Cheuvront (they LOVED us); Carly's Bistro; The Lost Leaf; reBar; Lucky Strike; Copper Blues; Seamus's and then back to George and Dragon where the fun all started.  A FANTASTIC bloody good time. A shout out to the roller derby girls who were doing their own pub crawl...sorry we had to part ways.  Too much good fun.......can't wait for the next one!!!!!"}
{"text":"I went tonight (06/03) for the first time ever and thoroughly enjoyed my time there. The place was packed for the USA soccer game, but the level of service didn't make it seem that way. Servers were on point. If my glass was near empty, Jennifer had a full one coming. If I said I wanted another beer, she had it to me in less than 2 minutes. Food took a little bit of time, but that was because so many people were ordering at one time. Jennifer made sure to let us know that things were coming along and apologized for the wait because of the number of tickets. I never once felt like she had forgotten us. Even when I wanted to close out at the same time as half the restaurant, it was quick.  The food itself was very good. The mozzarella sticks were prepared perfectly. Actually some of the best I've had. Not too greasy and the cheese was perfect. The fish and chips were some of the best I've ever had - the fish, that is. They were very crispy, but not over cooked and not greasy. The chips (French fries) weren't my favorite as they were thicker than I prefer, but it didn't make me feel less appreciative about the dish.  I don't know what this place was like before the remodel, but I loved my first experience tonight. My party felt the same way and we'll be back."}
{"text":"Love the food, love the \"divey-ness\", love the prices. It's not everybody's cup of tea, it's old and kind of broken but I wouldn't change a thing."}
{"text":"This is a gem of a place situated near downtown Phoenix, a home from home, myself being an Englishmen can appreciate everything about this place. The decor of dark wood in a dimly lit open room oozes English pub to me.  Great place to watch sports, you can sit anywhere inside and see a screen if that is what you want to do, if not look around and you'll see all our famous English football (soccer) teams scarfs (all bar the most famous Leeds United FC, I'll have to donate one of mine)  the waiting staff are friendly and attentive and the menu has all the classic English dishes, my recommendation would be a full English breakfast off the weekend brunch menu ( only thing missing was a slice of black pudding) food was great and my wife was sold on how good an English breakfast is.   Have been here since and had a Sunday roast dinner again warm hearty food cooked to a good standard."}
{"text":"Stopped back here for my Nieces 21st birthday. As always, great food and great service.The staff went out of their way to make my Nieces day special. Thank you. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Cheap drinks! and it wasn't even happy hour! SCORE! Seriously. I thought this place was a Chinese food place due to the name. I had no idea it was actually a Pub. My mistake. I was here this past Saturday celebrating a friends birthday and we enjoyed ourselves. Between people watching and just talking about everything (and I do mean everything) plus the drinks were cheap. What more can a girl ask for? I will definitely be back here again!"}
{"text":"I'm being generous - they don't deserve the star.  Because several friends recommended the G&D, I went in there once.  The place was NOT busy.  I sat down at a table.  While waiting for service, I pulled out my PDA and read the news off the net.  When I looked at my watch, and saw that half-an-hour had gone by without anyone EVER coming within 6ft. of my table -- much less asking if I wanted to order anything -- food or booze or coffee or a glass of water -- nobody.  Nothing.  I simply got up and walked out.  When I go to a restaurant, I do NOT beg for service.  I expect someone to come to my table and ask me if I want something.  They didn't do that.  Fortunately for me, there is, at least, another restaurant (there may even be two or three) in the greater Phoenix metropolitan area, so I won't starve.  Altho, with that level of non-service, the G&D might."}
{"text":"The best place in town to watch European football (soccer for locals). I would rate it with 5 stars but the food is just tasteless, so think about watching football and having drinks there only."}
{"text":"So many compliments are due the owner.  Let's just say that I had plenty of beverages before arriving.  A few more and an empty stomach, I climbed onto the seat of my 29er........ yeah the owner literally cam outside, \"inspired\" me to walk home and secured my bike for the the evening.  Thanks man and cheers!  What a cool, local spot."}
{"text":"Tonight is Friday which means its all you can eat fish and chips. I tell you what, they did not disappoint.  As Arizona is not a sea faring state, they of course use previously frozen fish that they make their own batter for. Now, don't get turned off by the fish being from where it is,  you can barely tell. The fish was flaky and juicy and the batter was crisp and flavorful. The chips were soft on the inside and crisp on the outside so they were obviously cooked at the perfect temperature.  Service was of the top, and attention wasn't lacking. I would highly recommend that you spend some time at our local English pub, it won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Tell us to grab any seat.. Friday 830p. Never come to take an order. Never will be back"}
{"text":"I've been here before my visit, but we had a party of six. The food was cold, the service staff was rude, and the manager left in the middle to take care of business. We were here on a Sunday and it was not that busy."}
{"text":"I've only been here once and it was OK. If you're into the English pub scene, you would probably like it since everything is decently priced. However, a friend of mine tells me that they broke into her car on a Friday night, smashed the window and all, so I would be careful about what you leave in your vehicle."}
{"text":"First time to the George&Dragon so nice.  Took the light rail and met friends for lunch. Our server Casey was so helpful suggesting EF cucumber vodka for my Bloody Mary , Perfect!!  She was very knowledgeable and helpful with the food menu .  I had the fish and chips, great batter on the fish and the cole slaw was really tasty. My friends had bangers and mash which they raved about.  Casey introduced us to the owner Dave ...they're very excited about the upcoming Bar Rescue show. The positivity exuded by all the staff made our visit very special. We're ready to go back again soon.."}
{"text":"Was a regular 10 years ago and now have moved back.  Place is upgraded on decor which was needed same great food.  Best fish and chips in Phoenix.  Go to the bar, Kat and Haylee are great bartenders.  For waitress' Kara is the best.   On sundays full English dinner is available and is fantastic"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times over the years for dinner.  Had no clue they had a weekend brunch menu.  I think I was the only one that  ordered off the regular menu in our group.  Based on comments no one went away unhappy with their choices.  Our waitress had never worked opening shift before but did a great job.  The place is getting a little worn but it fits.  I am sure I'll end up here again."}
{"text":"I have been coming to G&D for a while now. I was introduced to the friendly, British bar, by a good friend of mine who was determined to slay the dragon (which she finally did after 2 or 3 years.) I have to be honest, I have never had a meal at this place, but I have had plenty to drink. Just the other day, my running club met up for drinks after our long run, and it just so happened to be trivia night! If it wasn't for work the next day, we would have stayed the entire night and finished up the game. A couple of my friends did end up ordering dinner from the menu. I have to say that the fish looked delish! The only downfall to this place is that it does get a little loud during the busy nights and the sound system can be a little better for those who are trying to listen to the trivia questions (on Thursday). Overall, this is a very friendly, neighborhood bar and I am definitely not about to cut this one from the list."}
{"text":"I love the \"no apologies\" approach of George and Dragon.  I've been going to this bar for almost 8 years (which is a lifetime in PHX), and not even the scent has changed (despite being smoke-free, for what, like 2 years)  Its like the Binion's Horseshoe of Phoenix pubs.    Classic.  Comfortable. Cocksure.   Vile.  Smarmy.  Ruddy.  Everything a British Pub should be -- complete with Smithwick's and Fish/Chips.  Their music is tip-top, and though it doesn't exist anymore, I was highly, HIGHLY impressed by their Northern Soul night on Wednesdays.  I mean, holy smokes, what a freaking stunt!  Too bad it couldn't maintain.  Either way, you've got the EPL on Saturdays and Sundays, so this appeases the loss of midweek, underground Motown.  And as an aside, this place is mos def in my Top 5 of places that need to have the smoking ban recanted.  Yes, i have a list."}
{"text":"I stopped by here a few weeks ago for a quick lunch.  I had been here once before but it was just for drinks.  I had never been there before for a meal.  Meal:  I went with the special, which was just a roast beef sandwich and fries.  I had a New Castle beer to go along with it.  Taste: Talk about the most boring meal ever!  The sandwich had no flavor, the cheese was bland, and the fries didn't have any salt or other seasoning.  I must have went through an entire bottle of ketchup to give the meal some sort of life.  This meal did not even come close to stimulating my taste buds.  The meat was cooked halfway decently and the fries were done well, but not for the love of Christ, bring some salt if you intend to eat here.  2 out of 10.  Value: The prices were fair and reasonable.  The portion size seemed right in line the pricing. 3 out of 5.  Service/Cleanliness:  The waitress was new but did a great a job being attentive.  She seemed to have a good grasp of the menu and the beer selection.  She had a great attitude and was friendly.  Nothing indicated to me that the place isn't clean. 10 out of 10.  Atmosphere:  Nothing too exciting, but it should be considered that this place isn't in business for the lunch crowd.  The decor is decent.  The time I was here before my lunch visit, the place seemed to be lively without being annoying.  4 out of 5.  Overall:  Don't go here for the food.  Just come here for a few drinks for a quiet Friday night.  If you really, really, really need to eat here, go to Penzeys Spices first because what George and Dragon is to food is what Sheriff Joe is for civil rights.  19 out of 30 points, 2 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"This place is now your standard mediocre tasteless pub food.  Even the Shepherds pie is not authentic.  It is not British food.  The restaurant used to be very good but not anymore.  The service is awful last time I went I waited so long to order food we left. I wont be back."}
{"text":"I really want to give the George & Dragon 5 stars, between the last time we were there and our server was awesome.  The Awesome Local Pub/ Football Hooligan bar atmosphere they provide, and the Owners and the the british expat company they keep who are characters in and of themselves.  the G&D is truly an experience.  Unfortunately on our last visit our waitress seemed to have horse blinders on, on several occasions we waved, we raised our hands, we yelled at her back and somehow she just didn't make eye contact or acknowledge that we were trying to get her attention.  despite somewhat unresponsive service we were still able to get drinks regularly enough throughout the night..  I also tried the food for the first time, it felt fitting to order the fish and chips, the chips are just steak fries with no memorable qualities,  however the fish was I believe cod, but the batter was very tasty and crispy, it was served with a side of coleslaw that wasn't bad either.  overall the atmosphere in this place is awesome, and the british expats that hang around the bar make it that much more convincing.  I'm confident that the incident we had with service was just that \"an incident\" and it's possible the waitress was just spread thin or stressed.  I'm confident our next visit will be fine, because I enjoy going to this bar."}
{"text":"Great place for both its food and the eclectic decor.  Place has great WiFi and staff is super friendly.  I've had the meatloaf, the fish and chips and the halo cheeseburger.   Ask the staff on how they do it, mine looked perfect.  The meatloaf was ok nothing impressive but the fish and chips and the halo cheeseburger were excellent.  I love  the lighting in the place gives it a kitschy touch.  Atmosphere is nice and casual, I've been here numerous occasions by myself and just relaxing.  Definitely on my regular list and I'm taking the bangers and mash home for my lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"Hella fun vibe! My friend & I came here for a late night bite, & booooy it was fun! They had a Karaoke set up, and everyone were having a good time. It is a pub, so they have a bar & other games all around the restaurant. Food had massive portions & were also very good! Price is very affordable for the portions. Definitely recommend it, especially if you and your friends want to have a good time!   This place is where it's at!"}
{"text":"Joe and I saw George and Dragon on Bar Rescue so we had to have lunch there to see if it was better than we remembered it. If you like English food, you'll love this place. The fish and chips was lightly battered, perfectly cooked. The pastry puff filled with ground beef and veggies was my favorite. The staff was friendly. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The post-party for the Switch OYE was here. Even if there were only 8 of us. We came just in time for trivia night. Which is apparently a big deal here. I LOVE trivia with useless factoids, so I felt right at home. 40 questions really tries the useless knowledge portion of the brain. Which in my case is most of it. Unfortunately I was already a little sauced and was 3 more beers deep by the time we were done. It was a great time, including war paint. We scored 28 out of 40. I am going back soon to redeem myself. Georgie S, are you down?  We also created a new game that works when Nikki F is there.  If she starts to fall asleep, someone says her name and then rest of the table, in unison, must yell her name again.  Good clean fun!  I like the decor. There are authentic European football jerseys and scarves all over the place. Rugby too.   A couple of side notes. 1 star deduction for, what I am guessing was a manager, coming over and telling us we were being too loud and disruptive. WTF?!!! We are in an English pub, with a lot of beer, drunk people, playing a competitive trivia game. Are you serious!? I was dumb founded and I think I may have talked back to this dude. Couldn't believe it.   I have started my \"Slay the Dragon\" card. Only 61 more beers to earn my shirt. Starting to train now.   Sorry for the pic post Nathan S, I had too."}
{"text":"Strong drinks. Cheap drinks. Yummy food. Great location. Easy and laid back. One of my favorite bars."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the fish and chips. The fish flaky, thick cut, with a thin crispy batter. The chips... a little to soft. Overall pretty good. Looks like a great place to catch a soccer game. English style food."}
{"text":"0 stars....We waited for over  40 minutes after the beer fest...two servers and no menu or water offered...could not find a server....not prepared...not good..,go some place else....super crowded and no help..,left after 45 minutes...."}
{"text":"Traditional english pub with English beer on tap. Cheap happy hour.   I would leave the appetizers and focus on getting a traditional english dinner. Also the puddings are brilliant!   We have tried a variety of things on the menu and all was good. Kind of funny, but my favorite is their english curry, nice and spicy on a bed of brown rice and naan bread.   They lost a star because the service is just so-so, takes a bit longer to get the ball rolling than needed."}
{"text":"This place is great. We've taken friends, out of towners, and family here. We went here the night of my bachelorette party. The food is good. I've had the hummus.. mmm I forgot what other food I had here. The service is great, there are pool tables and darts. The bathrooms are horrible, but you really go in expecting that. The big comfy booths are key. The outdoor area is really nice at night under the misters. We had one lame waitress once. She did a good enough job but had the sense of humor of a wet mop.   This place is always a good time."}
{"text":"So we were over here for an event and someone from this restaurant talked a bunch of us into coming in for food and drinks. Apparently they weren't expecting to have anybody come in because they we're not able to accommodate the extra crowd on a Sunday. The service was very slow but that's not the complaint. We watched our waitress walk to every table around us and leave us hanging about 3 different times during our experience at the very end when she gave us our checks back in a pile of cards and papers and expected us to go through it all I was Fed Up the only reason this restaurant is getting 2 stars and not one star is because the food was actually good and maybe one day I'll try this place again and change my review."}
{"text":"We definitely want to give this place a try again.  We made our way to this location on a Thursday night around 8 p.m. and the main portion was pretty decently packed, so we sat off to the right side, which seemed more open.  Next time I would like to sit int he main part where all the noise and decor is really happening.    I had the Cornish Pastie - \"puff pastry stuffed with ground beef, vegetables, served with  mashed potatoes, peas and gravy.\"  And he had the Shepherd's Pie - \"marinated lean ground beef, mashed potatoes, sharp cheddar and gravy upon request.\"  Both were delicious!  The food was definitely the hard core return factor for us.  The staff seemed friendly enough and our waitress took care of everything in an efficient manner - she had a group that went from about 8 people to roughly 20 people in the corner booth over the ~45 min. we were there so she got a tad tied up towards the end with accommodating their orders.    Overall: B+ Sit in the main part of the restaurant - be ready for a bit of loud music / noise.  Enjoy the decor and eat some good pub food."}
{"text":"The first time my boyfriend and I ate here, it was during the early evening, and very crowded - which we thought was a good sign. It took at least 15 minutes to be waited on, as waitresses passed our table many times before asking us if we wanted a drink. It took another 15 minutes to get said drink. We ordered food when our drinks came so that we wouldn't have to wait, but it was another 30 minutes before dinner came. We both ordered a 'pastie' dish - mine was chicken and it was delicious!! The best I've ever had, with a light pastry crust, filled with veggies and chicken, and a delicious gravy. The mashed potatoes were great too, with a chunky chicken gravy. I took more than half home because it was a lot of food. My boyfriend had the beef pastie dish, and his was just as delicious. He cleaned his plate.  Our second visit was a complete disappointment. (There were three of us). I think the reason we didn't notice the overall appearance and condition of the restaurant the first time we went was because it was evening, and the place was dark and somewhat crowded. This time, when we walked in, we were hit with a strong dingy, musty smell. I wanted to turn around and walk out right then, but we had been driving a while and were all very hungry, so we decided to stay.   It was mid to late afternoon, and the place was nearly empty. We were seated at a booth in a corner. The booth was nasty - the chair covers had holes in them, the table top was dirty... the whole place was dirty - the floors, counters, everything. It made me cringe. Again, I wanted to leave, but the guys were so hungry, they wanted to eat. The place was not busy at all, but the waitress that sat us, did not come back to our booth for at least 15 minutes. It took anther 25 minutes just to get drinks. The servers hung around the bar, not attending to the few patrons in the place. I couldn't find the dish I wanted on the menu, and when the waitress finally came back to our table, I asked her about it. She said they no longer had it, and the chef who worked at that time was no longer there. I was disappointed. I asked if there was anything comparable to it. She pointed out a vegetable pastie dish on the menu, so I decided to try it.   Our orders took forever to come. We finished our drinks and were not attended to for another 30 minutes when the guys meals came. Mine was still being made. My boyfriend ordered the fish and chips. They were extremely dry, mostly batter with barely any fish in them. He pointed it out to the waitress, but she didn't apologize or offer to replace the order. The french fries were dark brown - an indication that the oil was old and needed to be replaced.  My son had a cheese burger that was overcooked, dry and bland. His french fries were also brown and unappetizing. My order came out about 15 minutes later, and when I cut into the pastry, the vegetables were mushy and unrecognizable. I tasted it anyway. It was bland and mushy, no taste of seasonings or salt, disgusting. If there were vegetables in it, they were so overcooked, they were complete mush. I sent the dish back. The waitress came back, saying she showed it to the manager (or owner?), and that he said \"That isn't how it's supposed to be made.\" She then asked if she could have the chef make another. Seriously?? I declined. I wanted to walk out right then, but the guys were real hungry and decided to finish eating, even though they weren't happy with their meals at all. At the end of the meal, the waitress brought our tab and my dish was on it. Of course, I had her take it off the ticket. We left disappointed, and I was still hungry.  To sum it up:  Very dirty, dingy, and smelly. Poor, slow service. Terrible food.   Anyone who says this place has the 'best' food in town, or that they have the 'best fish and chips' - either has NO taste buds, or are friends with the owner. They would be doing a better service to be honest and get him to make the changes necessary to turn the restaurant/bar into a place people want to come back to. If changes aren't made, I expect this restaurant to go belly up in the very near future. It might behoove the owner to call in 'Restaurant Impossible\" or simply shut the place down."}
{"text":"Can you review non-service? This place tried to ruin my Sunday...but its cool. I'm cool man. I'm cool. I went to the George and Dragon with 4 friends this last Sunday afternoon for a breakfast/brunch and some hair of the dog after a night of trying to kill my stupid liver and all will be well in the world. Right? Found out from the owner's mouth they'll be featured on Bar Rescue soon. This might have been my first hint of things to come but hey this is my first time here and I'll give 'em a shot yeah? The owner is on the patio with his friends drinking and partying. Cool, If I owned a bar and it wasn't slammed (it seemed chill) I'd probably party on a Sunday afternoon too.  The bartender comes out to the patio to take our order. I am patiently waiting my turn to order, I know what I want and I am prepared to deliver this information is in simple and easy to remember terms. We're a five top; she takes 4 orders:1.eggs Benedict, a mimosa, 2. a water and a coke, 3. chicken fried steak, a beer, 4. a chorizo burrito, a beer 5...uh oh, the order's getting too big and she didn't prepare with pen and paper so she's going to go get some and...wow, its odd that I'm still able to remember everyones order and I didn't even write it down, thats weird & then she walks off without taking mine?! I am not sure why.  It wasn't like I was distracted or on my phone or ignoring the event or giving her a dirty look or nuthin'.  But she just walked off as I was trying to order. 5 minutes goes by...so now I've got to follow her inside to order. Okay, no biggie, maybe she just was distracted. It's cool. I'm a mellow dude. I go in and ask if I can also place an order and all will be well in the world. Right? She's busy entering orders into the POS computer.  She says she'll be with me in a minute.  Ok. Cool. A couple walks up next to me at the bar. She'll be with them in a minute.  Ok. cool...so I now assume I'll place my order and head back outside and then the couple that walked up after me will place their order and all will be well in the world. Right? She takes their order first! I'm annoyed because I was there first and I just got done chasing her down and well ok what ever so long as I get to order. So I wait. Finally she acknowledges me, but...she seems a little distracted?  Hmmm....maybe she really was slammed but then why is the owner partying outside lol? ok. I am also a very forgiving person so whatevs...I just want a mimosa and some breakfast.  I order. She says she'll bring it out to the patio with the rest of my friends order. So...cool. I see her enter my order on the POS!  I go outside thinking all will be well in the world. Right?  Our drinks come. To me thats proof that the error has been corrected since my beverage came out with all the others. My mind is at ease and all will be well in the world. Right? 20 minutes later...here comes the bartender...with all the food... except mine....Oh yeah, did I mention it was only 4 out of 5 of us ordering actual food so...yeah...mine didn't come. She explains she'll be right back with mine and walks back inside. All will be well in the world...gulp....Right? Guys? ...right? ...guys? 10 minutes go by... my pals are halfway thru their meals. Another waitress walks up and asks if we're all doing okay. I say no, I am waiting for food and explained that the bartender was supposedly coming right back with it... 10 minutes ago and my friends are almost done eating. She asks if I still want the order. \"SIGH....uh....if you can bring it quickly sure.\" I was still polite. She goes inside... about 5 minutes later the bartender comes out to tell me they are still working on my order. I have nothing to add to the conversation so she walks back inside. 5 minutes go by.  Worst customer service experience I've had in a long time.  My friends are done eating.  I'm done with my drink. I'm done waiting for food. I'm done with this bar. I won't ever come back, not even for free snacks. I pay for my drink without a word. On the upside I saved money on a tip. She tries to explain that they gave my breakfast away to someone else.  Perfect. I don't have any words. I leave. It was suggested by a friend who was with me that I complain but that to me seems like a practice in futility. I already brought it to two peoples attention and there were no positive results. Besides, you can't upset a fat man over food and expect him to be rational.  If the bartender hasn't figured it out by now there's no fixing it. I mean didn't they just have a team of pros swoop in to save their business?  I think Bar Rescue missed a spot when they painted the place; they should've painted a big sign out front that read \"Under new management, now hiring competent staff!\" or maybe \"GOOD NEWS! We're shutting our doors! Going out of business sale!\" Terrible Pub 1(after all the mimosa was okay & the bartender apologized) Bar Rescue 0, hung over light rail rider...also a 0 and all was well in the world. Right? Guys?"}
{"text":"I don't know what it is about this place. It smells like my Grandma's closet, the clientele are questionable and none of it makes a bit of damned sense why I keep returning. Besides their beer selection putting a twinkle in my eye and the menu making my heart stop. I find it endearing to post up and get crunk on the patio overlooking Central Ave.  I took a first date here, she enjoyed herself and I got a goodnight kiss that night. He shoots, he scores! Maybe it was just the booze talking.  Nevertheless, it's definitely my default. Since its within walking distance, \"G&D\" is sent in a mass text message on any of the 6 nights I drink."}
{"text":"G&D was a sad day for me.  Have been super excited to check this place out because A. it looks Cool and B. friends have told me how awesome it is   But alas I have to give it a C.... We took the lightrail downtown for a Rattlers game and afterwards hit G&D for a drink and snacks afterwards.   It was really busy because of the hockey game being on so we couldn't find anywhere to sit in the bar area or even get to the bar to order a drink... so we found a table tucked in the corner in the \"restaurant\" side... only probably here was service.. no one cared about those eating food!    We only had about 10 mins to look at a menu and order before the kitchen closed at 11 so we had to track down a waitress to take our order.  Menu for food was quite typical.  Fish Sandwich, Burgers, etc.  Friends enjoyed it.. but also had a few beers in, so I cant say its more than any other \"bar food\"  I only ordered the chips and salsa which were less than adequate... straight from the store, nothing special at all.    I think this place could have been a lot better if we had better service and were in the bar area which is clearly the \"cool\" part."}
{"text":"Been going here for years, for Lunch, Dinner etc...Excellent choice of Beer on Tap including the legendary Harp for you Cider Fans.  On Saturday nights they sometimes have a band on the tiny stage--that part could use some work. However the atmosphere is great and a bit like an English pub, although much bigger of course, there is another huge dining room that rarely gets used and lots of flags of the different counties and sports teams of England. Long Live the Queen!!!"}
{"text":"Sadly, the George and Dragon isn't what it used to be. For years I've come here for the British food but I guess I'll have to find somewhere else.   The Steak & Mushroom Pie, Chicken and Mushroom Pie, and Steak and Kidney Pie have been discontinued, but are still shown on the menu on the website - very disappointing.  I chose the Shepherd's Pie instead which was actually pretty good.  My wife ordered the \"George and Dragon's Famous Fish and Chips\". They were inedible - overcooked to death and hard as a rock.  The coleslaw was warm.  The only thing edible on her plate were the chips (french fries).  Such a disappointment,"}
{"text":"Shyster Female Bartender - Always count your change before you leave the bar. Was in Saturday afternoon 6/23 after their big soccer crowd. A female with long straight brown hair below her shoulders helped me with my order of a draft beer. She seemed pleasant enough and after handing her a twenty for a single draft beer, she handed me back my change in a weird way. It was folded with the ones showing. Quickly I peeled off a one and tipped her and went to a table. I had a strange feeling the way she handed my change back to me and finally after 5-10 minutes checked my change and in fact my intuition was correct. Instead of giving me $14 dollars back, she only gave me $4 dollars back. I sat there looking at $3. I went in with a twenty and was going to charge lunch on my Credit Card. I hope she chokes on the $10.00 she shorted me. Karma is a nasty thing, girl. I worked as a bartender for years and years. I know all the tricks and have finked on fellow employees for stealing and ripping people off. I ain't no rookie on the games one can play."}
{"text":"Damn good Fish n Chips, Chicken Curry, and Satay.  The English dinners on Sunday are very good, as well.  Good place for a pint of your favorite English ale or stout."}
{"text":"Three and a half stars.   I feel for this place as the light rail construction has made it damn near impossible to even try to drop in here. In the days before the light rail destroyed Central Avenue I would come here from time to time, and it was always ok. Not especially good or bad, just ok.  Beers are expensive but they have a good selection of foreigns to test out. What is mildly discouraging is that even the domestics are overpriced.  They occassionally host cool events or concerts here and I highly recommend dropping in on days like those, but aside from that, whatever."}
{"text":"The food was good. There was no issue with that. But, the plate with the food on it came dirty and the order was wrong. The reason why they get only 2 stars is for poor customer service. The server wouldn't even smile. It almost felt like he could care less that we were there. He never checked on how the food was. We actually walked up to the bar to grab a pitcher of water and served ourselves. Never heard from him after that. We had to walk back up to the bar to pay for our meal as well. But, I'm sure he'll remember the 2¢ that we left on the table for his tip. Don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Expensive drinks and poor service but ample parking and a large venue. Karaoke on Monday nights though the wait is long and the host isn't great. The food is adequate but nothing special, hardly what I'd consider authentic English food. They have a smoking patio with both heaters and misters for those hot summer nights but the place gets quite busy.   Prior to their remodel they were an absolute mess. I've had friends who recieved their cooked food still wrapped in plastic, and numerous friends complain that waitresses added higher tips for themselves or tacked on more to their bills than what they had ordered. When brought to the owner's attention it was disputed and basically told, \"well you were drinking, you probably just didn't realize how many drinks you ordered\"..when there was only one drink bought and an entree. One waitress even altered the tip line from $5 to $25, this being the same occasion that the food was still wrapped in plastic!  I hope that there service in that regard has changed but I wouldn't know as I haven't bought food there since that occasion.   It is a fun venue, they have a poker league as well as the aforementioned karaoke, it does get very busy and there are very few servers so getting service takes awhile, even when ordering at the bar. Its a good place to bring a large group early on so you can stake out a table, or bring friends and family during the day when its much less busy. Despite my dislike, I always know I'll be back to GnD."}
{"text":"Love this Pub! The Shepherds Pie and bread pudding is AWESOME! Plenty of beer on tap and available. This place has that home town around the corner feel. My only complaint with this bar is that if you are female the waitresses tend to take their time serving you! Otherwise I dig the joint!"}
{"text":"I went somewhere tonight that I wish was George & Dragon, which made me realize that I had never written a review for one of my favorite standby restaurants.  So I wanted to give my 100th review to a place so deserving of recognition.  I've been to G&D dozens of times in the past 8 years, and I can honestly say that I've never had a bad meal or bad service.  As a vegetarian, my favorite meal was always the Cornish Pasty. Mmm. Just thinking about it makes my mouth salivate.  A beautifully flaky pastry filled with potatoes and vegetables.  And peas, I love peas.  So yummy, I can't really remember many other meals there, although I do remember having a very good roast beef recently.  The booths are awesome. The owner is incredibly British, and it shows.  There is a ton of authentic paraphernalia decorating these walls.  Plenty of British ales as well.  It's the standard to which I compare all British pubs in the valley."}
{"text":"My first and only experience (to date) with George and Dragon was not very pleasant. When you walk in you are magically whisked away to an all-too-authentic British pub. That's great if what you are after is smelling like an ashtray after a meal of Shepherd's Pie.   The waitress that served me seemed a little brusque. Maybe that's part of the restaurant's \"charm\"?  The bathroom was in a transitory state of disrepair... or at least I hope it was transitory. I wasn't even sure if I was supposed to be in there.  Televisions are available for watching the soccer match and they have many types of beer on tap. I noticed a jukebox but didn't turn it on for fear of being pummeled severely by the other gruff-looking patrons while the soccer match was on.  This place has a little bit of an edge to it. If that's what you're into and you're just looking for a spot to grab a beer with a buddy, then check it out for sure. I'm not sure when or if I'll be back again, personally."}
{"text":"For my 200th review...a place, that if it had not had such wonderful natural defenses, there may have been no reviews...  The George & Dragon (\"G&D\") earns its 5-star rating from: great barkeeps, quality pool tables, damn good fish and chips (and other grub), great atmosphere, good patrons, and sturdy walls.  Yes...I said sturdy walls.  Time: Friday, February 21, 2001.... 9:59:45 through 9:59:55 pm MST.  Event: The Great Guinness Toast of 2001 for the world record....at exactly 10 pm.  The reader's digest version:  Co-workers and I agree to celebrate HH at the G&D and stay 'till the Guinness toast.  We stake our claim on the first booth on the left as you enter.  In fact our party ebbs and flows over the course of the night and we take up much more than the booth and gobble up surrounding tables and standing room only floor space.  As the time to toast nears the G&D becomes packed to the gills.  Standing room only.  Loud as fuck.  Impossible to move.  There is a MC of sorts in the back keeping the crowd on task and announcing random countdown times...and starts the actual countdown at 30 seconds.  The entire bar has Guinnesses in their hands.    \"20...19...18...17...\" What was an already packed entrance (merely two feet away from my right) becomes ultra packed by a sudden rush of people falling forward like at a concert when the band shows up.  \"16...15...\" Screams...lots of them...and an even more frantic push in the doors and next to me.  It is so loud everywhere else the MC takes this for enthusiasm.  \"14...\" *Very loud crash* more screams...people literally climbing over people to get into bar...this is all just feet away from me.  MC hears this and assumes crowd really getting into it.  \"13...12...11...10...\" All the new people in bar look terrified and confusion reigns.  \"9...8...7...6...5...\" More screams and a second crash just feet away from me into bench outside booth.  MC continues completely oblivious...in fact maybe 80% of bar is oblivious.  \"......1! Cheers!\" Everyone, even all the people still picking themselves up off floor by the entrance, and all those who were once screaming bloody murder, and everyone surrounding the immediate scene, as well as yours truly, raise their pint and yell, \"Cheers!\"  Turns out, unbeknownst to me at the time, a patron was kicked out about 5pm earlier in the day.  He knew about the Guinness Toast at 10 pm.  So he proceeded to wait across the street in his truck, get more liquored up, and drives his truck into the G&D exactly at 10 pm as fast as he could get his truck going before the collision.  Luckily for many, including myself, he hit the pillar just to the left of the front door.  He proceeded to back up and try ramming the window outside my booth but only got minimal speed and was foiled by the bench.  He ran...and got caught.  So..G&D..gets 5-stars for having great natural defenses and good sturdy walls...I may not be here today if it hadn't."}
{"text":"Awesome local bar! This is always our go-to, fun atmosphere and always a solid crowd. The hummus platter is our favorite and a great deal for all that it comes with."}
{"text":"I wish we could have met under better circumstances but the moment I walked into your establishment I wanted to vomit.  It reeked of sweaty gym socks and vinegar and there was no room at the bar.  Maybe I will come back with \"What Odor?\" in hand and we can have a fresh beginning."}
{"text":"A really fun English pub, tasty food and great atmosphere. Food was very unique and reasonably priced. They have pool tables on the back as well as a pin ball machine. It's a good place to take out of town guests for a unique dining experience. Keep in mind tho, it is a pub, might not me for everyone."}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times over my life and have always enjoyed the food there. However, I went this past Saturday around 2pm and there was some sort of poker tournament going on with top 40 music playing over the speakers. Not really setting the English pub mood, so that was disappointing. But the food was still good and the service was decent, so real complaints.  I had the bangers and mash dinner and my mother had a Cornish pastie appetizer. The sausage was excellent with brown gravy and onions and the potatoes were very creamy.  Go for the food, not for the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Been coming here since David open the joint a few years(20)ago. Great place for a pint! \"Bar Rescue\" remodel gave it a more upscale, contemporary look and feel. Friendly staff, always a good choice."}
{"text":"Ive never had the food here, just drinks.  This is probably one of the most authentic British Pubs in the valley, proof by the Brit owner cracking jokes on the mic behind the bar.  They have a great tap and bottle selection, and their mixed drinks are pretty good as well. Very friendly staff, kind of slow sometimes, but very accommodating. The decor is nice, just kitchy enough. The pool tables are cheap, and I believe they have darts as well.  A great place to start or finish your night in Central Phoenix."}
{"text":"Stopped by here tonight with a few friends-- it wasn't what I expected. I have a few friends that rant and rave about this place, but I honestly found it to be okay. It wasn't fantabulous.  First, they played country music. I love country, but I found it a little odd that it was playing at a pub.  Second, the food was ok. Our waitress said that the bread pudding was amazing...it was alright. Rula Bula's is much better.  However, our waitress was the bomb. She made us Irish Mules even though they weren't on the menu :) And they were very good!!!  All in all, it was alright. I didn't think it was amazing, but it wasn't bad, either."}
{"text":"This place rocks! I've been going to this place for years and I must say... I'm a huge fan. The staff there is so happy all the time and really get to know you. Jana, HayHay and Kitty are absolutely amazing. When we sit at the bar, they took the time to really get to know us. When we walk in, they usually have our drinks before we sit down. That says something. They actually care about us and remember our faces. Jen, Kara, Kaytee, Ryann, all the Laura's, and anyone else I may have forgotten always has a smile on their face. Pending on where we sit or who's section we are in, if they are working, they always make time to visit our table. It's really nice to feel so welcome in this restaurant.  The food is very tasty. My husband loves the wings. They are always cooked just right. The English Kabob or the Halo cheese burger are his go to dishes. I always like to try new things so I've tried almost everything. I absolutely love the Fish and Chips, Stuffed Meatloaf and my absolute favorite, Chicken Curry.   The owner David is also a sweet man. If he is in the pub when we are there, he always visits and asked how things are going. Now this is not just to our table but he will walk around to each table to greet everyone and introduce himself.   We love this place so much, we asked if we could buy the pub for the night to celebrate our 1 year anniversary and throw the wedding celebration there as I did not get to wear white at the time we eloped. David worked with us for over a year to make sure we had all we needed to make the night great. We are blessed to have such good people around to help make our day so special.  Thank you George and Dragon. Here is to many more years. We will see you soon!"}
{"text":"This is more like dungeons and dragons, it is so freaking dark in there. They have some good food, decent service. Nothing stands out just ok. The owner is a goof ball and trys to hit on every women in the place."}
{"text":"The bartenders here are spectacular! Fun atmosphere! Pool, jukebox, outdoor seating...karaoke night on Mondays. Food is also so good"}
{"text":"Good spot to watch NFL football. We came here for a Thursday night game, and there was a decent crowd but it wasn't overcrowded. Good beer selection, and excellent wait staff. The food was slightly above average, not much to write home about. But overall a good atmosphere for a sports bar."}
{"text":"This was featured on Bar Rescue.  The place was very English before; but even better now.  Combo Bar/Restaurant (Pub), great service!  They definitely changed it up for the bar area and feature more English dishes.  Tonight, I tried their Sausage Roll that came with Branson Pickle Sauce & Stoned Ground Mustard.  The roll was crispy and so flakey & the sausage was seasoned & cooked well.  Of course, I had to have their previously famous fish (COD) & chips.  Just as good as before, but instead of one big piece, the cut in half and deep fried to golden perfection and not greasy.  Naturally, best with Malt Vinegar on everything!!!  Highly recommend if in the area."}
{"text":"This was our second venture to this joint: the first time was a disaster as we didn't even get noticed once so no food or drink was to be had. The staff gets perfect marks for ignoring us, This time the joint wasn't to busy so figured we would have a decent chance at getting service. Well we sort of got service from a staff member who seemed annoyed we bothered her to order. The drinks were slow to come out and for beer it wasn't very cold. Before we could ask for waters our server ran away. We did finally order \"food\" the curry wings looked like a pile of gooey vomit and didn't taste much better. There were three of us at the table, each regretfully had one wing and shoved the rest to the side. I ordered the Halo burger which had a crisp cheddar ring around it which was the best part. The burger itself was something straight from the freezer, pre-made greasy as all can be. No flavor and the condiments that came with the burger were the standard fare. The steak fries as a side should have stayed in the kitchen. They were underdone and soggy. No flavor either. My wife ordered the french dip, something that usually you can't screw up. Well these guys at G&D are batting 1000 with subpar food, I've tasted better french dips at hospital cafeterias. Our friend ordered the Reuben grinder, he said it was OK, but again the fries stayed on the plate. Our wait staff was non existent. She never bothered to check on us once. We had to stand up to show that we were ready for our check...that really didn't work so our friend had to track her down. Plan to ask for your check well ahead of time as they do not value your time. I guess we are the idiots for trying the place again but really you might get em on a bad day so give them the benefit of the doubt and try em again. Well twice was WAY more than I will be spending there. I know they have a lot of regulars and maybe these folks are fine with the usual horrible AZ customer service and crappy food. I for one, coming from Chandler, like to enjoy a decent meal. We didn't order anything complex yet this joint managed to make even a simple burger just plain bad."}
{"text":"The bartenders always know how make interesting shots!  Plus they have their \"Slay the dragon\" t-shirt for drinking all the beers.  Yeah...the shirt itself isn't amazing, but I'm down for any drinking contest.  I love the cranky old man owner.  He's a Man U fan so he's even better!  Go Red Devils!"}
{"text":"this was my first visit &  I will NEVER go back  I will NEVER go back I will NEVER go back I will NEVER go back I will NEVER go back I will NEVER go back kicking, dragging, screaming I will NEVER go back  ordered fish & chips, shepherd's pie & steak 'n kidney pie & beers fish & chips = blah, nothing special or memorable, just plain cheap cod that was NOT cheap in $ shepherd's pie = this was not shepherd's pie it was cottage pie and it was bland, tasteless, boring! steak 'n kidney pie = where was the kidney? (chips = blah)  If you have nothing to compare 'traditional British' food to, then you may consider it good, (except for the bland COTTAGE Pie)!!!    Only reason they got two stars is that the bartender/service wasn't awfully terrible.  I ask one question; do 'you' pay more attention to 'your' regulars?  OR, do 'you' pay more attention to the newbies so they want to be regulars?  oh, & $5/beer....?  & it's dirty, all the decor...cause it's never been cleaned/dusted since 1995."}
{"text":"The food here is really good...the problem is the service. It wasn't very busy but we waited a very long time for our drinks and then even longer for the food. It got to the point where we wondered if we should leave or not because we had other places to be. We were there a little over an hour for just getting a bite to eat. Very awesome if you have the time and don't mind slow waiting. Prices are reasonable and food is DELISH! So is the IPA"}
{"text":"Now I'm writing this in my British accent. Bloody good Mate! Okay that's all I got. I dig this place, the food is good & they serve it up in big portions.   It's a pub, so fights & blood on the floor is expected. Come on AMber, get out of Scottsdale much?  Anyways, I recommend this place. It's a cool place to get out of the heat, good oral hygiene is not required. =)"}
{"text":"We ended up there on Saturday night after a fabulous dinner and some pre drinking. We were met with friendly faces and an awesome waitress. She was the type of waitress that could anticipate what you would want to drink and never kept us waiting. It is a very chill, laid back environment, great for drinking the night away. the service was so impressive we never made it to the list of other places we wanted to try that night."}
{"text":"Fish and chips. The batter on the fish was as thick as the fish. I peeled it off like an orange before eating. I wasn't impressed with the chips or slaw. They weren't bad, but none of it fell into the \"famous\" category for me. My companion liked all of it.  There's no explanation for taste."}
{"text":"Returned for the wings and cider as promised then decided to stay for another meal, just to be fair:)   Wings again nicely hot, though not as insanely so as the last time, but appeared to have been brought up to heat twice. -1.5  star I  never want to  pay for reheats , especially when it has a deleterious effect on the food. This may work for soup, not so well for fish  /  wings.  The pastie ,mash and peas were quite good though.   Service much faster than our prior  experience too. Wife loved her fish and chips  , pretty happy on the zucchini appetizer, and just ok with the \"touch\" of Guiness in the cider that threatened to take over the glass.      3.5 rounded down to 3.  Hey that's one better than prior."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a traditional english pub, you may like this place.  To me, it's was a little too dark and damp and the menu was very limited and a little overpriced.  Seems like a good place to watch a soccer game, even though the TV's aren't that great."}
{"text":"We were interested in checking this place out again after the bar rescues hype. The curry was all sold out so I ordered the shepards pie. It was a huge portion of bland food. Also had the pretzel for an appetizer. The pretzel was obviously previously frozen and the cheese on the side was from a vat. Would not recommend. Fiancé had a bland burger, although the fries were tasty. This is a cool place to get a drink and hang out, but I would say avoid the majority of food. We won't be eating here again."}
{"text":"Large food portions, great veggie burger, friendly bartenders and crowd. Add to that a great beer selection and fun trivia, and I'm sold. Great place near the light rail!"}
{"text":"As far as dive bars go, this one is pretty bad. They have the worst service I've ever seen in a pub. Their food isn't much better. The only good thing I can speak that they do well is consistency.  They are consistency awful. Even with their new renovation it just feels like they polished a turd."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my visit to this unique eatery/bar. It has character, good food, authenticity, and flavorful but attentive staff. The music was a little baffling in that it varied from Nirvana to 50's music to instrumental and then some, which detracted from the theme of the place. But, that oddity is okay with me, and I'm sure I will be back."}
{"text":"English Flag tables and a very white hippie/70s /biker bar but its a chill bar. Drinks are cheap plenty of room. If you are planning to watch the straight outta Compton film coming aka, you are looking for a crowd with some color to their faces, I wouldn't recommend this bar. But its pretty clean, server make sure you are attended and they also seem to have a talent of knowing when your empty without hoovering so cool place. Strictly a drink review (after 11pm) , don't know if their food is worthy love.  Side notes - who messages on Yelp, read the review move on."}
{"text":"I love this pub! I'm a soccer fanatic, and this bar is DECKED out with scarves of most any club you can think of, and there is always soccer on the telly. Robby and Keith (owner and manager?) are a riot, and always greet you warmly when you arrive! The food is traditional English pub fare: the fish and chips and the bangers and mash are HIGHLY recommended! I hear the wings are pretty good, so I'll prob try them nixt visit! And if you need a good laugh stop by on a Monday night for karaoke, its a blast!"}
{"text":"So here it was Lenten season and Friday.  I was starving and in a city not like New Orleans in its available seafood fare!  What to do?  Remember that the British are  known for one food contribution....Fish and chips!  So you get on your bike and speed over to the place you've heard you can have a pastie, a sausage roll, and a steak and kidney pie on a regular footie day.  And Fish and Chips and a Strongbow Ale on a post  Mardi Gras Friday night!    And this place reeks of British wanna-bes and malt vinegar.  I think I even saw the reflection of the Queen Vic in the pool or urine out back!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here to check the place out. Personally I don't live here, but a friend does.  She's new to the area and wants to check out local bars. It was a quick stopover and I only drank water due to have two previous drinks at Hula's. I had to get home.. darn you Sheriff Joe, so I sampled the local water. ;)  This has a great laid back vibe and it very unpretentious.  The outdoor patio seems fantastic as well, although the misters were so hard core, there were puddles.  Apparantly there is kick butt trivia on Thursdays that we plan to attend. The bartender was prompt and courteous and my friends' drinks were half the cost that they were at Hula's. Say what?"}
{"text":"Great food... Can not even explain the enjoyment from the Greek pizza! So delicious in my mouth! And the Guiness promo! The boyfriend got free glasses! AND for the desert... Berry cobbler... YUM! Just moved from beach area CA... So not biased! Please enjoy this place?"}
{"text":"I have to be honest, I've not tasted the food at George & Dragon.  This is based solely on the libations.  I have been there a few times for some beer and chit-chat, and my favorite thing about this place is the energy that lights the place up.  It just has a \"fun place\" feel to it, and that opinion was shared by a couple of people I had met there now and then for some pints.  If a loud pub is not your style, this won't be either, but otherwise it's definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"I go to the G&D about once a year. Everytime the food is very average and the staff is indifferent. The wife and I went there a couple weeks ago, a buddy of mine Peter was doing a 24 hour piano marathon, pretty sure it was for St Joe's hospital. The corn beef and cabbage was flavorless deli corn beef. (no seasoning...) The wife had seasonless fish and chips. Better hiring and training will fix all this. So why the 3 stars after all this? Great live music and a well poured Guinness is worth something. ;)"}
{"text":"Love this place. I'm in the industry I come by after work. Great service great atmosphere. Kat and Jena are awesome!"}
{"text":"It is rare that I post any reviews anywhere, but when I do it is either because the service was phenomenal, or on the other end of the spectrum as terrible.  This review fits into the second category.    Many years ago, I used to work in Phoenix, and used to eat lunch at the George and Dragon.  I used to be served promptly, the food was delicious, and I enjoyed the place.  But time has not been kind to this place.    We went on 03/22/2014  We were kept waiting for 15 minutes before our 'server' brought us menus.   We kept having to ask for refills on our sodas.  We placed our order, and she didn't write anything down, which is actually a peeve of mine.    We noticed other people came in, were seated, and then because they ordered alcohol were served their meals promptly, and the server scurried over to refill their drinks.    We called another server over twice to ask for refills, and he couldn't be bothered.    We ended up waiting almost an hour and a half before we ended up paying for our drinks and leaving.  We complained to the manager but he didn't seem to care either.  We walked out, and warned other patrons going in.    It is sad that what was a good place has slipped so far, and that the only customers that matter are those that order alcohol.   Avoid this place.  Terrible service.  Enough said."}
{"text":"A popular and busy pub on a Saturday night. A young crowd mostly men watching sports and drinking beer. However we were an older group there for the food. My fish and chiips was a generous but tasteless plate of heavily battered fish and chips. Would not recommend the food."}
{"text":"Came here with my husband's English grandmother for lunch. She loved the experience! She had the English roast and was very happy with it. I had the Taste of England, mini portions of four dishes. The fish and pea soup were my favorites. I wasn't sure if it would fill me up when it first came, but it turned out to be an excellent lunch! The best part of the experience hands down was the staff. They were friendly and accommodating. It's great to have English fare in Phoenix!!!!"}
{"text":"So apparently I came in on an off night and it was slow.  This was fine because it allowed me to figure out my food and beer selection.  I went with a Guinness and the regular pastie. The beer was nice and cold, the pastie was delicious!  The appetizer portion was more than enough to fill me up.  Our waitress was busy, but still attentive and gave us a sample of a few beers we questioned. The pricing for food and beer were very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Guinness got me drunk- My waiter was efficient . We both wish we had [becky] though.   Beer gets ya drunk- Bombshell! Bad Ass! Looking &  Acting Servers!-  Go out have a good time, don't be a tool-  George & dragon has a good vibe. Support this place and its staff. First time here, not the last!  Donkey- [[Eaaawwwwwe Eaaawwwwwe]]"}
{"text":"Took Mom here since I'd read great reviews on the fish and chips.  As soon as we walked into the venue, I detected terrible body odor.  While the vibe was young and friendly, we didn't feel comfortable at all.  Then again, I never hung out in bars when I was younger, and neither did my Mom.  After trying out a couple restaurants' fish and chips, she definitely favors George & Dragon's (everything from the perfectly light, yet tasty batter, the best hand-cut steak fries, and tartar sauce she couldn't get enough of... don't forget the malt vinegar!), but laments on not being able to go back.  ..and thus continues our quest for a great fish and chips meal served in a great setting.  Any reco's?  We've been to McCormick and Schmick's and Rula Bula; both weren't good enough for her.  Please, no fast food chains like Long John Silver's, Pete's Fish and Chips, and similar spots (my terms, not hers as she LOVES LJS)."}
{"text":"4.5  stars because I think on another try it would be truly 5.   Very fun, lovely, and bustling. The sort of place you could see yourself going to a lot. Not the least bit pretentious and all the servers seemed in good spirits. I love the british themed tables and 80s alternative music.  The happy hour is amazing value, as many have pointed out and I thought the food was pretty good."}
{"text":"This establishment is so fun.  Great food.  Awesome tap beer.  I haven't been here in so long and great changes.  They turned up the volume on a game for me.  I'll be back soon!!!  Woot"}
{"text":"Dropped in for drinks and this place was really pretty busy for a Wednesday night at 7:30pm. Our waitress was friendly but it did take a while to get her attention whenever we were ready for another round. The drink prices were reasonable and the atmosphere is laid back and comfortable. We didn't eat on this trip but have enjoyed their food in the past. This is a great place to meet up with friends to watch soccer, football, or play a little pool."}
{"text":"Four of us ate here for the first time and were all very impressed. I have high standards for food and service but this exceeded them.   SERVICE: First and foremost the service was OUTSTANDING! I wish I would had noted the girls name but her description of the menu was fabulous. Made our mouth water for everything. The food was just what she described. She always was there at the right time and anticipated our next need.  FOOD: It came out piping hot (which is a must for me). The unique combinations of flavors were prepared and presented perfectly. We had fish and chips, fish tacos, and meatloaf (the best ever). All home made and outstanding! The beer was amazing and I can't forget to mention the bread pudding was also the best I have ever had!  We will definitely be making this place a regular stop."}
{"text":"I first read about Cornish pasties in Neil Gaiman's \"American Gods\" nearly 10 years ago. Shadow, the main character, described them as real stick-to-your-ribs food with an astonishing filling, \"a savory delight wrapped in hot pastry.\"   Every pasty I've ever had has been rather disappointing and never quite lived up to the expectations Gaiman set up for his readers.   But I've found it here!   For $10 and some change, you can get a delicious, flaky-crusted pasty with an amazing meat and carrot filling, mashed potatoes, and succulent peas, and it's WORTH EVERY PENNY.   And I enjoyed this long-sought meal with a can of Strongbow cider.   Without exaggeration, this was one of the greatest meals I've ever had. Proof positive that \"bar food\" can be top quality.  Furthermore, the place is cool. It's like the local hang-out where everyone seems to know each other and they welcome newcomers. I love it."}
{"text":"George & Dragon is definitely a cool place to hang out, have a drink and watch sports with your friends.    A few of us went here a couple weeks ago before an evening event.  We grabbed one of the large half circle booths near the windows.  A waitress came over, took our drink orders and told us about what was good. Now Ive heard the Fish & Chips was the best in town.  So after looking at the menu, my girlfriend and I both got that.  Im a huge fish & chips fan...  So I will try any and all of them. Plus being Friday, they are usually all-you-can-eat.    Our meals came out and I was ready to dig in.  It smelled delicious.  When I took a bite, I noticed that it was crunchier than i usually like.  Almost too crunchy. I asked for a couple sides of sauce to dip it in.  Seems I used up both sides pretty quickly.    Ok, the fish was good.. but it didnt blow my mind and it wasnt the best.  So far my favorite Fish & Chips is Fox & Hound over on Bell Rd & 83rd.  Still G&D is a great place! .. I will order something different next time."}
{"text":"Terrible place.   The manager us a horrible person and how the customers are treated-id never go there again ever"}
{"text":"We stepped into this restaurant and it looked like what I'd imagine an British pub would be. The menu offers several different beer, wine, and liquor options, from several different regions of the world. Food options are a mix of American, Irish, and British pub type foods.  We started with the medium hot wing drumettes as an appetizer. They were the right amount of heat level- not too hot, not too mild. The sauce itself was very vinegary and the meat tasted a little on the dry side.  As for entrees, I decided on the fish and chips, and tried some of the shepherd's pie. The fish and chips came as 2 sizable pieces of battered fillets, with a heap of fries. Although I ordered it with peas, it came with an extra side of coleslaw. The batter was excellent on the fish: A beautiful golden brown, and very crisp. The fish though, tasted dry. The coleslaw was crisp, but had no flavor.   Service was somewhat lackluster. Although our server would take away plates, he did not bother to check on our table to refill drinks (Sodas). Even when asked if we could get a refill he forgot to go to our table until we were done with our meal, and by that time it didn't matter to us if we had refills. In addition, it took a long time to get our check.  I wasn't too impressed with the fish and chips, but I did like the shepherd's pie better. The mashed potatoes, ground meat, and veggies meshed well together with the gravy.   While I wasn't very impressed with the fish and chips, I'd like to give George and Dragon another shot. Maybe another item on the menu will be better on the palate!"}
{"text":"I have visited George and Dragon a couple of times this year and one word that stand out for me is fun. This is a nice bar with a fun atmosphere. With that being said both times I have been here were for Trivia night (Thursday 9pm). The owner is a very funny guy and he runs the trivia process. The food is average and they do have a very cool cheese burger that has a ton of melted delicious cheese. The only reason this place did not get 4 stars from me is because the bathrooms look like something out of the movie Saw. My advice is: stay for the trivia and if you have to go, hold it."}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I participated in the Phoenix Actually' Great Phoenix Scavenger Hunt meeting up at the George & Dragon. The location was good - right on Central, close to light rail access. Parking was descent in the back. The bar was spacious with pool tables & darts in the entry room, plenty of seating in the dining around and around the bar. It was big enough to accomodate all of the scavengers as well as those patrons wondering what all of these other folks are doing.  Before the scavenger hunt started my friend ordered an Ace Apple Cider. I ordered one as well and it was very sweet. That drink would be dangerous because I could pound those all night not realizing it was alcohol.   We made it back to the George & Dragon a little early (8:30)...still 30 minutes left in the scavenger hunt, but the web site to upload pics to was slow, so we decided to enjoy some apps and drinks at the bar. The appetizers were typical bar food - we ordered the mozzerella sticks, potato skins and another round of Ace Apple Cider. Typical, but tasty. The cheese sticks were very cheese and the 'skins were good. The plate game with a few garnishes of vegetables as well.   The service was excellent too. We were going to order the shrimp, but the waitress indicated there really isn't that many, so perhaps another selection would be better. She was very prompt despite the large crowd. I left a good tips due to the attentiveness and advice.  I love pubs in general and would definitely go back any time."}
{"text":"This place gets a solid \"meh\". Not much in the way of atmosphere, and it feels vaguely dirty at all times. The drink selection is what you'd expect from a faux British pub. I did appreciate the projection screen of rugby that happened to be playing the night I was there, and the pours are reasonably strong. It would never been my first choice, but it's fine."}
{"text":"Great food every time, lots of lovely staff, a bit rough around the edges but if you want someone to wipe your mouth after each bite, don't go to an English pub.   Decor is warm and cozy, almost that if it's in the middle of London. Tons of seating, booths, tables, and bar seating available. They've even got a pool table for those with short attention spans while drinking. :)   The best thing about this place is, according to the Boyfriend, you can chat with locals or chill in a corner and enjoy the environment and not be bothered. Poker night on Wednesdays draws a bunch of old timer locals. Trivia night on Thursdays is apparently bustin at the seams, I'll be back to check that out too.   Drinks are rockin, food is excellent every time. What more could you ask for? It feels like home. Home sweet pub."}
{"text":"Will never go back again!  The service was horrible and the managers are mean. The food was terrible and they never have drink specials. The place was dirty not even worthy enough to be labeled a dive bar... Far worse for sure!!"}
{"text":"I first fell in love with George & Dragon during World Cup 2002. On the night Brazil defeated England, the patrons actually lifted the one man with a Brazil jersey into the air and carried him to the back door.  People often think G&D has overpriced drinks. It really doesn't. Last night, I bought $8 rounds of vodka tonic and Smithwick's pints. I don't know how the price was split, exactly, but $4 for either drink is decent.  Monday's No Country Karaoke isn't much different from your average karaoke night, but a few genuinely talented crooners do show up, and the wireless mike makes the whole pub a stage.  G&D's business has slowed because of light-rail construction on Central, but the fun factor still is there. I've never had a bad time. If singing and drinking isn't your thing, pool tables line one side of the pub. Also, a fenced outdoor patio allows smokers to have a puff while keeping their drinks in hand. Bravo."}
{"text":"Quilts. I like to come here and spend money on the shittiest beer in town. The outside spot by the street is my preferred spot. Good for pool darts and watching sports"}
{"text":"When I want to get my English on, this is the first place I think of!!! The owner of this pub is the funniest, sweetest bar owner I have ever met! Each time my girlfriends and I go here he is always greeting us and sits down and chats! My favorite night is trivia nights on Thursday evenings. It's always fun to test you and your friend's random knowledge. The best part is, everyone in the bar participates and everyone gets into it. Not only can you enjoy great food, delicious beers and fun people, the winners of trivia get free food and drinks! How does this not sound like a great place to visit?! Just an FYI this place gets crazy around soccer, I mean football season!!! Fun place to check out!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty decent bar. I first came here because I heard that it had been on bar rescue and I love that show. It is definitely still a dive bar but has a pretty cool atmosphere and seems to be pretty busy all the time. They have pool tables as well. I got shepherds pie the last time I was there and it was delicious! I would recommend checking it out but I wouldn't make this an every weekend spot."}
{"text":"Haven't been here enough but was a huge fan, friendly bartenders $3 domestics and a healthy amount of TVs. British themed pub with folks young and old. Great location next to Steele Indian park, visited after Lost Lake when I needed to forget Lil Yatchy's set"}
{"text":"Ever since G&D was on \"Bar Rescue,\" it has dramatically improved in all ways. No longer a dingy dive bar G&D, is now cleaner, more fun and ultimately a great place to hang out. There's an actual menu that surpassed that of deep friend bar food. Plus, the food is very good. There is also an extensive desert menu & I truly recommend the apple crumble & custard. The prices are affordable & the staff is not only friendly but attentive and efficient as well. YAY! G&D!!"}
{"text":"I came here more than once and always get a great service! I ordered chicken curry and it was bomb! I really recommended it. The flavor was perfect in my taste, it wasn't salty, and have a great spices that was not too strong on your nose.  The hummus was a plus.  The pasty had a great size with awesome and perfect flavors.   YES, I would love to comeback here just for a beer, poker, or awesome curry!"}
{"text":"If you can get the server to surrender a brunch menu during brunch hours (not a certainty) and if they're not out of half the stuff on the brunch menu (not a certainty), brunch is often downright excellent. The cook is gentle with eggs and makes an outstanding biscuit. Even the Southwestern breakfast burrito is really good, and that's hardly a native British dish.  Weekday lunch also weighs on the positive side, though again, you'll probably have to hogwrestle your server to get an actual lunch menu with the discounted burger (which is a good burger for $5-ish but not for higher prices).  Once you're into the main menu... I rotate among the English Dip, the roast beef dinner, and the fish 'n' chips, all of which are on the up side of decent. There is beer. There is a fruit crumble with custard that is excellent.  Service varies wildly. I've had excellent, prompt service at the right level of attentiveness. I've waited so long for a menu that I gave up and left. Today's adventures included the server forgetting to put my order in, then not checking on me for 40 minutes, at which point she was a tad snippy that I was seemingly lingering over my beer for so long. She acted like she was doing me a huge favor to actually put my order in when I pointed out that she hadn't -- which, I guess, given the spotty track record of service at this restaurant, maybe she was.  Bar Rescue replaced the tatty, comfortable booths with relatively uncomfortable tall bar tables (probably from some trendier restaurant that went belly up in the Great Recession), shortened the menu, raised the prices, and made no noticeable changes to the quality of the food or service."}
{"text":"Here's the deal with George & Dragon, you get exactly what you should expect... and perhaps a bit more. There's nothing like having a good, strong drink while watching Central Ave go by, hearing the random serenade of the light rail as it cruises through. The crowd is lively and animated. You can always find yourself in a solid conversation and the people are eclectic. Great music on the jukebox, too. The staff is solid. They remember your name and what you drink, they smile and are attentive and keep you quenched.  The owner is often seen laughing and joking with the patrons which I view as excellent form. Plus, he's a damn funny bastard. You may find yourself having a pint with him before ya know it! Now, the food... PHENOMENAL! Surprisingly good! Best bangers & mash in town (quality of the sausage is exemplary). Fish n' chips is superb. The stuffed meatloaf is legendary. LOVE the Cornish pastie. I would bathe in a tub of the chicken curry. It's ADDICTIVE! And the kitchen doesn't close until 1am! Haven't had a single disappointment and I've traversed the menu a few times over. All in all, I love this place."}
{"text":"What a great bar right off of the light rail.  The place has ample seating and a nice bar to cozy up to.  They had televisions with soccer, baseball and football when we were there on a Sunday afternoon.  The place wasn't busy at around 3:00 pm.  We sat in a comfy booth and had their wonderful sampler platter, which came with mozzarella sticks, onion rings, potato skins, chicken strips and fried zucchini.  It was so filling and super delicious.  We didn't have beer but they sure had a lot on the menu.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Well this is the English pub to go to in Phoenix.  With that said this city is without much culture so there's not much competition here.   I have to say this place is just ok.  Inside is outdated, but comes with the territory.  Beer selection is great, food is about average.   Service is a little below average.  I have been here at least a half dozen times and have yet to not have a struggle to get a drink order in.  And I have never been here on a Friday, Saturday, or a busy night for that matter.  I guess unless you are a regular the bartenders don't pay much attention to the rest of the customers.  Location sucks unless you are at an event at Steele Indian School Park or maybe doing a light rail pub crawl.  Too far away from Downtown and not close enough to Camelback(Midtown).  Not a must see, but if your eyeballs want to see something different I say go for it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Phoenix has only been improved by their recent remodel. Definitely a place to check out if you're needing a beer or a bite."}
{"text":"Being English, I love this restaurant. Great fish and chips, bangers and mash, shepherd's pie and of course sherry trifle dessert. Cool place to play darts and socialize and mingle. The staff is friendly and atmosphere great. Love their beer selection, I drink Newcastle the most."}
{"text":"One of my local favorite watering holes with a good selection of beverages and homey food"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today to G&D and it was GREAT! The service was really good and upbeat and the food was awesome!! I had the shepherds pie with cheese and gravy and we also got a fish and chips. They have a good beer selection on draft and the Carlsberg was definitely a good pick! Will absolutely be back soon. LOVE the decor too!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here every Thursday with friends for Trivia Night for probably a year and a half now. Even though I'm a regular, I've only had the food here a handful of times, so I can't really offer too much insight in that aspect. However, I can tell you that the experience you get at G&D is superb. From the time I first started coming up until now, I've had several different waitresses--all of whom are super friendly and provide great service. Our current waitress, Ashley, have already memorized our regular drink orders. I always get a hot tea with lots of extra lemons and some extra napkins, and she never fails to get all of that to me as soon as we are seated. Trivia nights are amazingly fun. Even though we're a group of young girls competing against 40 or 50-year old men who knows every obscure fact on the face of this planet, it's still great to test your knowledge and learn some random new information you might not have known before. For example, I now have it ingrained in my brain that \"Nights in White Satin\" is by The Moody Blues (as they've asked that question more than a couple times in past trivia nights...).  David, the owner of G&D is a great guy who's very personable. He comes around to each table and chats with different groups, and sometimes offers hints to questions if he doesn't consider you to be a \"wanker\" (a term he often uses to call out the really obnoxious customers). He also tells a couple of dirty or \"offensive\" jokes every Thursday, all in good fun!  One more thing...the bathroom toilet seat covers have the British flag on them! It's pretty cool. Also I heard that the women's bathroom in the back is haunted, but the scariest thing I've ever seen in there so far was only a cockroach, so I'm not sure how accurate that rumor is.  I love G&D because it's not at all pretentious. It's just a comfortable place where you can come hang out, relax, enjoy a few drinks with friends, chat and play games. It's got its little quirks, but that's what I love about it, and when I walk in I feel completely at home. :)"}
{"text":"Started here for an UYE (Harry Potter pub crawl).   This is a pretty typical British pub in America. Waitstaff missing the British accents (although I could just listen to the hubby's accent and pretend that I'm in England).  Fast, attentive service. Didn't eat anything from the menu, but it had a few possibilities. Might be back to try food at some point as the location was pretty convenient."}
{"text":"Came here while traveling through Phoenix a while back.  I got the pasty.  It came with some English sides.  I also used ketchup like a yooper.  Great dish.  Had the milk stout on tap.  Great choice."}
{"text":"This place has everything you look for!   The staff (bartenders, wait staff, management, and owner) gets to know you on a personal level. I've never seen a friendlier environment in any other place I've been, bar or restaurant!   My beer and drinks have always been cold, I've never had to wait longer than reasonable for my orders, not to mention the price you pay for a drink here is the best in town! They constantly have drink specials and shot specials that are very easy on the wallet, not so easy on the liver! :)  As for the food, they have recently revamped the menu and I have tried something new every time I order. I am happy to say I still have not been disappointed. They also offer salads, wraps, and other items for those looking for something a little on the lighter side!  And as for the environment, pool tables and darts are great ways to let the food settle and enjoy a drink or four. The juke box is connected to the internet so you don't have a limited selection of music, and the patio is a great place to enjoy the Arizona climate! If you're a karaoke singer, poker player, or just want to test your knowledge on trivia, they have something for you here too!!!  It doesn't matter how I spend my day, I can always tell you how it ends, at the George & Dragon!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to the George and Dragon for years and have never had a bad experience. The food is exactly what I want from a traditional English restaurant. Great fish and chips, lovely roasts on a Sunday smothered in delicious traditional gravy and many other classics. As a Brit  living in Phownix I couldn't be without the George and Dragon!"}
{"text":"First - and last - time here. Good selection of beers, and they're cold. Didn't dare try the food. Why?  The filth. Floor is a mess, bar is dirty and sticky, and even the plastic drink sign stands on the bar make you afraid to touch them. One beer. Gone. Not coming back until the health department --- oh, wait. If the health department comes, this place probably ceases to exist."}
{"text":"Most delicious Bloody Mary's!!!!  The food is good. Considering it's bar food, I still give it 4 stars!  Our waitress was polite and service was great!"}
{"text":"Fine establishment!  Authentic English pub, friendly with Americans.  Staff takes time to learn name and what you drink!  Friendliest staff in town, previous reviews unwarrented!  Never a bad experience!  Cheers!"}
{"text":"Been meaning to try this place for years and finally had an opportunity. Unfortunately it was a huge let down. The first bad sign was that upon walking in every table table that wasn't occupied had not been cleared from the previous diners. During the 1 1/2 hrs (!!!) that we were here there were several tables that NEVER got cleared. It took 20 minutes to get our drinks and another 45+ minutes until we received our food which was strange as no one else in the restaurant seemed to be ordering any food. There was a hair in the fish and chips (disgusting but mistakes happen), and the rest of the food was sub par at best.   Having lived half my life in England  I've been to plenty of pubs and also eaten plenty of mediocre pub food (none to my recollection as tasteless as this). However I would imagine that if you're trying to emulate a British Pub across the pond you would only want to bring over the best of the best, not the worst of the worst. Even the sad little mini frozen sausage rolls I had as a child were better. I'm a bit horrified that this is the \"taste of England\" that is being imposed on unsuspecting Arizonians who don't know any better.   I guess if you're just looking to knock back a pint or two and play pool and would only ever order food under the most drunk and dire of circumstances then you may enjoy this version of a pub. There certainly were a lot of regulars (not ordering food...).   P.S. I don't know if that greasy little man was a busser or a patron. If he was a patron he had no business going into the kitchen as many times as he did, or eating on the floor. If he was a busser then it would have been nice to see him clear more than one table he did. And I most certainly hope it was not his stringy long hair that we found in the fish and chips, although I wouldn't be surprised."}
{"text":"I have heard sooooooo much about this place and finally I had the occasion to go.  The place is actually pretty cool looking and not as dingy as I thought it would be. What I did not expect was the type of people there. It was quite a variety.. I expected it to be more on the alternative side.  Major dislikes would include not-so-clean bathrooms, and a fight broke out in the pool table area. I can't remember the last time I was around a barroom brawl.  The food is pretty good and really reasonably priced. They have a really good drink menu including a huge selection of rare beers. I got a chopped salad, but beware, it is not actually chopped...  The service left a little to be desired, but wasn't bad. There were only two waitresses for the whole bar on a Saturday, so that could have something to do with it.  Overall this place is pretty cool, great selection and really reasonable prices. I'll be back."}
{"text":"For reasons unknown, I have a bias against English food. So when the plates I saw coming out of the kitchen were a bit unappealing, I knew this place was authentic.   This place looks a bit old, but not trashy. When I ordered my Jameson and ginger ale, being asked if I'd like it in a pint glass made my day. This bar is awesome. There's a nice selection of beers for a reasonable $5 a pint. I had some Ace Pear, but there were tons of ales I'd never heard of to choose from. I'll be back for those.  There are plenty of activities to keep busy while getting trashed here. I've never seen so much room in a bar devoted to dartboards. It was right in the corner with ample throwing room, and I loved it! There are also a couple billiards tables, some light gun arcade game (Try it after a few--don't shoot the cows!) and even some patrons sitting at poker tables.   I'm definitely coming back here to play darts and watch rugby. Maybe I'll even try their fish and chips. I wonder though...do Brits really hang out here?"}
{"text":"The G&D captures most of what an English pub is all about - to a great enough extent that I have actually forgotten I am in Phoenix when in there on occasion.  There are some excellent beers on tap, including Abbott's Ale, IMO the best beer one can obtain in Phoenix.  The English Sunday Lunch is authentic and pretty good. I won't say excellent as I cook better, but for somewhere out it is more than good enough and on a par with pubs back home - and at a VERY reasonable price.  The Cornish pasties and Shepherd's Pie are 'ok', but not as seasoned as I like or cook - but a safer bet to appeal to the masses / American palettes...  Dave the owner is a very nice chap and always friendly and willing to talk to people when he is there as is his brother who is often found serving behind the bar.  All in all a very worthwhile place to snag a bite to eat and a pint - and play pool, darts or watch soccer on TV if they take your fancy."}
{"text":"The George is one of a kinda, well there is a second location, but so not even close.   I have been going to the George for years, always have a great time. Usually go to play poker on Tuesday, Wednesday or Saturdays. I have also taken part in their trivia nights on Thursdays too. They have great food, their wings and Sheppard's Pie are my faves! Tons of beers on tap. They even have this fun little game where you can \"Slay the Dragon.\" Where you have to drink at least one of every beer they have in the place, upwards of 50 I think. I know some people that have tried. I believe the record is 3 and half days to finish them all.   My friends and I dropped by the George the other night as one of our Holiday Bar Crawl stops along the light rail. They had a live band playing, who were pretty fun. We got drinks fast, the customers and staff we friendly and we had a great time. Such a great time we ended up staying a bit longer than we had planed."}
{"text":"This place was not bad. Their draft milk stout was delicious and we ordered chips that were quick and tasty. The bartender Jen? Is a sweetheart. Will return."}
{"text":"I've been popping into the George and Dragon nearly every Thursday since last April for trivia nights.  I like the place.  The trivia host is entertaining and the place feels worn in, but not worn down.  I feel comfortable and welcome every time I visit.  Most weeks I end up ordering a couple beers from the rather large selection.  The drink prices, while high for some people's tastes, are comparable to what I've seen in other places.  Imports are going to cost more, it's the price you pay to have a selection of Boddington's, Murphy's and Guinness all in one place, among other things.  Normally on trivia nights I don't end up getting food, as although I find their portions proportional to the prices, I don't feel I need to eat half my weight in fish and chips in one sitting.  I have no qualms with the quality on the few occasions I've grabbed some eats, for example the curry chicken is very flavorful and highly recommended.  The dragon wings are another of my favorite, spicy but not overwhelming.  The fish and chips, as previously mentioned, are served on a giant platter and have generally been excellent.  I recommend at least one visit to this bar.  Don't be scared off by the divey look of the pub-front.  The F.C. scarves adorning the ceiling, British booze advertisements on the walls, and the cozy but not claustrophobic seating arrangements make it a unique place in the middle of the desert.  If you do visit, pop in on a trivia night so you can listen to the host demean the guests with some clever snide remarks and give yourself an entertaining diversion for a night.  Who knows, you may become a regular before you know it."}
{"text":"Every time we've been people have been friendly.  There's a camaraderie.  A Cheers-esque feeling if you will. Important in any neighborhood bar.   I've sampled the fish and chips and Shepard's pie and have not been disappointed.  Service has been good, quick and efficient."}
{"text":"it's always gooooood times at G&D. I live in an apartment complex right down the street and it's always a plus to not have to worry about assigning a DD. They carry a very wide selection of beers on tap and they are actually pretty cheap. The appetizers are pretty good too.   I would definitely say the crowd is not really my scene, but once you throw a few back then you sort of forget the atmosphere.   The only thing I would criticize is the service. They usually have one or two waitresses working the whole pub and if you're not sitting at the bar, you have to wait a while for service."}
{"text":"This bar is not for everyone, and its location leaves much to be desired... however, I can't help but love this place. It's a little bit of a trek for me, so I don't go very often - however, I do try to go as much as I can.   When smoking was allowed, this place was difficult to breathe in. Now it's much nicer. The food is delicious I think, but I've had friends tell me they weren't so pleased... most people I talk to though seem to like it. There are booths that seat about 5 people. The seats are high and make it somewhat private. The bar is huge and they have waitstaff, so it's fairly easy to get a drink usually. It's also seldom crowded which is nice.   They host their own free poker nights with prizes... there's also pool, darts, and plenty of televisions to watch soccer on. G&D could use a bit of a facelift, but it's holding up well. The waitresses and bartenders are pretty hot and look like they could be suicide girls. There's usually someone good looking in there - but no pressure to be good looking or dressed up yourself. It's very casual. The place has a bit of a punky edge to it - most of the regulars seem to be into that. If that's \"your people\" then you should go check it out. If these aren't your people and you want to check it out - don't feel intimidated... everyone there is pretty nice. I should also mention that there's lots of beer on tap and the mixed drinks are usually really strong.  I'm realizing now that I need to come up with a formula for my reviews so they are more uniform and aren't so chaotic. Basically, G&D is a good place to go for a British Pub experience in the valley, but it's really more of a neighborhood bar full of regulars than a hot spot. Totally worth checking out though."}
{"text":"This is a very nice place to chill and hang out watch sports. They have full service bar and lots tables for large groups. I hear it gets crowded for sport games and on them weekend. Always friendly good service and casual environment to chat and talk."}
{"text":"I like the G&D.  The food is good, the waitresses are pretty, its a fun atmosphere. I always like the shepards pie but there are lots of tasty things about and some of them are hard to find outside of Britain. (Try the scotch egg if you feel adventurous)."}
{"text":"Where else would you go to get Corn Beef and Cabbage on St. Patricks Day.  Love it, music check, staff check, central location check.  What eles oh Guinness on tap, double check."}
{"text":"I had the best meatloaf here, that I have ever had in my entire live. It is layered with awesomely goodness. I like that it is a dark, out of the way spot. I will definitely head over there again."}
{"text":"Yummy food, cheap drinks, good service. Go there often. Only missing 1 star because occasionally we get a waitress who forgets to come back."}
{"text":"Went during lunch with the in-laws on their last day in Phoenix before heading back to England.  Great place to watch international soccer matches...they have several tv's with different games airing at the same time.  The food was fantastic, along with the ice cold Strongbow cider I had while watching the Liverpool match.  My MIL was raving about her sandwich saying it was \"lovely!\"  The owner of G&D came over and offered samples of his new bangers recipe, wanting the opinion of true English who would know what good bangers & mash should taste like.  My in-laws & fiancé loved every minute of it...lol!    Overall it was a great experience & thank you G&D for the awesome memory you gave my in-laws before heading back home.    Cheers!"}
{"text":"Back before the statewide smoking ban, George & Dragon used to really get me goolies in a twist. I mean, here's a place where I can watch soccer, get a good plate of fish & chips and choose from many good brews.   But I could't go there because I'm a normal air-breathing human. But now, it's 2007 and the smokers have been banished to the outdoors. Gooooooaaaaaaaaallllll! That means I can hang out at the George and watch quality soccer since I'm too cheap to spring for Gol TV at home. Plus I don't have a bartender firing off hysterical commentary at home.   The shepherd's pie isn't bad, either. But if you're in the mood for a Cornish pasty, go to The Cornish Pasty Company in Tempe. They don't play the soccer games, but you stand a good chance of hearing some Iron Maiden blaring over the speakers!  Back to the George, I think we've covered it all. Now just wait 'til that blasted construction is finished..."}
{"text":"We were looking for a casual place to go last night, after the game got let out.  Everything around the stadium was packed, so a friend recommended that we come here.  I was born in the U.K. (I've lived in the US for 29 years), so I'm always happy to go to an English pub for some grub!  I knew exactly what I'd get, because I always get chips & curry sauce whenever I go to an English pub, especially if it's the first time going to a new place.  I was really shocked to not see chip's & curry sauce on their menu but I saw that chip's came with several of their entrees, so I figured that I could get a side of chips.  Our server (American Gal) comes up to our table and I asked her, do you not serve chips & curry?  She said well I can do a side of chip's and a side of curry.  I asked her, do you have actual chip shop curry sauce...I got a very puzzled look from her.  The Mgr (American Guy) then comes to the table with a sample of their curry \"sauce\"...he brings me a sample of their actual Indian curry.  I said never mind, I was looking for chips & curry sauce.  He then proceeds to be extremely rude and starts telling me about how they're all different types of curry from all of the different regions of India and that the sample he brought me, is the curry that his cook (from India) makes.    I was really shocked that a Mgr of an English Pub literally had no idea what chip shop curry sauce is...I had to explain that there was nothing Indian about it!  I mean, it's like managing an American restaurant in another country and not knowing what ranch is.  In a very nice way I told him to look it up that night, just so he knew what I was talking about.  If I wouldn't have been beyond hungry, I would have left at that point as he had a horrible attitude.  I can't imagine that he's the owner and hopefully if the owner here is British, they can explain to their Mgr what curry sauce is!  From looking on Yelp, I see that there's an Irish place in Phoenix called Rosie McCaffreys and they have chips & curry sauce on their menu.  I've never been there to try it, but I'm guessing that this would be his chance to check it out and then maybe he'll feel bad (and silly) for how rude that he was to me.  Anyway, let's get past the curry sauce.  We ordered the fish & chips, the fish was good and the chips were \"proper\" chips, not fries.  It drives me crazy when restaurants list fish & chips on their menu, and they bring out fish & fries. The batter on the fish could be fluffier, but you still always get better fish & chips from a British Pub, than any high end restaurants that attempts to make it!  Our server was great and I'm glad that she brought out salt & vinegar before our food arrived.  The food was also piping hot, which every Brit appreciates!  The actual environment was not that nice but I can understand that as after all, it's a British Pub!  I was thinking that it needed a little bit of a remodel, so I'm surprised to read on Yelp about how they've just remodeled it.  The place has character though with lots of British flare, a menu with all of the main British entrees, lots of British beers & ciders and they even serve up a Sunday roast dinner.  They have lots of TV's, so this will be a great spot to watch the World Cup games next year.  They also have some events that take place in the week, with specials on their food.  If I take the rude Mgr out of last nights experience here, I'll give this place 3 stars.  It does need a bit of an upgrade, but the food was good, service was not bad (like a lot of the reviews say it is) and the place has character.  Seeing that I've just moved to AZ from CA, I'm happy to have found a British pub."}
{"text":"Terrible. Was kissing someone of the same sex in this establishment. We were not inappropriate at all and we were asked to get a room. This would not have happened to a heterosexual couple. WE WERE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST in this establishment. They also charged my debit card after I let them know I didn't want to pay for the two drinks and that we wished to leave. I have been in this establishment many times over the years. I was shocked by the owners actions against us. Please don't support a business like this. We have come to far to accept this bias."}
{"text":"Jonathan E.'s review is spot-on. I went here for a late lunch on a Sunday and couldn't resist ordering the lamb. I was expecting a hearty hunk of roast leg of lamb, as the menu mentioned the Sunday Roasts selection. Instead, the meat was merely thin-shaved slices of lamb (with plenty of fat to trim away) with gravy. The sides were o.k., but overall this dish was disappointing.  If I must eat here again, I'll order the fish and chips, although I was a bit dismayed to see that malt vinegar was not brought automatically to the table. And although we submitted three orders of fish and chips, our server brought back two and had to be reminded that we were expecting a third. This meant everybody ate while one poor sod in our group had to wait patiently for his order to be placed (again). Fortunately, we split a Scotch egg as an appetizer and that tided him over, but it was not much of a treat."}
{"text":"I am trying so hard to like this place but they are sabotaging themselves. I can't order from the bar. The server never comes, highlights of our conversation include how long we've been waiting for our check, and what low quality beer they serve. They have hp brown sauce and good mustard but the veggies are horrible and the wait time is horrendous. They have one server, one barista and one dude in the back in guessing is THE scallion. But where is the team work? They fight over the tip. The server refused to serve me because the barista had my card. She wouldn't even bring me my card. Thanks. Let me get up, go to the bar and wait. Awesome. Because why would I want to cone back to this. I shouldn't have to Google all the beer just to find something the slurp. The hostess didn't even know what the beers were. How can you work here every night and not know. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Most miserable worst experience ever. Looking forward to going here for weeks, big let down. Place was not busy when we arrived, asked for drink menu, and 45 mins later was told they don't have one. They also don't believe on checking back with tables, or beer & water refills. Was finally able to order and the Shepard pie consisted of store bought cold  mashed potatoes and cold bits of hamburger. When we got tired of waiting, we hunted down our server and got attitude from him. We told him about the pie he said he will have to pay for it if we don't. In the meantime, beer fest was getting out and the place completely filled up, there is no possible way that many  people are allowed in that size space. The manager wouldn't even assist when we asked for our tab. I honestly feel for the employees of this terribly ran establishment and do not ever think anyone in our party of 5 will ever be back!"}
{"text":"The drinks are so weak here that I had to order a vodka shot to put in my vodka martini and a whiskey shot to put in my whiskey sour. It tasted like water before. Any liquor drinks taste like watered down juice. And they aren't cheap drinks, so that's ridiculous. The food is good though."}
{"text":"Walked in during opening Olympic Ceremonies. The house was loud and packed, Channel 12 was doing interviews.   Ordered the Chimay Cinq CentsTrappist traditional Belgian beer from Cistercian monks that put into their work the same care for perfection that they do into their life of prayer and study. A true art of brewing. $14. This is a 750 ml bottle, poured into a shaker glass. This is a great price for the large bottle in a bar.  Fish and Chips, it only made sense to enjoy a dish that corrisponds with the Olympic Host Team. Have to say the food was on the money tonight. The kitchen probably served a hundred of these plates.  Had a great time."}
{"text":"Great English pub with great food, beer and atmosphere.  We have spent many a night here, even a few New Years Eves, which was a lot of fun. They have a great beer selection, their food, mostly traditional English fair is really good, some of the best fish and chips in town. The staff is courteous and friendly, as are the patrons. The place is decorated with a lot of wood, English football banners and scarves, TVs with football (soccer) playing and both tables and booths, other than the bar. There is a dining hall next to the main room, a few pool tables and jukebox and nightly events.  G&D is always a great time, one of the best places to meet up with friends for dinner and drinks."}
{"text":"Love the English pub atmosphere but had been here c. 2 yrs. ago and don't rem. being disappointed as my friend and I were this time. Had the lunchtime fish and chips which came with a little side of coleslaw. The chips seemed prepared from frozen, the slaw was gloppy with mayo and had no flavor but the thick mayo. The cod was excellent with a light batter, tender and moist, but the portion was too small. I was expecting something the size of a size of a usual piece of fish from Long John Silver's or the usual size when you buy frozen pieces at the supermarket. The Guinness is good esp. the interesting mixtures you can have like the Black and Tan or the ciders with beer, but prices should come down a bit esp. during the non-happy hours to make them a little happier. Some mood music would be nice too. It's great that it's on the light rail route."}
{"text":"Passed this place many times.   Was in the mood for fish and chips.   Could possibly be the worst fish I have ever tried to eat.   Could not take more than a couple of bites.  breading was separating from the frozen fish.   The fish itself tasted rancid.   Breading was boring at best.   I hope I don't get sick this evening.   Also, the service was very slow and my waitress was more interested with chatting to her friend.   The place could use a serious cleaning."}
{"text":"\"Fancy a shoe shine Governaaa?\"  (Governor for you non-British)  Authentic British style Pub...enough said. George & Dragon is fabulous! On the outside it looks mediocre at best, though the British feel is felt as soon as you walk in and see all the different Football Club Flags, Football Jerseys, (Soccer for you non-British) and UK country flags, and other miscellaneous pub paraphernalia. Inside, the place is warm and inviting, the tables have the Union Jack, English Cross, and London Underground Logos on them. The crescent shape booths are comfortable, and the bar has ample seating. This is place you go to with friends, or a date, and just spend hours talking over some pints.  The music is chosen by the patrons via a \"secret\" jukebox, so it can vary from Van Morrison, to Curtis Mayfield, to Outkast.  I went with my favorite pub \"friend', one that we can just talk for several hours and not really notice the time, so it made the experience that much more enjoyable. This is really a place you can just loose track of time and amount of pints consumed, as you expect to walk outside and hop on some form of public transportation and make your way back to your flat (apartment for you non-British). I guess the war zone that is Central Ave, will bring us a form of transportation in this area, but judging by the condition of this road, we have a bit of time to wait.  As I was waiting for my friend I chatted up a guy sitting outside about how I drove from The Roosevelt to G&D on Central Ave. He asked me \"what do you have a 4x4?\" and was serious. I said \"No I have a Golf, but it's German.\"  Moral of this story, avoid Central Ave. at all costs.   The one small downside, (bathroom issue) is the size of the bathrooms, they have just one toilet,  for men and one for women, which really is meant  for just one person at a time. In traditional European fashion,  I was \"doubled up on\".  As I went in to relieve myself, a dude just followed me in and was planning on using the above mentioned toilet, as I took the urinal.  I said \"Hey, you doubling up in here?\" He proceeded to respond \"Hey we are guys, it's cool\" This is the type of place that doubling up in the men's bathroom is OK, it just adds to th charm, hey you could triple up here, as they do have a sink as well. ;)"}
{"text":"Kind of a dive but it's always hopping.  Not my personal scene but drinks came fast and food was ok.  We had a huge bar hopping crowd and it's nice that it is so close to the light rail stop for a good time."}
{"text":"This was a neat little place. We tried it last night for the first time.  Nice choice of beers and a full bar. The service was a little slow, but the server did apologize for that. The food was fantastic!  Definitely worth checking this place out."}
{"text":"The place and food is amazing and the service is great, Heaven is a great server and so is the Dark haired girl. Management  is great.Do not bring Kids it is not a place for Kids at all."}
{"text":"I stopped by George and Dragon for lunch a couple of days ago. It was the first time I had been in the place for many years. Unfortunately, I was at work so I could not drink alcohol, but the food was great. I had fish and chips and my co-worker had bangers and mash. The fish was some of the best I've had, and the person with me enjoyed his food as well. The prices were decent, and the service was great.   Even though I was not drinking this time, I could not help but notice the excellent selection of draft beers. I really wish I was closer so I could have some booze at this place. Alas, I live in Ahwatukee.   For those of you who are closer and enjoy the pub atmosphere, George and Dragon is highly recommended, though I imagine the place is a zoo when there's a big soccer match. The last time I was here I was not impressed, and had not been back since. But this last visit was wonderful. Either something changed, or I just caught them on a bad day last time."}
{"text":"Three stars might not seem like a rave review, but since I'm not a huge beer drinker, don't go to bars to watch sports, and prefer ethnic food over food from the Mother Land, three stars from me means that G&D is doing something right.   My husband and I met my uncle and aunt for dinner here on Labor Day. I was surprised that they were even open, and it was definitely slow because pretty much every server was standing outside smoking when we arrived. Not that I'm judging because as a former server, I can tell you that there's nothing worse than working a shift on a holiday, especially when it's more of a grilling-and-having-people-over type of holiday.   Anyway, we sat in the bar area in one of the extraordinarily comfortable booths. The booth directly faced the bar and was much more inviting than the somewhat closed-off dining area on the right. To drink, I had a Bloody Mary. I was pleased that our server asked how spicy I wanted it (since that meant it would be made from scratch) and even more pleased when I tasted it and found it to be delicious. You could really taste all the individual ingredients, including the oft-neglected horseradish, and it really hit the spot after a long weekend of drinking. I also tried my aunt's Long Island, and it was really good and not too sweet.   My husband and I split the \"English Dip\" and the Philly cheese steak. Neither was particularly good. I think we both erred in not ordering British classics because my uncle's Shepherd Pie was at least hearty and sort of the quintessential comfort food. My aunt's fish and chips was also decent, although she said it wasn't nearly as good as Rosie McCaffey's.   I am definitely not opposed to coming back here, especially for No Country Karaoke on Monday nights (does that mean I can't sing Martina McBride?). However, when I do return, I'm going to stick to drinking (I'll gladly have another of those Bloody Marys) and then after a few drinks, try one of the British pub dishes. After all, it's after a few drinks that carb-heavy and filling pub food really serves its true purpose."}
{"text":"I've never not had a good time at George and Dragon. This place always has something fun going on whether it be karaoke, dart/pool tournaments, trivia, etc. The crowd is always a rambunctious and disorderly one, but that just makes it more fun. Eye candy is always abound here as well. I've never seen so many freshly 21 year.... wait this is a family friendly site.  Drinks here are not any more expensive than other brit/irish pubs, but I always do like to order two at a time because it gets to be busy and waiting for a bartender or cocktail waitress can take a few minutes. They have three dart boards, one real and two electronic, as well as two pool tables and a couple arcade games. There is also an electronic jukebox that seems to have every song known to man.  After 10+ visits I've never had any food here, so I cannot comment on that, but who eats at a place like this anyway? It's a funbar!"}
{"text":"Been watching a lot of the World Cup here and it's the perfect atmosphere. Good food, good drinks, and good people."}
{"text":"We've been out in Phoenix for a year now and since we live on Central, I pass the George & Dragon all the time.  I've noticed there are always people out front on the porch (so it seems petty popular.)  My 90 year old grandma was visiting around Christmas and we stopped in for lunch one day.  This was intentional since she is from England and I wanted to take her to an \"authentic British pub\" to see what she thought.  She absolutely loved the fish and chips and I had the BLT which was awesome - curly bacon is the best!  We both enjoyed it a lot and Gram said the decor reminded her of the pubs in England.  A few days later we decided to go back for the roast dinner on Sunday and everything was great.  The server was very nice and attentive, everyone enjoyed their meals.  I would also recommend George & Dragon to watch sports as they have a huge screen (and several other TVs) to watch the game on.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This place has gotten under my skin.  I have been going there since shortly after they opened back in 1995 or so. It's been a landmark to me through much of my adult life. I've met the owner a few times and he's very personable.  So how is it? It's good. It's a pub that's nicely dark inside. The bar is comfortable, and they have British beer on tap--stuff like Boddington's.   The food is tasty and reliable. Stick with the specialties--the shepherd's pie, bangers and mash, cornish pasties, roast beef.  I've never found a reason to complain about the service.  There's a community built up around it, and you can occasionally meet real, live, BRITISH PEOPLE there! Imagine that!  So, a favorite of mine."}
{"text":"The food here was amazing! I had the Shepherds Pie and could barely finish it. The drinks and the service were spot on! Cannot wait to come back"}
{"text":"I really want to give this local gem a chance but I was not too pleased with my last experience.  Some friends and I had planned to attend the Beerfest in Phoenix.  The rain drove us to wait it out at George & Dragon's.  Unfortunately the staff were not prepared for the amount of customers that would hid from the rain that day.  As I could see there was one bartender and one waitress.  We couldn't get a drink or even order food.  After patiently waiting for 20 minutes we left this establishment and headed to another local pub.  I've heard so many great things about this place but this day I left very disappointed."}
{"text":"Lovely authentic British Pub as it should be.Never miss a chance to go.God save the Queen and Cheers, here's to you all.Love all the food."}
{"text":"The quintessential English pub of Phoenix. The staff is always attentive and providing great banter along the way. The shepherd's pie is unbeatable and truly a meal for 2. If you're a soccer fan this is the place for all big international and club games, the morning matches are always the best! Cheers."}
{"text":"Huge wings!  Delish!  Great beer selection. Good environment. If you are reading this you've probably already been there so this is nothing new."}
{"text":"All to cock! It's been close to 10 years since I was here last and I remembered seeing that the establishment was on bar rescue in recent years. I can tell you that in the 30 minutes I was there last week I have not a clue what it was that bar rescue did for this place! Immediately upon walking in the door there is a very large framed menu on the wall with various signature cocktails one of which has gin and blueberries in it. It sounded very interesting! We made our way to the bar and service was very slow and the folks on either side of us were sitting there with empty drinks that they kept nudging closer and closer to the edge of the bar hoping to get someone's attention. When we were finally greeted I asked for the gin and blueberry drink and she told me that was a \"bar rescue drink\" and they no longer made it... So I politely responded that maybe they should take no longer available drinks off their oversized menu board everyone sees when you walk in the door. Anyway,  it was a very ordinary visit we ended up just having two cocktails on the patio and left. We did not want to lean our backs against anything outside as the place looked like it has been needing a power wash for the last 20 years. And finally here are some photos of the bathroom which not only was it grimy and gross but there was absolutely no air conditioning or circulation in there and it had to have been over 110°. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of one is because when we finally did get the bartender's attention she was apologetic and friendly and I thought the cocktails were reasonably priced for our call liquor."}
{"text":"Wings are very good...the veg accompanying was garden fresh amd crisp; a welcome and pleasant surprise compared to most bars that offer limp, week old stuff. Rea is a fantastic and friendly bartender that suggested the right beverages and totally took care of us on our first, but definitely not last, visit on the Metro light rail trail..."}
{"text":"We went here at the start of the Harry Potter pub crawl so all I can only comment on is the fast and attentive waitress who was able to get all our drinks to us quickly and correctly and the great beer. The pub has a good variety of draft beers. The food looks good but I didn't eat any this time. Next time, when I have a craving for a scotch egg I'll be here in a heart beat."}
{"text":"A bit disappointed. Sunday noon, about 12 patrons. Interior was a bit dark. No one seemed to be in a hurry to wait on customers. Beer was chilled, not cold. Took about 20 minutes to get potato skins after we placed our order. When I complained about the flies around the food, the response was \"You should see them around the bar!\"  Pretty much sums up the attitude of this establishment."}
{"text":"George & Dragon is an English pub / dive bar next to Clever Koi. I wouldn't recommend this bar to everyone, you have to be in a dive-y mood to go, but the bartenders are always nice and it's a laidback ambience with an English theme. My go to here is Boddington's on tap, fish and chips, and a pasty. The fish and chips are on point, huge portions and fat fries, and the pasty is like biting into a calzone version of a Shepard's pie. And Boddington's? It's a smooth beer found in the UK and I adore it. It's the only place I know of in the Valley where you can find it on tap!"}
{"text":"Come every time I visit from England good little bar that gives it a good go. Great atmosphere plenty of drinks on tap and friendly staff, good it good and big portions . Love it"}
{"text":"all hail the brits, summer hours and day drinking benders with my brother. oi, oi, oi!  my brother joey calls me up one day: \"hey, can you drive me downtown tomorrow?\"  me: \"why?\"  joey: \"i have school down there in the afternoon, but i was invited to go bar hopping after class tomorrow night with some friends. i don't want leave my car out there overnight if i'm going to be drinking.\"  me: \"well, my company lets us have summer hours on fridays, so i'm done with work at noon. when's your class?\"  joey: \"not til 6pm... but we can go earlier and grab beers or lunch first at this british pub near my school.\"  me: \"done. pick you up at 1:30pm.\" click.  now this was in early august, so it was blazing hot that day. i pull into the george & dragon parking lot a bit dismayed there was no covered parking. oh sweaty joy.  the good news is, it's nice and cool inside and strangely crowded for a work day.  we find seats right up at the bar. i notice the girls working there all have this suicide girl thing going on and the one guy we see working there (who appeared to be the manager?) has this MASSIVE pompadour thing going on with his hair. it was larger than life... like that thing you try not to stare at, but can't help it. in my peripheral vision, i could see my brother look over at me. i knew exactly what he was thinking and i smirk. then mr. pompadour-manager guy comes right over to us and asks if we would like menus. my brother smiles and nods a yes at him, fighting back laughter.   while we're pouring over the menu's we order some pints. i decided that i fancied a kiltlifter while my brother orders the fuller esb. i try a sip of his, and crikey it's good. they're extra cold too and go down smooth. i end up ordering the fish & chips with the cole slaw and my brother opts for the sheperd's pie.   my brother, never one for being a wimpy little nancy boy decides to order a shot of whiskey with this next round. i get the boddingtons this time, he gets the harp.   me: \"um, don't you have class? won't you be knackered by the time 6pm rolls around if you do a shot of whiskey?\"  joey: \"nah, i'll be fine. we just have a quick test and then we can leave. i'll ace it.\"  me: \"well, cheers to that then.\"  *i raise my glass, clink*  finally our food comes...... and i only have 2 words for the perfectly golden crispiness of the fish and chips i had for lunch: DAMN GOOD.  we finished off our grub just as this cheeky lady and her husband sit down next to us. we chat them up over more pints (i have water, because i'm driving) until 6pm rolls around. i visit the bathroom upon our departure and am happy to report while initially it looks a bit dodgy, it's actually quite clean. we wave goodbye to mr pompadour-manager and we're off.  i found out later my brother got an A on that test. HA. figures.  good show george & dragon, all hail the queen! cheerio."}
{"text":"I went here on a Friday night for dinner.  It was kinda busy but not so much that it was too loud and oppressive.    We ordered the cornish pasty and the fish and chips for dinner.  The cornish pasty was by far my favorite dish.  If I had only that for dinner I would have given 4 stars.  The fish and chips though were too thickly breaded.  It really over powered the fish, and wasn't even cooked long enough to make the breading crisp.  It was just too heavy.  I wish the breading was thinner and crisper.  This is why I rated only a three.  It makes me wonder about the rest of the dishes.  Maybe I'll get another chance to eat here again."}
{"text":"I love the food here. So much. All of it. However the service has always been shitty and seems like it always will be. Even after their show on bar rescue. I just come here for the food. Not for over priced drinks or crap customer service.   Ok on a Sunday afternoon, 2 servers, 2 bartenders, 3 tables and a couple people at the bar. We were waiting anywhere from 5-10 minutes per drink. They were all just talking to each other and kept disappearing. Like seriously? This is why this place almost went out of business.   Thank goodness their cooks know how to work!"}
{"text":"The food is your typical bar nonesense, but it's cheap and the atmosphere is good.  Easy parking, close, good happy hour.  Come for Thursday trivia night if you want to meet people."}
{"text":"Thanks to light rail, G&D is now within drinking distance of my house so we decided to try it.  Went for lunch on a Sunday and it was a different feel than what obviously goes on in the evenings.  The music was quiet.  The Cardinals game was on the TV.  The crowd was tame and the setting was peaceful.  Ordered the Bangers and Mash.  It was good but the mash was dry without the gravy and they added peas to the plate which it didn't need.  The sausage was great though.  Guinness on tap so that's a plus.  Would go back but not during a night time crush.  Maybe when MLS season starts up."}
{"text":"I love the Pub! I don't get there very often any more but I wish I could! Trivia Night (Thursdays) is a blast! They have a Great Beer Selection, Fantastic Drink Prices, and it is always a Good time!"}
{"text":"Went last night for the USA vs. Honduras soccer match.  At first the feed wasn't working but after most people left I stuck around and got a front row seat and then the feed came on.  Was a great game and great environment all cheering for the Yanks except two behind me from Honduras.    I ate the potato skins which were pretty good and had some great 4 Peaks Kiltlifter beer.  Cheap tab and a USA win good way to spend a Saturday night."}
{"text":"This is my kinda place.   Nice casual place with good food and good beer.  Not to mention it is walking distance from the Central/Indian School lightrail station.  I stopped in here on a whim while spending a Saturday on the lightrail ( I made good use of my day pass).  I had also read at one time this pub served Scotch Eggs, mmmm.   As it was dinner time-ish I ordered up a Smithwicks and some Scotch Eggs.  Now I have had these served a variety of ways in the past and my preference is lightly breaded yet crisp crust with a relatively thick layer of sausage, served room temp to slightly warm.   Here they are served cold and quartered.  These were also some of the largest Scotch eggs I have had.  I got over the fact they were as cold as they were and begin to enjoy the flavor of the sausage layer with a hint of nutmeg.  The balsamic \"chutney\" served  with them was great, in the past at other places I usually enjoy a course deli mustard. What I didn't like about these Scotch eggs was the breaded layer.  Becasue they are premade fried and stored in the fridge the breaded layer was like a rubber mat.  I peeled off this layer and continued to enjoy my meal."}
{"text":"LOVE this spot. Just as good as it gets. Try this place, and you'll thank me later. :-)  I would definitely come here again when I am in the area."}
{"text":"We always stop here when we have time before an event downtown. Good beers, good food, great atmosphere and OK prices.  I will always be a fan of this place just for the atmosphere alone. It always reminds me of all the fun I had while being stationed over in Europe.  After reading other reviewers, now I can't wait to go again just to try the fish and chips."}
{"text":"I have always had a wonderful time at the George and Dragon and always bring my friends and family here when they visit. The staff is very friendly and courteous and the food is wonderful. I especially enjoy the shepherds pie and the BLT. I love this place!!!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed a fun night with friends. Best fish n chips! We had a party of at least 13 and the waitress was amazing."}
{"text":"Best chicken tenders you'll ever have!!  Somewhat of a hole in the wall bar but located on central."}
{"text":"The problem with places that serve a lot of fried fish is that, well, they smell like fish.  The smell hits your nose pretty hard when you come in.  The building is old, a bit run down.  I think if you are looking for a genuine British pub, this may be a good place, but I wasn't a fan.  Service was \"okay.\"  Food was actually pretty decent- bar pretzel and hummus were really good.  Overall just not my scene though.  This could be a good canidate for Bar Rescue."}
{"text":"The BF took me here last night, as it used to be a hang out for him when he was younger. It was a pretty fun time. The place is not real 'hip' I would say, but everyone seemed to be having fun. They had tvs playing the basketball game and the place was pretty busy at around 8:30 when we went there. We ordered a couple beers (I got a Hef and he got a black velvet I think.... cider and Guinness) and we ordered a shepherd's pie and some fries. The beers were good and the food was really tasty. It was exactly what I wanted but didn't know I wanted. The shepherd's pie is really mashed potato -y and the meat is really tasty.... very flavorful. The pie is huge too so I wouldn't think twice about sharing it. After that he got a jameson and ginger ale and I got a couple shots- a buttery nipple (the best shot) and an orgasm shot (ok... not as good as the other). The BF's drink was huge... like a pint of whiskey. Anyway, the night was good, I like the atmosphere (they also have pool and darts and all kinds of stuff to do) and the drinks were nice too, our total was around 50$ after tip so not too bad for the amount of stuff we got. I would definitely go back in the future."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was pretty good for a pub, but the food was \"meh.\"  For an English pub the fish and chips were average at best. The service was very poor because they were too busy and had little staff. The waitress was overwhelmed, but was courteous and pleasant. Even though she was nice, we did not have our drinks refilled and were forgotten about for long periods of time.  The manager was very unaware of things that had to get done it seemed as he was busy moving tables, but not helping the wait staff fill drinks and assist with customers."}
{"text":"Love the new changes and look however the service was poor. Very disappointed. Could be better"}
{"text":"Great English pub in the middle of Phoenix.  The fish and chips meal is delicious.  Also, they serve great Black and Tans.  Sometimes the service can be a bit slow, but overall, I recommend George and Dragon."}
{"text":"Always a good time. Stopped by here Saturday night to have a couple drinks before bar hopping in Phoenix!  Friendly staff, quick service, great time!"}
{"text":"A perfect place to enjoy a cold pint with friends in a cozy pub without an over the top cheezy ye-olde-England theme. I love the fact that they serve *several* different types of hard cider and $3.00 Jägerbombs all the time. Our waitress was super nice and I'll be back sometime for the food."}
{"text":"4240. Easy address to find. Plenty of parking in the rear. Street-facing patio for those who want to poke their heads outside, or for those who need their nic fix.   No noticeable \"Entrance,\" though the \"Exit\" Is marked (I guess that's the more important sign to have up, anyway, in case the party inside gets too fun.)  (NOTE: \"Main Entrance\" is on the south side of the building. Once you walk in, the bathrooms are on your left - pool tables on your right. So much safer than walking into a game of darts!)  We walked in through the Exit... and just about took a dart to the temple. Quick, duck!   There were patrons playing darts, chattin' at tables, standing at the bar... It was filled without being packed. Open seats at the bar beckoned to us, so who were we to ignore the call? I took my seat and ordered a Guinness. Service was fast and attentive. My 2nd round came right as I finished my first.   This place is cool, although on the night I went (my first night, for the record) I noticed there was plenty of men, but only a few females. This bodes well if you're looking to get hit on, I thought... Of course, what happens when I just want to chill out with a drink? Guess we'll see next time.   In any case, with my friend in tow and conversation free flowing, I had a great time. Bonus - this place is within stumbling distance from my new abode. Nice!   So, naturally, the night I'm saddled up to the bar and enjoying my Irish beer and the happy buzz that it gives me, I notice something peculiar. Never mind the mix of people -- from artistic smarts to tat canvases to baseball fans. Instead, I noticed the female bartenders cleaning up the bar with aggressive impatience... almost like slapping their rags on the bar top was the clear call to clear out. What time was it? I checked my phone. 12:18, precisely. Even bars in Oklahoma stay open later than that. I looked at my comrade in puzzlement. What gives?   I guess we were being told that closing was coming soon, and our patronage with on a deadline. Well then. I savored the last gulps of my Guinness and we left... long before last call, I'm certain of it. But I didn't want to stick around to find out.   4 stars - based on a first experience. I say that's pretty damn good. I'll definitely be back. (NOTE: I went back...the next night! And I had just as great - if not a better - time at G&D. Bonus! I heard real British accents!)"}
{"text":"I love GnD! The owner is so great, he's hysterical, full of stories, and charming. Monday nights are karaoke. Watch out, people take it very seriously. My girl and I laughed our way through Sir Mix A Lot, only to have a world class karaoke-r go after us and put us to shame. Thursday is trivia, come early as it gets PACKED. Happy hour is from 4-7, $1 off all drinks, making a Jameson $4.95, hell ya. The bartenders are all friendly, make a strong drink, and are attentive. There's also a jukebox for you to pick your poison, darts, and pool tables.   Some of the best fish and chips around. The potato skins are a god send after drinking for 3 hours straight. Everyone who comes here seems to be a regular, gives off a legit English pub vibe."}
{"text":"Surely a 3.5 star restaurant. Very divey. The waitress was very friendly and helpful. She gave us a little low down on the stories behind the restaurant and it is always nice to hear about family run businesses. Anyway, the booth we sat in has seen (MUCH) better days but I didnt really mind it because it went with the divey feel. Beers are pretty cheap.  Between the 3 of us we ordered the sheapards pie, fish and chips and i forgot what the third was called but it was a roast beef and swiss sandwich with dip. The sheapards pie was by far the best thing on the table with the fish part of the fish and chips next. The corn that came with the fish and chips were literally straight out of a can or frozen bag and the fried were pretty bland as well. They were playing a weird mix of country and justin beiber music that just wasnt doing it for me. All together, pretty solid dive bar if they cahnge up the music and season the fries/veggies a bit more."}
{"text":"George & Dragon! After driving by you for months, I finally decided to stop in. Very nice!  Well, pretty nice. Maybe just nice. The four star rating is very weak, but I decided to bump up from 3 to 4 because we had a good time. I like that this place is low key and not pretentious. I like that on Sundays, they play different football games rather than just focusing on the Cardinals. And I like that they host different things, like live music and trivia nights.  The food is very bland. However, it's a bar, so expecting the meal of your life is a little silly. It isn't greasy, bad bar food; it's average and a little overpriced. I would stick to a simple appetizer and some drinks in the future.  Fish and chips were OK - the corn was definitely frozen, and I think the fish may have been as well. Burger was very simple and bland. I did like the thick cut fries, but they were probably frozen as well. Portions were pretty good, which is a plus.  The service was OK. A little lackluster - our server seemed a bit frazzled, and she was the only one working the dining room. There were several tables that hadn't been cleared of the dirty dishes after the customers had left, so seating was limited based on that. The restaurant isn't dirty, but it isn't immaculate, either.  I can definitely see why people wouldn't like this place, but for me, it's close to home, and it's a good place to relax without being around a huge crowd. If you stop in, don't expect too much, and you'll (hopefully) be pleasantly surprised like my husband and I were."}
{"text":"When in Central Phoenix, this is always one of my favorite places to go.  It's quite the funky English Pub, and a great place to watch European soccer matches.  They have a HUGE selection of beers from all over the world, and pretty decent food (not great, not horrible, just decent) on the menu.  I like this place because the people who come here have this \"I am who I am and this is how I'm going to be\" attitude.  There is not one \"type\" of person that comes here, which makes it great in my mind.  They have pool tables, darts, and a good juke box too.  I cannot remember at time where I have had bad service here too, and the staff is totally funky and fits the vibe of the place.  One should not expect the world if they come here, but for just an all around good time, the G&D is for you.  The best English Pub in the valley in my mind."}
{"text":"Great server. Great fish and chips, Cooked just right. Onion rings were also delicious."}
{"text":"A fun, laid-back bar where everything is worn, well loved, and comfortable.  The food is delicious and reasonably priced.  Went for lunch today.  Navigating the construction traffic was difficult, but worth it.  I ordered the Shepherds Pie (delicious comfort food!) and my friend ordered the fish and chips (likewise tasty!).  Massive beer selection, friendly waitresses, great atmosphere - definitely worth a try and I hope to get back again soon."}
{"text":"Fun place to get drinks.  Lots of career drinkers frequent the place and their selection of beer is great- they even carry Chimay blue and red!   Jukebox is pretty solid."}
{"text":"I like this place.I'm comfortable here. I don't drink and don't watch sports so unfortunately there's not much of a reason for me to go,but the few times I've been with friends have been very enjoyable. I did play trivia one night and cheated off some other player's smartphone. I like the fact that real people go and are just plain social. Haven't tried the food yet. Oh,I stopped in last night for a bit with a friend and we had the blonde server who was genuinely nice to us.I wish I had better recall,but I think she said her name was Valerie when she came to the table as we arrived. On the few occasions I've been here,have always been treated well even though all I'm drinking is Pepsi... Some bars look down on that as they consider it \"deadheading\" and taking up space...They make their money on alcohol,so they make nothing on me... Treated very well here every time none the less."}
{"text":"Great shepherd's pie. Fish and chips were good. Lot's of beer selections.  Owner is an obnoxious Brit, but in a good way."}
{"text":"Have been to this place twice and the experience was the same. I personally don't get what draws people to this place. It's got a bit of a negative vibe. The staff is not friendly or service oriented and it's dirty. Great location for a light rail pub crawl - I think it just might not be our crowd."}
{"text":"Laura our server was amazing. I loved the Indian chicken curry Laura suggested it and ive been to alot of Thi restaurant and this place knocked it out of the park. thank you Laura we will be back because of your customer service."}
{"text":"Riding the light rail daily to work has changed how I go about my commute home. It was by the grace of a good friend that I stopped off for a happy hour special at a Midtown drinkery. That's all it took to get me hooked on the idea of stopping off for a drink after a hard day's work. And the proximity of George & Dragon to the light rail launched what is my current obsession.  With good intentions, I stopped at G&D yesterday for an Irish Car Bomb and a Guinness, and to get some food to take home and watch a movie. At 5:15 there was hardly anybody there, but I suppose most people are commuting at that time. I overheard another patron ask about their \"Slay The Dragon\" program. Participants, it so happens, are given a card with all of the restaurant's beer listed. The steady drinker consumes one of each (there are 66 different beers!!) within a month and is awarded with an \"I Slayed the Dragon\" t-shirt. What a sweet concept! ***  The steak and kidney pie was also a nice treat, with that certain crispness of the kidney strong but not overpowering. In the past, I've also gotten the fish and chips (FanTasTic!), bangers and mash (excellent) and the wings (very good).    *** I think it would be swell if we organized a daily UYE to help each other through this beer challenge. Even if it's only done during happy hour (4-7) after work,  that's only 3-4 beers a day."}
{"text":"It might be a little dingy.  It might be a little stuffy.  But the G&D will always have a place in my heart.  I've been coming to the G&D since I could legally drink.  Back then, sassy British servers cracked jokes with us regulars.  The shepherd's pie is delicious and can be shared between two people, easily.  It comes with a popover, which you'd better keep your hands off.  Mine, mine, mine.  Due to this being \"our place,\" the hubs and I even had our wedding rehearsal dinner here in 2001.  I know, that sounds ridiculous.  But we were young, could care less about what our families thought about our venue choice and we wanted Shepherd's Pie.    Now this place is more Hubs' style than mine.  He's happier in dive bars than most.  But I do still get a hankering for their shepherd's pie, even if mine tastes just as good or better by now.  Love you, G & D.  Will visit again soon, Hubs in tow."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try this place after I heard their weird radio commercials a few years back.  It always cracked me up whenever the guy talked about the bangers and mash.  We finally stopped by one day after a lovely little trip on the lightrail.  The entrance is a little confusing being on the south side of the building.  I guess this is because I am used to entrances being in the fronts of buildings as opposed to on the side.  When you walk in, you see everything you expect.  A couple pool tables, dingy floors, a seedy looking bar, and tables and chairs scattered about.  There are a decent amount of booths as well.  One thing that I noticed and considered a bit odd was the fact that a third of the restaurant seemed to be sort of partitioned off for the \"fancy\" dining area.  I don't know if that is the case, but it definitely looked that way.  When it comes down to it, this place is a classically tacky pub type restaurant, and I like it.  Unfortunately, the food is not so great.  Neither is the bitchy service you get when you come in.  A half smile would be a welcome gesture instead of a perfect view of my server skulking in the kitchen.  I'm not sure what was up with that.  Maybe PMS.  The husband ordered the bangers and mash and I got the cornish pastie.  The husband mentioned that he had to add a lot of salt to his gravy, but he seemed to enjoy his meal.  Me on the other hand, not so much.  My gigantic pile of peas that kept rolling of my plate were cold and had a few hairs in them.  They definitely weren't mine, I checked.  The pastie was delicious, and I really liked it, but the accompanying mashed potatoes were too thick and lumpy to be any good.  This place just isn't good enough.  Hair in food is just plain gross.  Mediocre food combined with rude service is not going to get me to come back.  Besides, I am sick and tired of hearing the owner of this place bitch and moan about the lightrail being a detriment to his business.  I don't know how you can say that when the place is packed on a Sunday afternoon with no sporting events going on."}
{"text":"I've been going here for years. See in 1999 I went to the UK on my first trip across the pond, came back missed it, and was invited to G&D. This place reminded me of what it was like in England and I loved it. The first couple of years my problem with going was the smoke but after Phoenix (& AZ) went smokefree the restaurant cleaned up quickly.   The left side is all pool tables and darts. My best friend and I spent many nights with a beer and a game of darts here. The right side is a restaurant section where you can sit down to have a great dinner. This section is large enough to easily accommodate a group dinner as we did often.  The beers here are great and the variety is exceptional. For the food, I always get the same exact thing. Shepherd Pie is my favorite, and I have seriously never had better (even in the UK). It's perfect with cheese & HP sauce. You just can't get any better than George & Dragon on Central."}
