{"text":"Cheese tarts are kinda special, worth a try. Cakes are too sweet for my taste, and overpriced."}
{"text":"3.5/5 was super excited to hear they opened one in markham so I had to try it out! First off, the prices are quite steep. I tried the matcha crepe (7.75 before tax) and I honestly thought it wasn't that good...kinda felt like the cake didn't have enough crepe texture because the whole thing just tasted like eating cream. However, I will say it had a very strong matcha flavour and was not too sweet."}
{"text":"I love their gelato. The Thai ice tea one is my favourite. Their crepe cakes are also super good, especially the earl grey flavour"}
{"text":"**I just HAD to update. Their crepes are still delicious but their service is gut wrenching painful***  I came back THE NEXT DAY after my first review only to feel like I hit a brick wall. There were 5 people on staff behind the counter, FIVE okay! One customer ahead of me who ordered 2 cups of tea, one crepe cake to go and one for eating in house. I ordered 3 cakes to go. It took nearly 10 MINUTES for ONE server to pack my take away while the other 2 servers in the back were roasting nuts (a tiny pan in a toaster oven people), 1 at cash doing nothing (no other people in line) and the manager doing stuff at the back. The girl who packed THE PREPACKAGED READY TO GO CAKES moved at a snails pace! She was confused by the short list of 2 orders AND she didn't understand how to assemble my take away box properly! Instead of tucking in the sides to fit nicely, she saw it as a puzzle and taped the flaps on the outside making the last flap crooked to fit in the box so she just tapes it semi shut! I'll come back because the crepes are good but I can't even imagine if they had rushes of customers; they would crumble.  ***first review*** The uptown cafe proves it stays true to its name. If you haven't experienced a crepe cake from their original downtown locations you can expect light, creamy, melts in your mouth texture from your purchase.   Compared to their Kensington location, they have the original 2 flavours plus 2 more and a seasonal special. The earl grey cake was fantastic. Was very fragrant but not overwhelming with perfect crepe cake texture to match. The rainbow cake as we learned was a grand opening special; tasted so unique. Hard to describe because it's not vanilla bean flavour but reminiscent of it. It's sweet tasting like a hint of birthday cake flavour but not nearly as sweet as a cake version. Just wonderful if you have the opportunity to try!  We also ordered the Yuzu pudding. It was okay. It had great Yuzu flavour and fluffy texture but it left a slight eggy aftertaste. For nearly $5 I prefer shilling out another 2 to grab another slice of crepe cake instead.  The ladies were very helpful. They described that all their pastries come from the main bakery on King St. and are delivered everyday. That could explain why they run out of stock quickly due to unexpected amounts of customers. Overall a charming visit and I'm glad I have a Millie's so close to home."}
{"text":"There's nothing bad about this place, the cafe is absolutely stunning. The crepe cakes are so good, they're just a little expensive for such few delicious bites but walking in there, you wouldn't expect a cheap dessert place anyway. They're around $8 for a slice of crepe cake that will last you only a few bites but it is worth trying at least once. I loved the matcha one, I wasn't such a big fan of the tiramisu though. Their gelato is also good and they let you try the flavours out but it's just gelato."}
{"text":"After many times of visiting I finally get to try their Earl Grey and also they have a new flavour (at least I think it's new)  Red Beans.  So far I like the Earl Grey flavor as it's not too sweet. The red beans one taste good as well and there is real red beans in it so that's good. I have never tried their drinks yet so maybe I'll do that next time"}
{"text":"This place is quite pretty inside. Not a lot of seating, only 4 tables available. Staff was friendly and helpful. I had the Tiramisu crepe cake. Cake seems fresh, with soft and fluffy thin layers. Flavour was pretty spot on and not too sweet as well. A bit expensive considering the slice is quite small. However, considering the efforts needed for a homemade crepe cake, I would spend the money and try another one of their flavours next time."}
{"text":"Overall - 4.0/5.0  Following the footsteps of Uncle Tetsu and Touhenboku Cafe, Millie Cafe finally opens up shop in Markham. Right now they are still in the soft opening phase and will officially open on 12/10.  Quite a selection of items available from their usual cakes and cookies, to coffee, latte, tea as well as gelato.  Got their Earl Grey Crepe Cake which was very creamy and flavourful. The usual quality that you would find at their downtown location. Will need to visit them again to see how their drinks are.  The space itself is clean and nicely decorated but seating is very limited. Service was friendly and welcoming. They introduced the different things that they have and also got to sample some of their gelato."}
{"text":"FOOD: 3.5/5 -  I tried their tiramisu Millie crepe and it was wonderful! Very strong espresso flavor and spongy. Originally I wanted to try their Rose Millie crepe but they were all sold out. Luckily my friend got the last piece and I was able to share a bite. It had a very subtle floral sweetness that was quite nice paired with a light scented tea. Their matcha Millie crepe was also very strong. Overall, the Millie crepes were very enjoyable for an afternoon tea. I didn't find that they have a lot of selection in terms of beverage , which was a bit unfortunate because I couldn't pair something with my Millie crepe.  SERVICE: 3/5 - It's pretty much self serve. You order your cake and drink and find a seat yourself. There's also water and napkins on the side for you to grab.   ATMOSPHERE: 4/5 - Quiet, bright and lovely environment. The space is quite small but luckily, isn't packed either."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday afternoon, it was very busy even around 5pm.  The service was courteous.  We ordered a rainbow millie crepe, which was exclusive to this location, sloan tea for 2 (called Jasmine Mist), latte, and green tea gelato.  The crepe was underwhelming and did not seem to hold its shape.  That could be because it was freshly made and had not been refrigerated for very long.  If you're in the area, I would give it a try.  The decor is on point with gold accents, marble tables and minimalistic white designs.  As it tends to be busy and there is limited seating available, take-out might be a better option."}
{"text":"To be it was honestly nothing special. Cakes are quite pricey starting at $7.75. Matcha had no matcha flavour, and even though the earl grey tasted pretty good, I just cannot justify this price point.  I came here around 7pm to pick up cakes and at this point there were barely any remaining. Consistent with other reviews, I really don't know how they can last until 10 with such little stock.   Sales service is slow.  Overall, mediocre experience and doubt I will be back. Just not good value for what you are paying for!!!"}
{"text":"Came here at around 2:30 in the afternoon on a weekday and we were the only ones in there. We got a slice of tiramisu crepe cake and a black sesame Japanese souffle cheesecake.  Both has great flavours but the outside was dry and crusty, clearly leftover cake from the day before. I think I'll only visit this location on weekends when they have higher turnover with their cakes."}
{"text":"Went here for dessert.    Place is quiet and small but with a lot of variety when it comes to dessert.  Came in for the Earl grey crepe cake (they said is popular in Markham) and the matcha crepe cake (they said it is popular at the dt location)  Cakes were both very airy and the butter cream was good.   They were both moist and tasty, but think I preferred the matcha butter cream more.     Will have to come back and try the other flavours they offer.   Price is a bit high , roughly $8 a slice but it is good stuff and makes a nice treat."}
{"text":"Cute small , minimalistic modern decor. Overpriced cakes. Taste good but no wow factor. Lady M cakes win by far if i had to compare crepe cakes! Still good for a try though in markham!"}
{"text":"The first thing that I noticed upon peeling off the plastic sheet that wrapped around each slice of the crepe cake was that the pastry cream between each crepe layer was already melting and mushed up.  I was not impressed about that.  I remember that the Mille Crêpe cakes at the Kensington Market location were kept inside an air-tight fridge and that paper sheets were used to separate each slice.  Perhaps by using plastic in a not-so-airtight refrigerator, the pastry cream had managed to melt.  In other words, I think that their refrigerator is not cold enough!  Taste-wise, the Mille Crêpe cake still tasted good.  However, I thought that the size of the cake was smaller than what I had had before.  The price was also slightly higher than that of its downtown counterpart.  The Earl Grey Mille Crêpe cake had a weak Earl Grey flavour unfortunately.  The Matcha Mille Crêpe cake had a much denser and stronger matcha flavour."}
{"text":"They have 3 stores but this is the only one in Markham at Kennedy and 407 inside the T&T plaza (the other two are downtown - Millie Creperie at 161 Baldwin Street at Kensington Market and Millie Patisserie & Creamery at 12 Oxley Street in the Entertainment district). We came for the crepe cakes and we were not disappointed. We ordered the Earl Grey flavour. The cake was soft and the taste of earl grey can be tasted throughout the cake. We didn't try any of their drinks because we had just finished lunch at Wonton Chai next door. We also ordered the mango gelato and that was really good - nice rich flavour of mango (my son couldn't get enough of it...lol). The prices are a bit steep but that is kinda of expected at this type of cafe. The gelato was a single scoop in a small cup for $3.76 + taxes. The crepe cake varied in price starting at $7.10 for Vanilla Bean and $7.74 for Tiramisu, Matcha and Earl Grey. This is a small cafe with only 4 tables but has a cute decor. It's a nice place to hang out with friends for afternoon tea."}
{"text":"We came here for a tea party. We wanted a good and relaxing experience. However, as you may see there is tea stain on the tea pot. this is very unsanitize and disturbing. And there are literally no one at this place, the employees have PLENTY of time cleaning these equipments. I am just very disappointed in general. May or may not return. I am gonna attach a picture."}
{"text":"As close as it gets to lady M crepe cakes. There is not much variety here- 4 flavours at max. I had the ordinal vanilla one, loved it. The cakes are on the pricer side (7$ and up for one slice)."}
{"text":"We were excited to see that a mille crêpe cafe opened in the Markham area. The only other place we've tried was downtown but it was ok. I agree with the other reviewers in that the decor was minimal. It seemed not quite \"put together\". The cake slices were in the front window and there were 4 flavours to choose from: vanilla bean, tiramisu, matcha, and Earl Grey. There were also some cheese tarts: black sesame and strawberry. We decided to try the matcha, vanilla bean and a black sesame cheese tart. The total came to $23 and change as each slice was over $7. The matcha one had a nice matcha flavour as did the vanilla. I'm not sure what an authentic mille crêpe cake should be like but it was better than the one I had downtown. However, the cheese tart was very runny."}
{"text":"Millie Cafe recently opened in Unionville, and I had to try it since the one downtown was pretty good. It's the same owner, and the owner personally delivers the cakes everyday! So if you really liked the one downtown, rest assured, you're gonna like this one too.  TL;DR: Same owner as the one Downtown Toronto. Quality is pretty much the same.  1. Food (3.5/5)  They're pretty good cakes. It's really what you would expect, nothing more but nothing less. They have flavors like red bean, green tea, earl grey tea (which is probably one of my fav), strawberry, etc. If you haven't tried this place, it might be worth it but I don't see myself coming back every weekend. It's a nice treat every once in a while.  2. Service (4/5)  The staff is really friendly and nice! Asked for some recommendations and they were able to answer it with a lot of details. The service is quick, and you can tell that they enjoy working there.  3. Price (3/5)  I found the cakes a bit on the expensive side, compared to your other options around the area. To put it into perspective, you're looking at spending anywhere from $5 - $8.50 on a slice of a cake. It's a good cake, but I still find the price a bit expensive for the quality.  4. Ambiance [noise, seats, etc] (4/5)  It's a cute little cafe in one of the more lit plazas around Markham. Last time I was there, they had around 4 tables, each able to seat 4 people. It's not very packed and quite quiet, so it's not bad for anyone that wants to enjoy their cakes in peace. I find their lighting a bit dim, so it might be hard to take a stellar Instagram picture.  ------------  Overall (3.5/5)"}
{"text":"I love their Millie crepes I like once in a while they will serve different types of Millie crepes. If the crepe cakes are not there you can always ask if they have any of it at the back.   Other than Millie crepes they served cheese tarts, cookies and ice cream.   I don't know why but their matcha latte is really good. They use the matcha ice cream to make their latte so it's extra cream!!! :)"}
{"text":"There are not many dessert places that serves crepe cakes, but Millie cafe would have to be one of the best ones. There restaurant itself is very small with limited seating of two people per table. When you walk in, you can tell it is very aesthetic with their white themed restaurant. Their cakes are placed right at the front so you can see what their specials are for the day.  We decided to choose the earl grey crepe cake since it was recommended and it is one of their popular flavours. The cake itself was pretty good, but since we aren't use to the texture and multiple layers of crepe, it tasted kind of soggy to us. You are able to taste the earl grey with every bite and we started to like it the more we ate it.   I would give this a 3.5/5 since I prefer the texture of regular cakes but I will definitely come back to try their other flavours."}
{"text":"Came here a couple of times. Its a small shop great for just talking with friends. Loved the crepes here, its really light and not that sweet. The tea here is also really refreshing. Bathroom is gorgeous and clean by the way."}
{"text":"I was rejoiced to see Millie Cafe open a location in Markham.  I love mille crepe cake but to get to their location in Kensington takes alot of travelling and walking.  It took me three attempts to visit this location. First time they were sold out of practically everything. Second time, they were about to close. I took my chance on a Tuesday evening thinking there will probably be nothing or may close by the time I got there. I was overjoyed to see it still open and the display of products well stocked.  Not sure if I got lucky as it was a Tuesday evening.  The young male employee working there was very friendy, kind and helpful. He was really genuine. He even offered me a sample of their gelato to try.   I was very happy to see the last Earl Grey mille crepe being available so I quickly ordered it. I thought I got the last piece but it turns out they had more in the back :)  the last piece was still very fresh, light and fluffly, not too sweet and with the rite amount of cream.   I love the clean sleek look of the cafe but I wish they had more seatings as it only had 3 tables and 6 chairs.   Limited parking in the plaza but there are more parking downstairs near t and t supermarket.  I was too full from dinner to try more items but definitely a revisit in the months to come"}

{"text":"When I visited Millie Creperie in Kensington market a few years ago, I left with an amazing impression. But after tasting the crepe cakes from Millie Cafe here, I was seriously disappointed. To start it off, when I visited the cafe on a weekday at around 4pm, the fridge was already half empty. Seeing as the store was open until 10pm, I struggle to see how such little food can last until that time. Service was extremely slow and very unprofessional - forgetting receipts, not knowing how to use the card machine, etc.   On to the cakes themselves. They were around $7.75 per slice, which is a fairly high price point. I picked up two slices to try out - tiramisu and matcha. While the tiramisu was very rich in the coffee taste, I struggled to taste the matcha flavours in the matcha cake as they were barely noticeable. The cakes were also very stiff and not fluffy, which made me wonder if they were made recently. Final note is that the cakes were falling apart while eating them, and made for a rather unenjoyable and messy experience overall."}
{"text":"I used to go downtown for Millie's cakes, now I can get them in Markham, awesome!!! I love their matcha, tiramisu and earl grey crepe cakes the most. Their thai tea gelato is amazing as well. I tried their rose and rainbow crepe cakes and did not like it at all - they tasted kind of like hand cream? But those were seasonal/limited flavours. They have very limited seating so I usually get takeout and eat it at home. Pretty pricey cakes but it is worth it imo."}
{"text":"I went and got the green tea crepe. It was $8.75 with tax.  It was on the pricey side but it definitely was a light dessert and had great matcha flavor.  I would try the other flavors like the road gray and Tiramisu crepe cakes again. But prices of the deserts kind of turn me off. Ambiance of the restaurant is very nice and modern. There are dine-in option where you can get tea with the dessert."}
{"text":"Millie was always my favourite bakery downtown, so I was very excited to visit their Markham location. I always get their matcha cake.  It is a sweet treat after a long day at work!"}
{"text":"A cute cafe with a good selection of desserts. The cafe itself is very small with a minimalistic vibe. The worker was very friendly when I went and he was extremely helpful whenever I had questions.  I tried the early grey crepe cake and I loved every bite of it as the cake itself wasn't overly sweet. The tiramisu crepe cake was good too but I thought the early grey was much better. The price is a little up there as expected but the quality of the crepe cake made up for it."}
{"text":"Went here to try their famed crepe cakes. I'd seen them in Kensington but never tried them.   When you walk in you get the impression that they're trying to be really fancy but it kind of doesn't work in a Chinese plaza with your storefront facing the parking lot. Everything was super white and shiny with marble tables ... so it kind of felt like I was in a washroom. Nothing on the walls but a really subtle also white decal with the store name. There's such thing as minimalism in decor and there's looking bare.  We got a slice of earl grey crepe cake for about 8.75 including tax. the crepe was really soft and delicate and the cream was light as well. I would have liked a stronger earl grey taste - it was mostly cream.  Came here thinking that this was a more casual cafe. It is not. It's a place to chat with your friends over coffee. The tables are tiny so don't think about doing work here and there is no wifi or plugs.  Overall it was an okay experience - the cake was good but definitely not quite worth the price. The atmosphere feels a bit awkward too and not very cozy because of the tiny space and small tables that are a little too close together. from what I remember there was no music so it was super quiet. Also all the tables are near the door so if someone opens the door, you will feel it.   Overall not a great experience but I hope it will be better in the future."}
{"text":"I love this unique little place and just wish more people knew about it. The ambience is perfect for those that love IG worthy food pics. The selection wasn't too large but quality over quantity. The server was very nice. Although she made a mistake on an item that was sold out, she took it upon herself to replace the order with an item that was more expensive then the original one.   Recommendations:  Latte (very pretty and artistic. Texture was pretty good with the added whip cream and sprinkles on top)  Jasmine green tea (their tea sets are just adorable and the tea is very average but it's a nice tea for the price) Sesame tart (I absolutely hate sesame but this was pretty interesting!! I wasn't opposed to the taste and texture was pretty frothy for the filling.  Macha crêpe cake (crêpe cakes usually do really good or really bad and taste like raw shit. But this one... it was the good one! The match powder on top was a little too much for my liking but the texture and taste was awesome!)"}
{"text":"So awesome to have Millie close to home now! Their crepe cakes are the best. The gelato is not bad. I've had the vanilla and matcha cakes before, but tonight I got to try the most amazing one yet: charcoal!!! Definitely a must have if you're into intense flavours. Will be returning. The only reason they don't get 5 stars is their coffee. The hub ordered an americano and it was incredibly watery. The beans appear to be good, but someone must teach the barista about espresso shot:water ratios."}
{"text":"I was excited when I heard they opened a Millie's crepe in Markham. I got the rose crepe cake and the earl grey crepe cake to go. The rose crepe cake tasted as if they poured the whole bottle of rose flavouring into the cake. It was so 'rose' that the cake tasted really artificial. The earl grey was much better. However, cakes are on the pricier side. Would opt for Lady M crepe cakes any day, too bad it's not available in Toronto."}
{"text":"I AM IN LOVE WITH THEIR EARL GREY MILLIE CAKE. Millie in french is a thousand so this place sells layered french crepe cakes! I had one bite of the earl grey millie cake and right then and there.. i knew i wanted this cake, THE WHOLE CAKE for my birthday lol. It is delicious. I love anything earl grey but this cake was so creamy. Ive had millie cakes at other locations and it just doesn't compare!"}
{"text":"I was really excited when I set foot in this place, after reading all the raving reviews.  I was disappointed in the limited seating, less than enthusiastic cashier, and the crepe cake which had too much cream.   I ordered the matcha and the earl grey crepe cake. Both could have been more fragrant and used less cream."}
{"text":"Overall a wonderful experience. Shared the rainbow Millie crepe cake, black sesame cake and a pot of Sloane's heavenly cream tea with my cuz. The cakes weren't too sweet which I liked. I couldn't tell what the rainbow crepe cake flavour was (the staff said it was unicorn flavour) but it did remind me of something I would eat when I was a kid. The black sesame cake had an intense sesame flavour and was moist, my preferred choice out of the two.   The tea set they gave us for our tea was beautiful! Really enjoyed the tea, although I expected the tea to be darker and bolder. The space of the actual shop had nice decor but is tiny. The staff were friendly and accommodating. Would recommend a visit."}
{"text":"One word. Good!.   Specially when u bite, it gives a very soft feeling.  Sweet level is on point. Match it with a black coffee if u find it too sweet and it will make ur day like blessed."}
{"text":"Millie cafe is a small little shop that focuses on the Mille Crepe cakes.  I've been a few times and have now tried the Earl grey, tiramisu, Sakura and vanilla bean Crepe cakes and all have been consistently good. So far my favorite is the Earl grey.  The cakes are a bit pricy but there are also not too many other options in Markham for these types of cakes. Overall recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is really over priced for what it is. There was a short semi curly black hair on the crepe cake. The taste of the crepe cake is mediocre at best. This place is always empty and now I know why!"}
{"text":"This is my first time trying crepe cake. SO GOOD. Earl grey... It melts in your mouth. Where have you been all my life?! I also tried the matcha green tea cheesecake which was not bad at all. But my heart lies with the earl grey. Both cost $15 total.   Cute little tables. Self serve water. Just sit and gab with the gals ;)"}
{"text":"So many dessert spots in Unionville, so little time. But it's absolutely time well spent with crepe cake at Millie. I have made the mission to Kensington for a slice of Millie's. Practically a dream come true for them to open around the block.  The cake and tea selection is just right. There is something for everybody, especially crepe cake first-timers. If you're lucky the featured seasonal crepe cake flavour will be just as awesome as their signatures. On my latest visit, we ordered earl grey, match green tea, and tiramisu crepe cake and a pot of Heavenly Cream tea.  The cakes are always consistent. Velvety, creamy, and flavourful. Despite the small portion for cost, you get a bang for your buck for the understated quality.  To pair, the tea was smooth and delicious. Black teas are my favourite - this tea was light bodied with wonderful perfume essence.  Great place for a small group of friends or 1 on 1. Cute interior makes for good photo op for the 'gram as well."}
{"text":"Finally made it here tonight to try Millie Creperie Markham location.  I was so excited to hear that the owner open this location as their original location in Kensington Market was a bit too far for us to go to on a regular basis.  The ambiance here is like an afternoon tea shop which is very different from their downtown one which has a very lively ice cream parlour feel to it.  I much prefer the feel of the downtown location.  As for food, we got the earl grey crepe cake which wasn't as soft as it should taste when it's fresh.  I was quite disappointed especially since they make the best Millie crepe cakes compared to other places like Bake Code or Green Tea Lounge.  They also don't have the handheld sweet and savoury crepes at this location.  We did really enjoy the mango gelato which we'll definitely come back for if we are in the area."}
{"text":"What keeps bringing me back are their cakes and offering of Sloane tea. I've always gone off peak hours, so their 8-10 seating area has never been a problem. I also don't mind that they don't offer WiFi as it prevents people from staying longer than they should. I always forget that Asian inspired flavours of gelato are offered here as well. It's a nice little place to have a break by yourself or catch up with friends!"}
{"text":"I was waiting for this to open for the longest time when I saw that construction was happening and their crepe cakes do no disappoint!  Management: Simple menu where you walk up to order; it's on the right side by the cashier and on the wall in small font, so I had to walk right up to it - or you can just order from the display.   Service: Polite and helpful. They give recommendations if you don't know where to start and they also direct you to the cutlery section after you order when you sit in to enjoy.   Cleanliness: I don't know if it's because it's mostly white, but this place looked pristine! Even their washroom is impressive!  I enjoyed the following: 1. Tiramisu Crepe Cake ($7.74): This had a bittersweet aroma, which I loved! It melted in my mouth when I took the first bite and the flavour combinations are just spectacular! There's not too much cream like many crepe cakes tend to be, so I was able to finish it easily! This is highly recommended - you gotta have this!  2. Matcha Azuki Soufflé Cheesecake ($6.63): This was not as impressive as the tiramisu crepe cake. I don't know if souffle means that it would be soft, but it wasn't very soft; in fact, it was firmer than I expected. In addition, there was no \"cheesecake\" flavour to it either, so I wouldn't call it a souffle nor a cheesecake. Even on its own, it wasn't delicious - both matcha and azuki flavours were too subtle for my personal taste and the firm texture was such a turn-off. Stick to what they're known for and order the crepe cakes instead.  3. Thai Iced Tea Gelato ($3.76): Very smooth ice cream and the flavour is EXACTLY thai iced tea so I was impressed with that. However, it melted within seconds of purchasing and I find this on the pricier side so I can't afford to have this each time :c  4. Iced Matcha Latte ($4.65): You can order this iced but you wouldn't know that unless you asked. I don't think they're used to making iced drinks because they didn't have any straws for it. The matcha flavour was sweet and subtle. For me, I prefer a more bitter matcha so this wouldn't be my go-to place for that. They don't have any dairy alternatives either so it was really milky in my opinion. Maybe opt for a different drink.  Overall, I enjoyed what this place is known for - their crepe cakes. Even though the other items pale in comparison, their flagship product still exceeds expectations and that is what you should come here for!"}
{"text":"I remember having a Millie cake at a restaurant before and it was good, so I set my expectations high for this cafe. It is bright and clean and the crepe cakes are nicely presented, but I was quite disappointed by the Earl Grey Crepe Cake. It had way too much cream and very little Earl Grey flavour. The crepe layers were also a little too moist and so the texture wasn't great. I haven't tried the other desserts, but to be honest am not that excited to."}
{"text":"Being in Markham, there are not many choices of decent Millie Crepe cake. Millie Cafe probably the best one as of now.  I would not call this place a \"cafe\" as there are only 3 small tables for 2. You will be lucky if you able to find an empty table. (I was there on a Wednesday at 8:30 pm and there was no empty table). I opted for take out  Selection was quite limited: no more Earl Grey but I have my eyes on Matcha Millie Crepe and also have a Souffle Black Sesame Cheesecake.  I really enjoyed my crepe cakes! So soft and so bouncy and have so many layers! I just could not stop admiring it. I can imagine the work, the time and the skills to make that. (No, I don't think I can make this at home!)  Skip the Souffle cheesecake! I just dislike the texture, the taste and everything. Meh.  Price is high. Not something I would get all the time. But I still want to try the Earl Grey. And one day maybe I am so inspired to make something like this myself."}
{"text":"Cute little cafe in Markham with some unique crepe cakes.  I enjoyed the matcha cheese tart and the rainbow crepe cake.    I found some of the prices a little steep like the rainbow crepe cake which was almost $9 a slice.   They also have no wifi which is another downer for this place but they're bathroom is pretty fancy looking."}
{"text":"I was excited to see a place to get Millie Crepe cakes in the GTA. Prices were comparable to Lady M's crepe cake slices in NYC so I felt that the prices were a bit steep for what you get. When you walk in, the \"cafe\" is very small and has limited seating. You also have to order at the front and take your food to your seat (if you manage to get one). Ordered a slice of cake and 2 scoops of ice cream. The whole process of getting my food to me took about 10+ minutes. Overall the ice cream and the cake was pretty good."}
{"text":"Located in the T&T plaza, Millie Cafe is the main dessert place for crepe cakes in Markham. I have to say right off the bat, I really really love their decor and atmosphere here. It's like an upscale, everything white, vintage, and cute kind of vibe. When we walked in, we saw different flavours such as matcha and tiramisu and we didn't know what to try. We asked for the employee's suggestion and said the earl grey was everyone's favourite. So we went with that!  This is my first time eating a crepe cake and I'm not sure if I'm a fan. I don't know if it was the flavour or that it was a little soggy, but it was quite odd to me. As I kept eating, the texture and flavour slightly got better, but for the most part I thought it was ok. I also found it overpriced at about $8 PER SLICE. Crazy!!! I shared with my friend, and tbh I wouldn't get it again without sharing the costs with another person.   I'd like to try other flavours, but it will be a once in a long while thing for me. Love the interior, not sure about the cake. 3/5."}
{"text":"Found my mille crepe place now.  It used to be Green Tea lounge, but this tastes a bit better and feels less pricey for what you get.  I haven't been to the downtown location, but the shop keeper did say that it was from downtown.  So how would I describe this?  I'll start with the negatives first.  #1 the creme to crepe ratio is a bit unbalanced so I taste mostly creme compared to crepe. #2 the creme feels thick rather than airy  I think both can be attributed to the fact that it is not made in the Markham location but comes from the downtown location and shipped over.  The shipping may have de-aired the creme and change the feel of it to make it thick and strong rather than light and airy (which is what I would expect from this dish)  Hopefully they teach the Markham staff how to make it there so there's no transport breakage.  Or at the very least get them to re-whip the creme and assemble it in Markham."}
{"text":"After having ramen with my friend we were in the mood for something sweet. This was close by so we decided to give it a try. We were not impressed the moment we walked in. Decor is at a bare minimum and it looks like the shop has not been complete with markings on the metal part of the window.   It would be good if the menu was changed to a material that's less reflective. It was difficult to read with light bouncing off at that angle. Maybe print more menus to be placed elsewhere.   This was my first time having matcha crepe cake. I was anticipating a lot since I love matcha. The cake tasted a lot of cream and hardly any matcha, quite disappointing. I won't be going back."}
{"text":"I tried a mille cake for the first time at Lady M so I was very excited I could have it again here in Markham. I tried the Rainbow, Vanilla, and Matcha flavoured slices. To my disappointment, they did not meet my expectations. The flavours were average. Nothing worth writing home about. The Rainbow cake was pretty much a cheesecake. The crepe layers were soggy/mushy from the thick layers of cream, so once you took a bite, it was hard to experience the unique texture of multiple layers of crepes in your mouth. And without that texture, a mille cake becomes pretty average."}
