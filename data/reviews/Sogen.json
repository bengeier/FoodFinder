{"text":"My friend brought me to this place. It is a bit far from where we live but worth the ride. The food was excellent. We had a full course. My favourite part was the crab salad. From the flavour, the taste, the crunchiness.. wow. Simply amazing. The food was well presented.
This has a \"fancy\" kind of environment. The lights were dimmed, cool ambiance. A bit pricey given the fact that they offer good quality food.
Overall I would recommend this place for events."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! Nous y allons régulièrement. Leur boeuf teryaki est génial! Il arrive grésillant...miam! Leurs sushi spécialités sont un peu chers, mais tellement délicieux! L'ambiance donne l'impression d'être dans un resto tendance du centre ville."}
{"text":"This is a new sushi restaurant that opened up in my old neighborhood. I had the miso soup as an entree which was quite good, not the best but still satisfying. You can then order meals or make your own sushi combo, I chose the latter. Sushi was fresh, the tempura was amazing. One of the best things was that the waiter asked if we were going to order some wine and if so, if we would like suggestions on best pairings for our orders. We ended up ordering a bottle that went great with the sushi, lobster salad and salmon. I will definitely go back."}
