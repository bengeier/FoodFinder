{"text":"I love love love the garlic naan bread and butter chicken! I get the lunch special quiet often. It's a smaller space but newly renovated, prices are decent for the lunch portion."}
{"text":"I love this place. I went there after various friends gave it rave reviews. When people hype a place too much, I'm always a bit hesitant...  Overall, I was very impressed with the food. My mattar paneer was so good - and I pretty much have it at every Indian restaurant I go to. The paneer came in huge chunks and it was delicious. Overall, the food there is excellent - it has good layers of flavours and the prices are reasonable. It's becoming my go to place for Indian.   The only negative about the place is that its small so you should make reservations and the service is a bit slow."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a new Indian place for a while, and this one did not disappoint. While many Indian restaurants take refuge in grease, everything at Cinamon was relatively light and relied on flavour rather than fat.The eggplant bartha was simply astounding; very flavourful and spicy, but not overwhelming. The bajis were a little doughy (I'm used to big, airy ones) but still had a nice, complex taste.    It was also nice that you can glance into the kitchen from the dining room (it's a very small space) and watch your naan being kneaded and grilled. The server was polite and friendly, even when the gigantic serving platters started overwhelming our table! On that note, I would be careful about coming here with more than 4-6 people, as it is a teeny tiny little place- but it being so close to the beach and right on Queen makes the location a winner. Grab dinner here, wander East along the beach, and up again to Queen for a dessert of Ed's Real Scoop ice cream (or, if it's more your style, East to Castro's for a beer) and you'll have had yourself a very pleasant evening!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Indian food.   Chef's cart appetizer was great.  All 4 main dishes were exceptional and well priced for the portion size.  Chicken Vindaloo and Lamb Roganjosh stole the show with intense flavor and spice.  Chicken tikka Marsala and mutter with paneer were also delicious.   What our group noticed was that the ingredients, especially the meats, were high quality versus what is often passed off on the Gerrard street strip.  I hope the quality continues and this place stays at the beach for many years to come."}
{"text":"Beaches dinning is mediocre at best, but this place is absolutely brilliant. Some of the most authentic Indian food I've had in Canada. The onion Bhaji was deliciously simple and a great start as well as the samosas. The lamb vindaloo was spicy and mouthwatering tender.  Love love loved this place. I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I often refer to The Beaches as \"the land of food mediocrity\" so I was surprised at how much I liked my dinner at Cinamon. Everything I tried was super tasty. A standout was the aloo tikkies with chole: two soft potato patties served over spicy and sweet chana. I rarely get that excited about chickpeas but these were spicy and sweet and just really really good!  We ate in but it seems like this place does a lot of take-out business as well."}
{"text":"Finally found a spot that serves true Mughlai food. The chef is from Delhi(which is the capital of india and also was the capital of Mughal India) The tandoori chicken was amazing, that meT was definitely marinated the right way so that rhe meat was infused with flavour. Loved how they served the Dum Biryani - clay pot covered with naan bread to give it the steam cooking that locks in the flavor. Will definitely be going back and trying more dishes."}
{"text":"Seems like an ideal place to bring a date in the east end.  It's affordable although the portion size was small.  The food was a little less intense then I'm used to for Indian but it was certainly respectable.  I wouldn't call it bland but let's just say that the flavour didn't blow me away.   The space is intimate and well decorated, feels like it could be any modern restaurant, there's no campy Indian decor to be found at all.  I definitely want to sit down there one time. Maybe takeout wasn't the best way to experience the food here."}
{"text":"Great authentic food and good prices too.  Can't comment on the service, as we ordered take-out.  Writing this review based on an N of 1, but so far, so GREAT!  I really hope they stick around.  BTW, their permanent website is apparently not up yet, but they have a (temporary?) website at: https://sites.google.com/site/cinamonindianbistro/"}
{"text":"I'm from England where we are spoilt with great curries. Outside of Asia there is no better place to try Indian/Pakistani food than the UK. Overall Toronto has a terrible reputation for Indian food. There are some good restaurants, but on the whole it is bad. Cinnamon is somewhere in the middle.   Cinnamon is probably so well reviewed because relatively speaking it is probably one of Toronto's best mid range curry houses. Overall, however, I've had mixed results.   The last time I was there the food was 25 minutes late (and there was no apology) , the poppadoms were burnt, the chicken in the 2 curries we had were both overcooked and tasteless, both of the curries were incredibly watery (there's nothing worse) and everything was lacking in flavour.   I've been there twice, but won't be going again."}
{"text":"I really like this restaurant. It's cozy and intimate ... a good date restaurant. It's not a great choice for a larger party as the restaurant is very small. There's maybe 10 tables (in the summer, they have a few tables on the front patio). It's a simple layout - you can see the chef cooking away in the kitchen at the back of the restaurant. I feel bad though, it's usually empty - which certainly doesn't reflect the food quality, which is simply delicious and fresh. It's one of the best Indian meals I've had in the City. We ordered all the favourites - Chana Masala, Beef Tikka, Nan, Butter Chicken. Everything was spectacular. I was really impressed with the rich flavours. It was a bit on the pricey side - but I find Indian food restaurants, generally speaking, all have this flaw. The one female server was very sweet and accommodating. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"The food here is really great and the people are nice, but the service is very slow! We waited about an hour for our food to arrive--it was one of those situations where all conversation came to a halt and there were four anxious necks craned in the direction of the kitchen to see when, if ever, our dinner was going to arrive!  However, will give this a second chance as good Indian food is hard to come by in Toronto (esp. in Little India, haha). If the service is as slow again next time, I'll resort to takeout."}
{"text":"This restaurant closed, sold ownership and reopened appearing exactly the same (no renos and even using the exact same old menus).   Unaware of the change, we ordered takeout last weekend and ordered our usual order Chicken Tikka, Butter Fish Masala and Sweet Naan.   All were edible but very disappointing.   The butter fish had only 4 very small pieces of fish, and was overly sweet.  The naan were thick like a pita bread, not the previous thin large soft but outwardly crispy ones we were used to.   They said the order would be ready for pickup after 1 hour.   I drove to pick it up, an hour and 15mins later and it wasn't ready.   Had to wait an additional 25mins at the store."}
{"text":"Great food. I've had supper here on number of occasions, but the service is always below par. Less than friendly. The food is pretty good. Bit on the pricy side."}
{"text":"I am well experienced with Indian food. I've eaten it all over the world including India! Did I also mention that I am Indian?  This is some of the best Indian food outside of India or the Middle East that I have ever eaten. It is absolutely the best Indian food in Toronto. I promise. If you like Indian Food, go. You will not be disappointed. The chef has cooked for dignitaries all over the world. His accolades are displayed on the wall. Lunch specials are great too.   Only shortfall....No booze."}
{"text":"Ate at the Cinamon Indian Bistro last night and wow, it was good!   The dal makhani and aloo tikki are fantastic."}
{"text":"If you want a delicious Indian tradition modernize cuisine, this one will be good choice!"}
{"text":"First time there and aside from it being small, and one side is in the line of the door, so can't imagine what it will be like in the winter. The food was fantastic. My friend and I shared the Butter Chicken, Aloogobi Masala. Garlic Naan and Xacutti coconut curry dish. I would have liked to try the rice pudding, but we were too full. If only they were licensed, all would be great."}
{"text":"If you are in the beaches and wanting Indian food, Cinamon is a great option! I'm used to hole in the wall type establishments and I wasn't sure of what to expect.  Cinamon surprised me - portions were huge, curries not too greasy. I really like the charred eggplant, and the butter chicken and lamb korma was spicy and delicious.  Garlic naan was huge as well.  Overall, I really liked the food here! However, it took a really, really - really log time for our food. We had placed an order to pick-up - and I still ended up waiting a good 30 minutes.  A good choice for dinner as long as you aren't in a hurry!"}
{"text":"This is a small restaurant on the Beaches, not usually known as a place to eat some of the best and most varied Indian food in town. Being small means one chef and one server, with a chef who cooks everything fresh that day.   No buffet! What a difference that makes for the quality of ingredients (if you're going to eat as much as you can hold, you're going to get quantity. not quality) and the taste and nutrient quality.   The presentations here are works of art (see my photo; alas, my friend pictured here is no work of art!) By keeping ingredients distinct instead of mushing them up, you get to taste each ingredient and savor it.  Because there's no waste, as is common with buffets, the cost is comparable.  And you leave feeling like you've had a tasty meal, without that full-to-busting feel, and have the experience of eating genuine Indian cuisine.  As I argue in my book Food and City Building, we need to reframe our thinking about food and ask not \"how do i get food cheaper\" but instead \"how do i get more value from my food.\"   If you want to know the difference between these two frameworks, try this place. --wayne r"}
{"text":"So good!  In spite of the lack of liquor license it is my favourite local indian food choice.  It is worth going in to eat - home delivery was not very fast or hot. You have to try it."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this incredible place while visiting Toronto and came back two days in a row. Lunch specials are amazing. Chef and owner makes up everything fresh and steaming and will accommodate any dietary needs (offered 3 vegan substitutions for lunch). Served beautifully on plate with a salad and naan and rice. Love it."}
{"text":"I would prefer to give this 3.5 stars, but I'm being nice and bumping up. I got takeout. The Aloogobi Masala was very good, probably my favorite in TO. The Butter Chicken was a little too sweet and the container was filled with mostly sauce. Chicken was good quality pieces though, no fatty, brown, or gristly bits. Lamb Roganjosh was decent flavor (although also too much sauce to lamb ratio), but the lamb was a little dry. Pulao rice was simple but good. The worst though was the Garlic Naan - it was flat, tough, burnt, and so greasy that when I squeezed a piece, grease dripped out. I've never had worse naan, even counting the frozen supermarket kind. Very disappointing. I might consider eating here again but I'd want to get my naan from somewhere else."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Cinamon a several times now and it has quickly become my go to place for Indian food and really all my take out needs in Toronto.  Be warned, the food here is highly addictive! The flavours are rich and complex and the price is extremely good.  Don't be fooled by the so-so decor - the food here is outstanding.  I see people lined up a few doors down for the Green Eggplant, (a mediocre experience at best), and tell them to go to Cinamon instead.  The chef here has cooked for presidents and royalty - go treat yourself to a taste sensation."}
{"text":"I ordered the lamb rogan josh and two garlic naan. The rogan josh sauce was simple but tasty. The lamb however was not great. Pretty dry and disappointing especially since the dish was $13.99 plus tax. The garlic naan was very small and thin for the price -  $2.99 per piece. I've had much fresher and larger pieces of naan at other places for less money. The meal was $21 after the 10% cash discount and I expected better quality overall for the price. I've been here before and experienced a similar level of quality but it's the only Indian food in the beaches so I returned back thinking maybe they've improved. Not so."}
{"text":"Awesome Indian food. Best in the beaches without a doubt. Prices are very fair and it's owned by the nicest family! I am a regular here and have never been disappointed. Takeout is quick and their are great combos. Only downfall is that they don't have their liquor license.. And I find Indian food always pairs well with a beer."}
{"text":"I had walked by Cinamon Indian Bistro so many times and never gone in. I remember when it just opened and thinking to myself \"Ouu, I should try that place and support local business. Mmm smells good!\"  I'm so glad I finally did! The place is tiny with only a dozen or so tables. But the decor is really nice and classy. There was only one other couple having dinner when we were there, but there was also at least three people that came in to pick up take out orders. The waiter was so nice and the aroma from the kitchen was absolutely mouthwatering. We started with onion bhaji. They were great, and as an added touch, the plating was so fancy! (I added a photo) As my main I had to order the butter chicken. I know... it's so typical. But I use the butter chicken as my measure when I try new Indian food. Is it spicy and flavourful enough? Is the chicken good quality meat? Yes to both! It was fantastic. The naan was hot and freshly made. I was stuffed :)  I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a step up from the boring pub fare of the neighbourhood. Good date restaurant too."}
{"text":"Loved this place, but I learned my lesson. Never go on a Sunday of a Monday long weekend. :( It was not busy at all. Restaurant was empty. We got stale, probably day old rice or rice that sat in the open too long and dried up. It was uneatable. The samosas were soaked in grease and half uneatable. We were so disappointed as we're we're looking forward to a delicious meal as we usually have. In fact, I would have even taken it back had I not lived so far. So much food went to waste that night. So sad."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this restaurant.  The food was generally great, and i really liked the people who run it and the atmosphere.  Music sat nicely in the background and was easy to enjoy while leaving room for conversation.  We ordered many dishes so we got a real sense of the menu.  The paneer was probably the best I've ever had.  Rice, naan, lassies were all great.  Lamb would benefit from stewing a bit longer, I think.  Perhaps it was just because of what we ordered, but I myself wishing for more variation in the dishes.  Many had the same red base sauce and it really didn't vary much from dish to dish. But there was a whole section of the menu that we didn't order from that listed different curries with your choice of meats.  Perhaps if we'd used that section, we would have avoided so many similar tasting dishes.  Next time, that's what we'll do."}
{"text":"I could have easily walked by this place and not really noticed it or though of going in. But a friend took me there and I am so glad she did.  We had bahji, lamb, chicken and eggplant, rice and naan.  The food came really quickly, it was delicious, and the staff was so friendly.  The prices are average, and the restaurant is quite small and intimate.   Would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Omg. I eat indian food all the time and this place is a cut above the rest. Not greasy, fresh and delicious. Really really good. I loved it. You really need to try it. The onion bhaji was excellent. Naan was light and fluffy. Even the rice had a great taste!!!"}
{"text":"I'm Indian and I usually don't like getting Indian food from out because it never quite tastes right to me. Well, my hubby brought this home for me last night and it did not disappoint! We tried all three types of naan, the butter chicken, a lamb dish and potato dish (sorry - can't remember the names off hand since I didn't do the ordering!). All were AMAZING. Such a hidden gem in my neighbourhood. I've lived here for 3 years and only just discovered it. Definitely may become our in-neighbourhood date night go-to. Definitely good for takeout. Try it now. Thank us later ;)"}
{"text":"BEST Indian in Toronto. Hands down. Just wish they had delivery for lazy Netflix nights."}
{"text":"Some people will find a reason to complain about anything! We have ordered from just about every indian resto in the beach,and King West while we lived there, and Cinamon is hands down the best!  Portions are good, meat quality is very good and flavours are outstanding! It may take a little longer to prepare, but that is because it is being made fresh as you order."}
{"text":"A nice small Indian restaurant located in the Beaches area. There are many family owned restaurants in the area and this one is no exception. We came here on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. It wasn't busy when we arrived but it got busier closer to the noon hour. A very small and clean restaurant with limited seating, probably sits about 20 people max. I'm always a sucker for butter chicken at any Indian restaurants and there is no surprise that I ordered that at this restaurant. It came with rice and we also ordered some delicious naan bread to complement our meals. Simply delicious overall but the nice soft naan bread to the very tasty and well-seasoned butter chicken meat. Staff were friendly and we got our food in a timely manner. Nice cozy restaurant to dine at and the prices are very reasonable. Overall, we had a very memorable dining experience and would return to try some of their other items on the menu. Highly recommend if you are looking for good food in the Beaches area!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews about this place I decided to go give it a try since I was in the area. I would have to say this place serves really nice nice Indian food! The dishes I had were really flavourful and a nice portion for the price. You are able to choose how spicy you wanted your dish to be which was great! I would definitely recommend this place!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. Best Indian meal I've ever had in a restaurant.  Flavors are so delicate, staff so friendly. Only downside is no license."}
{"text":"Nice small place. Friendly staff. The food was very good.  Onion bhaji and samosas were very good. Qorma fish and chana masala was delicious. Very rich and full of flavour. The naan was ok. Little on the dry side."}
{"text":"Gluten free Vegan here.   I ordered bharta, Chana Masala and saag aloo. They were all on the greasy side but quite tasty. The bharta had good flavour and fresh tomato and cilantro (rare for take out).The potatoes in the saag aloo tasted previously frozen, but the rest was good with a cumin taste and plenty of onions. The Chana was ok, nothing special.   The issue came when I asked for dairy free due to allergy and my instructions were disregarded. The order arrived an hour late so I dove in only to realize instructions weren't followed. It took 8 calls and 2 hours to confirm there was milk delivery in my food. So, I'll have a fever for a few days. They refunded my order but I hope in future they just follow instructions and deliver on time. Staff was kind enough just not super on it."}
{"text":"Second time having take out here and it's delicious. We had samosa, butter chicken (some of the best I've had), naan and Lamb Biryani.   Every bite was better then the last. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food here is good. Some of the best lamb I've had. They service level is great. Linens water constantly filled. You can't go wrong with the food. But there is something shady going on with the business end. When I ate there in July they gave me a bill from the previous December."}
{"text":"Got the lamb curry and butter chicken. Both were hands down the best I've tried in the city.   However the naan was flat, rubbery and not the fluffy, delicious, sweet naan that most indian restaurants in the city have easily mastered (even though their curries aren't as delicious)...... This kinda ruined our meal for us.  The second deal breaker was the number of dead bugs in the window panes ... Looked like it hasn't been cleaned in years... Kinda ruined my appetite.  Lastly, the service was poor- we weren't really checked up on.  Verdict; great take out spot for curry and rice - naan and dine in experience wasn't so great."}
{"text":"I still continue to love this place as it is the only good Indian food in the beaches, but I definitely notice something has changed.. not too sure what but I have been ordering the same thing for a couple years now and it tastes a bit different now and the portion is definitely a bit smaller.  My only complaint is that it is quite expensive, dinner for 2 will run about 50-60$ which can be pricey for some, but overall I feel good that I am order quality home cooked food! :)"}
{"text":"Loved this small and simple restaurant! Delicious lamb rogan josh, my wife enjoyed a nice tandoori chicken. Great sides in the form of poppadums, chutneys, raita etc. Highly recommended, is run with love."}
{"text":"Very slow service, expensive for the small amount of food you receive and the older woman serving is just the most miserable and unaccommodating  person you will meet in a supposedly \"fine\" dining restaurant. The place is so small you could hardly swing a cat in the place, I would not advise any person from out of the area to make a special visit to dine here it would be a wasted journey and a waste of your hard earned money. Just go to Any restaurant on Gerrard it will be a lot more enjoyable and you'll actually receive decent portions with decent food. Oh and one last thing check your bill carefully before you leave you wouldn't want to be hammered with the infamous discreet 20% service fee  and add a tip on top of it."}
{"text":"We get takeout from here all the time, and the food is always delicious! The menu has a good amount of variety, and is reasonably priced. The staff are friendly and always seem to appreciate our business."}
{"text":"This is the BEST Indian food I have ever had! It is so addictive though! My boyfriend and I frequent Cinamon all the time. Minimum of once a week. He goes at least twice a week, daily if I'd let him!  I always get the extra spicy chicken vindaloo with rice and naan. It's amazing. The chicken is so lean and the sauce is always cooked to perfection.  I can not fault one thing about any of it. I've tried a few other dishes here too such as Korma and some spicy fish dish, can't recall the name. Beware however, once you try this place you'll not want Indian from anywher else.  They don't have a liquor licence yet which is a pity, hopefully soon! As I love that I live close to this place!"}
{"text":"Having travelled through India coming back I found so many curry places left much to be desired but Cinamon has the flavors and spices that take me right back. Chicken tikka masala and lamb saag are some of my regular go to's, food is never greasy and always fresh.  A true Sunday night takeout treat!"}
{"text":"The food was good. The -2 stars is for their service. There was just one lady taking orders and running back and forth doing kitchen work (the cook was in the back). Most of the time we waited for everything, patiently. We ordered from the menu, and our total for two people for lunch came to $58, however she decided to charge us a 20% service fee and made the total $70!!! She lacked basic manners with everyone, and made the experience very awkward."}
{"text":"Coming from an Indian person, this place is amazing!! We went in about forty minutes before closing on a Friday night. The service was friendly and attentive. We got the chicken tikka, lamb biriyani, malai kofta, and garlic naan. Everything was spiced perfectly, and the naans were made in front of us. They were soft, pillowy, and had just the right amount of chew. It's slightly more expensive than your average Indian restaurant, but it's delicious. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I've only sampled the vegetarian menu but every dish I've had has been incredibly seasoned. Each dish has its own flavour profile and they aren't drowned out by cream or oil like other places. The quality of the recipe and ingredients is noticeable from the first bite. Absolutely addictive, you'll keep eating after you're stuffed. It can take 20-35mins when ordering take out because the naan is made fresh and I think the dishes are too, as much as they can in a restaurant setting. The bill can quickly add up when getting a few dishes plus naan or rice, but you are paying for top quality."}
{"text":"This place is definitely overrated.  Came here as per Yelp and Dine.to's review. Their food is good but definitely not up to the hype surrounding it. The service was extremely slow as their priorities were on take out orders. My friend and I arrived at 8 and it took the server 20 mins to attend to our table.  We were the last two tables left at the end of the night and the server was commenting to her regular customers that some table did not order a lot of food.  Overall, poor impression of the place."}
{"text":"This is probably my favourite Indian restaurant in Toronto and yes it definitely beats Lahore Tikka House.  I was sad to hear the owners have changed, the previous owners were the sweetest souls! They recognized us right away and we'd always converse. Now, when I enter I just get seated with minimal conversation.   It's a very small restaurant so don't bring a big group of people. It would be the perfect date spot!   I always order the butter chicken here because it's so creamy and has the perfect balance of sweetness and spice. The garlic naan paired with the butter chicken is so delicious."}
{"text":"Oh dear, did I actually forget to write a review for this place? It has become the only place in Toronto I will get Indian food from, unless I want fine dining, in which case I'll go to 259 Host. So, what can I say about this place. Authentic flavours and spices, top notch quality. They're getting mighty snooty about time to prep food and deliver etc, but they make it fresh. When the kebabs and naans come out of the 1000 degree tandoor, you know it will melt your heart.  But really. Get your spice meter up, and then try their kebabs, tandoori stuff, aloo tikki with chole for apps, and also their biryani.  I got chatting with the owners one day. Turns out, the chef has cooked at Bukhara in India. You don't get better Indian food anywhere on THIS PLANET. Makes you forget the grossness that is Lahore Tikka House. Can't believe this gem is right here. I thought I'd be condemned to a life of bad Indian food in Toronto till I chanced upon this place. Life changed."}
{"text":"We just happened to pass by this place and thought to give it a try.  The place is small but the food is pretty good here.  I really enjoyed the garlic naan and paneer curry.  I especially liked the fact that when we ordered our food to be spicy,  it actually was spicy, and I love my Indian food to be very spicy:) Overall I really enjoyed eating here."}
{"text":"Really good halal, Indian food in a beautiful neighbourhood.  I usually avoid Indian food because I cannot, repeat x 1000, cannot, handle spicy food, or food with too many spices. However, my family decided to try an Indian restaurant for once, so we did.   The seating was limited, but the restaurant had a romantic and intimate vibe. There was no barrier between the kitchen and the seating area, so the smells from the kitchen were quite noticeably in the air.   We ordered a few lamb dishes (one with coconut), butter chicken, and I ordered the chickpea curry. I don't eat meat, so I can't speak for the meat dishes. However, my chickpea dish was superbly fresh! My family could't get over how fresh everything tasted. The naan and rice were great, as well. Family got a few servings of rice pudding for dessert, which they loved so much that they decided they needed to take a few for home.  Our waiter was very kind and accommodating, which made the experience even better! I also read in the menu that the head chef has cooked for some very important people throughout his career (  Overall, this is a place worth checking out. Many Indian restaurants of this quality in Toronto aren't halal, so it's a rare gem. The freshness of the food was a standout factor. My advice would be to come with a big appetite and to try a bit of everything- I'm sure you'll find something you'll like."}
{"text":"I ate at Cinamon around 3 years ago and although the food took ages to make, my parents and I thought the taste of the food and service made up for it. Since this place is pretty far away I never came back, despite craving for it occasionally. I finally got a chance to come back and will never go back. This is why: I ordered the chicken tikka and a side of salad, while my brother got the muttar paneer with naan and samosas. The salad came first, which was basically just bitter tasting lettuce with no other vegetable and it was for $5! That salad was worth $0.5 in my opinion!  The samosas were normal...nothing exceptional. Half an hour later our main meal was served (the length of time was expected from previous experience). The paneer was a good serving size for one person and apparently tasted alright too, but the naan was way too tiny for one serving, compared to what I've seen from other restaurants.  Then came my chicken tikka...it was literally bite sized pieces meant for a 3 year old! I was starving and did not expect that at all. Every other Indian restaurant I've been too serves ginormous plates of chicken tikka, but all I got were these puny 4-5 bites, not to mention its price of around $14! I was way to starving and knew that if I order something else it would take another half hour. So I asked for tandoori roti to eat with my chicken, knowing that I'll be eating dry with dry but that's all I could think of ordering that wouldn't take too long. The roti arrived in 5 minutes, and since my meal was dry I asked for some chutneys to accompany it. Apparently I would have to pay for that too! It was just ridiculous to me and I felt like they were basically taking advantage of everyone with their high prices for bites of chicken, salad leaves, and a tablespoon of chutney. I feel like I've been to so many better Indian restaurants with better service, larger portions, and yet much more affordable prices.  Also, this restaurant flaunts on how the chef has cooked for the queen and president, which is really hilarious!  I travelled all this way for such a disappointment. I learned my lesson."}
{"text":"Returned here, and was reassured that my first rave review was not the result of an accident. The food here is genuinely wonderful, and it will be a regular visit for us."}
