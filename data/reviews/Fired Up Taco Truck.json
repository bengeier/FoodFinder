{"text":"The empanadas are fantastic, I have had the veggie and chorizo both so good. I now follow them so I know when they will be in Brooklyn."}
{"text":"My favorite food truck by far.  The ingredients are always fresh, the prices are just right.  Some of the best taco's ive had in Cleveland came from Fired Up. If you see the truck, get it line.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The staff is always friendly and the food is always good. I love the tacos and the chicken loaded fries. They make the food very fast also, and I'm never waiting for long."}
{"text":"Great flavors and the prices aren't too bad, unfortunately the tacos are presented ICE COLD.  Maybe heat the slaw a little?  I'm not a chef, but this truck could be AWESOME, instead it's just mediocre."}
{"text":"I love this place! Sometimes they're parked at the top of my street, and I've been known to drive past and make an instant decision about what I'm having for dinner.  The menu changes periodically, but everything that I've had, I've liked. There's usually a line, but I don't mind waiting. My favorite are their pork tacos! Yum Yum Yum!!!  I believe they do take credit card (I pay cash, so I'm not 100% sure), but I'm pretty sure they can't print receipts - they can either email or text them to you... which is a little weird, but hey, I pay cash and it doesn't matter to me!  One of the best things about this place is that the people are as nice as the tacos are good. No matter how busy they are, you always get a \"have a good day\" or \"enjoy your tacos\" from the guys working, and if there isn't a line, the person taking orders is usually really friendly and has a non-awkward conversation with you.  What I'll never forget is when I stopped by during the winter (when it was ridiculously freezing... you all know the winter we just had), and he saw that I was waiting for my order, and he told me to go wait in my car, and then he ran my tacos out to me in just a t-shirt!!! I think it was less than 10F! That's someone who cares about their costumers!!! They also don't get annoyed if you ask questions or take some time to order.  When they're at their Lakewood location (the Mini-Mart parking lot is where I get them), you can go into the store to get drinks, and there's a small park and baseball diamond that you can eat at.   I really love this food truck! Totally worth trying it out!"}
{"text":"The Fired Up Boys run a great business. The food is unbelievable. When it comes to mexican, its either awesome, or down right disgusting.  They put most of the stationary mexican places to shame.   The chicken taco is wonderful. I love the lime sauce for it. There chipotle sauce too gives any taco with it a kick. The slaw on any of there tacos gives the taco a great crunch. I like that they use slaw over lettuce because my stomach cannot handle lettuce.   But the best item, by far, is the empanadas. They are fried up to perfection. The chorizo combo with the chipotle sauce is kick butt. They made the empanadas smaller since they first started the business, which makes me sad, but still the best product on the menu.  One bit of advice though: Get there early. Especially when they are at Walnut Wed. or the Mini Mart in Lakewood. Those are there two most popular locations and they run out of food fast-- especially the empanadas. Trust me, I've missed them before and nearly cried. But the boys are good guys, know how to run a good business, and run the best food truck in Cleveland.   I'm Fired up for the Fired up Truck!"}
{"text":"I ordered a beef taco and chorizo empanada from the Fired Up Taco Truck at Light Up Lakewood. It was a bit pricey at $4 each.   Although the beef taco was good, I doubt that I would order it again especially since it was just ground beef. I would probably get the chorizo empanada again."}
{"text":"The food was a bit too pricey for what they give you. The tacos were not great and you can get much better elsewhere for a cheaper price. 1/10 would not go again"}
{"text":"Awesome food! I had to try after seeing what my friend ordered. She got the trio of chicken soft tacos with crispy slaw. Also she got a beef burrito which was a good size. She said both were delicious. Their fries were amazing and super fresh. They had a beer batter coating on them which I love! You can order them with sauce on top but I went with traditional! Check them out! They are at Edgewater live on Thursdays!"}
{"text":"Wow. The best tacos. Ever. And that's saying something since I lived in New Mexico for 15 years. So I consider myself a bit of a chili and mexican food connoisseur.  Enough about me, back to the tacos.  We are at the Cleveland orchestra star spangled spectacular at mall B. Great location on the grass between the lake, brown stadium, the new convention center and key bank building. And I should know since I grew up in NYC and attended NY Philharmonic concerts at the sheep meadow in Central Park. But, wait, the tacos! Oh yeah.   I had the chicken corn shell tacos. The double wrapped corn tortillas were sweet, slightly chewy with an awesomely flavorful chipotle aioli sauce. Spicy, with a full roasted chili flavor. Spouse had \"meat\" Americano really it was beef, spouse kept asking for \"meat\". Anyway, it was tasty, spicy but not too, hence the name. Oldest Child, home for the summer before heading off to law school (that's the fact. I'm not just bragging) had fired-up tacos. Same as me but with flour tortillas. Oldest child says good balance of sweet corn, slaw and spicy aioli. Chipotle aioli was their favorite too. Great kid. I'm so proud.   We added an order of next level fries with the same aioli sauce. (I now can spell aioli). Fries were crunchy outside soft inside, not greasy. Wow. Really. Wow.   The only downside is the cost: about $30 for the three of us. But that's to be expected from a gourmet food truck. Fuel cost you know. And they don't serve regular hours like a restaurant. I saw \"Chef\". Great movie and these food truckers hustle. Wonder if Fired Up has cornstarch on board?  Look for these guys. You gotta have these tacos. And that's saying something."}
{"text":"There just isn't a comparison for these tacos. It just just magic in a flour shell. I try to hit these guys up at a location at least once or twice a month. When I moved to the East side last year, I literally craved Fired Up and begged my husband to go to the west side to get these tacos. I'm SO happy we are back on the westside as Fired Up comes to Westlake somewhat often and Lakewood every Tuesday.  I order the seasoned fries and Chicken Fired Up. The fries are somewhat like Rally fries, only without the extra black pepper and lingering nasty oil taste. They are flavor packed but not overwhelming and come with a spicy, creamy aioli sauce. The chicken taco is a layer of well seasoned chicken, crispy fresh slaw (not your  grandma's cole slaw, this slaw has a light sauce and more veggies) then topped with corn and cheese. They don't skirt the quality either. There are other, sit down, places that offer similar food but the quality varies, sometimes I'm given overspiced meat, soggy shells, or the kitchen forgets ingredients. I've never had a single order from this truck that wasn't absolutely art!  I've also tried the traditional beef taco, which was delicous for those who don't like their food with frills. The chorizo empanada, which is not my thing, but spicy and just as delicious as any other empanada I've had."}
{"text":"Like always they never let me down! The fired up boys have outdone themselves once again leaving me satisfied and full. I always get the Americano but decided to add on a fired up. IT WAS THE BOMB DIGGIDY! Thank you boys again for dinner  Sincerely Yours,  An Always Happy Customer"}
{"text":"Loved the environment and service from this truck. You can definitely tell the guys working like their job. Yes the line is long, but shouldn't that tell you something? The long line was worth the wait! These $3 tacos are HUGE so you definitely get a lot of food for your money. The veggie empanada I had was fantastic! A++ on that item. I also ordered the veggie and vegan tacos. The veggie taco was pretty good. I wouldn't think to put BBQ sauce and fries on a taco but the flavors work well together. I would definitely order that again. The vegan taco was lacking for me, though. It tasted mostly like a pile of tomatoes and didn't really have a distinct flavor like I hoped it would. I was hoping for a little bit more creativity with the spices.   Summary: I'm excited to find another great taco truck in Cleveland as I very much miss my taco trucks in Dallas. Definitely want to try the seafood tacos next."}
{"text":"They came by my work two Mondays in a row. First time I skipped out on it because I was under the impression it was cash only. (I was wrong by the way.) My boss came over with a little Styrofoam container, plopped it on my desk and said \"No seriously. You're welcome.\"  I don't argue with free food. So, I absentmindedly took a bite of my pork taco, not even looking away from my screen.   Sweet Mother....    I literally craved those tacos until the next Monday. The slaw was sweet and savory and the pork tasted like a spicy adobo sauce. Everything just came together nicely. The tortilla was fresh and the portions just right. It was out of sheer restraint that I only ordered 2 the next time they came around. Pork and chicken this time. Equally as good! I was trying to decide what I liked better, and it was honestly a draw.   I will have to track them down again by dragging my boyfriend all over Cleveland to find them, OR they can just come back to my place of business. I still need to try the beef tacos, shrimp tacos, and the fries! PLEEEEEEEEASSSE COME BACK!!!!   You guys made Monday's something I looked forward to!"}
{"text":"I went here on a Walnut Wednesday and dang these tacos were good! It was a while ago so I can't remember exactly what they were but I will post a pic."}
{"text":"These guys came out to our event day of the dead and cooked for over 1000 people and sold out. The food was amazing we really enjoyed their customer service we look forward to having them next year.    Georgio Sabino III"}
{"text":"I've never been a huge fan of food places that can drive away before I order, but this place is awesome! We weren't sure what to try, so we basically ran a sampling of everything on the menu. Light, tasty and fresh across the board... Experiment with what suits your tastes, but make sure to have the loaded fries. 2 tacos, an empanada and loaded fries were plenty of food for the two of us, but as god as my witness, we could have eaten this yumminess until we burst! I'd honestly chase this damned truck to get this food!"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos! I had this for the first time today and was really impressed. Reasonably priced and very tasty. I had the chicken and the beef (would probably recommend the chicken, but both were good), and the toppings were very fresh. This experience was complete with them blaring rock music down 9th Street, and the pop-culture stickers on the windows including Nirvana, Heisenberg, etc. were a nice touch. Check it out for sure."}
{"text":"As the food truck market is booming in the west the midwest food truck industry is lackluster, however the few we do have are amazing, I'm happy to be lucky enough to have the Fired Up Taco truck in the city. Easy to find and catch via, there Instagram, twitter or webpage, fresh made tacos, that aren't simply being thrown together the crew is amazing. The food astonishing."}
{"text":"The popcorn shrimp taco was delicious and packed with flavor. However, $4 for a small taco is a bit expensive for me."}
{"text":"Being from California, this isn't what I expected when I heard the words \"Taco Truck.\"  They serve fries and put cole slaw on their tacos.  But somehow, it works.  The food is more Mexican-inspired than Mexican, but it's quite tasty.  The truck is immaculately clean, and the prices aren't bad."}
{"text":"These dudes come to the industrial park I work at every other week. They are insane, and they fucking rule.  Full disclosure - i hate food trucks. I don't know what it is about them that rubs me the wrong way, I just don't like them. The Fired Up Taco Truck on the other hand, is the exception to the rule.  These dudes roll thru in a killer painted truck and post up. They are official. The first time they came through it was a spectacle: three super hyped dudes, blasting dubstep (what sounded like the \"Spring Breakers\" OST), and cooking up a storm. Bass Drops and Fry Basket drops?? I thought it was a mirage. I listen now to the sound of sub bass thunder in the distance on Thursdays, knowing that the saviors haveth arriven. The dude who hands off your food rages with enthusiasm, and makes sure you leave fully psyched to go eat. \"YO EDDIE YOUR TACOS ARE READY MAN!!!!!!!! HAVE A GREAT DAY!!!!!!!!!\" - this is AMAZING. I think when this truck decides to leave it just turns into a pixel cloud and then shoots into the sky while morphing into a dayglow purple comet tail, and then beams down at their next location. I don't know, it just seems sort of magical.  Or maybe they put Molly in my food? Is that why it's so good?? My pupils seemed the normal size when I checked them after a killer lunch, it's not Mali, they just make great food.  Obviously, the work crew and myself were thoroughly stoked to run up at them. Today they were playing \"Thriller\" by Michael Jackson, and it was shitty and rainy - these dudes will not cease to party at ANY cost. They stay on point despite weather conditions, where most of the other trucks that come thru would have canceled on a day like today. A work ethic unparalleled in Cleveland.   I get the vegetarian tacos and they are RAD. Pineapple, KILLER fries (I will come back to these), amazing sauce, etc. They are $4/ea but if you get more you get a price break. The french fries are some homebrew style that is simply untouchable, the fries alone worth it. Just get to this truck if you see it, these dudes rule.   I could go on and on about the Fired Up Truck, but it's an experience and it cannot be embodied on Yelp. It's the only thing that makes Thursday's at work rule."}
{"text":"MOST AMAZING TACOS EVER...and the guys are so nice and friendly, and fast. I need to have these tacos at least once a week!!!"}
{"text":"This place always has the longest line at any food truck event, but the hype is lost on me. I tried three tacos. The traditional, the original fired up taco, and the big shrimpin taco. The traditional was supposed to be an authentic taco, but it didn't taste anything like it. I got it with beef and the marinade was super salty. The fired up taco had too many things going on for me to really enjoy it. The big shrimpin was the only one that I liked, but I don't know if I'd go again just for it.   Can just one of these taco trucks make real Mexican tacos, please?"}
{"text":"In my 53 years I've eaten a lot of nachos, but never as good as the beef nachos I just got off of the Fired Up Taco Truck!  They were phenomenal!"}
{"text":"Work for Pepsi and service a lot of the downtown convenience & drug stores. Walking down E 9th to be greeted by a wonderful smell. Couldn't resist. The chorizo empanadas with chipotle Aoli.... Phenomenal. I hope to catch them again next week. SO good."}
{"text":"I saw a big black truck with the words \"Blah Blah Tacos.\" Once I read \"Tacos\" my eyes perked up, my heart started racing and my feet scurried quickly along. As this occured, I felt guilt seep into my heart. Was I indeed going to cheat on Taco Bell with \"Blah Blah Tacos\"? Would Taco Bell find out and no longer give me cheesy gorditas?  These questions plagued me as I walked towards the food truck. I saw a fairly large menu with various types of tacos, empanadas and fries. I saw \"Mac and Cheese Empanadas\" and I almost collapsed from excitement. I ordered them along with a fired up chicken taco and fish taco. The fish taco stood out - great texture with crispy fish, slaw and corn salsa. The empanadas were good, but a bit doughy.  While Taco Bell remains my boo, Fired up Taco is a nice side boo. Will come here again as summer comes and food truck season is in full swing!"}
{"text":"Meh. I had high expectations , but not a stellar experience. I see photos on here of tacos loaded with ingredients. I had a friend run over to the truck for me. Idk if that was some issue or not. I got one of each style chicken taco, and an empanada.  The tacos I got didn't have half the filling the pics on here have. So, as far as taste vs money spent , I felt a bit ripped off. The empanada was spicy and tasty.  Based on the lack luster taco, i am hesitant to spend my money there for a taco with as much fillings as a Taco Bell regular taco."}
{"text":"Born and raised in Southern California, I tend to have high Mexican food standards. I was really craving Mexican food so tried the Fired Up Taco Truck. The shrimp taco was sadly disappointing! Overbreaded popcorn shrimp, cole slaw (this does not belong in a taco ever!), cold corn, cold tortilla, and too much sauce. I loooove Mexican food, and sadly, my cravings were let down. If you're looking for authentic, keep your expectations realistic here."}
{"text":"They are the reason I go to walnut Wednesday. My favorite is the chorizo empanada, but honestly, they can do no wrong. The entire menu is tasty and they have a great playlist to enjoy while you're waiting. Service is quick and always comes with a smile."}
{"text":"I love the Fired Up Taco truck and I decided to try the Fired Up Mobile Cafe at Walnut Wednesday.  I ordered a grilled burrito.  So disappointing..................It was basically  rice in a flour tortilla. There was no flavor.  This is not what I expect from Fired Up.  For $7 it was totally not worth it.  I am glad that I ordered empanadas too.  They were good but still not as awesome as their tacos.  Why can't both trucks have tacos???"}
{"text":"I was at Public Square one day and saw this taco truck there. After a quick Yelp search on it with good reviews I thought i would try it out. First of all, it isn't cheap ($3 minimum for a taco) which surprised me. Secondly, the tacos aren't very good. The beef you get is just ground beef and the pork is shredded pork. Paying $3 for a street taco is a lot but paying $3 for a ground beef taco is even worse. Would not go back again."}
{"text":"I had to try this food truck after hearing multiple positive reviews about it from my fellow lab members. The first thing that I noticed when I looked at the menu was that every single thing was spicy - everything either had spicy aioli or chorizo.  That's bad news for my girlfriend and I because both of us have fairly low spice tolerances, but we decided to go ahead and try the empanada and the beef taco.    The empanada was very good!  The shell was made of sweet potato starch so it gave a little tinge of sweetness that I liked.  The filling had a bit of spice because of the chorizo.  However, it definitely added to the flavor and didn't overwhelm - and there was spicy aioli on the side for those who did need a bit more of a kick.  My girlfriend felt that it was comparable to the empanadas she would get back in Caliornia.   The beef taco was in a flour tortilla - it was pretty good too, but nothing really to rave about.  The portion sizes are very small - you need to order at least two things to satisfy your palate, maybe three if you are hungry.  The tacos and the empanada are three dollars each."}
{"text":"These guys serve up the best tacos I've had, very consistent, reasonably priced and quick. If you are in Cleveland area, you have to give this food truck a try. Love the veggie tacos and the fries are a must!"}
{"text":"Last week, I tried three tacos from Fired Up.  I ordered a chicken taco, a shrimp taco, and a fish taco.  The fish taco was my favorite, followed by the shrimp.  The chicken was spicy, but the flavor wasn't amazing.  The three tacos were $11, which I found a bit pricey, but that's normal for a food truck. I'd definitely eat here again to try some other tacos."}
{"text":"The long line was worth it! The service was quick. Recommend the vegan and veggie tacos were fresh, filling and so tasty!"}
{"text":"I've been stalking this food truck for a while (really, it's not as bad as it sounds)- and they were finally in my area when I actually was Wednesday! I walked over to walnut Wednesday by reserve square, and the line was insanely long! Many people left the line and went to another truck when their coworkers or friends told them \"there's no line there and the food is great\"- I'm sure the food was fine at the other trucks, but I'm sure there was a never ending line at this truck for a reason!  And 15 minutes later when I took a bite into the taco back at my apartment, I understood why! I got 2 of the veggie tacos-$7 definitely more than enough for a meal! They were unique tacos, too- had black beans, pineapple, FRIES, fried onions, salsa, and cheese. DELISH!!! They also have empanadas and Nachos on the menu.  The only thing I'm sad about is they didn't have the veggie empanadas (I think they rotate through). Can't wait to continue stalking them and try more things on the menu!"}
