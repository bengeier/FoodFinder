{"text":"I just fell in love with that place! Sainte-Cécile Épicerie is not far away from the Jean-Talon metro station, you do have to walk a little bit though.  My son was celebrating his birthday this week, but he's kinda like his mom... The celebration lasts for a week lol! He wanted to go for brunch, I always wanted to try this place, so here we were around 11, curious and hungry. The decor is a mix of rustic and modern, there were a few people at the counter and a couple seated at the entrance, but there was still a little space for the both of us ( translation, it's a delicatessen/meat shop/brunch spot it won't fit large groups).  We were greeted with smiles and our order was taken very quickly, my son ordered a chocolate cookie, an orange juice and their French toast with Cheesecake, Blueberries, Coconut and Lemon and I ordered their Poached egg with leeks and sausage with a latte. When our order came the waiter realized that he asked for the wrong dish and offered it to us as a compensation for the wait, I really appreciated the attention. so we ended up trying their Pancake with herbs and salmon tartar as well! Every single dish was fresh, full of flavour and delicious!  The cherry on the cake was their little cabinet full of little stories and coloring books for kids...That's a big plus for me, my son really enjoyed reading them (and it sure helped with the wait).  Needless to say that I will be back to try the delicatessen part of their store and more of their succulent brunch menu!"}
{"text":"Overpriced bullshit and other froo-froo nonsense. If your idea of lunch involves goat by-products and obscure varieties of lettuce, than this is your place.  Otherwise, keep walking. This restaurant has changed hands more times in the last year than a happy ending massage place.  It's now run by trustfund hipsters that apparently spend all day on their Airbooks ordering varieties of cheese that would make a billygoat puke. \"Why yes, actually, I would love to pay five bucks for a small can of imported fleur-de-lis flavored soda\"   Um, no. This is just another failing business that wants to soak dumb tourists. Twenty bucks says it's boarded up by October."}
{"text":"Sainte-Cecile is a grocery store/eatery with fantastic food. Though there is not a lot of seating there (pretty much just counter space), it is comfortable for a group of two-to-three people. Their carrot soup (the soup of the day) was tasty and I loved it as a side to my smoked salmon sandwich. I am excited by all the prepared foods they had in their fridge and will definitely go back when I'm feeling lazy and don't want to cook."}
