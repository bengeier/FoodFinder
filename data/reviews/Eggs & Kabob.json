{"text":"This placed opened 3 weeks ago and we discovered it last week. Wife has been here 3 times already. Homemade burgers is awesome with an Afghani twist to it. With it being an Afghani restaurant, meat is obviously their specialty"}
{"text":"I was looking for a halal burger place in Brampton, and this is what I found. I went there with my family (wife + kids), and I will say that all of us enjoyed our meals.

It was a Sunday afternoon, not so busy, very casual atmosphere. They have a breakfast, lunch and dinner menu, but they said everything on the menu is available throughout the day. It is a family operated business, and they were very hospitable.

We ordered, Homemade burger, Double Homemade burger, NY Steak on a bun, Chaplee Kabob dinner, and poutine.  All of us enjoyed our meals. They have bottomless coffee and tea, the meat was cooked well. I would say poutine could have been better, but I liked it. I ordered a Double Homemade Burger, and I was truly satisfied by the size and the amount of meat I had."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for breakfast and food was fresh, the home fries were light and crispy, a must go for breakfast!"}
{"text":"This place is very new, replacing an Indian buffet place that was there before.  Lots of windows and places to sit. I tried the Tandoori on a Pita. It was was very good. Big pieces of tender white meat and chunky tomatoes with flavorful onions and soft fresh pita. Price is average for this kind of place. I'd go again. I grabbed one of their take-out menus, as the name implies they also serve all-day breakfast. Or perhaps you would rather have a quarter chicken dinner. It's with checking out."}
{"text":"No qualms what so ever! Clean, quick, fresh delicious food all for a bargain price. 

Didn't want the rice so went for the Beef Kabob Pita (double kabob roll inside), and the chicken souvlaki pita. 

The Beef Kabob was certainly very very well done, the chicken souvlaki well done chicken roll. The kabobs aren't thin like usually found. 

My one tiny gripe, the mayo used inside the wraps is too sweet, please change that. Second definitely need some hot sauce!"}
{"text":"What a delightful surprise.  This place is my new go to spot! Greeted by Naseem who was extremely nice and suggested that I should get the tandoori plate with rice and the Greek salad.  The Afghani rice was mind blowing, pillowy soft mountains of yum with the beautifully neutral and not overly sour tzatziki sauce. The salad was fresh and delicious, Garlic bread was on point and the chicken was amazing.  Come here you won't regret it."}
