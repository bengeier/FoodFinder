{"text":"Random hole in the wall place right next to Kazu. Since I love hole in the wall type places I had to try! They serve some lebanese style sandwiches but done in a way Ive never seen before. I remember watching him make my kafta sandwich the first time thinking \"oh boy\". He spreads a layer of the meat (raw) on to a pita then cooks it in a panini press. He then takes that and wraps it in another pita and tops it with french fries, a creamy coleslaw, pickled turnips , mustard and I believe garlic mayo. Sounds very odd but it works! I actually enjoyed it very much and went back a couple days later to try the soujouk and falafel which were also both good! I highly recommend if you are in the area and want to try a different take on lebanese fare. Very reasonably priced too!"}
{"text":"Buba's a hole in the wall, Lebanese snack spot on St-Catherine street near Kazu. Simple menu nothing complicated, Lebanese burgers style, kafta, sudjuk, i try it many times and it'a always a pleasure. First you should try the kafta and the sudjuk with a spicy touch"}
{"text":"I have to say i overlooked this little spot for so long and i regret it. This Lebanese street food spot tucked in a little corner is VERY good and tasty, the chicken shawarma wrap is very reminiscent of Lebanon, this is very rare in Montreal as nobody seems to know how to wrap a shawarma in this city. Def recommended for a quick meal. Not pricey!"}
