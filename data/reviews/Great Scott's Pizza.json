{"text":"The best pizza for takeout / delivery in Mount Horeb. We love the Mac and cheese pizza and other specialties. Quick, easy delivery with good service... Can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Great Scott's is the best option for pizza in town. We've always had great service and only once have we had a pizza that wasn't the greatest quality. When we called to comment about it, the owner remade our pizza and delivered it to us himself!   They have a variety of specialty pizzas, or you can make your own. The pizza is always hot and fresh with the right combination of ingredients. We prefer the hand tossed crust, which isn't too thick, but still has good substance.   Delivery service is fantastic! The delivery drivers are very nice and polite. They are always prepared with a pen (if needed to sign a CC slip) or readily available change for cash. They have always been very genial with us.   Great Scott's is my family's go-to place when we've had a long day and don't feel like cooking, or we are having company over and want an easy dinner. The food is fresh and hot, well prepared, reasonable in cost, and delivered pretty quickly. Having tried the other places for pizza in Mount Horeb (pizza hut and Grumpy Troll) I definitely recommend Great Scott's over the competition."}
{"text":"Order from Great Scott's regularly (every couple of weeks) and have never had a bad experience with them.  Orders are always right, always get to me quickly, and the service has always been friendly.  Love some of their specialty pizzas like the buffalo chicken pizza.  Their prices are higher than your going to pay at the national chain that just opened in Mount Horeb, but there's something to be said for paying a little more to support a quality local business -- besides that, the pizza is a lot better from Great Scott's."}
{"text":"Used Yelp to find a highly rated restaurant in Mount Horeb and was very satisfied. Location, service and price were acceptable. We used the takeout option and ordered at the counter. Pizzas were made with fresh ingredients in front of me and were ready in 15 minutes. The pizza was exceptional. Great Pesto specialty pizza and a simple Italian sausage and cheese were both a 9 out 10."}
{"text":"If we are going to order Pizza, it has to be Great Scotts.  Got to go local, not a national chain for pizza. Love the small town Pizza shop feel with plenty of specialty pizzas - non traditional and the regular toppings too. Friendly service on the phone, delivery service is quick and the drivers are friendly. We love the thin crust pizzas the best.  I love the vegetarian green goddess pizza.  But there are so many others to choose from.   They also offer salads and toasted subs. I hope they keep it going and love all the support they give the community."}
{"text":"Will never go back. They screwed up on my pizza's, which I didn't realize until I got home. I called to complain. The girl that answered put me through to the manager/owner. I explained that we received our pizzas but one of them was cold and dried out looking (looked like it had been sitting on the rack for an hour) and the other was missing most of the toppings. He responded that the taco pizza should be cold because the lettuce would wilt otherwise....and the other pizza he said wasn't his fault since they went off our ticket.  He kept saying that it wasn't the company's fault for the mix up. I told him then I'll never comeback. After that he finally says that if I didn't tell him I wasn't coming back he would have given me a $5.00 coupon for next time."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza!! Highly recommend their bacon cheeseburger pizza. Instead of marinara they make a ketchup/mustard sauce that really makes the pizza..i mean besides it being loaded with hamburger, bacon, cheese and pickles! Also consider ordering their wings. Blows a lot of places out of the water. They are huge!   You only lose a star because your staff has turned into teenagers that don't have the best customer service training. Not much urgency..."}
{"text":"I'm giving them three stars, but I want to stress that the quality of the pizza is closer to two--the extra star is for the outstanding service.  My friend and I spent the day biking from Madison to Mt. Horeb, hoping to go to the Grumpy Troll for pizza and beer, but the pizzeria was closed! We ended up heading over to this place for lunch (then back to the GT for beer).  Service was outstanding--overly nice staff, pizza came out quickly, etc.  We got a pizza with jalapenos and pepperoni on one side, ham (I'm a horrible Jew) and pineapple on the other. The jalapenos and pineapple definitely came from the can. That's a huge, huge no-no in my book.  We went with the thin crust, which was definitely a premade crust. The pizza was made on a conveyor belt oven, which most pizza people consider bush league (I know I do).  The pizza was fine. We were starving from biking 25+ miles, so we plowed through the whole thing! The ingredients here, though, were definitely not fresh. The crust was too thin, like a cracker. We did get free water bottles, though!  The total for a medium was $13.75. That's alright, although I think a chain like Dominos is pretty close to them in terms of quality. This certainly isn't five star pizzas, and a place like Great Scott's wouldn't last a month back home on the East Coast.  Next time I go to Mt. Horeb, I'm going to stick to the Grumpy Troll--their pizza is better and there's beer there. Considering the offerings in this tiny town for pizza, this stuff is alright."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Mt. Horeb.  I've never had them mess up my order and the ingredients seem fresh. I order from here very frequently and I've never had a bad pizza. For a small town like Mt Horeb, I'm thankful for this place because it beats the chain options!"}
