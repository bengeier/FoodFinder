{"text":"Great environment and amazing staff !! the Sushi was great!  I eat Sushi 2-3 times a week and this will now be one of my spots.. The had some great roll.. Try the Cruz roll it was yummy and I'm picky about salmon it will make or break if i go and theirs was fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Great food!! Love this place. Happy hour is awesome. The staff is so nice especially Cat and Ken. That's for providing us a great meal every week!"}
{"text":"Food is great, however the ambiance is terrible.  I don't understand why Japanese restaurants think that they need to have a television in the dining room. The yellowtail plays loud music making conversation very difficult The last time we were going there to eat they had loud rap music playing, we turned around and left."}
{"text":"Yellowtail Sushi & Steak gets a perfect 5 stars from me - here's the executive summary: 1.  Very fresh tasting sushi 2.  Awesome, awesome staff - always friendly, prompt and make you feel like family 3.  Very good menu top to bottom - creative rolls, plenty of cooked food too 4.  Great environment, you can sit at the sushi bar, dining room, the regular bar area or out on the patio 5.  Ken, the head chef, is the man - great guy and one amazing sushi chef  And here's the long version: I've been to Yellowtail several times now in the last month.  I wish I would have stopped into this place sooner.  I'm amazed at how good and fresh the sushi is here.  Ken, one of the owners, does not compromise on quality of the sushi.  Everything is ALWAYS amazingly fresh.  I really enjoy Sashimi and Yellowtail Sushi & Steak, without a doubt, is the best.  Their rolls are very creative and the way he prepares the rice is always perfect and consistent.  Some places have rice that can be too sticky but Ken puts the extra effort into the way it is prepared and it really make a big difference in how the rolls taste, they're just perfect - I've literally never had a roll that I liked just as much as my Sashimi and I like pretty much all of them at Yellowtail.  Because of his great focus on quality the food might not always come out immediately but it comes out plenty fast enough and it always melts in your mouth.  He also does an extremely good job at making spicy sushi - his spicy tuna is actually spicy (not too spicy, just right)...If you want to step it up a notch from there he has a Caliente roll with jalopeno and other spices that is the best roll I've ever had in my life.  The Diablo roll is another great one for the spicy lovers.  Again, Ken, just does not compromise with quality - the rolls are presented nicely on the plate and extremely good.  He has an awesome cooked menu too (steak, surf and turf, and much more!)... so great when you're going out with family members or children who aren't quite ready for sushi yet.  The Service there is also great!  Consistent and friendly, prompt service.  The last time I was in it was for my birthday and we had at least 15 people there.  Our waitress was great - I had a cold beer in my hand throughout the night as she was checking on us often.  Also, take some time to get to know the head chef and owner, Ken.  He is an awesome guy who's funny and just a great person.  He even does shots with us from time to time - he and his staff make the place fun and I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"First time here. Won't be last. Popped in for some yellowtail and a beer. Amazingly fresh and a very inviting atmosphere. Come here! I will absolutely be back and soon. Happy hour specials, too. I thought it was a very warm restaurant."}
{"text":"My go to sushi spot.  I like sitting at the bar and ordering. The bartenders are so friendly and the sushi is really delicious. It's clean and cute on The inside. Everybody is always checking on you to see if you need anything. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Really?  This place is called Yellowtail and they don't have hamachi kama on the menu.  If I could give this place zero stars, I would.  The service was HORRIBLE and the food was just as bad.    Here's why: 1)  It took an hour to get our food after ordering.  We saw some of our group's plates just sitting there for awhile before our waitress decided to bring them to us. 2.  Our hot food was not hot anymore by the time it reached the table. 3.  The waitress got my friend's order wrong. 4.  The fish on our rainbow roll was not fresh.  It actually look \"wilted\" (for lack of a better term). 5.  At the near end of our meal, my other friend still did not get her roll.  She was told it was going to be another 10 minutes since the twin volcano roll takes long to bake.  Really? 6.  Some of our bills were incorrect (but thankfully no gratuity was added). 7.  The waitress tried to guilt trip my husband about the $1 tip we left (it was actually $2...which she didn't even deserve and I wish we could take it back). 8.  All this...and we were the only people in the restaurant.  I'll never come back here."}
{"text":"By far my favorite sushi restaurant in Phoenix. I like it better than Yen and all the others around in the area. Ken is awesome at what he does. Keep it up."}
{"text":"Feels dumpy and initially this place blends into any of the innumerable strip mall worlds offered by lame-O Phoenix. It turned out to be a great experience. Ambiance lacks, servers were only okay. But our sushi chef Mike was a great host and the 420 Roll was an easy recommend. This might be our new Phx hang #holeinthewallgoodness"}
{"text":"Went a couple of weeks ago for the first time, met the sushi chef (ACE) was an awsome time with great service. Dj is different but the good is amazing and beer is cold.  Going back tonight!"}
{"text":"CALAMARI STEAK! Went back for more of their delicious & hard-to-find-in-the-Valley grilled Calamari steak.  It is extraordinarily good as were their sauteed veggies. Hope they get store front signs because it's hard to tell there here. They're on a curvy-busy road so not easy to look while driving."}
{"text":"I wouldn't know how is the sushi since it didn't come 40 minutes after we ordered it (by walking up to the waitress and handing her the paper, cause she wasn't coming to take that order) and I couldn't wait any longer. I saw some other people leave before us because no one came to take their order for a while. another couple was sitting there before we got there and didn't get any food until we left. We did get one entree 25 minutes after we ordered it and that was good....Not sure what was going on over there - there didn't seem to be a manager; just 3 waiters, 2 of which seemed like they' are trying to work and the third waitress seemed like she couldn't care less, even when we told her that we are leaving."}
{"text":"My experience here has been good when I ate in. However, the last take out order I placed was a disappointment. The yellowtail sashimi was very good, but the rest of my sushi was not fresh. It should never have left the restaurant and the owner would have agreed with me. He was not present at that time. I spent $30 that day and have not returned. I no longer trust the product they serve."}
{"text":"love this place!!! I took my wife here to try sushi for the first time and she fell on love!!! My favorite is the dragon rollbthat I get everytime.. with avacado on the side since my wife doesnt like it. The prices are reasonable and the drinks are cheap. Where else can you get a blue moon for 4 bucks when it isnt happy hour. The staff is wonderful, they greet you when you come and leave. Now we go there about two times a week. I recommend this place to everyone who wants great sushi and service!!!"}
{"text":"The goods:  Service,  by the servers and sushi chefs were good.  Happy hour sake & specials pretty reasonable.  The food:  Most of the sushi was just average and some was not good.  Overall I would go back, but only for a few items that you know will be good.  For a new place the decor could be much better."}
{"text":"What a great place and best customer service! My wife and I came in just before closing and they said no problem. The sushi is great and large portions. The owner Ken is totally cool and our waitress too. Thank you Yelp people, you have not failed us yet."}
{"text":"We tried this out one day after being disappointed by our regular place the last two visits. Yellowtail is awesome! The waitress we had was super cool, very informative about what rolls we should try. The owner came by to chat with us about our meal and let us know if we didn't like anything we could trade it out. I like that he gets to knows his customers. Very cool. The Swagzilla and Cruz roll were amazing. We also tried the 420 roll but it wasn't my thing. My daughter loved the macaroni and cheese roll, which is cool they have that due to so many kids wanting mac n cheese everywhere they go, haha. I would most definitely recommend this place to any sushi lover."}
{"text":"This was close to home and just decided to stop for dinner. Glad we did. Sushi was great. Very fresh and presentation was great. Prices were very reasonable compared to other similar spots. This is our new spot to go for sushi."}
{"text":"I've been here over a dozen times. Never had a bad meal or poor service. Staff go above and beyond to make sure you are happy. Sushi is SO good. I love the Diablo Roll. Happy hour is awesome, check out their FB page"}
{"text":"My first visit and my husbands third. It's our Favorite Sushi Restaurant. From the friendly atmosphere to the generous portions of fish, everything was excellent!"}
{"text":"Avid sushi lover...took my 13 year old daughter..also a sushi lover...and had a fantastic meal! Server was friendly, helpful and speedy. Sashimi was fresh, rice was perfect and they had uni which is hard to find up to my freshness standards if even available! Will definitely return!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The same sushi man just told me ...\" Here, we are like family\"..,and gave this wonderful non-alcoholic drink. And this ladies and gentlemen is how you deliver great customer service and a great lasting impression. And yes their rolls are amazing! No fishy taste! Boom! That never happens on AZ!"}
{"text":"Yellowtail has great sushi for AZ!! Their fish was quite fresh and the sashimi presentation was beautiful. They had many unique rolls and several sake options. My server was quite attentive and she took excellent care of her customers. The prices weren't too high for the quality, thus I plan to return the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This is our 3rd visit here. In the past we came for the excellent sushi. Tonight we ended up here while looking for a new Asian restaurant. Every Asian restaurant near us was getting terrible reviews on Yelp so we came here. Tried the Monkey Brains and Veggie Fried Rice. Both were outstanding!! I did not believe fried rice with no meat could be so flavorful! Absolutely delicious! We rounded out the meal with a cucumber salad and a Tootsie roll. A great meal, can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Yellowtail sushi has the most amazing calamari app , so crunchy and crisp. Makes my mouth water. There sushi and other meals were also very tasteful. Great friendly service. I'm very happy with my service while visiting and that it is close to my house. It's hard to find good sushi places around Glendale."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of ordering a steak in a sushi place. They had several steaks on the menu and I ordered the NY strip. I imagine my surprise when it came out and it wasn't a strip at all. It was 15 little half burned meat nuggets instead. I was so surprised I asked the waitress just to be sure that I had gotten the strip and not the Mongolian BBQ also on the menu. She assured me that it was indeed the strip. I took 3 bites and started eating of my husband's sushi and sashimi platter. The tuna roll was amazing. Delicate flavors all melting together, omg yum. The sushi was fresh and tasty too.  Why two stars if the sushi was fresh and fantastic? Because they named their restaurant Yellowtail Sushi and STEAK, and my $24 steak was inedible."}
{"text":"This is my new sushi Joint.  I used to like kawaii a lot but it is to far from where I am now.  The service is cool.  I even recommended they start doing 3.00 fireball shots and they did.  Good sushi is hard to come by in AZ...  This place in California would be so so but its good for here."}
{"text":"Best sushi in town,ask for Ken owner he will make sure your happy . Highly recommended"}
{"text":"The chicken egg roll is Amazing  The Arizona roll is Excellent too this place does the best sushi in town"}
{"text":"Good food, friendly staff, and prompt service. I had the Diablo Roll roll and the Fancy Lady Roll.  Both specialty rolls were delicious.  The spicy and sweet flavors seemed balanced out."}
{"text":"Great the service is awesome! Recommend the miso soup, baked green mussels and the Louie Roll. Don't miss out  this is a must for anyone who likes Sushi!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going to Yellowtail for over a year and have always had the best experience.  We have never had anything but absolutely the freshest and most delicious sushi (favorite is the Derby Roll) Beau our server always makes us feel welcome and Ken  the owner always goes out of his way to come over sit with us and chat...truly feels like our own little \"Cheers\" environment.  We have noticed lots of other regulars being treated just as warm and friendly as us.  Great place to go, Great food, Great People!"}
{"text":"Best sushi in the west valley that I've found so far. Been to Kabuki off Thunderbird, Squid Ink, Kawaii etc.. this place has fat rolls and great fish. Yummy udon bowls and some of the best hamachi I've found. Little pricey but you're not gonna leave hungry."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Over priced in my opinion.  Service okay.  Ambiance was nice. Sushi was okay. Kung pao and fried rice was WAY salty. Nothing to write home about. Probably will not return."}
{"text":"Great place and friendly service!  Had the steak teriyaki plate and a vegas roll, no complaints on either!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.   Great sushi.   Good variety of rolls.   Ask for the poke salad it was awesome.   Good happy hour before 6."}
{"text":"Service and food was excellent. Wife loved the sushi and my Mongolian Beef with filet was awesome. All washed down with some happy hour drink specials, this was a great first visit. We'll definitely go back soon."}
{"text":"This place is a great little hangout. The reason I don't rate this 5 stars is because of a small problem. We came into the place and the air conditioner was way to loud and  was freezing all of the people's toes off. The service was just okay, but it was busy that night so I can get past that. The food was amazing and that's why this place got 4 stars for me."}
{"text":"Love the service, environment, and the rolls were incredible!!! Felt very comfortable and also professional. We will be back for sure, probably one of our new favorites!"}
{"text":"Service suck !!!!! Waitress did not know the menu!!!!!! We ordered the teppan, and it comes with soup, salad, your choice of rice vegetables,and the entree. Well she kept asking If we wanted soup when our order said it came with soup!!!!! When we were ordering she had to open the menu to look at what we were ordering. We never got our soup, the cook/ manger came out to ask if we got our soup and salad and I said we got our soup ( miso soup was way to salty) but no salad. We already had our entree in front of us so I did not want the salad anymore.  And our silverware ( a fork ) was rusted. This was my second visit here cause the first experience was okay!!!!! The first visit I sat at the bar and I was treated great and the food was good!!!!!! But the second time we went I felt like I was robbed for 50 bucks for trash !!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm honestly surprised by the reviews for the restaurant. My husband and I went for dinner. We were immediately taken back by the smell. Too hungry to turn around and find another place to eat - we sat down to order. We asked for two orders of Nigiri from their happy hour menu. Yes - the price was great, but that is because you get half an order. We ordered two other rolls that were sub par. Very disappointing. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Was a 5 up until yesterday when I stopped in for lunch. Our waiter, Cody, was great. The sushi was not the same at all, though. I think the newer sushi chef made my sushi and it was not cut right and very skimpy portions compared to the usual here. I ordered a few of my favorites (uni, salmon egg, etc.) and ended up with a teeny tiny portion of each. Also, the rolls were not rolled correctly (falling apart and on an angle). Sadly, if this was the first time at Yellowtail, I would not return and I'd wonder why the reviews were so great. I hope Ken is reading this and I'm sure he'll fix the issue as he loves his business. I'll be sure to let you know, Ken, next time I'm there (unfortunately, you were not there yesterday when we stopped in)."}
{"text":"Took my Sweetheart here for Valentine's day. The words awesome, amazing, brilliant, breathtaking are far understatements for the food, the service, the entire experience.  She loved the sushi & told the waitress it was the second best thing she ever tasted. (You can guess the first, well played baby, well played). I don't like sushi unless it's well done so I had the serlion steak with vegetables. We had 2 chicken & 1 avocado appetizer and soup. Real green tea with a deep taste. My food was so marvelous I tipped my cook. This place is on my permanent go to list."}
{"text":"forget the others Yellowtail is where it's at Ken is awesome Kat is always a friendly face. My favorite little sushi spot"}
{"text":"It was great! The sushi was super fresh, and the flavors of the rolls were very refreshing and delicious. We sat at the bar and the Chef was very friendly and took great care of us. The server was very attentive and friendly as well. Overall a great experience and we will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch, great lunch specials, sushi was delicious, and the service was really good!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I stopped in last night for a quick meal before heading off to an event. I was in a rush, and my sushi came out quickly and perfect. I ordered the Arizona Roll and it was amazing!! I live 30 min away and I would definitely make the drive back just for this sushi."}
{"text":"love this place, the food is great, the owner gets to know you.  I walk in and the owner always comes to my table to chat. remembers me and what we have talked about.  This place is fantastic.  Best sushi on this side of town!"}
{"text":"Love this place sushi chef makes anything you want even when it's not on the Menu. Coming from the 808 state good sushi is a must have.. Found YellowTail Sushi and this is gonna be one of my top sushi restaurant.. Sushi chef mad me my Ahi Poki Bowl w/spicy eel sauce jus how I wanted and it was so (in Hawaii we say ONO) and hope one day it goes on the MENU and you need to try or jus tell the sushi chef to make you one!! Lol.. Great place friendly staff!! Will be back soon Mahalo!!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, but that's all it is.  Won't go there again.  Service is okay, I ended up having to serve myself because our waitress was too busy.  It's not her fault though, I think they are just understaffed when I was visiting.    The manager also failed to get back to us at the oyster pricing, then again, it's not a big deal.  I wouldn't eat oyster around this area anyway.  If you are looking for decent oysters in Peoria/Glendale area (not good, just decent), then Angry Crab at Cactus is your next choice...but that place is always packed and oyster prep. can be questionable sometimes too.  Sushi and sashimi aren't great.  Horrible cut, but decent quality & freshness.  Fresh wasabi will cost $2 here at Yellowtail, meaning I would rather go to Osaka Japanese Steak House (5 minutes from here) than go to Yellowtail Sushi & Steak.  Osaka won't charge you for fresh wasabi.  For this reason, Yellowtail got dropped to 1-star since I gave Osaka 2-star.  But if you are willing to drive further, then Kabuki will be the right fit (if you like this kind of food).  Same price range, but better food."}
{"text":"Great miso soup, the salad is also great. The sushi is the best in the west valley."}
{"text":"Service is awesome and the food is delicious. Won't go anywhere else the staff is bar none the best sushi place in Glendale / Peoria"}
{"text":"This is good sushi and especially good for the west side of town.  Very fresh.  They have blue fin once a month at a great price which is hard to find at other sushi restaurants.  Sushi chefs are friendly and helpful.   Also great atmosphere for watching sports etc.  Definitely recommend as the alternatives in the area absolutely don't compare in food quality."}
{"text":"LOVED this place!! My husband and I were up on the West side of town for the evening and just happened across this place. Walked in and were greeted right away and sat us at the sushi bar. one of the sushi chefs introduced himself as Ken. Very friendly. Asked if it was our first time in. We had a few rolls, the DJ roll and the Sunrise roll, plus my hubby ordered the Blue Fin special. I am not a huge fan of straight sushi/negiri and I thought it was fantastic!! After we had finished, Ken made us a special roll. No idea what it was called, but it had crab and scallops with sriracha and fried sweet potato strings on top. That roll was off the charts! I would request that roll again in a heartbeat! Everything we ate was fantastic! Great food, great customer service. Awesome awesome awesome :)"}
{"text":"We ordered take out. Seems like the best in the area so far. The sushi is fresh and they have excellent variety. It's expensive so won't be back often but highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute joke of an establishment.  Not only was the staff as unaware and disrespectful as an over-tired toddler, but the cuisine screamed E. coli.  If you enjoy the company of people who act/look like they were just released from prison this is surely the place for you.  I was appalled that I actually give money to this disgraceful disaster of a business.  By far one of the most revolting experiences in dining I have ever had.    DO NOT GO HERE!!"}
{"text":"Best sushi place period\".\"!!!! We are what you call regulars Dragon Roll is the best in town!! The staff is the business ken is the man we bring people here and always shows them a good time I rate this place 10 stars and trust me I come here over twice a week! I made a yelp account just to rate this place!!"}
{"text":"Really cool sushi bar. Definitely on the more expensive side. But their rolls are unique and the staff is nice!"}
{"text":"I do enjoy the food most importantly my company favorite place for a steak and shrimp and lobster tail always been satisfied with the customer service"}
{"text":"Yellowtail has best sushi and prices in the state of AZ. Ken is a great owner and takes care of his customers. Kat and Emily are friendly and have service to all customers.  Yellowtail, Ahi, Toro is the best.  Don't forget the golden avocado, pad Thai, and all different sushi selections. We have gone to this restaurant for 3 years and recommend the whole family trying it out!"}
{"text":"Ok wth Yelp!! What a disappointment.  Walking in there was a weird smell but we still decided to give it a try based on all the reviews. The waitress was sweet but not sure she knows how to manage her time as we never received refills on our water cups even though she kept saying she would bring them./  She then took a while to bring back boxes which we later decided we didn't want because to be honest the food was not great. Everything was toooooo sweet. I didn't feel anything that we order was good. I was very disappointed in the lack of flavors since everything just had a super sweet sauce. The only reason they are getting a 2 Star instead of a 3 is because the spicy tuna roll was really good but other than that nothing else was worth coming back.  The orange chicken had a burnt sweet taste to it which made it impossible for my daughter to eat( and she loves sweet food) not sure why there are so many good reviews as this place is not good."}
{"text":"This is the best sushi I have had since moving here from San Francisco. I loved it! The waitress was so nice and helpful with what her favorites were, and everything we tried was delicious. I will definitely be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Always accommodating & friendly.  We bring our kids & they love it too.  If you prefer lo-carb, order the Lollipop Roll - Yum! Great, fresh food!"}
{"text":"We love this sushi restaurant.  The saki is warm and the food is delicious.  We've been frequenting this establishment for a couple of years now and haven't been disappointed yet.  If you love fresh sushi you'll love this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Why does this place even say steakhouse on the name?  Ridiculous. Place smells of sewer when you walk in. I'll never set foot in this establishment again. What a joke. You know what I won't be having here? Steak. Not even on the menu but on the name out front. Bogus."}
{"text":"This place is pretty darn good, order the golden avocado it is worth it and so good. Music is always a little loud for my taste but it is a bar restaurant so it is understandable. A little pricey but happy hour prices are great."}
{"text":"Great food! Great service. Prices are a little high so we have to spread out our visits. Thumbs up for sure"}
{"text":"Super happy to have a sushi place in the neighborhood! I've been there once and  Livingsocial has a deal right now which I couldn't resist.   Check it out - you pay $10 for $20 worth of food: http://t.livingsocial.com/deals/235346?ref=email-jp&rpi=47072500  Needless to say, I bought it and will be back to try out some other rolls.  Atmosphere is nice and customer service was excellent. Will def be back :"}
{"text":"This is by far my best sushi restaurant I continually keep coming back to. Their Dragon roll and Diablo roll are to die for. Waiters Beau and Cat are Absolutely the Best.  If you want good atmosphere and Great Food this is the place."}
{"text":"I come here every once in a while when I'm shopping at arrowhead mall. I always come in during lunch. Waiting for table is minimal. Drinks are quick and refills are quick and then some visits not so quick.  Food is good, but the portions like everyone is saying are smaller then most sushi places I have been to. It's a little pricey but aren't all sushi places. The decor is what is cool and interesting to look at. Service has been great every time I have come in. Sometimes the server or chef forgets something that happens to all of us. Overall it's a good place for sushi."}
{"text":"The staff and food are the best!  We have been going for almost 4 years and find it hard to go to any other Sushi restaurants as they do not compare to Yellowtail. Ken is great, Kat and Daniel are the best for service. We will recommend Yellowtail any day."}
{"text":"Yelp says \"you've checked in two times. What keeps you coming back?\" and the answer is -- I was craving sushi and there is nothing else near my office.  Everything about this place is just okay. The salmon sashimi was fresh, but pretty expensive in my opinion.  Salmon sashimi having the quality \"fresh\" is mandatory, not a compliment or above average.   I probably wouldnt recommend this place. In fact, I'll probably search for something else and be willing to exlore unchartered territory next time I get a craving for sushi when I'm at work.  I miss my lunch options in Scottsdale. Is the weekend almost here?"}
{"text":"The sushi here is super fresh and delicious. The lunch Bento boxes are enough for 2 and are a great value. $5 Sake bombers with the larger size Asian beers completes the meal! Try to sit away from the West wall as it can get a little warm.  Oops! The sake bombers are 8 dollars, five dollars on happy hour."}
{"text":"This was my favorite sushi spot until they got rid of their reverse happy hour and started closin down whenever they want."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to this sushi place. We just randomly found it on Yelp and figured with many good reviews it would be okay. Well, after 3 rolls, $45, and two unsatisfied customers later- we may never go back. All I can say is that I was so let down! It was today around 5:15pm, we were the only two people in the whole restaurant, which was weird to us. We got seared tuna, and two other rolls. The fish was very chewy, almost hard. It was not soft. My husband and I ate the rolls, but literally I felt like every roll was just blah :( they all tasted the same, no special flavor and just chewy fish. The sushi chefs really didn't even say hi to us. The waitress was nice. And at the moment the fish is not sitting well. Is Sunday a bad day for fish here? I just felt like for our 1st visit here, our experience was very average and a huge bummer. I truly wanted amazing sushi and left feeling upset that we just spent that much $$ on dinner and we didn't even enjoy it. Sucks."}
{"text":"Fish was fresh.  Good variety of rolls.  Monkey Brain appetizer was great."}
{"text":"Yellowtail is a hidden gem!   The sushi is excellent and fresh. I especially like the Love Love roll and it is SPICY! love the Love Love roll? That just sounds funny.  The beef yaki soba is one of the best I have ever had and the golden avocado is the stuff romance novels are made of.  And the icing on the cake is Ken (the owner) is SUPER nice. He always comes out to say hello and ask us how the food was. Last time he brought out a ice cream sunday for my boy. Well played sir!  Definitely on my list of favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"The owners of Yellowtail Sushi are extremely sweet; my bf and I went on a Sunday and surprisingly it was dead.  We really weren't sure why but it's a sin they do not get more business.  The food was delicious, the atmosphere was cozy, prices are right in line, and (most importantly) happy hour specials ALL-DAY Sunday through Thursday.  I highly recommend Yellowtail Sushi if you are aching for some tasty food!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Ken the owner is always accommodating to my picky order. Waitress: Kat always on the ball! Prices are great."}
{"text":"I tried to order lunch from this place over the phone & the girl put me on a 10 minute hold. I tried calling back multiple times & the line rang busy. When I finally arrived at the restaurant the girl was just standing around talking. So I try to place an order for teppanyaki & she tells me they don't serve teppanyaki & haven't for the past couple of months. Weird because I've ordered teppanyaki from this place more than once within the last month. It also would've been nice if she actually got back to the phone & I could've saved myself the drive."}
{"text":"We are so very impressed with Yellowtail and already can't wait to come back! Service was, however, EXTREMELY slow. We waited over 5 minutes for drinks and over 10 minutes just for our check. We were also told we couldn't get the happy hour price because our server rang in a large sake to share instead of two small, which was disappointing. We got another tables sushi order and the server never came to tell us or apologize. I'm under the impression our server was very new.. Therefore we aren't giving up because of the service flaws. Excellent food!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best group of sushi Chiefs I've ever met. Ken (the owner) and Ace are just amazing. They take the time to talk to you and get to know you if you sit at the sushi bar. My boyfriend and I have become regulars here and I don't plan on going to any other place. They are absolutely amazing!"}
{"text":"kick ass product. i live in the pacific NW and have had my share of tasty fish. but never have i found blue fin tuna on the menu. it was a beautiful color, generous sashimi portion; and the fresh wasabi -- damn! front staff cody nailed all the details of customer service. from greetings to salutations ... he made my bride and me feel special and unique for a minute. righton cody! cheers yellowtail. i do not enjoy phoenix but i'll always look for a yellowtail !"}
{"text":"Pretty darn tasty!  And this coming from a girl who just started eating sushi. The Golden Avacado was AMAZING!!!!  I WISH I could replicate at home!"}
{"text":"The food at Yellowtail is great! I love that they serve not only sushi but also Chinese food, tepenyaki, and even American food.  They also have a great kids menu. Basically the whole family can go there even if some aren't sushi lovers.  Everything we've tried is delicious! The service there is friendly and helpful. The food comes out fast and they always make sure you are doing okay.  They also have a good Happy Hour menu with a lot of variety and $2 draft beer.   My whole family definitely recommends Yellowtail!"}
{"text":"Awesome local sushi. Very friendly and sushi is top notch. This is our new favorite place."}
{"text":"On my last day visiting from S. California my best friend and I were craving (as every girl would lol) so she spotted a place and took us to Yellowtail. I was pretty excited to order Monkey Brain, it was her first time trying and she LOVED IT! We ordered a few rolls and we took our time savoring the flavors.  Living in SoCal I've tried plenty of sushi spots and this place has sparked my taste buds! Haha the quality of the ingredients complimenting one another was worth my last day and definitely coming back!  Also the decorations in the bathroom was so cute!"}
{"text":"Tried 3 rolls, all were great. Had the LJ, New Orleans and Cinco de drinko, all very different and very good.  Wait staff helpful and very friendly."}
{"text":"I've been here multiple times and every time I go, the service just gets worse and worse every time and I'm sick of it. The sushi isn't bad though, it's just the service is trash"}
{"text":"Cool spot. Great happy hour prices. The tootsie roll is badass! g"}
{"text":"Of all the Sushi restaurants we have visited in Arizona, this one has been the best.  Immediately greeted upon arrival.  Friendly owner, very personable.  Food was delicious.  Even accommodated my little 3 year olds request for a drink like mine. She had a \"mocktail\"  We live in Seattle and eat sushi once a week, this place was delicious and I will bookmarking it. For when we are in Arizona."}
{"text":"Updated Review 8/15/17: we came here today and was actually quite disappointed. My favorite roll is the philly and today it smelled very funny. Just off. I didn't even smell it but it was strong, I smelled it from putting in my mouth. Also tasted weird. Like it wasn't fresh. I couldn't even eat another piece. The whole roll went to waste. The avocado was brown. Presentation is everything with sushi and today almost makes me not want to return. Disappointed to be changing my 5 stars to 3.   I am always hesitant with trying a new sushi place because of the fish quality. We normally go to a certain sushi joint but this has easily become our new favorite spot! I am a philly roll connoisseur ;) salmon was fresh and of course not fishy, very buttery. Highly recommend checking it out. The tootsie roll was also delicious!"}
{"text":"1. The staff is very personable. Ken, Ro and Cat always make me feel like a regular. It's nice when you just aren't another body and they wanna get you in and out.  2. It's never packed and I really LOVE that! You can actually hear someone talk, have good conversation, not feel rushed, relax and enjoy yourself.  3. The food is good. I always order the veg tempura with a side of spicy mayo, the golden avocado or the orange chicken.   4. It's a good place to go if you are solo. Sit at the bar, they have multiple tvs and the fights are usually on.  5. It's kid friendly!"}
{"text":"We love it here.  They treat us like family.  Great food, great menu, great prices.  Good quality sushi.  Awesome with kids, good atmosphere for family, but not overwhelmingly so - we go here for date night too."}
{"text":"Love the Live DJ'S on Friday and Saturday nights. The drinks are great as well. Love the spicy rice dishes. Great atmosphere with great bartender Cody is the best."}
{"text":"Absolutely THE BEST sushi seriously in PHX - fresh!  Oysters from Japan! The freshest fish and a TRUE SUSHI CHEF!  Great service and AMAZING FOOD!  Seriously it's 10+ stars!"}
{"text":"This is my local sushi joint.  I love to run in here when I'm in a rush, they have quick service and I know many of the staff.  Some of my favorites include the Sawzilla and Philly Rolls."}
{"text":"I had lunch here with a friend a couple of days ago and would love to go back for happy hour.  Especially since I hear that the happy hour is from 3:30pm until they close.  I hope that this is true! Well, my friend and I were the only ones in the restaurant for lunch.  But it was an awkward time for lunch anyway, 2:20.  We decided to share the mongolian beef and the yellowtail roll.  We also got soup to begin with.  I love the soup, so simple!   The mongolian beef was tender.  The sauce is a little on the sweet side, but a nice flavor.  The yellowtail was nice and spicy!   Service was great! I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This is not a review on the food since we didn't end up eating there. We walked in and the place had a horrible sewer smell. We walked right out! There was no way we could eat in a place that smells like that. I was hoping it would be great, and maybe the food is, but I wasn't sticking around to find out."}
{"text":"Surprised. I was out in Glendale for trade school classes and my husband asked me to bring home some food. I don't regular in Glendale but this sushi was really good (and we eat a lot of sushi). The place smells kind of funny (peculiar) but I ordered to go. I did have to double check my order before I left because half my order was left out. But it was delicious all around. We got a sushimi combo and upgraded the Cali roll for the OMG roll. Both of us loved it. The sushimi itself was also really delish. Almost like it had a lemon zest or something on it. They only serve rolls with a black rice which was surprisingly delicious. We might have to make a trip outside our bubble to indulge again!"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi restaurant in the west valley! They serve black bean rice which  is better healthier than white rice! Should I ever come back.... hell's yea!!!"}
{"text":"I'm always on the lookout for sushi on the west side of town... and this one is a winner. Combine a creative menu, generous servings, and affordable prices, and you've got a winner here. The owner and staff are extremely friendly and talkative, too - definitely a plus!"}
{"text":"Place is bomb! Got the LJ I think and it was awesome. Happy hour everyday and cheaply priced. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Visited Yellowtails last night and had a great time as usual. The sushi is always spot on, great sashimi, very fresh. Ken, the owner, makes everyone feel at home and the waitresses are cool too. Good happy hour where the Saki Bombers flow. Can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! The owner was behind the sushi bar as well working away.  Nothing beats the taste of a small family owned sushi place!  And the staff were very friendly and made great recommendations!"}
{"text":"Very good.  But when they say spicy, you must believe them.  Nothing outstanding, just good sushi and sashimi.  Jo-Ann would like to see a better selection of tempura, boxes, etc."}
{"text":"Great service and awesome food. Glad I picked this place over the others. Will be back."}
{"text":"The menu was decent, wish they had a few more options. Our waiter took several minutes just to bring water to the table. We were ready to order so they took our order, but it took about 20 minutes for it to finally reach us. Which for a slower evening we felt was a bit long. My husband had to leave the table to find the waiter for drink refills. He did come and refill the right away. When my sushi rolls Came out, they didn't have the side of Ginger that I put in with the order. The party began to eat so their food wouldn't get cold, and after about 5-6 minutes my husband had to go get out waiter a second time to get our side of ginger. The food itself was fairly good, we didn't have any complaints about that part. Just the service."}
{"text":"We came here on a whim, and glad we did. Last night, we watched Jiro Dreams of Sushi, a documentary on one of the best sushi chefs in the world, and suddenly, we had a craving for sushi, so it was convenient that we were driving by this place on the way back from CostCo. We've driven past this place several times, but never had a chance to try it out.   Being a Sunday, the place was not crowded at all. Luckily it was happy hour (from 3-5pm), so sushi rolls were discounted as well as drinks. I asked for a Kirin Light, but our waitress said it was only available in a $5 bottle, so it would be a better deal for a $1 more to get the Sake bomb and get the extra beer plus sake. In the spirit of enjoying my lazy Sunday, I thought, \"Why not?\" and went for the sake bomb!   A particularly unique roll that we enjoyed was the Lollipop Roll. I'm learning that it doesn't matter what sushi place we go to, specialty rolls all seem the same to me, just with different names. A Tootsie Roll may have shrimp tempura there while here, it was spicy crab with ponzu sauce instead. The Lollipop Roll took us by surprise because it was literally designed like a lollipop, the rolls were on sticks. It tasted really good as well!  The Love Love Roll was pretty spicy, and I think that is due to the fact that it contains their spicy tuna, which was extra spicy within itself. You could actually see the large pepper flakes (the kind you sprinkle on your pizza) in the spicy tuna mix. My mouth was on fire! It's good thing I had sake and Kirin to cool it off! Despite the spiciness, the texture and taste of the tuna was pretty fresh, but I had to see for myself that this was true, so I proceeded to order nigiri - maguro (tuna), sake (salmon - not the rice wine), and unagi. Today, all were quite fresh.   To further test our sushi experience, we asked if they had Uni (sea urchin) or Toro (fatty tuna). The waitress and chef said that they had neither. The reason was that most people do not order Uni or Toro or rarer types of sushi. They said that these types of sushi are more expensive and it goes to waste if people don't order them. However, they did redeem those explanations by saying if we called a few days in advance, they would make the effort to order/purchase Uni, Toro, or other types of fish ahead of time and prepare it once we planned to come in.   Overall, they made our afternoon! We were very happy we got to try out their place, but I fear (from reading other reviews) that had we gone at busier times - persay a Friday or Saturday night, our experience might have not been as great as today. Because I like supporting local businesses and love that sushi is becoming more accessible on the \"west side,\" we will continue to go here, because I'm curious to see if they continue to improve (which I really want them to) and continue to surprise us."}
{"text":"I've been to a couple sushi places in the valley, and the sushi at Yellowtail is not impressive.   The OMG roll lacked flavor and the ingredients did not complement well. The Twin Volcano rolls were 2 small rolls wrapped with eel. They were OK but, not worth $13.  We also ordered the Las Vegas roll; the tempura batter was stale.   The Lettuce Wraps appetizer was too watery. The lettuce was still dripping with water, and the filling had too much sauce resulting in a watery mess.   The sirloin steak was good, but the side dishes that came with it was over cooked. The shitake mushrooms still had the stems on them,  making them difficult to eat.   The customer service was decent, but I felt they were too eager and forced. I felt like I was being rushed to order, even though I knew they were trying to be enthusiastic.   Lastly, the bathrooms were disgusting! I hear that a restaurant's cleanliness is based on how clean their bathrooms are.   I would not come back again unless they significantly improve."}
{"text":"So far, the best sushi I've had since moving to the west valley a couple of years ago. The presentations are as nice to look at as they are delicious. The  dumplings were  good but the coconut shrimp was a bit hard and  rubbery. Service was terrific . The background music was a 90's rock mix which is alright by me but a wider and softer range of genres might appeal to more people. Kirin is served in very large bottles and the house saki isn't bad at all. Prices are reasonable and our group left happy."}
{"text":"I wanted to venture out from Yen Sushi, my usual spot, and I'm disappointed I did. Yen Sushi (43rd ave.Bell) is so friendly and chill...  On with the nightmare:  The drink order (wine and beer) took a good 15 minutes, and the place was not crowded at all. Although I will say the food was pretty good, and my table was offered free apple saki samples, I will not return and here is why.  1) The table next to us was obviously way beyond drunk and the manager and waitstaff kept serving them, including free samples. I can only hope they took a cab home.  2) The music playing was very inappropriate for a restaurant. Although I love rap and hip hop, I do not think it is appropriate to play music which includes explicit lyrics. (Not to mention the drunk slobs next to us were yelling them out.). What if my children were there? This was not supposed to be a club scene. I told the waiter to tell the manager that we were offended by hearing \"b*$%h\" among other things. They changed the music right away, but LITERALLY the second we walked out of the door, they changed the music back.    I thought about emailing the manager, but the website has no contact email.   So, if you like to go to a restaurant managed by teens who have no concern for customer service and their longevity in the Arrowhead community, go there."}
{"text":"This place never ceases to impress me. Their premium dishes are the best and I often find myself craving their OMG! roll.  Cody (not sure of proper spelling) is genuinely helpful and kind. The money brains appetizer is delusions, if you like shrooms. Overall really great place, I would recommend it."}
{"text":"WOW!  This place was so much fun and the sushi was delicious!  We sat at the sushi bar and chatted with the chef and the owner of the restaurant.  We ordered omakase style, and while they weren't super fond of it, we got a gorgeous plate of fish and a roll.  I had a coconut martini and a blue drink and they were fun and fruity.  The service was great, very friendly and helpful!  We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Best sushi around.   Love the owner, Kenny,  always makes you feel so welcome!!!!  Love, love, love!!!"}
{"text":"Mango Martini! Excellent addition with my sushi. I had Shrimp Tempura and Vegas Roll! Sat at the bar and enjoyed a nice lunch! Good service good sushi can't beat it! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Went here for the 1st time and service was great and good food:) bartenders very friendly and assertive"}
{"text":"The buffalo roll was delicious!  Daniel was a fabulous waiter that went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our meal!"}
{"text":"Food 5, service 5, and ambiance 4. The vegas roll was more traditional than most which I enjoyed. Everything tasted fresh."}
{"text":"Great service. Great food. All around best sushi I've found in Arizona thus far. I've had many sushi places all around the country and this was one of the best."}
{"text":"Good food, good specials, great staff!  Ken and Sung treated us like royalty, giving us samples of different dishes.  Sit at the sushi bar and ask Sung or Ken for the Mini Dragon  ... it's delish!!   Or try the Spicy Salmon as pictured.  Dollar sushi Tuesdays and Wednesdays.  Happy hour 4:30  to 6...reverse at 8pm.. Enjoy!!"}
{"text":"Decent sushi, but on the expensive side since the portions were a bit skimpy. Would be all right for happy hour, but was a bit much for a dinner. The sushi was good, if a bit inconsistent. The tempura was perfectly done, as was the batter. The salmon rolls were average, the Yellowtail tuna rolls were bleh (says hubby), the cinco de drinko rolls were awesome, but the sauce they drizzled over them way way too heavy for such delicious fish. The coconut martini was good, but a bit on the pricey side. The beef sashimi was good, but too peppery for my taste."}
{"text":"This is becoming my favorite local sushi joint. I have been a handful of times and never had a bad experience. The owner is extremely generous and even gave us a free glass of beer at the end of the meal as a thank you for coming in on our last visit. I have seen him many times come out of the kitchen and greet the customers to make sure they are having a great dining experience.   The sushi is always fresh and they have a very nice selection of special rolls. I like that you receive a bowl of miso soup at the beginning of the meal at no charge. A great addition to the experience as I usually don't care to spend $3-4 on a bowl of broth at other sushi restaurants. And theirs is one of the best misos I've had. The wait staff is nice, friendly, and personable. I have been for week day dinners, late lunches and there's not usually more than 3-4 tables occupied. I think this has to do with the location and time of day that I visit, but I will spread the word and hope more sushi lovers will give it a try!"}
{"text":"Ok westside sushi lovers, this place was just ok in my opinion. My wife & I love sushi so when we saw this new place we had to try it. They've been open for only 2 weeks now. My opinion is this: the cost for the sashimi is a bit high and the pieces were thin with a salty flavor.  The yellowtail cheek came out raw at first and we had to send it back for additional cooking.  We still prefer Sakana or Sushi Yuki for the cost and fish piece size."}
{"text":"This is our favorite Sushi place in the Glendale/Peoria area.  For some reason this place is rarely busy during lunch on the weekends.  Extremely fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and it will not be my last. Service is awesome and Ken makes you feel vey welcome. The blue fin toro was great and very well priced, one of a few places that I have found it in AZ. The spicy crab and shrimp tempura roll was also excellent."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of sushi, but the Cowboy roll is delicious, and the BBQ pork is the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"This was my third visit in the last year to this particular restaurant.  While the sushi is good, the service is terribly slow.  It took over 30 minutes to prepare 4 rolls and there were only 4 patrons in the restaurant.  The menu selection is very good with standard sushi, sashimi, and rolls.  They have an extensive specialty roll menu.  The Cinco-de-Drinko roll is exceptional.  If you have time to kill and don't mind waiting for your food, Yellowtail Sushi might appeal to you, but I won't be back.  There are too many other Sushi restaurants with better service."}
{"text":"We tried Yellowtail on recommendation from a friend. It was decent, but pricey. I just wasn't wowed at all though. Sushi places are common, and this one wasn't exactly close to home.   Service was okay, the food was okay, nothing was wrong with anything really. Maybe if we had gone for happy hour I may have been more excited about everything.  They weren't bad at all, just mediocre. I just don't have any real reason to return when I have has better experiences elsewhere for the same price. If this happens to be the most convenient sushi place near you, by all means give them an honest shot."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. My friend and I hit up happy hour mid day on a Saturday and enjoyed some very delicious sushi creations. I've been to quite a few sushi restaurants and this is up there among my favorites. Not only do they have great prices but their food is amazing! The Vegas Roll is to die for, Salmon, cream cheese, avocado and the whole roll deep fried. YUM! I also had the Tootsie and Lollipop rolls along with the Veggie Tempura. If I could eat here everyday I would. Try it, you'll love it."}
{"text":"If I could give zero I would. Just leaving this shot hole of a place. Service and food was crap. We waited over an hour for half of our food which wasn't good and cost $60 for crap!!!! I would never eat here again, I can't believe this place has 4 stars"}
{"text":"Great service, good food, great happy hour!  If you're in the area, head to Yellowtail for great sushi at a great price!  The service was excellent as we were greeted immediately, felt taken care of from the start, and throughout the meal.  Started with the spicy edamame, which is a delicious choice to start the evening!  Regular edamame was $2 on happy hour, but we opted for the spicy.  Domestic tap beers were $2.50. Can't go wrong.  Then ordered salmon nigiri, spicy tuna, and Vegas rolls all because we were hungry and they were on happy hour, $4 and $6 respectively.  Sat at the bar and watch NBA game 7, while eating wonderful food and cold beer.  Couldn't get better!  Make your way to Yellowtail for a great sushi experience!"}
{"text":"I love sushi, and the sushi here tasted good, but- myself and my boyfriend got sick after eating here.    We ordered the \"white tuna\" sashimi, and a handful of rolls and nigiri.  After leaving, we learned that \"white tuna\" does not exist, it is either albacore or escolar (snake mackerel).  While everything tasted great, something did not sit well.  Many of our symptoms are in-line with escolar-induced keriorrhea, but seem to go beyond that.    This experience has made me think twice about going out for sushi again in the future."}
{"text":"We have been here multiple times without issues but tonight was TERRIBLE. The food was meh. The service was atrocious. Our waiter couldn't keep anything straight.. she came back 20 minutes after taking our order to make sure she wrote it down right. The food came out in no particular order. Every time she needed an empty glass or brought something to the table she made everyone pass things down instead of walking to the other side of the table. When our check came there was an 18% gratuity added on that we were not made aware of. We have been here before with more than 8 people and never had this added. After about 30 minutes she finally got the checks sorted correctly. Sadly if this waitress is ever working here when we come back we will leave.   Also the teriyaki chicken tastes like syrup."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place! Amazing fresh sushi and sashimi. Absolutely the best yellowtail I have ever had in my life hands down. The best part is I live minutes from here!"}
{"text":"Nice place. Very attentive staff and a fun owner who makes you feel like an invited guest. The sushi is fresh and tastes great. Fun staff and a good happy hour. I will be back!"}
{"text":"The food was great, I recommend trying the 420.  The customer service was also really great! My boyfriend & I will be back.  Keyia"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is calming and intimate. Great spot for a date night! Loved the hot green tea, very delightful strong flavor. We did the bento box lunch and a sushi pick 2 for lunch and were super excited to have our first PURPLE rice sushi! Delicious and unique! Will be coming back here for sure!"}
{"text":"We recently visited Yellowtail a couple of times in a row. The sashimi is some of the best around, but anything from the kitchen is horrible. Don't try the sauce with the shrimp puff thingys; they said it was siracha & eel sauce; I warned you."}
{"text":"Okay I am hungry for sushi, was heading to Costco and saw this place. Figured I would stop by after I was done shopping. I did. I walked in and no one helped me, so I went to the restroom came out and looked around and went back up front. Sat down. Ordered some sushi and awwww it was bad.  Won't be trying this place again. Hair in the food and I'm bald"}
{"text":"One of the best sushi places ever.  Sit at the bar...eat everything on the menu. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ordered yellowtail carpaccio, buffalo roll and caliente roll. All were yummy and fresh. Great service too"}
{"text":"I was not satisfied with this restaurant at all. The rice used for the sushi was harder than it should be, the seaweed used for the sushi was tough, and the fish itself tasted fishier than other places I've been to. However, I did like the mini dragon rolls that were given to us. It was fried so I probably wouldn't have gotten a bigger size but the small amount we got wasn't too bad. We also had their tempura ice cream. It was good but the ice cream itself was slightly chalky. Overall, I wasn't impressed and most likely would not go back or recommend it."}
{"text":"This is my 1st time here. This what we ordered- sashimi salmon and yellow tail. Three rolls- super Vegas. OMG and soft shell crab. The chef threw in a dragon roll and a cucumber red snapper. All of it was fantastic"}
{"text":"It's not bad food. It's also not great. Personally,spending $80 to eat out of plastic bowls in a poorly decorated place with mediocre food isn't really for me. I'm confident that our seaweed salad was pre-made in a factory and there is an up charge for real wasabi. The fish was surprisingly good so I guess if you don't eat the Wasabi, close your eyes tight and order only off the sushi menu your safe."}
{"text":"We came during happy hour and it was good experience. We were seated fast and served fast.  We ordered the spicy salmon roll, the spicy tuna roll, the yellowtail nigiri, and the salmon nigiri... of course we got sake bombs because that's standard.  We preferred the spicy salmon roll and salmon nigiri. They offer a cold sake bomb as well, if you're into cold sake.  All and all I think it was around 30 bucks. Not bad.  Worth a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Amazing sushi and service!  Server was delightful and the chef was more than accommodating.  Suggested Tuna belly I had never had before, and it was to die for! Made us a special roll to compliment our sake and it was incredible!! Would give ten stars if I could."}
{"text":"I consider myself a sushi connoisseur so here goes... It's not fishy so that earns them one star. The fish is relatively fresh so that earns one star. There are a lot of creative named rolls and the happy hour is over an extended period of time so that earns one star. That is where it ends as well."}
{"text":"Had a lovely meal. Food was well constructed and tasted good. That's where the positive experience encoded. I don't know if it was renovations or just lack of caring but I felt like I was sitting in a warehouse that they  had temporarily put a restaurant in. Plus, the smell... Sewage mixed with sulfur mad the experience almost unbearable..."}
{"text":"Great sushi.....name says it all \"Yellow Tail\". Came in to celebrate my daughters graduation from college and the staff (Cat) was amazing."}
{"text":"Stopped by on a Sunday evening to both treat myself and to try something new, and let me just get it out of the way now by saying it was exactly what I was looking for!  When you walk in the door, the bar area sits off to your right and the dining to your left. I kinda just stood there and looked around being it was my first time and there was no one to greet you or at least there wasn't when I walked in. Just a stand with your menus and sushi sheets and a board with all of today's specials and ongoing specialty items. I figured it was kinda self explanatory at that point... just grab & go.  Upon immediately sitting down,  I was greeted and placed a drink order.  I personally enjoy having a drink order placed being it takes me no more then 5 seconds to decide... and I like to take my time while looking over the menu at places I'm not a regular at per say. After I got my drink I asked him (I believe his name was Daniel as well) if he had any favorites or recommendations I should steer towards before evening taking a peek at the menu. I was told the '420 Roll' and 'Swagzilla Roll\" were two of his personal favorites and fairly popular as well. I decided that was good enough judgement to kick things off and took sides with the Swagzilla Roll.  (Look at the menu for all the fixings to make these creatively titled rolls)  Shortly after the order was placed I was brought a cup of miso soup. very delicious I will say. I'm not one to ever make a big deal about some free miso before a meal but I did finish this cup in no time and was actually wanting more before my sushi came out.. but I refrained from saying anything, haha. Swagzilla Roll came out looking killer! Great size being there specialty rolls aren't real cheap. Originally thinking about doing 3 rolls I settled with only doing one more and actually tried the 'Cruz Roll'. I personally though the Cruz was MUCH better, and for being a spicy mayo/spicy sauce and jalapeno topped roll... it wasn't too spicy what so ever (I could actually see that being a complaint from someone wanting a very spicy roll)  2 Rolls and I was set, didn't get the chance to try any dessert but defiantly will be back based off my first visit! Very good service, water actually was refilled consistently rather than just when it was completely empty. Rolls didn't take too long for the complexity of what they were, and the atmosphere was ambient and relaxing after a long day!"}
{"text":"Haven't had short ribs since I attended Shereena's Chamorro family reunion.  These short ribs were on point.  The cast iron grill the come out in is sizzling hot, they are served over sautéed onions.  Seasoned just right and were grilled to perfection.  This was my first time here, I met up with an old coworker and his wife (who are regulars ). The workers were all very friendly.  Definitely going back soon."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, sushi tasted great, and the customer service was excellent! I recommend sitting at the sushi bar. *order the extra spicy tuna* Will be returning with my wife on many more occasions."}
{"text":"A friend and I went for lunch last weekend and I was thoroughly impressed! They had great appetizer happy hour and we shared a couple of rolls. The rolls were very fresh and extremely delicious! This place is a little on the pricier side, $15-$16 a specialty roll. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because they were out of chicken fingers for my friends daughter and although our server was very kind and friendly, I never received a refill on my drink."}
{"text":"Not much to say about this place, it's decent and better than a lot of other places in the West Valley, but not the best.  The place is clean and service is good, food is okay but didn't \"wow\" me.   When we came in there was NO ONE in the restaurant, which kinda freaked me out since it was 12:30 in the afternoon.  We had the Fancy Lady, Tootsie, and Yellowtail roll (it's called Yellowtail sushi after all!).  The Fancy Lady was good at first and used fresh cuts of fish, but later noticed that the crab mix had a slight off-taste, kinda like they used seafood salad from Fry's or something.  The Tootsie was drenched in sauce, which some people like, and it was really salty.  The Yellowtail roll was fine but the yellowtail tasted fishy, even though the same fish was on the Fancy Lady which tasted fine.  We went during lunch and they served us Miso soup which was salty as well and had a weird initial taste, like plastic.  We got a chicken wing app. and it was the best part of the meal!  From the looks of their menu they have a lot of creative ideas and hopefully their  other rolls are really great!  Overall it's a nice place and I like the idea of the Japanese/Thai fusion, prices are just like any other place.  Still recommend going to Sakana just on 59th and 101 if you don't mind driving 5 more minutes, but Yellowtail is worth a try!"}
{"text":"I've only been here once, but so far so good.  I ordered two rolls: The Rainbow roll and something else (forgot the name)  Everytime I go to a new sushi restaurant, I get the rainbow roll to judge the freshness of the raw fish. This restaurant has high quality, fresh raw fish and I was not disappointed. It was DELICIOUS. The only downside is the price is a little higher than most places I go to. But, I guess you get what you pay for :)  ALSO, I'm not happy with the \"special\" Uni they offered. They called it \"Blue Uni.\" No, it's not blue. It's only referring to the \"grade\" of the uni. Had I known that, I wouldn't have bought it. Well, we paid $17 for a little pile of uni. Taste was good but WHAT A RIP OFF!!! I had \"blue\" uni before at Sushi Catcher for the regular price... except I didn't know it was called \"Blue uni\" at the time (maybe Yellowtail made up that absurd name?). When Sushi Catcher was still owned by KC, he was VERY GENEROUS with his uni. I could get the same amount of uni Yellowtail gave me for only $8 at Sushi Catcher vs. the $17 Yellowtail ripped me off for."}
{"text":"Poor choice. We are sushi enthusiasts and have tried just about every place around town but this was our first time here. I genuinely don't like to negatively critique small businesses but I wish someone would have told me so I could have saved my 50 bucks (we chose this place based on the reviews). Food wasn't good, salmon was tasted like plastic, spicy crab tasted like regular crab with smoke flavor mixed in, place wasn't clean, 90's wedding DJ music played the whole time. Then halfway through eating I found what looked like pubic hair (hopefully not, but certainly human hair) in my food, underneath my salmon nigiri on top of the rice. And not just one piece of hair, like a bunch of hair. DONE. The one positive thing I can say is the waitress was very nice and an excellent server. Even with the train wreck of a meal I still left her a good tip. Everything else gets two thumbs down, I definitely won't return."}
{"text":"The food was decent, sushi was pretty good, the servers were horrible, the chef/owner? was very nice and apologetic, the ice cream was good. i never got my roll. that about sums it up"}
{"text":"This place is decent. My friend and I went here for happy hour last night and got sake bombs, spicy tuna roll, edamame, red snapper and tuna nigiri and coconut shrimp.   Sake bomb was good. It's always good.  Spicy tuna roll was ok. I've had better.  Edamame was edamame. I wish they had some sort of garlic type edamame. The nigiri's were good. They didn't taste fishy and seemed pretty fresh. This is was the first time I've had sushi in a couple of years since taking Microbiology due to being scared of bad sushi, but thank goodness, the sushi was quite fresh here.  Aaaand on to the coconut shrimp...holy mother Jesus, I think it was made with the tears of Jesus because it was DAMN good. I haven't  had coconut shrimp that amazing anywhere else. The appetizer comes with 4 giant sized shrimp on top of this sweet and sour sauce rolled in delicious crunchy sweet coconut. I would come back here just for that alone!   The reason why I didn't give them more stars is because their happy hour menu is very limited. They need more options.  The services was good. Our waiter was polite and friendly and squeezed us in for early happy hour.   I'll be back and will probably update my review. I have a good feeling about this place."}
{"text":"We love love love this place - the service is excellent, they all know you when you walk in, I love the Jalapeno poppers (they aren't what you think), I love the spicy tuna rolls - yes all of them.  I go here whenever I am in town (which is once a month).  We usually have a large party and they always move tables round to accomodate us.  The fish is fresh as can be, and the sauces are CREATIVE! Go and enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite sushi place in phoenix, and trust me I've been to more sushi places than I can count in phoenix alone! I'm more of a fresh sushi kind of person so if you like the fresh stuff this is where it is at!! Strongly recommend the love love roll if you like spicy tuna! It can be more pricy than the other sushi options but it's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Expensive and mediocre. A nice enough place with good fish but way overpriced. Certainly will not be repeating. Good staff. Definitely meh"}
{"text":"Went here during spring training after a baseball game.  We were a large group but they accommodated us no problem.  The place was very quite at the time.  Unfortunately we were loud and rowdy.  Thinking about it now.  They were very patient with us. The food was fresh and tasty.  I think we ordered everything on the menu between the nine of us who went.  Everything was awesome.  The owner even came at the end of our meal and did sake shots with us. And to think my friend told us not to eat sushi in Arizona.  I say \"bah\".  Yellowtail Sushi is a great place to eat sushi.  Take it from a guy who lives in San Diego and eats sushi at least once a month if not more.  This place is a must if your in the Glendale area."}
{"text":"Not feeling this place at all. Now that I have got that off my chest let me elaborate.  There are many sushi places between my house and this house, and I have eaten at a majority of them. I am not a super snob when it comes to sushi but I know what I like and what I expect when going to most sushi places.  The sushi was decent. It wasn't anything I would have to stop and write a yelp review for immediately. The salmon roll was a wee bit TOO sticky for my taste, and the tempura battered Las Vegas Roll was slightly chewy.  It was extremely pricey, and the portions were smaller than what I am used to.  The server was OK, she could have been more attentive, but she certainly wasn't rude. We didn't have to wait for our table, and the wait time for our food was minimal, drink refills alluded her on occasion.  Decent service, decent menu selection, but over all waaaay to pricey on their rolls.   All in all I probably wont make the drive here when Yen is closer."}
{"text":"Nice environment, but the sushi is a little pricey. I got the Pad Thai and it was not bad,  but I wouldn't get it again. It just was just boring, if you know what I mean."}
{"text":"Just moved near by and had to check this place out.  We were sad to leave the area near Tokyo Lobby in Glendale which had great sushi but Yellowtail will be the new spot for us.  Service -           We felt like we were friends at the restaurant not just customers.  Service was great!  Food was as good as it gets -          We had the Teppan Chicken and it was just as good if not better than the many teppanyaki places around town.  You don't get the fun show but the food is VERY tasty!  We also tried the White Tuna sushi and OMG roll.  Both were gone in minuets.  Atmosphere -             The atmosphere was the perfect blend between Fancy Sit Down and Family Friendly.  We will be back very soon to our new local sushi sopt!"}
{"text":"It's like crack. So great and the staff is awesome.  I could eat a whole tuna as long as they prepared it. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.  If that is a noise, I'm kind of making it right now.  First of all though, our bartender tonight, a young guy, was so friendly, and genuinely nice. 5 stars for you.  Aside from that, it was happy hour (we arrived 9 pm ish), and we opted for sake bombs a la Kirin, and a major red flag went up for me when he pulled out the sake already poured, and apparently prepped, as it had saran wrap covering the carafe. Noooooo no no no. No!  Sushi honestly was kind of fishy, and we got rolls. The sauces and ginger slices didn't mask it.   I had a great time with my guy, and grateful for the moment, but definitely not on my list to return. This is amateur sushi. I'd come here if I was like 12, and just discovered what a California roll and mochi was, and didn't know any better. Sorry for the blunt review, but I have to keep it real! Thanks for the friendly service though!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have made a tradition to try different sushi places whenever we're craving sushi. I love it because we get to explore different things and places. This place was small to average size which isn't a problem, the inside decor is interesting and nice. The only things we didn't like about this place, it was way over priced. When you first walk in, you expect an average price for food but our bill was higher than we expected. We've been to more high end sushi bars that serve fresh sushi and tasty drinks and our bill was never as high as it was at Yellowtail.. Aside from over pricing everything, the sushi was not as great or as fresh as we expect and the drinks weren't either. We ordered a couple draft drink along with two Sake Bombs, and we weren't happy with it, it tasted pretty stale.. We had placed an order in for Calamari as an appetizer but we didn't receive it until we were basically done with our sushi, we had asked our waitress about it and she said she would go and check on our order, I honestly think she might've forgot to put in our order.. I don't think we'll be visiting this place again..."}
{"text":"We just found this place... We will definitely be back!! It was really good.  Rolls are perfect size and they didn't do the giant ends with the shrimp tails.  Service was great!   Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"Took the family here Sunday night. We had incredible service and the food was excellent. My wife has been here several times for their great happy hour offerings. If you love great service, a friendly staff and excellent food then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"Service was fine, too hot in the building and the fish is warm, overpriced. Wouldn't come here again"}
{"text":"The server Kat was awesome. The sushi is great. They also have a really nice selection of rolls. Great specials offered through the week. My children loved the teppan from the kids menu. Yes a kids menu which is hard to find in sushi restaurants. This is our new go to place for sushi."}
{"text":"Visited last night for late night sushi. Good bargains to be had. Food was fresh and good. Will be back"}
{"text":"Ken is a great sushi chef.  In fact he showed me how to roll sushi.  I am forever grateful and glad that I never plan on becoming a sushi chef. I will leave the rolling to the experts.  Besides I rather just eat it then make it. :) Yellowtail is situated right by LA. Fitness so when your done working out load up on the calories you just burned off on the treadmill.  Fresh, delicious sushi and great happy hour specials.  I did enjoy some glasses of Blue Moon at only $3 bucks each.   Ken is glad to entertain and show a large group how to make sushi if you have enough people.  I am glad I attended, I now have an appreciation for the work that goes into making sushi.   If you are by the Arrowhead mall and have a sushi craving, Yellowtail is a must stop local."}
{"text":"Best sushi I've had in a long time! Can't believe I didn't know about this place sooner. We will definitely  be coming back and to top it off the service was really great. Our server Phoenix was very attentive and took great care of us. Overall wonderful experience!!"}
{"text":"Best place I have found in the Phoenix area been trying everywhere the past year. Yellowtail is without question the best for sushi rolls thus far. Although the waitress seems like she needs a energy boost."}
{"text":"Yellow Tail was fabulous.  The owner is a great guy and the real deal.  The sushi chefs were fantastic, well trained and responsive to any special request.  The Vegas roll, Dragon Roll, and 420 roll were suberb.  The soup was incredible and so wonderful.  I really like this place and you will too."}
{"text":"Blah. I went here for my birthday hoping to try a great sushi spot for the first time. I was unimpressed. Shortest happy hour (4:30-6) I've seen. Usually for some delicious sashimi it will cost me around 10$. Theirs was much higher and so were the rolls so it's just not worth the cost to me. There are some great sushi spots close by that really out-do this one."}
{"text":"Went in for dinner a couple days ago and tried a couple different rolls, the seaweed salad and calamari. Everything was really good and brought out quickly. Our server Daniel was very nice and answered all our questions as well as making some recommendations. Definitely a good place to hit up for some quick sushi."}
{"text":"I went here for my daughters birthday and this place was absolutely amazing! They had great service and Justin (our server) was awesome and super helpful and friendly! It has a reasonable price for some good quality sushi. Would recommend if you want to try sushi or just to eat it!"}
{"text":"I like this place because it has white tuna. That's my absolute favorite. We are kinda big about happy hour. We generally like to come during that time to save money. Still, we usually spend upward of $60 between the two of us. We checked online and it said Monday and Tuesday was all day so we popped in. They'd changed their happy hour but hadn't updated the online hours. The team was really nice and extended us the happy hour offers. I really like this place. The only thing I could ask for is updated online hours."}
{"text":"First time I have gone there. Service was decent but on one of the rolls,  it I think they forgot the other one. Only after I reminded the waitress did I get the second one. It wasn't the most comfortable sushi place I've gone to. The food was good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go there."}
{"text":"What a find. The rolls were excellent and the service was over the top. The place is a bit small but very clean. The staff was friendly and came over to talk with us. We had our 11mo with us and she was all the rave. Highly recommend, we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Checked this place out today for lunch after several recomendations from friends.  I didn't have any sushi so no report on that, but I did however have some AMAZING short ribs.  They had some great drink specials but do to having to go back to work I couldn't partake so after work Happy Hour is coming soon.  Very clean spot great service and everyone I was with had great meals so this will be part of my sushi rounds from now on."}
{"text":"The waitress was very nice and in formative on the rolls and meals. I ordered the Kung Pao chicken... it was not what I expected. The chicken was breaded and very soggy. It had a very different taste. There was no spice or peanuts. My husband ordered the chicken pad Thai and seemed pleased. The rolls were very different and were actually hard to eat. Not cut but in a cone shape. Kinda different. Honestly panda express is better and I really don't prefer panda express."}
{"text":"This is the best place with the freshest sushi.  I am not a fan of the purple rice though.  Can you please bring back the cold white rice for those of us who don't like the purple rice?  Please!  Otherwise I would give 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Our favorite Sushi place in the West Valley... Caliente Roll is awesome. Calamari is also a great appetizer."}
{"text":"I've only been here two weeks & Ken, the Sushi Chef is my \"New Friend\"  the sushi was wonderful, fish fresh & not alot of rice;  so good!   Service was excellent & this New AZ resident will be back, again & again!"}
{"text":"Never a disappointment coming here. Great, friendly service. Always new rolls to try that are amazing. They have a nice happy hour with good specials on drinks and food. Would highly recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Love the hand rolls and the avocado app, yum! Only been here twice but this is my new fav!"}
{"text":"Excellent food! The girl who was serving was a little reserved which came across a little unfriendly at first, but she warmed up over time. The ambiance is interesting, they had EDM music blasting, a baseball game on, chairs that didn't match, and outdated booths. Seems like an identity crisis, but the overall experience was worth the money. The young manager guy was very friendly and outgoing. I'd say it's worth trying."}
{"text":"This place is really really good for sushi.  We have gone a few times and it has always been good.  All we have had was the sushi but I will be going back.  It is becoming a regular spot for date night with my wife."}
{"text":"I let the chef make the decisions and ordered Omakase.. the handling of the fish and attention to detail were promising quantity was adequate for the amount spent but not generous. bottom line overall it was pretty good but no where near as good as say Harumi.. However the one thing that really turned me off was that a single Sake Bomber with very very low quality sake ended up costing $12 during reverse Happy Hour. Yeah thats right better then $10 or more then double what I pay ever where else.. Yellowtail looked promising. But, there is no way I will be back after that.."}
{"text":"The More You Know: \"One of the favorite sushi fishes, yellowtail, is factory-farmed like veal and fattened until its muscles disintegrate while it's still alive.\"  Yum.  Three of us walked in on a Sunday night for Reverse Happy Hour and we were told to sit anywhere we wanted.  Seeing that there was only one clean table, we grabbed a very comfortable booth seat.  The whole time we were there, none of the tables had been cleaned even though we saw quite a few members of the staff standing around talking.    Now the food:  Uneven cuts, high prices, okay quality, and soggy seaweed.  All our rolls had black/purple/forbidden rice.  I was all for it, my brother was against it, and our childhood friend was on the wall about.  I think the slight nuttiness of the forbidden rice paired well with some of the stuff while in others, like in the sweet shrimp, it was distracting.  Depending on which chef made the rolls, they were either uniform or uneven.  Why even send out the food if it's obviously cut sloppily?  Also, our Avocado Unagi Roll didn't appear to have unagi in it.  The gyoza we ordered was practically doggy paddling in sauce.  I did enjoy the Deep Fried Mac & Cheese and the Tootsie Roll though.  We spent nearly $60, before tip for gyoza and six rolls.  It's a trendy restaurant but I don't see myself coming back.  The price point definitely doesn't match the quality and portions.  3-stars and A-OK all around but yeah, life's too short for \"meh\" sushi.  Also to note, there's a weird smell to the restaurant.  Aiyah!"}
{"text":"I've never been a fan of sushi for the 29 years of my life but since I've gone to yellow tail... Sushi is all I want to eat and crave for!!!!    We ALWAYS get the dragon roll, tootsie,  Louie and my FAVorite.... The New Orleans roll! Omg. TO-die-FOR!   What's even better (if possible) is the customer service. The bar tenders to the waitress to the sushi chief to the owner..  All greets you as you walk in the door and thanks you before you leave.  I love that.  Ro... Is our server and she's awesome!!!  Cat also took good care of us before so we like her too!   Anyway bottom line... I wish I could afford to eat sushi all days of the week. But I will only eat it here cause no one else compares!  BEST SUSHI IN TOWN!!!!!"}
{"text":"I didn't know what to expect at first when I came to this little restaurant. When I walked in I was amazed at how nice this place was. The servers where helpful, friendly, and the waiters where fast at getting the requests out. The food was excellent and well prepared and looked good while tasting better. This place hasn't let me down yet and in tell then this place is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I am pretty new to this whole sushi thing. I have never liked fish. Someone suggested that I try sushi, that maybe I would enjoy raw fish. Yeah, like that makes any sense. Well now I want to try to eat fish because it is healthy. Blah blah blah. So I try fish again, still not feeling it. There is this movie Hiro Dreams of Sushi. I watch it and it intrigues me. So I grab my 13 year old daughter and say let's try something new.  So we show up at Yellowtail after reading reviews. Big thing I look for no food poisoning. I am not as concerned about service because I feel service is what you make of it. We do a couple of rolls (jazz roll and something with avocado) and for fun we dare each other to do the salmon nigiri.  What has been my problem all these years. The waitress was wonderful. I told her we were new to sushi. She made us comfortable and helped make suggestions and......and oh my gosh what a great first time.  So I know we are new at this but oh my goodness now I crave it.  I have been to a few more sushi places based on reviews from multiple forums and I just had to come back. I have food allergies and the saddest one of all is avocado. This place has more options for me.  Most recently we went and got the cowboy and jazz rolls along with tuna and yellowtail nigiri.  I was hoping to get my craving out of the way for a couple of weeks. Nope now I want to go back and eat more. So my biggest problem with the place is I keep wanting more. The only thing I need now is some hot and sour soup. I know that might be sacrilegious but even though I have enjoyed their miso the best I really would live some hot and sour with my rolls.  I don't know if this helps anyone make a decision about going here. I am converted and totally want some sushi right now."}
{"text":"I saw a new sushi restaurant and couldn't resist. It is FANTASTIC. The sushi was fresh and well prepared. The prices were very reasonable. I'll be back to do a more comprehensive review within a few weeks."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service - poor quality and freshness of nigiri. I try not to be too critical on reviews but if your signature sushi nigiri is partially bloody on your cut (a big no-no), you are the Yellowtail chef and it is sent back without a reason, you should follow-up to it and either replace it or provide a reason for it. The rolls on the other hand are pretty decent and quite flavorful but extreme on the spiciness level- the spicy tuna on the Hawaiian roll , for example. Overall, this place gets a 2-star rating in my view. We came here on a Sunday evening and the service was quick (we were the only customers) but follow-ups and interactions were so-so."}
