{"text":"Went back to new generation recently after not having been back for about a year. I must say, food quality and atmosphere seems to have gone down. New gen used to be one of those rare chinese run places that actually had some table romance where they introduce and recommend food to you. Now it feels like most other chinese sushi places where they just throw down the food and go about their business.

They also hired a new teppanyaki chef who doesn't seem to cook the food as well or have the showmanship for teppanyaki cooking. The beef ribs used to be amazing off the teppanyaki grill because they would caramelize it with extra butter sauce, but now it's just meh. The new chef pumped out food fast and joked with some of the customers but it all felt like less of a show now and not really worth the extra money. 

Food quality wise I feel like it has gotten worse. Not terrible by any means but definitely not as good as it used to be. The Kara age used to be juicy but now it's tiny and overcooked. The sushi slices they give you are smaller as well now (I know you can order more but it is a sign that they are cutting cost). Fusion roll is still great though. 

New gen, you were awesome, but we've both changed and maybe it's time to move on."}
{"text":"Love comming here for AYCE sushi with my group of friends. We are usually +/- 10 people. Service is always friendly and food is always very fresh. Especially since we love sashimi and it's always up to our standards. Place is nice although it's not visible from the outside. A hidden gem."}
{"text":"Unfortunately couldn't get a table at the teppanyaki tables but we had sushi and the tumi and yem bento with beef, and their crunch roll!! The sushi was extremely fresh and even the miso was excellent!! Best part was the service!!it was my sons birthday and they went above and beyond to make his day special!! I would love to go back again and again!!"}
{"text":"Fresh good, great staff. This is one of my favourite sushi places. Keep going back even though there are other places I could try."}
{"text":"This place is somewhat hidden but they are definitely my new favourite sushi restaurant in Vaughan. They offer both a la carte sushi as well as all you can eat and teppanyaki! Koodos to my friend who bought me here one night after shopping at Vaughan Mills. It's literally 5-10min away from Vaughan Mills on Jane. Although you can't quite see it off the side of the road, there are signs directing you into the newly developed plaza that they are located at. Convenient with free parking and a number of parking spaces. The restaurant itself is clean, modern, and has two levels (the teppanyaki tables are upstairs which is a plus because sometimes I do not enjoy being too close to the teppanyaki tables due to the heat they give off while I'm having my sushi). The sushi itself was very fresh, I instantly fell in love with their Uni hand-roll!!! I have to recommend their Fusion roll as well (a mouth full of flavor)! All sashimi was very fresh, even the beef tataki, it wasn't frozen and icy like those that I've tried in other location. Presentation of their dishes was nice. I will definitely be returning and recommending this location to friends for wheenver they want sushi in the Vaughan area."}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend went to the New Generation Sushi and Teppanyaki on December 7th/13 for lunch. The place opened just a few months ago, it is on the side street and not a lot of people know about it yet, so we were one of the few couples there. We decided to give it a shot anyway and we were glad we did!
The service was excellent. Kyle explained to us that this is actually All U CAN EAT SUSHI and TEPPANYAKI. I have never seen the teppanyaki to be all you can eat and was very excited to have the personal chef to cook for us as many times as we wanted. 
SERVICE: Kyle have taken such a good care of us, when we asked for food suggestions he first inquired as to our usual choices and make comparable and better suggestions. I am picky and I surprisingly like all the suggestions. Carmen, one of the owners of the restaurant, came by to say hi and asked us very specific questions about the food we ate, like how we liked this specific sauce or the cut of meat. They were really listening to our feedback and this made me feel that they do care about the quality of the food and the experience they provide to the customer. It is always a good sign!
FOOD: the choices are plenty, the food is really tasty, and having AYCE teppaniaki is really unique. I liked that the rolls were not that huge and not stuffed with more rice than fish). The fish was fresh, the sauces - tasty, the tempura - more shrimp than batter. When it came to teppanyaki, we tried all of the menu, just a bit of everything, and really liked the beef and the salmon, and their special - the scallop.
ATMOSPHERE: it is a two-level restaurant, the sushi on the first level and two 20-seat teppanyaki tables on the second. I can see how the second level can become the venue for a private or semi-private party. For $32 all you can eat and ask to cook for you, along with the teppanyaki chef's tricks - it is a pretty good deal for any family and friends celebration and entertainment.

We will definitely go there again. Our family is coming to town soon, I am sure this is where we will take them for a welcome dinner :-)"}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE Sushi places in the GTA. High quality food, the salmon sashimi melts in your mouth. Staff pleasant and eager to please. Interior decor very tasteful.
Also a la carte, generous portions."}
{"text":"This place has great sushi! We had AYCE sushi each time we ordered it always came in less then five minutes. They came to fill our drinks several times, and since their menu had several rolls we'd never seen before they were more then willing to take the time to explain each roll to us in detail. The menu had well over 30 different kinds of sushi to choose as well they give you the option to order half order (4 pieces) or full order (8 pieces). The restaurant decor is modern and the restaurant was spotless. I would definitely go back to try this hidden gem of restaurant as food was awesome, prices reasonable, and the staff was friendly!"}
{"text":"I'm glad that I tried out New Generation - It's the best bang for the buck in the GTA for AYCE Sushi.

The service was excellent. Our server was really patient when taking our order and didn't mind explaining the Japanese items on the menu. 

We were each given complimentary hamachi sashimi, which was a rare sight in most AYCE restaurants. The sashimi options here also include: salmon, butter fish, white tuna, tamago, kani, mackerel and surf clam. The only complaint I have is the cut if the salmon - instead of big chunks I would have preferred thinner slices.

The three salmon appetizers were all delicious and presented as if we we ordered a la carte. The beef tataki was NOT frozen but the sauce was not sour enough. Although the server advised that she gave us the wrong dipping sauce the first time, our sauce in the next order was exactly the same.. 

Dessert wasn't too impressive. The coconut sago was basically sugary water in a small cup. The ice cream still had the taste of freezer burn, but nothing to complain about for AYCE.

The menu variety goes from Maki to Korean rice cakes and even Thai curry! I didn't get a chance to try everything, but I definitely will be back for their teppanyaki experience!"}
{"text":"For the price they are charging, it is indeed pretty good value. However, they really need to look into training their servers. I had reserved a party of 15 for teppanyaki this past Saturday. When we got there, some of my friends were already there. When he kids saw each other, thy got excited and started running around. While we were telling our kids to stop, this  particular oriental waitress, just grabbed the hood of my friends' 6-year old daughter and scolded at her. 

I was like, yes, we were aware that kids running around was dangerous, but we were already doing something about it. But she should NEVER laid her hand on any child. 

Then my other friends with young children arrived. My friend started to put his bag and coat on the empty besides him, the same lady went to him and said \"No, you can't put your stuff here. You reserved for 15 people, you are getting 15 chairs. I will have other customers coming in, and we will need this chair\". And of course, there was no more customer taking the seats next to him.  That was just plain rude."}
{"text":"Very \"no thrills\" about this place, but you'll get exactly what you came for. 

When we first pulled up, we immediately had second thoughts because of how dingy & esthetically unappealing it looked on the outside. Rest assured, the food & service makes up for it.

I wouldn't call it a hidden gem, and I sure as heck would not go out of my way to come here, but if you happen to be in Vaughan and need to sedate your sushi craving, it'll do. 
Their rolls were big & had minimal rice, the sashimi was fresh, and no complaints on the teppanaki & tempura items.

Service was great - The wait staff was very attentive, checked in on all the right times, and our drinks were never past half empty. 

All in all, there wasn't much to love or hate. If it weren't for the menu not being very extensive, I would be a little more eager to come back."}
{"text":"We had excellent service. The restaurant is really clean! Teppanyaki was upstairs and we had a la carte on the main floor. Great vegetarian choices that are not always available at other sushi places, e.g. Spicy vegetable maki roll. Thoroughly enjoyed our food and experience:)"}
{"text":"Even though we didn't get the teppanyaki table it was still a nice experience with the sushi. Every dish was tasteful and the service was quick and prompt. Still a lot of guessing whether items will show up not not. I wish they go to the iPad ordering system soon."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here, and both times I was not disappointed with their service and food.  

The service was friendly and professional, most of their staffs have a wide knowledge base of the food they offer; therefore, I could frequently ask them questions about the food on the menu, giving me the comfortable opportunity to try a lot more different selections that I would not normally order from any other AYCE restaurant!

The food quality was also up to par, I can't recall any food that I didn't re-order again.  Everything was freshly made and was NOT bland and had an explosion of flavors!

The interior design of the restaurant is one of the reason why I wanted to try this place.  It is really innovation and artsy inside, and everything seems really clean!"}
{"text":"Location: 8750 Jane St, Vaughan 
Price: $$$
Service: Good

This place and pretty fancy- it doesn't look like it on the outside but the inside is amazing. The layout of the restaurant is really modern and it has two floors. The second floor is for teppanyaki. They have two types of \"all you can eat\"  (AYCE sushi and then there's AYCE teppanyaki), and there's also à la carte sushi as well. To be honest it is really over priced even for lunch sushi. The start off price is $25. 

I wasn't too hungry that day so I didn't choose AYCE, I just got a bento box lunch special. The sushi was alright. I wasn't a big fan because their sushi had a strong vinegar taste to it. One cool thing about this restaurant is the fact that they offer brown rice (of course there's additional charge to it). However, when I tried the brown rice it has a strong vinegar taste as well- which is really odd. It's possible that they use that same rice for sushi too if other customers asked. The miso soup was a little too salty. On the bright side I really like the salmon sashimi, it was fresh! 

Our server was really friendly and accommodating since I like to ask a lot if questions. The server frequently checked up on us (of course when my mouth is full of food.. Omnomnom).  I gave this place a 2.5 for the serve and possible revisiting to try their teppanyaki. 

Verdict: Passable"}
{"text":"Food was good,  however,  they made my friends and I wait roughly 30-45 minutes before they started the teppanyaki service,  which was included in our sitting time limit."}
{"text":"I was invited there for a family dinner.  We had teppanyaki scallops, shrimp, Kobe beef, Angus beef, fois gras and fried rice.  We also ordered their sushi rolls, assorted sashimi, tampura shrimp and grilled mackerel.

The teppanyaki was blend, no show was put on during the cooking.  Overall, the teppanyaki grilled food tasted all the same.  Their house roll was pretty good.  I would recommend it.  Their assorted sashimi was very fresh.  For people like eating raw fish, this is a must have.  The grilled mackerel we especially requested for it to be grilled a little longer so that it's a little charred.  It was very disappointing to see it still under cooked even if we asked before hand.

They have a variety of ice creams.  You will need to special order the sesame flavor as it's not on the menu.  They have mango, green tea, red bean and vanilla.

The service were not really up to my standard.  Often times you will need to ask for your drinks to be filled and even when you ask them to do something, they will tell you to wait until they finish what they're doing.  For instance, a waiter was already clearing up our table when we ask him to take our ice cream orders.  He could have stopped what he was doing, take our orders then continue to collect the remaining dishes.  But instead he demands us to wait, it took him two rounds to clear our table then took our order.  But when our host ordered second round of ice cream, it was OK for the waiter to take his order IMMEDIATELY! (Although the waiter was in the midst of waiting tables) Wow, what a difference in attitude.  Because if this, I will NEVER go back there again.  Mind you that the meal wasn't cheap either so I would expect premier service from them.  But the services we received was totally unexceptable."}
{"text":"I went to have dinner for the second time last night at New Generation Sushi. The lady that serves and watches over everyone was there and decided to tell her server to tell me that I have to eat all the rice from my sushi. The sushi rice I left was the size of a couple of tablespoons. I was embarrassed and appalled and was not finished my dinner. This happened after 10 minutes of eating. This is an all you can eat restaurant and If I left a plate of food, I understand I would most likely have to pay a fee for leaving food. Never has a server told me to eat all the rice on my plate because they do not waste food there and I ordered it. I liked the food however because of the rude owner who hovers over everyone, I would not go back. So rude and unprofessional."}
{"text":"Other than at an all inclusive resort this is the only time I have tried Tappan.  We always expect the same tacky show where they sing to y ou and make a lot of noise with their utensils.  Not at Teppan house.  The cooks are actually entertaining.  The are very funny, very skilled with their utensils and other objects that they use.  They get the customers involved which is great as well and also engage in conversations with them.  The meat and fish selection was great, well cooked tasty and well seasoned.  The all you can eat sushi was also included in the rice.  The sushi was just the same as every other sushi place in town.  The main highlight here is the Tappan.

I will be back again"}
{"text":"The place was a bit hard to find, it's hidden behind other industrial buildings. The decor inside is nice. We came for AYCE lunch on a Saturday. The AYCE lunch menu is the same as the dinner and same price. The ordering system is super outdated they don't use iPads with pictures... They have a paper menu with lots of words and no pictures (and doesn't even describe what is in each roll) and then you have to flag a waiter over and try to remember all the things you want to order.... 
The food on the menu was limited, plain and simple and nothing special, nothing high end, all the cheap stuff. Nothing on the menu was exceptional or good, there are many AYCE places much better than here, our entire group of 6 people for sure will not return."}
{"text":"If I could give it zero stars I would.....but I can't,  so I'll just tell the story (excuse the poor grammar, im getting mad just thinking about it.) 

We made a reservation for 8 pm on a Saturday and they didn't have a record of it when we got there: we told them my wife is very pregnant, please don't sit us next to the door....which they did. Two of us wanted to the all you can eat, two didn't so the waiter made us separate the tables and switch seats so we were grouped accordingly. We sat for 20 minutes waiting for food before the waiter finally told us he forgot to punch it in. Finally, and my favorite,  was the new waiter offering dessert on the house for the two non-ayce people then charging us for it and denying that he offered it! It was overall a fairly lousy dinner at a lousy restaurant with lousy service and they won't be getting my business again. Maybe your experience will be different, I can only talk about mine."}
{"text":"Very impressed with setting, staff and the food! This was my first time eating teppanyaki and I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The sushi was wonderful as well!"}
{"text":"The food took very long to get to us and unfortunately the food is found to be bland in comparison to their other locations which I've been to. But I guess it's cuz there's two all you can eats happening In this location. I wish I could've given them a better rating but it just wasn't up to par."}
{"text":"Good service and tasty food 
A bit more expensive than the regular all you can eat but big option menu to choose from"}
{"text":"The sushi here is OK.  It is pricey for Vaughan though!  I have no problem with higher prices if the portions are generous.... but the portions are small (Relative to other Japanese restaurants in DT Toronto I frequent often)."}
{"text":"Their menu doesn't have any pics, and is paper menu, not iPad. 

Service was slow. 

Food were just same as regular AYCE. 

Not recommended."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience here. It is usually never even at half capacity here but do not let that fool you. The quality of the food here is great and the service is the best I have experienced at any all you can eat sushi place.

I have never had to wait once to be seated here, all the servers are great and knowledgeable about the menu. There are daily special desserts in addition to their usual desserts which is a great idea.

They also take vicinity rewards so you can at least get some savings for your patronage. Highly recommend this place if you want good quality sushi."}
{"text":"One of my favourite ayce sushi places. If it wasn't so far from where I lived it would be my go to place. Whenever it's my mom or my birthday, we come here for dinner.

So food wise, everything I've had is good. The sashimi is so fresh and cut thick. They give salmon belly which a lot of places don't usually. They have herring sashimi and octopus sashimi which is rare for ayce. If they had squid too I would probably live here. The salmon roses are just salmon, Japanese mayo and tobiko which is perfect since other places put rice in it to fill you up. 

The all time favourite for my mom and I is the fusion roll. It's like a California roll with butterfish on top then Japanese mayo torched and sauce poured on top. Idk what it is but it's the best. Try it!!!

The service is good, there's always different servers but Carmen is very friendly and always checking up. There's also another guy that idk the name of but he's pretty funny in a deadpan kinda way haha. 

Out of all the ayce sushi places I've been to this is the best for me."}
{"text":"Will not return! Service is horrible. Stood at the front door for 15 minutes before anyone even came up to me. Was seated right beside the door so, I froze to death. They served us PINK chicken wings and they said it was the marinate they use. The marinate they use? What kind of marinate makes the inside of a chicken wing pink? Horrible and completely unorganized service. I also asked for a glass of water 5 times and finally got it after the 5th time"}
{"text":"Everything we tasted was fresh and flavourful. The staff was very attentive and the food came quickly. They have a wide amount of choices for an AYCE. I especially loved the salmon sashimi, beef short ribs and the spicy tuna hand roll."}
{"text":"We came for a birthday party of 9 people for the teppanyaki.  It was our first time here.  The restaurant its self is very nice.  I think the experience for us would have been much different if we had ANY of the other cooks we saw.  We ordered the all you can eat which is basicly the fixed menu plus whatever else you want on the menu at no charge.  The cook was funny and talented throughout the whole dinner.  Honestly he's the reason I give the 4  stars.  If it wasn't for him this place would have gotten 2.  The food ordered seemed to be fresh until we got frozen spring rolls delivered to our table. That made us wonder about the rest of the food.  The teppanyaki food itself was pretty basic as I find they all are.  But its all about the experience in my opinion and our cook really did a great job of that.  We had made reservations and 3 other people just walked in and were seated by the waiter in a better spot around the table than some of our party which I thought was rude but we all had a good time regardless.  I would recommend this place for parties but I'd suggest if you dont want to be eating with other people to try and get a minimum of 12 peopole for the larger table.u  Washrooms were on the main floor and tables on the second.  The washrooms were very nice and clean."}
{"text":"2.5 star for food + 0.5 star for effort and services

Welcome New Generation to uptown! Oh this is Vaughan. 

Deco is nice and chic with excellent ventilation, quite important as this is a teppanyaki restaurant, too.

There are options though: a la carte or AYCE from $23.95 with the option of teppanyaki for $6 or so more.

We shared Matsu Sushi Combo ($14.95) and Tonkatsu Combo ($15.95). Sadly the pork though huge in portion but was so dry, to the point even my Yelp Friend could not swallow that....Sushi was standard quality, shari rice a little off balance but at least acceptable.

Extra 0.5 star for our server and manager who tried their best to make us happy by offering us some complimentary shrimp tempura.

Since the restaurant just open for less than a week, hopefully it will improve over time.

Lunch special for $9.95 and with quite a good menu choice selection! Maybe I come back again for that! I just could not justify paying almost $30 to eat here as the food were quite meh!

Service is friendly and attentive.

Grand Opening special 15% off.

PS I remembered when I used to study at U of T and usually visit New Generation and enjoyed their food when I was young and innocent... To be successful up here, they really needs to step up their game!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

I came to New Generation for lunch today. The decor is really nice, and very spacious. It's located on two floors, the top floor is used specifically for teppanyaki. The prices were slightly higher for the food that you get, compared to other sushi places I have been to nearby. We ordered the ume box ($13.95) and the unagi don ($16.95). Both came with a tasty salad and miso soup. The ume box also comes with 3 pieces of cucumber rolls and 3 pieces of sushi rolls. The unagi don was tasty as well, but nothing special. The ume box comes with salmon teppanyaki, rice, 3 pieces of gyoza, a spring roll, and shrimp and vegetable tempura. Again, nothing special.

There are all-you-can-eat options, which we didn't try. But they didn't have different lunch and dinner prices. New Generations is probably a better deal for dinner."}
{"text":"Went here with a larger group for teppynaki, we had a whole flat top and chef for ourselves. 

First and foremost they are very thorough with allergies, they take a lot of care, it was very nice to see. I'd bump the rating to 3.5 as a result of this if possible. 

The food was decent. I found the portions to be a bit skimpy. I understand that it is all you can eat but when the chef is giving you 4-5 cubes of beef and 4-5 cubes of chicken at a time, it does not justify the cost. You may ask for more when the chef is done and they will grill you more but everyone at the table was a bit confused by this. 'One' chicken was assumed to be an entire breast but was just one serving, another 3-4 cubes. 

Half of this experience is dependent on the chef and the show he puts on for everyone at the table. Although he did the standard onion volcano and zucchini toss, he seemed indifferent to everything and didn't really make it fun."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner for two people for teppanyaki, no reservations. The tables looked full but we were still able to get seats within 5 minutes. 

The food is great cause you can order from the sushi menu and then you get the all you can eat teppanyaki. Great chef on the grill doing tricks and stuff and friendly as well. 

4/5 stars because one of the servers seem really rude and unenthusiastic towards customers. Other than that this is a great place to check out"}
{"text":"This place is pricey for an AYCE (think $25-$30 for any meal), but well worth it. Rolls were fantastically presented, with tons of fish and a quite reasonable amount of rice. Sashimi is all-day, and truly unlimited, which is great.

Beef Tataki was delicious - and came with a fantastic dipping sauce. Outside of Japanese food, their Pad Thai was also much better than expected.

Beware of ordering 'white tuna' sashimi, however, as what ultimately came out was some brown, mushy fish. Still palatable, but far from what I anticipated. Apparently, through November 2014, they're giving out a free half-lobster with every meal... without a commensurate price hike. Go there while the promotion's still on."}
{"text":"We did dinner here on Monday and had a very nice experience. 

They were able to accommodate our party of 6 for the teppanyaki on downside we waited for over 1 hr until our show began.

During our waiting time, we had a variety of appetizers and rolls which were great. The salmon sahib was spectacular.

Thoroughly enjoyed the spicy salmon handroll as well. Some dishes were a bit salty but overall it was a very pleasant experience. Definitely will return.  There's room for improvement but for an AYCE in this part of town. It's great."}
{"text":"Some of these reviews were written super early on while this place was learning the ropes and thus does not accurately reflect the rating of this place. It is one of the best sushi places I've been to so far in the area!

It was a cold and windy New Year's Eve when I came here. This place was fairly hidden from the main road but was well worth the search.

Upon entering, Japanese characters and circular graphics adorn the walls, decorative wooden structures stand tall, Edison bulbs  and wood lights hang from the ceiling to light this modern, dual level eatery.

The oooohhh's, aaaahhh's, laughter, and applause rain down from the second level which is designated for AYCE teppanyaki filling the room with warm and welcoming atmosphere.

We are seated on the lower level as we came for sushi and hot tea is promptly delivered. I can't eat seafood due to a taste aversion towards it but I can say that the vegetarian sushi tastes really fresh. The rice is moist and tender (and not at all vinegary as someone stated); the filling likewise. Chicken teriyaki and yakitori were really juicy and not the least bit overcooked. Some things I've never seen before at an AYCE sushi place was the beef tataki (really rare, thinly sliced beef) and creamy udon (it was good but didn't really fit the rest of the food as it seemed like basically udon alfredo but with more rich, brothy alfredo). Gyoza is hot and crispy as always and perfectly seasoned. Short ribs were rich and buttery but the meat itself lacked a bit of seasoning. Overall, a pretty decent amount of choices to choose from.

Top off the sushi with some warm sake and it's pretty damn good food for the GTA area.

The rest of the group who were more seafood inclined, did note that the seafood was fresh and tasty.

Some interesting things to note include: the ability to order tobiko by itself (you get a few tablespoons), you can order custom maki rolls ( I found out by accident when I ordered a tempera yam and avocado roll which wasn't even on the menu), teppanyaki area is designed so that sushi eaters can't see even the slightest action

For dessert there were the usual flavors of ice cream available for a sushi place. I got green tea and red bean. Good stuff but irrelevant as its universally available to any restaurant. They also had the daily special of peach pudding and brownie (super dense but still moist which is a good thing).

Presentation of food was on point for this type of establishment and served on fancy stone dishes.

Service was great. Very attentive wait staff who check up on you every so often and servers from other sections will help you if your server is busy. 

The one thing that I didn't like about this place was that I needed like one more person making sushi since the wait time between orders and food coming out is just slightly above the threshold of my patience.

Price point is quite high and is almost justified by the nice decor, good service,and quality food but considering the location, I imagine rent is relatively cheap and thus could be lower but I could be wrong.

Overall a very enjoyable night here and will definitely come back some time."}
