{"text":"Noting the animosity between Greece and Turkey, I suspect that this restaurant is run by Turks. It's hard to believe that Greeks would do Greek food this badly.   $40 got us: 1 anaemic small salad, mostly lettuce, with two tomato wedges, and a faint dusting of powdered cheese purported to be feta. 1 tub of yogurt that was claimed to be tzatziki, but lacked any flavour other than tangy yogurt 1 pita rolled up to look like a used tissue 1/2 a small container of dolmas, canned quality 1 unseasoned roast vegetable wrap  Frankly an outrageous price for crap-tacular food. In a city with such better Greek options I can not figure out how this place endures."}
{"text":"I found 2 hairs in my salad. My souvlaki dinner was way overpriced - I'd rather walk to Eaton Centre and hit up Jimmy the Greek in the food court than come here ever again."}
{"text":"Terrible, terrible restaurant.   I ordered through Justeat.ca. I ordered a chicken soulaki plate and the description listed rice and potatoes as part of the meal. During selection, I was given the option to add vegetables for 1.99 extra.   As well, I placed one order for Spinach Pies. \"Pies\" means plural, meaning more than one. This seemed fair for the high price of 6.50.   When the order came, the delivery was 15 minutes later than the time stated. There was no rice or potatoes in the meal, making the meal 16.99 for a measly portion of souvaki and vegetables, one tiny piece of pita and no rice or potatoes.   I called to inform them and they claimed that just eat.ca made a mistake as usually vegetables \"replace\" rice and potatoes. 16.99 is a ridiculous rip off of a price for such a measly amount of food - 16.99 can get competitively a huge amount of food and variation at other comparable places.   Incredibly disappointing, ridiculous restaurant that should not be in business."}
{"text":"Just had the Chicken Souvlaki dinner. Price was extremely outrageous. $15 for a small container of rice, a small salad, 4 pieces of chicken and 4 Parisian potatoes. The food was edible but nothing justifiable of the price.  You can get the same quality food at half the price in a mall from a Jimmy The Greek."}
{"text":"When The Healthy Greek first showed up on the Queen West strip, I was like, psh. The owners moved out of the market at Queen and John to set up an establishment that was almost a carbon copy of Sandwich Box - custom salads, grilled sandwiches and soups. I remained faithful to my beloved Sandwich Box and turned a blind eye. For awhile.  As the story goes, Sandwich Box moved out of the Queen St Market and I was out of fancy salad options. So I gave The Healthy Greek a whirl and um, hi new favourite salad: spinach, feta, cucumber, peppers and quinoa with a real nice chicken souvlaki on top (sprinkled with lemon, of course). I'm not sure why I prefer their salads over Sandwich Box - maybe it's the souvlaki, maybe it's the house dressing - but this spot is my JAM. However, a satisfying salad will run me $10, and I'm pretty firmly anti-$10 lunch... so I don't go often.  Oh yeah - they've got chicken and rice and potatoes and shawarma and all kinds of greekish selections to make what looks to be a lovely lunch, but I've yet to stray from the salads so I can't assess the deliciousness of those items. I don't think you can build sandwiches any more, but you can get wraps. Oh, I DO know that the spanakopita is very good, from Athens Bakery if my brain is correct.  Some people I know find some staff members to be a little testy, but the salad lady is always very nice to me (we bonded over dried cranberries). I guess it all comes down to personal experience."}
{"text":"I come here for lunch on occasion. The food is usually pretty good. Today I discovered that coming here for dinner is a bad idea. After 3:30, they switch over to dinner prices, which are on average about 30% higher, but they still serve you the same meal as they would at lunch. There was no turnover of food. Judging by how dry my chicken was, it had been sitting there since the lunchtime rush. My food was also lukewarm.  For a sit down dinner, it's definitely not good value. For lunch, however, it's not bad at all. Go earlier when the food is better, warmer, and cheaper."}
{"text":"WORST service ever ... and the quality of the food not much better!  They completely messed up our take out order and then refused to do anything about it or give us a credit.  Just argued about it.  Absolutely ridiculous!  The food was bland and not great quality.  Way over-priced!  We will never go there or order from there again!"}
{"text":"Considering that falafel is not Greek, I am not sure how healthy this Greek is.  Plus, they were dry dry dry.  I am bummed out on my lunch misfire.  That will teach me to pick a place without consulting Yelp?"}
{"text":"good portions and their salad is a lot fresher than what you'd get from chains like jimmy the greek. their entrees are almost double the price though."}
{"text":"JUST AWFUL.  WHAT I HAD: shawarma wrap + coke  PRICE 9$, and another 3$ for fries!! it might be reasonable for a good sandwich, but for a mediocre wrap it is not worth it.  QUALITY: completely tasteless meat, tasteless wrap, plain spinach and (i swear I am not lying) tomato halves stuffed in my wrap. they topped it all off with some white tasteless liquid  SERVICE: it was average.   so overall bad value!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to the Healthy Greek many times for lunch, as I work just around the corner from the place. Usually they are a bit on the expensive side, and the food is better than the fatty fast food options in the area, but I've been noticing a steady decline in quality over the last year.   I have been ill to the point of vomiting once after eating the souvlaki about 10 months ago and have opted for the vegetarian and salad items since that time. Today, I asked for a Greek salad without onions and a side pita to go. The gentleman preparing the salads of course made it with onions and looked sheepishly at me when he realized his mistake. His solution was to begin shuffling through my salad by hand, picking out the larger bits of onions. I have an allergy to onions and requested that he just remake the salad. He seemed upset and annoyed, and made me a salad that has maybe 3 olives, a piece of tomato, and the rest is oil and lettuce. He then wadded up a pita and tossed it on top of the container for me to pick up.   I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken shwarma, chicken tasted like dried up pieces of grit, like it was sitting there for a few hours. Upsold me a side greek salad, but then overcharged me  on the order, i didn't want to argue and just left. Hours later my stomach was feeling not so great and i believe they do not follow sanitary guidelines in their kitchen. Never again!!!"}
{"text":"This place has to be one of the worst places I've been to in all of Toronto.  My boyfriend and I were starving and on Queen Street and were looking for a healthy, decently nice place to eat when we came upon The Healthy Greek. We looked at the menu and it looked fairly reasonable. However, once we sat down, things just got worse and worse. My boyfriend wanted to order the BBQ Chicken and we were told they were out of it (even though this was well before closing time). This wouldn't normally be a big deal and he simply ordered the chicken shawarma and a pop instead. I decided to try something new and went with the beef gyro.  When the food came, we realized that they had served my boyfriend chicken souvlaki. He was kind of frustrated. We waited awhile for his drink to come, which never did. My meal was horrible, to say the least and I wound up giving over half of it to my boyfriend. I asked him if beef gyro normally tastes like that and he said no. Both of our meals were horribly dry and must have been the remnants from the day. Also, our water glasses were never refilled and we were never served again from the time the food was placed in front of us until we paid.  Then, when the bill came, we found that what I had actually wasn't beef gyro, it was lamb gyro. Kind of a big difference. My boyfriend was pretty angry at this point. At least the prices were the same for everything and they never charged us for the pop he ordered and never got. My boyfriend wanted to leave a really small tip but he was forced to leave a certain amount. For ~$30, it was way too much for very sub-par food.  I think the only way I would return to The Healthy Greek would be if I needed a salad for lunch (lunch meals are much cheaper and the salad ingredients looked much fresher than what we were served). The only good thing I can say about this place is that the meal came with a huge serving of rice, a small salad and some potatoes, so it was definitely filling.   Overall, if you find yourself on Queen Street, you can do much better."}
{"text":"I highly doubt this place is healthy. I can still feel the salt sting on my tongue and lips hours after my meal. No salad, no pita, no tzatsiki with the chicken dinner. If you want greek or something edible for that matter go elsewhere."}
{"text":"I've stopped into the Healthy Greek once in a while in the past, and usually found their food to be passable, though fairly overpriced.  After spending the past 4 days recovering from the food poisoning that I and my friends received from eating their chicken shawarma (the only meal we all had in common), however, I will never, ever return.  I seriously question their food handling practices... your mileage may vary, but if you eat here, beware!"}
{"text":"If i could give minus stars i would.. Ordered this crap from Justeat.ca and realized there was no option to change the sides. Called the restaurant asked if they could change the rice and potatoes to fries instead was told they dont normally offer this but would in this case.   Wife ordered Feta fries and a Gyro. I told the man on the phone that the Chicken Souvlaki dinner should have zero feta on it as i am allergic.  Dinner arrived 15 mins later than proposed time on the website. Well here is what happened.   1. two trays of fries were provided both with some type oregano seasoning on it. The Feta fries failed to exist both fries were plain.  2. Wifes Gyro extremely dry missing Taziki sauce.  3. Chicken Souvlaki dinner still came with a mountain of rice that seemed pretty stale and smelt funky along with 4 pieces of dried out chicken. A shoe would have probably tasted much better with a bit of Tiziki on it rather than that nasty chicken.  4. Greek salad came in a plastic take out box. Probably pre-packed one week ago as when i finally opened it up found it covered in Feta. Wife tried and tomato and cucumber from the box and told me they were mushy.  I dont normally wish this on local businesses but feel compelled to say i really hope they close down. Ripping off people $50 for a pile of crap is not fair.  Karma my friends."}
{"text":"Definitely a miss.  I gave this place a try attempting to get a quick bite before the opera.  The saltiest chicken souvlaki I've ever had on top of the soggiest pita I've ever eaten in a restaurant.  Save yourself the trouble.  The also tried to charge my card a higher amount than the register..glad I caught it."}
{"text":"Found this place while walking down Queen.  The space is a little tight during a busy rush, but it works.  My chicken wrap was very tasty but it was a little small for the price.  The wrap and a bottle of iced tea ran me just shy of $10.  Spending $10 on lunch should leave me stuffed and this place fell short.  The menu is quite large and have a huge selection of plates, wraps, and salads.  Just be ready to pay more than $10 for lunch."}
{"text":"Rushed, disorganized and pricey. One shwarma for $8 is a bit much. If you want to order, just go right up to the cash...it feels like youre cutting line, but thats fine apparently. Two others in line with me felt as odd, but someone behind us gave us the greenlight that this is de rigour for THG. Oh, for gods sake if you want hot sauce, order it at the cash. I asked after paying and the cash guy almost bit my head off...he then yelled down the line to the guy to add hot sauce. Suppose I could have done that? Meh. Wont be back. Too many other options in the area."}
{"text":"The food is somewhat reasonable, but HOLY SHIT IT IS RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE. I never criticize places for prices, because you can just see how much something costs before you order it. In fact, I hate it when people criticize fancy restaurants for price. But this is a shithole with legitimately huge prices. For 18 dollars (plus delivery charge!) you get HALF a chicken breast, and 3 potato golfballs, and about an 8 ball of tzatziki. There are about 30 similar places in the neighborhood so just never go here."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this place when exploring Queen St. towards downtown..   I stopped because I had a beef/lamb craving that afternoon. I order and shared a wrap ($5.89) I like the freshness of the ingredients they use for this place. I can definitely taste the difference between this place and bad unfresh ingredients. The portion can be a little bit more if you ask me, but it was good overall, so no complains on that front...   On the side note, they have a weird in-dine policy that didn't apply to me when I went. But if you dine in they charge you more, and that $5.89 price is for TO-GO orders..."}
{"text":"First you will note that the wraps here cost about $5 more than anywhere else in the city.  The decor is cheap, sit down, bare bones. A luncheon place that doesn't really command $11.99 for a chicken wrap and \"salad\". If the food was any good it would be slightly excusable. The wrap was small - again, smaller than any other wrap in the city; maybe a third of the size of a typical shwarma. The meat was dry and had no flavour. The fillings were paltry. The bare mimimum of tzaziki sauce was used. Such a disappointment. If you dine in, you are forced to add a salad to your wrap. (take out wrap is 7.99, so the salad is $4.) it's hard to call it a salad: a dozen wilted pieces of spinach, a tomato slice and some shredded carrot. Embarrassing. Out of all the eateries I've been to I'd say this was the worst in downtown Queen St. AVOID people who enjoy good food!"}
{"text":"If you are unable to honour delivery times, by over an hour, you should probably rethink your delivery zones. JustEat.ca is a great app, and they should ban you from being one of their participating restaurants.   The food was cold when it arrived, but I could tell it had initially been quite tasty. Lovely garlicky tzaziki. But I don't really feel like complimenting them too much after they made us wait so. long. for it to arrive. Who eats dinner at 11:30 pm? By the time it arrived we were all so accidentally drunk, hangry and ridiculous."}
