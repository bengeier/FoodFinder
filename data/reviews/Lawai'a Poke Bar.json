{"text":"One of the worst poke bowls I've tried. The Lazy California was drowned in a watery sauce, and The OG had absolutely no toppings except for some sesame and tiny nori stripes. If you want avocado or seaweed salad you have to pay extra.  You can find far better poke places in Toronto for the price"}
{"text":"Fish is really fresh and ingredients are local. This is more like NYC poke spots than the other ones in Toronto."}
{"text":"Pieces of fish were too small. The person preparing the bowl drenched the poke mix in their shoyu sauce then she literally gave me around 10 dots of tobiko and another 5 when I asked for more. Flavors were okay."}
{"text":"My absolute favourite poke place in the GTA (and I have tried a few others). I find it to be the best place if you want to DIY your own bowl price wise and the taste is always there. The only add ons you have to pay for is avocado, crab salad or seaweed salad. Everything else is available for adding into your bowl, and the staff there always allow me to mix two types of protein, or two types of rice/ zoodles base - even when I buy a mini bowl. Staff are super friendly and patient, and always top up my bowl that it nearly overflows. I've gone 3-4 times and plan on still going back when I need my poke fix. Highly recommended to give it a try.   I always get their recommended sauces of sriracha mayo, Lawai'a sauce and Hawaiian sesame oil."}
{"text":"overpriced. $10.75 for. like super small bowl.  I custom built my own. I supposed it will be the same quantity / weight as their prebuilt bowls they have on the menu. Yet, nope. I was wrong. Never again. I dont recommend anyone to use their built your own bowl, ripped off!"}
{"text":"The poke market in Toronto is pretty hot! Dare I say that Lawai'a Poke Bar is one of the very best? I truly think their fish is superb. Whoever their supplier is, stay with them. It's been sushi-grade quality for me every single time.   There are a great amount of premium toppings and you can really go nuts with those bowls. But no matter how many toppings you pick, they will make it super pretty for here. Simple, clear packaging helps the colours pop. The bar to the right when you get in is best for taking photos, with the daylight from the door.   Nothing like a good poke party!!!"}
{"text":"More like 4.5 stars. I have been coming back to this poke bar time and time again when i crave for something healthy and fresh salmon. I always get their Lazy California bowl with either half brown rice and zoodles(zuchinni noodles) or all zoodles with salmon, cucumber, crab salad, pickled ginger, tobiko, green onion, crispy onion, Lawai'a sauce and sriracha mayo. I love the seasoning they put on the salmon that seeps into the noodles/rice cause its so flavourful. You also have the option of building your own poke bowl which is good if you want to customize it. I enjoy all the toppings in this poke bowl especially the crab salad! If you get all zoodles I recommend you eat it right away or very soon after cause it gets all soggy and wet. The place is small but very modern looking with marble on the tables and part of the walls. They also carry some ELXR drinks. I got the activated charcoal lemonade flavour in the name of After Party. From time to time I crave the lazy cali bowl and that is what keeps me coming back for more. Prices are Little - $8.95 Regular - $11.95   Kahuna - $14.95 both for classic bowls and customized bowls. I need to go back and try the other poke bowls but for now Im happy with the lazy cali =)"}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty meals served by friendly and enthusiastic staff.  I really like the \"build your own\" with the zucchini noodles so one can manage their macros as they see fit.  Really liked the flavor of the ingredients and also thought the portions were reasonably sized.  Keep it up!  I'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"Ordered the regular size build your own bowls for dinner on Thursday night through Ritual. They look small but are the perfect amount of food for dinner and reasonably priced. I found the add ins to be great portion wise except for the green onions and ginger. I asked for both and thought they had forgotten to include them in the bowl. I eventually found one piece of ginger and I'm still pretty sure they forgot the green onion. Overall though the bowl was tasty and the sauces were great. I could have used a bit more of the wasabi mayo as I like a bit more sauce but I'll make sure I ask for a bit more next time I order."}
{"text":"I'd never been here before. The person working behind the counter was very helpful explaining how it all worked. They were accommodating in adding all the fixings I wanted to my poke without an up-charge (I believe the avocado and seaweed is a couple dollars more). I got my bowl to go and I felt full and happy after. Nice recyclable packaging as well. Sure, it may cost a little more for a smaller portion size compared to what you might eat elsewhere but....healthy fresh and delish are most important for me."}
{"text":"Made a visit to this location on King Street. For some reason, when I was trying to locate it, I passed by it twice before I found it. (It's right beside the Subway (the sandwich shop)).   The interior was really nice. Looks very modern and nice to take a photo for your social media outlets. I also like how their wooden chopstick covers and spoons are pink. I asked them what was popular and they said the Lazy California. So I tried it in the Kahuna size!   I chose half zucchini noodles and half brown rice for my base. It came with salmon, cucumber, crab salad, pickled ginger, tobiko, green onion, crispy onion, Lawai'a sauce and sriracha mayo. After mixing everything together, I was excited to take a bite. However after eating midway,  I did not really enjoy how soggy and wet everything was in my poke. It must been the Lawai'a sauce. I find that it did not mix well with the poke bowl at all.   Pricing is fair since I find that Toronto poke places have similar pricing.  Overall, nice poke place but I thought that one key element made the poke bowl fall flat."}
{"text":"the customer service seemed fine at first. i was impressed by the experience that i had until i went home and realized i was given the wrong order. i came back and informed the worker that i had been given the wrong meal. mistakes happen and that's not a big deal, however, being rude and defensive is. the workers silently rolled their eyes at each other implying i was putting them off and the first worker argued that it was my fault. it was all very unnecessary. i finally got my food and it tasted terrible. a waste of $18 and my peace of mind"}
{"text":"Ordered a couple of bowls via uber eats for friends visiting from west coast.   As the other reviews said the best is to customize your own bowls as you can get what you like and it actually costed a dollar less than the premade ones.  The flavors were great and the ingredients definitely fresh. The sauces were well done and accentuate the fish. We all got brown rice and was cooked perfectly too.  One downside of the store is their stinginess with the protein toppings. The bowl was 75% rice and I'm being generous here. I have had poke in Kauai and LA and there is at least 3x as much fish compared to the Lawai'a poke.  If you choose to pay the extra $3-6 to upgrade the size of your bowl, you are just buying extra rice."}
{"text":"Ohh a delicious poke bar that is super close to our apartment!  It's not Poke in Hawaii, but it's pretty decent! The salmon and tuna we ordered tasted fresh and delicious and the sauces were great! I personally enjoyed the sauces here more than other places I've tried (try their house sauce).  For me, even the mini portion was more than enough for lunch...the regular is like dinner sized, so portions are generous here since they pack it all down. Will be back!"}
{"text":"If you looking for a new poke bowl place to go this is a must try place!  I came here cause I heard that they launched their new Hawaii Style bowl, it doesn't have a base and has extra protein and veggies!   I got the lazy California and I was pleased with my choice so much protein which was a plus for me the salmon was fresh and tasted delicious. I thought that having no base wouldn't make me full but by the end of it I was stuffed.  I would definitely recommend it and would totally come back for more cause it's that good!  IG@tdotfoods"}
{"text":"Lawai's is a small poke place at the corner of King and Bathurst. Inside it is beautifully decorated including a wall full of green plants with a pink neon sign which many people like to take pictures of their poke bowls against.  Inside there are only two long tables against the wall that can seat around a dozen people. They get pretty busy during the lunch hour as I see that they try to fulfill the online orders first so there will be a waiting time if you go at lunch.  I tried some of their new winter menu items such as the Miso Soup which comes in a cute cup that says \"You Make Miso Happy\" and Edamame which is tossed in their Lawai's sauce plus chili flakes. These items paired well with my customized poke bowl and the soup is a nice option to help keep warm in this cold weather.  Overall I enjoyed my customized bowl and the salmon tasted fresh. The Lawai's sauce is my favourite and makes the poke bowl taste so much more delicious!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for lunch today. There are about 12 seats at two counters, and you can also take out. There are three sizes of poke bowls, with the medium one costing around $11 I think, and that was plenty for a good lunch for me. You can build your own poke bowl, or pick one of their daily specials. I decided to build my own, and used a base of zucchini noodles instead or rice. You then choose your protein. I chose the tuna. Next you pick from a TON of toppings, sauces and garnishes. I can't even remember all the wonderful goodies that landed in my bowl, but the end result was a phenomenal lunch! They also sell a few lines of healthy juices and drinks. It's a super cute place and the staff are amazing."}
{"text":"Relatively new spot and worth checking out! The poke is fresh and super tasty. I had the The O.G. Classics bowl regular $11.95 Very filling and way more than enough for lunch. 1/2 brown rice and 1/2 zucchini noodles was perfect. Kind of expense extra $3 for 1/4 avocado. They have gluten free dressing as well."}
{"text":"Amazing poke and generous portions, all for a reasonable price. I recommend the Lazy California with extra crab salad--so good! The staff are so nice too which doesn't hurt. A favourite for grabbing lunch on work days."}
{"text":"This place is amazing all the food is so fresh. The owners were so nice and helpful! Super satisfying for lunch and dinner. I would definitely recommend half zucchini noodles half rice as a base it's a nice filling mix! Can't wait to go back for more!"}
{"text":"I love that you can build your own bowl here. Their tofu is great!   If it's your first time having Poke, just ask the staff questions. They are super helpful and the ingredients are all really awesome!   I tend to just pile things on top of rice and it turns out really delicious, so I'm sure you can't mess it up too much.   If you like sushi, you'll like poke! And I was happily surprised at how vegetarian friendly it was since tofu is one of the protein options."}
{"text":"I came here a couple times when they first opened and it was great. This time the girls behind the desk did not know how to operate the cash and the mix was wrong. Too much sauce or something. For $18.00 you can find a much better dinner then  a bowl from this place.  It is so close to home that at some point I will give it another try, but a big let down compared to a couple months ago."}
{"text":"I came here around 3 times for their poke bowls. It's small and straight to the point. You can customize your own poke bowl or choose the ones they have on the menu. I'm usually in and out in 15. They work very efficiently."}
{"text":"Love the variety and freedom of choice with the food, especially with the toppings. And all the choices available sounded absolutely fresh and delicious! The 3 available bowl sizes where also really well-portioned. I had eaten much anything that early afternoon, but the friend I was with had, and so she got the small size and I the medium. And they were perfect! We were both equally full and satisfied (full, but not to the point where we had to roll ourselves home aha). They do charge an extra $3 for certain toppings like avocados, but I personally couldn't resist an add-on like that!  Even though the place is quite small, it's not stuffy or claustrophobic; just cozy and still feels spacious because of the spacing of seats and general openness in how they arranged the room. The vibes are absolutely wonderful and chill, and decoration is super aesthetically pleasing; both simple and Hawaiian vacation-esque. Workers were very friendly and patient (with my indecision), which was great because I love being able to have a normal, human conversation with employees of restaurants and stores.  In conclusion, totally worth what I paid despite my typically avoiding spending this amount of money on lunch (around $17 with the medium-sized bowl, the extra avocado, and tax + tip of course)! Definitely worth at least a few visits in your lifetime !!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of my top 3 poke bowl places in all of downtown toronto! The shop is a cute clean place that makes you want to visit Hawaii! The bowl itself is amazing! I especially love the Lazy California! They let you replace certain toppings without extra cost! I love the zucchini noodles so I always ask for half rice and half zucchini noodles! Definitely recommend this amazing place!!"}
{"text":"Great flavorful poke! I love the lazy California poke. The portion is pretty big. The place emits calming tropical vibes."}
{"text":"Cute, tiny place that serves up deliciously fresh poke bowls at a premium price. They also serve tacos, creviche and desserts as well as poke bowls.   TIPS: - Don't come during rush hours unless you like crowds in small places. - Order and pay on the left side where the cashier is; menu will be on the wall to your left. - Grab one of their interesting drinks from the refrigerated case: Rise Kombucha, alkaline water, cold pressed juices, coconut water espresso, or Arizona Green Tea with honey and ginseng. - Order the \"build your own\" bowl, you'll get more for your money. - Listen for your name to be called then head on over to the right side and tell them which toppings, sauces and drizzle you want added. This is the time to tell them if you want a lot or a little or on the side. - Eat in, they'll pile your bowl higher since they don't have to fit the lid on. - You can order 1/2 rice and 1/2 zucchini noodles. - if you don't know which sauce to get, or if you just like variety, you can order one sauce on half, a different sauce on the other half and a third sauce in a container to go. Variety is the spice of life! -  You can have everything listed on the BYOB menu."}
{"text":"Cute little poke spot at the corner of King and Bathurst. It's small, so easy to miss, but well worth stopping by.   The decor first of all, is incredibly cute and Hawaiian-themed. Very bright, has a wall of greenery, and a cute neon pink sign. Lots of great backdrops for taking photos of your poke bowl. There are two long tables along the walls, but limited seating. It's more of a grab and go type of place.  I ordered their Lazy California bowl, though you can also build your own if you don't like their set options. My favourite thing is that you can customize your base, and have zucchini noodles instead of rice. I opted for half zucchini noodles and half brown rice, and loved how much lighter the bowl became. Traditional poke bowls with rice have always had too much rice for me. The toppings were all incredibly fresh and flavourful. I especially loved the soy sauce that they gave me on the side. It was a bit sweeter than the usual soy sauces, and also had a bit of a kick to it.  Their bowls are smaller than most other poke places, but that didn't bother me as I have a smaller appetite and have trouble finishing my meals most of the time. This was the perfect size for me.  I love this place and will most definitely come again to DIY my own bowl, and try some of their other set bowls as well!"}
{"text":"Love the option to build your own bowl!  You can choose as much mix in as you want and can choose half and half with rice and zucchini noodle.  Don't miss the crab salad, is definitely my favourite!  Will come back to try the OG tuna bowl next time!"}
{"text":"First time trying Lawai'a and sad to say it was underwhelming and disappointing.  Ordered through Ritual and by the time I got to the restaurant my order was ready at the counter and my boyfriend's bowl wasn't even made yet. We both ordered the Lazy Cali Bowl with the exception of avocado on one bowl and seaweed salad for the other. My bowl weighed much heavier than his, which seems like there was a more generous amount.  The girl behind the counter did not even apologize or acknowledge that she hadn't started his order and we ended up waiting an extra 15 mins for the food to be made even though we had placed both orders at the same time for pick up.  I wouldn't recommend coming here for poke as there's better options in the city that is more bang for buck."}
{"text":"Great taste, variety of options... but way too expensive. I had the regular sized \"OG\" bowl, with avocado and seaweed salad which were both extra. The total was $20 without a drink. It was filling but not too sure if it's worth the price."}
{"text":"refreshing poke! and cute interior. not a lot of space for seating but i usually get take out anyways. their zucchini base is sooo good! i'd choose that over the rice!"}
{"text":"I've visited the location and ordered from ubereats numerous times, always fresh and never disappointing. They've also started a loyalty rewards program - 7 poke bowls and the eighth one free :)"}
{"text":"Nice little spot on King and Bathurst. Small store front but really friendly staff! A friend and I got the regular Hawaiian bowl and loved the flavours. Mine had both tuna and salmon, on a bed of brown rice, and all the works. I added seaweed salad to it (coz I love seaweed!!!) and also added sesame oil. They didn't have any tap water so we were asked to buy mineral which I honestly don't like! But overall a nice experience! Seems more like a take out spot though than a place to hang out. That's probably the only downer!"}
{"text":"I walked by with my friend, it was surprisingly a very good portion with a great amount of seafood! I would definitely come back again.  Service and staff were very friendly, they patiently explained their menu and some 'healthy' drinks that I have yet to try."}
{"text":"Tons to love about this. The ingredients taste fresh and light, I love that you can get zucchini noodles instead of rice (or half and half), and the specials can be really unique.  The only thing I'd say is that the tofu isn't necessarily as flavourful as some (if that's your jam), but it's not fried, so that's always a nice change. And there's not nearly as much sauce or flavours added - so it depends what you're into. It's summery and tasty, there's just less added compared to some.   Plus, avocado and seaweed salad are extra, but not at most places for veggie poke. You'll rack up close to $20 for a single bowl in no time.  Honestly tasty, though!"}
{"text":"Came here once, bad service but food was great. Came here again, awful service and disappointing food. First of all, there was no acknowledgement of me being there to order. Someone came in after me, seemed to be a friend of the guy working here, and they took his order ahead of me! When it was my turn I asked, is this not where you order, confused that they didn't take my order. Then, the waiting began....keep in mind there were two customers in the store so you can imagine my surprise when they asked if I had ordered something after 10 minutes of waiting? Zero recollection of my order. They offered me a dessert as an apology. Very disappointed when I got my bowl since it was about half the size of their friend's who ordered ahead of me. Also, there was a very unappealing kinda stringy-ness to the sauce or something. So, tried it twice now, won't be back."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars. Lawai'a is in my top 3 go-to's for Poke. For about three months, my friend and I had Lawai'a at least two times a week. This is definitely a take out spot, I usually order on ritual to avoid waiting. My favourite bowl has to be the lazy California with added seaweed salad. The portions here just work for me, there's never too much rice or not enough toppings. The only time I would avoid this place is in the evening because the ingredients aren't as fresh."}
{"text":"Great option for something fresh, light and healthy. I built my own bowl via Uber Eats and was not disappointed. The salmon was fresh, the veggies were bright and crisp and the portions are more than fair. I would definitely give them another go whenever I'm in a bind for some Poke.  I also tacked a tuna sushi taco onto my order. Other than the fact that it did not travel very well, it was a hit."}
{"text":"So delicious and fresh but why is the small size SO small?! Expected something that was more than a few bites :( next time I'm definitely getting the regular size even though it's a bit more expensive. This place is giving my go-to poke place a run for its money!"}
{"text":"Shut up and take my money. I love this place and am developing a slight addition. If I eat one more OG I may have to pull a Jeremy Piven and claim I've had too much mercury and retire from productive society.   No but seriously, I always order the Kahuna Size and the helping of protein is very adequate. The seasonings are just right and don't overpower the fish. There's a beautiful combination of sweetness, tartness, saltiness and it just all works really well together. The sushi rice base is quite good too.  Compared to other poke places I've been to in Toronto this is definitely my favourite."}
{"text":"It's good, it's filling and it's healthier than anything you can get from room service if you're staying at a nearby hotel. Had whatever the salmon poke bowl was called and it was exactly what the doctor ordered. After a long day spent running around or eating at your desk, it's nice to come here, grab a delicious meal and take it somewhere where you can unwind."}
{"text":"went here for lunch because of the 10% off promotion that they had. quaint lil place on king west, however, the price is a bit more than a regular poke stop. i got a summer special with zucchini base...everything was fresh but small & expensive. my small poke came to a total of ~10.5$. I'd prefer square fish over this place."}
{"text":"I would say this is a 3.5 star experience.  Had this been my first bowl of poke, it may have been a 4. However, after experiencing the likes of North Poke and Poke Eats, I've come to expect much more out of my poke.  The place is small, with limited seating, but overall appears clean. The wall of greenery and the neon lettering is a nice touch. Staff were friendly and made my bowl quite quickly.  I got the Sweet Maui Heat which includes \"salmon and tuna, cucumber, green onion, spicy mayo, sweet soy glaze, tempura bits\". The fish tasted quite fresh and was plenty in terms of ratio to rice. The tempura bits provided a nice crispy texture and the sauces were mild---a  good balance without overwhelming the fish.  I felt the portion size was a little under (at the given price point) compared to others and while the overall quality was above average, there is too much restraint/too simple. I will have to come back to try their customization options (I heard this is the better route to get more volume for your money) and other varieties to  provide a better judgment."}
{"text":"Orders twice from uber eats. Both times really small meat portions.   Fresh but not worth it."}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of poke in Toronto. I'm talking A LOT of poke to the point where I basically consider myself a poke master. I should probably have mercury poisoning from the amount of raw fish that I eat. Who cares! I've got an iron stomach, I'm the Ash Ketchum of the poke game and Lawai'a Poke Bar is my newest dojo.  Considering I was too lazy to bother making dinner tonight, the poke bowl that I went for was named the Lazy California (large size). It was kind of a misnomer to be honest with you guys. There was nothing lazy about this bowl. Looked beautiful, tasted amazing and was a massive portion. I'm so used to stingy poke bowls in Toronto that I always opt for a large, which usually means I'll STILL be hungry. Not here! Usually I'd describe the flavours to you fine people but there were so many different ones and every bite was a party in my mouth. No need to RSVP though, you aren't invited. I need to make room for more poke! Plus my mom said no parties while shes out of town. The fish was great quality and I felt like a very healthy guy eating my bowl. It was a bit on the expensive side, but its what you expect for Toronto poke. Plus, sometimes you just need to flex.  Service was also awesome and they were very helpful, polite and cool. I would probably hang out with them. Let's crack a cold one at Trinity Bellwoods."}
{"text":"Ordered for pick up through Ritual. Have to say it's not my favourite place for a poke bowl- I thought there weren't enough mix ins for a premade bowl and overall it was rather dry. Adding to the fact that it was on the small side and fairly pricey compared to others- I'm not going to be returning. Even with the 10% off coupon they gave us."}
{"text":"The ingredients are fresh so they taste good but there are a few things I don't like about this poke place. For starter, the fish isn't marinated, which is for me the base of poke. Then the tuna I had was cut into tiny pieces, which I don't really like, because I like to have a strong taste of fish (the salmon looked like it was cut into bigger pieces though) Also I like the option of making your own bowl, ans you can put everything you want for the same price so this is a good thing. But I'm disappointed in the lack of signature bowls, because I like places where they create special recipes instead of letting you assemble random things.  But to finish, even if the price may look a little high, the portion are generous so I don't see it as an issue.  Was okay all in all, but will not be my go-to place in terms of poke. And as a side not the location of the menu is not convenient because you can't grab them easily if there is people in front of you."}
{"text":"Ordered the Sweet Maui Heat. Was really looking forward to the mango in it. There was no mango. Flavours were so-so. But if there was mango..."}
{"text":"Good vibes, nice addition to the king-bathurst neighborhood"}
{"text":"WHAT TO TRY??  Their customizable poke bowl!!   I don't recommend the bowls that they have on the menu because the good thing with their customizable bowls is that you can add as many ingredients you want in your bowl! As long as it fits in your bowl, they can keep topping it off with ingredients. You can have either chicken, salmon sashimi bits or tuna sashimi bits as your protein...or have salmon and tuna half half, so a mix of the two. Another thing to note is if you feel like you don't have enough sauce, you can always ask for more! That's the good thing for dining at this restaurant!  The restaurant or poke stop (haha, get the pun?) is not that big and if you don't look carefully, you may miss the restaurant because the space it occupies on the st is so small.   The poke bowls are good and I couldn't finish the mid size bowl so goes to show their pokebowl sizes are generously filled with a lot of food.   One of the disappointing things about this restaurant I'd like to point out is the restaurant itself. It's filled with fruit flies!!! Everywhere. On the walls. Dazzling around you while you eat and sometimes behind the counter. If you ask me, it's pretty disgusting and not something a customer wants to see. I hope they improve on this because they're lucky they get a lot of take outs or uber eat customers, but if these customers were to come in and see what the restaurant's condition is, they might be scared away!!   Last tip?  Order the customizable poke bowl and don't be afraid to put in a mayo and a soy sauce into your bowl. You can add the soy sauce for the rice and top the poke bowl with some mayo. Add seaweed salad to the poke bowl if you also want an additional crunch to your already filled up bowl."}
{"text":"Best poke in Toronto! Good portion of fish and love the zucchini noodle base. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I assume all these high ratings are because people were blinded by their amazing aesthetics or never actually had actual poké before.   If you're an instablogger then I'd definitely recommend you check this place out cause 10/10 marble walls + gold lettering everywhere.  If you're serious about food then I'd definitely would not recommend you waste your money here. Honestly the ordering system is a complete MESS. Came here during a weekday lunch rush:  1. No apparent line was formed and no signs on where you're supposed to order/pay/pickup  2. Realize you're suppose to pay on the left side next to the mirror - it honestly doesn't even matter what you order cause the cashier tells me to just tell the poké maker when it was my turn which means a) I could've gotten away with ordering a small and getting a large b) didn't have to pay $3 extra for avocado, seaweed salad, crab salad (how tf are those tiny portions worth $3??? Just go to Chipotle for crying out loud)  3. Wait in another line on your right side until one of the clueless poké makers asks who's next rather than going off of their iPad that states what was ordered in what sequence  4. Reiterate your order for a second time to the poké maker, then cluelessly add toppings to your bowl even though you ordered The OG which had preselected toppings (what was the point of that???)  5. Take your bowl to the nice seats and grab the pink utensils and snap a super aesthetic photo even though I had less than a palm size of fish and 80% of my bowl was the carb (or the zucchini noodles they offered)   Honestly so irked that it was confusing af to order and there was no clear methodology and the taste was nowhere near worth $14 for a regular sized bowl. Don't get the hype of this place - you can find better poké elsewhere in Toronto (like North Poké for instance)."}
{"text":"I went to Lawai'a a few weeks ago for their soft launch. The staff were so friendly and the food was amazing. The fact that you can build your old bowl is everything, especially for us picky folks! Everything tasted amazing, the portion size was very generous and they gave lots of meat. You are also allowed to mix bases which is nice! One of the options that they have is zucchini noodles which is a nice change from boring old leaves. Their banana pudding is the bomb .com too. And did I mention the decor? Stunning!  Definitely one of the better poke spots in Toronto. Check them out! You won't be disappointed :)"}
{"text":"Not impressed, it was a while (4 months since I have tried this place), the fish wasn't the freshest, and the zucchini noodles where very watery. The bowl itself was alright, but not enough toppings, and no spice."}
