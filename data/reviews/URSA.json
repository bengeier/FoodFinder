{"text":"Heading out to a favourite Ossington spot we spy that the former Bar_One space is once again open, with an appealing glow.   The space has been transformed and modernized in a really cool way. If you were a fan of Bar_One (and I was), let it go. The marble is gone and along with it the beautiful dropped panels and the lighting. Instead it's a kind of start black paint on raw cinderblock & brick. And what looks like charred planks (painted gloss black) along one section of the wall near the front. Beautiful lighting, very original, and apparently it's all LED ...   The menu is short and simple. We didn't take in the appetizers but went straight for the mains.   I had the chicken so let me describe this. It's a kind of combo locally sourced/100 mile/macrobiotic approach to cuisine except that the results are more appealing than I expect. Ever been to an earnest 100 mile kinda place or vegan/natural food place, the plate comes and the food looks good and you dig in and then you get a mouthful of wtf?   That's not what this is.   The chicken is cooked perfectly (which means barely). It sits with the polenta and the greens and beans/sprouts of a kind and a fibrous smoked mushroom. It has the right balance of flavours, savoury, sweet, and salt.  The polenta alone is worth mentioning ... beautiful viscous texture and taste.  We ordered a Rioja wine, this one is \"un-oaked\" (did I get that right). A young Rioja aged in, basically, concrete vats. Very soft. Great choice.   To get a real sense of the concept in the menu, order the \"Milk and Honey\" dessert. The ricotta is boiled upon order, served with things like real bee pollen, honeycomb, pomegranate, dried raisins, it's both sweet like a dessert should be ... but it's light, nutritious, and natural.  We also order the chocolate mousse and pumpkin. There is no dairy in the chocolate and just enough sweet. But with the pumpkin and other purees on the plate, it is as decadent and satisfying as any mousse you've had.  On it's second day of being open, the place looks like it has been running for a while. No timing problems. No gaffes.   One of the owners personally brings our desserts which is great. When you meet someone who really loves what he's created and what he's doing it's uplifting.   A great find on this Friday night."}
{"text":"Good food but very, very small portions, not in any way proportionate to the prices (appetizers 13-20$, entrees around 25$). It seemed to us as though the whole ceremony of explaining what the ingredients of every dish were was meant to make us appreciate the very little food we actually got. The whole experience seemed like a sketch about gourmet restaurants.  We didn't bother to stay for desserts (12-16$), and will definitely not be back."}
{"text":"I went to URSA last night and can honestly say that it was the best meal I have ever had in Toronto.  The service and atmosphere were great and the food was unbelievably good.  We started with the raw spotted prawn salad  which was a perfect blend of flavors and textures.  For my main I had the whit fish and my boyfriend had the water buffalo.  I had a late lunch yesterday and leading into the main I was worried that I would not even come close to finishing as I wasn't that hungry but I literally scraped every last bit of food off of that plate - it was beyond delicious!  My boyfriend could not get over the flavors of the water buffalo and the sides and sauces that filled his plate.    I will definitely be returning and highly recommenced anyone give this place a try!"}
{"text":"...Cocktail list was extensive and creative.  We went for a Hopewell (Bourbon, House Vanilla Brandy, Crab Apple Shrub) and the not-on-the-menu Giftbox (Gin, Egg White, Rosewater Syrup, Cucumber).  The former was heavy hitting but gorgeously aromatic, while the latter (my servers great suggestion) was tart, but refreshingly smooth with just enough floral sweetness.  The menu was sophisticated, yet inviting. There was a generous spread of different protein and accompaniment offerings, without any duplications of flavours. I really appreciate how challenging this must be, particularly for a menu that changes often.  I had read that the portions at Ursa were small for the price, and I can't say I disagree. However, keeping with Ursa's theme of celebrating the inherent healthful qualities of good quality ingredients, I felt it was appropriate. The two of us left satisfied, but certainly not \"full\" or uncomfortable, ideal for going out afterwards to continue a night of fun. This is what we had:   Raw Bread with House made Cultured Butter- This was a light and delicious starter, my only complaint was that it was maybe a bit too dainty (aka. I wanted more). We received a few lovely beet and sumac crackers, and a few fennel peanut ones, served with two selections of deliciously luscious butter (sea salt and roasted garlic).  The star for me was the beet, which had a mild sweet and deep spice flavour, and paired beautifully with the sea salt butter.  House made Tofu- Radish Bonito, Nori, Seedlings, Dashi- I was skeptical of this at first, but it turned out to be the winner of the two first courses. The tofu was moist, creamy and sumptuous, which was a perfect accompaniment to the crispy fried radish cakes.  What really tied everything together was the flawless dashi broth, which had a defined umami flavour, and a perfect level of salt.  Duck Egg- Sunchoke, Nigella, Bitter Greens, Sauce Gribiche- Unlike the tofu, which was perfectly seasoned, we both found this one a bit bland, surprising for all of the fatty elements on the plate. I also found everything to be luke warm, perhaps as a result of careful (and beautiful) plating and the dish sitting too long.  The wait may also have something to do with the fact that my duck egg yolk was not nearly as runny as I had hoped, so my beautiful brioche toasts didn't have much purpose. Having said that, from a texture and flavour perspective (aside from the seasoning situation), this was very well balanced. The sunchoke hash, speckled with spicy bitter nigella seed, was a beautiful accompaniment, and the gribiche (a mayo-like sauce usually with pickles, tarragon and capers) brought a bit of relief from the bitter dandelion greens.  Wild Boar- Toasted Barley, Turnip, Kohlrabi, Quince Mostarda, Huckleberry- This was the star dish of the day.  The boar was moist, flavourful, and perfectly seasoned, and it's richness was balanced out beautifully by the tangy sweet mostarda condiment. The barley was cooked perfectly, and had a deep nuttiness that was lovely with the mildly sulfurous flavour of the turnip and kohlrabi. What was truly impressive, however, was the huckleberry leather, which lent a satisfying chew that melted delicately on the tongue. Stunning composition.  Georgian Bay Whitefish- Sea Urchin, Black Truffle, Pickle Juniper Berry, Rapini- Another really solid dish. The whitefish was perfectly cooked, with a moist flesh and a wickedly crispy crust. The sea urchin sauce was rich, but refreshing, and the black truffle lent a delicate level of umami aromatics. While I loved the idea of a pickled juniper berry, biting into it really overwhelmed my palate so that it was all I could taste.  This would probably work much better for a heartier red meat dish than a dainty whitefish.  Date & Carob Cake, Scotch, CO2 Apple, Quince, Clove- A very interesting dessert, with both sweet and savoury elements. The cakes were dense and hearty, and took on a smoky flavour from the scotch.  The apple and quince had been compressed to a texture similar to a thick fruit leather, but without the sticky sweetness.  I really liked the concept, and all of the elements, I just wish there was a bit more sweetness and something creamy to balance everything out.  Fresh Mozzarella Curd, Lemon Pudding, Lemon Confit, Gaspe Honey- Another beautiful presentation, and a delicious light end to a good meal. The curd had a satisfying chew, similar to cottage cheese curds, but with more fat.  This was a perfect carrier for the tangy sweet lemon pudding and confit....."}
{"text":"I went to Ursa expecting a promising meal and was disappointed at the outset. Having been to Acadia I have become to appreciate good quality to price ratio. The price was not my turn off, having spent hundreds on meals before I was not turned away from the pricing. I was turned away from the fact that they charge for bread. What is with this new concept going on in Toronto? Every good restaurant makes fresh bread and there is labor involved. However, some feel that they are better than other and are able to charge for it, yet it makes no sense because this has been a staple of going out since I can remember.   So at the outset, I was turned off because they charged for bread. I ordered a number of items on the menu and was there with a friend. We ordered a whitefish, I can't remember exactly which one but it was an incredibly small portion. The dish was put together elegantly but the flavors were basic when all of them were put together. I even let this go but what I could not let go was the price for the portion. I got 3 or 4 pieces of sashimi grade fish. I had gone to Acadia and ironically had the exact same fish a week earlier and received two times the portion for less money. The rest of the dishes were similar, the prices and the quality were not on par. It just did not work. If they dropped 5 ot 6 dollars off every item I can see it working. Oh and not charging for bread.   I did enjoy this salad with a 70 degree poached egg. The price and the quality were right on par. In fact I think it was the cheapest item on the menu yet one of the best tasting.   All in all I felt that if the prices were better I would rate them at 3.5. But at the price they are charging and the quality of food, it just does not work. I don't get it at all.   I think Ursa really needs to look at how they are pricing things and not charge for bread."}
{"text":"Based on the service, we gave it a two. If the service was better, it would have been an easy four!   Came here with my partner, and expected good food, which we did get; however, the service, well, we sat at the bar, and it was disappointing. The bartenders were slow, not sure if they had better things to do than, say, serve their customers? We had to wave  him down to get a drink, to get a refill, and again, for another refill. We are paying about $14 per drink each, so that's about $28 per round, and we had three rounds, and we could have had more if it weren't for the horrible service. So i think you would want to be on top of this, or try to at least upsell? He sure had big enough glasses to see what was going on. Or perhaps they were for show? My partner had very little patience to wave him down again, so we go our bill, which we had to wave him down as well, and went to Carmen instead more drinks and prompt service. Queen west is getting a reputation as hipsterville with bad/ pretentious service. I hope not, because there are many other restaurants I would like to try on this strip. However, will we spend another $270 again? Probably not. Will we recommend this place to our friends and family? No. The food was great, the service was not. So based on this, our experience was not worth it. Quite disappointing as we really wanted this to be a regular joint."}
{"text":"We wandered in on a Tuesday evening without reservations, it was quite busy but we managed to grab a table.  The decor is simple/trendy and the food is fantastic.  We found the food to be inventive, natural, dynamic and great quality.  Its a place you walk away from feeling both healthy and clean while having a sumptuous experience!  Would definately recommend."}
{"text":"There is something to be said for a restaurant that makes every attempt to reclaim food. It can be great or it can suck.   URSA is a delight to your tastebuds. The menu is always changing so you may not eat what I had. I literally ordered every dish on the menu and loved it all. Give it a try, and impress someone special.   Thank you for a great memory and meal"}
{"text":"URSA.  I had been hearing that I need to try this place out.  So I did.  Aaaaand it was a definitely let down.  Drinks:  Shmancy ingredients, average taste.  My Mojito with \"foraged mint\" was decent, nothing more.  I tried the Whiskey Sour, also with fancy ingredients came up short.  But still, the food menu looked so enticing with innovative ingredients like \"nutriceutical berry and probiotic creme fraiche\"  I was still excited.  Raw Bread:  I pictured actual bread when I ordered it, but no, it's a few tiny thin tasteless crackers with a smidgeon of butter.    Starter:  Salad, boring. And for 20$ I was expecting a delicious dance in my mouth.   Main: Duck. There were two different parts of duck on my plate, one part was tough, and chewy but had a nice flavour (at least) and the other part was tiny but moist and delicious.  Dessert:  This was the best dish.  It was tiny, but decadent.  Chocolate and caramel textures.    Will I recommend URSA to friends? NO.  Will i go back?  NO.  Do I feel I got my money's worth?  NOPE.  Overall:  Tiny portions, average taste."}
{"text":"Making conversation with a fellow solo bar patron in Parkdale while watching the NBA finals, I heard that he worked at Ursa (not to be confused with Ursula of the Little Mermaid).  He mentioned that the food is extremely tasty and uses modern cooking methods to maintain the nutrients...two plusses in my books.  I snagged a 9 pm reso on Saturday night in July.  This is my new favourite restaurant in Toronto, hands down.   The space can be construed as modernist hipster - exposed brick, nice wood bar, hanging \"hipster\" string lights...but the service attitude was extremely friendly and unpretentious, and the crowd was mixed. Surprisingly not full for all the hype it has received.  Apps run 15-20 Mains run 25-30 Desserts run 12-15 House drinks run 12-14  Had the Dirty Dandy drink (delicious - home made ginger brandy...whaaaaat? delicious), raw fish appetizer, burrata appetizer (shared apps with my date). My date had the sea bream, and I had the bison. We (well, mostly I) had the lemon yuzu for dessert.  Highlights: the bison was braised, served with \"rye berry puree\" (what?) and was wet your pants exceptional. The yuzu dessert was like a deconstructed lemon meringue pie, with a twist...served with two cookies made with duck fat, straight from the oven, to make a \"sandwich\" of everything on the plate. Gorgeous. My date loved his fish. Apps were very solid too.  It's a bit of a splurge, but not of rip off proportions - and if every restaurant was this good, my faith in the future of food would be permanently restored. Go."}
{"text":"I can't say enough nice things about Ursa...   - The food is fabulous and fairly priced.    - The bartenders are true pros (without being 'mixologists', if you know what I'm saying).  The can make you something funky with a raw egg in it or draw a simple pint.  - The service is very friendly and accommodating.  Servers are always polite and have a second to chat.  (A rarity on WQW!)  - There are all kinds of people in here - young, old, hip, not hip at all... That's what happens when you serve great food and don't just rely on the cache of decor and location.  - Decor is neat - all the little light bulbs make me think of Tesla.  I hope this place is here forever."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. On one hand, the environment, staff, service is pretty good. However I find most of the dishes overpriced. I was expecting to have 5 star food but the taste wasn't that great. They have interesting and creative dishes but the taste is not that great. If you are a scotch drinker they do offer very unique and interesting shots."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant on a recommendation and was very disappointed.  Ordered the burratta cheese, which I absolutely love at Campagnolo, but here the meagre portion left me sad and wanting more.  The only thing 'saving' the dish was pairing the cheese with a lovely fresh peach.  My main - a rabbit roulade - was a dense, small portion of minced rabbit that was completely flavour-free.  The accompanying sweet breads were over cooked and again lacking in flavour.  These were a far cry from the moist and tasty morsels of sweet breads offered at the wonderful Le Paradis .  It's apparent that the chef takes great pride it presenting a pretty plate.  However,  if he actually tried making honest, delicious food for adult appetites, he would have happier customers.   For a $26 main, I certainly wasn't expecting to go out for another meal.  Too many better options out there - so following our lack luster meal at Ursa, we had a satisfying nosh of Cava and frites with mayo at nearby Union."}
{"text":"Ugh. What utter garbage. For all its bells and whistles, Ursa is another over-priced, over-hyped Queen West Resto, where the pretentious trust fund babies go to blow money on bland, mildly interesting food.  First off, let me start by saying, I was ready to spend money. I WANTED to spend money and I wanted to be impressed. We first were seated at the bar; but as soon as we took our seats the bar-tender (who was really the only pleasant part of the entire night, as he kind of resembled a poor-man's Daniel Craig) told us we would have to leave at 10:30 since the DJs would need those seats.  we took  the chance.  I ordered Mulled Wine, which was luke warm and bland. totally not what i expected. my companian ordered a virgin drink that she described as tasting like ice-cold lemonade.   once we were ready to order, the bar tender told us he wasnt going to take dinner orders from us until and unless he found somewhere to move us. we sat there hungry for 30 minutes, until a table opened up.   once seated, again, we ordered the raw bread and butter and the tofu dish.   well the raw bread and butter was 4 pieces of crumbly and thin crackers and about half a teaspoon of two different kinds of butter...WTF? for an entire $5.00 that was unaccaptable. considering the city's top restaurants like One, Bymark, Le Select, La Societe, provide bread for FREE. its something you have wine with while you wait for the apps and the mains to come...  we were dissapointed but held out hope for Tofu... but we were dissapointed.   for a $14.00 dish there were three small cubes of deep fried tofu, on top of a bland non-tasting foam... again, Im a vegetarian and sadly eat a lot of tofu though its not good for me... I've gotten pacakged Tofu from Wholefoods for 5 bucks that tasted better than what i was given at Ursa AND it feeds me for TWO DAYS.  we left. dissapointed, hungry and $50.00 short.   at least i didnt feel obligated to tip much since the service on top of the food was HORRIBLE....  TERRIBLE experience, save your money and pretension for a place that deserves it."}
{"text":"Great cocktails, great food.    The first time i went in they spent too much time explaining the food, but theyve calmed down and the food speaks for itself now.  it can be pricey, but it's definitely a fun adventure in flavour.   One small thing, i hate the lights over the kitchen and the way they bleed fluorescent light into  the dining room.  i suspect it's why the bar at the front is such a popular place to eat!"}
{"text":"I have not been to a restaurant with which I've been so satisfied since I started my yelp quest. I would not have heard about Ursa if it weren't for my culinary friend - it really is a well kept secret. We made a reservation but if you are going with just two people, you could easily grab a couple of seats at the bar without much of a wait.  Got greeted by Clayton at the bar when we walked in... this man has the charm of a top-notch bartender. Heard amazing things about his mixology from my friend so we started off with some drinks. We ordered the tofu to start and white fish for me, and the pork loin and belly for my date.  The tofu plate was refreshing. I can imagine it may be a little bland for people who are not used to eating raw tofu, but having grown up with a Japanese-style diet, I really appreciated the textures of the different tofu selection. My white fish.... (insert shudder of sheer joy here) was perfect, in every way - portion, flavour, ingredients - there was no bullshit in this dish. Every component was selected because it enhanced the overall dish. No excess of anything to subtract from the most carefully crafted entree my palate has ever enjoyed.  The pork was on the sweet side, which was also perfect to my date's liking (too sweet for me). Pats on our backs for each choosing a dish that made us so happy.  We kept joking around that we felt so chic, so cool to be sititng at Ursa. I have to admit I did feel a little sad when I walked out the door to return to my average plain Jane lifestyle. In a perfect world where my wallet requires no budgeting on upscale meals, I would make Ursa my go-to restaurant ;)  Atmosphere - 5/5 Service - 5/5 Food - 5/5 Price - 2/5 (expeez but worth the splurge!)"}
{"text":"Just ate there  tonight- the worst food I've ever eaten. It was quite shockingly bad! Tofu was terrible, fish was terrible....what can I say- do not eat here!"}
{"text":"3.5 out of 5. Great feel to the restaurant, and good service. The food is healthy, fresh, and creative. Most dishes lack flavor as they steer clear of rich flavors. It's expensive, but a destination for the health conscience enthusiasts."}
{"text":"Went here with great excitement tonight, but unfortunately, it disappointed.   My wife described the meal as \"precious\" and I can't disagree.    Bread order (for $6 - a pet peeve) was chewy and tasteless - damp cardboard with over-salted \"cultured\" butter.  Amuse bouche was indescribably bland and smooth with a strange mealy-ness.  Not quite sure what it was, but it did not leave us optimistic for the meal.  First course, I had the scallops - fine, but again, under-seasoned and bland - an ordinary appetizer in all but appearance.  My wife's veggie tartare, left her talking about a Sex and the City episode where the protagonists eat \"lawn\" at a raw food restaurant and stop for pizza on the way home.  Mains were stronger.  My lamb was good, but not great - a terrible cut of lamb, chewy and fatty, but well seasoned and cooked.  Seemed like they optimized for the shape of the cut (nice triangle!) rather than for the meat itself.  Wife was very happy with her chicken.  Dessert - we got the chocolate and that was a strong finish.  Good textures and flavours.  Service was mediocre - had trouble getting attention from the waiter on several occasions, but when he attended to us, he was knowledgeable and helpful.    In short, ultimately acceptable, but only just.  We won't return and can't recommend it.  Too many other good restaurants to try or return to.    That said, it was entertaining to see a full-on run at \"peak hipster\", with all the hipster clones looking basically alike in plaid and beards."}
{"text":"GOOD: service, drinks (hot wine), ambience, dessert  GREAT: elk tartare (AMAZING), wild boar (so tender and juicy)  SO SO: beet salad   Great dinner overall. A place that is worth coming back. But there was nothing mind blowing."}
{"text":"This restaurant left me with a bitter taste in my mouth - not from the food; but rather from the inattentive and rather arrogant staff.  Don't plan on dropping in without a reservation as you will be treated as a second-class citizen or perhaps worse...a leper.  At 6:30 with at least half of the tables open, I was informed that we could only sit at the bar and that if we did so we would need to \"be gone by 8P\".  No one was sitting in the bar and we attempted to sit off to the side to avoid sitting along the main portion of the bar which was very cramped near a stairwell and the hostess station.  We were informed we could not sit at the end of the bar as some of the seats were reserved.   We ended up sitting at the other end of the bar and were told we needed to move down one seat because they were keeping that seat for \"singles\".  The two bartenders were disengaged and really were more concerned with prepping for the evening.  I travel frequently and usually find that the bar staff is much more friendly and wanting to engage their patrons.  Not this place.  They seemed \"put out\" that we would be ordering dinner.  I also got the impression that the bartender was rather irked by the fact that I decided not to drink alcohol.  DUH - have you heard about DUI's.  Downtown Toronto is crawling with police this weekend due to Grey Cup.  The menu is rather limited and seems to really be more tailored towards those diners looking for she-she, foo-foo menu items.  With that being said I would rate both of our entrees about a 6 or 7 on a scale of 1-10.  This is a relatively new restaurant (open less than a year); and from someone that has been in the restaurant/hotel industry for 30 years, this establishment could benefit a lot by embracing their patrons and making them feel truly welcome.  We were not left with that feeling.  Most restaurants that fail do so as a result of poor service and a staff that doesn't truly engage their patrons and create great experiences.  This is how you build a following...in additon to a fine menu."}
{"text":"Elk tartare was a shared appetizer, which while eating, I awkwardly thought, I would have preferred less. One dimensional,  unexciting and the crisp and charqui to accompany the tartare didn't complement it.  Wild boar was very tender and oozing with deliciousness, which soaked into the well toasted barley. The tiny dabs of quince mostarda really accentuated the flavor. Turnip and kohlrabi were the perfect sides that I couldn't get enough of.  Atmosphere was cool, but cold. Kitchen was particularly slow for the amount of staff. With all the great places in TO, I wouldn't make a point to come back here."}
{"text":"I was somewhat disappointed with URSA. First of all, the menu descriptions have very little correlation with the actual dishes. I don't think it is helpful to call a dish by a minor ingredient or to use the word \"salad\" when the dish comes on a board and is separated into distinct groupings of vegetables. Bottom line, when I'm paying $20 for an appetizer, I want to know what I'm getting. Secondly, there are some pretty advanced and complicated ingredient lists for each dish and of the 5 dishes we tried, I don't think any of them gelled 100%. The best was an 80% and the worst a 60%. If you're going to try to put 8 ingredients together, you better be more confident in how they actually work. I think there was a certain arrogance that diners wouldn't know any better and would be impressed by the rarity or audacity of the ingredients.   On the plus side, all the food was fresh and healthy, generally well cooked and presented. I just didn't feel fulfilled at the end of the meal, nor did I feel that it was good value."}
{"text":"At the midpoint of my own personal weeklong tour of Toronto's \"Top New Restaurants\"  Step One- Making a reservation. They don't answer the phone all that well and when we left a message, we never got a call back. So, we finally made a reservation for a Sunday night. It appears they have more than just the designated two seatings, as people kept coming in all night.  Arrival- the space formerly occupied by Bar One (best brunch ever!) has been transformed into a more industrial space. I felt it was a bit too raw- grey, cinder block walls and bare lightbulbs dangling from cords tied all over the ceiling.  The tables were nice, but my seat had a hard spring that made it odd to sit on (with a short skirt).  Bar/Drinks- Good wine list. Cocktails are decent, but we all had the feeling that something was missing. I was missing the candied ginger in the Ginger indie, and the Green Tea Gin needed a bit more acid.  Food- Interesting presentation of the salad, which others have raved about. The menu will change, but the root vegetables were raw? The pickled ginger (homemade) was awesome. The fish had that blood line that makes this pescatarian a little quesy.  The mains were quite good. Interesting accessories- a crispy kale leaf, puree of sunchokes, quinoa- yum!  Service- the waitstaff are total hipsters, tight jeans and plaid shirts abound. These are not professional waiters that I have seen at other places this week. We had a huge mishap at our table when two waitstaff ran into each othere.  Our main waiter just didn't know how to respond, and kind of ran away.  But one of the other guys came through with a Tide stick and comped our original bottle of wine and the replacement (too bad we ordered a bottle of RED wine).   Is this enough to make up for making our dinner high anxiety/stressful? I think I have justified my rating, and barring everyone else getting splashed with food and wine, I think 3 stars is fair."}
{"text":"I'm getting really tired of these hyped up hipster joints on Queen West serving tiny portions and overpriced food. Eating out in Toronto is becoming an exercise of dropping 2 bills, and being instantly forgettable the minute you leave except the feeling of being ripped off afterwards. I will say Ursa's presentation of dishes is beautiful but the lamb was 2 bites and the rest of the plate was a bunch of meh root veggies which probably cost 20 cents to source. The whitefish  was overcooked though the sides (more root veggies) were better in this dish. The single potato fingerling (4 cm long) was tasty. The worst was this weird chocolate hazelnut concoction sitting in a watery liquid emulsion. Lucky the spoons were the tiniest I've ever seen because it was done in 2 scoops.  Oh BTW bread costs extra. This place is too precious for its own good and it floors me how the rating averages 4 stars. You will have to another meal right after spending $180 for 2 here because you'll be starving otherwise."}
{"text":"Ursa is one of the best meals I've had in Toronto to date.   They've done a great job modernizing the space since Bar One left. There's a large open kitchen where you can see the development of your dishes.   My DC and I started off with the buratta appetizer. The cheese itself was great, however, the real stand outs were the almond crackers and pistachio purée. The combination of the buratta with the pistachio purée was both salty sweet. It was also beautifully presented.   For mains, I had the rabbit while my DC had the goat. Both dishes were exceptional. The rabbit came with a bean purée and carrot salad. A carrot salad sounds bland, but coupled with the mouse, these fresh and different types of carrots shone through. The rabbit was cooked to perfection. I tried my DC's goat. Again, the meat was cooked to perfection, and the goat didn't have the usual goatee flavour to it -- I guess that might a negative to some, but not for my DC. The goat was spicy, but incredibly tender. The accompanying salad was a corn salad. Again, the salad was fantastic and beautiful to look at.   For dessert, we shared the yuzu dish and the chocolate pie with sorbet. The yuzu dish was good, but the pastry that came with the dish was a bit bland. However, the yuzu puree topped with mint was fantastic. The fresh mint leaves contrasted the citrus very well.   The service was thoughtful but not pretentious. A short explanation came with each dish that described the different elements on the plate.   I definitely plan on returning."}
{"text":"i had been into URSA once before and loved their seasonal smash and the tofu appetizer i tried, so i went back with high hopes. the dinner i had was a straight loss, two totally unappealing, almost inedible dishes- a somewhat terrifying oysters and watermelon starter, and a whitefish main which was bland and unappealing (the spinach dumpling tasted like stodgy nothingness, the fish itself was tasteless). these are huge misses when you are paying 20-30 per dish. that said, my date's starter salad was incredible, garlicky and fresh. My sense is that the menu is a massive hit or miss affair, when they get it right its perfection, but the wrong is close to inedible."}
{"text":"I feel a little torn about Ursa.  On one hand, I absolutely loved the back patio, the Negronis and the personnel. Everyone was so friendly!  Also, They are taking risks with interesting dishes.. IE Meal worms and grasshopper garnishes which I always applaud a few risks.   But While presentation was incredible,  I feel like something is still amiss with the food. I feel like for all of the creativity, the food didn't wow me and for the price, I expected a huge WOW factor.   Our bill came to $300 with tip for two people with 3 courses and some wine (A $55 bottle) and 2 x negronis.. a bit too rich for my blood. I think I'd rather go next door and have a brilliant meal for 1/2 the price."}
{"text":"Granted, it's been about 3 months since I went to Ursa to celebrate a friend's birthday, but I have a definite opinion on my experience there.   First off, the food, for the most part, was excellent. Definitely chock full of tastebud sensations, and it seems like that's what the chefs are going for with their creations. My main, which was a seared white fish, was delicious. The raw bread platter (with two types of flavoured butter) was distinctly underwhelming. The 'breads' were more like soft crackers - flatbreads, I guess - and the flavours of the breads, while interesting, made my stomach a bit upset. Pretty unappetizing for an appetizer. Also, $5 is pretty steep for what you get. I liked the mulled wine, but I also prefer my mulled wine to be a bit less 'robust' with the mulling spices, so it was great.   Our server was also really good. Very attentive and friendly. I think he was a little miffed that we only ordered two 'bread' platters as an appetizer to share for the table, because from the way the menu is laid out, it's like you're supposed to order both an appetizer and a main (the main is pretty small, so in order to get enough food to eat you're supposed to get the appetizer too). Too bad, because I had NO IDEA that Ursa was such a trendy place and would command such high prices for their food. I didn't do my research and find out ahead of time how much their food cost, and boy was I surprised when I saw the menu! I couldn't afford to get the appetizer! It was the price I usually pay for a main! Holy. Way more than I was expecting to pay, but then again, I'm not used to going to such fancy, trendy places. My friends seemed to really like it, but I didn't like it enough to go back for a return visit. The gastronomie and high art of the food preparation was not enough to offset the sour taste that the high prices left in my mouth.  If you're looking for a taste adventure in an artfully decorated space with a trendy (upscale hipster) but laid-back atmosphere and money is not a concern for you, you will probably enjoy your visit. But make sure to make a reservation, because it's a small dining room and remember how I said this place is trendy? Yeah."}
{"text":"I've been twice.  The first time was 5 star worthy, the second time 3 star worthy -- so they end up with four.  Great food.  The first time, the bartender made me a mojito and it was AMAZING.  The second time, they had no mint (just chocolate mint?) in stock, so I ordered a drink off their cocktail list and it wasn't very good.  Boozy, but not a pleasant taste.    The buffalo carpaccio was the best, and the lamb dish was outstanding.  The first time I went, the service was impeccable - friendly, informative, very good.  The second time, the waitress was surly, inattentive and (although my date was being a super prick to her) very condescending to my guest.  We ordered the shrimp appetizer and she told us that the head of shrimp comes on the plate and, although dead, might still be moving.  I have no problems with this but my date was grossed out and said, \"Oh, we don't want it then,\" and she proceeded to mock him and roll her eyes and basically make him look like an idiot.  Not cool.  Even though he is an idiot."}
{"text":"This is the longest amount of time that I've ever waited for the least amount of food ever! Our three course 'summary' meal took three hours to complete. That's the amount of time over which I expect a 10- course Chinese wedding banquet. On top of that, it took a long time for us to initially get water or to get our waiter's attention to put our order in.   The food, when it did arrive, were visual works of art. They were beautifully presented, the kitchen using the white plates as white canvases for their gorgeous food paintings. The flip side is, of course, that the generous white space of the large plates and bowls made the food look even more miniscule. Depending on what you end up ordering, what you end up could be more or less substantial than you would have imagined.  I had the yellowtail sashimi app. It was deliciously tender. For the main, I had the trout which was perfectly pan fried to a beautiful crisp on the one side and wonderfully tender on the other. The dessert was a strange assortment of a purple yam yogurt and crunchy stuff. It looked pretty but the combination of savory and sweet really didn't work so well for me. I also got to try my friend's soft shell crab. So juicy!"}
{"text":"There is a lot to like about this place. The atmosphere is lovely, the waiters are friendly, the chefs are truly passionate about their work. Plating in particular is astounding. But I really didn't feel very attracted to anything on the menu. Usually I find difficult to choose between too many appealing selections, but here nothing struck my fancy. I tried two appetizers and two mains, and none of them rocked my world. They were more interesting than good.  One notable exception to this trend was a lemon dessert that completely knocked it out of the park. It was an amazing combination of flavours and textures that were just the right contrast and wonderfully complementary."}
{"text":"Just came here to enjoy some drinks at the bar. The bartender was friendly and the drinks were delicious. Cocktails ranged from $11-18 or so. It was a very comfortable atmosphere for a casual, yet upscale drink break."}
{"text":"I was visiting from NYC and my colleague took me here.  I arrived early and had a Manhattan while I waited - it may have been the best I've ever had.  House made vermouth and they didn't use Angostura bitters - really smooth and delicious.  The food was fantastic.  Here in NYC there is a place I really enjoy, run by a Canadian chef and he once contemplated putting horse on the menu and there was this huge uproar...so Ursa had a horse tartare dish as an app and I got it.  It tasted great - very fresh and flavorful.  As my main I ordered the Ontario red tailed deer - I've had venison many times before and I was debating between this and the sturgeon but I'm glad I had this.  The meat was cooked perfectly, the presentation was great (the tartare presentation was very nice too) and the accompanying grains and sauce was delicious.  I tried bites of what my friends had and they were all really good - a goat meat dish wrapped in pasta was really nice.  Goat is a meat I really want to like and never have good luck with it - my mother-in-law always makes it tough and fatty - this was tender and full of flavor.  The service was also very good - the bartender was a nice guy and our server explained all of the dishes really nicely and was attentive.  I'd like to go back here when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"I could not have asked for a better place to celebrate my birthday!  URSA is 1 of... 600 bookmarks of mine on Yelp and now I can cross it off the list.  They have a healthy list of cocktails, spirits and beers.  My girlfriend Andrea (love you!) just kept piling on those cocktails.  I don't think there was one I didn't like!  For my appetizer I opted for the Cornucopia that was their Burrata Salad.  I call it a Cornucopia because of the colourful plate that was placed before me.  It contained orange hues (grilled apricots, squash blossoms), greens (garlic scape + foraged leaves), red (currants), white (currants).  While it was visually appealing, it was also tummy-satisfying!  Who wants a boring old Caesar?    For my main I opted for the lamb and also tasted some of the bison.  (If you're my friend, a prerequisite is that you have to share your food, haha).  Both were extremely tender and cooked to a perfect pink.  The lamb came with a side of charred eggplant, bulgur, spring pea, yoghurt and harrissa.  The bison was accompanied with a rye berry puree which resembled texturally, gruel, asaparagus, Bearnaise and water plants in an \"Old Fashioned\" jus.   But my most favourite part of the meal had to have been dessert.  I felt like I was in the middle of a science experiment while feasting on the Milk + Ricotta (meant for 2 people).  There were tiny vials of milk that were lukewarm (the server states this should be consumed within a 15 minute time frame before the whey separates and it's not as palatable), grilled apricots, diced pear, and housemade ricotta with raw honey.  Creative presentation, and definitely an adventure for my friends!  But the dessert that knocked my socks off was the Yuzu Lemon Curd (which in essence was a deconstructed lemon meringue pie) - BUT - the \"crust\" was a duck fat sable.  DUCK FAT!  I KNEW I picked this restaurant for a good reason.  The sable was absolutely delicious and the lemon curd was as fresh as linen!  The meringue was so divine I wanted to lick the plate.  All in all, for our party of 5, the bill came to just shy of $300, but it was worth EVERY penny!    From the service (thank you for the complimentary birthday dessert) to the food - there wasn't one thing I didn't like.  Now I'm kind of wishing every weekend were my birthday!  Definitely go if you haven't been!"}
{"text":"great service, great food and amazing presentation! We went back 2 weeks after the first time because we loved it so much.   The only complaint is that they can't do any substitutions. (I asked for them to not give me one item listed and they couldn't do it)"}
{"text":"3 stars is generous. 10 item total menu with a stiff presentation. The drinks were the highlight.  Atmosphere and design of the space is great. Food was pretentious and under seasoned. Pricing was not aligned with the value. $200 per couple with wine."}
{"text":"Went to Ursa last night. Started with the Elk Tartare. Not bad - could have used some type of toast instead of the slightly strange, way too thin 'flat bread' it was served with.   I had trout as my main. Good sized, flavourful piece of fish, with not-memorable sides.   Overall, not bad, but not worth the hype."}
{"text":"I had a shockingly good meal here, in a lovely room with excellent service. All three courses were a home run, but I actually teared up a little when I finished my main course and then contemplated the strong possibility that I would never get to eat it again: a \"walnut foie\" that was so velvety and delicious and so perfectly complemented by amazing quinoa and charred escarole that I really fear the rest of my culinary existence may be a let-down.   Also delicious: the raw salmon with yummy leaves, the root vegetable tartare (who knew vegetables could do that?) and a dessert called \"textures of chocolate and caramel\". It was all awesome, and not \"awesome for vegetarian food\" -- I happened to order veggie dishes but there's lots of meat and fish on the menu. The foie wasn't just a consolation prize for giving up foie gras (something I did a few years ago, in one of my few food vs ethics concessions) -- it was more mind-blowing than any goose foie I've eaten.  If I lived  in Toronto, it would be hard for me to choose any other restaurant for future celebrations or special meals. But I don't live in Toronto anymore, so I guess I'll just have to give up eating altogether.  P.S. I did deduct one star from my rating for the menu's egregious misspellings of  both \"pomegranate\" and \"meringue\". But I mentally gave it a six-star review, so it still works out to five."}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place. Went there on a Saturday night to catch up with an old friend. We didn't have reservations and got a table right away. It wasn't too loud so it was perfect for a chat.. perfect lighting, good for a date or just casually with friends.   We ordered the winter root salad which was totally yumms. It was a mixture of root veggies, some i had never heard of. Some pickled, some dehydrated.. ugh.. loved it.   Also had the tartare with foie gras.. it was succulent. One of the best foie gras i've ever had.  My friend ordered the chicken and quinoa polenta.. i tried it and it seriously melted in your mouth.   As a main dish I had porc loin but only ordered it because it came with porc belly, which i die for. It was good, not as good as my friends' meal but good.   Definitely hitting this spot again on my next trip to Toronto. Maybe a larger group this time?"}
{"text":"What a nice surprise. I stopped in on a Saturday night b/c the street cars were way off schedule and I got tired of walking to my destination.  Christina the bartender (mixologist) was amazing, friendly, and so knowledgeable.  I had some amazing cocktails and the food looked amazing.  Loved the atmosphere.  Was lovely, will be back!"}
{"text":"Best meal of summer 2013. Best post-meal feeling of ever. Ursa I love you."}
{"text":"Posting a bit late, but I took down detailed notes for this one... I'm giving 3 stars, but ONLY because of the food.  Visited Ursa with my husband for our wedding anniversary a little while back.  A friend had visited Ursa for a birthday party earlier in the year and reported having a terrible experience with the service there. I had hoped most of the trouble they had was related to them being a large group but I too was disappointed with our experience.   First off I must say the food was excellent; it was the service that was the big let down.   Make sure you have a snack before you go. Because it took forever to get food there (my husband kept joking \"arrive hungry, leave tomorrow\"). I don't recall exactly how long it took the appetizers to come but the mains were well over an hour from when we ordered. I get spacing out the apps and mains, but the portions are smallish so it's not like one needs a huge amount of time between courses to digest.   We then made the mistake of ordering a dessert to share. After nearly 40 minutes (our espressos came quickly but were long gone by the time we would have received dessert) we asked whether they had started making (which for the desserts they offered that night was a matter of plating - I know because we had the table next to the dessert station) ours and if they hadn't, could they just cancel it and give us our bill.   They finally ended up quickly pulling together our dessert, which they gave us free of charge since we were waiting so long, along with a couple of glasses of dessert wine. But I kind of wonder what would have happened if we hadn't asked them to cancel the dessert. If they would have just thought it was okay to serve someone's dessert 45 minutes after they ordered it... The restaurant wasn't even close to being full and they had a huge staff on hand in the kitchen at one point, so I shudder to think what it might be like on a busy night. I'm hoping they just had an off day.  Also, we noticed that for some tables our server explained their food to them when it was presented (which could have been helpful because the way some of the stuff was \"deconstructed\" it wasn't immediately clear how one might best eat it) but for other tables (including ours) he just kind of dropped it on the table and walked away without saying a word.  The staff just seemed generally awkward and not on the ball: the smoke detector got set off and they didn't seem to know what to do, we watched one guy repeatedly spill something because the lid on his squeeze bottle wasn't attached and we saw the kitchen staff doing shots (while people were still waiting for food...).   As I said, the food was tasty so you won't be disappointed there. The menu was creative and there was 5-6 or so apps ($12-$18) to choose from and 4 mains (2 meat, one fish and one veg - $20-$28 I think). We had the lamb tartare (delish) and the burrata salad (also delish) for starters and the goat and rabbit (amazingly moist/tender) for our mains.  If they can sort out the issues with the service I would consider going back, but until then I'm in no hurry to return."}
{"text":"a few thoughts,,,,,  1. Come here to be seen, but know that the staff wants to be seen more than you. I have not encountered rudeness like I did here. 2. The cocktail program needs a bit of work.  For the usual $14, you can have a so-so cocktail. 3. The food can be creative and not too bad.  If you like wild game, this is possibly what they do best. 4. Prices are high, and for small portions, the place doesn't offer much value.  An overpriced good meal quickly becomes woefully average.    5. The decor is like any other hipsterish place in this area.  Cool pendant lights, an open kitchen in the back, and dark wall paint in a small space.  The atmosphere is fine.  Fortunately, URSA has a good address near lots of people who need a place to wear their little black dress."}
{"text":"I heard a lot of praise from my partner in crime regarding URSA who was really wowed by her last meal here.  So, this was an easy choice for a birthday treat.  The space is what you expect on this area of Queen Street - it's trendy with your standard-issue exposed brick wall, open kitchen and wood bar and drawing in the targeted audience of hip yuppies.  From all appearances, this is not a typical place I would frequent - judging by the crowd, it seemed more a place to be seen at rather than  people there just for the food.  However, the service is quite prompt and courteous from a waitstaff best summarized as 'relaxed hipster' and careful to detail each dish when served.  It's a short seasonal menu with appetitzers running from $15 - $25 and mains running from $20 - $30 and their tasty cocktails are around $12.  The menu simply lists the ingredients of each dish, but give no details on taste or preparation (I have no fuckin' idea why it's cool to do this now at hot restaurants).  But our waiter was quite helpful in navigating the menu.  I started with the foie gras on panettone with chilled banana popsicle pear and a Barolo Chinato sauce ($26).  The pear and cake bread added an interesting twist and sweet contrast to richness and aroma of the perfectly seared foie gras.  While inventive and balanced, I should have stay away from this dish, I shouldn't have stuck to my personal 'if foie gras is on the menu, you must order it' rule.  I'm a bit of a purist and think the less you do to foie gras, the less chance of fucking it up.  Not for me.  For my main, Georgian bay whitefish with sea urchin sauce, black truffle, chips, pickled juniper and rapini.  The fish was tender and flaky and the sea urchin sauce was amazingly aromatic with a nice crunch from the chips.  However, really felt the truffles were unnecessary addition to make the dish seem more 'haute' and worth the $28 price tag - it's like adding goldleaf -- fancy but useless.  The truffles were lost in sea urchin sauce and the bitterness of the rapini was overpowering.   My vegetarian tablemate ordered the single applicable appy and entree in the housemade tofu ($14) and seasonal vegetable plate ($21).  I had a taste of both and I must say, both her dishes were better than mine.  I noticed one of the reviewers mentioned URSA is better with veggies than protein -- I have to concur with that statement from my experience.  At first glance, prices are quite reasonable but the portions are very small (could tell the waiter was trying to steer me towards the heartier main, but I ignored the warning).  Despite the trendy, casual decor, hip waitstaff, it's terribly old-fashioned in that \"gourmet = small portions\" mentality.  I didn't even come hungry and felt shortchanged.  I don't mind small portions if it knocks my socks off and I really expected more from the hype and price.  My tablemate left hungry and felt that URSA wasn't as good as she remembered.  I almost feel bad that I'm giving them a pretty low score due to the portions and pricing.  I like the food but can't see myself rushing to come back here again.  Maybe I ordered the wrong things.  Perhaps the food was too 'sophisticated' and 'complex' for me and I'm a glutton for wanting more -- but I can't help but feel the hype behind this place is primarily fuelled by pretension.  I'm in the... URSA Minor... (eh? eh? see what I did there?) but, two stars from me."}
{"text":"We were here for a friend's birthday. I would've given 4 stars, but decided to round down.   And yes, they do make a ceremony of reciting everything to you about what's actually on your dish. I know that it demonstrates knowledge and then you get to appreciate what you're putting in your mouth, blah blah, but hey ... what do i know about fine dining?   It was also a little strange that there's actually not a lot of items on the menu ... i can't remember the exact amount? But it's a few items (5?) on the appys and then like, 4 for the mains. Around $16-17 for appys and $25-30 to mains. I can't really speak for the seasonal vegetable dish (but it looked like a few scattered veggies and had sauce smeared on top). But I ordered the venison tartare and foie gras, and it was actually really good. Obviously it's tiny, but from my meager memory of tartare and foie gras, it was yummy.   And then the bill came ... there were 7 of us and of course, the bill came in one ... long ... list. It's always awkward at the very end when you're trying to split it up between 7 people evenly, and then it turns out you're short $80. (great, who short changed it this time?) ANYWAYS, all awkwardness aside, it turns out they added 4 extra drinks \"by accident\". Really?  So I took off a star for shadiness. Gave an extra for the foie gras. Probably won't come back again."}
{"text":"Quite simply the best meal I've had in ages.  Everything from front to back was incredible and unique. The kale, pomegranate, hazelnut salad with pumpkin apple glass was beautifully presented and superbly balanced the bitter and sweet tastes. I had the northern whitefish with salsa verte, white bean puree and cauliflower topped with a compressed mustard leaf... Ursa is famous for compressing their greens instead of blanching them to preserve the nutritional value held therein.  And my party and I shared the milk & honey dessert: house made (right then, just for us) ricotta and bottled whey, pear relish, pomegranate and current compote with honey comb.  The service was prompt, friendly and knowledgeable.  Will be returning without a doubt!"}
{"text":"So I went back for a friend's birthday dinner.   I'm impressed by how they were able to keep up the quality and recreate the exact same experience I had last time, while serving a totally different menu. I feel the hallmark of a really great restaurant is when they can keep customers coming back and not become boring.   If Yelp would allow me to take half a star off, it would be for running out of the vegetarian main dish (made up for by the chefs who created something really amazing anyway for three vegetarians at the table), for serving our bottle of wine halfway into our meal (made up for by comping the bottle and not mentioning it) and for not including the honeycomb in our desert (don't think I didn't notice!). So that equates to perhaps a little less than half a star, so I'm rounding up...  I really recommend this restaurant for anyone who gets excited by new and interesting food. This place is just _excellent_!"}
{"text":"Ursa is a distinctive experience.  It's not like other restaurants where the point is to chose some attractive items from the menu, enjoy them, and socialize with your friends (though of course you could, in fact , do just that. but you might miss the point).  The Sharkey brothers, one front of house, the other in the kitchen, have something very cerebral going on:  it's a food project and they want you to join with them in pushing some boundaries.  For instance:  both times I have dined there the house made tofu starter has been pretty far out there, the first time macha tofu, the second time served with extraordinary sauces and condiments. The first time silky as could be, almost a dessert in texture; the second time nice and firm.  Or take the crickets -- that's right crickets, the insects.  They are dried and ground into flour, which went into the cavatelli in last night's pheasant consomme.  High protein.  Part of a project that might alleviate hunger and malnutrition in some parts of the world.  If you have the chance to talk to Lucas Sharkey about this, you will realize that the brothers are driven and are very focused in ways that will surprise you.    Another example:  both meals I've enjoyed at Ursa have ended with the (again house-made) probiotic burrata. Done differently each time, but done very very well.  Last night with smoked apple jam.  I hasten to add at this point that the other standout sweet last night was a spectacular combination of chocolates and dolce de leche.  Mains are a bit more traditional, but there are some interesting deconstructive themes that run through the ever-changing short menu.  A month ago, there was a pig five ways (or was it four?), small bits of different cuts with interesting sauces/condiments and arrangements. Lat night a very nice guinea fowl with the extremely moist white meat also in a boudin blanc, as well as perfectly poached Atlantic lobster (claw) with a kaffir lime broth, and another member of our party had lamb cooked sous vide (thirty hours!), yet with the top still beautifully crisped, the flesh almost like butter in its tenderness.  There are some misses, but this is food that demands your attention and your thought.  The wine list is spectacular and modestly priced (Lodi Balzon Pinot Noir, maybe the best California Pinot I've ever had for a tad over sixty bucks).  Bottom line for me:  these guys are doing something that no one else is attempting.  If you are serious about food, check them out.  They deserve your support."}
{"text":"I can't say that I didn't like it here.   The vibe of the place is surprisingly chill for Queen West.   I mean sure, they have the hipster audacity to overexplain to you the origins of all the ingredients of the stuff you're eating.  You learn about the field that the mushrooms are foraged from.  You learn about the random shit that they infuse into perfectly good alcohol to make it more perfect.   Cedar.  Organic something-or-other.  Titatinum.  Adamantium.     You learn the name and genetic lineage of the cow that's died for your sins.    Items are plated in an artistic yet edible manner.   It's relatively expensive for what it actually is, but worth it once.  Perhaps twice.   One of the better restaurants in this part of town."}
{"text":"Fun unique place built around dishes from locally sourced ingredients. I definitely enjoyed the food and drinks. The place was pretty Nicely laid out. Decent decor and lighting. There was a lot of hype about the place. I'd say it didn't quite live up but still no complaints. A tad pricey but seems like all unique trendy spots are these days. Maybe this place legitimately is given the ingredients. Worth a trip there. We went on a Tuesday so not too crowded."}
{"text":"I see food in a different light after having eaten at Ursa.   If you are a foodie, you would love this place.    I can tell you that the Chef put a lot of thought into designing each dish.  Every course came out like a piece of art.   Just beautiful.   So, Ursa teaches you how to look and appreciate each foods that you don't normally see in the supermarkets and bring them to life.    It really is \"food art,\" that is, the dishes they create were thoughtfully executed with precision as to what types of foods were to pair with which, so the melodies of flavours would play off of one another nicely.     A small tip from me: go in with an intellectual mind and not a hungry stomach.   Portions are tiny, but that is not the mere point here.   I think the Chef wants us to take a little moment and savour in small bites, close our eyes, taste the different textures and flavours marrying one another in your mouth - ooh, and they do it sooooo well.     Definitely, I would titled this experience, \"My Love Affair with Ursa.\"   Culinary delights at its finest.   So, in the end, why a four star and not a perfect five?   I can't say I am in love with ALL the dishes that they've created.  Maybe I am just not a daring cookie.   Some flavours, I find,  didn't really go too well with one another and I feel like it's just being used as a garnish, because well... it makes the dish looks more appealing, visually.  lolz.   I am still a Traditionalist at heart, when it comes to food and maybe that prevented it from me giving it a perfect five."}
{"text":"We had a very lovely night at URSA. We walked in a little bit before 9:50 and were able to get a table without an real hastle in about 10 minutes. We also could have sat at the bar. I'd say about 10:30 the mood of the bar changed from somewhat quiet to pretty loud. On the way out we noticed a dj, so I'm guessing this is when he started. Anyway, the restaurant was a little on the loud side, without stiffling conversation. The food was interesting, well presented and yummie. We started with a couple of cocktails. I had the Big Bear Old Fashioned which was kind of uninspired (mostly tasted like watered down bourbon), but my partner had a better choice.   For food we wanted to start with the winter salad but someone snagged the last one right before we did, so we got the mixed greeen salad. Presentation was spectacular, though eating it was definitely hard to do. For my main I had the pork loin with the pork belly which also had lentils and kale. The pork loin was really the only thing that was disappointing, it was on the dry side. For dessert we had the ricotta plate which was sort of interesting. It came with a small ricotta cheese topped with honey, dried grapes that were sort of between grapes and raisins, pomegranate that was still attached to the pith, two slices of bread, and a honeycomb. It was definitely different and a nice way to end the meal, though the pomegranate was hard to deal with.   We definitely had a good time and enjoyed our meal, though the portions are on the small size. Check came to about $130 after tip for two appetizers, an entree, and a cocktail each."}
{"text":"Excellent on all fronts -- decor, service, food and drinks. Interesting and tasty cocktails -- the kind where you can detect all kinds of nuances in the flavours. Same goes with the food -- I had the garden greens with the lamb and then shared a dessert, all had sophisticated taste and texture combinations and were perfectly cooked. It does not get much better than this..."}
{"text":"This place has great service but unfortunately the food misses the mark.  They are going for high end cuisine with a high end price, but the flavours really did not add up.  The ingredients were fresh and hyper local, often coming straight from their roof, which I thought was lovely.  However, something about the flavours in my dishes did not really seem like they went together very well.  It seemed more like \"lets mix really random stuff and call it high end\". Some of the food we ate: 1.  I had the silken tofu and the flavours on that were very odd, some bites were bland and other very salty. 2.  Black noodles with radish cake.  That was actually really good. 3.  Vegetarian carpaccio.  This was ok. 4.  Cornish hen.  This was pretty good, but also on the salty side. 5.  The lobster.  This was really good and my favourite of the evening. 6.  The chocolate caramel dessert.  Now this sounded amazing, but the cake was a bit dry.  The icecream was mostly melted by the time it go to me and the mousse was not sweet.   7.  Rhubarb dessert.  This was ok but very very tart.  Overall if we are paying over $200 for a meal I want more then 2 of the dishes we try to wow me.  However, I will say again I did appreciate the service and local ingredients."}
{"text":"It was a sweltering evening when we passed by Ursa's window front and were pleasantly surprised to see about half the dining room unseated. As we pulled the door open and tentatively stepped towards the host, she asked whether we had reservations. \"Really?\" I asked incredulously, but was then relieved that there was actually availability. She was just making sure.  The dim lighting, closely knit tables, jam packed open kitchen, and casually dressed servers all made for a very relaxed date setting. Off of the cocktails list, I enjoyed my tangy Long Weekend as my dinner date reminisced about much better mint juleps (all the while admiring the tiny metal cup it was housed in). We were glad we chose to share the salmon appetizer as despite how fantastic it was, the healthy portion size wouldn't have left us, (or me at least), with a lot of room for everything else to come. My fish main was perfectly cooked and went very well with a crisp glass of wine. My dinner date's rich and hearty bison steak was as he liked it. We couldn't find room for dessert, but really wished that we could have somehow made it work because the menu descriptions sounded delightful."}
{"text":"Ate at the bar, and had a fantastic meal. A benefit of eating at the bar is the bartender can answer questions about the food as your eating."}
{"text":"Headed here for dinner last night with my fiance for post-vday celebrations. I was very very excited to come based on the good reviews but i was really afraid of the portion sizes and the high prices accompanying them. Regardless, we arrived for our reservation (Lucas was very good with finding us an approriate time at a very last minute) and were seated promptly. The inside of the restarant is very small and dimly lit. Its got that cool hip queen street west vibe and the clientelle appeared mainly to be young couples. My dining partner requested a Szarac cocktail (14$?) and i ordered a glass of red. His drink was strong - too strong for me but he enjoyed it immensely. My wine was good - smooth.  ($12). For appetizers we ordered the bread (5.00) and the elk tartare. The bread was like nud fud. Its essentially dehydrated dough with variation of flavours. The house made butter was super delicious. Overall i wasnt blown away by this mela but for 5 bucks im not goign to complain. The butter itself was worth it. The Elk Tartare was DELICIOUS. I was sad to share it with my partner because it would have been the perfect size for 1 person..for two i felt like i needed more. The price tag with it was also around the 20 something mark. Very enjoyable but wish there was more. Based on recommendation from our waiter we ordered the boar and the seared whitefish. I took the first bite of my whitefish and immediately smiled. It was perfect. Then my fiance took a bite of his boar and looked at me... i took a bite of it... and it was sooo damn GOOD. Better than my whitefish. perfect perfect sweet and meaty flavours. We shared our plates = the whitefish definately had more to the plate than the boar which was too small a portion. But soo very good. Both dishes were around the 30.00 mark. We finished our mains and 1 ordered a side car cocktail...not on the menu but the bartender made it anyways. A little too sweet nd not strong enough for me but a very good attempt. We ordered dessert of Cannele which was a deconstructed pastry ...almost like a sponge cake with honey comb and apples. it was good but could have done with out it. I wish that they had that lemon merangue i heard so much about. Oh well. Oh and the dessert cme with the most amazing utensil -- a spoon shaped like a shovel with a sharp end to cut and a nice scoop to shovel the food in your mouth. I was so enthralled with this spoon that my loving fiance asked a waiter if they would let me keep it.... the waiter smiled told us where to buy it and said one second. When he returned he came back with a newly polished spoon for me to take home! I was so happy! That itself deserves an extra .5 for this restaurant (consider my review 4.5 / 5). Our bill came to just under 200 with tip and taxes. The food was unique, well presented, tasty but not enough portions considering the price tag. I will return though for another special occassion though and i wish this restaurant much success in its future!"}
{"text":"I was a bit put off by the polarizing reviews here. But I came to Ursa with an open mind.  I was impressed. The food here is a breath of fresh air from the scores of \"modern comfort food\", (pathetically inauthentic) gourmet Mexican joints and rustic Italian clones that litter Toronto. Plating, composition, and creativity are superb -- only Momofuku offers an experience this original in Toronto.  Portions are not small, unless you're used to eating family buckets at KFC. Sure, the \"bread\" may be a little steep at $6 for 6 thin pieces of flatbread, but my stinging nettle spaghetti appetizer was the size of most restaurants' pasta mains, and my lobster entree featured a meaty claw and tail along with a pork tamale and cornbread (or polenta -- but it was something firm and cornmealy).  Bottom line: Ursa is not nearly the best food I've ever had. But it's really good. And the honest effort and skills put in here are miles above most restaurants in Toronto, which has the most derivative and behind-the-curve food scene of any major city I've ever visited. After coming here, I'm sure half the negative reviews are from people who just don't \"get it.\"  Extra points for the surprisingly unpretentious service and excellent cocktail and wine lists."}
{"text":"There were pros and cons to Ursa, but overall it was an enjoyable experience and I would return for app and drinks only.    Pros: no line up, friendly hostess, GREAT drinks (we had 5-6 cocktails and they were all excellent), the ELK TARTAR was amazing as an app and would highly recommend it. Delicious! My friend got the partridge which he enjoyed (I believe it was the last night on the menu though). The dessert wasn't a hit for us- we got the lemon and mozzarella dish as well as limoncello. The limoncello was ok, but not as good as the ones I've had in Italy. Good soundtrack and atmosphere.   Cons: we were seated at the bar at 545 because they said they were fully booked for the dinner service despite almost all the tables being open, and the majority of them stayed open until we left (845ish). Im not sure what we going on there. maybe because we look young? our bill was pretty pricy so i dont know why we didn't get offered a table.   The food also took a really long time to come out. I get that all the components take time to be prepared but if the kitchen is going to be that slow the staff should come by and check on us every now and then. I don't think I should have had to flag someone down every time we wanted to order food. Our bartender topped our water frequently though and the waiters explained everything on the menu when they served the dishes. I think the plates were a bit over priced for what they are, the portions are on the smaller side but the plates are pretty complicated here."}
{"text":"Great from beginning to end. Upon arrival they were busy seating other patrons so the bartender ran over and got us seated. The waiter was over quickly to offer water and discuss cocktails.  The two we ordered were very creative and tasty. I would have ordered another but I was driving. Remind me to cab it next time.  Apps came and were both fantastic although I wasn't expecting the crickets and meal worms?! Crunchy!!  Mains were equally brilliant.  I had rainbow trout.  Gf had lamb. Desert topped it off.  All courses were not only fantastic flavours but artfully presented. Portions were perfect but we are quality over quantity people. If you like \"all you can eat\" buffets, this is not the place for you!  Knowledgable and concientious wait staff.  We picked the 55.00 three course option which turned out to be well worth the $. You can tell that a lot of time and effort is put into the menu which changes frequently. Quality of ingredients is as good as it gets. Bravo"}
{"text":"Our daughter suggested URSA as part of her graduation celebrations.  Now I have always been a little underwhelmed by sous vide cooking and turning perfectly good solid food into foam, but URSA made me a convert.  I believe!  This is not an occasion of simply feeding to fill up.  This is an opportunity to engage your taste buds in a whole new way with delicate plates that satisfy without feeling stuffed.  The servings are somewhat on the small side, but the variety of invredients is incredible and the presentation is outstanding.  I'm not going to try to describe every dish, but let me cover the starter - a beet salad with rabbit mousse.  If that conjures up for you some roasted beets on a bed of greens with a slab of rabbit pate on the side, then you'd be wrong.  This was seven little beets, multicoloured, each about the size of one's thumb.  Each beet is different, be it the preparation, the seasoning or the presentation.  The beets are arranged in a crescent on top of a light brown sauce which turns out to be the rabbit mousse.  While it may look like gravy, it tastes like rabbit.  The salad is a couple of leaves of frisee.  The tastes are exceptional.  The four of us had a starter, a main and then shared three desserts.  Everything was outstanding.  The pace is slow.  We were there for almost three hours.  But sipping an excellent Barbera d'Alba and engaging in delightful conversation between courses, we never felt that we were waiting too long.  Emiko, our waiter was great.  She knew every dish and every ingredient, no matter how obscure.  She was always there to fill our wine or water glasses yet never seemed to be hovering.  The kitchen is open and visible from every table.  I counted six chefs, about twice as many as I would have expected in a restaurant of that size.  It is obvious that every dish is labour intensive, both from the perspective of preparation and presentation.  The restaurant was packed the evening we were there.  Reservations are required.  The place is loud, but that is just from an active buzz of conversation from closely set tables.  A three course meal will run you just under $60 per person plus whatever you want to drink.  There is an excellent wine list and a well stocked bar.  A dining experience to remember."}
