{"text":"This place sucks dont come here. I ordered 3 tacos and it took them about 25 minutes. I finally got up and left. The place was not even busy. Please dont waste your time here."}
{"text":"Came here because of good reviews and was EXTREMELY dissatisfied.  I paid $12 for a carne asada combination plate and the meat resembles dog food.  I admit the salsa is ok but a burrito from a gas station would have been about as satisfying as this meal.  There are much better options in the area than this!"}
{"text":"From curb this plase looks like any other run down Mexican street food spot. Once you step inside it is anything but. The two ladies in the kitchen were friendly and efficient. The place smelled clean and of fresh cooked tortillas. I ordered three tacos and a jarritos orange soda the total came to six bucks (little spendy). One of the ladies brought out fresh cilantro, onions, limes, and radishes as well as thee kinds of salsa!!! The meat was savory and the tortillas fresh made. I will definatly be back!"}
{"text":"I have been here before and unfortunately this time as the last, the service was awfully slow. It took 45 minutes to get 6 tacos and a sope! I believe they need to get organized, one lady was taking orders and getting drinks in the back, and running back and forth. I would recommend getting extra help if needed or reorganizing the kitchen more effectively. The food is not bad. I did not like the asada but the Pastor Tacos where good! They actually use a \"trompo\" that is how pastor is made! Their birria is also pretty good and the tortillas are hand made, very good. But again, slow service! Both times. If I visit a third time I will update. I want this place stop succeed! I want a good Mexican food near my house! I want Jalisco style food!"}
{"text":"Oh my best tacos al pastor.  That's is the one place, I have to visit when I visit my parents in AZ. I have had pretty much everything in the menu, and everything is really good.  My favorite however is the tacos al pastor with homemade tortillas."}
{"text":"Drawn to this restaurant because of the proximity to my house and the outstanding reviews I read before making my choice on coming here. Upon walking in the \"cleanliness\" of the place wasn't nearly as close as described in the previous reviews. About 60% of the tables were left dirty and with plates on them and it was a slow day (Less than 4 people including myself and my girlfriend). I ordered the flautas and she ordered a vegetarian huarache. Food came out at a pretty reasonable time. The flautas were alright (definitely not worthy of paying 8$ for and deserving of a 5 star rating) and the huarache was average, up until she encountered a stone in her meal (typically found in beans when you didn't strain and clean them properly). She bit down really hard and hurt her tooth immensely. Upon that happening she handed it to me and I flagged down one of the staff, and who I believed to be the owner of the place.  I told him very calmly what had happened and he took the stone, didn't apologize and went right back to the kitchen. I was under the impression that he was remaking what she had ordered, but that was not the case he decided to ignore it. I finished my meal and tried talking to him about remaking it or giving her compensation for the meal where the stone was found. After hearing him tell me \"this was impossible it couldn't have happened\" and me reminding him that it did happen, and I gave him actual evidence. He very angrily opened the cash register gave us 2$ less than what we paid for and slammed the register shut. Will not be returning, was not satisfied and was very disgruntled when I left. Would advise anyone who was planning on coming out of their way to find something better, because these reviews do not reflect on my experience whatsoever."}
{"text":"This is the real deal...authentic Mexican food!! If you've been craving real street tacos, this is the place! Exceptional food, great service and awesome prices! Everything was fresh, from the tortillas to the meat to the guacamole and salsa!"}
{"text":"Consistently excellent.  Authentic tacos al pastor.  Ricisimooo!  The best is the tray they give you with the order; onions, limes, cilantro, cucumbers or radishes, and the salsas.  Omg, I could stay and eat tacos all evening."}
{"text":"The place is clean. Great food flavor, made to order. I wasn't fortunate enough to taste the homemade tortillas mentioned in other reviews. I will be back next time I'm in Mesa."}
{"text":"Charred juicy Al Pastor, hand made fresh tortillas, and heady salsa. This place was actually recommended to me by a different taco shop when I asked where I can find the best Al pastor. Look no further. This is it!"}
{"text":"I have been to so many authentic Mexican joints and this place is by far my favorite! I usually order the guajolote de asada or the huaraches de asada... YUMM!   My fianc√© and I took my sister here for the first time and she loved it!   This place is about 30 mins away, but soooo worth it!!!"}
{"text":"Best pastor tacos I have had in a long time. Great fresh tortillas and salsas!  If they only had beer!!!"}
{"text":"Pastor tacos are the bomb! They have home made tortillas!  One of the best Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"We had a nice experience here. Its a very clean atmosphere. Th is definitely authentic mexicana food. The salsa selection was delicious!  Friendly service ! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I got some fried Potatoe taco things and they where way over cooked . But to their credit they give you real queso fresco not shredded cheddar or anything like that. Also the tacos needed a little more seasoning."}
{"text":"Los Gallos is a real authentic handmade style Mexican food. This ain't no Taco Bell! My favorite spot for Mexican food !"}
{"text":"From the looks of the outside you might hesitate and turn around and leave but I'm telling you the food is amazing!  By far the best Mexican food in town!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here and really enjoyed the pastor tacos. Everything is cooked to order. The salsa they bring to the table is really good! Very authentic Mexican food.  The establishment seat around ten tables. I left feeling comfortable, but thought I could have eaten a bit more for the price I paid. I do want to try the pastor burrito the next time I visit. The pastor meat is on a rotisserie with pineapple and onion on top. Pretty cool to see how that meat is prepared!"}
{"text":"By far the best El Pastor taco I've ever had.  Also had the flautas. Delicious!  Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Came here before going to the A's game and since it got good reviews here, we ate there.  For being a Mexican restaurant, how can you butcher frejoles? Well, this place did just that along with the carne asada. It looked like Kibbles N Bits and didn't have a good flavor. The tray with condiments looked like it was in the fridge for a long time and slightly welted.   On to what I did like. The birria was very good and had good flavor. What else did I like?..... Um, the salsas weren't that bad either. Wasn't much to complement here.  So, this place will not get a second chance to redeem themselves. Oh well, right?"}
{"text":"Very good! Meat cook to perfection with tasty salsas. Tortas had the perfect bread reminded me of food in Los Angeles and that's hard to find around here. Will be back."}
{"text":"I loved it. The tacos are made with fresh tortillas. The Carne Asada was delicious, the Pastor awesome. I hope to try the menudo real soon."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been trying to find a place on the east side where they do pastor \"the right way\". The meat was so flavorful and juicy! These are the best pastor tacos I have had outside of Mexico. We were so impressed! Clean little mom and pop shop. We had great service too. We will definitely be back soon!!!"}
{"text":"Tried it based on the reviews- I wasn't a fan. Tacos are $1.75 with every little meat on them. I had a taco de asada, birria & pastor- only liked al pastor. One of the green salsas is alright, the red one was gross (I'm normally prefer red). Quesadilla over priced."}
