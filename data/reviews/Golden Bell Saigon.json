{"text":"Best vegetarian peanut satay soup I've EVER had. It's scary good, highly recommend it on a chilly day. Only thing bad is that it's 2 blocks away from home! Lol"}
{"text":"Good food, Good value Went here the first time a week ago and have already been back for more. Food is very tasty and very reasonable !!! would definitely recommend if your in the area - wont be disappointed!"}
{"text":"We've been going to the Golden Bell for years and have never had a bad experience, until last night. We ordered Pad Thai, satay beef pho, chicken soup and spring rolls for delivery. The Pad Thai was inedible and looked and tasted like it had been sitting on a counter all day. The chicken in the chicken soup was dry and weird. The Pho broth was thicker than usual and different in not a good way. The only thing that was good was the spring rolls. It was like we got a bunch of things that were wrong orders that sat for a long time until it could be sold to a delivery customer. Not impressed this time. We will be reluctant to try it again although we have had good food there in the past."}
{"text":"Number 54. That is all. I realize that it is not traditional pho, but I just love it and could eat it every day. I often get take out, always quick and painless. Going in to the restaurant is nice as well. Typical service, nothing special, but not terrible. Would I go back? Absolutely. Would I recommend it? Of course. It's a go to for pho for me."}
{"text":"Went to this restaurant last Friday and in general I'd give it a good review. We had a terrible time finding parking but I guess that's just 17th ave on a Friday for you. The pho was very good and that is the only reason I would return. Our server was less than friendly and pretty much absent the whole time. The place was very loud which is surprising since it wasn't all that busy. So the dining experience wasn't very pleasant. I'd go again around lunch or even on a weekday for supper. I'd say skip this place on a Friday or Saturday night. *been back there twice now and they have parking in the back. It was full, however we managed to find street parking right behind the building."}
{"text":"What can I say...Golden Bell, you never fail me. I have yet to come across a meal I dislike! I'm a pho lover and I've tried quite a few..they are all delicious. The portions are huge, too. And the spring rolls!!! Don't get me started. They're the best! Delivery is always fast as well. For that - you get 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"The service here was extremely friendly and catered to my needs any way they could. Food was brought quickly and delivered with the name of the dish. I ordered eh pad Thai because I like to see what modifications each restaurant makes. I wasn't overly please nor dissatisfied with the pad Thai here. It had delicious chicken and shrimp in it, but the sauce is what threw me off. It tasted nothing like it should have. Lack of spice and zest, and didn't have lime (i suppose because there was no spicing as to balance). Spring and garden rolls were average. My water glass was alway refilled which I highly value because I drink the ol' H20 like a fish. Would go back, but definitely order a different dish."}
{"text":"I have to have food from this place at least once a week. The place is always busy and the staff are attentive. The dishes are great value, large portion size and always tastes fresh. My go to dish is the part broiled chicken sate noodle soup. It's really tasty!"}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable prices, and consistently good service.  I live downtown and often am seeking a good vermicelli bowl, Vietnamese iced coffee, and some spring rolls. Golden Bell Saigon always delivers.  They serve a monster vermicelli bowl that includes chicken, beef, prawns, pork, and shredded pork. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good pho!  For me, GB was one of those places that happen to always be located along the journey to somewhere, but never was it an intended destination. I have on occasion quickly glanced inside the giant glass windows intrigued by my fellow colourful 17th Ave breadthen who frequent the establishment. However, one afternoon my desire for close-by pho brought me to GB.  I found it clean inside and the service good. The pho is great and has the thicker (but not the chaulk-like) broth accompanying it. Though I prefer cleaner broths, I though the soup was delicious ... better than the noodles.   Sate pho was $9.75 (or something like that)."}
{"text":"The vegetarian peanut soup is amazing! It was ready super quick and you get enough to feed two people. It was very tasty, definitely the perfect meal for fall."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch while in Calgary for work. This place really looks like a hole in the wall, but oh the food!! I had Pad Thai, I know I know, cliche but it was soo good. The prices were great and the portions are pretty big. The service was average but I'd come back here for the food any day."}
{"text":"Golden Bell is probably one of the most frequently visit restaurants for me during work days.  I love going there for lunch because I do love their pho so very much, especially on a cold day, just imagine you have a big bowl of hot pho right in front of you!  I love that feeling.  I have tried different soups on their menu, but for some reason I always go back to #46 (just a personal favorite) and an order of their spring rolls.  So yummy!  And it is awesome going there  for lunch because their service is fast and efficient.  2/30"}
{"text":"Decent place to get your Viet fix.  Pho...3.5 stars.  For pho, it's all about the broth.  This place is slightly above average.  The broth has the aroma but is a bit short of perfection.  The servings could use a bit more meat, too.  Having said that, this is one of the best places on 17th Ave for pho.    Vermicelli...4 stars.  If you like saut√©ed meat in your vermicelli then you've come to the right place.  They make it as good as any other place.  Signature Peanut Sate pho...1 star.  Simply one of the worst dishes I've ever had.  How it was chosen as their signature dish is beyond comprehension.  The broth is peanutty but bland; nothing like what you'd expect from a typical bowl of sate pho.  The bowl, itself, was difficult to look at....should've been a sign. :S  Banh cuon (steamed rice crepes)...5 stars.  Some of the best banh cuon you'll ever have in Calgary.  The crepes are filled with delicious seasoned ground pork and topped with all the right garnishes and sides...the only thing missing is the traditional fried shrimp and/or seafood cake, but no biggie. THIS should be their signature dish!"}
{"text":"After long day I stopped in for the famous peanut sate (with extra Grilled Pork ... obviously).  Just love it."}
{"text":"My friend Seano was at it again this week with another 17th avenue food recommendation. If you've read some of my previous reviews you'll know he loves running his mouth about his favourite \"eats\". He missed the mark with this one though I feel...he called the Sate Soup Beef \"immaculate\" so I was expecting it to be well delicious. In the end it was fairly average."}
{"text":"Looking for a great bowl of pho?  I was looking for another good Vietnamese place nearby and I was happy to find the Golden Bell. I had the rare beef pho and was amazed at how delicious it was. They serve huge portions and provide very friendly service. I will definitely be back for me.  Tasty Vietnamese food in a convenient place!"}
{"text":"My absolute favourite place in Calgary for pho! The veggie satay pho is amazing! Just enough spice and peanut flavour! Will always make the drive for Golden Bell!"}
{"text":"Had a \"just what I wanted\" family lunch at the Golden Bell (and an escape from the St. Patricks Day stuff on 17th) A nice tidy and quiet restaurant with pleasant and efficient staff and good food (all of taste, presentation and volume) - what more could you want for a lunch date."}
{"text":"Knew this was a good place when you look at the menu and there's Vietnamese translation of their dishes ;)  Ordered their house pho noodles w/ a bit of everything: trite, flank, meatballs & good pho.  but their iced coffee, i would say would rank up right there w/ all the ones i've tried in Vancouver & London, Ontario.  so good, that i ordered a 2nd one for take out ;)  Clean, mostly table seating w/ about 5 booth seating.  Parking's plenty, in a busy area by the Chinook shopping mall.  definitely will repeat next time i'm in town.  and friendly manager, good customer service, and w/ these places, bring the debit/credit machine is a hit and miss but here they do ;)"}
{"text":"Golden Bell is solid!  If you're craving pho along 17th ave, Golden Bell is the place to be!    The food is delicious. The service is quick and friendly.    Personally, I love eating tripe, so I usually get the pho noodles with beef and tripe. If you are unsure, go for the house pho which has a little bit of everything.  YUM."}
{"text":"I've eaten here dozens of times, how have I missed yelping it? Nevermind, this will straighten all of that out.  Golden Bell on 17th is right next to Boston Pizza, its got a full menu of Vietnamese dishes from Pho to all the other noodley goodness in between. The service is friendly, the place is licensed and on a warm summer day their wee patio out from is AWESOME.  Staying true to my Vietnamese experience in Calgary so far, I've been sticking with vermicelli dishes... in particular, the ones that come with spring rolls. Most places, this is the pork dish. At Golden Bell, I'm happy to report that there are at least 4 or 5 options so you can have spring rolls cut up and placed on top of your delicious bowl of noodles and other good things. For instance, today I had #64, pork balls and various types of beef adorned my bowl. If it were a pizza, it would be the meat lovers.  They also serve bubble tea, though I haven't had occasion to try it. A friend staying with me last week went back two days in a row for their bubble tea. Was it that good? Or was it the only place nearby? I don't know, but it was at least tasty enough for a second try. The Vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk is also a fun experience. You've got to wait for it to finish dripping first, and then pour it into a glass of condensed milk, then into a glass of ice. If it's warm, you'll want to dump out some of the ice that has melted first, and give it all a good stir before you start to drink it."}
{"text":"I don't really understand why this place is so popular. I've come here a few times with friends just because of its convenient location but I'm always disappointed. The prices are quite high - especially for Vietnamese food - which I understand because it's 17th Ave, but still. Honestly it's been so long since I came here and it as so underwhelming that I can't actually remember what I ate. I remember lukewarm noodles... and flavourless broth... and some super over blanched vegetables... But the rest is foggy. I don't recommend coming here. If you want pho there are plenty of better options and if you want subs go to Thai Tai."}
{"text":"Golden Bell is one of my go-to's for Vietnamese.  It's convenient, it's consistent, it's reasonably priced.  When my weekly craving for pho needs to be satisfied, I often hit Golden Bell.  The broth is not oily nor overly sweet (I do not like pho with a sweeter broth).  The beef is sliced thin and is not gristly.  I would prefer it to be more rare, but it does cook in the broth, which is always piping hot so I suppose I could eat it faster.  For those vermicelli dishes - order one that comes with the spring rolls on top - they are some of the best that I've had.  Service is always pleasant, though depending on the day can be inconsistent in terms of speed or english proficiency.    They do have a small patio out front which is excellent for people watching along 17th, though the tables are a tad small for my liking.  Honestly, if you like Vietnamese and you live in the Beltline, stop by this place and try one of their many, many delicious dishes.  I've always left happy and satisfied."}
{"text":"Great selection of both Vietnamese food and Chinese food.  The Pho soup is a bit on the saltier side (compared to other pho places) but it's still good and rightly sized.  I'm a huge fan of their salt & pepper squid.  One of the best in town."}
{"text":"Love this place! The staff are always so friendly and prompt. The food selection is huge! Everything I have tried has been very flavourful and the portions are large (always leave with a doggy bag). The prices are very good to boot. Overall my experiences have been great and I always look forward to going back!"}
