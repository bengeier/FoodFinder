{"text":"This is my absolute favorite pizza ever. Unfortunately, I live 450 miles away.

I grew up eating Maxim's from their old location on E 185th Street and now visit their Mentor location every time I'm in the area. These folks know what they're doing. I only wish i could find pizza like this where I live now. Nothing comes close. Simple, classic ingredients with a lot of flavor... Great sauce and crust make this top notch."}
{"text":"It is completely my mother's fault that I have become totally addicted to Maxim's pizza.  Back when their location was in Euclid my mom would take me on my way home from skating lessons, sharing with me a bit of her own childhood (you know a place is good when it's managed to stay around this long - and NO that was not implying that my mom is old either!).  Now that they have a location in Mentor I find that we frequent this amazing place much more frequently.

There is just something about this pizza - the flavors are good, the dough is delicious, and it's almost like the pieces just melt in your mouth!  And every type of pizza they make is outstanding (trust me, I would know - I've tried them all!).  I haven't tried any of the other food offerings, but if they're anything like the pizza then it has to be good!  I'm just warning you now - it's WAAAYYY too hard to just have one piece!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza by far, not to mention the friendly customer service (family owned business). The meatball subs are delicious and the hot cooked meals (pasta dinner, lasagna etc) are amazing. They also have really good party trays, bakery, (pies during holiday season) etc. The list goes on and on with this place and I would highly recommend stopping in and getting a slice of pizza or trying their spaghetti dinner."}
{"text":"I decided to place an order here after reading Paulius' review, and I can't speak highly enough of the food.  The pizza is great, especially the sauce, but by far the most impressive thing about my meal was the canolli.  I can't wait to order from here in the near future!"}
{"text":"How rare to find such a great, locally-owned gem in the middle of Mentor's chain-gang suburbia. 

This Italian bakery and deli has been around since 1949, so this tells me they must be doing something right. 

This was my first time ever trying a pizza from Maxim's and it was fantastic! Normally I'm not a huge fan of \"bakery 'zza\", but this dough wasn't too bready. The sauce was zesty, tart and not in the least bit sweet. I can tolerate a sweeter sauce, but I appreciate all kinds--as long as they're good! And you can't beat the price! We pre-ordered a half sheet of cheese pizza for an post little league team snack for only $12.50! Gross big-box pizza chains are way more expensive and not worth the price. 

Although Maxim's is pick-up only, it's totally worth it! They also have a full bakery and deli, so I definitely plan on coming back to try more. Besides, the folks who work there are the nicest people ever. I'm sure that has something to do with why they've been around for so long--they treat their customers right!

Oh, as for that half sheet... Well, let's just say I haven't seen 7 year olds mow an entire pizza that fast in my life."}
{"text":"Now in Mentor on Lakeshore Blvd / rt#615, on the south side of the street.  Too bad for E.185 to have lost this place.  Oh well...  Anyway, the \"new\" Maxims has not lost the charm, or the incredible foods.  They make a helluva sauce that is available frozen, with or sans meatballs, frozen pizza dough (homemade), and, my favorite, pizza by the slice.  Actually, they are squares, as they make them by the sheet. Garlic/oil/pepperoncini?  Yep.  Black olive & artichoke?  Sure...  Plain pepperoni and/or sausage... OMG is it good.  The secrets in the sauce....  Also, for a bit of history, check out the 40's fighter and family member \"Joey Maxims\" boxing gloves and photos.  But the sauce... THE SAUCE IS THE BOMB!  oh yeah, in-house bakery with great conolli too!"}
{"text":"Amazing! This is by far the best pizza in the area! If you haven't tried it, go! Now!! We got a large white pizza with mushrooms, onions and sausage. Mmmm. They top it with some pepper. Delicious!!! We also ordered a small cheese pizza! Just as delicious. This is our new place to get pizza :) once you try it, it will be yours too! :)"}
{"text":"When you drive 20 miles only to find out they actually close an hour earlier than the Yelp times say, you lose all cred. 1 star for you, Maxim's."}
