{"text":"Fulton Market Burger is located in a new strip mall in Thornhill just outside of Promenade Mall. The place is decorated very nicely with light wood and aluminum tables, pictures of New York, a flat screen T.V. to indicate when your order is up, wooden chairs with aluminum legs, light wooden booths, dark hardwood flooring, and aluminum light fixtures.   Don't bother approaching the counter to order. Head straight to the ordering station where you will grab a paper bag and a pencil and proceed to check off every option desired on your burger. Interesting toppings include grilled portobella mushrooms, grilled zucchini, sauteed shitake mushrooms, grilled pineapple, Gorgonzola, double smoked bacon, and plenty more. If you are making your own burger and not getting a signature one, be sure to count what you're checking off as you may end up with a $17 burger... not that I did something as ridiculous as that..... that's just stupid.... and reckless....Uh-hum.... right, so where was I? Oh the fries! Stick with either the fries or the onion rings in this joint as the sweet potato fries are cut too thick and aren't crisp. Onion rings are decent, remind me of the kind you get at Harvey's.  Overall, the burgers offered here are decent. Nothing to rave about but definitely worth checking out, especially if you like Hero Burger. I think these are better. Prices are on par for a gourmet fast food burger but don't do what I did and go crazy with the toppings. You'll pay for it, literally."}
{"text":"I went to this place before reading the reviews, my boyfriend has been wanting to try it for long time.  The meat with nice because it was prime rib but it is still portion packaged and it tastes like it. It's like eating a cardboard burger. I threw out almost all my burger. It just didn't have taste, didn't do anything for me.  The fries were just your everyday fast food fry and the onion rings were McCain and all batter.  Overall I wouldn't suggest trying this place, it was 20 bucks for two combos and I threw mine out.  Just another Gordon food service restaurant"}
{"text":"I've only been here once but what I remember and what I tell everyone were the GREAT sweet potato fries Now I guess it's a preference thing cause I do see here that someone says they are \"too thick\" but I thought they were PERFECT they are a little thicker but i love that! many places the sweet potatoes fries are too small and shriveled and fried to hell and have no taste; just crisp but these... because they are thicker you get a great soft sweet potato taste and texture and they seem to be kind of covered in a tempura type batter they are crispy to bite into and soft in the middle a perfect sweet potato fry! hell.. a perfect ANY fry  the burger was good too nothing special i liked that you could choose your bun, toppings, etc honestly, i just remember the sweet potato fries and people complain about cost ($20 for 2 combos) ... McDonalds charges about the same ... is it not like $8 for a big mac combo and this is REAL meat  I would say it is quite good"}
