{"text":"ONE star because, my server never came back to check on us. I had to get up to find someone to get a refill and check. My pulled pork sandwich was originally served at almost room temperature. I sent it back, but the next sandwich wasn't that much better. Lastly, my pulled pork sandwich wasn't that good...Needed seasoning  Won't visit this place again"}
{"text":"Sat waiting for TEN MINUTES at the bar before anyone came to take our to-go order. Meanwhile I hear the bartender taking a phone order from someone. So you'll take orders from people on the phone immediately but make the people who are right in front of you wait. Bad business."}
{"text":"Very good and consistent barbecue! I've had the dry rub ribs why were meaty and flavorful. I've also had the smoked turkey and brisket sandwiches which were both great- authentic, tasty, with a nice smokey flavor to them. The meat is the best here and one of my favorite bbq places in town.   As for sides, they are a bit disappointing.  The cornbread is ok, I don't like the corn pieces in it really. The fries kind of a look like cheap looking store bought crinkle cut fries and they are always soggy and limp as a take out order.   I have also been to the Mooresville branch which is consistent too. So depending on which part of the city you live in, you can plan accordingly.   TIP: If you go through the drive thru expect to wait longer than a fast food drive thru. The attendant who serves me at this location always smiles and is pleasant."}
{"text":"Sonny's BBQ was a big catering hit! I called a week in advance and Sonny's was able to cater for 80 people for our work event. The staff set everything up for me with no problems. The food was outstanding and the catering prices were very responsible. I would highly recommend their catering service."}
{"text":"Never got our orders. We left after the ice melted in our drinks. The floor under the table was littered with food. I will never ever ever go back. I can't believe the health department allows this dump to serve the public"}
{"text":"Sonny's wasn't bad at all.  I've seen many billboards but never tried it.  Service was fine and friendly.  Ribs were good and meaty.   I like this place more then the other BBQ place in concord."}
{"text":"The food was great! I had the sweet Carolina pork sandwich with bbq beans. Just what I was looking for during my business trip. Service was great too, very friendly staff. Food came out quick."}
{"text":"Went to Sonny's fro first time.  It's a chain, which makes it somewhat less \"traditional\" but it was still very good.  Had the Redneck Egg Rolls (see, less traditional) which is an egg roll with pulled pork, coleslaw and cheese.  Awesome!  Had the corn balls (creamed corn covered in batter, deep fried with powdered sugar.)  Excellent.  No hush puppies.  Pulled pork was good, ribs were very good and BBQ chicken was good.  Coleslaw was average (no red coleslaw) mac and cheese was tremendous and corn muffins were very good.  Overall, we'd go back - kids will force us to for the mac and cheese alone."}
{"text":"Had the sliced beef brisket combo.  Sandwich was really good!! Look forward to returning soon."}
{"text":"Food: 4 stars Service: 3 stars Timeliness: 1 star Cleanliness: 1 star  Took over half an hour to get our food. The restaurant was less than half full. When the food finally came out our pulled chicken was ice cold.   Restrooms were pretty messy. The stalls didn't have toilet paper in them, and when we notified a staff member, who was standing idly, she merely dismissed us. The restaurant was grimy relative to other Sonnys I've been in.  Wouldn't recommend you eat here... or stop to potty."}
{"text":"This place had very slow service not only did we wait 40 minutes to get our meal, when we did, the bbq meat was super dry and absolutely no flavor thank goodness I had my sprite to help me down it all!!! I reccomend going down the street to Macs Speed shop if you guys want real BBQ"}
{"text":"I arrived to customers standing outside the door, after waiting for 25 minutes. While standing in line I overheard the kitchen staff telling the waiters all the food has been in the Window so long that it was all cold, that same food was still taken out and served. I was finally greeted by the seating host. I was a party of one and was taken to my table and seated at a table that had used dishes, cups ect... still on the table. I sat there for 5 minutes before getting up to leave. It's a wonder how this place stays in business with all the other options.  I am being generous when I give 1 star."}
{"text":"Enjoying some BBQ chicken, pulled pork, baked beans, mac & cheese, sweet tea and a cornbread muffin. Tender meat and flavorful sides. The cornbread came with a squirt of honey. I had the mild and sweet sauces which were quite tasty. Service was prompt and friendly. I'd definitely come back when I'm in NC again."}
{"text":"Had an early dinner there the other day.  My friend & I got different items so we could test more items since neither of us was ever here.  The ribs were great - perfectly cooked. The sliced pork & chicken were good - not slathered in bbq sauce.   Sides were beans (too much bbq flavor for me), ear of corn, & cole slaw (good, not too much mayo).  Cornbread muffin was good, but the garlic toast looked like a piece of old French toast - soggy, not crisp.    The salad bar was somewhat small - only iceberg lettuce & some spinach.  Ok, for an add-on, but not sufficient for a meal."}
{"text":"Sonny's was a little disappointing.  Now, we went on Father's Day and dads eat free, which was cool...if I had to pay full price for what I ate, I would be very upset.  I got a \"rack\" of ribs...spare ribs.  Just because they are not baby backs, it doesn't mean that they can't be tender people.  I don't understand how a pit smoked rib can be so tough and hard to get off the bone.  Its \"Fall off the bone\" and \"Stick to your ribs\" not \"Stick to the bone\"  The salad bar was the very definition of nothing special.  I don't think I will be craving the food anytime soon.   What saved it was the service.  The kitchen screwed up our order and we had a large party but our server handled it very well.  I could tell that she had a long shift already but she was bright and cheerful towards us.  She covered the mistakes well and offered great service and was right on the spot with refills.    Don't think I'll be back, unless Jim N Nicks and Macs Speed Shop burns down...together"}
{"text":"The BBQ is not exactly what I am use to down in Texas.  I was not terrible by no means but just not as tasty as I am use to having in my home state."}
{"text":"No. no. No. staying overnight at the nearby Hilton. Decided to try it out. Cold stale fries. Sticky sauce all over the outside of the carry out container. Messy. Had to ask for a wet hand wipe to sign my debit receipt! Tough barbecue. Reheated? The barbecue was hot, but tough. But while they were tough and hot, the fries were stale and cold! Soggy corn bread. $11.90.  A mess. Denny's is right next door. Chili's across from that. Even McDonalds might be a better choice. It's across the street. Maybe try that. Seemed like Sonny's was leftovers from another plate, tossed into a used container and thrown at me. And I paid for that. I felt underwhelmed and upset. Customer service was kind. The young lady taking the order both on phone, and in person, was very sweet. But the food was subpar."}
{"text":"Been to this place many times as it is a favorite of my wife and kids. Although this may not be award winning barbecue it is still respectable and the all you can eat portion fits even the largest of bellies full of what ever item you like unless you like ribs or brisket.  Four sauces to choose from to keep the flavor changing and plowing throw the tiny plates of meat refills. You can really give the waitress a workout as you reorder plate after plate of approximately 2 ounce portions of meat. Sure they have small lunch portions and the not all you can eat portions but where is the fun in that. For some reason they brought out two sides as a sort of garnish for the true meal....the meat. Granted like I said it is not award winning but that doesn't stop me from going to an all you can eat Chinese buffet either."}
{"text":"Came here with some family for Father's Day, and thoroughly enjoyed myself.  Started out with the Redneck Egg Rolls, which are pulled pork, cole slaw, and a little jack cheese. The proportions of meat to slaw to cheese were just right, with the pork dominating the majority of the roll, with just enough slaw and cheese to provide some crispness and creaminess. They were fried well and not greasy at all, served with a spicy ranch for dipping. The sauce was pretty good, but honestly they didn't need it. Would definitely get them again.  For the entree, I went with the Brisket version of the Big Deal combo, which is a sandwich, side, and drink. I got mine on garlic bread with fries. I'm a sucker for crinkle cut fries as long as they're not soggy or greasy, and these were done just right. Sonny's garlic bread is always a winner for me as well, just crisp enough, while still being soft with a little chew in the center. The brisket was tender, flavorful, and juicy, and I recommend it highly.  The service was generally good, but had one or two hiccups. They forgot to bring out my brother-in-law's fries at first, but were quick to bring him out some fresh ones after we pointed it out. There was also a decently long wait to get refills on our drinks at times, but it wasn't a deal-breaker.  My sister ordered a chopped brisket plate with mac n' cheese and baked beans as her sides, and didn't really care for either of them. Based on past experiences, I'd tend to agree with her, they are decent but really just mediocre."}
{"text":"Love the flexibility of drive thru for on the run when needing a quick meal without having to get out the car. Sonny's provides a better drive through meal option outside of normal burger locations."}
{"text":"The chicken and ribs were so tender and juicy the meat fell off the bone. They have a variety of bbq sauces to satisfy all palates. I recommend Sonny's highly"}
{"text":"Can't get better BBQ than Sonny's. I've tried several of the other options in the area and my family keeps coming back. Love the pulled pork a mac & cheese."}
{"text":"Had a wonderfull dinner with family at Sonnys. Salad bar was teally good fresh and nice and cold. Had all you can eat ribs and verybgood with the sweet sauce. Waitries was very nice snd even gavr me a few extra ribs to take home"}
{"text":"Great food and nice friendly servers.  Worth the stop if you are nearby.  Pulled, sliced, ribs and chicken all good!"}
{"text":"Was just an 'eh' experience.  Pulled pork was ok made better with the sizzling BBQ sauce.  Seems like it was all pre-made."}
{"text":"This visit to Sonny's was the typical goodness I expect.  The sliced pork was juicy and delicious.  The kid loved the smoked turkey -- even got a second serving.  Super friendly service and sweet tea refills like crazy. Sure miss this place."}
{"text":"Got the all you can eat ribs with baked potato, baked beans, and corn bread.  The baked potato was overcooked and the beans super sweet with no smoke. Corn bread just taste bad.  The sweet ribs were ok but certainly not something you want a lot of. I have always loved the brisket sandwich but haven't tried this location. Stick to that or avoid. It isn't worth it and isn't typical for the South."}
{"text":"I visited around lunch time and the food was not that good. I was expecting it to be a lot tastier. The entree was a  dry. I's a good thing I had sauce. I am sorry, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"For a chain restaurant Sonny's can't be beat.  Bench for Sonny's many of times always the same taste too it's meat and barbecue is not bad I recommend paying a little extra and going to Midwood smokehouse the best barbecue in town."}
{"text":"$40 for a Family Feast?  Yes please!  Very generous portions.  Our server was attentive and sweet, but very experienced.  We sat on an empty patio, but was not ignored.  She has some serving skills to pick up, but I'm not faulting her for that. I've never had a Cowboy egg roll before (pork, coleslaw in a deep friend egg roll) and it was pretty darn good even without the \"smoky\" ranch sauce.  I thought the brisket was very flavorful but a little on the dry side.  Speaking on things overcooked - the corn on the cob was like baby food.  I actually asked the girl for more cornbread (which is perfectly cooked) in substution of the cob.  I'm pretty sure that sat around in simmering water for waaaay too long. Mac n cheez, green beans - all southern style.   3 (or was it 4?) different BBQ sauces - I personally enjoyed the smoky sweet."}
{"text":"I was really craving BBQ, too bad it comes with a side of sexual harassment. After that I was then barred from the establishment. Oh well."}
{"text":"Love this location! Always good food and service. Family feast is a great buy. Ribs, chicken, beef brisket, pulled pork, 4 corn muffins, 2 sides and 4 drinks $39.99."}
{"text":"Just finishing my pulled pork sandwich... Delicious!  They serve a great cole slaw as well.  Server was friendly, fast, polite... Ask for Deedee!"}
{"text":"I only eat here occasionally because a couple of my co-workers like it.  Bland bbq, bland chicken.  OK salad bar.  Overpriced for the quality.  I have never understood the allure of this chain."}
{"text":"I cannot believe a bbq sandwich by it self is $8. Only about 3 or 4 oz. Of meat. Prices at Sonnys have gone through the roof."}
{"text":"Pretty decent food for a chain. Our server was very friendly and outgoing and offered to bring us tea as soon as we were seated. I like the chain custom of offering a to-go cup for tea, which is very good and refreshing. Really solid corn bread. Good deal on the ribs, which had a very noticeable smoke ring and good flavor. This isn't a holy grail of BBQ but expect a decent meal if you're in town."}
{"text":"I love the price, food, and staff! The location is convenient to Concord mills, my church, and the interstate."}
{"text":"Sorry, but I believe Sonny's BBQ is the worst BBQ that I've ever tasted. The ribs, very dry... Chicken absolutely tasteless.  Cornbread (if you can call it that) was so heavy.. More likely used as a weapon.   What a Shame!!!"}
{"text":"Service was good, food was mediocre at best. If you are looking for good tasting BBQ go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Don't eat anything but the chicken. Everything else is nasty. Charlotte should be a BBQ mecca, it isn't because of the chains. Go back to Florida, they like it there."}
{"text":"I visited Sonny's 2 weeks ago while visiting Charlotte from Boston. The place was clean and priced reasonably ($37 for 3adult--2 of that was lunch sized, 1 dinner sized, and 1 kids meal) the portion sizes were good.   Mac n cheese -- awesome, it consisted of real cheese and the blue boxed stuff  Cornbread -- very, very good! I'm pretty sure there was some pig fat or grease baked into it!   Catfish-- was baked and completely covered with breadcrumbs. I was under the assumption that it was a baked on topping, something 'lighter'. It did taste good though.  Water--was totally okay! I even had a lemon wedge in mine :)  Beef brisket-- juicy, very good according to mom  Roasted chicken(forgot the name) --- was alright, certainly nothing to brag about  It's definitely not what expected for 'real' southern cooking, but I'd go back because it's cheap and more than edible. Oh and also for the cornbread!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went there yesterday for lunch with some friends.  The food was pretty good.  I had the beef brisket with beans and coleslaw and the garlic toast.  The beef was good.  portions a little on the small side.  The beans were undercooked and still a little hard.  There must be better bar-b-que in Charlotte, where is it?"}
{"text":"Pretty good consistent BBQ I always get ribs and they do have really nice Mac and cheese ..we also like the salad bar it is one of the best salad bars ..the pulled chicken sandwich was a little dry and boring ...the kids did like the slice pork sandwich ...over all OK not my favorite BBQ place in town but I'll rank it as decent BBQ"}
{"text":"Again such a yummy lunch.  We always eat here best bbq in Charlotte. Kids always get there fill. Everyone is friendly feels homey."}
{"text":"Food was cold when it came out and the service is not so hot either. The waitress seemed like she was doing us a favor to take our order. So with that being said, Do yourself a favor and go to somewhere better for BBQ like Farmers on Mallard Creek Church road or Shane's off WT Harris. Both are cheaper and the food is wayyyyy better than this Sonny's. We will not be returning to this location ever again after our experience today."}
{"text":"My son and I ate lunch here today. Our first visit. While Sonny's certainly doesn't feel upscale, we had great service, the food arrived quickly and everything was good. I enjoyed the retroish idea of the salad bar - although some of the prepared salads could have used some stirring to freshen them up. My son's brisket sandwich was tasty. Fries are typical frozen fare.   All in all, it's not your local mom-n-pop BBQ, but it was a good experience. I would go back."}
{"text":"Never go to this location again! The service was horrible, we had to reorder our food 6 times, it came out wrong, they didn't have what we ordered, they ran out of all you can eat ribs after just 3 bones,four families came in after us but got food before us, and the manager insisted that we still pay.  Not to mention the staff was not properly trained.  If you value your dollar and want any level of satisfactory service GO SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place and i eat here everyday. If anyone go in place with any struggle then be understanding.  complaining and write bad reviews on yelp for what? David if you know the owner and his dad then offer to help. Everyday can be good or bad depending on many uncontrollable anomalies. Seriously David???what is wrong with you? you have a son but still not being understanding? what kind of role model are you posing for your son by going on yelp and write a bad review about Sonny's BBQ? YOUR STUPID REVIEW ONLY SHOW THAT YOU ARE JUST ANOTHER SHALLOW PRICKS AND BIGGEST SOB ON YELP. SERIOUSLY DUDE BE A BETTER MAN. IT SEEMS THAT YOU  HAVE NO SOUL AND WANT EVERYTHING TO GO YOUR WAY. HEAVEN FORBID THOSE WHO DO NOT OBEY YOU. YOU ARE OBVIOUSLY DRIVEN WITH HATRED.  There are men like Richard Holbroke who help to make the world better place to live and and there are people like you David who make the world worst, especially on yelp and perhaps in life.  Only coward weirdo with your level of pettiness would go on yelp and write these stuff. seriously dude"}
{"text":"It's....fine. all I got to say about it, really. Not bad, decent value, and I can see this being consistent in quality. It's decent for a chain. It'll go in my road trip options."}
{"text":"We were visiting from Greenville SC and have always enjoyed Sonny's. The food was great and the server Steven was absolutely fantastic! We ate at the Cheesecake Factory last night and the overall experience was much better at Sonny's."}
{"text":"Don't know why the address says Quail Hollow ..this restaurant is in the Arboretum. Anyway, usually OK BBQ with good service.  However my wife orders the pulled chicken sandwich, and it came this time with quite a bit of gristle.  So beware if you order this item. Never had a problem with the pulled pork."}
{"text":"Pork was good, the smokin sauce was good , BBQ beans were fantastic, mac n cheese was a bit of a disappointment which would be 3 stars but the service from the lady at the carry out counter is why I won't be back and dock a star. I'm sorry to have troubled you by spending money there. I'll go back to Jim and Nicks."}
{"text":"When the parking lot was empty at 6:30 on a Friday night, we should have realized the warning signs of a bad meal coming. The host took forever to pick one of the many empty tables at which to seat us. There were no issues with the speed or relative friendliness of service, except that there were no refills offered until our meal was complete. Our main concern was the very poor quality of the food. I am a certified BBQ judge with ten years of competition experience. I have seen a lot of Q, good, bad, and in between. This was bad pork. It was very poorly pulled. All fat and grease. No good pprtions of meat at all. The color was gray and the texture was slimy. The taste was marred significantly by the poor meat quality. The portion was shockingly small. Our sides were also sub par. We try a lot of BBQ on our travels and this was a highly regrettable experience. The kid's meal chicken tenders were good. Order that if you must eat here."}
{"text":"Very good barbecue. Too bad it was pork instead of beef. Would recommend it though. Very friendly people, as is the norm in this part of the country."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Sonny's in a while and some family friends invited me when I came up to Charlotte to visit. We were seated promptly and that was about the only good thing about the place. We had to ask the waitress for EVERYTHING. I ordered cornbread and got garlic bread instead, so she went and got me some cornbread. After touching it, it was cold. As I requested a new one she said they serve them at room temperature... Something I've never heard of as you serve cornbread hot. We constantly had to ask for refills as well.   The food was plain. There was really no flavor to the chicken or the pork. Just seemed really flavorless and bland. I will not be going to Sonny's for another while."}
{"text":"Dry rub ribs were awesome. Great smoke, tender, but not too tender where all the meat falls off the bone when you take a bite... Sides are kind of mediocre and an afterthought."}
{"text":"I visited NC and thought this place was disgusting, I sure was right!  Heyyy Tubel,  You're a man of no honor, a coward, and someone should slap the hell out of your mother. So basically, 'you're going to have to do what you need to and we're going to do what we need to do...'  and thats to drive down the street to Macs Speed Shop (delicious bbq) & or Mckoys Smokehouse and Saloon (delicious bbq).   I dont do business with business owners who support sexual harassment."}
{"text":"Food here is over priced for the quality and taste, the ribs were just way too dry and had too much sauce on it, probably trying to cover up the quality of their meat.  The staff here is also not too friendly, or maybe I caught them out on a bad day, because they were just acting like this was the last place they wanted to be.  tl;dr come here if you want bad service with low quality food"}
{"text":"I visited this place since im visiting from Florida and they are close to hotel. the server was a very nice lady. very prompt and explained the menu and how they work.  on Thursday's the have all you can eat baby back ribs. i have 4 and it was delicious.  the price was awesome i paid almost nothing compared to similar restaurants in miami Florida.  i will come again.  thanks!"}
{"text":"Hired Sonnys to cater, deliver and serve my husband's Surprise 50th.  With news of the impending storm this past weekend panic set in that 8 inches of snow would prevent them from fulfilling my order. On Friday Richard and his staff prepared my order in advance, packed it all on ice chests, and threw in all the paper goods, serving dishes, table cloths, EVERYTHING!   The food was AMAZING!!! When I came to pick it up Richard took 40% off my bill to apologize for the inconvenience.  Can't thank you enough for making my husband's party a hit!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered in for a meeting and had a great response form our guests. Will do again soon."}
{"text":"Wow is all I have to say! The service is great! The food is sooooo good!!! Prices are reasonable! Servers were sweet and very attentive."}
{"text":"I guess this place allows sexual harassment to happen and fires the victim for coming forward about it? Disgusting. Guess I never need to eat this mediocre BBQ ever again. Consider my business gone."}
{"text":"I am very picky about my Q, but this was one of the best pulled pork BBQs ever.  If not the best, it certainly is in the top 3.  Highly recommend.  Good sides too.       Service was not up to the level of the food.  The store was slow, 3pm, so that is no excuse.  Server was friendly for sure, but I never saw her.  This was especially troublesome as I had ordered the all-you-can-eat pulled pork.  I got one serving."}
{"text":"Being from FL, it's a treat to see a state staple here in NC. I'm biased when it comes to BBQ and this is no exception. This location is my first time and I'm impressed. The staff is excellent and very personable. I don't expect less from any Sonny's location I've visited. So I don't expect the food to be any different either."}
{"text":"Mediocre bbq as the other chains location but service was quite good here! The salad bar was very fresh and bbq meats were just ok. Probably will stop by again if I am in the area and nothing else is open."}
{"text":"Visited the drive thru to place an order for the Chopped Brisket combo. I ordered broccoli as my side. I requested the brisket well done and I noticed the young lady taking my order ignored me on that. No worries, I figured I would just inquire at the window as to if she heard me. When I did inquire, the young lady spoke in a condescending tone and told me that the food 'should' be well done but it might be slightly pink due to it being smoked. She then asked what type of sauce I wanted and since I have not had Sonny's since at least 2003, I asked if she could tell me the offering. Again, in a condescending tone she called out the sauces and at this point, even my daughter and husband where asking why did she seem to have an attitude. I ordered the sweet sauce and waited to be served my food. While waiting, I observed the other two young ladies in the kitchen area looking at me. I figured that my cashier must have said something about me asking so many questions or something. Oh well.   The food was mediocre. The sandwich was toasted very well and seemed very buttery (low-carbing so my husband ate the Texas toast). My broccoli was horrible. I now see that they were closing when we came so that has to explain why the broccoli tasted like last year's prison broccoli. The brisket was very good and tender. I did not need the sauce at all. Overall, I was hoping for a better experience and after spending $12 and receiving mediocre tasting food and unfriendly customer service; I definitely left disappointed."}
{"text":"This Sonny's location has been recently refurbished, which looks better than it did before; though it is one of the smaller locations for this chain restaurant.  I do visit this Sonny's more often because of its proximity to I-77 (when driving by) and/or it's location in front of Costco, when I shop there; so I guess I'm somewhat of a regular.  On my last visit, I ordered the Pork 3-Way plate with fries, coleslaw, and sweet tea.  The order went fast, with food already on table within' five minutes.  The coleslaw was as expected: sweet, slightly creamy with a good crunch to it.  The fries were okay I guess, though a few were soft.  The pulled pork was very good, I drizzled it with sizzilin' sweet sauce on top and ate it with the garlic bread.  The sliced pork (which I asked to be chopped) was good too.  The ribs (dry rubbed) were probably the weakest on the plate, the underneath part of the rib was nothing but fat and was easy to scrap off by a knife; were kind of dry but not bad.  Overall, it was a good meal.  The waitress came by the table often to refill my drink without asking; overall good service.  Now is this the best barbeque around, no... but it's not bad either.  Sonny's is one of the better barbeque chain restaurants in the southeast and this location is one of its better locations, and that is how I am rating it."}
{"text":"Average BBQ for an average price.  Nothing spectacular but not bad either.   I was a little disappointed by the brisket and the beans. Had the corn bites appetizer and they were very good.  I'd say if your close give it a try, if not I'd pass."}
{"text":"I LOVE Sonny's BBQ!!!!   This is the 1st time I have not only been disappointed, I was disgusted.  1/2 of my beef Brisket was 100% fat.  Not marbling.  FAT.  Ok.  I was debating just being ticked... but I said something... and  he manager brought me a new plate with PERFECT brisket.  THANKS!!!!"}
{"text":"This review is not about the food, (which was great) it's about the service. We were seated quickly and our server Sharon came to our table immediately. Sharon is a gem. What a delight. The way she said peach cobbler and banana pudding made my mouth water. I think I want to have Sonny's cater my daughter's wedding, and Sharon to be our server."}
{"text":"Soooo I frequent the Arboretum and never noticed Sonny's until today. First, why is it on the other end of the plaza... I've been missing out. The Ribs were really good and the only reason I'm not giving this spot 5 stars is because my bread was cold... like refrigerator cold."}
{"text":"I ordered the 3 pork combo which includes ribs,pulled and sliced pork.  This I must say is a fabulous dish. I ordered it dry and loved the side sauces that were at the table. I can't wait to visit this place again."}
{"text":"I was in a time-crunch and starving and chose this Sonny's over some nearby chain restaurants. I'd been to a Sonny's a couple years back on a visit to Florida (when I was living in NY) and thought it was decent reasonably priced BBQ. Now that I live in NC and frequently travel to the BBQ capitols of the world (TX, TN, SC, NC) I know what the best BBQ should be. In fact, just a week before I'd had some of the best BBQ I'd ever eaten on a visit to Fort Worth. By comparison, the grub at this place was not nearly as good as what I'd remembered it to be. My chicken was bone dry, the ribs were small and dry, and the pulled pork was ok but unremarkable. That said, my server was friendly, the cost was low, the food came fast, and there was a decent amount of food for the price. I probably won't return to a Sonny's again unless I'm in a similar jam to this past time."}
{"text":"Given the audio recording of management, the owner and a human resources representative for this chain discounting and devaluing an employee immediately prior to firing her (illegally at that) - I refuse to contribute to the funds this franchise will undoubtedly be paying to Lauren Jones. Furthermore, I wouldn't want to be seen on the property as a female.  Let 'em go as bankrupt as their morals and business ethics are: North Carolina prefers Dickey's BBQ anyway - It's better."}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean and well maintained. Our waitress was outstanding.   The food was sub-par. Ribs were over done and dried out.  Corn was over cooked and soggy.  Green beans were a mess as was the corn bread.     This is not a good example of real southern barbecue.  New York maybe, but not North Carolina."}
{"text":"Arrived with a party of 7 and was promptly seated. However, it took over 40 mins to get our food. When it came, it was cold. Subpar BBQ joint with slow service. Would not eat again."}
{"text":"When I moved to Charlotte, (being a BBQ fan) I was excited that a BBQ place was so close to my new apartment. It didn't take long for us to head over to try out Sonny's. Unfortunately I discovered that we'll have to search a little more to find great BBQ. It wasn't bad, but my fiance and I were both unimpressed. We don't eat out that much, so when we do, we want to make sure that it's really worth the trip. Unfortunately, this place wasn't and I am still on the search for that great BBQ place in Charlotte."}
{"text":"I thought I liked Sonny's so maybe it was just this place, but the food tasted like it was all premade frozen dinners that were reheated.  The service was really excellent though.  My companion got the endless ribs and his plate was never empty."}
{"text":"This was a very generic BBQ eatery, I cannot call it a restaurant. The burger was super thin on one side and the other was like a McDonald's patty. The fries on both orders were over cooked. As for the dry rubbed ribs, they tasted like industrial commercial grade prepackaged grub--the greens beans were mushy and I'd say tasteless--but there was a taste of something??? Giving 1-star because our server was super sweet. Never ever going back."}
{"text":"I'll give the dinner 3 stars but really most of my contention was the waitress.  Not sure why she was so pushy and anxious. From the time I sat down she was continually questioning me to place my order and I hadn't even opened my menu.  Maybe I looked like I'd been here before but I told her in two different trips to give me a minute to look the menu over.   My food (BBQ ribs ) was served on a pizza tray!   Not sure how that is even possible to eat your dinner on a pizza tray.  My knife kept cutting through the thin paper that separated my food from the metal tray.   Finally the hyper waitress brought me the check while I was still eating.  Basically that tells me there's nothing more for me .... she's done whether I was or not.  I have to admit I find that rude for the check to be left before I am done eating.  The food was meh... dry .,, but the experience sorta ruined the dinner for me."}
{"text":"I will only speak in detail about the food I personally ate here. But I will say that the others that were there with me also really enjoyed their food.  The place was pretty empty when we got there, so that kinda made we wonder......., but we really were not there at prime time.  I ordered a sweet tea & the \"Whole Hog\" sandwich. That sandwich is Sliced Pork, Pulled Pork and Jalapeño Cheddar Hot Links topped with Sweet BBQ Sauce on a bun. Everything I had was on point. The sandwich was great....... so good I thought about ordering another one to go. The sweet tea had the waitress filling my glass 3 or 4 times.   Sonny's is a chain, but the food was great. The wait staff was average, no complaints. The food is the star, the way it should be."}
{"text":"My wife and I often go to this restaurant on non-weekend nights and have gotten great food and service. Our last visit was no exception.   Our waiter, Bob, was attentive and worked hard to ensure our experience was positive. He should be commended for his efforts.   Our food and service has always consistently been delicious at this Sonny's, which is not necessarily true for others we have ate at over the years. Like many franchises, those things can vary from place to place. This is one of the good ones."}
{"text":"I just recently moved to North Carolina and was in the mood for some good Carolina BBQ. We went to Sonny's BBQ, and it was pretty ok. I ordered the brisket with the sweet rub ribs with Cole slaw and baked beans. I don't eat cole slaw, so I gave it to my boyfriend. I didn't really like the beans. They tasted like ketchup, but my boyfriend who is from the south said they had the southern kick to them. Our server, who was from Maryland also said the same thing. He said up north, we're used to a sweeter sauce for the beans, so maybe it was just me. The ribs were delicious and tender. The salad bar was excellent, but I wish they had romaine lettuce rather than iceberg, so I opted to make myself a spinach salad. The brisket was fall apart tender was well and the sweet tea was just how I liked it, sweet and ice cold. We also ordered the redneck egg rolls appetizer, but everything came out at once, even our salad bar plates. I liked the sweet bbq sauce that was on the table and I didn't care for the smoky sauce at all."}
{"text":"We must have had invisible paint on!  After the hostess sat us 3-5 waitresses went by and did not even look our way, say Hi or anything!  We left & no one saw us leave!"}
{"text":"My favorite Bbq in Florida! A must try!!! Very filling portions. I don't eat pork,and love the beef BBQ! My husband loves the pork. The fried okra is definitely a southern favorite! I always get an order of beans as the sauce is amazing. You can use the various sauces to dial up the heat or sweetness of any dish as you prefer. All the sides are terrific. It's hearty meal so go hungry!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today with my mom and sister. The green beans actually seemed to be older cooked mixed with newer not so cooked beans mixed together. My sister had issues with her ribs...I tried one bite and it was aweful, rancid. Tasted like it had been cooked the day before and left out overnight. The waitress did bring fresh ribs as we were leaving. The rest of the food was good. Service was good. There was a waitress in training...she was very friendly. Wish I could have given 5 stars bit not this time."}
{"text":"Had Sonny's for the first time & the pulled pork was really good. However,  the half chicken was a little dry.  Mac & cheese could use some work. Will definitely go back to try other menu items"}
{"text":"Service was horrible and it wasn't even busy.  The server got our order wrong and my drink went empty for 10+ mins.  Will not be back!"}
{"text":"While traveling through from Florida to Raleigh we met up with family for lunch here. It's the cleanest & best service we had ever had at any Sonny's in Florida. The restaurant itself looks more upscale than the ones I am used to in FL also. I wish all the Sonny's in FL are as nice, clean, and friendly as this one since it's originated in FL. Will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"It's Sonny's.  It's chain BBQ.  It's A-OK.  I have been coming to this Sonny's off and on for 16 years (I work close by).  Their all-you-can-eat pork special is partly responsible for me being a big fat fatty.  Some days are better than others for the fare, but the service has always been top notch.  Folks here have always been friendly and helpful.  I recently discovered their Redneck Egg Rolls.  An egg roll stuffed with pork, slaw and cheese, served with a smoky ranch.  Yes, please. Delicious.  Seriously.  The egg roll is mostly meat, which hardly ever happens.  And MUCH better than the similar item that I had at a snootier hipster place in Charlotte.  The corn nuggets have a description that makes them sound a bit iffy, but I enjoy those as well - they're different and satisfy a salty sweet craving, if you have one.    The garlic bread is good, and the corn bread is flavored well, though a bit crumbly and messy.  Mac and cheese is fine, green beans are flavored with pork (the way Jeebus intended them to be), fries are crinkle cut and standard, slaw is yummy.  I really haven't had any of the sides that I hated, but none are OHMYDOG delicious.  And for the meat.. oh, the meat... all of us girls want good meat.  It's fine.  It's not going to be the best BBQ that you have ever had.  It's good enough.  Served as ordered, in relatively good portions.    The bonus for this location is their drive thru.  You can pull up and order something easy for a quick wait, or you can call ahead for a takeout and pick it up at the drive thru."}
{"text":"Pulled pork is delicious, food has always been served hot, service is friendly and attentive!   My only complaint would be the location- the old building had lots of windows and natural light, and an open layout; this location lacks those.  Still a NC classic!"}
{"text":"I didn't love the bbq. I got the pulled pork sandwich and the meat was so tender it was almost gummy. The mac and cheese was pretty good, I'd definitely order it again. The service was great, Carol was my waitress and she was a sweetheart. I'd return again but wouldn't get the pulled pork."}
{"text":"Pretty average all the way around. Okay in a pinch but better BBQ joints abound, namely Q-Shack, Dickies and City BBQ. If you do go, don't do so without a coupon."}
{"text":"Just OK   FOOD- I had Okra, MAC & Cheese and Side salad. The okra... I had better, it was really nothing to talk about. I guess they had the okra in the to-go box too soon, because it burned a hole thru' the box and was really greasy, nothing at the bottom to soak up the grease. The Mac and cheese was OK.... again I had better. The salad was good! It was mixed lettuce with cheese, cucumber, bell peppers... really YUMMY!! If I was to go back abs get something from there it would be the side salad.   INSIDE - Parking is good and you should not have a problem with parking. I was in the to-go section and the bar. The bar have TV's. They even a basket full of the kids toys. And pig candy jar full of lollipops."}
{"text":"Average food, great service, and convenient location. Was happy to have a iced cold bottle of Cheerwine - what a treat!"}
{"text":"The chopped beef brisket is smokey and awesome. Even my  youngest asks for brisket now. The service is always good and the price is right."}
{"text":"The service is good,  the food is good also. The place is clean and prices are average. The dessert selection is slim. I would come back."}
{"text":"Obviously if you think this bbq is good, you haven't had good bbq. Ribs are tough, overpriced for their food. Staff is great but over all taste is just blehhhh. Id rather drive 45 minutes to Shelby NC. And get the real thing."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday. Service was decent but not very good at handling our complaints. We ordered two entrees, 1 turkey dinner and 1 beef brisket dinner. The turkey came out mildly warm with a pretty decent amount of meat. The brisket however, came with fairly cold, and with the meat amount for a 5 year old. I do not enjoy paying $13.99 for 5, 5-inch prices of brisket. When this was brought up to our waitress, she just said, \"Well you ordered the dinner, that's what you get.\" Not very helpful at all. I will never return to this location again. Way over priced for sub-par food."}
{"text":"I hate to write a review like this in that I know the Owner's and his Dad. As a child I was able to meet them and grew up knowing Sonny.  This location was kind of busy. Went in the door and waited for a while before one of the 20 people who worked there stopped goofing around and actually acknowledged the two groups and me and my son who had come in. Clearly this should have been an indicator of what was next.  We were seated in a dirty booth and the family next to us looked very unhappy. It took about 15 minutes for anyone to come to the table. She took our drink order and left. In the mean time she delivered cold food to the family next to us that looked unhappy.  about 10 more minutes and the people behind us who had come in with us finally met their server who was more than confused. We still had not gotten any drinks and not placed an order. The waitress came back to the table and asked about our drink order again. I gave her five minutes. When she came back and had nothing I gave up.   I grabbed the manager on the way out and he looked like a deer in the headlights. He knew he had issues, bad people and a huge problem. He was working in the kitchen when they got him and when a manager is in the kitchen it's bad news.  While the front of the house was a wreck his employees where goofing off, wandering around and most of them not doing anything to help the others out. This was clearly a case of bad hiring and could be fixed but that was a pure waste of 30 - 40 minutes."}
{"text":"The ratings on this place is pretty accurate, on a scale from 1 to 10 I'd give it a 7. There Mac n cheese is very good, there baked beans were average.  Mckoys BBQ is one exit from the fwy so out of the two I'd go with \"Mckoys\"."}
{"text":"This was not a good experience. I placed a takeout order and I got the ribs and smoked wings. I should have known something was up when I got my food in three minutes. I'm all about fast service, but if the food is going to be bad, id rather them take there time. First off, DO NOT order the ribs here. These ribs were the sorriest ribs I've ever had. They barely had any meat on them. And the meat was crunchy, I couldn't tell what part was the meat and what was the bone. The smoked wings were only okay, but nothing to bang home about. I got baked beans and potato salad with cornbread as sides and these were only okay as well. Nothing stood out and I paid $14 for everything. I would not recommend what I got at all. Maybe the other food is better but if you come here DO NOT get the ribs.  I would have rated this a two but the ribs were that bad I had to drop it to a 1."}
{"text":"I consider myself a lifelong connoisseur of Sonny's & this one took me back to the 1980's when the BBQ was real pit, and the service was fast & friendly. I've only been here once, & I don't know if it's always this good, but whoever the pit master was that night knows how to perfectly smoke & slice a pork collar. It was so good that I brought 3lbs home with me, since I can't get proper mouth watering bbq in Raleigh. I will return!"}
{"text":"I don't know why people are hating on Sonny's.    Don't go into it expecting a super classy meal or anything high end.  I think of Sonny's as the TGIFridays or Applebees of BBQ, meaning that it's consistent, tasty, and suited for every palate.  But that doesn't mean it's horrible.  My typical order is the pulled pork sandwich on Texas toast.  It's delicious slathered in their sweet sauce.    I've never had cold food or bad service at this location and I know I'll be back the next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Some of the best ribs here ever. A must stop spot if you are Big BBQ Guy like myself-slaw was good also baked beans are nice and delicious. There BBQ sauce is yummmy and tangy. Nice balance with vinegar and tomato sauce taste, parents had chicken they lived it, next time I will try Mac and cheese"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been to any Sonny's. It was the first place that I had \"BBQ\" and not grilled food. I'm a Yankee by the way. And it was good. Now over the years I've had better but Sonny's was always good. It was good tonight also. I think. Portion size was a joke. My brother had ribs, 5 small riblets I'd say. My sister-in-law had half a small chicken. And I had the brisket. If I'm going to pay what they charge I want more then what may have been less then a 1/4 lb. Really?  I understand  costs and profit. There are many other places I can get good BBQ for similar cost and fill full walking out. They 3stars because it tasted good, still. I think."}
{"text":"im a carolina bbq fan.  and sorry..but this bbq is just no that good.  its fast food bbq.  why not do real bbq sonny?  i dont want mcribs from a carolina bbq place"}
{"text":"We ate here after church on Sunday last week as a large group.  The food was fast and good, except for the one who order a hamburger thought it was over cooked.  The service was great and pleasant."}
{"text":"2 stars because I'm NOT a fan (3 stars) and I've had better  This Sonny's is at an Interstate exit just south of Charlotte. It was incredibly dirty and almost everything in the salad bar was decimated. The sneeze guard needed a serious cleaning and I think the floor hadn't been swept in a week. The men's restroom was the type of restroom that you wanna get in and get out of as fast as possible without even touching the faucets. The specials menu offers your choice of ribs with two sides for $9.99 and I chose the baby back. The meat wasn't plentiful but it did fall off of the bone. Also, I would recommend the baked beans as a side. They were pretty good with chunks of pork mixed in and a decent sauce. I would say the beans stopped me from having a 1 star experience. As a side note, I did get a stomach ache within 30 mins of leaving this place but maybe it was just a coincidence. Good luck !"}
{"text":"True, Sonny's is a chain and that hurts its standing as a BBQ joint. Still though, the food is pretty good.   It's pretty easy to call in takeout or order once you're there. There is a separate takeout area you go to in the restaurant. My friend and I only had to wait a few minutes for our food. I ordered BBQ chicken and she got pulled pork. Both meals - complete with two sides and cornbread - were so large that they fed us for days.   Here's a tip: The best Carolina BBQ can be found at church luncheons. Charlotte churches often have small festivals where you can get a plate of pulled pork, beans, slaw, etc., for $8 or $10. Try to save room if you can. They'll also be selling sweet potato pie and other Southern desserts."}
{"text":"Better than expected. Many salad bar items, excellent corn bread. BF cleared his plate, I did too. Nothing fancy but good food! Staff very attentive."}
{"text":"Good barbecue, the place has slot of different options I got the sampler, which had ribs, brisket and chicken, chicken was the best, I didn't try any of the sauces there was already an ample smoke not if sauce on everything,the staff was very nice and courteous, the potions are rather large be warned!"}
{"text":"My visit a two months back wasn't great. My order was incorrect two times in a row, the food was lukewarm, and service wasn't anything to write home about.   I've since returned to this location and had a much better experience than before. My order was correct, very hot, and the waitress was absolutely fantastic. I hope I have the same experience during my future visits!"}
{"text":"Awesome Brisket Mac! Please lose the tip option on receipt at the drive-through. I reserve tips for wait staff sitting down in a restaurant."}
{"text":"We are in the city for the weekend. I liked their fast take out options. Service is very friendly. Last night we ordered baby back ribs - I was not very impressed (hence one star off), they were burned and didn't come close to the great tender TGIFs baby back ribs. Today, we ordered beef brisket and chicken BBQ - both were great. May repeat that selection again but will stick with TGIF for ribs."}
{"text":"Far from professional. Very much a boys club and would never return after the way the have chose to represent employee conduct."}
{"text":"There is a list of restaurants I always try to visit when I return to Charlotte. Sonny's is in the top 5. The ribs are cooked to smoke ring perfection. The service is always friendly and efficient. Some times they offer an all you can eat special. Those are the time I leave with a full belly and a pile of bones on the table. OUTSTANDING!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been to a Sonny's in about 10 years. Now I am reminded why. The food was cold. It isn't difficult to keep food warm. Throw it in a microwave! I wouldn't know the difference! Also the pulled pork was very greasy. Almost waxy. I'm sure the waxy parts could be attributed to temperature (cold!).  The salad bar has decent, sometimes odd, options, but there were things like egg salad dropped into cottage cheese and some pink marshmallow fluff? Not really appetizing.  Don't get the cornbread. It was a cold, gross tasting brick that was raw in the middle.  The fried okra appetizer is the size of a single side serving.  Anyway. The service was spotty. We asked for refills and they brought us the wrong drinks in to-go cups. No one seemed to notice the obviousness of our dissatisfaction. Full plates, yet signing the check.......  Our server was nice enough but it was just not worth spending money on ever again."}

{"text":"Really crappy management that lets people get sexually harassed and then fires them for reporting it. Don't eat here!!!"}
{"text":"I had the smoking gun sandwich. Red onions disagree with me so i had it without. Beans are nothing to write home about. But the meats themselves are quite good. What makes this place worth visiting is their sauces. Four are on every tables and some combination of them is sure to please even a picky eater.  Also had the redneck spring roll. Might be wrong on the name there but is was brisket inside a fried roll cut at an angle. It was amazing.  The sweet tea was good, but I could pass on it after the first glass. Not bad, just not achingly sweet like I prefer. That way the ice doesn't dilute it as much.  All in all I would eat there again. Wait staff was friendly and my server was very nice."}
{"text":"Love Sonny's but not when roaches are crawling on the table! I have a photo but not sure how to upload. Decided to go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Talking straight food... I love the pork BBQ, cole slaw has a weird taste, my baked sweet potato last time was burned, they shouldn't have served it, baked beans are good, fries ok, cornbread is really not cornbready at all, but good taste, garlic bread was kinda soggy. We did take-out and they totally forgot one of our sides!!! I'm not driving back to get it either cause it was another cole slaw and it's not even that good. But I will call to let them know they should double check their orders!  Overpriced for the overall quality of food, but I like their pork BBQ, and I may go back for just that, but wouldn't really recommend someone eat there."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to eat some lunch at Sonny's in Concord.  That was a big mistake!  We asked the waitress what was on the $5.99 lunch special plate and she said you get two pieces of chicken, white or dark, french fries, slaw and garlic bread.  She or you can have any meat of your choice.  We chose the white meat chicken.  When our meal came there was a small wing and half of a chicken breast! You could see where the breast was cut in half.  She tried to tell us that sometimes the pieces are small.  I told her don't even go there.  I know the difference from a small piece of chicken and one that has been cut in half.  I have cooked chicken all my life and I know what I am talking about!  They refused to make it good and we will never ever go there again because they are cheating the customers and we did not get what we paid for!!!!  They really do not even deserve one star!!!!! bev christenbury"}
{"text":"5 star experience all the way. Food and service were impeccable. Food was delicious, wait staff was very friendly and accommodating too! Sliced pork place with fries and cornbread was good too. Very good, very good value for the price and a convienent location at that too! Thank you. :-)"}
{"text":"I order the pulled pork sandwich, I have always loved Sonny's BBQ will eat this over Jim's and Nicks BBQ any day. I'm from the deep south and this is pretty much how we do our BBQ not the NC vinegar way. The customer was great the waitress was welcoming and super nice."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular. Ribs are okay. Side dishes are horrible. Onion rings are the best thing on the menu. Take out orders are more wrong than right."}
{"text":"I love BBQ but if this is how you treat your your female with workers I won't eat. http://www.rawstory.com/2016/01/north-carolina-waitress-fired-after-telling-bosses-about-managers-sexual-harassment/"}
{"text":"Good food.  Pulled pork sandwich was huge.  Sonny's sampler was to much to eat. But the brownie,  out of this world."}
{"text":"I have been frequenting this particular Sonnys(Tyvola Rd.) for almost 20yrs. I always receive nice, courteous service and employees w/good attitudes. I visited today(4/14/16) and ordered 1lb brisket, 1 1/2 lb smoked turkey and 10 smoked wings promotion for $7.99. Everything was ready when I arrived and taste is excellent all items! FRESH!!!! I missed the african american lady with braids that is always in carryout. I hope she's just off or on vacation! She's very pleasant & never hesitates to open every box for show to ensure all of ur items are present."}
{"text":"Terrible and slow service. Food was nothing special and neither were their BBQ sauces. The only reason I'm not giving one star is that they do have a good salad bar. But it definitely took at least 15 minutes just to get a sweet tea."}
{"text":"I don't care if this is chain. Possible being from Illinois I don't know better. Regardless, the three way pork plate with chopped and pulled plus three perfect meaty pork ribs with an admirable smoke ring and exceptional fall off the bone flavor was very, very good. I would go here any time And the smoky BBQ sauce, I could bathe in it."}
{"text":"Don't go to this place. There are a ton of barbecue places in the Charlotte area that are great, but this is not even remotely close to it. They use cheap ingredients and the food tastes terrible. The service was atrocious and I believe I would have been better off served by the vermin living there instead. Please take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good place to get cheap, tasty barbeque, Sonny's is really decent option.  If you're in the mood to try their different meats, the Super Combo is really the way to go.  For around $14, you can get their brisket, pork, chicken and ribs.  The brisket was really just so-so (about 2.5/5), the pulled pork was pretty good (3.5/5), but the ribs (very meaty and tender) and chicken (moist and smoky) were really good (4/5).  I also tried some of the sliced pork, which was really good too - I recommend that over the pulled pork.  If you're in the mood to pig out, they had some decently cheap all-you-can-eat (AYCE) specials.  You can even get AYCE ribs for less than $20. They offer discounts on the AYCE depending on what night you go there (I think Tuesdays they discount the ribs).  Their side items aren't bad either.  I love that offer corn on the cob as a side, and the corn wasn't too bad (although it was a little more mushy, like frozen corn on the cob).  Their macaroni and cheese is ok - very cheesy!  Truly, though, their cornbread is where it's at!  It is tender, moist, and mildly sweet - so delish!  If you're in the mood for a salad, they offer a decent salad bar here as well.  Our waiter was really friendly and helpful, and all the staff working there was really nice to us.  Our food came out super fast, which is always fabulous.  The decor was pretty typical for a chain restaurant.  They also offer a drive thru when you come to pick up carry-out, which is probably very helpful if you're wanting food on-the-go.  Cheap prices and several good food options are good reasons to visit a restaurant again."}
{"text":"I had the pulled pork fries 3 $2 sliders and 2 $2 sliders yesterday. It was all great. I wish national pulled pork day happened six times a month."}
{"text":"I ordered the all you can eat rib special they have going on. The ribs were delicious. I also got 2 sides. The baked beans and Mac and cheese were great. even a piece of garlic toast. The sides are all you can eat but if you've read my previous posts I'm not taking up valuable meat space in my belly for a few beans I'm going to fast as it is. They have all you can eat specials that are weekly as well. Chicken ribs and pork are on there. I'll be back to see what the red neck egg rolls are like."}
{"text":"I ordered the Sonny's Sampler, and omg. I had absolutely no complaints. Such delicious food with tons of flavor! Pulled pork is by far my favorite! Going back tonight for dessert!"}
{"text":"Over the years my family has enjoyed Sonnys but our last few times have been progressively getting worse. My family and I have been waiting for almost 30 minutes for food. We got the salad bar and if the many employees working here they cannot manage to keep the salad bar stocked. Instead they stand in groups having conversations by the hostess stand or the bar. For what you pay for food here you expect the service to be decent and food to come out in a timely manner. In my experience the food has come out cold in the past."}
{"text":"I had the all you can eat deal. For $10.99. It was a great deal. I just don't know if they are making money off such a great deal. But they've been in business for a while so I am assuming their making it work.   They have all you can at themes for every night of the week so it's a little different each night.   I will definitely keep going back as long as they have the all you can eat option"}
{"text":"Holy Moly Freeholy (if I spelled that correctly) The food here is great!! My Fiance suggested we grab dinner here....To-Go order. I placed our order around 8:50PM, to my surprise everything was ready within 5mins. Our food was piping HOT! I am very impressed with their website, prices are listed...easy to navigate. We both had the Pulled Pork Plated dinner, which rocked my socks! the Mac and Cheese is Meh....not the best. However their Cole slaw and corn muffins are perfection."}
{"text":"I got the boss sandwich which is brisket Mac and cheese and onions rings on a sandwich. Bread was pillowy soft and buttered, meat was flavorful and onions rings and Mac and cheese made this sandwich very good by itself. The fries are run of the mill crinkle cut, I didn't like some of their sauces but the sizzlin sweet is hard to stop eating. I had a bad feeling when I saw the salad bar. To me, a salad bar usually means it's targeted to seniors: people who choose where to eat based on everything except the taste of the food. Fortunately they had something for me to eat that I loved."}
{"text":"Very good service. Food was good but not great. Had their Carolina Sweet barbecue sandwich and fries. Their fries were delicious and sandwich was good. Did expect better from a barbecue restaurant. If you are looking for a decent place to eat after a race, this would be a good place to keep in mind."}
{"text":"My favorite BBQ restaurant!! I love their BBQ chicken with fried okra and sweet sauce! My husband loves their Beef Ribs & Brisket! The customer service is on point Greyson was our server."}
{"text":"Went through the drive thru last night, extremely slow but the food was worth it. My husband and I both got the chopped brisket sandwich combo. It was delish! Would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"I love some BBQ, but Sonny's just doesn't cut it for me. First of all, this place is a franchise so that's automatically blasphemy in the BBQ world. I love some hometown BBQ & going into a place a franchised BBQ place just isn't on my list of favorite things to do.  Their BBQ is good & you can order family style, so everything here is not so bad. But there are plenty of other better, hometown BBQ joints close by in Charlotte. Sonny's doesn't have anything that's spectacular, but you'll leave full & satisfied.  But for my money, I'd rather get some better BBQ, at a better price, from a hometown place. If you don't mind the franchise feel added into your BBQ eating experience, then you won't mind heading to Sonny's to get filled up. But for me, you'll enjoy your BBQ much better from a local place with local recipes."}
{"text":"Meh.  Typical chain Sonny's.  BBQ is OK, but nothing special."}
{"text":"I drove past this place on almost a daily basis for a couple years. Boyfriend and I were looking for cheap and nearby food, unfortunately that is about all we found.   We were pleasantly surprised when we walked in because the hostess happily and genuinely enthusiastically greeted us. However, when she tried to seat us at 5:52 a server in the empty section she was trying to seat us in curtly informed her she was not on until 6:00. After a little backtracking and scrambling the polite hostess was able to find a seat for us.   The boyfriend ordered the Sonny's Sampler and I ordered the brisket and then we waited, and waited. We watched as other people (who arrived after us) received their food and then waited some more. When our food finally arrived it was a disappointment. My brisket was completely dry, as was the cornbread. I tried everything on the sample platter and again everything was exceedingly dry, except for the ribs. The ribs were actually great and we might return to have them for the all you can eat special. However we tried a variety of options and the ribs were the only tasty bit of the meal.   The price was fair, the establishment was clean and some of the sauces were tasty but we wouldn't return for anything except to try the ribs again."}
{"text":"I had a rib lunch combo here with mac and cheese, and some other forgotten side. The ribs I ordered were the sweet and smokey ones, and I was surprised, because they were a little dry on the outside. A squirt of some hot BBQ sauce however brought them to life! While not perfect, I think they came through as a solid representation of Carolina ribs. I'd  come again and next time I'll order the baby back ribs which I gather are super tender. The sweet tea is good here as well. However the true breakout star was to my surprise, the mac and cheese! Slightly browned on top, al dente pasta, extremely cheesy without being salty and just perfection. I'd put it up against home made, it was that good."}
{"text":"I'd heard good things about Sonny's, but they don't extend up into Virginia, so I was excited to have the chance to try it out when I was in Charlotte recently.  It certainly lived up to the hype.  It's hard to say if it's the best I've had, because every good barbecue place is good in different ways, but  it's up there, especially for a chain.   If anyone from Sonny's reads this, come open a spot in Richmond."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about my experience here. Plenty to choose from on the menu. Great helpful staff, even the ones not working my table were friendly and helpful. Brisket was very good as were the sides ( sweet potato, cole slaw). Also is less common to keep sauces at the table. A big plus for Sonny's. Will not complain next time I get sent to Charlotte."}
{"text":"Franchise chain BBQ Food was OK at best, as expected for a chain Waitress was terrible, never asked how I would like my ribs, then we she walked by a minute later, I asked for dry rubbed ribs and I got the worst body language and look imaginable.  Place was not busy and I got the young waitress, older gal waitressing others was very outgoing and seemed to be working very hard.  Mark one up to the younger generation not wanting to work!"}
{"text":"Small portions. Stale fries. Slow service.  Move along people. Nothing good to see here.  Definitely a management problem here.   No where near worth the price."}
{"text":"We love this place. Great value for the food you are given. I always get my BBQ fix when I come here. Also servers are very pleasant."}
{"text":"Oh my! Sonny's was so good that I didn't have time to post a photo. I ate it too fast! Lol! I had the lunch special which was a pulled pork sandwich. I got a generous portion of pulled pork with fries, two big pieces of garlic bread and coleslaw for $6.99. Again, this was a daily special. I also got a sweet tea. Boy was it sweet! The pulled pork was so moist, tender and delicious! I also enjoyed the different types of BBQ sauces they offered. They even had little to-go packs of various types of sauces. Awesome! The ladies who assisted us were fantastic! I love receiving southern hospitality :) Way to go Sonny's! I'll be back :)"}
{"text":"GROSS. My fiance told me it was so-so but the place I wanted to go to was already closed (Sunday night). I should have listened. The beef \"brisket\" was a flavorless pot roast and tasted like it had been cooked in a crock pot or boiled. Seriously. The mac & cheese had no flavor and tasted like hospital food. Golden Corral's version is better and I am NOT a fan of them at all. The cornbread had a good flavor but was too heavy and undercooked. The dry rubbed wings were fried The outside was crispy and flavor was decent but they were EXTREMELY fatty and that grossed me out. The only good thing was our soda from the fountain. Don't waste your money here. Go to Mac's Speedshop (LOVE THEM) Their wings are to die for!!"}
{"text":"I have a confession to make and it won't be pretty... Ok, are you ready? Sigh... My name is Beth F. and I have a problem... but they say the first step to fixing that problem is to admit it right?? Well forget that, I don't want to help this problem!! I think I could literally drink Sonny's sweet bbq sauce.  It is so freaking amazing I think we could start a world peace movement with that sweet creamy deliciousness. I would say to give me a few buckets of it, to start the movement, but I think my will power would cave and I'd end up consuming it all before I could even get it to the places it needed to go.  The service at this location has always been fantastic and fast, and my God, it goes without saying that their bbq is the best I've ever had. My only complaint about Sonny's is that it's not walking distance to my house. We had one nearby that closed I guess, and so I'm just bummed and it's making me whiney. :P  They have a salad bar, but let's be honest... who eats the salad bar when the BBQ plates are so filling... NOM... If you're hungry NOW, and want something that you will most likely have leftovers from, this is your place."}
{"text":"This place is not anything extraordinary. It's right next to Great Wolf lodge, so we thought we'd give it a try. Service was mediocre and food average. But the \"redneck egg rolls\" were amazing, and we liked that kids eat free on Mondays. Probably would not go here again but the egg rolls made it worth it."}
{"text":"Save your money. Hands down the worst BBQ and food for that matter in Concord. Jim and Nicks is right across the street. Do yourself a favor and go there. One bite of the sandwich and I was done. Pasta salad was hard. Just go across the street.  You are welcome."}
{"text":"When I am at this location, I frequent the drive thru.  They are always fast and friendly.    I ordered the pulled pork, baked potato and a sweet potato.  All of the items were hot and fresh.  The pulled pork was moist and the sweet BBQ topped it off.    This location is always clean.   If you go inside, the all you can eat salad bar is well worth a try."}
{"text":"Consistently good food, especially the DRY RUB ribs.  Staff always working hard.  Service good.  Blue collar, working people type of place.  Tea is \"Pixie Stick sweet.\"  Ask a Southerner, they'll know what you're talking about."}
{"text":"I'm afraid I did not have the typical experience at Sonny's, compared to the other reviews. The cornbread was the best part of the meal. My pulled pork BBQ plate was full of fat - not marbeling. The baked beans tasted *only* of catchup and the coleslaw had no flavor whatsoever. I ate about half the meal and decided it just wasn't worth it! Disappointed but am hopeful it was an off day or an off meal."}
{"text":"I just had the bbq pulled pork sandwich because I'm trying to stop eating fried chicken.  I ordered the bbq pulled pork sandwich and it was pretty good. Actually it's better than Mac's Speed shop which now I find highly overrated.  The pork was moist, I liked the hot and spicy bbq sauce that came with it.  Not impressed with the bread or bun but I guess it does it's job of holding it all together."}
{"text":"Consistent!  I like Sonny's because they are consistent. Often times the taste and texture of ribs will differ at the same restaurant but not at Sonny's. They have a great formula and follow it every time. The chicken wings are also a favorite of mine. It isn't easy to bbq wings but again Sonny's has it down to a science.   The price is right at Sonny's too. They don't overcharge for the amount of food they provide. Usually I order the Little Smokies and Wing dinner however this time I ordered the anniversary special: Rib dinner for $6.99. It came with two sides and bread (I always choose the Texas toast.)  Now we come to why Sonny's did not get that last start. It comes down to two reasons: 1. More actual vegetables for sides. Maybe a cabbage, squash, creamed spinach. If not on the permanent menu then as a weekly special.  2. The salad bar is unappealing because it is not well attended to. The salad options are great but it's always messy. Generally many items have been picked over and/or are gone. I would love to have a salad with my ribs and chicken."}
{"text":"So I need to ask you something, Charlotte Yelpers.    Forgive me because I am from out of town, and I respect you all.  But I know how serious you all take your barbecue.  During my recent trip there, I had co-workers who took me to Mac's Speed Shop for what they told me was authentic Carolina barbecue.  I loved it.  I noticed that Mac's has 3 1/2 stars currently on Yelp, same as this place.    Charllotte Yelpers, how can you tell me that this place is anywhere near as good as Mac's?    You see, I had one day to myself to get lunch.  I decided to trust the Yelp app to find me another barbecue place.  I saw this place was near me, and having never heard of it before being from Philadelphia, I assumed this would be another authentic place.  And even though it had less reviews, I thought since it had the same level of stars as Mac's, I'd get some good barbecue that was at least as close as what they serve there.   It was about 5 minutes into sitting down here when I realized that I was sitting in the south's version of Famous Dave's.    Don't get me wrong.  I enjoyed the combo that I had.  It wasn't bad at all.  But come on.  If you want authentic barbecue, you don't come here.  I felt slightly let down.    Now that I've had my \"What the hell are you thinking Charlotte\" rant, I'll say that for a chain restaurant, the food was pretty tasty, the service was very good, and I'd eat here again if I ever had the chance.  Both the pulled pork and the chicken were decent if not spectacular.   Well, maybe I won't eat here again if I'm in the area with Mac's not too far away.  But it was good enough if not the greatest."}
{"text":"Love this place! I have been to other locations but this one was truly the best! Great service and great food! Such quick delivery and responsiveness of my waitress, Sharon. She was hands down the best waitress that I have ever had at any restaurant. Will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"How dies this place have 3,5 stars.   I don't know where to start.  Food isn't even Sonny's quality,    No liquor here, beer only the owner doesn't want wine because he is a christian.   Really.   God turned water into wine     Well i will never be back.   Sonny's corporation would be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is my go to place when in Charlotte I have been going here for years and they have only gotten better as times goes by. I always have the sampler plate and everything on it is top notch. Another thing I like about it is consistently great service and fair prices for 20 bucks I can get a great dinner and service. Keep up the good work sonny's"}
{"text":"The best bbq in the world, I'm pretty sure. A great menu and very friendly staff. The cornbread alone will change your life! I would definitely recommend Sonny's to everyone!"}
{"text":"Hey, it's Sonny's! The wife and I stopped in for a quick bite before catching a movie last week. The service was super fast and friendly. I ordered the pulled pork platter w/ mac n cheese, slaw and garlic bread. The mac n cheese was good, not great. Same with the slaw. The pulled pork was average. It definitely needs some sauce. I do like Sonny's' sauces, especially the Sizzling Sweet. Now, the garlic bread, to me, is still the star of the dish. Take that for what it's worth."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch on the way to the aquarium with the kids. The waitress was great and was patient with my kids and answered all out questions about the menu.   I settled on the Pitmaster Burger. Talk about meat on meat on meat on meat. This thing had a burger patty (not a bad one) topped with bacon, sausage and bbq pork with some kinda cheese and french fried onions. My inner fat girl was in heaven! Ordered the baked sweet potato and was a little sad that the cinnamon butter that comes with it was prepackaged country crock spread. Oh well. It was still de-mother-freaking-licious!   I'll definitely be back when i'm in town."}
{"text":"My wife got take out for me. She ordered the sliced pork dinner, but I received just enough pork for an average sandwich. Also the pro was wet and greasy. The beans, again, were sub-par."}
{"text":"Once again, Sonny's hits the mark. My wife and I had the sliced pork with salad bar. The food was belly-stuffing great! Will come back 'till my car dies...then I'll walk!"}
{"text":"Got to have that sliced pork and the wonderful salad bar:-) love me some sonnys"}
{"text":"I'm from Texas, and my friends here in Charlotte wanted me to try some BBQ (even if it was a chain). When we got there they weren't able to find a spot for our party of 6 (and a baby), so the host sat us at different booths.  Before we could even order or sit down, the manager came right away and sat us at a round table that fit us all. They were very nice to us and were apologetic.  I could tell they wanted to give us quality service.  Our server was Josh, and he was very professional and kind.  He got to us right away and took our drink orders.  He didn't make us feel rushed to order right away and even interacted with us being from Texas.  So customer service here from my experience is a 5 star rating!   The bbq- I like the menu options.  I ordered the sweet and smokey ribs with mac and cheese, coleslaw, and garlic bread.  The ribs were good for this being a chain bbq place.  I wouldn't say they were moist, but they weren't chewy either. They were just simple and good. The mac and cheese was very creamy in texture and cheesy. I like their coleslaw, it wasn't over tart. Garlic bread reminded me of Texas toast, so that was a plus for me! Overall I'd give quality do the food a 4/5. But mainly because I've had legit southern BBQ and it is more rich in flavor and soft in texture."}
{"text":"I ate at Sonny's the first weekend I was here in Charlotte, but never got around to writing a review.  Sonny's BBQ is a chain, but they do a pretty good job.  I had the super combo which has  sliced Pork, Beef, Chicken, and Ribs.  The pork was moist and tender, but could have been cooked a little longer.  The beef was pretty good as well, tender and moist.  The chicken was good with a smoky flavor.  The ribs were OK too, tender and coming off the bone cleanly.  My dinner came out with Texas toast and I asked the waitress for cornbread instead which she brought to me promptly.  The atmosphere was OK and the service was great.  As far as Sonny's being a chain, well that is not a sin in my book as long as the food is OK.  Sonny's serves solid, but not inspired, BBQ.  Will I be back, probably not since there are plenty of other BBQ places to try."}
{"text":"Had a delicious meal here with husband and daughter.   We were seated quickly and our server, Kyona, was attentive, efficient,  and very friendly.     All three of us had the pulled pork lunch special.   I love it that they serve lunch specials until 4 daily.   So many restaurants only do 11-2 and/or only weekdays.   Their cornbread is SO yummy.   Among us,  we had a wide variety of sides:  baked potato,  corn on the cob,  macaroni and cheese,  cole slaw,  and baked sweet potato--and all of them were great!   The pulled pork was extremely lean,  and I love their selection of BBQ sauces.   Will definitely eat here again when visiting daughter."}
{"text":"I haven't been since I was a child so today I ventured over here and what a great decision it was. I sat down and Richie came over to serve me. Very friendly. I ordered an appetizer, the Redneck Egg Rolls. They were fantastic! Richie said he eats them every other day, I believe it because they are great! I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese. Everything was perfect. I will return for sure"}
{"text":"Great service & good BBQ. The waitress we had was very pleasant. It would be probably nicer to sit outside here...the inside is very dim and it just needs a facelift. There's seating right by bathrooms and it's kinda dark back there and not attractive. Would definitely return for lunch or get some BBQ to go!"}
{"text":"This is a quaint little place. Well, maybe it's not really little, but I really got the feeling that it is a Mom & Pop, one-of-a-kind place. (If it isn't, well good for them, because it seems like it is. I'm not from Charlotte, so I wouldn't know about the kind of chains in the area.)  I was there for lunch, and as such, ordered off of the Lunch menu. For what I paid, I got so much food. I of course ordered the brisket, you can't go to a place like this, and not get the brisket!! And let me tell you, it was great. There were a number of BBQ sauces available to try. There was one listed as hot (or something along those lines - don't quite remember), but it did not taste as hot as the other one labeled some sort of less hot than that one (Geez, I hope that sentence made sense.) The supposedly hotter one, just had a taped on lablel saying that it was hotter. Quite peculiar, but both sauce options were still good nonetheless.  The service was a little slower than my liking, but I'm not completely upset about that. The server was friendly to us."}
{"text":"This is my favorite barbecue place in all of Charlotte. I've never dined in before but have ordered this through UberEats countless of times when I need a barbecue craving wolves but just don't want to get out my room.   The barbecue is just PHENOMENAL, along with their sides, it's just really tough to beat. Their cornbread is the right consistency of fluffy that I could just eat hella of it in one sitting.   Their potato salad is always good but I've only had better at my husband's cookouts when they decide to pull out the homemade batch. Their baked beans are also an awesome side for barbecue and I don't know, I'm just so in love with this place regarding comfort food.   Do not sleep on this place y'all."}
{"text":"We have never eaten at Sonny's before but came in and ordered take out sliced brisket and baby back ribs.   They were excellent.  The lady who took the order was very nice even though she had not worked at this particular store before.  My irritation with this restaurant is they had signs everywhere they were  \"introducing\" their new fried pickles of which I am a huge fan of and I ordered one serving for $4.99 to go.  When I got home, there was not even ONE pickles worth of slices and it was a very small pickle.  They were tasteless and the little coating was practically raw cornmeal that had slid off the pickle.  Instead of putting it in a take out box with holes to let out the steam, it was in a piece of like waxed paper and twisted shut.  Pickles are normally served with something like ranch dressing.  Not BBQ sauce. YUCK!  If you are promoting something you better KNOW HOW TO COOK IT!  Fried pickles should be golden BROWN and the cornmeal should have some salt and paprika or cayenne pepper.  I will never order these again.  Doesn't anyone ever taste the damn food they are \"promoting\"? What a shame."}
{"text":"It might be part of a franchise, but I prefer to rate the place based on the food. While I have had better, this place is good!  Walking in for a late dinner at 9:00 tonight, we were warmly greeted and seated immediately. The waiter must be new, because he's a character. Lots of smiles and humor as he took care of us. Almost too much!  I went with the all-you-can-eat ribs ($10.99) and they were fall-off-the-bone. Nicely cooked, my first plate had four of them. Very meaty, though perhaps not as hot (temperature-wise) as I expect. I decided to have a second plate, which had three large ribs. These were just as good and were served at the right temperature. The cole slaw seemed processed and the mac & cheese was only barely warm, but the cornbread was fresh and delicious.  My eating partner had the all-you-can-eat chicken ($7.99) with a baked sweet potato and baked beans. The potato was rather small and the beans had a lot of bbq sauce mixed through. (Other available sides are green beans, baked potato, fries, and others I can't remember.)  The ribs and chicken are only barely sauced. Instead at the table are four squeeze bottles of sauces - mild, smoky, smoky sweet and spicy. They're all good, but I prefer a mustard bbq sauce.  All of the sides are also included with the all-you-can-eat as are the drinks. They have a very delicious sweet tea, fountain coke products and Bud/Bud Light on tap.  We skipped dessert, but did bring some bbq shredded pork home, which looks great. They put in two tubs of cole slaw and good sized packets of each of the sauces."}
{"text":"I went here with my mom a few days ago. We came in I ordered some ribs with Mac and cheese and corn on cob. The fork I received wasn't clean so me and mom had to ask for plastic forks. And the waitress I had want too good. She assisted my mom with finding something on the menu and while she was holding it up she was kinda smacking my face with it. I even looked her to kind of give her the look like ummm I'm right here. But she looked at me and continued to like have the menu in my face she didn't even apologize for it. I thought that was kind of rude. The ribs were AMAZING!! They were the only thing that was good the Cornbread was cold.  Mac and cheese tasted like Kraft Mac n cheese I can cook in microwave by myself in 2mins .   I would come back here only for the ribs!! Definitely not for the service I got and especially not for the cold cornbread (tasted like frozen cornbread that wasn't reheated all the way)  I received."}
{"text":"The food here is always top quality! They have one of the best salad bars with the freshest ingredients.  Their Ice-T is the best EVER!!!! The waitstaff is very pleasant and kind as well it's very attentive. The only drawback I saw was one of the bathroom stalls really needs attention!  There is something seriously wrong with the plumbing on One of the toilets. Otherwise, the bathroom is very clean as well as the restaurant."}
{"text":"I  stopped by this place simply to buy coleslaw but when I saw on the menu that they had egg rolls I had to give them a try. They were really good. Im not really into ordering bbq when I can fire up my own grill and go to work but from the looks of things this place knows what they are doing they are definitely worth trying,"}
{"text":"I got the sampler and they both got the lunch portion dry rub ribs.   Service was great!! Restaurant was clean-ish.   The macaroni and cheese was disgusting!!   Coleslaw was okay. Brisket was dry, chicken was dry, the dry rub ribs were pretty good. Cornbread was good.   I wouldn't really go here again. I don't think.  The salad bar looked decent, should've went with salad and a brownie lol."}
{"text":"Came with the family of 5 for lunch on Sunday. All of the food was good. I had the dry rub ribs and was probably the one item I would less likely try again. The ribs were cooked to perfection but the rub lacked flavor. I had the homemade beans and  Mac and cheese, both were delicious! My daughter had the wet ribs and only shared a single bite (don't blame her a bit). They were also done to perfection and the sauce had more flavor. Wife had the pulled pork and was impressed. She grew up near Lexington, NC so she knows her BBQ. I was also allowed only a single bite and was also very impressed. They offer several sauces at the table and each had a very unique flavor. Service was good, glassed stayed full and bill came at the correct time. I found that the amt was kinda high for all lunch entree's when 2 of the meals were kids meals. The total without tip was $48.00. Worth a try and I will return when in the area."}
{"text":"If you love sexual harassment and like to support serial predators, come on down to Sonny's where they make an entire culture of it!    Ooops, I said this was good for groups below but meant to say this place was good for gropes!"}
{"text":"My sister used to work there a while back but that isn't why I'm reviewing every time I go there the food and drinks are excellent great service even when my sister wasn't on the clock. I will highly recommend to others."}
{"text":"I was sad to see that the Good Ol' Days Cafe/Diner had closed... Not that I went there daily, but it had been an Arboretum staple for me ever since I moved to Charlotte way back in the day.   Pleasantly surprised that in its place was a Sonny's.  Yes, it's a chain that spans over a couple states, but I've never really had any issue with the fact - I know some BBQ purists are rolling over in their graves as I type this review, but there is a reason why there are so many Sonny's locations.  Don't come here semi-hungry!  There is a lot of food to be eaten at this place.  I opted for the special (on a Tuesday night) for the all you can eat ribs.  The first batch were a little tough, but the 2nd batch fell right off the bone.  There are a plethora of sides (or on the menu:  \"Side-kicks\") to choose from, I went with the corn on the cob and the mac and cheese.  Needless-to-say... my fingers and mouth area were totally covered in sauces by the time I was done.  Since this location is brand-spanking new, the dining area is super clean and the tables are very shiny.  It was like a high end country saloon with a nice bar in the middle of it.  Because of the shape of the space, there are other little dining room nooks where tables were, but we opted for the high top near the bar.  Would I go out of my way to go to this restaurant?  Maybe not, but it's a good option whenever I am in the area."}
{"text":"Came here and got my ass grabbed. Do not recommend. Much better BBQ in town.. So go thee instead. Unless you're into that kind of thing.."}
{"text":"Great BBQ. This is not your carolina style, vinegar based BBQ. This is more like Florida que where you drown your meat with thick BBQ sauce. They have an all you can eat pulled pork special everyday for $12.99. Whatever you come for I'm sure you'll be pleased."}
