{"text":"feb 17 2011: the soup: tasted like campbell's chicken noodle (high sodium, low quality dark chicken)  the chef's salad: had low quality ham, turkey and they cut strips of american cheese slices- they looked exactly like kraft singles  the seasoning on the corned beef was off- this place doesn't have italian bread?  the smoothie was ok"}
{"text":"Great service and clean restaurant.  Good smoothies and I liked the fact that it was all fruit (no sugar added)."}
{"text":"Opened just in the past few days, so I and a co-worker decided to try it.  The restaurant is very clean and just built, and is well laid out. They've got plenty of seating and the kitchen area is in clear view as you walk in. When they make sandwiches, you can see them making it fresh.  I had the Cornbeef Deluxe and a smoothie. The Cornbeef was fresh and tasty, and was carved after I ordered my food. The smoothie was fresh made with natural ingredients - I had the Strawberry lemonade, and it used only ice, lemons, and strawberries. The smoothie was a bit more sour than I like my lemonade, since it didn't appear to have any sugar in it, but was well within the scope of a good lemonade.  The serving sizes were good and the food was tasty. It would've been nice to have some chips or a side salad included with the sandwich, but the sandwich was large enough that a side wasn't necessary to make the meal filling.  The service was friendly and there were only a few trivial issues with the staff getting accustomed to the new restaurant. The only reason it didn't earn a fifth star was because the cost was a bit higher than I would've liked (~$8.50 for a sandwich and smoothie, with no side.) Nevertheless, I plan on returning there again for lunch."}
{"text":"I came here almost every day in the summer while working in Bloomfield. I actually only ate there once, since they were so kind enough to let me eat my packed lunch there with my workmates. The sandwiches and wraps are really fresh and served on artisan bread. The tuna wrap I had was spot on. Nothing ingenious but definitely hit all targets of what a wrap should be: fresh, clean, and fillings to burst.   It's a very dry interior with vinyl verticals and linoleum and acoustical tile horizontals. The service is slow and they play slow jams on a underutilized plasma screen, but the food is good and much needed in the awkward location stuck between the thriving foodie markets of the Strip and Bloomfield."}
