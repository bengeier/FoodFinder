{"text":"Based on our experience with SJ @ Norval we visited this location for a family celebration. Apart from the fact that our table was very close to the door, the rest was good. Very friendly server, good food (taste and portion wise) and some good beer the overall experience was good. Not something that will make me come back. But good enough that, if I have to go there a second time, i will not hesitate."}
{"text":"I always have trouble chosing just one thing on the menu. The food is always good here. Recently went there to try the new menu and 3 out of 4 of us ended up ordering the Asian chicken bites and loved them, try it with the squeeze of lemon ! Will defiantly be going back to try more off the menu. P.s start with the spinach dip ;)"}
{"text":"I've been to this place many times and it's expected that the service is slow regardless of what time of day or day of the week it is. The food is really good. The food is worth 5 stars. The service really needs to improve though. We went for dinner and had to wait a really long time. No problem, I thought as it's a Saturday night. However when it came to ordering dessert, that's when things became a disaster. We waited over 30 minutes and could not find our waitress. When she finally swung by, she saw us, her eyes widened as if to say she forgot, and then ran away from our table. Only to come back 5 minutes later to blame it on the kitchen. No. Please don't blame it on the poor kitchen staff. She forgot. I would rather hear the truth instead of the blame game. I told her we no longer wanted the desserts and to take them off our bill. She looked stunned. I normally wouldn't do that but what she did rubbed me the wrong way. Let her go back to the kitchen and explain why there were two desserts that were no longer wanted or needed. It was something you had to see to understand but at the end of the day I decided to do this instead of complaining to management. She was still given a 15% tip. They really need to improve their service as I now will no longer be going to this location."}
{"text":"Took 35minutes for the food to arrive, was not even informed that the food would be delayed and the waitress gave the excuse that the fryers for the wings were backed up due to a big order at the bar. Well we had just one order of wings the rest was other food and nothing came early. In fact the table behind us came after us and they received their food first including wings! Moreover the food when it came was not good and fries extremely salty. Such a bad experience. We will probably not return. This is the one on to Winston Churchill."}
{"text":"It's great when the bartender remembers you by your drink. Even better when they remember your name. it's the small things that add up. Thanks Mika. (BTW she's quite fetching. )"}
{"text":"Its a great spot to be on the patio in the summer on a weekend they do have a singer on occasion. Ive always found the staff to accommodate you well here especially if its in the evening and you are just looking to enjoy an appetizer or even just a drink late at night. Its not been a busy night when Ive gone but the fact that they make you feel welcome at that time of night says alot about an establishment."}
{"text":"I'm given this place 5 star for their customer service.

{"text":"It's a run-of-the-mill eatery -- you'll find typical stuff on the menu and the cheap, watered down beer. It's the equivalent to a TGI Fridays or Houlihan's in the USA! Pretty generic food and drink."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Took 10 \"minutes to get a beer and then the server never came to order food. This is the last time I come into this place."}
{"text":"So my two year old daughter and I took a walk out to our local strip mall looking for lunch.  She said that she wanted pizza, so we went to Shoeless Joe's Sports Grill.

For those unfamiliar with the chain, its a chain of sports restaurants based around \"Shoeless\" Joe Jackson of Black Sox fame.  This location is mature having been here for over 10 years.  It was renovated within the last year to make the interior much brighter and airy.  A welcome change to the dark persona of a lot of sports bars.

We were seated promptly, and our orders were taken fairly quickly.  My daughter had the kids pizza with, fries and apple slices.  She must have been happy with hers as the pizza was in her belly in 10 minutes flat, as were the apple slices.  The fries tasted like fries but neither of us was too interested in them.

I had the Baja Chicken sandwich with a side of Quinoa.  My sandwich was pretty good, but a little gooey.  I think if they omitted the mayonaisse it could have been great!  The avacado provided a nice summery taste.  The quinoa had a couple of issues.  I think that they prepared a big batch of Quinoa then just spoon it into the bowl and heat it under the salamander.  I say this because the top layer was crunchy, and the rest of it was moist - the way I expect it to be.  I didn't get to fully enjoy the Quinoa as my daughter decided it was rice and went to town on it, consuming about 1/4 of it and putting another 1/4 all over the table and booth.

For dessert she had the kids bubblegum ice cream sundae.  That was a treat and a half.  A scoop of bobblegum ice cream in a waffle bowl with whipped cream, gummy bears and candy sprinkles on the side.  The sides were very plentiful and we even had enough gummy bears to bring home for later."}
{"text":"Been many times. Service usually good.
Share plates good but nachos are not up to par with what they used to be.  The cheesy meat chili on the nachos was thin on chilli.  Not up to what they used to be.
Wings were good size but very little sauce.
Overall a bit of a disappointment in what was once our go to restaurant."}
{"text":"Visited Joe's with my local colleague to catch a hockey game. Service was great, plenty of TVs, and the crowd was fun even though most were rooting against our team. Menu was pretty comprehensive with a good selection of Apps, burgers, and full dinners. 

Even though this is a chain Joe's has a local feel to it."}
{"text":"Ordered a three cheese jalapeno burger with fries  gravy on the side had and two drinks that were all decent, but had better everything! the service was good the server was nice and attentive! everything was 40 bucks with tip included. might be back in the future but not for food maybe dessert and drinks!! montana's and turtle jacks have far superior food! solid 3 stars.."}
{"text":"***3.5 stars***

Iv been here a couple times and for a chain sports grill restaurant its not too shabby. 

Last time i got a pound of wings for myself and when they brought it out it wasnt the same type of wings i wanted. I told our waitress and told me to try those while they made the kind i had asked for. They gave me the kind of wings i wanted at the end. I was glad with the service, our server was nice and dealt with the situation well. They have flat screens everywhere in here even mini flat screens in the booths if you're coming here to watch a game. I think that out of most chain sports grill restaurants i prefer this one if i had to choose."}
{"text":"They should rename the Meadowvale location \"Average Joes\". I have been here a couple of times, once to meet up with a friend, and another time to for a high school reunion.  The drink and food menu is very average but over priced. Service on both times I was here was mediocre and the joint just lacked atmosphere. I had the wings, and they were not of the quality I would expect from a franchised sports bar. If you live in this neighborhood, don't waste your money or time here. There is a Turtle Jacks practically next door to this place. I have not been there yet, but I am sure it has to be better than this place."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. 
I went here last Sunday April 2nd with my husband and my friend. I ordered the blue freezie drink which was good. And some sort of pretzel fries dish with chili and other things on it. I didn't really like it... pretty much like eating toasted chopped bread and chilli. I wish it had come with actual fries instead then I would have liked it. My husband got the Buffalo chicken wrap with a beer which was good.  For dessert, I got the cosmo cheesecake. I've had it before and the cheesecake part of it tastes like  thick vanilla pudding that tastes so fake. I don really like it, but I like the fruit and the cake pieces. 
My friend ordered the chunky chocolate crunch, she liked it but it was smaller than she expected, and my husband ordered the ultimate cookie which wasn't very big we were surprised.  Service was good overall and good environment."}
{"text":"The initial time I visited Shoeless in the Courtney Park plaza I was highly unimpressed that I never wanted to visit another Shoeless Joe's franchise ever again. Yesterday I was dragged out to Shoeless Joe's so I went in with low expectations. Fortunately yesterday's visit was a much better one.

Our server was very friendly and attentive during our entire stay. She even asked for our names and personally wrote down our names on our respective bills. At first I was just going to order a Caesar salad but then my boyfriend made me crave for wings. Therefore, we shared the starter Caesar salad and both got a pound of cajun and Frank's hot wings. Our orders came out relatively quickly and tasted good. The wings at Shoeless Joe's are bigger than most wings places so that's probably why they are a bit more expensive. A pound of wings is $11.99 which is only seven wings. 

After yesterday's visit I don't mind visiting them again in the future."}
