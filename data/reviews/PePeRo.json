{"text":"so far, pepero korean market is my go to when it comes to korean food. still looking for good korean food around charlotte."}
{"text":"My husband and I love going to new ethnic places. We are so happy to find this hidden gem! It is located in the back of a Korean market store, so don't judge the book by its cover. We came here on a Monday afternoon and it was packed! The waitress was very sweet and attentive even though she had all those tables to take care of. There is a service button at the table to press to order or whenever you need anything at all. I tried the kimchi pancakes for the first time which were fantastic! My husband was very satisfied with the soup he ordered, it was bold and flavorful. This will be one of our new regular places from now on :)"}
{"text":"My parents owned a Korean restaurant so I know good Korean food! I enjoyed their Kalbi (short ribs) kalbi tang (short rib soup) bulgogi (thin marinated beef) tofu soup with mackerel combo and their seafood pancake. There has been times where the side dishes weren't as good. For instance the cucumber kimchi was soggy and bean sprouts were bland but the main dishes made up for it. They do get busy so the server button that's on every table comes in handy when you need something."}
{"text":"I have been itching to find a nice Korean place in Charlotte! I was used to having lots of choices in Chicago and I was worried that it was going to be impossible to find that here. Luckily, Yelp did not steer me wrong! 

Stopped in for a quiet lunch- the place looked simple and clean. Our waitress was attentive, very friendly. Ordered a seafood pancake that was thicker than I have been used to in other restaurants, but still perfectly golden and tasty. The sauce that came with it was salty/spicy and proved a good combination. My husband got a dolsot bi bim bop (I cant spell!!) and I had some clear noodles with beef and veggies. Everything hit the spot perfectly! I had leftovers and am still excited about it.

The little market portion is cute and has all the usual items- aloe vera juice, sweets and chips, etc that you can't get anywhere else. 

I will definitely be back! I really enjoyed it and maybe after I come back a few times I can kick it up to a full star rating."}
{"text":"After five check-ins here I am finally able to write my review. This place is unique in every way. Who would've thought there would be a small restaurant inside a small Korean grocery store. There is nothing fancy about this place but it really does not matter because the food is 100% authentic Korean food..and absolutely delicious. 

I just love the laid back atmosphere..siping green tea and watching Korean tv shows. The side dishes are delicious and is traditionally served with your food. I love the Kimchee!! I usually order the Bibimbap in a hot stone bowl..but this time around I decided to try the beef fried rice which was toped with a fried egg.
It was super delicious and filling.

This establishment is family owned and run..the best part is after your tasty meal you can explore the grocery section and pick up some items to bring home. I highly recommend finishing your meal off with Ice-cream shaped fish.. 

I absolutely love this little gem and will be definitely coming back each time I need my Korean food fix. Don't be surprised by what the building looks like and where the restaurant is..the food alone makes you forget where you are."}
{"text":"Authentic Korean food, it's a small dining area in the corner of a grocery store.  But you will not be disappointed if you are looking for good tasty authentic food.  Sometimes the service is slow, but it's worth of the wait."}
{"text":"Simple but quite nice place for Korean food lovers. Had a Soon Du Bu soup and it was great. Side dishes (banchan) are of good quality and a guest can ask for more it those while there dining."}
{"text":"service is good, i recomend the seafood soup!!! its so good, and the fried dumplings! it is also a store, you cant tell it a restaurant buy looking at it outside. and it smells a little, but that should not matter cause they sell seafood there. defently recomend!!!"}
{"text":"We were really excited about the reviews, so we came to Pepero with great anticipation. We were seated right away at 8pm, as the restaurant was not busy. That was when the nightmare began. After taking our order, our waiter completely disappeared. As in, 38 minutes later, our banchan/appetizer dishes had not appeared, and they hadn't even checked on us. Meanwhile, at the table next to us, a couple sat down, and were served immediately. In fact, they got their entrees before we even got our banchan. Oh, and we ordered bulgogi. It wasn't as if we ordered something that they had to make specially.

So after 38 minutes, we pressed the call button and asked about the status of our banchan and our entrees. \"Oh, those don't come with your meal.\" Really? I mean, seriously? But ok, fine, what about our entrees? How are those doing? So he disappeared to check. By disappeared, I mean for a full 10 minutes, and at that point we just walked out of there.

There were 2 waitstaff, and only 4 couples in the restaurant. Also, I don't understand why they did not bring banchan, and why after a total of 48 minutes in the restaurant, all we got was water and bad attitude from the waiter. I was not confrontational, I was not jamming the call button, and maybe that's why I was not served at all. Should I have tried to talk to the manager, or raised my voice? I don't think so, because that would make me as rude as they were!"}
{"text":"rare pepes they were not dank but they were pretty rare like they were ok but I honestly think they could have done better"}
{"text":"This place's tang soo yuk (sweet and sour pork) sauce is literally store bought pineapple jam poured onto a plate of fried pork with canned fruits on the side. The waiter got one of our order wrong and acted like he didn't understand us, and so we ended up just eating what we had. Even though this experience was somewhat disappointing, the food seemed authentic and the store owner was very nice."}
{"text":"I found this place on a whim just looking online to see if there was korean food anywhere in the charlotte area. I'm glad I did, the people there are so nice and the food is great.  Its a bit of a drive for me but that's worth it for the food and atmosphere there.  I also took a look at the market and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I was totally not expecting such a good Korean restaurant in Charlotte, but this place was REALLY good. Bulgogi, kalbi, and tofu soup were are so flavorful and delicious - couldn't help commenting about the food the whole meal! It's to the side of a grocery store, so don't go there for the ambiance - go for the food!! :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Pepero on New Years because we both were craving Korean food and he hasn't been there so I thought why not? I've been there a few times in the past and the food was alright, nothing amazing nor horrible either. We were seated quickly, there was 3 tables occupied. There were two servers, the guy took the table to our left, the girl took the front table and ours. Maybe 15 minutes later, the table to our left got their food first. 2 big group of people came in during that time and got seated quickly and got their orders in too. About another 30 minutes went by, one of the big group got their food. Another 10 minutes after that, the second big group got theirs. By that time, one hour has past and neither the front table or us have got our food BUT the two big group who came 15 minutes after us got theirs. 

I understand the 2 big groups may bring in more money but that is not how you treat your customers! I heard the front tables order and they didn't order a lot of food, neither did we. I was patient enough to wait one hour and my food was still not on the way so we left. I will NOT be coming back and will NOT recommend this place to anyone because service is TERRIBLE!!!"}
{"text":"PePeRo is the best place to get authentic Korean food in Charlotte.  I always go there for my Korean grocery needs but I find myself going there more often for a quick meal.  It is tucked in the back of the market and is not fancy by any means, but the staff is friendly and helpful.  If you have never had Korean food before, ask for a recommendation (bulgogi and chop jae good for beginners) and you won't be disappointed.  It will be fresh and delicious!"}
{"text":"Having spent 2 years in Korea with the military, i can say this place hits the spot! Coming into this restaurant reminds me of some of our late night trips into little hole in the wall stops in Itaewon, Chun Cheon and even Uijongbu! food is quite flavorful, although not quite as spicy as I remembered all those years ago :-)
Bul go Gi is my old standby, and i am ashamed to admit that I do tend to order the Bul Go gi for two just to make sure I get my fill (Don't JUDGE me :-). I also love the pork dish for its flavor, although for those who like leaner cuts of pork, you may need to look elsewhere.
I love the fact that I can run out to the store side and grab my Sac Sac orange drink. The wife LOVES the hot tea service and the Dol Sot Bi bim Bop!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Everything is on point.  It is casual and located inside a grocery store--good for friends, kids, and families.  It really is a hole in the wall, but those are where you find the gems.  Food is great--I don't like fried rice, but I love fried rice from PePeRo.  It's nice browse through the store after your meal as well.  You can find some good deals on souvenirs and asian candy."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Korean food very much. We were sad when unable to find a good Korean restaurant in Charlotte until visiting Pepero. We tried bibimbap, kimchi soup and stir fried glass noodle today. They are very delicious. We are 100% sure that we will come back there very often."}
{"text":"We stopped by at 3 pm for a late lunch. The day before we were in Charleston eating Korean at the only Korean place in town and the food was ok not what we wanted having lived in the Bay area for 20 years so when I yelped Charlotte and found this place I had high expectations.
Yes it is small and located in the back of the grocery store. The menu is small and many meals are priced for 2 people so because we each wanted a different item our selection was small. They would not substitute tofu for meat in my meal bi bim bob which I was disappointed. The beef in the bi bim bob was ground beef which I will not eat. The sides were generous, fish cakes, kimchi, cukes , bean sprout and a sea weed dish. I was hoping for the potatoes but not offered. The crusty rice in my hot pot tasted of canola oil :( 
I would not recommend this place. A sad lunch when I had high hopes of a good meal."}
{"text":"Authentic Korean food.  No fuss atmosphere, minimal sineage to get you there, but once you do it is a gastronomical feast!"}
{"text":"Being that I'm Puerto Rican, I'm not going to even try to speak about the authenticity of this place (just because you visited Korea for 3 seconds in college doesn't make you an expert on authentic Korean). I am however an expert on things that are delicious and this place is exactly that. The seafood pancake is crispy on the outside and full of chewy deliciousness on the inside, the short ribs are sweet and savory. Even something as basic as beef fried rice is made with a little extra sweet Korean love. I love this place and I am here often. This is a mom and pops so just know that it looks and feels like exactly that."}
{"text":"The food is just right.  The appetizers was great added bonus.  We had soup, the first two on the menu fir soup and it was as expected.  The yu gae jang, forgive my spelling, was as I expected.  I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Decided to visit PePeRo for Jam bong (excuse my spelling) on a trip to Charlotte.

Update, There are more seating in the restaurant part now, at least 14 tables for 4. 

We ordered the Jam Bong, seafood pancake, udon noodle soup, and friend squid over rice. All the food was excellent, the soup broth was rich in taste, though it was very red, it was not really spicy (the only downside). The fried squid came in a really nice bbq sauce, and it was obvious that the ingredients were fresh. The side dishes were yummy too, fresh kimchi ftw.

In short, PePeRo offers great food and even better price!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed most of the dishes here albeit some were a bit too greasy.  I prefer the restaurant over in Super G as their meats are leaner/tender and less greasy.  But I would recommend both places, very friendly too."}
{"text":"Best Korean food in charlotte. Spicy seafood soup is a must!"}
{"text":"I recently moved to Charlotte after living overseas for the past ten years, four of which were spent in Korea.  My favorite food is Korean and I know it can be difficult to find decent Korean food in some cities.  So I was ecstatic to find Pepero!  
I have been there four or five times in the past few months.  The quality of the food has been excellent each time. I usually order the Samgyeopsal (pork), it's served as \"spicy pork with vegetables\". I usually get the yakimandoo (a simple pan-fried meat and veggie dumpling), which have been great as well.
The restaurant is tucked in the back of their Korean food shop.  So, most of the ingredients you eat at the restaurant can be purchased at the shop up front.  They even sell kimchi!
Anyways, I highly recommend Pepero!"}
{"text":"Yummy authentic Korean food and experience.  Don't get scared by the aesthetics. 
I took the family here with kids and a grandparent and everyone loved it. There is a Korean grocery store attached that is small but has everything you need and more to make Korean food."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of going on Tuesday - tried again the next week on a different weekday. Sort of set back in between some larger building on Monroe, with ample parking for both small restaurant and front grocery store sections.  Very authentic Korean dishes.   Ask for the frequent visitor card for your \"discount\". Menu in english as well with pictures to assist the interested but new foodie - or just ask the friendly staff."}
{"text":"Just moved out here and was not able to find a decent korean restaurant .. we went as soon as they opened.  I read that the wait was long for the food and service, so I wanted to beat the crowd since I had both kids with me.  Service was great and the food was good.  It was better than the other k restaurants I've been to out here.  Still looking for my go to korean restaurant .."}
{"text":"We came at 1:30pm for a late lunch. When we were there, it was busy and we totally understood, so we quickly ordered and waited, waited, waited until kids were impatient. We noticed the table next to us had new guests and enjoyed their food already! So I went to talk to the waitress. Just wait, this their reply. Then our food was finally ready around 3pm!!! When the waitress took the food to us, she called the food in Korean name, of course we didn't know. So she was very rude with a large sound 'bang' to put the food on table. Actually They deserve a zero star, since no one deserves such a service, not to say the only flavor you can taste there is Kimchi."}
{"text":"Only korean place we'll go in town! Our favs include seafood pancake, bugolgi, seafood tofu soup."}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent. It's attached to the back of a Korean grocery store, which makes it pretty interesting.  The only problem I have with it is the small portion and relatively high pricing when compared to other Korean eateries in town. The food is good though. I've had the Kalbi, and the Jang Bong Noodles. The Kalbi is pretty good, but it really wasn't enough food for 2 even though the menu says it was for 2. The Jang Bong noodles were ok. They didn't put any shrimp in it though. It's supposed to be a seafood noodle, I've always had Jang Bong with shrimp in it. Due to the pricing and the portions,  I probably just eat at G-mart from now on instead."}
{"text":"We found this place after our fave [ kojan bistro ] closed down. My wife is the true aficiando of Korean cuisine and we decided to try Pepero the day we discovered Kojan had shut down. What can I say we both needed fix. Suffice to say we were glad we did. This is a small family run place in back of a small grocery, much like one would find in Korea. Great food at good prices, well worth the drive across town."}
{"text":"The overall food was good. Good flavoring in all the side dishes. Seafood pancake was not floury like other places. Bulgolgi was good and had good flavoring. Hot and spicy squid was very flavorful and tasted fresh. Service was lacking a bit as the one server did not check on our table."}
{"text":"If I could give this place six stars, I would!
I'm very picky about the quality of Korean food in American restaurants and this is honestly some of the best I've ever found. 
I've tried about half the menu at this point and would especially recommend the sundubu jjigae (spicy tofu soup), kimchi pancake, and fish. The banchan (little side dishes that come out with the food) are always tasty and fresh. 
I have visited with friends who aren't as familiar with Korean food and they were all able to order something and enjoy it. 
The service was very good in both the restaurant and store sections."}
{"text":"Charlotte isn't known for it's abundance of Korean restaurants, but of them, this is definitely the best.

The glass noodles are amazing! Everything tastes home cooked and wonderful. I love the Bulgogi. 

Best kimchi in Charlotte. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Pepero is the best place for Korean food in Charlotte. Authentic and reasonable priced restaurant. This place has the same entrance with the grocery store. Nothing fancy. You cannot go wrong with Kalbi, jap chae, OJing oh Bokeum (squid), seafood soft tofu soup, gam jatang (pork bone soup)."}
{"text":"Love coming to this place, drove an hour and a half to get there but its def worth the drive. Excellent food, nice people and love that hilarious lady.  Also, if yall decide to stock up korean food they have a grocery section."}
{"text":"Food is always great here however the wait time is less than stellar when told we can't be seated at a larger table and have to wait just in case a bigger group comes in and  they can be seated instead.   The wait was 30 mins before we were told this and we looked behind us... No one else but another couple waiting in line."}
{"text":"Given that there aren't many other Korean restaurants to choose from in Charlotte, I'm being generous with the 3 stars. Their banchan was horrible. I'm almost always hungry, so I usually start scarfing down banchan as soon as it comes out. At PePeRo, I hardly touched any of it. Most of their banchan tasted like it had been sitting around for a few days. Their galbi tasted ok, but all of the pieces were small and mostly fatty. Their yook gae jang, though not the most appetizing to look at, was decent and also the only reason I might try this place again if I need to satisfy my Korean food craving."}
{"text":"I like their food but there are some annoying flies bothering us."}
{"text":"After living in Seoul for a year, I developed a strong addiction to kimchi, bulgogi, bibimbap, and all things Korean. This place hits the spot! The food is as authentic as it gets- the side dishes are unlimited and delicious, and the price isn't too bad. Beware of looong waits on the weekends, but during the week it's not so busy. Great little store full of sweets, frozen goods, and Korean staples too!"}
{"text":"I always like to venture out and try new things which led me to this place. As soon as we walked in we were greeted and sat down. The waitress was full of life, very nice and helpful. We ordered galbi, bibimbap in a hot pot, black bean noodles, kimchee soup and tofu soup. The galbi was expensive ($17.99 for a serving for one) but was delicious! The lady was nice enough to tell us what sauce she used and not many cooks do that. The bibimbap was good but I just wanted a little more beef in it. We always see the black bean noodles on kdramas so decided to give it a try. Sadly, we weren't big fans of the black bean noodles. It had a weird aftertaste that reminded me of flowers, it has an acquired taste. My mom loved the kimchee soup. The soft tofu soup was good, the only downfall was that there was seafood in it. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE SEAFOOD but it gave the soup a very gamy taste. I liked how they had a supermarket right beside it so you can shop afterwards. We ended up getting some soju and trying it at home. Not a very big fan of soju, lol. It tastes like rubbing alcohol if anyone is curious. Food is a little expensive but good quality. The waitress gave us a homey feeling and still came to talk to us while we shopped around to let us know what was good. I recommend PePeRo's to anyone wanting to try Korean food!"}
{"text":"Awesome little find in an unassuming place. The building looks like it could be a building supply center but actually is home to a Koren grocery. Entrance is on the side where the grocery extends to the left and seating is straight ahead for the restaurant. I believe there is another dining area just to the right of the main (suspect they started serving there and expended.) Nice dining area and very clean. Service was attentive (little \"service\" bell on the table as the kitchen is out of eye sight of the dining room) and fast. I ordered the seafood & tofu soup. It was served hot, well seasoned spice wise and not too salty. Plenty of big chunks of tofu and seafood. I also ordered the dolsot bibimbap. Came out sizzling, as it should, with a slightly fried egg on top. It mixed up well and formed that nice crispy rice on the bowl walls. Great, freshly prepared meal with a nice variety of sides. Go, go, go!"}
{"text":"Looking for a place to eat Korean in Charlotte isn't the easiest thing to do. So when I found this place on Yelp it got my attention. Once I got there I wasn't sure which door to use. FYI, use the door on the side of the business. You will go in to a Korean grocery store and to the right is a small restaurant. Once I got seated I forgot there was a store. I'm grateful to have Mother-in-law that cooks the best Korean food I will ever have. I will say tonight I found a place that is very close to it. Very friendly and VERY fast service. Everything seemed to be traditional Korean style. All the sides (fresh), spicy pork and my green tea for $10. I have found a spot I know I will go back. I can't wait to take my family."}
{"text":"yay. korean food i love. you guys are the best. I absolutely agree with what the waiter did in the previous review from robert mady. How dare robert mady calling all the waiter or manager in every restaurant he go to who does not do what he wan as rude. the rude sob is him. omg all restaurant need watch out for this guy.complaining to your waiter with only make them avoid you.  what is it you dont understand.?
it is heart breaking for me to see that guy robert mady wrote that review about you. how tragically senseless and absurb of his review actually sound. robert mady is man who has a vag as a mouth. Robert mady is like a gossiping woman who cry wolf at every little incident and blow it out of proportion and twist people words with his poison tongues or in this case yelp. does any of your friend who you really are or you have no friend? those that hang out with you because they feel sorry for you? just because you look borderline insane doesnt mean you should go on yelp to insult or label others the way you do.
everyone can easily tell his heart is broken and his soul is dark. fill with hate and poison and lies and slander. Seriously Robert mady . just be thankful you still alive
 have some love in your heart for god sake. the world full of hate already. dont bring to yelp. robert mady you are just another egomania , a person with sadistic nature of the super ego. egomania have no common sense and dont care about their words or their action. not being control of your situation or your life so you go on yelp and complain?
only few year of existence seperate birth from death but that guy robert mady just dont understand. we all stranger of the same blood .  your misguided soul are what is wrong with the world. its not the restaurant he visit or the people that serve you.
Robert mady  be a better man, be a human being. cast aside your pettiness , grow a soul, go meditate . serve god. pray. go gym. exercise. get laid. get a girlfriend. grown some balls. minds your words. control your thought or urge to post bad stuff about any business or restaurant. feed your soul with peace and love. create love and peace in every restaurant or any place you go.  have alot time? start a charity and help others. Go posting with one bad review on yelp one over another for what?"}
{"text":"It seems like whenever I come here, it always makes me gasp in shock. This isn't the first time I had a negative experience at this particular place. Last time I came here I was basically accused that I put a strand of my hair in the food that I ordered. (we had the food in the middle of the table so that my family could share everything. Plus, the strand of hair that I found was deep inside where I had to literally dig through the noodle.) Now you are thinking I'm exaggerating, right? Nope. The  lady owner came up to me, in quote, \"Student, this hair can never be our hair. Your hair must've fallen when you were eating.\" I was flabbergasted. She also told us that we still need to pay because we finished half of it. Well, no shit, since the hair was INSIDE the soup. 

Now, recently, I came here to eat lunch. I ordered kimchi soup with soft tofu inside and a fish. I didn't see any problem with that because I have ordered this 3 times in a row. The only reason I come here to eat is because of this menu until she ruined it for me. Anyways, I called to put in the order because the service is pretty slow here. When I arrive, the waitress tells me we don't serve that anymore and that the owner would like to speak to me. So I sit down. The same owner comes to me and says, \"Hello, so you ordered kimchijigaesoontofu(basically kimchi soup with soft tofu)? Don't ever order it again since this is not on the menu. You don't have to come back here anymore. This will be the last time we serve this to you, okay? \" Ladies, gentlemen, is this how a customer should be treated? The way she approached me was appalling. ALL restaurants should be accustomed of altering the food when a customer is allergic or would like to replace something with something. All I was asking for was kimchisoup with soft tofu inside. Is that hard? As she told me, I will never return here. Even right now I am very heated up about this circumstance. For an owner to tell a customer that to basically never return again just because the restaurant can't handle something so little is very disappointing. 

So as the owner told me, I will never ever return to this place."}
{"text":"Great food!  Nice service. Authentic Korean quisine. I would highly recommend Druid restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Highly recommended.  Had 3 of my qualifiers for authenticity: kids (of said ethnicity) running around in kitchen, restaurant located in back of (said ethnicity) grocery store, and bars on the windows (although minimal).  The waiters were young Korean kids who spoke perfect English and very friendly- there is a bell at each table that you ring when ready to order.  The menu is pretty big and has pictures of everything.  Go check it out.  
PS Bulgogi Pork with vegetables is what I had - delicious (and super hot)."}
{"text":"PePeRo is one of my favorite Charlotte restaurants-what am I saying? It's on the TOP of my list of faves!!! Everything I've tried has been fantastic! My latest discovery was the goat stew. It simmers on a burner right at the table. The meat is super tender and there are no bones to mess with, and there's a large variety of veggies mixed in. It's spicy, but not overwhelming. Perfect to share between four people or two if you want to enjoy leftovers. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"There's not much authentic Korean food in Charlotte and especially not in North Carolina in general.

This stuff is pretty much as good as it gets.
When I lived in Charlotte, PePeRo was still about a 40 minute drive from my house.
Occasionally, I'd make a special trip just to eat here because it's so damn good.

I've only tried the BiBimBap, kim chi, fish cakes, and pickled vegetables. I always order the same thing because I love it so much.

The BiBimBap is cooked properly and I always splurge and spend an extra $1 for the hot stone bowl. It's worth the extra dollar because the rice gets super crispy and crunchy at the bottom and the dish stays hot during the entire meal.

Of course, the restaurant is easy to pass by. If I didn't have it on google maps I probably would have driven right past it without even noticing it.

You have to walk through the store to get to the restaurant itself. While I admit, this can be a bit intimidating, the food makes up for the lack of décor and odd placement of the dining area. It's one of those no frills places with really awesome food. Just don't go in expecting ornate décor because it's just not that kind of restaurant.

Staff is always attentive and they have a button at every booth you can press to alert your waitress. I've never felt the need to actually use it though. 

As for the store, they have lots of yummy Asian treats. Usually after dinner, I'll buy a little aloe drink or an ice cream for dessert. Some people may feel that the presence of the store detracts from the dining experience, but I disagree. I think it adds to it. Who doesn't like to eat and then shop in the same place?"}
{"text":"First off, I'm Korean. I've eaten at this place on and off for 11 years with my family and friends and I recently moved back to Charlotte after being gone for 2 years. Even while out of town I came here and I suggested this place a lot as a previous member of NAAAP Charlotte before moving. However, today I had a pretty bad experience. It made me embarrassed for the establishment. What cost me 11 bucks, will cost them thousands in the future. You won't believe what happened next...

I just moved back to town and I thought I would order one of my death bed meals which is sautéed squid or ojingoh dubap, which is just \"over rice\".I know you guys go crazy over the beef but it's super easy to make so I don't eat out for that. I ordered Kimchi pajun \"pancake\" to-go for my wife as well. When it came out, it was literally too salty (too much reduced soy sauce) to eat. I stopped and told ajumma (honorific respect word for a mature lady who isn't necessarily your family, learn a little Korean while we're at it lol). I didn't eat it. She told me she'd check and I can tell the chef/manager/owner told her that she would not remake it and she said she can add some vegetables so that it wasn't as salty...What?! This is the dishonorable part. Instead of making it over so I don't die of hypertension right there, she said could mask it with vegetables so I don't taste it as much.

 She did, I tasted it...still could. So I politely got up and told the son who was at the front about my experience and he went back and talked with his mother/chef/owner/manager and said that it was all the same since I started eating there in 2007. False. Did not take off the meal at the very least I mean come on, I didn't eat it?! you've got to be kidding, is the establishment that hard up for money these days or did I turn them off? I didn't argue or make a scene to make anyone angry. Usually honor is at stake here, and this is not usually how this plays out. I am still shocked. I gave a 5 buck cash tip anyway because it wasn't ajumma's fault and for some reason I felt embarrassed bringing it up but alas I'm born and raised here and it's not ok to stick it to me...but the consequence is this review and my passion for taking friends and colleagues to enjoy my food just won't happen here. So while I'm at it Super G Mart has a Korean counter in the back and is Korean owned. They always have a better and fresher variety of groceries anyway so I guess I'll go there for now on. Did I mention I paid for a meal I didn't eat?! When's the last time you did that for yourself?! Buyer beware from today on, maybe cash troubles?"}
{"text":"Just very tasty Korean dishes here. Bibimbop, jap chae, savory short ribs, and plenty of refillable free app plates (I can never remember what the proper
Korean word for them is). It's not as cheap as I'd love, and the restaurant... well its in a grocery store so ambience isn't the order of the day but the food is quite tasty."}
{"text":"FUCK THIS PLACE. They \"skipped\" our order and we never got our food after an hour of waiting. Walked out and left all they could do was say sorry not even offer free or discounted food. Worst customer service of my damn life."}
{"text":"This place has excellent Korean food. Probably the best in Charlotte. I recommend the spicy squid and short ribs. The seafood pancakes and bibimbop are also pretty good. Wish they had actual BBQ grills but it's still great."}
{"text":"To be honest, don't let the looks make you think differently. The food here is great and authentic. I love the kimchi pancakes"}
{"text":"I've only shopped here but I found the selection to be very thorough.  It's not going to compete with Super G or Grand Asian market in all selections, but if you live near PePeRo i'd suggest giving this place a shot for quick items.  The workers didn't appear to speak much English and I didn't try the restaurant, but I was very happy finding this hidden gem so close to me!"}
{"text":"The only authentic Korean in town. Every dish is delicious. I especially like their seafood pancake, yaki mandoo, spicy stir fried squid, seafood hot
Pot and the grill bulkabi. They give nice variety of side dishes. Don't forget to drink the barley tea with the meals"}
{"text":"Imagine my surprise when an Atlanta native who has also lived in DC finds (traditional) Korean food in Charlotte!

Food is pretty true to classic Korean flavor, but the -1 star comes for the slower service and one cautionary note. 

Addtionally, in a Korean restaurant, a party typically receives their side dishes + rice first to pick at before receiving their main dish, but that is personal preference.

Note that if you're feeling adventurous, please stay away from the very ends of the spectrum (e.g., I love pork sausage soup, but given that it isn't ordered often, I found the soup delicious but the noodles in the sausage were old and tasted as if they were frozen)."}
{"text":"I must say, I just found this place on Yelp and I will be coming back for sure. It is inside of a Korean grocery store so it is a bit hidden, all locally and family owned. Once you are in, they are very welcoming. 
The food was amazing, this is the 2nd time I eat here, I visited Soul few times so it had been a while since I tasted that local family flavor. Their soups are amazing, one of them was super spicy (I love it though) If you are in the area, check this place out"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place. We come almost every Sunday when we are in town. We always have the big seafood hot pot but recently started trying different dishes. We love the seafood pancake. The service is okay, I think they are understaffed for a restaurant that stays busy but they try to tend to everyone."}
{"text":"Simply delicious! I would love to eat here every day! It's worth the drive if you are coming from out of town! I walked in and was seated right away. The service was fast and the food was amazing! Very authentic and would highly recommend to anyone who wants something delicious!"}
{"text":"Located within a grocery store, I'll admit, I had my doubts about the quality of food. Everything was phenomenal! I was not disappointed at all! I ordered the Bulgogi & my hubby ordered the Galbi. His dish was a healthy portion & still enough to share with me. My Bulgogi was perfect. I ordered the smaller size serving & it was still a nice portion. I was full by the time I finished. There is a button you push for service, so we pushed it for refills of drinks & of sides. The staff was always pleasant & willing to help. Service was definitely done with a smile. The restaurant was kept at a decent temp, not too hot or cold. It does get loud occasionally, but I think it's more of a \"not understanding the language\" type deal. I truly enjoyed my dinner & the prices! How can I forget about those. This was the most decently priced meal I've had! Everything was under $17-18 (1-2 people can eat) or under $11 (1 person). Delish!"}
{"text":"Delicious, authentic and affordable Korean food. Their restaurant is located inside of an Asian (but mostly Korean) market and is nothing fancy but is very clean. 

I've had their bibim bap, kimchi pancakes, daegi bulgogi, bulgogi, mandu, mul nang myun, and all their banchan. Everything I've tried has been delicious and almost exactly like what my mom used to cook so coming here is like a taste of home for me."}
{"text":"If you want authentic Korean food at a reasonable price this is the place to go. Small, family owned, and the best there is in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Really good food but SLOWEST service ever!  A lot of times not worth the wait... long wait to sit, long wait to order drinks, long wait to get your drinks, long wait to order your food, extra long wait to get your food, and then a long wait to even get your check and for them to come back to pick it back up. Sat in traffic to eat here, and let me remind you this time it's during an odd hour so the service shouldn't be too long. Well surprise! It was! Probably never coming back again."}
{"text":"Hidden next to the market/store and you wouldn't know they serve food unless you spot someone waking over or if you read about them off yelp first.

Very friendly wait staff. I like their idea of a bell at every table - you just ring the bell whenever you want service and they will come by; otherwise leave you alone.

Wife ordered the seafood noodle soup and I had the korean bbq beef. Both were quite good. I am yet to learn more of what Koren cuisine has to offer, so will provide an update when I try more dishes here."}
{"text":"This was my first time for Korean food.  I've developed an interest as a result of my  job as an ESL teacher.  Everyday I hear about all of the delicious Korean foods!  So, I must say that my first visit was pleasant & my interest piqued!   I look forward to trying more of the dishes from the menu.  Also, the market was interesting. I bought a few items to try.  Pepero sticks & Samanco ice cream sandwiches. There were a lot of items in the market. I will check it out again."}
{"text":"My martial arts instructor, Grandmaster M.K. Kim, who is from South Korea took me here for lunch and I was surprised at how good their food is.  When you walk in it's actually in the very back of a Korean grocery store and it is a tiny room with about 4 tables and a counter with a small window that you order from  They have pretty much all of the traditional dishes but I've only tried their galbi and bibimbap so far.  Both dishes were very good and are served with a few different side dishes.  Usually kimchi, soup and a couple other different vegetables.  I noticed a lot of people were ordering take-out which is probably what they normally do but if you want to sit down and eat there and don't mind being in such a tiny restaurant, check this place out!"}
{"text":"So far is the best Korean food I ever had in charlotte, the place is not the cleanest but the food was good."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been loyal customers for almost a year now. We visit at least twice a month. He loves their galbi, so that's his usual order. I tend to switch between a soup or the spicy pork galbi. The food, along with the sides, is typically good. Service is a hit or miss. If they're busy, they will neglect you for a long time, and the bell buttons on each table are not very helpful. The waitresses tend to panic when they get busy. Regardless, my boyfriend and I have always left tip. 

Today, service was terrible. We arrived around 8:30pm. Many customers were already finished eating at this point, so it wasn't so busy. Our waitress must have already been in a bad mood because she wasn't very attentive. We never got our drinks refilled. She also wasn't very happy when my boyfriend asked for a fork and extra plate. At around 9:15pm, we asked for extra sides. She said their kitchen closed, even though the restaurant was still open until 10:00pm. Fine. At 9:30pm, a family came in. The same waitress seated them and took their order. We thought the kitchen was closed? Confused, my boyfriend and I decided at this point that we would not leave a generous tip. We left a $2 tip and left. Then the waitress came running after us. She was baffled that we left such a small tip and she strongly believed that she offered us good service tonight. 

First of all, who runs after customers to ask for more tip? The amount of the tip is based on YOUR service--and although it is highly recommended, it is still the customer's choice. After adding an additional $5 tip, I told her that my boyfriend and I have enjoyed coming to this restaurant, but that we will no longer be coming. And that will be the final tip from us."}
{"text":"I enjoyed their ramen. They have a nice little shopping area in their store as well which I thought was a nice touch."}
{"text":"First time having Korean, and I was very impressed. I am told it is very authentic and the food was incredibly delicious. Food is reasonably priced, staff very friendly and helpful, and a neat little store is attached. Downside: the ambiance is not that great, but what can you expect? Also the service is a little slow so don't go if you are in a rush or on your way to the movies. Overall, I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Ever since moving to Charlotte, have always been on the lookout for good Korean food, something I had so much easier access to in New York!  For some reason, all the Korean restaurants found their way in the Matthews area and after consulting my trusty Yelp, checked this place out based on the prior reviews.

Met my expectations and my hankering, but didn't blow my mind.  The portions were decent and the hubs and I were able to share a Bibimbop and an appetizer and still have leftovers.  I was disappointed there weren't more side dishes offered (we only got two and a soup), but it was good enough.  The service was decent, but only checked with us when we called them.  No proactive checking in with us otherwise.

The place is really easy to pass by without realizing you missed it.  It's tucked away in a grocery store and you would think you are in somebody's house instead of a restaurant.  I don't know that I would come back here again, unless I find out all the other Korean places in Charlotte aren't up to par."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Small and quaint. Service is friendly and pretty fast. We had the bulgogi and my hubs had the short ribs. Very tasty and my daughter even liked it. We will definitely come back again. This is probably the best korean food you'll get around Charlotte metro area. 

It's even a bonus since there's a grocery store attached :) so it's a win win!"}
{"text":"Before today, my experience with Pepero was amazing.  Customer Service was amazing, environment was great, food was awesome, but today's experience turned everything upside down.

So, the first of the problems I had today was there was a new implemented policy that side dishes were limited to 2 servings per table.  First of all, the new implemented policy was not documented in their menu.

Secondly, when I asked the waitress... she was very rude and impatient.  When asked about the new \"policy\", her answer was rude making it seem like it was our fault.  Stating that due to rising cost and increase popularity of the restaurant, they no longer service additional sides.  Her excuses were rude, obnoxious, and condescending.  Also, she failed to bring us our drinks... for the rest of the meal, my friend's drinks were dry.  Never came back to refill them.

Next, there were flies flying around our table and everywhere else.  I instructed my friend to hit the button... the waitress arrived and we explained it to her, and she just stood there stating that it's because of the \"change of weather\".  Now, I understand about change of weather, but if there's an issue fix it.  She failed to fix it, she just walks away while our food is infested with flies.

After this, I lose my appetite because the customer service was poor, waitress was poor, food quality was now poor due to fly infestation.  I call the waitress to remove the food (please note that I literally had 3 or 4 bites of my meal) and then they had the audacity to ask for me to pay for my food.  This was rather absurd in my books.

So, while this was going on... the employees and their families (yes, a woman had her infant child in the kitchen) were trash talking in Korean.  Little did they know, my friend was Korean, so she understood everything that was said.

In the end, she decides to again ask for her money and I decide to only pay half of it as a generosity... but when I get home, I found out the sides she's given me were completely rotten, low quality and probably from the trash can.


So, if you would like a place that is completely backwards run and disgusting then please go to Pepero.  Otherwise, there are other Korean restaurants within a 10 minute radius."}
{"text":"The Food At Pepero makes you feel like you died and gone to heaven the spicy rice cake is so good and the entrees were unbelievable it was the most authentic Korean family style meal I have ever had. And the people are so nice. The little grocery store had all the best snacks and ice cream that I couldn't just leave without buying anything I recommend this restaurant for everybody."}
{"text":"This place was really good for it being my first time having Korean. I feel as if the food could've been fresher, but the catering and overall atmosphere was pretty relaxing. I'd totally recommend it for anyone who has never had Korean Food before and wants to try it out.

Pricing is good
Food is tasty
Service is great
Very relaxing dining area"}
{"text":"Some food are very good.  Some are okay.  Wait time is very long.  1-1.5 hrs easy.   Even if you call and order ahead for a take out, they take dine in persons order first.  They may say the order won't take long but when you arrive, u will see that was never the case.  

If you want Korean food you may want avoid busy hours.  Come here around 2-4 pm or really early."}
{"text":"I can't wait to come back to this place. Do not judge a book by its cover. Enter the Korean grocery store and you will be greeted by the sweetest lady you will ever meet. She was so funny! The beef bulgogi was sooooo delicious. The potstickers were yummy as well though I will probably try the kimchi pancake next time. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"My fav Korean restaurant in Charlotte, NC! Def your definition of a hole in the wall, but the food was always amazing and the service was exceptional the last time I visited with my gf's! I'm not super adventurous on food, so I usually stick to what I know, we ordered the seafood pancake, bulgogi, seafood tofu soup, and the squid stir fried was amazing! And of course, my top reason why I eat Korean food..the side dishes...never disappoint! And they also have a small Korean grocery...technically, the restaurant is in the corner of the grocery store...so, after you're done inhaling your food, you could just step right out and wrap grocery for more Korean dinner for the week and of course one of their refreshing popsicles to close the deal!"}
{"text":"Authentic Korean food. American hot not Korean hot. Menu has pictures of all the dishes and staff can help.
Not fancy or a date night pace unless he/she is into food and not decor."}
{"text":"I'm fan because PePeRo it's a spot where I can get eat an authentic Korean meal and shop for Asian food! 

I'm not going to lie - it can be a bit intimidating, especially if you've never been. Let me lay it out for you - PePeRo is located in Matthews, near the intersection of John St/Monroe Rd and Hwy 51.  The entrance is located on the side of the building - there aren't a ton of parking spots but it's adequate.  When you enter, you'll be entering the market portion of PePeRo and off to the right of the entrance is the restaurant. The dining room is split into a couple different sections, I suspect from the effort to add on more dining tables. Usually, someone is there to greet you and show you to a table. It can get rather busy during peak dinner hours.

The menu is fairly straight forward - yaki mandoo, kimchi pancakes, bulgogi, etc - and it comes with the traditional banchan (side dishes).  My faves are the yaki mandoo and the kimchi pancakes.  The bulgogi portion is generous and comes with white rice. My husband usually gets the kimchi tofu soup. I've also had the cold buckwheat noodles which is yummy on a hot day!

I have to admit my favorite part about visiting PePeRo is the market - I can pick up a lot of my Asian favorites, not just Korean! I can pick up Japanese curry cubes, roasted seaweed packs, miso paste, Filipino sardines, sauces galore, as well as green tea, barley tea, and rice!   

So my two cents? Don't be intimidated to visit, there's usually someone who can help you out and direct you to what you're looking for."}
{"text":"Overall very good but a the casserole was a little too spicy for me. Loved the free appetizers! But the down side is that they serve food table by table which means that you need to wait until the entire table in front of you get their food..."}
{"text":"Yes kimbap !!!! They're only $7 and I got so full and still have like 10 pcs left!!!
Awesome kimbap !!! 
Service was superb ! At first I got a 6 pack of ramen bowls and the lady at the register told me they have 12 pack for $7.99 and my 6 pack is $6 ! I couldn't find it ,so she climbed up the coolers and grabbed one for me! Thank you ! 
I also found my favorite childhood candies here !!! Prices here seems cheaper than super G ! Yess!!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent mom and pop restraunt. One of the few places in all of Charlotte where you can get excellent, authentic, Asian cuisine. Of course, this is discounting Viet places (which are normally a little too starchy for me). 

Pros: good food, simpler menu with pictures, good service.

Cons: the place is mom and pop so it hasn't had a make over in a while; sometimes the wait is long if they are  very busy and there are also occasionally fruit flies since they serve a lot of fermented things. 


This would be a hidden gem if it just had a make over and they could do something about the occasional fruit flies. If you can get over that (and you should) this place is highly recommended."}
{"text":"Authentic Korean Food. The building isn't amazing but the food is to die for. Definitely a hole in the wall but those places are always the best!

My favorite dish is the Spicy Pork Bulgogi! The flavors are amazing! 

The side dishes here are great too. This is a must try!"}
{"text":"I haven't actually eaten at the restaurant, but the groceries and prices are awesome.  I can't tell you how stoked I am to find a korean grocer here in charlotte!

I read some funny reviews for this place.  A word of warning.  If you are strictly vegetarian, I am convinced that something will get lost in translation, and you will likely be eating some sort of animal product, probably fish.  Even though you ask for the meat to be taken out, the concept of vegetarian is disturbing for Korean cooks.  I have watched many a vegetarian eat dishes where they asked all meat to be removed, and watched them eat the results which clearly had once breathing protein.  However,  they enjoyed the dishes so much, i didn't have the heart to tell them what they were actually eating.  I hope I don't go to hell for that.

Anyway, I bought some frozen mandoo and kimchee, and they both taste great.

My next project is to cook a korean meal with products from this store.  I will update this review with the recipe's and results.  Probably next month."}
{"text":"Very authentic korean food. The staff is friendly and this is a family style korean Resturant. Sometimes there is a wait for your food bits that's only because each order is made as it comes in. If it's your first time tell the waiter and he will keep it safe for you!"}
{"text":"The food here is very authentic Korean food. I ordered Doi sot bi bin bob #2, Yaki mandoo, and seafood pancake. The #2 was good but not hot enough to cook the egg. The taste was good. Seafood pancake tasted yummy and was packed with seafood. I don't know what was in the Yaki Mandoo but it was good. 
The waitress was really nice and her personality was humorous."}
{"text":"The food was REALLY good. I had the bi bim bob and it was delicious. I also tried the bulgogi was really good. The  Food came out super fast! Will be back. It may look like a hole in the wall but i am telling u. Thia ia good stuff."}
{"text":"I have gone into this lil grocery store a million times a never realized there was a restaurant in the back, they seem to have added a little extension which made it more open.
Okay, first of all , the server was very nice and had lots of suggestions for us to try.  Everything was delicious.   This is my now go-to spot for korean!! Love it!"}
{"text":"What can you say about PePeRo that has not already been said, great food in a dive Korean grocery store.  We drive 30 minutes for our Korean Food fix and never leave disappointed and always stuffed!  Love the rice cakes and the spicy pork with vegetable these are our go to dishes. The soup dishes are great as well you just need to experiment here as the menu is sensory overload.  Love the Banchan (side dishes) of pickled veggies that accompany each meal. When you done walk over to the store and load up on essential spices and noodles from the grocery store."}
{"text":"Wash your dishes! I love this place but, OMG even the replacement cup was dirty. Geez. Food is always good but I'm not trying to catch herpes. What happened to the sweet old lady waiting the tables? Bring her back! Her demeanor was amazing."}
{"text":"As if 2011 hasn't sucked enough, I find that my favorite Korean restaurant has closed. No more Kojan Bistro! So freaking devastating. Where will I go for my Korean fix? Why are there so few Korean restaurants in Charlotte? And why are they all in Matthews?
Sure I've tried Chowan Gardens, and they're ok, but what I call Asian for white people.

So I've ventured into PePeRo, and am much happier person now. They must have had a recent renovation, because the infamous counter with the sideways menu is gone. Or maybe I just couldn't find it.  There is now a nice looking dining area, with about 12-14 tables. Also a television or two, and table side service, which was more than adequate. I would have preferred an actual glass of water, as opposed to the coffee mug with minuscule amount of ice.  

The food was just fabulous. The banchan is my favorite part of the Korean meal, and these did not disappoint. The garlicky cabbage and daikon kimchi, bean sprout salad, fish cakes, and radish salad were all delicious. Would have loved to had another variety in the lineup, but ask and they will replenish whatever banchan you would like. The short rib soup and bibimbap were yummy, and prices were very reasonable.

5 stars for Charlotte, maybe 4 stars for LA; but I can't afford to fly out to LA for my Korean fix all the time. This is all Charlotte has and I'm grateful for it."}
{"text":"Solid 5 stars for being one of the only Korean restaurants in the Queen City and having good food. 

When you walk in the dining area is straight ahead or to your right, the grocery store is on your left. The ambiance is not \"dress to impress,\" but rather enjoy a mom-and-pops feel.

Seat yourself and press the little button on your table for service. The staff are nice and efficient.

The menu is extensive. Be brave and order something new and let your tastebuds have some fun and adventure. I say that and yet, I order the same thing every time: Dol sot bi bim bap (hot pot). It's delicious and hearty."}
{"text":"I love coming here to eat regular Korean food because it just feels homey and the food comes out quick! Their seafood pancake used to be better, but still good. They have gone through a lot of chefs over the years, but food is still up to par. I will continue coming here. Some of my favorite menu items are the Kalbi Tang, Bulgogi Dubop, and Seafood Tofu Soup."}
{"text":"I was not overly impressed with PePeRo as a restaurant. As a grocery store it was totally cool!! However as I came here to eat dinner I will base my rating that way.  The service was great, our waitress was super nice and helpful. The food was only okay for me though. I don't know why or if I came on a bad day but I just wasn't that over the moon about it. The spicy pork bulgogi was not as good as Chow Wan Garden's in my opinion. It was good but not as good and I'd rather drive a few miles further at that point. The boyfriend and his brother both said they weren't all that impressed either. I'm sure I will be back to try other things and to shop though!! Hopefully I can update with some more stars :-)"}
{"text":"I gave them 3 stars because I do care about sanitation and that was one of the thing I felt like they didn't really care for. Me and my friend were killing flies while we were eating. Bottom of my coffee glass there were stains. Silverware wasn't really clean. I didn't even notice the sanitation score anywhere that was noticeable enough inside the place. Other than that the food was great, service was okay. Nothing super impressive or over the top. I would just come back to hang out around the market rather than eating at the place."}
{"text":"The search for authentic food has finally taken me to PePeRo and thank you to all the reviews from the Yelpers.

This place brings back memories of Koreatown- Manahttan, and Flushing in New York City. Hole in the wall places that you would drive by and miss, but once you walk in- your nose will take you to the back where the restaurant is located. 

We were here for lunch and the place was packed. One waitress managed all the tables bring out water, food as well as cleaning up tables. Definitely, a mom and pop establishment and not like the commercial run Asian stores.

All you have to do is flag her down and there is a service button which really does works. Definitely, Authentic Korean Food being served here folks.

Pucker up and drink extra water for you'll need it after eating the Kimchi. LOL. Enjoy the little side dishes that comes with your entree. My favorite is the Seaweed, and Fish cake-taste like fish balls which are thinly sliced.

We ordered the buns (3)- Came out steaming hot and tasty.
Barbequed, marinated short ribs and the Bim Bi Bop.

After this hearty lunch, we shopped at the store and bought tofu, seaweed, cookies, and tea bags.

Will be back for lunch again and more grocery shopping. Not a huge selection with fresh fruits or vegetables, but good frozen items like Miso, Potstickers and dried goods like Ramen Noodles, and sweet/snacks."}
{"text":"Sooo good. Now going by the fact that Ive only had Korean food a handful times I must say the food is really good. Service was quick and waiter was friendly and helpful. The spice level is just right. I ordered the Pork bulgogi and we also ordered the kim chi ji gae which was amazing. I will definitely be going back to enjoy some yummy Korean fare"}
{"text":"True Korean Cuisine!  Brought my son for his 19th birthday and ordered practically everything on the menu. Was well worth it. Had so much left over that we ate the rest of it the next day.  The service was outstanding. The minute we sat down at our table the waiter already was there to take our drink order and probably within 15 min. all our food was steaming hot and spread out on the table. After our meal we headed into the grocery store and bought a few things to bring back home. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little restaurant. Literally tastes like a korean grandma's home cooked meal (So my other half says). We were sat down immediately. While we waited, we browsed through the store. We only ordered the bulgogi and it came with rice and the little side dishes. Nice and spicy!"}
{"text":"First thing to know is that the entrance to the restaurant (and the store) is on the right  side of the building, so don't be confused by the street front appearance.
This is a restaurant for Korean people, so be prepared to no concession to the American taste.
You can order any of the inexpensive lunch items (7-9 $) and you will get a soup and few appetizers with it.
Really good and authentic Korean food."}
{"text":"Food looked amazing. I never got to try it.  There service is poorly executed.  They mean well and are friendly but they don't really seem to try to be successful restauranteurs, more so it seems like they are trying to do us a favor by existing.  If they closed the restaurant today they would still have an amazing store!!   Try it out but give yourself an extra hour and bring with you a ton of patience.  We tried to eat there and from what it appeared they had 1 server for 16 tables, 6 of the tables were parties of 6.  Terrible ratio."}
{"text":"This little gem is hidden inside of a Korean grocery store in Matthews. The store and the restaurant share the same name. Easily visible from the street, this place is worth the drive!

Quite simply, PePeRo serves up the most authentic Korean food in/near Charlotte. 

It doesn't quite compare to the Korean places in Chicago, LA and even Denver, but it will take care of the cravings. Has any else notice that there is a serious lack of Korean restaurants in the QC... But that's besides the point. They have a pretty extensive menu, offering a wide variety of dishes. I didn't expect a place that small to offer some of the dishes they did. Service is nice and attentive and prices are fair. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place and come here quite often. But the service is horrible. The servers are quite slow even though the restaurant is small. . One time me and my friends had to wait for almost an hour for our food. 
Food 7/10"}
{"text":"First i would like to say the food was delicious. Better than most kbbq places ive been to. But the service was horrible! We arrived at 630 and didnt leave until 830. There were empty tables but the waiter kept telling us there were people eating there. We also had to grab our own menus, repeatedly press the service button just to order (no one came.) We had to request for refills which took a few minutes for them to just grab a can from the back. The only time the servers came by our table was to give us our food and our check. We were never asked how the food was. 

But like i said. The food was amazing, im just not sure if it was worth it for dealing with such bad service."}
{"text":"OMG, their food is awesome!  We had a bibimbob, stir rice cake with hot red pepper, and a cold noodle with soup on sat lunch.  Rice, crispy and tasty!  Noodle, they cooked just right!"}
{"text":"simple. if you want real korean food in charlotte. go to this place. 
there is no other choices and this place is legit. 

pros - expensive pricing and authentic korean dishes 
cons - this is a very very very casual dine in place that is connected to a korean grocery store. nothing fancy about this."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. Everything was very good. I kinda wish they had Korean BBQ. Everything was reasonably priced. I ordered the cold noodle and usually they would cut the noodles but they didn't do it was a endless long noodles in the bowl. 

Other than that everything was good"}
{"text":"More Seats!  Now TWO Dinning Rooms!  Enter Through the Asain Food Market! 

The New Dining Room has about 42 seats and the other dinning room is still open too! 

Korean Ribs are a favorite Dish of mine!  Not only a Korean Favorite, a Favorite for all cuisines!  The Service here is GREAT, everyone is very friendly and helpful!  The guy helped me last time, had good recommendations, even recommended that I not get certain dishes!

The Ribs are my Favorite!  The Spicy Stir-Fried Squid is another favorite.  The Sauce is incredible, the Secret in the sauce is FIRE!  Real Fire put in the Pan!  That is what he told me and I believed I could taste it! !! !!!  That does not mean it is too Hot... While it is \"Spicy\" it will not be too hot for almost all of my friends (you know what I mean right?) and almost hot enough for POPROCK LOVE!  Speaking of Love!  This is a GREAT place to fall in LOVE and makes my \"Lookalota\"!

I have also enjoyed: BBQ Pork and another Beef dish!  I took a few photos you can check out if you like!  The Kimchi here is very good, a little spicier than most places (I have only been to four Korean Restaurants).  The other \"extras\" are very good too! The Fish Cakes are the only dish of the \"extras\" I do not care for in any Korean Restaurant.

When dinning in an Asian Restaurant I LOVE it and take it as a HUGE Compliment when the servers do NOT offer any utensils other than Chop sticks and a spoon for soup!  I imagine they may have forks though I have never seen any, most of the patrons I see here are white and I notice everyone has chop stick skills!

This is Two reviews in ONE - Part 2 is for the Market!  For the size that it is they have a nice variety of Candy and some other things I have gotten every brand and flavor of Mochi (help I did not spell Mochee right) they carry!"}
{"text":"Ive heard its one of the more authentic korean cuisine here in charlotte and was not dissappointed. 

But once you get a taste of the authenticity (from the grocery store to the small quirky korean waitress whos very outgoing with jokes) you will not be dissappointed. I got the dol sot (hot korean bowl) and the soontofu with a mackerel which was very flavorful and spicy. The mackerel was cooked well. The korean bowl was excellent and it came out on a hot bowl. It had a nice consistency with a little crunch. They also brought out small plates with different kimchi dishes to add to the meal. Im in love with this small gem. 

If you ever wAnt authentic korean food come here! Its awesome with great customer service. You can ask as many questions as you want if you dont know ab korean food! The waitress def gave some great suggestions!"}
{"text":"1 of 2 places I know of in Charlotte to get Korean food, and both are inside of markets. Happily, both do it well. So good! Vibrant flavors. I recommend the hot pot."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this place for plenty of times and so far, I haven't had any issues. Love their beef soup. I always get that when I go. Their bulgogi is also good. Service is good and they are nice. This is so far my favorite korean restaurant."}
{"text":"I just gave 4 stars to a dinner in an empty dining room lit up like an operating room?? Yeah like I said awkward plus once more I was the only customer. Oh well. 

Tonight the waitress was the daughter, on one hand she speaks fluent English, on the other she didn't know anything about the ingredients. \"I'm not a cook\" - no you're a teenager, that's ok. There's a new menu with pictures which helps a lot.

I ordered the bin ban whatever hot pot. I got a feast - check the picture out.  I did pour on the sauce liberally time and again but I could barely finish as I went through the layers from the fried egg on top to the caramelized rice on the bottom. Plus soup and five side dishes  and all the excellent tea I could drink and all of it  for $10. 

What's there not to like? Ah yes maybe I'll bring them a paper lamp from Ikea for ambiance next time. Plus grandpa was asleep and snoring behind the cash register. Sweet dreams old man. Lots of good stuff in the not-so-mini-mart as well. 

Great food and cheap, awkward dining place. No deliveries and for take out I was told to take a place-mat - which doesn't have the phone number on it. I'm sure they'll get their stuff together some day.  Or possibly not."}
{"text":"Little Korean restaurant in the back of a grocery store. To say I was apprehensive, is an understatement. Went for a friends bday dinner, at her choosing. Apparently this is one of the only good places for Korean food in Charlotte. Everything I had was good, actually tasty. She ordered as she knew the menu and the food. I would definitely go back and do again. Seems like it is best to go with several people so you can order a bunch of different things to share. Service was ok, our large party took them by surprise I think. Food was fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE this place! I have always been a big fan of Asian food and this is my number one spot! I live in Kannapolis so I don't always get to go but I have been there a number of times and the drive is always worth while!! The restaurant is inside the grocery store. The staff is friendly and authentic to their language. I usually start with the steamed mandu (dumplings) and then share the spicy pork thats sits on a skillet and served with rice! Let's not forget about the side dishes that include bean sprout, kimchi, cucumber, and more! After we eat, I buy a pack of strawberry mochi (ice cream) that they sell at the grocery store and we eat them on the way back home for dessert!"}
{"text":"Not very good at all. Charlotte doesn't have an array of international cuisine so don't let the high ratings full you at least not regarding the beef bu golgi plate. Sweet too much sugar, lacked balanced flavor. Pricey too and no vegetables as advertised. Just a few strings of cabbage isn't warranted to say beef an veggie. I won't go back ever and would not recommend you truly it either."}
{"text":"The young lady server is very nice, but the older people that work there are not as friendly.

The food is pretty good, and they gave you 6 side dishes for 2 pplz. The fish cake is very good. However, I think the Tteokbokki is a bit over priced ($9.99), and they only have can drinks"}
{"text":"My go-to for authentic Korean food! The selections are always good and they have big servings, enough to take home for another meal. I have not tried a Korean place better than this one in Charlotte, so far this is the best."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Seafood pancake, bul go gi, Dolsot bi bim bob, combo 18 and gal bi are my favs"}
{"text":"It's a great one. The food is awesome here. This is the best Korean food I had ever.  Everyone should give a try! Check it out!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is behind a grocery store. The food was pretty good. Bulgogi here taste great. The variety of bon chon is a bit lacking."}
{"text":"I have never had Korean food before, so I don't have a lot to go on, but what I had was good. We got the beef and the pork, both cooked well and very flavorful. The place wasn't much to look at but that didnt bother us. I know, lamest review ever, but I wasn't blown away."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Has the dol sot bi bim bob, some of the best I have hAd anywhere. Great place tucked away in a Koran grocery store. If you like Korean food you must come here."}
{"text":"This is the only authentic Korean food place in Charlotte at least that I know of. The building is a bit sketch but inside it's well lit and your typical Asian grocery store. They sell Korean grocery in the front and in the back there's a small place to order and eat food. The menu has some of the basic Korean food such as bulgogi, Jajangmyeon, kimchi jii gae and etc. they include complementary side dishes when you order. 

The food was good and prices were decent. I wouldn't say it was the best Korean food I've ever had nor the worst. This place satisfies my cravings for Korean food when I can't drive down to ATL. 

The grocery in the front was cute. You could go browsing around while waiting for your food if you want."}
{"text":"This place is one of the best Korean restaurants in town.  It small and the food is great for the price.  The Korean soups and bibabob are spot on great!  I would recommend it to anyone looking for good Korean food.  I hope we can all support the local business."}
{"text":"I love that I have this Korean mart down the street from me. And here I was thinking I'd be stranded in NC without kimchi for x number of years. This little market has been a saving grace for me. I can get my jars of kimchi, packets of soontofu mix, asian vegetables, snacks, seafood, or anything else I need from this one market. The restaurant in the back is tiny, but it does the job. The soontofu and bibimbap are good enough and there are plenty of little dishes provided. The people that work here are sweet and the prices are comparable to what I usually expect from a Korean restaurant.

Come here for Korean food!"}
{"text":"It was okay. I was so excited to try Korean food upon moving to Charlotte. This was my husband and I first Korean restaurant that we had ventured out to try. It met our needs, but it was not as good as we would want it to be. 

Venue: interesting, but strange..  We walked into a grocery store, thinking, where is the restaurant? Only, it was to the right of the establishment and was small.  Luckily, we found a table early (morning), and it was not busy yet.

Food:
The place serves the meat already cooked and sizzles in front of you (save you from cooking your own and coming out smelling like a walking Korean BBQ). But he Bulgogi was not as juicy as we had hoped.  The japchae was actually delicious, and we gobbled that one up quickly. The best that had was their Korean tea. I have to give them credit, they got us addicted to their tea that we walked to the store and asked the cashier for the same type of tea the restaurant served us, and bought a box (corn tea - in a yellow box)

Service: 
Although there was a bell you could ring, our waitress kept going to the other table instead of us. We were missed twice in a tiny restaurant!  So it did irked us.

Conclusion:
Good, but will only come back for japchae and their tea. My husband and I will definitely come back to grocery store :D"}
{"text":"There are not too many places/restaurants that serve Korean food in the Charlotte area. There is a small one in \"Super G\" an uber Asian supermarket and China Wing that serves Korean along with Chinese food, but Pe Pe Ro is all Korean and it's, in my humble korean ass opinion, the best in Charlotte.

Don't let the lack of glitz, nor the fact that it's attached to an Asian but predominantly Korean supermarket, fool you ; they can throw down as far as making Korean food!  

That said, the decor is sparse and tacky as only Koreans can manage, but the dining area is decent in size and comfortable enough. 
The service is driven by family folks which is fine and they do a good job in making sure you are doing ok, i.e. needing any replenishment of banchans (basically communal side dishes), and drinks.

The food makes up for it in spades.   I'm dieting, but the family ordered  steamed buns, japchae (sautéed translucent noodles, with carrots,  beef, fish cakes,  and green onions), and dukgook soup (basically rice cakes, dumplings,  eggs, and slices of beef, in a delicious broth).  The banchans can vary but tonight its bean sprouts,  seaweed,  cucumber kimchee,  regular cabbage kimchee,  and fish cakes.  It was shark eyes all around!!

Prices are reasonable for Korean food standards;  japchae was 1099 and soup was 999, and mondu 599.  So not bad!!
If you are craving Korean food and are in the area Pe Pe Ro is really the only option, but I'd still say a must try!!"}
{"text":"This will be as close as I get to being in Seoul. The food is amazing! I could imagine it tastes just like ones mom or dads cooking. We ordered the bulgogi, dduk bok gi, jajangmyun, kimchee pancake, and the kimchee jjigae. All devoured amongst 4 little people. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Best place to come and enjoy authentic Korean food.  Great service and friendly staff, makes this eating experience filling the void that was left when my family and I moved from Korea.  The grocery store packs a big punch when finding food items that can only come from Korea, take time either before or after your meal to look around.  Also, looking for a quick lunch they have the BEST Kimbap in town!"}
{"text":"(Note: This review is about the restaurant portion of the grocery store.) Pepero, thank you for being in Charlotte! Besides the items I've tried in my previous review, I've since tried their kimchi jigae and yukae jang. I would try other items on the menu, but the latter two have recently won my heart.

Don't expect anything fancy, but you will be served efficiently and attentively. Pepero can get pretty busy depending on the time you come, but I really think the servers try their best to make sure you have a fine dining experience. I appreciate that."}
{"text":"Small Korean grocery store that has a restaurant inside on the right side of the building as you walk into the store. Casual based dining and Korean comfort food to satisfy your craving. I always get the soondubu (soft tofu soup) and comes with your traditional ban chan (sides) including kimchi and a bowl of white glutenous rice. Mandu (korean dumplings) and the pajeon (savory pancake) are good as well."}
{"text":"Inspired by Dan C's recent review and some Yelp fervor, I decided to spend Saturday in Matthews. PePeRo was my first stop. Yes, I know it's Korean but I had a couple of childhood flashbacks to NYC Chinatown when I entered. Really enjoyed stepping out of my comfort zone and trying something different. The menu was very intimidating but someone saw fit to fill in the dish descriptions below the pictures/Korean dish names (mechanical pencil?). I quickly scrolled thru the Yelp Photos and played match that picture. Warning: I will not even try to phonetically spell the dish names.

The pan fried dumplings were some of the best I've eaten. The spicy pork with rice = addictive - slight sweetness with a little afterburn. The noodle soup with beef/egg = lots of flavor and enough food for 3 people. My favorite parts were the side dishes with pickles, bean sprouts, kelp, fish cake and those cool metal rice containers (your rice stays hot the whole meal- what a concept). Definitely four stars for flavors, quantity and price. One app, two meals and drinks = only $30. Want to try the kimchee or seafood soup next visit."}
{"text":"Hidden gem of a spot in Mathews. Its a little weird since the restaurant is inside a convenient store but over the years business has picked up and they've made it larger. Very authentic korean food. Service can be a bit spotty at times"}
{"text":"When walking in the decor leaves you wanting.  But that wasn't what brought us here.  The boyfriend took me there to help with my home sickness.  There aren't many Korean Restaurants in Charlotte.  We ordered the Gar bi, Kimchee Pancake, Yaki (Fried) Mondoo, Bibimbop and Jajangmyun.  The food took awhile and the servers left us alone but the food was amazing!  It was like being in my grandmother's kitchen.  The only thing I could say is that the Jajangmyun tasted a little off.  I think they just added another ingredient that my grandmother didn't.  Definitely will be going there more often."}
{"text":"I think everybody should try Korean food at least once.  PePeRo is a good place for your first Korean meal because they have a wide variety of items on their menu including beef, pork and seafood.  If you have questions about a particular dish, just ask the staff and they will guide you.  The seafood pancakes and kimchi pancakes are fantastic; I could make a meal out of them.  When you order an entree, it comes with several side dishes that are shared among your table with refills if needed.  They are never overstaffed so if you need attention, press the button on the table and you will be promptly helped.  Don't wait for them to approach your table if you need something.  
They do not serve alcohol so no soju here unfortunately."}
{"text":"I will definitely be back for more. In fact, after I ate at PePeRo that's all I've been thinking about. Literally. With the weather getting colder and my need to satisfy my crave for awesome marinated beef and spicy soups... I could think of no better place than PePeRo.

So when you immediately pull into the parking lot you're probably thinking... have I found the right place? Turns out PePeRo is located in the back of a Korean Grocery Store. This is definitely a hole in the wall but sometimes that's where you find the best food. On the side of your table you can press a button and it will ring for a waitress to assist you. The customer service is great there and the food came out relatively fast too. We ordered the bulgogi and a hot, spicy beef stew. As you can see from other reviewer photos they also provide a variety of side dishes for you try. All low calorie yummy goodness. 

 It's really hard to find a Korean  restaurant in Charlotte but I'm so glad PePeRo is here. Otherwise if I wanted Korean food I would have to drive all the way down to Columbia or drive up to Independence. If anyone else knows where more Korean restaurants are located please send me a message! Eat well my friends."}
{"text":"This was my first time exposure to Korean food. It is a grocery store with a restaurant inside.  We ordered the spicy squid and seafood pancakes. The spicy squid looks spicy but not too spicy. The portion was huge and good enough for three people. The seafood pancakes are a must have. They have seafood pancakes in small or large size. The small size is good enough for two people. We didn't wait long for our food. Service is great there. They have a service button on each table which I love. Whenever you need something just push the service button. I also bought Smanco ice cream sandwiches and they were so good."}
{"text":"This is a hidden place where you won't believe it is a opening restaurant and Korean grocery store. We ordered three dishes, spicy pork, soft tofu soup and  Chang Jiang mun~ spicy pork and cha Jiang mun are amazing,highly recommended! Soft tofu soup is not that impressive, they can def work on that. Sides are good and you can ask for refill~ all of this cost us 35 bucks including tips! Overall it is a amazing place with delicious authentic Korean food, great service and reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Great, authentic Korean food with a wonderfully friendly staff.  The place itself is in the.back of a Korean grocery store and isn't snazzy looking at all, but the food was just like being in Korea.  We had galbi, jajangmyeon, kimchi ji gae, and dol sot bi Bim nap.  All were spot on."}
{"text":"Been here several times and ordered different dishes.  This is authentic Korean food, most dishes are cheap , quick, and they're so nice!  It's close to my house, so I come here often.  They are closed on Tuesdays!

I haven't had a problem with them yet and it always hits the spot.  I prefer this Restaurant over the one in G-Mart."}
{"text":"Went there tonight for date night dinner and we were thoroughly enjoyed it. It's as authentic as you can get in Charlotte. Their Galbi was so great and tender. The kimchi soup AMAZING. The place doesn't look like much when you get there but don't be fooled. It's a quaint little restaurant inside a Korean grocery store. The service was wonderful too."}
{"text":"Came with the kids on a Friday for an early dinner.  Always a good sign when the majority of patrons are Korean.  Bulgogi was a little sweet for my taste, but the seafood pancakes were excellent.  Rice is a great opportunity to shine or disappoint (blow off) and they nailed it. Bipimbop was good, but not great, but after two years in the Bay Area I'm an unfairly harsh critic.  Hitting the expansive adjacent market after our meal was as much a part of the evening as the meal.  It's VERY well-stocked and if you don't leave with a few items you've never tied, you're probably missing the point."}
{"text":"Great place to eat and shop. The food was fresh, hot and filling. The best part about the visit was the authentic preparation and taste. I will be back and genuinely look forward to the next opportunity to venture out that way. The only knock on the place is there are no refills if you get anything other than water which is fine with me."}
{"text":"Awesome food. Best Korean food in Charlotte. Service is hit or miss. Just use the bell at your table if you need anything. 

We have tried all the dishes and the are all good in its own way. If you are not familiar with Korean food or don't eat it often I would jus recommend the following.

Everyone get a 4-5 banchan. They are small sides serve with the entree. They are different each time. Usually alway have kimchi it's a Korean version of spicy sauerkraut. Steamed scrambled eggs, potato with Asian mayonnaise, fish patty. 

Korean BBQ: a must have
Galbi is short ribs
Bulgogi: is thinly sliced ribeye 

Haemul Pajeon (Korean Seafood Pancake) is my favorite.

Japchea is a yam noodle stir fried with veggie and bulgogi beef. Yam noodle are semi clear noodles
With a chewiness to it.

Can't go wrong with kimchi fried rice. 

If you want a different tea, they serve barely tea. It has a slight smoky and sweat taste."}
{"text":"Love this place! Delicious food, friendly staff, unique experience, and a store to boot!"}
{"text":"We went inside sat down and ordered our food. Three tables sat down after us and all of them got their food before us. We waited approximately 45 minutes and didn't even get our appetizer. The tables had almost finished eating and we still didn't get our food. They still charged us for the Cokes we sipped on for 45 minutes."}
{"text":"I ventured over with my future Korean mother-in-law for some authentic Korean groceries. I felt a bit awkward in there, being the only white person in an Asian store, but the store associates didn't stare too much. They were quiet and were super helpful when it came to carrying over a large sack of rice to our car -- an Asian staple!

I'm a big fan of Grand Asia Market, so this is like a mini-mart version with mostly Korean brands. The store layout is a little wonky -- the food isn't organized like a normal grocery store. Some of the foods are hard to figure out -- a small portion have English translations, but most I left up to my FMOL to transcribe for me. I lingered around the sweets since I am a sucker for sugar and I don't need English words to tell me what cookies or frozen mochi tastes like! Hehe! I was shocked to discover Korean \"pocky\" that's called \"Pepero\" -- not sure if it's a coincidence that the store has the same name... :) We also picked up the staple of all Korean diets: Kimchi! It's pickled cabbage that's fermented for a LOOONG time, but not something I would be able to incorporate into my daily meals (my boyfriend doesn't really like it -- shocking, I know).

Apparently, when you spend over a certain amount here, you get a package of mochi-like treats for free! They're cold, multi-colored, round, and rubbery with a sweet bean paste inside. FMOL popped them like candy, but I stuck to eating one since it's a creepy texture to chew.

I didn't notice that there's an actual restaurant in here until we were checking out! It's hidden behind a set of swinging doors (the kind you see in Westerns). Will definitely have to drop in for a bite next time! Gotta try me some Korean BBQ! ;)

*One safety concern of this store is that the Emergency Exit is completely blocked by boxes. Hopefully they can fix that soon."}
{"text":"While the food at PePeRo was everything I was hoping it'd be and more, the real standout was our server, Aliyah. She horsed around with us all lunch long, cracking jokes, giving out high fives, and making spot on suggestions, including \"stop drinking so much water -- you'll pee the bed!\" 

Our group of 3 dinners ordered a small kimchi pancake to share and I ordered the pork bul go gi. The pancake, despite getting the small, was huge! We all did our best to make a dent and still left 2 pieces behind. The pork bul go gi was delicious! It was spicy but the rice it came with helped cool my mouth down. I'm going to have a hard time not ordering the same thing every time! 

My friends ordered the bi bim bob and jab chae. I tired and liked both. We also had an assortment of little side dishes. Some were identifiable (is that meat or tofu?!?) but all were tasty. My favorites were the seaweed (which we incorrectly pegged as spinach at first) and bean sprouts/curd. 

Be sure to spend a little time wandering through the attached market either before or after lunch. I spent a good 10 minutes ogling all the foreign-to-me items and went home with some cookies & cream pocky sticks that were a perfect, sweet treat after that spicy pork!"}
{"text":"We got harassed today for tips too. I'm familiar with real Korean food taste, so wouldn't say the food here is 100% authentic, but acceptable for American standard. The service was just fair and not remarkable, though the old waitress who served us seemed jumpy all the while and giggling around tables. After paying for our lunch, we wanted to see around the grocery store, and that waitress came to us in the grocery area with the pay slip, saying that it's less than 10% tip and she can't live with so little tip that she doesn't have any salary from the restaurant, asking for more, and left the bill for us to rewrite the tip. We didn't do anything but just put the bill back to the restaurant counter. A few minutes later, she came back again asking us to give more tips! I wonder why the store manager didn't do anything about her harassing customers like this since everyone in the store could see what she was doing to customers, unless she's actually part of the management and pretending not to be one. We could have asked our tip back for what she had done! We insisted politely that's all we could pay for the tip, and she finally left with a disappointed and slightly resentful look on her face. Thanks to her, we lost our interest completely in spending more of our hard-earned money in their grocery shop, nor do we want to go back there at all ever after."}
{"text":"I had Sunday lunch with a friend for my birthday. We were there from 12:30-2:10. The food was great!! The food came out fast, hot, and fresh. The two stars were for the great food!

It was not busy when we got there and yes it did progressively get busy during our stay but our service today was just horrible. Probably with only two waitresses for a busy Sunday crowd of church goers coming in.

We had ordered hot green tea with our food and apparently we only get the small 6 ounce cup and that's it? We asked for a cup of ice water several times with no success. We asked for a refill on hot tea several times as well but the waitress acted confused when she finally acknowledged us, like why are you asking for more, and said she can only give us more hot water. Ok? Often, when I've ordered hot tea anywhere else I often get a pot of hot tea or at least hot water. The waitress accidentally left a cup of ice water that was meant for the table across from us in her frazzled hurry to get us the hot water refill for us, so my friend and I ended up  sharing that cup after it was obvious the waitress was not acknowledging us.

There were six tables at the small section we sat at and our server constantly walked by and checked up on the two tables behind us and the two tables in front of us but did not check on us or look at us. Not once.

When asked for our bill and containers for our food, she went and checked on the table beside us when she came back ten minutes later, gave them our bill, and then took the containers to the other room. While waiting, the couple across from us finally gave our bill when they realized it wasn't theirs. The waitress got flustered when we asked for containers again because she said she already gave them to us. 

When we paid, she asked \"Is that was all you pay? This has no tip\" and pointed out the amount due on the receipt (we had given her $25 cash plus the remaining $23 or so on debit). We did not leave a generous tip unfortunately because we spent more time waiting for more tea, more water, for the waitress to come by and acknowledge us, our containers, and our bill than we did eating (30 minutes max was spent eating at the most because I was literally just waiting for some service so I could just leave). 

And for the other waitress to come after us and point out that we did not leave a tip and then that our tip was not at least a 10% tip was pretty inconsiderate. We did explain what happened though. She did a apologize for the poor service and acknowledged she would discuss this the waitress. 

Note: the couple across from us left no tip at all!! 

I am by no means a rude customer trying to be annoying or get away with not leaving tips. I try to always be nice, courteous, and considerate to waiters and waitress and give therm the benefit of the doubt but I truly also believe waiters and waitresses need to do their part at the very least. Not just take your order, bring the food and drinks, and then bring your bill."}
{"text":"Lunch was wonderful.   Can't remember the Korean names but we shared 3 dishes and they were all great.   Inside a grocery store.   Well kept secret and dying to go back."}
{"text":"Great lunch enjoyed with my daughter. We enjoyed the food. I had Korean ribs and she had the beef rice. We will be back."}
{"text":"after numerous dreams of spicy squid, my husband enlisted me on a hunt for a korean restaurant that served this dish. thankfully, this place popped up right away with other people who had eaten and craved the very same dish. hallelujah! you saved my marriage again, yelpers! (joshing)

like many asian restaurants that are good (and hole-y), this place is tucked away within a store or shopping area.when you walk in, it's a little confusing. it seemed as if there were 2 seating areas--casual and formal?? i don't know, but we got put in one area over another. not sure if it was because of how many people we had or because we had kids with us. whatevs...

menu was very extensive. i liked that there were options to get bigger or smaller portions. it baffled my husband at first, because he was bummed that the squid dish was almost $20--until i showed him that he was looking at a platter of sorts. he got the squid (obvs), and i got bibimbap. our friends both got the pork dish, of which the name escapes me. everything was super tasty. i could have eaten more kimchi, because it was sooo good. tasted homemade, for sure. 

service was pretty typical of a hole-in-the-wall asian restaurant, but i kind of like that. makes for good stories later."}
{"text":"We had the \"Bul Nak Jeon Gol\" (beef & octopus  with vegetables in casserole, and Mandu. This is the best Korean dish I've had! 

."}
{"text":"We don't have a lot of Korean restaurants in Charlotte so when I saw this one while I was down in Matthews for an appointment, I immediately decided to go try it. 
The restaurant is part grocery store and has a very low budget feel to it. The front door is actually an emergency exit (which was very misleading) and the actual entrance is through the side door. 
The food was delicious! We ordered the Korean BBQ pork, shrimp fried rice and kimchi pancakes. All of the food was very flavorful and delicious. 
The inside of the restaurant could be a little more lively and clean. My only issue though, was the \"silverware\" they provided. My parents don't use chopsticks so they were given flimsy plastic forks. I used chopsticks but the ones provided were the disposable kind, very poorly made and splintered. I hurt my hand in three different places. We just gave up and started eating with the steel spoons they gave us for the sauces. Because of that, I only give them three stars."}
{"text":"This place is way too good not to pass up. The restaurant is small. It's inside the market. We ordered so much food. My favorite is still the spicy pork bulgogi. It's came piping hot and the sauce was soooo good. My husband got the beef soup. Broth was spicy and savory. Beef was so tender. The meat fell right off of the bone! One of my friends got the vegetarian fried rice and really liked it. She said the taste wasn't like any other fried rice. Several people got the galbi. You can't go wrong there! The rice cake and fish cake appetizer was delicious. I love all the little samples they give when they serve food. Kimchi and the fish cake is my favorite. My husband loves the bean sprouts and the cucumbers. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Excellent Korean food - simply the best I've had around the world. The gal bi tang is really good."}
{"text":"Loved it since day one. Very good authentic Korean food, but I particularly love the Spicy Bulgogi. I've tried many versions and theirs is my favorite. It's homestyle for sure. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'll admit that I'm not a huge fan of Korean food, but read the reviews and thought I would give it a try. I love a good hole in the wall & this place is nearby. The food was good, and very pretty (my husbands). We had the fish shaped ice cream for dessert and I grabbed a few face masks in the grocery store. 

It's a great little shopping/lunch adventure! Wait time was short and I liked the bell system. No waiting for the check!"}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem. One would never know this place exists if it wasn't for word of mouth or a quick google search since it's connected to a Korean grocery store and operates in the back. Food is pretty good and authentic."}
{"text":"Great food.  Good service.  The Soon Dae Gook is very authentic."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: this was my first exposure to Korean food. If I could recommend some more expert reviews to read on this, i would say check out Dan C, Ellen O, Peggy C and Christi K's posts. 

I have been wanting to try this place for awhile now. Dan C. took myself and some friends here on Monday night. We put him in charge of recommendations and ordering. We got a round of appetizers for our group of five and all different entrees. I don't know what anything is called... so bear with me. App wise kimchi pancake, steamed bun and the wonton-potsticker like goodness. I went with the bbq pork with steamed rice. 

Bottom line: it was all good. The seafood noodle type soup was LOADED with seafood. And best part... it's all a ton of food. We all had leftovers for the next day. Split 5 ways we each spent only $16. What a deal.

Some things to know (for those not familiar with PePeRo or Korean cuisine)

-There's a bell at your table for service.

-Try all the sides that come out with your food.

-If you're coming from Charlotte on Monroe Rd, turn before the restaurant. I drove past it and turned into the driveway on the other side which is actually for another business.

-Go explore the grocery store. 

-Both the store and the restaurant take credit cards. However, please note the grocery store does have a $20 minimum.

-They do have plastic forks for the chopstick-challenged. And by chopstick challenged, I am talking about myself. This is the girl who eats sushi with her hands.

-Don't be afraid to ask questions. Someone can point you in the right direction.

I will definitely be back. I loved the vibe here. It was comforting and kind of felt like getting a homecooked meal at a relative's house."}
{"text":"One of my first times having Korean food. The restaurant is tucked away inside a Korean Grocery store - and while it isn't much to look at, the food was delicious. We were seated quickly and promptly greater by the server.... there appeared to be only the one - but she had the place under complete control. I ordered the Pork Bulgogi. The portion was huge and didn't disappoint - well seasoned with just enough heat. Glad we stumbled upon the place."}
{"text":"Quaint little Korean restaurant inside a grocery store. This place is so much better than the one inside G Mart! 

The hubs and I come here often whenever we get a craving for authentic Korean food and don't feel like driving 3 hours to Duluth, GA (that city is Korea-Town!) 

We pretty much order the exact same thing every time we're here. I keep saying I'll try something different but our usual is so friggin delicious- why risk it? 

We start with the seafood pancake which is loaded with squid, octopus, shrimp, mussels, faux crab and sometimes even scallops. This is served with a soy dipping sauce that perfectly compliments the dish without overpowering it. 

My usual is jjampong, a seafood soup with veggies and Udon noodles. I can NEVER finish a bowl. Even when I share with the hubs and the rugrats, there's still leftovers- there's just so much food in one serving. The dish used to be $10 and they've sinced upped the price to $13, but let me tell you - it's worth so much more than what you pay for. 

The hubs gets bulgolgi cause let's face it - that's a staple and should always be eaten when going to a Korean joint. Not getting bulgolgi is like not getting the fries at McDonald's- you just HAVE to get it! 
The meat is always super flavorful and tender. It's served with Korean rice which is a short grain, slightly sticky grain, similar to what's used in sushi. I enjoy the different texture since I usually eat jasmine rice at home. 

To top it all off, they serve the best ban Chan in the Charlotte area. You get kimchi, cucumber kimchi, seaweed salad, seasoned bean sprouts and my all time fave - stir fried fish cakes. I know I know - sounds pretty weird. But it's delicious! So good that I always purchase some on the side to-go so I can enjoy it when I'm eating Shin Ramen at home. 

There's been a surge of new Korean joints popping up around Charlotte and some are pretty good but none is as authentic as this place. Those new spots cater to the American palette. I prefer the real deal here."}
{"text":"THis is the best Korean place in Charlotte.  It's located on the side of a Korean market.  Its run my a nice Korean family and each dish is prepared with nothing but love.  There isn't a bad thing on the menu.  The people who run this place are so kind and sweet and have a great spirit.  I wish I knew of this place before I wasted my money at Cho Won Garden.  The food is much better and half the price.  We got a small Pancake (which is huge) and 2 big bowls of soup and kim chee assortment which comes with everything for less than $25.  I love this place.  Once you try this place you won't go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Awesome food!! It was fantastic mandoo buns, filled with interesting tastes! 

Ordered ton of foods but filled up with just 3 bites!!
Really awesomeeeee!!!"}
{"text":"This is my to-go Korean spot if I want some Korean food.

When you pull into the parking area, don't freak out. It's a store and restaurant put together. Once you enter the store portion, you will be greeted with the clerk but seated by a gentleman. Very kind.

They have a button where you ring them up when you're ready to order, ready for your check or anything so I really like that. Their price are reasonable and I always come for their galbi & bibimbap. So delicious!! Love this place and I hope they do not ever go out of business."}
{"text":"This is some good ol' Korean homecooking!  If you've come a-knockin' looking for the newest trends of truffles atop your kimchi pancake, you can't appreciate the slight doughiness they have here.  Looking for accomodations? Here's a plastic white fork that ostracizes you from the thicket of chopsticks.  At least this place's got ambiance, right...it really sets the mood, right?  Riiiiight.  Splashes of yookgehjahng soup up on my shirt is dead sexy.  Though-despite all its quirks, this place is endearing and serves up some pretty darn good Korean food.  

Came here with some buddies who had never tried PePeRo BeFoRe... sorry, it gets addicting to type like that.  We just ordered a bunch of food off the menu and shared everything.  I thought everything tasted pretty good, but not spectacular.  It's like eating at your friend's house where the Korean food just isn't as good as it is at home.  Here, the daejeegohgi is pretty juicy and tender.  Mandu is okay.  Jjambbohng had plenty of seafood.  But when you put everything together - it hits the spot. PePeRo can definitely hold its own and I see many a craving satisfied with Korean food here. Now only if they served soju and had a karaoke machine...

dmo out."}
{"text":"Tried this place out after seeing it on Eden Eats on food network.  I will certainly go back.  I had the bulgogi and a Kimchee Pancake.  I ordered the small pancake and it  was huge.  The bulgogi was great and the kimchee and vegetables made the meal even better.  They make their own kimchee and I loved it."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service ,  only came here because it was on the way home and so many yelpers gave it goo reviews . I'm part Korean and I love to support locally owned businesses but won't be coming back here again , I suppose if you don't eat Korean often you'll be content with the service or food but I've had so much better."}
{"text":"Being a Korean (and having a Korean mom that cooks the best Korean food) the Naengmyun (cold noodle) and the Jajangmyun wasn't the best, but Galbi, Doobookimchi, and Ddukbokgi was legit. I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants to try real Korean food. Don't be fooled by the sign or the first impression when entering the building. And don't turn left from the door because you'll get lost in all the Asian stuff. The food there and the service is great. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"The best korean food in the Charlotte area!  It's a small restaurant in the back of an Asian Market, but looks are definately deceiving.   The food is wonderful and the staff is very friendly.  Put that all together with decent prices and you can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"Great food but not a real looker, if you are squimish don't go but you'll be missing out on the best Korean food I have ever had.The service is bad but it's all about the food, there is a call button on the table and they come. I'm thinking that this is a family run spot and the food is the real deal, so make a decision do you want delicious food or snappy service and decor, me I always go for the food"}
{"text":"I have eaten here 3 times now, two dinners and a lunch. Each time I've ordered something different and it's all been wonderful. The decor is a bit sparse and it's located in back of a Korean grocery store but the food is really good and authentic. Kind of like Korean home cooking. Probably not a good bet if you have a large group as the booths are smallish and they don't serve alcohol."}
{"text":"I have eaten here numerous times. Possibly the best authentic Korean food around. I have tried many of the menu items and have never been disappointed. Keep up the good work, will continue to come again and again."}
{"text":"So fulllll.

I always zoom by this house of deliciousness on the dreaded drive to Wilmington, \"tryin to get out before the traffic hits\" or \"annoyed at all the stoplights lets just get home dammit\" so I've never stopped.

Stupid.

Store is full, cheap, and has decent produce. Front door is to the side, don't be nerdy me all scrambling to get in, just head for the green awning.

Obviously Korean in emphasis, with random Jap and Chinese sauces, dumplings, etc (some Viet products as well). Prices were consistent with Super G + Asian Corners. 15 pound bags of rice for cheap. Bags of chili powder, enough to throw a pillow case over and sleep on, 5 bucks.

But the real fun is to be had down the mysterious hallway, \"restaurant\" sign draped across the door, smells wafting out, battling the dried fish and pickly aromas from the shelves and freezers. Hmm, sesame. Oooh, I hear something sizzling. Big, printed vinyl menu hung sideways, so you have to stoop and stick your head through the window to place an order. Either these guys know exactly how to slay the hole-in-the-wall loving crew or they're a little nuts. Let's go with the latter.

So there's Soondubu, there's BiBimBap, there's fried noodles and fried rice, vegetarians. Pretty sure there's no fried tofu in this joint, only super silky soft. She knew what I was talking about I-no-eat-animals-wise and listed the things they'd leave out to properly fill my order (with a slightly sad face, like she thought I was missing out, awesome). 

And I get more stew than I can possibly, ever eat, complete with pickles of every type - a mild kimchi, sprouts, sweet yam, and not one but TWO poached eggs, gooooood god. Small cup of white rice. I couldn't stop, and now I need a nap.

Love ya PePe."}
{"text":"Absolutely love their food! My favorite dish is the spicy pork with squid! Servers are super friendly. One of my favorite spots to go to."}
{"text":"The only thing I don't like about PePeRo is that they are not in the Detroit area.  My wife and I stayed with the classics and she ordered Bibimbap and I ordered Bulgogi.  They both were delicious and came with the usual small pickled side dishes.  We were in Charlotte for a conference and had seen PePeRo featured on Eden Eats and immediately put it on our To Do list.  Staff was friendly and we noticed a lot of families eating there.  The bonus here was the Korean grocery attached that we could browse through and we bought a few things there as well.  Anytime we are in the Charlotte area we will make sure to stop again."}
{"text":"I have searched high and low for authentic Korean food. I lived in Korea for awhile and became obsessed with the food. Thankfully, I have food Pepero to satisfy my cravings! It is funny that I used to shop at their store for Korean ingredients and didn't realize they had a restaurant in the back! Their Kalbi tang is wonderful!! It is a beef rib soup that reminds me of Korea. The bulgogi and spicy pork bulgogi is awesome too. You get plenty of food for a low price. In awesome Korean tradition they fill the table with side dishes. I love Pepero. The staff is very friendly as well. When you're done, you can explore the market and buy the ingredients to make your own sam gyeop sal or other Asian dishes!"}
{"text":"Gross!! If thi is what \"authentic Korean\" food is like, you can keep it! Oofah!!! Never again. Small, dirty Asian market/eatery. Little flies everywhere and one landed in boyfriend's food, that was done. We ordered the small Seafood pancake which was greasy and full of octopus and surimi (fake crab). Yuck!! We ordered two dishes,  one pork and one beef that someone in the parking lot had suggested to us on our way in and he raved about the food and he was half Korean.  I didn't find it to be any different tasting than what I can cook Asian style. They serve little tastes of vegetables that weren't appetizing or tasty at all. Overall, very disappointing. I'll try Korean again, just not this place. My nail girl in New York makes better food than this. I found nothing appetizing or flavorful here."}
{"text":"I was in such a long withdrawal of authentic Asian food that eating at PePeRo deserved 5 stars! I would give it 10 even for being so close to where I live!

Moving from LA to Charlotte is quite an adjustment, especially when it comes to the food scene. And PePeRo is now my saving grace.

I ordered the Bibimbap and cleaned every speck of the bowl, the miso soup, and ALL the sides. Mind you, I'm a little 5 feet Asian girl.

In summary, it's good ol' Korean home cooking and as a bonus, there's a small grocery store attached where I can conveniently do my Asian shopping!"}
{"text":"This is pretty good Korean food especially in the area that I live in! It's close by and I love the little marketplace! I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"The spicy short rib soup was perfect! The food is definitely authentic in flavor. The amount of food for the money is balanced. I will definitely recommend it! They only accept visa and master card."}
{"text":"Great service.  Friendly staff.  Good food.  Reasonable prices.  You can shop at their grocery store while you wait for the food."}
{"text":"The food is authentic asian fare. Try not to get caught up on the appearance of the restaurant, the food is good. There's lots of flavor in each bite!"}
{"text":"Loved it!  This place screams authentic.  Now, I don't think I am the foremost expert on Korean food and judging its authenticity but I can easily say that this was exactly what I was looking for.  A little hole in the wall Korean Grocery store with a quaint restaurant in the back.  It had one section for booths and one section for tables.  Each table had a service bell on the table when you are ready.  Otherwise, the staff will leave you the F alone (which can be nice sometimes rather than being bugged ever two seconds).  

On to the food....  I ordered the Pork Bo go bi (something like that, hahaha).  It was.... BANGING!  It came over some white rice and was cooked in a full-flavored kimchi type sauce.  The spice was perfect for me (not a huge fan of really spicy) and it didn't take over the taste at all.  Just right!  Also, the sides were a perfect compliment.  They were free and they were basically little sample dishes:  seaweed salad, kimchi, sautéed veggies.  Enjoy!

-Ian M."}
{"text":"I have eaten here at least 4 times now, and the food each time was superb.  In the back of the Korean Grocery store, they have a very small restaurant with about a half a dozen tables.  I believe it must the only place left in Charlotte that serves Korean food.  The last time I was there, I had the most delicious Korean Seafood Pancake that had plenty of tasty scallops. Their spicy BBQ pork is also very good, although the spicy BBQ squid was too spicy for me to handle."}
{"text":"My first experience eating Korean food. I must say I was so excited driving 30 minutes in on a rainy day. I walked in and thought its just like the dramas. The smell of goodness was in the air and people were enjoying themselves. I ordered Korean tea, which taste like hot rice and seafood soup &  Veggie buns. The wait was long but it was busy on a Friday night. I think I will stick with green tea, but we ate everything. Then walked around the store like a giddy kid. I bought a body bar of soap with oats, peppermint candy, sweet bun, and my favorite Korean Pears. I don't want to try any other place in Charlotte. I know that is not fair, but it is 2 in 1. Good food and grocery store."}
{"text":"This is always my go to place if I have a craving for Korean food.  People might get confused upon walking in as you'll see a supermarket towards the left, and a kinda restaurant ahead and towards the right (there two rooms for the restaurant).  

This is a pretty poppin authentic place.  On cold nights, order the tofu soup, my fav!!  It's delicious!  My other favorite dish is the jjambong.  I might have spelled that wrong, but it's the seafood noodle soup.  If you order that, I would advise against ordering any appetizers as that is such a big bowl to finish!  If you can finish it within one sitting, kudos to you man...kudos to you.  I never can.  I love this place for the authentic (or as authentic to my knowledge) Korean food in town.  I do love it, but then their kitchen is kind of slow, so be patient when it comes to getting your food.  That is the only reason why they didn't get a full 5 stars from me.  Make sure to order first, and THEN chit chat with your homies.

Check out the supermarket for some fun Korean snacky snacks.  As Professor Umbridge makes Harry Potter write during detention, \"I must not tell lies.\"  I ALWAYS go to the sweet snack section every trip to Pepero.  It's a tradition.  I'm not much of a cook, but check out what other goodies they sell there too.  If you want just a jar a kimchee, they have some for you to buy!  Convenient!

This place is awesome, so go visit it! 

Gomawo! (Informal way to say \"thank you\" in Korean.  Trust me, I WikiHow'd it.)"}
{"text":"Visiting from New York, so I was so happy and lucky to have found this place!  It's more like a hidden gem/ hole-in-a-wall.  A restaurant tucked inside a Korean grocery store.  I ordered the popular dishes -- soondubu jigae, seafood pancake, rice cakes, jap chae, kalbi.  All were delicious!  If you're looking for good Korean food, COME HERE!  (They have a nice bathroom too!)"}
{"text":"THIS is the place to go for Korean food!! 

When you first get there, the enterance is to the side where you might see some shopping carts. It's a bit awkward and a little more awkward once you get in because you don't know what to do. LOL! Half of it is a shop and the other half is the restaurant. But you'll be greeted with smiling faces and they'll ask if you're dining and sit you down. Once you've got a seat, it's smooth from there on. 

Pricing is very good, compared to other Korean restaurants I've been to. My dish cost around $9-$11 while at other places it runs to $15.

It feels like eating at home, but with someone serving, cooking, and cleaning for you. The decorations on the wall are beautiful and sometimes they have cute decorations on the table too. All the food is always served with fresh yummy sides. Our favorite sides are the bean sprouts, spinach, and the fishcake (I believe it's fish cake). I always get the same thing each time because I just love it so much: Yuk Gae Jang. You MUST try their fried rice. I don't know why it's so good! It leaves you wanting more after one bite. I love how they serve their water. It's definitely not from the sink.

If it's your first time eating Korean, it's always safe to go with a Kalbi or Bulgogi dish. You can venture out when you're brave enough. And like I said in my other reviews, go with a group, so you can try their dishes lol.  

My niece loves going here because they have a \"bell\" service where you press a button and a bell goes off in the backroom to let them know if we need anything. They come and check up on you too, so it's not like they're sitting around for the bell."}
{"text":"Pretty good Korean food. Hope to have more side dishes. The kimchi pancake is too spicy for me, but the soup entree are good."}
{"text":"Yuck.  Sorry I know this is the beloved hot spot for many yelpers but I just wasn't feelin' it and I for darn sure don't see the hype.  I couldn't really get past the fact that the place was such a dump.  I get the whole \"dive\" thing but this was straight up grimy..  I am surprised I didn't see any roaches during my stay but the atmosphere is one that would certainly encourage such a visitor.  

The service was decent, not friendly but somewhat efficient I suppose.

The food was just not my thing.  Maybe I don't like \"authentic korean\" but even the shrimp fried rice was gross.  The bbq was bland and there was nothing else we tried that was memorable.  I realize I am not an expert when it comes to Korean food but if this is the best Charlotte has to offer then either Charlotte needs more Korean restaurants or I can confidently say I don't enjoy Korean food.

Either way, I wouldn't come back here."}
{"text":"Pepero, You are the Best!! Seriously I'm really really amaze that none of the Charlotte Magazines have try here(maybe it because Charlotte only care about appearance rather then quality), because the really deserve best korean restaurant of Charlotte ! Its so good that it my tradition to go eat ( and shop) here ever Sunday!! Yep your heard me, EVERY SUNDAY!! They're service is awesome and they're food is the BEAST!! soo good! Love you Pepero Family!! xox"}
{"text":"My go-to Korean place in Charlotte. I like it because it's authentic, tasty & affordable.
I wish I'm more adventurous when it comes to my ordering, but I swear by the spicy squid over rice. For $10, that's the best darn thing EVER!
Now, let's not kid ourselves, the service here is spotty. My 5-star is mainly for the food and value, and frankly there's not many Korean choices in Charlotte. And hey, after you are done with your meal, you can hop around and buy some groceries!"}
{"text":"I had driven past PePeRo many times.  After my recent trip to Seoul, I had to stop in.  It is a grocery store with a restaurant.  I shopped and purchased a few items then returned another day to visit the restaurant.  I have actually enjoyed the restaurant food a number of times.  I make a note of what others are eating (when it looks good) in order to give it a try on my next visit.  I enjoy Bi Bim Bob, Seafood Pancake, Dduk Boy, Yook Gae Jang (spicy soup makes my nose run), and Kimchi Fried Rice.  I have engaged one family member who loves the Kimchi fried rice as much as I do.  Planning a restaurant visit is exciting.  Still, there is no way I can eat as much as others.  Once I have the soup, I can't each much more.    However, I do take home my leftovers and enjoy them for lunch the next day!  

I am giving PePeRo 4 stars because I have nothing to compare them to in the Charlotte area.  That said, they may well deserve 5 stars."}
{"text":"Great soups and kimchi, go for the food not the atmosphere. Loved the kimchi pancakes as well."}
{"text":"Kids menu: N/A, wouldn't recommend for picky eaters but for the more adventurous, you can find good grilled meat and rice options that will expand your kids culinary horizons!

Kids review: The dumplings (\"yaki mandoo\", fried pork dumplings) were good with the sauce. The rice is really sticky but good. We liked the meat (Korean bbq with rice) the most, it was the best. 

Parents review: We got one order of dol sot bibimbap in the hot pot, it was a little light on meat but so delicious. Loved how the rice got a little bit crispy in the hot pot. The chili sauce was a perfect addition. We also got an order of the spicy pork - huge portion of delicious spicy meat. Not too spicy, just right. The pickle side dishes were delicious and beautifully presented. 

The only downsides were that the decor is a little drab and there's no alcohol served here. Service was great, though. The kids enjoyed the service button on the table - just ring the bell when you need something and someone appears instantly. So cool!

When you're done eating, make sure to stop by the market for some treats - the kids love chocolate pokke sticks and strawberry ramune (Japanese soda)."}
{"text":"The food was good and came out quickly which is why I gave it 2 stars. The restaurant itself was so dirty. There were dust balls on the wall near the ceiling and the floor under the tables was quite dirty and the walls looked dingy."}
{"text":"I started eating Korean food about 10 years ago in Grenville South Carolina, I used to eat at a place called Tasty BBQ, when I first went in I thought it was a BBQ joint!
but I was the only American there. They had a nice spread at the counter you ordered from and the pictures of everything on the menu in nice big color shots.
I was only in Grenville for 1 year and came back to Charlotte, my home.

I was looking on yelp and noticed PePeRo a while back  but never went to Matthews,

Yesterday I was browsing through yelp and clicked on Korean and read the recent reviews and decided I had to go tonight!.

The Kitchen was clean and the rating was upper 90s which is rare for Korean restaurants.
The waitress was young and friendly and spoke good English! :)
I decided on the JAE YUK DUP BOB ( spicy stir fried pork over rice)

First out came the little side dishes Koreans eat with their meals, banchan,,
(cabbage kimchi, cucumber kimchi, bean sprout, 2 I could not recognize, so asked the waitress and marinated radish and marinated sprouts0
It came out looking and smelling clean and fresh!
Then came the main dish and a small bowl of Miso soup.
everything was Delicious and fresh and I cant wait to go back.

The menu has each dish pictured with Korean name with English translation below.
They are open until10:00 PM nightly except Sunday until 8:00PM"}
{"text":"The kimchi pancakes are deviously delicious! I could have made a meal out of that! We had the spicy pork for two. It came with rice and several other sides that included a fish dish that was delightful. You won't find much in the way of ambiance here, but if you're looking for some authentic delicious Korean food then you should definitely visit. Spend some time perusing the shelves of the grocery store after your meal!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful little korean grocery store. So glad I found it. The prices are good, love the little gift section, restaurant is so-so, and selection is not bad. Took off a star because both times I went there, they ran out of economy size kimchi. Wtf? Not acceptable for a korean grocery store. Would be like a pizzeria not offering small or medium pizzas."}
{"text":"I have been here many times, everyone working there is very friendly and helpful ! I've had the  (bulgogi) and the  (galbi) they were both delicious! Have wanted to go a few times on a Tuesday and forget that they are closed on that day! I know better now, :) my fiance and I will continue to come here ! They also have ice cream stored conveniently as you are entering /leaving the restaurant  ^^  Korean ice cream is the best! It's a perfect treat, don't miss out ~ only one thing, I wish they had an outside table so you can enjoy the beautiful summer weather and ice cream at the same time !"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely awesome. Definitely try the seafood pancake! If you have any questions feel free to ask any one of the waiters waitresses there more than happy to guide you through the menu."}
{"text":"Well I have to say this was quite an amazing place !! Korean grocery store in the front and Korean restaurant in the back. Service was awesome, the portion sizes are huge for the money and the food tasted great I thought. With that said I thought this place was just a great first time experience for me .... Check it out if you like something different from the beaten path of fast food it's definitely on the top of good"}
{"text":"Coming from Atlanta (aka Korean food capital of the Southeast), I was shocked to learn how devoid of Korean restaurants the city of Charlotte is when I moved here. 

My husband and I love Korean, but because Matthews is quite a drive from where we live, it took us some time to finally pay a visit to Pepero. We finally went for dinner yesterday. 

The food was good - it's nothing fancy and certainly not the best Korean I've ever had, but it was reminiscent enough of Mom's home-cooked comfort Korean cuisine. I had the kimchi jjigae, which was pretty solid. 

Pepero is most definitely NOT a restaurant you go to for the atmosphere. The entrance is on the side towards the building's rear, and it's surrounded by towers of boxes from food shipments. It pretty much just feels like you're eating in the middle of a small grocery store...which you technically are if you take away the wall dividing the restaurant from the store. In other words, no matter how much your crush loves Korean food, this is not the place for a first date, folks. 

All in all, I would definitely go back if I was in the area, but I wouldn't drive all the way across town for it. Better start diving into some Korean cookbooks!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Of all of the Korean restaurants I've eaten at its in the middle. My problem was the service. No water refills and slow on the food delivery and bringing the check. Walked past the table many times but didn't stop. All in all I would go back."}
