{"text":"We thought this was a sushi buffet too. Pleasantly surprised that it was a full buffet. Obviously it was Asian. We went for Sunday lunch. The restaurant was modern and clean. Overall very nice food selection from salads, to soups, to North American, to grilled food, to sushi and finally to all things Asian. Even saw some kimchi. My only complaint was that the sushi selection was modest considering the name of the restaurant. I prefer this buffet over Mandarin or other chains as it is family friendly. Pricing for kids and kids under 4 was nice to see."}
{"text":"Went here for a office function, there were about 65-70 of us. They accommodated us very nicely in a semi-private area. The food is OK- better than Mandarin of course. But I would not go here unless its compulsory"}
{"text":"Very bad experience. Almost the worst buffet I ever tried! Most salad are not fresh at all. Not too many options. The place is so dark. Waitress are not that nice. The richmond hill one is way more beyyer than this one. Definitely not going for a second time."}
{"text":"It's not worth the weekend dinner price, especially since my 10 year old daughter had the pay the adult price.  Sushi selection was ok. It was hard to get attention of the sushi chef to order sashimi . A deliberate avoidance of eye contact. The soups were good - actual fillings, not just thick with cornstarch.  The roast beef was overdone, but my daughter enjoyed the mashed potatoes. They had a teppanyaki bar. But because of my experience ordering ordering sashimi, i avoided it.  The had grilled calamari, grilled eel with rice, a decent seafood with vegetables. The tempura yam and zucchini was good too.  The lemon chicken, and other fried stuff looked too heavily breaded. Big selection of dessert, which I skipped because I wasn't feeling too well, too much oily food . There was a chocolate fountain that my kids enjoyed with the marshmallows provided.  The decor was modern but the faux white leather chairs were dirty with dark stains on them ( soy sauce ? )   Service was ok. Lots of parking   If you want Japanese food, better off at a Japanese restaurant. This is a Chinese buffet offering some sushi, rolls and sashimi."}
{"text":"Ended up here for a work function. Expectations were admittedly fairly low at an AYCE in Mississauga. That said if you like the sort of food at these places or Mandarin you'll probably be quite happy with the fare.   Everything you'd expect with the addition of a large Sushi selection. Sushi snobs would probably cringe but again it's an AYCE restaurant with a lunch Buffett for 13 bucks.   Fine for a group work lunch, well priced and overall good option for this sort of restaurant. Lots of parking and it's massive so seating shouldn't be a problem even at noon.   Service was fine, it's a Buffett so keep my water filled and get me the bill when I burst.   Would return but not that soon."}
{"text":"Been there today and it gotta be the worse buffet ever. I was there for about an hour and majority of my time there was waiting for food cause everything was empty. Tried to look for the manager and there's no where to be found. I had 2 left over California rolls and red snappers. I decided to video tape the place with all the empty plates. Too bad I can't upload the video here.   I felt bad for taking my kids and wife there for lunch. Definitely will be our last."}
{"text":"We walked into the restaurant around 17:45. A lot of us went to the sushi bar at first, after enjoying the second plate we decided to try the hot buffet. Unfortunately none of us enjoyed the cold buffet, the food was not even hot they were cold and dry. We thought since the buffet opens at 17:30 the food will be fresh and hot, but we were all wrong and disappointed. Sushi bar is fairly acceptable, again is a buffet standard don't expect to have high hopes if you are a sushi lover. Desserts were just OK, they were warm and some cakes were dry. Overall it would have been better if the food was warm enough. I been to this buffet about 4 months ago on a Saturday and I really had a good experience but my last experience on a weekday was bad. I understand that they had less customers, in total I seen about 35 ppls, and majority of the plates were full and retuned to trash. They have lost us as customers and I am sure a lot more during that day!"}
{"text":"Great place to go as the seafood is always fresh and tasty.  The Richmond Hill location closed about a year ago but this location is still open.  Glad to hear as it's my go-to AYCE!"}
{"text":"Wasabi is an asian buffet offering both japanese and chinese dishes. It's conveniently located 1 block north of Hwy 401 and Hurontario St exit in Mississauga.  Highlights from my Sat lunch visit:  -Nice Teppanyaki area to have hot made to order cooked food (ordered a tasty beef , roasted garlic with mushrooms + peppers ) -Dessert area has a extensive selection of cakes to choose ( 3 rows of cakes about 12 cakes total ( green tea mousse, mango mousse, tiramisu were someof the choices) -Cool floor to ceiling cork accent wall in the food area of buffet -Service was quick and friendly - plates cleared and water always topped up.  The restaurant offers a good selection of foods to please a wide variety of people - makes a good choice for a large group. I say a majority of patrons that day were from a large group including myself :) , just the area there were 3 birthdays happening.  Quality of the food is average but there are some highlights to make it worth the visit."}
{"text":"I decided to give this place a go despite the lackluster reviews, and I'm glad I did! The service was good, the ambiance and spaciousness helped make the experience pleasant, and there was LOADS of variety in the food! The amount of vegetarian options was really great, and although it might insult sushi purists the Chinese-American fare was also tasty.   The one thing that disappointed me was the desserts- I wouldn't go for any of the cakes or anything with a \"whipped-cream-like substance\" in the future. However, they did have a good bunch of ice cream flavours like green tea and red bean, and some waffles being churned out fresh alongside various toppings.  Overall, I really enjoyed the lunch that I had here. I doubt it'll replace the ol' Mandarin for me (partially due to inconvenient location, partically 'cos my sugar fix isn't really met here) but I'll definitely be coming again!"}
{"text":"The long and short of it: This is a good place for all you can eat sushi, an excellent place for hot Japanese food and a great place for general Asian buffet. Highlight for us were the different custom-made stations.  Fantastic place for a weekend lunch (adults $16) or a special occasion dinner. The buffet selection is excellent. Nigiri is good; excellent cuts of salmon if you choose carefully. Only other options are avocado, crab stick and shrimp. Rolls are good too and are pretty much standard North American sushi fare: california, spicy salmon, tempura shrimp and a few others. They don't overdo it on the rice and everything is fresh and good. No sashimi for lunch but if you eye the white tuna long enough and are polite, the sushi chef might just break you off a piece or two.   The buffet is a little awkward in its layout which is only really a problem when it's busy... which it was on our visit. However, throughout the restaurant are different stations: a hand-roll (temaki) station, a fish ball soup station, a grill station, tepanyaki station, carving station etc. to ensure everyone gets what they want.  On my first trip around the buffet I loaded up on tempura. The shrimp was excellent. When I went back for one more piece I was disappointed to find that it was now the frozen, pre-made battered golden fried shrimp which is standard at any Asian buffet and was left wondering where the good stuff went. The tempura was light and fresh, unlike at other buffets I've tried where it's doughy and heavy. The tempura included stuff like taro, yam, squash and so on. None of the onion rings masquerading as tempura or battered, deep fried broccoli of some other buffets.  All in all, $60 for three people well spent. Senior's discount and kids' pricing too, which is nice."}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here last summer (May 2012). Like Silvia noted in her review, the food is horrible. Cold, rubbery, gelatinous - it reeks of poor effort. We ordered a simple pina colada upon entering the restaurant - it didn't arrive until 45mins later (we had almost finished our food by this time). We also barely ate anything due to the shoddy menu items. We were presented with the ridiculous bill of $66 dollars by the sleazy God awful manager who was appauled that I didn't present a tip for their horrible service and our absent waiter. He decided to stoop a level lower and demand a tip. (Ugh how cheap can you get!?). I smirked and walked out. We never went back and have told many of our Yelp friends to stay away from this place!"}
{"text":"I am pretty surprised to see so many negative reviews on Yelp. I've been coming here for about two years and I have yet to be disappointed. The sushi selection is great and I love the DIY soup station. The desserts aren't the best, as I don't think they are made in house.    But overall I'll be coming back here for many years to come!"}
{"text":"If I could, I'd give this place 4.75 stars!    Came here for lunch and I am officially in love.  The sushi is pretty good - not a huuge selection but not bad for a buffet place.  Maybe 10ish maki rolls and 10ish different types of sushi pieces.  Stand out sushi include the salmon sushi and the spicy salmon rolls - YUMMY and AYCE!!!!  There is a very large selection of hot foods.  The food is a little more special and refined than Mandarin.    Service was decent.  The restaurant is modern and good looking.  Parking is not an issue.  Lunch is $12 on a weekday and $16 on the weekend and holidays - I really don't know how they are able to turn a profit.  Dinner is in the $20 range.    If you love buffets, come check it out!"}
{"text":"Well, I have to say I'm disappointed in my last few visits to Wasabi, and it's been consistent so I feel I must do an updated review.   It takes far too long for your server to come and offer you something to drink (like water or tea) or to take your sushi order.  And even then, when you've asked for water, it takes almost ten minutes to get it.    I realize that they can be quite busy, but something as simple as getting water with your meal is so easy to remedy, and extremely important to the customer's experience.   And here's the heart-breaker.  Where's all the Japanese food?  Slowly the items have become far more \"Americanized\" and now they offer  \"Chinese Fried Rice\".  Anyone other than me thinking, \"Aroo?\"  If I wanted American Chinese I'd go to Mandarin!  Now most of the items are fried, the delicious mochi is gone, and it's become far less vegetarian friendly.  (Though they do still have sushi that is vegetarian/vegan.)     This place was so much better when it first opened."}
{"text":"Excellent buffet....it's a mix of Japanese and Chinese cuisine, with some traditional dishes as well. The sushi is quite tasty. Service is excellent. There's plenty of room in this place, and has a very comfortable vibe to it."}
{"text":"Good quality food. Very tasty. Unfortunately the cakes on the dessert table were still frozen solid but we got there shortly after they opened. Would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"As I read reviews for this restaurant, it was hit an miss. Some people loved it, some people hated it. I did come in with low expectations.   Overall, it was good. Not amazing, but not to bad either. It was a perfect place to hold a work holiday lunch. They had small communal rooms which made the lunch a semi-private party.  These rooms also have sliders, so I would imagine you can book this for a corporate event. They even had their own projection screen at the back.   The FOOD was okay. Lots of selection, but some were not worth trying. Here's what I can remember  THE GOOD  - fried gyoza  - tempura  - japanese seaweed salad  - grilled squid  - grilled fish  - egg custard thing in a cup (although japanese would have had it in a smaller bowl)  - some of the desserts (butter cookies)  THE BAD  - some of the sushi didn't look like sushi, there' no sashimi one sushi was a seaweed wrapped roll with the seaweed salad from the buffet on top of rice. seems lazy to me.   - jelly fish tasted off  - sweet and sour pork tasted off  - cream puff is full of artificial cream, not real cream  The rest: pasta station, some fried rice, noodles, grill station (not clearly marked), pizza, sticky rice, chinese desserts The western food didn't look appetizing.   Overall I expected the food to me more Japanese, given the name Wasabi, but it was more typical Cantonese style food.  The food was all well labelled. The dessert area was massive, with a big tall glass case filled with different types of mousse cakes (typical mass produced creme/mousse types - mango one being bright orange), over 8 ice cream flavours, small sago/tapioca soups, some cookies and pastries. Note: seems like they bring most of the pastries from a 3rd party supplier.  They serve waffles on the weekends. There's also Red Bean Soup and a whole bunch of chinese dessert dumpling/balls, but at the end of the main course wall, beside the Siu Mais and sticky rice. I didn't understand that.  (Also, there were too many types that the guy didn't know how to stack them properly. If you see two on top of another, most likely its of a different type, so take a peek. I stood there for an minute arranging them all for everyone)  LOGISTICS It was a small narrow area for all the food to feed the whole place. Line ups were long and you're bound to crash into someone. They need to widen the aisles or use some sort of crowd control.  Or have another buffet station.   DECOR It's nice and classy. Somewhere that's good enough to go with your boss, but not pretentious..  SERVICE It was not bad. They took my dirty plate away in time for me to come back and get a clean one.  My water glass was never empty. And they were able to give us separate bills (if you wanted to call us that. he went around the table telling us how much we owed and we gave him money or a card). I didn't get the hot water I asked for though.   I did like how easy and friendly they were when I made reservations. They even called to confirm.   Price: $13.55 including tax for lunch $20.99 for weekends (not including taxes)  I'd come back again. It's not bad. Good selection of food. Could use more veggies though."}
{"text":"Worst AYCE ever! Poor quality, sashimi's were dry, sushi, rolls or the cooked food looked like it was from the previous day."}
{"text":"Omg. This is the worse food experience ever! Came here and made reservations ahead of time for a party of 13. We had to wait 1hr after our reservation time before we could even be seated. The place was so understaffed and the food was cold, lacking and just plain terrible. No server came to get our drink order. And it is so overpriced!! Never again"}
{"text":"Went here for a birthday and it was just okay.  They have a good selection of sushi including red dragon, green dragon, dynamite roll and several veggie rolls.  The sashimi was cut a decent size and there weren't excess rice on the rolls so you don't get filled up to quickly.  My favourite for the night was the spicy squid.  Although a bit salty, it was great with the fried rice.  It was very moist and not chewy at all.  The torpedo shrimp was pretty good as the shrimp was a decent size and not covered with too much batter that the shrimp becomes lost in it.  There were crab legs as well, with imitation butter on the side.  Overall, there wasn't anything that was outstanding that would make me crave to come back.  The food is decent for a buffet."}
{"text":"Having been to Sushi/Chinese buffets in the GTA Wasabi is probably one of the better chinese style cooking and variety in food. The sushi is another story with not as many special rolls and not all types of sashimi.   You do have to get up to retrieve your own food, which is good because you can select how much, how cooked and what you want instead of asking the server 10 questions about each dish.  The restaurant is also HUGE, good for parties and get togethers where everyone will find something they like.  The chinese food includes a noodle soup bar, seafood, and a range of chinese staples plus japanese dishes including teriyaki, tempura, yakitori.  Dessert is  nothing \"special\" has more variety then most.  But overall the problem is Wasabi doesn't do Japanese great or Chinese above par, both are just passable. If they focused on just one, their quality could beat quantity.  Overall the price of $25 before tax and tips could do more damage with some change left over at Prince Sushi across the plaza."}
{"text":"it's a giant buffet, how could you make it that good?  the tempura shrimp was actually pretty decent, other than that.......well you know."}
{"text":"Our experience here was terrible. My husband and I were staying at a nearby hotel and decided to have dinner and a movie. The interior of Wasabi is absolutely beautiful and the staff was very friendly and quick.  However, the food was absolutely horrible. Everything was cold. Everything except for the desserts tasted so bad that I wanted to spit it out the second I put it in my mouth. It was also incredibly expensive.   Do not be fooled by how nice this restaurant looks. It is absolutely not worth the $22.00 + drink per person."}
{"text":"Hmm. Its a nice estabishment aesthetically speaking and the waiters are polite, in my experience.   Food wise, I say the sushi wasnt appealing to me.. I've seen better executed ones and this was done poorly...and taste wise was okay. The buffet selection on the other hand, was surprisingly underwhelming..I did however liked some of the dishes but overall it wasnt top notch. It felt like I was eating in a regular food court...but less oily.   Do I recommend you going here? Well... Yes. To try if you like it. Because its not THAT bad to merit a bad review and there are worst places to dine in if you can imagine. But the price that was being charged I think doesnt go with the quality.   With that being said, am giving them a 3 star."}
{"text":"Here for lunch on mother's day.  Came early so it was not busy until close to leaving. Service was OK. 1.45hr   until they rush you out the door. 1.30hr, the bill arrived without asking. Then after a while, guy came up with the card machine to ask if i needed it, without asking.  I can understand being on holidays, but I hope they don't do that on a regular day.   The food was decent. Fair amount of selections, but 3 type of chicken wings? Lobster was not great, overcooked, same with the prime rib. Sushi and sasami were good. It was not filled with rice, good proportion. My favorite the spicy tuna did not have much kick to it. Little odd the entire dessert table had no tags at all.   I had been to the Markham location could times few years back and  there have been many changes. I was expecting more traditional Chinese items but was more closer to Mandarin.   It did exceed my expectations, and I would have preferred to go on a regular day, but I don't think I would be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"The rating description I had in mind (\"I've had better\") is unfortunately a 2-star rating; this place isn't mind-blowing, but it's definitely more than 2 stars. I'll highlight below the reasons I think Wasabi Grand Buffet is a solid 3-star restaurant.   Food: I love sushi and this place delivers. They don't have any crazy concoctions, but they do the basics very well. On top of the sushi they have a few other dishes (General Tao's, sweet n' sour pork, etc.); the reason I'm giving Wasabi a 3-star instead of 2-star rating is because they have dumplings and pork buns. FRESH dumplings and pork buns. This is a rarity at most buffets and is usually found at authentic Chinese restaurants, so the find was definitely very nice.  Servers: Super helpful and very polite. It's a buffet so there shouldn't be much need for servers, but the ones that are present are definitely an asset. Whether it's providing refills for drinks or meeting specific food restrictions, they jump to help. Also, the ladies are hot. That's always a plus in my books ;)  Ambiance:  The ambiance is very chilled out. It has business-y overtones, so it's a great place for company outings (which is how I came here). Very open seating area with enough room to move around without seeming cavernous.   I've listed all the good, now here's the reason Wasabi didn't score higher: everything here (minus the pork buns/dumplings) is a solid MEH. Nothing stands out as amazing, everything down to the dessert is average.   TL;DR: Solid average buffet that will not blow your mind, but will definitely fill you up and leave you satisfied."}
{"text":"There wasn't a lot of variety here. The sushi didn't look appetizing at all, so I skipped that entirely.  The good things about this place was the pho station. That was pretty cool, and the broth was not bad. They also had whole half lobsters but they were pretty overcooked and dry.   The crab legs were alright too. Pretty standard, but there are better buffets."}
{"text":"Do not eat here. I got sick from the food and it was a bad feelling. I warn everyone to stay away from the resturant. Please do not suffer like I did."}
{"text":"Not too bad. What I like about this place is the space, the utilization of the spacious-ness and the decor. Also, the concept is nice - a little bit of mandarin, a little bit of Ayce sushi and a whole lot of live kitchen.  Unfortunately, wasabi fails at food:  - the sashimi was not fresh... I could taste the \"off-ness\" and I am no expert. My dad, however, enjoyed it. But then again, little phases him.  - the dumplings didn't taste right. Neither did the gyoza. Mind you, it's also because I make amazing dumplings at home.  - some of the meat was rubbery   - tempura section was a massive fail: shrimps had too much tempura batter, squid tempura didn't taste good.  Wasabi also fails at service:   - the staff members don't really speak English. They probably don't understand it either. I asked for soy sauce - they directed me to hot sauce.   - the waiters are perpetually busy. In other words, they don't really care when your glass of water is empty and you're in need of a refill. Try reminding them twice. I agree with Vlad and Tasha - they forgot about our bill too.  - the staff members are not knowledgeable on the displayed items. The dessert counter was missing labels so I asked the woman behind the counter about one of the items. Her answer, you ask? \"I don't know...\"  What I did enjoy? - the well marbled medium rare steak - the sushi (not sashimi), house rolls in particular  - the format... It was different - the live cooking   My parents really enjoyed this place. Especially, my dad. I guess if you want something different in terms of experience, especially in comparison to Mandarin, this is the place. I'm keen on trying their adjacent sister restaurant - Chako."}
{"text":"Went on a Friday night and we were seated right away. Service is in line with other all you can eat places.  Usually I'm not too picky with food but about half of the stuff here tasted a bit bland. Some of the items that weren't bland were too salty. Some fruits were left out for too long so they didn't taste fresh. No complaints about the dessert portion that was alright.  I would visit another all you can eat place before this one if you are looking. Maybe Wok of Fame or Spoonful."}
{"text":"First time my family's been here since it's been renovated. Wasabi stepped up their game! Sushi had a good variety and you can request your own if you weren't satisfied with the selection. I would've gave it five stars if they had more variety in the hot food area."}
{"text":"i went there for a work lunch, it was OKAY, the food in the hot area was actually really cold, kind of frozen? the sushi is all reallly cold too, again frozen kind of? not the best place but its clean i guess and good for groups."}
{"text":"I must admit...I HATED this place since it opened. Always was terrible quality almost inedible food. But I just went recently. Their sushi bar was loaded with choices and they were actually quite good...especially for a buffet. Wasabi DEFINITELY stepped their game up."}
{"text":"Aighhhht, so i just ate a this place. The food was prettty darn good. I have no qualms about the food. They have a real sexy sushi bar with many different varieties of da kine. But what grilled me was the limitations of how much rib eye steak you're allowed to have.   My friend was being a total boss, totally giving it, like eating rib eye steak for breakfast lunch and din din lidat, except this was dinner time. That is to say, he ate enough rib eye steak for a normal person's breakfast, lunch and dinner. Pretty commendable right? I was and stil am very impressed by his eating fortitude. So eventually the owner guy said something along the lines of \"We still have 3 hours left and we need to save some, you can't have any more.\" And i was flabbergasted. If anything, you should feel honored that youR food was so delicious that it compelled my friend to eat so much of it. You shouldn't feel his 5 servings of rib eye was excessive. Rather, it is testament to how tasty your food is my man! So let the man eat! like Duh, he's inadvertently complementing you by eating your food cause its Good. He wouldn't eat it all if it was bad. Plus its a buffet and he's paying for it. Well whatever, after that we just moved on to crab legs which were meh.  Anyways, a decent sized buffet with nice sushi and a whole lot of other food. Nice desserts to. Everyone, if you do visit this place, be sure to eat lots of the rib eye steak just to show the dude you can! Geev um!  hahaha ;)"}
{"text":"Food was blah. Half of it was served cold because it was sitting out for a while. I'm giving it another star because of the service. Sooo yea. Hoorah to the good se"}
{"text":"The food was really good. I loved the salmon sushi but I didn't love the samon sashimi. I only really wanted sushi but there are a lot of other foods available. Not a huge selection of sushi but I did enjoy what I tried.  I went here on a Saturday night. It was really expensive. $64 for two people without taxes or gratuities. We didn't order drinks and the green tea isn't included fyi.  I also didn't like how you had to get up to get your own food. I like when it's brought to me. *spoiled* but oh well. :)  I am still searching for my favourite all you can eat sushi place in Brampton or Mississauga. Any ideas, message me!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's a change from the old *cough*mandarin*cough* and has some tasty food.  It's like Manchu wok, but bigger and with more options.  The dessert area is ridiculous as well.  Great tasting cakes and cookies."}
{"text":"Probably one of the worst AYCE place. They have specials like AYCE lobster but most of their other foods are not good. Most of their food are like warm or cool.  Didn't taste fresh.   The place is smaller than most places and lacks variety. There is a lot of fried dishes and some hot dishes and some sushi. Though they have a customizable noodle bar that allows you to choose and make your own noodles the place is not worth it at the price you are paying.   Extremely disappointed with this place."}
{"text":"Its ok AYCE sushi... nothing special or great dishes or types worth mentioning. Service is hit and miss for attentivemess and sending out the correct dishes as ordered."}
{"text":"Warning: it made my friends and I very sick after visiting, likely from the seafood that has been sitting there far too long. Absolutely do not dine here, unless you like spending over $30 to wake up 5am in the morning with terrible food poisoning."}
{"text":"Wasabi is ok. My favourite thing about wasabi is the soup station. You pick your protein, noodles and soup base and they assemble it. Best thing about wasabi and probably why I still eat here once in a while. The food is ok nothing spectacular. I've had better sushi."}
{"text":"So my office mates decided they wanted good Japanese food for lunch and somehow I got corralled into coming here.  I knew from my Markham experience that this place can be more miss than hit.  Compared to the other large Asian buffet alternative that rhymes with 'nandarin', this place actually was about the same.... mediocre selection, mediocre quality, and mediocre value.  The only redeeming item might be the slightly better atmosphere compared to most aging ' rhymes with nandarin' restaurant.  So the buffet quality is not great.   We arrived maybe 10 minutes before noon and the buffet was filled completely so I thought that might be a good sign of freshness.  I was wrong.  Most things there have been sitting untouched for a while.  The supposedly 'crispy' items were limp from sitting in the steam bath too long.  The veggies weren't crunchy and they were really soggy.  Teriyaki was really salty... it was as if they dumped an entire bottle of soya sauce in it.  The udon noodles were really too chewy.  The only thing that wasn't horrible was the salad items but that is no way to get good value as a customer.    As for the sushi area, it's definitely not as good as some AYCE places in Mississauga and that's saying something!  The sushi and maki is all about rice fillers and just haphazardly put together.  The sashimi didn't taste right and I stopped eating it after a bite.  It was way too mushy for a salmon sashimi piece.  It was either defrosted in a microwave or it's too old.    The only reason why this place doesn't get a total 1 star is because of the service.  Our server seemed a bit overwhelmed as she took care of many tables just clearing dishes and she seemed to be the only one.  I felt bad for her as she was constantly doing that while trying to appease a crowd of people demanding drinks.    Definitely avoid this place!"}
{"text":"Been here once and didn't like it. The decor was nice. Easy to accomodate groups and spacious arrangement. That being said it's a typical AYCE fare but food was seriously lacking. Everything on the hot table were lukewarm at best and it was slim pickings as fresh food was not being brought out. Some dishes were too salty. Tempura had too much batter. For buffet sushi, the sushi and sashimi was decent. Service was slow as well. Dishes piled up at the end of the the table and even though my party was able to communicate with the staff in Mandarin, they should definitely hire some English speaking people. Overall a less than subpar experience."}
{"text":"Very disappointed.  Went for my daughter's birthday and was surprised at how awful it was. We've eaten at the Korean place next door and loved that.   This was overpriced, low quality, grumpy staff, dirty and sticky washrooms. Sushi was mediocre and not a great variety.  A step down from Mandarin and that's not saying much.    They got us in the door once but we will not be going again."}
{"text":"I would go here for dinner only if you're interested in sushi.  The other items are lacking during dinner time.  For lunch, there is no ordering sushi from the menu, but there are lots of other small appetizer type treats, and chinese food.    The service is lacking, not as quick on the water as Mandarin.  And not quick to take your order for the sushi buffett.  This place is not cheap (dinner), I would recommend going for lunch during the week, its only 10.99, but dinner during the week is 20.99.  Dinner and lunch on weekends is even more expensive.    I really enjoy this place because they have pasta dishes, whereas Mandarin and King's Buffett does not."}
{"text":"Mandarin on steroids   . . .  is the best way I can describe this place. It's an all you can eat buffet style restaurant with a pretty decent sushi bar. They also have a grill where you can order things, I tried the grilled salmon and it was quite delicious. In fact my mouth is salivating a little while I write this. I highly recommend it. Other than that, they have so much variety of food there, that it is almost impossible to try a little of everything.   The Food is good  quality, and the décor of the place was really nice. The servers were attentive until it came time for us to pay. They gave us the bill and then completely forgot about us hahaha. My gf and I were tempted to just leave because no one would have noticed but instead we went up to the front and waited for someone to come around with the debit machine. I know, we deserve some sort of best customers award because damn, this place isn't cheap.   So if you have some money to spare and want to go to an upscale buffet place, this may be the place for you."}
{"text":"Very close to where the Fairfield Inn just opened about a month ago... it's literally a walking distance from the hotel and right next to McDonald and Turtle Jack.    Only thing really interesting about this place and what separates from the other buffets in the area is that this is Asian Fusion and not a typical Chinese buffet; there choices of steam snails and steamed rice with eel is very interesting to say the least. Larger selection of the sushi and sashimi and it actually tastes pretty good.  Their salad selection is weak but includes kimchee and seaweed salad.  I wouldn't mind going back since I ate tons of the steamed snails which is kind of hard to find in the area.. I would recommend that they include steam clams to their mix."}
{"text":"Ok, I see the latest review was written in 2011, so naturally I thin it needs an update since I am disappointed.. I have been in Wasabi Grand Buffet few times, last time around 6 months ago and it wasn't bad. However today, December 1, 2012...things looking not that great. They definitely reduced the food selection, in addition many dishes are not well prepared: teriyaki chicken was rubbery, the tempura shrimps were smelly, so were the cold (salad area) shrimps..just a very \"fishy\" smell.. Many items not labeled so you just stare wondering \"what the heck is this?\" The place was 1/3 full at 6pm and when I requested to be seated by the wall, at a corner table the waiter said \"that table is for when there are is a group of 8 people so we put two tables together. The place is gonna get full, very busy\". 5 minutes in our dinner and a couple comes in and is seated in exactly that spot I asked for. RIIIIIGHT.. But mostly I complain about the food/price. S I'm not ever coming back. Oh ya, we paid $61 for a couple, no drinks or anything special. Hehe. A year ago I would recommend the place, but today...NEVER. Stay away, they are going down and you don't wanna be inside when it happens:)))"}
{"text":"Sushi and sashimi are great (very fresh) Grilled garlic lobster was chewy Crab legs were grilled Muscles were fresh Escargo was steamed nicely but needed a bit of salt Dessert cakes other then the tiramisu were no up to par  The jellies on the dessert tasted old Nice handrolls  Since the new management we have noticed interior paintings, nice chopsticks, chocolate fountain and tableware are now missing replaced with disposable chop sticks."}
