{"text":"Ended up here for supper tonight. Was blown away by the quality and presentation of food. Had the special of heirloom roasted tomatoes with mozzarella and pesto... amazing. Coleslaw amazing!  Pork sandwiches delish. Don't miss the lemon curd dessert. Place is cute and staff were attentive without being in your space. They didn't say 'you guys' once, also amazing:).  You know you enjoyed a meal when you can't wait to go back and try other menu items."}
{"text":"This spot has only been around a couple months but I thought I'd give it a try. The setup is nice, vintage little white hexagon tiles, modern tables and chairs, a small bar in the rear, and several flat screen TVs. The graphic designer in me definitely appreciated their \"pig\" branding. Even the tile design at the front entrance reads out \"Oink!\" The server (maybe the owner?) was super nice and answered any questions we had. We went with the Porco sandwich (Porchetta) and some fries. Honestly I've had better but it was tasty. Almost didn't finish it cause it was so huge. The music selection was on point as well, a mix of mostly classic rock from what I remember. Definitely interested in seeing what they have for brunch."}
{"text":"OMG, I had the Cubano sandwich and it was sooo good! The portions were enormous had to take half home and it was not expensive."}
{"text":"Love the vibe of this spot! Waiting staff are very cool and friendly. Drinks are very tasty and the space is very nicely decorated. Everything in the space is new and sparkly so it's very enjoyable to be in.
As for the food, the porchetta is nicely seasoned, a but salty, but what do you expect...
I very much enjoyed my night here. They also have 4 flatscreen TVs with sports matches playing! Lol"}
{"text":"Ordered their chicken salad tonight through uber eats. So delicious...the dressing was perfection. Also went for brunch and everything was awesome. Milanese Benedict .... insanely good."}
{"text":"Porco is a nice new addition to the monkland restaurants ! They have indoor and outdoor seating and serve brunch, lunch and dinner. The service here is always so great and friendly , they really make sure you feel welcome and Taken care of. I've been here once for dinner and once for brunch and I did enjoy both but I think dinner was better for me. The prices aren't super cheap but aren't insanely pricey either they're just sort of on the border of the two depending what you get . My dinner experience was my favorite we tried the Cuban sandwich and the classic porchetta sandwich both had great flavour but the Cuban packs more flavour and excitement (also larger portion) while the classic is more simple and more about show casing the flavour of the porcettA and is smaller in size. One thing that could be improved on is that the sandwiches don't come with any sides at all you have to order separately. We shared fries and cole slaw as the sides , the fries were sooooo good great golden crispyness on the outside and really nice seasoning. the slaw was ok - it wasn't creamy but rather had a vinaigrette on it which I prefer but I found it had way too much dressing on it which made some bites way too bitter. Brunch was good I had the porcettA omelet and potatoes it was not bad and ingredients were fresh but it was packing a certain something to take it from ok to an exciting dish -it didn't blow me away. Their sweet options looked really good and may have been the better way to go. That being said I would come back for dinner or lunch and maybe if I'm craving something sweet for brunch. This place has great potential just some areas of improvement would be on the Savory brunch items and to have the sandwiches potentially come with a small side."}
{"text":"This restaurant is where the old Prohibition restaurant used to be on Monkland. However the place looks very different inside. It's white and brighter and just altogether more welcoming. 

This restaurant has been open for one month now. I read online that Porco started off as a porchetta sandwich stand at the Monkland street fest back in 2015. I had the special of the day which consisted of pork belly with a fried egg on top and marinated eggplant spread in a bun. The dish also comes with potatoes. My friend had the Milanese eggs Benedict. OMG this was good!! If I ever go back I'm going to order that! It's a breaded pork cutlet with a poached egg on top of focaccia bread with pecorino cream sauce. That sauce is everything!!! So cheesy!  I like it better than the traditional Hollandaise sauce. I even asked the waitress for more sauce so that I could dip my potatoes in it. The bloody Caesar was good so obviously I had two..

I highly recommend their brunch. The food was delicious! Especially if you like pork, you must go!  They also have chicken and vegetarian options at dinnertime for those who do not eat pork. 

The staff is friendly. I would want to come back and try their dinner menu. This resto also has tables outside so if it's nice you can eat outside."}
{"text":"Lovely little restaurant for brunch. Their potato and porchetta hash is to die for! However, it is very greasy and on the heavy side and I don't recommend having just that. If you are a bigger group, you may want to order a plate to share, or if you have the option of upgrading your breakfast potatoes, definitely considering swapping them for the hash! 

I had an avocado toast that was so beautifully presented I felt bad eating it. My husband's porchetta sandwich was jammed pack with porchetta and a little on the heavy side. 

Overall, I enjoyed my meal."}
{"text":"Bien satisfaite en general mais Ã  mon gout personnel je trouve la deco un peu froide. Mais avoue que le blanc beige eclaire etonnement ce sous-sol. Je recommande le burger porco tres gouteux ."}
