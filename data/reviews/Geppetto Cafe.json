{"text":"We came for a Saturday lunch, placed our order and waited. At the half hour mark, the server said it was coming. At the 45 minute mark, the host came to apologize and comp our order. At the 50 minute mark, the server said that they'd just put our lunch on the grill. 

The food was tasty and I appreciate the fact that they didn't make us pay for our food. It was the right thing to do in the situation. But why would we come back if we have to wait almost an hour for them to even begin to make our order?"}
{"text":"Enough options for vegetarians. Really good challah french toast and the portions aren't overwhelming. Coffee was really good too. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive - the small talk with them wan't forced or awkward. The lighting goes well with the white walls (painted exposed brick rather than the standard red).  I think they might have room for a few bar stools for single diners, but I didn't see any. I was happy to see that they stick to french toast, waffles and crepes without trying to offer too many diner style sides. So much better than a place like Waffles Incaffeinated!"}
{"text":"We were in town visiting relatives for Thanksgiving and we were looking for a place to eat breakfast and my daughter recommended Geppetto Cafe.  What a great experience.  Very eclectic decorations--hanging books above the tables, exposed walls painted white, and other items with  an industrial feel to it.  The restaurant is thin up front and opens in the back a bit.  Our waiter said the weekends are really packed, so plan accordingly.

Their menu is perfect if you like a nice variety.  There are savory and sweet crepes as well as paninis.  While we did not try it, they also have a wide variety of coffee drinks and gelato for dessert.

We tried two different savory crepes, the Ham & Cheese and the Love Hate Thing.  The Ham and cheese, well it had both on it, served with gruyere cheese and a honey aioli.  We added spinach (and they have tons of other choices you an add to any dish or create your own crepe from scratch).

The Love and Hate Thing crepe was smoked turkey, goat cheese and avocado with a Béchamel sauce (Béchamel sauce, also known as white sauce, is made from a white roux and milk.)

Of the two dishes, I have to say that I liked the Ham & Cheese better because of the combination of flavors.  We went the Sunday after Thanksgiving so I might just have been tired for turkey, but I think the goat cheese was a bit overwhelming.  

All the savory crepes are served with a side salad which was also yummy.  All table are provided a free bottle of water, other drinks including the aforementioned coffee cost money.

I can't wait to get back to the Burgh to visit this place again.  There are a ton of other crepes to try and maybe a few paninis too."}
{"text":"A perfect combination of great tasting food, using good ingredients, a reasonable prices, with great flavor combinations.  I've eaten here several times now and I'm still excited when I get to go.  Highly recommend!

This is going to sound very particular, but there bananas are perfectly sliced.  i really don't know how they do it.  Maybe one day the uber friendly staff will show me their trade secrets!"}
{"text":"Great little cafe in Lawrenceville. The menu consists of an amazing amount of crepes which are both savory and sweet! They also have quite the selection of challah French toast.  The tiramusu crepe was quite the treat. So delicious and the perfect size for the price. They also serve Turkish coffee! I can't wait to try their other crepe selections!"}
{"text":"Cute and welcoming place. I had a savory crepe while my friend had a sweet french toast, perfect to share!
Great coffee and attentive service. I'd love to come back and try something else!"}
{"text":"Very nicely decorated cafe.
The food and drinks came out very fast and prices are reasonable. Very clean and friendly.  Nice selection of tasty menu items. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food was great! We tried the Troy and Gone Fishin crepes and the Smoked Turkey panini.  The people were friendly, but it took a while to get our food.  It was worth the wait, but a few people who came in way after us were served first. :(.  We'll definitely go back the next time we're in Lawrenceville."}
{"text":"Excellent food and an inviting, relaxed atmosphere! My sister told me about this place when I was visiting and it did not disappoint."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late brunch for the first time and am in love! Small and adorable, and the staff were very attentive & helpful. Got the Nutella crepes (which were amazing) but actually ended up envying and eating hubby's Croque Madame. Good coffee too! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"The crepes were delicious, loads to choose from and the coffee was great. Surprisingly I favored the salad that comes with all the crepes. My daughter ordered a strawberry shake which was not to sweet and had chunks of real strawberries."}
{"text":"This place is truly a special gem with a lot of charm. From diversity of the menu choices , the wonderful choice of lattes ,coffees and teas , the decor all combined with the friendly staff made this one of our favorite brunch places! The only thing that I would have to say was a problem has nothing to do with the restaurant itself.....It's the parking"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly staff. Some of the best waffles - just sweet enough, just fluffy enough. Crepes were great. Panini good. Attentive servers but hiccup in kitchen caused one of five meals to come out way late. Grill is open to restaurant and could use a bit more ventilation."}
{"text":"so far the BEST crepes ever in Pittsburgh sweet or savory don't matter if you didn't taste yet try that place you won't regret it! DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing and a must try for breakfast or lunch when in Lawrenceville. It is always crowded and they do not take reservations as an FYI.  The menu has the perfect mix of sweet and savory. I always go for the sweet and love their decadent crepes-they also have French toast and you can change any of the crepe options for waffles.  On my past visit I split the Tiramisu crepe with a friend.  It came with whipped cream, lady fingers, strawberries and cookie crumbles. I also wanted  a savory crepe and went with the Bonjour which had scrambled eggs, bacon (comes on top), and brie cheese. The savory crepes all come with a salad (except for the Bonjour which is served with fruit) that has a very tasty, light dressing on it.  The entrees look beautiful, taste delicious and are a hearty portion.  This place also serves ice cream and many coffee/tea drink options. They are BYOB and have the cutest décor inside."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, ambience was wonderful, service terrific! Can't wait to go back! We shared a sweet and savory crepe so we each could experience both. There are small Pinocchio  figurines in the walls, and books dangling from the ceiling. Creative sayings throughout. All in all the perfect, eclectic little gem of a restaurant!"}
{"text":"Not a fan. Slow service. Did not cook eggs to order. Included a main ingredient not listed in description of item. Only one coffee refill.  Do not recommend."}
{"text":"This is my first time coming to Pittsburgh and the first restaurant or even place I've been to since I got here!!!! What a great start to my trip! The inside is SO CUTE!!!!!!!!! And the menu has such an amazing variety and super good coffee!! It's also super cheap! I highly recommend"}
{"text":"If ur looking for a European, cozy, rustic cafe shop for eating / good coffee, this is the place you should go on Butler st. Staff is amazing and very kind. Food is delicious/fresh. Must try."}
{"text":"I ordered food for take out on a hangover weekend mid morning. 
The cafe is adorable and the staff was super friendly! 
I ordered the Sriracha Chicken Panini and Iced Coffee. 
My panini was perfect! Honestly, it was simple, warm, crispy, spicy, and delicious! It came with a tiny side salad and some house made dressing which was a great balance of vinegar/oil and spices. The iced coffee was also great. I was worried they might throw some sugar and cream in there but thankfully they didn't. I like my coffee like Dale Cooper from Twin Peaks does \"Black as midnight on a moonless night.\" I got a menu with my order and looked it over and am very excited to go back and try some crepes and tea from Gryphons tea is always a plus too. After all, what is so wrong that can't be solved by a nice cup of tea?  
Overall this place is a great addition to Lawrenceville!"}
{"text":"This place is great for many reasons-- the staff are friendly, the space is lovely, the service is quick and kind. I ordered a plain waffle with mixed berries and a side of bacon. Also a cafe americano. the coffee was good. the berries were delicious and fresh. but the central piece-- the waffle-- was really bad. Like much worse than any frozen waffle I had in my youth. It was dense and doughy and tough. There was nothing light or crispy or fluffy or flavorful about this waffle. And it should have been the star of the show. And, most disappointing, was that no one asked about my experience or seemed to wonder why I left 3/4 of my waffle on the plate with many pieces separated with a knife yet not eaten. I wish this business wanted to learn and improve... if they did, they would ask customers what they could do to be better."}
{"text":"Crepes are one of my favorite breakfast/brunch items and I feel like there aren't enough places serving up crepes in Pittsburgh. I'm happy to see more are opening up, like this one! Geppetto Cafe is in the heart of Lawrenceville alongside all the other hip eateries. The environment is modern yet spunky. 

My husband and I each got crepes (of course).  We decided to both choose from the savory variety; he got Ham and Cheese (Gruyere) while I got Prosciutto (with mozzarella). Both had a honey aioli, making them quite similar. Obviously the meats and cheeses were different but the flavor profile was the same, only the prosciutto was a bit more salty than the ham. I would say the honey aioli definitely took these crepes to another level. It added a sweetness that balanced the saltiness of meat and cheese while also adding a bit of moisture to cut the dryness of the crepe. The savory crepes came with a salad, which was a nice, fresh element. 

The food, service, and decor were great. My only complaint (and it may be a bit nit picky) is the really strong smell of smoke or burnt food as soon as you step in. The grill is right at the entrance and while it is nice to see the folks prepare the food, the strong smell of smoke not only left me smelling like that the rest of the day, but it really irritated my asthma while I was there. Otherwise, I would definitely come back to try a sweet crepe and hope for a table outside!"}
{"text":"I'll start my review the same way as a lot of others on here. I really wanted to like this place. The menu looks amazing, unique, and a fun mix of savory and sweet. The staff is wonderful and the decor is beyond adorable.

However. :( The coffee menu could offer some more unique choices. The lattes are just vanilla, caramel, etc. I think they could make some interesting house syrups. I got a chai, and it wasn't very good. It was way, way too foamy and very weak. Warm cinnamon milk.

The menu had so many interesting things to choose from. There were so many things that sounded overly sweet though. I wanted something savory, with maybe a little sweetness. I ended up getting the smoked salmon crepe. Maybe I don't enjoy salmon as much as I thought, but the flavor of it was overpowering. It could have used a LOT more cream cheese. Or maybe an onion/herb cream cheese. Less salmon, maybe more capers and some tomatoes. I really didn't enjoy it but I ate what I could.

I really want this place to work everything out. I liked it immediately, but it could use some changes. I'll definitely give it another shot and get something sweet next time."}
{"text":"Went with my girlfriend today, it was overall pretty good! Service was a little slow, but the food was really good. I would highly recommend the Geppettos Signature!"}
{"text":"Great location, friendly staff, good coffee, fast service, they have Internet too. Don't know what you like but for me these are great for a weekend brunch! I do recommend the paninis. Will go back"}
{"text":"Hands down favorite brunch spot in pgh. The crepe plates are all so good! The decor is also very cute. We love bringing out of town guests to this spot; very charming with something for everyone."}
{"text":"Unreal crepes and milkshakes. Wish I could have multiple items on the menu, I'll need to go back. The service was excellent, the meals were fresh and offered up quickly. BYOB. And a whimsical / delightful atmosphere that is refreshing in the Pittsburgh food scene."}
{"text":"Great crepes and atmosphere! Friendly and efficient service. I love the decor! Had the super veg crepes and hubby had the apples cinnamon crepe! Delicious"}
{"text":"What can I say, other than that Geppetto Cafe is wonderful! This cozy little shop makes a variety of sweet and savory crepes, and all of them are superb. They also serve up waffles and French toast (made with Mancini challah bread), plus salads and panini for people who just aren't craving some breakfast/brunch food. Plus, milkshakes! It's a fantastic spread of options, making this place a great go-to for a group with a variety of tastes. I've never wanted to order off-menu, I love the cafe's recipes so much - but if nothing strikes your fancy during your visit, there is also the option to make your own meal.

No matter what you get, you're promised fresh and flavorful ingredients, and so far I've been able to taste that promise always being kept! All of my meals here have downright delighted me, from the Bella crepe (with mushrooms, spinach, and goat cheese) to the Nutella Classic crepe (piled high with Nutella and fruit). Although I must say, the Chicken-and-Gruyere crepe has surprisingly been my favorite thus far - surprisingly because I have quite the sweet tooth. But with its tender chicken, caramelized onions and melted cheese, this is one savory crepe that I can't resist! Plus, the savory crepes come with a side of field greens topped with cherry tomatoes and vinaigrette - they're perfect to share if you aren't quite hungry enough to take on these delicious but enormous concoctions. (The sweet crepes come with whipped cream, in case you're wondering.)

The decor adds to the delightful charm of the place, by the way - books are strung from a tin ceiling, while wooden marionettes and tiny potted plants hang on one of the walls. I always feel welcome when I arrive, and I always leave full and happy. I highly recommend this darling little eatery to everyone, and by the way, can you take me with you when you visit it?"}
{"text":"Really fresh and good!! Crepes were light and fluffy--filled with eggs & brie. French toast was delish! We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and delicious food! We went for brunch and they had a wide selection of crepes, French toast and paninis! The bill was also nice because it had the calculated values for 15% tip, 18% tip, etc I had the house of crepes crepe with an egg on the inside. All savory crepes come with a side salad which is also good. My friend had the raspberry goat cheese French toast which was also awesome. 10/10 will go again."}
{"text":"If you guys searching for a cozy place to hang out in your breakfasts or lunches, there is no other place but Geppetto! The owner of the place greeted us very well. The crew inside was just amazing. We got their famous french toasts and it came like in the commercials ! 
Shortly, it is a blessing for us to have you guys in here !
Thank you so much again for your hospitality."}
{"text":"No idea how this place has a 4.5/5 star rating. I am afraid now if people in Pittsburgh think this place is any good. Probably the most overrated breakfast spot in Pittsburgh. The smoothies are disgusting, the coffee cups dirty and the crepes mediocre. Will never come again. Recommend b52 instead of this place, b52 is 4.5/5.0 not this place"}
{"text":"I just had the best waffle in a very long time over here. It's shocking to me that I've walked past this place many times, without realizing the amazingness within. 

I tried the banoffee waffle, which came with bananas, walnuts, and chocolate syrup. This was excellent. Filling, sweet, and rich without being overwhelming. 

I'm also a big fan of the decor and the usage of space. Although a rather small dining area, the establishment definitely makes the best of it with the seating arrangement.

Lastly, say what you want about me, but I'm a fan of the tablecloths. I think that they really fit well with the overall feel good atmosphere of this restaurant. I mean, they serve crepes and Belgium waffles. 

 Bonus tip: check in with yelp while you're here for a free coffee"}
{"text":"Yes... just... yes. 

The paninis and savory crepes here are really delicious. I got the Italian Job crepe and added ham. All of the flavors blended so well together. They also give you a small amount of salad with a very interesting vinaigrette dressing. 

The house coffee is also very yummy, but it also made me super jittery haha I guess a lot of caffeine or something! Not a bad thing though. I just don't drink coffee like that?? IDK. 

One thing I was disappointed in was the slow service. We finished our meals in half the time it took them to give us our food after ordering :/ And it took a while for our waiter to come back to take our order after he said he would come back. I kinda watched him (lol) and he stood there idly for a little bit."}
{"text":"I had the loveliest accidental solo Sunday brunch at Geppetto a month or so ago. I woke up on a blessed weekend off and found myself hankering some pancakes. I was on my way down to the Strip when I realized that I needed cash for where I had in mind, so I parked right in front of Geppetto to stop at the nearby Citizens Bank. For whatever reason, Geppetto felt welcoming right at that moment, so I skipped the ATM and ambled inside. I settled in at a window table and received the friendliest service with a spot-on recommendation for the chicken and Gruyere crepe, which was accompanied by a light mixed greens salad and accented by a spicy Sriracha-based sauce on top. I happily lingered over a book and my coffee (refills for days) as the summer sunshine poured in. Will definitely be back with friends for future Sunday brunches!"}
{"text":"We came here on Christmas Eve so it wasn't crowded and we were seated almost immediately. The interior towards the front is really cute and quirky with books hanging from the ceiling. However, we were seated in the corner near the bathrooms with sub-par lighting. 

My friend got the Nutella Classic crepe. She claimed it was way too much chocolate to the point where her crepe was simply drowned in chocolate. She also felt that the crepe was a bit too thick. I got the Universes Favorite challah french toast with strawberries and marscarpone. I enjoyed my french toast as the marscarpone cut through the sweetness. It also paired nicely with my Nutella hot chocolate. 

This place was comparable to Cafe Moulin in Shadyside. For crepes, I would visit Cafe Moulin but for french toasts and other breakfast-like options, Geppetto is the place."}
{"text":"Always brunchin'!! Cute, little cafe in the East Side of Pittsburgh. I'm always on the hunt for cafes or brunch spots, and Gepetto's was great! There was a little bit of a wait, but that's understandable for the time of day, and its size. Everyone was friendly, and considerate! It was not anymore expensive or inexpensive than the standard restaurant or cafe. The offer a great variety and selection of food and treats! They have both sweet and savory foods that can satisfy anyone! I cannot wait to stop back, and try some gelato"}
{"text":"My buddy took me here a few weeks ago for lunch, and it was fantastic!  First of all, it's in a great neighborhood.  Parking was alright on a Monday afternoon.  The staff working that day were friendly and helpful.

I ended up getting the Prosciutto crepe.  Fresh mozzarella, prosciutto and honey aioli?  Amazing.  It tasted so fresh, and the meat was obviously good quality.  It was savory and sweet and delicious.  Also,  it was so filling.  The iced tea I got with it was alright, the price was right, and my friend loved her meal too.  Awesome spot!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite places! We don't pass it up when we are in Pittsburgh! Food is delicious, atmosphere is wonderful and service is awesome. It's really a can't miss for brunch when you are in town!"}
{"text":"I went against my normal savory breakfast and ventured to Geppetto Cafe for a fancy waffle.  I ordered the Geppetto Signature waffle (can come in crepe form as well).  It was a waffle stacked with a cream cheese maple spread with some backed cinnamon apples on top and if I am not mistaken, a little drizzle of caramel.  Holy Moly!  All of those flavors were amazing together.  The waffle itself was perfectly cooked and the portion and ratio of topping was just enough, not overwhelming.  There is a lot going on on that waffle, but it all worked.  

Side Note:  We did order the bacon side.  it was a little wimpy for the price. 

Also, don't forget to turn over the menu for the French toast options."}
{"text":"Great new little breakfast spot coffee was great as well as my challah raspberry goat cheese French toast... Love the decor books hanging from the ceiling and cool lights. Friendly servers too. Only suggestion, don't serve coffee mate coffee creamer with your fresh coffee!"}
{"text":"Been here just once - mom's day, wanted to do something special for Mom that she hasn't done before. I'm definitely going back! The interior is funky/quirky, we found it fun. The service and staff is relaxed and the staff is happy - always a great sign. Started with coffee, high test and low octane - both wonderful. Mom had a crepe with salmon, cream cheese, capers etc. I had the Italian with a side of 2 eggs. Mom requested very light on the cheese, and that wish was complied with perfectly. She raved about the taste of the smoked salmon. My Italian crepe was wonderfully flavorful - really super pesto, nice mozzarella, veggies were all perfect. These are by far the best crepes I've had in Pittsburgh - light, good body, excellent tasting! Food was healthy, and not greasy at all.  This place was highly recommended to me, and I can see why.  I have a number of other items I'd like to try - waffles, pannini's, and more- as I said, I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"We eat breakfast here almost every Sunday. Everything is great, I always go for the crepes. You are able to customize them if you don't see a particular topping combo you want on the menu. They also serve la prima coffee which i love! The staff is so nice and friendly. Quick service. Definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"My favorite Crepes place around Pittsburgh! I've only been there twice so far but everything turned out great! We had the chicken + cheese and the others sandwich that I forgot the name. Everything was GREAT! I can't express how much I like them. And I don't think you can go wrong on anything there. The only think I can complain about is the waiting/check-in system. They always had a line and they will take your name when you get there and call your name when there is a table ready. BUT since this place is kinda modern to me and I think they should update this to let people get in line electronically upon arrival like get on Nowait.  It will save there time and make customer happier also look good for the store since the entrance area is very small, usually it would only take four people to block the whole entrance. It would be fine If it is summer that people can wait outside, but in the winter, I'm not staying outside... anyway, great place great food and I love it!"}
{"text":"Isn't it funny how some of the best meals you ever eat are served at 'Blink-and-you'll-miss-it\" gems? Geppetto Cafe is a good example of that.

It'd be a shame to pass by this welcoming little cafe and never step in to try it out. They specialize in Crepes, and for VERY good reason: the crepes here are both huge and loaded with exceptionally fresh ingredients.
I ordered the Gone Fishin' Crepe, and I fell in love. Delicious Smoked Salmon filled the enormous crepe, as well as capers, caramelized onions, and cream cheese. And the London Fog Latte I had with it was one of the best lattes I've ever had... And trust me, I've had A LOTTA lattes!
The decor lives up to the cafe's namesake: Several pinnochio marionettes adorn the walls, books dangle from strings from the ceiling, and a tiny Geppetto figurine sits in the window to welcome passerby.
Last but not least, the waitstaff was warm and attentive. The people here make the cafe as inviting as can be!
I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great brunch place and addition to the Lawrenceville area. I was having my car detail done on an early Saturday morning and stumbled upon this place while walking to the local area library to wait it out. Glad I stopped in. This place has really great breakfast and brunch food, whether it be the waffles, crepes, paninis or coffee. I ended up getting the Universes Favorite Challah French Toast and I have to say, I really loved it. Fresh fruit, great taste, reasonable price. They also give you the option of making your own if you want as well! Savory crepes that are of note include the Love Hate Thing and the Chicken & Gruyere Cheese with that lovely kick from the spicy sauce that they use on it (I only know from the recent Yelp Elite event). Sweet things of note include the Cheesecake Waffle and Nutella Classic. Their drinks here are also decent as well (I'm looking at you, coffee lovers). There's a decent amount of seating and the ambiance within is really warm and welcoming with tables of different sizes to accommodate different party needs (small/intimate to mid-size groups, maybe one large table in the back). It is worth paying a visit here ... you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"This is the cutest hole in the wall! We came for brunch on a weekday and it wasn't too busy. Our server was nice and attentive. We both ordered sweet crepes: the Nutella Classic, and Geppetto Signature with a side of bacon. The crepes were delicious! The bacon was a little greasy but still tasted good."}
{"text":"We had a splendid time here: great food, wonderful  service, plus a charming ambience. 

You have a choice of savory or dessert crepes, or the opportunity to build your own. Everything we ordered was delicious, plus the prices are reasonable.

There's a European flair to everything, along with books hanging from the ceiling as decoration.  I wanted to yank down a few to read, but fortunately I was kept in check.

Great options for vegetarians are available. 

Besides the crepes, I ordered a smoothie that was terrific."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time for brunch today. The store is super cute and cozy, and service was very attentive and friendly. We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table for 2, not bad for 11:30am on a Saturday. I ordered the chicken and gruyere crepe which was really good. The homemade spicy cause was creamy, tangy and delicious. It complemented the caramelized onions and cheese well, and the crepe was just saucy enough to not be dry. I will definitely order it again! My boyfriend got the Love Hate Thing, a savory crepe with turkey, goat cheese avocado and bechamel sauce. He substituted salmon for the turkey. Unfortunately, I think the goat cheese made this crepe too dry, and the bechamel sauce didn't add enough flavor or moisture. Generally, I would stick with gruyere or mozzarella in a crepe anyways, seems like the crumbly cheeses are too dry for crepe fillings. Both came with a good mixed greens side salad. I'd easily give the Chicken and Gruyere 5 stars, but the Love Hate Thing earned 3 stars at the most. You can also make your own crepes, but it seems really pricey to do so since each veggies is about $1.50, each meat is $3, cheese is $2 and sauces are $1 with the base price of each crepe $4. So making my Chicken and Guyere would have been $11.50 instead of $9.50. Also, the Turkish coffee was too watery but the drip coffee was good. Will definitely be back to try more crepes, hopefully saving room for a sweet crepe next time!"}
{"text":"Ricky Bobby might've refused to say it, but I'm going to shout it from the rooftops... I love crepes!

I mean, who doesn't love a warm little blanket swaddling their favorite sweet or savory treats?  Those non-believers can't be trusted, I'll tell you that much.  Geppetto Cafe is amazing.  As I waited for my prosciutto crepe, I remarked to my dining companions how the ambiance made me feel like I was on vacation.  It's located right in the middle of one of Pittsburgh's most up and coming neighborhoods, but this quaint cafe removes you from the hustle and bustle. 

I felt like I knew the staff for years, they were so warm, cheery, and welcoming.  And fast!! My beautifully garnished crepe was in front of me before I knew it and it was nothing short of heavenly. I don't dabble in sweet crepes, since I'm not big on sweets to begin with... but I was so thrilled with my order that it made me want to order one of everything off their menu!  I'm looking forward to coming back again and again to work my way through their artfully crafted menu.  They surely know what they are doing here, are passionate about their food, and it radiates from the moment you walk in the door.

Fun fact:  the owner and his partner had a hand in all of the construction of their beautiful space, including the stunning wood floor, made from pallets!  Hence, they named it after the wonderful co-star of Pinocchio, Geppetto the carpenter!"}
{"text":"My tiramisu waffle was incredible. The fresh strawberries, the cookie crumbles, the perfectly made waffle- I loved it and devoured the entire thing. However, I didn't love the chicken and gruyere crepe as much as I had hoped. It was kind of dry and flavorless. I would have loved to have seen a cheese sauce on top. My boyfriend had the Monte cristo and also thought that it was just missing something. I am thinking that this place may specialize more on the sweet items, and that's fine. Now I know to stick with the sweet breakfast items when I return again. The ambiance is really sweet here- books hanging from the ceilings, little Pinocchio characters hidden in the walls. It's very charming and cute. Definitely a must try in Lawrenceville."}
{"text":"We went late, around 2pm on a Saturday, and thus were quickly seated. The staff was unusually young. Our French waiter was quite nice and attentive. Brought us coffee and water quickly. The menu was filled with a large variety of delicious looking sweet and savory crepes and French toast. I opted for the ham and gruyere cheese savory crepe with an egg added in for starters. The crepe itself was soft and flavorful, and the honey aioli was the creamy sweet complement that put it over the top. I probably should have stopped there; my stomach even warned me so. But I followed this up with their Banofe crepe, covered with walnuts, bananas and chocolate sauce. This was a sweet overload for someone who hasn't been eating too much sugar in recent months. But all the same it was delicious. These were nearly as good as my crepes at Little Breizh's in Paris.

I wasn't thrilled with my seat as there was a broom closet behind me that the staff occasionally had to enter. But it was a cute place, and the the three staff members we spoke with were all very hospitable. I highly recommend if you're looking for a good creperie."}
{"text":"Very good. I had the merry berry waffle and my fiancé had the classic Nutella. We each had a side of bacon. The bacon was thin cut and super crispy. Delicious. The merry berry waffle was tasty, but a little heavy. Definitely needed the fruit to balance out each bite. We are looking forward to going back and trying some other options. Cute place. Good service."}
{"text":"Was able to check out this gem before I moved. This is just what Lawrenceville needed! I love a good savory crepe. I tried the \"Love Hate Thing\", the bechamel sauce is so good and really completes the crepe. The side salad served with it was a nice addition as well.  I also got a latte, which was delicious and came with a cute little heart in it. My friend ordered the \"Nutella Classic\", really great sweet crepe.

The staff was very friendly and helpful with the menu too.

Will definitely be coming back to try more when I come home to visit!!"}
{"text":"This is a cool small shabby chic brunch, coffee and dessert bar with a Pinocchio theme.

I ordered a chicken panini with saracha sauce, it was delicious and came with a salad!

I then ordered the Apple Tree French toast with apples, Carmel, and cinnamon cream, DELICIOUS!

The only draw back is they close in the afternoon,  they need to stay open late night!"}
{"text":"The crapes here are so yummy, I got the super veggie and was not disappointed. It had fresh spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, and feta cheese. The crape was warm, soft, and light, my order also came with a side salad and homemade Italian dressing. 
The decor was nice and modern with a twist of European influence."}
{"text":"Small in seating space But Large in food quality. Had French Toast with Fresh Strawberries. Sooo goood. Waitress smiling, greeted us at door and let us seat. Parking can be a problem. You must be looking for it or you could miss Geppettos. But Don't.  Thanks to Yelp we found a great place for brunch. We be back"}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch with my mom after a doctor's appointment. The interior of Geppetto's is so cute and well done. The menu is a great selection of crepes, sandwiches/paninis, and salads. We both ordered from the panini selection and I was very satisfied with my meal! The sandwich was accompanied by a side salad with a vinaigrette dressing. This is a great place for breakfast or lunch. You leave feeling like you ate just enough and didn't over-indulge...although if you wanted to go big, you can always follow your meal with a dessert crepe! I hope to try one of them on our next visit!"}
{"text":"What a quaint little cafe. We stopped here originally just for a coffee before we go next door for a movie at the Row House theatre. We walked in and we're surprised to see it's an actual sit down cafe with a wide variety of food items. We did not have time to eat, so we ordered a Dirty Chai Latte and a fruit cup. The fruit cup was overflowing with obviously fresh blueberries, strawberries, pineapple, and other fruits. 

Although we didn't get a chance to experience the full menu, we already decided to check it out later once we have more time."}
{"text":"Geppetto Cafe is a great (but tiny) brunch spot on Butler Street. Their menu includes crepes, waffles, and french toast with a wide variety of topping options, sandwiches,, and salads. The spot is really cute--sort of an eclectic & urban-rustic-chic thing going on. 

Their waffles and crepes are both particularly awesome, with plenty of savory and sweet options. If you don't like one of the combinations they have on the menu, you can also build your own. Really like the Super Veg crepe, which is filled with feta cheese, spinach, tomatoes, mushrooms and just a little bit of bechamel sauce. Served with a delicious side salad, it was an awesome brunch choice. Their waffles are dense and sweet, with well-carmelized exterior and chewy interior. Their eggs and bacon are both excellent.

Their coffee options are also delicious and a step above a few other local breakfast spots. But. But. The only \"cream\" option they serve with your coffee are those awful little coffee creamer cups. I can't think that small pitchers of actual half-and-half would be that much more difficult to serve.

We did have some service issues during early visits where it took quite awhile to get our food, but they seem to be getting better. It's probably wise to assume it will take a bit longer than normal to get your food, though."}
{"text":"Delicious crepes, with savory and sweet options. Fresh, delicious produce was used for our meal, and the atmosphere was modern, clean, warm, and comfortable. A simple place to enjoy delicious brunch, with plenty of options for vegetarians and meat-eaters alike."}
{"text":"We waited 40 minutes for the food to come out. Then they forgot a whole crepe. Messed up another one. Put in more crepe makers and this place would be much better. The coffee was good but you couldn't get a refill. Also the crepes are awesome. The problem is entirely the service.

--edit
Gave this place another shot today. The food is still great and the service improved dramatically. It seems like there is way more staff or maybe the staff just changed and got much better."}
{"text":"Walked in as I was passing by the shop. The aroma was great so I walked in, happy I did. The coffee was fantastic and the food was even better. Very homey environment, very nice staff, everyone is lively and very easy to approach. The atmosphere is very relaxed. Nice environment for almost anyone if not everyone. 10/10 would recommend to anyone! Support local business."}
{"text":"Delicious crepes and great service, the only thing negative I can say is that I wish they were open earlier."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot!! I love their crepes and coffee here. It's quite small so sometimes the wait is king to be seated but it's totally worth it! The ambiance inside feels like your in the Pinocchio movie itself. Super cool and a great place to snap some photos while you're enjoying your meal."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I order take out from Geppetto every Saturday and Sunday. It's THAT good. I always get the s'mores French toast which is AMAZING. I don't think we've ever had a bad experience or any problems with the food. Everyone should definitely give this place a try. It's one of our favorite food spots in Pittsburgh! I rarely leave reviews but this place is too good not to leave a review for."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore Geppetto Cafe. I have yet to have a bad experience there and I've been there on some of their busiest days (which are weekends, mind you). 

The staff is ALWAYS nice and the crepes are always delicious. I recommend the Gone Fishin' crepe. I usually get mine without the cream cheese but instead, with honey aioli. The smoked salmon, caramelized onions, capers, and the sweet honey aioli really make for an AMAZING combination.

My partner usually makes his own crepe with fruit and Nutella. I love that there is the option to build your own or to pick from their specialty crepes and waffles!"}
{"text":"Well I was a little disappointed after leaving Geppetto Cafe today. I had high hopes for this place after reading other reviews. 

First I would like to start by saying I really did love the decor of this place. I can easily be swept in by rustic interiors and industrialized fixtures. It is a rather small place and I wouldn't say it's a good place for large groups. 

I think the menu has a lot of nice options, savory crepes, sweet crepes, waffles, french toast, etc. You can also build your own crepe or waffle starting at $4. Personally I wouldn't go this route because it can really add up with all the different topping selections. I ended up spending $14 on my crepe and orange juice (not including the tip). Had I had a better experience, I would consider returning. 

For my meal I ordered the Bonjour crepe. I really did enjoy this. However, the menu was very misleading. It came with a side of fruit and this was extremely small. Also, at the top of the menu it says \"All savory crepes come with a side salad\", but when my crepe arrived 40 minutes later there was no salad on the plate. In my opinion, 40 minutes for a crepe to arrive is a little out of hand. 

I noticed as I waited for my food the place started smelling of grease. It got to the point where the workers turned the fans on and opened the back door. Needless to say I left cold and smelling like a grease ball."}
{"text":"Wow!! This is the place for a great breakfast/brunch!  Four of us came for what we hoped to be a good brunch on a gloomy, overcast day in Pittsburgh. All four us left feeling gluttonous yet incredibly content and wishing we could eat more.
 
Three of our oders came with a small, crisp, fresh salad dressed perfectly with a dressing I wish I had bottles of. It had a light, citrus flavor that made us all eat the salad even though none of us planned on it.
The french toast sandwich with bacon egg and cheese was a great blend of sweet and savory - from the slightly sweet bacon, to the hearty eggs with their slightly runny yolks (at my request), layered with a bit of smoked Gouda that married the flavors so well. This was layed between two slices of warm, fluffy, delicious french toast. It was wonderful.

The chicken and Gruyere Cheese crepe was very good. It had carmelized onions and their own spicy sauce, but it wasn't spicy; it tasted like a very good, balanced combination of ranch, buffalo sauce, and ketchup. It's not a combination I would have ever used, and I could be wrong about what it was, but it worked. 

The Bonjour crepe consisted of scrambled eggs, brie, applewood smoked bacon, served with a side of fresh fruit and syrup. It didn't last long enough for me to try a bite but the fussy eater that ordered it assured me that it was fantastic. 

We puchased Geppetto's signature crepe for the table and that too was incredibly satisfying. Sauteed carmelized apples that were sweet, but not overly so, a light cream cheese glaze, a healthy sprinkle of cinnamon, and a touch of caramel sauce made it a breakfast treat that I want to order again soon...and I don't even like caramel. 

The iced tea needs to be bottled and sold commercially. It was that good. 

The house coffee was okay, but there were several other coffee options to choose from too.

The service - excellent. Truly friendly, helpful, attentive and engaging. The server was always there for whatever the patrons needed, but didn't hover over any of the tables. The overall atmosphere was laid back, welcoming, and just comfortable. Everyone loved it and can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for espresso and also got a savory crepe (spinach, tomato, hummus, and goat cheese) and it was great.  Biggest problem this place seems to have is that there were too many good options on the menu.  Will return."}
{"text":"We had the troy crepe with spinach, hummus and carmalized onions. Came with a nice field greens salad with champagne vinaigrette dressing.  Yummy.  They have lavendar tea and my husband had a latte that he really liked.

People are friendly and personable."}

This place is great"}
{"text":"I was so impressed with my experience here and look forward to coming back! Great food, great service, and relaxing, welcoming décor with walls full of local art.

The place is small, so expect a little wait and you'll be just fine. Good food is worth waiting for! They not only take your name, but also your phone number, so go shop at Wildcard down the street until the \"Table is ready\" call and everyone wins!

I obsessively stared at the menu on my phone before arrival and again when we were seated. So many options. Savory and sweet crepes, French toasts and paninis. I finally decided on the Chicken and Gruyere Cheese crepe with a side of eggs. The crepe had caramelized onions and a homemade spicy sauce. (I'm a huge baby when it comes to spicy stuff, but my server assured me that I would be able to handle it.  And she was right.) I was worried that I would still be hungry after, because how filling can a crepe really be? That was certainly not an issue. I probably could've taken half home, but it was so delicious that I decided to just go for it. I also had a bite of my friend's Eiffel crepe- Brie cheese, walnut, maple syrup & whipped cream. I'm not big on sweets for breakfast but YUM! 

This place is going to do very well in Lawrenceville and I suggest you go check it out!"}
{"text":"Cute little find! I loved how it was decorated, with books and umbrellas hanging from the ceiling! There were multiple items I wanted to try on the menu, but the waitress suggested the Geppetto Signature crepe! Glad I picked it. I have a sweet tooth and it hit the spot. I definitely plan on returning to try the S'mores filled French toast.  

The wait wasn't long for a Saturday. It was around 25 mins, but we were called back around 20 mins. The service was good too!"}
{"text":"I had the Bonjour and it was best crepe I ever ate! It came with a side of fruit which was extremely fresh. My wife had the Apple Tree French Toast she said it was wonderful as well. The staff was pleasant and courteous and kept our cups full of fresh coffee and by the way they  brought us water without asking which is important to me.        

The atmosphere was cool and offbeat. It seems to me that they were able to turn an old store front into something really unique while maintaining much authenticity."}
{"text":"Delicious!! The best crepes I have ever had. I have been here 2 days in a row and tried their 'Chicken & Gruyere Cheese' crepe and 'Apple Tree' Challah French toast (cream cheese glaze, caramelized apples  and cinnamon) and my boyfriend had the Tiramisu sweet crepe. So yummy! They have a cozy atmosphere and very fun decoration.

Our server was friendly and the service was pretty fast even on a Saturday morning.
Oh the coffee is top shelf too. They have got all the espresso selection.

I can't wait to go there again and try more stuff. Great breakfast/brunch addition to Lawrenceville. I definitely recommend this local place to everyone."}
{"text":"My absolute favorite place in Pittsburgh. Not once has the raspberry & goat cheese french toast failed me."}
{"text":"Best Crepe I've had! I wasn't sure if I wanted to go savory or sweet but I decided on the Classic Nutella and I'm so happy I did!! My boyfriend ordered The Cookie Monster and he absolutely loved it! Tasted like you were eating an actual cookie. The coffee is also really good. Cute little place! Our bill only came to $20. The art and decorations are really awesome and different! They have a lot to offer on their menu. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I visited Geppetto last weekend with my boyfriend. We were happy to get seated right away, since it can be hard to get a table for brunch in Lawrenceville. My boyfriend had the french toast, and added an egg and bacon. I had the salmon crepe and added a dippy egg and bacon. They have pre-made crepes, as well as a make your own crepe, however I found that once I totaled up all of the items for my possible make my own crepe it got pricey, so I decided to go with the pre-made salmon crepe. I was also hoping there would be more options for breakfast style crepes as well, (with eggs in them) however there was only 1 \"breakfast crepe\" on the menu. 

Everyone was very nice there, but I could tell that they are working everything out still with being such a new restaurant. Our food arrived and they seemed to have had a mix up with my boyfriends eggs, or forgotten them, so he had to wait for them to be cooked. It only took a few min, so not a huge deal. My salmon crepe was good, however it was a little dry. It had a cream cheese in it, and I agree with one of the other reviewers on here that said the dry cheeses don't seem to work as well in the crepes, at least without some kind of sauce on top. The dippy egg helped a little. It came with a side salad and I added my side of bacon. I hate to say that the bacon was horrible, but there are some really good butchers around here, so I have to say it. It was super, super thin and greasy. Next time, I would forego adding it on. Some people may like it that way I suppose, but I prefer thick cut bacon, this bacon was falling apart because it was so thin. My boyfriends french toast was good, but he had the same comments about the bacon. My crepe was pretty large as well. My boyfriends french toast was a decent size, but nothing crazy.

We will definitely be back to check it out again, I foresee them working out a few things and overall becoming a nice addition to Lawrenceville."}
{"text":"what a pleasant find- stopped for lunch on a monday when most restaurants  are closed. so glad I did. good fresh food, cute little neighborhood place."}
{"text":"Heavenly. This place is deliciously unique. There crepes are delicious. Such a unique little hole in the wall restraunt in Lawrence ville. The atmosphere fits the food, the staff is wonderful, and food is great. I would I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit here, because as a night owl normally they are closed, but on Sundays they are open until 4pm so I was excited to finally try it out!  My crepe (the Nutella Classic) was very tasty and was served fairly quickly.  The waitress checked to top off my coffee (always a plus as a caffeine fiend).  The interior has a cafe feel to it and local art for sale on the walls.  Definitely will add to my list of possible brunch date spots.  

Reasonably priced - coffee was $2.5 and the crepe was about $8."}
{"text":"French toast with strawberries was amazing. Mascarpone cheese makes it 

Needed a side of salty maybe hash browns as side but that wasn't an option"}
{"text":"Geppetto Cafe is a quaint little place to visit.  It's not too big or too small though.  Upon reading a suggestion on Reddit my boyfriend wanted to give it a try.  They have sweet and savory waffles and crepes.  I really couldn't pass up have a sweet one with cream cheese inside among other things with raspberry sauce on the top.  Everything on the menu sounded divine and the smell in the place is divine.  They also had ice cream and the staff was super friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"This place is so quaint and cute! I love the feel of it. The menu is super selective so you'll have a hard time choosing what to eat. Me and my friend chose \"sweet crepes\" which was the Cookie Monster and Ice Ice Baby. My crepe consisted of Biscoff cookie butter which is my kryptonite!! The fruit that came on each of our crepes were fresh and so sweet! The food was delicious! This place is now on my go-to brunch spots. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is chill and welcoming. Good selection of music. You walk in and can pick your own seat. Overall, I absolutely loved this cafe. First time here and it won't be my last!"}
{"text":"I split the veggie goat cheese panini and the mushroom goat cheese crepe. It was ok. The coffee was bad tasting. I did not take more than 2 sips. The \"fresh\" orange  juice was a small bottle of Tropicana places on the table, so my husband returned it. I looked around at the sweet crepes and saw those fresh whipped cream squirts. They looked like the fluff of fake rediwhip. I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed going to Gepetto and am equally as excited for the next time I go! We were seated and things didn't get off to a perfect start. We did sit there for a few minutes waiting to be noticed (they were extremely busy). Once we were noticed, the staff was incredibly attentive and helpful!

I ordered the chicken crepe with Gruyere, caramelized onions and a spicy sauce! I don't eat crepes too often so I wasn't sure how filling it was going to be! I was stuffed! The crepe also came with a side salad that offered a good brightness to the dish that was certainly welcome! The crepe itself was perfectly thin and the filling was hardy! My friend got the monte cristo and really enjoyed it as well! Also, the prices were incredibly fair! Both of our meals were around $10 each! I was really impressed with the food and it was adorable inside!"}
{"text":"First experience here this morning, espresso was delicious and the c food was divine.  Great atmosphere and great service!  Will recommend to others and be back!"}
{"text":"Literally some of the best crepes I've ever had in my life. For comparison: I've traveled to Paris and Marseilles in France and also had crepes in NYC and along the east coast. It's one of my favorite breakfast foods so I'm quite picky. 

I was visiting a dear friend in PA as an overnight pit stop on a long road trip and as a treat she suggested this place before I continued on my journey. 
You guys... LISTEN if you are *ever* in Pittsburgh you've GOT to try this place. 

Just walking into this place I was delighted with the whimsical decor and the tantalizing smell of roasting coffee combined with the universal comfort of the scent of dough frying. 

And then the food came out. A picture is worth a thousand words, but the only one I could think of was \"yummm!\" 

Bonus: excellent and friendly service"}
{"text":"The environment was very friendly, and the \"Love Hate Thing\" crepe was to die for. I'm still thinking about it a day later!"}
{"text":"I was expecting to be blown away. Completely. This was a brand new restaurant. With crepes. In Pittsburgh. The small city that has its roots in the crude steel industry; but the small city that recently began to experience a major cultural and culinary boom. I was sure Geppeto was gonna be part of that. It was even in Lawrenceville, the heart and major happening point of said boom. Alas, it was good. But it is a prime example of the disappointment (albeit a small one) of setting one's hopes too high. 

The crepe was the Chicken and the Gruyere. It was a good morsel. It even satisfied my crepe longings but it didn't leave me longing for another taste. The decor is acceptable with its much-publicized books hanging from the ceiling, rugged brick and plaster walls with nooks with Pinocchio puppets, and VW bus graphics. Huh?

Oh well, in the end, I would still tell anyone to go here. And I bet it will improve with age. But maybe my slightly unfulfilled expectations along with Geppeto's undeniable quality is proof of just how great Pittsburgh has really become."}
{"text":"If you have a sweet tooth than this is the best place to get brunch in the Pittsburgh area. They have a cafe menu as well which is a dream come true for me. I think every brunch place should have an espresso machine and full coffee bar menu but that's another story. They have the place decorated very whimsical with books and umbrellas hanging from the ceiling. Kids would love this place. It is small but that's part of the appeal. The menu has a variety of sweet and savory products. I tried the stuffed french toast and was blown away. I can't wait to go back and try the tiramisu crepes."}
{"text":"Sam our super-friendly waiter both made and served the food which was creative, delicious, and beautifully presented. Great atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place and sadly I was very disappointed. When trying to decide between a savory or sweet crepe I went with the bonjour savory crepe because it said \"all savory crepes are served with a side salad\". After waiting 40 minutes for our food to arrive we realized we had never received a side salad as the menu stated so I asked my waiter. He explained to me that the particular crepe I ordered comes with a side of fruit so they don't give you a side salad and apologized that their menu was confusing. I was a little irritated that I just waited 40 minutes for a crepe and you couldn't offer someone a side salad that your menu clearly states they get. On top of that they opened the back door right behind our table on a day it was 30 degrees so we had to rush to finish and pay our bill so we could leave because it was so cold. 

I went here really thinking I would be coming back multiple times to try all of the different menu items I was interested in but I have to say after that experience I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Not only does this place have amazing food, but their style is exactly mine. I love the books hanging from the ceiling, and the earthy yet cozy feel. It's the perfect brunch spot for a rainy fall morning. I ordered the prosciutto crepe, which had gruyere and honey inside it as well. It was the perfect balance of savory and sweet, and the crepe itself was amazing, too! The crepes are light, fluffy, but not greasy. Their coffee is decent as well, and you get nice large cups! I highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"I wasn't a huge fan of the food (but I know a lot of my friends enjoyed it) but I liked the quirky decor - it felt like an experience just eating there even though the food wasn't my usual style. 

It's an \"insta worthy\" restaurant in terms of decor"}
{"text":"I love this breakfast spot in Lawrenceville. They have a great menu filled with crepes, paninis, and French toast. You have to get here early on the weekend, this place gets crowded and it might take a while to get a table.  The food is amazing. I got the build your own crepe, and modeled it after their pesto chicken panini. It was amazing and came with a side salad. The food is priced right and the service is great. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great brunch. I had the crepe with bananas and walnuts. Amazing. My daughter had the berry crepe. The espresso was amazing. The ambience is  wonderful and feels like you are in fairytale.  Very  cozy and friendly."}
{"text":"The staff is very friendly and the service is excellent. Everything we had was delicious. We had crepes. We started with the \"Ham & Cheese\", \"Gone Fishin'\" and the \"Bonjour\". For dessert we had the \"Geppetto Signature\" and the \"Eiffel\". My favorite was the Ham and Cheese and the Geppetto. All of these crepes come as waffles option as well. Everything was so good that we couldn't leave without ordering something to go. To go, we ordered the Cheap Date, Eiffel, Nutella, the Cheesecake, the Italian, the Ham & Cheese, the Super Veg, and the Bella."}
{"text":"One of the best crepes and gelatos I've had, such an underrated Cafe on Yelp in Pittsburgh. 

We ordered latte and I got the savoury crepe. They could definitely work on their latte as it's a cafe, but the crepe was absolutely amazing. I devoured every single bite of it. our server was nice but we had to put in some effort to get her attention.

Must try their coffee flavoured gelato!! Super creamy and flavourful."}
{"text":"Had some really nice crepes and cappuccinos on a recent weekday morning. Service was appropriately attentive, and the food was tasty and very filling. We tried the ham and cheese crepe and the veggie and cheese one, both with an added fried egg. If you want a runny yolk, though, let them know! They will default give you one with a firm yolk. The ambiance is nice for a casual date or friendly chat! Umbrellas from the ceiling are a cute touch but might work better in solid colors."}
{"text":"I totally enjoyed Geppeto Café! The customer service which is so important to me is completely on point. And I also love how hipster this joint is--with the books and umbrellas hanging from the ceiling! LOVE IT! The crepes are amazing and I encourage everyone to check it out. I tried out a few of their crepes. And they are so oh so delicious....my fave was the Bella filled with a delightful mushrooms and cheesy love, with some other heaven favorites. And Gone Fishin'...I love salmon and they truly struck a chord in my soul with this one. And for your sweet tooth, the Universe's Favorite....strawberries and mascarpone cheese....nuff said. 
When I am around in the area again, I most likely will be back for the Gone Fishin'....my new found addiction!"}
{"text":"The food was more like four stars, but the service was really slow.  We waited 45 minutes for our food and it wasn't crowded (I got the Italian Job and my daughter got a waffle with Nutella).  Took maybe ten minutes to get a coffee order in.  That just isn't good enough to make me come here instead of Pamela's.  Also, it is weird to me that they have fancy coffee options but give out little creamers instead of real cream.

I hope they figure out their service problems because this place could be really good and the neighborhood really needs a great breakfast place."}
{"text":"We just ate a late breakfast here on a Saturday. Oh my gosh it was decadent and yummy. The boyfriend got the Bon Jour crepe. It had egg and brie in it, with 3 pieces of bacon and maple syrup on top. He literally cleaned his plate. 
I got the Eiffel crepe. It was filled with melted brie, then covered in maple syrup and walnuts, with whipped cream on the side. Seriously the best crepe I've ever had. It was earthy, sweet, crunchy, absolutely perfect. 
We sat at a table where I could see the food being prepared. They weren't just slapping a bunch of food on a plate and rushing it out to you. They slowly and deliberately added the ingredients on the plate, making sure it was beautiful and tasty. I watched a chef adding cut up tomatos to a sandwich (panini?). She placed each piece one at a time, spread out on the sandwich. You can tell they really care about their food.
We will definitely be back! A true gem in Lawrenceville"}
{"text":"Geppetto is the most perfect place I have eaten at in awhile. I have been bored with food lately because I get into the same old habits of going to my regular places. My buddy insisted we go here for brunch one day, and I happily obliged. The decor is immediately noticeable. It's warm, charming and comforting. I'm trying not to use the same words David B. (Hi David) used, but it's true. Everything from the dangling books to the little lights on the wall, polka-dot tablecloths and menus, is perfectly adorable. I feel like I should dress up to come here just to match the cuteness.

With that said, Geppetto doesn't just deliver on aesthetics. The food is hella good too. When I say it is some of the most delicious food I've had in awhile, I am saying that as a person who has dulled tastebuds and pickiness about texture. I have lots of NEEDS when it comes to what I eat, and nothing I ate here disappointed me. 

The three of us ordered a variety of dishes so we could all share, some sweet and some savory. Collectively we ordered the Troy, Chicken and Gruyere, The Geppetto Signature and one other I seem to be forgetting. The Troy was surprisingly more delicious than I expected, because I didn't think hummus would be good on a crepe. I was wrong. It was satisfying and flavorful in the best way. The signature was of course, perfect too. 

The staff here is also phenomenal. They are kind, not intrusive, quick, and attentive. What more could you ask for? 

Geppetto Cafe is magical, and I hope it is here for a long time to come. I'm not sure I can live without it now!"}
{"text":"Wait went fast, quick service and delicious beautiful crepes ! I had one with Bananas and walnuts and was not disappointed !"}
{"text":"Words cannot describe how delicious this place is. The venue is affordable. Eclectic, 1950s diner vibe, decor is adorable and comfortable. Lighting is great. A great place to meet a friend. Bathrooms are clean, coffee is DIVINE (seriously), the staff is super friendly and very attentive (but not annoying), and overall the whole experience was just lovely. We cannot wait to come back here. Seriously, go. 

Also, they were the only brunch place open on Mondays, when most of Lawrenceville is closed."}
{"text":"My friend and I shared the Chicken Gruyere crepe and the Merry berry waffle, both were absolutely amazing, great salad on the side and super friendly service! Good cappuccinos also!"}
{"text":"This quaint cafe in Lawrenceville is the place for bomb crepes and killer cappuccinos! The Bonjour is a delish combo of breakfast goodness crepe-style as is the Gone Fishin', a wonderful mix of salmon, cream cheese, dill and fluffy crepe! An excellent selection of both sweet and savory crepes to enjoy keeps me coming back for more! They also have a great selection of paninis and their staff is always friendly! Get some!"}
{"text":"This place is super cute!! We got the chicken and gruyere crepe as well as the tiramisu crepe and tiramisu milkshake. The chicken crepe is really good, but I wish there was more filling because it felt kind of sparse. The tiramisu crepe was pretty good, but the milkshake was AMAZING. Oh my gosh I would come back literally just for the milkshake. 

We went in the afternoon, so it wasn't too crowded and we were seated quickly. My only issue was that the table was kind of sticky and probably hadn't been wiped down beforehand. 

Still a great restaurant, and I'm probably coming back for the milkshake at some point."}
{"text":"Finally, I came here. Finally! Chris has been coming here since they opened and is a regular. When we opened the door he was greeted warmly. They remembered his coffee order and what his usual food order is. It was hilarious. I always knew he came here a lot, but I didn't realize it was that much. We live close to the Cafe but with me usually working weekends I have not been able to make it to eat. Chris on the other hand apparently made friends. For my first time I was impressed. I love the space. I liked the books hanging from the ceiling and I liked that the place just looked bright and clean. Their food was also amazing. The service was also really nice. I feel like we got seated right away and they kept an eye on us the entire time. 

Savory Crepes:
For my first time here I went with the Prosciutto Savory Crepe: Fresh Mozzarella, proscuitto, and honey aioli with a side salad. I ate half. It was that big and that stuffed full of goodness that I could only eat half! It was a perfect blend of cheese and meat. The only suggestion or change I would make would be to ask for a little less of the honey aioli or maybe ask for it to be put on the side. While good, it sometimes took over the taste of the entire crepe. I would suggest this to anyone visiting in the Lawrenceville area. 

Sweet Crepes:
Nutella Classic: Nutella, fresh strawberries, banana, and whipped creme. This is the one that Chris ordered. He, weirdly asked for less nutella. I mean who does that? I would usually say, \"Please sir, can I have some more nutella\" but he said that it sometimes overpowers the crepe so less is still enough. I will say, he was right. Whatever amount of nutella they put on that crepe was good. The strawberries and bananas were so fresh and crisp tasting. Nothing frozen about them. The whipped creme was also really good. It held up and was super refreshing when you would, lets say, dip a strawberry hunk or banana chunk in it. YUM. This crepe we did finish. I say we because he let me eat about 1/4th of it. I just couldn't help myself! I had my savory crepe and then had to eat some of his for dessert. 

Coffee Selection:
Iced Carmel Latte: Yum. Brewed to perfection. Not overly sweet and no weird burnt taste of coffee that I have had some other places. 

I am looking forward to my next weekend off. I want to come back and try more of the menu. I will probably go for another savory crepe (since I know Chris will go for a sweet one). I am now looking over the menu trying to plot out my next brunch! 

I really enjoyed my time here. It was quick and easy to get in and out and the food was really good. I ended up eating my crepe the next day for lunch. Totally worth it. Yum!"}
{"text":"Cute and casual place to just sit alone or come with a friend! A great selection of sweet and savory crepes - got a savory crepe with goat cheese. My only qualm was that it was dry and didn't really have much of a kick. Might've just ordered the wrong thing... But I'll have to try it again to give this place a full review."}
{"text":"I should start off by saying I fricken love crepes, like could eat them every day and not get tired of them kind of love. So I was very pleased to have been able to enjoy an elite event here (boo on me not knowing about Geppetto's existence).

So since then I have been there two more times and have fallen in love with them even more every time I go.

So crepe wise, you can choose between savory and sweet crepes. I tend to actually go for both, just depends on how hungry I am and my mood. My two favorite savory crepes are the Ham and Cheese and the Love Hate Thing. The ham and cheese consists of ham, gruyere cheese and set off by a wonderful honey aioli. The Love Hate Thing consists of Smoked Turkey, goat cheese, avacado and a bachamel sauce. 

My favorite sweet crepes are the Eiffel and the Tiramisu. The eiffel is absolutely wonderful. It has brie, walnuts, maple syrup and a wonderful homemade whipped cream. the tiramisu consists of marscapone, lady fingers, strawberries, chocolate and whipped cream. 

They also have challah french toast. The only one I have tried was the smores. It had marshmallows, nutella and graham crackers. It was delicious!

The service is also absolutely wonderful and everyone is always so nice and helpful!

If you are ever on Butler, I absolutely recommend stoping here!"}
{"text":"This place is so unique with its décor. I never really ate crepes before, but these are really good. there menu has a nice mixture of sweet and savory selections. I particularly liked the savory crepes with the meat. I had a chance to sample several of them and my favorite one was the chicken and gruyere cheese. This was excellent. I really liked the spicy sauce that they used in it. You also have the option to create your own as well. The salad that accompanied it was great too...an added healthy bonus :)"}
{"text":"This place is a great new addition to Lawrenceville! Nice mixture of industrial/ playful decor that makes the place inviting. Had the raspberry and goat cheese French toast, which was absolutely amazing, and my wife had the turkey, avocado, goat cheese crepe, which is also great. Was also impressed with the quality of the potted coffee since I'm usually an espresso only person. Only minor complaint was the amount of bacon we got for $3. Was delicious, just not very much. Overall very pleased, we will return."}
{"text":"This place was amazeballs. First of all, I love all things crepes and waffles and brunch, so this place is right up my alley.  They have such interesting mixes of flavors for their savory crepes and their sweet crepes are delicious too.  
I went here for a Yelp event, but the servers were very friendly and attentive.  I can't comment on how the service normally is, but I\"m sure they don't suddenly become rude.  I can't wait to go back to this place and eat. 
Everyone should try it."}
{"text":"If I were the blue fairy I would make Pinocchio's nose grow for that misrepresented check in offer. Instead I'll deduct a star. When you check in the offer pops up with a build your own crepe starting at $4.00 as opposed to the menu where it starts at $4.50. I showed this to my waiter who told me that it starts at $4.50. When you go to redeem it just calls their phone number.

Nevertheless onto the food itself. It serves paninis, crepes for both breakfast, lunch, and dessert along with waffles. You can order a premade one right off the menu or like I did build it with you favorite items. I choose chicken, various vegetables, and a not too spicy topping. All lunch menu items come with a side salad. The crepes are huge but very good.  The crepes are fresh and made well. It is quite filling that unless you are very hungry don't expect to be able to finish more than one. They also serve sweet crepes with nutella or other toppings you would enjoy for a dessert.  There is a pay parking lot nearby along with bike parking.

It has a charming atmosphere with books hanging from the ceiling and Pinocchio is there to greet you when you walk in along with his story book."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was very laid back and the food was Great! I had the Merry Berry crepe with chai latte and the were delightful!! Lots of berries and super creamy with the whipped cream and Nutella. The only thing I didn't care for was that it was fairly hot in the restaurant."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try this place based on the reviews and the menu. Arriving we found the atmosphere perfect and the menu very promising.

Unfortunately, the meal did not meet the promise. I had the Apple Treat French Toast where the caramelized apples appreared coated in seasoning but not caramelized, apples were almost raw. The French Toast was soft on the outside, barely toasted and not cooked through. The seasoning barely discernable.

My wife had the Cheesecake Waffle with Raspberr covered in blueberry syrup. The waffle was doughy, not fuffly, not crunchy, a very dissatisfying dish.

We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Had a nice visit to Geppetto Cafe for brunch after church today. Like other new businesses in Lawrenceville, it is a tad small and there are only about 7-8 tables in the place. We had a darling little one by the window (sorry, had to let my inner grandma say it). Service was decent and I had the \"Universe's Favorite\" crepe; strawberries, mascarpone, cinnamon, whipped cream. What's not to like?? The only thing I found strange is that I asked for an iced tea and my waitress brought me a bottle of green tea. I didn't say anything about it being incorrect. After reading other reviews about it being fairly new, they are doing a pretty good job. Giving them a few months to work out the kinks, better train some wait staff, and fix the typos on the menu should get some higher stars at this place."}
{"text":"Such a cute cafe and a great spot for brunch in Lawrenceville! It can be crowded on the weekends, but I've never had to wait too long for a table if at all. Service is consistently good, and your food comes out pretty quickly for how busy they tend to be. 

My favorite items on the menu are the Love Hate Thing (the smoked turkey savory crepe) and their French toast is amazing. However, nothing I've had from here has ever been a disappointment."}
{"text":"Great place.  Small but very unique.  The crepes are awesome!!  So was the French toast and the Monte crisco.  Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The crepes from Geppetto Café might be my new obsession! I decided to Postmates some brunch as a mid-day treat for myself. They have so many amazing options that I was actually staring at the menu for close to an hour before I could decide. Of course the golden rule when you can't pick one thing is you just order them all (that's how it goes, right?)

Starting with a savory crepe, I went with the Troy which is filled with hummus, feta, caramelized onions, and spinach - absolutely amazing! The sweetness from the onions paired really well with the more savory hummus and feta. The only critique would be to add more hummus because more hummus is always better. All the savory crepes come with a small side of mixed greens as well for some extra health. 

Of course I can't have a savory crepe without a sweet crepe to follow. They have some crazy dessert crepes with fruit, nutella, caramelized apples, you name it. I decided to keep it simple and go for the Cheap Date which is just a plain crepe topped with butter, brown sugar, and whipped cream. Really quick and simple but sooo delicious."}
{"text":"I have been here 6-7 times (prior to the Yelp event) and have always had super yummy food and great service. I have a couple of favorites:
Chicken and gruyere cheese crepe
Italian Job crepe
Banoffe sweet crepe
Raspberry and goat cheese French toast
Also the Nutella milkshake is to die for I tell you.
If I could eat here on a daily basis I'm sure I would. Definitely a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"The service here was great and since we arrived around 11:00 we were lucky and didn't have to wait.  So why only 3 stars?  It started when we sat down and the chairs are quite literally the most uncomfortable chairs I've ever sat in at a restaurant.  The menu looks great but the fiood is merely average.  The latte and chai latte looked great when served, but the latte was too strong and the chai latte too weak.  I had the Love Hate Thing which was completely overpowered by the turkey, not nearly enough avacado, and actually a rather bland meal.  It's not that the food was bad, I would eat here again, it's just not anything special.  So many good places in Lawrenceville, maybe it's just me, but I don't see why this place is getting so many rave reviews."}
{"text":"Pros: the folks working are nice, and the  place isn't overly busy. The latte was ok. Outlets available.
Cons: music is a bit loud, latte is just ok. Latte had only one size."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely amazing. I would highly suggest the Raspberry and Goat cheese challah French toast. The staff were kind and quick, and the place was very, very clean. Very trendy spot, especially popular with the college crowd. Very nice neighborhood."}
{"text":"The Pinocchio theme creates such a cozy and creative atmosphere with books, umbrellas and wooden toys hanging and placed with intention throughout the cafe. I am always indecisiveness at breakfast always wanting something salty and sweet and they have just that with their french toast sandwiches! They gracious subbed mushrooms for meat to tend to my vegetarian needs. Delicious looking crepes and french toast options as well."}
{"text":"A fantastic balance of sweet and savory. The sweet comes with the French toast options. One bite of the apple French toast and I was sold. The crepe selection is inventive and savory.  The coffee is amazing even a generic cup is phenomenal. The bathrooms are the real problem styled with stained tiles on the ceiling and smelling of wet dog I would suggest finding other options. The seating is super strange. The bar style kitchen has taken most of the front area and patrons are placed in the back behind the kitchen. The BYOB part did make me very happy. So if that description fits your weekend plans, go with the brunch group and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Not a french taste- like restaurant. The flavors are wat too American. I'd never go again also because the greasy cloud that covers the place makes me feel sick/disgusted right after eating. One more thing I have to say is the owner is a poker face and rude as well..."}
{"text":"Cute place, very clean and brightly lit. They have a great selection of crepes that a lot of people seem to enjoy. Had the apple cinnamon french toast with cream cheese and some caramel drizzle. The presentation of the food was very nice and made it look huge!. Great taste and filling .had a cappuccino and it was very good. Price was worth the  serving size. Bacon was very thin but had good taste. The staff here were all super nice and helpful. I'm glad I stopped by to try it out."}
{"text":"J and I decided to take a stroll through LVille and stopped at this cute place for breakfast.  We loved everything about this place.  Service was quick and everyone was so pleasant.  Our food was banging! J got the Challah French toast with bananas, a side of bacon, and house coffee.  I ordered the make-your-own crepe and filled it with salmon, avocado, tomatoes, spinach, feta cheese, and honey aioli, with a house salad (complimentary with crepes) and peppermint tea.  Everything was so delicious! The atmosphere and décor were great.  We loved the industrial look with the exposed duct work and corrugated sheet steel on the walls.   We will definitely be frequent fliers at this cute spot!"}
{"text":"I pretty much fell in love with this place from the first visit and have been back several times since. The staff are super friendly and attentive. The atmosphere is quirky casual; random and eclectic things decorate every inch of the restaurant, from the cute umbrellas and books hanging from the ceilings, to the little metal carriages that hold the salts and peppers, to the large Banksy painting by the bathrooms. If you enjoy crepes, they have great options for both sweet and savory tastes. The merry berry is my regular choice; Nutella + berries + the GOOD whipped cream = BEST! The coffee is also fantastic; great cappuccino (and they serve it with a cute tiny whisk!). I've been a repeat customer for months now and definitely don't plan to change that! Definitely one of the gems of Lawrenceville."}
{"text":"The food was great, We went for breakfast. Service was good with one exception. If you are going on a Saturday, get there by 10:30 am. Food was awesome. Had the french toast with bananas, sweet cream, and a side order of bacon. Clientele are mostly hipsters with a sprinkling of seniors, and famlies. You won't leave hungry. The interior is funky but still having some of the original decor from the 1900\"s. On street pay parking."}
{"text":"JUST PERFECT!  what an amazing experience it was! I was just driving by and saw that place and I was starving so I decided to go in, but to be honest I went in not expecting much! but they literally made my day! the food was really fresh and the portion was just the way it's supposed to be! the staff was very friendly and I met the owner guy, he seems like a really good person and made me feel like he's happy to have me there, I definitely will be back,  I'd give them 10 stars if I could,  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"Interesting idea to have a crepe restaurant in Pittsburgh, but disappointed after visit. My partner had the \"bonjour\" which did not blend well and was tasteless. I created my own crepe with avocado, bacon and mozzarella but mostly tasted the clumps of mozzarella that were not melted and the strange taste of the crepe.  The service was slow and unprofessional. We left unhappy with our whole experience."}
{"text":"It's one of the many coffee shops in the hipster neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Lawrenceville. Its deco is really cool, with books and colorful umbrellas hanging from the ceiling, little bikes on the wall, Pinocchio's characters everywhere. 

The food it's okay but not an amazing experience. We had a mixed green salad, a savory crepe of the sea and a caprese panini. The cappuccino was too foamy and the coffee too sweet.

What tainted our experience was the strong grease odor in the shop and the not-so-welcoming service."}
{"text":"The restaurant is warm and inviting. The lighting is unique and brightens your dining experience. We were seated in the back and unfortunately the door was open causing a draft. Thankfully, the staff was quick to address the issue when it was mentioned. Overall the staff was attentive, but busy, leading to an average service experience. Not bad, just not great. There are a wide variety of menu options to fit any taste. My wife and I had the banoffe crepe and the cheap date waffle and we split the chicken pesto panini. The waffle and crepe were brought before the sandwich for some reason. There was enough delay to finish the initial entrees before receiving the panini. The waffle was fantastic. Perfectly cooked with an excellent mix of flavors. The crepe was OK, but the dulce de leche seemed more like caramel syrup than anything else. The chicken pesto sandwich had great flavor, but the sandwich was only warm not hot when served. Unfortunately toward the end, I encountered some avocado that was not yet ripe. Overall the brunch was good and I would come back to try it again."}
