{"text":"I stopped here this week for a quick lunch between errands. With its white walls and immaculate tables and countertops, its obvious that this place has only been open for 4 weeks. I appreciate a high standard of cleanliness when it comes to most things, especially in regards to where I'm eating. So kudos for that. However, because it feels so sterile and new, along with its bright lights, high ceiling, and white everything, it lacks the warm, inviting  atmosphere of \"homey\" diners. That being said, I believe food and service matter most so I'll move on. I ordered the Turkey Avocado Bacon Sandwich with tomato on toasted sourdough with a side of greens. Everything was very good and very fresh. The guys running the counter were smiling, polite, and upbeat. They also played good music. This place has the potential to go far in little Waunakee and I hope it does. I'm sure I'll be back really soon to try their drinks and baked goods!"}
{"text":"On Sunday they had a frost-your-own-cake kids event. So we made it a mother-daughter double date morning. This place is super cute. Doesn't look like much from the outside just a bakery in a strip mall. 
Love that they have coffee/tea with soy, almond and coconut milk as milk alternatives. I got a decaf coffee with almond milk. I also got a hot chocolate and the staff was gracious enough to split the cocoa by two for the 3-4 yrs olds. It comes with marshmallows and that was an instant kid pleaser. They also have coloring books, crayons and some picture books to entertain the kids. 
As for the event.... they broke the time slots into two age groups 5 and under and above 5yrs. Very smart because the little ones need more time and are pretty indecisive. 
They had set up tables and chairs with cups of frosting and sprinkles in the middle. There were frosting knives on the tables. You could choose between a vanilla and chocolate cake. My kid chose chocolate. There were several staff helping and they gave us a big scoop of frosting on top. After an hour and blur of sprinkles and pink and purple frosting we were done! 
Although I didn't try anything off the menu I did see they have a vast selection of made to order boozy cupcakes (my favorite kind) sooooo the next party I have I know where I'm ordering desert."}
{"text":"We ordered a cake for a birthday extremely last minute. The staff is so friendly and accommodating! I sent a picture of an idea I wanted and it turned out better than expected and we got so many compliments and it tasted amazing. I would definitely recommend this place"}
{"text":"Easily the BEST coffee in Waunakee!  They truly brew the best coffee I have ever tasted.  I can always count on Guilty Cafe for my perfect morning iced coffee.

The food selection is also incredible.  They have the tastiest pastries and breads, and, while I have never ordered them myself, I have had their cupcakes at parties and they are DELICIOUS!  I absolutely love Guilty's breakfast sandwich selection as well.  Also, everything is reasonably priced.

Well done, Guilty Cafe!  You are my favorite coffee shop in town :-)"}
{"text":"What a find!  I found myself in Waunakee today and decided to try a new restaurant--Guilty Cafe.  I loved the crisp, clean interior and the original watercolors (many for sale) from local artists on the walls.  Not too much--just enough!  Great turkey, hummus, avocado wrap--perfectly grilled and served on a cool sheet tray.  Most fun was the 'open' concept where I could see the Chef prepare the food.  A nice surprise was the savory scone served with the creamy tomato soup.  That could have been a meal in itself.  I plan to order desserts for an upcoming event.  Don't let the 'strip mall' location deter you--give it a try.  It's a breath of fresh air!!  Can't wait to work my way through the menu."}
{"text":"This is a great new bakery/cafe in Waunakee. I had a falafel wrap that was heavenly and my folks had a grilled ham and cheese. It's hard to find a good bakery cafe these days and this one is off to a great start."}
{"text":"I've been here several times now, and every time we both walk out super happy. The breakfast food has been delicious, and their coffee and mochas have been just as good! The baked goods are amazing as well! They have quite a bit going on here, with a nice laid back atmosphere with incredibly friendly staff. Waunakee is lucky to have them, we need one in Madison!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with a group of friends who also live in town. I ordered a chai latte, which was great compared to other places in town and reasonably priced for the quality. For a entree, I ordered a Turkey Avocado Bacon sandwich, and I appreciated the fact that it had a lot of bacon. I had chips as a side, but my one complaint was that the only options are sea salt and barbecue, and I prefer plain. After my meal was finished, I ordered a raspberry scone and cinnamon roll. The scone was lacking raspberry flavor on the inside, but the cinnamon roll was done to perfection. Guilty is filling a void that has been empty since the O'Malley Farm Cafe left too soon in '99. I enjoyed it so much I returned the next day for lunch again!"}
{"text":"Amazing local cafe!! Love that they always have fresh quality ingredients served with a smile! They can cater to everyone's needs including gluten-free, keto, dairy free and even to making a unicorn cake! Check out guilty cafe!"}
{"text":"If you've been in Waunakee you know that there isn't a large choice of restaurants so it's a good thing when a new place comes in.  The Guilty Cafe is nestled between a nail salon and Milio's, but there is parking.  The first thing I love about this cafe?  They hold gluten-free selections.  There were individually wrapped muffins on display along with other scones, muffins, breads that were not gluten free.  They have cupcakes and cakes to order as well if you need a bakery treat.  They also have sandwiches on the menu, so we opted to try them out.

What needs work yet with this cafe is the atmosphere.  The walls are a stark white and while there is some fun unique art prints on the wall, between the white walls, the plastic chairs and tables and not a full divider between some of the cooking areas and the tables, it lacks comfort.  Some may enjoy watching the food be prepared, but that's not me.

The turkey, bacon and avocado sandwich was very good.  The ingredients were fresh and crisp, and I appreciated the toasted thick bread in it.  The service was very polite and both of those matter more to me in a restaurant.  It's worth a trip, and there are also bite size pieces of the treats so you can sample before you order."}
