{"text":"I love the food. it taste delicious and crunchy. If you don't want to wait that long, better order ahead of time because it takes 20-30 minutes to wait for your food. Other than that great customer service."}
{"text":"The food is very fresh and delicious they are polite and professional it's been clean every time I've stopped by. You do have to wait about 15 minutes but it's worth it."}
{"text":"Hands down the best fried chicken I've had in Calgary so far. I'm so lucky this place is a walk away from where I live.
You can dine in or take out. We decided to sit and got the last table left ( there were only 8). 
We were greeted by the lady owner and asked if we'd been before or needed any help with the menu.
The menu is limited but offer options for those who just want a couple pieces of chicken to a whole chicken. 
We choose the 3 piece YumYum with fries ( smothered in sweet chili sauce) and the half Chicken (original recipe comes with 6 pieces)
We were warned ahead of time that it would take 15-20 minutes, because it's all cooked fresh to order.
It was SO delicious. The chicken was crispy, not greasy and by the end we barely finished it all. 
The fries were interesting. They were fat and fluffy looking. They weren't super crispy, and had almost a sweet seasoning to them, but I really enjoyed them nonetheless.
Along with our meal came some pickled veggie, a bucket for our bones, and wet wipes for after.
I can't mention enough how sweet the owner was, checking in to see how we liked everything despite being the only person working the front and having tons of people coming and going.
I hope this little business does really well.
For those who frequent Yum Yum BBQ, for every $10 you spend, you get a sticker. It eventually adds up to getting free chicken. 
The best part is that I expected to feel disgusting a few hours after eating so much fried meat, but nope, felt as good as can be. This is my barometer for whether I've had quality product btw.  :)"}
{"text":"very decent chikin.

amazing breading.

their spicy isn't that spicy but oh well, still had nice flavor. 

they serve it way too hot (you gotta let fried chicken sit for 5-10 minutes so it self cooks)

chicken was a bit overdone and dry, but also canadians seem to freak out if their chikin isn't overcooked, so i can't really fault this place. not the best value but good legs and wings. i'd give this place 3.5."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in Calgary IMO. Great seasoning and batter, but expect to wait 15 to 20 mins cause food is freshly made after you place the order..."}
{"text":"I got the BBQ beef meal. And it was so tasty. I've eaten Korean food before and didn't like it much. But this good was so tasty!!"}
{"text":"First time here for lunch on a Sunday. It wasn't terribly busy, one other pick up order. Their was also one other couple who ordered take-out.
I ordered the two piece shallot chicken which comes with fries. My wife and son shared the Beef Bulgogi rice.
They have a younger male manning the till, he's not overly friendly. I just get the feeling he wishes he was somewhere else.
The food itself is tasty enough, but nothing out of this world.
I don't think i'll come back.
They also have a television on the front wall playing Korean movies.


Customer service to me is key for a return visit.  I can get fried chicken at other places with a smile lol."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the soy chicken.its so crispy and freshly cooked.love the fries as well.the owners are really friendly."}
{"text":"Yum Yum is YUMMY. 
I was very surprised at how good the food was. It's not that I had low expectations I just had no expectations. So when I received my food (I ordered delivery) and got a substantial amount of aesthetically pleasing delicious food I was surprised! 
You know how take out food never amounts to the pictures? Well this did. Yum yum. 

I don't have any complaints about the food. I got the BBQ plate which comes with chicken, beef, rice, dumplings, salad and kimchi. The chicken was crispy while tender and the yum yum sauce wasn't overly sweet and had a nice bite to it. The beef was tender. The rice perfect. The salad dressing was creamy and tasty. And though I'm not a dumpling gal, the dumplings were A+. The kimchi was yummy too. 

I will definitely be ordering again and again and again and again..."}
{"text":"Tastes sooooooo good. The chicken piece is about quarter size each. We ordered 6 hot 6 honey. 2 fried chips as takeaway. It takes about 30 mins to be ready. Picked up to see the super moon. Soooo satisfying if you are drinking with cool beers."}
{"text":"So it is lunch time and I am having lunch with peeps from the Government that do health inspections for AHS.  Yes, they are all asian...except for the 2 cute ladies having lunch across the way.  They were asian....Caucasian.  Sorry I can't help it if the radar for attractive women is sensitive, but back to the food.  Well lets start with the location first.  Its like a strip mall, you can't miss the signs of YUM YUM.  Inside there is a t.v playing Korean pop music videos, no complaints against that.  The back wall that has celebrity pictures, quite entertaining.  So what do 4 people order at this place.  The family special.  20 pieces, 10 shallot chicken and 10 sweet and spicy.  It also came with fries and radishes and iced tea.  By the end of the savagery, 4 pieces remained that we took home.  This was up there with WOW chicken downtown Calgary, unfortunately they dont serve frozen beer...lol!"}
{"text":"Yum Yum is tucked away in a little strip mall behind the Southwood neighbourhood in in the SW. The menu is simple, consisting mainly of fried chicken with or without sauce an/or spicy seasoning and fries, although there is one additional offering of BBQ meat and rice.

Both dine-in and take-out are available. 

On my first visit, I opted for the $7.99 two piece spicy meal with included fries and a canned pop. Both pieces of chicken were white meat and had the standard, awesome, thick and flavourful (without being overly greasy) skin that you find in Korean fried chicken joints. I tried both the spicy and regular chicken and didn't notice much of a difference between the two. 

The fries looked like standard frozen crinkle cut fries, but they actually had an extra, almost sweet, coating that complimented the chicken.

If you are in the area and looking for a Korean fried chicken fix, Yum Yum is a great option!"}
{"text":"One of those 'don't judge a book by its cover' places.  The decor is pretty drab BUT this place is amazing.  I've never had such delicious CRISPY fried chicken. Not sure how they do it but the chicken is so crunchy on the outside and moist and delicious on the inside.  10/10 in my books! 

I met my friend here as per his recommendation.  I probably never would have tried it if he didn't say such good things. So glad he did. Definitely on my list of preferred restaurants."}
{"text":"This is a small eat-in or take out establishment that is Korean run and fairly good.
 I had the 2 piece chicken meal accompanied with the included drink of choice and fries that are seasoned in cheese seasoning.
The meal overall was pretty good but not anything special.
The good thing about this restaurant is that your meal is cooked to order and very fresh.
You could obviously tell the fries were freshly fried as well as the chicken which was very juicy with a crisp coating on the outside.
Keep in mind though this all comes with a price (yes the bill too) you have to wait around 10-15 minutes for your food, so take out and ordering ahead is a good ideas for those that are inpatient!"}
{"text":"They are delicious!!!  In my opinion, they are the best fried chicken in Calgary.  We are their regular customer.  Yum yum and shallot are my two favourite options!!  The yum yum are crunchy outside and moist inside - The sauce is just right , not too spicy and not too sweet!   
The shallot one are also very crunchy, the teriyaki-like sauce is amazing, my kids love them!  Their potato on a stick also has great taste. I wish they can open another store in deep SE!!"}
{"text":"After a lot of hype, I was really hoping this would be phenomenal Korean BBQ chicken, but it is just mediocre. With the amount of sauce they put on the wings, you would expect a great amount of flavour. Unfortunately, it fell quite short and I personally found it very bland. The other person I was with also had the same experience. Very bland, and barely any flavour. I will never go back. Nothing here compares to the amazing BBQ chicken I've had at other places. For example, Seoul Fried Chicken in Edmonton is outstanding! I hope the chef here tries theirs and duplicates their recipe."}
{"text":"Great food but side portions are smaller than we anticipated. We ordered for delivery and it came pretty fast. I would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"Made to order - so prepared to wait...BUT you will have  freshly fried chicken! 

Chicken had the right amount of batter (not too much), was not greasy. 

The yum yum sauce was good, not too much garlic.
The spicy chicken was well seasoned and was a mild spicy. 

Place is small.
Friendly staff.

2 piece lunch meal with fries and drink - $7.99
My portion was pretty small, wish the pieces were bigger :)"}
{"text":"I've eaten here many times and once I got very sick. The chicken is good and moist and the side dish  is refreshing. This is Korean chicken so enjoy the yum yum flavor and spiral potato."}
{"text":"The chicken was really fresh crispy and sweet. The twisted potatoes are way better than regular fries!"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting a fried chicken place when we decided to go here for dinner but it smelled really good so we stayed. My husband explained that fried chicken is a big thing in Korea right now. It's an interesting mix of food on the menu with four different kinds of fried chicken, bulgogi, and poutine. I ordered the two piece yum yum chicken (their fried chicken with a sweet chili sauce on it) and my husband ordered the combo plate that had chicken (he went with the regular fried chicken), bulgogi (he chose the beef), rice, salad and kimchi. Both were delicious - the bulgogi was tender and tasty. My husband didn't finish the kimchi, saying it was just ok. I don't like kimchi so didn't try it  The chicken was well battered, not greasy and the fries that came with my chicken, while only lukewarm while the chicken was steaming hot, were perfectly done. Crispy, not greasy and perfectly salty. Two days later I'm craving more chicken. We will definitely go back here whenever I'm craving fried chicken! 

It's a small place with just half a dozen tables but lots of people coming in for takeout. The place was clean, including the washroom, although they didn't have any highchairs that I could see."}
{"text":"Great chicken! The flavours are great and there is little to no grease (when compared to other fried chicken establishments, you know the one I mean). It's dangerous that this place is close to home and that their prices are set pretty low. We will definitely be back on those nights we don't want to cook!"}
