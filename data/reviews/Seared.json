{"text":"The atmosphere is very nice, and there is plenty of parking.  However, the service, food, drinks, and prices are just horrible."}
{"text":"The name seems to imply it is a steakhouse bar and when I went there they didn't have any potatoes or bread to go with the steak. I asked the guy what the hell and he didn't know. A $28 steak with no baked tater or steak fries? I didn't think anyone would have the balls to try to sell something like that unless they was in Chicago.  So, in retribution for this affront to my spud sensibilities, I slung a long slick wad of fat/gristle on the floor, drunk me some mexican beer from a dirty glass and watched long island ice tea drinkers kick the 'seared' ball of gristle to and fro as they ambled wildy about searching for their lives in the stepdown bar. After it got kicked and slicked way down past the barroom crowd and around the corner, I couldn't get any more service or meat or beer so I poured the blood/juice ooze from my plate onto the floor but it wasn't slippery and nobody was slipping in it. So I left and drove out over the big bridge and got me a northfield chipotle from the guy with the tattoo."}
{"text":"This place is an absolute joke. It's a shame, too, because their entrees were excellent. Unfortunately, their operation and service are disasters. We literally had more than 10 issues during the course of dinner. We are very patient diners, but once you hit double digit fu**ups, everyone has their breaking point. All of the other yelpers on here are 100% correct - AVOID THIS RESTAURANT."}
{"text":"Hooooo boy. I hate to do this, but.. ugh.  I came here with my parents and sister for some drinks and dinner. It looked really promising from the outside - like a cute, quaint little restaurant, so I assumed it would at least be a decent experience. We sat down on some couches near the bar for drinks and appetizers for happy hour and planned on going to the dining area for dinner afterwards. My sister and I both ordered cocktails from their happy hour menu - I had a \"Skinny Colada\" and she had something that was supposed to be like a lemon drop, and they were some of the weakest drinks we've ever had. They were both drinkable, but.. meh. Not even worth the five dollars we paid.  The bread they served was pretty good, and the crab cakes we got were good too. That's kind of where the high points end. We got calamari, which was 90% the tentacle parts which are okay when cooked well but totally creep me out when they aren't.. and these weren't. My parents still wanted to stay there for dinner (for the sake of convenience), but I wasn't convinced that their fairly pricey food would be worth it, so I ordered a happy hour burger. We moved to the dining area where my sister got a steak salad, and my parents got things that were apparently forgettable to me. My sister ordered the steak on her salad medium-rare, and it was the toughest piece of steak I've ever tasted in my life. I honestly couldn't even chew it, which is pretty horrible for a restaurant called \"Seared.\" My happy hour burger was pretty awful too, but I was just thankful I hadn't ordered something from the regular (and moderately expensive) menu.   The most ridiculous part of the evening had to do with our bills. First they tried to charge us full price for ALL of our drinks, and then when we reminded them that they were during happy hour they only reduced the price of my parents beers. One of the waitresses even told us that the cocktails that my sister and I ordered weren't on the happy hour menu.. which was the only drink menu we looked at. Did she think that I just imagined a \"skinny colada\" on my own? For some reason everyone involved kept getting so confused over the prices of the drinks on their own happy hour menu multiple times! A manager/bartender apologized about the situation, which I guess was nice, but it was still one of the most bizarre billing mix-ups I've ever experienced before.  We used a Groupon here, but even that didn't make it worth the visit. Sorry, Seared."}
{"text":"Closed. Appropriately so.  Poor, rude, distracted, terrible service. Did I mention poor, rude, distracted, terrible device."}
{"text":"Had a great time at this restaurant previously occupied by Spanish Tavern. The building is really interesting and retains the rustic look. It's almost a pity that the menu doesn't reflect that rustic feel, but we sure didn't mind after eating! The dining room has these huge windows and I kinda wished it was snowing so we could sit and watch the snow fall as we ate.   We got there pretty early, but by 7 pm or so the dining room was full. Loved that it was a diverse clientele too--a night out for a few folks in their 30s, a young couple on a date, older folks out to dinner, etc. Loved their large cocktail menu. It had more than your standard martinis--loved that they experimented with flavors.  The service was great. Our server was attentive and fast. We both loved our meals. Portions were definitely hearty. After an appetizer and a salad I definitely couldn't finish my crab stuffed shrimp. Menu has mostly steak/seafood items with an occasional pasta/veggie dish. I was hesitant to order dessert, as I wasn't sure that the tiramisu was homemade, but it sure was! Quite tasty too.  I guess my only complaint was about one bartender in the bar area. (Cute bar area by the way with a fireplace and cozy chairs). After dinner we wanted to grab a drink and this one bartender/server (you with the orange fake tan and dark hair...you know who you are!!!) completely ignored us. We sat at the bar, and she went so far as to look directly at us without saying a word. After 15 minutes we walked out. Once this place gets rid of her, I'll be back!!"}
