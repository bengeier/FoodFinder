{"text":"My review is for this wonderful Serbian Dessert they do called Krem Peta

http://easteuropeanfood.about.com/od/croatianserbiandesserts/r/krempita.htm

It is the most wonderful light flaky crust (kinda like a cross btwn phyllo dough and puff pastry) and a creamy dreamy custard.  It's the only thing i get there.  The do have other deli items.

The price is like $2.50 per sqaure and it's huge.  Pick some up for dessert and your guest will love u."}
{"text":"This is a ethnic-based store, catering to the former Yugoslav community in East York. 
While the place is a small grocery store, it does have a surprising diversity of offerings. From their meat counter, pies, and fresh pastry goods (none made on-site as far as I know), to frozen goodies, cookies, snacks and candy from former Yugoslavia.

That being said, it is a small space and it is not the cheapest. Some of the west end stores that cater to this market definitely have more diversity in terms of products mainly due to their size. The service here is pretty ok, nothing out of the ordinary (after all it's Eastern Europeans - we're not known for that sort of stuff). 

If you are looking for some food from that part of the world and do not feel like making a trek to the west end of the city, this is your place. They got all the basics you need!"}
