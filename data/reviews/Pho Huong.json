{"text":"I am a huge phan (pun intended) for Pho done right.  For me, there are three things that make a good Pho.  The quality of the meats, how good the broth tastes and the quality of the add ons.  If one doesn't taste good, it affects the other two components.  That is what happened to me this place.  I tried the #1 (Special) and the broth was good. The meats, while skimpy (one piece of tripe, one oversized piece of tendon with a bunch of rare steak) was of good quality but the add ons were simply not up to par in ANY restaurant.  The spouts you get are essential to a good pho and these ones were brown and soggy.  They had obviously been frozen and thawed.  In fact, there was a pool of water that had formed where they had melted.  They were slimy and mushy.  When I asked for fresh ones, the waitress simply shrugged and said that was it.  This makes the Pho the worst I've ever had, and this is coming from a guy from KC, a town known for BBQ, rather than anything \"ethnic\".  We have 5 Vietnamese restaurants there, of which, some are rather nasty, but ALL of them were better than this place.  Avoid this place, the workers aren't there to give you a good food experience.  They have no pride in the food they serve and it shows."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant ever. Their service is the worst Vietnamese restaurant in Junction, possibly Toronto. How the hell could you imagine there were only two servers in that fully packed restaurant!. I gave 5$ tips for the boy but he seemed unhappy. I asked why and he answered he could not get that tips. I was totally pissed off!  Tips: never leave tips there because servers do not actually get it. They are students so Hannah takes advantage of them. Worst story ever heard. The food is cheap but partly I can figure out how quality those foods are! Especially their meats"}
{"text":"I have never quite experienced something like this at a restaurant before. The first time I came here, my family and I noticed that everyone around us were being served but us. Even those who came in after us. Please note we were the only Asian patrons at the time. 5 minutes later, they finally acknowledged us by giving us utensils and menus. Those who came in after, had already placed their orders.   My sister and I decided to give them a second chance thinking it could have just been a busy day last time and a bad coincidence that all the non-Asians were receiving seemingly better service. During our second visit, we confirmed that this place provides good service only to non-Asians. Again, my sister and I were served last. We received our food after those who ordered after us. It's important to note that we ordered pho, so there is no reason why it should have taken longer. When I gave them next to no tip, they sort of laughed, I guess as a confirmation to themselves that they did the right thing by providing bad service to Asians. Well, THAT'S why you get next to no tip from me. I don't know why I even gave them a tip. I will NEVER eat here again. The food is not even good. I really hope another Vietnamese restaurant opens up in this area so they can get a reality check."}
{"text":"One extra star for super-fast delivery. That's it. The food is gross - smells strange, like it was cooked with soap or like it's not fresh at all. Pho tastes like sour hot water with absolutely no flavour. This was definitely my first and last time."}
{"text":"The service here is not good. The pho is not authentic pho. The owner only hires visa students so she can take advantage of them"}
{"text":"I have been a few times and I always really enjoy it. I love the food. Normally I get an order of bún ch giò tht nng, and they always have really fresh veggies, but my favourite thing are their spring rolls. They make them in-house and even when my meal comes with them I order an extra just because they're so freakin' delicious.   Also they have a really wide variety of drinks some are really tasty, always interesting and it's fun to try all those flavours.  The one thing that could make it even better would be to add more vegetarian options to the menu."}
{"text":"This is a difficult review to rate since I have had excellent food here and I have had terrible food here. It is hit or miss, constantly. Today I came in to get my regular P2 (rare beef pho) and it was awful, the broth tasted off and almost burnt, the meat was tough and really chewy. Just last week I grabbed a P2 and it tasted amazing. My dining companion had a veggie pho and she said the broth was really off as well."}
{"text":"Decor is stylish, food is decent (though a bit pricer for pho), service is good.   Great place to visit for a quick meal."}
{"text":"Decent service and food. I'm more into the location than anything though.  I'm all about the BBQ pork at these Vietnamese places... And this place is ok. Good, but not stand out.   Have been back many times. No real complaints."}
{"text":"It has a nice and clean ambience, though the food menu is way too long and has way more other dishes than real Vietnamese cuisine. It is difficult to keep up quality for that variety of food. Food was still ok, though no long rememberence will be derived, unfortunately."}
{"text":"This is my staple place to eat when I'm too lazy to cook at home.  The menu is long with something for everyone.  I have not ordered anything I didn't like, but particular favourites are the cold shrimp rolls and lemongrass beef with vermicelli.   I have been here numerous times, but sadly I went the other day with a friend who had never had Vietnamese before and the service was pretty bad.  We both ordered cold rolls and a main.  My rolls arrived, and because I was starving, my friend said I should go ahead and start eating (I think it's nice to wait for everyone to have their food before eating).  I was about half way through one when hers arrived.  No biggie.  But then my meal came, and again, she said I should go ahead and eat.  After about 10 minutes and other tables getting served, we flagged the waitress down to ask about her dinner.  The waitress said the crispy noodles take longer to prepare than my vermicelli....that's hardly an excuse for such bad timing.  I think they may have actually forgotten her order.  When her food arrived, she DID say it was delicious, and it came out steaming hot.  I think this was maybe just an off night, as I've never had such a problem before and I've eaten here with groups.  Definitely not enough of a turn off to avoid the place as I would cry if I couldn't eat their delicious rolls anymore."}
{"text":"Can't comment on food quality because we never received our order. My wife and I placed an order for delivery. An hour later they called back saying they didn't have a driver on duty. We were annoyed but said we could pick it up. Then they told us they hadn't cooked the food. I give them 2 stars because they let us know, but definitely won't order here again."}
{"text":"I have been to many pho restaurants in Toronto, but it was my first time at Pho Huong. I ordered a beef/pork pho (I can't remember the name). I was unaware that the pho came with pig's feet along with the beef and pork slices.  I also recalled not seeing pork feet on pho menu when I ordered it.  I rarely ever send my meal back and I tried to eat it but couldn't stomach the smell of the pho broth.  I spoke with my server to order another meal instead was told that \"it was a waste and I would have to pay for the one I returned back\".   My understanding of eating at North American restaurants were that I normally have the right to return my meal if I was not satisfied with it, especially if I have barely touched it! Do not go to this restaurant if you want DECENT CUSTOMER SERVICE! Out of the four people who ordered, only one of my friends who actually liked their meal.  Definitely will not be returning back."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this place as being cheap and a lot of good food.  I didn't have a great food experience here, but I wouldn't mind trying it out again as long as i knew what i was ordering had recommendations.  I got the Stir-fried Vegetables with Egg Noodles and an avocado shake.  My friend got the tofu and vermicelli noodles (She is vegan, and the fish sauce came on the side, which she was happy about).  The Tofu with Noodles didn't have a sauce besides the fish sauce so my friend concocted her own sauce out of soy sauce, hot sauce and some other stuff on the table.  As for my dish, it came without Egg Noodles, which made it just a platter of what looked to be canned vegetables in a soupy plate.  It didn't look very appetizing, the vegetables were all so big that it made it difficult to pick up and put in my mouth, there were mysterious gobs of gelatinous matter through out the dish, and it smelled as though it was a meat broth, even through i thought it was vegetarian when i ordered it.  It was probably the worst thing i could have ordered.  The avocado shake was delicious! It was very very good. And my friend liked her tofu dish, after she created a sauce for it.  I wouldn't mind trying some tried and tested favourites after that bad dining experience.  The service was very quick and attentive (one of the waiters even came by to dry up tea that my friend had leaked all over our table)."}

{"text":"EXCELLENT AND AUTHENTIC PHO. Portions are generous, and the broth is to die for. Probably simmered and cooked for hours.  Very very authentic Vietnamese.   Service is mediocre but fast. Owner is always present and helpful which is nice."}
{"text":"I think the food at Pho Huong is great. I've dined in and got food to go about five times and it's always good and everything tastes so fresh.  Last night, I ordered the rare beef pho. It came in 3 containers: one for the broth, one for the beef and green onions, and one for the bean sprouts. When I opened it, I thought that was a bit of overkill then I realized how great it was because it kept everything fresh while I walked it home. Instead of bringing home a warm, mushy broth, I brought home a totally fresh pho; as fresh as though I had dined in.  Another time I ate in, I ordered the shrimp and mango salad. Again, just so fresh and delicious. You can get this type of salad elsewhere but I have looked and I can't find this exact mix anywhere. Some places have shrimp and papaya, some places have mango and mint, but I have yet to find a combination or shrimp, mango, mint, and green onion.  I know the service can be a bit gruff and I've read reviews where others have had bad experiences but so far (crossing fingers) I haven't had a bad experience yet.  As other reviewers have commented, they have a big selection on their menu. One time I ordered a salty lemon aid. I was curious. It was (again, very fresh) real lemons in water with what appeared to be rock salt at the bottom. It sounded very strange but I'm glad I tried it because it was actually quite good."}
{"text":"*update 2nd and 3rd visits*  Revisited 2 times 3rd week of July 2012. The Pho portions are still ridiculously small. The large Pho (P03) has ONE strip of beef brisket cut up into smaller pieces to give the illusion of substance and 4-5 pieces of rare beef. On top of that, they raised the prices. Other places would have a heaping portion of beef brisket for $7.50. I'll be taking my business elsewhere. There's plenty of other Pho places down the street in Roncesvalles and St. Clair.  If a restaurant manager reads these reviews, feel free to contact me if you guys change your ways.  But hey. If you like Pho Huong, by all means. Keep eating there. This is just my opinion. Eat wherever the pho-k you wanna eat."}
{"text":"Much like Pepe's review last year, I was a fan. To have one of one of the best pho restaurants in Toronto in my hood was a treat, but I've been going here for over three years and have definitely noticed a decline in the food. I ordered an  pho with rare, brisket and balls and the broth was so salty I couldn't finish half of it. And no depth or layers of beefy flavour and spices like I remembered their pho to be. It actually tasted like a flavour packet from instant pho noodles. The spring rolls were super greasy as well, and they used to be the best in the city. The amount of meat you get is also less than it was before, same goes for the bun.  This was on a Sunday, and the past few times I've been wastas on Sunday. I'm not sure whether to just never go on Sunday or just never go again.  The only reason this gets 2 stars is that they do have some new items on their menu, and the lotus root salad is a welcome addition."}
{"text":"Not sure what happened. Used to be much better.  Was brought dirt cutlery twice. Requested water twice. Not even brought any sauce or anything for my pho. Guess I have to leave the junction for pho"}
{"text":"Very poor service and bland food.   My visit was actually in May, 2 months ago. When I walked by it today, I realized that in my mind it now defined a two-star restaurant in my mind. A one-star review is reserved for a restaurant visit that results in  food poisoning."}
{"text":"Just like the sister restaurant in the Junction this place is DELISH! Both restaurants are owned by the same people. The menu appears the same to me. Go get their banh uot or banh cuon. It is soooo good!!! This place is cheap too. There isn't much to say about this vietnamese place in terms of the decor. It's your typical vietnamese joint with the best banh cuon/uot around! I should really try the pho one day.."}
{"text":"Went here twice and I really loved it. I had banh cuon both times because it's super cheap for a big portion. Since this dish isn't common in pho places that is what I decided to order. I haven't tried their other food so I can't attest to anything else.  The place is clean and service quick."}
{"text":"Called to order takeout and was hurriedly asked to \"hold on, okay?\" after which the employee put the phone down to take care of customers wanting to pay. No problem. However, I could hear everything during this time, including the customers leaving and silence for just over 5 minutes before I opted to hang up as I was clearly forgotten. I decided to go in to order because I was really craving pho.   I believe the same guy who put me on never-ending hold took my order after first seemingly trying to convince me to leave by saying there's a 20 minute wait and also cash only because their \"system is down\". I had time and cash on hand so I went ahead. Long story short, I ended up waiting 45 minutes for pho surrounded by about 4-5 other frustrated customers in the same boat. I also witnessed another call being answered and the customer being put \"on hold\" - never to be picked up. I assume during this time no other calls could come in. Maybe they do this on purpose? There was also a lady in the kitchen angrily yelling in Vietnamese for all to hear.   Soup is good but I'll be looking for a new place to satisfy my pho cravings. So should you."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I have made Wednesday Pho Night a tradition and we've been coming here every single week since January of this year as a mid-work week treat. If you're overly particular about customer service (communication between staff and diners is usually kept to the bare minimum) then this place isn't for you. However, if you're looking for a place that does pho and does it well, look no further.  I can't say I'm much of an adventurous eater (Beef tendons? No thank you!) so I always order just the plan rare beef pho (P02 for life!) in a small, because there's nothing even remotely small about the size of that thing - it's gigantic!   I usually start off with they vegetarian cold roll, which is just veggies and tofu wrapped in a rice flour wrap - which, by the way, is gluten free if you're into that sort of thing - served with a savoury sauce that has crushed peanuts on top.  As for their other fare, it's pretty mediocre. I ordered their pad thai once and it wasn't anything mind-blowing. They do make a mean bubble tea, though."}
{"text":"Never order takeout/delivery from them. I ordered their special pho noodle soup and the broth was absolutely disgusting. The soup had a strange stench to it. I had two bites and had a throw it out. The broth tasted like plastic. The spring rolls were good though."}
{"text":"Went here with a friend last night and it was bad, bad, bad. Server didn't really speak and the table was still dirty from the last patrons. I ordered the chicken crispy noodle, which was average. My dining companion ordered beef Pho with extra brisket. The server was perplexed by his request for extra bean sprouts as well. There was no extra meat, it seemed like there was less than an average bowl of  Pho. I tasted his and there was an odd sour or bitter taste to it. We ordered beef Udon and cold vegetarian rolls to share. The rolls were barely average, the Udon was absolutely disgusting. At the cash my friend told the staff \"the Udon was horrible\" the staff replied \"horrible?\" Friend said \"yes, horrible\" the staff smiled and looked away. $50 dollars for an average, at best, meal. Not a good deal! This morning I suspect by my body that something was loaded with MSG.  I will not be returning here, my friend was giving the place a third chance and has not had one good dining experience here."}
{"text":"Let me take you down memory lane, back to the Spring of 2007.   Steve Jobs was blabbing about something called an IPhone, Blockbuster Video was excited about expanding due to the success of the Bluray, and Amy Winehouse was in perfect health.  Back then, I got into an argument with my girlfriend about moving in with her while strolling through the Canadian Tire on the corner of Keele & Dundas.  My point of view was that I'd be doing the women of Toronto a diservice by being monogamous.    We decided to hit the PHO restaurant by the No Frills for some make-up Bun Bowls.  At the time, it wasn't called Pho Huong.  It was called something else and it was horrible.  There were a couple of teens running the joint and when I complained that my girlfriends food was cold they replied, \"No it isn't.\"  That day I declared to the heavens that this establishment will never have my shadow cast upon it again!  Well, things change.  In the year 2012 Steve Jobs, Blockbuster Video and Amy Winehouse are all dead.  That girlfriend is now my wife and I live in the condo where the Canadian Tire once stood.    More importantly, that horrible PHO restaurant turned into Pho Huong, perhaps my favourite Pho restaurant in the city.  It's got a lot of things going for it.  First, it's cheap.  My wife and I eat two full meals with appetizers and an Avocado milkshake and it costs us less than $25!  What a bonus for a cheapskate like myself!  Second, it's good food!  The fresh rolls are awesome and they are not light on the cilantro.  If cilantro is not your thing, then fuck off.  This review has gone long enough.  Just go and eat you snob!  @thesideburnguys"}
{"text":"I have only tried the Pho here. The pho here is just ok, it is acceptable if you realllyyy want Pho and is in the area. I personally find the broth very diluted in flavor here. I got the rare beef pho and my beef was fully cooked to a grey color by the time I received it, so it was kind of dry.  Worst of all, the broth must contain a lot of sodium in the form of either sodium chloride (table salt) or as MSG or both because I get extremely thirsty and bloated after my Pho meal here.Service is no frills, it is a eat and get out kind of place."}
{"text":"This is a great little place that has delicious food at wonderful prices. We used to come well out of our way to eat here, and now that we're living in the neighborhood, it's become a staple of our dining routine.  Best-tasting fried rice I've ever had (not just a menu filler like most places), and the vermicelli (best with pork and a spring roll) always leaves me feeling immensely satisfied. Family-friendly to boot."}
{"text":"Came in here on a cold rainy day and ordered the chicken Pho, veggie spring rolls and the mango drink. I got a small (I think) Pho and it was plenty for lunch. The spring rolls were a bit too greasy for me, they pretty much left a little pool of grease after you pick them up. The mango smoothie was really delicious. My friend ordered the beef Pho, with rare beef, beef balls and tendon and cold rolls and she said it was really good too."}
{"text":"Terrible Service!!! Used to be a regular. Will not go back. Chicken in one dish was slimy and smelled off. After discreetly making this known to staff, they returned the dish to me as is, saying that it was the 'sauce'. I am a certified food handler - i know the difference between sauce and slime. The cashier then made an issue when I refused to pay for the uneaten dish and tried to chastise me about \"Next time\". There wont be a 'next time'. Whatever happened to trying to make a customer happy? Or making up for a bad experience? Instead they made it seem as though I was trying to dine and dash. I had to prove that we didnt eat the bad dish by asking for the plates to be brought back out?? Deplorable."}
{"text":"Brutal, eh? Cash only, slightly overpriced, bad service, and the food is not on par with what great Pho should be. Or Bun for that matter."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. Very friendly service. Try the P14 to start off with, but don't be afraid to be adventurous. The menu goes on and on and on... Everything I've tried has been delicious."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I often go here for dinner or pick up something for take-out. While they are always packed, I've only had to wait more than 15 minutes once. The food is consistent - it is always exactly what you are expecting. I'm a creature of habit, so I only get the B17 and plain beef pho, so I may not be the best authority on their menu. But I like what I like! The other selling point is that you can have dinner for $20!"}
{"text":"Great Pho but really crappy attitude by staff. Don't plan on sitting where you like, especially if a couple. Every single time we argue about where to sit even though we ask for a specific table. The food however is great and prices are good. Some of the best pho in the city. Spring rolls are to die for and the vermicelli is spot on every time."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would! For reference I used to come here all the time, not because the food is great but because it is cheap and close to my house. Last time I was here I ordered the B02 (vermecelli with spring roll and pork I think) and I got awful FOOD POISONING!!! Don't come here unless you're trying to get sick, also the service is generally bad but I could put that past me if the food didn't make me sick."}
{"text":"Best Pho I have had in the city.  Would recommend this place to anyone in the mood for great Pho.  Why am I not there right now?  I want to be there right now."}
{"text":"We have been coming here infrequently over the last few years especially as the temperature begins to drop. Nothing seems to satisfy on a cold evening, or when you're under the weather, as a warm comforting bowl of Pho. Unfortunately, it appears that the level of service and the quality of food seems to follow the weather as of late.  I decided to explore other items off of their menu and ordered the Pad Thai. When it arrived, i knew right away that something was off. Vermicelli noodles and fried pieces of Pho beef mixed with red sauce doesn't make an authentic dish. After the first tangy bite, something was off.  I asked the waiter if I could exchange the Pad Thai for Pho. What I got was a manager coming to our table and questioning my knowledge and previous experiences with Pad Thai! Where have I eaten it before, have u eaten it here before.... Needless to say, I was extremely embarrassed. Coming from someone who has travelled through Thailand, I would like to think I have a good handle on authentic Thai cuisine. As a patron, I know when something tastes wrong. I did not touch the dish and left this place for the last time."}
{"text":"rare beef pho broth was delicious! Service wasn't great as others has said but the restaurant is very clean.  Don't be in a hurry."}
{"text":"Not a bad place. They have vegetarian options which is really good. I have had their veggie pho (and yes they use vegetable broth) in a small size the first time, and large size the second I went. There is a difference of 50 cents between small and large. The large really filled me though. I have also had their vegetable and tofu over vermicelli. Again, not bad, but could use more tofu I guess. I had the mango milkshake and it was really good. I want to try the strawberry one next time. The portion sizes and the price are pretty good. The service is pretty quick, but low key. But overall, I am happy with this place and I will be back again."}
{"text":"My go to for excellent affordable Vietnamese fare in the Junction Triangle.  Love their vermicelli bowl with grilled chicken, grilled pork, spring rolls.  Delicious!  Have tried their Pho also and it is excellent.  Servers could smile more, but other than that no complaints."}
{"text":"Some of the better Pho that I've had in Toronto, and I grew up in the bay area, so I'd consider myself a bit of a Pho expert.  It's in a great location (by a grocery store and all of the shops in the Junction), the service is fast and attentive, and the establishment is very clean (particularly compared to some of their competitors).  this is the Pho joint I hit up whenever I have a craving..."}
{"text":"Excellent selection of Vietnamese dishes, including items like Banh Cuon and Banh Xeo, which are rare to find in Vietnamese restaurants.  But all of the basics things that we tried were quite excellent too - vermicelli, summer rolls, spring rolls - mmm, very well done.  A clear stand-out amongst Vietnamese restaurants.  Service can be a bit cold, and the atmosphere is average for a Vietnamese place, but it's definitely clean.  But the food is excellent and the price is good too.  Pretty much everything that you'd want in a Vietnamese place."}
{"text":"I really like this place. I usually order delivery and they are prompt and courteous. The food is good. I recommend the curry chicken and spring rolls. Great value for the price. I get two meals out of a single order."}
{"text":"Good food but surly staff. Service with a frown. I always have Pho and the shrimp and pork rolls."}
{"text":"I live on Pacific Ave and visiting this place a lot, I love it. The food is great! The best spring rolls I ever tried in Toronto. Big parking across the street. And the price is good."}
{"text":"Vietnamese Vermicelli is one of my comfort foods,  so I ordered some through Just Eat when I was feeling a craving. Added 4 shrimp Rolls to make it up to the delivery minimum.  As usual,  Just Eats was A-1. Fast, pleasant service.   I'm stalling a little.  Like many Vietnamese restaurants, I think this one should consider more tofu based options,  but I was pleased to see this was an option for customization of the order.   My vermicelli had strengths and weaknesses.  Strength: springy, perfectly cooked noodles.  Weaknesses: wilted browning lettuce,  skimpy on other vegetables,  peanuts and spring rolls that looked like they had been put through a very greasy forest fire.  The cold salad rolls with shrimp are generously proportioned and feature the tasty noodles,  but barely any shrimp ND the same lackluster greens. Nice dipping sauce, but those peanuts make a repeat appearance.   All things considered, I think I will move on to another option on the app list."}
{"text":"Just your average Canadian style Vietnamese food restaurant,  nothing special. The service was really bad (we went up to get menus and again to place our order and so did the others in the restaurant). The food came quickly as it usually does in veitnamese restaurants. Ordered the pho bo and the meatballs kind of tasted like rubber but the other people I was with said their food was \"not bad but not great\"."}
{"text":"This used to be the go to place in the Junction area but things have gone down hill in the past couple of years and I'm definitely not going back there! I ordered the rice with grilled pork and veal and the food arrived on time. The portions are ridiculous and cheap and so are the cuts of meat as evident with the pork. The veal had a greyish color with a foul smell and almost no meat so I called the server over and explained to him hoping I don't get sick from eating \"grey\" meat. The server took it back to the kitchen with no replacement, explanation, or apology but they had taken a portion of it off my bill. At least, come over, apologize to the customer and explain to them what you'll do for them. Never serve old grey meat to any of your other customers but I will never go there again"}
{"text":"The server was very friendly.   The portions are large given the price.   The location is great, in the heart of Little Italy.   They have a sliding patio window that opens in the summer that is a great way to be part of the fabric of the scene while eating your food."}
{"text":"I love vermicelli and spring rolls. This place does a very decent job with this dish - although it's not rocket science. It's insanely cheap so it's pretty hard to complain. I cannot speak to the other food. The place was packed so I guess that's a good sign."}
{"text":"I love this place We eat here fairly often. I am a big fan of the spring rolls, the vermicelli and the rice roll  grilled pork. (r05 on their menu). My only complaint is that the person who does the rice paper steam rolls does not work about 50% of the time and we LOVE these so it is a bit of a disappointment when they are not available.  Delivery is fast and so is take-out. They seem to do more take out than dine-in so the place is generally fairly empty inside (which I prefer). I have always gotten friendly service here. I don't like cold rolls so I can't comment on them but my boyfriend had the chicken curry and it was also quite good."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery via the Just Eat app and we had a pretty good dinner.  Food arrived in 30 mins. instead of the projected 45 mins., which was much appreciated.  The Pho special had a good mix of meats, nice noodle portion and flavourful broth complete with a baggie of bean sprouts, herbs and hoisin & chili sauce.  The pork chop and quiche rice dish was tasty too.  The chicken wings appetizer was the slightly odd one with 'Asian' batter used instead but it still went down nicely.  For a $3 delivery charge, not a bad deal!"}
{"text":"mmmm..... food is good. but the portions.... um... very very very tiny. I had stir fried veggies with udon and the portion that came for a regular $9 was so minimal that I felt pretty empty by the end of it...  but the spring rolls are delicious.  both of my friends weren't satisfied with the food sizing they got either.  maybe should give it another try and order something different..."}
{"text":"Great food, not-so-great service.  I got pho soup with rare beef and beef brisket and spring rolls, both of which were DELICIOUS! The meat in the soup is good quality so it's not stringy like other places.   We ate in the restaurant and it smelled very strongly of fish sauce which may not bother some folks but I really don't like the smell. There was a young man working when we were there and he was making it painfully obvious that he didn't want to be there. I was sitting with 2 other people and each time one of us finished our order he would nod and try to walk away and the next person to order had to yell HEY ID LIKE TO ORDER TOO!   All in all I'd still come back to this place just for the pho. It was great!"}
{"text":"Had the lotus root salad and also a huge bowl of vermicelli noodles with grilled chicken (B17) and spring roll on top. Delicious and soooo cheap. So long as you know what to order this place is such a great deal I give it 5 stars. $7~10 for a really nice dinner...!  The service is quick and friendly and its just a great deal."}
{"text":"Update: I went back on a Friday night with the same group of friends and the service was just how I remember it: Fast."}
{"text":"They have more than just pho here.  Actually it's on the last page of the menu.   Such a convenient location we needed a quick bite to eat and was in and out in 30mins.   I was also a little shocked that I was the only Asian person in the resto !  Te decor is clean and seems catered to westerners but they still operate like typical pho places. I can wave them down and walk in and share seats.   We both got pho. It's a bit more pricey than what I am used to in Mississauga but at $6-8 a bowl it's pretty good. The small is small. Very little meat. I would suggest a Large (no medium). I got P01 which was supposed to have all the fixings rare beef tendon meatball tripe. I only got one of each. I guess they ration. If you're craving something would suggest get a pho that only has a choice of meat types.   The broth was tasty. Tasted fresh and not over MSG or salty.   They also have take-out. TAKE OUT PHO. Might be pretty interesting if I'm craving something."}
{"text":"It's nice to know there's a pho place in the neighbourhood, but $7 for a small bowl of pho (which is pretty small btw) is deep. I would pay $5 for that to be honest.   The food was good, but overall I wouldn't come back unless I was in the area and craving Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"Really the best Pho restaurant I've been to in Toronto.  There is a reason it is always jam-packed with people (even on weekdays).  Would recommend this place to anyone.  I have taken many people here and they all agree it is fabulous."}
{"text":"Finally decided to have lunch here today after passing by so many times and seeing the place packed with people.  I was not impressed at all and I was starving. Started off with calamari. It had no seasoning whatsoever and was coated in a weird batter. Fish sauce to dip. Come on... Then my actual plate came out (bo luc lac) and it literally had 10 tiny pieces of beef. It wasn't marinated at all so again, fish sauce was my only source of flavour.  I think this place only does so well because of its location but the food needs huge improvements. Most of their customers seem to be non-Asian but you can't fool a Vietnamese!"}
{"text":"Alright here is the deal, I live in Scarborough and I work in Markham. For the uninitiated that means that I have access to an abundance of any type of Asian cuisine that I want, I'm not bragging it's just fact. So when I venture into a neighbourhood far from home (i.e. the junction) I try to eat somewhere or something that I cannot find in my neck of the woods. Naturally walking into Pho Huong I was a bit skeptical at the prospect of finding good Vietnamese in this area, I was WRONG.   After a few pints at a nearby watering hole 6 of us ventured here with our stomachs growling for some dinner. The place is fairly small and clean. The restaurant was not very busy on a Friday evening. Our group was served promptly, our orders were taken and our food came out in a timely fashion.   On this cold night I was in the mood for something warm so I opted for a large pho with rare beef, tripe, beef tendon, and beef balls or what I like to call \"the works.\" The soup was a pretty big size and more than justified the $7 price tag. To my surprise the meat to noodle ratio was at least 50:50 if not more meat than noodles, awesome! The beef arrived at the table very rare, there is nothing I hate more than getting pho with the \"rare\" beef being already cooked. The beef slices were generous and lean, the tendon added a nice crunch and the beef balls were very flavourful, however the tripe was difficult to find. I enjoyed all the meat aspects of my soup. The noodles were cooked nicely with just enough bite. The accompanying garnish was all standard stuff. The broth had great colour and excellent flavour, the fresh red chillies provided added a nice kick. Overall this was on par with some of the better pho's I've had in my neighbourhood.   This place was a very pleasant surprise, our whole group seemed to enjoy their meals and the food quality was great. The next time I am in the junction I may pop in here for a nice bowl of pho, I'd recommend you do the same"}
{"text":"This restaurant located and the junction, was pretty full on a saturday, which is usually a good sign. but having tasted a variety of food in this restaurant, i would have to say it is not good but the standards and is only considered good because in its area it is the only pho place around. the papaya salad we had was not very good tasting and didn't really have any taste, unlike most mango/papaya salads in other places. The pho the soup was not very good, the beef was overcooked, and the portions was extra small given the price and area. The Pad Thai i believe was half decent, it did have the flavour a pad Thai should have more authentically. and it was little spicy which is a good thing. but it was nowhere close to the best pad thai in toronto by any thai or vietnam place standards. Food wise finally the leaf drink, it was not good, but it might just be the product of me not liking that plant in juice.   Overall the food was not very great, the interior looked nice and comfortable nd the place looked clean. However the servers were slow and seemed confused as they would get our orders wrong and did even know which table to return a tea pot they were replavcing at our table, even though our table was right besides the tea table.   I definetely would not recommend this place to anyone who really loves good pho. However in this area i could see what its more popular. mostly because it is the only one in the area."}
{"text":"Cute dainty place, convenient spot. Service is mediocre.. we had seated ourselves because no one was there to greet us even though there was only one table occupied in the restaurant, but we later noticed them greet other customers. We had to go to the counter to pay because after eating nobody came to take our plates or ask if we wanted dessert. But aside from the service their food is superb. The prices are affordable, and definitely worth the value as the portion sizes are huge. Would go again for a quick bite, just not my ideal for a sit down dinner."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good and not bad prices, however, the service is terrible."}
{"text":"Ordered a taro bubble tea with double tapioca.  It was a little bit in the pricey side, but still yummy.  The place was ok, but I'm in no hurry to come back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Excellent pho. The real gem however is the bun cha hanoi - pork meatballs and belly grilled and then dunked in a flavorful sauce which you then wrap up in lettuce leaves with rice noodles. Bonus points for the always great adult contemporary music they play."}
{"text":"It was not spectacular with the food as other restaurants around town serve better pho. For the area, it was one of the only restaurants with seats available. I was surprised that they served alcohol as other Vietnamese places don't. We were aimlessly trying to find a place to eat after spending some time at a game cafe nearby.  The venue is spacious and we quickly ordered as we were starving. The clientele is made up of locals in the area and we were one of few tables filled with Asians. I ordered my usual beef tendon pho while my friends ordered pad thai and salad. My dish was average but after trying their dishes, I would really disappointed at the quality of the food. It was likely due to the taste that the regulars were accustomed to.  The service was quick so there was not complaint there. However, I would likely try another restaurant if I was in the area again. There were many bars / restaurants along the way to the restaurant but unfortunately, we had slim pickings and ended up wanted something to eat as we were starved."}
{"text":"Good food, average service. Very long wait time. 40 minutes for take-out? Never again. Call in advance for wait times."}
{"text":"Please stay away from this restaurant. The quality of the ingredients, the food, and service are all terrible. The only redeeming quality is the price, but that does reflect everything else you'll receive.   I had gone last night and found the broth not having any flavour. The only ingredients in the pho are vermicelli noodles, meat, and sprinkles of frozen peas. I ended up not being able to goto work the day after, because of salmonella poisoning.   Be forewarned."}
{"text":"Fast service, good pho. Good sized portions, normal Toronto Pho prices.  Cozy restaurant.   Not much more to say!"}
{"text":"This is the best Pho in the city. Great spring rolls. The food is fresh and they even have a vegetarian broth. I have always had good service. There is a reason that it's always busy no matter when you go."}
{"text":"Pho Huong has a vast selection of Vietnamese dishes on their menu which I can appreciate because they offer an array of soup, noodle, and rice dishes.  My previous visit (lunch) I ordered the com tam suon bi cha (broken rice w/ grilled pork chops, shredded pork, and fried egg on top) which I highly recommend.  During my most recent visit (dinner), I ordered the vermicelli bowl w/ grilled pork, crispy spring rolls, and shrimp sugarcane. The best part about the dish was the shrimp sugarcane, but I thought the dish itself lacked overall execution compared to the com tam I had. The fish sauce portion was meager (I had to ask for more) and tasted a bit bland and watered down. The grilled pork was a bit dry and the spring rolls tasted like they were sitting in a heat lamp for awhile. The dish was warm, but not freshly made.   The bubble tea here is decent, but some taste more authentic than others. I preferred the passion fruit over the taro because the distinct flavor of passion fruit was present while the taro only resembled a hint of its true taste and gave off more of a creamy, taro ice cream/milkshake texture and consistency.  Service is a bit slow, cold, and indifferent.  Tip: Go for lunch rather than dinner. You have a better chance of scoring freshly prepared dishes and an overall better dining experience.  I have yet to try the pho. Perhaps, I will try it next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Underrated local pho. Better broth than Spadina equivalents. Unfortunately, usually pretty empty. Stopped in for a hot bowl of rare beef pho on a freezing -14 night and it hit the spot. I hope it sticks around!"}
{"text":"I was a fan of this place. We used to eat (either in or take out) a lot, at least once a week. But lately we've noticed that the quality of the food started to decline. Prices are still great, and the personnel friendly (nothing spectacular, though). The decline is seen not so much in the quality of the ingredients, but more on the preparation (too little chicken on the pho, springrolls that are too greasy, not enough chicken on the pad thai..etc). I hope the owners pay more attention to the preparation of the food, and keep having a commercial success. inflation on Food prices are up 4% lately and even though I love low prices, I wouldn't like to see quality go down for the sake of a deal. Overall, you won't regret eating at Pho Huong. I just have high standards for brands and places I like to go frequently..."}
{"text":"I like that there is a Pho restaurant in the Junction because when I crave Pho (which is quite often since I grew up eating it every week), there is Pho Huong in the neighbourhood. This place isn't as great as Pho Hung on Spadina, but it's as the rating states: A-OK.  They have a good selection of Pho and Vermicelli, and the rice dishes are alright, I just wished they had more Vermicelli Soup dishes. They've/ recently raised their prices, so they're now a bit pricier than Pho Hung. Overall, this place is alright and if you want Pho or other Vietnamese dishes, and you're in the neighbourhood, it's okay to check out."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout - they were out of the salad I wanted. More importantly, the curry was terrible. Tasted like cubed chicken broth sprinkled with cumin. Not good."}
{"text":"Sometimes a restaurant catches you off guard and tonight this little place in the junction did it to me. My friend has been to this place numerous times before and thought I should give it a try. Knowing my friend's standards, I was expecting good but what I got was fantastic.  It is a small, yet spacious restaurant with enough tables to meet the high demand but small enough that you don't feel overwhelmed. Ordering is done by writing what you want on an ordering sheet that is then handed to the servers. This allows patrons to scan their extensive menu without feeling rushed about making a decision. They have many options for appetizers, Pho, other rice and pasta dishes, drinks and desserts. They appear to cater to every level of spice from minimal to spicy. There are only a few menu items that are designated with a hot pepper. The menu clearly outlines what is in each dish with regards to meat and starch, most dishes appear to also include vegetables.  The portions of food are very generous, my friend ordered a spring roll appetizer which was made up of two very large spring rolls and at least one accompanying sauce for dipping (they put two dishes on the table, it was our guess what they were for). I had one of their udon dishes with chicken and it was very good. The large pieces of chicken were very moist and the noodles were cooked just right. Accompanying my meal was a watermelon bubble tea (without tapioca), this was the perfect complement to the meal.   When we were finished with a dish, the servers were quick and discrete about removing it. The servers generally were very attentive and even if we only saw them when they were bringing our order, it was never difficult to get their attention.  Price point is very reasonable for the amount of food you receive. I would not hesitate to return to this place, if I was looking for a casual, inexpensive dining experience. I would also highly recommend it to others."}
{"text":"While there are not tons of competing options, Pho Huong is one of the best places for lunch in the Junction.  While the service in here is harried and somewhat lacking, the food is delicious for the most part. Here are the high points...  1. Hot tea is served immediately when you are seated. 2. There is adequate seating, even for larger parties of 6-10. 3. The rice dishes can be bland, but are easily helped by the table hot sauce, which has a nice spicy kick to it. 4. The fried spring rolls are superb, as well as the non-fried option. 5. The vermicelli dishes and the soups are hot and delicious. 6. The place accepts credit cards and serves soft drinks, beer, and wine in addition to the hot tea. 7. Lunch prices range from 7-12$$."}
{"text":"Pho good. Rice not so good. Pho broth I found was one of the most tastier one I have had while not being so fatty. The rice dish however was a let down. I looked the broken rice but the pork and beef that came with it was not good at all. The pork was very thin and small. The beef was very chewy that I had to fight it to cut. Had so much more rice than the meat served. Definitely cheaped out. The place itself was clean. At least to Viet standards."}
{"text":"I work nearby, so I'm glad there's finally a pho place that I can get on my lunch break that actually tastes good. So far the food I've gotten were great; as close to authentic viet food as you can get IMO. I ordered the Bun Rieu and it was good! The soup was light, not too oily, and had real bits of crab claw. They could however add more slices of meat. I also ordered the my fave dish Bun Bo Hue and it was fantastic - veryyy spicy and flavorful, unlike other places that water it down. Great food in a great location, would def recommend!"}
{"text":"My family has been eating here for about 5 years and I think it went through a change of ownership but I've always found the food consistent. Our usual order is pho, vermicelli noodles, rice, spring rolls and shrimp rolls. Everything is comparable to what you can find in a restaurant in chinatown.  This is coming from a non-vietnamese BUT with a bunch of vietnamese friends :)  The soup is very flavourful and I don't think they use MSG.  The springrolls are really good as well.  The service is very good but on the minimal side.  My family eats here regularly (2 adults, 2 5 year olds) and we never have any issues.  I see lots of young kids here all the time.  Don't expect chit chat and you may have to flag them down when it's busy but they will take care of you.  In response to Rusty S. review, I've never, ever seen peas used here (or any vietnamese restaurant) in their soup so you may have left a review for the wrong restaurant."}
{"text":"This is my neighbourhood go-to Pho place. I order takeout from here as well as eat in. Food is always consistent and tasty.   My usual order is Rare Beef Noodle Soup and Spring Rolls, which comes to $16. Their milkshakes are good too, I often get an Avocado one.   Lots of parking nearby."}
{"text":"It's a strictly mediocre, reasonably-priced soup and noodle house. Every other place I've been is at least as good. Nobody goes there expecting the service to make the meal, but in this case, the service is a detracting factor: sullen and uncommunicative, the staff mopes along through their chores without a hint of joy or character. My kids like it and, after all is said and done, I love Vietnamese food, so I grudgingly return time and again."}
{"text":"This is the best place around, and the best in the city for Pho. On top of the exceptional food quality, you get friendly service (something often rare) and very very fast service. It gets packed throughout the day, and it's no wonder. The prices are good and everything else is great. We go there about once a week."}
{"text":"If you love sloppy noodles in ketchup with hidden shards of pointy plastic in it. This is the place for you.  Wanted something new near work. Thought I'd give them a try.  Ordered Pad Thai and a fresh salad roll. Got a deep fried spring roll and a big sharp piece of plastic in my first bite of the Pad Thai.  Barely an apology. They sent me a new order but only brought one of the 2 dishes I paid for. They didn't seem surprised or bothered about the fact sharp foreign object in my food over the phone.  In the end the pad Thai I got was pretty nasty. I was able to pick up the entire mass of noodles with my fork as it was all one solid knot of overcooked noodles covered in what may well have been ketchup. Actually I'm pretty sure it was ketchup.  The phone conversations were pretty stupid. In the end I didn't get a refund because it wasn't worth the annoying communication issues I had with the person on the phone.  Avoid."}
{"text":"+.5 for service  BlogTO listed Pho Huong as one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in Toronto. I decided to put this claim to the test during my day in The Junction yesterday (first time there as well!).  One thing I noticed right off the bat is that Pho Huong has vegan pho. I'm not vegan (or vegetarian for that matter), but for those who are this place is vegan-friendly. The interior decoration is also quite nice, and is in fact one of the more modern Vietnamese restaurants I've been to (doesn't look like it from the outside though).  I ordered the transparent noodle soup with sliced pork, pork feet and crab claw, as that's been my standard order nowadays in restaurants which offer that dish. The good thing here is that the transparent noodle is actually transparent (thick) noodle, not udon you get in your local Asian supermarket. However I found the noodles soggy and clumped together. You had to separate the noodles yourself once they give the dish to you, which isn't a huge inconvenience, but it does question the quality considering it was $10 for that bowl.  Service was excellent for an Asian restaurant in general, and this place did attract a decent crowd. However, would I return? Probably not in the near future, as I had better Vietnamese food in other places around the city."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Pho in the city. However, the service isn't the greatest - but I guess that's what you get for such cheap food.   Also, $4.00 for a bottle of beer! Schwingggg."}
{"text":"FREE DELIVERY! Good food. Average pricing. I hate to admit it but since I've learned about JustEat.ca, Pho Huong has become my go-to delivery spot. They open as early as 1030am - great for hangover pho, delivery is super fast, they deliver iced Vietnamese coffees and mango milkshakes too!   Food is a 3.5/4 as it's pretty average (in a good way) but the menu is quite big so venturing into unknown territory can be disappointing (U02. Stir fried udon noodles with beef) or you'll find new favourites (D05. Hanoi style vermicelli).   Btw those of you who like vermicelli, you have to try theirs! Thin vermicelli noodles and tons of different varieties of toppings. B18 is my favourite because there's a little bit if everything :)  ..Anywaysss sometimes I'm lazy and I love Vietnamese so thanks to delivery and consistency Pho Huong has earned a perfect 5 stars in my books"}
{"text":"It's nice and cozy on the inside, the service is good. The fresh rolls were not fresh at all, sticky and smelly. Although the pho is good, the broth and noodles are delicious."}
{"text":"Almost always packed for a reason. They make the best pho in Toronto and fantastic spring rolls.  It's reasonably priced with large portion sizes. A small pho is more than big enough for me."}
{"text":"I was in the neighbourhood for the Junction summer festival and hunger hit me.  Conveniently, I was standing in front of pho huong so I decided to sit down on the patio for a quick bite.   I got really nervous reading the all the negative reviews after I sat down and ordered but there was no turning back.  I ordered the chicken vermicelli with spring roll and to my relief, it was good!  The spring roll was a good size, not too thick or skinny. The chicken was quite flavourful with lots of veggies and thin noodles, my kinda meal. It cost $7.50 and the food arrived on the table within 5mins. Service was efficient so all in all, it gets a 4 star."}
{"text":"This WAS my neighborhood, decent go-to Vietnamese place - and I really want to like this place but have had it -after two consecutive  disappointingly bad experiences, I've been going elsewhere. (see my other reviews for an awesome pho place nearby!)  1) This summer we waited for 15 minutes for a table on the patio, only to be forgotten about and our table given to someone else. When we finally DID get a table, they forgot our order and it took forever just to bring our DRINKS! The food was just mediocre. Very slow and terrible service.  2) Last week I got Pho Ga take out. The broth tasted like WATER, with hardly any chicken flavor. Since Pho is generally about the broth, this was super disappointing. Also, we ordered a large, and the take out container for the broth was just over half full. Next, the chicken was dry and rubbery and seemed old.   So long Pho Huong!"}
{"text":"Got a rice dish(pork chop, grilled chicken and shrimp tofu), not up to my standards.  Avocado shake was ok but expensive for how small the portion of the drink was.  The menu is a bit expensive.  Service was ok, I wouldn't recommend this for anyone who's into their Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"This Pho place has the worst customer service ever!  The staff ignores you, and pretend they don't see you. As well, they all look like they don't want be there and gives attitude to customers. I even witnessed one of em arguing with one of the customers about their orders. Also, they mess up orders and they are so stingy with napkins as well. My brother and I went and asked for extra napkins because the hot tea spilled on the table... one of the waiters saw me and looked at me and rolled his eyes and pretend he didn't see me. My brother went up and asked him for extra napkins and gave him ONE PIECE of tissue and looked at him as if he just asked him for a hundred dollars.    I've been to a lot of pho places, but this by far had the worst customer service I've had. Too bad, since the food is not at all bad, but I'm not really too keen on becoming a regular to a restaurant where I don't even feel like I'm wanted there."}
{"text":"A solid 3.  Lots of items on the menu.  Most of them are well executed.  The Spring rolls and Hanoi-style soup must be tried.     On the downside, service is really slow especially compared to typical Pho places so don't go there if you're in any kind of rush.  Otherwise, enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been a regular here for about three years and have noticed a real decline in quality in the last year.  I always order the same bowl of rare beef, but they have become extremely inconsistent. Sometimes you get culantro, sometimes you don't. Sometimes the sprouts and basil are meagre and wilted and horrible, sometimes it is fresh and plentiful.  Recently it is definitely trending to being consistently bad. I often call for takeout and nobody picks up the phone. The broth is getting more and more murky and very dark.   It's really too bad, it used to be a great pho spot. Still very little good asian food in the junction and it filled that hole respectably."}
{"text":"Worst food ever. Ordered beef stew. More like beef soup. Carrots were hard and tasted like soap. Beef was dry. Boyfriend ordered a chicken soup and it tastes like boiled water. GROSSSSS!"}
{"text":"This place has gotten downhill.  Over the last year... 1. From credit to cash only. 2. Springrolls have thinned out. 3. Prices have increased. 4. Service is worst than the usual. 5. Service is also slower.  Very disappointed.  This was a go to for a lot of my friends and I but now... Intake the extra walk and go to St. Clair or even Ossington for my pho crave.  So disappointed."}
{"text":"If you order takeout, MAKE SURE EVERYTHING'S THERE!  The food here is great and the eat-in atmosphere is more than pleasant.  The problem comes when they have to put together your takeout order.  I live close by and have been an avid if not regular customer for 6 years.  Unfortunately (for me), the restaurant has made a large error with my to-go order at least 10 times.  It will be awhile before I give them another chance.....too bad."}
{"text":"I have been to Pho Huong multiple times over the last nine years or so. I loved this place and was proud to say the best pho was in my neighbourhood. Not anymore.  THE FOOD: There's an extensive menu, but the pho and the shakes are what makes it special.   The pros: The pho comes with a generous helping of mint. They also serve long coriander and onion, unlike Pho Hung. The pho rai cai has a more complex broth than most but this has become less and less flavourful over the years. They also have a completely veggie pho.  The cons: Ingredients are not that fresh.   THE SERVICE: Terrible. Takes forever for someone to take our order. My father never got a glass of water after asking for one repeatedly. Food does not come out all at once. Drinks come way after the food. And more than that, there just isn't a welcoming or inviting spirit - wait staff are neutral at best or snarling at worst. Nothing overtly rude but nothing that indicates they appreciate the business. And this is for a family that individually and together patronize this place multiple times a year for many years.   I will keep coming because of the veggie pho but there has been a serious decline in the quality of the food over the years. As for the rest of my family, I know my parents will think twice before going back.   Please restore yourself, Pho Huong. Make me proud again."}
{"text":"Thin springy noodles, the perfect al dente quality, soup is not too salty and probably no MSG, but flavourful enough. Rare beef is lean and sliced thinly. Beef balls are firm and chewy. These characteristics of my usual pho order is perfect. Spring rolls are also delicious. My one pet peeve is that they never give u small sharing plates with the apps, even if you ask for it. Food comes out quickly but sometimes there's a wait to have a server take your order, especially if you're sitting out on the patio. The patio is a nice option in the summer! Overall a clean and modern Vietnamese restaurant!"}
{"text":"When you have a bunch of hungry half drunk people to feed, you will be glad that you take them all to Pho Huong.  Pho Huong has a huge menu so everything can get something they feel like eating, from Pho, Grilled Meat with Rice, Even Vegetarian Bun and of course for me the Banh Coum Rice Roll!!  Food serves here came fast and pretty tasty, at least everyone clean their plates!  I really enjoy mine too...  Service is fast and efficient. Accepts Visa, MC and Debit.  I definitely will be back when I am in the area after a drink or 2!"}
{"text":"been here again on saturday, it was crowded but servers were attentive, my beef on vermicelli was brought fast and together with the milkshake, equally satisfying as first time. nothing to complain about, will be back :)"}
{"text":"Exactly! \"Meh. I've had it better.\" Had the #1 Pho Duc Biet. Broth was not steaming hot and the tendons are undercooked. Not coming back again.  Free wifi tho!!"}
{"text":"Huong up on pho? This place is fine by me, so check it out and get your slurp on.  This trendy looking, yet diner tasting, Vietnamese restaurant is large, sleek and friendly. Lined with black booths at the front, trendy lighting hanging above you and wooden tables at the back.    I ordered the large size soup, which is just too big. I got the rare beef and sprouts and kicked it up with rooster sauce and a little soya, and it was decent. In general, I'm a defeatist when it comes to pho. I am not very good at ordering it, and I don't try to get better. It's always fine, but if you have ever been wowed by pho then I advise you to never, ever follow my order. Go your own way, young jedi, you know better than I.   PEPPER POINTS for their TV at the back on CP24. Very handy for keeping up to date with Rob Ford goss while you dine."}
