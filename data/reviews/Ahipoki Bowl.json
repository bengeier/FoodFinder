{"text":"Glad they opened a place like this around here. Had poke in Venice beach last year this place is not as good but I'll take it. I did think the portions were a little light I would have liked more ahi than toppings. Overall really liked it & will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This rating in no way reflects the quality of the restaurant itself, but it reflects the Poki. Unless you have been to Hawaii and specifically visited places such as Da Poke Shack in Kona then you have nothing to rate this restaurant against. That being said, this restaurant is an \"OK\" place considering it is located smack dab in the middle of the desert...

If you think this is going to measure to the freshness and quality of Hawaii you are going to be sorely disappointed. But, if you are looking for some poki to hold you over until you return to the island this restaurant will suffice."}
{"text":"Coming from LA I was overwhelmed by how fresh Ahipoki was. The fish was amazing (I had the tuna and salmon), the brown rice was cooked perfectly (I had half salad half rice), loved all the toppings and the atmosphere of the restaurant was spot on. I could have sat there all day. It's clean, fabulous lighting and the staff was very friendly. HIGHLY recommend it."}
{"text":"Interesting little place.  In a nutshell it's basically raw fish/seafood over rice or salad.  I chose the salad option with two types of ahi tuna, one plain and one marinated.  I combined this with the citrus sauce which tasted like a sweet vinaigratte, so good.  I topped it off with Edamame, crab, onions, jicama, sprouts, and cucumber.  Overall the combination was better than I expected.  As an avid sushi eater, it was a refreshing way to eat sashimi instead of the heavy rice.  The regular portion was a good lunch size and paired with a drink was around $11.  I would suggest going by 11:30 since it did get busier around noon.  And definitely get the citrus sauce!"}
{"text":"Food is very good and fresh. I hate the plastic box they gave me. Not condusive to eating out with a flapping top. Help doesn't seem to know what they are doing and not explaining or suggesting. I hope the manager can squash some of these issues. I hope they open up one in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying the food is delicious.  I was excited to hear that there was finally a poke spot here in Arizona.  Unfortunately, the staff was extremely rude.  The both times I came here, the staff was frustrated and annoyed because of they weren't able to hear what the customers were ordering due poor design of the glass partitions being too high.  I was told by one of the staff members with attitude to \"speak over the glass.\" Sure, I'll get right on that... I'll increase my height by one foot just to order food.  Maybe the staff should clean out their ears and lose their attitudes.  

The only way I'd be back is if the customer service improves... seems highly unlikely since it's located in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Very good. A bit hectic in line. A bit hectic in dining room. Was there with two small children, the mgr noticed, came over and offered the 2 y/o a plain bowl of rice. Little did he know the 2yo eats everything. The 5yo is picky so we had to bring in a ham& cheese from subway next door which didn't cause a problem. 
For sure will return."}
{"text":"If I could have one food for the rest of my life it would be this . I have tried other poke places that have been popping up everywhere and they just can't compete . Sauces are great , fish is great toppings are awesome. Octopus is my favorite and the other places just don't do it like this place does . My bowl ends up being huge because you can get whatever toppings you want for under 13 $ awesome steal !!"}
{"text":"After going to Hawaii several times, I've been craving poke and I have to say this place is legit. I love that you can customize your bowl. The food is always delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Great quality fish for a very reasonable price, I'd have to say I'm hooked! Cod it was good. Eely eely good :)

Loved the Chipotle style, create your own bowl line service that they have going on here! Both my boyfriend and I each ordered the Regular size bowl (which comes with two scoops of your choice of fish), and it came with so much food that neither one of us could finish our own individual bowls. Definitely not skimping on their servings. I did White Rice, spicy tuna, salmon, with spicy creamy sauce and ALL of the toppings. I don't know that I would change my order at all when I go back next time because it was delicious, filling, and financially satisfying. My boyfriend opted for the half salad half rice as the base of his Poke, and he said that coming back he'd change it up and just go for the rice. (He thought when he ordered the salad that he was actually ordering the delicious seaweed salad that is actually one of the toppings, poor guy missed putting it in his bowl at all! Luckily I like him enough to share my food with him and ended up giving him most of mine. If that's not love, I don't know what is.)

Over all it was a great experience. Delicious food, fast and friendly service, and a clean establishment."}
{"text":"Step 1: Pick your rice or salad base, or both. Step 2: they'll load it up with fresh, savory poke chunks and top it off with all the ingredients you could hope for: I went with sesame seeds, roasted seaweed, edamame and green onion. Step 3: Eat it too fast to remember to take a picture because it's so stinkin' good. I came here by accident thinking it was the old Ahimahi place, and I am not sorry at all! If you love poke then this fast-casual concept is perfect. Well-priced for what you get, and the interior is so clean and upbeat."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious, filling, and fairly priced (in my opinion)! I got a regular size with half white rice, half salad, onion, salmon, shrimp, light house spicy sauce, edamame, crab salad, green onion, sesame seeds, chili flakes, and creamy spicy drizzle. This was so filling, so fresh, and so delicious! I didn't notice that my food was overly salty and it was the right amount of spicy for me. This is a new favorite restaurant of mine and I definitely will be going back!"}
{"text":"I fell in love with poke when I went to Hawaii several years ago.  I have been craving it ever since and have been waiting for a restaurant like this to pop up in the valley.  Perfect concept.  Think Chipotle, but with poke.  Assembly line set-up like Chipotle makes the ordering process run smoothly.  The tuna and salmon are really tasty and flavorful.  I got a three item bowl (salmon, tuna, and spicy tuna) for ~$11 and left stuffed.  Really reasonably priced for what you're getting.  

I'm glad this place isn't that close to my house because I would go every day."}
{"text":"This place is my favorite place to eat! The staff and food is amazing! My boyfriend and I eat here at least 3 times a week! Also Jessica is so sweet there! I recommend this place to EVERYBODY"}
{"text":"Note: I'm not a big sushi fan, so automatically my pallet will skew this rating. I mainly posted the mediocre review due to one of the guys running the counter being very unfriendly and a jerk to each of our group individually. I don't think the rest of the staff was like this, but just our particular experience."}
{"text":"First time trying Ahipoke bowl and it was fan freakin tastic. I'm a huge fan of poke so I had to go and see what the hype was about. DEFINITELY coming back again soon."}
{"text":"pretty unique idea, although the menu items don't mix together very well. kept getting big chunks of wasabi by accident!"}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to this place. I really liked it. Great food. Check it out if you haven't been."}
{"text":"LOVE this place! Everything about it is fantastic! As soon as you walk in you are greeted by this staff. Each and everyone of them always smiles at you and says hello. They truly seem happy to be making whatever creation you come up with!  The feel is similar to chipotle as you go down the line and pick what ingredients you want however the service could not be any different. I always feel so rushed at chipotle and I never leave there feeling good. However at Ahipoke, The staff is genuinely nice! Also, the food is amazing. The quality of the fish is so fresh and the portions are very generous. I do half brown rice, half salad, 1 scoop salmon, 1 scoop tuna, scoop of crab meat, Edamame, jimica, sprouts, sesame seeds and pepper flakes. I love mixing the house spicy and sweet citrus dressing! It has become a staple when going out and we go 3-4 times a month."}
{"text":"I was soooo happy when this place opened! My mom is from Hawaii so I couldn't wait to try this place. They have one fish option that is pre-marinated which is the most authentic poke option so I recommend getting this one, otherwise when you get any of the other fish options they just pour the sauce on top, which is still good....just less authentic."}
{"text":"I used to frequent Ahipoki Bowl much more until they raised their prices a couple times. The seafood is good and if you get the right server you can get some healthy portions, but they get extremely busy at lunch and I never really want to deal with the lines at the time that I am the most hungry. The lucky one rush also brings some parking issues, but it's understandable with a couple other lunch options in close proximity. If it's an off time, Ahipoki is definitely still a contender for food in my book."}
{"text":"This is a great little spot for Poke. We are not from the area and we're within walking distance which was an added bonus. Great, fresh fish. Loved the options too. Would come back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Great food, line is a little slow moving. Protein portions are on the small side for the price. Nice healthy option for lunch."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review after my first visit. Wasn't sure what I was getting myself into and they were very busy so I kinda just rolled with it. Ended up getting a salad with a whole bunch of toppings. When I got home I mixed the salad all up and it honestly didn't look that presentable. Just looked like a mess but WOW I took my first bite and was blown away. It was absolutely amazing. By far my new favorite thing to eat."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved my experience here. The restaurant has a nice atmosphere and plenty of seating. The fish was unbelievably fresh and delicious. Serving size was plentiful and the prices were low. Definitely a bang for your buck! I highly recommend trying this place out if you're a sushi lover. It's a fun experience and isn't too tough on the wallet."}
{"text":"I hope Ahipoki is successful enough to drum up demand for solid poké, because this ain't it. 

This chain exists as the preeminent missing link between deliciousness and mainstream acceptance- one day rich white Scottsdaliens will understand inexpensive poké with shoyu and POG, but for now, you'll have to fork up $10 for a couple cubes of chewy fish with \"house sauce\" and \"tropical drink\".

Two headscratchers I left with:
Why red onion and not maui onion?
Why is wasabi offered as a topping and not near the dressing? Who wants a 2tbsp heap of un-dispersed wasabi on top of their bowl?"}
{"text":"Great food, great price! I am a fan! Got the two scoop spicy tuna and salmon. The staff was super helpful and patient since it was my first time in. Everything was super fresh, fast and tasted delicious. I got the house sauce, And did half brown rice and salad. I was a fan, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Ok simple food prepared with fresh ingredients. The spice tuna and yellowtail were tasty. The rice was perfectly cooked with a hint of sweetness.  Nice size portions, I couldn't finish and great price.  You get sushi quality at chipotle prices."}
{"text":"Honestly did not know what I was in for before coming here, was expecting something similar to the place that was there before since the names are similar and seems to be the same owners. Basically, it's a sushi bowl or salad. Now I love sushi, however this place will take some getting use to. They need to keep the kitchen space clean as will with no boxes everywhere and the rice maker open. Also the food line could use some work."}
{"text":"I get the spicy tuna bowl with spicy creamy sauce. I literally drive out of my way to come to this place. It's that good."}
{"text":"Good food at a good price.  Lots of fun choices and very filling! I usually get the organic salad and a scoop of brown rice, tuna or salmon or tuna luau (their poke).  The sauces are good and the toppings are fun ... i usually get them all since it is so healthy.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"First off, it's about time Phoenix opened a poki bowl joint! The build your own bowl line style is pretty similar to a lot of other poke places I've been to in California. I was not overly impressed but I would still come back to eat when the mood strikes. 

The bugged negative is the portion size and balance of ingredients. It seemed I got way too much rice and salad and not enough of the fish and toppings. I would have preferred each bite to have a nice balance of all toppings for the flavor profile that a poki bowl should be. This could possibly be improved by using bowls instead of huge square to go containers and training the line to better portion out toppings. The fish was decent and my \"hot creamy sauce\" tasted good. The staff was friendly and the interior was easy and fun."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch during the week and it was very busy! It's like a chipotle/subway style where there's a line and you tell the people behind the glass what you want in your bowl/salad and they add it in as you go along. I got the half-half brown rice salad, regular size (2 scoops), with avocado, tuna and yellow tail, house spicy sauce, and all the toppings. They also have cracked red pepper, dried seaweed, and sesame seeds you can get on top of your bowl. They give you a lot of toppings (definitely a higher topping:raw fish ratio) but everything tasted good and they didn't overdo the sauce which I was happy about. The fish wasn't super flavorful but I guess that's why they have so many toppings. Their wasabi also packs a strong punch so make sure you mix it in well otherwise have some napkins ready for your tears."}
{"text":"I've ate here twice now and wouldn't give this place 5 stars, but it's good enough for 4 stars. A chipotle style fast casual restaurant where you get to pick and choose your toppings. I do wish they had a list of the topping next to the actual toppings. It definitely gets confusing if you didn't memorize the menu when headed down the line. The food does taste good though. The rice is ok. They do put way to much sauce in your food though. I'm sure I'll get the sauce on the side next time. Never thought about mixing some of these items together but it works! I'll definitely go again when looking for another quick meal that is semi healthy."}
{"text":"Sushi Bowls and Thai Iced Tea.

Run, don't walk!

FYI - Green Tea is not sweetened. I thought it was because it was in the big fountains like the Thai Tea, it's not."}
{"text":"my girlfriend and I are originally from Maui, so naturally when we read about this place we were excited to try it since there are very few places in the Phoenix area that offer poke bowls.

the staff was very friendly and the food was great!  the ahi tasted fresh and the prices are reasonable for what you're getting ($8.95 for regular bowl.)

we will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I have been to Ahipoki Bowl last Saturday with my friend. It is a poke place which serves raw fish salad. It is Hawaiian style salad which always served as an appetizer in Hawaiian cuisine. The restaurant is located in Scottsdale with clean glass doors and windows which allow you to see inside of the restaurant easily. Inside of the restaurant is a home like place, very clean and bright. It is a popular place to get healthy food fast and cheap, so it is always busy during lunch and dinner time. Me and my friend went there when they about to close, so there weren't many people in the restaurant. When I first enter the door I saw a huge board showing the ordering process which is very clear. This restaurant had similar concept with Chipotle. Different kinds of food were shown clearly waiting for you to order. Along the wall there were several booths and tables in the middle. 
The service I had was fast and friendly, everyone was very patient explaining the ordering process. When you were ready to order, they would pull out a plastic box and started to add things in it. First you needed to choose the base whether rice or salad or half and half. I had all the base to be salad in order to control my carbohydrate intake. Second, you could choose the fish, they had many options like tuna, salmon, shrimp, scallop and so on. I chose tuna and salmon. The third step was choosing your sauce, I had the classic house sauce. Then I had some other vegetable as my topping and I paid extra fee for a scoop of avocado. 
After paying my food for $11.33 which I thought was reasonable. I sat down and mixed my salad up. The house sauce was very special. It wasn't like those traditional salad sauce but it was more like a kind of oil make the salad very delicious. The raw fish was fresh and taste good with the house sauce. In addition, the avocado and other vegetable I had made my salad more flavorful. They also served Brick macaron ice cream sandwiches which looked tasty. I think I would try them out next time. My friend paid almost the same price as mine. But he ordered half rice and half salad as his base. He said he was kind of disappointed that the rice wasn't sushi like but the octopus and yellowtail weren't bad since Arizona wasn't very close to the ocean. My friend had spice creamy which was his favorite, he said it reminded him of Chipotle. 
The experience in Ahipoki Bowl was pretty good overall, the service was fast and friendly and price was reasonable and food was fresh and tasty. But there were things could be improved, for example, if they replace the disposable plastic boxes with more environment friendly container and had more other healthy options as snakes like nuts and yogurt which could inherence  the healthy image of the restaurant."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly staff, & decent tuna.   Love the efforts in introducing one of Hawaii's popular appetizers as a meal.

So if you're Hawaiian, don't expect the same care when preparing poke and traditional flavor.

But it is good for fast food.  More importantly, a Great place to get healthy food after a good  workout."}
{"text":"The food is good, the price is ok. However the staff is terrible. 

The first time my boyfriend and I went everyone seem annoyed when we asked questions about what was what since there were no signs. But the food was good so we gave it another shot. 

Second time - no better. Everyone seems annoyed. We got one large with half salad and half rice and one regular with salad. The guy was annoyed when he confused it and switched it up. 

Still gave it a third chance. Guy misunderstood us both twice in what kind of bowls we wanted. And then told us we needed to \"move it along\" because of the line. Huh? Get to the next part of the line and the guy passes our food to the next woman and makes a comment under his breath to which she laughs hysterically at... Awesome.. Got home and my boyfriend got food poisoning. 

So honestly I'm surprised by all the great reviews. Yes the food is good and I would go back if everyone wasn't so rude all the time. Deal killer."}
{"text":"Horrible. Horrible. Horrible. Don't go here. Worst customer service EVER. And the fish is poor quality, very fatty. I would suggest going to Sprouts for a Poke bar, better prices too. Other places to go besides this place for Poke: Coconut's Fish Cafe and Hula's Mordern TiKi, both are so good!!!!!"}
{"text":"So good! I haven't had one since I was in Hawaii and its just like the ones down there. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Ahipoki is a fun and fast place to get your poke fix. As you go down the line, you select what you want in your bowl. You can choose from brown or white rice or salad as a base, and then add sashimi, avocado, sauces, and other toppings to customize your meal.

The atmosphere and music is always good and I do really like this restaurant. The only thing I struggle with is that the employees do not always seem terribly happy to serve you and that the rice is often over or under cooked. The place definitely is worth trying! :)"}
{"text":"When I visited, there was a hair in one of the fish options, and the line worker just scooped a handful of fish out instead of discarding the entire tray. Very unsanitary. Also the drain under the soda fountain smelled awful, like it had not been cleaned. The food that I did try, a bit apprehensively, was very tasty and filling, with vibrant color and bright flavors. I just wish their food handling was a bit more sanitary."}
{"text":"I just ate here for the first time and absolutely loved it. The atmosphere is a well organized, clean and inviting place. It seemed busy, but the line moves really quickly because the staff is so well organized and helpful. I wasn't sure what to order, but everything is labeled and beautifully presented, so choosing my meal was easy. 
I ordered a large salad and it was a huge portion. Honestly, I'm not a huge sushi eater, but the food tasted so fresh and delicious, it's truly my new favorite lunch spot."}
{"text":"We really love coming here because the food is always so good. Everyone was so friendly when they first opened and made sure to give you what you pay for. 

They charge extra for avacado which I understand, most places do

You pay for the scoops of fish, the last three times we have been there they literally have given us like a half of a scoop and then the last time my husband was like um? Can I please have more that's like no fish ( the scoopers are tiny btw ) when you're paying for three scoops you want three scoops...

The associate was like sure but it's an extra charge.

Ok... So we have to pay more to get a normal scoop. 
That's basically what happened. 
So that's fine whatever. 

As they scoop your items into the rice after tossing it in sauce they manage to miss some of it like the onions and fish etc and just leave it in the bowl and throw it under the counter..
Um? If I'm paying extra for all of this can you make sure it ALL makes it into my bowl!!? 

I get to the toppings and ask for crab.
That's my favorite part. 
She gives me the TINIEST scoop. So I'm like can I have a little more please ? 

Sure, but we have to charge you. That's new.

Ok... 

Then for every topping we got it was like the gave us enough for a mouse. 
It's kindof awkward to keep asking for a little more when they're staring at you like you're inconvenient. Also, I'm afraid to ask because they're literally going to charge me a dollar for everything I was extra of. Which I can understand if the correct portion is given, but if you're gonna be stingy and not give me the amount I am paying for and then charge me I'm gonna be pissed. 

If you ask for extra of the sauce that coats the fish they give you a container with not even enough to cover your rice. Which I find kindof pointless. Especially for us because we usually each order the bigger bowl. 

So anyways, we get to the end of the line and they don't even know which bowl is ours and they try and close it with all the toppings sticking out so it doesn't even shut, so make sure you double check that so it doesn't all fall out. 

My husband so nicely asks for some soy sauce since our order is to go and they say how many. 
He said, 3 each. The owner/ manager or whoever looked at us super rude. 

So they give use two packets.........total. So one each. For all of this rice that dry and doesn't taste like sushi rice. LOL.


Ok... 

We won't be back. Would rather take our business to poki bar central on Indian school it's way better and cheaper."}
{"text":"Fresh, fast, tasty. The only con is there is too much rice compared to the shrimp and tuna I received . Will be back."}
{"text":"This is a cool idea - the chipotle of sushi! But.. it's poorly executed. The fish seems less than premium and all of the \"add ins\" are just a poor attempt at enhancing an otherwise bland dish. I've gotten mildly sick both times I've eaten here."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh my best friend brought me a salad from here the other day and I am now in love. I absolutely love and have found one of my favorite places to eat in the city. Yum"}
{"text":"Im from cali and first time here.. food was OK but staff seems not to happy don't smile like they have the problem of the world.. not happy employee result not a happy customer.... don't review like this but what can I say..."}
{"text":"Stars are for the food. It was very tasty. 
Told the guy I'd never been there before and he said \"ok\" and stared at me blankly. The concept isn't too hard to figure out, but dude, you work in the service industry. You know the deal. 
Got the \"half and half\" rice/salad. Tuna. Didn't realize you could get more than one fish until the girl said \"JUST TUNA?\" 
Asked for all my toppings and when the girl went for the crab I said \"No, I didn't want that.\" She glared at me before realizing I'd asked for the ginger.
The cashier asked if I wanted a receipt as I handed her my card, then when I said no, looked off to the side and waited till I left without saying thank you. 
Awful service, but my food was delicious. That's why it gets 4 stars."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try this place, and am happy I finally did! Already can't wait to go back. I have quite the appetite, so I was worried the regular size wouldn't be enough... it definitely was plenty of food for a great value. Only feedback is I wish they could figure out a better system for waiting in line."}
{"text":"Tasty, sushi/sashimi bowl. Filling and healthy"}
{"text":"This opened around the corner from me and I've been a few times. Never been disappointed. The amount of food you get for the price is great. I would normally be skeptical about the quality when buying raw fish from a place that serves so much so fast but it's always been pretty good."}
{"text":"I spend a lot of time in Hawaii, and eat a lot of fresh ahi poki there. I've also eaten at the other poki places in scottsdale. I've tried this place twice now and think it's just ok to others. Fresh fish poke should be cold, and the poke I got was so warm when I got home from a 3 minute car ride, I had to put it in the freezer for 20 minutes to make it cold! The portions are smaller than that of their competition. A large poke bowl at poke bar will get you for scoops of fish and the bowl will have about 20% rice. At this place, a large gets you just 3 scoops of fish and is about 40% rice. Also, less options here than others like no jalepinos or corn. Also, not sure why they close at 9pm. Chipotle next door stays open until 10pm. On a recent weeknight I went to ahopoki at 9:15 and they had just closed, so I went next door to chipotle and there were 18 people in line stretching all the way out the door. It's a busy late night area, so just a suggestion to stay open later. These are all easy fixes....step it up ahipoke bowl and I'll update my review."}
{"text":"Food was great, service was great. The best pokebowl place I've ever eaten at. I wasn't too impressed with the green tea though."}
{"text":"Love this place! Such a simple concept, but so yummy! Everything was fresh, place was busy, and everything was tasty! Hope to see more locations soon. Give it a try :)"}
{"text":"It's just great tasting food and fast. We showed up to a line out the door but we had our food in no time at all. My girlfriend tried the salad while I had the rice bowl. The spicy creamy sauce was delicious and the staff was very nice. Restaurant was very clean and we can't wait to come back. Well done guys it's no wonder we always saw you so busy when we drove by. Glad we came in."}
{"text":"This is place is amazing! I was a bit nervous about all the raw fish because I love sushi but tend to lean more towards the rolls that are fully cooked but I LOVED it. It was so good that by the time I remembered to take a picture I was almost done (I won't even post the picture)! I got the half/half with rice and salad. Then my 3 meat choices were spicy tuna, shrimp and salmon with the house spicy and creamy sauce and it was very good. You honestly don't even need the rice, next time I am just getting just the salad. The portions are huge too I was only able to eat half."}
{"text":"Food: 
Very fresh, well prepped. I loved the variety of dressings and toppings - had a great lunch with my mom. The staff were sharp and friendly and did a good job of presenting the food.

The only thing about this place that I don't like is the acoustics. The soundscape is like the chicken factory in Napoleon Dynamite. Every surface is hard and reflective. It's hard for the staff to hear your order, hard to hear any conversation your dining partner offers - and it just kind of raises the overall stress level. It made me want to finish up and get the heck out of there. 

So.... great food, ambience a bit off-putting - but I will be back."}
{"text":"Best tuna I've had in Az. I typically don't eat sushi in AZ, due to quality. 

Was very fresh."}
{"text":"This place was great!  Way better than expected. And I grew up in Hawaii. Super fresh and clean very good flavor."}
{"text":"I swear I was in heaven when I walked in here all the different types of seafood and the bowl is 100% custom to what I like. I had half rice half solid yellow tail shrimp octopus and tuna all in one bowl and the toppings are amazing and there are tons to choose from. You absolutely have to try this place if you like poke bowls or sushi. The staff was friendly I liked it so much I went back twice once for lunch and once for dinner. Prices are way more affordable than going out to eat and just as delicious."}
{"text":"Absolutely a gem in the Valley of the Sun. Generous and amazing toppings. I had the large (half rice and salad) and amazing heaping of delicious poke, a myriad of toppings and great sauce. Service was lovely and I was so excited to try and to tell everyone about it."}
{"text":"Great for a quick serve lunch meal -- healthy, fresh, and well priced.  Recommend for seafood lovers and veggie-friendly people looking for a fast bite."}
{"text":"My first time here. I was brought by a friend who loves it. It was good food but poor customer service.  Staff was rude and very unapproachable, made the experience unpleasant."}
{"text":"Ahi Poki...I have a love/hate relationship with you. 

The problem is that you are so damn good, that I am clinically addicted. I get a salad style poke with Spicy creamy sauce, tuna luau + salmon and virtually all of the fixins. 

Good thing I only live here part time or my people'd probably be calling the folks over at intervention to stop me from eating there every day."}
{"text":"Not packed with content looking people for no reason...absolutely fresh and delicious fast-casual type restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great food, great price! Love going to this place for lunch, but get there early as it can get pretty darn crowded."}
{"text":"My first pokebowl experience and I'm so glad I got to spend it here!! Menu style was pretty easy to read and order from. You choose your base of rice, salad or half and half with choices of meat, sauce and toppings. Depending on what size pokebowl you get, you can order different amounts of toppings (ex. 2 meats vs 3 meats) so make sure you're not missing out on anything!! I also got to try their green tea ice cream macaron and it was a perfect dessert option to end my meal. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since day one.  It's always a good experience.  Love this place.  I am here at least once a week.  Always good, great concept, friendly staff.  Julio is always sure to remember your order.  Portion size is just right where I don't leave feeling bloated or in a food Coma. Thanks for the great service!!  Dave"}
{"text":"Not worth the price if you're vegetarian or vegan!  They charge the same price regardless of if you get fish or not.  This just does not make sense because at any sushi restaurant you go to the vegetarian rolls are always significantly cheaper than the ones with quality fish.  They used to offer a vegetarian bowl for 50% off regular price which was awesome! Then without warning, they increased the price.  Unfortunately, I do not come here anymore because it's not worth it to pay $10-$12 for rice and a few toppings."}
{"text":"Go to place when I'm craving something healthier and fresh after a long day from work. Staff is awesome and pleasant every time."}
{"text":"They started charging for sides and reducing the protein quality. No Bueno. Loved going here every week."}
{"text":"Great location and great food! Not sure how they do it in the desert, but the freshness of the seafood is the first thing you will notice. The place is always clean and the service is great. Seems like the lines can be long but they move fast, super important since we have minimal time for lunch. If you have not tried it yet, you are missing out!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for good poke you'll find it here. The line always moves quickly even though this place can get busy at lunch. The process is similar to going down the line at Chipotle or Subway. Pick your base (rice or lettuce), your protein (salmon, tuna, yellowtail, etc), your sauce, and then topping galore.

I've always found the proteins and toppings to be fresh and good quality. I really enjoy their house sauce and furikake. This is my go-to poke place when I'm coming from the office."}
{"text":"Best pokey bowl in town! The tuna is better than the competition! The dry toppings at spunky flavor are the best!!  The house sauce is great. There is a reason this place is so busy. The location is not as convenient and far south Scottsdale but it is worth the drive. Can't wait to go again and order the exact same dish! It's that good."}
{"text":"I am addicted to this place!!! It is always busy when I go so obviously other people feel the same too. The line goes down really quickly though so don't let it put you off. Always so fresh. What a great concept. I tell everyone about it. You need to open more!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I like how you can customize your bowl. Don't want rice? Just ask for the base to be organic lettuce, then choose your fish, sauce and toppings. The large size is quite filling, but doesn't leave you feeling stuffed and sluggish. Everything is fresh and made to order to your desire.  You can't go wrong eating here for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Amazing fresh fish, at a great price. So many options I can have something different each time I come. Excited to have a healthy fast lunch or dinner option."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I got really sick from this place. I got salmon,  he got spicy tuna. I've been throwing up/nauseous for 3 days! Dr says it's most likely from the raw fish. Never eating here again! Word of caution to those wanting to try the poke craze. I'm not sure the fish is properly kept at the right temps when sitting out in big piles \"Chipotle\" style"}
{"text":"Really good - met a friend here for lunch, and it was delightful - aside from the fact the AC was out and they had a big industrial fan going (maybe I should take that back, if was pretty funny watching people flailing about to catch their napkins flying off their trays).
Fresh, great portions, for a great price.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch!  It was quick and fresh. good cheap lunch spot, my girlfriend and I will be back :)"}
{"text":"Yum. A must try. The scallops and ahi with everything and spicy house dressing. Amazing!"}
{"text":"If you love sushi, it absolutely does not get better than this. The value for your sushi dollar is beyond compare. Be sure to get half/half, which is your choice of rice and mixed greens, and then pile on all the freebies! There is no other place where you can satisfy that sushi/salad craving for so few dollars$$!"}
{"text":"I'd be willing to drive out of my way to this spot, if I wasn't dealt a helping of smirk with my service. 

The poke bowls are nothing to complain about and are as filling as all the other reviews lead you to believe. I had a scoop of tuna and yellowtail over white rice, with crab salad, and the fish was surprisingly tasty. Yellowtail can get really fishy, but these were nice, fatty, mild cuts. 

It was clear during my visit that the staff is young, probably disinterested, and definitely tired of answering the same questions from diners. Part of that problem could be remedied by signage to help diners see what their options are when they get to the toppings section. 

An unfortunate layout doesn't remedy the crummy attitudes of the employees, though. I was repeatedly snapped at by each employee on the line by asking simple questions about the menu. 

The icing on the cake? Each table was covered in trash and smeared Sriracha sauce."}
{"text":"I love this place!!! I almost can't get enough Ahi Poke but this location is by far the best I have been to.  Clean, concise and friendly service. So happy that Phoenix has gotten into the Poke bowl rage.  

Go check it out if you like Sushi!"}
{"text":"Last time I will order food from this place. They used to give you want you paid for. This is the portion of fish I received. Weak! Customer lost!"}
{"text":"I'm about to be a wet blanket here but I really don't know about this place. I brought my husband here and honestly both of our faces registered no emotion while we ate. That's not a great sign. I got a large plate with half rice and half salad with salmon, crab, and tuna. The food was okay- the biggest issue of all was the warm fish. It just wasn't cold enough and that really brought the taste down. 
In addition- the service was blah. I was really excited to be there and had a few questions for the guys behind the counter. Their answers were kind of curt and annoyed. 
I'm not sure if I will return, the prices just don't justify the food."}
{"text":"I love this place! My husband and I have driven 40 minutes one way on three occasions because we wanted to eat here. We love it! Each time I've gone I've gotten a bowl with white rice a scoop of spicy tuna and a scoop of salmon. I guess house spicy and spicy creamy sauce, and I have them put everything on it except the sprouts. Seriously so delicious. The only problem that I have is they don't have a location in North Phoenix. Please please please for the love of all that is good: Open a location in north Phoenix!!! Then again this could be bad, because I would probably eat here every single day!!"}
{"text":"A great healthy unique alternative to the other options in the complex. Delicious fresh seafood served the way you choose. Similar to chipotle you choose if you want salad or rice , choose your two portions of seafood, sauce, and other options like seaweed salad, cucumbers Ect. It was so tasty and healthy. I had the ahi on brown rice with cucumbers, seaweed salad with a creamy spicy sauce. My mom had salmon and shrimp and her salmon was so good I'll try that next time. We ordered green tea but weren't fans and asked if we could get the Thai iced tea instead and the cashier was accommodating and nice about it. Liked the Thai iced tea much better. Everyone was friendly and patient as you make your choices. The place itself is modern and cool decor with cool lighting fixtures and a nautical theme. Excited that this place is here!"}
{"text":"OMG YUM! Love this place. Friendly staff and if you fill out the contact card you get 50% off next bowl. Cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill quickly. I don't know if they changed owners, or even managers but it very different from when it first opened. Employees are rude, can't get your order right and forget to put all of your order in your bag when you pay. The restaurant skimps on toppings and charges for any little bit you want more. Got home with my order today ( which I had to go back for part of it since he didn't put it in the bag) and it was all wrong. Like they added stuff after they saw I left without it, or gave me the wrong stuff all together. It was for my kid, who wouldn't eat it because it had the spices sauce added to it.  Extremely disappointing."}
{"text":"Ahipoki is my new staple. Chipotle style sushi. It has reduced my sushi restaurant outings because I can get a large bowl of rice/salad/sushi/topping goodness for under $15. About the price of one roll most places. Super healthy if you want it to be. The staff is always great, it's kid friendly, and I like the restaurant decor/setup. Go try it!"}
{"text":"Ahipoki bowl looks like a chain restraint it's very clean and costumer service is great! You go subway style by adding your food on to a bowl of rice, brown rice, or salad! I personally went safe with Salmon and Spicy Tuna then added on all the toppings I could and mixed it up with they're Spicy House sauce. The price is Moderate especially for all the fresh fish you will be getting and it's worth the money! It tastes amazing and the spices mix well!! All the spices they add on top you get to pick and choose to make the perfect meal. You can't go wrong!

My family accompanied me on this trip and one person got fresh octopus and yellowtail and they were extremely fresh as well!"}
{"text":"Definitely my new go-to for a quick, healthy bite. I really hope this place sticks around longer than its predecessors! Basically it's a Chipotle style format with build your own poke bowls. You start with a base of white or brown rice, mixed greens, or half and half. Then you choose your fishes (they have like 10 options! Tuna, scallops, shrimp, octopus, yellowtail etc.), then pick your sauce, and finally load it up with toppings. Everything is pretty clearly labeled so you know what your options are, plus there's little to go menus laying about so you can get a good idea of what you want before you order. 
Small bowls with two scoops of fish are around $9 and large bowls with three scoops are about $11. I think it's a pretty good value considering the freshness and healthy factor. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is I think they could stand to be just slightly more generous with the scoops of fish. But other than that I love Ahi Poki and plan on visiting at least once a week. I even waited in line over 30 minutes on their official grand opening to get half price delicious ahi goodness!"}
{"text":"Great place to get a quick healthy lunch! I would highly recommend. Fresh food and good service. I would give it 5 stars but I save those for fine dining experiences. Good job and see you guys soon!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING. Stopped in for lunch and ordered the half & half with white rice & salad. Topped mine with spicy tuna, salmon, fish eggs, jicama, avocado, onions, and their spicy sauce. I also got their tropical drink which was on the sweet side however I could not stop drinking it! Very fast, fresh, and delicious!"}
{"text":"No complaints--happy customer! This is a chipotle style poki joint! Fresh fish, delicious and interesting toppings (avocado, crab salad, sprouts, to name a few) and quick service. Would recommend and return again!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are huge sushi fans, and we absolutely love this place! One of our favorite casual date night restaurants. The price is right and the food is always fresh. The employees are always friendly and service is always fast. We used to live in the area, but still travel from Mesa just to eat here. I highly recommend eating here! The tuna luau is amazing, the spicy creamy sauce is a must, and the tai tea is probably the best town."}
{"text":"I'm so happy there is FINALLY a poke' place in AZ and no too far of a drive for me.  I went for lunch on opening day and the food was fresh and tasty!  Not how I'm used to enjoying poke' but I will definitely be going back.  Very good!!"}
{"text":"A little fishy (no pun intended) seeing all the top 5 star reviews being elite '16. This place at best is 3 stars. I ordered a regular bowl with white rice, avocado, luau tuna, and salmon spicy cream sauce, and seaweed salad. Being my first time there I didn't really know how to order. First issue is after ordering I looked at my receipt and saw an extra dollar charge for avocado. No where in the online menu or store board does it say add a dollar for avocado and neither did the worker tell me there will be a dollar extra. I'm normally ok with paying the extra dollar as long as I'm told before.

After taking the first bite into the bowl I first noticed the undercooked rice which ruined the whole bowl for me. The fish itself were fresh and decent size chunks but seeing how the rice was undercooked, I couldn't enjoy my meal. The spicy creamy sauce also had no flavor or any heat to it, to which I had to add a squirt of siracha.

I'm willing to take another shot of this place as I didn't know to add all the other sides with the bowl, sich as crab meat, sprouts, etc. But as it stands it's not looking so good."}
{"text":"Favorite spot for quick and healthy lunch!"}
{"text":"OMG this literally has been the best place I've eaten since been here in AZ. IM SOOOOOO upset there isn't one on the East Coast. It is soooo fresh and I love the spicy house sauce. These bowls literally give you like 10 flavors at once. I didn't even eat the whole bowl at the place I rushed home so my boyfriend could try it that's how good it was. And surprisingly he LOVED IT too and he's not a raw fish kind of guy. Him and his friend actually walked in before but was turned away bc of the raw food but now he says he's definitely coming back. It's like a big bowl of fresh sushi but 10x better! A definite must try!!"}
{"text":"Found out about this place a few weeks ago and have come here quite often ever sense. Great food at a very reasonable price. Staff works hard to get people through as the popularity continues to grow. Music is usually on point as well."}
{"text":"I love poke and this place is awesome. I loves their poke. You can have the option to pick a base of white rice, brown rice, salad or half salad and half rice. I got the half and half with half salad and half brown rice. You can pick a large bowl which comes with three scoops of fish or you can get a small bowl which comes with two scoops of fish. I felt like the two scoops was enough meat for me. You also have the option to pick as many toppings you want in your bowl. They do charge extra for different toppings like avocado. 
Loved this place for a quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place!!! You have to go to see what the fuss is all about. Just go, thank me later"}
{"text":"Not too bad, although it's definitely one of those places I'm going to have to visit a couple of times to figure out what my perfect combination is.  The first thing I noticed was how loud the place was, because I couldn't hear the people behind the counter and they couldn't hear me.  Other than having to scream out my order, the process is fairly straightforward.  Pick your size, pick your rice/salad greens, pick your fish, pick your sauce and/or toppings, and you're good to go.  The sauce/toppings phase was a little rushed, though, and I didn't have much chance to peruse before choosing.  I had half white/ half brown rice with a scoop of tuna and a scoop of salmon, topped with masago, seaweed salad, and crunchy onions.  It needed sauce, but the girl behind the counter moved us on before I could decide on which one.  The fish was fresh, though obviously not top shelf.  For $8 to $10, I wasn't expecting top shelf.  I was happy with fresh.  The rice was dry, dry, dry though.  They weren't stingy with the fish, but were with the toppings.  I found this to be a little strange, but maybe you have to tell them to add more.  Next time, I'll have a little more of an idea what to do and what I want.  I can imagine having quite a backup if you have more than one person who doesn't know the procedure.  It would have been helpful if the people behind the counter had asked, you know, like have you been here before? Here's how we do it.  There are signs, but that doesn't quite have the same effect.  If you don't immediately grasp things from a quick perusal of the signs at the entrance, you kind of feel stupid not knowing exactly what to do.  And if there's a line forming behind you, you want to move on (unless of course you're an asshole, in that case you just stand there with your mouth hanging open while people's lunch hours tick by) and get your stuff together before those people behind you starve.  I hate it when some fool holds up the line, so I'm not happy when I'm that fool.  The process could use some tweaking, but it was still a pretty good lunch.  Top tip-- skip the Thai tea.  It's expensive and mediocre, and you can do way better at any boba joint.  The soft drinks aren't much cheaper, but you can at least get a refill.  Our lunch came in at under $25 for two people, so it was a pretty good deal in the end.  I will return."}
{"text":"Really good for a quick meal that is tasty and inexpensive. I love getting the salad with tuna luao and blazing salmon or octopus.  Definitely get dress seaweed salad and crab, lots of picked radish, and basically everything else in the add ins. The staff is always nice about giving samples before choosing too.  Lastly I would definitely say the establishment is clean and well kept, always playing great tunes and spreading good vibes I know this place is supposed to be traditional poke bowls but I would love to see some noodles added in and a couple more sauces with different Asian spins.  Another idea is maybe putting more sides available like a crab salad or other sweet goodies and expanding the drink menu to include some alcoholic beverages"}
{"text":"So, I kept seeing these poki bowl places pop up everywhere and finally decided to try it. I am so happy that I did! I had the regular size bowl with spicy tuna, house spicy sauce, and brown rice. It was delicious. It had such a great variety of flavor that was so clean and fresh. The toppings to choose from are great. Get the toasted seaweed to top it off, it's salty goodness."}
{"text":"I love the concept of this place and definitely feel that you are getting your money's worth even with a regular size.  It's approximately $9 per bowl for good quality seafood and a heap load of toppings customized to your tastebuds and liking.  A typical sushi roll costs around that much too, so this is a great deal.  

The half & half option is really nice (rice+salad), as having the vegetables gives the dish more texture and flavor, and it kind of reminds me of Korean bibimbap.  My one complaint about the half & half option is that it is served in a flimsy, plastic to-go box, and that can take away from the eating experience and aesthetics if picture taking was your plan.  

Lastly, what was a major turnoff during my visit was that the AC was not turned up high enough, and this is really concerning for a place that serves raw fish.  I'm pretty sure the seafood is over ice when it's being served and scooped out, but the seating area was at a temperature where you do start to wonder about it. I hope this was a one time incidence and that others don't have the same experience.

Update: Went again, and their AC was on full blast and working. No more fear!"}
{"text":"This restaurants food is not fresh, aside from their employees no even caring what your order is and showing no interest the food is not fresh and may contain parasites. I ended up with diarrhea for a week and had to visit my doctor for parasites. There is plenty more of these stores that are clean and nice please go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Ive been a super fan of poke for a while and have tried many bowls and different variations and takes on it. This finally is the spot to do poke like it should be done. You can pick every ingredient here from proteins to rice to toppings and sauces its great. Wish there alot more of these style of poke locations throughout AZ. This was the best poke experience(which sounds dirty i know) i will be back and recommend coming and making up your own bowl"}
{"text":"Fresh food and the line goes so fast. But can't imagine eating sashimi more than once a month. Great place, good atmosphere, fast employees, and super clean."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place but found out it's a massive chain with locations all around.  So I was curious when I went in what a chain poke place was like.  Was it the gold standard of poke bowls?  Or the McDonalds of poke bowls?

I would say it was somewhere in between, closer to Mickey Ds though.

Fairly solid fish selections but the cuts were very small and portions were okay.  The topping selection was good, and seemed fresh.  The seaweed salad was tasty (but when is it not?).  The fish was fresh and the sauces they had were okay.  Nothing special but good.

All in all the bowl was okay and it did fill me up so the portions worked out okay.  

I think it might be a good introduction to poke but for veteran poke fan though it will leave some to be desired."}
{"text":"Every time I go there the portions get smaller. Not even a whole tiny scoop when I got a large today..."}
{"text":"A refreshing take on the Chipotle fast-casual style. Nice flavors, good quality seafood, and fast service. I've been several times and always enjoyed the experience. My one criticism is that the employees can't seem to handle any kind of special request. If it's not exactly their routine for how they build the dishes, I usually get a confused stare. But the place is new and probably still working out the kinks. Aside from that, I dig it."}
{"text":"Nothing beats a poke bowl... except an individualized poke bowl!  Love their half and half option with salad and rice for a lighter meal. The regular size with two scoops of fish was a good portion and the house sauce was the perfect flavor without being too salty. You have the option to pile on toppings like crab, seaweed, ginger, sesame  seeds, green onions, avocado, masago... and the list goes on and on. Workers are great and will immediately explain the prices for first timers. I'll be heading back soon!"}
{"text":"Trying to beat my fav Poke place on Los Angeles still had to give it a 5 very good. ..more toppings yummy for my tummy yaaassssss"}
{"text":"I am soooooo tired of your fast food french fries and burger places. I love sushi, seafood and salads.... stumbled upon this place for a quick bite, absolutely live the variety and how theyset it up. The fish was fresh, love the fact that I can have it on top of the salad and its called a Poke Bowl!!!!  The price was a tat expensive, around $18 I paid, but was delicious... why is the fattening food so cheap & when you are trying to stay healthy, you gota pay the price Clean, fast and friendly!!!!"}
{"text":"Good food, this is my second visit, but boy...the service is just awful! The first guy, who started my order, was perfectly pleasant, as was the second girl. But the guy who did the toppings(CT, I think the cashier said) was incredibly rude. I was absolutely surprised by how outright nasty he was to me, and the cashier, a young woman with facial piercings, was dismissive and cold as well. If you don't like your job, get another one. I don't need to be dealing with your attitude problem and immaturity when I'm paying $10+ for a bowl of food. I don't think I'll be coming back to this location."}
{"text":"AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING!!! My boyfriend and I went in during the most busiest time of the night. We got our food fast and with generous portions as well. There was a line out the door but there was plenty of room for everyone to sit, eat, and enjoy their food. The owner even went around to personally clear your finished plates and he thanked everyone for coming in. The pricing is very reasonable for how much food you get and how great the quality is. Overall, I would highly recommend going here."}
{"text":"I love poki and this place fulfilled my obsession! Great price for the amount given! Food is delicious! Staff were friendly n helpful! Will def be back!"}
{"text":"I'm in the commercial fishing business and eat a lot of seafood, including sushi, sashimi, and of course Poki.

I picked up three bowls to go and found the ordering process is a little confusing at first. But a worker there stepped in and helped me walk through the process. 

The Tuna, salmon, spicy tuna, and Octopus is absolutely incredible. It is fresh! Being in the seafood business for 30 years, I can smell, taste or feel fish that is bad. An the fish they are serving is unbelievably good. The next time I will go for the Large three scoop option. I definitely want to try all of what they have to offer. 

This place needs to expand into Northern Scottsdale and maybe up onto Shea area.... But I drove 11 miles, (25 min) to get the food and will do it again, because it is so good."}
{"text":"I've never had Poki! I must say this place blew me away. It's excellent employees really were friendly and made the experience super fun! All of the employees had smiles across their faces  

This place has ice cream macaroons!!!!!!! A real treasure for anyone who's ever had them and is looking to find something extraordinarily tasty. 

Will have to come in at least once a month from now on!"}
{"text":"My friend was eager to show me this place, but I guess they changed everything. Seems like it's a Panda Express for raw seafood. We didn't know what we were doing, or even ordering considering it was my first time and my friend said everything's changed. Though this was pretty obvious, it didn't matter to them. They still rushed us. The salmon was okay though, but we were expecting some hot plates (I guess how their old restaurant was)."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Quick Service Restaurant in the Valley. Fresh, healthy and reasonably priced. I'll be back often."}
{"text":"Location close to Arcadia! Always Clean, very spacious, always friendly & very helpful staff. Fresh, cold fish, never fishy smelling or tasting and they are always expanding their fish selection. They've got a great selection of sauce choices, all are super tasty and their topping choices are very complementary to the fish and rice or salad!!! Recommended: two scoop fish(plentiful), half WHITE RICE(their brown rice is delicious, but doesn't pair well with the fish) and spring mix salad, scallops, tuna luau, spicy creamy, house spicy sauce on the side and ALL of the toppings. Downside: they've increased their prices once already and no longer give refills on their delicious beverages."}
{"text":"When we drove by and I saw the picture of the bowl outside I immediately looked up this restaurant  to get in!  We had the salad bowl with salmon, tuna, and avocado as well as some toppings. The fish was fresh and delicious and my husband thoroughly enjoyed his bowl... Mine, however, I didn't enjoy quite as much because they only had a couple of oils and some gluten free soy sauce I could eat. My husband got all of the yummy sauce... I really wish sushi places would take wheat out of their sauces :(
I do plan on coming back..with sauce in my purse and no avocado ( $1.00 extra)...had zero taste."}
{"text":"The coasts have had similar bowl places and spots like sushirito for a while now and I've looked on in envy... So, ahipoke is a welcome addition to Scottsdale for me. 

As it turns out I was customer number 1 so I met the owner, manager, and their marketing fella. Awesome people. Good luck folks!

Oh yeah, and the food was dub dub dub bomb.com"}
{"text":"For a fast-casual restaurant, this place rocks. If you really like food, you'll love working through the many ingredient choices for your personalized bowl. It's like deconstructing all your favorite sushi rolls into one big, messy, delicious heap. Mmmm ... want more ... now!"}
{"text":"Always fresh and fast food. This is my go to whenever I want something healthy, fast, and cheap. 

I always get the half and half- really good portions. Salmon is my favorite and I literally get all the toppings. Their Thai tea is pretty good too."}
{"text":"\"Think a tasty Sushi served like Subway, but in an over-sized bowl\"

Fresh ingredients 
Friendly staff
Clean/trendy/laid back environment 

I had the yellow-tail and was VERY pleased."}
{"text":"Id eat here again.. It's a good idea when you're feeling healthy but you don't want just a sushi roll you can get a salad sushi Roll bowl!"}
{"text":"Ahipoki bowl was delicious, I'll choose this place over chipotle every time. The fish seemed to be pretty good quality. The only issue with the service was the difficulty communicating with the servers caused by the glass window (but that's not their fault). I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD. Everything was so fresh and had an incredible amount of flavor. I got a large bowl, half white rice and half salad with spicy tuna, regular tuna and salmon and literally ALL the toppings. This place is really close to my work and I came right at lunchtime so the line was pretty long but went by really quick. I'm already craving this place again, I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"What I thought would be a \"checking it out\" visit back in August, turned out to me a weekly habit ever since. I've been to ahi poke bowl two dozen times since then and it never gets old. 
Consistent, super fresh fish, NEVER off, great toppings (though I do miss the jicama), friendly and on point staff. I'm obsessed. I had to go out of town for 3 weeks- poke bowl was my last meal before I left and my first meal when I got back. It's so good."}
{"text":"I've eaten here twice now.  I went opening day and was satisfied- my biggest complaint was the size of the protein scoops. Felt a little skimpy. Went again tonight and DAMN!  Big change!  Dude even grabbed me some more because he thought it was a tad skimpy and it was much better than last time already at that point. I did the 3 scoops and it was packed!  Almost hard to eat because it's so loaded. Fresh, healthy, generous- highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I have been here three times now and really love the food. Basically, it is like a Chipotle where you get to choose what kind of rice bowl you want. You first get to choose the type of fish you want (I recommend the spicy tuna) and then get to add sauce. I personally like the spicy mayo, but there are other great flavors. The next part you get to choose a wide array of items including dried seaweed, seaweed salad, different vegetables, imitation crab, and others. Overall, the service is quick and the food tastes great. It is fairly expensive and if you want real sushi, can get better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Love this place, a great healthy option right next to my work. You have to like sushi if you want your protein otherwise you can just roll out a salad with no topping, but I think you would be missing the point.

A must try if you like sushi (nigiri) and salad. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This is my new chipotle. And it sort of is like chipotle -- you get a lot of bang for your buck and the set-up is just like chipotle. You get to pick what you want every step of the way, and all their ingredients are very fresh. That's another thing-- they have sooo many ingredients to choose from! It's amazing. And very clean.

I've been here ... probably 10 times by now, and I think it just opened this summer. My favorites are the salmon & spicy tuna. The spicy tuna is a different texture than the other fish and complements the salmon. You can add extra meat for a set price, but I've been happy with the two. A scoop of avocado is extra too, but I'm happy without it.

And guess what? They have brown rice!! My usual: half brown rice/half salad, onions, salmon/spicy tuna, house spicy sauce tossed in salad with house creamy on the side, all wet toppings except masago/wasabi (they have imitation crab, edamame, ginger, etc), and all dry toppings. Yum."}
{"text":"I've been waiting for a place like this to come to AZ for years!  Ahipoki Bowl is beyond amazing.  I ordered the regular 2 scoop salad to go and it was Everything!  I can't wait to find an excuse to go back to the area just so I can stop here for lunch again.
Everything was very fresh and tasty.  I got the spicy house dressing, and it was slightly sweeter than I had hoped, but still very delicious!  The combined flavors of the entire meal was something I will crave constantly.  
I asked about those macron ice cream sandwiches they have at their CA location, but sadly they didn't carry those :( But they mentioned they will be working on a desert option soon!! 
Yay, even more reason to come back!
Come onnn, Ahipoki bowl...Please come over to the East Side."}
{"text":"This place is great.  It is always fresh and hits my sushi fix if I want to have a cheaper meal or am in a hurry.  This place can get busy, but with its line setup, it is always quick."}
{"text":"First time here and first time trying a poke bowl 
Place is very clean and staff is very friendly. They have coke products which is a plus, restroom is very clean. The house spicy was very good and the tuna veg fresh. I didn't care for the Thai tea but the mango one was really good."}
{"text":"Love love love! I was so happy to find out this place was opening by my house. Ordered food to go and everything was incredibly fresh and delicious, not to mention there was a good lookin fella behind the cash register. *Haiiiii* My only suggestion would be to offer cold sushi rice as an option since the hot rice warmed up the cold ingredients a little more than my liking."}
{"text":"The fish is so fresh and there is an amazing variety.  There are so many vegetables and sauces and the finished product is exquisite..  We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I have been a huge fan of Hawaiian Poke for years and always anticipate the next time Ill be able to enjoy the fresh tuna.  My wait was over today when Ahipoki Bowl opened in Scottsdale.  It is a build your own bowl type of place, you start by choosing your base of rice(white or brown) or salad or a mix of half and half.  I chose half white rice and half salad. The greens looked fresh and the rice was hot, although I didnt like my fish on top of that hot rice, next time Ill ask for it off the rice.  Then you choose your fish, there are many choices such as tuna, spicy tuna (which is chopped) salmon, albacore, shrimp, and yellowtail for $1 more, the you choose from 4 different sauces (house, house spicy, creamy spicy and a sweet citrus) I went traditional house spicy which had a nice amount of flavor and a touch of spice. Then you add toppings, they allow you to get every one if you like, I got it all! They are brand new today so be patient with them. Everything was fresh and tasty, I look forward to going again soon."}
{"text":"It's hard to imagine sashimi and poke bowls being delicious in a fast casual setting in a south scottsdale strip mall, but ahipoki bowl does it right! Very impressed with their grub, their prices, and their business overall.

 At any reputable sushi house sashimi will be cool, fresh, and delicious, and the quality of the fish here is on that level. It's not cheap, crumby, stringy fish like you'd see at a buffet, this is good fish with great toppings and garnishes. Everything was fresh, alive, and tasty, nothing was flat, soggy, limp, or tasteless. 

 The servings are good and filling for the price, the options are plenty, and there is always something to mix up or try that you didn't last time. I've been here 3 times now since they've opened and it has always delivered. Great concept, great idea, we need one on every street corner, or they can feel free to open one up in my house, I'm okay with that.

 Ahipoki Bowl: Keep it up! You're doing a great job bringing healthy, fresh, and enriching food to the masses, we need more of it. It's high time that we turned away from eating junk food fast, to eating good, healthy food quickly."}
{"text":"I've wanting to try this place and finally went there! There was no price for anything when I walked in but I tried large bowl and picked Tuna, Salmon and yellow tail with house sauce. I love sashimi but never really had Poke bowl before... but this was delicious! I wish they put more rice on the bottom but I am not complaining how much toppings I get! The sauce was pretty plain. The cashier asked me if I needed a soy sauce but I didnt get one and I wish i did because the house sauce was pretty plain. I would definitely go back soon and would love to try the ice cream macaroon next time for sure!"}
{"text":"Decent place $10 for their small salad bowl with small scoops of your preference of fish. Def not top five fave poke"}
{"text":"Regular - half white rice/half salad, tako (octopus), spicy ahi, house creamy (to even out the spiciness of yours not a spicy kinda person lol), Masago, Limu (I think get), edamame, toss and EAT! Sooo Ono! Side Thai Tea lol BOMB dot COM"}
{"text":"Pretty tasty spot.  We were super hungover at my bachelorette party and ended up wandering over here for dinner - lots of flavor options and I like the TV screens as the ordering system very high tech.  Great spot for poke!"}
{"text":"Tasty!
Gotta admit, I was pretty skeptical about poke salad being served like you're at a Chipotle, but I was pleasantly surprised! I had the spicy tuna and salmon, which both tasted fresh. The spicy house sauce seems to be a mix of sesame oil and chili oil (maybe some soy sauce?), and it works really well with the fish! I was surprised that you only get charged extra for certain types of fish (yellowtail, which is fine, it's not my favorite anyway) and avocado (that's pretty normal) and the portion was great for a medium to-go box! How does this place make money?? I'm not sure, but I hope they stick around for longer.

Other things we tried:
-Yellowtail (not bad)
-The spicy cream sauce (has a sweetness to it, kinda like a mayo texture, reminds me of sushi spicy mayo but nottt quite that)"}
{"text":"Hooked !

Great concept . Employees were fast friendly and it was really busy !

Food is great ! I am sure I will come here at least once a week ! 

Come here , you will not be disappointed !"}
{"text":"Great poki for sure! Priced really well and quick service. Definitely recommend going here if you like poki or are looking to try it out."}
{"text":"I'm almost upset this place opened up so close to my home because now I'll want to go here too often!  It's a great value-- the setup is chipotle style.  It just opened and it's already very popular, and for good reason!"}
{"text":"Some bowls are gonna be better than others due to who makes them, but they are always fire no matter what. Five stars all day. Must be tough for the previous lease holder so see such success when they couldn't pull it off with a somewhat similar idea."}
{"text":"THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!!!! I have been to poke bowl places in other states like California, but this one beats them all! So fresh and very generous with the portions. I am just sad I didn't know about it sooner. Restaurant is SUPER cleans, very friendly staff, and while busy there was still good seating. They just got a dessert call Macaron Ice Cream Sandwiches which I can't wait to try. 
Great prices!!!!!
TIP: the best way to eat these bowls is to mix everything up! It is WONDERFUL!!!!!
If you like sushi but want something different it is DEFINITELY one to try!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great quality, one of the best poke bowl places I've tried around Phoenix so far. The yelp reviews brought us in, glad we visited!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. If I want fresh food I'll go here. I feel light after I'm done yet a little hungry still. I think they are a bit stingy on the portions here especially for the price. Get half rice half salad. More food same price."}
{"text":"I've been a regular here since they opened. Many times, lately, the person preparing my bowl won't wear gloves. Tonight, he touched both my lettuce and the avocado by having his thumb inserted inside the container my food goes into. Just sloppy and lazy. Not sure they could pass a health inspection."}
{"text":"My favorite! So fresh and delcious!! I always get s salad base with spicy tuna and house spicy sauce. Not real spicy but super good! I got to the Scottsdale and Chandler locations both weekly!"}
{"text":"Lots of good flavor if you want to eat leaner. 
I am not a fan of the raw fish so i went for the cooked shrimp, half salad & brown rice,  crab salad, edamame, sprouts, and spicy sauce. VERY TASTY 

Pricing:  2 regular bowls for $20 

Fast service and you pick as you go your topping 

Parking at location sucks ! it's a busy shopping area"}
{"text":"Checked this place out for a late lunch around 2pm on a Monday.  They ran out of Yellowtail so that prepared a fresh batch for my bowl and it took a little extra time.  They LOADED my bowl with fresh sushi and delicious dressings and toppings, and they gave it to me for free for waiting a few extra minutes.  This place is right down the street from my new office in Old Town and I will be coming back.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of poke ever since I've had it in Huntington Beach.  I know it's not Hawaii, but I love tuna, especially the ahi kind, and was super stoked when an establishment like this opened in the Phoenix area.  And you know what, this place did not disappoint.

I have already been here a couple times, the first time was when it opened.  Nothing has changed, which is good, which means it's consistent.  My husband and I opted to share the large bowl both times.  The regular bowl is $8.75 and comes with two scoops of fish, while the large comes with 3 scoops for $10.75.  You can get salad, rice (white or brown), or none if you'd like.  The concept is very like Chipotle, only with poke.  I would recommend getting avocado because anything avocado tastes good and you get a heaping scoop for only $1 more.

The scoops you choose are gathered into a large metal bowl and tossed together with your choice of sauce.  We opted for house spicy both times.  They have various toppings to add to your poke.  I love the seaweed, fish eggs, and sesame seeds because they add texture, taste good, and make for a great Instagram picture.  Seating is plenty, ambiance is really modern-esque, and the carry Luzianne iced tea!  The only downside to this joint is that it's not too close to where I live, otherwise I'd be there every week, but I heard they're expanding, so hopefully one will be by me very soon or by you.  

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who loves poke.

For the Scottsdale area, the price is very decent and it's right next to a Starbucks, where you can go get your coffee fix right after.  Overall, clean restaurant, great service, great prices, and tasty food."}
{"text":"I think this was one of the first places in Arizona to open a poke focused restaurant and it was very surprisingly good. The concept is like an assembly line, kinda like Chipotle. Choose a fish, rice, veggies, and add-ons and toppings to make it whole and thats it! I know consuming raw fish, even in AZ can be skeptical but i haven had any sickness from eating it so far."}
{"text":"Super tasty! I fell in love with poke when I was in Hawaii, but haven't really been able to get it here... Now I can and that's great!"}
{"text":"Amazing poke. Makes me miss Hawaii. Great selection. Very fresh. Casual ambiance and super reasonable."}
{"text":"This review is waaaay overdue since I'm here so often!  Love the Chipotle Style order concept at Ahipoki Bowl.  Ironically Chipotle is next door.  All the different toppings that I was able to add on were perfect and the choice of half brown rice half salad with three scoops of poke was a perfect healthy dinner with perfect amount of healthy fats.  

No extra charge for the assortment of toppings!  Ding!  
Not many poke places I've been to that offer jicama and sprouts as toppings that I personally love sans the imitation crab meat cause who wants that when there is better protein options here!  

It was nice meeting some of the local Yelpers as part of the UYE supper club.  So is great for a group of 6+ peeps.  For what you get for under $10 bucks it deserves 4 stars."}
{"text":"This place is Chipotle meets sushi and starts a beautiful relationship. Loved the options, quality of fish and friendliness of the staff.  It's almost always packed but the crew is extremely efficient in moving the customers through with a smile. Go check it out!"}
{"text":"I am hooked to this place! So many choices and toppings you can choose from so you never get bored. It's healthy and doesn't make me feel bad after. What's more awesome is that they serve ice cream macarons now! Please come to Gilbert Ahi poki!"}
{"text":"Another \"Chipotle style\" concept that really works. I love sushi and poke, and this is a hybrid of the two. Ahipoki Bowl offers a healthy and filling meal at a reasonable price. I really like being able to customize my bowl by adding lots of good stuff like avocado, edamame, sprouts and more. I've had the tuna, salmon and yellowtail and all have been delicious and fresh tasting. They give you the option of mixed greens, brown or white rice. I've tried both rices and they were perfectly cooked. They also offer matcha green iced tea which was quite good too. This place is great for a casual, fast, healthy and reasonably priced meal."}
{"text":"I wish all healthy food were this good tasting and this reasonably priced! I ordered the big bowl with a scoop each of ahi tuna, salmon, and tuna luau; to go with the proteins I chose the half & half -- half green salad, half rice (brown rice for me), and a scoop of creamy avocado as an extra side. I also chose the house spicy sauce and for toppings I had sprouts, masago (capelin roe), sliced red onions, crispy fried onions, and a small side of wasabi. What a dynamite combination - so delicious and so fresh! Service was fast because they build your order as you choose from the array of ingredients in front of you - choose your bowl size, then your proteins, then the sauce, sides and toppings. It's a bit of a drive for me to come here but it's so very worth it."}
{"text":"I crave this place all the time. Their seafood is fresh and they have great dressings. Think of this place like a chipotle but for poki bowls. You get to put together a bowl that you like so its really up to you. If you like sushi then give this place a roll of the dice and half the cost of average sushi. I dont think kids would like it all that much but def. good for adults. They also have TV that stream sports so not a bad place to catch part of a game."}
{"text":"I'm fairly new to the poke bowl scene, but I think this place should definitely be on any poke bowl fan's list. I'm a fan of the ordering style, where you can mix and match what you want -- I wasn't familiar with a lot of the toppings they had, but poke is the place to be adventurous! And the friendly staff were happy to answer any questions. I had the octopus and spicy tuna on white rice with kimchi dressing and whatever toppings I thought might work well -- the result came out fantastic, although I am a pretty biased fan of kimchi and octopus both! The food was all fresh and made for a very pretty looking bowl, if you're the type to instagram your food. The regular bowl was filling enough, though I do think the serving sizes could be just slightly larger.

Also, as other reviewers have mentioned, I do wish the prices were more plainly reflected as they aren't posted online or even in the actual location."}
{"text":"5 stars easily! Drop everything and come here for lunch or dinner. If you like fresh seafood and ingredients this place is perfect. It's like a chipotle for poke bowls. If you've never tried a poke bowl this is the place to do it"}
{"text":"I love this place. I love love love this place. 

Fresh ingredients. Friendly employees. Fast service. The owner loves Yelpers and patrons who frequent his business. 
They are super generous with their portions, even on items other businesses may be stingy with (ahem avocado). It's not even worth it to explain my order or make recommendations because I'm certain whatever you order will be yummy. Prices are similar to chipotle, but value is way better. 
Give it a try - Surely will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"Wow, what a GREAT concept! This place is so cool! Think chipotle meets deconstructed sushi roll. 

This place gets super busy at lunchtime but they manage to get everyone through the line quickly and there is plenty of seating! 

First, you choose whether you want rice or lettuce, or both! Next you choose your seafood. You can choose 2 or 3 different types depending on the size bowl that you choose. They have a variety of tuna, scallops, crab, shrimp, salmon, etc. Next, you add the toppings and sauce! They have edamame, avocado, bean sprouts, seaweed, cucumber, jicama, onions, wasabi, imitation crab, fish eggs, and more. We will for sure be back!! 

As expected, it is a little on the pricier side but you're getting fresh seafood! For a regular bowl {2 scoops of seafood} it was around $10 including tax."}
{"text":"My first time here and I would come back. I ordered to go, two scoops (salmon and tuna) with half and half (brown rice and salad) with all the toppings. You definitely get more rice and salad if you order to go. That's a HUGE portion. The regular, which is two scoops, is $8.95 and I added avocado for an extra dollar. I got the house spicy sauce which was delicious. 

There were a couple aspects of the place that made the overall experience four stars instead of 5. First, the scoops contain four or five 1-1.5\" cubes of fish. TINY. So I would recommend getting the large for an extra two dollars. I think all the fillers stay the same portion. I can't imagine my to-go box being any more full. Second, you order chipotle or subway style, as you go down the row. It is nearly impossible to hear one another. I don't know if it's the acoustics but I literally read one woman's lips because after three tries I still couldn't hear her. And the next lady in charge of my sauce options gave me the wrong sauce, likely because she also couldn't hear me. (Still delicious). 

As long as you're not expecting a poke bowl a la Hawaii (i.e. All fish) and can shout, and MAYBE stand getting the wrong things in your bowl, this place is fantastic. New fresh healthy food option in the area, definitely try it out!"}
{"text":"Visited this placed for lunch on a busy Saturday. The food and service was good. Just like chipotle, but with sashimi. The price for the food was well priced. The missing star was for the ease of communication with the staff making the order. There's a really big glass between you and the food, which is understandable but to the point where the staff can hardly hear you. So be prepare to yell when you order. Looking forward to another visit. If only there is a card where you can mark off what you want and just give it to the staff and they will make your order."}
{"text":"Staff behavior a total turn off. I feel like I'm in an overpriced version of Subway. Food sits out in big metal trays and is scooped into bowls..."}
{"text":"I LOVED this place so much and would lean towards giving this a 5 if I didn't think it was slightly overpriced.  I LOVE poke anything and there's a lack of this in Phoenix/maricopa county.  It was delicious and I love that you can get half rice half salad as an option.  The other thing I wasn't too thrilled with--there's a slight difference between what the online menu indicates is an option versus what I was offered at the store:  The online menu just says you can pick your side (onion, crab meat, avocado) and this was not the same as in-store. I believe avocado was a charged option and not included. Overall, I would definitely come back but I couldn't justify doing this weekly."}
{"text":"Obsessed with this place. The Thai iced tea is delicious and try the bowl with a salad! Different but really good and less heavy than the rice version. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":":Love this restaurant!  I've only gone twice, near their grand opening, and must say that the fish is so fresh!  AND I LOVE their House Sauce.  I typically enjoy salads, but the sauce mixed in with the salad makes me want to have salad every day for every meal.  I do wish that their bowls were a bit bigger.  Not necessarily for main food, but for all the toppings.  Once you add the toppings the bowl is already overflowing.  There is no room for you to mix in your ingredients and/or dive in for the rice or salad that gets buried in the bottom.
The staff is very friendly, and they offer you a 50% off card for your next order when you join their email club.
Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"My new favorite lunch spot!  This place is like the Chipotle for sushi lovers!  First you choose rice, salad or a mix of both.  Then you pile on the protein... squid, octopus, salmon, tuna...whatever you want! Followed by seaweed salad and toppings of your choosing...This place is like heaven and it's super healthy!  My taste buds are tingling right now just thinking about it.  I'll probably go back tomorrow.  You can't really beat this quality of a lunch for around $8!    It's usually pretty packed, so go at an off hour, unless you want to wait awhile or stand up to eat.  The line moves by pretty quick though.  The only thing that could make this place better... is if they offered sake!"}
{"text":"First time having a poke bowl but no stranger to raw fish so I had some expectations.  Given the number of reviews in the short time it's been opened this was on the short list of new fast casual dining options to try out.  Did not disappoint with the fresh fish selection and surprised with the spicy sauce which was excellent and the topping selection includes \"everything\" which was my choice, I was not familiar several of them but I'm open to trying new food items, created a unique flavor and texture experience that is worth repeating."}
{"text":"Simple, fresh and just delicious. I really dreamed of the day i would go back to Carlsbad to get a fresh tuna poki bowl from a mom and pop shop. But I'm glad that i will now be able to just drive 30 minutes to get one (yes it is really worth the drive). The concept i awesome: a chipotle style restaurant where you pick what you want. The food is fresh. 

Since it was my first time i opted for the 3 scoops +1 extra scoop. My choices: tuna, salmon, spicy tuna and octopus. I love octopus but I wouldn't recommend it, it was extremely chewy. The other selections in the other hand were just so good, as if you were eating sashimi and sushi restaurant style spicy tuna. Im trying to limit my carbs so i asked for very little rice and the rest salad. Let me tell you, theres no need for rice, the salad makes you feel less guilty and you never miss the rice. I went for the spicy house sauce. And for toppings it was everything except for the crab mix(i hate Mayo). I got a green tea but would absolutely  skip it,very watered down.

Overall it was amazingly good. I cant wait until the next time i come back. I just hope they open one soon in the west valley."}
{"text":"Extremely small scoops for how much they charge. It's pretty much a rip off. Go to a different ahi poke place on Shea Blvd. Their portions are much better."}
{"text":"I went for the first time today and didn't really know what to order. I changed my mind after the server had dished up a small serving of rice, and decided to get the large. Then I decided to get the half and half with greens, and the server made a sarcastic remark about me changing my mind and kind of sneered at me like it was a big inconvenience for him.
The food was great...I had spicy tuna, Salmon and shrimp. Service not so great."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and both times were excellent. I agree with previous comments about this being a Chipotle style setup in terms of ordering your food. Both times the staff was smiling, nice, professional, and had a good sense of urgency to complete your order."}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow!!! I've seen poke on the food channel, and thought it looked good, but wondered if it was squishy and wasn't sure if I'd ever try it. 

This place is DELICIOUS!!!! The fish seems fresher than sushi grade, and firm. The flavors were so good. I especially liked the marinated poke. It's keto friendly, and it's so nice to have a place to eat clean around here."}
{"text":"Wow!  I had the spicy poke tuna and poke tuna with pineapple (not on the menu).  It was fresh, cold, and delicious!!  I had the house sauce, and a few of the fresh toppings, all were very tasty.  I had rice, my husband had salad and both were great.  GINGER was the BEST, freshest ginger I have ever had!!  Staff was also very friendly, and service was very quick, it was also very clean.  I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE Ahipoke! We have been multiple times since it opened in Scottsdale. The fish is always very fresh, along with the other toppings. They have a great selection of toppings. Everyone is very friendly and I believe it is very fair priced for the amount of food you get. We love Ahipoke!"}
{"text":"Quick, easy, cheap and really surprisingly good quality fish for a fast take out place. The bowls are really good. You can do combinations of rice and salad and multiple toppings of the protein. Overall a good quick spot for lunch on the go!"}
{"text":"I'd give this place a 5 if they hadn't shooed me away before closing during a recent visit. I get that \"that guy\" that orders 15 minutes before closing is annoying but sometimes that's just how life goes. Was asked if I could finish up my meal and one of the employees said \"Well we do close at 9\" with one of those tones you don't care to ever hear. So that definitely put a damper on my desire to visit again but it's quickly been forgotten. 
The food always tastes fresh, I never have felt \"sick to my stomach\" full when leaving but rather content and happy I did.
I also finally went to visit a couple other poke places in town (Ocean Poke and Poki Bar Central). Those places seem to charge for everything compared to Ahipoki (obviously I understand the typical surcharge for advocado and certain fish types). I do hope, although not a vegetarian and not a typical poke type, tofu to the mix as I think it would be a great option and I enjoy the texture. The fact that they are constantly expanding attests to success. 

p.s. Not sure why or how they go to selling macarons though. Just seems out of place. Maybe ice cream or fried ice cream of some type would be nicer."}
{"text":"I stumbled across this just driving around. Legit one of the best meals I ever had!  Large Half and Half with brown rice, spicy tuna, regular tuna, and salmon. Add in cucumbers, edamame, and a small portion of wasabi with house sauce!  So good"}
{"text":"I love this place!  While they do get busy, they have the assembly line down.  I haven't had anything I didn't like!  I'm not a poki expert but I love sushi and this place is great."}
{"text":"Love this place! It tastes fresh and it's just like sushi just in a bowl. Really enjoyed their tuna mix, spicy creamy sauce, and their spicy sauce"}
{"text":"I haven't eaten it yet but the experience right off the bat wasn't good. I ask for the regular to go with two scoops of salmon. First scoop put in the bowl. Then I watch the guy literally put the scoop in the salmon put it over my bowl and two pieces fall out in to my bowl. Literally the rest was still in the scoop and he just puts the scoop back still full. What? ??? I ask of this is normal and he says yes. He then proceeds to help the guy next to me who orders the same thing but this guy next to me manages to actually get two scoops. Not happy that I paid the same as the person next to me and I have half the fish. Pay attention to what you are doing and what is going on. I don't know if I will be back."}
{"text":"Good food high cost.  The worst customer service every single time I've been here.  It's so loud you can't hear the workers over the glass.  They yell and are rude.  They act like it's so hard to put food in a bowl and mix.  Every worker has bad attitude.  It's great healthy food but the service makes u angry and not want to come back.  I asked for a water cup she said no u can't have one they're very costly.  I said am I allowed a fork or is it cost to much.  I paid $13 bucks for green leaf and ahi and can't have a .20 cent water cup wow.  It's terrible I've been here 10 times and every visit the workers are worse and worse."}
{"text":"This place was everything that I was hoping for. The spicy tuna was good and I loved the sauces they offer! The service was friendly and prompt, when they were out of spicy tuna they got it ready as soon as I was about to say something. I will be back here for sure :)"}
{"text":"First time having a poki bowl and it was absolutely delicious. The staff was friendly and helpful and the facility was inviting and clean. The ingredients were fresh and very tasty. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is my go to for fast, healthyish food. Service is always great and they are always willing to customize your order. I definitely recommend asking them to mix all of the contents into one big bowl with the sauce you choose!"}
{"text":"I love this concept! This is a great healthy option if you are craving fresh fish. Each bowl is built by you and you can add any option you like. The fish is fresh and you have multiple options including tuna, spicy tuna, salmon, yellowtail etc. My bowl included, brown rice, avocado, tuna, salmon, crispy onions and scallions. I combined both spicy sauces for a delicious added flavor. Check out this restaurant ASAP!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place a lot. It was my first time being in a restaurant that served up fast and fresh Ahi Poke bowls much like a chipotle. The wasabi is intense not bland. The staff that particular day wasnt so amazing.... but the food was really good. The prices were really good too. $10 for a share-ably sizable portion with 3 protein options."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of this place anytime I'm in Scottsdale. Their house sauce is delicious and the food is always fresh. Please open in Tucson!!!"}
{"text":"If you're trying to make stuff fit your macros for the day you have two awesome options set right next to each other with Chipotle adjacent.  A friend of mine had tried Ahipoki Bowl with the octopus...how about never, will I ever eat Octopus.  Wanted something light after a long drive back from LA and decided to go here.

Ahipoki Bowl is just pure fast casual and quite affordable.  So, support your gains and support your wallet!  I got the Ahi and Scallops over white rice with avocado.  The only thing I added on top was cucumbers but you have edamame, sea weed and others.

I threw some sriracha on top and called it good.  The resto is very clean and had two TVs up so you could watch the game."}
{"text":"Love the concept of this place! It was easy in and out and crazy healthy. Not to mention I love some ahi. You have to try it out if you like stuff that is quick, easy and healthy!"}
{"text":"Yummy!!!!!!!!!!! 

After a busy travel week all we wanted was something fresh, quick and healthy. 

I wasn't totally sure about the approach at first. I'm classic when it comes to eating sushi and I wasn't totally sure about the chipotle style counter approach with raw fish involved. 

It was so good!!!  You get two options of sizes for your bowl. I got regular which is two scoops of fish. The fish was fresh. 

Really awesome stop if you need a quick healthy bite."}
{"text":"I love this place and I really wish there was one on my side of town so I don't have to drive across town to get my fix. Fresh, healthy and delicious every time."}
{"text":"Awesome quality food, good service and lovely atmosphere. If you love sushi, you're going to love Poke so go in and give it a try. Love the spicy house sauce, soba noodles and pretty much everything on the Poke Bar. The fish is AMAZING, great local ingredients.

Super clean, awesome vibe and fresh food!"}
{"text":"Good healthy keto friendly option. Perfect for a quick bite. Good portion options. Friendly staff . Clean. Will visit again."}
{"text":"Where I live there aren't any poke places, so when I had the chance to go to a new city where there was an opportunity to try poke I jumped at the chance. I was a bit limited at options due wanting something close within proximity to my hotel, so I decided to try Ahipoki after reading about them on Yelp.

I will say that I have nothing really to compare anything too except for my own expectations I created for myself with the experience. What I wasn't really expecting is for my experience to be like that of Chipotle but Poke style. What I mean by that, is that even though Chipotle wouldn't be considered a fast food joint by most it still felt very commercial. I was hoping for more of a personal style shining through... again just my own expectation I created for myself.

It was super easy to walk through the process of creating my first poke creation. I went with a greens base as I am just not the biggest fan of rice. I went a bit wild with the proteins: octopus, scallops, and salmon. I threw on tons of toppings... and when I say tons, I would say I put about 8 toppings on with a lot more options of toppings that I left off. Needless to say, they have a lot of topping options. 

I felt like my poke green bowl was good. It didn't blow me away, but it definitely made me curious to try as many other poke places as possible."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with Ahipoki Bowl!!!!! This is my new favorite place, I want to go back everyday. The bowls are extremely fresh and healthy. If you love raw fish and sushi, you will fall in love with this place. It is worth the drive but I wish they would open more locations."}
{"text":"I love Ahipoki Bowl. Being a landlocked state, seafood is usually not the best and hard to find. But, this place is as close as you can get to fresh, quality seafood. A neighborhood jewel. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Compared to other poke bowls that I have had, Ahipoki Bowl is close to the top. The location is open and spacious with a Chipotle-style ordering. FYI Chipotle is around the corner if you are feeling Mexican instead. 

I ordered a large (3 scoops of fish) with a half and half mix of brown rice and organic salad. For fishes I choose salmon, tuna, and yellowtail with all the sides - avocado, crab meat, onion and all the toppings. I went with the house sauce. I appreciated that avocado did not cost extra and the portion size is huge. The sauces are adequate but most workers overwhelm the bowl with too many pumps. This is my to-go poke place in Scottsdale.

What I recommend:
-- come in before or after the lunch rush 12:00 pm - 1:30 pm"}
{"text":"Nom nom nom. I have this place. You can create your own concoction. Get it with half rice, half lettuce in a to-go box. Makes it much easier to mix. If you have it in there bowls its gets all over the place when you try to stir it all. Little pricey for lunch, but its a great treat and you don't feel bad eating it."}
{"text":"I love this place! Overall great quality and service for a moderate price. The tuna is amazing, fresh and flavorful and they give you huge servings so you are getting your money's worth. 

The owner is awesome. He always hangs out and asks if this is your first time and if there is anything he can do to make your experience more enjoyable. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I have been dying to try this place out and I love it!!! 

Poke bowls are wonderful because you can customize it to include everything you love. They give you options of using rice, greens or a mix of both for your base. The fish was all fresh and the selection of ingredients was pretty large considering. 

The prices were reasonable and makes it affordable compared to other places that offer sushi concoctions. My only gripe about this place is not having a menu to follow with you as you go through the assembly line. I luckily found one that someone forgot but it makes it hard to remember all the things you could add. 

Definitely go try this place, its refreshing, healthy, and delicious!!"}
{"text":"During my weeklong training in Scottsdale, I always seemed to pass by this little joint. I love sushi and poki, so it was a must-try for me.

Basically, it's a chipotle version of sushi bowls. You pick your rice, your sashimi (or poki), sauce, and toppings. If you're in Scottsdale and like sushi, you should really give this place a try!!! I gotta see if they have a location in Tucson because could totally see myself eating here more than chipotle."}
{"text":"This place was one of the first mainstream poke places in the valley.  I always get the large with an extra scoop, half rice and half salad.  So, 2 scoops of tuna and 2 scoops of salmon.  I like their house sauce, too.  Poke is usually pricey, but you get pretty large portions.  

Afterwards, other poke places sprouted up around the valley like wildfire.  I've been to quite a few of them using Ahipoki Bowl as the standard.  So far, no other poke place has compared in portion size, quality and taste."}
{"text":"I've been there two times, both time, fast, fresh, good price too. Is a nice place, the only think because I don't give it 5 st. is because I am not good eating in a box, but still ok."}
{"text":"Love it!

They give you FAT ASS portions. I've eaten at a lot of poke places and this is by far the most for your money! While the portions are HUGE, their medium bowls are 2 scoops and the large is 3, which is less than other places (M-3, L-4). But still, I didn't finish my food!

The guy that greeted me was extremely friendly and explained how they work here (same as other places). They have great options and lots of different sizes.

The restaurant is very spacious and there was plenty of seating. Their furniture is very up-to-date and clean. I would recommend this place to everyone!

Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"Great concept and the fish and toppings were pretty good. I'm happy we finally get a poke place since I usually have to go to So Cal to get some. However I have to knock this place down because of the price. The price is already pretty high for a large at $11 with 3 very tiny scoops of fish and about 75% rice. Add $1 for avocado and .75 cents for crab and you are easily at $13 before a drink. Most poke places I have been to would never charge extra for those 2 items plus the base price of the bowl itself would not be over $8. Maybe if another competitor opens the place might lower the price. Aside from that this is a good (and only) option for poke in Phoenix. Btw to the owners get rid of that electronic dance music blaring as it gets old fast."}
{"text":"Not too bad if you like previously frozen tuna chunks and frozen tuna scapings (spicy tuna) you can tell by how watery the tuna was and the color. $9 for a small bowl and the price can escalate quickly if you add specialty items. I had the tuna chunks and salmon, tuna was kinda stringy, salmon was fine. The wife had the spicy tuna which was bland, the scallops were schwag, watery and bland. Would I go there again, probably not. Concept was good but they should use a higher grade of tuna if the main theme is poke."}
{"text":"Jumped on the poki trend.  Tried the poki bowl here and it was good.  The poki tasted fresh. The regular size bowl was enough for lunch, dinner might need the large bowl to fill me up.  

The portions of poki seems a little small, 2 scoops but i read that can vary.  The avocado was $1 extra.  Even through the poki taste fresh there was a raw fish smell walking in?  I was always under the impression that raw fish doesn't smell fresh?? I could be wrong tho.  

Not sure i would go here again until i tried some of these other poki places first."}
{"text":"Decent by Arizona standards for poke, but for the price I was expecting higher-quality food. I originally was going to get scallops in my bowl, but after seeing how it looked I decided against it."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. I literally go every week. The food is worth the price and always fresh. I'm a creature of habit and always get the same exact thing, so I can really only vouch for the ahi tuna, but it's amazing and everything else looks amazing. I've been to other ahi tuna places around Phoenix and It's by far the best. My only recommendation is to be careful if you get avocado and wasabi because they can look very similar and a huge bite of wasabi is very awakening to the sinuses. That's just personal experience.."}
{"text":"Acceptable place for a quick fish fix! Obviously, this isn't super fresh fish, but it's definitely decent by Arizona standards. 

Quick and fast Chipotle-like service, but the line gets SUPER DUPER LONG during weekday lunch hours. My go-to spot for a quick lunch out with co-workers or dinner takeout on the way to the ASU Tempe campus for night classes.

Their topping selection is great too--they have Masago which is my favorite!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since opening week, and I must say the quality is slowly going down. The fish isn't as fresh, and they are starting to up charge for everything. Today I came in an ordered my usual large half rice half salad bowl. The woman who was scooping the fish might have been the most stingy every. To pay $13.50 for a bowl is crazy (extra $1 for each scoop of yellowtail) when you receive 7 pieces of yellow tail (two scoops) and 5 pieces of tuna luaua (one scoop). The pieces are also small bite sized pieces. Basically I paid more than $1 per small piece of fish. I hope this place gets back to the way it operated when it first opened. Considering there are other poke options in the valley now, they need to start working on getting back to their original quality."}
{"text":"It's like Chipotle but with sushi ingredients! Why hasn't this been done sooner?! 

You design your own bowl depending on what type of base you wanted such as white or brown rice etc. Then you get to choose the protein and sauce that it gets tossed in, and lastly you get to choose the toppings such as edamame or seaweed salad. 

I went with a half rice, half mixed greens with salmon and tuna on their house sauce. The fish and sauce were good although it was a touch too sweet for my liking. The toppings in my opinion are what puts it over the top, the crispy onions with some seaweed and green onion give it a really nice crunchy aspect that mixes it up from the soft fish and rice. 

Great place and concept that provides good food, quick!"}
{"text":"The taste is okay, but it's a bit pricy. Maybe because the location nearby scottsdale?"}
{"text":"Great place I usually get salmon and tuna with the house spicy sauce. The staff is great and their portions of protein is fair."}
{"text":"My beautiful wife and I came here for a late lunch on Thursday. Wow. What a great place. It was after the lunch rush so it was a fast run thru the ordering process. Similar to chipotle's ordering process. Both my wife and I had amazing bowls. Definitely go for the larger size 3 scoops of protein.

Everything was fresh and so delicious. This place is going to be huge! Get here while most people don't know about it."}
{"text":"WHAT DELICIOUS AND FRESH WAY TO EAT SUSHI AND SALAD.   I am very picky about my fish and I eat at AhiPoki almost every day of the week.  The prices are reasonable and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"Sooooooooo good. Fast and seemingly fresh. Not bad for 11 bucks. Not sure what else there is to say other than that."}
{"text":"The poke craze has arrived in Arizona, and in full force no doubt. Having heard about the recent grand opening in Scottsdsle, I knew I just had to come try it, and I was not disappointed. 

This place is chipotle style, where you design your own poke bowls. You start off with a base consisting of either white or brown rice or organic salad, with the option of a half and half. Then you choose your entree, which ranges from raw tuna, salmon, yellowtail, spicy tuna, and a few others. Next you pick your sauce and toppings, which includes things like avocado, wasabi, seaweed, etc.

I had their half and half brown rice and salad with tuna and salmon slathered with their house spicy sauce and all toppings. The portions here were very generous for the price range. I thought the salmon and tuna were fresh and well prepared and cut. The avocado, crab meat, and seawood were especially delicious. The servers were friendly and efficient despite the growing line during lunch and a malfunctioning cash register on a Sunday at noon. Would definitely come back to have another poke bowl here!"}
{"text":"A favorite of ours. Clean, awesome food. Inexpensive, quick. Awesome tasting.  Nothing bad about it. We go 1-2 times a week"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places, hands-down. Great concept; quick and easy. Build your own poke bowls. Always tastes great and the service is friendly."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the food is always great.  While the bowl seems small at first, it's definitely filling and the ingredients always seem fresh.  I personally think you get a lot for your money.  Definitely try this place out!"}
{"text":"I like the poke bowl. It tastes great. But I never got a coupon code after signing up with my email."}
{"text":"Love this place. When I want something a little different this is my go to. I like the flavored options. The tuna Luau and the shrimp combo is amazing. If you like the spicy sauces mix them together so yummy. Not excited about the prices going up but still fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"When this opened up it became our instant go-to restaurant! Only holding back a star because it's (so far) the only location, and it's a bit of a drive for us, but worth it. 
Love love love the selection and fresh ingredients! If I were to be nitpicky, I'd say it's a tad moderate on the prices for what is essentially a quick (not fast) food place. But, given the choice of fresh fish, that's probably worth the extra coin."}
{"text":"First time here and first time trying poke. Must say it's been a great first experience. Everything is really good. Got half brown rice half salad, spicy tuna and salmon and since I wasn't sure what else was good I let the guy that helped me suggest the rest. 
Also you have to try the juice! Half green tea half tropical is so bomb and refreshing"}
{"text":"This place should be called Itty-Bitty Poke. The portion size is smaller than any other Poke restaurant in town. If you look at the bowls, and even serving utensils, you will notice that they are Itty-bitty.  But small utensils aren't enough to ensure an Itty-bitty serving size (even on a large sized order)... No, they will take the extra step of flicking and dumping ingredients back into their receptacles whilst serving, to ensure that you get the minimum possible. For the price, I'll go elsewhere."}
{"text":"My new favorite place, I eat here once or twice a week. The portions are huge, I reccomend half rice, half salad!!"}
{"text":"I come here nearly every week, always to go, but I'm sorry to say, the last few times I've been there, they have screwed up my order every time. Either extra wasabi when I said NO wasabi,  trying to put sprouts on  when I said \"NO SPROUTS!\" and then had to yell it again to stop them, and today, NOT putting the avocado on when I said I WANTED avocado. I must have turned my attention away for a split second. You MUST carefully watch them assemble your salad or they will screw it up. I assume it's due to the turnover - I think there are different people every time I go in."}
{"text":"New fav! It's delicious, fresh, simple, healthy, and reasonably priced.  Kinda like Chipotle (but without the food poisoning) but for sushi-rolls that are deconstructed and turned into bowls. For about $11 or so you can get their large bowl with 3 different types of protein (I got spicy tuna, scallops, and shrimp), all kinds of toppings (seaweed salad, cucumbers, ginger, sesame seeds, just to name a few) and rice (or rice with a salad, which is what I got) with a delicious sauce. So happy that we have one in South Scottsdale -- will definitely be my go to for a quick dinner!  (Another plus - the staff is super friendly!)"}
{"text":"This place has the most consistent quality poke in ARIZONA, hands down! Always good, always fresh, great sauces. I always opt for the octopus in my bowl just because I can't find it anywhere else  yum!"}
{"text":"LOVE!
I got the regular with salad, salmon and just about every topping with the spicy sauce.  Filling and healthy!"}
{"text":"Good concept, I'll go back but I think it's a overpriced."}
{"text":"My first poke bowl was this place.  I like mainstream sushi but didn't really think I would be able to do straight raw fish so these guys let me sample their top sellers and right away I was surprised that I could eat it and  willing to get a bowl and try it out with all of the other ingredients. They really hooked me up with my first bowl and loaded it up. The rice was sticky which I liked and getting fresh avocado and lots of sesame seeds on my bowl made it that much better.  Their house dressing is also very good!  I love this place and would definitely recommend buuuuut...

every visit after my very first visit has not been as enjoyable because my first bowl was loaded and delicious so that was my standard for this place and I have been getting less and less every time and getting a big bowl with avocado (x2 sometimes) plus yellow tail can start to get pricey and so getting less and less every time makes me go less often now.  

Also, if you sign up with your email you are suppose to get a coupon code which I never received nor has any of my friends and I have tried 2 of my other emails and I never seem to get the coupon they keep promising.

I hope my portions will start to be as and loaded as my first visit and I hope management takes the time to read these reviews and address issues like the email promo deals so I can continue to rated this place 5 stars.  Looking forward to what the future can hold Ahipoki bowl don't let us down!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch. I have never been here before. The staff was super friendly and helpful. I will be coming back also bringing friends. Light refreshing and yummy!"}
{"text":"Amazing service and amazing environment. It was very efficient. The fish was always so fresh !! Most definitely recommend it to everyone who likes fish."}
{"text":"This is the cure for satiating hunger during our hot Phoenix summers.  Fills you but without the guilt.  Wouldn't mind seeing a few more of these pop up in the Valley."}
{"text":"Update- I'm giving Ahipoke another star. I decided to give Ahipoke another chance and was pleasantly surprised. Maybe they changed out the staff but the lad who made my bowl was very attentive and careful and did not skimp out on the ingredients. The flavors really meshed well together. I was more adventurous this time, getting all the toppings minus the wasabi and crunchy onions and was very pleased. It was delicious! I did notice I had to pay extra for the avocado. I'm pretty sure it came with the bowl last time without a fee but it could just be that my less than interested server just didn't bother to mention it to me. Either way, extra or not, you can't have poke without avocado. Nope. 

I've been obsessed with poke lately (I had poke three times this weekend). Unfortunately, ahipoki failed to deliver for me. First, the workers all seem like they don't enjoy their jobs and it is so apparent, it's impossible to ignore. Second, it sort of felt like a chain restaurant or like my food was going through a conveyor belt. What I love most about poke is how aesthetically pleasing it always is and how carefully my server places and displays my food. Here, they just sort of threw things into the bowl. Lastly, the spicy house sauce just didn't do it for me. It wasn't spicy; it was just overly salty- I couldn't taste what it was supposed to taste like other than soy sauce. 

One thing i did appreciate about ahipoki is that they include avocado into your choices. You only pay extra for a second scoop. This is the first place that has done that. To be fair, the price falls right around the same ballpark as what I paid for in other poke restaurants."}
{"text":"Finally got to try this place. Very fresh and very tasty! The house spicy sauce was a bit too spicy for me. It'd be helpful to know the ingredients of the sauces as to not encounter any allergies."}
{"text":"I've been to most of the Poke places around Phoenix and have been to this Ahipoke Bowl location a few times. Comparatively, this place is 3 stars for me.

The selection of ingredients is great : bases include brown rice, white rice, greens, etc., and the proteins are pretty standard. For the price ($9.50 for a regular bowl) the serving size is not great. Along with this, several items that are included at no upcharge at most other places (avacado, extra crab meat, masago) cost extra here - and the times I've been here they don't mention the charge when they offer you these toppings, specifically avacado. 
There is typically a long line during dinner hours which I am guessing is because there is an LA Fitness and other gyms really close (there are always people in workout clothes here).

The workers are also mostly nice but not overly friendly. 

Overall, I think the value is a bit lacking here but I would consider returning if I'm in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way to go here."}
{"text":"Delicious and good healthy food. I took the 3 scoop with brown rice and garden salad. Added salmon, spicy tuna and ahi tuna with house spicy and citrus dressing. 
The food tasted really good,looked fresh and I'm extremely satisfied with the overall experience. They have friendly staff and clean restaurant. I will recommend this place to others and for sure I will be back for trying out more food."}
{"text":"This place is really good! It's a chipotle style restuarant.
Ingredients were super fresh and delicious. If you're unfamiliar with poke bowls, it's similar to unwrapped sushi :)
I went on opening night and the place was packed! They did run out of brown rice by the time I got to order but I wasn't surprised after seeing how busy the place was.

P.S. avocado is $1 extra"}
{"text":"SUCH BULLSH*T!!! As soon as everyone ordered all of their food the system happened to crash and we were forced to pay with cash. Lucky me that my best friend had enough cash on her to pay for our food but the guy in front of us didn't have cash and eventually left after a super awkward conversation with the register girl (who was extremely rude and didn't apologize whatsoever for the system crashing). Love the food but the people working here are far from polite and look like they hate every part of their job! So disappointed."}
{"text":"Food is phenomenal! Great spot for a healthy lunch. My only complaint is that the glass is too tall in the line and you have to scream in order for the person making your bowl to hear you. I said 'NO MASAGO...NOT EXTRA' -____-"}
{"text":"Fast and delicious.  The owner seemed genuinely interested in our experience.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Good food fast. 

This visit is our first. I order a rice bowl with 1 scoop of spicy tuna & 1 scoop of regular tuna; added to it are seaweed salad, & 1 scoop of imitation crab. The ingredients of my poke bowl seem fresh & taste good. 

My wife selects a garden salad with tuna, which she likes since it too tastes good & fresh. 

The service at this store is standard fast food restaurant. All dishes are served in disposal plastic bowls or boxes. 

Given a choice, I rather choose this type of food over burgers & fries. Whenever I am in the neighborhood, I will stop by for other fish dishes."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of sushi but ironically I don't usually consider myself a huge fan of seafood. But I was feeling adventurous and my poki bowl was excellent. I got 1/2 brown rice 1/2 salad with spicy tuna, salmon, avocado, red onions, green onions and sprouts. The salad and salmon were tossed in their house sauce (soy sauce, sesame oil, garlic). Super fresh, clean, friendly and delicious. A++ would recommend"}
{"text":"Will you guys please open a downtown Phoenix location please please. I need poké bowl everyday. Nummmmm!!!"}
{"text":"This place is ok if you're really craving poke. I definitely don't think that it's worth the money though. The first time I had a poke bowl was in California and it was amazing. The scoop that they use here for the fish is so ridiculously small! Per scoop you probably get like 4-5 pieces and they charge you a dollar extra for avocado. The sauces that they use aren't very flavorful either."}
{"text":"This is my go to place!!! For those who haven't been to a fast-poke bowl place it is basically chipotle but for sashimi grade fish! They have many different types of fish such as tuna, spicy tuna, salmon, yellowtail, scallops, octopus, etc. large bowls are $10.75 which gives you three generous scoops of fish, and you choose your sauces and toppings. The prices are great to the quality and serving size you get. I'm in here 2-3 times a week because of it! If you're a fish lover and healthy eater, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Decided to stop in for lunch on a Friday afternoon. I got there about 12:30 so while there was still a lunch crowd it wasn't too bad. I ordered the organic salad with salmon, house spicy and creamy spicy dressings and everything (minus the guac and crab salad). I really enjoyed the salad so much! Very tasty and fresh. We went back on Sunday for lunch and this time I did the same but instead of the salad I choose brown rice. It was so filling I couldn't eat it all and took it home for later.

I like the set-up (think chipolte) but there are still growing pains they are working through as it is very hard to hear the person on the other side of the glass wall to place your order and vice versa. I know that the glass is probably set to a health code level but still makes things a bit difficult. Also, because it is drawing such a big crowd there is a back-up when they are making your food. I know once they find their groove it will run much smoother."}
{"text":"Best Ahi Style Salad I've Ever Had!

I don't always eat salads, but when I do I like to eat this kind of salad!

I hit the 2 scoops of salmon and a scoop of seasoned tuna. I got pretty much everything thrown in. 

It was great!

Friendly smiling staff and clean environment. 

Stop in here for a nice happy meal!

Thanks ladies!"}
{"text":"Busy location, friendly staff & clean dining area. The seafood is very fresh. I always get, the regular brown rice bowl w/spicy tuna & shrimp, house sauce, topped with cucumber, jicama, bean pods & sesame seeds. It satisfies my tastebuds every time! I'll definitely be a regular customer, just with there was a location in North Scottsdale."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. Fish tastes fresh, great options for the bowl, super fast. I also got some macaroon ice cream."}
{"text":"This is possibly the same owner as the last place that served fish in this location. In any case, I found this new concept more flavorful and conducive to my taste. 
It's basically like a Subway or Chipotle but for fish. You order a base of lettuce or rice and then start topping away....octopus, tuna, salmon....and then all kinds of toppings. It's up to you and what flavors you are feeling like.
Although the food is good, the guys preparing behind the counter could take a few customer service lessons from their Chipotle neighbors. Being a first timer, they tried to rush me through the line without explaining how anything worked. And one of the dudes was staring off at the hotties next to us instead of paying attention to what I was telling him. 
In any event, tasty, fast and reasonably priced. Lower stars for sub-par customer service."}
{"text":"Really weird here. Never did get to eat here because they wouldn't let me alter my meal . I ordered a special salmon plate the would have allowed me three scoops of salmon. A bit weird in itself so I asked if I may exchange a scoop of salmon for a scoop of avocado. They said no. I pointed out to them that the pictured item showed the dish containing the avocado and they told me they haven't had a chance to change the board and that an added scoop of avocado would be 1.50 extra. I tried to reason with these  people and they asked other managers if they could and the manager refused also. I mean really a scoop of avocado cannot be any more expensive than a scoop of what the counter guy said was wild salmon. So then why not make the change and satisfy me. The guy said I should try to work with him and I explained that I was the customer and he should try to work with me. They wouldn't. Enough said. Never again."}
{"text":"Im always skeptical of chain restaurants but Ahipoki was surprisingly good. My friends and I ended up going here three times during our stay in Phoenix. The food was good and fresh. The service was quick."}
{"text":"Pretty great. My food was awesome but the ordering process is kinda confusing. They should explain the sauces better. Also make sure to note what size bowl you got - they overcharged me $4 because they thought I got a large."}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars. It's hard to compare anything to a fresh poke bowl in Hawaii but this place is darn close! I enjoyed a half and half brown rice and salad base, citrus dressing, tuna and salmon with all of the toppings. I'd rather see fresh sliced avocado than a scoop of avocado, but still great. I had all of the toppings except for the fish eggs. We came for dinner and served very quickly. It is the same idea as a chipotle, assembly line style, pick what you want! The staff seems to be pretty in tune. Great location too. My husband and I really enjoyed it and hope this place opens up in Tempe!"}
{"text":"The food is good. They started getting a little stingy with the toppings. I asked for more Masago and the girl gave me a death stare as she put a tiny scoop on my stuff. If it costs more, just say so. Sorry to bother you, my money is green and I thought you worked here. I miss the food because I have not been back since."}
{"text":"Great place for some poke.  A little different from the way they do poke in Hawaii, but I love all the extra ingredients.  I've only tried the tuna and yellowtail, but hope to be trying more. I really love they give you a choice of base ingredients (brown rice, white rice, salad or a combo).  A little crowded at times, but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Finally a place where you can build your own poke bowl opens up in AZ. I love poke bowls!!
It's located in the plaza on Thomas and Scottsdale Rd.
You start by choosing your base of white & brown rice, salad mix or half and half. Then you choose your fish like tuna, yellowtail , salmon etc. you pick your sauce ( they offer 4 different sauces),  then you finish off your bowl with the different toppings they have. 
You can either get a regular which comes with two scoops of fish or a large which comes with three scoops of fish.
The staff was friendly but they seemed a little flustered and all over the place. But it's only the second day and they will get the groove of things.
Also the iced green tea was disappointing because it wasn't green tea. It was jasmine tea!
Overall I enjoyed the food, service was good and I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! My first time was about 3 weeks ago, and let me just say I have been returning each week since. The food is very fresh, and have several different ways to mix and match. When I say mix and match I mean different sauces, different veggies, and different proteins. Also the best part is if you're going in during your lunch time expect to be there a few minutes because it is super quick to get your food even faster than fast food restaurants but healthy ;). It is affordable and if you want to add avocado it's only $1 more what a steal and they give a good amount of it! (I'm an avocado lover so for me to have left over is a good thing lol) 

I've only gone to the tempe location, but I'm sure it will be the same satisfaction at all locations!"}
{"text":"Ok - I will be the 1st to admit, if not for the service I've consistently received here, this would be a SOLID five star rating.  On more than one occasion (this is rather consistent in the old town Scottsdale area) I've experienced an overall distaste for the customer in almost every capacity.  Like most the people working there (at places like this AND full service joints) hate the service aspect of their jobs.  It's a shame.

Moving onto the more important part, the fud.  Simply perfection in a bowl.  It's rare that I am both satisfied and proud of myself when I finish a meal, and this is so healthy that it's hard not to be proud of yourself once you're done.  

There are no doubt carbs in the sauces and rice, but most of what goes into the bowl is so healthy I feel energized after eating here every time.  I've had all the protein / sauce / rice combinations and haven't ever been disappointed.

It's like they took the Chipotle concept but it's fresh fish / sushi toppings instead.  I love the concept and I have never been disappointed in the food.  I've never stayed there to eat, so I can't speak to the ambiance... but I do hope that the service aspect that seems to run rampant in Snottsdale will improve sooner than later!"}
{"text":"Love this place, always fresh and I get it exactly how I want it.  I come weekly, and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Downgrading due to a price increase that seems to come with a decrease in the quantity of fish and employees that seem absolutely miserable.  Still a great concept, but it seems like a bit of a bait and switch."}
{"text":"Ahi poke.... It's been on my mind for the past four days..

I came here on the soft opening day on 4/1 after I saw Joyce W's check in and review. Since my visit here, Ahi poke has been on my mind and keep thinking when I can go back to eat more of their ahi poke.

Service was great! It's their soft opening day but they were very well trained with friendly smiles.

It's not exactly the same as what I had in Hawaii, but it is as good as it gets in Arizona.

2 scoop bowl is too small portion size (well at least for me), I thought I would order 3 scoop at my next visit. fish is fresh, good toppings to choose from, I would love to come back for more whenever I can."}
{"text":"The best seafood places I have been to. Everything is very fresh and the staff is very nice and helpful. I will continue to come here and eat since it is very close by my work"}
{"text":"Yes. Yes. Yes. Quality and Speed rolled into one. Fresh ingredients, clean set up, friendly smiles and fast service - seriously, I want to own this place if I win the lottery. A plus on the variety of macaroon ice cream they sell on the side! Portion wise for the price is so/so. Don't go if you feel like you haven't eaten in 4 days. But all in all, I'm impressed. Visited a handful of times and it has always been a good experience! Wish they deliver ."}
{"text":"Love the food. Hate the music. I'm not sure whose idea it was to play the same music as El Hefe at a restaurant, but it was a bad one. It's not healthy to have that high of a heart rate while eating. 
The bowls are awesome, I would just recommend taking it to go to avoid the headache."}
{"text":"I love Poke bowls and with poke places popping up all across the valley. Ahipoki needs to step it up....
No jalapeños, when the employee was dishing out my bowl I asked for cucumber she gave me 3 pieces, maybe 6 edamame. I thought ok this is how they have been taught. But the lady in line behind me asked for cucumber and she got a thick stack. I also like better sliced avocado as opposed to all smashed up it looked a little brown. So  maybe just a careless employee. I will give them another chance.  In my opinion a poke bowl is full of fresh looking toppings."}
{"text":"The concept is really great but the poke was below expectations. The white rice was also incredible dry and a good poke bowl comes with hot fresh stickier rice.  I personally thought that tako poke bowl was decent which is the reason for the 3 stars. My other 4 party members originally from Hawaii had the traditional poke bowl style (rice and ahi) instead of the Haole chipotle style. They all agreed that the ahi poke that Costco sells on Fridays & Saturday's is a lot better and it actually tastes like the poke from Hawaii unlike this place."}
{"text":"My first time in stunning Ahipoki good place environments excellent food fresh and delicious. I will definitely return to this place soon. Also good service."}
{"text":"Don't tell anyone but I've never had a poke bowl before visiting this place.  I had the two scoop with tuna and salmon on 1/2 brown rice and 1/2 salad.  The flavors were very vibrant and the portion was just right.  The next time I'll skip the wasabi as that really hit me hard and blew open my sinus cavity!

They were out of regular iced tea but gave me a green tea which I wasn't really wild about as a substitute."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times since their opening & I love it. My family & I are huge sushi fans & AhiPoke Bowl does a great job! Their food is wonderful & the restaurant is clean! I highly recommend it! 
On the other hand, as some others have mentioned.. I did notice that the staff on a couple occasions were not entirely present and didn't use the right fish or weren't listening correctly. Some seemed as though they weren't overly excited to assist & the shop had just opened (11am) so there wasn't much of an excuse on their end. For the most part my experiences have been great, hence the five stars."}
{"text":"This place is pretty new but the food is awesome! It's like eating a sushi roll in a bowl and it's really fresh seafood and veggies! The staff was very nice and helpful in taking our orders. The pricing is extremely reasonable and comparable to a traditional sushi restaurant.

I was happy that the bowl filled me up pretty quickly and was fresh. We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a co-worker. Excellent choices, fresh, and fun! Nice place, will be back"}
{"text":"Was super excited when AhiPoki opened and have been going all the time. Moving from California where there is poke on every corner to Arizona where there's none sucks. Everything's been awesome until the last few visits. Every time I come the toppings I get are always different amounts. Yesterday the girl tried to charge me extra for seaweed after barely giving me any. Why is seaweed even an additional charge in the first place? If you're going to stand there and try and charge me more when I ask don't be stingy and give me the right amount to begin with. 

The quality of ingredients is awesome and I will continue to come but I hope someone reads this and the other similar reviews and fixes the problem. I know I am not the only one with this same issue."}
{"text":"Love this place I share with people about it all the time. The chipotle of sushi is how I explain it. Always busy but very efficient in making the line move quickly. Very fresh sushi and ingredients not to mention very filling with great portions. Hands down if I lived closer I would be here a few times a week. We need more in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"I just LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place!!!

Our bowls were full of poke goodness! Every ingredient offered was fresh! The hard part was deciding what you wanted in your bowl...so many options and choices!

Super healthy and delicious!

You have to try this place...once you do, you'll be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place! The food is delicious and love that you can make so many different meals with all of the options. It's great that there are healthier options with the the brown rice and salad options! There is something for everyone who likes fish and sushi! Being able to mix the fish you get, 2 servings with a regular and 3 with a large, makes it very customizable which I am all about! The toppings are endless from avocado, wasabi, seaweed, and cucumber and so many more! The sauces are great the house is perfect but creamy spicy is my favorite. The fact that you can get exactly what you want in your own bowl to make it the perfect meal for you is wonderful! The only problem is in the physical bowls there isn't enough room for all the food you get! This is not really a problem at all, but just goes to show how much quality food you can get here! For sure making this a quick dinner go to from now on! Wish they had more locations!"}
{"text":"Was sooooooo excited when I heard they were finally opening a poke place in Arizona! First tried it a few months back in Cali where it's super popular now.  Finally had the chance to try it w/ the hubby.  He ordered he regular bowl. I ordered be half salad half white rice. It's set up like a chipotle, you choose your rice/salad, then your meat, your sauce, and finally your toppings.   I ordered a green tea and he ordered the Thai tea.   When we sat down to eat it.... We weren't impressed just by how it looked.. But sometimes looks are deceiving... So we started to dig in to see how it was.. Still... Not impressed ... The meat tasted fresh.. But the sauce lacked flavor.... We had to add soy sauce to make it taste a little better ....  Onto the drinks.  The Thai tea tasted watered down .... As did my iced green tea .... Which was not green... More of a muddy water color which was very unappetizing .... All in all ... We felt cheated .. Overpriced and not satisfying. ... Not sure if I'll be back again ... Not the same experience I had in Cali"}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty & heathy! What else can you name a good restaurant and food? This might not be a traditional Poki Bowl, but it's very good!

I had brown rice and salad half half, with tuna & salmon, dressing with the sweet citrus, and topping with everything but onion and green onion. The rice and salad combination is one of my dreaming base for dinner, but I do not find many restaurant serve like this. Dressing is a bit lack of flavor. (My husband had house spicy, and it tastes pretty much the same as mine.) Maybe try the topping selectively, because the combination over 10 types of food makes the whole dish too complicated.

Very long waisting line... It took us almost 15 mins to get our food... As a fast food setting, this is too far from the 'fast'."}
{"text":"Finally a fast and healthy made to order concept like Chipotle [which happens to be next door] and we are hooked on poke! [a hawaiian rawfish salad appetizer]  Super surprised and happy about the great quality and freshness of the fish being that is being served 'fast food' style.
 
I had the regular - 2 scoop [$9] with brown ice, spicy tuna and yellowtail [which was $1 extra] with the sweet citrus sauce. Hubby had the large - 3 scoop [$11] with spicy tuna, albacore and salmon with the House spicy sauce.

All the toppings are fresh and flavorful. I was a little let down with the yellowtail, but the spicy tuna and hubby's albacore was outstanding. I liked the citrus dressing but preferred his house spicy. The seaweed salad was a little overpowering for me, so will skip next time.

Our 19 year old swimmer dropped by on his way home from a swim meet that evening based on our 'rave' review and the 3 scoop with brown rice bowl with extra avocado filled him up which is no easy feat!

Definitely going back, reading a few other reviews I think next time I will try 'half brown rice and half salad with a scoop of spicy tuna, tuna and albacore with house spicy sauce with a little bit of all the toppings and just shake it all together in the to go box' - sounds fabulous! 

Fab food, fast service with helpful [and patient] staff, modern and casual interior with lots of seating + super clean. Welcome to AZ Ahipoki Bowl. We love you!!"}
{"text":"I'm so excited to have another healthy lunch place nearby!  We went during opening weekend and everything was great.  I think the owner or manager was working the cash register and he gave us coupons for our next time back.  The bowls are really good; fish is fresh.  Try the Hawaiian tuna poke they have!  Their portion sizes are smaller than I expected, but the quality of ingredients is definitely there."}
{"text":"The ingredients was all fresh and tasted amazing, however the bowls they use are so small.  Quantity vs price is crazy.  The Poke restaurants they have back home in CA have choices in the size of the bowl.  So coming to this place was a bit of a disappointment.  Cause for the cost that I paid which was over $10.00 for a rather small bowl with no drink in San Diego, I would have been given at least a medium bowl.  Not sure if I will return to this place or not.  

Note:  this is my own personal review I don't want what I'm saying to be taken out of context.  People should develop their own dislikes or pleasures with this establishment.  HAPPY EATS"}
{"text":"\"Sit down, shut up, and stick it in your mouth!\" 

That's what I would tell anyone who says, \"Eww! I don't eat raw fish!\" 

Seriously....I am not a big raw fish fan, but this place is good. It also doesn't leave you filling gross and heavy. 

This place gets busy. So come early. 

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So happy to have a poke place nearby! Came here for their grand opening, and was happy to see the place popping! I ordered a bowl of the salmon poke and their luau special ahi. The fish was fresh and they had quite the selection of toppings. In the future, i would pass on the rice as it was kind of hard. Al dente rice isn't  my preference when eating poke. Their house sauce is a great sesame mix and complemented their salad option well. I liked that they had a tako (octopus) option, and was happy to see not just ahi available. The price wasn't outrageous- the large was 10.95 and had 3 scoops of fish which was plenty. The regular comes with 2 scoops for 8.95. A little tip if you cant decide which protein you want..  you can mix the different l!
 I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"OK, so I'm a semi regular and have been coming here since they opened... Not only have they raised their prices by a significant amount, it would appear that they are getting stingy with the portions, too. This place isn't cheap, but one of the reasons I was willing to pay for it was because they gave you heaping spoon fulls of stuff, including the fish. Now, I'm not sure I can justify coming here quite as often as I no longer feel I'm getting value for the money paid."}
{"text":"First time having this cuisine, and I was impressed. I love sushi, so this was right up my alley. Pretty fresh, and great price compared to sushi. I got the half rice half salad regular, with spicy tuna and salmon. I love that combo in sushi rolls, and loved it here too. Yum!"}
{"text":"Delicious! I had a small poke bowl with the brown rice & salad combo with onion and avocado, house spicy sauce, shrimp & spicy tuna, sprouts, cucumber, pickled daikon, ginger, edamame, seaweed salad and a sprinkle of sesame seeds and chilli flakes. I topped it off with a tropical drink.

I had been in here once previously and was a little put off by the overwhelming fishy smell. I know that may be a bit expected at a place with fish but it was an overwhelming unpleasant smell. They seem to have a better grip on whatever the cause was. The food tasted exceeding fresh the fish did not have any type of unpleasant odor or flavor at all. I was incredibly surprised by how good this was. There was more than enough for me and on a hungry day may go for the bigger bowl. 

I did feel a bit uncertain as to how it was broken down as I selected my items. I was also a bit surprised that the toppings weren't labeled so that I could see what it was that I was choosing. Fortunately, I know what pea sprouts look like, chilli flakes etc... someone else may not be aware of the daikon vs something else.

Anyhow, I will def check the place out again."}
{"text":"Obsessed is an understatement. Quick, easy, delicious! The chipotle for sushi. Thanks ahipoke bowl."}
{"text":"Love this place and the staff! This is probably my 17 year old son's most requested restaurant, so we grab bowls to go 1 to 2 times per week.

The fish is always fresh and the service is always friendly. My only request would be to bring back the jicama!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat!!! I'm from Hawaii and love to eat sushi, poke, sashimi etc. It's hard to find places that have poke. The raw fish is pretty good but I enjoy the sauce they put on it. I always get the house spicy sauce, tastes good. The price is pretty reasonable also. The Thai iced tea is pretty good also, it's not overly sweet. I eat here every chance I get."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and generous servings for the price! I love the options they have for seafood, veggies, sauces, and toppings. I have been to other poki places in CA and this place was by far way better. I feel like they really provided a variety of texture differences, which I really appreciated. I got the small bowl half brown rice half salad with salmon and spicy tuna. I added avocado, onions, sprouts, crab meat, seaweed salad, masago, cucumber, edamame, sesame seeds, crunchy fried onion, dried seaweed, and chili flakes with the spicy house sauce  (which I believe is some sort of ponzu sauce mixture) and it was bomb. I would say the spicy house sauce with the chili flakes still wasn't spicy enough for me so next time I plan to ask for extra and maybe add a little sriracha on the side. Before I left I also ordered one coffee and one green tea macaroon ice cream sandwiches. In hind sight, I should have ordered it when I was paying for my food the first time around so I had some time to defrost because they were pretty frozen... Like rock hard frozen.  They had good flavor though. The texture of the macaroon was not french macaroon like at all but still good.

If you haven't been here and like sushi, definitely give it a go! I will definitely be coming back here a lot."}
{"text":"New fav!!!!  Gonna obsess over when I can come back to eat here again.  I was close by and pulled up my trusty Yelp app to find my starving self some healthy food.  I was a little hesitant because other poke I've had wasn't very good, but I just couldn't shake the urge to try it.  Sooooo glad I did.   I had the salad base , the salmon and Tuna luau,  house sauce, lots of veg and toppings (ginger was my fav and seaweed salad oh my heavens )  ....  I was blown away at how delicious everything was.  Genius easy fast healthy affordable."}
{"text":"Wow!! Slam dunk Poke spot. Generous portions, quality fish and toppings. Fresh and decent prices. I got a huge salad, they put tons of lettuce and toppings, with three scoops of fish. Spicy tuna, salmon, and the luau. Yellowtail was +$1. Would definitely come back for a healthy refreshing lunch or dinner. 

It's in a strip mall, but don't let the location fool you. This place is great!"}
{"text":"Right next door to a Chipotle, you can expect very similar concept of what to do, but with raw fish and sushi toppings. Love the spicy tuna and salmon the most. The sauces to me were mediocre. I think Pokinometry (in Cali) is the best for poki; however, Ahipoki Bowl will have to suffice for now here in AZ. 

The workers on Sunday were a bit rude when I went (the 3 boys at the station of giving rice, fish, and sauce). I'm not sure if they couldn't hear me through the tall glass separations, or just flat out didn't want to be there at work, but I didn't feel like they were helpful or concerned about the bowl they were assembling. A quick slap of rice, slaps of fish and quick squirts of sauce. There wasn't anybody behind me...so why the rush? Since I got the larger bowl, I get three choice of fish. I asked for spicy tuna, and the other two to be salmon... But the second scoop didn't even look full. I was pretty sad since I love salmon! Not to mention...they didn't toss it in the metal bowl for me. I had to do it myself with all the toppings on top. It was a challenge as there were barely any space for me to mix it myself. 

Overall... I felt like the workers just didn't wanna be there on a Sunday before July 4...but still... It kind of ruined my first time experience with Ahipoki. I'll be back here when I'm in town to give it another try since I love poki, but we'll see if they'll improve their customer service."}
{"text":"Met up with some folks for a UYE. I had never had poke before but have had raw fish in other forms. I got the large size on a salad base with tuna, shrimp, salmon and avocado. For my dressing I chose spicy creamy. I could have done well with just a medium but I managed to eat the whole plate. It helped that it was very good. They actually serve it in the to go container so I imagine quite a few people don't finish it while there. I know at least two at our table got a bag to carry the container out in. Service was quick and friendly. Of course everything was spotless. There is a mixture of seating types. We took over an entire community table and grabbed an extra chair."}
{"text":"Flavor party in my mouth. The prices are a little high and portions a little small but overall I think that it's a new and exciting concept."}
{"text":"Awesome, but they've got the wrong hours listed online. They're open until 10. Some staff members behind the counter are better than others"}
{"text":"For June's International Supper Club, Ahipoke Bowl was the place picked to eat at. I have to be honest, I wasn't too sure about it. Yea I love sushi, salad, rice and veggies, just not sure if I want them all together. But the day came and off I went to meet up with my fellow ISCUYE goers.

After studying the menu and still felling clueless I went and headed into line  If you are familiar with Chipotle style ordering, then you would pick up on the way to order.  I went with a regular bowl, which was 2 scoops of tuna with white rice, crab meat, mixed house spicy & spicy creamy for the sauce and added cucumber, green onions and chili flakes.

Took my meal to the table and still was very unsure of this. Grabbed my fork, and before you knew my entire bowl was empty! OMG its soo GOOD!  I couldn't believe how tasty this bowl was, so fresh and delish!

Great bowl at great price! Looking forward to going back."}
{"text":"Love this place! The portion seemed small at first however it really filled me up and there was enough sauce to coat all of the rice. My one issue is that the toppings scoops are a bit too small (got 4 pieces of edemame) and the wasabi portion was far too large for me. Other than that I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am addicted to the food here!  I have been about ten times since they opened a couple months ago.  I love the \"subway/chipotle style\" bar of options.  The fish is fresh and their dressings and recipes are delicious.  The only complaint I have is on service, it's unpredictable.  In the soft opening there was a couple managers who went above and beyond to make sure we were happy.  The last couple times I have practically argued with the fist staff member to eventually greet me.  The younger staff members could use a little service training and coaching.  I waited for a few minutes today at the beginning of the bar to be acknowledged.  Everyone was actively avoiding eye contact and I think they were arguing about who was going to be the greeter.  Food was still great and we will still come back.  Just getting frustrated with service."}
{"text":"Ahi was fresh along with all the other items. 
Just a bit stingy on the amounts for the price and extra for Avocado and crab toppings. 
Ask for extra sauce mine needed more. 
The guy who helped me was rushing me through the line when only one person was behind me. 
I was hoping for a better experience. 
For the price of 13.00 for just a small bowl, not thinking I'll go back. 
Bummer."}
{"text":"I'm sorry you don't like your job.  I really hope you find a position that doesn't make you hate your life in the future,  since this one clearly isn't it. 

With that being said,  there's no reason for your dislike of your position to make my dining experience unfavorable. Especially when our interaction simply stands at, you asking what I would like on my salad, listening to my response and then scooping toppings onto said salad!

I've been here 3 times. The first time was shortly after they opened. The food was mediocre and service a bit frazzled, but friendly & informative.  The sauces were lacking and the fish wasn't super fresh but the concept is fun.  Since they were new,  I gave the place another chance a couple months later.  I was pleasantly surprised. The food tasted way better the next time. Fresher, more flavorful and vibrant and def looked aesthetically appealing too. I left, glad that I gave it another try.  

But today. Oh, today. We walked in at about 250pm on a Friday.  There was no one in line but about 5 people behind the service counter probably trying to setup for dinner. The initial girl was polite. It looked like she had a long day but still smiled weakly. I get it! Making money isn't easy. Props to you for doing it anyway.  She scooped my salad into a metal bowl and a small bit of rice into the corner of the plastic container. A ok so far. She does the same to the BF and we wait. Yep, even though there are 5 people behind the counter, we wait about 2-3 mins before the next person comes to help. Ok, not a big deal. Your lunch rush was just over and I'm sure you're just looking to refill things. 

As I'm standing there,  I notice that the salmon is down to a scoop or two in the container. The BF loves lots of salmon with his food. They're probably prepping it and will be out with more soon, I think to myself. But no salmon appears. Guy finally walks over,  already slightly annoyed that he had to help someone and grabs my food. He asks for my fish selection. I politely ask if there is anymore salmon, to which he nods slightly, and completely ignores the question.  Again asking what fish I'd like. Ok, I'll just go with it. \"2 Tuna and 1 salmon, please.\" He scoops 1 tuna and 1 salmon and asks for my 3rd fish choice. \"Tuna, please.\" He looks up and stares, like, why didnt you say that to begin with. Uh, ok. That was weird. Maybe he just didn't hear me. Yeah, we'll go with that. 

On to the sauce. Now this is where my understanding nature stops. WTF, dude. Seriously,  WTF. He asks me for my sauce choice and I say house spicy and creamy spicy please. He goes \"huh?\" and looks around as though I were crazy. So I think maybe I'm only supposed to choose 1 sauce. Ok, my fault. \"Creamy spicy, please.\" I say this 3 times before he exasperatedly asks, \"spicy creamy?\" Yes, you ass. Obviously. Sorry I'm not an expert at your sauces to recite them verbatim from memory (the signs for sauce choices are around the bend in the counter but they always ask about sauce choice before you've walked that far). 

Yay. On to the toppings. Smooth sailing from here, right? Nope! He asks again,  what would you like, and I say, \"a little of everything please.\" Easy. A scoop of everything and we're done. He goes about scooping and I ask for a lot of ginger. He ignores me. Continues to scoop and gives me a small dollop of ginger. At the end,  I ask again. \"A little more ginger, please.\" He looks up, almost disgusted that I asked, sighs audibly, and puts on another dollop of ginger. Dry toppings? Again I say \"a little of everything, please.\" And again, the exasperated look and sigh. 

There was only my bf and another customer behind me. I am neither taking too long nor am I making outlandish requests. I was reasonable and knew what I wanted but apparently in his estimation, my food choices were absurd. I felt completely rushed and disrespected the whole time while ordering. Would the extra 30secs of helping me really affect your business so much with 2 other people in line behind me?! 

Ahipoke Bowl, please don't let your service issues affect your future business.  I'm not necessarily saying that the customer is always right,  but if they make reasonable requests,  please don't let them leave feeling as though their business is not important. I was sorely disappointed today."}
{"text":"The Tuna Luna that I ordered seemed it wasn't fresh. Boy was I right. I just hope I don't go home sick now. Btw they are very greedy on the scoop sizes. They tried to take as much off of the scoop to give less than the average scoop of fish. Poke Bar is better than AhiPoke."}
{"text":"Was in town just for the day 
Had there large poke bowl 3 scoops
With white rice
1 scoop tuna
1 scoop salmon 
1 scoop yellow tail 
Added avocado with there house sauce (soy ginger) to much for 1 to eat but it was excellent. Fresh and light . Very helpful and friendly servers"}
{"text":"I am originally from California and have been waiting for a poke place to open in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area so once I heard of this place opening I HAD to come try it!Overall, great quality of food, fresh fish, good portions. However, the ONLY thing I realized was that they are a little on the cheap end with a couple of their fish so it is a tiny bit on the pricey end but as long as the quality and freshness of the food is good then I'm good! I'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"I went to the Scottsdale location right when it first opened. The restaurant was busy, but yet a great place to be at. The food is fresh and delicious. I would recommend the salad!"}
{"text":"First of all, I loved this place. That is why I gave 4 stars. A few things however. First I have to wonder why vegetarians are bitching about a place with fish in the name. Anyway, the people serving aren't the friendliest. They seem like they don't really like their job. Also, the \"extras\" are a bit small. But the attitude of the employees make you feel like you can't ask for extra. All in all, the food is quite tasty for semi fast food."}
{"text":"this was my second time here, first time was during the summer and was not impressed but i think they had just opened. the guy who helped me today was super nice and helpful. i had the spicy tuna with spicy house sauce over salad with most the the toppings (not fish eggs ew lol)  and it was DELICIOUS and super spicy, loved it! usually when they say \"spicy\" its too bland for me but this was just right. 
gave 4 stars only due to fish portions are a bit small, next time will get the 3 scoops i think its only a couple dollars more. also they should label the toppings, it would make it easier and line move faster :)"}
{"text":"I came to ahi poki bowl the week it originally opened and it was a fun experience and the food was good. I was extremely excited to bring my cousin back. When I began the ordering process the woman helping me was extremely rude and off putting. So rude my cousin decided not to order. Really unfortunate and I hope others don't receive the same service."}
{"text":"When this was the first poke restaurant in town, it was hands down my favorite place to go. Recently, however, I realized the portions have gotten smaller and less consistent. Additionally, the quality has gone down. On one occasion my fish was still partially frozen and my avocado (which I paid extra for) smelled old. This poor quality made the bowl unappetizing. 

What really put me off is the decreased customer service at Ahipoki Scottsdale. The employees there are trained to do the same job over and over (i.e. Add sauce to your bowl, add toppings, etc). I think this takes away from a good customer experience because employees have a hard time straying from the normal order. 

One incident of bad customer service happened to me last week. I live by ASU Tempe and drove to the Scottsdale location (even though I can walk to the Tempe location) because they had a $2 off facebook offer if you buy a bowl between 9pm and 10pm. I was so excited for the offer I even brought a friend. Unfortunately the employee working the cash register was too occupied counting the money to quickly ring up my order. I grew impatient and when she finally rang me up I completely forgot to use my facebook offer. I realized this a minute later and went back up to the cashier and asked her to refund me since I forgot to show her my offer. She told me it was too late since I already paid and I should come back another day. Well, I was going out of town the next morning and unable to return another day. 

Since I had gone out of my way to go to this location at an unusual time to use the offer, I was very upset with how she easily she brushed off my request. Honestly, I will not be going out of my way again for Ahipoki Scottsdale. There are much better locations in The Valley that I've had better customer experiences with and will now choose over Ahipoki."}
{"text":"By far my favorite place to eat for lunch or dinner. If you haven't been here you are missing out on the yummy poke bowls! The staff are super friendly and helpful, it is always slammed but they are fast to get you through the line and get in and out quickly during lunch hour. Recommend getting the tuna luau with house spicey and spicey creamy mixed together. And get the crab salad! If you have a sweet tooth grab one of the macaroon ice cream sandwiches out of the freezer they are delicious!!"}
{"text":"SO GOOD! This place is going to be so popular.

It is like a chipotle but for sushi! Everything tasted fresh and the staff was helpful in describing the items. I would definitely recommend coming here. I loved their spicy sauce too!

My only recommendations would be to make a sushi burrito option and to be open past 9 pm on week nights!"}
{"text":"Poki bowls are a food revelation!  I am a huge sushi fan, and the poki bowls are basically putting everything great about sushi all in one bowl.  Hubby and I both got 3 scoop bowls.  They ended up being really really big and neither of us could finish.  Don't let the fact that everything in the bowl is light fool you.  These bowls will fill you up!  The salmon and tuna were very fresh, and I loved the huge selection of free additions to the bowl at the end of the process.  Can you please bring one of these to Tempe?!"}
{"text":"Love this place! I eat here at least once a week with my fiancé! I love the unlimited toppings and the tuna Luna"}
{"text":"Food was great but the service not so much. I was greeted by a young gal with a terrible attitude while at the same time unhygienic. She touched her hair while she prepared to put rice on my bowl. Yuck! Though she did have gloves on with one hand but not the other. Why is that is beyond me?!? For $11.24 for a large bowl you cannot beat the price. Good flavors, just terrible service. Will come again, but hopefully at a time where the gal that served me isn't there."}
{"text":"Yes, yes, and YES. I think I'm inappropriately excited that this place exists and is SO close to me (!!!!) I've been meaning to go for quite awhile, and today was the day. I got the regular bowl, half brown rice and half salad, with salmon and tuna. I added avocado, onion, and got green onions, cucumber, ginger and sesame seeds for my toppings. I opted for the house sauce, which was refreshing and a tad bit sweet. I also got a thai iced tea. YUM!!!! The fish is really fresh and tasted amazing. That is a rarity in Scottsdale, and it made me so happy that it really was high quality. My only complaint is that when I got to the last bite of my bowl, I wanted more. I see myself frequenting this place a lot.....On poke cloud nine!
Service was fast, efficient, and friendly. 
The price is great ($8.99) considering that you do get a good amount of fish in the bowl."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place at least twice a week for the last couple months and it keeps going downhill. They are so stingy with the fish, they are counting the pieces of tuna as they scoop it. For the price tag, they should be more generous with the meat. What am I actually paying for if there's little to no meat? The workers have been less friendly every time I go in. I'm very disappointed with the service lately and my go-to dinner spot isn't just what it used to be."}
{"text":"drove 35 min to get here since my friend liked it but it was a complete disappointment. The iced green tea was so watery, you're better off drinking free water. I ordered 2 large bowls with 3 scoops each. I tried the tuna, spicy tuna, salmon, albacore, and the yellowtail. having all the fish and toppings on top of the rice, I couldn't get the harmony of flavors I would get from eating real sushi. The seaweed salad tasted horrible too........ never coming back"}
{"text":"I've been a patron here since they first opened but sadly, as time progresses, their service and portions have greatly diminished. Moreover, their prices aren't any better and they have no shame in overcharging for 'extras' (they never did before). I recently made a third visit within a month and on all three visits, not ONE staff member smiled, greeted me, or seemed happy in their job. The topper was having Arima throw my receipt at me and walk away without any indication if she required my signature for the debit card transaction or not. As a native Hawaiian from Kaua'i, this place severely lacks the Aloha Spirit and when you're serving our native food...no make pilau kine with da customers! At least PRETEND you're happy to see your patrons!"}
{"text":"Very nice decor,  nice staff, super helpful .
Told me what was in the sauces as I'm on the ketogenic diet.

Fresh tasting, I think this could  become my new addiction.  Great for low carbers if you choose wisely."}
{"text":"This food is absolutely amazing! I have never been to a place like this or seen one in the Phoenix area. If you enjoy this type of cuisine you will not be disappointed. You get more than enough food for a great price and the staff is very kind and helpful. 

I highly recommend trying them out on the corner of Scottsdale and Thomas!! Will for sure be back and very often!"}
{"text":"Best ahi poke bowl you'll get in Arizona. My mistake was getting the bowl, it's a better value if you get the plate, comes with white/brown rice & salad. Tuna, salmon & albacore was fresh. With house sauce topped with all the goodies. I'll be back for sure !"}
{"text":"I frequent this location quite often and am never disappointed. Kimchi shrimp is to die for, same with the Spicy Creamy and House sauces! They offer a great selection of toppings for your bowl - I like masago, edamame, seaweed salad, daikon sprouts, wasabi, green onion and crispy onions, and crab mix. Bomb.com! Not only is the food fresh and delicious, the staff provides superior customer service from the moment you open the door. Totally obsessed with this place!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I eat sushi multiple times a week and was skeptical of the poke craze in general.  When I heard this place opened, I wanted to go and prove myself right! But I was totally wrong.  The fish is just as fresh as any sushi place I eat at and unlike sushi, the bowl had many different textures which was a surprise.  Basically it is a build a bowl concept like chipotle. I started with white rice and I got two scoops of fish with the size I bought.  I chose the house spicy sauce and said everything for the veggies. I was little surprised to find out that they do not charge extra for crab meat as some reviews said. Not sure if the other yelpers were aware it was free because they told me they have never charged for it. Overall Ahipoki is quick, healthy and affordable. Since I work near there, I will go at least twice a week."}
{"text":"This place has decent food but.... what's up with the hyper conservative news shows on the tv. They play shows like news max tv and info wars!! Wtf the owner should put on real news not this fake garbage. I'm a conservative/republican but come on this isn't news this is conspiracy and super right wing nut job garbage!!!"}
{"text":"I'm extremely satisfied with my half br rice half salad   
Two scoops of  poke'! (Salmon + Tuna)

Yummmmy"}
{"text":"I love this place - absolutely love it. The food is delicious - always fresh. I hope they build many more. I will say the employees have been very inconsistent since they opened, though. I've had multiple people serving my food that were less than friendly. Going to be honest if it weren't for the fact that this is the only place in town that serves food like this I would probably go elsewhere - the last time we went the guy scooping fish was so rude to the lady in front of us in line - it was so weird to witness. Maybe he was in a bad mood or maybe she just really pissed him off - either way I hope the owners can find some good solid employees and not have to worry about that - the place is great otherwise."}
{"text":"I like this place. I love all the ingredients you can add into your bowl. The first time I went, I had no idea what I was doing. Ended up putting everything on it. Not a bad idea but definitely not recommended. Its definitely better to get a decent amount of add-ons so you can actually taste things. Double salmon on rice with creamy sauce, crab, seaweed salad and roe on top every time, noms!"}
{"text":"Nice portions 
Reasonable price 
Healthy
The acoustics make it feel like a cafeteria.
One thing I don't like; the server days \" do you want onions or avocado?\" Without mentioning the avocado is a dollar extra.. it's tricky and I hate to be put on guard when I just want a simple lunch"}
{"text":"Loved it!  Huge portion, great flavor, reasonable price.  If I lived near this place I would go at least 3 times a week but I don't so I will try to make it at least once a week.  The customer service is good too.  The employees seem to want to be there and are helpful with questions I had."}
{"text":"Hmm.. price has gone up. Portions have decreased. They took away the roasted seaweed. And the service has gotten bad with all the grumpy faces the employees make. Good thing Poke Bar opened in north Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The portions are fairly generous, the price isn't so bad for an area that lacks several poke options, the fish is fresh and the topping options (ha...toptions??) are plentiful...I really have no complaints!

Coming from Socal, I frequently crave poke, and Ahipoki is a great place to just satisfy that craving! I definitely recommend anyone in the area looking for a reliable poke place to check Ahipoki out!"}
{"text":"This place is fast, tasty and well worth the price.  They have a decent selection of toppings and fish and the staff is more than willing to answer questions as well.  Only problem is that they are not in florida yet.

If you are a fan of the Poke stop by this place you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"First off it's POKE and not POKI... But ok ok I get it. Come here for poke bowls that are quick and easy to make. It's hard for me to not compare the bowls to poke bowls I've had back home in Hawai'i but I'll give this place 4 stars because I understand the need for a place like this here... A niche converted to please the surrounding demographics. What I don't understand is how people will come here and throw in everything on top of their bowls. A real poke bowl is served as a bowl of sushi rice with generous portions of sashimi or poke on top and sometimes topped off with mayo, avocado green onions or white onions. Anything else out of the ordinary is a cardinal sin. A SIN I TELL YOU!

For fun I decided to compare AhiPoki Bowls to bowls found at Sushi Bay on Oahu. I tried to recreate something similar so I ordered a regular with white rice, one scoop spicy tuna and one scoop tuna, house sauce, avocado, onions, chili flakes and green onions. Gotta say not bad. Next time I'll stick to regular tuna and not the spicy tuna. Texture was kind of disturbing. My husband however decided to try everything on his bowl. He had tuna, salmon, daikon sprouts, onion, house sauce, crab meat, etc. ummm no. But he did enjoy it. It cost $20.40 for both our bowls. It was a $1 extra for avocado... No surprise there.

Would I come again? Sure. If it's not the weekend and Costco is out of their fresh never frozen ahi poke. And for $16.99 a pound? Can never go wrong with that. Go home cook rice mo bettah! Cheeee!!!"}
{"text":"Good stuff. As someone who was recently introduced to Poke, love it to death, but am still very inexperienced, wish that they had some \"house\" bowls with suggested offerings/toppings. The food was fresh, restaurant clean and atmosphere was chill. I will be back to get my poke on."}
{"text":"Mahalo Ahipoke Bowl! Such ONO food and the friendliest staff. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This place popped up on my Yelp emails so I decided to give it a try as it sounded healthy and delicious with great reviews. 

I went for a regular sized bowl with white rice and salad, 2 scoops of spicy tuna, avocado, house sauce on the side, and all the toppings except wasabi, ginger, and sprouts. 

The ratio for meat to rice/salad/toppings was uneven; too much extra stuff to too little meat. I got the house sauce on the side, which might have been better mixed in, as it was a little too sesame-tasting when I first poured it onto my food because I didn't mix/shake the contents enough prior to pouring. The total amount of food that I got was great for the price. 

We also got their \"tropical drink\" and Thai iced tea and those were pretty decent.

I felt a little rushed in line as there were people behind me, and I had never been here before but didn't feel like I had enough time to ask questions. I also think they should have a sign with the names of the toppings BY the toppings so that I know exactly what I am asking/not asking for - by the time I turned the corner for the toppings area the signs with the names were gone. 

I will definitely be back to this place (though I heard there's another poke joint opening closer to my home). I got a healthy meal for a decent price, and it tasted pretty darn good!"}
{"text":"The food was okay but what kept it going is that it's fresh. I ordered a large bowl with half brown rice and half white rice with a bit of salad. The person was nice enough to give me a bit. After ordering the tuna and salmon, the person who put the sauce asked why the rice and salad and threw most of the salad out. After my confusion he just gave my food to the next guy. Overall the portions both toppings and meat were extremely stingy. I would recommend the citris dressing though. I went to the website before their opening and compared to the California the price of a large bowl is two dollars difference. Just beware I had two fish chunks that still had bones in them. Overall the food was not to be that desired. It just doesn't seem like a place where I would eat more than once."}
{"text":"I tried this place out yesterday after wanting a fresh, quick dinner option and reading Yelp reviews! It's located on the side of the same building as Chipotle at Scottsdale and Thomas.

There was a short line as it seemed the people in front of me had also not been to ahipoki bowl before, you order sort of like chipotle/subway. 

First I got half white rice/half salad, with red onions and regular size so two scoops of salmon. I got the sauce (spicy sauce and creamy spicy sauce) on the side after a few reviewers said sauce can be a bit heavy handed. I got all the rest of the toppings except wasabi (again warned that you don't want a wasabi only bite) and crab salad, which isn't my personal fave. 

All in all it only took a couple minutes, I grabbed the food in a to go container but I ended up eating it all. I thought for the price and convenience and freshness/quality this is a great deal and it was so good! I will definitely be back, it's close by too! Some people commented the proportions were not good enough fish:salad/rest but I think it's in line with the price and the amount is fair.

Restaurant is nice and clean, had some booths and tables and counters, set up for faster turnover but that's to be expected."}
{"text":"New food here. I tried some restaurants in California but first time I stop by here. The food is pretty good, the restaurant looks very nice and friendly. Next time I would be back here again."}
{"text":"The bowls are pretty yummy. Fish has always been fresh when I've gone. The green tea was absolutely disgusting and cloudy. I like the concept! And they're very efficient!"}
{"text":"I got horrible food poisoning from this place yesterday. I got the salmon, spicy tuna, and crab. I eat sashimi all the time and never had this issue before. The workspaces weren't the cleanest :( 48 hours later and I'm still sick to my stomach."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre the first two guys serving the fish were not the friendliest, but the girl at the cashier was warm and friendly! 

The poke here tasted fresh and healthy! I had avocado, salmon and the tuna with white rice. I tried it with the sweet citrus sauce and for toppings asked for ginger and crab salad and sesame. 

By the way- if you have had poke at other places (California, Asian restaurants, Hulas Modern Tiki, Hawaii) it's not the kind of poke that is marinated in sauce. That is what I expected ..but Ahipoke was still good! 

I would have to say I would come back just because it was fast to get, chipotle slash subway style. The fish is fresh and flavors are yummy! Also super healthy! But it doesn't beat authentic poke bowls. I just hope people don't think this is what actual poke bowls are like."}
{"text":"It looked and tasted good. Fish fresh fresh fish. I compared how much fish I got with my gf, they skimped me.. I got brown rice when I asked for white rice, my iced green tea was watered down, they gave my gf a half cup of thai iced tea when they said you can get a refill when their done making more (by the time we were done eating, still none made) I know it was the second day of opening so no hard feelings lol.. I'll definitely come back n give you guys another shot (50% off for signing up email ayye)!"}
{"text":"In the words of my fellow Hawaiians... its so ono!! Haven't had this good of poke anywhere on the mainland.  Do the 1/2 and 1/2! So fresh and healthy. Casual place and great vibe. I will be back.  Mahalo!"}
{"text":"The product here is excellent, I have zero complaints in that regard and it is one of my favorite places to go for lunch or dinner. 

However, where they do lose stars is on the customer service given here regularly.. or rather, the lack of. Time and time again, I've had rude service on such a consistent basis that if the food weren't decent, I would stop coming here entirely. I expect to deal with coworkers gossiping with each other and completely ignoring the customer, extreme impoliteness or any hint of sincerity.. Girls at the register were giving each other strange looks as a customer walked up to the register, portion boys smirking condescendingly when some ask for a little more rice.. 

It's just consistently rude service, and makes me sad that such a place with such solid poke has such a terrible atmosphere as a result of some of the attitudes here."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of sushi, but this was my first Poke bowl and I was blown away. I got the regular bowl with salad, tuna, yellowtail, the spicy house sauce, and a bunch of other toppings. It was the perfect salad: fresh and delicious. Exactly what I wanted in fast food. I'll be back tomorrow!"}
{"text":"Great Sushi-poke food and yummy salad. Everything was fresh and tasted great. I can't wait to come back. This is setup just like chipotle so it's a really a casual place to eat."}
{"text":"This is a really interesting concept. I understand Chipotle stole a concept of a Furr's cafeteria and made it clean (most locations) and simple but this place has a freshness to it. You hop in line and within minutes, and a few personalized selections, you can enjoy a salad that is solid. The star removed is for the staff but I look forward to going again and getting a little more than a \"what do you want\" through a stare into my eyes while they pick up an ice cream scoop and begrudgingly slap my decision into the assembly line. Bad day, I'm sure, but will update this when I know better."}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch wanted to try out fresh fish. Taste was good but I didn't like the texture of the fish that seemed to be not really fresh. Might come back to give another chance and see how it lands."}
{"text":"I'm so happy I was finally able to make it out to this place! I saw it on the news a couple weeks ago, and I have been dying to try it. The concept is very unique, the food delicious, and the portions are hearty.  I got rice and salad and topped it with tuna and salmon. Then you get to pick a sauce, I got one that tasted like spicy mayo! Finally, you can add as many ingredients as you want for free! I'll definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Delicious! I wish there was one in the north valley! I love the concept and I'm a huge fan of poki! Just a heads up, I ordered my bowl on white rice. I didn't think about the rice being hot and my custom mixed poki (cold) on top. Too excited to think it through. Next time on salad!"}
{"text":"What?! Amazing. I love everything about this place. I like that I can choose what I want in my bowl and make it customized. Prices can be a little high depending on what you get but so worth it. It all looks so good I have to get something a little different every time!

Go. Go. Go!"}
{"text":"This is a chipotle style in poke bowls. I always order their half and half. This way you actually get a larger portion than just ordering their salad. Plus, without the rice the dish becomes overwhelmingly too salty. The ingredients are very fresh. This is the main reason I keep coming back to this joint. 

Plus, they have these delicious macaron ice cream sandwiches! Yum! It's the perfect way to end your meal."}
{"text":"Yum! Really decent portions. There's a lot of mingling flavors...which can get a little overwhelming sometimes. But I was actually impressed because originally I wasn't expecting much for essentially \"fast food sushi.\" Would recommend!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Super fresh and yummy. Bring back the jicama topping please! It was so good."}
{"text":"Great food, tastes fresh.  Gets very busy during lunch.  Easy menu to follow the tuna tasted excellent.  Getting through the line is pretty fast, but sometimes the line is out the door.  Restaurant is clean.  I'll come here again for sure.  Generally I like to spend about $10 for lunch, so this is a little more, but definately good for once per week."}
{"text":"Nice alternative to other fast food places in the area. Good selection of sushi grade fish, plenty of options to add with it.  Servers were friendly and knowledgeable.  Priced appropriately for the serving size. Will be back again for sure"}
{"text":"The food was amazing.  The attitudes of the service people..... A little hum drum.  Maybe the AZ heat is just getting to them.  But I like to go into a place and get smiles"}
{"text":"Not a great place for a vegetarian. Everything has fish or fish guts in it. I ended up getting a salad with \"avocado \" but it was really smashed up so it seemed more like guacamole. I must mention the guy at the front of the line did tell me which things had fish in them since I was vegetarian and I appreciate that.
The only dressing I could have was a vinegarette and some edamame. It was still the same price and was the size of a side salad! We got green tea which I thought would be real tea, nope some weird concoction that tasted like juiced lettuce. 
The tables all needed to be cleaned so choosing somewhere to sit was fun. I don't think I will eat here again unless I want to pay for a pricey boring salad."}
{"text":"I went to Ahipoki bowl one of the first days it opened, as I was anxiously counting down the days! I love to try new restaurants and this did not disappoint! I ordered the large bowl (go big or go home right?) and got two scoops of salmon and one scoop of yellowtail, white rice, the garlic sauce, and assorted toppings like crispy onions and crab. All the food is so compacted in there I was worried I would still be hungry since it looked smaller than a Chipotle bowl. But it was the perfect amount, I finished it all, and was left satisfied. It is definetly a refreshing option to eat out, and has a nice switch up on the usual flavor profiles I eat. The only con is that it is about a 30 minute drive from my house so I can't visit that often, even though I wish I could!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here and was delighted. The fish was fresh and well seasoned. There was a lot of options for toppings. They all looked so good it made it hard to choose! But that's not a bad problem to have. I felt like it was a good fish/toppings to rice ratio and left full and happy. The only issue I had was that the woman making my bowl was doing it wrong and didn't mix all my fish and toppings in a bowl before putting it on the rice. Next time I'll be keeping an eye out and make sure to have them mix it all up first. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I am so happy this place opened. There isn't another place like it in the valley and we really needed a good poke place. I love poke and this restaurant. I'll be back here again for sure."}
{"text":"If I could give this place ten stars I would!  It is all of my favorite foods in one.  I think it is best described as build your own deconstructed sushi roll.  Super fresh sushi grade fish, organic greens or rice and all sorts of toppings like seaweed salad, sprouts, avacado, scallions, crab and more.  It is all topped off with your choice of dressing.  The staff is all super friendly and you are in and out within 5 minutes if you want it to go.  You are missing out if you do not try this place!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't reviewed Ahipoki Bowl yet! I come to this location as well as the tempe location often but I have to say I prefer the Scottsdale location 10x more.  The staff knows what they're doing when they put my food into my bowl, and they're not stingy with how much they give you, especially the fish; often times I find that they've given me too much (which is honestly not a problem for me at all lol).  I also really appreciate the freshness of the fish here. I always get the salmon and the cubes are large, and super yummy! 

My personal favorite is the spicy house sauce, but the non spicy sauce is great too! You can opt to do half brown and white rice, but I'm not sure about going halfsies with other options.  I would recommend if you like sushi and are looking for a more on the go way of getting your fix :)"}
{"text":"As soon as I learned there was a poke place nearby I made sure to get on down as soon as possible! As soon as we pulled up to the plaza we were dismayed as we couldn't find parking ANYWHERE. I was determined to give this place a try so I had my boyfriend circle the lot while I ran inside in hopes of speedy service. Fortunately there were only two women in front of me and it seems they were helped very quickly. This place instantly reminded me of Chipotle. 

I must have looked lost as the gentleman behind the counter asked me if I had any questions after a moment of staring at the menu. He kindly guided me through my options of getting rice, salad, or half and half. I decided on a large  half and half which came with a generous scoop of brown rice and mixed greens which he prepared in a bowl before piling it into my container. I was able to choose 3 scoops of fish. I opted for the fresh tuna, fresh salmon, and the tuna luau, which was the only marinated option. I also added a scoop of avocado for an extra dollar. I was able to choose from a variety of toppings and my choice of sauce. 

Everything looked delicious! My total came out to about $13. I ended up taking my food to go and I had to deal with the tantalizing aroma the entire ride home! When I finally dug in at home I was very happy with the flavor. It was very fresh and light, yet filling. I read other reviews complaining about a lack of flavor. Maybe my palate is different, or maybe others didn't get enough of the flavorful toppings. I found mine to have the right amount of flavor. I just wish I had been given a larger scoop of the seaweed salad, but other than that everything was great. 

I am only giving 4 stars because of the parking nightmare. Other than that I would highly recommend this place for a fresh and light meal. I will put up with the parking just for my poke fix!"}
{"text":"Great New fast casual spot. Healthy and fresh and a reasonable price. If you are a fan of seafood this place is for you. 

I went with double tuna, spicy and regular, both were great but I also want to try the salmon and yellowtail. 

Restaurant was clean, being brand new it should be. Line was full but moved quickly. We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"My favorite fast food ever! I can eat here all day everyday! I always do salad with salmon and tuna
And then sweet citrus dressing ( it has least calories) and I put all the toppings there! Yummy ! Highly recommended !"}
{"text":"Ahipoki! My brother and I came here for lunch since we both wanted to try this place, and we're both fans of sushi and this seemed to be a similar concept. We got there around 12 noon and it was fairly busy but with the setup, it moves fast. It did get crowded at the entrance since the line was long so it started to double up and wrap around, it would be good to have more room there. It was easy to order; started with a base of half white rice and half greens regular size. It comes with 2 scoops of seafood, and I chose spicy tuna and shrimp. The shrimp spoonful was pitiful so I wouldn't get it again, though it tasted good. My brother got the large bowl with brown rice and salmon, tuna, and spicy tuna. You choose which sauce you'd like and we both got the house spicy, which was good.

After, you choose your toppings. It was marked clearly on the menu but then when you get to the area you forget what the options are and have to look at all the compartments to figure out what you want. They had edamame, but it wasn't written on their menu, FYI. So I got that, green onions, pickled ginger, cucumber, sprouts and sesame seeds. I also got the seaweed salad but I don't recommend that personally. 

Interesting that they come in to-go boxes and bowls, wonder why they don't do regular bowls but maybe it's to save water? Hope they recycle but I didn't get a chance to see if they had a bin next to the trash.

I enjoyed my food and my Thai iced tea and it is definitely a healthier option than most places. I'd come back if I was in the area."}
{"text":"This place has to be my most favorite \"fast food\" place in town. The quality of the food is perfect for a sushi fix at inexpensive price! Beyond happy with how delicious this place is!"}
{"text":"Love it!  Everything is fresh and glazes were delish.  I had octopus and Tuna with house glazed. Toppings were plenty to choose from.  I wish there was one closer to home.  Can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"This is my second time in two days grabbing ahi salad and rice - it is very busy for a Wednesday night! If I could give this place multiple reviews with five stars I would. I'm addicted."}
{"text":"I do not recommend. It's okay. The customer service was off putting. It's a line where you ask what you want, like chipotle. The woman who first served me seemed impatient, the next woman who asked my sauce seemed like she had an attitude, the next woman who served me was in training and the woman who trained her was my teller and was busy talking to other people while she swiped my card. Overall, just lack of customer service. No interaction and it seemed like I was a nuisance more than I was a customer."}
{"text":"I love this place!  We frequently go here for lunch when we want to get out of the office.  Lines can tend to be a bit long between 11am and 1pm, but it is always worth the wait.  The ingredients are always fresh and the crab salad is so yummy!  My only complaint is that some of the staff skimps a bit even when you tell them you want a lot of some ingredients.  At the same time some of their staff is just great!  Definitely try it with the house spicy!"}
{"text":"Came here a couple times. Such a delicious alternative when you can't go to a sushi restaurant and enjoy some regular rolls!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Ahipoke bowl for some time now but it's not exactly in my neck of my woods so when yesterday when I was in proximity I knew that I was finally my time! 

It reminds me a lot of a chipotle, walk in and start building your own poke bowl! They have a fair amount of protein choices... I went with a half rice, half salad combo with salmon and spicy tuna. Next time I will for sure order another scoop of their protein for $1.75. I topped that bad boy with seaweed salad, onions, avocado, crab mix, seaweed, sesame seed, cucumber, massago, sprouts and creamy spicy mix! Top it off with a drink and it was a ton of food for $12.00!

I really enjoyed my poke bowl and loved that it was price efficient, super filling and it had everything I wanted! I so wish there was one of these joints up in north Scottsdale, I would be there everyday!"}
{"text":"Been a few more times and one thing I've noticed is my bowl is never made the same way. Like, one time I might have the red onions tossed with the seafood and selected sauce, but the next they're just laid raw onto the rice or salad. Other times I get large scoops of seafood and e next it'll be like five pieces that don't even come close to fillin the scoop. It's a staffing and training issue. Seems like they have different staff each time, and the managers are trying to train on the fly. I'll be honest the inconsistency has kind of turned me off to this place. That, and the obvious frustration by staff in taking orders because they haven't been trained well. I still like the food and think it's a unique healthy option, but the staffing problem makes it inconsistent. 

I also noticed the seafood scoops got smaller than right when they opened. Finally, in a place serving fresh and raw seafood seeing a dirty and disorganized back of the house behind the assembly line is disconcerting. I'm willing to look past it but others who have been in line with me have brought it up so they might want to address that too."}
{"text":"This is hands down, one of my favorite places to eat, and has surpassed sushi as my favorite way to eat fish.

My favorite is to get a half/half brown rice and salad base, spicy tuna and scallops and then choose my add-ons depending on my mood.

No matter when I have been, this place has been fresh, quick and reasonably priced.

Did I mention they have macaron ice cream sammies?!"}
{"text":"Came to try out what Johnjay has been raving about on his Instagram with a friend of mine. Got a bowl with spicy tuna and salmon and all the toppings- delicious! Far exceeded my expectations for a fast casual sushi place but the fish looked and tasted fresh! We came back a week later for a second time because we were craving it and I'm sure will be back again soon! The personnel were all friendly and helpful- especially when we came the first time and asked for some help ordering. Definitely would recommend anyone to try it out- for less than $10 it's a satisfying, filling, delicious and fast lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Don't start coming here if you get addicted easily. My newest obsession. Here at least once a week and craving it every other day. Love how you can choose everything you want to go into it. I do half rice half salad with spicy tuna and tuna. Everyone is super friendly every time I come in. 10/10 recommend!"}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!! can't get enough of it and it makes my 30 minutes drive to the closest location I have totally worth it! You guys need to open one in North Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I'm leaving Scottsdale in two days, and now I'm kicking myself. I had four months to hang out at this place and enjoy everything they have.

What a great concept you make your own poke bowl. My eyes were bigger than my stomach I wanted everything I wanted to spicy tuna I'm going to regular tuna I want to do yellowtail I wanted the octopus, I wanted everything. And, that's largely what I did. Personally I wouldn't do it again because I had so many flavors that it became complicated. So I kind of broke it down and I realized if you simplify you have a perfect poke bowl. It's not that I didn't like my ball, I loved it it was great but I wanted to keep it less complex so I recommend just putting on two seafood items. And, the same goes with the vegetable.

This is truly a place I go back to over, and over again. It has a wonderful staff the restaurant was clean and I'm sure the chipotle and smash burger regret that this place ever showed up here."}
{"text":"I am hooked on this place. The food is amazing and the customer service is top notch. I love going here."}
{"text":"Hot days equals cooler food. Ahipoki Bowl came to mind because of all the recent check-ins and reviews. For me, I walked away completely disappointed.

Since my last residence in Hawaii, I thought why not come here because I needed my poke fix. Queue up the \"whomp whomp whomp.\" This place is nothing like what you would find in Hawaii - whatsoever. Even the spelling!

The concept is pick your: size, base, sides, seafood, sauce and toppings. 

I picked a regular portion ($10) = with two scoops of seafood and all the fixings. For my base I chose half salad and brown rice which they put into a clear plastic boxed container compared to a bowl. The brown rice was plain (some places have seasoned sushi rice). What really irritated me was the lack amount of seafood per scoop.The ahi (tuna) were cut smaller than the dice you would find on a craps table. But I was a sucker and still ordered the ahi and salmon. Fresh? Doubtful. None of them are seasoned except when you have them dressed when your order is finally picked out. 

For the sauce, you can select: house (soy sauce based), house spicy, spicy creamy and sweet citrus. I asked for my sauce on the side and when I dipped my salmon in it I almost choked from all the sesame oil floating on top. Wrong ratio of soy sauce to oil. It left a horrible aftertaste in my mouth.

At the end, you can select as many toppings which almost seemed like a filter for the lack of seafood. My dish actually turned into a huge mess with all these ingredients when I just wanted some poke and rice. 

Would I come back? Most likely not unless I want a good dose of veggies. 

It's like that song from Rihanna: \"You needed me. Oooh, you needed me.\" Now I'm shaking my head saying, \"nah, I didn't need you.\""}
{"text":"Our family favorite.  Would love to see a location in North Scottsdale or North Phoenix.  They offer a nice selection of fish, great portion sizes an an abundance of toppings.  They are always proud to offer military discount. The restaurant is simple & clean.  We have returned & will recommend."}
{"text":"Holy crap, this place is amazing.  This is my new go to.  Think Chipotle (and it's right next door), but healthy.  I was super sketched out by the sound of this when a friend told me about it.  I'm not real trusting of anything water oriented here.  Seafood in the desert?  Absolutely not.  I'll do sushi, but at legit places. So when I was told about a poke place, I laughed.  

I went in though and was pleased to see that the staff were checking the temps of the fish sitting out. Okay, cool.  

the concept:  pick a variety of fish (tuna, salmon, etc), then you can pick a base such as white/brown rice, greens, etc. Then you add items such as avadaco, edamame, scallions, crab salad, etc. There are tons.  You can also add a sauce. They have cream based sauces, a house sauce to die for, sweet chili, etc.  they scoop it all up and voila, you have a healthy meal.  It's amazing and VERY reasonable.

I prefer to get the large size (the regular portion is more than enough), but then the longer it sits, the better it  gets . those leftovers have soaked up the sauce and combined into deliciousness.  Love it"}
{"text":"This place is such an awesome concept, the food is great fresh and fast!!! Sushi meets Chipotle!"}
{"text":"Here I am with another updated review that I still freakin LOVE this place!! Everything tastes fresh and delicious every time. I am a frequent visitor of this location and am always pleased with my meal! I like that the toppings switch out sometimes (that new pickled radish is awesome!) but a little disappointed about how expensive it's getting with a raise in price as well as extra charges for avocado, anything more than a tiny scoop of crab salad, etc. I won't let it bring down my rating this time but hoping Ahipoki stays affordable because I'm nooootttttt exactlyyy sure what I'd do without it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! So many options for a healthy seafood meal in a \"Chipotle \" like service style.  Choose the size plate you want and then the base (rice or salad or both),  type of raw fish and them the toppings! Yum! My favorite place in the valley!"}
{"text":"We love this restaurant. We prefer to do takeout as the environment is a bit crazy since their grand opening. The wait hasn't been too bad, but the process of building your bowl can be a little overwhelming for a first-timer. If you're unfamiliar with the setup, it lends to an uncomfortable interaction of trying to order while a) speaking louder than the music and over the plastic barrier, a-la Subway style, and b) trying to determine what the heck the toppings or ingredients are! After ordering once or twice, you'll get the hang of it.

The ingredients always taste fresh and both times we've gone, we've really enjoyed our meals. The prices feel reasonable, too.

My recommendation is to start with the half salad half rice base and go from there."}
{"text":"I'm only giving it a less than perfect score because the employees were a little slow and didn't know much about the different selections, but that's to be expected from the day after they opened. I got a large bowl with brown rice and the marinated tuna, with house sauce and avocado. It was delicious and I will absolutely be returning."}
{"text":"decent sashimi/poki. And super cheap. Will come back"}
{"text":"Coming from Hawaii this is the closest to a poke bowl I can have.  Its not bad pretty good, love the house sauce with a half rice half salad bowl."}
{"text":"I like you can customize your bowl however you want and its nice to habe a light healthy fast-food option. It's a little pricey as far as a fast food restaurant but you definitely get what you pay for. I usually can have one bowl for two meals. My only complaint is that it's awkward to order and the staff can't hear anyone."}
{"text":"I could eat here every day. The people are so friendly and helpful. I get the spicy tuna, octopus, marinaded  tuna. That's right they let you mix the protein. Don't forget to top it off with the fried onions."}
{"text":"Fresh, Fresh & Fresh!  Had the scallops & tuna, with the original sauce, amazing flavor! Avocado was extra but worth it.  Great quality for the price, my new favorite find!"}
{"text":"Love this place for a quick lunch! The food is delicious and portions are large, the only thing I would change is the front entrance. The line gets so long and the entrance is right in the middle of the line making it confusing for first timers and a turn off for those just there for a lunch break. Since I am a seasoned Poki-Goer I know the lines may seem long but they go quickly so I don't mind but I have seen countless people open the door, see the line and opt out because it is very intimidating! But hey, the longer the line, the better the place; right?"}
{"text":"Awsome poki , try it you will love it. It is like Hawaii ,fresh fish and shrimp , small and large bowls"}
{"text":"This place was so good!!!! they're set up is kind of like the chipotle where you get to pick what things you want.  Went there yesterday and I'm hooked! It's super healthy and delicious I def recommend it to any sushi lover. I'm vegetarian and I could still eat here all the time!"}
{"text":"I really like this place & I think it's a really good concept!

I was curious about his place when it opened, but I was also a little skeptical. Adding raw seafood into the mix with a fast, casual dining concept can be iffy, but this place knows how to handle it and everything tastes (and looks...it's all right in front of you when you pick it) fresh. 

Like another reviewer pointed out this place is kind of like a Chipotle. You start with a choice or greens or rice (or you can do both). You can add red onion and/or avocado (for an extra charge...just like at Chipotle) at this step as well. Then you add your seafood. They have about 7 or 8 things to choose from & you can get two scoops or three. I went with a scoop of salmon & a scoop of spicy tuna. Then you add toppings and sauce (things like edamame, bean sprouts, etc...). Everything tasted fresh & yummy.  

It was a little crowded when I came, but they keep things moving along at a pretty quick pace. Two scoop bowls are around $9 and three scoops is $12. The restaurant is clean and there's a lot of seating."}
{"text":"I love the poke salmon bowl!!! The textual of salmon  is so good and I specifically like my poke bowl to go with the garlic soy sauce! Definitely my favorite poke place in Arizona!"}
{"text":"Now you too can be in charge of your own poke destiny... May the fork be with you. 

OK with all the pun and bad joke groaning aside (Can you tell I wrote this on May the 4th?), they do a pretty good job here at making fresh bowls that you build to your liking. It's not quite poke, not quite chirashi. I guess you could call it a unique creation using fresh seafood.

You get your choice of 2 or 3 scoops of seafood (Choices include salmon, tuna, spicy tuna, yellowtail, scallops, shrimp), base filler (White rice, brown rice, salad), any toppings you want (E.g. seaweed salad, pickled ginger, masago), sauce, and any seasonings (Such as sesame seed, red chile flake). 

I got a two scoop with half brown rice half salad, salmon and yellowtail, house spicy sauce, all the toppings, and sesame seed. Everything tasted very fresh, especially the fish. There was too much dressing on the salad unfortunately as the flavor blew my taste buds out from tasting too much salty sauce. Overall I enjoyed my meal though. I also ordered a Thai iced tea which was a perfect amount of sweetness and lightly creamy tasting.

The price for the bowl was $8.95 and the tea was $2.99. I think it was a decent value for your money and I was definitely full after scarfing down my meal. I'll be back to try more custom creations!"}
{"text":"Just can't get enough! I only wish they had a wasabi sauce, I eat here once a week and have never had a dissatisfied bowl."}
{"text":"Used to be really good, but as of lately their fish hasn't been fresh. Last two times I went there, I went home feeling sick. Probably won't be going back. The poke scene is getting bigger in Phoenix now so I'll be taking my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Chipotle style of Poki! I love this place because they have pretty good selections of sides and fishes. For this price, I believe it is better than the 3 stars rating sushi restaurant... I would say better than most of the revolving sushi places in Arizona for sure. 

Only downside is the bowl. It is hard to mix because the bowl is too small."}
{"text":"Delicious, generous portions... place is usually busy, but line moves fast. Great casual lunch spot. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I really dig this concept. Poke makes for a great lunch or dinner that doesn't sit like a rock in your stomach.

Only negative thing i can say about it is when you go to the toppings station, there's no signage to direct you what each container holds. They could use a having sign of what each thing is. I tried asking the staff but they seem uninterested in reading off every ingredient or they can't hear me when i ask, cause i do every time..."}
{"text":"Really good. I am visiting from ca and felt like poke. This place didn't disappoint. I was kinda nervous because we are in the middle of the desert. Not really where you think of when your thinking of good raw fish. However the poke was great and the staff was very friendly"}
{"text":"Fresh raw seafood fast and a good value for your dollars."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE! I've had poké in Hawaii and California, and this is as close as you're going to get in Arizona. The seafood tastes fresh and clean, and I appreciate the assortment of topping options. My favorite combination is a regular size half brown rice and half salad with salmon and luau tuna. I go for all the toppings (seaweed, jicama, masago, etc), but make sure to ask for the wasabi on the side. My husband made the error of confusing a mound of wasabi for a piece of avocado (rookie mistake) and inadvertently cleared his sinuses in a quickness. LOL. They also offer a military discount, which pleases this Army wife. Hooah! 

As far as the fountain drinks, skip the green tea and go for the Thai iced tea. It tastes better.

I wish they would sell mochi for dessert. That would be the perfect sweet ending to my meal. 

I live in Gilbert, and can't wait for the Chandler location to open. I'll use all the money I save on gas to buy more poké bowls! Delicious!!!"}
{"text":"The only reason I'm even giving ahipoke two stars is because what I think was the manager. I have never been before and the only person who has, talked about this place got sick that night, from what I'm assuming, fish sitting too long. I also don't believe everything I hear and I love fish. Today I went in super excited to try a fast pace, healthy restaurant. Its extremely hard to find anything like that in the scottsdale area. 

My friend walked up ordered with the manager, gave us options helped us understand what sauces goes with what fish. Let us try mini samples, seeing some fish we haven't tried raw before. Next was me, I waited for him to come back around, not a big deal the next employee came to help with the line. He looks directly at me and goes on to the next person in line like i didn't even exist... all is fine, everyone has weird days. Then the next employee, I asked if I could try a mini sample, and she looked at me like we don't do that here... ok wait? what happened to my friend getting to try... I never ever post on yelp unless it positive... I have never felt more uncomfortable in my life then when I was leaving. Checking out was even awkward, looked like she didn't even want to be there. I wasn't rude to you, I never even interrupted you when the employees were talking to each other... Why do I get the cold shoulder when I go through the line but my friend have a completely different experience. 

Food was great, manager was so helpful... his employees need help in the customer service department. I feel like I'm hated there and all I wanted was a salad. I have worked in restaurants since I was 16, even at the sandwich shop I worked at we made sure we continued a conversation with customers. Even when we were having a bad day... we would joke about it with customers. I now think you don't like me because I asked you simple questions...which is what I'm assuming you were trained to do. 

I apologize for being rude, but I'm not getting paid to write this...  15 bucks.. I could have spent at a restaurant, tipped someone who wants to see me and needs the money."}
{"text":"Super refreshing choices of fish, both raw and cooked. Lots of toppings to mix and match to create new and different meals. Friendly staff helps you pick the right things if you're not sue. So go here and try it unless you hate seafood or sushi type meals. Steady stream of people at 2 pm on a Saturday."}
{"text":"Thank goodness the line moves quickly because the service is horrendous and unpleasant. The food is delicious and fresh though."}
{"text":"Wow! Let me tell you first off, this requires a open taste. You must like trying new foods, cause I've never had anything like this. I like the way you can pick out buffet style what you want in your bowl, it makes looking at your choices much easier. The flavors mixed are crazy delicious, and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great value great taste and great options. I am glad they are expanding to more locations"}
{"text":"UPDATE:
You can ask for the clear box container which gives you enough space to mix everything up AND they have a blazin sauce right now that helps along with spicy mayo gives it a good kick. Still would love jalapeños for a spicier option but overall I'm satisfied with the food for the price!




Ingredients are fresh but they need a bigger bowl for the large so you can actually mix all the ingredients together. Also it needs a bit more sauce. The man rushed me through so fast I may have ordered wrong. I'll be more specific next time but will be back. Overall good food but could be."}
{"text":"I heard lots of rave reviews and have been excited to try this place out as there aren't any other poke places around. For being in the desert, this place ain't bad. The prices are super reasonable for the portion sizes. Is it the best poke I've ever had? No. The fish didn't seem the freshest and the citrus sauce I got didn't seem to have much flavor. I also wished that they had a few other topping selections. But don't let me stop you from giving them a shot, I've been spoiled with some pretty good poke!"}
{"text":"It's not a sushi bowl.  Just throwing it out there.  Staring at their menu as we drove down, it seemed to have every ingredient you'd find in a sushi roll, and you have no idea how much I love sushi, but it tastes very different.  Not a bad thing, just different.

First off, the rice is warm.  After it fills up most of your bowl, you get two (or three) rather small scoops of your choice of meat (or poke, I believe?), mixed in with their sauce (I chose house spicy, yum!), and toppings.  And though the bowls were small (and a little pricey), I surprisingly wasn't too hungry after.  It was probably the brown rice.

Small portions aside, it was really, really tasty.  You'll have enough sauce to cover your rice, so much so I didn't end up using the soy sauce I grabbed at the cash register.  The meats are delicious, but I know sashimi isn't for everyone, so keep that in mind if you don't like sashimi.  I want to say that they're generous with the toppings, like the wasabi, krab meat, and seaweed, but it's really hard to tell cause I did get a small and all portions seem rather large in comparison.

It being my first time here, I remembered asking a lot of questions, namely, \"what is that\".  And don't get me wrong, I love the lively atmosphere, but having a sign for each meat or topping stuck to the glass definitely would have been helpful, so there would have been less shouting back and forth over the glass.  All in all, quality food - I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! My fiancé and I joke about how we want to go every day because we love it so much. It's so quick and easy and always tastes fresh! We can't stay away for long haha."}
{"text":"I wish I would have thought of this idea first, brilliant!! So so good. My favorite play is 75% lettuce, 25% rice, 1 scoop salmon, 2 scoops marinated ahi, house sauce (with a side of house sauce), edamame, cucumber, seaweed, and 2 scoops of crispy onions. My mouth is watering just writing the review!"}
{"text":"The Dutch brothers of poki bowl restaurants!!! Everyone here is so happy and bubbly and positive every time I've come I leave feeling elevated ...take out or dine-in! Fav is large salad kimchi shrimp and 1 scoop luau tuna house dressing and all the toppings minus the crab and seaweed salad. Ok now I'm hungry lol"}
{"text":"This place is Sashimi-grade \"Chipotle\". I had spicy and luau tuna on my way out Saturday night. The place was clean, and the staff was friendly and fast! We'll definately be coming back."}
{"text":"So excited to find that a place like this existed but even more excited that it surpassed my expectations! There are not many clean eating options to choose,from.We are extra particular because we catch and eat our own fish, skeptical that we can get such fresh fish here in the valley. The fish was fresh & excellent, the rest of the ingredients were also super fresh & delicious. The Wasabi was extra delish. Not only was the food so good, but the service was superb, the restsurant was spotless, great vibe too! We will for sure be regulars!"}
{"text":"Pavlov conditioning is quite the concept. Every time I end up getting albacore instead of yellowtail I would like to bring my pet piranha and put it in the bowl of albacore tuna. Albacore is NOT the same as yellowtail. The different color shades differentiates it quite well. 

Okayyy! Sorry....just...being...you know. So if you still have one finger left, scroll up. 

I do like the concept. Pick and choose your base (white rice, brown rice, salad - option for half/half is my pick). Then choose your fish. I prefer salmon and yellowtail (albacore isn't bad either and neither is piranha ;)). Then you pick your sauce (I'm good with house and the citrus - any as long as the salad is not drenched). Finally, toppings galore!! Make it rain!! - edamame, masago, seaweed salad, sesame seeds, dried seaweed, and maybe jicama and cucumbers! My first bowl was drenched with toppings! 

My first experience here was very nice! The staff members were sweet and helpful, the bowl was filled to the brim, and taste test was approved! Maybe just salmon from now on. 

Go fish!"}
{"text":"Poki! So happy to have tried out this place.
I got the three scoop cuz I read Yuko's review and followed her advice. Half brown rice and half salad. Scoop of spicy tuna, tuna and albacore with house spicy sauce. A little bit of everything. Shake shake Shake in the to go box and dug in. It was delightful!

PRO TIP. Don't get the wasabi in your bowl. You'll never be able to mix it in well enough to not have bouts of panic when you get a chunk of wasabi from bite to bite. ask Bryan S. About his experience with watery eyes and painful nostrils.

It's a bit confusing when you first walk in because it's something new, but just think chipotle and subway. You will be just fine. Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"I typically don't drive out to Scottsdale for sushi, but I would for Ahipoki! The fish is fresh and they even have yellowtail (MY FAVORITE!) as an option. I ordered a salmon and yellowtail half/half bowl with brown rice and salad and they are GENEROUS with these portions! I loaded up on the crab mix, seaweed salad, dried seaweed, and avocado with the house spicy sauce.  The sauce was SUPER oily and it completely drowned my salad but I feel the rice would soak it up just fine. Taste-wise, the sauce was just okay, nothing too special in my opinion, but I do want to try the other flavors. The workers looked a bit tired and wasn't really smiley but with how busy this place got, I'm not surprised. I did get a bit of an eyeroll from a worker when I asked for more seaweed salad which wasn't the coolest but whatever. Overall, a great place to get poke!

PS. Extra $1 for yellowtail and $1 for avocado. If anything costs extra, it will be displayed!"}
{"text":"Just absolutely delicious! I'm pretty sure whatever combination you can think of doing it'll still be amazing. The concept is like a Chipotle but for a poke bowl which is close to a deconstructed sushi roll. The only advice is, top your poke bowl with the fried onion. It gives the meal a nice crunchy texture. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love this place , perfect spot for lunch especially , so easy and quick, food is consistently good."}
{"text":"Recently opened. Surprisingly, the line wasn't that long. I;m a huge fan! I absolutely this place. It's like the chipotle of poke bowls. You pick your rice (brown, white or salad) then fish (I ordered the spicy tuna and salmon) then all your toppings (I like to get everything). Fish was pretty fresh. Decent price and they give you tons of food. I ordered the smaller size and it was the perfect amount."}
{"text":"Ahipoki Bowl is just filled with determination; going up against the progenitor of the concept it has applied to Hawaiian Poke right next door. Conceptually this is spot on; Sushi takes a long time and quality sushi runs me $30 to get full. Here your looking at $9-12 for your choice of sashimi over rice or salad.

I got lost in the menu my first time as what I concocted was pretty random. Spicy tuna, tuna cubes and salmon cubes on top of white rice with some extra shrimp thrown in for good measure.Toppings included onions, seaweed salad, edamame, and diced cucumber. I went with \"spicy creamy\" as my sauce.

When you are dealing with seafood, freshness is key. I was satisfied that nothing in my bowl had that old fishy taste. This place was decently busy so I felt confident nothing had been sitting around for too long. The salmon was probably my favorite, texturally pleasing it was soft and buttery with just the right amount of resistance. Cucumbers and edamame were fresh and having some seaweed salad present reminded me of a classy sushi dinner. The spicy tuna came scooped on and tasted just like the inside of a sushi roll. I would have liked to see this tuna roughly diced rather than what looked to be blended. It still tasted great, but the other perperation just has a better mouthfeel. I was a little surprised that the rice was served warm, but cooked just right.

I'm excited to go back and put a little more thought in to my order, this menu has a lot of potential. At less than $12 out the door the price is just right. I had a hot pocket for lunch and APB filled me up right. Truly a cost effective and endlessly customizable raw fish fueled experience."}
{"text":"Fast service. I really like this concept of healthy fish with either rice or salad. It's like a chipotle but for sushi bowls. The price point is about average. I'll definitely be back. Only 4 stars for the fact that it is so loud in there and you cannot hear what any of the employers are asking you when ordering your food."}
{"text":"Pump it up with some healthy protein!  It's  a bit like unstructured sushi...same components just in a bowl.  Service was awesome!  Fast and super fresh!  It was busy so I knew things are turning over.  I say to check it out!"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time and although the flavors of the bowl were tasty, I had a couple of issues with this place.  First off, one of the options to put in the bowl is the tuna, and everything is set up like a Subway or Chipotle, where you just select the items you want to add. I had planned to get a scoop of tuna, but I noticed there was a long hair in it. I mentioned it to the server and she just picked it out and didn't change out their bin of tuna.  I'm sorry, but that's not OK in my opinion.  I didn't end up getting the tuna. They were busy, but I don't think that's any reason to keep serving tuna that had a long hair in it. The server was not the friendliest either, she seemed annoyed that I even mentioned the hair.  My husband and I decided to still finish ordering, just not get the tuna.  Then we moved on to the other options that you can add, and I mentioned to the man who appeared to be the owner/manager, that it was my first time, and asked what he recommended to go with the salmon, octopus that I had chosen to get, he was very dry and just responded \"whatever you want.\"  Again, not impressed.  So we paid and sat down to enjoy our bowls.  I took a couple of bites and I found a fish bone, it poked me as I took my bite.  I've almost chocked on fish bones, so I actually got a little nervous when I realized what was in my mouth.  Like I said earlier, the flavors of the food were tasty, and I was really hungry, so I decided to just keep eating hoping it was just a fluke.  A couple bites later and another fish bone.  Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be going back.  I was disappointed with my experience."}
{"text":"This place. This place is just amazing. It's quality and the taste is superb. Get the tuna luau!"}
{"text":"3 words ; I love it, what's not to love about ahipoke located in a nice plaza in south Scottsdale. When you walk in the menu is huge so
you can't complain it's pretty simple! You have 2 sizes the regular bowl, and then a plate/platter which includes 3 or more scoops of tuna or fish. You choose the base afterwards which is rice/ white or brown and or salad you can of course have the option of half and half! Then choose your protein which is tuna, spicy tuna etc. I got the spicy tuna cause I love spicy and it was really rich in flavor. I got the spicy creamy which is like a chipotle/siriacha or something spicy creamy mayo sauce which is definitely really good. Then there's toppings like avocado which is of course a good choice but 1.00 which isn't bad at all onions, chili peppers, crab stuffing, edamame list goes on. Staff is cheery and friendly and looks like they know what they're doing. The interior is very street vibes but very west coast of course! I also recommend their thai tea it wasn't that sweet it was just right! Definitley will be my go to spot for some poki i mean why not!"}
{"text":"Ahipoki bowls are trendy.. fresh healthy food option during our hot summer days.. 

I like to start with 1/2 salad greens and 1/2 brown rice for added flavor and health options.. always get the spicy tuna and whatever else catches my eye today the luau tuna (other options octopus, shrimp, salmon, etc).. I add masago, crab salad,seaweed salad and load up with sides.. add sauce and sprinkle dry seaweed to finish 

Some of the add one are extra so pay attention when ordering.. they are pretty good about letting you know but your $9.99 double scoop can end up being $14 if you're not careful .. i love avocado but it's an additional $1.50/scoop .. 

Today my salad was way overdressed .. luckily the brown rice helped off set that sweetness.. maybe because it was 1/2 salad and they gave me a full salad pour?

This location always delivers tasty fresh food, plenty of seating and parking, staff is always friendly and helpful (they don't rush you through the line).."}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try Poki forever and I finally had a chance to try it. I went here on a Monday evening and it wasn't that packed yet. 

It is set up chipotle style when ordering and it was very simple to understand. I got the regular bowl which was $8.95 and came to 2 scoops. I got white rice and organic salad, ahi tuna and Maui tuna, ginger, seaweed salad, sesame seeds, avocado, cucumbers, red onions, and the house sauce. With all that, the regular was more than enough. 

I took my first bite.....HOLY DELICIOUSNESS!! Where has this been all my life? Why have Hawaiians been holding out on me for so long!? It was FREAKING delish! Needless to say, but I DEVOURED the entire bowl. It was full of authentic flavors that meshed together very well. The fish was tender and fresh. Everything was just perfect. 

If you don't live near this place, it is definitely worth the drive. I will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I got HORRIBLE food poisoning here. I had the salmon tuna and shrimp bowl. I ate there for two nights in a row and got food poisoning on the second night. They do NOT keep the raw fish cold enough and let it stay out too warm. I got night chills and sweats, lightheadedness, dizziness, lots and LOTS of diarrhea, dehydration, and incredible fatigue. I will NEVER come here again!!!"}
{"text":"(Lyrics - Ginuwine - Pony)

I'm just a Yelper
Looking for some good eats
Someplace who knows what to serve
Without any compromise

Gotta be scrumptious
Takes me to my limits
Oh when I take a bite
I promise that you'll want a Bo Bites song

If you're hungry, lets do it, taste it, my poke

If you're hungry, lets do it, taste it, my poke

Poke bowl is a Japanese Hawaiian fusion dish where raw seafood is served atop a bed of rice or salad.  It is then topped with exotic ingredients such as daikon roots, edamame, and jicama.  Drizzled with their specially made house sauce that Ahipoki Bowl provides; make this a great one stop fresh pop in your mouth shop!

You have options of choosing between white rice, brown rice, or a salad base.  You can also do a combo of either of the 3.  For a large bowl you get 3 scoops of the raw protein.  I shot for the spicy tuna, salmon, and octopus topped with jicama, edamame, daikon roots, dried seaweed, and sesame seeds.  For the sauce I ordered their house spicy sauce.  

Overall, a solid bite of texture, but you definitely needed to add those specific toppings I added to make it work.  As for the rice it was a tad bit dry but my salad help give it some moisture along with the spicy sauce which was very welcoming since it brought out the flavors and meshing well with the raw proteins.

The popularity of made to order meals where your ingredients are being stacked in your bowl is definitely something that gives you a feel that you're eating something healthy.  Customizing your meals is cool, but I'm generally a guy that likes what the chef think is best; granted its not to say I don't appreciate this place.  In the end, it was fun and I can't wait to play with my food as I plan to continue to come back! - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious!!  If I lived closer to this place I would eat here 24/7.  Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Genius concept. The fish is nice and fresh and the available toppings compliment the meat well. The menu has a good variety of options to suite everyone! I will most definitely be making this a regular thing to come in on Saturdays!!"}
{"text":"This place is good worth the stop in for a quick poke fix. We stop here when we pass thru the area on the way home from a long trip."}
{"text":"I looked at my credit card statement and I have spent over 1,000$ at this place, so that must say something. I have been to many poke bowl places but this will never ever disappoint me. Hands down the best poke bowl, my favorite is a salad with 4 scoops of octopus . I think the employees know me because I come in almost everyday after the gym. I want to say today I had poke bowl and something went wrong with my bowl where the sauce was too much , I asked the employees if there was something I could do with my bowls and I think his name was Kevin the manager and he kindly re did both of my bowls. I am in the food industry and I hate sending back food , but they didn't take it away so my brother took the salty bowls home because he thought we were crazy. In my mother and my situation we got our new bowls with sauce on the side and now that is our new favorite way to eat them. Bottom line is that I learned a new way to eat my bowl and have the most respect for Ahi Pokes customer service . My whole family loves it. I will remain a customer of Ahi Poke Bowl for forever ."}
{"text":"I'm from a part of California were poke is all around me. Growing up in a Japanese home I'm all around fish, rice and any other thing people would consider Asian.
It's was good. All the food that needed to be fresh was. The place was clean...floors, tables, work areas and windows.
Service was fast yet polite.
Can't say I'll ever be back cause I'm just passing through but if I lived in Tempe, sure."}
{"text":"I think all you can order here are the poke bowls.  I'm not adventurous with most fish, but I order my bowl with spicy tuna, scallops and shrimp.  Rice only with avocado and the other various fixings.  It's delicious and a quick, affordable, different option for lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"I ordered ahi bowls to go from here. Two scoops of spicy tuna and one regular tuna. I thought the spicy was much better, more flavorful. 3 scoops was too much for me but would be perfect if you are really hungry. I didn't like the house sauce but I liked the spicy creamy sauce. It reminds me of a chipotle but for poke bowls. Love it. Quick and easy."}
{"text":"Best fast food that I have had since I tasted chipotle for the first time! Amazing! I will definitely be back for many times to come!"}
{"text":"I ate here with friends yesterday and it was really good! The salmon tasted fresh and the spicy tuna wasn't too spicy. I've never had Ahipoke before but I love raw seafood so this was a great idea to try! I will definitely be coming back here again. Totally reasonable too!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Tempe location and they were super cheap with their portion so I decided to give this location a shot today. Super small portions here too. I ordered the large bowl that only comes with 3 scoops (other poke shops give you 4 scoops for a large) because the only other size they have comes with 2 scoops. They're veryyy cheap on the scoops and toppings (cheaper than chipotle believe it or not!). Put a tiny scoop of crab mix and when I asked for another scoop I was told it's an additional 75 cents per scoop for toppings. My large bowl with no additional scoops of anything came out to $12.41. I gave it a 3 star because it does taste good, but very pricy for what you get. There are better poke spots out there that taste just as good if not better and give you reasonable portions."}
{"text":"Really love all the fresh ingredients and the flavors. The salmon is always good and melts in your mouth. Pretty much am in love with this place and could eat here everyday."}
{"text":"Fresh and tasty. I love the concept of this place. The layout of the restaurant itself is awkward. You are stuck waiting by the door to get your food and when there is a long line there is no place to wait. Other than that it was great and I will be back."}
{"text":"Yea, so I only give five star reviews. So what! At least you know when you read my reviews you know you are reading about something worth five of those lil suckers vs something not worth taking a bite of. Get me?

Anyways... this place is screaming eat me! Ot is so freaking amazing I can't even believe it! Like I stated in my Ahipoki bowl pic I posted 5 months back \"this place is place puts everything awesome about sushi into a bowl\" -me. Or something like that  anyways.... It is everything awesome about sushi without the hangover and explanation to your boss the next day about why you are late or not coming in. Its everything awesome about sushi except for the high price at the restaurant and long wait. Get in there. Stand in line and fill that bowl up with your fav sushi fillings. It is so badass!"}
{"text":"Ahipoki Bowl has been open for a little over a week and has been popping up on my social media. With it being the first \"Poke\" fast-casual spot in Arizona, it's safe to say they've drawn major attention without having to advertise too much!

I love poke and am used to the Chipotle-fast-cas style of ordering so had no issues with ordering here. I decided on a half salad and half brown rice with their marinated ahi and salmon with all the toppings minus red onions. For sauce I went with the House Spicy as it was recommended. The sauce is used to toss the salad and was a great spicy, savory, soy dressing a tad bit heavy. The toppings include everything from sesame seed, seaweed, edamame, imitation crab, sprouts and jicama. Also they need to work on how to cut their sprouts as many still had their seeds/rootlings still attached to the bottom of it.  As for the fish quality, the salmon was fresh and so tender and the marinated Ahi tasted fine and had bits of jicama for a textural crunch. $1 add on for avocado, yes of course! 

For drinks, I was able to sample the three available and enjoyed the Thai Tea the best. Unusual choice for a \"Japanese/Hawaiian\" type of spot, but it was good and not too sweet which I liked. The price point here is awesome, less than $10 for a Regular size which is more than enough for one person. The atmosphere is comfy and the staff was authentically nice and was able to talk to them about other Poke places located in CA.

Though it's pretty new, the only con I would have to say is that their portion size is very unproportional.There should be an equivalent amount of poke or close to 2/3 to that of the rice or salad. I had only 1/4 of my box filled with fish, which seemed like I was paying $9 for rice and salad. If they could change the portion here I would say it'd be worth my while to come back again. Also, not a huge fan of having my poke in a flat, square take out box. I mean it's called a Poki Bowl for a reason, right?"}
{"text":"I have only ever been here during lunch and on week days. They are speedy but there is always a line. Expect a 15 to 20 minute time frame from
walking in to walking out with your food. 

I found this gem on Yelp and have been back at least once a week since with friends also! I always ask for extra sauce they seem to not give enough if you don't. I always get the rice bowls. I have never tied the salads but friends have and said they will amazing. 

Strongly recommend you give this place a shot!"}
{"text":"I had looked forward to eating here since I heard about it, and I wasn't disappointed!  A lot of reviews mention being surprised by up charges for yellowtail and avocado- that is now well marked on the menu board.

I got a regular bowl with half brown rice, half salad, avocado, 1 scoop tuna, 1 scoop salmon, house saice, ginger, edamame, cucumber, seaweed salad, roasted seaweed, crispy onions, and sesame seeds. The base and seafood were great and the house sauce was nice and light. I didn't like the seaweed salad and ended up not eating most of it. The rest rest of the toppings were great, especially the roasted seaweed and the ginger.

My husband got the same base, spicy sauce, 2 scoops of spicy tuna, which is minced instead of cubed. He got all the toppings, which he said ended up being too much flavors mixed together. However, he agreed that quality was all really good. We look forward to going back. This is a great spot for lunch in the summer in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Meant to hit up this joint in Hollywood never did but this spot here is on point and they got rid of that odd smell that was always present at the old Ahi-Mahi grill 

The large bowl half/half with three scoops of fish and a scoop of crab with all the fixings is enough to feed you three times, not even exaggerating lol. Got salmon, yellowtail, and spicy tuna and all three were fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Very solid poke joint, lots of options for toppings and good pricing and portion size."}
{"text":"I tried a poke bowl here with the spicy tuna and albacore. They bowl tasted great, but the portions for their fish were small compared to the portions for the vegetables. Additionally, some friends of mine got the octopus, which didn't taste as fresh. Spicy tuna seems to be the way to go. Overall, it was a good meal, despite a few drawbacks."}
{"text":"I've had poke bowls in California and I was afraid these wouldn't taste as good, but I was wrong! The poke bowls here are pretty good, just a little expensive for the portion."}
{"text":"Came here on a whim, and was thoroughly pleased with all the options! There are so many ways to put different flavors in that you could have something completely different for a few weeks even if coming here every day. Its like a build your own sushi, but way easier to eat in a bowl! Beware coming during the lunch rush though, the line can take awhile, so if you are in a rush to get your food and run this may be an issue. If you have the time though, it is worth the wait in line! The spicy creamy sauce is so good!"}
{"text":"Really yummy, great portion, and friendly service. Got a large bowl for dinner and I'm stuffed! Definitely recommend trying this place"}
{"text":"I still love this place but will not be visiting quite as often since they raised their prices. I feel like it's too pricey now."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Trying to get on board with this place but don't quite understand the rave reviews.

This is like no poke that I've ever had, and not in a good way.  Where the best poke relies on fresh fish marinated in its sauce with flavors typically more complex than just soy sauce (see Ono Seafood review if you want), this place misses the mark.  It is poke, to some extent.  But if you're calling it poke, it was one of the most underwhelming pokes I've had.

It's not bad, at all.  Otherwise it'd get less than three stars.  The fish seems quite fresh, as do the rest of the the ingredients.  It's the execution and end-product.

Got a salad base, spicy tuna, yellowtail, house sauce.  Maybe I'll ask to reduce the amount of sauce, or perhaps try a rice base, but it was overly salty.  Way too salty.  So much so, that mixing it with the yellowtail, killed the flavor of the yellowtail.  The spicy tuna was pretty far from spicy.  The marginal kick in it also couldn't overcome the saltiness of the house sauce.

I do appreciate the toppings that include masago and seaweed salad.  They definitely add value to the bowl.  But mix it all up (or eating each separate component together) and I end up with a glorified salad - not a poke dish.  

They also serve Brick macaron ice cream sandwiches.  Ordered the green tea flavor.  This isn't on Ahipoki since it's not their product, but I'll have to try it again before I give it a ringing endorsement.  First, let it thaw a little.  It is, literally, a brick when it comes out of the freezer.  The texture of the macaron was actually pretty good, had the chewiness that you would expect with a crisp outer layer.  The green tea ice cream lacked green tea flavor.  A lot of it.  Willing to give these guys another try since I love macarons, and ice cream, and ice cream sandwiches.

So this place is not bad.  It is meh.  For poke lovers, don't expect poke.  Just expect a salad or a rice bowl with good, fresh, fish on it."}
{"text":"Great food, fast service and friendly staff!
I ordered the spicy tuna and regular tuna, they both tasted very fresh and well seasoned!"}
{"text":"Aright I must say..... I'm from California and have very high standards for my poke bowls. I must swallow my poke snobbish outlook that all seafood eaten not by the ocean is bad. They've done it at AhiPoki Bowl. It's fresh, the tuna is PINK (which is how it should be!!), and the topping options are just what people look for in a poke bowl. The Tuna Luna and the plain Tuna mix well together in the bowl, but I can't wait to try the other fish options they offer! They ONLY thing I have to complain about is that when I asked for a poke bowl I didn't know there was a small and a large options and the employee didn't enlighten me on that option and just gave me a small. The small is perfect for a light lunch but I was feelin a pretty hefty dinner at the moment and wish I got the option explained to me so I could chose the larger one. Safe to say I'm coming back here again, and again, and again! (WAY better than Diego Pops sad excuse for a Poke Bowl)"}
{"text":"This place is the best!  Sushi quality ingredients, but much more of a meal than your typical sushi stop (better price as well).  I've been eating here so often I had to look up mercury levels in fish to make sure I'm not overdoing it!"}
{"text":"OMG AHIPOKI BOWL. I wish I could eat here every meal of every day, but the boyfriend puts up with it enough as it is. For an Asian food and seafood lover who has struggled to find fresh tasting flavors in Scottsdale, this place is a godsend. I get nearly everything in my tuna and kimchi shrimp bowl, and it's good down to the last bite. I also really enjoy the Thai iced tea- definitely a refreshing beverage to wash down the seaweedy-fish goodness you're sure to love!"}
{"text":"One of our models mentioned this place to us and it is amazing! Great concept with fresh ingredients and generous portions and fair prices. If you're a fan of sushi or fish, in general, you definitely have to check this place out, but most importantly for us, it's near our office so we can eat here or take out often."}
{"text":"Easily my favorite go-to spot for a quick and healthy dinner. Everything is always fresh tastes amazing."}
{"text":"Basically sushi in a bowl!! Delicious, fresh and generally served with a smile (my first time there the guy seasoning the fish was a little crusty). If you go, make sure you fill out a card to get on their email list... you get 50% off your next order. My partner and I went back for our second visit and paid like $12.00 for our whole meal. I need more locations stat!!!"}
{"text":"I am so glad I gave this place another shot! My bowl was double the size it was the first time, making it totally worth the money. What on earth was the person doing the first time around I wonder!"}
{"text":"Two days post-Thanksgiving, my body was struggling to adjust from holiday mega-carb feasting. I've only had a poke bowl once before, but after a nearby hike, I was craving something light and healthy. There were a lot of choices, and it's done in an assembly-line fashion, but I provided the staff my preferences and deferred to their suggestions. I was not disappointed. 

When I'd had poke before, it was simple... just sesame tuna and rice. So I was a little concerned with the complex and distinct flavors (I got 2 different tunas and shrimp), as well as the add-on sauce and extra additions available to throw on, overwhelming each other making it a distasteful mess. However, they scoop it in sections in your bowl, so you can avoid a mish-mash, unless you choose to do so yourself. I got a custom spicy sauce and topped it with the Furikake flakes, a mixture of dried fish and seaweed...I know, it's better than it sounds. Everything I got was good on its own and even mixed together. My only complaint, and it's not Ahipoki's problem, is that eating light and healthy, makes me crave a cheeseburger two hours later. hahaha"}
{"text":"Ok so I gave couple months before I returned to give it another try. They definitely have improved the quality and service. Although the staff seem to have frozen faces and never seen them smile, the line moves much faster. I've been coming back regularly since. I would give it 5 stars once they improve the green tea drink."}
{"text":"Ahipoki in general has great poke and the quality is fine. I did notice that the spicy tuna at this location was kind of off... it wasn't really spicy at all. I am usually a pretty generous yelper but I could not get myself to give more than 3 stars. The reason why I am rating this particular location so low is because of the service. The staff was so outwardly uninterested in their work and did not even bother to greet customers. While I do not expect top notch service from a chain, a simple \"hello\" would've been nice. I had to repeat myself several times despite how quiet the place was when I went. With so many poke places opening up, I don't think I'll return to this location."}
{"text":"Poke!! Once you start, you will probably crave it... Often!!! 

I have been a handful of times and the service has been pretty good/consistent. The portions are good, but I did find myself realizing if I ask for 2 scoops of salmon, it's not as much as if I ask for a scoop of salmon and then another scoop (think chipotle double meat, haha). 

The $1 avocado kinda sucks, but it is what it is....

I took my parents (it was their first time eating raw fish) and the manager was friendly and allowed them to try the various fish types. They also made an error and kindly fixed it. 

Definitely plan on being back frequently!"}
{"text":"I'm so happy I found this place. I drive 40 minutes just to get a poki bowl. My kids love it too. I also like the macaroon cookies and to have a Thai tea. I wish they would open more locations."}
{"text":"An amazing location with some very interesting choices. Very affordable and you get the great value for your money. It's like a combo of chipotle and a great sushi place! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Fresh fish and everything is delicious. House spicy is the way to go. The ceviche was awesome. Staff is really great here."}
{"text":"This place is seriously outstanding. This is easily my favorite place to eat near campus. Everything I have there is amazing, including every meat, every topping and every sauce combination. The staff is friendly and the drinks are good too. They are a little pricey but really you're getting an entire meal of sushi basically, so it's very worth it. Also if you can get your hands on a Student Insider Coupon book they have buy one get one free coupons within."}
{"text":"Came here this past weekend and was not disappointed. I ordered the spicy tuna and salmon bowl on rice. I ordered brown rice but received white - not a huge issue. I also got the spicy creamy sauce which was good but not very spicy. They are also heavy handed with the sauce. All in all very good. I'm a huge poke fan and I am looking forward for their Chandler location to open up. Oh and if the had some furikake as a topping, that would be fantastic."}
{"text":"My favorite! It's like chipotle for sushi! They are always friendly, helpful when I first came in and decently priced for the amount of food they give you!"}
{"text":"It's DELICIOUS - a little over priced for the little bit of fish you get. The atmosphere is clean but it is a little loud when everyone shows up for lunch. 

I'm docking a star because I always seem to get the wrong toppings when I speak loudly and clearly when a specific employee works that station.  I watched the customer in front of me get the wrong toppings... I then received the wrong toppings and then heard the guy behind me get the wrong toppings. A little comical, but docking a point for lack of operational training I suppose."}
{"text":"Yum!!! It's like a Japanese chipotle. You can pick the type of sashimi/fish you want, rice, veggies and sushi toppings. They are pretty generous with their portion sizes too. Everything is super fresh too!"}
{"text":"Although I have had better Poke Bowls this one was pretty yummy! The fish was fresh and they gave a generous amount per bowl, however I would like it to be a bit more spicy personally. I had the house spicy sauce and it really wasn't that spicy even after I added wasabi. I loved all the topping options though and the worker was very patient with me while  I added pretty much a little of everything! I would have loved some fresh jalapeños to top it off, I have had them at other restaurants with a the same build your own poke bowl style and loved them. For how full we were after the price really wasn't bad! 

Will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Ahipoki Bowl. I eat here almost once a week! It never gets old! All the ingredients are delicious and fresh. Is you enjoy a good poki bowl come here! And if you have never tried one before this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try this phenomenon that's been hitting the US called a poke bowl and, seeing as I was in the neighborhood, I thought I'd swing by this restaurant. 
Lots of available parking and very easy to find.  Located at the corner of N Scottsdale Road & E Thomas Road, in the same area as Albertsons grocery.
Staff weren't welcoming, and thankfully, one staff member was friendly enough to assist in choices and options.  Do note, if they offer you avocado, be aware that it's an extra charge.  They neglected to inform me of this though not an issue. 
There's two options - regular (2 scoops) and the large (3 scoops).  Upon entering, there's a nicely designed pictograph of how to build your poke bowl   There were also lots available menus on the counter tops to assist you further with your choices.
I ordered the large with 3 scoops - tuna, salmon, and kimchi shrimp with the rice, and the house blend sauce plus I told them to hit me with all he ingredients.  That might've been a bad choice on my end when my tastebuds came in contact with the wasabi paste! 
The bowl along with its many ingredients tasted great, and granted, I have never had raw fish before.  I think with the various sauces and added ingredients, it certainly does make consuming the fish easier, at least for me. 
I do hope they think of opening a franchise in the West Valley as I would certainly be patronizing them.  If I am in Scottsdale again and have a hankering for a poke bowl again, I would certainly visit this joint again!"}
{"text":"This is a place I visit every time I'm in the Phoenix area. The portions are very large for the price and the options are great. Well done Ahipoki!"}
{"text":"I ordered a 3 scoop with all of the extras on it. 
My three scoops according to some friend's advice: Marinated Tuna, Salmon, Octopus. All were good choices because you could noticeably taste the fish. I wish I chose something else besides octopus. 
Some people didn't like the spicy tuna because it wasn't very flavorful. I tasted some from my friend's plate and agreed. The cubed fish pieces are much more attractive and it feels more satisfying. 
I had brown rice and salad (half and half) though I think if you like white rice go for it. It probably absorbs much more of the flavor. 
While getting every sauce and every topping, some things get clouded into obscurity and some things shine.
Here's the menu for reference.

Things I've noticed:
The Spicy Creamy - Very good spicy sauce that gives a great mouthfeel to the dish
The House Sauce - Standard sweet soy sauce. It's pretty good.
The minced crab - It's a nice texture but I would debate if it was worth the added $0.75 cents
The seaweed salad (highly recommended) - Gives a unique, fresh and slimy texture found in tradititonal poke (according to my friend). 
The crunchy onions - Gives a great texture if you're into fried stuff on salads.
The avocado - I'd say it's the equivalent of adding avocado to your Chiptole burrito. It's nice but not necessary. 
The Ginger (gari) - Noticeable due to the acidic and ginery taste. I love eating gari in sushi. If you don't eat gari, don't get this.

Things I regret noticing:
Wasabi -When you mix stuff up and take a big biute of wasabi, your head starts to hurt. I would honestly ask this on the side.
Jicama - Like water chestnuts but a bit more pair like. I don't like water chestnuts because they're flavorless and ruin a dish ment to have a soft texture. Almost the same with kicama. If you like texture in your dish, get it. If not  then stay away.
Masago - the little roe stuff was unnoticeable in my mound of stuff. If you like it, order it. If you don't care for it, don't. 

Things I didn't care for:
Cucumber - It's good filler at least
Daikon Sprouts - It's also good filler at least
Green Onion - Why not?
Roasted Seaweed - apparently it's tradition but I couldn't taste it. Better with less flavors probably.
The Citrus Sauce - Good but overshadowed by too much toppings. Probably best to eat alone
Chili flakes - Not significant. But at least there's siracha near by.

A bowl (two scoops) is about $8.00 and a box (three scoops) is $10.50. There are certain items that are extra and I would honestly only recommend the seaweed salad as the extra ($0.75). 
My total dish with EVERYTHING was about $13.00s so that's a good range to think about.

Poke is getting popular and it's very advantageous for a place like this around Phoenix at this time. If you want something healthy and fresh and are willing to spend a little more on quality, Ahi Poke is for you."}
{"text":"I got a brown rice bowl with kimchi shrimp, ahi tuna and spicy tuna with all the fixins and I thought it tasted really good. I would definitely go back :)"}
{"text":"This place is great. Nice selection of seafood & the Thai tea was amazing too!! The staff was friendly and explained the menu since it was our first time here."}
{"text":"Raw fish in Phoenix can be a little questionable at times, however this place did not disappoint. I have never had a poke bowl before so I don't have much to compare it too, however the concept mirrors chipotle and i was in and out in 5 minutes with a healthy delicious bowl of seafood and veggies. They are a little stingy on the veggies but don't be afraid to ask for more. I live right across the street and after tonight me and my roomies are sold on this place, so much so that I plan to get it for lunch tommarow. Poke on!"}
{"text":"I'm sure this place needs no introduction. It's always busy (in a good way). Their food is always fresh, place is always clean, and the price is just right. If you are one of the rare ones that hasn't been here yet. You are definitely missing out."}
{"text":"Liked:
-cool new concept 
-fast and convenient 
-reasonably priced

Disliked:
-the fish to salad/rice portion is kinda off
-fish in my opinion was not that fresh (but hey we are in a desert)
-employees didn't seem super friendly

I think I was expecting more because I was hyped up on the fact that a new poki place opened down the street. 

Next time I will order a small rice bowl and get double scoops of fish. I hear that's the trick!"}
{"text":"Order from here through Postmates all the time. Never have any issues the food is amazing and by far one of my favorite delivery spots."}
{"text":"Wow my salad really hit the spot!

I got the tuna, tuna luau, and salmon organic salad bowl all for $10.75

The large bowl comes with 3 meats and the regular is $8.75 for 2 meats.

I tried the house spicy and spicy creamy and it was really good!

I added seaweed, crab meat, fish eggs, the garlic pieces, peppers, and sesame seeds. 

This is my new happy spot!"}
{"text":"When first entering I was surprised with a great upbeat environment! Music was energetic and the staff's personality related equally. Anthony walked me through the experience with great detail making me both excited and ready for the adventure! The fish was fresh and the ingredients blended together with great detail to flavor! I was currently visiting a friend and they told me how amazing it was. This may have been my first time but won't be my last that I assure you!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Fast, affordable, heathy.  I got the salad/brown rice combo with tuna & salmon, house sauce, added in onions, cucumbers and crab meat on my last visit.  So good.  Friendly, helpful service and a nice environment to boot.  Give it a try."}
{"text":"We went during their grand opening this weekend as it was a 50% off deal. The line was exceptionally long but that's a good sign, right? After about 20 minutes in line, we were greeted by the super busy staff/assembly line and they were pleasant yet efficient. I ordered the regular with brown rice + 2 scoops of spicy tuna and octopus tossed in the citrus sweet sauce with crab salad, seaweed salad, cucumber, jicama, edamame, crispy onion and red onion sprinkled with sesame seeds. Such vibrant colors and flavors! My date ordered the large with brown rice with 3 scoops of regular tuna, salmon and octopus with all of the toppings + house spicy sauce (+roe, wasabi, ginger, chili peppers) minus the avocado/crab salad since it was $1/each extra. His tuna was in larger chunks and he said that was his favorite protein in the bowl. The place was pretty packed but we sat at the window in the corner which was fine by me as there were traffic jams through the restaurant. For AZ standards this is very tasty seafood and the best part was that our total bill was $10.62. Great taste and prices and if we are ever around in Scottsdale this will be a main contender for a quick and cheap pit stop."}
{"text":"So excited to have found this place! Took my teenager tonight. We both had a great experience. Fresh tasting ingredients for our bowls (hamachi, tuna, salmon) mine was spicy his house sauce. Lots of choices to add to fish (ginger, edamame, wasabi, seafood salad, crab salad, crunchy onions, jicama, cucumber, seaweed, sesame seeds, green onion, masago .... and choice of salad, white rice or brown rice) SO GOOD! Clean food at a reasonable price. I will be back!
My son also loved the macaron ice cream sandwich..... Decadent. Iced green tea for me and juice for E. Nothing disappointed.  I was envying CA for their poke burritos in seaweed wrappers, but this cured me!!!"}
{"text":"Great food but not family friendly- bathrooms don't have changing stations- they can be added for $200 or less."}
{"text":"I've been to this place so many different times and am always satisfied! I typically get the brown rice large bowl with 2 scoops of salmon mixed in house spicy sauce and a scoop of the tuna luau. I also like getting half brown rice and half salad instead of all brown rice."}
{"text":"Fast service even on opening weekend. The fish was fresh and the prices are reasonable.  I liked most of the accompaniments.  They overcharged us but I will let that slide since they are still trying to iron out their process."}
{"text":"I would give them overall a 4.5 stars. 
I was beyond excited to see they opened a Pokè place here in AZ! It's a great setup. Like others have described it, Chipotle style but with Pokè. My husband described it basically as a deconstructed sushi rolls. I ordered the large bowl with salad. Spicy tuna, tuna luau and salmon with all the toppings. He ordered shrimp and Tuna with rice and some toppings. 
We spoke with a guy that worked there and said they're looking into opening other locations. Hopefully towards the East Valley!"}
{"text":"I always come here with my family! They love it here! It's like a chipotle for sushi. 

I always get the half & half (salad & rice), with tuna, salmon and house sauce! 

I see they just added the macaron ice cream sandwiches now! I haven't tried them yet but I will the next time I come in."}
{"text":"I have been a huge fan of ahipoke since they opened the first one in Scottsdale. I would say the food is great but they need to improve their customer service at the Tempe location."}
{"text":"Incredibly friendly staff is always happy to recommend or explain things. Bursting with flavor & freshness, I absolutely love Ahipoki Bowl.  Quick & so much bang for your back. Great ambiance too, I love the booths, decor, and there seems to be a good playlist on whenever I go in.  2 minutes away from work, I'll definitely be a regular here!"}
{"text":"Oh my word! I've never been \"poked\" before. Visiting Scottsdale and I am delighted with the amount of food choices here.
When I walked in, it was busy and a bit overwhelming trying to figure out \"how\" you build your bowl or what to put in it (It's a Chipotle style ordering system). 
I had a small bowl which included tuna and salmon with red onions, avocado, house sauce, sesame seeds and massage. It was amazing. 

I CANNOT wait to go back and try other things! I will crave this food! A good value for the price too, the fish was fresh and yummy! 

PS- there is a sign that they do NOT recommend \"to go\" orders during the summer due to temperatures. Keep that in mind if its a warm day!"}
{"text":"Was in the mood for something healthy and fresh and had heard rave reviews about this place from friends and fellow yelpers. Turns out the hype is legit! This place is awesome. I had a half&half bowl with tuna, salmon and yellowtail. The fish tasted fresh and flavorful. I got sweet citrus sauce, which goes perfect with the salad. The selection of toppings is great. The place was busy when I came in, but they move the line quick. The staff is all friendly. The dining room was clean and I liked the decor. Definitely coming back here soon"}
{"text":"Super surprised how much I enjoyed eating here. Clean, sweet service, and since it was our first time we were given recommendations. I had a bowl with two kinds of tuna (not spicy) and the house sauce, with LOTS of yummy fixings. We also finished with an ice cream macaroon each. I had green tea and he has mango. I can't wait to go back and try more stuff."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so delicious!! If you love great customer service and wonderful flavors come here! If you want something priced so cheap for a taste so wonderful!"}
{"text":"First visit there today with my son and we both loved it!  Everything was fresh and the flavors were wonderful.  We both will be back!"}
{"text":"I am OBSESSED with Ahipoki Bowl! Sushi is one of my favorite foods, and now that you can make it into a bowl or salad makes me so happy!

The service is amazing and very quick. They greeted me when I walked in and helped me figure out what to order since it was my first time going! I got the spicy tuna, crab mix and shrimp with half rice and half salad. I also got the spicy mayo sauce which completed my meal! 

After my first time I have already gone back twice within two weeks! (You could say this is my new favorite restaurant). I will definitely continue going because it is so delicious!"}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised by this place! It's a Chipotle style fast casual concept -- build your own poke bowl. Yummy, nice quality fish, lots of options, and reasonably priced. I predict we'll be back here quite a bit!"}
{"text":"We were stoked about trying this place out, and I'm pretty sure this place was packed because of the novelty and hype of being the 1st poke-centered place in Phx, (because man, were they packed! ) but not a single one of my group of 8 was impressed enough to rave about what we had. Super sad face! The fish was fresh, which I guess is the most we can ask for being out here, but it truly was 'just okay.' 

White rice was extra dry, their 'scoops' of fish left you wishing they could've fit that wee extra bit more into the scooper, and the sauces were just ok.  Maybe the sauces need tweaking? AND they ran out of avocado. At 1 p.m. SMH.

Also, the guy in front of me ordered a 'large bowl' & the server noticed this and was like, \"Oh,  you got a large.  You get 3 scoops of fish.\" So when it was my turn,  I told him I also got the large, and asked, \"So am I supposed to get another scoop, too?\" (it was a half salad, half rice large served in a large to-go container), he didn't answer or acknowledge the comment.  I brushed it off that he just didn't hear me, but I was definitely put off by the lack of attention to my order versus the other guy's. 

I equate this place to Chipotle, where you go down a line and watch them make it...and just like at Chipotle when the   person scoops out the chicken or steak in front of you....when they scoop the fish using their small scooper here you're kinda left with a feeling of, oh...that's it?? :-( 

All in all, it didn't suck, but it definitely wasn't amazing like many people are saying on here. It makes me question people's taste! I wouldn't ask friends to meet me up there for lunch or dinner. I'm pretty sure we would try it one more time, maybe after the grand opening after they work their kinks out."}
{"text":"Ahipoki has been my lifesaver!!!
Needing to loose just a little bit of flab and turn it into fab, this place is getting me on the right track. my favorite combo is half/half, scoop of spicy tuna and salmon. I add all the extra toppings on it except for the jimaica and sprouts with a little of seasame and creamy spicy sauce. Nom nom nom. I've even gotten my sister on the poki bowl kick too and she was happy to find one by her house in Chandler."}
{"text":"Yum this place was delicious and pretty good pricing for all the food! We got the tuna, salmon and the Hawaiian tuna over brown rice with ginger, seaweed, and lots of other healthy mix-ins. Delicious and fast just the way I like it. If it was closer, I'd be here on the regular!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing I eat here at least twice a week the food is always fresh. And very reasonably priced I do recommend the half and half with rice and salad"}
{"text":"My first meal in Scottsdale since arriving a few weeks ago. Its a pleasant surprise both for taste and price. Im a fan of brown rice, sushi, tuna and the house sauce mix. Regular size is enough for a small appetite. They have a half off promo for your next visit :)"}
{"text":"This is an outstanding choice for a delicious and healthy meal. I would kill to have one of these in Gilbert."}
{"text":"So good! I visit at least once a week. My favorite is the half and half with spicy tuna and salmon, spicy creamy and house sauce mixed and all the fix ins on top. Staff is usually super friendly, but I have had a few instances where they seemed to be a little less enthused. Never have had an issue with quality, which is obviously super important when it comes to eating raw food! Highly recommend checking it out. There's almost always a line, so be patient if there is, but they are great about keeping it moving! And the meal is worth a little wait!"}
{"text":"I tried this place out yesterday after wanting a fresh, quick dinner option compared to other poke bowls that I have had, Ahipoki Bowl is close to the top. The only reason I give 3 stars is Its little over priced and some of the people who work there are not very customers friendly."}
{"text":"Basically chipotle with sushi. Pretty awesome idea and I think it will do well. The prices are reasonable and portions are good. I would love to see more fresher ingredients and perhaps more variety. We will definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"So awesome! Very friendly staff and yummy poke! Feels like we are in Maui again!

There are a lot of choices of fish and toppings. You can choose to have it over a bed of white rice, brown rice or salad. You can pick between regular or large. We split a large and it was definitely enough for two people. Good size portion for the price. 

We will definitely be back when we are in the area again!"}
{"text":"As healthy as it gets!! The location is great, although I sometimes get tempted by Chipotle next door."}
{"text":"Do you ever put off going to a new spot in town because you know as soon as you do the instant addiction will hit and you'll be forever thinking about Poke bowls? No? Just me? Ok. 

Well, that was my predicament and I held out as long as I could and then finally in late June gave in and made my first trip to Ahipoke Bowl and they are everything I imagined them to be. I've now been 5 times in the past 2 weeks. Addiction is real. 

You walk in and are greeted by the Chipotle-style menu board and line, your eyes widen as you realize all the choices and topping and awesomeness that awaits you. Go for the regular bowl to kick things off, but you'll quickly graduate to the large bowl for only $2 more. The difference is 2 scoops of seafood or 3 - choices like salmon, tuna, spicy tuna and scallops. I've now perfected my order of 1/3 brown rice 2/3 salad in the large bowl, with house spicy sauce on my 2 scoops of salmon and 1 scoop of spicy tuna. Then I just go all in on the toppings - things like edamame, jicama, seaweed salad, sesame seeds, wasabi, ginger, fish eggs, krab salad and you can also add avocado for $1 more. Tried the green tea last time and wasn't too impressed, I'll just stick to water and make the bowl my main focus as it should be. 

Its all delicious and I want it everyday now - breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, late-night. I'm starting a support group, see you guys there at 11am daily for lunch. And then again for dinner. As far as addictions go, this isn't a bad one to have, right? See you there :)"}
{"text":"I hope this place goes out of business soon. I have been there three times in the last two weeks. The first visit was great, but the last two left me with a disgusted feeling. 

There is this black girl who is so rude at the front of the line and is very unwelcoming to new customers. She tried to rush me, regardless of the fact that I was the only person in line. The other employees are just as bad. They act like they are above you. I don't get it."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with Chipotle-style poke bowls at Ahipoki Bowl. You pick your base and your toppings, are in and out quickly, and can enjoy decent quality fish at around $10 for a meal - plus it's fairly healthy. I would eat here every day if it were possible! Skip the macaron ice cream sandwiches though, and get yourself an extra scoop of delicious fish."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite \"fast-food\" in Scottsdale. The sushi was excellent. Everything was fresh & tasty. I highly recommend the creamy spicy sauce. So good!
The only downfalls to this place, and why I didn't give it 5 stars: it was way too hot in there and way too loud. I had to yell to order my food and couldn't hear the questions they were asking."}
{"text":"No pictures today because I couldn't wait to dig right in. I had to bring Mom for her first time and she loves it! Sorry I missed seeing Jason today, but glad to hear y'all are opening in Chandler soon! Congratulations on the expansion! I look forward to doing business with your locations very soon. My contact information is the same. God bless on your continued success. Very fresh, filling, and affordable! The staff is always bright and cheerful! #BringAhipokeBowlToTucson"}
{"text":"I Love their food! The biggest one I have been in so far. The service is always on point and Kila and CT are always greeting me as I come in. They make it a great experience"}
{"text":"One word: AMAZING!

I think I visit this restaurant about 2-3 times A WEEK. That's how much I love it. 
If you like sushi, then you will definitely like this place. It's basically a deconstructed sushi roll, in bowl form (similar to a chipotle choosing style.) 

I have tried all of the fish options and haven't found a single one that I don't like. You can mix it up or even order the same for all the scoops, either way the food is delicious. 

The team members that work here are also awesome. If I ask for extra of anything, they don't hesitate with the toppings. For example, I love edamame beans so when I want two (or more) giant handfuls, they are happy to do it. 

We've since moved, and this is one place I will truly miss. Can't wait to get back to Phoenix because this will for sure be a top spot."}
{"text":"I was so excited for this place to open, and it does not disappoint! I went for lunch today around 11:30 and it was pretty empty when I walked in but by the time I left 5 minutes later the line was getting long. 
I got a regular sized bowl (which was plenty of food) with white rice, avocado, tuna, spicy tuna, spicy house sauce, green onions, ginger, sprouts, cucumbers, crispy onions and sesame seeds. The price was not bad at all, about $9. It was so good I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"A buddy brought me here for lunch about 3 weeks ago and I've been back about 2 times a week since. Very tasty, healthy and fast. Definately one of my favorite lunch stops when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"If I only lived closer I would be eating there every three days. Delicious and nutritious. However, the first several months in business they offered attention-getting portions of fish. Now that they got enough attention (and business) the portion size has dropped. In the beginning a large bowl would completely satisfy me like to other sushi place I've ever been, just because I finally got all the fish I wanted! But now it's just like every other sushi place. If you want complete satisfaction, you'll have to pay well for that. So I just go with the large bowl and always wish for five or six more bites of fish."}
{"text":"I've been patiently waiting for this new poke spot to open. There's not too many places around that serve poke and there aren't any that serve a build your own poke like they do. And wow!!! Their options and quantity for the regular size bowl exceeded my expectations. Absolutely delicious! My favorite part about this little poke spot is the variety in toppings. Toppings make everything better and they're def making poke the better way it can be made. So excited to have this yummy spot in my hood! Supa fresh and delish!!!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed a large Poki bowl at Ahipoki Bowl for dinner. They had pretty good toppings available with the exception of jalapenos. I ordered my bowl with half salad and half rice. The scoops of fish were not incredibly large so that could be one improvement but they tasted fresh. I ordered my bowl with half salad and rice and I found the salad wasn't able to absorb all the sauce compared to rice. I think next time I would try a rice base."}
{"text":"FAVORITE!!! This place is so good and healthy. You feel so much energy after you eat here and you are paying for what you get.... which is great food! The portions are huge they are not skimpy like Chipotle is."}
{"text":"Excellent especially since we have so few seafood options in Scottsdale. Great idea."}
{"text":"Fish so fresh that it tries to find Nemo in your bowl!

I've been anticipating the grand opening of Ahipoki since they followed me on Instagram and when they announced that April 1st was their soft opening, I thought surely it was an April Fool's joke.  After setting up a lunch date with my bruh, Linh L., we sped on over and tada!  A poke bowl was bought and consumed! Fish as fresh as Arizona can get with modest sized portions.  I won't go into detail with what I ordered because we all have our preferences and it's made to your liking.  I think the regular is too small and I like to stick with the large with half rice and half salad.  Enjoy your poke bowl, folks!  I'm happy with my chirashi!

So you decide on whether or not you want a regular [2 scoops] or a large bowl [3 scoops], what base you want [white rice, brown rice, organic salad, or half & half], choose your side [avocado ($1 more), crabmeat, or onion], choose your scoop selection [tuna, spicy tuna, salmon, albacore, shrimp, octopus, yellowtail ($1 more), or scallops], choose your sauce [house, house spicy, spicy creamy, or sweet citrus], and then you choose your topping [masago, ginger, wasabi, fresh cucumber, seaweed salad, roasted seaweed, jicama, daikon sprouts, sesame seed mix, crispy onions, green onions, chili flakes, or everything].  They have your standard choice of beverages from soda to teas.

I'm so glad ahipoki has made their way into Arizona.  I know, fresh fish in the desert sounds suspect but my tummy is happy!  Wishing Ahipoki much success!"}
{"text":"What can I say? It's basically sushi in a bowl with either rice or a salad...Quick, healthy, inexpensive, and delicious! What else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Hello poke, my old friend!

Where have you been my whole life!  Poke is to sushi as a burger is to steak - very similar in taste for a fraction of the price!

At Ahipoki Bowl, it was around $15 a person for a poke bowl, plus a Thai iced tea for me, and a macaron ice cream sandwich for Lacy. 

The bowl was the star - a base of rice, salad, or both, with your choice of 2 types of delicious raw fish cubes on top. Tuna, salmon, octopus, shrimp, as well as dressed tuna in a Hawaiian sauce. Top it all of with a few sauces, plus avocado, masago, crab, greens, pickled veggies, and some spices and crispy seaweed, you got yourself a delicious meal!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Fresh ingredients, healthy and on top of having great tasting food they are fast!!!! Great spot for a quick healthy meal. I always mix the house spicy with the house creamy sauce they have and get a little extra of their house creamy on the side. Watch out for hidden wasabi though. I've made the mistake and taken a whole bite of it once because it was hiding under my rice. At least my sinuses seemed to clear up lol!"}
{"text":"Great food/concept & reasonably priced but horribly awful rude manager. Prefer colonnade or n. Sctdl!"}
{"text":"By no means am I poke connoisseur but I really like this place. It's close to home, the workers are nice but not chatty and they have a good selection of toppings and bases. The fish seems to be of decent quality although sometimes the salmon tends to be a little too fatty for my taste. I think the only thing I didn't like was there choice brand of coconut water because it had extra stuff in it that completely ruined the taste for me. But really that's not the locations fault as this is a chain. It provides a healthy meal (dependent on your choices) at a decent price. I'd say it's a win for the area."}
{"text":"I like ahi poke and definitely think it's good. I'm a poke snob as it's such a big thing back in LA, and I've actually been to the first ahipoke that opened in Temple city first before giving this location a shot. 

I have already been here multiple times and the one thing that annoys me most is portion size. One time I'll have an employee give me a solid portion of food that I think is standard and the most recent time, the guy was super stiff and gives me half spoons of everything and charges me $1 extra for another small scoop of seaweed salad. 

I'd say your experience will be a hit or miss and for paying $15 I definitely did expect to be provided a little more than what I got. This last time deterred me from considering to come back and I'm rather just go to a sushi restaurant and buy the chirashi Bowl with the amount of money I spent on this bowl from AhiPoke."}
{"text":"Ok this place is a gold mine . Super fresh salads , rice and sweet/spicy house sauce . Usually with a line out the door .... Very high protein low in bad fat and grease... Good veggies and amino acids from fresh food .

You can choose from Yellowtail, tuna, spicy tuna and salmon to name a few . The yummy orange fish eggs are my favorite don't forget to ask for an extra scoop .

Fast , fun , fresh and healthy Hawaiian fusion restaurant ."}
{"text":"Excellent food and fast, walk through, create your own style restaurant. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an authentic poke bowl, this is the place you need to come visit. Blows other poke restaurants out of the water"}
{"text":"So good, basically a chipotle but for sushi. Ingredients are always very fresh and so delicious. I crave it almost once a week."}
{"text":"First time eating at Ahipoki  the food was fresh the place was clean It's an amazing place and finally I will come back and I highly recommend eating at this place"}
{"text":"Lukewarm meat and rice, flavors don't jive, oh man this place was just so, so gross in my opinion."}
{"text":"FYI so you don't get yelled at by the rude white girl with glasses that works the line. if you get a large bowl and get \"half and half\" which is half rice and half salad to start the bowl, it apparently comes in a bigger clear plastic container that's not listed anywhere, but they expect you to know this and they pack half the container with rice enough to feed 5 people. SERIOUSLY WTF was her issue? She started packing the rice in the container and I simply asked \"which size is that one? I just wanted the large bowl\" and in the rudest, snappiest attitude, she goes... \"You said half and half didn't you??..\". Ok.... I did but I didn't know it came in a giant container and I didn't know it came with 5 scoops of rice. Work on your customer service PLEASE. Other than that, the owner was pretty nice at checkout and the food was good."}
{"text":"We come here for lunch at least twice a week and seems like the servings keep getting smaller and smaller! $15 for a bowl and small drink - can i get more than 5 pieces of edamame and a miniature helping of seaweed? Not without an upcharge!"}
{"text":"Had a couple friends recommend this place, been dying to try it and I finally made the journey! Walk in, very clean environment, friendly staff and clear choices of what to order. The fish and ingredients are fresh and delicious, really wish I woulda got the Thai tea or the green tea, maybe next time! They also have macaroons that look tempting, be sure to get a small bowl if you want to try one, you get a great portion with a large bowl!"}
{"text":"It's easy to fall in love with poke bowls at this restaurant. I get to pick exactly what I want in my bowl. I love how fresh their ingredients are. It's so delicious, that I forget I'm eating healthy. If you have been on the fence about poke, now is the time to give it a try. For more food posts, follow me @brooklyn409 on Instagram."}
{"text":"I've never been to Hawaii but let me tell you, it is Hawaii in a bowl (I presume).  :-P

And if you've never had an poki bowl in your life, you seriously are missing out, big time.  Granted, if you had or like sushi, you are not too far off in missing out on a poki bowl.  The taste is quite similar.

I've had poki bowls in a few other places in my life time and I must say, Ahipoki Bowl blows them out.  

It truly starts with having fresh fish and ingredients.  I've had it twice so far and the consistency is there.  That is how you tell a place is going to succeed or not.  

To sum this place up, its your 'Chipotle' concept in which you build a rice bowl with toppings.  You are asked what type of rice and you can do half and half.  You pick a small or large bowl.  If you come with a date, I highly recommend sharing 1 large unless you are super duper hungry because 1 large is overwhelming, believe me.

After you know your bowl size, you select a handful of cubed cut fresh sashimi options such as salmon, tuna, yellowtail (extra cost), house flavored blend, shrimp, and 1 more that I cannot name right now. :-p  So after that, you move on to your choice in sauce where they mix all your seafoods together.  And then after that, you get to throw all kinds of yummy toppings like salmon roe, edamame, sprouts, fried onions, and so on.  

As I said earlier, share 1 Large if you are on a date.  Come hungry, be satisfied (I promise).  1 last thing, the pricing is very affordable.  I hope they expand to more cities."}
{"text":"We've been going to the Poke Bar pretty regularly since it opened in Glendale, but when we found out this place had Thai Tea we headed over to try it. 

Pros:
-Bigger portions than they have at Poke Bar
-They have avocado 
-They have Thai Tea (it was alright)

Cons:
-some of the fish had a metallic taste 
-the House Sauce was ridiculously salty, it was difficult to finish (It's much better at Poke Bar)
-the scallops are tiny and plain (again, way better at Poke Bar)

I don't know that we would go back. We would probably just stick to going to Poke Bar"}
{"text":"Good poke and very fast! I got a large and it was plenty of good for dinner. Lots of TVs too so you can watch the game while you eat Poke - can it be better?"}
{"text":"Yummers!! Only reason I am giving them 4 stars and not 5 is because they don't have many kids, vegetarian (non-pescatarian), or cooked fish options; this place is for a more adventurous crowd. I guess those other folks can go and get their fix next door at Chipotle. Ended up getting my toddler a side of rice with the crab salad, which they recommended as a kids option. She liked it, but I am grooming her to be a foodie like her momma! She eats just about everything - so if you have a picky eater, I'm not sure they'd necessarily go for it. Even though they do not have a kids menu, the do have highchairs. Also, it's a laid back, family friendly environment. 

Great service! Everyone was patient in explaining the ordering process - I am sure they have to do this hundreds of times a day so I give them major props for that! I tried the half rice, half salad with the Korean shrimp and ahi tuna, plus a bunch of their toppings and the house sauce. I preferred the tuna over the shrimp. I have to admit, I am a newbie to eating raw seafood but the ahi tuna was REALLY good! I also tried their tropical drink that was pretty sweet but really good. I noticed they have a freezer dessert option -  some sort of giant macaron with ice cream in the middle. I didn't get a chance to try it but next time I am going to save some room and give it a shot.

We will definitely be returning to this place. My husband LOVED it and is excited to have a new go-to, eat-in or take-out seafood option."}
{"text":"I wish they would open up a location in North Phoenix - as the only time we eat there on the Thomas Rd. location is when we are in the area - which is not too much.  There's nothing bad about this place.  The poke is fresh, the food is plentiful and the tropical drink is soooo delicious!  Open one in North Phoenix, pleeeassseee!"}
{"text":"Very popular concept spreading around the country, you select your items on a bowl size, type of rice, side which I would recommend the crab, then your selection which is your main entree, then the sauce you want depending on your desired flavor and lastly the topping.

I am not a big fan of raw or shashimi, so this concept was not my favorite, poki is healthy and the latest trend, but it is not my first choice"}
{"text":"Great, awesome and LOVEs IT.  Ordering from here reminded me of a Chipotle or Subway.... you roll up and state the size \"bowl\" you want.  I took the regular size bowl that comes with 2 scoops of fish.  (The large with 3).  YOu have the option to take white rice, brown rice or half and half.  I did .75 and .25.  I don't eat that much rice.  A scoop of Ahi tuna and a scoop of Tuna Luna....

There are 4 different sauces that they can mix your fish with.  Me.. I go for the spicy house sauce.  yumms.. not too spicy at all.  A bit heavy on the sesame oil on my second trip, but still tasty.

then there are about 9 different toppings that you can add on... Me... ALL of them please.  Oh boy talk about deliciousness!

I returned on the grand opening.  The line was long.  Everything was half price.  :-)

Return Factor: 100%

Taking my coworkers here for lunch."}
{"text":"This place was really awesome when it opened, as far as service and the food. I have been supporting and recommending to my friends, after going several times.

The portions are now smaller and for two bowls and two beverages for $30, I was pretty disappointed by the way I was treated. For example, I asked to have sprouts on my bowl and I got 4. I asked if I could have more and he made a face at me and put two more sprouts on. Then when I ordered the beverages, I asked for no ice because they were already chilled. She too made a face at me and started talking to the guy who'd just made my bowls (I was bringing them home as a special treat, as I hadn't been there in a bit.)

I'd honestly rather eat at home than spend my money where the staff is giving me attitude and audibly saying rude things.

3 stars since the place is clean and I enjoy the food, but I have no plans to return at this time."}
