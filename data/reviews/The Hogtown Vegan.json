{"text":"Hogtown is wonderful. Absolutely perfect vegan comfort food. Sometimes you really can't stand another healthy-tasting salad, you know?   The staff was friendly, the service was quick, and the portions were ample (to say the least). I'm definitely heading back before I leave Toronto! :)"}
{"text":"There was nowhere to sit (there are only two tables) and girls that work here were so rude we were nervous to even ask for a to go box.  Won't be returning."}
{"text":"I'm updating and upgrading because every time I come here I like it more.  Plus, they have beer now.  And wine.  Yay booze!  Also, the salt and unhealthiness of the food is kind of the point."}
{"text":"Great to have a vegan place near by, but the food is so salty it's almost inedible after a while.   The vegetable sides were also extremely oily, which meant there wasn't really a break from the heavyness of the mains (many of which were fried or greasy). I understand that it is comfort food and this isn't supposed to be your typical veggie healthy fare, but I felt like the menu was a bit redundant.   won't be going back."}
{"text":"My experience is mainly about the service. I've been to this place at least 5 times, all of them with my daughter. whether it was with the husband, friends, mom, I had my 5 yr old along. The service was as rude as it could get. My daughter is a normal 5 year old, sometimes loud, sometimes chatty, but never creates ruckus if I may say so myself. I'm not expecting the waitress to play with her, a kind smile could suffice. She ran to share some of her snack with the waitress and this one gave her a look as if she was handing her a bomb! I could make out that they were be frustrated, in a bad humor or just impatient for us to order as if we already had in mind what to get, gobble our food and get the heck out of there. Definitely not a family friendly place, if we left a reasonable tip is out of respect. Food after some point was meh...  Thanks to these experiences I'll learn how to make home-made macaroni and cheese, thank you very much. Not intending to spend one more dollar in a place that obviously doesn't welcome patrons with the little ones in tow"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating vegan food, and I was pleasantly surprised. Service was friendly and quick, and portion size was huge. We ordered the poutine and wings for appetizers. Poutine which was delicious, crispy fries and delicious gravy. The vegan cheese didn't add much to the dish. The wings were ok, but would not order them again.  I had the chicken and waffles, which was the highlight of my meal. Flavorful, crispy and hitting the sweet and savory balance perfectly. With the Philly cheesesteak, the bread to filling ratio was too high, even for a cheesesteak. Lastly, the steak and dumplings was ok, too salty for my but others enjoyed it.  Overall a good experience and would go again!"}
{"text":"This place is what people watch the food network for. The food is AMAZING. The service is awesome, atmosphere is great and the food deserves some kind of magical award. It is so incredible to go to a resturant where I have full range of the menu and I can't go wrong! Everything is delicious."}
{"text":"I'm a vegan, but I'm disappointed to say this place is pretty much a disaster. The servers are slow and rude. The food is sorta tasty, but everything is just soaked in oil. Vegan food can be delicious, but these guys haven't figured it out yet. You can't save a meal just by deep frying it."}
{"text":"After a number of years, and change in ownership/management, my friends and I have been back to Hogtown.   The new management has none of the failings of the old, and have been considerate and responsive on any number of things that I've spoken to them about.  Service is great, and everyone is friendly, even when it's busy. The menu has a similar style as when I was last there, but has gotten better overall. Great place to go and get your vegan diner food fix."}
{"text":"Still basking in the glow of our brunch. We came in for a Saturday brunch and were blown away by our fantastic meal. We tried the unchicken and waffles, the PB & banana french toast, and the tortilla salad and everything was excellent! Easy street parking out front. Will be back on our next trip to Toronto!!"}
{"text":"The \"chicken\" wings were some of the best vegetarian wings that I ever had.  I think the buffalo sauce option is better than the BBQ sauce.  We also tried the southern combo which had \"chicken\" strips (pretty much the same as the wings but without sauce on it....BBQ sauce on the side), collard greens and macaroni - all of which was very good."}
{"text":"Great place for vegan comfort food. It's fairly busy so be there early on weekends for dinner if you want to get a table without having to wait 30 to 40 minutes. It can also get very warm inside when it's busy (as it's fairly small) so wear removable layers.   The food is delicious! I've tried the unchicken and waffles as well as the southern combo. Both were great, portions were large enough and justify the price of the entrees."}
{"text":"Growing up in the deep south, but having since gone mostly-vegan vegetarian, I miss my comfort foods. Now I no longer have to go without! Hogtown Vegan is THE PLACE to go if you have a craving for amazing southern food, without the meat.  The unchicken they make there is just amazingly tasty! I've tried many times to replicate such fantastic seitan  at home, but never been able to get close to what they achieve here at Hogtown Vegan.   Everything else I've had here has been equally craving-satisfying and filling. My non-veg boyfriend enjoys it too - his only complaint is that he wished the weekend brunch menu was a bit more diverse.   When we've been the service has been great, and the wait times completely within average standards when you're eating out.  I say, if you're wanting a thick southern meal that will stick to your ribs and tickle all your taste buds, you can't go wrong with Hogtown Vegan! I will be back again...and again...and again."}
{"text":"Went here yesterday for the fourth time and ordered some of their delicious wings! So good!! Staff is always awesome and courteous and I always have a great experience here whether I'm with people or alone. Their sandwiches are also good, and I tried the mousse dessert - addicting haha! Went in a few days later after the first time just to grab it!! ^.^  Also found it way better priced and more reasonable portion sizes than other vegan restaurants selling the same type of stuff."}
{"text":"I've been back a couple of times since my last review and have to say that everything I've gotten has been delicious! I feel that the quality has improved a lot and I like the new location better than the old one."}
{"text":"Food 4, Service two  I came here last night with friends we ordered multiple dishes and ate it family style. I am a meat eater and had low expectations. I was very disappointed in the service. We were a group of 5 and they predominately have two top tables. When I asked to hostess approximate time that we could expect to wait she said she could give us any indication of how long. I found her insincere with her \"apology\" . Soorrryy Guuuuyyyss\" ugh. I am in the service industry as well and I know you can usually give an estimate based on where people are with there meals. After stand at the tiny space buy the door for at least 30 mins we were seated. We waited a bout 10 mins for someone to take our drink orders. I finally had enough and just grabbed tel attention of server passing by to ask for a drink. Once our server finally came he was nice enough. So once our food hit the table the redemption began. The food was really great. We basically inhaled it. We also order desserts which were fab. I think for me the fried banana sundae was buy far the best. I suggest they have more tables to accommodate larger parties and for them to better train staff on service. I would return here only because they have magicians in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Simply the worst first experience ever. I just moved to the neighbourhood and I asked my neighbour if there is a good vegan restaurant and she was like \"go to Hogtown, I've never been there but I hear it is a very nice place\". Right at the entrance there was a sign that warned \"Please wait to be seated, booths are for parties and groups\" or something to that effect. So trying to be modest, even though the place was half empty, I stood by the notice for 15 good minutes and no one noticed I was standing there. Something makes me think may be because I am Black. After waiting for 15 minutes a young woman comes to the counter and calls on me, \"excuse me a table for just one tonight?\" First, I thought it was a dream, finally someone is talking to me but behind a counter when the notice suggests someone would come and show a customer to tye seat. Just the gesture irked me and I excused myself and said, \"thank you but I'll go elsewhere\". My advise: put up a notice that reads, BLACKS ARE NOT WELCOME."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The portions are huge. My favorite dish is the seitan roast beef sandwich with mushroom gravy. A few dishes like the clam appetizer are not great, but overall the quality is excellent."}
{"text":"I visited the Hogtown Vegan this past Saturday evening, which was probably a bit of a bad decision timing wise. The place was packed and we ended up having to wait outside of the restaurant in the cold for at least 10 minutes before even having our name put on a list. I've been wanting to try this place forever though and it was my venue of choice for my 10 year veg anniversary, so we had to stick it out.   When we finally got seated, we ordered a couple beers which were on the pricey side for an average pint, and the Fries Supremacy as the appetizer. Being a vegetarian and not a full out vegan, I've never been a huge fan of the dairy alternatives I've tried. I wasn't sure what to expect with this fake cheese and sour cream, but holy crap these fries were good. The \"cheese\" was creamy, salty and had everything that the typical fast food cheese sauce should be. The sunflower sour cream actually tasted a lot like sour cream which sort of blew my mind. Had these alternatives been discovered 5 years ago when I went through my vegan phase, I probably never would have gotten out of it.   As for the entrees, we had one order of the Chicken and Waffles and two orders of the Southern Combo. I was so excited to have that delicious fried chicken that I've been craving for a decade, since vegetarian food is never really that exciting or greasy at restaurants. And I have to say this satisfied. The chicken was probably double fried as it was extra crispy, and was sort of bland which to me is a good thing for meat replacements since it picks up the flavour of the breading and sauces that you use. The collard greens were just good, needed a bit of salt and more garlic. The mac and cheese was surprisingly delicious as well. The same cheese sauce from the fries supremacy, with a bit of what I'm guessing was a bread crumb topping to add some texture. Better than most regular mac and cheese I've had! For the chicken and waffles, the waffles were so light and fluffy and the sweet potato mash was out of this world. I like to think I make some good sweet potatoes, but this stuff was way better. The whole dish was a bit on the sweet side, so you have to be into that sort of thing, but otherwise it was great.   All in all, I'm super pleased with the Hogtown Vegan. I'm already planning multiple visits back to try the rest of the menu items. For a vegetarian or vegan who misses their meat or dairy, this place hits the spot."}
{"text":"This is my favourite vegan restaurant. I love the Southern Combo - steamed garlic greens, fried 'unchicken', and mac n cheese. The unchichen and waffles is also pretty amazing - I prefer the version that's on the dinner menu, with mashed sweet potatoes and steamed greens. The deep-fried apple pie for dessert was very decadent. I always leave this place SO full. Love it there!"}
{"text":"Wasn't a huge fan of the entrees the first couple of times I visited Hogtown. I came back and enjoyed some of the appetizers including the supremacy fries, buffalo \"wing\" and the black bean and daiya cheese quesadilla and was blown away. So good! I have been coming back to try more and more items from hog town and I am quite impressed by the vegan junk food offered here. The unchicken cesaer wrap is really good and I love how thinly cut and crispy there fries are. Delicious."}
{"text":"My go to vegan restaurant to satisfy my salt/comfort/junk food cravings.  New space is bigger and now they take debit, MasterCard and Visa!  The Unchicken and Waffles is simply the best!  Non vegan friends and family of mine love this place too!"}
{"text":"I love it here. I love their tortilla salad and their unchicken so much. Service is fine, restaurant is cute, I always enjoy having a meal here. I don't think reviews complaining about the food being unhealthy are fair ; vegan is not synonymous with bunny food all the time!"}
{"text":"I'm sad to have to write this review. I liked this place; tasty food, and cool atmosphere.   Unfortunately, the last time I went there (it was my second visit--my first visit was great!), was rather unpleasant. The food was  good, comfort food made vegan=yum. But, then, cockroaches!!!! Ugh. Very upsetting. The couple next to me got up and left, and I saw movement out of the corner of my eye right after they left. There were 4 or 5 large cockroaches scuttling around the floor vent right under the table next to us. LARGE cockroaches. Seriously.   When we mentioned it to the waitress, she brushed it off, saying they \"get sprayed weekly, but, you know, it happens\". She wasn't very understanding or disturbed by the situation. I found that rather disconcerting. She didn't offer to discount the bill, despite seeing the group of cockroaches sitting there. Sadly, I will never go back. If she had been as horrified as I was, then I would feel more at ease going back, but she really didn't seem to be concerned...very troubling."}
{"text":"Honestly its pretty bad with some pretty rude management. Maybe this is a nice place for someone that is new to vegan eating, forced into a vegan diet or as a compromise for vegan eaters to bring their meat loving family.   Only one item on the menu isnt pretending to be meat or cheese. (The blt and only because they use thin tofu for bacon instead of a fo bacon) and they are really insistent that it can only be served at brunch. I even offered to pay full burger price and just have a burger with the same tofu bacon but no patty and was just insulted for the sugesstion. Having takin people here a couple times I've observed a terrible attitude in general with any substitutions etc. There is no tastable love in their food. No joy for their own ingredients and what countless tastey delights they could make that arnt pretending to be meat. Id rather eat real meat than their burger that tries too hard to be like real meat. They could at least have a bean burger or a mushroom burger. What is even the point of being a vegan restaurant if they dont like vegan food? Ive had great vegan food done in the style of bbq or burger joints and the key is simple; just great freshly made food showcasing great fresh ingredients instead if trying to win the award for best pretend chicken"}
{"text":"I loved this place! The food was delicious and the service was very, very good. Nothing negative to say on that front.   The only thing I would like to see would be AC. OMG! It was way too hot inside, felt like a sauna.   Besides that, I definitely recommend The Hogtown Vegan. Please go check it out!!!"}
{"text":"I got the Caesar salad with unchicken for lunch today and it was excellent! Pleasantly surprised by the soy chicken. You would have had me fooled if I didn't already know. And the dressing had the perfect amount of tanginess to it as well. If I had awesome food like this every day I would totally become vegan.   We got it for take out though so no comments on dine in service. However while we waited for the salad the server gave us some cold water to drink. Thank you!"}
{"text":"It was a pleasant visit this time around.  Last time I wasn't able to have their regular menu due to it being the weekend in the morning..very selective menu for weekend brunch. This time around I had the phish & fries and upgrade my fries to the supremecy and Mac n' cheese...wow!! The cheese sauce was AMAZING. ..I just can't get enough!!  My only problem was with the phish....it was just a big block of tempeh,not very good.  The batter was delicious but the tempeh felt under seasoned and greasy.  I will definitely be back because the service was fast and pleasing."}
{"text":"This is my favourite vegan restaurant! Friendly staff and delicious food!   Bring a raised vegetarian there has always been a couple of dishes that have piqued my interest, but alas would make me sick of I ate them. Finally I can have chicken and waffles and wings!   Hands down the best vegan pulled pork sandwich in the cityand the chilli cheese fries are absolutely divine.  10/10 would recommend."}
{"text":"There is nothing like the Hogtown Vegan for vegan comfort food. They are no longer cash-only, which is a relief since I never carry cash. The Mac & Cheez is absolutely delicious, and I have had many non-vegan friends try it and refuse to believe that it doesn't have cheese. The Oreo Parfait is *to die for* and will satisfy any sweet tooth.  I routinely eat the appetizers as meals because they are so big. Plus it leaves room for dessert! This is a fantastic place to take omnivores because they won't believe it's vegan."}
{"text":"The food was awesome. Not exactly healthy, but it was really good, solid, vegan comfort food.    I loved the kitschy, retro diner feel, but the service sorrily lacked. I will chalk it up as a bad night and will definitely give them another chance.   Who needs meat with this kinda food out there?"}
{"text":"In the 6 months we've lived in Toronto, we have become regulars at Hogtown.  Is it health food?  No.  Is it awesome food?  YES!  Some of our favorite dishes include the Fries Supremacy, the Southern Comfort dinner (the best collard greens I have ever had, hands down), and the Phish and Chips.  I personally think their caesar salad is just so-so, and would also like to see a more inspired dessert menu (vegan butterfinger milkshake comes to mind, a la Blossom in NYC), but overall, Hogtown is an awesome site for vegan indulgence.  A few complainers on Yelp seem want Hogtown to serve \"health food\" or feel intimidated by what they experience as a \"hipster\" crowd.  Well, if you're looking for more health-oriented vegan food, Hogtown shouldn't be your pick - there are tons of options for stuff like that scattered throughout Toronto (e.g. Fresh comes to mind), so simply go elsewhere.  As for the hipster complaint, all I can say is that the servers are really sweet, and the rest of the diners seemed totally normal to me, so I don't understand what the objection could be.  Hogtown is cash only, so be prepared for that.  Overall, five huge stars to our fave vegan kinda healthy junkfood joint!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, and great customer service! As a vegetarian, I find it difficult to find the greasy, delicious comfort food that I used to be able to eat when I was a meat-eater - the Hogtown Vegan is a god send for vegans/vegetarians! Very nice atmosphere, and friendly staff. Pricing is reasonable as well."}
{"text":"If I could marry this place, I would.  If I could eat the Unchicken & Waffles everyday (...and not get fat) , I would.  That fact that Hogtown just got its liquor license, makes it even sexier then when it just had normal drinks.  The wait staff are awesome.  The green paint colour is hideous.  I love the piano.  I love this place!!!!  Thank you for your awesomeness.   xoxox    PS: I'm totally coming for Brunch on Sunday."}
{"text":"The food was outstanding.  I had an unchicken burger and added crispy bacon.  I live nine sad hours away, so my taste buds will have to find a way to cope without more of that delicious sandwich.  I shared macaroni and cheese with my two kids (who didn't like it as much as I did, and ate carrot sticks and a waffle instead), then we all had the fried oreos, which were beyond delicious.  My husband had the pulled pork, and said it was fantastic.  I felt like the servers weren't too thrilled to see us there with our kids -- granted, the kids were tired and whiny, but the servers could have put on a friendlier face."}
{"text":"I should have updated this sooner! I have been to Hogtown Vegan about 3 times since the last review, and they have added another server and added a non-chocolate item to their menu!"}
{"text":"Best vegetarian comfort food around! My girlfriend and I shared the southern chicken with collard greens and Mac n cheese and the peppersteak and dumplings with sweet potato mash - everything was outstanding! The pints of sangria were an added bonus. Looking forward to returning soon!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with a friend and loved it. Ordered the special with stuffed potato skins (OMG I'm dreaming about them), buffalo \"chicken\" strips and coleslaw. Also ordered the Mac and cheese. The service was great and I can't wait to try the rest of their menu. Definitely a new fav!"}
{"text":"It was my first time going to Hogtown tonight and I left happy! It's a really small place, only a few tables to if you got later, you might have to wait (the place is really small so there's not a lot of room to stand around so its kind of annoying when there are people waiting all around you)  They have 2 types of beer on tap: flying monkey and mill st. organic (6.50). The dinner menu is made up (almost entirely) of Southern comfort foods, but minus the meat! It's a really great and cool concept, and great for vegans who just want some good old fried chicken or mac n' cheese!   I got the \"Southern Combo\" which was 2 peices of fried \"non-chicken\" fingers, a portion of mac n' cheese and collard greens ($12). My boyfriend got the \"Pepper Steak and Dumplings\" which I'm pretty sure were TVP medallions of steak with dumplings, that came with collard greens and molasses sweet potato mash ($12). All of the flavours in these meals were delicious. Both of us had nothing left on our plates at the end! Could have eaten more though... Maybe should have gotten an appetizer or a dessert!  Definitely a cool experience, and not too pricey either. I want to go back and try all of thier other cool Southern classic created in such a unique way without meat."}
{"text":"So gross. Never try the vegan mac and cheese. Only good thing is chilli cheese fries. Very overpriced for those on a budget. Extremely dissapointed"}
{"text":"This used to be my favourite vegan restaurant in the city. This last visit was horrible. To begin, the service was so slow. For a busy Sunday, they should have more people working the dinner rush.  We ordered \"wings\" to begin and then I ordered the Reuben sandwich and upgraded to Ceasar salad and my husband ordered the Philly Cheese steak.  When I took a bite of my salad I ate a crouton that tasted like moldy bread. I asked my husband to try one to see if it was just me and he gagged, confirming my experience. When I was finally able to flag down a server, she took the plate back to the kitchen. Instead of an apology, a kitchen worker came out with my plate and demanded that I show her the mold. I said I couldn't see it (the crouton was covered in spice) but I could taste it. I invited her to try one. She went back to the kitchen and came back to lecture me how it was a spice they use and \"one in a thousand people\" think it tastes like mold...etc. She didn't apologise but said she could take the croutons off the salad. That was all I wanted so she took the plate and came back with the same sandwich and a new side salad minus the croutons. At this point my sandwich was cold and when I bit into it, there was no sauce on the sandwich. I was hungry and this whole experience had taken over an hour, and I had already been lectured so I ate the horrible, cold sandwich. The worst was that when we got the bill, they still charged for the side salad. This is the last time I go here when there is so many wonderful vegan restaurants in the city."}
{"text":"Hogtown is a great restaurant that has great food, but the service is great also. We had a server named Christine or Christina recently that was absolutely fantastic. Above and beyond service with a smile and helped us to have a really fun time."}
{"text":"We went before dinner time so were dissapointed the menu was limited, however it made us step out of our regular food choices and we ate the waffles and unchicken, which was the best decision ever! so yummy. definitley recommend going for the waffles and unchicken. i want to go back and try the sandwich :)"}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I don't have many positive things to say about Hogtown Vegan.  The space isn't particularly clean or nice. The tables are wobbly. The prices are high, particularly given the location. Not good.  The menu consists almost entirely of thrown-together mixtures of mock meats and faux cheeses, almost all of which are store bought. Almost everything is fried. The cooking is also really inconsistent. (Burnt fries and an undercooked patty are common partners!) And the few items that are made in-house tend to be poorly seasoned. Also not good.  I also have it on good authority, from a number of people I trust, that the restaurant is not careful about ensuring that they have no items on the menu with animal-based ingredients. So vegans should be mindful. (I encourage you to ask questions.)  The servers have sometimes been friendly in the past. So I almost want to give a star for that. But even that has been inconsistent.  Not good."}
{"text":"There is nothing like this where I live, and this was such a treat that I ate there twice ;) the first time I had the unchicken and waffles (something I never tried when I was pregan) and the second time I had a cheeze burger and coleslaw -- all delicious!!!  My idea of comfort food is usually Thai or Japanese food, but this was - again - something I really enjoyed as a departure from the usual"}
{"text":"I was so excited the first few times I went to hogtown last year when it opened, vegan fast food, amazing! But I can't help but feel like it's been slipping since then. The portion sizes have gotten smaller, the prices have gone up and the quality and attention to detail has gone down."}
{"text":"(Context: long-time vegetarian, non-vegan, fake meat lover)  I'm so torn about the Hogtown Vegan. On the one hand, it is an amazing, unique vegetarian restaurant in Toronto, offering comfort food you simply can't get elsewhere. But on the other hand, a number of the menu items use mediocre, commercially-available vegetarian products that simply aren't all that exciting to me. And service is a bit hit-and-miss (it's actually perfectly great aside from one consistently miserable server with an accent...).  Food Positives:  - unchicken and waffles (conceptually, YES PLEASE, but see below) - Hogtown wings (amazing flavour for large chunks of tofu - buffalo sauce is my favourite, and not too spicy) - anything with the nacho cheese sauce, especially the fries supremacy (even as a non-vegan, this stuff is delicious) - pulled unpork sandwich (very similar to the veg pulled pork products you can get in U.S. stores, but impossible to find up here) - basket of beignets (omnomnom) - collard greens (cooked perfectly, in my opinion, and deliciously garlicky)  Food Negatives: - unchicken and waffles (I'm fairly certain the chicken is just the Presidents' Choice veg chicken breasts, halved and breaded - boring) - pepper \"steak\" and dumplings (the dumplings are tasty, but the \"steak\" is just dry pieces of So Soya, a dehydrated commercial vegetarian product that needs to be soaked in water prior to cooking - boring AND gross) - tempeh ribs (no rib-like texture here at all, but it's tempeh so I should have known better) - portion sizes have dropped (less waffle than you used to get in the unchicken and waffles, sides are smaller than they used to be, and sandwiches at a neighboring table looked smaller on my last visit too)  All told, I will continue to go here because it's the best (and only) of its kind in Toronto. But other than a few menu items, it doesn't hold a candle to the likes of Red Bamboo in New York. And I'm not sure I can ever fully forgive them for serving me rehydrated So Soya and calling it \"steak\".  A note on the complaints of some other reviewers:  First, I've never myself found any dish overly salty. Second, and possibly related, THIS IS NOT A HEALTHY RESTAURANT. Go to Live or Fresh if you want vegan macrobiotic greens seasoned with lemon juice and kimchi and sustainability and bullsh*t. This is not the place for you, and thinking that all vegan restaurants need to cater to health-conscious eaters is stupid."}
{"text":"Ordered the philly cheese steak and it was delicious and very filling worth the 15 dollars. Enjoyed the ambience as well little hole in the wall."}
{"text":"been to the Hogtown four or five times now and between me and my party members, have had most things on the menu. last time I went noticed the \"jack and slaw\" was gone which is disappointing as it was my favorite - so juicy and meaty and unique. moving down the sandwich list: the reuben is solid and so is the po'boy, but the bread could be of better quality for both sandwiches. the chickpea salad/sandwich are also both quite fine, but nothing I couldn't make at home. fries are thin and delicious to be sure, but why bother with them when there are beautiful garlicky collards to enjoy instead? a rare treat!  better veg*n wings to be had down the street at Clinton's or in the market at King's Cafe. better veg*n nachos down the street at Disgraceland. the iced tea was truly awful - but maybe my southern roots spoil me in that area.  the service is always pretty mediocre. attentive for the most part, but would it kill these people to smile? it feels like they're doing me a favor whenever I'm there.  the food is solid, make no mistake. and as a longtime veg*n who grew up in the American South, it was wonderful to be able to eat some of these dishes again. but they still have a ways to go before I'd take my carnivorous family there for a night out.  bottom line: you're better off at Hot Beans (sister takeaway joint in Kensington) but I still love Hogtown's style."}
{"text":"We went here twice over the course of our 24-hour time period in Toronto. You GOTTA get the Unchicken & Waffles!! Unchicken Caesar Wrap was really good, too - loved the fakin' bacon addition. Service is minimalistic, friendly & to the point - not much discourse or overly-sweet deliveries...just the \"meat & potatoes,\" if you will ;)    Loved the pop album covers on the teal walls. Pleeeeease Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em!!!  Biggest regret: not trying their poutine. Why. WHY. WHYYYEEE?!?!?!  When you visit, walk two blocks to TBC for vegan donuts!!"}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend who is vegetarian and has been asking to go for some time. We ordered the Shitake Fried Clams ($8). She ordered the Hot Roast Beef Sandwich ($12) and I got the Peppersteak and Dumplings ($13).   The portions were generous and we both had trouble finishing everything. The Coleslaw that came with the sandwich wasn't great, but that's my only complaint. The beer gravy was very tasty, the chipotle ranch dipping sauce did not survive for very long, and the seitan was really well done.   As far as vegan restaurants go, this is the best one out there. I prefer it to King's Cafe in Kensington, but both are pretty good. After that there's really no competition.   Service was great while we were there. Water was always full, staff helpful without being annoying. Even the little kid that was crying me didn't bother me."}
{"text":"While I've enjoyed my food here, I find it's slightly overpriced in relation to the quality of its ingredients and atmosphere. In particular, the corn waffle, sauce, and collard greens served with the \"Unchicken and Waffles\" are of seemingly low quality. Decent service and a good time overall, but the food could be better."}
{"text":"As a vegan, I have heard great things by people who have reviewed this eatery, and by coworkers. I decided to give it a shot, and I was pleasantly surprised. I had the unchicken, sweet potato mash, collard greens and waffles. My mother, had the same thing as myself, except she had a side of macaroni and cheese.   We ordered the Shitake mushroom \"clams\" for a starter, and these were delicious. Very filling, and a large quantity. The dip was great, and went along really well with the mushrooms. Give it a try if you ever go.   The unchicken were crisp, and hot. They tasted almost like real chicken, and I'm sure that people who aren't vegans, would have loved the food here as well. The sweet potato mash was fluffy and warm, and was a wonderful side to the meal. The collard greens were not bitter, and had a garlic glaze of some sort, I enjoyed them. And the waffles were mind blowing, I truly did indulge.   My mother's dish was also well made, except she and I could agree that the mac n' cheese had an acquired taste. They were very sour, and the taste of vinegar was over powering. She struggled to eat it all, and said that combining it with other foods made it taste better and dilute the sour flavor.   The water, came in quaint water bottles, but it was room temperature, maybe even warm. If it was refrigerated, it would have been a lot more thirst-quenching.   The service, was impeccable. The people who work there are very sweet, and inviting. They're all smiles, and they check on you, and get your order fast. Really happy with the service.   The place is very easy to miss, it has a tiny little sign which says \"hog town vegan's\", so you must be careful when searching for it!"}
{"text":"Pros:  Delicious food, the new location is 2 times bigger than the old one, fast service,   Cons: The price is a bit steep. I would only come here once in a while to treat myself."}
{"text":"I have cravings coming back regularly for their unchicken burger and soy wings. They are absolutley delicious, and I am not even a vegan.   This restaurant proves that vegan food can have so many different flavors and textures, just like any other recipes that involve meat and dairy products.  I am not a big fan of their waffle and some other things on the menu, but that happens with other restaurants too, where you have your favourites and not so convinced dishes from the menu.  If you are looking for an amzing chicken burger in town, I definitely recommend Hogtown's unchicken burger!"}
{"text":"It was perfectly fine - not the best vegan restaurant I've ever been to, but a far stretch from the worst (looking at you Planta). Had the bacon cheeseburger and it was fine, a bit greasy and overslathered in ketchup but the texture was nice. My date's mac and cheese was completely lacking in flavour however, and the service could've been better (they were quite busy, but we still waited around 15 minutes to be acknowledged by our server). I'd go back if I were in the area and craving plant-based food, but I wouldn't make a special trip out here."}
{"text":"first time in myself (my girlfriend has been several times) and was so impressed by the experience.  arrived for brunch at 11:30 am when they opened and we were the second table, within 30 minutes the resturant was almost full and the 1 server working did an amazing job taking care of everyone.  started with the fresh donuts and then the full monty breakfast...holy amazing soft warm dough balls coated in cinnimon and sugar.  the breakfast was a fantastic range of flavors and it was the best vegan sausage i have ever eaten in toronto.  i am not vegan but my girlfriend is so i feel like i can speak for both sides as my diet is 50/50 between vegan and not and hands down that was the best vegan food i had in this city and probably in the top 5 for brunch in the city.  if you want great vegan food without the attitude and crap service that seems to accompany that type of resturant in toronto(ie queen st attitude) i highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I really like the vibe of this place. Our server was super friendly and had an awesome accent.  It's nice to feel welcome, especially on a first visit.  First impressions are everything in the restaurant business.  Food was creative and delicious.  Full disclaimer: I'm a meatatarian yet I really enjoyed my meatless appies and entree.  Nice selection of beers as well.  Gets crowded fast so you may have to wait for a table."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming here and it was great! Although when we first walked in we had to stand there by the door waiting for a server, then we had wait for people to leave (which didn't take long) it was just really awkward standing right next to a table of people eating. Other than that everything we ordered was delicious and even though it was a bit greasy I'm already planing on coming back!"}
{"text":"Who knew vegan could taste so good? Well, I guess vegans do.   Came here with a newly vegan friend and another friend who made an ill advised bet to not eat meat for a month.  We all left with more than filled, satisfied bellies and visions of what we would eat the next time we went.  Like many people have said, you don't even miss the fact that there is no meat.  I ordered the mac and cheese and it was delicious!  It was one of the cheesiest M&C I've ever had and it had a nice subtle kick to it.  The collard greens were perfectly cooked, but the sweet potato was on the sweet side.  I also ordered the chips and guacamole.  The salsa had a great spicy flavour, but the guac was a little bland.  A little salt would have made it great.  My boyfriend had the southern combo which had deep fried \"chicken\", mac and cheese and collard greens.  The \"chicken\" had a great crust to it and was nice and moist.  The plate erased any pre conceived notions of what vegan food is.  It definitely can be hearty, flavourful and comforting with a side of deep fried decadence.  The atmosphere is casual, but almost a bit too casual.  Personally, I think it could be a bit more pulled together.  However, in the end, the food is more than enough reason to come back.  Note: This place is cash only.  Personally I think that if you're going to have a restaurant where the bill could easily get over $100 for a group of 4, you need to have a credit or debit option."}
{"text":"Incredible. Simply incredible. As a vegan from a small-ish town (Halifax), I'm always blown away when I can get to a bigger city where my diet isn't a strange novelty.  The Hogtown Vegan, even in a city full of great food, completely blew me away. Everything is vegan (you are offered a choice of soy or almond milk with your coffee, for instance), and everything we tried was delicious.  We were briefly paralyzed by all the amazing-sounding choices on the menu. We eventually settled on vegan buffalo wings (tofu that's been battered, fried, and rolled in buffalo wing sauce, with a side of sunflower sour cream) and fries supremacy (fries covered in nacho \"cheese\" sauce, sunflower sour cream, with green onions and \"bacon bits\") to start.  Both were enormous, and life-changingly good. We were full after just eating those, but we were determined to tackle our meals anyway, knowing now that they would be worth it.  I got the reuben and my partner got the philly cheese steak. The seitan they used in both was hearty, with a great chewiness and texture. The sauces were amazing, and neither seemed even the slightest bit \"off\". They were both delicious and very, very filling.  This place is a complete gem. Like many smaller places in the city they're cash only, but they have an ATM, so it's no problem. The service was speedy (though we did get there 5 minutes after they opened on Saturday, so perhaps we were lucky), and the place was clean, with a nice diner atmosphere. Prices were completely reasonable, even fairly cheap.  I really can't recommend this place highly enough. Just try it!"}
{"text":"A lot of vegetarian/vegan places have food that not only is healthy, but also - unfortunately - tastes like it. Hogtown Vegan doesn't have that problem! It's all about comfort food here, and I was very pleased with my Philly cheese steak. The cheesy sauce was yummy!   The fries and the service were just decent, though, and the atmosphere wasn't my favorite. Hence, four stars."}
{"text":"I eat a mostly vegetarian diet. I don't really care if a meal has meat in it as long as it tastes good. We arrived Saturday night around 8:15 and didn't have a hard time getting a spot for two. We were able to look over the menu while waiting and knew exactly what we wanted to order. We order our drinks (get beer list) and our meals at the same time, chicken and waffles and the southern dish. We finished our drinks and waited another 15 minutes before I could flag someone down for a refill and to ask about our food. At that point we had been waiting about 40 minutes. It would have been nice if someone could have come around to inform us that the kitchen was a little slow for whatever reason. The food was pretty good and I have no complains about it. The un-chicken was great and the greens and mash were spot on. The only down side was the service. We had 2 meals and 4 drinks and the bill came to about $60, which isn't that bad. I will definitely go back to try a few different dishes, but expectations will be low on the service."}
{"text":"Had a really hard time finding the restaurant,  we were standing across the street from where it was and couldn't find it.  There are no signs.  The food here was excellent.  We all ordered the pulled pork or the burgers and they were well received by the whole group.  The 3 star rating is because our server was terrible.  She seemed irritated to take our orders, plopped the food down, and before we could order any dessert brought out the bills.  She was very abrupt and we felt like we had overstayed our welcome.   We we're actually pretty disappointed because we were enjoying our food and had planned to stay for dessert.  I would probably come  again for the food but not for the service nor the ambience. It's a very plain establishment."}
{"text":"GO HERE. NOW. All the delicious southern-style fare you desire in vegan form without any pretentious or snobby attitudes. Both servers who helped us out were friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. As for the food... I'm salivating at the thought, and know I will return on my next trip to Toronto. I had the pulled pork- HUGE portion, great texture, and loved the BBQ sauce and Cole slaw they topped it with. My fiancé had the southern platter. The chicken strips were awesome, loved the creaminess of the Mac n cheese and though I didn't try the collard greens, I'll take his word for it that they were great. Definitely worth a trip!"}
{"text":"Good idea for a vegan restaurant, BUT very bland and tasteless. The idea is achieved much more elegantly across the street at Disgraceland.   It's similar to the food I made in high-school when I didn't know how to make good vegetarian food.   Won't go back. Overpriced garbage."}
{"text":"Excellent food! The poutine was great, the bacon cheeseburger was delicious, the mac and cheese was fantastic, and the chicken and waffles were amazing. The beer was cold and the atmosphere was friendly."}
{"text":"Came in at about 4pm on a Tuesday and it was still consistently busy which is a great sign. Walked from the downtown core which took about 40 mins and this place was so worth the walk. Had the fries supremacy, tasted so much better than I remember Taco Bell did as a child. Wings are tasty, and burger was incredible. Everything tastes so much better than the meat/dairy versions. At least this is my opinion as a fairly new vegan. Service was great, server was pleasant and attentive which is rare in Toronto these days. Overall 5/5 can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"IN.SANE. So delicious. Seriously take any one of your  'I could never be vegan' friends here and you'll have a convert on your hands. Sure, it's 'junk food,' but it is delicious!! Such a treat."}
{"text":"Hogtown vegan is a great restaurant.  The wait on Friday night can be fairly long but it's worth it.  I had the unchicken burger and couldn't believe it was vegan,  keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Pretty greasy, not all that good in my opinion but all my veggie and vegan friends thought it was amazing - so I guess if you've given up the real thing - this place probably tastes amazing.    With regards to someone elses cockroach comment - ridiculous!  For anyone who has ever worked in a restaurant - when roaches are apparent during the day it normally means that the business has sprayed recently and the roaches are coming out to die.  Its downtown Toronto - do you know how hard it is to keep every single bug out of 100 year old buildings.  Perhaps the server should have handled it differently for your sake but totally unfair to leave a negative review for it."}
{"text":"It had 'vegan' in the title so it was suggested (while I appreciate the attempt, there is a little more depth to culinary choices even when with a high-maintenance eater).  I left wishing there was more to the menu. Good location, but the vegan diner is not my taste so what others might love was lost on me. I had a salad of some description, sadly just on romaine. Other dishes seemed lack-luster too.   Note: cash only, come prepared or use the ATM machine on site.   End of story: no inspiration for a return visit. Also, I'm the wrong audience for it."}
{"text":"Vegan or not you should try this place.   I had the unchicken sandwich and im serious when I say this, it tastes like chicken.  My side the chili cheese fries.. UN-FKN-REAL sooo good.. going back for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian but this was great. I had the unchicken and waffles. It was like eating into chicken nuggets, which is a surprise. Waffles was delicious."}
{"text":"I have reviewed Hog Town before and every time I go it seems to get worse. I love that there is a vegan spot like Hog Town but to be honest there is no consistency at all. Every time you go things taste different, cooked different, and even their \"chicken\" has changed now for the worse.   The atmosphere is not great... matter of fact it's actually not a good atmosphere at all. The music is horrible.  The staff wipes the chairs and then the tables with the same exact cloth... that CANNOT be sanitary whatsoever!   I have stopped going to Hog Town all together at this point because I find myself paying for food that I don't eat because it just isn't good."}
{"text":"My non-vegetarian friend recommended Hogtown Vegan to me and I wasn't disappointed. It's a nice small place with a good atmosphere. I had the pulled-\"pork\" sandwhich with fries which was delicious! My girlfriend had the unchicken waffles and kale. I don't think I would try that combination again but I enjoyd being able to experiment."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out during a recent trip, and found it to be rather adequate, but lacking in a few areas.   Service was pretty slow to get going, and it wasnt that busy in there, but the service was friendly at least.   I decided to go with their signature unchicken and waffles, and while the fake chicken was very good, the waffle itself was rather dry. the syrup on their was good, but overall this dish wasnt something i couldnt do on my own, which is ok, because this is comfort food, right? The collards were simply just collards, and the sweet potato side dish was pretty good,   My dining partner had the Bacon Cheeseburger, which tasted pretty good, and was probably the best thing i tasted, but it was too very generic. The most dissapointing thing that I ate was the Mac. A lot of people rave about it, but i dont get it. I make a recipe that a friend gave me that has a lot better flavor than this one did. Maybe it was an off day on that. The noodles were also a bit tougher than id like for mac, i had to add hot sauce to this for some flavor, it was just very bland.   Overall, id give it another shot, but would probably get some of the other things on their menu that seem a bit more creative. Its a solid place, but I wasnt blown away."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourite spots in the city. The food is fucking amazing, and the space is adorable - it has a very Austin Texas vibe. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the service is lousy. I go here quite often because the food is so fantastic (sadly they took one of my favourite items off the menu - the sweet potato sandwich, it was the beest), but the wait staff never smiles, are always lackadaisical, etc. Not super prompt, if you want anything you'll probably have to wave your arms around for a few minutes.   If you can deal with that then get your ass over here! (And really the service isn't the worst I've seen, but for such a great place I was hoping they'd totally nail it in every way possible, including awesome service. Sadly no.) The food has a very down South vibe, and it's all lovely. I hate fake meat but their unchicken burger is to die for. The mac n' cheese leaves me weak in the knees. The sweet potato mash and collard greens are also welcome additions to the menu!   I wish they had some non-chocolatey desserts on offer, but whatever, I'll cope. Love love love this place. I can't speak highly enough of the food, it's delicious! Bring your non-vegan friends here, seriously... they'll be hooked!  EDIT: //// I went back recently and the service seems to have improved, and I really want to give this place five stars, BUT I had their donut holes off their brunch menu and they were TERRIBLE. They tasted like nothing, and cost me $8. For like, 5 donut holes. Vegan donuts do not have to taste like shit. I've made amazing vegan donuts from scratch, if I do say so myself, and Hot Beans (of which this place is a sister restaurant?) used to have phenomenal lime-coconut vegan donuts. Why not just use that recipe? Seriously. I miss 'em. Protip: avoid these overpriced donut holes that taste like nada."}
{"text":"I so wish that I lived closer to this place. It's in my dreams. Ok, ok calm down!!  I've tried the Chicken and Waffles, Mac 'n Cheese, and the Pulled Pork Sammy and all were incredible. Like, I cant even!!!   My Australian BF (heavy meat eater) loves this place too and actually requests to go there for dinner dates.   Love, love, love. I heart you Hogtown Vegan!! That is all. xo"}
{"text":"Last night I went to Hogtown Vegan with 2 of my friends for dinner.  As a foodie who is neither vegan, vegetarian, or gluten-free, I had a delicious and satisfying meal without missing meat at all.   I wouldn't say that Hogtown Vegan is a health-food destination, but I think this restaurant is really fantastic for diners with lactose-intolerance who can't normally have dishes like poutine, cheesy nachos, creamy coleslaw, or chocolate mousse without having to pop a Lactaid pill.  I ended up ordering the Pulled \"Pork\" Sandwich ($12.00) off their gluten-free menu.  This meant that the BBQ 'pork' (which is actually textured vegetable protein or 'TVP') was served on a bed of garlicky collard greens (instead of a bun) and topped with coleslaw with fries on the side.    I was wowed by this dish.  I've had TVP before but it's always been prepared in a way that tastes a little sweet.  I much preferred how tangy the BBQ sauce made it.  The different textures of the crunchy coleslaw, spongy-squelchy TVP, and slick collard greens was great.  And the fries were a nice crispy contrast to everything else on the plate.   The TVP didn't actually remind me of pulled pork, but I don't really eat vegetarian meat substitutes with the expectation that it tastes like the meat for which it's named.  I think it's better to just appreciate the food for what it is.   I ate about half my food and the packed the rest away in the Tupperware I brought with me.  I was a little worried that I would look odd pulling out Tupperware at the table (I'm trying to watch my portion sizes), but the waitress noticed seemed cool with it.   For dessert one of my friends and I split the Chocolate Mousse Parfait ($7.00).  It comes in a glass where the vegan mousse is layered with crushed peanuts and Oreo cookie crumbs (obviously not a gluten-free dessert).  The mousse was very rich and sweet.  I don't have much of a sweet tooth, but this was great because the peanuts and cookie crumbs offered a hint of salt to break up the sweetness.  I also really liked the nubly-crunchiness against the silky mousse.  Hogtown Vegan is a great concept for a restaurant in a lovely space and with helpful staff.  You might have to wait in line a while to get a table, but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Full disclosure:  I'm UBER unvegan! While I do get really excited about fruits & veggies, I'm a total carnivore at heart.  FOOD: What sorcery is this!!!???  No, but really, how is this vegan?  My friend & I devoured our nachos & 'unchicken' waffles in 3.2 seconds.  SO GOOD.    DRINKS: Their Dark & Stormy was pretty decent (extra gingery).  However, my friend was unimpressed with her Caesar.  DESSERT: While we were completely stuffed by this point we 'forced' ourselves to try the Deep-Friend Banana Split - one of my better life choices.  I'm an official convert to coconut milk ice cream!  VERDICT: Do not walk in expecting healthy vegan food.  This is really really really ridiculously good-tasting (and unhealthy) vegan bar food.  While the atmosphere doesn't exactly scream 'clean', the booths are cozy and the service impeccable.  My only constructive criticism would be to up the food presentation slightly.  I know it's only bar food, but I like the things going in my mouth to be instagram worthy.  Yes, you read that correctly."}
{"text":"The positives: The \"chicken\" wings were absolutely delicious. Awesome sauce, nice and crispy. The fries were decent. The deep fried banana split was a deep fried banana split and its hard to make that anytgimg but awesome. The 'chicken' in the affle dish was great and crispy like the wings. The burger bun was a standout in that dish. Service was friendly and laid back.   The 'could be better': The burger was just okay, there are better veggies burgers in the city. The tofu bacon wasn't 'transformed' the way many other items on the menu truly are. Beer could have been colder. People in our party had some concerns- steak and dumplings was over the top salty, slaw was boring.  The sweet potato mash was overly sweet."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a must try for Vegans, Vegetarians, and omnivores and everyone else! We dined at this \"gem\" this week and we were very well taken care of the minute we walked into the restaurant.  The food and the staff were friendly and knowledgeable to assist in any way they could. The food was plentiful and very tasty.  The macaroni and cheese was delectable as was the homemade hamburg.  Kurt was our waitstaff and we could not of asked for more of a professional individual. What a great combination of excalibur food, staff and ambience.  Find your way to the Hogtown Vegan as fast as you can!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great vegan versions of soul food. Great burgers and pulled pork sandwiches. The chicken and waffles were amazing. I will be back as often as I can!"}
{"text":"Arrived on a Monday at 4pm with a friend and right away the restaurant had a very casual, homey vibe and looked rather spacious for its fairly small exterior. Our server was very friendly and efficient seeing as she was also managing 4 other tables. My friend and I were figuratively starving so we split an order of their supremacy fries ($8) to start. Sooooo delicious! I then got a house lemonade ($3) which I highly recommend! while my friend got a bottled grapefruit juice ($3). For the entrees, I had the unchicken and waffles ($14) and my friend had their southern combo ($14). The dishes have the same unchicken and sauteed collard greens which I might add has a ton of garlic. I love garlic but there was way too much and it really took over the whole dish. The sweet potato mash was surprisingly too sweet, as if sugar or syrup was added and my friend agreed. However, I did enjoy the waffle which had a nice chew and crispy exterior. And the most surprising thing... their unchicken strips were crunchy on the outside and moist like actual chicken! And I'm not even vegan.. nor was my friend but we were totally amazed. The only side the southern combo had that I didn't was a heaping portion of mac and cheese which I thought tasted really good as well. This is actual comfort food made for anyone! It would probably become my second home if I were to ever transition into veganism because the imitations are done exceptionally well and will probably blow your mind like it did ours.   Overall, the only reason I took a star off is because of the overly pronounced flavours in the food but I would definitely come back again! As two non-vegans, we came here with an open mind and left with an extremely full and satisfied stomach."}
{"text":"Just crazy/awesome.  Somebody's insane vegan dream of serving the most meat-riddled artery-clogging dishes possible and making them all vegan.  The menu literally is like \"burger, rueben, cheesesteak, pulled pork...\"  I'd give them an extra point just for technical difficulty.  That being said, I really liked my unchicken club sandwich.  And I'm not vegan or veg."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, first time got a burger, it was decent for a vegan burger, no complaints.  But the second time I went with my girlfriend and waited 15 minutes for a table because the waitress didn't want us taking their four seated table, so we had to wait for a two seater to become available. We gave up and left and the four top remained unoccupied. Holding out for a bigger group is just bad business, won't be back."}
{"text":"So I was pretty stoked about this place upon hearing about it. Vegan comfort food was a brilliant idea for a restaurant I had myself several years ago, so it's good to see the secret society who filters ideas wirelessly from my brain (Illuminati?) putting them to good use!  We were out of town for their grand opening, but got to stop in for their second week of operation. The first thing we noticed was the heat. Dang. No AC during a Toronto heat wave. It was incredibly uncomfortable. I ordered the rueben, which I'd say was dang tasty. Reminded me of the vegan Montreal smoked meat sandwich I had back at Aux Vivres in Montreal. The fries were shoestringy, like a bird's nest of fries. Not my preference, but something different from the usual, anyway.  Our second time we went was a day after they had tweeted that the AC was fixed. Rapture! Still incredibly hot in the city, we showed our faces there and were met with disappointment again - there was no working AC. What the heck? I ordered the chicken and waffles and my dining partner ordered the sausage sliders. I can't remember which sides we ordered, but I do remember they were delivered incorrectly; her's on my plate, mine on her's. I think the sausage patties they use are Sol cuisine, and I can't remember the chicken brand, but I do know it's not prepared in-house. That's just one of those little things I find disappointing in a veggie restaurant. Yes, those patties are great, but I can buy them in a store myself. The biscuits and gravy were all pretty tasty.  Anyway, bottom line, it was simply too hot to enjoy the meal both times I've been there. The food itself is decent, but I don't like the mark-up on store-bought veggie meats. I do recommend the rueben, which is house-made seitan. Nothing wrong with that!  I'll give these guys another chance when things cool down, and I don't have to risk heat stroke.  In the meantime, I've gotta get on top of preventing my great ideas from leaking out of my brain. I think tin foil hats are a little passé. Maybe I could re-route my mental traffic through a proxy brain in Russia or something..."}
{"text":"Nice to have a vegan restaurant that is not based on bowls and wraps and salads. Sometimes I just want to eat something fried and bad for me. I had the southern combo and it was delicious. Easy atmosphere, service was pretty quick. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"definitely not an upscale place, very laid-back environment. with AMAZING food. great customer service. and very reasonable prices.  and the portions are BIG. we had an unforgettable experience and definitely will be back.  :)"}
{"text":"I went to Hogtown Vegan for the second time last night and had a pretty good meal. I had the southern plate as I was interested in getting in some greens and wanted to try the mac and cheese. Collards hit the spot and the mac and cheese was delicious. The plate also came with soy chicken fingers or whatever they were. Still tasty, though I'm not a huge fan of any 'fake' meats if you know what I mean. The strange thing about Hogtown is that the menu is littered with all those dishes revolving around the fake meats, they don't have any burgers or anything else that is plant based, all soy.   Southern, vegan comfort food is definitely what this place is about. I would come back solely for the mac and cheese."}
{"text":"The place was busy and I feel sorry for the three servers who had to manage it.  That said, everything was substandard: a foul-tasting ceasar (bad tomato juice, cheap vodka?), an uninspired draft beer (dirty lines?), very greasy deep-fried mushrooms, a humdrum tofu patty, so-so fries ... they must've been doing something right at some point because the place was very busy ... pity the servers, who clearly were working very hard to accommodate the crowd."}
{"text":"Although I wasn't wowed by Hot Beans - this new spot by the same people really impressed me.   The space was bright and clean - something I'm sure that took a lot converting it from whatever pile of garbage was there before it and full of young, semi groomed and tattooed people.   I opted for the sausage vegan sliders on biscuits with mushroom gravy and a pile of fries. The gravy was delicious - as was the rest of the plate. It was as good as meat filled food (fyi vegans: meat filled food tastes pretty good).   I sampled the collared greens as well - they tasted like...thanksgiving dinner. I'm not sure why that is. But they did. Next time I'll go for a big plate of those, too. The bigger mains go for about $12. The restaurant is cash only but there is an ATM.  Pleasant! I felt like I was eating unhealthy vegan food. Very satisfying."}
{"text":"Hogtown offers vegan southern comfort food at it's finest - from deep fried phish and chips to breaded unchicken with creamy garlic collard greens, you'll probably always find something here you'd like for lunch.  The brunch menu is small, but what they lack in variety they make up for in quality.  Hogtown rocks the vegan unchicken like no other place I've been to, if you're going here you definitely have to have it with their waffles and cinnamon syrup.  Staff are friendly and food is served fairly quickly.  Only downside is that there's no A/C and they keep it hot here during the winter so it can be a touch uncomfortable, and if you don't come at the right time it can be hard to get seats."}
{"text":"Tried the 'unchicken and waffles' and 'southern combo'. The best thing on the plate was the waffle and the mac and cheese, respectively. Both these items rival their non-vegan counterparts in similarly rated restaurants. I found the waffle plate too sweet (with the syrup AND a sweet potato mash side), it definitely needed some balance.   The unchicken, which I imagine is great for vegans, just tasted like frozen chicken fingers to me. I'm not vegan and I have other options, but I see the appeal in the vegan 'meat' options here for vegans.   It's a good bar menu with some interesting draught options. I would go back if I had vegan company, and probably get the mac and cheese again or try the chilli cheese fries."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by the food here, as I am of the annoying carnivore variety usually skeptical of vegan takes on comfort food.  This place blew me away. I had the mac and cheese, which I basically gobbled down, plus the Unchicken burger which was fantastic. I'm a fan of tofu as it is, but had no idea it could taste that delightfully unhealthy (the lesson: when smothered with mayo and deep fried, all things are delicious).  The service was 'meh.' I wasn't especially impressed, as it took a while to get the attention of our waiter, but I'm getting used to that kind of service in Toronto's plethora of hipster-y restaurants. Not a bad thing, just something to be aware of if you are allergic to that style of trendiness."}
{"text":"really yummy food, it seems toronto gets an A+ for their vegan food, i want to move here just so i can get the chicken and waffles at this place for breakfast every morning. haven't got to try the lunch/dinner menu but definitely going back to try it. the unchicken was so good i had it the other day and am craving it now like crazy!!! love it :)"}
{"text":"Once in a while I won't mind having vegetarian or vegan food, but I don't think that lifestyle will ever be for me. Came here on a Saturday night with a party of 10. The place isn't too big, and our party arrived at 630pm and didnt end up getting seated til 8pm.   I ended up ordering the \"beef\" and dumplings stew for dinner, which came with a side of collard greens and sweet potato mash. Everything aside from the \"beef\" - which im not too sure what it was, tasted great. Maybe I'm just not a fan of the texture.   I did try my friends fried \"chicken\" and that actually tasted very good. If I were to come back I'd order that instead. Also tried some mac and cheese but it had a vinegary/plastic taste.   The wait staff was very understanding of our long wait time and actually ended up kicking out a table that was just sitting around. Our food came out pretty quickly which was nice since we waited what seemed like forever."}
{"text":"Tried the philly cheese-steak and it was very flavorful and tasty. Very satisfying!  I'll definitely go back, I want to try everything on the menu lol."}
{"text":"I've been back a number of times now and my love for this place just keeps growing! Today I had brunch there for the first time. SUPER YUMMY.   I enjoyed the BLT on rye, with a caesar salad, while the bf had the un-chicken waffles, with a caesar salad.  My tofu-bacon was very nicely flavoured and sliced thinly, which gave it a nice, but flexible crunch. As always, the fresh ingredients, and the house-made mayo perfectly accented the sandwich.  The caesar salad at this place is definitely a favourite of mine.  The un-chicken waffles were yummy, as always. Both the bf and I found the un-chicken was cooked to a nice denseness, not hard and rubbery like I usually find fake-meats, and the waffles were nice and fluffy. Tasted like a combination of waffles and pancakes with a hint of cornbread.  I've found this is a good place to take skeptical, non-vegans who are afraid anything without meat or dairy will be icky.  Will go back to eat more, and more, and more, and more..."}
{"text":"Seriously great comfort food. The phish n chips, caesar salad and \"fries supreme\" are all guaranteed to be good. Only thing I've ever disliked was their Bloody Marys, too bland."}
{"text":"When I saw photos of the food and found out that they are the same proprietors as Hot Beans, I knew I had to go!   Like most, this was my first visit. For my friend who accompanied me, it was her second visit.  We started with the fries supremacy with the secret sauce. They were amazing - the fries were thin and crispy - think hickory sticks - with the tangy vegan sour cream on top. how could one not enjoy the deep fried goodness?  I had the unchicken and waffles. I'm not usually a fan of sweet things, but the maple syrup wasn't overbearing and was a good addition to the 'chicken'. It had a good consistency - not rubber - and the maple syrup added to the taste of the relatively tasteless - seitan. Probably not much different than real chicken - which I can't really remember the taste. It reminded me of my days in Arkansas eating chicken fried chicken (which should be on their menu!). My friend had the garbanzo bean salad. It reminded me of potato salad - which I'm a big fan of.  This place is basically southern style comfort food with a vegan twist. I'll definitely be back when I'm in town next!"}
{"text":"The Chicken and waffles were so good I ended up getting them again when I went back the 2nd time. I think next time I'll have to try something else but its just sooo hard to pick."}
{"text":"Great vegan comfort food. Faux meats of all types. Pork, chicken beef and fish. Nothing has disappointed me. The best are the fake chicken tenders with buffalo sauce and ranch dip. Service is always reasonable. The vegan Caesar salad was also very good"}
{"text":"For a non vegetarian to eat here it was a pretty new experience. I loved it, actually! We tried all the classic items and recommend this as a good vegan/vegeterian place to take visiting vegans to :)"}
{"text":"I recently went here for brunch. Service was good and the food was good enough to make me want to try more of the menu. The omlet was good, but only because of the caramelized onions and mushrooms. The tofu rancheros was delicious! Definitely looking forward to trying things from the lunch and dinner menu."}
{"text":"All I have to say about this place is: Mean, Mean, Mean. (in a good way of course)  Like others have said, this isn't a place to go to feel better about your nutrition, it's by no means healthy.  But there's tons of salad restaurants out there for that.  This place satisfies vegan soul food like few others have done.  NYC used to have a place of this caliber but it closed, I hope Hogtown Vegan does not go the same route.  The ambiance is not amazing, do not take a date here, it doesn't exactly eschew 'romantic'.  And neither will him or her watching you plow into some 'chicken' and waffles.  But style points aside, this food is good.  I had the chicken and waffles, and that was an unmitigated success, waffles are often hit-and-miss at vegan places and this was a bull's eye.  My wife had the phish and chips and they were all the good parts of fish and chips without the bones, and death and all.  The service was good, not amazing or anything, but really fit the decor.  The parfait was good, I've had better and other places, but by the end of the meal, it didn't matter and didn't detract in the slightest.  If I had to find a complaint, i would say their hot sauce is nothing special, but I cannot imagine that is anyone's determining factor for some vegan soul-food.  I would HIGHLY recommend going here, just to try it out.  Next time I'm in Toronto, I'll be there!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for vegan comfort food. I have been really satisfied with everything I've had here. Don't go here if you're on a diet, though-- most stuff on th menu isn't all that healthy. However, it is a great place if you want to indulge in some stuff you miss after going vegan. I love love love the Southern combo (collard greens, unchicken, and mac and cheese) and my boyfriend and I often split the mexican fries supreme for our appetizer. The brunch menu is excellent as well. I recommend this restaurant to all of my vegan friends!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite vegan restaurant in Toronto, but definitely one of the best. Most things on the menu are fantastic, but there are a few things I've tried that were pretty mediocre. They definitely know how to do vegan desserts though, and their fried apple pie is to die for."}
{"text":"Food was really good. I had the \"Big Hog\" burger with two soy patties. Tasted very good and filled me up. Fries Supremacy on the side, actually kinda let me down as the cheese sauce didn't really taste great with the \"sour cream\" and scallions.  Buffalo wings were awesome, always get the buffalo wings.  Atmosphere is certainly alright. My group of 5 was sat somewhat awkwardly with a little folding chair at the end of a booth. That wasn't really amazing. Otherwise restaurant was good, decent atmosphere, also a decent drink selection."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. I have been several times, and always leave satisfied.  Don't worry if you're not vegan, this place will satisfy all your meaty, cheesy cravings nonetheless.  Portions are pretty big, I normally can't finish my portion, let alone have dessert - but when I have saved room, it has been worth it.  My favourites? - mac & cheese (although it hasn't been as good as when they first started out) - unchicken wings - ruben - unchicken & waffles - fries!   Decor is cute and servers are friendly - but remember to bring cash!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here for dinner during a trip to Toronto and was blown away.  Had the Southern Combo while my sister had the Unchicken and Waffles (we're basic, what can I say?) and both dishes were totally delish.  I'm so happy I had leftovers to enjoy the next day too, because this meal was so good I wanted to relive it.  Mac n Cheese was the perfect texture and consistency of vegan mac, and the faux chicken was so good that my omnivore sister actually approved as well.  This place makes me wish I lived closer!"}
{"text":"We eat at the Hogtown Vegan a lot. Probably more than we should, given that it's vegan junk food. Delicious, wonderful vegan junk food mind you. My 10-year-old can devour the bac'n cheezburger in one go, and it's his favourite. I love the tortilla salad, the fish n chips, the burgers, the specials (please bring back that jerk chick'n salad!!). Fries are sometimes a little too greasy but that's probably to be expected in a place like this. One thing I absolutely hate though, is the ambience. There is none. It's loud in there during busy times. So loud you cannot hear someone speaking, even loudly, directly across from you. For this reason I give it four stars instead of five."}
{"text":"There has been  quite a few occasions that I have wanted to leave my meal at Hogtown due to really horrible service that ruined their amazing vegan food. Today for brunch, I didn't even get a chance to order before their unwelcoming service upset us so much that we actually did leave before eating. Their food is amazing but is completely ruined by the hostile service of several employees. We opted for Disgraceland's vegan brunch when we left Hogtown - way friendlier service...by a mile."}
{"text":"This is vegan comfort food at it's deep fried finest. If I ate here regularly I would be obese, but man, this is the splurge meal of the century. Anything with the 'unchicken' is a guaranteed winner; my absolute favourite is the unchicken buffalo sandwich with fries and a side of mushrooms gravy. The mac n cheese is a great little sidekick, too. I'd describe the ambiance as cute, comfortable, and casual. A good low-pressure first date spot but also the ideal place to take your longtime hunny to shove delicious carbs in your faces without speaking until all the salty, crispy, fatty yumyums are in your tummies."}
{"text":"Yes.  This is deep fried vegan junk food.  AT ITS FINEST.   I've eaten at quite a number of places like this, but this one kicked so much more ass.   Portions are huge.  Fries are bangin.  The chicken burger with pickles.  So. Good.  Mashed yams? Collards! Macn cheese!  Loved it.    Good service and nice enough atmosphere.   Wish they had milk shakes and floats.  Desserts were nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"This is a really great place. I went for lunch with a friend and the place was empty, so the food and service was very fast.  I ordered the bacon cheeseburger with fries; it was so good! The \"bacon\" didn't do much, but the burger itself was really delicious. I was impressed.  I'd recommend this to anyone trying to find vegan alternatives. It tastes exactly like other pub food. I can't wait to go back and explore other options on their menu."}
{"text":"The heart wants what it wants. If you're going to eat a vegan meal that blows through hundreds of calories with every bite, this is a delicious place to do it. I had the poutine and southern plate, and everything was extremely filling, decadent, and satisfying. It's the opposite of health food. It's treat yoself food. That said, I know they have a few salads, but I feel like it's kinda like how McDonald's has salads... they're there, but nahhhh.  Service was so friendly and genuine. The guys working here seemed like they truly cared about making my first Hogtown visit from across the continent a success. I would love to come back with an even bigger appetite."}
{"text":"I don't understand the concept of faking meat and chicken and seafood. That's the main problem with this failed culinary approach. There's some great vegan food in the world, but this food sucks.   The unchicken and waffles are a disaster. The waffles are like cardboard. Absolutely flavorless and probably frozen. The syrup is like yellow water. The greens were good, honestly, but overall, this dish makes for one ugly plate.  Started with chips and guacamole and pico de gallo. EVERYTHING was bland. The pico de gallo was as spicy as jicama (ie not at all) and watery. You have to work hard to offer bland chips and guacamole.   At least they have beer, so you can drink a lot and forget you ate here."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I don't know how they have such a low average review!   I have tried everything on the menu and I DIE every time. It's so amazing and that something vegan can be so freaking delicious, and they rock that to the end. The chicken and waffles are so delicious, definitely my favourite.   Gets pretty packed often which leads me to Green Thai Chili sometimes if I'm super hungry and don't want to wait.   Great drink selection and the desserts are KILLER. My table often orders all of them to split and we never regret it!"}
{"text":"Let me preempt this by declaring my love of meat and meat by-products. Done.   So, we came here for a friend's birthday dinner and I was, admittedly, a little skeptical. I have to say though, this meal was damn, *ahem, surprisingly good.  Everyone praises their Unchicken and Waffles. I don't mean to jump on the wagon, but it's all true. Yes, I could eat them everyday. No, I didn't miss out on the fact that it was mock chicken. Yes, there breading is crazy delicious. And yes, the collared greens were an excellent addition. The only flaw I noticed was the sweet potato mash. With the syrup combo for the waffles, turned out a little sweet for my liking."}
{"text":"I am a meat and fish eater. I eat animals and will not stop. However, I eat less of them for environmental reasons and for health. I do have vegan and vegetarian friends and I gladly take them to this place. Let's face it. Quality-wise, it's the vegan equivalent of the Lakeview. Really good. I was skeptical about Daiya \"cheese\" but it gives their fries and nachos a wonderful taste. The fries are great and worthy of any diner. One of my guests had the fake roast beef sandwich and it was apparently awesome. I always have reservations about soy, but their soy burger was surprisingly light and tasty. I still love Fresh, buy this is a great alternative  Prices are reasonable, service is friendly and competent. Atmosphere is very casual. Above all, the Hogtown Vegan is what I always look for: a good restaurant."}
{"text":"I treated a meat eater for his birthday at Hogtown Vegan and he teased me that he ate before since he knew I was taking him to a vegan restaurant.  When his meal arrived, and after the first bite or two, I could tell that he would feel full fast. In the end, he appeared surprised and impressed, and he really enjoyed the meal.  My husband and I also enjoyed our meals. My hubby is also into eating meat but gave rave reviews on his meal complete with sound effects."}
{"text":"The staff were friendly and the menu looked promising, offering pub-fare with vegan ingredients. Sweet.   We dive in, going for the buffalo wings, bacon cheeseburger, chicken sandwich, coleslaw and poutine.  The wings came first and tasted great, looks and feels like wings, also came with very green and very fresh celery sticks! I've never had wings with celery sticks that were THAT green!   The poutine didn't taste right, gravy was a bit strange, hard to put my finger on it, the \"cheese\" didn't really add to the dish and could have been omitted, overall was too salty. Fries were over cooked brown and soaked with oil.  Coleslaw was not punchy enough.  Burgers and sandwiches were pretty decent, though after already eaten the tofu wings the chicken sandwich wasn't all that different. The house mayo was too greasy, but the sesame seed buns were excellent.  Nice hoppy beer selection.  Did I mention friendly staff?  I guess it's a good place for vegans to get their bar food, but as far as bar food goes it's nothing to write home about.   I would try again to taste the waffles and perhaps the pulled pork. But I'm already anticipating it won't end up being overly  satisfying.  Did not try the dessert yet as our appetite had already subsided after all that grease intake. Perhaps next time."}
{"text":"I've heard so many good things about this place so I was super excited to try it! I came here on a Thursday for dinner around 6pm and it was pretty quiet. We tried two of the recommendations from the waitress - the southern ($14) and the bacon cheeseburger ($13).   They were both delicious! The southern came with soy chicken strips (they call it the unchicken), sautéed garlic collard greens and mac and cheese. The collard greens were good but felt a little bit oily and the mac and cheese was slightly too salty. The unchicken was so delicious. It was very very well seasoned and kind of tasted like chicken nuggets but it still had a tofu taste. The texture of it was really good.   The bacon cheeseburger was delicious as well, it came with either coleslaw or fries and we got the coleslaw which was a little too saucy and tart. The burger was really good and you didn't notice too much that there wasn't any meat. It was a little difficult to taste the tofu bacon but on its own it has a good smokey flavour.  The service here was great, the wait staff was very friendly and patient with all our questions about the menu. Definitely enjoyed our visit here and would love to come back to eat their unchicken again and try their vegan poutine!"}
{"text":"Delicious vegan food (and I'm not vegan). Chicken tenders taste almost like the real thing. Burger was good. Specialty pops were refreshing. Big portions. I really didn't like the vegan cheese on the fries supreme though but I think I just don't like vegan cheese so won't hold it against them."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food, whether you're vegan or not. I had the pleasure of feeling like I was absolutely, fully welcome there, from the fact that my food made me feel full and happy while still be ethical, to the kind and generous employees. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"This is just not the place for me.  I'm a vegetarian but I still like good food. This is not good food. This is grease served on a plate. In addition, I feel out of place in the Hogtown Vegan. Being there makes me feel like I'm at a Greenpeace rally. I looked around and I noticed I was eating with hipsters that have a \"coming of age activist\" look about them. If you like this and you are always looking for the latest cause célèbre and you use the word \"sustainable\" frequently and you like pure vegan grease on a plate then this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"I made a promise to come back to this restaurant for an entree, and I don't take my food promises lightly.  I made plans to meet up with a friend. It just so happened that I was a bit early and he was a bit late. The blonde (and beautiful) server made sure to ask if I needed anything while I was waiting. When my pal finally arrived I ordered the \"roast beef\" sandwich with mushrooms, onion, and gravy and both fries and coleslaw on the side (half portions of each). The faux beef was fine, but what won me over was the veggies and gravy. The gravy had a nice texture and rich flavour. I really wish there had been more mushrooms and onions!! The sandwich could have used the extra fungi to balance its composition.  In regard to the sides: the fries were delicious and crispy gold. The coleslaw was fresh tasting with a touch of spice, but didn't blow me away.  Another great experience and I definitely walked out feeling full!"}
{"text":"Whether you're vegan or not, you can't deny that Hogtown Vegan is delicious and provides a great atmosphere.   Hogtown offers amazing southern style comfort food. The best dishes are hands down the Southern Combo and the Unchicken & Waffles.   The staff is super friendly and I've only ever experienced one time where our food came out late, but the restaurant was kind enough to give us our ceasar salad and dessert on the house."}
{"text":"I've taken vegetarians and omnivores here and they've all loved it. The fake chicken here is the best I've had; first place I've found that can do \"chicken wings\" well. Servers have been pleasant each time I've been there."}
{"text":"I'm always stoked to check out new vegan or vegetarian restaurants but wasn't over-the-moon about my meal here. I think this has less to do with the actual establishment but my own personal preferences, as I've had a hard time getting into soy (which I've only enjoyed on one or two occasions). I ordered the \"unchicken and waffles\". I thought the waffles were delicious, very light and airy, but the unchicken was hard to eat because the soy was so pronounced. If you don't mind soy, though, you may enjoy it.  I also went halfsies on apple pie with coconut milk ice cream, the former of which was so greasy it was practically inedible. The ice cream, however, was divine! It really strikes me as a hit or miss kind of place, depending upon what your order. (Although I just read they had cockroaches -- yikes! Definitely makes me think twice about returning). Also, note that they don't have regular pop selections like Diet Coke. I had to order a natural soda instead but it was way too sweet, tasted kind of like sugar water."}
{"text":"Great lunch out with three friends (none of us are vegan and I'm a lazy-vegetarian at best). There is a separate gluten free menu if you're down for that. The service was attentive, friendly, and really helpful. I had the special - with a new type of unchicken and it was solid. I would have it again. The chili cheese fries were the best. I might just eat them as a meal next time. Lots of bean chili and guac and really tasty overall. I would have liked to see a vegetable that looks like vegetables option. I said a similar thing about Planta. As a lazy-vegetarian I wanted some nutritious vegetables cooked to perfection in some interesting way (better than I can do at home). I get that the idea is vegan comfort food and it's probably a ton of effort and way more expensive, but it would be a nice addition. I'd like to try this place out again."}
{"text":"Delicious comfort vegan food!  Good service!  Cool place with good atmosphere!  The mac n' cheese is particularly delightful!"}
{"text":"My vegan friend and I were looking to grab some food so we chose this place. I however am not a vegan but wow did this food blow me away!   She had the Unchicken Ceaser wrap with the Mac n \"Cheese\" and  I had the Buffalo Unchicken sammy with fries. The fries were great but I seriously missed out not getting the mac n' \"cheese\". I love how everything on the menu has quotations around it incase you thought it was real meat or cheese. Super funny.   Staff was great too. There was a mishap with the debit machine not working but those things happen.  For sure will be back soon though for that cheese-less mac!"}
{"text":"My partner insisted on not going here (the menu looks like a lot of stuff targeted at unhealthy vegetarians) but when Nazareth was closed one day I went to Hogtown out of curiosity. I just found a severe lack of real (fresh) food here - definitely felt terrible after eating some of the appetizers. I ordered a ceasar and that was also not very good. Sorry Hogtown!"}
{"text":"They specialize in fake meat that taste like and has similar texture as actual meat. I got a burger and added some fried chicken to it, I thought it was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"I've had some variable experiences at the Hogtown Vegan which has held me off writing up my review until now. I've had a chance to experience the spectrum of service, a decent variety of the menu, and visiting with vegan and non-vegan friends (which is actually always something I take into account when eating at solely vegan places, to be honest!).   Overall I have to give Hogtown a 4 star rating - I want to give it an outstanding 5 stars because it's a pretty unique offering in the range of vegan fare in Toronto, but some of the cons drag it down a little. A summary is in order to wrap up:  Pros:  * Awesome food different from most vegan places in Toronto. Comfort food makes me happy. * Tofu wings are delish, as are the fries supremacy - flavours so punchy! Mmm. * Comfort food is solid - burgers and sandwiches are great, solid options like a Reuben, and soy-chicken/waffles are wonderful. * Brunch is offered now, and I think it's almost a better menu than the regular one! * Great big portion sizes. SO BIG.  Cons: * Hot hot hot. Do they even have air-con? It's now fall and I feel like stripping off when i'm in there. * Servers/attitude - this is SO variable. I can't stand it when i'm going to get a different experience every time I go - I like a standard of service and not up-and-down, thanks. Also, whoever runs their social networking communications needs to learn a thing or two about actually, y'know, communicating properly with the people who are interacting with them. * Price. I'd be happier if apps were $1-2 cheaper, really. That mac and cheese is not worth $7. Mains could drop a little, but I suppose the sheer size of them is worth it. Not so for apps. * Variable quality of food from item to item - some things are so so great, others are just okay. Bring up the bottom bar, and it'll be outstanding. * Wish there were a few more drink items and nicer coffee/tea. Minor gripe there though. They're very good with free water at tables.  I think it depends on when you go and who you go with, but I think you can get a solid delicious experience here, and I will keep going back (as my wallet can afford it!)."}
{"text":"I finally got around to trying the unchicken and waffles after wanting to for so long. It's pretty much all hype. The \"chicken\" and waffles were as hard as a rock, with only a tiny drizzle of maple syrup to help you get it down.  It's kinda sad to say but the sweet potato mash was the best thing on the plate."}
{"text":"I ordered the mac n cheese which was ~creamy~ and rich, almost heavenly. Also had a taste of the chili cheese fries and I have to say... it's better than the mac. (The guac was really the powerhouse of it all.)   The chocolate mousse parfait on the other hand, was quite disappointing... Three puny tablespoons of mousse and some crushed nuts for $7??? Truly dismaying.  But anyways, The Hogtown Vegan is pretty good overall."}
{"text":"So happy that this place is here. The concept of the restaurant is great. The staff is friendly and very helpful.  Unfortunately, the food at best, is hangover food. Hangover food gone so wrong. Fried, greasy and salty with an absence of flavour and inspiration.  Fresh vegetables are not as plentiful as one would imagine. Why??? Tell me.  I had the chicken club. It was a fried mass of flash frozen tasteless protein. Hard to the bite. Filling. Like day old bread. The collard greens tasted like they had been soaked in canola with a snifter of Sunlight detergent. Maybe a bit of dish soap. I guess whoever made this has chosen to ignore the tradition of southern style collard greens.  There were two slabs on my plate of what I think might have been turkey? Greige in colour.  These pieces resembled a flattened Penis with a hint of chemically conjured turkey aroma. Painful.  Please chef: wake up. Get inspired. Get excited about your food. Get rid of flash frozen foods and tasteless slabs of 'chicken fingers'. Make it yourself.  I love that you are doing comfort  food. Try and do the comfort food with house made pickles, mayonnaise, burgers and sauces.  Stop using the plastic cheese that Vegans can buy at a supermarket. Make your own. And please get a better recipient for collard greens.  More fresh vegetables. Better wine list.  If you can do all of the above, I have no doubt that your place will become a treasure."}
{"text":"Trying the whole vegan thing and this place made it easy. Mac and cheese with \"chicken\" fingers was Dynamite. Also tried the poutine and dumplings with \"beef\". Everything had so much flavour and I would definitely return. If I could say one bad thing was there was a fruit fly problem which was annoying."}
{"text":"Great place for people thinking about being vegetarian or vegan this place shows you that you can still have all of your favourites without sacrificing flavor"}
{"text":"To start of; I'm not vegan. I quite enjoy my meat-eating lifestyle. There are however, periods in my year (especially towards summer time) when I prefer to chill out a bit on the heavy eating and consume comforting plant based foods. I find the generic \"vegan place\" to be too bean/lentil based with over used spices (like cumin) and I find they leave me very bloated.  Hogtown is another case. Everything is amazingly structured. We had their famous unchicken and fish(y) looking plate. Both very tasty. Will definitely be back to try off the rest of their menu. Great job!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing! They really nailed down comfort food. The unchicken burger was the highlight of my night as it tasted exactly like a McChicken and my least favourite was the Reuben sandwich. The only thing that was lacking was the service, however, everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"If you're a vegan and you like comfort food, miss meat or are craving something hearty- this is a must try. Even if you're not vegan and you're craving comfort food you will really enjoy your meal.  Personally, I'm not a huge fan of comfort food but I still enjoyed it and liked having different vegan options. My friends LOVE this place. The staff was nice, prices were average, and the food was definitely creative and not something you can find at every corner.   Whether you're vegan or not, I'd give this place a try."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Hogtown during my trip to Toronto. The hostess was really nice, there was great customer service, and the food was delicious. I ordered the southern combo and the fried apple pie: both were pleasantly surprising! The greens that came with the southern combo were seasoned to perfection, the Mac and cheese was seasoned well, cheesy and delicious. The apple pie was crisp and it wasn't super sweet (which I prefer). As a vegetarian-with-vegan-habits I can say that Hogtown deserves 5 stars and another visit whenever I return to Toronto."}
{"text":"Husband and I LOVE the food here!  Comfort vegan food is the best idea ever!  My favourites are the vegan chicken wings, and the Mac and Cheese.  I did have to dock a star for service, though.  The two waitresses apparently hate their job, and never smile.  A rush came in last time, and they made it pretty obvious that they wanted us out of our table (which sucked, because it was our wedding anniversary and we were having a night away from the kids).   The excellent food is defiantly worth dealing with the sad waitresses."}
{"text":"We popped in here late one night, it was 10pm, and the place was still serving food. I have to be honest and say i was very skeptical as i always am with vegan eateries. This place was ok, but not great/good. We started with the fried \"clams\" which were just tempura fried shiitake mushrooms, they were pretty good!  I mean it's not hard to batter and fry mushrooms. but it was nonetheless tasty. I ordered the double burger. this was just a pretty average run of the mill frozen soy based burger that you can easily get at the supermarket, it was \"ok\", but uninspired and kinda bland, there was really nothing special about it at all, it was pretty boring...  doomies has a better burger, though their patties similar soy based patties, they are MUCH better. My girlfriend had the \"phish\" and chips, she was happy with it, but she wasn't blown away either. Overall the food is decent. But could be MUCH better. I didn't feel like this was a place i wanted to come back to though. my overall impression was just \"meh\". Mediocre food at best.   Good wait staff, friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"If you're looking for vegan Mac & cheese reminiscent of \"real\" Mac & cheese then don't hesitate to get down at Hogtown.  Let me back it up!  Firstly, service is superb. I can't remember the gentleman's name but we'll call him Jack because he's truly the Jack of all trades. He was the host, the server, the bartender, the busboy, shit I wouldn't be surprised if he went and flipped my burger. He truly was doing it all while maintaining a professional demeanor and not looking overwhelmed.   Menu had some great southern options. This was the first time I seen a vegan menu that gave me multiple soul food options. So many that I didn't know what to order and took the suggestion of \"Jack\". He shared how you can't go wrong with a burger and sad that wasn't true :(  I ordered the big hog (their version of a Big Mac) and though all the fixings were perfect I couldn't get pass the soy patties. This may work for someone else but it wasn't working for me. I took two bites and I was done.  But the redemption, oh the Mac and cheese! It was amazing. Consistency was parallel to \"real\" Mac and cheese. It was cheesy, googy, and the seasoning was uniquely done with a hint of hot sauce. It was at the moment that I knew I should've went full Southern and got the chicken fried steak with greens. I let my indecisiveness cause me to get something I really didn't want.  Even though the burger wasn't the best for me. Whenever in Toronto I will stop in to order the Mac & cheese with other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Delicious vegan junk food! Prepare to be stuffed but don't expect anything to be healthy despite being vegan or vegetarian.  We split a sandwich and an app and we were still stuffed. Only negative was the number of hipsters."}
{"text":"Amazing place to take your non veggie friends lol. The staff was really friendly and his service was great. I ordered a lunch special which I forget the name of (unchicken something...) and my bf ordered the southwest combo. Both of these were amazing! The mac and cheese was so delicious. I wasn't too crazy about the poutine gravy but my bf loved it. We also ordered the nachos and that was amazingly delicious! I have nothing bad to say about this place and I can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"I went there a couple of time for their Mac and cheese. It just taste soooooooo good. They also serve brunch is my memories is good. unfortunately they dont serve mac and cheese for brunch... that should :P Mac and cheese with a Cesar is actually my hangover best friend. Also great portion.   Lovely staff they know a lot about vegan food (as expected for a vegan restaurant)   I think last time they did not accept debit card ... that a minor point. Love to go there"}
{"text":"My first visit here was awesome (5 stars), so I returned with a friend.   Sadly, the second visit was disappointing. My friend ordered a side of coke slaw and didn't like it. So he asked for a new side of fries instead. The fries that were brought out to him were very dark, greasy, and inedible. We looked around at the other diners around us to see if everyone's fries were like that, and they were not. It definitely felt like we were given bad fries because he didn't like his first side of cole slaw. We would have gladly paid extra for the 2nd side, rather than getting burnt fries for free.   The rest of the food was spot on but I think this instance shows the restaurant's attitude about complaints. They can't accept a complaint when a customer doesn't like something, and they will retaliate by giving you another sub-par side.  Maybe I'm looking too far into this but it was telling that everyone else's fries looked perfect and delish."}
{"text":"Brunch is vile. Come here for dinner and get the southern combo. Everything on the plate is delicious.. Service is better at dinner too."}
{"text":"Killer brunches!!! Came here on the weekend. It's a nice intimate place, seemed a bit dark inside, can update a bit. Otherwise great service and excellent food.  I'm not a vegetarian myself but I find that the flavour, presentation and taste of the food was excellent. I ordered the PB & banana French toast. It looked more like a sandwich. It had peanut butter, banana, tofu bacon wedged between two fried battered pieces of bread. Of course anything fried tastes good but the peanut butter seemed fresh and formed this gooey filling with the banana. I'm not sure if it needed the tofu bacon, it was a bit weird for me but maybe that gave it the kick that it needed. Came with salad or homefries. They had a good selection of tea, I ordered a ginger one it was good.   Overall I thought the service was really good. The food was great! The place could use some fixing otherwise it had great character. Three of us were placed in a \"booth\" that seemed to only fit two. The table was not really big enough for our food and my legs were a bit squished under the table. That's my only complaint."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto for the first time with my boyfriend and trying to hit up all the vegan spots around. This was our first stop and I was sad that it was only the brunch menu until 3PM and felt a little limited. Really enjoyed the BLT I got but wish it had more of the white sauce on it, tofu was deliciously flavored!! My boyfriend got the unchicken and waffles and that was delicious as well. My BLT came with a salad that was nothing special and the dressing felt a bit boring. I definitely will return and try something from the dinner menu before returning to the states.  Update: Returned for dinner and was so excited to try the mac n cheese. It was delicious but my only down side was it was too oily for my taste. My boyfriend got the unchicken burger with the fries supremacy. I liked his sandwich better it reminded me of a McDonald's McChicken but way more tasty and filling of course. We also shared a fried apple pie with soy vanilla ice cream that was so good."}
{"text":"Excuse me as a wheeze through this review. My stomach has completely taken over most of the room usually reserved for my lungs.  I came here with Chad, Nicolle and Danielle for some impromptu vegan feasting. As an appetizer, we split some fries that were basically the vegan version of Taco Bell Fries Supreme, in a very VERY good way. I basically lived off those in high school, and I've been craving a vegan (or at the very least dairy-free) version for years. The sour cream alone blew me away. We also split an order of wings, which tasted just like meaty hot wings, though I suspect it's because of their liberal use of Frank's Red Hot sauce.  I ordered the Unchicken n' Waffles and they were DELICIOUS. In fact, I have half the order sitting in my fridge right now, mocking me. Everyone else at the table loved their meals. Chad and Danielle had the Unchicken Sandwich and both were very very happy with them. Nicole was also very happy with her head-size Po'Boy sandwich. The people in the kitchen appear to have some kind of magic power for breading, because all the unchicken things were deliciously and incredibly breaded. I usually hate breading, but I LOVED this.  Unfortunately, neither of us had room for dessert.  The service was cordial and friendly, and everything came out at a good rate. The prices were also quite good for the amount of food.  I will definitely be back again, and soon."}
{"text":"This place was great.  We did have to wait a little while to be seated for dinner but I have experienced that a lot when going to vegan restaurants.  My fiance and I went with our friends and everyone really enjoyed their meals.  The \"chicken\" was super tasty, I wish I could find that in NY.  They also had this super spicy ginger beer that was so good that I had to get one to go."}
{"text":"All of these dishes are 100% vegan. The place itself is cute, like a hipster diner. It's not too large so make sure to plan ahead if your group is big. Service is fast, and everyone working is quick and attentive. Portion size is great and for the price really good. Nothing was over 15$.    Here's what we thought about each dish.  Unchicken and waffles (2/5) The chicken was okay. It kind of tasted somewhat bland but funny enough, it did taste like chicken. The closest thing I can compare it to is a chicken nugget. After adding some salt it tasted a bit better. The waffles also tasted very bland, and if not for the syrup, I probably wouldn't have finished them. The salad and potato's that the dish came with were yummy and flavoured.   Philly Steak Sandwich (4/5) I really liked this. The Philly steak they created was crunchy and chewy and worked well with the rest of the sandwich. The vegan cheese and veges altogether was super flavourful. Don't get it if you don't like red pepper though because the sandwich is filled with them. It is pretty big and was pretty hard to eat, we had to use a fork and eat it like a poutine.   Vegan Mac and Cheese (4/5) This was really good! But honestly it tasted like KD lol. It was macaroni and vegan cheese with an imitation bacon on top. It wasnt super cheesy, and actually somewhat watery instead.   Unchicken Wings (5/5) This was our favourite dish of the meal! It was SO good! The vegan  chicken was soft and easy to chew but the outside was perfectly crispy. Bonus that there was no bones haha. The sauce it came with was perfect and tasted so yummy. It was the best imitation of chicken wings I've had to date.   Shitake Fried Clams (1/5) Honestly, this tasted like mushroom tempura. It was mushroom that was breaded and then fried. We got this dish on a whim, thinking it was a different but didn't end up liking it at all. The sauce it came with was really bad. It had barely any flavour to it and even with salt, we didn't really want to finish it."}
{"text":"I love the food at Hogtown but it just doesn't love me back. I have a hard time digesting oily deep-fried foods so I have to go home & lie down after eating here. But oh maaan..It is heavy, starchy, oily, salty American-style comfort food goodness and it doesn't pretend to be anything else. If you're looking for a healthy meal, you will not find it here (quit complaining and just go to the other 5738384 veg places in Toronto that serve grain bowls and salads!). This place converted my junk-food addicted husband to veganism because he knew he wouldn't be missing a thing. I love the Unchicken & Waffles, Tofu Wings, Fries Supremacy, the Pulled Unpork, and the Philly Cheesesteak. The Mac n Cheese is damn good, too. Never once made it to dessert because its just too filling.  I went for brunch though and wasn't too impressed. The French toast was inedible due to how deep-fried it was (grease was pouring off it as I lifted it..I can't..all you can taste is oil) and the Reuben Sandwich was lacklustre but not awful. Some evenings they are so overwhelmingly busy that the food & service does suffer, which is a bit of a deterrent.   Otherwise, this is THE PLACE to have THE MOST fatty vegan meal of your life. Take your omni friends and show them that you don't just eat rabbit food. Maybe have a Tums handy after and take an Uber home so you can nap immediately."}
{"text":"I am not vegan but I am always on the lookout for good vegan food to take my vegan friends to.  At first I was a little skeptical whenever traditional meat dishes get a plant-based transformation, but I was pleasantly surprised that the dishes were pretty loyal to the originals.  I went with a friend and we each ordered a dish.  I got the Southern Combo and she got the \"Beef\" and Dumplings Stew.  The chicken fingers in the Southern Combo were pretty good.  It was crispy, well seasoned, and the mouth-feel was very faithful to that of real chicken.  The \"cheese\" in macaroni and cheese was creamy but sour.  Same thing with the \"Beef\" and Dumplings Stew.  The texture of the \"beef\" was alright but the sauce was sour."}
{"text":"This restaurant was the definition of \"meh\". My partner ordered the vegan mac and cheese and I ordered the bacon cheeseburger. The mac and cheese had literally 0 seasoning - about as flavourful as a piece of cardboard. It only resembled mac n cheese in the texture and the colour, which is not a good sign. The cheeseburger was a bit better, good fake bacon but the patty was not great - bad texture, too crispy on the outside and too soft on the inside. It was quite greasy, I  started to eat it with a knife and fork and when I would cut into it the innards would spill out everywhere. At least the fries were good. I'm disappointed as I had high hopes for this place."}
{"text":"My friend and I came for brunch and shared the Tofu Rancheros with salad and the banana peanut butter French toast with homefries.   We were ecstatic! Both agreed anyone who isn't vegan would ADORE our choices.   The French toast bread was deep fried, it was very greasy. I would suggest sharing it because you probably wouldn't want to eat the entire thing to yourself but it's SO good.  Very satisfying.  We can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"When my friend told me to meet her at a vegan southern restaurant I thought she was someone I'd need to cut out of my life.  I was wrong.  The food is great, the atmosphere is adorable, the waitress was sweet.  The price is what you would expect to pay at a fried southern food place ($20/head without drinks) but I can honestly say that it was a new, and very good experience.  The food didn't taste \"vegan\" like I expected it to - meaning as a non-veg I had low hopes and it was very yummy, tasted very real.   The desert menu isn't as large as I'd like, only 2 items plus soy ice cream. I opted for the ice cream, which was average soy ice cream.   Otherwise, very cute, definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I held high hopes for this spot - so much in fact that I showed up early (11ish) and had to visit Fresh for an appetizer before returning to Hogtown for lunch at noon on the dot.  The unchicken wings were entirely too overwhelming in vinegar (trying too hard to add \"flavour\" that did not work well). My friend was generous in giving it at 7/10 - I'd say it's more a 3/10.  He ordered a sandwich and I had the waffles and \"sausage\", and let me tell you: let those waffles sit for just 1 min and you could toss it at an animal and knock it out entirely. Stone hard.  Presentation is very very attractive, and that's how I was lured in via the online images.   Taste-wise, I would worry what my friends would think of me if I recommended them this spot."}
{"text":"Im not a vegan but I came here with a friend who recently became one and I was trying out vegan food with her for the first time. I guess our taste buds are very different because I was not a fan of the unchicken burger and supremacy fries I ordered but she loovedd her phish and chips which tasted like cardboard to me. The faux chicken was fine but sorry id rather the real thing, the real bummer was the faux mayo, it in no way enhanced the burger the way real mayo does, it just gave it a sad nutty aftertaste which im not used to experiencing with burgers. I will say though that the fries were good, I just wish Id ordered them plain so they werent marred by the faux nacho cheese and faux white sauce. We also ordered the cesar salad but again, in no way similar to the real deal, I think adding garlic might help make it closer but it just tasted like nutty and weird, id rather have had plain lemon juice and oil. The real star of the meal for me was the chocolate parfait for dessert, it was insanely delicious. I think vegan desserts in general are pretty amazing just wish the food was on par. This review is from a non-vegan but my vegan friend thoroughly enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"One of my good friends who is vegan recommended me this place so we went for brunch on the weekend. We were seated quickly and around ~12:30, the place was almost full. Our server, Kurt was nice and fast with our orders. We were given water and the menu. I ordered the Unchicken and Waffles + chef salad (you could also get the fries) while my friend ordered the Omelette + fries. I would say that the chicken does taste similar to chicken, the coating and the consistency but fried a little bit too much. The waffles were good too, a bit dry, but it balanced out with the syrup. I liked the salad as well, the sauce was great. I would say the service and cleanliness is great and the food is good.  Note: if you want to come here as a group, you cannot make any reservations and they cannot seat you all until the whole party has arrived."}
{"text":"Great place to fill up those comfort food cravings. I ordered the mac and cheese (so yummy) which is a huge serving, I wasn't able to finish it all.  My friends ordered \"fish\" and chips, a burger, and a \"chicken wrap.\" None of them were able to finish either since portions are a bit large.  The ambiance is alright. Service is great and friendly."}
{"text":"This is the one resturant I have to go to every time I go to Toronto. The comfort food is filling and delicious. My favourites are The Unchicken Burger (ask for it spicy), the Mac and Cheese, Tempeh Fish, and the Fries Supremecy.  I miss living in Ontario and being able to eat here whenever, Vancouver needs it's wn Hogtown. Everyone I have taken here has absolutely loved it!"}
{"text":"All right, I'm only writing this review because I'm basically obsessed with their nachos. I'm in no way a vegan. There was that brief, sad 8 months of my 16th year where I attempted it but soy milk in coffee and Not Eating Cheese ultimately did me in. Vegan cheese technology has apparently come a long way, because these nachos are LEGIT.  I trust that everything on the menu is just as delicious but all I can do is listen to my nacho craving when I go here.   The only minor thing that bugs me about this place are the strict seating rules.. I have always gone in the off hours when there is nobody else in the place, and can't get a seat in the banquettes at the front near a window as a solo diner because they're reserved for the groups of four that never show up during my meal. Showing a little discretion in these cases would go a long way."}
{"text":"I am NOT a vegan nor am I converting anytime soon but I decided to try this place out of curiosity and I'm so glad I did!   My bf and I just came back from this restaurant a few hours ago, and we ordered a basket of fries, chips and guac, \"chicken\" and waffles and the southern combo.   I am surprised by how DELICIOUS everything was. I walked in pretty skeptical and thought it was going to taste pretty \"earthy\" or not as close as the real deal but tbh it was pretty close if not better!   My bf who is not a fan of veggies loved the chicken and waffles! I loved everything except the collard greens - tasted pretty bland.  The *only* thing I will complain about is the staff. They were pretty slow with taking orders. No friendly smiles and they looked super miserable...  I am still giving this a 5 star only because the food was unbelievably AMAZING, staff not so much."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! AMAZING comfort food -   perfect for a casual dinner or whatever.   We shared both our mains and they were fantastic. Left feeling very full and happy.  Thanks Hogtown.  The wine was also great."}
{"text":"Make no mistake this isn't healthy vegan food, it's the soul-warming, comforting kind. For that reason it's probably more niche because non-vegans won't necessarily find healthier versions of the \"real thing\".   I had the Southern Combo, My favourite was the \"unchicken\"! The texture is eerily similar to real chicken, but in a good way. Those fried soy strips were actually mouth-watering to me.   The Mac n cheese was ok, texture wise the cheese was good but it was a lot saltier than non vegan versions. The collard greens I had were really bitter, didn't enjoy that as much.   Not stellar enough for 4 stars but overall it's solid and I would return here again."}
{"text":"I dream of the 'unchicken' burger! Came here on a date, and luckily did not have to wait long for a table for two. We sat in a corner table, and shared the unchicken burger and the mushroom gravy poutine. Both were great, and I would definitely come back here (and hope to soon!) - would love to try the mac n' cheese and the unchicken caesar wrap. A great choice for 'vegan comfort food'. Pricing was also very reasonable."}
{"text":"It might just be me being sinfully old school, -- but it is sort of the very existence of the Hogtown Vegan that completely blows my mind. Not only did I find a not just vegetarian, but vegan, place that serves nothing but junk food, -- its junk food also happens to be about the greasiest (in that oddly good way), most filling, junk food I ever came across (note: feel free to cast non-physical stones at me for this last sentence, because I hereby admit that I am by no means an expert on junk food). That being said, -- the first thing you might want to keep in mind while visiting here is not to order more than perhaps just a single dish, unless you decide to split it with your lunch date, since the serving sizes are absolutely enormous and in addition to their (in)famous greasiness, going for a desert will probably leave you uncomfortably full (that is, of course, if you are not training your stomach for filming a vegan version of \"Here Comes Honey Boo Boo\", in that case, -- I do not dare to warn you :).  THE MENU is decently sized. My personal favorites are the Hogtown Burger (soy patty, daiya cheese, vegan mayo, onions, lettuce and pickles on a sesame seed bun), the unchicken wings, and oddly enough -- mac and \"cheese\", which is yes, somehow tastes divine. An apple pie served with soy ice cream for dessert, if I'm feeling extra brave. I wasn't particularly impressed by poutine and banana split special (a deep fried banana that immediately melts the coconut ice cream and chocolate syrup). THE SERVICE is slightly awkward. It takes a little too long, and the otherwise friendly-looking servers never seem to be into engaging in small talk.   THE overall ATMOSPHERE, on the other hand, is quite pleasant. Before you glance at the menu, -- you can easily confuse it one of those medium-sized hipster coffee shops that start stretching a little further, west from Ossington (this, if memory doesn't fail me, would also include the sound and the crowd of a medium-sized hipster coffee shop west of Ossington as well).  THE PRICE to me is confusing. It is 13 dollars on average for the entrées, 12 -- for sandwiches and, 9 for desserts. I don't find it upsetting, but I do fail to understand the logic behind a basic salad in a fast-food establishment costing just as much as a main meal combo, as well as the idea of #vegan attached to comfort foods becoming a valid reason to charge more than an average junk food chain.  THE BOTTOM LINE, I definitely appreciate the Hogtown Vegan for giving me the opportunity to fall off the reasonable part of my diet while keeping the vegan one firmly in place, when I crave some soul food; and sort of appreciate it for the hilarity of breaking the stereotype of \"vegan = healthy\". I WOULD appreciate the service that  doesn't make me feel awkward for being sociable, and more reasonable pricing policies."}
{"text":"A great menu with plenty of options. The steak pot pie was delish. So was the Mac n cheese.  The place was super busy but the service was still great. The only down side- there was no a/c."}
{"text":"Food here is great. Not a fantastic selection but what they do serve is outstanding. The service can be hit or miss. The real downside to this place is the space- waaaaay too small. Avoid at all costs on weekends- lineup is usually out the door. And if you do end up getting a table, there will be people standing around you while they wait for tables- very uncomfortable."}
{"text":"Pros: Good food. I had the southern Comfort. It comes with their version of fried chicken collard greens and mac & cheese. The mac & cheese had a little spice to it which was nice. The chicken was a little dry but good with the provided barbecue sauce. The collar greens were a tiny bit undercooked for my taste. It would have been nice to have a selection of hot sauce. The one provided was your basic tobasco-esque.  Portion size was good so I didn't need to order an appetizer.  Staff was friendly.  Cons: A bit on the expensive side.  Decor could have been nicer."}
{"text":"The Hogtown Vegan serves delicious vegan food that even meat lovers will love. The service is great. The restaurant has a homey feel. The pricing is also reasonable.   I enjoyed the unchicken and waffles ($14). The waffles were fluffy and sweet. The unchicken was surprisingly flavourful and savoury. It did not taste exactly like chicken, but it did not taste bad. I can not really describe the exact taste.  I had the unchicken and waffles with a side of mac & cheese. The mac & cheese ($2.50) was delicious. I would highly recommend getting the mac & cheese as a side.   I note that vegan food may not be for everyone. Thus, while I enjoyed it, this restaurant may not be to everyone's liking."}
{"text":"I was Intrigued by this place after having seen it on the Food Network show \"You Gotta Eat Here\" and I was not disappointed, this place is honestly the best vegan food in town! I came here a while back before heading off to a show later that evening after a friend recommended it to me as well and I'm so glad that I did. She showed me the ropes, after having been there before and then I was set. I ordered the Southern Combo, which included: fried \"chicken\", collared greens and macaroni and cheese. I ordered an Irish Coffee to drink as well. The food was absolutely amazing. I was a bit apprehensive about the taste of the \"chicken\" but after tasting if someone hadn't told me that this wasn't real I wouldn't have known the difference! The macaroni and cheese was perfectly creamy and the collared greens were a great addition as well. The decor of the place is so cute and quaint, making you feel as if you're at home. I can't wait to go back and try their poutine as I tasted a bit of my friends who ordered it and it was delicious! Hopefully I make my way around here again soon!"}
{"text":"Great concept. Relatively healthy food of questionable digestibility by the body and a combo of healthy greens and deep fried, saturated fat. Service was awesome. Clothes and coat and hat wreaked of fried oil and my dry cleaner's bill was not worth it."}
{"text":"I've always wanted to try going to a vegan restaurant and I was told this was a good restaurant. Decent food but the drinks were not good."}
{"text":"First time here. I ordered their Un-chicken burger with a side of poutine. The burger is tasty. Good portion size. I strongly recommend upgrading your fries to poutine. Reasonable prices.  Very friendly service. Nice music playing in the background. Overall this is a great diner / bar regardless if you are vegan or non-vegan. I'm surely coming back for more."}
{"text":"My friend took me here for a birthday lunch.  We came for their Sunday brunch.  Not a big menu, maybe only 6 or 7 items.    I ordered the Unchicken and Waffles and she ordered the Huevos Rancheros.  I came here based on it being on a tv show and a recommendation of a friend.  The venue is very relaxing and a bit hipster like (i.e. casual tables and servers are in normal clothes).    I usually eat healthy vegan foods and find these absolutely delicious, so I figure deep fried vegan food would be a treat and have amazing taste.  I've had \"unhealthy\" vegan food as well from places such as Grasshopper and Grasslands.  Sad to say, but the Unchicken and waffles was kind of bland.  Now, I didn't feel sick and it wasn't greasy, but it was very plain.  I honestly would have much preferred a quinoa bowl for some reason. Maybe my taste buds have changed.  However, the collard greens were excellent.    I was able to get a bite of my dining companion's Huevos Rancheros and they were excellent.  It would have tasted even better had their been hot sauce or salsa, but sadly, that was not provided. :-(    Verdict: Meh as a brunch place.  It probably explains why they weren't jam packed at around 12:30 to 1 pm when most brunch places on Bloor are always full with lineups.  Maybe their dinners are better?"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch - at first I was disappointed by the small menu, but I loved my food! I had the BLT with a Caesar salad and a virgin Caesar (my favorite) and my partner had the French toast. My partner is a meat eater, and we both LOVED our food. The service was fast and efficient and the portions were great.   I also came for dinner and had the beef sandwich, pouting and chili cheese fries. Was pleased with everything! I recommend coming early because there is a big line up and sitting at the door can get a bit loud and windy."}
{"text":"I really like the premise of an American-greasy-spoon-style vegan restaurant. Guy Fieri would be proud. That's awesome.  What's not-so-awesome is that I've noticed, and confirmed with questioning, that the unchicken that everyone is raving about, and every chicken product on the Hogtown menu, is an institutional, cafeteria-style breaded veggie chicken burger patty cut into chunks and deep fried. Sometimes rebattered and deep-fried. Some of the sausage/beef menu options are also made from institutionally prepared commercial patties chopped up/battered, deep fried, and served. Come on, I think that this restaurant owes itself and everyone who eats there more than that. if all they're doing otherwise is punching fries and steaming greens, you'd think they'd be able to at least make some in house vegan 'meats'.  The reality is, a lot of the stuff that's offered on the menu is processed, factory made food (Daiya cheese).  It's a vegan McDonalds for fecksake, right down to the assembly (and quality) of the food. I'll pass."}
{"text":"Let me start off first that I'm open minded when it comes to ingredients, however nowhere near vegan and I was blown away at the dinner entrees. The food was amazing. I had the Unchicken and Waffles, tried a \"wing\" and a spoonful of the chipotle mac'n'cheese - all ridiculously amazing.   With that said, I had one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever EVER had. I called and made a reservation for 10 people for 8pm as I had friends here from New Zealand who were both Vegan and weren't having any luck with good vegan food in Toronto. The girl on the phone was nice enough, but hesitated on the 8pm reservation as the restaurant closed at 9pm and she \"works 14 hour days\"... So I sympathized and made it for 7:30. The majority of the party showed up at 7:28-7:33, leaving 2 to arrive at 8pm due to traffic and work and one wasn't able to make it.   Upon my arrival I went from what was a warm day into a humid hot restaurant with no AC... I poured myself a glass of room temperature water and took a look at the menu. Hoping that people would arrive sooner we held off on ordering for 15/20 minutes then when we finally were ready to order it took the waitress another 15/20 minutes to even come check on us... By this point the last 2 guests had been seated for about 5-10 minutes. She took our order and then again didn't check back on us until the appetizers came out at about 8:30. We enjoyed the food, minus one of us finding a piece of steel wool near the end of his mac'n'cheese dish, to which the waitress simply said \"I'll let them know\" with a chuckle... about 45 minutes after the appetizers we finally got our entrees - during the time of sitting down at 7:30 to finishing our entrees we saw two tables of 4 eat dinner and dessert, pay and leave as well as a couple, and again, we didn't see our waitress again until we got the birthday cheesecake we had put aside for us. By 9:40 we were given our bill, nearly $300. The cheesecake wasn't sold to us as one cake, but by piece, $6 a piece... a $48 mediocre key lime cheesecake - even by the vegan's perspective. A fact we can't cry about because I'm aware that they would have sold the cheesecake slice by slice to other patrons and made the same profit - again, it's just a nice gesture to sell the whole thing as a single cake cost as opposed to slice by slice. There was also an automatic gratuity of 15% added to our bill which I'm aware is law, however our waitress DID NOT deserve any sort of gratuity since she only checked on us when she delivered our food... and the restaurant only had maybe 4-5 other tables seated at the time, most being 2 people per table - which for a waitress isn't out of control...   So we paid our bill and a few of us brought our concerns to one of the owners and were shot down immediately. Saying she could maybe take $5 off for the steel found in the mac'n'cheese, that we were to be there for 7:30, which we were, that we ordered too late, which wouldn't have been the case if they had a competent waitress, and that is why we got our food nearly an hour and a half after we ordered, even though we saw 10 patrons come and go in that time... We were told there wasn't adequate enough space in the kitchen to plate 9 entrees - then don't seat a large table if you can't serve them together. I'm sure we would have been fine if food was staggered rather than an hour and a half after ordering, but there was no communication. The girl we dealt with had a very \"deal with it\" attitude and when one of us said they have lost customers she replied, and I quote \"that's okay, I don't care about you.\"   Floored.  The last Toronto dinner for our Vegan New Zealand friends ruined, not to mention a birthday dinner.  We stood outside for about 10/15 minutes to chat and say our goodbyes before they taxied it to the hotel and through the window this same OWNER was physically mocking us on multiple occasions!   Finally one of the chefs (and I think part owner) came out to hear what 'got the girls so upset'..... So we explained our story and he was great, he offered to comp the next meal for the guy who found the steel wool. He claimed it was a crazy day and it's sometimes hard to keep your cool in a very customer service environment and asked if we could sympathies IF we knew what it was like to be in a customer service work environment - this we all disagreed with because we ALL are in customer service - we know customer service and hers was absolutely HORRIBLE.   With ALL of that said, I'm giving Hogtown 2 stars. I would have given it one if the chef/owner didn't come out to talk to us afterwards. I'm also aware this is a new business and there are learning curves - however if you're an owner, do not say you don't care about your customers if they have a valid complaint and especially DO NOT mock them like a teenager through your storefront..."}
{"text":"I am so surprised that this THV has. It been reviewed by me as well. Was here with family about four years ago-so perhaps it was before I went social with Apps  So, on a Sunday evening of the Family Day long weekend, the five of us after a busy day of shopping headed to THV. There seemed to be quite a few people ahead of us and the staff told us it wouldn't take that long for our table. She was right, after about 10 minutes or so, we were seated. Not bad, considering we assumed it would take at 30-40 minutes. Seated in a booth, I was given a foldable chair.   Started of with a large of Chicken Wings with BBQ and Hot sauce as our flavours. The waitress had already told us that due to their menu being updated the wings were more like popcorn chicken. Which was true, the basket full of popcorn chicken arrived and we attacked on it as we were starving. The hot flavour was heat, but not flavoured hot. Just some heat. The BBQ was flavoured nicely and tasted much better. The carrot and celery sticks were an after thought.   Amongst the five of us we had a Hot Roast Beef Sandwich, a Bacon Cheese Burger, Pulled Pork Sandwich, Unchicken & Waffles and a Big Hog (a double burger). The fries in the Pulled Pork was replaced by Poutine. And the sweet potato mash was replaced by fries in the Waffles.   The Hot Roast Beef Sandwich was amazing. Nicely seasoned and overfilled with Beef with onions and mushrooms. The bread could be better. 4.5/5)  The Pulled Pork was a bit more in the sweeter side for us. Just needed the spice part kicked up a notch. The hot sauce provided did not do justice. The fries were replaced with a Poutine. The vegetarians missed the real cheese. The vegan cheese did not do the trick. 4/5)  The Waffle and Chicken were OK. The Waffle perfect, the Chicken was similar to the wings we had. The cinnamon syrup was great. The collard greens had loads of garlic. The mash was were replaced by fries which was a mistake.   The Bacon Cheese Burger and the Big Hog double burger were super. Mouthgasm! The burgers were so juicy and were made just right. I think this was one of the best vegan burger I have had. (5/5)  The fries - they are shoe string fries. Not great at all. They become too oily/greasy. Crispy, however we prefer the thick cut or fresh cut type fries.   The service was great, still a lineup when we left. No wonder why, they serve one of the best vegan foods!"}
{"text":"Actually 3.5 stars but the reviews are already too low so I rounded up in this case (and loaded with self-righteous busybody nonsense about about people's \"health\"). The bbq sauce was delicious with a little punch of some kind of hot peppers! The syrup was incredible; just the right combo of sweet and spicy. The mac and cheese was done with some Daiya (that vegan cheese is not my favourite) but not so much that it was too ... Daiya-y? Glorious, creative, unpretentious vegan grub. I love it.   There were definitely some issues with our meals: the collard greens were bland (but I didn't care because I LOVE them), the waffle was hard as it was obviously reheated and the fries were cooked at too low a temperature so they were simultaneously over done on the outside, under on the inside, but the menu and food is just so much fun! The bbq sauce was delicious with a little punch of some kind of hot peppers! The syrup was incredible; just the right combo of sweet and spicy. The mac and cheese was done with some Daiya (not my favourite) but not so much that it was too ... Daiya-y? Glorious, creative, unpretentious vegan grub. I love it. I wish we'd see more inspired vegan food like this - especially vegan food that isn't trying to stand on a soapbox about health being some moral high ground (I love fresh food, don't misunderstand me)."}
{"text":"Very hit-or-miss. The problem with everything I've ever ordered here is that it has good components, and terrible components, and when you throw them together, you get something mediocre or mildly disappointing. The fries they have are great, but when you try to \"supreme\" they suck, the chili ones are slightly better. The Reuben flat out sucks, it is awful, does not even have the vegan equivalent components of what a Reuben is. Do they have a freaking clue? Alfalfa sprouts are not supposed to a core ingredient, don't try to say that you're putting your own personal spin on it, that's not a fucking Reuben, you wouldn't put Coca Cola into gin and tonic. Duh! Worst decorated restaurant in Toronto. The walls are barf..."}
{"text":"I love this place for vegan food. It is definitely in my top 3. I have been here multiple times and always love coming back. The food is good (even my non-vegan friends enjoy it) and the people are super nice. I'll be back again soon!"}
{"text":"First time in a vegan joint!  First impressions:  clean, friendly, green.   Sat down ordered drinks,  appetizer,  Reuben (or unReuben) and a Southern Comfort combo.   All was delicious and unique.   Felt very filling and not like I had imagined.   Portion sizes generous. I  was the most over weight fella in the joint.   Would definitely be back."}
{"text":"I mean it was alright. I heard a lot of hype on the vegan pages I follow on Facebook. When I walked in yesterday we were seated but usually within the first 5 min of entering a restaurant the server gives asks if they can get you anything such as water. I'm gluten free so I always have questions about the menu. It took the server 15 minutes before they came to check on us and the server notified me that they had a separate gluten free menu. So when my partner and I finally got to order we got the southern plate and supreme fries. The fires were really good but for the plate, I found the cheez sauce for the macaroni a little watery. The fake pork was quite good and tasted meaty which was cool as often vegan fake meat dishes struggle to achieve that flavour so I will give them that. We decided to get a dessert and it was date night which my partner and I had not been on in a while due to work obligations. We were enjoying ourselves for a Friday night but when it came time for the bill the server basically interrupted our conversation to hurry us out. That kind of threw me off. Like I get it - it's busy but given that it took forever to get the proper menu then to be interrupted that wasn't cool. The southern tea was pretty good and overall the meal was alright - nothing spectacular but pretty good vegan pub fare. I mean, try it at least once. Maybe the hype lies more in the gluten full meals."}
{"text":"After many visits and several years, I find myself loving Hogtown less and less. It's the same issue I've always had and that is: greasy food makes me feel ill.   Yes, this is an all vegan restaurant, but even things that shouldn't be greasy like mac n cheese, come out swimming in oil. The last time I had it as a side, the ramekin it was served was half way filled with oil. I actually had to pour it out. It was like a soup. I make vegan mac n cheese basically every week using Daiya shreds and it is never even close to being that greasy. They must add a ton of oil, because Daiya + onion + garlic + nooch+ unsweetened plant milk does not come out that greasy.  It's too much and I feel gross for 2-3 hours after eating there and that's after not even eating the whole meal. Most dishes are incredibly salty too.   I still go, but not nearly as often. I also had a crumby experience trying to bring a large group there for brunch once. We planned to show up right when they opened, and I thought I'd give them a heads up. That was a mistake. One of their owners, I'm assuming, sent me this long, ranting email about why they don't take reservations and wasn't even professional enough to sign it with their name.  I just wish they had some lighter menu items like soup in the winter and maybe a non-deep fried or oily sandwich. Same goes for brunch. No option for pancakes and the french toast is practically deep fried and has been hard and burnt both times I've had it. It's just way over the top and not in a good way.  I'm still giving it an a-okay, but you need to have an iron stomach to eat here regularly.  In other news, the chocolate mousse parfait is da bomb. Probably because they didn't add peanut oil and deep fry it.  They now take credit card, which is probably a smart move. The cash only and atm thing was a bad joke."}
{"text":"I have been here twice for brunch.   1) Love the service. The staff is always friendly and helpful. They are welcoming, making for a great dining experience first thing in the morning.   2) The food is fun! The different meals I have tried here have been very good. There are enough options on the menu that I don't feel limited, whilst also not being overwhelmed.   I will definitely keep coming back here - reasonable pricing (as a niche restaurant it is a bit more expensive than the average diner breakfast, but still reasonable), awesome service, yummy food!"}
{"text":"For someone who loves chicken... their un-chicken was surprisingly good!"}
{"text":"I don't think it's entirely fair for me to rate this restaurant, because I am staunchly non-vegan.  However, I do respect those who choose this lifestyle, as I know it's not an easy one to follow.  Give up bacon?  Um, no thank you!  I ended up at The Hogtown Vegan with a friend who was relieved and delighted to be at a restaurant where he could eat everything on the menu.  And while the menu terrified me a bit, I was happy to oblige his request to eat somewhere that was safe.  Admittedly, the thing that bummed me out the most was all the \"un\"-meats on the menu.  The way I look at it, if you're going to give up meat, why bother faking it?  I'd rather see a vegan restaurant do really cool things with grains and veggies then try to perfect fake chicken wings.  But that's just me.  I played it safe and ordered a root beer, a Caesar salad, and a side of French fries.  The salad was good, and the ingredients were very fresh.  The flavour kind of wore on me after awhile (and it was a HUGE salad), but it was still good overall.  The fries, however, were out of this world.  They were easily some of the best French fries I've had in this city.  I'd go again for an order of fries alone.  We topped off dinner with a gluten-free chocolate mousse, which was very rich and had me feeling like a fat kid as I waddled, completely stuffed, out of the restaurant.  Everything is a little on the pricey side, but I expect that out of specialty restaurants.  Also, our waitress was really knowledgable and helpful, and very attentive to us throughout the course of dinner, and that goes a long way.  Long story short, if you're vegan, you'll probably love this joint.  If you're like me and enjoy the not-so-occasional steak, well, you're guaranteed to at least find something you like, but maybe not make it a regular visit."}
{"text":"OMG.  First--  service--  Incredibly attentive and personable wait staff.  Our waitress was the best.  (Jackie, maybe???  Not sure---  The receipt just says \"Jac.\")  And the gentleman working with her was superb, too.  Then---  the food---  Mostly delicious!  The nacho appetizer was to die for.  Seriously these were the best vegan nachos I have ever tasted (and I've had my fair share of vegan nachos).  The pulled pork sandwich was quite good (but I wish it had lettuce, tomato, and pickles instead of slaw).  The Caesar wrap was okay (it was missing the croutons and the dressing was bland compared with other Caesar dressings).  And the phis and chips were INCREDIBLE.  (Well, the phish was incredible...  Chips would have been better if they were crispy or steak cut instead of curly.  They were a bit mushy.)  Though I wasn't fond of the mac and cheese, my partner destroyed it.  And the poutine was out of this world good.  Bottom line--  I would go back in a heartbeat and try some different menu items.  Loved it!!"}
{"text":"The unchicken is SO GOOD.  Man for all my vegan friends out there who have missed the taste of chicken, look no further.  Among their best dishes are the chicken and waffles and the Southern combo, both of which consist of this unchicken products.  I'm told that it is a tofu variation that is breaded and then deep fried, but honestly I can barely tell the difference, and it hasn't been that long since I've had real chicken (maybe 4 months).  In fact, the first time I took a bite, my body almost rejected it, as it was so accustomed to rejecting meat now.  The mac and cheese that came with it was also great, with their 'cheese' variant being quite acceptable.  The collard greens were pretty nasty though, and made the plating of the dish quite dull and ugly, but its good to get your veges in!    My friend had the taco salad, and although that was good, you can get that practically at any bar food place.    If you're expecting healthy at this place, (because it's vegan), you'd be in for a surprise.  They somehow manage to make a vegan diet feel heavy in your stomach.  Most of the things here are processed and deep fried.  There are fries, nachos, and just a bunch of typical dishes you'd find at a bar.  Definitely not your healthiest.  But, no animals were harmed in the making of them (even though it is called Hogtown Vegan.)  So if you're a die-hard vegan that wants to have a cheat day, this is the place to go.  You'll never want for chicken again when you find out the alternatives they have here!"}
{"text":"I don't think I've ever been so upset for choosing a place that served vegan fast food. I've had good vegan and it's just disappointing that it could be like this. I think I'm even more disappointed that a lot of people like it - when you have to compensate for meat and dairy it doesn't mean that you need to make everything extra oily or salty, because that's all that was going on and it was pretty awful. Not to mention uber unhealthy. People if you're going to have junk food just get a good batch of fries somewhere that does GOOD fries. Animal fat excluded obviously."}
{"text":"I've been to Hogtown twice now and the food is always SO GOOD! My favourite vegan place. The first time I went around 7 and had to wait around 30 minutes outside. It kinda sucked they didn't take reservations because of how small the place is. For my birthday, I went with 5 others and was nervous I'd have to wait an hour. Luckily, they made room for me immediately! The unchicken is for sure their best item. I had their chicken and waffles the first time, but the Caesar Unchicken Wrap is SO GOOD. So flavourful and huge!   For newcomers/non-vegans, avoid anything with Daiya cheese or ask them to remove it. My omni brother got the Poutine and was disappointed. Daiya can be very polarizing, personally I think it tastes like chemicals. I'd love to see them use something else and support another independant Toronto business that makes vegan cheeses. Or even try making their own alternatives! I just always hate daiya.. and it's good for people to have options.  The mac and cheese is pretty good, its spicy and vinegary. Not the cheesiest vegan mac and cheese i've ever had but its okay. Always wonderful service and taste though!"}
{"text":"My friends and I tried this place out for the first time. None of us are vegan but it was an interesting little place to try out. It's a small restaurant and it got pretty busy around dinner time. The staff were friendly but they definitely could use more staff on a weekend as they were a bit overwhelmed as the restaurant quickly filled up early.  They make comfort type foods and have a decent size menu. The Fries Supremacy and Chilli \"Cheese\" Fries were very good appetizers and we didn't miss the real cheese in these dishes. The Chilli \"Cheese\" Fries also had a little spicy kick to it.   Unfortunately they ran out of their \"chicken\" for their dinner crowd. So, we had to settle for their \"beef\" with BBQ sauce for their Southern combo. Although the mac and cheese and collard greens were okay it was nothing special and lacked flavour. The BBQ sauce on the \"beef\" was a little odd tasting and we did not eat all the \"beef\" off our plates. It probably would have been better with the battered \"chicken\" option so, maybe it was just an off day.   Dessert was good. We tried an off the menu option of fried Oreo cookies and soy ice cream. It was good but, I have to say the soy ice cream was not the best I've tried. All in all the food was good. The restaurant looks like a rustic diner. Nothing fancy and it was definitely very busy at dinner time. I'd definitely go back for the fries but, I'd try maybe a different main dish or dessert if I go back another time."}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place more stars. We came here during a layover in Toronto and it was by far the best food we ate during our stay. I had the southern combo, my husband had the pulled pork with poutine. I left so legitimately sad about the fact that I couldn't have their mac and cheese every day, I even asked if our server if they could ship their cheese sauce 1,900 miles just so that I could have it again and again. Our server was the sweetest and everyone was so nice. I would honestly come back to Toronto just to eat here again because I already miss it and it's only been 10 minutes. :("}
{"text":"I had a hard time picking a rating. The food was better than any other vegan restaurant I've been to in Toronto but it still wasn't what I'd call good. The service was crappier than most, though, so we'll go 2.5 - 3 stars I guess.   I got the southern combo because I wanted to try both the fake chicken and the mac n cheese. The \"chicken\" was big chunky strips of gardein with a light breading, very satisfying. It came with some bbq sauce which had an intense hit of cumin. I liked the \"chicken\" a lot. The macaroni is absolutely vicious and should be labeled not fit for human consumption. I'm actually a fan of vegan mac, both soy-cheese/daiya based or nutritional yeast based. This was nothing close to either. It was as if someone took macaroni and coated it in Subway's chipotle southwest sauce. It was creamy but there was no cheesey flavor. It wasn't inedible-spicy but it was enough to make my nose run which is nothing I would associate with the mac n cheese experience. It had a nasty acidic bite which I've also never had in mac n cheese, vegan or not. The last straw was the salt. I drink soy sauce out of the bottle. I'll eat a whole package of halloumi in one meal. I love salt. This mac n cheese was too salty for me to enjoy. Gross. There was also a side of collard greens. Greens are greens so I ate it but it was oily, had visible garlic but you literally couldn't taste any garlic, and lacking salt (could have borrowed some from the mac n cheese).   The server didn't refill our water when it was empty. She didn't check in to see how the meal was. When I was using the ATM she said \"the bill is behind you\", not to me, but somewhere off by the bar which I ignored because I surely hoped she wasn't so lazy she would drop it on a random counter instead of taking it to our table. Anyway, it was our bill. She did huffily bring it over. I didn't care much for her.   The last thing I have to say is that I hate the bench seats against the wall. Every time someone wiggled even a little I would feel it. Annoying way to enjoy a meal. I'll probably go back one more time to explore the other \"chicken\" options, but I wouldn't recommend the place to anyone."}
{"text":"AWESOME vegan restaurant! We found this place on Happy Cow.  Amazing service, small almost diner style.  We ordered the Vegan Tofu Omlette and the Tortilla salad with un-chicken....so good all of the way around.  The ingredients are fresh....there is thought and detail into each element that goes into the dish.  There was a ton of flavor.  We would definitely come back and recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Vegan comfort food! I had the taco salad. Twas great.   Decor is basic, a bit retro, a little ikea but also vintage records on the wall. I love the name, although this hogtown does have a lot of vegan places.   Recommended for brunch!"}
{"text":"I find there are not a whole lot of 100% vegan places available where the food is more than just salads, salads, and more cold salads. This place was actually recommended to me by my boss. My boss is Vegan and whenever she is in town for business she would try to look for new Vegan places to try or places where there are Vegan options.   Right off the bat, I really like this place. The staff here are very friendly. I would say this is a very lay back and casual place. The food they serve here is Vegan comfort food. My favorite would have to be the mac and cheese - it is as if I am eating regular mac and cheese. The unchicken is really good too. I think it is made of tofu, but the texture is as if you are eating chicken fingers. I also ordered a ginger beer too with my meal - SO GOOD!   The service was fast, the food was good, and the prices were definitely reasonable. I am so coming back to try out more items on their menu and the mac and cheese."}
{"text":"Granted, the food is advertised as comfort food but from start to finish the experience was less than mediocre.  The food was too salty and oily, and I'm personally appalled to read from other reviewers here that they serve animal products.  I get the unshakeable feeling they have no compassion for the health and well-being of their customers,  and are running an egregious scam."}
{"text":"The Hogtown Vegan is a great place for: A) New vegans who are feeling meet withdrawal  B) Long time vegans looking for some good ol' comfort food  C) People introducing friends to veganism in efforts to convince them we don't all only eat kale salad (even though kale salads are bomb) D) Everybody! (Yeah yeah, I'm cheesy, but it's the truth!)   This place does vegan comfort food perfectly; the dishes are hearty and full of flavour. I highly recommend their Fries Supreme; it's like Taco Bell's fries supreme but a million times better. Taco bell's fries supreme is to a Toyota Camry as Hogtown Vegan's fries supreme is to a Tesla Model 3.   Their Unchicken and Waffles is fantastic as well. The \"chicken\" strips are perfectly crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. I also really liked the sweet potato mash that came with it on the side. It was the perfect consistency; not too runny, not too dry.   The Pulled \"Pork\" Sandwich was unfortunately a miss. The bbq sauce was too sour and it was so saucy that the buns got soggy. I really love sour foods, but the sourness of this bbq sauce was too much.   If you're dining in on a winter day, I recommend you ask for a seat at the back of the restaurant as the draft by the door can be unpleasant.   Overall, great, flavourful vegan comfort food. I recommend trying the fries supreme and Unchicken waffles, and skip the pulled pork sandwich. It is non-vegan boyfriend approved, so meat-eaters don't be so quick to dismiss this place!"}
{"text":"My FAVOURITE restaurant! As a hardcore vegan I find it a challenge to find good food when dining out. It is wonderful to be able to order from a menu and not worry about hidden animal derived ingredients. I usually order the Caesar Wrap and fries. If you miss caesar dressing then you NEED to try this. The last time I went with my husband there was a line out the door waiting for a table. The server apologized for the wait and was attentive and helpful during our meal. I ordered the Phish and chips and it was incredible. I would definitely order it again.  If I could eat at Hogtown Vegan every day I would be a Happy Vegan"}
{"text":"Three words: Vegan Pulled Pork.   I ordered delivery and my mind was blown. The pulled pork was incredible - and so were the fries. Vegan comfort food at its best.   They also sell super cute tote bags."}
{"text":"I'm not vegan.. I'm pescatarian. I used to be a meat lover, but I don't eat it any longer so thought I'd try this. Vegan wings were good. Close to real tasting chicken, the difference would be the texture.  I ordered the unchicken burger with supremacy fries. The fries were good :), the unchicken burger.... meh I think it needs something to cover up the taste of (I'm assuming soy?) they brought me hot sauce which actually made it much better, but I feel like if it had come out covered in something already it would've made the taste better. I think this is a place to try, especially if you're vegan already and used to eating a lot of soy products."}
{"text":"How could I have not yet written a review of Hogtown Vegan? Maybe it's because I want to go there and hog all the macaroni and whatever-stuff-that-is-that's-not-cheese all to myself. Or the chicken-that's-not-actually-chicken-but-you-could-never-tell. That stuff that's the bomb, too. I'd gladly go to Hogtown Vegan anytime, and coming from a die-hard meatatarian like me, that's something."}
{"text":"A friend of mine suggested this place when we asked for good vegetarian places in Toronto. We ordered the waffle and vegan taco with beans and avocado. The tofu omelette was nicely done, however I found the taco to be a bit too oily. Other than that, everything else was good. The chocolate parfait was very tasty too!"}
{"text":"Service was meh but this place churns out a really tasty vegan brunch!   We came around 12:15 pm and were left waiting at the entrance to be seated. Two servers working both noticed us and said \"just a few minutes\" before one eventually told us to just seat ourselves. The tables and patrons here are packed like sardines, so don't expect much comfort or personal space. Hell, you can barely have a private conversation here without hearing those of the people around you.   Waters and menus were brought to us a few minutes after we sat down, but getting any server's attention was basically impossible. Our table was next to the front door and we were blasted with cold air every time it opened, so naturally no one wanted to venture over to check on us after they finally had our order. Thankfully, our food arrived very quickly after and we didn't have any issues. Not like any employees would have known if something was wrong, they didn't return to our table until long after our plates and cups were empty.   Their brunch menu is pretty small and the options feature many of the same ingredients. It seemed pretty clear that everything is prepared beforehand and simply put together once an order comes in. It was fine for us, because the food didn't taste like it was sitting under heat lamps or sloppily prepared, but something to be aware of during brunch. Maybe lunch/dinner service operates differently.  I tried the tofu rancheros and my bf had the waffle sandwich, both with homefries. The homefries were great! Very crispy and cooked well, lightly seasoned and fresh. The rancheros was really delicious as well. Two crispy tortillas (the small kind) topped with black beans, one tofu egg, sliced avocado, diced tomatoes and sunflower sour cream. The tofu egg was made of thin sliced marinated tofu, but it honestly was not full of flavor. The texture was good, although I felt a few more pieces of tofu egg were warranted for the $12 pricetag. The sunflower sour cream was bland, I wouldn't have known it was even on top if I didn't see it. Hot sauce was necessary to fully enjoy the rancheros. I opted to cut the tortillas in half and eat it with my hands, it was much easier than tackling with a fork. Overall, tofu rancheros was great but definitely had room for improvement and was a fairly small dish for a steep price.   The waffle sandwich was very delicious, but a bit bland as well. The waffle was warm and fluffy, tofu egg was fine, tofu bacon was crispy and the sandwich really held together while being eaten. There was some vegan cheese that we thought was actually mayo on the sandwich and a side of maple syrup. I tried a few bites with and without syrup, but felt the syrup tied the whole sandwich together. It made for that perfect sweet and savory bite I expect from a pancake or waffle breakfast.   We both had almondmilk White Russians with our brunch and loved them. Just the right amount of Kahlua and vodka, although I obviously would have preferred some more for being $8 each.   I'd definitely come back to try some lunch/dinner options and hopefully catch the servers on a good, warm day.  Quick edit: I felt sick for the rest of the day after we ate here. Something was too greasy for my stomach, so nausea and bloating subsequently followed."}
{"text":"We love this vegan place where we can order everything on the menu. Their food is hearty & good portion sizes. Their organic beer is good too."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and you'd swear you're eating meat. I'm no vegan or vegetarian but you'd swear you were eating meat. I've had their unchicken and the best nachos I've had. Great wait staff, clean and again great food."}
{"text":"Really really filling food. I had the \"bacon\" cheeseburger with coleslaw side and I couldn't even finish all of the coleslaw (there wasn't even that much coleslaw)! The quesadilla was super good as well. Staff were friendly and the ambiance has a quaint, wholesome ambiance to it. Not too thrilled about how pricey the food and drinks are but I left feeling very satisfied and full so that's all that matters."}
{"text":"Good restaurant for vegan \"meaty\" meals. The food reminds me of diner comfort food. Decent beer options. Good tables and friendly service. If you seat near the entrance you'll be blessed with a nice breeze on warm days. Will be back."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and generally have been disappointed. Their poutine is terrible. The deep fried shiitake mushrooms are good, as are the fish and chips.  If you're looking for vegetarian comfort food, Grasshopper is so much better."}
{"text":"Yay love it! Perfect vegan comfort food. The unchicken is soooo good, Love the unchicken burger and the unchicken and waffles plus the fries are fantastic. Dessert is also amazing, we tried both the pie and the chocolate mousse and I don't usually like chocolatey things but this was heavenly! So so so so so tasty. The servers were super friendly plus they have a good selection of beers on tap."}
{"text":"I live in the neighbourhood and have passed this place a number of times, but not being vegan nor thinking that 'unchicken' sounds particularly appealing have not ventured in. I went for the first time yesterday and left with what I can only describe as a mild case of food poisoning. I had the Hogtown Burger with a side of Mac and Cheese, and I'm fairly sure it was the mac and cheese that did it. I like to think that I have a hardy stomach, but when I got to the bottom of the bowl and saw about 2cm of orange grease I knew I had made a mistake.  In short, if you're in the neighbourhood and want good vegan food that isn't some outlandish combination of tofu/meat substitutes masquerading as soul food then go to Banjara, which is basically right next door. I will never understand this obsession that vegans have with eating meat-like foods. Veggies are delicious in their own right, and I'd rather have a bowl of roast brocolli than tofu drenched in soy cheese."}
{"text":"I've been a couple time food it good i try to order something new every time I had the philly cheese steak there wasn't that great but I did have the pull pork sandwich it was phenomenal"}
{"text":"Don't eat here unless you have no other options.  Chicken waffles are no good. Chicken was meh, waffles were hard af. After being soaked in tasteless syrup for 20 minutes, the last few bites of the waffle were still rock hard and didn't absorb any syrup.  Slow service also.  No thanks."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday. Street parking wasn't too expensive which was good. The place isn't too small but it is narrow, however, it did not get too packed so we got seats right away. They have half booths in the front which was nice and comfy. This is a good place to come if you want heart-attack style vegan junk food. I ordered the french toast banana tofu sandwich, and it was good. The tofu was supposed to be bacon-y but it tasted plain, the peanut butter was not spread out evenly, you cant taste the two banana pieces they give you or the cinnamon in the french toast, but either way it was yummy enough which makes me think if it was done right it would have been so amazing. I had to save half for later because it was so heavy and dripping with so much oil. My partner ordered the soy wings. He wasn't too impressed. He got a side with it (can't remember what it was now) but they ran out and brought him something else without asking what he preferred. That really ticked us off. Service from the beginning was terrible, it was not friendly when we walked in, slow to put in an order, slow to come out, and then it took forever to get the bill. I asked for a take out container which was also forgotten about and I asked someone else later on. Not likely to come back, but I can see the appeal. This place is not exactly a winner for me, you can get food and way better service at any other vegan place that satisfies cravings just as well. I wanted to give it 2 stars but I liked the decor, and the menu options were awesome. Prices are fair as well."}
{"text":"FANTASTICALLY delicious food!  This is, hands down, my favourite vegan restaurant of all time.  It's very different from traditional vegan restaurants and it's a real treat to be able to eat comfort food that's vegan!  This is the only place I can think of that a vegetarian or vegan can have a 'pulled pork' sandwich, or a 'philly cheese steak'.  Even my non-veggie friends quickly lost their scepticism and were blown away by how amazing the food is here.    Unfortunately, the restaurant is a tad small, which is fine unless you're attempting to dine in a large group of people.  We went for my friend's birthday and they had a VERY hard time accommodating six of us.  Thank goodness the rest of the people couldn't make it.  I think if all 12 of us had shown up there is no way we could have all sat together.  I understand it is their policy not to take reservations.  I did call them in advance, just to give them a heads up that we were coming as a group and the lady on the phone was very polite and nice, but calling didn't accomplish anything.  When we got there, it was a fiasco trying to sit us altogether and we ended up having to move several times as other customers finished eating and left their tables to give us enough space to eat comfortably.  So I would definitely recommend eating here to anyone who is wary of vegan food.  You will not be disappointed in the deliciousness of what you get, or in the great wait staff.  My only tip is that larger groups of people should beware of how hard it is to dine here."}
{"text":"All vegan spot. Great selection of food and closes late, 11pm on a Friday night. Only 2 workers but our waiter worked really hard going back and forth. A bit pricey for the entrees ($14).   1. Wings with buffalo sauce ($14 for 10 piece, $9 for 5 piece): 10 medium sized soy chicken pieces came out with barely any buffalo sauce on it. Had to ask the waiter for a side of sauce. It also came with 2 celery sticks and 2 pebble sized \"carrot  sticks\". Was not worth the $14 bucks.   2. Nachos ($9): A basket sized chips with quacamole, black beans, and tomato chunks with green onions. Pretty tasty and decent size to share between 2 people. We had have smashed quacamole and half of an avocado. Guess we came a bit too late for them to smash up the avocado.   3. Unchicken and waffle ($14): 3 pieces of soy chicken, mashed sweet potatoes, and collard greens. Decent size. The collard greens had no taste, felt like it was just boiled. The sweet potatoes was the best part, sweet and cooked just right. Chicken was alright, a bit dry and needed sauce.   4. Southern combo ($14): 3 pieces of soy chicken, mac n cheese, collard greens, and barbeque sauce. Collard greens was bland, soy chicken was much better with barbeque sauce, and mac n cheese was tasty. Mac n cheese tasted like real cheese and came with a good portion. Noodles was perfect chewiness.   Overall, good service, open late, lacking in flavour."}
{"text":"Quick service, delicious food, and best of all, it's vegan friendly. Definitely look forward to stopping in again next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Went here finally for the first time!   I had the southern combo and man was that a lot of food! It was so tasty and I left pretty happy.   I loved the collard greens it was my first time having them...ever. I think I'll be making those more often at home. Not over cooked and the Un-chicken was surprisingly not full of oil and grease dispute being fried.    I really enjoyed the Cajun twist to the Mac and \"cheese\" gave it a lovely kick.   I'd say my only two things were I didn't love the now sauce with the meal. I just didn't like the taste of it, and I found it super dark in the back. And there is little seating in the front where there is light.   Overall I'd come back here for sure. Try some of the other options they've got here.   Even if you aren't vegan I guarantee you'll enjoy this place!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Food is delicious and cool atmosphere.  Looking forward to brunch this morning."}
{"text":"Summary in one sentence - big proportions, just okay taste.   Bias here because I'm vegan and vegan junkfood can be scarce since I don't live downtown. From a more objective standpoint, the food is okay. If you come in with low expectations, you'll like the food. If you're expecting an amazing burger, you'll be disappointed.  To begin, the Hogtown Vegan is fairly costly, but I think the proportions somewhat justify the cost. When eating out, I can stuff myself silly, but I normally can't go beyond a side and entree here.   While you'll definitely be full with just about anything you order, I think the taste can definitely be improved. None of the foods are really \"healthy\" - even though they're vegan. With all the excess vegan cheese, sauces, and meat substitutes, dishes often taste underwhelming and require more spices and seasoning. I've been here a couple times, and the philly cheese steak is always soggy because the excessive cheese drips under the bread. I get that it's a philly cheese steak and more cheese is a good thing, but that shouldn't make the bread taste like a wet sponge. Try to order different things on the menu, some are good, others are just passable.   Overall, their desserts are pretty disappointing. The funnel cake wasn't really funnel cake at all. Way over fried to the point where it was just cinnamon dough crumbs and ice cream. First time I went I had a coconut cookie and I have to say that was the hardest cookie in my life, also pretty bland."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend, it was my first time at a vegan restaurant. I got the Mac and Cheese with Collard Greens and \"fried chicken\". It was delish!! We also got the deep fried Oreos and banana deserts. The Oreos we didn't care for, but the banana dish with the coconut ice cream was outstanding."}
{"text":"Fantastic vegan comfort food, comfy booths in the back, nice selection of drinks. Mac and cheese is amazing. And the deep friend banana split is also amazing. Just overall delicious, a vegan dream (on a comfort food day...)."}
{"text":"it's probably because i am a meat eater, but this food can't fool me. i think i would appreciate it more if i, like, missed eating meat.   it's good tho and i am always up for it when my vegan friends want to eat here."}
{"text":"Super tasty! Would definitely recommend and go back again! Would not even know it was vegan :)"}
{"text":"First vegan restaurant I've been too and it sure was better than I expected vegan food to be!"}
{"text":"It's not the fact that you are terribly understaffed every time I come in, or that the food is salty as heck. It's not the fact that I sat there on August 9th, 2015 at 7:15pm for 15 minutes, 10 of those without a menu, (still ok. You were busy) but that you took the order of a couple that was there for 5 minutes BEFORE you took mine. THAT'S why I left pissed off and out of my mind with anger. I wish you guys could get it together there. I feel bad for the servers because either a) you are perpetually understaffed or b) it's your first gig and are just inefficient. Either way, something needs to be done."}
{"text":"As an avid meat eater and appreciator of unique foods, I was excited to try a vegan's take on comfort food.  But, what could have been a delicious meal was marred by unimaginative food that left our whole table saying \"meh.\"  The Unchicken and Waffles, arguably their most popular dish, was an utter disappointment. The deep fried tofu pieces, which weren't entirely terrible tasting, were clearly pre-frozen from a bag. It wasn't so much mock fried chicken as it was a mock chicken mcnugget - if a chicken mcnugget lacked flavour and a soul. Not really the big \"fried chicken\" piece I was expecting from my previous encounters with the much better meat version. (Can't they do something cool with Seitan and some homemade batter?).  The collard greens were way too oily, they literally coated my mouth - not the most pleasant vegetables I've ever tasted - and you'd think veggies would be their wheelhouse considering they're a VEGAN restaurant.   Lastly, the waffle was cold and the syrup had way too much cinnamon in it, overpowering all the other flavours.  All negatives aside, their Supremacy Fries (their vegan take on Taco Bell's Fries Supreme) were totally palatable... Not out of this world or spectacular by any means, but they were fine.  In conclusion, Hogtown misses the mark in multiple areas. They have an opportunity to create really delicious, interesting meat free alternatives to soul/comfort food, yet everything falls disappointingly flat.   TL;DR - It wasn't the lack of meat that ruined the meal, it was the lack of effort."}
{"text":"Sodium overload!!!!! My first time here and perhaps I ordered the wrong items. Tried the faux chicken wings which were battered pieces of triangle shaped tofu. I would have preferred a denser tofu for simulated meat. The dill sauce and hot sauce for dipping were good. The battered crust could have been a bit thicker and was slightly on the salty side. For my main, I ordered the biscuit sliders which consisted of a faux sausage patty and mashed potatoes inside a biscuit topped with gravy and peas with a side of fries.  The fries were similar to Swiss Chalet fries except with way way WAY too much salt.  After getting about half way through the meal, the salt not only in the fries, but in all of the ingredients in the sliders as well overwhelmed me. There was nothing to cut through the saltiness except for the peas, and there weren't enough of them to balance the palette. On the bright side, the a/c was working this day, which other reviewers had complained about being broken."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, my expectations and hopes were a bit dashed by this one! As a vegetarian, I frequent vegan restaurants and usually enjoy mock meats.   The service here was good, very friendly and warm server with a bright smile. Food came very quickly, but we were almost alone in the restaurant.   The fried \"clams\" were yummy, but could have used seasoning in the batter and less vinegar in the sauce.   The Philly cheesesteak was a lot of bread - a lot! But it wasn't too bad - had a fantastic texture/appearance but tasted distinctly of mock meat.   The unchicken and waffles ... I hate to do this, but the chicken tasted like any other mock meat, the waffles were dry, the mashed sweet potatoes oddly sweet and the collard greens neeededdddd spices.   All in all I'm glad others enjoy this place so much but I much prefer vegan restaurants that don't specialise in imitation food. I love southern food! I wish there was cornbread here. I expected it to be way greasier than it actually was, which was a nice surprise.   No repeat visit for me. :("}
{"text":"It's nice to have place that vegans can enjoy without worrying if something has egg or meat"}
{"text":"This is my favourite vegan restaurant! They have a huge selection of comfort food. Their mac and cheese is super tasty. For an entrée I would recommend the  Un-Chicken Caesar Wrap or the Pulled Pork Sandwich. The Big Hog is also a fave. The staff are generally social (some more than others) but they are always helpful. You need to check this place out."}
{"text":"Go to their brunch. Get the unchicken and waffles. You will not be disappointed.   This place proves that vegan food doesn't have to be just boring salads or beans. I'm not vegan, and I think even someone that eats chicken would be impressed with the unchicken here--it's perfectly crispy. My friend got a vegan omelette with Daiya \"cheese\" that was also tasty, and I rarely like Daiya!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try Hogtown Vegan for quite awhile.  I was so disappointed. I was expecting a healthy and tasty meal. Everything was so artifical. I think I was expecting homemade sauces not just melted Diaya. My mac and cheese was greasy and spiced so strangely. The guacamole was good but the salsa that came with it was mainly huge chunks of onion. The table service was poor, no one came to check on us or refill drinks. Found it slightly overpriced. Can't say I'll be back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Came here again recently and just thought i'd update from my last review 2 years ago.  staff still really friendly. wings still tasted good but still underwhelming- my last review mentioned this too, so obviously that's just how they are here. they aren't unpleasant, I just wouldn't get them again.   This time I got the beef stew and dumplings, which was great but the dumplings were a little rubbery. I enjoyed the meal but it wasn't something i'd have again.  I can't help feeling that even though the food is good, it's just a little overpriced."}
{"text":"If you're waffling between two options, don't chicken out. I think you know what I mean.   I come from DC, a land of plentiful vegan mac & cheese and collards, but Hogtown's chicken and waffles are something special.  Service was super quick and friendly even though it was just one person waiting on the late lunch crowd on a Friday."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews, I decided to check out Hogtown Vegan. I ordered the Philli steak sandwich- I was extremely disappointed. The fake meat was rubbery and there was no flavour. I also ordered the chili fries-this was okay. I expected to eat some amazing Vegan food and I came home disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been to Hogtown a few times, most recently for Saturday brunch with 2 friends. It's conveniently located a couple blocks east of Dufferin Station.  We got the 5 pc wings in BBQ sauce ($9), they taste like boneless chicken tenders *drool*. The Fried French Toast Sliders ($12) were 2 mini french toast sandwiches stacked high with PB, banana, and tofu bacon - very good. The un-Chicken and Waffles ($14) never fails to disappoint and is my go-to for brunch there - but beware: order this with a size of homefries and you will have a HUGE portion on your hands. The Tofu Rancheros ($13) is also a generous portion if you want a more colourful/healthy option for brunch. All the mains we ordered came with a side of homefries or chef salad.   Service is super friendly and the interior is cozy. Prepare to wait a bit for a table if you come during a rush hour period - it's worth it. And if you're like me and aren't a huge fan of dressing, you might want to order it on the side because they are heavy handed with dressing on their chef salad.  Definitely come here if you want a huge choice of vegan comfort food options and generous portions - this place never fails to impress."}
{"text":"I almost missed out on this place during my first Canadian trip.  Thanks to my friends, we got to go and everyone tried out the food.  We shared the poutine, nachos, and chocolate mousse parFait.  My meat-eating friends LOVED it.  I wish I had more time to enjoy more of the menu items.  It's definitely a place that represents comfort food, vegan style."}
{"text":"We came hoping to get some healthier fare. Vegan food should be at least that. Everything on the menu was fried and we had very little to choose from. While others would call this \"comfort food\" I disagree. We ordered the comfiest of comfy foods, mac and cheese, which turned out to be overcooked elbows swimming in vegan cheese sauce. I love salt, but this stuff was over-salted to an extreme. We ordered a salad because there just wasn't anything else healthy on the menu. Since we were only in town for the weekend, we only hit a few places in TO. I understand that vegans may want to experience what bar-b-que places can provide for meat eaters, but they also want healthy food. I'm not sure you can do both. Ultimately we were disappointed that we had wasted one of our get-away meals at The Hogtown Vegan."}
{"text":"Went to celebrate a friend's birthday, our selection was from the brunch menu. We decided to order family style where we all get a serving of each order. We ordered the home fries as an appetizer, and for entrées the tortilla salad, BLT, PB and Jelly sandwich, and unchicken and waffles.  Dessert we had the fried banana split and chocolate mousse.  I can say everything we ate was delicious.  However if you do not care for fried food, then choose something other than the PB and jelly.   I will be returning again soon to try out their lunch offerings.  Our waiter was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Food was good and service was great as well she knew her menu. All I can say was my sweet potato fries was a bit on the burnt side. But all was good here will defiantly be coming back with a few friends."}
{"text":"I love rare steak and I also love Hogtown vegan.   unchicken and waffles. omg. delicious. go now and nom.   the tofu wings were so flavourful...I like tofu but I really didn't think it could ever taste as good as these wings did.   collard greens? i'm craving them now. and the fries supremacy was great, especially considering how terrified i normally am of vegan milk products.  basically you should eat there, vegan or carnivore.   also they have booze now, and hoptical illusion on tap (i think?)."}
{"text":"Great service. Mellow atmosphere and amazing food. I was surprised at the taste of all the dishes we tried (guac and chips,  'chicken and waffles', Hogtown burger with fries supremacy. Even my meat living companion was impressed and couldn't tell the difference. This is a must if you want good ol comfort food without the animals. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"We actually visited twice today, once for brunch and once for dinner. Upon entering the first time, we were immediately turned around to an ATM as we were informed that they were cash only. The chicken is amazing but everything else needed more salt/flavour (esp tofu bacon, breakfast potatoes, anything with \"cheese\"). We will travel far and pay a lot of money for good food, this was... Okay."}
{"text":"I have been to this location three times twice to dine once for takeaway. I must say the food is consistently good. I have had the Unchicken Burger, Unchicken wrap and their Philly Cheesesteak all with a side of Mac and Cheese. I find that Paprika tends to be their main seasoning of choice which I'm not fond of. The food lacks additional seasoning. On another note the Philly Cheesesteak was a disappointment, it's a runny cheese (watery consistency)and a bloody mess to eat and not at all pleasant.  Otherwise service is fairly decent and I do enjoy the quaintness and space as it gives a more intimate feel. A decent atmosphere for a date.   I recommend the Unchicken burger or Wrap. It's so good I brought my non-vegan friend to dine. She couldn't believe vegan food could be that good."}
{"text":"Dropping to a zero star given the aggressive emails I have received since posting my original review.  Pretty much proves my point this is a very judgmental and angry place.    Also proving my point this is not a healthy option?  The Toronto Star review on caloric, sodium etc intake with one of their top sellers - google it, Yelp doesn't allow hyperlink posts   Hogtown sucks"}
{"text":"It is wonderful to go to a place where I as a vegetarian can eat everything on the menu without asking any question about stock, lard etc. Hogtown vegan provides vegan comfort food, southern style. If that feels like a contradiction, that's part of their charm.  Went with my ten year old son when we were by ourselves. The portion sizes are huge. We ordered their poutine and one if their combos that included sweet potatoes, waffles and collard greens. Everything was quite tasty, maybe a bit on the mild side. The hot sauce did add flavour. Others around us seemed to order the Mac and \"cheese\" as well as some rather monumental sized burgers.  They use Daiya cheese which I believe is made from Soy. While the taste is different, it's quite good and the texture is perfect.  Don't go there expecting normal comfort food. This"}
{"text":"Excellent place for vegan comfort food. Visited on a Sunday evening and we were seated quite quickly, despite how small the place is. Service is courteous and friendly. I always thought that they were cash-only (it's even on the website), but I'm pretty sure I saw someone pay with plastic -- the waitress brought one of those card payment machines to the table next to ours. I'm not sure what's up with that.  The food is quite delicious -- definitely comfort food. Their fake chicken stuff is spot-on. We ordered the wings as appetizers (in buffalo sauce) and I had the chicken burger -- enjoyed them both. I will say that the chicken burger patty was a relatively generic one, pretty sure I could buy that off the shelf of a vegetarian food store. My friend had the unchicken and waffles and it looked awesome. The only thing we weren't particularly impressed with was the mac and cheese. Both my friend (who is vegan) and I (not vegan) felt that it was not particularly satisfying as far as mac and cheeses go.   By the way, in case you missed the point, it's comfort food, and not exactly something meant to be particularly \"fresh\" or \"healthy.\" It's all about the heavy sauces and meat alternative products here. So if you're the type of hipster that's trying to avoid processed foods, eat raw, and more or less graze like a cow, I'd skip this joint. As for myself, I don't allow my vegetarianism to prevent me from indulging and enjoying food, so I'll be going back, from time to time."}
{"text":"Still love this place.  Since my first review, I've been back twice. I don't live super close and it's an uphill bike ride :(  They've applied for a licquor license. I saw the sign in the window last time I was there. Yaay! Hopefully they'll get it, since I would still love to have a beer with my meal.  I also tried the unchickn waffles. They were as good as I thought they would be, maybe even better.  They started a brunch too! It was very good, but it was obviously just their normal menu re-arranged into brunchy food. They have a good tofu scramble though."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan, I'm not even a vegetarian. I work near-by and was curious so decided to go in with some friends. I ordered a veggie burger. (I also tried some poutine and mac and cheese from my friends). The veggie burger was good, not phenomenal. The fries were great, however. I could see how their \"cheese\" would satisfy that craving for a vegan but it's not for me. Also, this is NOT healthy food, haha."}
{"text":"Conveniently located on Bloor close to the subway line and also has a bunch of pay parking lots just behind it. This is a vegan restaurant so keep in mind that there is no actual meat on the menu.  It has a warm rustic vibe and the staff is always really nice. For faux meat (less) dishes no-one on the GTA does it better. Every meal is done perfectly and full of flavor.  We have been coming here for a while now and have always been happy with the experience."}
{"text":"Tried this spot for brunch today with a mix of couple of friends - some vegetarian and some not. We all had some wings for the table, which were yummy!   For my main I tried the \"chicken\" and waffles, which was decent. The portions were huge and the prices were decent too. Others got the waffle sandwich, the Mac n \"Cheese\" and the omelette.   I just thought the flavours of the \"chicken\" could have been a bit better. Also, even though my friends liked their meals, they weren't blown over. This place might be a bit over hyped. I personally prefer Doomies nearby for their flavours.   The service was good and the servers were friendly. Parking is available on the street or behind the restaurant by Green P."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan personally, but both of my parents are so we often dine out at vegan places around the city.  Hogtown isn't by anymeans bad, it's actually quite good, I'm just not blown away by it. I won't lie, part of this reaction could be because I spent about a year hearing vegan friends lose their minds over how much they loved this place before I finally went, so my expectations were through the roof. We usually go in groups of 3 or 4 so I've tried a good chunk of the menu and everything is tasty and well thought out.  If you have a specific comfort food craving or are missing things you used to eat back in the day, Hogtown is a good place to be."}
{"text":"I'm the type of girl that feels like a meal... or life is incomplete unless there is meat.  I love meat of all kinds; red meat, white meat, cooked meat, raw meat! Haha So having a vegan meal is a rare occasion.    I came here a few months ago with a carnivorous first-timer whom had doubts about this place.  We were greeted, then asked to sit wherever we like except for the four-tops.  It was around 7:30, and there were maybe 3 other tables dining at the time.  But understandingly, we chose the best two-top available... or so we thought.  The whole dining experience, we had to keep moving our chairs out of the way so servers and other diners can go through 'cause the tables were so close together!  Definitely NOT fun considering when other people walked in, they sat wherever they wished and the restaurant wasn't even full by the time we left.  Anyway, we ordered:  Unchicken and Waffles: $13 (4/5 stars) Definitely not chicken, but pretty darn close!  Battered deep fried soy never tasted so good, served with collared greens and sweet potato mash.  The collard greens and sweet potato had good flavours, but greasy.  Southern Combo: $13 (3.5/5 stars) More deep fried soy chicken, this time served with collard greens and mac 'n' soy cheese with a side of BBQ sauce.  The chicken tastes better with the maple butter from the waffles, but the mac 'n' soy cheese was a hit though a little greasy.  BBQ sauce kind of sucked.  All in all a good dish and great price!  Service: 2.5/5 stars Not amazing.  They took our orders and brought us our food.  They also limited our seating options and kept making us move around so they can get through.  I understand they were afraid it was going to get busy, I also understand that we chose that table... but  since it wasn't busy, they could have offered us the other four-tops that were free and out of the way.  I guess being a vegan wouldn't be so bad... only if I can eat deep-fried UNchicken all the time. HAHA"}
{"text":"It's okay... food kind of standard. Not sure why so many people love it here.  While the staff were nice to me the times I went there, I do know several people who were treated poorly and were given pretty bad service.  Meh food + snotty staff + totally inaccessible space = never going back."}
{"text":"I went here today for lunch. It was 4 of us and the restaurant had ample room for seating. 3 of us are meat eaters so we weren't at all used to the stuff on the menu but we were really curious and open to try. To start we had the oysters and chili cheese fries. They were both really delicious. For my main meal I had the southern combo. I asked for more collard greens than mac and cheese but really ended up with a lot of collard greens, which I was fine with. The mac and cheese was hmmmm, okay. I didn't really like it. I had fair warning that a lot of daiya at once isn't really enjoyable. I found it kind of sweet which I didn't like. I really love mac and cheese though and I like it savoury so I wasn't feeling this. The collard greens were great. Didn't even notice it was missing bits of meat that typically go with Southern collard greens. The \"chicken strips\" were delicious. I honestly didn't even realize that it wasn't meat. The service was good. The guy serving us seem to be the only one manning the front and he just seemed like he could've used a little backup. We had to flag him down to order. But he was nice and knowledgeable about the menu. I think it's important to keep in mind that this is a vegan junk food spot. It's not at all like Fresh and not trying to be. Vegans need to indulge too! Great spot, highly recommend."}
{"text":"It doesn't matter if you're vegan, you need to try this place. I was blown away by their buffalo wings, they are so damn good. I can't believe it's not chicken."}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times & would go back. I don't however think this is the best vegan place in town.   The atmosphere is very cozy. It's not the biggest place but it can fit a lot of people. It can get very busy at night. With all the people comes noise so just something to keep in mind. The service has always been good. Nothing amazing but it wasn't bad.    The menu is a good size with lots of vegan comfort food. I've tried a lot on the menu from the mac & cheese, chicken burgers, chicken wings, nachos to the guacamole & chips. My favourite things I've had have been the mac n cheese & chicken burger. I have in the mean time gone gluten free so I can no longer eat those items. I like the fact that they have a separate gluten free vegan menu but so far the different dishes I've had have been nothing to ride home about. Very basic, kinda boring."}
{"text":"Place was okay... Sangria I has was watery & unflavorful, but got me buzzed. That was part of the point of the drink, but I like a craftily concocted cocktail or elixir & this one was not.  But, (I'm using a lot of buts...) the unchicken & waffles was quite okay. They used veggie meat & they did quite a good job making it like chicken. Since I can't do Roscoe's cause I'm a veggie, this spot did the trick. If Roscoe's was in Europe it would be a different story...  It hit the spot. Came with sweet potato mash and collard greens on the side. It was all super healthy. No crazy amounts of butter or oil. Yet, it tasted amazing. But it definitely could have used a side of syrup. What was on there wasn't nearly sufficient enough.  The atmosphere was not to my liking. Very cafe-like and crowded.  But it's an alright spot. I may or may not go back."}
{"text":"Normally after a weekend of heavy indulgence, I like to try to get a veggie or vegan dish.   I thought I'd give this place a try since it was near me. I was very impressed by how pleasant and attentive the staff were, which is the only reason why this place gets two stars.  I tried the Tortilla Salad for takeout, and let's just say that after 2 forkfuls I had to throw it in the garbage. Talk about extremely vinegary dressing. It was so overpowering that it was unbearable. All I could taste was vinegar.   Considering how hungry I was, it's pretty bad that I couldn't get past 2 forkfuls. If I had sat down and ate it, I definitely would have sent it back."}
{"text":"Very similar to Veggie Grill in the USA which does amazing magic to make you think you're eating meat but you're not!  Great place to trick your carnivore friends. Love it and will return and order from it often. Service is the best. Prices are cheap. Food is top rate."}
{"text":"Came here with a few friends for a birthday dinner. Let me just say that I'm a huge carnivore - meat is my bae - but I will eat vegan/vegetarian things once in a while.   It's a pretty narrow restaurant and to be honest I didn't pay much attention to the decor since we were sitting in the back booth.   Let's start the food reviews with the best thing that you have to try when you come here - the poutine. Between the 4 of us we had 3 poutines. It was yummmm. I had the phish and chips as my main subbing the fries with poutine and I liked it a lot. I wasn't sure what to expect but the taste and texture was good. The only thing was the batter was very thick and filling. I tried a bit of my friends \"unchicken\" with BBQ sauce and mac n cheese which was really good too.   The prices are what you would pay for a non-vegan/vegetarian meal so I can't complain. I would definitely come back for that unchicken and poutine."}
{"text":"Very pleasantly surprised. What can i say,  normally I'm not impressed by vegetarian restaurants, and particularly dislike 'mock-' and 'unchicken' type dishes. .. But Hogtown Vegan nailed it. I had their unchicken and waffles and not only was it good, it was better than at pretty well any non-vegetarian place I've tried it. Others had the macaroni and 'cheese' which was quite good, but didn't quite achieve the rich cheesiness I would crave.   They also offer a good selection of gluten free dishes and replacements.  Cheery servers, although it was full (lineup out the door) and kitchen was having trouble keeping up I think. Recommended for vegans and carnivores."}
{"text":"I love vegetarian food but rarely find vegan dishes appetizing. Came here with a few friends as I was encouraged by all the positive reviews. Most were non-veg and weren't very enthusiastic about their choices. Even the vegetarian in the group wasn't very impressed. She got the Southern Combo and really liked the unchicken although not the rest. I tried the mac 'n cheese from her dish and was put off. The texture was fine but the flavour was an odd spicy flavour - not appetizing at all. I had the Unchicken Burger. The unchicken was very good but the rest of the burger very plain with no flavour - it really needed better toppings. We tried the fried oreos which was the only item I though was enjoyable. The staff was very friendly and attentive though, which helped me add another star to my review. This might be considered good for strict vegans, but don't think most non-vegetarians would enjoy it...."}
{"text":"We are not vegan, but a family with severe allergies to dairy, egg, nuts, fish and beef. There were safe, tasty options for us, which is very rare to find!!  Thank you so much!  The \"chicken\" and waffles was VERY good. Liked the funky ambience."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for a while, and I'm glad I made the trip! The staff was very nice, quick service. Small place but good atmosphere. I went at 1:30ish and they were still serving brunch. It might be a wait around dinner time, or you can do takeout I believe. Portion size is good as well, couldn't finish the whole meal, very filling!   My boyfriend and I got the unchicken and waffles+ mac and cheese. The chicken and mac and cheese do have that slight \"soy\" taste that some may not be used to, but would do ya expect, its made from soy, but still super delicious. The waffle and the spiced syrup was amazing! Even my non-veggie boyfriend really loved his meal.   Recommend for anyone to try!"}
{"text":"Their unchicken and waffles entree is one of the best dishes in the city.  Not one of the best \"vegan\" dishes.   One of the best meals.  Period.  If I was on vegan death row.   This is what I'd get as my last meal.    Either that, or some meat."}
{"text":"I went here with a vegan friend.  The first couple times, I'll admit I was hesitant. I ate some of the stuff and it was tasty.  But the third time I went I decided to go whole hog(town).    I ordered the fried chicken with mac n' cheese and collard greens, and you wouldn't know was vegan.  Well, the greens, sure.  But the cheese sauce was a delight, and the fake chicken fooled me.    Honestly, I kind of need more vegan friends, because it's well worth the visit."}
{"text":"If you like super-processed \"comfort food\", you'll like this place, they're also licensed, which is a good thing. I'm not used to processed food so I didn't feel well after my meal but my friends loved what they ordered and felt fine afterwards :)  The service was alright.  If you're vegan and like junk food, this place is a must-visit at least once."}
{"text":"soggy greens and over processed and fried vegan food. I seriously felt sick after this."}
{"text":"Planned to stop here way before leaving for Toronto from Tampa. Ended up being my last stop prior to leaving and easily was one of the highlights of my trip. I ordered 10 buffalo wings and a basket of fries to go and the food was ready by time I got there. The Unchicken was well prepared and had a similar consistency of actual meat. The buffalo sauce was full of flavor and not too spicy but definitely had a mild kick. I ordered the fries well done and they were perfect. Next time I'm in Toronto I will be sure to stop by a few times. Great vegan goodness."}
{"text":"Hogtown has the best vegan burgers - tastes like the real deal to me! My bf is a huge meat eater, but even he's impressed with the food here.   The food here reminds me of the food I usually see on the TV show, Drivers Diners and Dives - greasy meaty burgers, loaded fries, huge portions etc. Except it's all vegan here, of course.   One negative thing about this place, is that the service sucks. They're always short staffed, so it's almost impossible to ever flag down a waitress. The servers are always in a rush, so don't expect them to greet you when you come in, or ask about your day, when you're paying for the bill at the end."}
{"text":"The Po-Boy is amazing. Deep fried pickled mushrooms?!?!? Yes please! My friend's fries were perfect, I had the collards- they could have used more flavour. I can water steam greens at home. Give me more. My table, as a whole, really loved the food and atmosphere and we'll be back.  If I was going to be critical, I'd say the waitress was nice but didn't go out of her way for anything. I'd love to see a few more gluten free substitutions/options and non-soy fake meat options. If they can do that to the shitakes to make them taste soooooooooooo good, I bet whoever is in the kitchen can do wonders with more natural ingredients.  I'd go back again for sure though. Great food, music, prices, neighbourhood...."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, and I was very excited to go for lunch here today because of the great reviews.  However, after my meal I was pretty disappointed and underwhelmed.   The Reuben wasn't great.  The seitan had a weird after taste (that is still in my mouth hours later) and the rest of it was bland.  Many years ago there was the best vegan reuben in town at the Junctions now defunct The Vegetarian Restaurant.  It had so much flavor and was incredible.  This one paled in comparison.  Fries supremacy were ok but not amazing.  I will say that my server was great - very nice, the food came super-fast, and it wasn't crowded, so that was good.  I live close by and will probably come back at some point to try other items on the menu...but i won't be re-ordering what I had today."}
{"text":"Very cute place ... ideal for vegetarians, try their buffalo wings & fish & chips it's outstanding"}
{"text":"Apparently the non-brunch menu is where the party is at.  Because when I went, it was a train wreck.  Walked in - two waitresses hanging out.  They got us to a table, and then chatted with each other for five, ten, thirteen minutes before coming back.  We were about to stand up and wander over to them, but right at that moment they remembered we existed.  Strike one.  I ordered the unchicken and waffles.  It was around fourteen bucks.  I wouldn't pay that price for regular chicken and waffles, and was not pleased paying that much for a version without chicken (but I was with a vegan so, it was what it was.)  The prices?  Strike 2.  The flavour of the unchicken and waffles? Amazing!  (We'll call this a single...  prevents a review of one star.)  Super good.  It tasted like chicken and waffles.  I was impressed.  I couldn't believe that such replication would be possible.  But it was.  And there was syrup a plenty.  The person I was with had the French Toast.  I don't know what happened to it - and since we'd never been here before, I assume it was how they intended it to be - but it was almost as if it were deep fried.  But not just deep fried - burnt and deep fried.  It was pretty much inedible.    If I had that meal, I would have asked for a replacement, or something that resembled human food.  Look - two stars for a place where only half the food was fit for human consumption seems generous to me.  That being said, I must stress - unchicken and waffles was a neat experience."}
{"text":"Pricey but delicious. Chicken fingers were bomb. Good service. Fresh comfort food vegan. I have to say that I hated the poutine though. Whatever mock cheese they use tasted very strange like a pass due goat cheese"}
{"text":"This place has great food - any item of the menu seems amazing. I had the southern plate and the BBQ wings and I full recommend them. My new favorite place in Toronto.  The waitress is grumpy, which gives this a feel to my home in NYC. And makes it an oasis among the usual extremely friendliness and conflict avoidance of Canadians.  The whole place reminds me of \"food swings\" in Williamsburg, NYC - unfortunately they had to close due to the high rent."}
{"text":"Don't bother eating here unless you're a vegan with questionable standards.   The menu looks like a fun take on comfort food, but their execution sucks. I've been three times, and have been disappointed every single one. The only reason I've visited that many times is that I'm vegetarian, my boyfriend is vegan, and it's an easy place to meet up with veg friends. Still not worth it.   Unchicken and Waffles is the top item here, so let's take a look. The Unchicken has varied quite a bit over my visits, but tends to be somewhat mushy inside. The breading tasted like dust smells the first time I ate it, but I haven't had that problem since. The waffles are the worst I've ever had: dry, rubbery, and incredibly bland. Pretty sure they make them in advance and then just warm them up before serving. I would prefer a defrosted Eggo. The syrup is incredibly diluted, and just compounds the core problem: this dish tastes like nothing.   The Waffle Sandwich was even more problematic. Two of those big rubber waffles surrounding a few scraps of tofu and some Daiya. Bland on bland on bland, with texture to match. I was going to split it with my SO, but decided to save myself the effort of chewing after the first bite.   The mac and cheese may satisfy some longterm vegans, but just made me sad. Kind of plasticky tasting, lacked seasoning. I could almost hear my mac-obsessed inner child crying out in disappointment.   Salting has been uneven across the board in past visits, but is never quite right. Service tends toward minimal, with longish waits for food that is never worth the time. And the prices! I've decided not to return after paying $20 (including tax and tip) for unchicken and waffles that I really didn't enjoy.   In short, just don't bother. You can enjoy much better food almost anywhere else. That includes veg options. Get better vegan comfort food at Doomie's, save your money and time for a trip to Awai, enjoy a casual lunch of BBQ tofu at One Love, or consider making the trip out to Doug McNish's Public Kitchen (I'm not crazy about that place either, but it's still better than this). You would even have a better experience at Fresh or Kupfert & Kim, and they tend to"}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan but I've tried to be, and I like to eat vegan in a lot of my meals. I was disappointed with this place for a couple of reasons. First of all, every one of the options was basically a recreation of something with meat or a boring salad with romaine lettuce. I don't mind a couple of these things, but not all vegan food has to be a recreation of meat dishes. Secondly, it was just expensive. My meal, the a unchicken wrap with collards instead of fries was $13.50. That's just horribly expensive for what it is. I have to admit that I was dreading the meal when I saw the menu but the food itself was actually surprisingly tasty. If the price was better I could see frequenting this place on occasion. As is though, I'll keep looking for something else."}
{"text":"Parking: It's located downtown on Bloor so you'll have to pay for parking during day hours. Finding spots is random.  Venue: It's a small venue with 3 side booths and 4 tables? You can definitely bring a group of up to 5 or so with you.  Washrooms: Clean, well stocked and maintained.  Experience: I've been here a number of times, if I keep coming back to your establishment, it means I really like it! The food is great, I'm a fan of the Mac and \"cheese\" and especially the \"buffalo wings\". I've also tried their poutine and vegetarian burger. The burger was quite greasy, but what's to expect from a place that serves comfort food. Even as a vegan it's not the healthiest choice of food but it sure as hell tastes good."}
{"text":"I rarely rate anything 5 stars, but Hogtown has a special place in my heart. The expanded menu, which was introduced in December 2011, is something to check out. Tempeh ribs are bomb. The tofu wings are a bit smelly and might irritate the neighbouring customers, but they are also delish.  And yes, they are licensed now! That means I can have a glass of wine!  The only thing that I have against this place is that they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Vegan spots.  Love the sweet potato mash and collard greens as sides on all the dishes. Have had almost all the options and there isn't a single one I wont have again. All so good!  The Mac n Cheese they serve is amazing, as well and a unChicken n Waffles. UnChicken Wrap is sooo tasty! The service is always friendly and quick. Great spot close by! Will visit soon again."}
{"text":"Bar none my favourite veg place in the city (so far). Nothing about this place is healthy, but pretty sure that's the point; even vegans deserve guilty pleasure comfort food.   I've tried practically everything here, and continue to return. Southern combo plate is the best way to try a few things, but I've honestly never had anything I didn't like.   Meat eaters don't seem to mind joining me, but for vegans especially, this place is pretty great."}
{"text":"Their chicken wings are amazing! I've never had real chicken wings so I can't compare, but they taste really good in their own right. The sauce on the wings is perfect and they're perfectly crunchy. We always drive in from west Mississauga just to eat here."}
{"text":"Hogtown vegan is great! For anyone who eats vegetarian, it's fun and refreshing to have analogues of traditional meat-based meals. Vegetarian junk food is a good description of the food here!   Cash only - SO annoying!"}
{"text":"Arrived just before 6pm on a Saturday, nabbed a seat by the big window, and watched as a steady stream of people filed in and packed the place.   Nachos as the appetizer - found ourselves scraping the bottom of the basket for the delicious sauce that was leftover. The southern combo was just as delicious - liked that the \"chicken\" tenders came plain and the sauce was on the side. Skipped out on the garlic collard greens since my stomach doesn't handle garlic."}
{"text":"Organic food, organic beer, vegan fare following the recent years' trend of making it be mock meat like Unchicken, Poutine, Beef and so on (I think this whole trend started in Toronto with Vegetarian Haven on Baldwin). The food is really good. I would never eat poutine, but The Hogtown vegan's version is really good with lots of taste that does not clog the heart. The premise is well designed, cleaned and looks like a formal restaurant of any kind and not like a Bohemian vegan place at all. The poutine arrived in a basket like those served in a pub. Prices are also on-par. Thumbs up."}
{"text":"They should change their name to The Hogtown Unvegan or take \"Vegan\" out of the name completely.  Let me explain.  This used to be one of my favourite places, and it seemed like it was getting progressively better over the first year it was open. But from there, the food was way less consistent (over/undercooked fries, big variation in portions, and even burned veggie burgers!). And more importantly, the customer service proved to be just horrible. My friends and family were really good, loyal customers, and without any explanation they basically just froze us out when we pointed out that an item on their menu that we had independently known to be non-vegan, even though they'd previously encouraged this type of feedback. So weird!   If that's how they treated us, after all of the support we gave that business, I think that speaks volumes about how they view their customers and the legitimacy of their \"vegan\" business.  I'll never be going back to Hogtown unless something significant changes at the management level."}
{"text":"It was packed with a bit of a lineup but the hostess was super friendly, took my name and told me it would just be a short wait.  I've been here a few times before and stuck to their most popular items the \"unchicken waffles\" and mac and \"cheese\" which were awesome.  This time I tried some new items, started with the nachos $9 which come loaded with black beans, diced tomato, green onions, vegan cheese,  and some kind of vegan sour cream made out of sunflowers (sounds weird but hey it's good!).  I then had the Hogtown burger, which is just a classic burger with soy patty, pickles, onions and comes with fries or coleslaw $11. Simple but very good.  It's rare I get to eat a burger out as places usually cook on the same grills as the regular meat ones, I love knowing that coming here there are no meat juices cross contaminating my food.  Obviously vegans love this place but I recommend bring your carnivore friends here too, it's really fun to see how surprised they are that they like vegan food!"}
{"text":"I will say, Toronto is pretty lacking in QUALITY vegan restaurants. Maybe it's because I'm from Philadelphia and travel to NYC a lot, but the vegan restaurants in Toronto are pretty lacking when it comes to flavor and quality of ingredients. Philadelphia and NYC have many really amazing vegan restaurants from fast food to fine dining. To get to the point, I think Hogtown might be the only restaurant in Toronto that compares to the quality and flavor of these other cities.  I got the bacon burger, while my partner got one of the unchicken entrees. I will say that the unchicken was one of the best chicken substitutes I've had. As for the sides, the collard greens probably should have been cooked a little more because they were a little sour, but the mac and cheese was good. My burger was good too, but I think I enjoyed the combo platter a little better.   I've been to some pretty amazing vegan sold food places in DC and Baltimore, which I think are a little better, but Hogtown definitely compares. I like that Hogtown is better for a date then the other vegan soul food restaurants in other cities.   I'd go here again! It was one of my favorite vegan restaurants in Toronto (I'm just a little spoiled with my choices in other cities!)."}
{"text":"Came here with fairly low expectations, due to my own personal inexperience with vegan food. Glad to say that this went above and beyond my expectations.   I had ordered the southern combo, which came with a serving of their mac and \"cheese\", a couple piece of unchicken, and collard greens. The unchicken was flavored okay, but the bbq dipping sauce they give you on the side definitely helps. The mac and \"cheese\" was actually pretty good! Collard greens were probably the worst part of this meal, due to no flavor. A little bit of salt would've gone a long way.   My friend ordered the unchicken and waffles with sweet potato mash and collard greens. The unchicken were the same as what was on my plate and the waffle was really dense (great flavor though). The sweet potato mash was the real winner for this plate. My friend ended up getting full too quickly due to how dense the waffles were.  Additionally, we also ordered the chili \"cheese\" fries. The cheese appears to be the same cheese as was used in the mac and cheese, which ended up going well with the black bean spread and guacamole. No real complaints here.  Service was a bit slow and waited a bit longer than we had hoped to get our orders in and food brought to us. That said, there was only one waiter at the time that seemed to be in charge of the bar as well.  Great place to try more approachable vegan food, if you haven't done so already. The food is definitely filling and will likely be a great experience whether or not you are vegan."}
{"text":"Drove from Waterloo.  Had dinner.  It was amazing!   It was hot that day so it was really warm inside(I dont think they have AC) I had the Philly and my GF had the southern.  She is a meat eater, I am not.  I was blown  away with my meal and the big check mark for Hogtown was Her approval.  I haven't eaten meat for over 20 years and can't remember what it tastes like.  She eats it regularly and said \"if you don't tell someone, they would never know\". That's a feat.  I wish they had a location in or near Waterloo.   I would be a regular hands down.    I would give 5* but the lack of AC on a hot day is a negative.  I want to know how they make their cheese sauce.  I hate vegan cheese which is why I am not full vegan! (Tastes like butter) but theirs is INCREDIBLE!!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite vegan places in Toronto! If you get the un-chicken and waffles definitely ask for extra syrup though."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my meal at this restaurant.   Believe the hype about the unchicken... I went with two non-vegans and they were impressed with the fake out.  We started with the nachos... Really tasty. That nacho cheese sauce was sooooo delicious. Probably the best vegan nacho cheese sauce I've had.   Two of us had the unchicken burger with an upgraded side of poutine for our main. The sandwich was great! Really impressed with the \"meat\". The bun they serve it on is really nice as well. I wasn't impressed with the poutine -- it was just okay. Fresh restaurant has much better vegan gravy.   The other person at our table had the southern dinner with unchicken strips, collard greens and mac n cheese. I tasted a bit of everything on their plate and thought it was pretty good, but not four stars like my plate. Heads up -- the collard greens are super garlicky.   Bottom line... if I had gotten a side of chilli cheese fries or fries supreme with my unchicken burger (something with that amazing nacho cheese on top!) I  would've given this place 5 stars. The server was nice as well and it's reasonably priced. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit; I heard nothing but good things about Hogtown from my vegan friends. I'll keep it short and to the point.   I ordered the PHISH N' CHIPS. The tempeh \"fish\" had no flavour to it, the crust was drenched in oil, and when the crust easily fell off the tempeh, well who wants to eat oil covered tempeh? Luckily the fries were done correctly, but it was the only thing that I finished on the plate.   I then ordered the Cookie Ice Cream Sandwich for dessert. The cookie itself was tasty. However both cookies were so big that the coconut ice cream was lost in it.  I couldn't taste it because the size of the cookies overpowered it. This could definitely use a makeover. Don't make the cookies so big, provide a decent amount of ice cream (that's why it's called ICECREAM sandwich) and maybe be creative and roll the sandwich in some Oreo crumble or peanuts. For $7 bucks,  I could've gotten a better composed dish.   On top of it all, or waitress was rude, took forever to serve us and then disappeared, leaving my partner and I having to hunt down a new waiter just to pay the bill.   Not impressed and won't be returning unless staff and their chef take a serious look at their menu and customer service!"}
{"text":"This is, without exaggeration, the best food I've had since coming to Toronto. Maybe it's because I'm a sucker for fake chicken or maybe it's just really that good, but I'm definitely returning.  I went here with my meat-loving boyfriend, whose food I sampled for the purposes of this review. We shared an appetizer of vegan buffalo wings. For me, this was the highlight of the meal. I looooved buffalo wings when I ate meat, and I had high expectations for these. I am pleased to say they were crunchy and the sauce was great.  I got the unchicken + waffles, and my boyfriend got the \"bacon cheeseburger\" with fries supremacy. Mine was great, and the sides of collared greens and sweet potato mash complemented it sooo nicely. I tried some of my boyfriend's meal too! The burger was nice, and the fries were awesome. Even my boyfriend, who is nearly a carnivore, really enjoyed it.  Overall, I definitely recommend eating here, especially if you're a vegetarian! Even if you're not, I still recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"Not the healthiest spot, but boy is it yummy. Had the pulled \"pork\" sandwich with the chilli \"cheese\" fries. Absolutely amazing. Very good food and good service. I liked the water bottles at the tables (so we never ran dry...)"}
{"text":"I'm not vegan, but thought the food was pretty decent and creative as it would mimic real meat products with their 'poutine' and 'bacon cheeseburger'.  It is bar food for vegans :).  I would come back here again and recommend the place for those who choose to be vegan."}
{"text":"2 of us walked in off the street for dinner, and were told to wait for a table even though there was one free. We waited for 10 minutes and walked out. I can only assume they were saving the table until a group of 4 came along. Won't be going back here!"}
{"text":"Great options for a vegan meal that is similar to regular fast food. The first time I went, I just got home fries cause well I didn't want to try anything else at the time and waste money if I didn't like it. But also I needed something quick as I was in a rush and didn't want to pay more for parking. The fries were good but not spectacular.   Second visit, I sat down. I was disappointed that it seemed like I HAD to sit in a 2 person seat as I usually opt for bigger tables. But now being in the service industry, I know it was because during peak hours they need to keep the big tables for bigger parties. Plus there weren't too many tables to begin with.   I really like the chalkboard with specials on it, though it didn't help that it was tucked away and behind you as you stood at the counter. But also I ended up sitting right next to it and didn't realize it until I saw other customers looking at it. Luckily, I didn't want anything on there but it would have been nice to know about. I also like that they have games in the back but found it weird that they had t-shirt merchandise.   Second visit, I ordered the wings with a basket of fries. Their mayo sauce is amazing and I don't even like mayo. I liked it mixed with ketchup. It had a bit of spice to it. The buffalo wings were superb. It was my first time trying faux meat from anywhere except for a seitan shish kabob and of course veggie burgers at other places. Super happy with the flavour and texture. If you're worried about a bland soy taste like I was, you're ensured it tastes mostly like the sauce and it did. Mmm yummy. Also good to note that the wings looked like chicken nuggets and cauliflower buffalo bites not actual wings. Which I like as it would have been really weird seeing and eating an exact replica."}
{"text":"It was our first time here. We waited 20 minutes just to order. When we finally did order, the food did come fast, but the fries were so bad. Visibly so greasy, and the flavour was 100% grease. I couldn't even eat them, they tasted too bad and would definitely hurt my stomach. We also ordered quesadillas and those were actually good. The flavour was great. Overall, the people working there were nice, the decor wasn't nice in my opinion, there's long waiting times for certain things, and the food is very hit and miss. I don't really understand why there's so many good reviews. I would maybe consider getting the quesadillas again, but honestly I'd rather just make them at home. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Still love this place. Seems like things are running pretty smooth now, food and service are always consistently great, new location feels more spacious and no more dungeon washrooms!   Food is still heavy comfort food, so adjust your expectations. I think the lightest thing is the Greek salad. Other than that, you're looking at pretty bold flavours and lots of deliciousness. If you're looking for diet food, go somewhere else.   Big fan!"}
{"text":"I've been half a dozen times, and I LOVE this place. I'm a vegetarian, and I can not get enough of this food. I've walked in some very cold winter nights to get their food because they don't deliver. Always worth it.  Try it - you won't regret it! The \"chicken wings\" are amazing, so is their southern combo. Cash only, though."}
{"text":"A nice place with a pretty interesting menu. Although the tortilla salad was very good, I expected it to be more refreshing on a hot day but the hot sauce in the \"dressing\" made it more of a bowl of nachos with lettuce. The fried shiitake mushrooms were delicious!"}
{"text":"I had very very high hopes for this place. No air conditioning. They forgot the cheese on my CHEESEsteak and the seitan was not edible. They seemed under a lot of stress but no one in my table enjoyed themselves. The nachos and wings were very good tho but that's about it."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to try this place for awhile!  I went on a Monday with a friend, and wow does this place ever get busy! I'm not sure if they were understaffed, but one of the servers said we'd be seated in \"just a minute\" and then we proceeded to wait for a good 25 minutes (yes we could've walked out but I wanted to know what all the buzz around this restaurant was!).  If they would've been upfront with the wait time, we could've walked around somewhere and came back. Not to mention the absence of A/C.   Anyway, after waiting in the hot restaurant, I was dying for a glass of cold water. Unfortunately when the server brought it over it was very warm.   I decided to order the Southern Combo, which comes with \"chicken\" fingers, vegan mac and cheese and garlic sauteed collard greens. Nothing over the top, but It was a good vegan option for comfort food and I liked that they still included some veggies.   Overall, if you want to try vegan with a unique twist, this is a good option for casual food, but don't expect outstanding service."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch at 11:30am--still haven't eaten again today and it's 6:15pm.  I ordered the PB and banana stuffed french toast...without realizing that that shit is DEEP FRIED. Needless to say, my stomach is a little apprehensive as I tried to cram as much of it into my face as possible, and still only managed to succeed with half. My friend got the Rancheros which was delicious, and significantly \"lighter.\" You've gotta get the home fries, as those are ridiculous...salty, spicy, crunchy.   This is definitely a once in a blue moon kind of place for me, as I appreciate being able to get out of my house without having the door frame removed first."}
{"text":"Take your average hot-blooded, MMA watching, bacon ravening meat-a-tarian ( in this case my husband) and they'll be mighty impressed by the exceptional food here. You see The Hogtown Vegan have taken staple carnivore faves like wings, burgers, sausage and steak and turned it on it's head in unconventional vegan style. So it's all the flavour and none of the guilt (and heartburn) associated with eating cuteness like this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KrW6AKWMT0   Upon being seated on arrival we peruse the expansive vegan menu and I'm really torn as there are so many mouth-water rendering options. I also appreciate that Hogtown's menu notes items that are gluten or nut free which makes ordering fuss free.   For starters we order the deliciously crisp and spicy/tangy tofu wings/triangles. I marvel at how rich and creamy the dairy free sour cream is, simply divine! The best part is that you can eat these wings with a fork. Hubby decides to order The Big Hog burger which is a hearty soy patty with melted Daiya cheese, lettuce pickles and Hogtown's own house mayo.  Hubby is savouring his burger with delight as I steal a couple of the temptingly crisp fresh cut fries off his plate.  For my main I have the cornbreaded sausage, which are two tofu sausage patties that are corn batter fried. Damn! This was a sausage party in my mouth, not to mention it's mad savory accompaniments of onion relish, molasses sweet potato mash and collared greens! MMMmmm All this Southern fried goodness is enough to make me want to break out and do the \"Dougie\" but being that the music playing here was less Dirty South hip-hop and more Stevie Nicks and the undulating strains of Nico and the Velvet Underground (which is fine by me!) I decide not to make a yokel of myself.  Service was friendly and very prompt given that it was a busy Saturday night bustling with a full house and a line-up 10 deep waiting to be seated!  The clientele is a casual mix of locals and hipster-ish young-un's and the decor is your usual diner vibe with walls painted an intensely hued Kelly green, but who gives a @#$% about furnishings when the food is THIS GOOD!  Oh and another thing, dinner consisting of an appy, two entrees and a Flying Monkey Hoptical Illusion beer for hubby came to about $45 in total!!  Folks, it don't get any better than this place!  In closing, The Hogtown Vegan serves up excellent comfort food in vegan style. If you haven't already had the pleasure of dining at the Hogtown, get your hungry ass over here already!  You won't be dissappointed!"}
{"text":"Took a friend here for a belated birthday dinner.  My friend has been vegan for over 15 years and hasn't tasted chicken since she was 11.  And usually when we go out to eat, she's limited to the salad section of the menu.  For the first time in a long while, she was finally able to order anything from the menu - how exciting!  I ordered the Unchicken and Waffles ($13) and she went with the Southern Combo ($13).  Our meals came out hot and fresh from the deep fryer.  As a carnivore, I was fully impressed by my \"unchicken\".  Waffles were also well done.  I sampled the Mac and Cheese that came with the Southern Combo.  It also came with a side of house made BBQ sauce that I used for my unchicken.  Even though we were pretty stuffed from our entrees, it didn't stop us from ordering dessert - Chocolate Mousse Parfait ($7).  Wow...possibly one of the BEST restaurant desserts I've had in a long while.  It was smooth, chocolate-y, creamy and they didn't skimp on the peanuts.  Service was meh...waitress was kind of short with us and not very welcoming.  Doesn't really matter though because the food made up for the mediocre service.  Glad I wore my fat pants to dinner because I had to waddle out of there.  And we thought vegan food was suppose to be healthy.  Will be back to try the brunch!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing.  Went here because of the reviews but were very disappointed.  Both of us had the shitake clams tempura and the collard greens.  The tempura was not crisp and hot.  I even had some raw batter on my shitake.  The collards were too undercooked, not salted and tasteless.  Both of these could have been wonderful but were rubbish.  Won't be going back.  I used to be vegan for six years and cooked much better food without seitan, soy, tofu, tempeh etc.  Not sure why these restaurants cannot make better food.  Service was fine."}
{"text":"I can't believe this food is vegan. Their mayo is delicious, great comfort food! Always extremely filling!!!! The service is always polite and fast. I love this place!! The only down side is that the seats aren't very roomy, but other then that amazing!  Defiantly recommend this place. I'll keep going back for more!"}
{"text":"Some of the best vegan comfort food eats in the city."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try this place for a long time because I have heard great things about their vegan style comfort food. My friend and I met up after work excited to try out the menu. I got there first and was immediately greeted when I walked in the door. \"I said hi may I have a table for two preferably in a booth,\" she replied \"sorry we only sit parties of three to a booth\". Unbothered I sat down and looked across from me and saw a couple sitting in a booth surrounded by empty booths. So I asked \"how come they get to sit in a booth?\" She said \"we were probably just really busy\"  I honestly just left it at that because I was extremely excited to eat and I didn't want to ruin my happy vibe. While I waited for my friend I swatted a few fruit flies and attempted to move muself to another table but that table had more fruit flies so I moved back. Finally my friend arrived and we decided to order everything we could fit in our mouths.   We ordered the southern combo (fried Chicken , mac and cheese, collard greens and bbq sauce), chicken and waffles, pulled pork sanwhich and fries supreme to share. The fries supreme was delicious! Comparable and even better than most fries supreme I've had. W both felt  they used too much cumin (we were trying to figure out the flavour) in the beans but aside from that we devoured it. The pulled pork sanwhich topped with coleslaw between a sesame bun was the perfect texture.  I would have really enjoyed it if I like their bbq sauce. But I found it too sweet and tangy. The mac and cheese was ok. It wasn't bad but I've had better vegan mac. The collard greens were flavourless and undercooked. I found the fried chicken bland and didn't enjoy whatever seasoning they used, and the waffle wasn't good either. Overall there where some hit and misses but it wasn't good enough for me to come back.   *note I am not judging the food with the hopes of it tasting similar to meat or being a perfect meat substitute.  I grew up eating a lot of homecooked vegetarian meals. So flavour wise it just wasn't enough for me."}
{"text":"Excellent vegan comfort food.  A bit noisy, but great food done right.  Southern combo is a winner and looked like many happy patrons."}
{"text":"This was the first time I have ever eaten at a vegan restaurant. I wasn't sure what to think, but I was very happy with the whole experience. Our waitress was very courteous and our food came out right away. We started with nachos and wow were they good! Some of the best guacamole I've ever had, the beans were great and the chips were fresh. I had the \"bacon cheeseburger\" and I was very happy with it. The patty was very flavourful, though I wasn't a huge fan of the tofu bacon. My fiancé had the unchicken and waffles, and wow the chicken was very tasty. I'd easily recommend this place to anybody, and I'll come back here next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Came here again last week (probably haven't eaten here in 6 months or so) and was pleasantly delighted with the new menu.   As a vegetarian who hasn't eaten meat in 10+ years, and who still (sometimes, I can admit it) misses chicken fingers and honey mustard sauce (gross... I know) Hogtown Vegan hits the spot.   With their new \"unchicken\" burger, I honestly felt like I was a ten year old again, eating a breaded and fried chicken burger at the ball park, and I couldn't have been happier. As usual, I gorged myself, and added poutine as a side for my burger.   While I think the veggie poutine at Disgraceland and Clinton's are both better, the all around meal at Hogtown is really top-notch.   Love this resto very very much and wish it nothing but success in the future."}
{"text":"I'm an omnivore that loves good meat - and Southern BBQ definitely fits near the top of the meat category!   Hogtown Vegan exceeded my expectations of a vegetarian BBQ spot, as they've nailed serving full-flavour comfort food without animals & dairy. Bravo! Excellent range of tastes & textures, with surprisingly big savoury flavours. Comforting indeed. Not healthy (but that goes for every Southern BBQ restaurant!)... but comforting.   And btw the vegetarian bacon bits and sour cream on the \"fries supremacy\" is crazy good.    Genuine and great service, too.   A+++++++++ Will return!"}
{"text":"Hearing about this place for a while from many friends I decided to try it about a year ago now, but have been back many times since. I love that it's comfort food, and my absolute favourite thing to order is the unchicken and waffles !  Everything I've had is delicious and personally I always love going to places where I have more than one option to eat. My boyfriend who isn't vegan/vegetarian also enjoys this place a lot."}
{"text":"It's good vegan junk/comfort food. I did accidentally blurt out 'this looks like a microwave TV dinner' when I saw the un-chicken and waffles. The very thin, cinnamoney, waffles could have come out of a somewhat pricey freezer box.   The alcoholic drinks were fantastic. We got a Moscow mule and a Dark and Stormy. What can I say? We love ginger beer.   The pulled pork sandwich was pretty good and the mac and cheese was extremely tasty (just close your eyes if you don't want to be reminded that the excess oil you see is probably a whole lotta melted margarine)."}
{"text":"This is a small place in the Dufferin and Steeles area. Parties larger than 4 will have a hard time finding space. This is my first vegan restaurant experience; so I wasn't completely sure of what to expect.  Considering its all vegan, something I'm not quite used to, I found the food to be rather tasty, but a bit on the salty side. Their hamburger \"patties\" were a bit dry, but tasted good. The coleslaw side was great. One of my friends got the \"un-chicken\" waffle, but the waffle was quite hard. Very cookie-like. But for the price, I was full. The food was a 3.5/5. It wasn't terrible by any means, but one could argue that it is an acquired taste.  Service was a bit slow. But most marks were deducted for the environment. The place is small, and for a group of people, one person was on a folding chair in the aisle. It was also dark, which made the place look gloomy.  It was a OK experience overall. But I probably won't be returning."}
{"text":"I've come to this restaurant multiple times now and I'm still very impressed by the food! My favourite meal to order would have to be the unchicken paired with the mac and cheese. The unchicken is crispy and delicious and the mac and cheese is the perfect creamy consistency. I've brought my non-vegan friends here and they've all been surprised at how they can't tell the difference between the unchicken and actual chicken.  The service has always been great for me but perhaps that's because I don't come during peak hours. The servers I've had, have always been very attentive and quick."}
{"text":"Best vegan place in Toronto. The restaurant is really nice and the food is delicious! Only down side: it is busy and you will need to wait"}
{"text":"Comfort food in a cosy atmosphere, I love the vibe here the staff were friendly and enthusiastic about the food. They do vegan fried chicken like no others, it's unbeatable! Their classic unchicken and waffles is a must try, the waffles are fluffier than you'd expect and the chicken is so tasty and the texture is perfect.  I tried the mac and cheese the other night but it didn't quite meet my expectations. It was more runny than I'd hope for and there was a bit of a sour aftertaste? But I might just be a harsh critic on mac and cheese. Everything else was amazing, even the collard greens. The prices are fair and 100% worth it for that 'unchicken' I can't stop raving about!"}
{"text":"Interesting.   I had to try the popular \"Unchicken and Waffles\" dish, which came with three \"fingers\" of chicken on half a huge waffle, sweet potato mash and collard greens. First of all, the sweet potato mash was way too sweet, and I couldn't eat more than 3 bites without feeling ill. The collard greens, on the other hand, were virtually tasteless. Next time I would probably swap out the sides for something else, but at a cost of $2 I don't know if it's worth it. (I never understand why it seems like vegan/vegetarian restaurants are so much more unforgiving of modifications...don't they know we have a hard enough time as it is trying to find something we like to eat in \"real\" restaurants?!?) The chicken, however, was crispy and flavourful, and the waffle was sweet fluffy and complemented the chicken nicely.   I also tried the vegan chili \"cheese\" fries, which were surprisingly tasty. I had actually never had chili cheese fries before, vegan or otherwise, and I would definitely go back to eat these again.   There's not much to say about the atmosphere inside, with the whole interior being dark with a few colourful accents here and there. I was actually a bit surprised, as I thought that it would be a little nicer.   My opinion of the Hogtown Vegan remains a bit mixed. It's likely not a restaurant that I'll frequent regularly, but for those rare moments when nothing but fake meat will do, I'm glad it's there."}
{"text":"We ordered the buffalo \"wings\" (DEFINITELY get these) the guac and chips (chips were great, guac was normal) and we both ordered the unchicken and waffles for our main. I loved all of the food with the exception of the sweet potato mash, I didn't love the runny texture, but I'm also picky about that kind of thing. A total bonus was the tea with bourbon cocktail - just strong enough to give you a little buzz! I definitely recommend bringing your vegan and non vegan friends here for a fun, affordable night out."}
{"text":"I'm a carnivore, I went here with my vegetarian sister. After reading so many good reviews I was excited, but was kinda disappointed. First off the actual location looks like a dive,  from the website I assumed it would be a classy type place but it's very bohemian and hipster. I ordered the southern combo which comes with unchicken, BBQ sauce, collard greens and mac and cheese. The unchicken was actually quite good, the collard greens were good too, nothing spectacular but decent , the mac and cheese though was nasty. Didn't taste \"cheesy\" at all and had an odd vinegary flavour to it. My sister loved her unchicken and waffles. If I went again I'd get the unchicken and waffles and would not go out of my way to go again."}
{"text":"First time trying Hogtown. I order a unchicken burger and supramacy fries. It was very tasty and i would like to keep Hogtown on my vegan list of choices. The service was good and the kids liked it too. I would recommend new comers!"}
{"text":"Great veg food!   Beeeefff and I strolled in on the first springy Saturday this year for some very late afternoon brunch.  I got the tortilla salad and he ordered the unchicken and waffles.  The service was chill and friendly and perfectly suited to the ambience, which is fairly indie-Spartan (yeah, that's a thing now) but the atmospheric edges are polished with bright teal paint and good music.   The unchicken and waffles is really, really good--the crust on the veg.chicken is delicious and I think most carnivores would scarf it down happily.  The tortilla salad was quite tasty too--lots of avocado and black beans.    I'm eager to check out their dinner menu and would definitely return for brunch."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegetarian or vegan but it didn't even matter. The food here is exceptional and I would definitely come back. I ordered the taco salad and not only was it huge it was also incredibly flavourful and delicious."}
{"text":"Delish! I went with the vegan fish and chips and was psyched be cause its SOOOO hard to get good vegan fried fish. Hogtown uses tempeh for the fish do I was skeptical that it would be hard and earthy but it was outstanding. They did a great job with the seasoning and the batter reminds me of Friday night fish fries I attended growing up. The mandatory tartar sauce was also good. Instead of fries, I upgraded to a Caesar salad, which was gigantic but I felt the dressing was a little bland. I also had the bbq wings as an app and they were great."}
{"text":"Wow. Channel up your inner fat kid and get yourself to The Hogtown Vegan next time you're in serious need of hearty food. I'm one of those rare people whose idea of comfort food is not mac & cheese or fries loaded with greasy and wet stuff. I equate comfort with good health (yah, I'm a nerd), so I'm more inclined to eat big warm bowls full of hearty grains and plant proteins when I need \"comfort food.\" That said, I've been known to smash in a plate of deep fried hot cauliflower \"wings\" in minutes and don't even get me started or I'll pen my ode to the perfect French fries right now. I can do junk food with the best of 'em. This isn't junk food though, I promise you.  The hot wings at Hogtown vegan are of the fake chicken variety. The batter and sauce is on point (actually so good that my mouth waters at the memory), but I do prefer cauliflower to something that seems very close to chicken. I think most people would love these, so do order them (and they have BBQ if you can't take the heat). Oh and that dipping sauce puts any ranch dressing to shame (I love shaming ranch dressing because I hate it).  I also ordered the seitan roast beef sandwich. The seitan is thinly sliced, which is amazing! I never had it that way before so that was a nice surprise. But I think I was so beguiled by the photos posted of this sandwich that I ignored my better judgement. I don't like sandwiches loaded with gravy so WTH was I thinking? Maybe I should have told them gravy on the side? I couldn't pick the enormous thing up and eat it, so I just picked out the seitan and left the huge roll alone. This is one serious sandwich and amateurs shouldn't attempt it.   The truth is, I'm still mad at myself for not ordering a large Caesar salad because the salad that accompanied the sandwich (it's a little extra money) is fucking incredible. Like in the league of the best vegan Caesars I've ever had. It's super savory and salty and all the good things: crunchy romaine, tiny bacon bits and parm crumbles, just the right amount of dressing. I ate every last bit of it and it's a considerable portion. In fact so good, I picked up the basket the sandwich was in on the plate to hunt for more underneath. I'm devoted to that Caesar salad.   And for dessert, I couldn't resist the coconut ice cream cookie sandwich. If a photo is worth a thousand words, I hope that there's a thousand synonyms for \"delicious.\" The ice cream isn't just a coconut base but has pieces of chewy coconut. The cookies are perfectly chewy/crunchy cinnamon chocolate chip. I am smitten with this thing. Completely smitten.  What a gorge fest. But next time I'm having the salad... heh."}
{"text":"I don't often write reviews for out-of-town places, but The Hogtown Vegan has left me no choice.  This is easily one of the best meals I've ever had. No doubt.   I was promptly seated (alone), but quickly made friends with the couple at the table next to me. I must say: Toronto is one friendly city. I asked for recommendations (once I'd found out they were regulars to this spot) and was directed immediately to try the un-chicken and waffles - which my neighbor was licking his plate clean of as he made the suggestion. Of course, I didn't have to be sold too hard. From the looks of it, I would not be disappointed.   I also opted for a side of the mac and cheese, under the agreement that my new friends would share some, seeing as this would be way too much food for just one person (I also had a beer; they've got a great selection of local brews from Flying Monkey).  The mac & cheese was out of this world. Even better than my grandmom's (sorry!). Vegan or not, the stuff was amazing. So creamy with just a hint of spice. It was hard not to spoil my meal filling up on it...  Glad I didn't though, because my entree...good lord...how can I describe it? Life-changing? Understatement.   I didn't know you could make soy protein taste that good. The \"chicken\" was fried to a golden perfection, perfectly seasoned, and amazingly moist. And the sides. Ohhh, the sides. A fresh waffle, sweet potato mash, and collard greens. Everything drenched in sweet maple syrup...make it stop, the memories hurt too much! I can still taste this meal a week later.  I would hop a plane for the night just to enjoy this a second time. If you haven't eaten at The Hogtown Vegan, and you live within a 10 hour radius, you should be ashamed."}
{"text":"Was really tasty! The water they offered was room temp... would have been nice to have some ice water.  But friendly, timely service! And generous portions. I'd go again"}
{"text":"Came once for lunch, brought my husband for dinner tonight.   The Quesadilla appetizer..OMG. We used to eat meat and dairy and the HV's quesadilla is BETTER than a traditional cheese and meat one.   Fries, okay.    Sandwiches are great, slaw is great, a lot of oil at the bottom of the bowl though.   Overall the food is wonderful, a little pricey, one of the best vegan restaurants.   VERY nice staff.   We'll be back."}
{"text":"Had the bacon burger and the buffalo chicken sandwich. Really good! Good quality ingredients and great flavor"}
{"text":"Had the Mac and cheese with chicken wings. Saloon decor. Great food, will drop by when in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I have been having a very specific craving for a club sandwich lately. It's something that is not the easiest to find in vegetarian land. Veggie burgers, sure. Fried \"chicken\" sandwiches and even veggie \"pulled pork\" are things I come across a fair amount. But for some reason a decent club sandwich substitute has been escaping me lately. So imagine my surprise and delight when I wandered into Hogtown Vegan for a quick lunch and found exactly this staring back at me on the lunch specials menu.   My friend and I ordered quickly and our food arrived at near lightning speed. I'm talking under 10 minutes people. The sandwich was delicious, if a little too big for my stomach at the time. I've currently got half of it sitting in my fridge waiting to be devoured once I get my appetite back at dinner. Pretty good deal really - for $13 I'm basically getting two meals. The fries on the side were a little undercooked for my liking. I like 'em crispy, so next time I might just specify this desire upon ordering."}
{"text":"This is my second time here, and because I absolutely loved the food I would come back again, but I would never come back for their brunch menu. I came here on Saturday, and I'm not sure if it was because of pride, the Banksy exhibit nearby, or a little bit of both, but I have never had worse service anywhere else. When we first got there at around 1:30, I knew it was going to be awhile to sit down which I was fine with, and I made sure the person I brought knew there would be a wait to sit down, but I definitely was not prepared for the wait it would take to actually get our food. First of all, when we were sat down, we were with another couple who was seated next to us and we were never given any menus to look at as we were seated. Finally, after 10 minutes of no one coming around to give us a menu, one of the people at the table beside us actually got up to go to the front and got all four of us a menu (to which my dad made a joke about having to tip him... very dad-like). After they came around probably 5 minutes after that we ordered, and the wait to get the food was around 45-55 minutes. We weren't starving when we first arrived, but by the time we got our food almost an hour and a half after we sat down, we were definitely hungry. I think I was most frustrated at the fact that when we finally did get our order, no one mentioned anything about the wait or even apologized. So while I might come back here when I know for sure it's going to be quiet, I was really disappointed by the lack of service here. (As a side note - there's no picture because I was so hungry when we finally got our food that I ate it right away! But I will say that the food was really good - if the service was good I would definitely consider this a 5 star restaurant)"}
{"text":"This place is adorable and the food is great. I had lunch here alone on a weekday, and I found the restaurant was easy to get into, the food was fast, and nobody minded when I stuck around to finish my beer and read my book.  I opted for the seitan rueben with a side of vegan poutine. The rueben was amazing with the seitan perfectly spiced and sliced thin, delicious sauerkraut, hearty bread, and the pleasant surprise of a pile of sprouts, which added texture and crunch. The poutine was good - the beer/mushroom gravy was very good and the fries were crispy. I would say that the topping of daiya was a little disappointing - I've had some vegan poutine that used Chunks of pressed and marinated tofu that were more effective, as the cheese curds and regular poutine is not meant to be melty, but rather a texture and salty flavor.  That said, great food and service! I highly recommend."}
{"text":"if you want vegan comfort food then this is the place to be.   they make you want to be vegan with the dishes they serve like the unchicken and waffles, and southern meal with collard greens.   they also have good dessert and other comfort food dishes. a must go even if ur not a vegan."}
{"text":"Let me pre-face this post with being an omnivore who considers herself a bit of a foodie (or at least a really hungry food lover. ) I am unpretentious about my food, but I believe there is a \"RIGHT\" way to do things. I don't believe in wasting calories on bad food so if you're going to eat, it better be worth it. No horrible after-tastes, no off-textures, just pure sensual food. I'll eat just about anything as long as it's good. I'll even get over my general dislike of gassy beans if used in the right context.   So here comes Sunday Brunch, huevos rancheros. I was expecting like a marinated tofu slab slapped onto of beans doused with salsa to drown your vegan sorrows, but boy was I wrong! The \"eggs\" were these yellow tofu-based circles; although a bit Mcdonald's-y looking, they tasted great! The beans were the perfect texture and perfectly seasoned- no nasty, drippy bean water or mushy bean goo. The crispy tortilla which I expected to simply be a store-bought disc was freshly deep-fried which meant it was delightfully crispy and tasty and had slight folds to cup in some of the beans. But the best part of the dish was the sour cream! It was even tastier than real sour cream! It was zesty and creamy and made no hints that it was a \"vegan\" product and exceeded the quality of Tofutti Sour Cream, which is a pretty decent sour cream product albeit the aftertaste. There was nothing to dislike about this dish, and the homefries were perfectly fried as well.   Most of the time I make a mental note of whether I like the \"Real\" version more than the vegan version, not this though! It was amazing in its own right.   Now, the reason why I knocked off a star was because they had a vegan caesar which just so happened to be an overly-salty Bloody Mary. It became unbearable after a few sips and I instantly regretted ordering it."}
{"text":"So bad. Unhealthy and bland. Both our meals were artificial tasting and greasy. Vegan food definitely doesn't mean healthy, quite the opposite!"}
{"text":"I had higher hopes for Hogtown, so I was a bit disappointed with what I got.  The food is pretty tastey and does not purport to be healthy, but portions are small, service is slow, and the pricetag is pretty high for what you get.  Good for a snack or a light, unhealthy meal, but certainly not an everyday kind of place."}
{"text":"Here's a tip if you can't finish all of your delish food: ask for a container and put the food in yourself.   I had a great dinner last night but asked for the leftovers to be wrapped up - just opened up the box to find hardly any of it there.  sad note: none of the gravy even made it home, even after specifically asking my waitress.  This place is going to have some serious competition from Doomies when they open in a few days.  They really need to step up their service a notch.  Btw, hogtown - I would have loved to email you about this than posting to social media but I couldn't find an email address for you anywhere."}
{"text":"yum yum yum yum YUM! I'm visiting Toronto and trying to hit up as many vegan places as possible. We went here on a rainy Sunday afternoon for brunch and it was wonderful!  My friend and I both got the BLT and her boyfriend got the unchicken and waffles. Both dishes were huge portions. While the \"bacon\" in the BLT didn't taste as good as tempeh bacon (to me), it was still so satisfying and filling. The home fries were the perfect blend of crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and balanced seasoning. The unchicken on the waffles was probably what impressed me the most. Best mock chicken I've ever had and the breading was to die for!!  Overall, super happy AND full. Thanks Hogtown! :)"}
{"text":"I am NOT a vegetarian and had little knowledge or interest in a vegetarian lifestyle until about a year ago when I started dating a vegetarian, and living with 2 others. (I'm surrounded lol)   We all went here this evening and I have to say it was pretty awesome!   My boyfriend isn't a salad guy, and it seems like most vegetarian places are geared towards organic, leafy, healthy, blah blah blah.  We like to eat food that is very yummy and very fatty!  The Hogtown Vegan delivered big portions of good ol' comfort food -- they had many of the items my boyfriend \"misses\" every now and then, from growing up eating meat.    The chilli cheese fries were huge and loaded up properly!  My boyfriend had the pulled \"pork\" sandwich, which was saucy and big, and the poutine.  He liked it very much.  I definitely am not a fan of tofu, but I will be more open to it after having the Hogtown \"Wings\"  -- SOOOOOOO GOOD!  I could eat a million.  And the dip that came with them was creamy and smokey, very good.  Shitake \"oysters\" were good too.  I had the burger, which seemed like the safest bet for a meat-eater, and it was awesome.  Very good veggie burger, coleslaw, vegan mayo, I didn't miss the real thing at all!    The service was slow and the food took an extremely long time.  But, having only gone there once I'm willing to chalk it up to a very busy night and, well, everyone has an off day.  Will still definitely be back.  If you want \"regular\" pub grub vegetarian style, the Hogtown is the top place to go to get it, in my opinion.  We will definitely be going back!  I already know what I'm going to order next -- the Fish n' Chips!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE hogtown. The food and service are great   Minus one star for the current location though - the actual location is great, but the dining space is WAY TOO SMALL. They regularly hit full capacity during dinner which means a significant wait to be seated ( sometimes over an hour for 4 or more people)"}
{"text":"Ok I hate giving vegan restaurants crap reviews but I really have no choice. I've been to The Hogtown Vegan on college street and I had an amazing experience. However, the Bloor location was completely different. S group of three of us went out to dinner at about 8pm on Sunday of the long weekend. When we got to the restaurant there was about 3 other occupied tables. We sat at the back in a booth. The three of us shared the shittake mushroom clams (m and I have had these at the other location and they were delightful). The \"clams\" I found were really greasy and didn't have any flavour. I don't know if the mushrooms were not very good or the batter wasn't very good but I would not get them again, nor would I advise anyone to get them at this location.M had a pulled pork sandwich which was so messy. I had the bacon cheeseburger and everything was like falling out. And the bread? That was harder than a rock. I ended up taking the bread off and just eating the burger with a knife and fork. If anyone wants to check out hogtown vegan, do yourself the favour and go to the other location. I can't believe how two exact restaurants gave us two completely different experiences. The saving grace here was honestly the severs who were friendly without being annoying and brought us water when they saw our empty water jug!  Would I come back here? Absolutely not..but I would definitely go to the college street location."}
{"text":"I will always support a vegan restaurant. What a wonderful fact that these places exist.  However I can't really go back.  Every meal is pretty much served with fries.  The daily special looked nice but there are absolutely NO substitutions so enjoy your fries because no way can you get something green.  When vegan eating is equivalent to french fries I am disappointed.  Also the salt.  OMG the salt.  Everything so incredibly salty it was inedible.  My daughter and I both ordered the tofu scramble. She had fries and apparently they were the only edible thing on her plate.  I had very salty collard greens.  Both of us left our scramble huge portions (and the portions were massive I must say) on our plates pretty much untouched.  The wait staff never questioned why.  The nachos are swimming in sauces and it is not at all clear from the menu what kinds of cheeses or non dairy products they are serving.  We are vegetarians moving ever closer to veganism and the unanimous request afterwards was please don't take us there again.  I see others have ordered the waffles and unchicken which we did not.  My husband had the reuben and he ate it completely but the salt was unbearable.  Even a recent promotion in the Toronto Life magazine mentions the salt.  Other reviewers at yelp mention the salt.  I wonder if they will get the message.  I won't be returning to find out.  Also the Cash only sign is NOT at the front door and not obviously on the menu.  It's only on the cash register.  That could become problematic for some.  I wish any vegan restaurant well but I do hope they can improve because there are much better vegan options in Hogtown."}
{"text":"Yummy vegan junk food. Looking for hearty comfort food on a cold night? You can't go wrong with Hogtown Vegan! Very busy on a Friday night. The chicken wing was awesome. The Reuben was too greasy and salty though. Portions were big. Not enough servers on this particular night and we did have to wait. Overall a good experience and I would want to go back to try the chicken waffle!"}
{"text":"The new kid on the block is getting steady attention, and I'm glad b/c it's not everyday that vegan eateries are given this much of a chance.  Went there tonight, ran into a couple of veg friends... which was nice. I choose the \"Biscuit Sliders\", tasty flat and small sausages with mashed potatoes, mushroom gravy and peas.  I chose collard greens as my side. I thought it was good.  Tasty, and filling.  The gluten-free small buns that it came with, were ok, but I didn't want to bother finish eating them.  Partner chose the reuben sandwich, which at first he enjoyed, but then as he started to fill up, he started to notice things like the bread being too greasy (with vegan marg).  He left quite a bit of the bread behind, too.  Yay: -some decent food selections; -prices overall were reasonable; -gluten free options; -all vegan; -I liked the collard greens side which had a subtle flavour; -friendly service; -food didn't take forever to arrive.  Nay: -not fab if you're not into fake meats (like if you were on a cleanse), or aren't into Daiya fake cheese; -lots of sandwich choices - which just isn't something that's appealing to me right now.  I'm into bread occasionally, but for me personally I would have enjoyed a few more healthful options.  The existing choices might be a good compromise for someone who's underinitiated into the world of vegan food - after all, it's tasty and its meal options are familiar foods to many.  If you live with health nut tendencies, vegan or not, take this place with a grain of Himalayan salt...  I'd go again.  Just not on a daily or even weekly basis."}
{"text":"I'm happy to say that after 2.5 years, and a change of ownership/management, my family and I have returned to Hogtown Vegan.  The new owners are much (much!) more considerate, thoughtful, and responsive than the previous owners. The new location is cleaner, bigger, and much more efficiently organized. The menu is stronger than it was a few years ago, and the kitchen is much more consistent. Service has been great, too.  We're glad to have Hogtown back in the rotation. If you had a bad experience in the past, we suggest that you give it another shot under the new management."}
{"text":"The Hogtown Vegan can be hit or miss depending on what you order. The pulled pork sandwich is amazing and packed full of flavour! It was the best vegan sandwich I've ever had! But the dishes that mimic battered and fried chicken and fish are painfully, painfully tasteless."}
{"text":"The unchicken and waffles is good but I do not recommend the mac and cheese, it's far too margerine-y and lacks flavor. It leaves you with a slippery feeling in your mouth that is really unpleasant. The servers are kind of rude at times and very inattentive. It takes forever to get your food and drinks and pay! I think they are under staffed always."}
{"text":"Vegan comfort food at it's best.  I ordered a Reuben w/ fries, and it was exactly what I needed.  This place is right up there with The Chicago Diner. There are so many great options on the menu - I'll have to come back as soon as possible.    The service was fast and friendly, and is there a better way to finish off a meal than a deep fried Oreo?  No - the correct answer is no."}
{"text":"This was absolutely disgusting. I got the unchicken and waffles and I threw up within an hour. I'll never come back. Service was fine but the food ruined it for me. I'm not one to leave anything on my plate but I could barely stomach this stuff."}
{"text":"I like to believe God himself created this place. Chill vibe, fast service, I've had an issue twice and it's usually rectified within minutes."}
{"text":"First of all I am not a vegan and nor do I ever intend on becoming one as I love my meat very dearly. However I do have a lot of vegetarian and vegan family members so I have total respect for their choices. I came here because I wanted to take my aunt out for lunch who is a vegan and visiting from out of town.  Decor wise this place is really laid back and minimalist. The walls are painted in a bright turquoise colour and are lined with pictures of old album covers. Our party of four were seated in the back of restaurant in a worn out looking grey booth.  As we all perused the menu I was surprised to see all the vegan takes on comfort food and southern offerings.   To drink I ordered the Homemade Lemonade - it was more on the sour side which I prefer in a lemonade however it had a bit of a watered down taste  As an appetizer the four of us shared the  Fries Supremacy - Basket of fresh-cut fries topped with nacho \"cheese\" sauce, fakin' bits, sunflower sour cream and scallions I have to say we are all quite blown away by these fries! They would rival as some of the best the city has to offer. Thin cut, golden brown not super crispy but far from being soggy nicely seasoned they were perfection especially when smothered in that gooey cheese sauce and tangy sour cream. As the portion size was hugee it was perfect for sharing!  For my main I couldn't help but try the Southern Combo - Breaded, fried soy \"chicken\" strips, our creamy mac and \"cheese\" and Sautéed garlic collard greens served with a side of house-made bbq sauce I have to say I was soo impressed by the texture of the chicken strips! They were quite spot on and hard to tell the difference (just a slight off taste when compared to real chicken) and the crispy lightly seasoned breading was also perfectly crunchy. You could easily fool a non-vegan into thinking these were legit chicken fingers! The creamy mac and cheese that accompanied the dish were also very good with a slight dusting of crunchy breadcrumbs and little kick of spice it felt just as indulgent as the real thing. The house made bbq sauce was more on the tangy side and I was not a huge of it but I adored the hot sauce on table to lend some heat and sourness to balance a fried dish. My least favourite part of this dish was the collard greens as they were definitely lacking and totally bland and flavourless expect for the few bits of garlic dotted through out.  When our waitress asked if we were interested in dessert I couldn't wait to try out a vegan dessert as my experience thus far had been so delightful.   Chocolate Mousse Parfait - Fluffy dark chocolate mousse, oreo bits, crushed peanuts and chocolate sauce I'm not sure what they used to make this non-dairy but I definitely could not tell the difference! It was perfectly chocolatey in taste and sooo creamy and fluffy with good body everything you want in a mousse. The crunchy bits of oreo and peanuts were equally adored to add some much needed texture to the parfait. All in all it was perfect ending to my first all vegan experience!  Overall I have to say it was quite a good experience. My aunt thoroughly enjoyed her meal which was most important! Our waitress was very nice and food was perfect in portion size and all came out really fast!  BTW they serve David's Tea here!"}
