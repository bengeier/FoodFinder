{"text":"Bought two cappuccinos here. Tasted so bad couldn't go beyond a sip. Wife said tasted ashy. When the drinks were made I was shocked to see the \"barista\" finish the espresso pour, look into the mug then take the mug back to the espresso machine and press the button again to run more water through the already used coffee! Reported the bad drinks and all she offered was to do it again. Seven bucks wasted. Went elsewhere."}
{"text":"This place is tiny and cluttered and conveniently located in the atwater market. However the coffee beans are always fresh and not badly priced either. now if only they had certified organic beans, then there would be a fifth star."}
{"text":"I had a terrific double espresso here.  They roast their beans right at the front of the shop, and there are sacks and buckets of beans being processed right in front of your eyes.  Every so often, the machine will make all sorts of beeping noises accompanied by blinking lights, making it seem like it is excited about heating coffee beans.  When I order coffee at a counter, I always ask where the beans come from - the owner told me their espressos are a blend of beans from central America - I've always preferred central American coffee to south American coffee, so that was kind of nice to hear.    Grab an almond croissant from Boulangerie Premiere Moisson in the marketplace but come here for the espresso.  It is a great combination."}
{"text":"I was freezing at the end of November, but I couldn't resist their gelato.  The flavors are all very unique, and everything tastes exactly like what it's supposed to be.  It's really smooth without being too heavy, and you can sample whatever you want before you settle down on which flavor(s) to get.  There's a little bar stool seating area inside, or you can take it to go and stroll along the rest of the market with your ice cream :)"}
{"text":"I had a regular drip coffee and it was pretty weak, probably should have got an espresso."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite spots for coffee in Montreal, not sure why it's yelp star rating is not higher, perhaps I simply don't know my coffee but to me this is one one of the best cafe au laits I have had and I always look forward to repeating the experience when I am in Montreal. They feature coffee from the major coffee growers from around the world, roast there own beans and usual select a number of coffees by the cup which they feature daily. Give them a try and see you if don't agree."}
{"text":"Me confused? I don't even know the name of this coffee place inside Marche Atwater.  All I saw the sacks and sacks of coffee beans and the coffee roaster at the front of the store.. and my Yelp friend said Coffee.. I know I want coffee.  Espresso has this nice kick... that's really jump started me.... the frothy cappuccino just not doing anything to me...  Seating is a little tight... but it is quite cozy...really cozy....  You can also buy coffee beans by bulk at Brulerie aux quatre vents... oh where am I?"}
{"text":"J'adore faire mes courses avec un café dans les mains, surtout si c'est bien de bonne heure un samedi ou un dimanche matin, avant même d'aller prendre le brunch. C'est comme ça que j'ai découvert la Brûlerie aux quatre vents il y a maintenant un peu plus d'un an. Leur lattés sont bons, corsés et vraiment pas cher (2,75 $ pour un petit qui n'est pas si petit que ça). Quelques mois plus tard, nous nous sommes acheté une machine espresso qu'on a nommée Mario. Puisqu'il nous fallait du café au plus sacrant, on s'est rendu à la Brûlerie avec la machine en boîte encore dans nos mains et on leur a simplement demandé, \"pour cette machine là, quel café devrait-on essayer?\" La sélection de café en vrac est un peu étourdissante, donc laisser leur la chance de trouver votre match parfait. Nous avons bien aimé le café qu'ils nous ont recommandé, parfait pour notre machine et agencé à nos goûts personnels, mais puisque nous aimons changer de sorte à chaque fois, nous ne l'avons pas repris depuis. Il me semble qu'on est dû pour essayer un autre mélange!"}
