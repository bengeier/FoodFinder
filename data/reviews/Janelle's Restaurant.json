{"text":"I had the fish and cheese grits. Phenomenal!  The fish was delicious cooked with a tasty cornbread coating. The grits perfect with just the right amount of cheese. Service top notch. I brought a coffee in he offered to top it off. Super friendly even though they had a line forming out the door for carry out.  Family owned and it shows. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by my cousin. Everything was delicious. It was four of us and I had chicken and waffles which the chicken was seasoned perfect and the waffles were nice and fluffy. My dad and uncle had pancakes, eggs and turkey sausage. No complaints from them and these guys are picky! The lady with us had veggie omelet with fries (back home we came them breakfast potatoes). They both were equally good as everything else. I can really see myself coming back if I'm ever in town!!!"}
