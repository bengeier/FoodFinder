{"text":"Great food, great coffee.  We had a grilled veggie panini and banana zucchini chocolate chip muffin with macchiato."}
{"text":"Very cute place! A quiet cafe with low jazz  music and organic vegan drinks and pastries. The barista's are really sweet and welcoming so don't be shy to come in"}
{"text":"Studio89 is a small & cozy cafe hidden in Mississauga.   Food-wise, there are as many options as you'd expect from a cafe with the added bonus of them being fair trade. There is also an emphasis on food that is vegan/vegetarian which is lovely.    There are many little quirks in the cafe that make the experience unique; 'Take a Book, Leave a book\" shelf, artwork for sale, community sketchbook with drawing materials by the comfy couch, board games ext.  Overall a very good experience!"}
{"text":"It's a bit out of the way but I really like the concept/idea of this place. It seems to be a nice, quiet place to chill and I rather liked their Nutella latte and cheesecake bites. I'd definitely be down for another visit.   There are board games and a little mini-library with books you can swap out for your own."}
{"text":"Studio.89 has found its way onto my list of favourite things. I've been here on both casual visits as well was part of community events and each time I've grown to love it more. It has a community feel and you can tell that the people who work there are passionate about what they do. I taste it in their food and feel it in the atmosphere. Plus, where else can I go for a great meal and a chance to learn and grow with my community? All in all Studio.89 is a unique experience and should not be missed."}
{"text":"Great space to meet a friend and have some wholesome goodies/ beverages. Awesome atmosphere and super friendly staff."}
{"text":"Just returned from this place. First of all, this place is in the middle of no where. It is overly priced and they do not have much variety. Poor customer service as the staff do not know the names and price of the bakery items. This place is good for a people who want to sit around and play board games. I am very disappointed and would not recommend this place to any one."}
{"text":"A HUGE fan of this space!  My recommendations on the food front: - Chicken / Veggie Paninis - Banana Bread and my personal fav : Nutella Latte!!!  On the whole, very cool ambiance downstairs and relaxed lounge (feels like home) place upstairs - and they always have fun events - such as movie / documentary nights along with art and film oriented workshops.  If you swing by, definitely talk to the staff and people who run this joint. Increasingly passionate and love hearing about different ideas.  A one of its kind place in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Went here with a mommy group (as I'm a new mom to a baby girl!).  It was very hipster, very cool and very laid-back.  As we were enjoying our hot beverages, a group of youngsters came in and went straight upstairs.  Apparently, they have free wi-fi and it's cool for them just to hang out as long as they want and not have to spend a dime-not even buy a drink. To me, that's generosity...especially considering it's a cafe!    Ate the veggie panini and it was very good!  I also bought some vegan treats to go for my toddler son and he liked the shortbread cookie.  The chocolate macaroon-not so much.  But still, it's nice to have a place like this in the community that offers special diet friendly treats.    I'll be back soon and I'm looking forward to trying something new off their menu-maybe the crepes!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Non-for-profit. Super cool place. Great vegetarian, vegan, organic, etc options but they don't push it on you. Very laid back. Would love to see this place grow and open new locations. Cool concept, a MUST CHECK OUT place!"}
{"text":"2 - 2.5/5 for the food. 5/5 for the concept.  Studio.89 is the brainchild of the team behind Youth Troopers for Global Awareness, a youth-led non-profit organization with a focus on social justice. I've had this place bookmarked for awhile now, but I only got around to checking it out today. It was a bit hard to find, as it is tucked away in a back corner of the Global Business Park at Tomken and Eglinton.  The main cafe space is inviting, with two family room-esque areas off to either side, each with a couch and large coffee table; a few small 2-person tables in front of the counter, and several 4-person tables in the middle. Some of the tables double as chalkboards, which is cool in theory, but could also be seen as an annoyance (depending on how much you care about your shirt sleeves). An infographic outlining the concept of the cafe and its programming and the philosophy of the people behind it is prominently featured on one wall. Throughout the space are works created by various local artists. All very cool.  Now the food. They offer a variety of coffees, espresso-based drinks, teas, baked goods, and sandwichs. Their coffee is certified organic, shade grown, fair trade, and bird- and rainforest-friendly. Actually, almost everything is fair trade and organic. There are also many vegan and gluten-free options. I ordered an almond milk latte and a slice of the banana chocolate bread, both of which were meh. The latte was on the weaker side and the ratio of espresso-to-milk-to-foam was completely off. The banana chocolate bread had just the right amount of sweetness and a nice hit of chocolate, but it was also dry, crumbly, and not very banana-y.  Now the service. It's cool that Studio.89 is primarily staffed by volunteers, but the two people who were behind the counter on the day I went could not have appeared more uninterested in what they were doing. One looked up from her texting or gaming only long enough to enter my order into the register. The other person took my order and promptly forgot it, leading to him asking the girl (who was already back on her phone) to remind him what kind of tea I had ordered...  Overall, Studio.89 is a very cool communal and community space, with average (at best) food and service on this day. Considering the food alone, I would not be inclined to return... but because I believe in what they are trying to accomplish and I do want to see them succeed, I will probably return a few more times to see if my experience on this day was the exception and not the rule."}
{"text":"Popped in for a quick coffee and was pleasantly surprised! Definitely not your typical cafe! Has your standard offerings of a bistro and youth resource centre all in one. The cafe offers OPTIONS for everyone's dietary needs!   Organic fair trade vegan vegetarian gluten free seasonal offerings and yes you carnivores out there...meat offerings  Coffee was delish! Aromatic and with a thick crema! If that wasn't enough they had almond milk so much better than soy and a rare find!  The food looked amazing- didn't try it as I just had breakfast.   They had an events board with game nights, movie nights, and workshops. Public sketch book, table chalk art the list goes on! Talking with the barista I was impressed with the offerings and that Mississauga is starting to branch out with something other than your big box offerings.  Supporting local youth, healthy treats you don't feel guilty eating and fun...I'm in!"}
{"text":"Great place! Awesome Eco-friendly everything and friendly staff. Programming + board games and books to read in their free space as well."}
{"text":"Finally, I was in the area and got the opportunity to try the place as It was quite hyped up.   Props for the theme, decor and vibe of the restaurant and available board games. Hence, that's where they got the 2 stars.   For a cafe the service was quite poor and this is where it all went downhill. On my visit their espresso coffee machine was not working so we couldn't have any lattes, but not a problem I went with a tea latte as the server said she can heat the milk up on the stove and make a tea latte. I went with one of their fruit flavour tea but I was quite disappointed as I received hot milk with a tea bag placed into it with no tea flavour and not even mixed. Then we tried the strawberry banana smoothly which was quite disappointing as well.   There a plenty of seats to chill and relax with friend."}
{"text":"Organic-stomach and heart Safe foods.  Studio.89 staff and volunteers are super friendly and informative on community events that are held in their space. Check out their website for the calendar."}
{"text":"A very quaint and cute place! It's a community hub, and when we went, there were some people just chilling about, working on their laptops. They have a bunch of board games lying in the corner for you to play with friends, and the tables are also made of chalkboards. During my visit, Visual Arts Mississauga (@VAM) was hosting a paint event, and there were a couple of eager participants.  The food itself is pretty good! I ordered a kale salad with seed medley and sauteed vegetables, and the entire dish plus tax ended up being under $5. What a steal! The portion was fairly generous with the seeds, but my main complaint is that the dressing was too much and too heavy. The chocolate zucchini muffin was delicious and sooo chocolatey. Yum!  However, my friend ordered a grilled cheese sandwich and was very disappointed by the final product. The cheese came in chunks, but was not fully melted at all. You could see the massive blocks of cheese as the sandwich wasn't sufficiently hot.  In terms of location, the place is positioned in a very industrial place and so I'm quite concerned about foot traffic and the long term viability of this place. Hopefully it lasts, as it is doing good for the community!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of everything this cafe is! As those of you who follow my reviews know, my biggest disappointment in the GTA is that we lack cool independent coffee spots. Don't get me wrong, I still love my triple, mocha, half fat, yaddah, yaddah, yaddah... but the experience is a dime a dozen and I can't help but think its a production line experience akin to Walmart or McDonalds. What do I mean? The experience ends up being transactional without a human element.  Enter Studio.89, where the human element takes centre stage WITH the incredible coffee. This place actually began as a NPO (and continues to be) but when they were looking for office space they decided that a coffee shop would be a great way to be self sustaining as an NPO without always having to rely on the donations of outside sources.  To quote their website/yelp business page directly: \"We try to be all sorts of awesome by providing fair trade, organic, bird-friendly and rain forest certified coffee, and by providing other ethical and yummy treats and products! (Check out Our Menu at studio89.org) We are committed to making conscious consumerism affordable and accessible.\"  The space is HUGE, albeit hidden in the back of a plaza near Tomken and Eglington in Mississauga. The look and feel exudes community! From the collaborative space on the open mezzanine level the community sketch book, the chalk board paint covered tables, and then the staff - all super friendly and inviting, totally engrossed in their community.  And the coffee? Well they've got all the big brand faves but best of you all, you can count on it being Fair trade and organic - the same as all of the food they serve.  For those looking for a place to work, the WiFi is quick and FREE, and there is no time limit on your stay, so this is the place for you in Mississauga!  Come by sometime - I plan on making this my new Mississauga Yelp Office now!  PS - Vegans, Gluten Free-bies and Vegetarians? They've got you covered here too!"}
{"text":"Really cool place to have a coffee, sit and talk to friends :) food is great, and they even have gluten free options! Would definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"Such a cozy and quaint little coffee shop. We came one quiet Sunday evening. It's got a few tables and chairs, one or two couches (very relaxing atmosphere).  At first there was no background music, and it was so quiet, it was a little awkward to have a conversation. But then someone's Spotify play list came on and it was great.  I also loved the latte (strong bold flavour) and how their drinks are organic and free trade.  They have events happening almost daily and you can check it out on their chalkboard next to the couch.  Other than this coffee shop, there's nothing else in the area. You can grab your drink to go and enjoy."}
{"text":"Studio 89 is a fare trade, non profit café and serve organic food. I read about this café on yelp, and I became a fan after reading their concept. Last week I was in that area, and decided to go there with my wife. We tried grilled veg Panini, café mocha and gluten free banana walnut loaf. Food is good and it gives you positive vibe knowing that its organic and healthy.  Atmosphere inside is cosy and comfortable, very friendly people however I feel it is missing that zing factor. They can make some changes to make it lil more vibrant, like some kinda music can really help.   Overall it is a great place, I love the cause and concept. There should more such café's. It was a very good experience!"}
{"text":"Really interesting place to have a coffee and snack. Great atmosphere that make you feel relaxed and coffee is pretty good!"}
{"text":"Studio 89 is is a great coffee house set in a suburban area. A friendly staff and excellent coffee. The coffee house hosts a number evenings with music, poetry and comedy."}
{"text":"I've been working in this area for over 5 years, and I'm so glad to finally discover a healthy fresh food lunch place that isn't sushi or shawarma.   Lots of vegan, veggie and gluten free options here. They have GF crepes (buckwheat) made with non dairy cheese and other fun toppings. I had a crepe with chicken, hummus, \"cheese\", red peppers. Very yummy.   They also have pannini (not GF) that looked really food.   This space is beautiful with high ceilings, and a chalkboard that lists their menu and their mandate. I believe this is a type of not for profit coworking space. There's a big common area upstairs that you can work in.   My only complaint was that the service and food was really slow. I get that they make everything fresh, but you will need to have time and expect a long lunch here. Maybe a Friday afternoon."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The ambiance is so relaxing, the volunteers are great, and the coffee and food are decent. The whole concept of it being non-profit, fair trade sets it apart from any other coffee shop in Mississauga which is why it deserves 5 stars.   Check their calendar of events before you drop by (especially on weekends) as they book out the space for local events and charity groups. Another reason why I love this place!  If you are looking for a place that is laid back  with a homey feel you've found it!"}
{"text":"Normally 4 stars, but love the concept so much, that it gets the extra star for being a NPO to help fund the youth community.   I have a love affair with indie coffee shops, except some of these indie shops are now becoming chains (Crema, Balzacs, etc.  Can we really call Balzac's indie considering they are funded by venture capitalists?) A lot of the indie shops in core Toronto are way too noisy.  This place is quiet and you can get work done.   Things I really like about this place: -Good chai tea latte -All workers are unpaid volunteers -Fair trade, bird friendly, organic, etc.  -Quiet, nice tables -An upstairs, no shoe area.    Like the Wifi password for the day I came to this place, it's awesomesauce."}
{"text":"I am not into organic, vegan etc. but this place is absolutley fantastic. It has a relaxed feel, great design, excellent coffee and cookies. I never tried lunch but I like to come in for an hour or so, read a good book over a latte or bring a friend and play a board game.   Board games and books are on site and free to use.   Check out their twitter account for upcoming events. Everyday there is a free workshop or something happening in this place."}
{"text":"I was very dissapointed. Taste of food was good but was frozen(wrap, buns) no fresh made. All food was warmed in microwave. We ordered first but our food came as last and after I complain she excused herself for being there alone. For quesadilla I don't get any cutlery. Probably won't be coming back and not going to recommend."}
{"text":"Hipster central. Great ambience, great drinks and great desert (their chocolate tea and cookie truffles are to die for). Fridays are board game nights, which is a treat and something very atypical of Mississaauga cafes. Non-for profit, fair trade and organic ~ BRILLIANT. This is our new spot."}
{"text":"Been here a few times since they opened, everything has been great!  Love the business concept and the social enterprise aspect of it.   Vegan friendly whooooo and delicious!  Whether it's their cookies/tarts/sandwiches or chai latte they always bring the flavors and heart!  Space is good for casual hang out and available for community event. They have a huge calendar with different events every day of the week.  Free books to read there and board games to play ^_^  Everyone I have brought here love it!   Staff are super friendly and volunteering so props to them!"}
{"text":"This review is solely for place itself as we haven't had the opportunity to sample the food here. Studio 89 is a fantastic place to get some work done, hangout with friends, or simply play some games. I really love the concept here, being a non-for-profit cafe, it's hard not to root for these guys.   The place was quite spacious, there's many tables and chairs, and there was two floors. It's a very laidback and relaxed vibe going on here; there's even couches if you want to lounge around. Being a multi-purposed space like this means it could get loud depending on the circumstances, but for most instances, it should be fine.   We had the mint chocolate tea here and shared it. It was a really good blend. The mint was powerful and refreshing with sweet tones of chocolate. We asked for the pot to be filled with hot water many times and it helped keep us going.  The only downside was that the place was definitely on the colder side here and we had to wear jackets to stay warm. But I did like the fact there was nice natural lighting come into the space."}
{"text":"Restaurant is currently under renovation to expand the space; But had to revise my order as barista didnt knew what's available in store or not"}
{"text":"So after the Guilty Dog shut down for some unknown reason!!! We found this place as we heard they do a game night on Fridays. The proceeds from the drinks, food and treats are all for a great cause and the place is really cute. The staff are exceptional as well. The atmosphere is really great, can get overcrowded but hey that is a good thing! The coffee and treats are soooo good!! Last night we had this cheesecake bite and this chocolate cookie truffle thing and they were both incredible! You can bring your own board game or cards etc.. but they have lots there. Highly recommend you check them out."}
{"text":"Watery Americano, crappy muffin....over $8!! Ridiculous. Bad prices. The interior looks like someone's badly designed living room, all employees were sitting down and socializing at various tables, they were slow moving and bored....  I love dogs, but why is one allowed inside? Isn't that a health code violation? (I'm pretty sure it wasn't a service dog either. If it was, my bad, no offence intended). The walls are a hot mess and they are trying to sell someone's handmade soap? I love discovering new coffee places and this area of Mississauga considers Tim Hortons fine dining, so it was exciting to discover something unique. But I can't recommend it."}
{"text":"Had no idea it was a youth resource centre? Anyways kind of a strange flow to this place... The server (who may have been a volunteer... Not totally sure) had no idea what kind of flour was in the cookies... Kind of strange considering they're suppose to be vegan, gluten free and whatever else free  Since I wasn't sure what was totally fresh.. I ordered a bit size brownie. Nothing really special about it and unfortunately would not go back for it...  Interesting idea... But this place is just weird"}
{"text":"Great food!! It's a nice and cozy cafe to spend your afternoons!!   The staff members were extremely friendly and nice.  Thank you for letting us do our engagement photo shoot there!!"}
{"text":"Studio 89 is a truly hidden gem, and a cafe that anyone in close proximity to Mississauga should check out. I have been to Studio 89 on a few occasions including attending their events, working on my laptop, and hosting my own events as well.   This is a not-for-profit cafe that serves fair trade, organic, bird-friendly and rainforest certified coffee along with various ethically produced food and drink products.   I love their free intimate paint, game and comedy nights. The staff are friendly and the co-founder Cheryl, is always full of energy, gregarious and welcoming."}
{"text":"cozy ambience warm, inviting, quite home-y unique for 'sauga  the coffee's decent the food is merely okay but that's not the point  you come here to read, study, do work, or even attend their events:  programming classes, jazzy sunday open mics, weekly board game nights  most importantly, this cafe's not-for-profit go support their cause!"}
{"text":"Great and friendly service. Loved the organic bread in which they tell you the organic and simple ingredients that they make it with. It was delicious. High quality coffee, saw them organic milk they used with it for my cappuccino. Definitely worth stopping by. Oh and they don't take American Express cards. Just FYI if your a business person."}
{"text":"Had a great experience at Studio.89! Food continues to be great and I've always received great service! I've attended some community events here as well as just come solo and each time I've come back happy. I hear that they advertise as a community hub and they clearly hit it on the mark - this cafe truly captures the community feel!"}
{"text":"I had the strawberry banana smoothie Excellent smoothie, very smooth and flavorful + not overly sweet, a solid 4/5 I was trying to enjoy it as best as I could except the straw was terrible and split while I was drinking... 0/5 which averages out to a 2/5. I like the idea and biodegradable stuff is great but I'd rather not be concerned about cutting my lip on pseudo-plastic :/"}
{"text":"Haven't actually tried their food, but the ambience is really good! Looking forward to chilling and eating here one day!"}
{"text":"I came by here on a Sunday evening. I had a Nutella Lattee and It was great. They didn't have almond milk or any lactose free option available besides flax at the time so I decided to just have it with regular milk because flax doesn't sound appetizing at all.  Its a little hard to find since its in the back complex but totally worth it. The tables are chalkboards which is tons of fun even for grown ups cause come on who doesn't love playing on the talk board. Tic Tac Toe is a classic.   They also have an assortment of board games which are fun to play with we played scramble which was tons of fun.  They have some food options all of which seem delicious.   The staff was all really friendly and social. There are some comfortable couches off to the side which is a nice touch.   The bathrooms here were the cleanest I've ever been to just like being a home.    The entire concept of this place is great and I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"I'll admit that I'm not quite sure how the non-profit element of this place comes into play, but I am all for fair trade/birds+bees friendly coffee, making consumers more conscious of what they're buying, giving back to the community, etc.  The Good: -  the concept, including the coffee beans, that this café+ sells -  the coffee is SOLID (also stay-in mug was HUGE!) -  even though it's basically a warehouse space, the mix of mishmash furniture gives it a homey feel -  staff were friendly and nice  The Needs Improvement: -  friend ordered banana bread and it was as as dry as sawdust, like crumbly dry ***banana bread could've been gluten-free, but still dry nevertheless*** -  I ordered a granola bar, portion was generous, but it too was quite dry, fell apart  Location is probably what kills this place.  It is in a weird, industrial area of Mississauga, in a somewhat new-ish commercial plaza, on a dead-end street.  So unless you have business in the area/you are lost, you won't really end up here!  There's a dental office, various types of medical offices, a law office, and a bunch of other offices.  I don't think there are other food/drink vendors in this plaza.  So the location of this place is not ideal.  Would probably do better in an area with more pedestrian traffic, re:  Port Credit, Streetsville, etc.  Would definitely visit again, but I'm rarely if ever in this area!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Very cute and cozy where you can chill for a few hours and get work done."}
{"text":"Heard about this cafe for awhile now but didn't get a chance to check it out since it is tucked away in a plaza in an area that I rarely go to. As soon as I walked in, I saw on their blackboard that said that the items in the cafe are fair trade, organic and bird-friendly!   It was a Friday night and didn't realize that it was also board games night. I LOVE board games so it would be great to join a group or bring my own games next time! They also host various social gatherings/events, so feel free to check out their sites for more info.   They have quite a few selections on the drinks, as well as crepes, sandwiches and baked goods. What surprised me most was that they have hemp milk as one of their milk options. I've never had hemp milk before so I decided to be adventurous and ordered a hot hemp latte. I also ordered a corn maize chocolate brownie. The medium latte (~$4.10) tasted REALLY weird to me; and immediately I knew I didn't like hemp. I should have just stuck with my usual cappuccino. My friend with me also ordered the same thing, but with added hazulnut syrup. It was grassy and fishy tasting me. It is definitely an acquired taste though. I didn't really want to waste it so I just drank as much as I could. On the other hand, I really enjoyed eating that corn maize chocolate cookie. It was made with corn flour, black bean, cacao, and many other vegan things. It was ABSOLUTELY delicious. It had a strong dark chocolate flavour and it was chewy and soft. I will for sure get this again!"}
{"text":"Dropped by for the first time today even though I've known about this place for a while. It's a cozy community based cafe, offering fair trade products. They have a large seating area with art adorning the walls and a shelf with board and card games to use. Couches are super comfy, you plop your ass down with a drink and snack in hand, people watch, converse, read or browse the Internet. Lots to do, in other words. I ordered tea and a vegan brownie, which tasted better than any store bought brownie. Then I went and bought a bunch more to take home! Very decadent. No pictures to show cause I ate it fast."}
{"text":"Super cozy and nice! Had a latte and almond butter dark chocolate bites and it was delicious! They have board games and other fun things to do in there. Diffidently my favorite new spot!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars after my second visit  I hate downgrading local independent places especially ones that have a wonderful social awareness attached to them.   The espresso drink I got was lukewarm, watery, and had very little flavour.  I hate to say please don't come here but sadly, I have to.  I can't recommend this place for an espresso based drink.  Perhaps come for the comfortable seating and place to chill but maybe get yourself a good drink elsewhere."}
{"text":"This cafe is a wonderful concept; they strive to provide the highest quality, fair trade food and snacks that you can feel totally comfortable eating, along with a great space for community gatherings. It is a cozy place that has a very inviting atmosphere and the owners are the kindest, most compassionate and caring people you could meet. They truly want to make the world a better place and work hard every day in the background to encourage youth initiatives and raise awareness about issues that affect our lives. Their upstairs is a welcoming shoe-free zone where you can use computers or do some reading. I would recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Studio 89 is hidden in a new plaza and the parking is certainly dark in the evenings. I discovered it as I went for a free paint night (with watercolours). It has a cool concept that this cafe is non-profit and most of the items are organic and healthy. There are 2 levels to the cafe, but most people hang out on the first floor. There are chairs and couches for you to lounge around. Upstairs, one must take of their shoes.   Happy:  They have a calendar on their website about events that are happening every week and every month. It's cool to meet local people while doing a fun activities. Every Fridays evening, they have free game board night! You can bring your own games while they provide some typical ones. The people working there are mostly volunteers and they are truly friendly. They'll answer any of your questions. I love the wall where they state their cafe's concept or philosophy. It's a quieter place to read or work instead of Starbucks.   Not happy:  The upstairs portion of the cafe can be cleaner and organized.   Verdict:  I've been there a couple of times already and it's a fun place to hang out."}
{"text":"A coffee shop run by the non-profit organization YTGA. Epitome of hipster coffee shop. Awesome atmosphere, feels very homey. They offer a vegan, organic and gluten-free selection (I'm not hipster enough to appreciate this, but I'm sure many will). Most their products are fair trade (coffee, sugar, etc.) which makes you feel a bit less guilty spending more than you would in a Starbucks. The coffee and specialty drinks are delicious (highly recommend their Nutella Latte). They have a modest selection of savoury meals, but they taste fresh and not processed. Highly recommend checking this place out, easily my favourite coffee shop in Mississauga!"}
{"text":"Very cool and hip little Cafe tucked away in a corner in Mississauga. I saw this place on yelp and decided to check it out - glad I did! This Cafe is a non for profit Cafe and I really admire what they stand for. They operate by the community, for the community. Everything they have is made in house and they even use local ingredients and materials. I ordered a tropical smoothie which was quite tasty and the cup and straw was made of recyclable and biodegradable material.   - The place has a bunch of board games for all you board game lovers - There is also a monthly schedule of events as the Cafe hosts things such as open mic nights, club meetings, and get togethers - very community oriented - The Cafe also proudly supports small businesses and allows them to advertise and sell their products in the Cafe (bring your products here!) - There is a second floor seating area with couches,   chairs, tables, etc - perfect for studying and socializing. And there are a bunch of books (leave a book, take a book). The upstairs is also a no shoe zone - very home-ey.   Overall a great place! Will be coming back again whenever I'm in the area!"}
