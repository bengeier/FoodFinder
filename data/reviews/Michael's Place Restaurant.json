{"text":"My wife and I recently went to Michaels for breakfast and it was a positive experience for us both. As a new restaurant, it is important to spread the word and help build the local restaurant by patronizing it. You can check out the menu at http://michaelsplacerestaurant.net/uploads/Menu.pdf. Bring your appetite! The portions are huge!!!"}
{"text":"Always good food and service!!  The ladies always make us feel like family and have basically seen my son grow from infancy.  Rented their party room for my son's function.  Pricey but the service and room were great.  Seems like they have a well oiled machine!"}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere, very good and reasonably priced food. The service was top notch. The only complaint I have was the booth I was sitting in...every time the person behind me moved, he rocked my side of the booth."}
{"text":"Really just your average senior citizen restaurant. It's usually not busy, so service is next to none, and cooking times is weirdly slow. But the food is good, well priced, and there is a good variety on the menu."}
{"text":"My mother and I had dinner.  The portions were quite large.  The food was fresh.  This has to be one of North Royalton's best restaurants.  Our server was friendly and very attentive.  She did an excellent job serving the customers.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"5:30 Friday, during Lent.  I placed a take out order.  The order taker wasn't too  familiar w/ the menu.  I had trouble placing my order which was partially my fault.  
We ordered coconut shrimp, broiled cod and breaded cod.   All were exceptional.  I ordered baked potato and got mashed.  The amount of Chicken in the chicken soup was the chef thought of a picture of a chicken while stirring the soup.   
All three dinners were $10 to $12
I'll go back, but I got a poorly produced takeout menu to assist in the next order."}
{"text":"I was not impressed at all. We met my in laws here for brunch. The service was lack-luster and they got several orders wrong. They also forgot one of my niece's order all together. They had to ask what she had ordered. Food was mediocre. Service was disappointing. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Today is the second time that I have been here. The breakfast is outstanding. The food was fresh and service was quick. The prices were comparable with other restaurants. This is by far much better than your typical chain store restaurants"}
{"text":"We came here for Sunday brunch a few weeks ago and tried the buffet option.  While there weren't oodles of options, what they had was cooked to perfection. My fresh made omelet was incredible... The cheese melting with the gooey eggs as I cut into it and the slight saltiness of the ham was scrumptious together. All of the food on the buffet was made fresh; no boxed eggs there.  I enjoyed the French toast a great deal... It didn't even need syrup that's how flavorful it was. There was fresh cut fruit, muffins, bacon, sausage, all yummy! I would certainly recommend this place for Sunday brunch"}
{"text":"We we looking for a place to go for a Sunday brunch after church. Did a search here on Yelp and found Michael's Place was fairly close to our home and had good reviews. I had never heard of them. 

We agree with most reviews here! Sunday brunch is served from 9am till 2pm. $8.99 for adults, $5.99 for kids. The offered home fries, scrambled eggs, ham, sausage, bacon, Belgian waffles and French toast. Also fruit and muffins to go with made to order omelets. All the food was tasty and a good value for the money. My only criticism, which is common at buffets, is the food could have been hotter. Waffles and French toast were on the cool side. 

Service was good and I am sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Lets say you intensely dislike your life, then this is the place to go to make sure you get pushed over the edge to hating it. We walked in on a week day, it was not rush hour, it was early brunch hours.. we were greeted in a manner which resembled the weather in late December outside - cold. Which was whatever, we were starving and wanted to eat. 

We were seated swiftly, more like - sit wherever, we'll be with you - and then we started to practice our patience. We waited forever for the waitress to show up who could not have been more disinterested. She had reached the epitome of the zen state of not caring, pretty inspirational if you ask me - I'm staying positive aren't i ? 

Then we were trained further in the art of being patient for some of the crappiest tea I have had in a while which made me appreciate all the other teas I've had. This place should rebrand itself into a zen bootcamp at this rate. Moving on, then we practiced patience for sugar - its bad for you anyway, they were probably just looking out for me. 

Our waitress took our order, then we meditated for a moment which felt like eternity to be reminded we need to be thankful for good food whenever we get it because we could have had food like the food we got. Bland, greasy junk which we left unfinished. After the brief lesson in letting go - we practiced more patience waiting for the check which ended our stay in this place. 

We were really poor students so we walked over to get the heck outta the place, If i could go back in time and undo this, would I ... not really .. how else can i appreciate anything over sub par service, bland food and horrible choices in music. (fine the music bit was prolly not their fault but whatvever)

So here is the tl;dr version - go here, learn to be patient, appreciative and thankful or in other words, don't go here if you value your time, money and tastebuds."}
{"text":"Nice place, good service although it wasn't too busy when we came in on a Monday morning and it took 25 minutes to get our food.  Come in guys, breakfast should not take that long to make!

Our server was excellent. Friendly and attentive.

Standard breakfast food. Simple, very good and just the right portions."}
{"text":"Ordered the Gyro omelette that was out of this world.  Professionally prepared. Food temperature was perfect and was not over cooked.  Establishment was well lit with a pleasant atmosphere.  Waitress was extremely pleasant.  Prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place I really appreciate.  Locally owned, not part of a chain, located in a strip mall shopping center.  It is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Nice menu with a variety of items, most under $10.  I was there for breakfast.  Four egg omelets under $10.
Kielbasa omelet as the daily special !  Needs to be on the menu. Awesome!  Food was well prepared and seasoned.  Service was friendly. 
This is nowhere near where I live or work, but if it was I would make it a regular stop."}
{"text":"Got a breakfast burrito to go from here. It was kind of like a mushroom omelette in a tortilla. Pretty good for what it was but not exactly what I was craving. Definitely be sure to add avocado to the inside of your burrito!"}
{"text":"Came here with my fianc√© for some breakfast/lunch. Service was amazing. Super friendly atmosphere. Our food came out in less than 5-10 minutes, and the food was super delicious. Defiantly coming here again. :)"}
{"text":"We were seated right away.....and then the waiting started. 

We waited for drinks. 
Waited for refills. 
Waited for our server to take our order. 
Waited for our breakfast to come. 
Waited again for coffee refills. 

Our food was fair at best. 

We had 4 adults at the table and none of us were impressed. 

This goes on our ONE AND DONE list"}
{"text":"It is so hard to find high-quality yet simple food. This is the place!  While visiting from Arizona, our son-in-law brought us here for a weekday breakfast and we ordered the combo so we could each try eggs, meat and starch of our choosing. I had scrambled eggs and they were soft yet completely cooked (perfect). The sausage patties were average. The star of the meal was the real potato pancakes served w/sour cream and applesauce! Awesome! The meal was big enough to share.  I am also a coffee snob and the coffee was great, too!"}
{"text":"This was a surprise in my own backyard! The food was fresh and quick. Buffet is inexpensive and an omelet station! Can accommodate large parties and quickly seat a party of 2! Decor could use a little update as it looks like a banquet center but a good old fashioned breakfast couldn't be better!"}
{"text":"Great place, their brunch buffet is excellent."}
{"text":"Service was spotty as I do not believe there were enough waiters, but the food was great and prices reasonable. I would recommend Michael's for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Went there on Mother's Day for the breakfast buffet. First time there so we didn't know what to expect. Surprise- buffet was excellent. Great variety of eggs, muffins, a huge pile of bacon, even an omelet station. The omelet guy was good- he'll make you any omelet you want in about a minute.
Service was great too- nothing I hate worse than having to wait and wait for a coffee refill. But someone was always coming around with coffee. All in all this is a great neighborhood restaurant. I'll be back."}
{"text":"We spent the night in the area on our way to Antietam.  We slept too late for free breakfast so we jumped on Yelp and found this place.

Wow, what a fresh and delicious breakfast.  I had the breakfast burrito which was outstanding.  It was a faux Mexican, just the mild way I like it. The home fries were also great. My side of ham was just enough.  Coffee was very good as was oj.

Add onto that clean bathrooms and perfect service.  What a great way to start the day and the next leg of our journey."}
{"text":"Nice little place, I would definitely come back again. The rating would have been 4-star if it weren't for really poor service and lukewarm homefries.

It took between 10-15 minutes for someone to come over, greet us and get a drink order, and another 35 minutes for our breakfast omelets to arrive. That's a little too long. During this time our waitress never stopped by to see if refills were needed. 

Once the food arrived it was pretty good. The omelet was piping hot and tasted great. The homefries were good as well, but they were barely warm. Same thing for the other two people I was with that ordered homefries.

This was a Sunday around lunch, and I have a feeling the kitchen staff may have been thrown off that day which accounted for the long wait times. Apparently, there is usually a breakfast buffet, but it was shut down this particular day because of a private party. I'm guessing the kitchen wasn't used to having to make breakfast for that many individuals, but instead just pans of food for a general buffet. 

I'd definitely go back and give them another try."}
{"text":"My dad and I come here every so often. The staff is always friendly. I usually get a cheese omelet, which comes with hash browns/ home fries and toast. The omelet itself is always delicious with cheese oozing out with every bite! The breakfast potatoes are always delicious, too. Although this might sound very weird, we sometimes get chicken noodle soup with our breakfasts. It is very, very good. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone!"}
