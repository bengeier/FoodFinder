{"text":"I knew the original owners who were excellent, and I would often order a party tray to take out since I had a business in Stouffville myself at the time.

However, over the years, I find that the quality of the food, and the selection have fallen off. Service is okay, not great, and for me, I only go there if I feel to lazy to go somewhere more authentic that has better food and a broader selection.

It's also not cheap, but basically convenient."}
{"text":"Beautiful, clean restaurant with free wifi.  The service was fast and efficient.

Came here for dinner one Friday night and it was pretty busy--85% of the tables were occupied.  For an AYCE restaurant, every item we ordered arrived and was not missed.  The sashimi was fresh and nicely sliced (some restaurants are either too thick or thin).  The bonus, they had Ika sashimi (squid) and very few AYCE has that.  The presentation was excellant.

Ordered a few pieces of the Octopus and Unagi sushi and it came with big pieces of meat over small rounds of rice. Very delicious!  The maki were nothing too special, especially the Spicy Tuna Roll, that practically had no tuna in it, just tempura bits--this is where it lost the 2 stars).

The hot food was overall good, enjoyed the grilled kalbi and grilled squid a lot.

It's pretty expensive compared to other AYCE ($25 weekend dinner, if I remember correctly)."}
{"text":"Nice decor and free wifi. 'Average' loud at dinner time.
AYCE sushi place. 

The wait staff are polite but service is slow. Some orders that were placed did not arrive at the table.

Food... Over half of the maki ordered were falling apart on the plate. I've seen better rolling technique from my nephew. Ingredient ratios in the rolls are out of whack. There's more tempura bits than mango in the sweet mango roll. 
The salmon sashimi looked really sad on the plate; all mangled and small.

Tempura items are not crispy enough and drenched in oil; likely due to the oil not being hot enough. 

You can't go wrong with the green tea ice cream at the end."}
{"text":"Been going here for a few years now. But now it seems the quality of food is going down.

The beef teriyaki is over cooked and chewy. The chicken teriyaki was dry."}
{"text":"Very friendly and fast service. For lunch the all you can eat is the best value over the menu. The food is good quality and the prices are reasonable. The reason I only give 3 stars is because I watched a lady who wanted to sit in a particular part of this small dining room and was refused being told it was closed. Subsequently she left the establishment. I dont know the reason she was told it was closed but I think that was the wrong thing to say and I think I would have left under the same circumstance. Other than that I enjoyed my lunch experience."}
{"text":"Went for all you can eat sushi. The place is pretty nice and the iPad ordering system is cool. BUT they didn't bring FIVE dishes that we had ordered. Forgetting one here or there can be forgiven, but we had a whole list of things that we ordered and never received. When we asked for them a second time, sometimes they would come, but sometimes we had to ask a third time. If this was a cheap place maybe I would understand, but at $26 per person I won't be back for all you can eat. Maybe I would get takeout but check the order before leaving!"}
{"text":"Eaten at a lot of All-U-Can-Eat sushi restaurants in my time and this one holds up just fine. Eat here often and always leave happy & full. Service is good they occasionally bring you something you didn't order but I haven't been to a AYCE sushi place that doesn't do that every once in a while."}
{"text":"Food is average but service is bad. They even put someone else's food in our table by mistake more than once. It takes a while before your food to be on your table. It's quite slow, seems like they do it on purpose so you don't order too much."}
{"text":"A decent AYCE sushi place in Stouffville.

Service is good.  There was only one time that one of my order didn't come but they made it for me right away and apologized.

Food selection and quality is average compared to the other AYCE.  Price is average or just slightly higher.

Overall, I am just happy there is this restaurant in Stouffville because there is not a huge selection of cuisines here =)"}
{"text":"Way to good!This is the only great place in Toronto, so much good soup, and foods. You need to order on the iPad.They have lots of foods. I'd like to come back to this place!!( It's pretty small though)"}
{"text":"The quality of food was amazing. I love the tablet concept. The servers were all extremely friendly and one of them was even cheering us on to finish that last bite of food so we didn't have to pay extra. Free refills on pop too! Which is great since I tend to down at least three glasses."}
{"text":"I eat sushi on average 4 times a week all around the GTA and always look forward to coming back to Maki Zushi, You can always judge the commitment to quality of a sushi restaurant by the sashimi. Their sashimi is first rate. 

I have noticed over the last year there had been a relentless push to improve the customer experience, expanding the menu and getting the orders to the table ASAP. Presentation is thoughtful, it seems the owner has a sense of pride - which is a good sign.  They have just added a salmon salad to the lunch AYCE menu, it is basically salmon sashimi on spring greens. So you do not have to go for the dinner menu to get some sashimi - cool!

Their prices are on par with all other decent AYCE places."}
{"text":"The food is delivered quickly and for the most part tastes good. Unless of course you find a piece of curly black hair in it like my wife did in her vegetables. But I would say the worst things about this place is the \"manager\". This guy is unprofessional, racist and a liar. Twice we were promised discounts that were unavailable at the last second because the \"boss is not here\". Not to mention his racists remarks in Chinese regarding my wife and the tip we left him, when he didn't even deserve it. My wife is Chinese you moron! If the owner of the place is reading this - contact me for more info."}
{"text":"We get their be to boxes to go and they are a great value for price. Lots to eat and were stuffed by the end. It's always fresh."}
{"text":"Went on Sunday lunch for my son's birthday -- we usually go to another place, but they were closed for a private party so we looked this place up in Yelp and headed over.

We arrived at 1:50 and were not seated until 2 pm. there were 7 of us, but there were plenty of seats available -- just no one manning the lobby.

They asked if we had been there before - we said no -- and they handed us an Ipad and left. They did not explain how to use the menu system at all, although we are tech savvy people and figured it out.

They have a great selection of appetizers for lunch -  but the ones we ordered ( can't really remember them ) didn't make it to our table --- only the mains did.

For the sushi selections at lunch, it seemed like just a number of variations on shrimp, salmon and tuna. no real selection."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Stouffville and always passed this restaurant recently. So today me and my fianc√© decided to see what it's like. We were really impressed. The inside was spotless and so nice. There was a bit of confusion about us not wanting the all you can eat option but that was soon figured out. The food was really beautifully presented and tasted so good and fresh. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful. It wasn't too busy for a Thursday evening but i guess it was still earlyish. I would defiantly go back and try some more of their menu."}
{"text":"Our third time here. I think is the best yet. Love the food! Go ahead and try this place and enjoy the pan fried salmon. The sashimi sushi was just perfect with the right marbling!"}
{"text":"Really fresh and great food. Quick and friendly service. Little pricey but again it's all you can eat. Nice interior and great location"}
{"text":"Pretty average (but consistent) AYCE restaurant every time I've been there.  The food is average for an AYCE place and the service is pretty average.

The sushi fish wasn't the freshest which is typical for AYCE but wasn't bad by any means.  Good selection of food but nothing really stood out to me.

The service is never quick but never horribly slow either.  Further, the servers always seem very lifeless like it's just about getting through another day opposed to really caring for the customer.  Functional service, just not particularly good.

The one thing worth mentioning is the fact that the restaurant and presentation of the food is fantastic.  My sushi trays always come out looking like something from a brochure. Just a little disappointing that everything else doesn't stand out in the same way.

The location is super convenient for me (since I live in Stouffville) but it's a little pricey.  Most times I'd rather drive to Markham to get better food for less."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a good atmosphere and you use iPads to place your order which is cool. The food was good but a bit on the expensive side but not many options in Stouffville."}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE sushi places. Only downside is that it can get VERY busy and it sometimes looks like they are understaffed. The sushi is great, the price is great too."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant on Monday evening and it turned out to be pretty good. The atmosphere was nice, it was quiet and the food was pretty fresh. I was hoping for some garlic beef, however their beef was so soft just to my liking. I would definetly go back. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"The food here is okay. They offer Fresh sashimi portions but not much variety in terms of dishes compared to other AYCE sushi places. They will charge $6.99 for each infant whether they eat or not."}
{"text":"PROS:
1. The ambiance is warm and I enjoyed the high ceilings, chairs (surprisingly very mid-centry like) and plates/dishes/cups they provide. Everything in terms of decor is quite cohesive,  compared to other all-you-can-eat places I've been to. 

2. Presentation of food is nice. For example, the beef tataki is presented consistently on the same type of plate and decor. Whereas at other AYCE, I've often seen beef tataki come out on different plates, sometimes presented flat or even in a bowl as a clump. I appreciate the consistency. It is more appetizing and shows the chefs care. 

3. The sushi is good. The pieces are not too big. The cooked items (udon soup, tempura) were great. Nice variety of desserts (mango pudding, ice creams, fried banana). 

4. Service is very fast. They clean up dirty dishes quickly. 

5. Clean. 

CONS:
1. A bit expensive but considering there are very few options in Stouffville, it makes sense economically. 

2. Would have liked to have seen mochi or black sesame ice cream on the dessert menu. 

Overall, it's a pretty solid All-you-can-eat resto. I would recommend and go back."}
{"text":"I tried this sushi place for the first time last night for dinner. Loved it.

Their coconut shrimp and spicy salmon rolls are my favourites. Food is very fresh and reasonably priced. $30 for dinner. 

Love the iPad concept."}
{"text":"Not the best sushi I have had but decent enough

There are no sushi places on Stouffville so getting sushi is a bit of a venture to where I live

Have had their sushi only in take out

Haven't had the dine-in experience yet

From what I have tasted it does the job but not comparable to other places like Ten-Ichi or Matsuda"}
{"text":"Not too bad in terms of service and food. They have an AYCE by ordering with their provided tablets. However, it is very busy on weekends. Their main entrance waiting area is small that you'll get that cramped feeling. Overall the entire restaurant isn't that big. I still prefer the competition Senjyu just further east on the north side of Main Street."}
{"text":"Have been here quite a few times for takeout, but this was our first time actually dining in.  Came in on a Sunday early afternoon and were seated right away.  AYCE $15 for adults and $8 for kids.  I usually cringe at AYCE since I never eat enough to get my money's worth, but thought hey - why not..

The food - some ok, some meh.  The maki rolls were chewy and not very uniformly round (kinda of lumpy shaped).  The spring rolls were good but tiny, and they stole away the plum sauce before we were done with it.  Edamame good, teriyaki chicken good.  Very surprising that certain rolls weren't available at lunch: most other places would offer all their maki (eg. soft shelled crab) at lunch and maybe just withhold the sashimi, but here only the plain rolls (eg. California rolls) were available in the lunch menu.  For $15 I'd expect more..

The service - not much good to say here.  They forgot items we ordered, like my miso soup, even though they were checked off on an order sheet.  The initial items we ordered came relatively quickly but to order more we had to flag down staff (they not once came by to check how things were, though were quick to take away plates we weren't necessarily done with) to order again, and that subsequent order took forever.  And when it came to dessert, the ice cream came after about 10 minutes but the fried banana we ordered along with it, which we thought they'd forgotten, was delivered *after* we'd paid and were already putting on our coats.  It felt like they were understaffed both in the kitchen and in the dining room - which shouldn't be the case for an establishment open for this long, which should have a feel for how busy they will be on any given day.

Overall, it was meh.. Not terrible, but most places I've been to have been better.  Their takeout (also slightly pricey, but then again there's not much competition in Stouffville) is decent since you avoid their service issues, but for sit-down, I will probably opt to go to Markham next time.."}
{"text":"I have been to this Restaurant over 10 times.  They may hate me here because I overeat and am very gluttonous (had to google that one) when it comes to AYCE Japanese cuisine.  I like that feeling of being so full that I don't have that craving for atleast another month.

Have had most on the menu.  I have not had a bad dish here.  My go to dishes are salmon sashimi, salmon sushi pizza, spicy salmon sushi, baby mushroom beef rolls and beef ribs.  They have a lot of unique takes on different sushi combos, so you picky sushi eaters out there are bound to find something.  

For those that dislike the raw or aren't the openminded type, there are plenty of cooked food here for you ie.  chicken terriyaki, beef terriyaki, noodles, rice, salad etc.   

As of late, the chefs have made fancy designs on their plates.  Service is okay.  Prices are pretty standard for the ayce.  The decor/setting is probably one of the best you can get from an ayce place.  I haven't tried the non ayce here, because I like the ayce and am a gluttonous pig! 

Will keep coming here until there's another challenger in York Region.  I have tried many of the one's in Markham ala Sushi on 7 (terrible service, okay food), Yang's Kitchen (dirty chefs) and Fushimi's (no complaint's - but food flavoring is not up to Maki Zushi's).  Do message me if you think there's better ayce in York Region, because I would be surprised."}
{"text":"Very good sushi all you can eat option in stoufville. It Was around $28 per person plus tax for dinner. Lots of great choices very fresh and tasty sushi and nice clean place good service.  Lots of great options to choose from."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 3, and decided to try their AYCE. The restaurant itself is quite spacious, bright and modern. It was quite a busy night on a Saturday, we waited for maybe 20mins or so for a table.  We were seated at a triangular table that was quite large for 3 but it was great size for our massive orders ;P

They use ipads as order menus, and each table has a slot on the side of the table to place the iPad after use. 

Our favourite items on the list was their torched sushi. It was a pretty presentation and the flavour of each was great. I also liked their fried chicken wings. Really crispy exterior and moist interior. 

Overall the food and service was great. Would come back to try it again."}
{"text":"\"Not nearly as bad as the reviews sad, actually fairly good.\"

I read a lot of negative reviews about this place. I'll admit, especially since they're in my backyard and the fact that they charge a premium price ($25 or more for an AYCE dinner).

Having been to many all you can eat sushi places in Toronto, I had never tried this place because I've been burned a lot of times at bad places and paying too much. I just want to say, this wasn't bad. Actually quite good.

Atmosphere:

Very nice, modern, and they use ipads for ordering which is very efficient. The atmosphere actually makes you forget you're in Stouffville and makes it feel like one of the other more dense places like Woodbridge, Markham, maybe North York.

Staff:

Unlike many experience, the staff was VERY friendly, and seem to have gotten the hint about customer service and were over multiple times to refill water, tea, and check on general satisfaction with food and service so far.

Food:

Good selection. Not the largest I've seen, but with the ipad ordering system, its very easy and almost standard like all places. Having said that, I'd order some of the chefs special rolls, they were all put together well. The beef dishes were all good and sashimi tasted very fresh. Stay away from the coconut shrimp, such a gooey texture, and doesn't taste like that deep friend texture you're probably expecting. 

Price

Again it was about $25 + taxes for an AYCE adult dinner. but unlike most places, they didn't include a 10% service charge and that was kind of them. 

Give this place a chance. If you're looking for sushi in an AYCE environment, this is a place you can consider if you're in the area without risk.

{"text":"A decent AYCE sushi spot in Stouffville. Came here on a Thursday night and it was absolutely packed. We didn't have a reservation and ended up waiting about 15 minutes for a table (which wasn't bad at all).

Orders are done on an iPad which is nice. Ambiance is good. Spacious, decor is pleasant, and generally a pleasant atmosphere. It was very loud though, probably because it was so busy. Service was quite slow, but the servers kept checking in to see which orders we were missing, which I appreciated. 

Most of the food tastes good, and the presentation is very nice. The cut on the salmon sashimi was very thick though, and I think the quality of the fish wasn't that great that day. They have a good variety of desserts, and the beauty of AYCE means you can try all of them!

It's a bit expensive, but there aren't many other sushi options in Stouffville, so it makes sense. Would probably return again."}
{"text":"It was OK... definitely wasn`t impressed, food was ok as was service."}
{"text":"$130 for a family of 4 
FYI - their kids age range stops at 9 so if your kid(s) are older, expect to pay adult price ($27.99 on a weekend) for dinner
You can get AYCE or a la carte

AYCE 
- ordering is done on a ipad which is the best
- food comes relatively quickly
- the rolls look fantastic but are surprisingly bland
- kalbi is really good
- katsu was good enough to warrant a second order
- curry and rice was flavourful, coconut curry sauce, tender chicken pieces
- tempura was light and crispy
- popcorn chicken was okay, the batter didn't have a lot of taste

The decor is nice and bright, clean.

I gave them a 2 because I've had better in terms of taste and variety for a lot less."}
{"text":"I've probably been spoiled with really good sushi, coming from Toronto and having globe trotted in Japan and coasted along the West Coast.  Putting that aside, I went into Maki with absolutely no expectations.  

I've tried both AYCE lunch and dinner.  The downside to lunch is that there is no sashimi and there's less variety in general but obviously it's a couple dollars cheaper.  Dinner, you do have sashimi as well are more variety on cooked dishes as well.  

I'd almost like to say that their cooked variety is WAY better than their sushi and sashimi.  Their sushi and sashimi are a huge disappointment and their fish is essentially tasteless.  One one occasion, their nigiri was filled with rice that had way too much rice vinegar.  

Their cooked dishes are pretty good but would I go to an AYCE just for that? Probably not.  Overall, I wasn't entirely impressed by this place but I probably would come back if there was a world abomination on sushi and this was the only place left."}
{"text":"Low grade sushi not at all worth it. Selection is weak and always freezing cold in there."}
{"text":"Not the first time visit maki sushi, but I am sure will be the last!  Not too many choice in a small town especially Asian cuisine.  
Unpleasant experience tonight
The server took away my bento box b4 I'm done.  It's ok since the food was worst than last time.  
Charging after tax 15% service charge which I didn't noticed!!  Pay additional tips by mistake!  Hope they can do better for the town!"}
{"text":"Amazing sushi, the seared stuff was very very top notch and the price was consistent with other AYCE sushi joints around. 
The staff was very very friendly and just awesome, never rude or anything.
The decor is lovely and the music was ambient and pleasant and quiet enough for pleasant conversation. 
Absolutely none of the fresh sashimi tasted like freezer fish (if you have lots of raw fish you know the taste) and the white tuna was to die for. So silky smooth and savory.
An amazing meal and money well spent, if in Stouffville again will ABSOLUTELY return. 
Very very good work guys."}
{"text":"This is our family's go-to sushi place. We love the cheese dumplings and they treat our toddler like a king. He eats 10 pieces of Salmon sashimi and a milk. Staff bring him out the sashimi in a timely manor, and talk to him about how he likes his food. It really makes our experience lovely.  


As with most all you can eat sushi places, they do forget to deliver some items when you order a heap load of food at one time. We will still come back despite a few hiccups here and there"}
{"text":"Food has to be really good this is why I continue coming here but if it wasn't for that the customer service is horrible. The servers here are very rude and you can tell they don't care about their jobs or try what so ever to make he customers happy. They don't ask how are you or anything just complete silence. There is one man who works here and is the only server there, he usually seats people walks around and does nothing, he is very rude makes no conversation ever and once I had asked him to get the servers to come sing my mom happy birthday he said okay no problem. 30 minutes later They gave us the bill we finished paying and we ended up leaving and no one came by to sing for us. Very disappointed in this place when it comes to customer service."}
{"text":"This place wouldn't be my first option for AYCE, but it's still a option. They have a lot of potential, great environment/seating. Big fan of the iPad ordering. One complaint, constantly feel like your being watched or tabbed with the amount of food you order. I get it if you order a lot of food and don't eat it, but if I'm eating everything I order it shouldn't be a problem to place orders more than a couple times. I get how it works gotta flip as many tables as you can but if I'm paying about 30$ ech I don't want to feel rushed or tabbed I like to sit and enjoy my food with company. 

Big fan of they're chicken fried rice (to die for). Roll options are decently good, not a big fan of they're sashimi or salmon products. 

Deserts options okay, but frozen grapes so hard that you could break a tooth...so FYI. 
Service is good can't complain about that, they're fast but almost to fast. 

Other than all that, this place is not on the \"No\" list, it's on the \"Ok\" place for AYCE.

{"text":"Sushi is always hit and miss and unfortunately this place was a miss for me. We didn't go with the AYCE deal but ordered a dragon roll and some sashimi  sides. The dragon roll was ok, its something that you can't really mess up, and we were not impressed with the sashimi, it lacked freshness and the tuna had a 'fishy' scent to it, which was not a good sign. I think if you do live in this area, it's better to drive to Markham where you find several very sushi places."}
{"text":"It's a good AYCE sushi place. The food and customer service is also pretty good. The prices are  a bit expensive during dinner especially on weekends (expect to pay around $30 per person). Also, I wish they had more of a variety for their dessert menu. They only add 1-2 extra things between the lunch and dinner dessert menus."}
{"text":"Service was fast (orders taken from a tablet), and it's in Stouffville - bonus marks that I don't need to drive to Markham! Quality of food was ok (your typical AYCE) and the pricing is a bit on the higher side, but that's expected.  Would I return? Meh, maybe I'll drive down to Markham for a la carte sushi - at least I'll get good quality!"}
{"text":"Why am I eating Sushi in Stouffville?? I think I really need professional help with my sushi eating cravings as I should have totally skip Maki Zushi and went to have Fish and Chips next door! 
 
I should have turned around when the waitress ask if I am doing AYCE ($13.99) or from the menu... I don't really do AYCE so regular it is. I frantically searched for their lunch specials that was hidden somewhere...

Sushi Lunch Special $7.95
- Shari Rice? What Shari Rice? It is like a normal under cooked rice ball... really hard, really chewy without any flavours
- fish was not fresh aside from the two thinly sliced salomon
- Lukewarm Miso Soup was flavoured with mega MSG... I am still thirsty 4 hours after drinking that 
- Salad was drowned in Thousand Island dressing...... poor salad... 

The deco though is nice and bright and I do like how the sunlight was filtering through from the sky light above... The green colour theme is nicely done helped calm me down from yelling these are not SUSHI!!

Free Wifi Hot Spot. is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Four of us went to Maki Zushi last night because our original destination, Senjyu, was closed! Maki was good; we were there at 6:30pm, greeted with a hearty smile and seated immediately. The ordering was all done on an iPad which was convenient. The service was pretty quick despite the restaurant looking full. All of us enjoyed the food including dessert. The lighting and decor was pleasant, the triangle table was a bit small for us but we enjoyed the evening regardless. We will definitely be returning when we need our sushi fix."}

Good for a date, the family or a big group (the can curtain off a corner of the restaurant to accommodate larger groups)."}
{"text":"The only sushi place in Stouffville. If you're willing to make the drive to Markham, you will get better quality for less. 
Not bad but not great"}
{"text":"Tried this place out last week and was pleasantly surprised.  I think it's actually one of the better ACYE sushi places that I've been to.  

Found the sushi to be fresh and reasonably portioned (not a huge ball of rice with a tiny piece of fish).  Cooked food options were pretty good too, especially the black pepper steak.  Noticed there are also a few menu options that are not offered at every AYCE establishment, which was also a bonus (ika/squid and mackerel).  

Price-wise it was a bit steep (~$21 for dinner), but not dissimilar from otther AYCE japanese places and I didn't feel like it was a rip-off because quality was decent.

Service was generally quite good although our waitress kept mixing up our orders with the table next door.

All in all I was quite satisfied with my experience there and would likely return with more people in the future."}
