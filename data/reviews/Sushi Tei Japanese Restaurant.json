{"text":"When I found out that Sushi Tei is a Korean-Japanese fusion restaurant, I was immediately skeptical about how much I would enjoy this place. I am a huge fan of Japanese and Korean food individually, but I'm not too fond of is most Korean influenced Japanese food. I'm not saying that all Korean made sushi is terrible, just that most of the time I don't find it as satisfying.  Sushi Tei is very spacious, and I found its decor to be very refreshing. For a Friday night, it was relatively empty. On the bright side, the service ended up being pretty fast, and all our food ended up coming at the same time! They had upbeat and catchy Asian music playing and almost made me feel like I was watching a fashion show. In order to have the true korean japanese fusion experience, we ordered both Japanese and Korean dishes.    Spider Roll ($9.95) -Soft shell crab with flying fish egg and avocado: The rolls were exactly as I invisioned most korean sushi rolls to be. Slightly damper rice that lacks rice vinegar, and a roll composition that is loosly bound. I must admit that in terms of ingredients and rice balance, this was right on. The soft shell crab was crunchy and tasty. A Teriyaki-tasting sauce was drizzled over it, and topped with a salty spice. In my opinion the roll was too salty if you intended on dipping it in soya sauce.     \"Chrashi Sushi\" ($13.95) - Sliced fresh raw fish and seafood over a bed of seasoned rice: I was really attracted to the plating of the Chrashi Sushi. It's so colourful that it makes me happy just looking at it! This is the first place I've been to where they actually put ingredients other than raw fish with the rice. The egg, fish roe, seaweed salad, and crab meat would've been a nice bonus, if it wasn't drench with a excessively salty teriyaki sauce. I'm starting to see a pattern with the Japanese food here. The saltiness didn't make it taste bad, just made me really thirsty afterwards. The sashimi itself was actually quite good. They were thick cut pieces of considerably quality fish. While I normally don't enjoy having white tuna that much, it was not bad here and not frozen like it is at most places. Definitely would've enjoyed this Chrashi more if they toned down on the sodium.   \"Pork Bone Soup\" ($8.95) -Pork neck bone soup with potato: While the description on the menu says it comes with potato, I do not recall having any in my bowl of Pork bone soup. It literally was just pork bone, and soup. The soup came out boiling, so at the beginning I just picked off the meat. The meat was practically falling off the bone and came off effortlessly. I'm not sure if you can tell from the picture, but on top of the pork and in the soup there is a handful of these tiny hollow seeds. I later did a little research and found out they are perilla seeds. They don't really taste like anything, but added a nice crunch.   At the end of the meal, I feel like I needed to drink a galon of water from all the salt. It was a pretty unmemorable experience. Everything was up to standards by the books, but for whatever reason it just didn't cause sparks to fly. I wouldn't go out of my way to seek the food here, but I also wouldn't be against coming back as it does serve up a filling decently priced meal. I still stand by my opinion that however similar Korean sushi may be in substance to Japanese sushi, it is by no means identical."}
{"text":"used to go for lunch in weekday, order my chirashi everytime.... went today and it's completely sucks!!!! the chef changed and everything just not the same.....will not go again in future...."}
{"text":"This restaurant contains the WORST japanese food.  We ordered lobster roll, Sashimi and California roll.   Sashimi are NOT FRESH. They taste HORRIBLE. The sweet shrimp is not clear (which is supposed to be) and it smells reallly fishy   I tried the salmon, because you really can't go wrong with that alone. It tastes so bad to the point, the salmon in H mart taste a lot better than these  The only thing that taste alright is California roll, because there are no raw sashimi inside."}
{"text":"Had dinner at sushi tei. They serve Japanese food and also korean food. The restaurant has nice decor and service was good. I ordered the chirashi sushi which is raw fish with a bed of rice. Fish was very fresh. My friend order the bento box which has chicken teriyaki/ tempura/salad/sushi/miso soup and everything tasted good. A great place for a date."}
{"text":"Service has gone downhill, too many tables not enough staff. It's a painful to order, painful to leave kind of experience. Only reason is that we've dined a couple times here and it was okay.   With the 1000s of Japanese restaurants in the GTA I wonder why I bother."}
{"text":"I have never made an uglier face trying to eat anything in my life.  After coming back to Toronto from a weekend long of soul trenching work out of town, I developed a craving for sushi.  But I was at a dinner party earlier, so I this didn't end up being a $70+ take-out type of deal.  I parked in the lot of this plaza, trying to decide between Popeyes Chicken to my left, or take a chance with Sushi Tei on my right.  For the sakes of my cholesterol, and the fitness test I got coming up in three days, I chose sushi.  I walked in, asked for the menu, and was offered tea while I browsed at the selection.  The restaurant was nearly empty, with about 4-5 tables occupied.  It felt rather spacious for such a..un-spacious place. I ordered the Green Dragon Rolls, and the spicy tuna. No drop ceiling, good. Effort went into the decor, good. Sushi clearly can be seen made fresh, good. Cute waitress, good.  I Looked around, and saw the girl sitting behind my table was Japanese. I could tell she was Japanese because she was dressed as if she never left Japan.  Ridiculous hair, make-up and outfit, which could only be described as upper class raver.  I was appalled, and aroused at the same time.  I tried not to stare, but what I did was continued staring.    The sushi took eight minutes, and it looked nice. The spicy tuna was very good, the green dragon...was effing huge. I was on the verge of dislocating my jaw each time I tried to put a piece of that sushi in my mouth.  Literally I could not place it in.  The avocado came off, or the roe fell with the hole into attached to my face and into my stomach was too small.  This has never happened before, and with each attempt, I made what must of been the most horrendous face.  Rendering the people round me in complete shock.  I felt as if this dining experience could be matched with a dubstep song if ever it were filmed and shown.  Yeah, the faces I was making would have been perfect for a dubstep video.  Bill came to $30+, I paid and left completely embarrassed. Never have I opened my mouth wider for anything."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials at reasonable prices (i.e.: Chicken Teriyaki Bento Lunch for $7.95).  Clean and comfortable environment with well mannered staff."}
{"text":"Went to Sushi Tei last night with a couple of friends.  Decor was pretty nice, i liked the idea of projecting video on glass.  We ordered the Hotate Skewers (Scallop) with grilled veggies which was about $8.50, a bit over priced, Green Dragon Roll, and Chirashi Meal which was about $13.95  I wasn't very happy with the Hotate Skewers to be honest, the scallops were small and taste wise, i've had much better ones. The sauce was a bit overdone, it was a bit crispy like tempura but  it was too much batter and flour....I saw white powdery parts in the skewer as well which was strange...i am guessing its part of the excess flour or batter they used...  The Green Dragon roll was pretty good and delicious, i liked the way they decorated the green dragon roll too, they made the avocado really like green dragon scales, which was something I dont normally see.  Their sushi fish was better though, as their were somewhat fresh, it was pretty decent, but for the price and portions, it is a bit overpriced for sure.   Maybe I just didn't get their better items, i might give it another try and see."}
{"text":"The Mississauga location is much better. I always travelled from Richmond Hill to Misissauga for their food, so when I found out this lcoation was open, I was excited.   But when I first went to this location, I was a bit disappointed. The food wasn't as great as their other location, but it was okay. I highly recommened trying out the sushi pizza. It's great.   I do love the how Sushi Tei gives on-the-house dishes to your table at random. It's a great way to try new food and they are very nice there."}
{"text":"Nice decorations however overall, Not too impressive...  Service is good... Their staff are friendly and helpful in finding menu items.  The yelp pic of the crispy salmon dynamite roll us no longer on their menu.  We ordered: Tei roll - not bad, cannot taste the fried lobster, but I could taste their fake crab meat.  Salmon teriyaki was dry Spicy salmon roll was good. Bubble tea was bad... Don't know why I ordered it"}
{"text":"I happened to be around the neighbour last week and was looking for a place to have lunch on my own.  I was planning to go for wonton but that place was closed on Wednesday so I drove around and saw Sushi Tei.  I order gamjatang (pork bone soup) which is the lunch special for only $6.95.  Three free appetizers were served before the soup arrived.  The soup was surprisingly great and I loved it.  Also, service was friendly and promptly.  The only thing was they used lettuce instead of cabbage and there was only one tiny piece of potato in the soup.  I would come back again if I am around the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere but too pricey for Sushi that isn't authentic. Apparently this place is Korean. I ordered a Benton box which is ridiculously priced at just under $20. The food is good but not worth the price when I can go across the street to my Sushi and have all you can eat for the same price."}
{"text":"The truth is Japanese/Korean restaurants are a dime a dozen in R. Hill.  This one is different - in a good way!  I've been there three times since they opened.  Every time I've been impressed with the quality of the food, service and the decor ain't too shabby.  I've tried a bunch of their special maki rolls, sashimi, their Kalbi Dinner and their chirashi meal set.   -The rolls are fantastic.  Not too much rice and and toppings are always fresh.  I enjoyed their Spider Roll recently and didn't find it too greasy as I have at other places -Sashimi.  Nice big pieces and fresh.  Very good -Kalbi.  This was excellent.  They don't cut the kabli for you, so it comes with the big wide bone with the meat attached.  It was very tender and super tasty.  Not too salty. -Chirasi.  Very good as well.  Good selection of fish, all fresh and reasonably sized.  Rice was tasty.  All food comes with Korean snacks and half an orange.   It's not cheap, but I find it worth the premium.  It's also a very comfortable with a light, open decor, including these two plexiglass panels which showed scenes from Japan or Korea on my last visit.    All in all, thumbs up!"}
{"text":"It is sad to see a once favourite Japanese restaurant of mine go downhill.  The original Sushi Tei, a staple and icon for delicious Japanese/Korean food in Mississauga was the parent of this location.  I was excited when this Sushi Tei in Richmond Hill first opened 2 years ago.  They make the best spicy salmon roll bar none that no one else can seem to replicate.   It is now 2 years later and I have learned that this offshoot location was sold about 6 months ago to a new owner, cutting all ties to its original master location, albeit still retaining the name, if only in spirit and not as a whole. To further distance itself from its original location, this Sushi Tei has added a 7 to their name to be known as Sushi Tei 7. Not exactly a dramatic change, is it.  I've been here a few or so odd times here and there ever since it's opened, especially before the handover when things were still good.  The hostess usually greeted you with a hearty hello whenever patrons entered the door, there would be at least 2-3 wait staff working to tend to the tables. Food would arrive fresh and appetizing to your table. You didn't have to ask for napkins, utensils, soy sauce - you know, the basics that makes a restaurant!  After the handover, that's when things started to go wrong. I remember no longer was there a friendly greeting, but there would be only one staff member doubling as host and waitress for a large restaurant, especially during lunch time. It takes more than 5 minutes to put in your order after being seated down, that is, if you can get your waitress' attention. Chances are, she's too busy cleaning up the tables, or in the kitchen putting together a takeout order, or nowhere to be seen!   Today was no different as I arrived for a late lunch.   There was only one other table of three in the entire restaurant upon my arrival. I made up my mind within 30 seconds of looking at the menu of what I wanted. Yet, it took 5 minutes for the waitress that seated me to come back to take my order.  She spoke so softly I could barely hear her, she didn't seem like she wanted to be there. Japanese establishments, even if it's Korean owned and run would at least make you feel welcome with their heartwarming hospitality. Not today it seems. For comparison, the original Mississauga location made you feel welcomed and at home.  Note that every item on the menu has increased in price by $1 to $2. My usual beloved spicy salmon roll is now $5.50 as opposed to being $4.50 in years prior. Today I went with the chirashi. Simple enough, right? Assorted fresh sashimi on a bed of seasoned rice.   Nope, not today. Today's chirashi is made up of a side of rice, with two pieces of sweet tofu, 2 pieces of egg, drenched in teriyaki sauce clumped in the middle. The other side, 3 kinds of sashimi. Tuna, white Tuna, and salmon. Uh, this is hardly assorted. What have I done to deserve such mediocre presentation and limited assortment? To add insult to injury, the fish looked hardly fresh, so bad was the red tuna actually tasted dry and cold to the touch. The white tuna was flavorless, felt like it was recently thawed as there were freezer burn on the edges. Salmon was cold and thick to bite into. The food was bland overall due to the lack of quality in the ingredients, sushi never tasted so bad until today.  All this for $15.   Not worth it at all. I usually frequent Gal's Sushi at Warden and highway 7 for lunch - now they do a magnificent chirashi with all the toppings. But that is another review altogether...  Now, to get the bill for this visit. Not once did she come by to check on things, my tea was not refilled. Through my entire meal there was only 3 tables including mine, or only 6 people in the entire restaurant. Not busy at all, you'd think service would be more attentive. It took a whole 5-7 minutes for the waitress to notice I had stopped eating. And even then, she did not approached my table to offer the bill, or ask if I wanted more tea. It was only when I brought my wallet to the front to pay did she quickly revealed the check. I can't emphasize on how much this waitress today needs to speak up, and to show some life! She was downright looking depressed and quiet, almost like a mute!  I left with a half filled stomach with mediocre dried raw fish, over seasoned rice, and a grieving heart that a restaurant that once bore the name of my favourite childhood place for sushi, has gone to the dumps. To be fair, it's under entirely new management separate from the original Sushi Tei.    Maybe Mississauga's Sushi Tei will take me back with open arms, after all, whenever I've eaten there the owner Charlie regularly comes by my table to make sure everything is doing good and asks about how I'm doing, you know, to make me feel like not just another patron."}
{"text":"ok,  who ever give this place more than a star, have to try a real sushi. first when you go to sushi place, you look at if they have prepared any fish (cut), not just in block of fish and wrap with plastic. that means, they don't have enough customers, so they cut when the customer order. that also means, they'll use the same fish for the next day. you get the picture. second, you taste the rice. there are only a few ingredient to make a good sushi and it wasn't that difficult. but many restaurant manage to blew it. and the last in the ingredient is the seaweed. the rest are the same (mayo, salt, pepper, etc.) looking at those check list item, if any of those failed, if you can bail. bail. unfortunately for me, I sometimes wants to give them the benefit of the doubt and I always end up with very bad dinner. (yea I'm picky, and you should too.) its not like they will give away the food, you have to pay for your food, so you want your food to be good. to test any good sushi place, if they give you the fresh ingredient or not, order spicy scallop hand roll. that will give you the taste on their Rice, their freshness of the food and also if the seaweed is still crispy or not. Sushi Tei, failed to deliver any of these. 1. the seaweed was soggy (means, they expose this to humidity. or were holding or wrapping it too long) 2. the rice were sticky but no flavour (taste like old rice, over cook) 3. the scallop were chewy (scallop supposed to be white, not yellow and it supposed to melt in your mouth, not chewy like rice) all failed, and then I ordered another roll. (did I say I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt, .. yea. no more next time) I don't usually use soy sauce, because good sushi not supposed to dunk your food on the soy sauce. but since this one has no flavor, I asked for low sodium. took them a while to come up with the bottle, but they failed to deliver low sodium. (they said its low sodium) I know its not, because I ate sushi at least 5 times a week, its almost like telling a coffee drinker that this is the same coffee they take yesterday.  so I had a bad dinner :("}
{"text":"Stick with Sushi ... stay away from Soba noodle!!   Specials 2 for 1 for soba/udon noodle soup brought me back to Sushi Tei.. Now I know why it is call Sushi Tei, not Noodle Tei   Seafood Soba ($10.95)/Soba with Shrimp Tempura ($10.95)  - The soup base is quite good... salty with a hint of sweetness... fish flavoured sweetness  - The Seafood Soba has shrimp, mussel, squid and is plentiful  - The Tempura though is a Little disappointing.. they tasted like they were deep fried a while ago... and is a little cold  - Soba does not taste good in noodle soup especially when it was not cooked properly!! The soba tasted a little starchy, soft and soggy...   2 for 1 is good value.. since the meals comes with banchan and salad... but if I paid full price, I would not be happy!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  We have ordered a spicy salmon roll, double crispy roll and the seafood pancake.  The spicy salmon roll was great, they used some special sauce to make it quite tasty, I suspect it is the garlic that they have added.  The crispy roll was great, the tempura shrimp was fried to perfection!  And for the seafood pancake, I have to say it is the best I have ever tried.  It comes in a sizzling hot plate with load of ingredient inside, the side of the pancake is kind of crispy.  It was a bit smaller than the one that you can get from the other korean restaurant, but then the way they made it is way better than the others.  I have to mentioned the service was excellent!!  I def will come back to try the other dishes as well."}
{"text":"If I wanted something special and a bit more exciting, this is where I go.  It just gives me enough happiness for Japanese and Korean food - the rolls are extraordinary, the rice meals so good, the Korean soups completely satisfying.   It would seem that chefs are specially skilled with a good sensibility on food innovation and with utmost refinement and t-l-c (tender loving care, you got that right.)  Their dessert menu is ticklish enough, plus their selection of cocktails and alcoholic beverages.     Service is so gracious.  And the elegant and spacious interior makes it a wonderful dining place for business meetings, girls' night out, and romantic dates.  Been here too many times with my colleagues, close friends, and spent special occasion family dinners and always in good spirits."}
