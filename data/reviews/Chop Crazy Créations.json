{"text":"Soupe asiatique, tout est frais sauf que c'est tellement salé que cest pas mangeable. Selon leur site cest seulement 246mg de sel de qui n'est pas le cas de ma soupe"}
{"text":"Agréablement surprise par le choix et par la rapidité. La formule est simple : tu choisis tes ingrédients, puis tu as le choix de les avoir en salade ou en sandwich. Tu peux aussi avoir un combo avec une soupe ou une boisson.  J'ai bien aimé ma salade gréco-romaine. Un mix entre une salade grecque et une salade césar.  Oh quand l'envie de verdure se fait sentir, ça fait très bien la job !! Le prix est normal comparé aux autres fast-food (environ10$ avec la boisson) Le service est rapide et donc très peu personnalisé, mais on s'y attend.  overall : oui, j'y retournerais."}
{"text":"This place is in Les Halles de la Gare, the little shopping complex that surrounds the VIA Rail Central Station in Montreal (Gare Centrale).  The whole complex is open Monday-Friday, but only a few stores are open on the weekends, so on the weekends your dining options are less.  Chop Crazy Creations is one of those few places that are open on the weekends.  It's essentially fast food salad.  It's similar to places like Freshii and Green Rebel.  They also have sandwiches and soup.  So they have all the ingredients in little compartments, like at Subway Sandwiches, and when you order they assemble your order using these ingredients.  Ingredients are fresh and service is nice and quick.  On my most recent visit, I ordered the Protein Salad combo (which comes with a bottle of water) $10.43.  The Protein Salad contained spinach, broccoli, tomatoes, chicken, bacon, Swiss cheese and sliced almonds.  The chicken was chicken breast, but it tasted processed to me.  The cheese is also processed and to me tasted of the same quality as Cracker Barrel, Black Diamond and Kraft block cheeses.  This is not all that unexpected since it's fast food in a food court.  The salad was huge.  I have a BIG appetite and I was unable to finish it in one sitting.    I always ask for the dressing on the side, since I don't like my salads drenched in dressing.   Overall, it's not bad.  It's a healthy fast food option."}
{"text":"Good salads but ridiculously small portions compared to the price you pay. Competitors such as laitue&go and comptoir du chef in the area offer salads which are as good and clearly more consistent for the same price and less"}
{"text":"Ok- long review ahead for a place that leaves not much to be desired. Not a fan of this place. It's a chain so generally they're supposed to offer what other locations offer (their large salad or small salad, which I usually choose because it's 3/4 lettuce, pretty pricey for a large and I just don't need that much lettuce! So first downside, they only offer the large, or so the man serving me said.  Secondly, I was asking him opinions on the salads and he kept taking the next customer just to not lose any customers which isn't customer service. Him and a woman working there seemed like owners/managers and their energy was very much as if I was a burden, and they looked so exhausted of me after 2 minutes of deciding which salad I was taking. The communication was mute and very easily forgotten.  Lastly, I paid for a \"large\" since they didn't offer a small like all other locations yet they gave me the amount of salad you could pack into a small! Awful portions, very cheap and their 4 small cubes of chicken taste like plastic."}
