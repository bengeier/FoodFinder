{"text":"I will be back every time I am in Vegas...

In town for a business trip and wanted to get away from the strip - looked this place up and headed over on a Saturday night - was not disappointed.

The beer selection was great - lot of new stuff I don't normally have access to (live on the east coast) - the bartenders were great in letting me try somethings before settling in on what I wanted to drink. I also loved that you could create your own tasting flight.

Food was good - I had the cheese curds and a stuffed burger - both were done well and tasty. 

Service was great - both bartenders I had that night were very friendly and quick with service.

Overall, this is the type of bar if I lived near it, I would be there almost weekly - I liked it that much."}
{"text":"If you like beer you'll love Aces and Ales. Over 20 craft beers on tap and a Tuesday special where you can try 6 and a different food each week for $20 was worth it. I had fish and chips with a side of pretzels. The food was great and the presentation is not at all what you'd expect from a bar. The people around me were pleased with their sandwich and nachos too. Misty the bartender was helpful and very friendly. My one complaint would be the prices a little on the high side for me."}
{"text":"Went with a Groupon and this was our first time there.  The waitress/bartender was very friendly and the service was excellent.  They had a huge draft list which my husband loved.  He tried 3 different beers and just loved them.  We also had food.  Arrogant Bastard Chili Cheese Fries, Hamburger with Onion Rings, and Bratwurst with Sauerkraut.  It was all very good.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nice selection of local micro brews. Service and atmosphere was good. Had the BBQ pizza and was very nice."}
{"text":"My husband and I went at lunch time. There was one table that had two ladies at it and that was all. The waitress was not very attentive. We ordered two of the lunch boxes, the food took over 30mins to get. We also ordered fried deviled eggs, which came out right before our food came even though we ordered it before our meal.  I watched the cook make my husbands side salad and saw that he was not wearing gloves when he made it. For as slow as they were the food should not have taken that long to make. We will not be returning to the restaurant."}
{"text":"I come here pretty frequently. This is my favorite bar in town. The waitresses are all super nice and accommodating, and most importantly they know their stuff about what they're serving. And with a rotating draft list there's always great beers to try out. Pricing is very reasonable on the drinks and the food is awesome. (Get the Buffalo Mac and cheese!)
I've never had a bad experience at Aces. Even on the busy festival nights they are very accommodating and on their feet."}
{"text":"The beer is great, the food is spectacular but the service is ATROCIOUS. We have been here on multiple occasions and we love the food and the drinks, but we have been ignored for HOURS AT A TIME. It is hard to return and be loyal to a place when you are constantly ignored. We won't be back."}
{"text":"Aces & Ales is off the beaten path, but is a great place for craft beers.  They have a lot of beers that you can't find anywhere else in town.  The staff is friendly and knowlegeable.   The food is quite tasty as well.  They also host a lot of events where breweries like Stone and Lagunitas come in, take over the taps and have meet and greets with the owners and brewmasters.  It can get a little pricey, but that's the price of good craft beer."}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Like the fact that they change brews, variety is great. The atmosphere is welcoming with a good vibe. Bartenders are very attentive and always help you if you need anything"}
{"text":"Redeemed had a bit of a not so good first visit and then I yelped and then the Boss fixed what was wrong and made it 100% right!!! That's how it's done !
Food /service/perfect!!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place.. they have craft beers on tap that no one else in the state has some times!! We don't live far from here so we go often.. it's the perfect spot to go grab a brew and chill or play pool.. or gamble, lol. They also host diff events featuring diff breweries. This place is just amazing.. their mac n chz is to die for!! All the bar staff is very knowledgable as well. Stone denomination which they just hosted was fantastic!!"}
{"text":"Craft beer selection is second to none here in Las Vegas.  Keep a look out for there festivels and events.  Great barteners that a very up on the beers they have on tap."}
{"text":"Limited ambience aside, the best hot wings that I have had in a long time and I am at least a bit of a connoisseur.   Not overly hot as the heat is not what draws me.   But large, crispy, super meaty with regular heat on the sauce.  Served with carrots and celery.   Not the biggest number but definitely each one is maybe twice the size of many places wings.   A plus."}
{"text":"Holy crap!!!!  What an amazing experience!  Jennilee is the Bomb!!  She was incredibly knowledgeable about all the beers being served ( which were some extremely rare and super delicious beers).  Amber was also awesome and super friendly.  The food here is outstanding as well.  I will recommend this place to all my friends and will come here regularly to enjoy the amazing selection of craft beers offered."}
{"text":"Great LOCAL hang-out. No slots, No bling, but a WONDERFUL slice of life in Vegas. Live music was great. The on-tap selection is what you go to this place for.. Fell in love with the beers available. OMG! and the prices for the bar-food was good.. The bartender made us feel like regulars immediatley. I ordered a Dog-fish Ale and it was already tapped out, still he brought me a glass from the bottom of the barrel \"on the house\"--and it was PHENOMENAL! This ain't ritzy Vegas. but its the real deal We are in our 50's and felt perfectly at home in a bar filled with 30 somethings. It was a great find and we will DEFINITELY find out way back.Gotta try the WORST BEER! Freaking AWESOME!!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the beer selection and the food is amazing. One of my favorite places on the East side to eat and drink!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Groupon from Aces and Ales, this was our first time visiting.  It started out okay, we ordered our food and drinks.  There was only one server at 5 pm, which I blame the management . Our food took an hour to get to us, and it was mediocre at best (if cold nachos and grossly overcooked chicken fingers qualifies as mediocre), and over priced.

If you want to watch a certain game, don't come here to watch your favorite team. We got moved to watch a game on a certain TV, and every 10 minutes the TV would turn off and wouldn't  come back on for another 10 minutes.  I asked a server to change the TV, which she told the bartender, who completely ignored her. 

I won't come back here."}
{"text":"I love this bar, they have such a good sour beer selection & on top of that just this weekend we enjoyed Grunion, epic pale ale from Ballast Point... I'm pretty sure they are the only bar in Nevada to have it...
Matt & the crew are do any fantastic job! I tell all my friends to come to this bar if they are looking for a fun night, good margarita pizza and kind beers! 
Cheers to Aces & Ales!"}
{"text":"I dunno, man. Been going here for a few years. It's a laid back spot with plenty of craft beers and killer food. It seems over the last year the food selection has diminished and the service has suffered a little bit. This last Saturday really bummed me out. I had 5 Moscow Mules (at $10 each) in two hours and didn't even get buzzed. I'm not a big drinker, so that amount of alcohol should have done something. After the 3rd drink and not tasting or feeling anything, I asked the waitress if there was alcohol in it, she said that she watched the bartender pour Smirnoff in it. Smirnoff... in a $10 drink... lol Done with this place. So yeah, $60 later, with tip, and I'm stone sober."}
{"text":"Great beer. The worst service ever. Not busy and took a half and hour to get a beer. Will not come back again."}
{"text":"We go to Aces and Ales a few times a month.  The food is fantastic.   The service though can be a little iffy.   So tonight we go to use a groupon that was a gift.   Our \"server\" Jennilee informs us - in the most condescending tone I have EVER heard that we were 7 minutes too late to use the coupon.  Well we had been sitting at the table and she had ignored us while flirting with some guy at the bar.    She then informs us that she saw us walk in and it didn't matter we were too late and the \"system\" wouldn't allow the sale.   Well our money spends just as well in a different establishment.  I was ready to leave.   My partner likes the beer selection and after working all day it was time to eat.   Jennilee then disappears after taking our order.  Never asks if we need anything, if we needed more drinks, are we still breathing.   Now the place was not busy.   There was 1 other table, 3 guys at the bar and a few people playing pool.  Jennilee stood at the bar flipping her hair and flirting with a guy.    Total disappointment.   Utter lack of customer service.   The personality of a dead bird.   It'll be a long looonnnggg time before I consider going back."}
{"text":"Excellent service and amazing food. I tried the lucifer burger and it couldn't have been any better. Perfect amount of spice, extremely juicy and out right delicious! I will be back!"}
{"text":"I went out of my way to stop by A&A on a business trip at the LV Convention Center, which was probably a mistake because I din't want to leave.  The brew selection is so vast, that if you can't find a brew you like, you should probably go-home and re evaluate your priorities.  I had the special that night which was a pork something or other that was insanely good, but I don't quite remember it's name because, ale.  

I usually remember these things.  

Ok, the brews (had a sampler - wow!) and food are really good here - not your usual bar-food tripe.  Someone here is passionate about quality brewing and food.

There's plenty of TVs and lots of music and good vibes from the patrons and employees.  When he could - the bartender asked me thoughtful questions when I asked for recommendations and took the time to speak with those who expressed interest in his offerings.  He even had some stories to go with the different brews which added context to the session. Pretty cool. I was flying (or floating) solo, and ended-up sitting away from the bar and at a table with a small group of friendly locals who are also passionate about this place.  

Business trips can be very impersonal experiences - so this was a nice break-away.

I'm going to return and maybe keep notes next time because I sure as hell am going to come thirsty and hungry.

I suggest going with the flow and have the specials offered because that is where the cooks passion is directed at that point in time.

note:  They have a better than average whiskey selection here as well - maybe I don't rememeber everything because, whiskey.


Cheers!"}
{"text":"The worst bar ever! The bartenders fucking suck! They take 30mins to take one drink order! I will never come here again!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a horror of house. I even thought on giving it a little bit of credit for the good selection of beer, but it's not even worth it. I'll save your f**king day, get some beer at the store and you'll be happier than coming here. We came here and sit for good 15 mins and the staff were passing next to us and giving us shitty looks. We decided to move to the bar to get faster service. Wrong thought. Not only took 30 mins to get our food, it was completely wrong and disgusting. The waitress didn't bother to take the order, she just \"memorized\" and of course it was F**king wrong. We order well done burger and she brought \"medium\" (almost raw) meat. And when we ordered to get it as we asked, we got the same shitty burger!! Literally w the same bite! Just burned and oily. Probably w a spit on it too. Fries burned and nachos swimming in oil."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place.  Everyone else loves this place.  But I don't.

I must be an oddball.

Anyway, I actually like the atmosphere here.  I like that it's dark and kind of divey with plenty of seats either at the bar or at the tables.  I like the super friendly servers.

I've visited a couple times and although the menu rotates, it seems to be heavy on (very) dark beers.  It's the summer and it's hella hot outside- can I get something a little lighter?  Plus, the prices seem a bit high to me.

As for the food, they have a decent selection for a bar and I'm impressed at the number of vegetarian options they have.  I've had the parmesan fries, fried cheese curds, and veggie pizza.  The parmesan fries are really good and the portion is large.  I have a mad crush on the cheese curds and like that they come with three different sauces depending on your mood.  I would come back to Aces and Ales for the cheese curds alone.

I was completely unimpressed with the veggie pizza though.  The dough was raw in the middle, there were too many toppings so it was watery, and the mushrooms were old and funky.  I let my husband eat it.  He's not picky

And just a fair warning not to get here starving.  Our food took forever to come out.

I think I'll give Aces and Ales another go if I'm in the area.  But it's much too far to make a trip when there are plenty of other places closer to me that I know I like.

I can see why there's so much love from people who appreciate beer more than I do.  I'm guessing I'm a dummy that doesn't know any better.  Oh well.

PS- Be prepared to get some odd looks and maybe hear a record scratch if you walk in as a newbie.  There are definitely regulars here that notice new faces."}
{"text":"Me and my buddies come here quite frequently because of the awesome beer selection, but tonight's experience has guaranteed that none of us return. Our server (middle aged lady, with dark wavy hair, servicing the outdoor patio) was absolutely horrendous. She was short and pushy the whole evening. When it came time to split the checks, she had lost track of everyone's receipt. Our group was more than cooperative with her. We helped her assign drinks and remained amicable throughout the process. But our severs attitude was really truly awful. She became frustrated when we notified her that her ring-outs were incorrect. After re-ringing multiple times, she began snatching receipts out of our hands and offering rude comments. Unacceptable. Especially considering how accommodating our group was being. After this continued for some time, she picked up a check to declare \"no tip???\" Looking around to see who had not left her a tip. Under NO circumstances should this ever happen. I've worked in a well established restaurant on the strip for the last 4 years. It was astonishing to me that she would ever confront a customer regarding a tip, especially after such lackluster service. Unfortunately due to this experience, no one in my group will ever be returning."}
{"text":"I. Love. This. Bar!
I come in weekly. Stephanie is amaze-balls! I literally will leave if she's not my server. Make sure to request her, best server hands down! The drinks are always good, beer list can't be beat, and the food is fawesome! 

I do request to bring back the PULLED PORK SLIDERS!!!!! Pretty please?!"}
{"text":"On 11/29/15 I ordered a juicy Lucy for pick up..I ordered it well done. I got home only to find it was more medium than well done and ended up throwing it out. I unfortunately live 2 far 2 go back that night but since I work around the corner I called and told someone who picked up the phone what happened only 2 be placed on hold and then he comes back and ask if I wanted 2 order a juicy lucy. At that point I just gave up. Fries were good though"}
{"text":"Great craft beers the food is good best wings in my opinion in this city. The habbenero wings are amazing. Great place to go chill and have some good bar food and brews"}
{"text":"Great beer, Cool Venue, out of the way and divey. Basically everything I was looking for."}
{"text":"Hmm, let's see here... The beer selection is good for Vegas. The first bartender was friendly, but she couldn't tell me much about the rather eclectic draft selection of about 15-20 beers, which is on a chalkboard by name only--you don't know what a SuperBrau Fallen Angel is? Too bad, that's not on the board and the bartender might not know much about it.

Another reviewer mentioned something about a soapy glass. When I read the review I thought \"wtf\". When I got two beers here in soapy glasses I thought \"SERIOUSLY WTF !@#$%?!\" I know it's the desert, but rinsing glasses is neither difficult nor expensive.

Now for the real issue--the prices and service. I ordered a Tenaya Creek Hop Ride, a local IPA which was listed on the chalkboard. It came in a 10oz goblet (for a 'normal' IPA? really?). When I went to pay my tab, they'd charged me $8 for a Moylan's Hopsickle triple IPA, which they didn't even have! My other beer was a trippel, which was $6 for a goblet. I tried to ask the bartender who'd given me the check, but he was so quick to drop my check I couldn't ask and so slow to come back I'd run out of patience. I left no tip for the first time in 5+ years and got the hell out of there. I'd understand a bartender in a hurry on a busy night, but it was 8pm on Monday night and there were maybe 15 people in the whole place for two bartenders.

I understand Las Vegas is less of a beer town even than Salt Lake City, but this place is inexcusable even in Las Vegas. Soapy glasses and incompetent service shouldn't happen anywhere, especially not at a place in BFE across from a trailer park that charges this much. Looks like it's back to drinking beer from bottles in the hotel room for me."}
{"text":"What a surprise!!!! Amazing food and unique choices... I want to meet the chef! The staff was so friendly.... Forgot waiters name, but the gentleman wore thick black glasses.... Thought he was kinda cute too... Anyway.... We ordered the artichoke and a beautiful salad, soup and to die for pizza bread with three dips.... I am a sucker for dips!!! Everything was presented with flair!!!! This is no ordinary pub.... Too bad you can't bring the kids.... Definitely will be back..."}
{"text":"Excellent service the food was great we had the jalapeño popper grilled cheese and the Metallica pizza. They have a huge selection of craft beers being from San Diego and wanting some stone brew this spot had stone beers you can't even find in dago. Over all great place away from the hustle and bustle of the strip."}
{"text":"Sitting in the restaurant a you will wait 30-45 min for an order if the place is empty cannot imagine when this place is full, although 3 times here and it's always sparse. Only recommend coming here on Sunday for 1/2 price growlers and leave. Rest of the place is bottom of the ladder."}
{"text":"One of the few places that has double dead guy ale on tap and nitro beers. Been here a few times and always had awesome service and the food has always been great. Fried cheese curds are amazing."}
{"text":"service is horrible. took our 45 mins to bring our food out and everyone's came at different times and nothing was hot"}
{"text":"If I could give half star ratings, this would get 4 1/2 stars. Not a whole lot to say about this place really. They serve classic bar food, with a few unexpected options (quite a good variety of mac and cheese options). Decided to start with the fried cheese curds, which were bite sized bliss (but c'mon, it's deep fried cheese....whats not to love?). For the starter, decided to go with the Juicy Lucifer, which was a beef and bacon patty stuffed with pepper jack cheese and jalapenos. Now I love spicy food, but this is not for the faint of heart. Thank God I had an ice cold beer to wash it down...which brings me to the best part about this place: their beer selection is INSANE. They have quite an impressive selection, some of which are nitrogen-tapped (which is awesome!). All in all, this place is great and makes me wish I had a place like this within driving distance of where I lived.
PS- Only knock I can give this place is that the onion rings (which were very tasty and battered with Arrogant Bastard beer batter) were greasy as hell. I know onion rings tend to be heavier on the grease, but this was a tad much."}
{"text":"Staff is friendly but the food is bland with no flavor. Pulled pork is dry no sauce. Chicken tenders you get 3 for 9 bucks. Go for beer not the food"}
{"text":"This place rocks! Absolute beervana! A must stop when in Vegas, great food and service too..."}
{"text":"My friend and I arrived later than everyone else on a Friday night. Right when we arrived our friends warned us to order ASAP because the waitress (krystal) was slow and they were all still waiting on there beers. I looked around and there's were empty tables everywhere so I'm not sure why it was slow. The waitress took my order once someone caught her attention to let her know new guests had arrived. I started off with an order of chicken fingers and a number 3 beer. (You have to order the beers by number not name) another sir at our table had also ordered a beer. After 20 minutes of waiting for my chicken fingers I noticed another waiter take them to the wrong table and talk to the chef then after another five minutes they came to me. 

Food was average and over priced. The chicken tenders looked overlooked and they were. I had to dip them in ranch constantly to get some type of moisture. And for $9 I would hope to get some fries with the tenders at least but nope just 4 average size tenders. 

Another one of our friends arrived a little later due to work and when we told the waiter if she can take his order she (very sarcastically) said \"wow! Another person, this is so great\" and took his order and walked away without a smile or asking if everyone was doing alright. Once everyone started to leave we were getting our checks and a few people had left already and one of our friends left without ever receiving his beer but I let him have mine since I had water. The waitress tried leaving his check with us and I reminded her he never got his, she tried arguing saying he did but there were no cups near where he was sitting, she rolled her eyes and walked away without saying anything and didn't give me my full amount of change. 

Usually I would understand if a waitress is busy with tables and trying to make an effort to please the tables but this waitress seemed like she was ready to get us all out of there and get her money. Not going back!"}
{"text":"Great service, prompt food! We had the jucy lucy burger, onion rings and the cajun mac n chesse. EVERYTHING was amazing. Lots of different beers and cocktails. Went in on a satuday for lunch. James was great! Defiantly taking people back here!!!"}
{"text":"Service can be very slow at times, but the excellent beer selection and good food make up for that.  Don't be afraid to go direct to the bar if you need another pint!  Highly recommend the steak burrito or wings!"}
{"text":"The food and service here are mediocre at best (the mac n cheese is pretty good but the rest is nothing to swoon over). The beers are good (particularly since most bars in Vegas have subpar beer at best), but overpriced. They are clearly trying to stand out as a kind of gourmet pub... in a part of town that is far from gourmet (try \"seedy\" and \"sketchy\"). The food and drink here are worth the price you pay total for a Groupon - not the amount on the menus. 

Although the actual food and drinks aren't terrible, the management is awful. If you have a Groupon - BEWARE, particularly if you live across town. They will deny your Groupon for \"special events\" that aren't listed on the voucher or in the fine print. So, if you're like me and you traveled to this place to try it out with a Groupon, they may deny it even though it's not written anywhere on the voucher.  

This place may be worth a look if you live nearby, but I don't recommend it to anyone going out of their way."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem. We cautiously approached only to discover a warm hostess and super good food! We got take out and had a glass of wine while we waited.  Very good Cesar salad and prime rib French dip. Would defiantly go back"}
{"text":"If you like \" dogfish head \" you'll love this place ... If you like losing $60 in an hour in the video poker machine & not getting a comp beer, you'll love this place.., if you don't mind being ignored while the bar maid plays on her phone, you'll love this place..,but you should check it out at lest once for yourself.."}
{"text":"My dad and I went over to do Karaoke on Monday night a couple weeks ago... The Karaoke guys were good.. 1 of the bartenders has an AMAZING voice.. The only negative from that night is that the sign said it started at 930... Dad looked it up online it said Karaoke started at 9... Then the reality of it was Karaoke really didn't start until 10...The guy at the table next to us had ordered a pizza and it looked and smelled amazing....

This review is actually about our 2nd visit.. On Friday 2/3/17  my dad got home from work and asked what I wanted to do for dinner.. Then he suggested we go get a pizza at Aces & Ales... I agreed and we were really looking forward to it... We only live up the street so we make the quick drive over there... There are only maybe 5 total people in the bar and it's around 6pm when we get there... Super excited to try the pizza and extra hungry... The bartender is behind the bar.  My dad sits down in a booth and I walk over to the bar and ask if I could grab a menu from her.  She turns to me like I  have completely bothered her... And she says with a really bad attitude (especially for a person in a customer service industry) \"Can I finish what I'm doing first\" ... Both me and my dad work in customer service.. My dad is in sales and I work C/S over the phone... If either of us had spoken to a customer that way there would be a problem.. So I stood there waiting patiently while she did whatever it was that was soooo important behind the bar... (she wasn't interacting with another person IDK what she was doing)  My dad has a real problem when someone is rude to his kids... So he stood up and said he didn't want to stay because of her horrible attitude... I agreed... Which is too bad because we really really wanted to try their pizza.... As we were driving away we talked about it... I said maybe she had a rough lunch shift.. But after thinking about it every time I have been over there (couple times just to play a couple games of pool) the same bartender, short, dark hair, thick black glasses if I had to guess I would say head bartender) she has been there... SO then I think no she probably just started her shift.. with that attitude I definitely feel sorry for the rest of her customers that night... Too many people work in customer service that really shouldn't... I would have to say that she is one of those people... 
We ended up just going right up the street to Sam's town and ate at TGI Fridays... Pizza might have been better but I can tell you with absolute certainty that the service was 200 times better...Jennifer as TGIFridays was super awesome...."}
{"text":"The gal Cristal and the dude with the long Billy goatee, I think his name is Max, rock. These guys know their stuff and have a great bar. I can't say enough about Cristal and her karaoke.  Dont know what they talk about during manager meetings but they got things perfect.  Waker's favorite bar in town!"}
{"text":"Aces & Ales is OK, but just OK.  I came here because I bought a Groupon a while back (oh, the dangers of a credit card & an Internet connection), even though it's quite far from where I live.  I got the Arrogant Bastard steak sandwich, a signature item.  I don't quite get all the hype about the Arrogant Bastard steak.  It has an odd flavor, like a marinade that is intentionally too strong to cover up the flavor of poor-quality beef.  Instead of the standard fries, I got the onion rings, which were by far the best part of the meal.  Mmmm, they were just like great onion rings should be - thick onion slices, crispy batter, and just oily enough to remind you that you really shouldn't be eating these. I also got a Caesars salad, which had nice fresh romaine and a good dressing.  For dessert I had to try their deep-fried oreos, which must be the favorite dessert of trailer parks all across America.  It was a guilty pleasure, good to try once, but I doubt I'll ever have it again.  It comes with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and some really awful hot fudge. It tasted like nothing but Hershey's cocoa, sugar, and water - perhaps the worst hot fudge I've ever had.  Thank goodness I requested the hot fudge on the side so I could just ditch it.

Service was fine, and the atmosphere was typical Nevada-style pub.  I don't understand all the 4- and 5-star reviews of this place.  The food might be a smidge better than your typical locals pub, but that's not really saying much.  If I lived nearby, I'd definitely come back for the onion rings, but that's about all."}
{"text":"I'm odd because I've only ever been here in the late mornings. But I like the food and having a beer sampler to kick off a lazy Saturday. I've also found the staff to be enthusiastic and knowledgeable about their ever-changing selection, which is helpful."}
{"text":"I wasn't very happy with the food delivery I received and the manager went out of his way to send me a $50 gift certificate. I was very pleased to see that my voice mattered and it completely changed my experience. Thank you to Adam Metcalf for being so apologetic and going out of your way to help accommodate. :)"}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying we LOVED this place & we even brought our friends. TODAYhowever changed all of that. Usually we are greeted and the bartender always says HI I am blah blah. Today she was hurried and rude and ID us which is annoying BUT I get it.  I went and got my purse, she says \"oh you came back\". We sat at a table, she asks for my I'D and says ok momma..whoa..im not your mom. I let it slide...she returns about 10 minutes later takes our order brings the drinks..then about 15-20 minutes later returns with most food...then couple minutes later returns with the other food. About 30 minutes later, we are waiting...and I get up wait at three different spots trying to just get the check and boxes to take food to go. A woman says she is super busy today and that guy is sucking up all of her time, I say oh is she new I have never seen her. Apparently she is a night time bartender. AS Jenny gives me boxes I say thiswas the worst service we have ever had here, she replies oh it was bad? Oh well...I work nights this is overwhelming. OH well???? I was born and raised in LV worked customer service and would nevet ever dream of saying OH wELL!! So my husband had purchased a groupon, we go to pay our bill which was 29 and change, she says OH you can't use that with the specials I politely say since when,  and we have several times before, I ask for the manager and she tells me its her, but she will call Jeff....infront of me she laughs as she is on the phone infront of us and other customers and says I know I told her. We end up paying and she said Jeff would be there in 20 minutes, we leave and call in 30 Jenny answers and said Jeff is to busy to talk to me and passed along the message for me saying that is says on groupon they have the right to refuse service...um hello Jenny & Jeff it was NOT about that we were served...even if it was rudely. JENNY also said Jeff would NOT be calling me back anytime soon. LOL Jenny jokes on you and Jeff and the lack of customer service because we all have choices where we go. I also emailed information at aces and ales and no one YET has called or emailed back.  The other 8-10 times we have went was amazing and great food.....so this has changed everything. One bad apple..."}
{"text":"Foods good beer selection is good but the manager on duty made poor decisions by skipping music payed for on the internet jukebox, the music may not fit the bars style but it was payed for and was just for fun. The excuse given was to blame customers at a rival bar down the street playing jokes. Our money was refunded but the reason given and the fact no one complained to our knowledge leaves a bad taste about an otherwise great place."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here so much we have at least 24 of their beer festival glasses. Well ventilated, clean, and I love the staff. The beer festivals are to die for---so many selections and variety. I even came to the stone beer festival and Greg Koch himself was there. If you love microbrew beer, or any beer, this bar is for you!"}
{"text":"Came in with a few buddies to watch Thursday Night Football and got greeted with horrible service! It's a nice place to watch games at with good food but definitely needs to work on better customer service. Will not return."}
{"text":"This is by far one of the best places to drink beer in Las Vegas. Sure, there are large chains that have more beers, but no place else has the constant variety Aces offers. At last count there were over 40 beers to taste. At each visit, the beer list is a drastic departure from your previous visit. They even have tap takeovers where breweries small and large get to showcase their selections. Certain bottles will always be available, but if you're looking for $2 miller lite, this is not the right place. 

Because there are so many options, I suggest a tasting. On Tuesday, there is always a tasting and food special. As far as the tasting, you get 6 of your choice and on Tuesday the bartender throws in one of his favorites gratis. 

As far as the menu, everything we've tried has been excellent from burgers and sandwiches to specialty Mac and Cheese. But the real stars as far as food are the Tuesday specials. They made a lobster bisque in a bread bowl one week that wasn't just good; it was astonishing. 

Lastly, the staff is friendly and engaging. Not sure what beer you want? They'll give you a sip before you commit. Confused what to eat? Tell the waitress or bar tender what you're drinking and they'll give you options for pairing.

My only complaint is that I live across town. But it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"Karaoke & Trivia nights are my main reason for coming back week after week. Bartenders are awesome & drink specials are also great."}
{"text":"This is my favorite craft beer bar in Vegas. Only thing that sucks is the single location theyu have is on the ass-end other side of town for me since I moved, sad Daizee. 
     The taps have about a week long stay here, epic. I understand if you find what you like, you usually try to stick with it, but call me adventurous. I am always game to taste the 31 flavors. In addition to that, they sometimes pick up some extremely rare, or in some cases, \"mistakes\" from notable breweries. If I'm not mistakened, they featured the Lucky Bastard by Stone Brewing Co. I think the bartender mentioned it was made by error whilst doing another one opf their signatures, but they still went with it, and distributed only 60 kegs. A & A picked up 2, and I was extremely fortunate to taste, and buy a growler of the accident child. Dee-lish.
      Only downside is the PA system when they have live entertainment. Too much feedback, and sometimes the people performing, for lack of a better word, suck. Other than that, if you're a beer snob, you gotta come down there. Do a tasting, don't just stick to one. Get it while it's there, cuz they are constantly updating the beer menu. Kinda hard to find, and in a somewhat questionable side of town, but I love good beer and variety. I need to revisit soon. Fun times."}
{"text":"Get the fuck out of here with your poor reviews. Bar none, this is the best bar in town. Incredible beer selection, incredible food, incredible service. Like any new place there's always bugs that need to be worked out but this place doesn't seem to show any signs of struggle. If you want the best beers available with rad staff... This is your spot."}
{"text":"Lots and lots and lots of good beers (50 taps!). Good bar foods. Some dishes are a bit more creative then the normal bar food. I've always had great service at this location!"}
{"text":"I've been to both aces & ales a few times. The one on the westside seems to be well run and we'll staffed. Unfortunately, I've had one OK experience and one bad experience at the location on Nellis. Today it was a bit busy but not overcrowded, there were 2 servers on and they seemed to be sharing the tables. This caused them to approach the same tables multiple times and ignore other tables. We ordered drinks so few and far between that we became bored. The food came out slow and I even had to cancel the dessert because after over an hour and ordering it twice it still hadn't come out. After waiting an hour for my check I ended up approaching the server station to get it. That's when they offered to take the dessert off the check. I had six 4oz beers, two appetizers and the who thing took almost four hours.  The manager witnessed the conversation at the service station and didn't try to resolve our obvious dissatisfaction. Granted we did not ask for him specifically as we just wanted to leave. I really appreciate the beers and festivals that aces and ales have but they really need to work on the servers. Two people at the table next to us had to ask the bartender twice for a server, then the server walked passed us twice to speak with them but never approached us. Next time I go to aces I will definitely be seated at the bar as the bartenders seemed to be a bit more on their game."}
{"text":"Good beer selection, but could use a better location... Gangsta hood scared me do sho..:lOl nah the locale is so so. Good rotating beer list"}
{"text":"So I've passed by this place several times over the year since I have family that just moved to this area in Las Vegas. I've always kind of wanted to know what type of place it was since they have lots of craft beer advertisements on their wall. I went on yelp and was surprised to find so many positive reviews. My husband and I decided to give this place a shot. We came in here on Saturday evening and we were skeptical at first. Wow. This place is definitely a hidden gem. Its very modern and clean inside. The bar tenders and servers are very welcoming and attentive. The burger was delicious and their deep fried oreos were beyond delicious. They have a wide selection of craft beers and lots of TV's to check out games. I don't live in Las Vegas but I will definitely be stopping here every time I come out here to visit my family. I'm still dreaming of their deep fried oreos."}
{"text":"The beer selection is amazing. The staff is very inviting. The food is always great. The moondog grilled cheese is an unexpected yummy combination. 

The one hidden gem with this venue is their outdoor seating area. Love to sit by the outdoor fireplace and enjoy a nice beer."}
{"text":"Drinks are great. Food is subpar. Pizza had a lot of dough and very little topping. Had the ahi tuna sandwich and that had a small piece of ahi and alooooot of bun.  Overall would only come Here for the drinks and maybe even some aps but that's about it"}
{"text":"Great beer selection. AWESOME FOOD!!. The bartender was super cool too. Great place.  If you like trying ew and different kinds of beer this is one of the better places to go"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon for their Winter Beer Fest that had been promoted throughout the valley. Despite all of the promoting they did, it seemed as though we were the only 'Non-Regulars' in attendance. It also seemed as though the 'Regulars' didn't care so much about the Winter Beer Festival. This is more of a Vegas issue than an Aces and Ales issue in my opinion.

The beer selection was pretty awesome, and only cost $4 each after the initial souvenir glass purchase of $15. We shared an order of the Nachos, which was more than enough food.

Beware: The cigarette smoke in this place is pretty overpowering. The bartenders cater to smokers. Smoking isn't technically allowed by law; however the bartenders supply smokers with Altoid Can ashtrays.

Final note: The neighborhood this place is located in leaves something to be desired."}
{"text":"Having an awesome time at Aces watching the super bowl. Beer is great and Jessica has a nice butt!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, a beer enthusiasts must. Matt knows his beers and is super personable. It's  our new favorite."}
{"text":"I went to Aces and Ales because I had a Groupon.  I saw that they had Woodchuck on draft which is my favorite hard cider.  I went in and seated myself, it took a while for the waitress to acknowledge me.  Finally I ordered my drink and she brought it and was gone so fast I didn't even have time to say I was ready to order my food.  Finally after about 10 mins she came back and I ordered an appetizer and main course.  About 20 mins later she brought both at the same time.  I thought an appetizer was suppose to come before the meal.  After I was finished eating I flagged the waitress down and told her I had a Groupon.  She said I couldn't use it because it was for two people.  I pulled up the Groupon which said nothing about being for two people.  So, I flagged her down again and showed it to her, she finally agreed to let me use it but you could tell she wasn't very happy about it.  Throughout my meal I could tell I didn't have the right body parts to get good service.  She was very attentive (if not overly) to the male customers but she barely acknowledged me through my whole meal.  Anytime I wanted something I felt like I had to wave her down.  Also, I noticed three of the waitress' drinking alcohol while they were working.  One drank out of a customer's glass and two others were taking shots offered by male customers.  I find this totally unprofessional and I am surprised management allows this.  I probably will not be going back which is unfortunate because it is so hard to find restaurants who have Woodchuck on draft but I really prefer to be treated better especially if I'm paying money."}
{"text":"I always enjoy this place. Good beer and food. They have an extensive menu, with lots of great choices. I work down the street and sometimes get lunch here, since they have a lunch special. Great place to just chill and watch the game, since they have lots of TVs mounted."}
{"text":"Lots of tvs! (great for sports) drinks are decently priced and its not really smokey so thats always a plus! I tried their shrimp mac and cheese. I would definitely go back for the mac and cheese!"}
{"text":"I am traveling for work to Vegas and my (not so great) hotel is conveniently located across the street from this place. I had such an awesome experience! 

I was by myself so I hoped it wouldn't be weird to be in a bar/ casino but I grabbed a table and was greeted promptly and didn't even need to ask for water before he said he'd be right back with it. 

Menu selection was huge (literally) between the beers and food I couldn't decide what to get. Jessica, my server was attentive with water (huge plus) and checking in on me.  

Apple, bacon grilled cheese and arrogant bastard onion rings were the best I've ever had. Food came fast and it was hot and delicious! 

Thanks every for the great work, this is definitely a place I'd recommend and I'll be back myself in the future."}
{"text":"Came in at 5am on a Thursday from a long drive from San Fran. What could I possibly want? A good cold beer and a good environment before my hotel check in across the street.  I got all I wanted and Bartender James was more than koo. Returned Saturday to kill time and deff a cool chill time. Great Food. Pizza is Good n great value.  I recommend this place Most deff!"}
{"text":"What a hidden jem for beer lovers. If you like craft beer, you've got to check this place out. As an added bonus, Sunday's are $4 any draft beers and 1/2 price growlers!!"}
{"text":"We absolutely loved our experience here. Great service from Kimberly who made us feel right at home and welcomed. Excellent food as well- the chips were fresh made and hot from the fryer  I got the fish tacos that were equally as delicious. The food tasted fresh and was delivered super fast. The the \"Too Good\" burger was \"bomb\" as my boyfriend stated. As I blinked and looked over, the burger was gone. Bye bye burger! It was good knowing you! Our plates were completely empty when we left. Super great beer selection as well. There is a large selection of craft beers that you can't find just anywhere. I recommend the Beachwood IPA for the IPA fans. Lots of fun events that we were informed of as well that we can't wait to attend. So many fun events to come with really great beer, food and fast friendly service. We will be returning."}
{"text":"Being that I live completely on the other side of town, I have only been here for a local home brewers meeting held the second friday of every month called SNAFU.

Now the owner treats the club nice and runs specials for us on their beers, but I have to say, I have tasted some of the finest $5 pints I have ever had at this bar.

Nobody in town has more unique beers, let alone to be sold at that price. This review is based on the beer, but the food always looks and smells delicious, although I usually eat before the meeting so I have not tried it."}
{"text":"1st time here. Very nice decor. Didn't partake in any of the beer tastings. Had the buffalo wings. Wings were decent, a bit small. Fries were awesome. The bartender misty made our night, although we did not win at video poker gambling. We will be back just on the service alone."}
{"text":"Good food, my lady loves the okie dokie artichokie. Great beer list, constantly changing. A nice place to go anytime of day."}
{"text":"Overpriced beer and food,  Main Street Station,  pale ale is just as good as this place, the place was dead when I was there.
And whoever wrote that this is in a bad neighborhood doesn't know what a bad neighborhood looks like. 
Pussy. .."}
{"text":"2nd time back and the service was just as amazing as the first time.  The food is delicious and you can't beat the prices.  I will be back.  The hangover breakfast sandwich and homemade home fries are delicious!  Try the cookie brownie.  Next time, I'm trying the fried Oreos."}
{"text":"Great brew selection. We were there early afternoon, so not many patrons. Ordered fish n chips and beer cheese soup to go. There were 2 small over cooked fillets and lots of fries. Soup was tasty. A bit pricey and not worth it."}
{"text":"Came here to see a friend of mine's band perform a show.  Since the bar is further than 30 minutes from where I live, I doubt that I will be coming here much, but I generally liked what I experienced.

If you're a beer aficionado, then this is the place for you.  It is a dive bar, and it is in a sketchy neighborhood, but that seems to add to its charm for some reason.  For it's wide selection of beers, you will be happy to know that the prices are extremely reasonable.  The smoke isn't overwhelming either, and the place is well-ventilated, so you can actually breathe inside.

My friends ordered nachos, sweet potato fries and jalapeno poppers.  All three were delicious, but I found the most enjoyment from the sweet potato fries.  

The bar was large and roomy, with pool tables and your standard bar games like shuffleboard and Golden Tee (which I am just as bad at as I am actually playing golf).  The only con I can think of is that I didn't think it was a great place for live music.  Stage lighting is kind of bleh, and they have a railing in front of the stage for some reason, so if you're short like me it can block the musicians.  

I will definitely come back whenever I am in the east side of town."}
{"text":"I've been to Aces & Ales several times. Each time I get the bacon & bleu cheese fries. They are a mound of deliciousness with plenty to share. The wurst plate was so good. I love the beer shooters. The food is so fresh and artfully plated, with snazzy dinnerware. This is a surprizing place on the East side that too often goes unnoticed, plus you can play pool and shuffleboard."}
{"text":"Pretty amazing beer selection. Food is good. Our waitress was a bit rude, missing most of the time, and pretentious.  The food and drinks are overpriced, much better places in the area.  Skip it."}
{"text":"Great Beer haven't found anything on the menu that isn't bad yet..But make sure to sit in Nicoles section to get the best experience!!"}
{"text":"I went in with their offer of match play and it said:\" Spend $20.00 and receive $20.00 of match play\".
Batender Bobby helped me The first.login was fine.  Eventually it stopped working. 
Bill Peterson from Gamblers bonus camen out as they were not able to fufill their end of the sgreement. 
He told me call 702-1-800-255-4777
Be wary."}
{"text":"A little overpriced but overall great food and great beers. Most importantly, they have excellent bartenders. The bartender with the crazy Mohawk is possibly the greatest bartender of all time."}
{"text":"Aces n Ales is place where I go occasionally with friends. I came to this location for a groupon that I had recently purchased and wanted to use it. Had a blonde lady take our order on food and got our drinks. While we were eating we noticed that the lady disappeared and never came back to our table. I guess she got off of work, but we never informed of the change of servers, which would have been a nice gesture for a place that isn't really packed much normally. While we were waiting no one came around to check on us at all. We had empty waters and no customer service. This bartender Joe with black spikey hair never checked on us, which really wasn't an uplifting feeling to a place I've brought a lot of business to. I'm pretty sure he was too consumed with talking with his friends who came to visit him at work; instead of tending to other paying customers, who are waiting on customer service and to get a check to pay for their drinks and meals. I won't be recommending people here anymore due to the lack of customer service that was showed at this bar and how unfriendly and unwelcoming we were treated during my time there. Please work on being aware of patrons in your bar and checking up on them."}
{"text":"I'd have to say it's not ok. Been here for 40 minutes at a bar and can't get a server, let alone a beer. I know it's busy, but when the servers only walk 5 feet in the patio, but yet there's 4 other parties that are being ignored. Not good"}
{"text":"Had one good experience and one awful experience. We were in town for Thanksgiving and stopped by early in the morning to try some beer. The guy that was there was about to get off the night shift, but he was very helpful, told us about all the beers available, and about the special beers they were releasing on black friday. Good guy. We decided to come back another night and ordered some beer. Beer didn't come. When asking the girl bartender, who took our order, she blamed the other guy for not bringing the beer and kept saying she wasn't even working right then. Beer still didn't come. When asked again, she once again blamed the other guy for not bringing it yet, and that she would go get it right now. 10 mins later she  finally came whipping around the bar with 2 beers and 3 waters. She then proceeded to spill all but one drink on herself and our feet. Then she disappeared into the kitchen. 10 mins later the cook came out to clean up the mess and also told us the girl bartender was pretty drunk. Sure enough, once she came out of the kitchen, she went back behind the bar and was taking shots. Then she sat down at a table with customers and began smoking. Awesome. I hope she didn't drive home after that evening as she couldn't even walk straight. It took us another 20 mins just to try and pay for the one beer that made it. The girl never talked to us again and the guy didn't seem to worried about taking our money. We should have just walked out. I don't plan on returning to this location ever. I may try the one on Tenaya, as it is supposed to be the \"classier\" location."}
{"text":"A huge selection of some great craft and import beers! One thing I noticed is that the bartenders know which beers to serve in what glasses.  May not seem like a big deal to some people but you would be suprised at what a difference it makes!"}
{"text":"Came to Aces n Ales for their Super Bowl party for the second year in a row. We love this place! We usually have around 30 people coming from California for super bowl weekend, and we leave the strip and all its nonsense to come here. Service is always amazing. They have a great list of craft beers, food that surpasses your typical \" bar food\", and tons of tvs.  This has come to be our favorite spot to watch the game. Thank you Kim, Nicole, Heather, and Ari for an amazing time! See you next year!"}
{"text":"I have never had anything bad here. Food is delicious and made from scratch!!! I always have really good service. Friendly place. The location is kind of hidden but it is a gem! Oh yeah, lots of tasty beer too!"}
{"text":"We came here because we were looking for good craft beer.  Don't let the location fool you. Great food and great beer. We don't give 5 stars very often.  And although they didn't have chilled glasses, she offered without prompting from us!  

Update:  what isn't clear is the great bar tender offered to chill our glasses, even though they don't have chilled glasses immediately available.  This is so cool.  We went into a Well Owned Beer (WOB) place and they didn't offer to chill a glass with their 250 beers.  All we got from the bar tender at WOB was a blank stare after telling us their glasses were not chilled.  Soooo, the fact that Aces and Ales offered to chill the glasses is a big plus. We will be back because of the service, the beer and the food."}
{"text":"Great food, stellar beer selection and really great service. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food....great customer service...plenty of TVs which makes it an idea spot for watching sports...reasonable prices and they offer military discount :-)"}
{"text":"Great selection of beer. Bar food, but not greasy. A very fun atmosphere, and the staff was very nice!"}
{"text":"Wasn't very happy when my brother and I visited last night. Our waitress(didn't catch her name) was slow and inattentive. Took 10/15 min. After sat down for any kind of menu. After messing up our order, and checking on us after 35 mins went by, we waited another 15 for a check. 
Other staff seemed to be on top of things, but she wasnt."}
{"text":"Convinced my friends to drive a bit away from the strip to visit this place and very glad we did.

On tap they had a great list of beer, but the real surprise was their bottle list.  We grabbed a 2010 Bourbon County Stout and an Abyss.  Our server was knowledgeable enough to mention their vintages and even confirm we were okay getting young bottle of the Abyss.  Price-wise everything was pretty moderate, or compared to the beer prices on the strip...much cheap.

We also enjoyed all the food items.  A friend got the seared tuna salad and was pleased with the light sear on the tuna.  Their BBQ burger was excellent as well.  We also got the cheese curds and pretzel bites, I highly highly recommend both.

If you're near the Vegas Strip with a car, its in your best interest to drop by and check this place out."}
{"text":"Craft beer has blown up in the last five years, and I have joined the revolution myself within the last two, so on every new trip I plan out of town, seeking out local craft beer bars and breweries becomes my first priority. On our most recent trip to Vegas, I visited the overpriced Public House on the Strip, The just \"ok\" Triple 7 and Ellis Island brewpubs, the spectacular Tenaya Creek Brewery, and finally this little gem: Aces & Ales.

This bar was about 5 miles from the strip so it seemed each day we never had time to make it out there, so the last night I planned to hit all the local spots we missed throughout the week, that might have been my only regret saving this place till last. We arrived at around 2:40 in the morning, it was the last stop on a whirlwind bar crawl before we flew out that morning. I had a Groupon with me for $30 that only cost me $13 if I used it between midnight and three. I came in the doors thinking one no one would be there, and that the bartender/cooks would be pissed I was coming in with 20 min left to redeem a coupon, but I could not have been more wrong.

The place still had a great local gathering, and our luck Monday night was Karaoke night, its three in the morning and there are still about 10 people waiting to sing Karaoke. We joined in and signed up to sing, then made our way to the bar. I apologized in advance to the bartender and he was like don't worry about it man, I don't get off till 8 in the morning this place is open all night. Talk about culture shock, I can't imagine a place in Charlotte running those kind of hours and still pull a crowd as well.

The bartender Russ talked our faces off for 3am and was cool as hell to boot, he gave us the low down on growler prices, grub deals, and his favorite choices from what was on tap that day. He also told us we just missed a beer festival they had that weekend, another reason to kick myself for not coming here earlier. He also said they go through kegs daily, so each night something new is on tap. We took a couple of his recommendations and were not let down. I added some notes to my phone so I could bookmark my favorites, The Bruery Autume Maple, and Nectar Ales 2011 Black Xantus coffee stout, and then we grabbed a couple appetizers. The Wisconsin fried cheese curds were the best thing I ate the whole week in Vegas. Seriously they are bar food at its FINEST! My wife got the Beer bites, they were like little miniature pizza pockets covered in garlic, served with an amazing beer cheese dip, she loved them as well.

The service of our bartender Russ was above and beyond for a couple of tourists visiting Vegas at 3 in the morning. Tack on the sweet Karaoke system, the most affordable and nicest selection of craft beer I found in Vegas, plus the amazing appetizers, and this place was the highlight of local spots for our entire vacation.  I will definitely be back next time I am in town, and not just once either!"}
{"text":"My wife and I can't say enough about this place.  We had our wedding reception here, and it was perfect.  We're unconventional, and we didn't want a big production, so we booked their private party room based off the excellent reviews they already had on Yelp.  We couldn't be happier with the results.  The manager Jeff Urbanski and his staff were AMAZING!  They were so attentive and genuinely excited to have us there.  (by the way, Jenna you rock!)  The appetizers and food were excellent, well beyond bar food expectations.  Then there's the beer list.  This is the list by which I will measure all other bars.  I know it's not fair, but it'll be my burden to bear.   The list is LEGENDARY! 
We love this bar and wish it wasn't 1800 miles away.  Jeff thank you soooooo much and we will be back as soon as we're in Vegas again!"}
{"text":"Went here Saturday night for the first time. The two bartenders were SO so friendly. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"After going on a hike to red rocks in the northern part of Las Vegas we were all hungry. So when we searched for a brewed near by that had food we headed hear. The selection of brews was nice, we were all able to find something that interested us and that we enjoyed. The selection ranged through about 50 beers on tap and had 2 ciders on tap. The waitress wasn't too knowledgable on the beers but one of bartenders there were. When the keg blew on the first beer that one of us ordered they gave us the half cup of beer and he was able to pick one at no charge. My boyfriend enjoyed that beer so asked her for something similar and she had no idea so had to ask. As we enjoyed our beers we quickly ordered the fried zucchini and onion rings. Both were arrogant bastard ail from stone brewery based battering. These were very good. We proceeded with a much needed lunch and I ordered the arrogant bastard stead wrap. This was delicious. wrapped in a whole wheat tortilla, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, a healthy helping of stead with balsamic vinaigrette, if i wasn't full from the appetizers i would have devoured the whole thing. I would definitely suggest getting this. They also have it in salad and sandwich form if you are not big on wraps."}
{"text":"Went to Las Vegas this past weekend for a concert, all the rooms on the strip were sold out or blacked out. Stayed off the strip at a La Quitna in Summerlin off of a street called Tenaya. Little did I know there was a GEM right across the street from our hotel called Aces and Ales.It was Saturday afternoon and thought lets go get a drink and see what the place is like. WOW that is all I could say my husband and I walked in and right away was greeted by everyone not to many people in the bar sat at the bar gambled a little and got all the drinks that we wanted so fast. I do not remember our bar tenders name but she was AWESOME!!!!! (Makes a GREAT Tanqueray and Tonic). Ended up staying there for about 2 1/2 hours just talking to her and and having a GREAT time. We ended up ordering food and OMG!!!! it was SOOOOO good the chicken strips and fries are AMAZING!!! Next time in Las Vegas I will FOR SURE make a point to stop in and have a another great afternoon."}
{"text":"Food:
Boneless Hot Wings  -  $8.50
Cheeseburger w/fries  -  $10
Ahi Sandwich w/sweet potato fries  -  $12

Wings were laughable. $8.50 for like 7-8 little pieces. 
Burger was large and juicy. Small portion of fries.
Ahi was cooked just right. Pickled ginger added the a great little snap to the sandwich. Really small portion on the sweet potato fries. 

Our server was good. It took a while to get our food, 30-miuntes to get the wings and another 10 to get the rest of it. 

They had a great selection of beer. Seems like it would be a good place for Happy Hour."}
{"text":"The nachos were surprisingly awesome, and I love the beer list. 
There are lots of great beer styles to choose from, many from the west coast. Select any that you'd like to try and they'll do a flight."}
{"text":"Great place for lunch! I had the lunch box special. Burger fries and a Coke for 8 bucks +good old tax. I also tried one of their 50 beers thay had on tap. It was nice  and cool in side with great service. Hands down perfect place for lunch or drinks check them out!!"}
{"text":"Seriously disappointed.  A broken down shell of what it could be.  In desperate need of a visit from Bar Rescue.  Half the taps weren't working, the bottled beer selection had a long list, most of which they had not restocked.  There were 100 pool cues and not one was usable.  Traveled a long way on a recommendation and was sorry we did.  We could have spent $150-200 in here, and cashed out at under $40.  The one bright spot was the service.  She was great.  Everything else was a sad disaster.  Can't speak to the food.  Had planned to order some, and left while we could.  A way better choice would be the Irish pub across from the Orlean's Casino."}
{"text":"Service was great and the food was amazing!!!!!. Had the fries with pull pork which is nothing like I have ever tasted. Then we finished it with an order of fried Oreos with a side of ice cream."}
{"text":"Great Beer selection, Awesome bartenders, great food selection ,, go see Kimmy and the rest of the Great Staff!"}
{"text":"This place is big.  They have a bar side (1-3 people) and a wide table side for parties of 6+, like group eating, and even a large private room for big parties of 34 (needs a $150 deposit)

The food is NOT from a can, and you know you can tell at some places....it is fresh! 
The food is a lil pricey, but I'm sure because of their choices of beers and location...they have to be.  I think Mon-Friday is happy hour, and on football sundays too, so thats the best days to try the food on the cheap side

The waitress I like the most is Jessica... she is not a  cover model with a great butt or knock out boobies (and lets face it thats why guys go back), BUT for me, she is right up there, or in the category of  \"girl next door, with spunk and charisma\", someone who will be comical with ya, work hard for you, and will even check up on ya on a regular basis.

It is my third time there, so I'm not a regular just yet, so I haven't really conquered the whole menu   

House Mac & Cheese - $9.50 ---  i guess im used to like BOXED yellow cheddar cheese from KRAFT, i think they use like a off white, or some other coloring cheese. I added crush red pepper crumbs (for pizza's) to spice it up

Arrogant Beer Battered Onion Rings - $6.50 --- only had it once, but had some grease layer/residue (using the fingers, not a fork).... i think the beer battered rings and BBQ combo sauce just don't work for me and my taste buds

Beer battered fish and chips - $13.00 -- a whole piece of cod (market value) cust in two slices, beer battered and served with chips or fries.   This one, I felt that 2 slices was not enough for $13.00 bucks price tag, I felt jipped 



**Overall, when me and friend go we are looking at $45-$60 for just the two of us.. and that is a lil high for me.  I've been to dive bars that look like crap on the outside, sell food and get enough for LESS, and barely break $20 bucks, and be stuff til midnight or the next day.

Once again, the servers are nice, 
the food (so far) hit and miss, 
and the price is  $$, maybe $$$ in my eyes.  
But, to each his own."}
{"text":"Thank you so much for the amazing service Jena!!!!! Soccer Moms loved spending lunch with you!!!! Lunch and drinks were delicious!!!! Kim was amazing setting us up in the VIP room!!! Will go here every time we come back to Vegas!!!!"}
{"text":"Good late night night munchie spot. Not too far off 95 If you don't live close, take Cheyenne exit west. Late night Mac and BLT are solid eats. Like a lot of local bars can be understaffed quickly if it gets busy....but why are in a hurry at 1am. Sit back enjoy the patio and drink up. Only gripe is late night menu is pretty cheese and starch heavy."}
{"text":"Sunday, fun day! 4 dollars for any beer on tap and fill a growler for half normal price. Also, I hear they opened a new one on the other side of town...I wanna check it out"}
{"text":"This review is on the service, not the food!!! We came in about 7:33 & I understand that this place is a little busy but at the same time our waitress has already taken our drink/food order & we didn't even get our waters til 8:02.. Which is pretty disappointing considering she(waitress) has walked by us multiple times & nothing.. The other location is alot better"}
{"text":"Delicious specialty grilled cheese sandwiches.... I got the Caprese w/ the tomato soup bomb!!! My boyfriend got the Moondog which was a lil spicy along w/Garlic parm fries!!! All together it was great, we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Had a great time, nice little bar on the East side. They have a huge craft beer selection, the bartenders will help you find one you like! Surprisingly the food was great as well, better than normal bar food. (spaghetti pizza and onion rings - YUM)

Best part was the Karaoke! They have Kool Katz karaoke on Monday nights, so fun,  Everyone had a great time."}
{"text":"The absolute best beer bar in Las Vegas. They have the best selection of beer available in any bar. A constantly changing rotation of taps including rare, hard to find beers that no one else has. Greg Koch from Stone brewing has even come by a couple of times celebrating the amount of Stone beers that they sell through.

They host beer festivals throughout the year, which is a great time to try some never before heard of beers and meet a lot of great people in the process. 

A must on any Beer Geeks list."}
{"text":"The beer selection is really good and they offer half off growler fills on Sunday which is awesome! However, if you go I would recommend only coming for a beer or a growler fill. The service is terrible. We waited to get menus, waited for over an hour for our food (which the server forgot the appetizer and mixed up another order.) There were 4 of us and the place did not seem that busy. They either need to have more servers or better ones. The food was very good once we got it but would not recommend going if you are in any sort of rush."}
{"text":"Went to this bar 2-5-18  I've heard so much about their beer selection got there around 11, ordered a beer and some food  pizza and sweet potato fries from the bartender who didn't seem to happy to be there  (short girl) didn't write anything down ok cool .... waited 45 minutes nothing came out bartender comes over and says sorry they made a mistake 25 more minutes pizza comes out cold and soggy but no fries ate some of it ,original bartender never came to check how everything was more interested in clocking out and gambling with her buddy at the bar  she had a different bartender come and check on us after .... Was excited to try this bar out left disappointed will never go back or recommend to anyone ... stay away from this bar"}
{"text":"Went this past weekend for the Stone Domination event.  I don't know why I didn't make it out here sooner.  I went on Friday and came back on Saturday for more.  It is a bit out of the way, but worth it.  The prices seem pretty standard for craft beers, my tab was about $15 for 2 served in goblets.  Other places in town have a large selection of beers, but usually not on tap, other than Yard House and that does not have the small-bar feeling that I prefer.  I was surprised by how nice the place is on the inside, clean and well-lit, not what I was expecting given the address.  They serve food, which is your standard bar far - the pizza tasted like microwave pizza, but wasn't terrible.  The people there seem friendly, and it is not too hard to get a bartender's attention, even when it was packed on Friday night.  Biggest complaint would be lack of parking when it gets crowded."}
{"text":"Always a long wait. Been a few times on Fridays and weekends and there is usually just one waitress and you have to wait to get your first beer. If you ever need anything you are constantly looking around and trying to waive down the next person you see. Food is good, but service is either poor or just frustrating. One time I ordered a beer, thought it was great so ordered it again. Had to waive down a different person only to hear that the beer I \"ordered\" had been out. A collaboration of workers couldn't figure out what they gave me..."}
{"text":"Had the pizza there tonight and quite a few stout beers got to say that was one hell of a great pizza."}
{"text":"Place has an amazing beer selection! On the other hand the food is pretty rough. Kitchen could definitely improve"}
{"text":"Fun bar.  Great food, tasty beer and the coolest bartender in town.

The combination of the overnight bartender Emo, Moose Drool beer and Aces & Ales' beer bites make for a great night.  Definitely a top bar of mine.  Local spot and generally non smokey when I've gone.

All around 5 Stars."}
{"text":"Aces & Ales has a wonderful craft beer selection. It also has a nice layout, with ample TV screens inside to watch sporting events and a really good patio area (only lacking a few TVs to take it to the next level). However, the food is dreadful and the service (based on one visit) is not much better. Out of five of us, one liked (and nothing more than \"liked\") their food. The service was not very attentive. When she got around to asking us if we liked our food (after we were all done eating), we replied with a less than enthusiastic response, one in which she did not seem to care much about. Also, a little personality goes a long way and often makes up (at least a little) for lackluster service. Our server's personality could be called tofu. With the beer selection and swell set-up, it is very disappointing that A&A cannot deliver on the food and service. (I suppose we should have listened to our one friend in the group that had been here before and had a similar experience.) Maybe if your pound enough craft beers their food and service seems remarkable. I guess that is my advice: Get hammered and then have the time of your life at A&A. If you are anything less than tipsy, take in something with flavor and service - Wine 5 Cafe is just up the road."}
{"text":"My husband and I love happy hours but sadly we are East Siders. And if you don't know, that means we don't have too many options that keep us close to home. We stumbled upon Aces & Ales on happy and because of good food reviews we visited... even though it wasn't happy hour. We are laid back people & not the beer drinking type, but they always suggest a good beer and have great food. We are a sucker for the perfection that is the beer bites (it's the beer cheese dip) and addicted to the Green Apple Bacon Cheddar grilled cheese. The first time we ordered what we thought was a cheap dessert Fried Oreos. This dessert is to die for!! An amazing portion with a great display and ice cream! We could barely finish. The girls there talk to you (of course) but in a way that doesn't make you feel it's all for tips. They seem GENUINE. 

We aren't smokers & the smoke smell is not overwhelming one bit. They have their regulars and it's nice to see the girls try to ask names of the new faces and interact. The place is clean, including the bathrooms. No complaints whatsoever. Drinks Food & Atmosphere! Can't ask for anything more..... scratch that let me add PRICING! lol A+++"}
{"text":"Such a great place. The bartender was so knowledgeable when it came to the beer and their happy hour special was great. The food was amazing : ) the bar bites and the deep fried Oreos was like nothing I tasted before. They definitely  got a new regular and I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Bar food, amazing?  Yeah almost never happens.  And yet...

Is the beer selection amazing?  No, not really.  I mean I've been to places where there was 40+ beers, 60+ beers, 100+ beers.  That's an amazing selection.  does this place have a a decent selection?  Yeah it does.  Probably about two dozen different types of beer.  I came here with Angela and we sat down with Misty as our bartender.  I saw a lot of people around us ordering the fish tacos and yet somehow we didn't order any.  Well, we were actually pretty full from lunch earlier so we were originally just going to order an app.  

We started with beer bites which is some variation of beer dipped deep fried bread.  And you get this variation at other bars and even some restaurants but I found them really tasty here.  I was really caught off-guard and surprised.  They were so tasty it really riled up my gourmand tongue and I wanted to try other foods here.  So we added the cajun mac and cheese.  It was also pretty outstanding.  Now I'm really starting to wonder about the food at this place.  Who ever went to a place that was a bar first and yet served really great food?  Crazy.  We talked some more to Misty and she swore that all the food there was really good and she admitted to being a food fanatic herself.  And the beers I got were pretty good also."}
{"text":"Service  totally redeemed this review! 

(first/origional 2 star)  Don't bother with the fish and chips! I came with a friend and was hungry for dinner.  The portion was pathetic,  2 small pieces of fish and a tiny portion of fries...  And NOT CHEEP!  IF I ever come back,  I won't make the mistake of ordering this ever AGAIN!  (hungry and grumpy) 

...  UPDATE..  They did give me an extra piece of fish...  that was considerate.

UPDATE 2... Actually they ended up bringing another order...  So 4 fish and lots of fries...  Full and happy.
BUT be warned...  Normal order IS SMALL. 

ALSO friend got the Julie Lucy stuffed burger and loved it...  Guess Ill have to try that."}
{"text":"Hands down the best beer drinkers bar in Vegas!! I'm a fan of good craft beer. Not the same ol craft beer that the bars with 3 craft beers carry. I'm talking exotic hard to find amazing beer! The owners know whats up with good beer at Aces. They have over 20 taps and they are always changing. Ive even met a couple of the main brewers from a few of my favorite brewery's there during some of their beerfest's(Which are a must go if you've never been to one. They hold them often. I think theres one this month). My only complaint is that there isn't one closer to my house. lol. I drive 20 minutes just to go there and its worth it every time. 

Oh yeah & the food is unlike any other bar/restaurant Ive ever ate at. The cooks are always on point & the food is high end for a bar. 

Aces and Ales is the definition of Quality w/ Quantity :) 

Did I mention Keri Kelli from Alice Cooper is one of the owners! Met him a couple times there and got to have a beer with him. Super cool guy! If you ha vent been to this bar & your a fan of good beer do yourself a favor and check it out."}
{"text":"I see a handful of poor reviews, but I don't get it.  They do communal seating, to encourage people to sit together.  They also have lots of great beers on tap, which they switch out regularly.  The bartenders are very knowledgeable, and helpful.  The food here is solid, but hasn't really blown me away, and sometimes(only sometimes) the wait staff is a bit slow to take an order.  I really enjoy grabbing a beer and a bite here, and I'm sure I'll go back again."}
{"text":"I have been here twice in the past and enjoyed it very much.  I recently purchased a Groupon for $20 towards lunch at Aces & Ales.  My son and I went there today and only had about an hour and 1/2 to eat our lunch.  We thought - no problem!   When we got there, the parking lot was dead.  We were the only people in the restaurant part.  We went ahead and seated ourselves as the sign stated and within a couple of minutes a server (didn't see her name) came over and gave us menus.  I told her I had a Groupon and she looked at me and then told my son we must purchase an entree, no lunch specials were allowed to be purchased through the Groupon.  Fine...we looked through the menu and decided what we wanted.  We sat there waiting ... waiting ... a guy came out of the kitchen and i said loud enough for him to hear me, do you know where the server is?!!  He acted as if he didn't hear me and turned to watch and cheer for the soccer game playing on the screen above.  There were people sitting at the bar who also could clearly see us!  Here we sat and sat - no drinks - no order - no service!  We got up and left!  Won't be going back - requesting a Groupon refund!!!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for all beer drinkers to go to. Came here on a Tuesday night and the place was packed (I think it was trivia night). We decided to go with a flight of beer and some food and the beer selection to choose from was massive! Also, the food was excellent. There were also dozens of TV'S all over, so it would definitely be a great place to watch a game."}
{"text":"We are volunteer drivers for Helping Hands of Henderson and just happened to wander into this wonderful place! While waiting for our client at her medical appt., we walked across the street and found this gem!  We had the $8 lunch box special which included BLT, fries (mine were sweet potato) and soft drink.  What a great deal and delicious food.  But what I really want to mention is the customer service!  We recommend this place to everyone! 
One person in particular: Austin Bailey was the best!  We have since told whoever we see about this place and the exceptional customer service! We hope to have more opportunities to be in North LV just to go back!"}
{"text":"Amazing and ever changing beer selection here. Best selections in town that I've found for those who truly love beer. The food menu is fun and doesn't scream franchise- thank the heavens above!!! We sat on the patio out back which was large, had a big fireplace with seating in front of it and would be great for large parties. We played cornhole while waiting for our pizza and salad. The bartender said they are working on getting better cornhole boards soon as well as getting the place in regulation so they can have younger than 21 year olds on the grounds (for large parties or eating). We got the Eddie Spaghetti pizza ($19, only available in large size)! It says it is spicy but my 4yo ate it without complaint- I didn't notice any elevated spice level either. I ordered it because it was different but I loved it! I can't recall the name of the salad but it had mushrooms, tomatoes, steak, arugula, and blue cheese ! It paired nicely. Highly recommended, though, I do prefer thinly sliced steak on salads. 
Not too smoky considering smoking is allowed. It's darkly light- everyone looks better in low lighting, though, don't they? Fun bartender. The kegs can be seen and they have beers in standing refrigerators that you can pick from too."}
{"text":"The only reason I come here is for the amazing selection of craft beer!!!!

Im giving this place only 3 stars for the following reasons:

1) The seating is really awkward. The bar area has these weird bench seats that seem to be meant to fit a few people, but it's too squishy. Additionally, if there's someone at the table next to you, it's awkward getting in and out. And I'm not a big person at all (5'3\" 111lbs). The other half of the room is big, open and overly well lit, for a bar). I don't know about you, but I don't like to drink in a bright ass room. I prefer to sit in the dark bar area with the awkward setting, but it's always full. :(

2) The food is way overpriced for the portions and the quality in my opinion."}
{"text":"The food was ok, especially the sweet potato fries, but really, 7 lousy chicken wings for $9? No wonder the place is empty. 
The waitress however was very nice, still felt like I was ripped off and the menu doesn't tell you how many wings you get for the price which again was too high for too little."}
{"text":"I decided to stop in late last night after a long day of work. There were a lot of people at the bar, but I was still able to find a machine to play on right away. The bartender Brandie was very quick to serve me and greeted me with a very enthusiastic welcome. Even though it was busy, she never made me wait for a fresh drink. All the while she was super friendly and always finding time to talk to me. Overall her service was second to none and it makes me want to definitely come back again. Great atmosphere, great selection of unique beers, and a tremendous bartender on top of it all! Thank you Brandie for making a very fun night!!"}
{"text":"I've waited a while to write this review because I really want to LOVE A&A, it just always leaves me disappointed. The service is very slow, whether they're busy or not, and every server I've had acts annoyed when you ask them for something. I went for pub quiz last night, and my group planned on staying and drinking for a while, but our server just dropped the bill off and left, with three rounds still left in trivia!

The happy hour menu is good, but the prices for the quality of most of the menu is ridiculous. The best thing is the onion rings, everything else is mediocre at best. The nachos are horrible. One little layer of chips with gross cheese and a few pieces of chicken or steak. On multiple occasions they've gotten my order wrong, and take the cheapest way out to fix it. They brought the wrong kind of pizza, and all they did to fix it was take it back to the kitchen, take the toppings off and put new ones on, then brought it back to our table without even warming it. 

I'll keep coming back for happy hour, the beer selection, and trivia every now and then, but like I said, I really want it to be THE spot, but I always have to wait until I forget the disappointment  to venture back."}
{"text":"If you're into microbrews, this place is for you! 40 or so taps available, website lists what's currently up, good variety. Best bet is to go with the flight, letting you pick six beers, each a 4oz pour, for $16. Bar staff is friendly, several TVs to watch whatever game you're into.

But you may want to eat elsewhere. BF ordered the Juicy Lucy, said it was just alright, overcooked. Side of house fries is seasoned nicely. I opted for the Arrogant Bastard Steak Salad, much hyped by Tony T. It's an ample portion of meat, and I liked the dressing, but felt there were only minimal greens- maybe this is a salad best ordered by guys who don't like salads. 

 In addition to putting out average food, kitchen staff is slow- took 30+ minutes to get our orders, and we were the only ones eating. Now we know why. At $13/dish, plus the $16 flight, and tip, total was $50. Didn't really have the quality to justify the pricing, can have better for less at other bars around town."}
{"text":"Great selection of craft beers...they even have a few sours, try the #5.  The bartenders were awesome."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Aces & Ales, I figured it would be just another bar with mediocre food. I tried their Arrogant B*****d Steak Salad, and it was phenomenal along with the service."}
{"text":"An outstanding beer selection on draught and an excellent menu bring this hole in the wall from the outstanding to the sublime.  Try the mac & cheese."}
{"text":"Very very good food and beer selection here!  I've had their veggie burger and Juicy Lucy; both were great!"}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to come to Aces and Ales because it's close to our job and I'm so glad we did! 
Neither of us are beer drinkers and our waiter/beer connoisseur, Mitch went out of his way to find us something we'd like. He asked what flavors we liked, I admitted I wasn't a beer drinking but I liked whiskey and he found the perfect beer for me! The beer he chose was the first beer I've ever enjoyed and finished. He was so friendly and attentive and incredibly knowledgeable. 
I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, drinks and waitress!!! Happy hour on a Friday after work! Stephanie was the best!!!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, beer selection was very nice!
service was a joke, sooooooooo slooooooow. Won't be back. I am a server, so i am really forgiving when it comes to bad service. But... wow!"}
{"text":"The food and beers on tap are fantastic! Beers I did not think I could get here like the firestone undercurrants!!!! Very clean and the ambiance was nice but just a little dark."}
{"text":"When I lived on the East side, I would go here a lot to watch football (Until I caved and got the NFL ticket). They have some of the best bar food I've ever had. Being from Wisconsin, I assumed their cheese curds would be shit, but they were shockingly ALMOST as good as the ones from back home! Their burgers are so large I usually split it with a friend. The staff is really nice, and after signing up for their gaming stuff, I am always getting coupons in my mailbox."}
{"text":"As a beer geek, I made the trek way off the strip to Aces and Ales...and when I say way off the strip, it is WAY OFF the strip. However, once I found this hole in the wall, hard to miss location with it's huge sign, I found a very unpretentious place to enjoy an amazing beer, or two, or three (actually, I had five the day of my visit). 

The beers come from all over...though they don't have many taps and virtually no bottles, all the beers are great!!! 

The wait staff is friendly, though not always knowledgeable about what is on tap...but who cares. All I need my wait staff to do is pour the beer, hand it to me, and then leave me alone as I sip and enjoy. 

I also had lunch here, which is not recommended unless you really love bar food (I do not!). Some items on the menu seem over priced, but you could care less if you're hungry and need something to wash down all that beer with!!!

If you love beer and have time to drive off the strip, make sure to visit Aces and Ales!"}
{"text":"I roll into Vegas on occasion for business and if you can escape the obnoxious strip scene and steal away for a bit (and you like GOOD beer) you should definitely check it out. 

They have a ton of craft beers, at least 50 on tap, and also offer many really good selections in the bottle as well. You can check out their website and see the beer lists just to get an idea of what you could be tasting. 

We swung through on our way to catch a flight home (the round about path to the airport...and kill time with nothing left to do). I wish I had a few more days and hours to burn away sipping through the entire selection. I also tried the food here and it was certainly good but what will have me returning is the selection. I always find it hard to get good beer in Vegas but now I know where to turn!"}
{"text":"Where to begin?  Music that chimes memories of good times enjoyed with great friends bathed in the yellow light of reminiscence.  A selection of beers that keeps the most experienced and refined palates intrigued and inquisitive. And the service.  The extensive list of libations can intimidate, but server assistance can guide you to the thirsty satisfaction you crave.  That's where Krystal shines.  Her pleasant demeanor and menu knowledge ensure a top shelf drinking and dining experience.  Bravo, Aces and Ales, bravo!"}
{"text":"Even tho it's a drive for me, I love this bar!! The tap selection is always awesome. Try the panko crusted deviled eggs!! Amazing!! Britnie was my bar tender, definitely ask for her, she's amazing!! If your looking for a great local bar, with great draft beer and amazing service, check out Aces & Ales!!"}
{"text":"Far and away the best craft beer destination in Vegas and one of the best I've ever been to. Austin manages the place and is the coolest guy. We were really lucky to meet him. Fantastic food and great atmosphere. It's a gem for sure."}
{"text":"This place looks gnarly and a little dilapidated from the outside.  I am so glad I went in.  They have a fantastic beer selection for all palates and price levels."}
{"text":"Aces & Ales is always a blast. The food is delicious and the beer is always cold. The bartenders are knowledgeable about the beer. I really enjoy the patio on nice days, I only wish that it was pet friendly."}
{"text":"FYI- I LOVE beer and I LOVE sports.  Went today to watch the ALCS Tigers/Orioles AND some football--they have MULTIPLE tv's and all with duplicate games.  We asked for the TV near our table to be changed to the baseball game, but no go.  There are plenty of bars to hang out at on Sundays, I was looking to make this my hang out--it's ok.  I have PLENTY of $$ to pump into other bars and machines.  Come on Aces!  Get it together!  You have a GREAT venue with many tv's--make your patrons happy and they will return."}
{"text":"A&A What can I say this place? Other than the best beer choices in Vegas, delicious food, and cool staff. The music is rocking, pool tables to play on, and open all the time. 
I've been going for the past two years, I think I went in the first week they were open, and I've never had a bad experience there. 
Alice Cooper played here!
It's a bit of a drive for me but worth it for the beer and the community that is drawn to it. I run into at least one person I know every time I go in."}
{"text":"A HUGE fan of the Nellis location, and my only complaint was that it was far...and then this place happened! About a block from another of my usual hangouts, Tenaya Creek, I seem to favor this place more because, well 50 craft beer on tap...and food...that's good...
If you're new to the craft beer scene, have them recommend you something. 
Everyone starts somewhere- Lagers, Pilsners, Stouts, Ciders...try something new. 
They seem to have some special thing going on every night; Tuesday/Thursday night tastings (TNT) where they pair a gourmet food item with beer, Black Market crash Sundays (Refill your growler for half? price and cheap beer that day), and I'm sure with age, we'll see tap takeovers.
If your into gambling or sports, they do have a bar full of machines and tv's all around. I prefer to sit at the taller tables around the wall and marvel at the tetris-looking metallic ceiling tiles with my beer!"}
{"text":"I tried this place out since I was with a friend who's a true beer connoisseur.  I must say I was pleased in this it's quite a nice oasis with multiple pool tables, great viewing of sports from many angles in the bar and a great menu of beers.  Although I didn't try any of the beers I did appreciate the great service, option of a tasting menu, and growlers for sale.  If you're into beer or just a good time at a bar you maybe haven't thought of then this is a great place to spend an evening."}
{"text":"Pretty cool little place, a lot of Tvs and a few pool tables. They have a good selection of food from burgers to Mac n cheese. The beer list isn't bad either about 20 on draft, and they also have bottles. I would defiantly say a place to go check out."}
{"text":"This was pretty terrible even with a groupon.... The beer selection sucked because they were letting there taps run out because they were having some type of tap take over a few days from now. The food was basic pub grub and the waitresses were lack luster and non interested."}
{"text":"I can't sing enough about this place and the only bad thing I would say is, dammit this place is far from my house,but well worth the half hour trip.

I live on the opposite side of town, fine. On with the pleasantries, commander:
Came here for our 9th anniversary! JUST to enjoy something not tapped on the west coast EVER- 120 min dogfish head...and it didn't disappoint.

Just enjoyed the 2nd annual strong beer festival 2/3 days. Was kinda tired of driving and we tried A LOT of great beers,so many that I had to rearrange my favorites list. All of them are craft beers :)

We are getting to the point to where if they haven't quite gotten our names down, they certainly know our faces and hand us the list of craft on tap!
I love places like that.

This time we tried food (I kept hearing it was awesome, and I've only ever gone there to drink!) We had fried cheese curds, wings, and parmesan fries. I though all were amazing,especially the fries!!! They tease you when someone walks by with a tray of em. lol

The music was awesome last night and we met some people both in town and from CA that were all there for the same purpose-drink beer you can't find anywhere else!
SO of course I'll be back. :D"}
{"text":"Made two stops here this week while in Vegas. Once again friendly staff and great food. Great happy hour specials and you have to try the spaghetti pizza it's the best."}
{"text":"I have been previously warned about the service at Aces & Ales being average. But I love trying new beers. We went after I bought a Groupon and so we went. The service was okay and the second shifts came in and were very friendly. We ordered, ate and drank for a good two hours. When it was time to leave, we gave our bartender a $20 for tip because to our surprise she was great. We paid and left. The next day I noticed a 20% tip added to my amount. I called to speak to a manager and ended speaking to the bartender from our visit. I asked if there was an automatic tip charge on each bill. She said no and I left a message for the manager. The next day the charge was corrected and I received a call from the manager. He explained that some backs automatically put a 20% charge on tickets. WTF! This guy must think people are idiots. I let him speak and was trying to hold back my inner thoughts. I will probably not go back. So if you go to this bar definitely pay with cash."}
{"text":"I am not buying into the hype. This place was dumpy with snotty airheaded old bartenders who will snub the shit out of you if you are a girl. She \"forgot\" about my drink for 15 minutes until I pointed it out to the other bartender. Then the original bartender magically remembered. $20 for two shitty drinks and atrocious service. The manager was more interested in groping the bartender when he was behind the bar than actually checking in with patrons. Other than that, it is a standard dark, dumpy bar with a decent selection of beer. There are six TVs playing sports, 80s music blasting, and a pool table. I think they played Juke Box Hero like 5 times.  

Video poker at bar. Smoking allowed. Weak drinks. Crowd is pretty old. Very meh ..not much separating from chains like yard house. Except at Yardhouse you aren't treated like shit. Also, the idiot airhead bartender added extra $2 to her tip to make it 20% which I am disputing with the bank. It isn't about $2.00 it's about the entitlement these idiots feel even when they provide below sub par service."}
{"text":"Always great! The staff, the food, the drinks! We usually get Helen as our bartender, and she provides great service and recommendations on new rotating beer. Even though this place is kinda far from my house, i don't mind the drive. 

Must try: Pulled pork fries
Happy hour: 2-6pm and 12am-6am 
Pizza is half off, and great appetizers. 

See you next time! :-D"}
{"text":"Good happy hour on Sunday it's called sinner Sunday's. Good prices on appetizers and tap beer. Good selection. We got the nachos, bread knot things, and cheese balls Service was a little slow, but we would return!"}
{"text":"This place had been bookmarked for awhile.   My husband and I ordered beers and had a question about a couple others.  Waitress was nice and gave a sample of beer in question, which ultimately ended up with another beer purchase.   Where the dinner started falling apart is in the kitchen.  I ordered a stuffed burger medium well.  The burger was raw, and the waitress even commented about how raw the burger was and would send it back.  Apparently this happened several times this night as she said she had to send several burgers back.  When my burger finally comes back out after another 20 minutes, it didn't come with any aioli.  Additionally they gave me regular fries on the 3rd attempt instead of sweet potato fries.    I didn't have time to try and get it right as we spent 1.5 hours getting food and already had plans and needed to quickly go.  I had to leave after only eating a small portion of my food as I was running late for our next obligation. Sadly, a place I was really looking forward to trying ending up being a place I will never go back to."}
{"text":"If you are into good strong craft beers that are nicely priced you will most certainly love this place. Bar food is usually really predictable and good if your drunk. This place does not have bar food, its better than most places that specialize in just food. Yum! I just wish it was located on my side of town."}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place out after all the rave reviews here on Yelp, and also because we found out they serve Stone brews and have somewhat frequent takeovers by the Stone Brewing Company. 

We stumbled in late Thursday night for some late night dinner. We asked if there was service to the adjoining room (since there was no open seating in the main room), and one of the bartenders was cool enough to come over to serve us. We didn't even care that it took her a while to get to us, I was just happy she was willing (we would have left otherwise).

Jason's Juicy Lucy burger was stuffed with cheese, bacon and chorizo. He ordered it medium-rare but is seemed more rare, a lot of the burger wasn't cooked at all. He enjoyed it anyway, and the onion rings he got were also delicious. He also ordered an Arrogant Bastard Ale. I just got a plain cheeseburger and fries, cooked medium. The burger was well done, but the fries were phenomenal. Possibly some of the best I'd ever had. 

While we joked about how our burgers seemed to be on two ends of the spectrum, we also noticed that Jason's beer- now half gone- had expired nearly 6 months ago. When we let our server know, she mentioned that it was fine and she serves the same brew that has an expiry date of 2007 to guests that still request it, only IPAs need to be thrown out. Nonetheless, she offered to get us a new bottle, which we declined since we were about done with our meal anyway. I was just really surprised that they knowingly serve old brews, and still charge $12 a bottle for it. We aren't sure if we got an accurate taste of the beer, so we'll likely pick up a bottle at Lee's and try it at home."}
{"text":"I like what they done with the place. I've seen quite a few business come and go in this location over the years. I wish A & A much success.

I really like the beer selections and the method of selection. Quite unique! The bar tenders are well educated and know the beers. I suggest trying them all!

Unfortunately I did not get a chance to try the food.  After enjoying the beer we moved to the dinning room only to sit for 15 minutes without the food server even giving us a nod that we existed. She (and two other staff members) walked right past us several times without a word. The wait staff in my opinion was not attentive to our needs and many of the tables were dirty, including the one we sat at."}
{"text":"The beer selection is all A&A has going for it.   The atmosphere is very loud.  I like sports bars, but this place is an obnoxious echo chamber.   The food is sub par even for pub food.  Tomato sauce and heavy cream does not equal tomato basil soup.  The French dip was thin and flavorless.   Multiple times I had to get up to serve myself.   Come if you're thirsty.   Stay away if your hungry and tired."}
{"text":"Ordered an ahi salad to go and had a beer. The ahi was seasoned well & cooked to perfection. The dressing on the salad was a very good pairing with the ahi, I finished it so fast that I wish it were bigger. The women at the bar seemed to kind of brush me off, probably because they knew I wasn't staying long, I assume. I really enjoyed everything I had ordered I just wish I had felt comfortable enough to ask the ladies behind the bar some questions about the beers on tap, but they weren't very welcoming. BUT, I will continue to come back because I absolutely love this bar."}
{"text":"We hoped to rent their party room and large covered patio for a birthday party, but it was already booked. So we stayed for a drink and light meal.  There is a huge selection of craft beers, including a Farnhouse saison that the BF was excited to try.  They have the typical pub food like wings, but also nontypical offerings. We had their creamy tomato soup topped with a chiffonade of basil. The soup is made fresh, daily--nice and satisfying. It paired very well with the cheese tray set with a slice of creamy brie, wedge of gorgonzola, coin of pepper-crusted goat cheese, grilled slices of artisan bread AND bacon jam!  They have a grundle of screens up in the bar area for sport fans and since it was Tuesday night, the Geeks who love beer trivia event was going on in the large dining area.  This was a live trivia game, with a lot of players and an announcer calling out the questions. Sounded like so much fun. Think we'll swing by with friends another Tuesday to try it out!"}
{"text":"Mitchel was our server and was amazing!
He was attentive and prompt with our order and checking in with us."}
{"text":"Cant say enough... Great food,  great beer selection and they constantly change the selection to keep it interesting.  They have the best customer service from Austin to Mark and everyone in between. !!!"}
{"text":"I like this place a lot. Needless to say, the beer selection is awesome and the food is surprisingly rad. However I don't like having to drive to New Mexico to get here. Also, I like Stone Brewing (I'm from San Diego, I get it....)but can ya get some other beers on tap? Every time I turn around it's some festival with Stone as the centerpiece.  I think the Jr. high crush on Stone is a little overwhelming. Maybe consider moving on to that experimental phase of the college years?"}
{"text":"Service was horrible absolutely horrible been there 3 times expecting something different. Here's a idea have a bar that stocks what people drink not everyone drinks ipa beers. burger came out and small personal pizza took 50 minutes to get asked are waitress what took so long gave some bs excuse about busy also food arrived not as ordered. 



Definitely a pass your not missing much here."}
{"text":"From start to finish, I've always had an excellent experience at aces and ales due completely in oar to the excellent bar/wait/server staff.  If I can specifically name anyone, it would be Mitch, Stephanie, Fallin, Azure, Jenna, Helen, Nicole, Krystal, Brandy.  They have all worked efficiently, and effectively to provide a repeat worthy experience to make one feel like their at home.  It is this service that makes me want to come back again and again, and possibly make my question where my home actually is. There is no other place is rather spend my time and money based on the excellent food/service/booze any where else in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"To echo the reviews below: this place is great.

The beer selection can't be beat.  The food was good.  I got an Arrogant Bastard marinated steak (how amazing does that sound) wrap.  It was about the size of an infant.  The bartender was extremely friendly and gave great beer suggestions.  

Bottomline:  If you love craft beer and have a car in Vegas or (god forbid) you're stuck at Nellis, you're wrong if you don't come here."}
{"text":"Awesome  place!  nice comfortable  staff is great. Special  thank to Austin and his staff."}
{"text":"I have no idea how this place EVER got 5 stars. Here is a review that was not written by one of their employees in case you want to know what this place is really like. I went to this bar for the first time on Friday and Ito was by far the worst experience I have ever had at a bar.

First of all, everyone keeps commenting on their \"craft\" beers, but their selection was nothing special. Most of the beers are things you could find at the grocery store and the names were all pretty familiar. To make it worse, my boyfriend tried to order four different beers and they kept saying they were out.  That might not have been so bad if the waitresses hadn't disappeared for 20 minutes each time he tried to order one.

The worst part of the experience was definitely the service. The waitress was a complete bitch. The first time she came to the table she spent about 5 seconds there and gave us no explanation for the confusing menu. After that there was no sight of her for a good 25 minutes despite the fact that the place was not busy. A different waitress eventually came and took our order. The only time the first waitress came back was to be super rude to my friend who politely asked if they had any vegan-friendly drinks. After basically telling my friend she wasn't a true vegan because of what she ordered she she stormed off and didn't come to our table the rest of the night.

When I wanted to get my check I tried to signal her, but she was clearly intentionally ignoring our table. She would go up to the bar and chat with her waitress friends and then chat with the bartender and then she would turn away for our table without even giving us a glance. I had to go up to the bar and tell them no one had visited our table in 30 minutes and we would like our check. I didn't get any sort of apology, but I did get my check and got the hell out of there. 

If you want terrible service in a bar that really has noting special to offer then this is the place for you. I, for one, will never be returning to Aces and Ales."}
{"text":"Well done!!

I am a huge fan of the original location, but it is so far for me, that we only venture out east as a rare treat. This spot i just magical!! 

We came in for a work outing.
The server, Erin, who was clearly very busy, did a great job of making recommendations and providing timely deliveries.

You come here for the beer selection, so I won't go too into detail, but just know that Aces & Ales has the most reasonable prices for the highest quality products. The price points are dead on and there is something for every taste at every level.

Our food, including artichoke and nachos, was both creatively prepared and palatablely (new word) exciting.  

See you there!!"}
{"text":"I can not tell you enough time to go to Aces & Ales.
DO NOT plan to make it a part of a bar hopping trip, because once you get here, you will not want to leave.

The selection is probably unbeatable in Las Vegas. The prices are PERFECT, which I never get to say. You get exactly the right quantity and quality in everything you purchase.

The bartenders are VERY helpful with selections and options and the owner is frequently there to same his knowledge and passion for beer.

This is the bar I take my friends to when they visit.
You should go... like, now."}
{"text":"Good food and service. Great beer selection. Menu very limited and all deep fried and cheesy. I would have liked more healthy options - yes, I  know it's pub food, but variety is nice. My boyfriend and I bought a groupon and went for dinner, but the groupon invalidated happy hour prices, do we didn't save much. Onion rings were good, but pizza bites were great!"}
{"text":"Great service at the bar: thanks to James. Great food: sauerkraut with bacon and apples and currywurst, yum! Great recommendations on beers to try. Great beer options. Great artwork, even it is hung too high. Will be back to buy a growler for sure and to try the mac and cheese."}
{"text":"I took date here for a drink and appetizer before going to party, so we only ordered guacamole and chips and some beer and drinks. The guacamole and chips were fresh, but way too much black pepper in the guacamole. It was almost all I could taste. It was not bad, just weird and unexpected. Who puts black pepper especially in large quantities in guacamole. Anyways just through me off. Beer is great and my date enjoyed her fu fu drink, even had a second one. Staff was friendly and knowledgeable."}
{"text":"Great local bar with lots of beer choices, extensive menu and very good happy hour specials. Our small mountain of great onion rings and a few IPAs hit the spot."}
{"text":"One of my very favorite Vegas spots! The new beer lists always brings you in to try something new! A little pricey but if you ask the bartenders about special days and times then good chance you could be walking out with a growler of your fave brew for 50% off! 
And the food is phenomenal. I'm a total food snob. I like big bold flavors and interesting combinations. Aces has it. Yum! Love it here. They know I'll always come around xo"}
{"text":"You go for the beer. The food is okay, not bad, certainly better than most 24 hr places. It has a sort of biker/dive bar feel so don't expect warm and fuzzies from the wait or bar staff but nobody is rude. We are total beer snobs and they are able to accommodate here, although you will pay hefty prices. They have the best bottle list in the city, lots of whales and aged beers, the most impressive is the selection of Stone Old Guardian and Double Bastard going back a decade. I think the old guardian peaks at like 4 years so go on Wednesday and try a 2012 for like $20 it's worth it. Or you could try the FW Parabola (I think 2012?) that was $120. Just to give you an idea of the range. The taps are always changing, they have the usual local and west coast brews but also tend to get limited releases and they are often doing tap takeovers and special events. Good place to take beer noobs also to show them styles they might not have considered and let them see a side of beer that isn't often available at local bars."}
{"text":"Delicious! !!! Salad size is out of control, easily feeds 3. The juicy lucy stuffed burger is like a burger stuffed with a coney island. Amazing. Arrogant bastard battered cheese balls and a beer flight. We will be back."}
{"text":"Do you like beer?  Do you love beer?  Do you like a bar that feels like it's YOUR dive bar.  Well, come on over and pull up a stool.  Aces & Ales is a local bar with tourists (me - but I am not touristy), locals and bartenders from other bars all looking for a good cold beer without any sequins or women wearing feathers. 

There are two areas with pool tables, video poker on the bar,  a long comfy bench to sit back and watch sports and a character or two wandering around to remind you that this is Las Vegas.

The focus here is beer.  The food compliments the beer.  The sports on TV are a reason to sit and have more beer.  I want Aces & Ales to move to the Mojave Desert so I don't have to drive 4 hours to feel at home.

Food :  fried cheese curds - strangely good and addicting
             house mac & cheese - yum
             arrogant bastard onion rings - crunchy and tasty
             classic hamburger - damn good burger

I only have one complaint - no hard cider on draft.  

They are open 24 hours and if you are looking for a deal for breakfast try $6 for french toast and bacon or steak & eggs for $9.

So now my neighborhood bar is 145 miles away."}
{"text":"Terrific lunch menu with awesome burgers! For $8 you can't get a better burger, fries and a drink any where else. Service is always friendly and it's a great place to go with co workers!"}
{"text":"Just recently went here for the first time. I didn't eat so I can't personally comment on the food yet. I went with a group of about 12; service was on point all night. 50 beers on tap, I went with a stone IPA which was only $5. Beer was fresh, clean, cold and tasty... they definitely keep their tap system in top shape. All n all a great first visit, I'll definitely go again."}
{"text":"Before I came here I heard \"they have great sandwiches  
and fun atmosphere \". Well that must of been a totally different bar before because when I went in it was quiet and I was seated at the bar for a good 10 minutes before the bartender even spoke a word to me. When I looked at the menu it had a very limited and boring food menu. I decided in a basic burger and slaw. When it came out there was more topping then burger and it was overlooked. Also the coleslaw had a heavy vinegar taste to it. The beer was ok but not cold. And the patrons didn't care about blowing smoke my way. 
So in a nut shell the food and beer is bad and overpriced and  the environment is unwelcome. You would get better value for money at McDonald's and I HATE McDonald's 
OH and if you all of a sudden see 4 star reviews  like \"Don G\" who just happen to put it up there (NOT) only after my review went up just look at the history and you will see the most stars (on average) this bar gets is 3."}
{"text":"great food the largest selection of craft brews around. Heather is great! 15 TV's for all the games. great local bar for sure."}
{"text":"Love the Eddie spaghetti pizza and the gumbo mac and cheese. But still a little on the expensive side. Can't wait to try more menu items"}
{"text":"Got a Groupon and had been wanting to try the food here so the hubby and I ventured over here for a Friday night dinner.  After reading the reviews I was worried that we may be in for a long night.  We arrived around 7p and sat on the kitchen side.  There were a couple of tables occupied and three waitresses buzzing around.  As soon as we sat down, a waitress told us someone will be right with us.  And we waited.  I don't know if I am old school but I seem to remember a 30 second meet and greet back in the day.  This meant that within 30 seconds of you sitting down, someone was bringing you water, menu and saying hi.  Finally someone brought some menus and shortly after that our waitress came and asked us if we had any questions and I quickly ordered waters,  Boneless Wings and Zucchini Chips.  She came back shortly there after and took our food orders:  burger for the hubby and Shocke grilled cheese for me.  The food came out very quickly with just the right amount of time between the apps and main.

On to the food.  The boneless wings were not the greatest thing ever, but they were good in the fact that they were not some previously frozen thickly breaded boneless \"where's the chicken\" bite.  They were actual pieces of chicken with a very light, but crispy coat and not overly sauced.  Good in my book.  My zucchini was good as well.  I really prefer the breadcrumb style fried zucchini-this was coated in a beer battered style-good, but this in my opinion makes for a greasy cold mess if you don't eat them at the speed of light!  Hubby's burger was just your average bar burger, but tasted pretty good.  He is a fan of FAtburger and always says Fat is better.  My grilled cheese however was pretty disappointing.  Sourdough bread with one piece of provolone, roasted red peppers, jalapeno's (freshly cut-not jar), and bacon.  I could have made this at home and it would have been killer!  It was just lacking...cheese, maybe?  If I order a specialty grilled cheese I think it should be pretty darn cheesy!  

Anyway, our server was good, quick and attentive and hopefully more people will have this kind of experience and live to tell the tale....

Go try it...let me know ;)"}
{"text":"I was not impressed at all with the service. The waitress that helped served me and my friend was not attentive at all. I told her I was waiting on a friend but wanted to go ahead and get her a iced tea so she walked away and came back with the iced tea without even asking if I wanted anything. She would come and ask what we needed or if we were ready to order but then rushed off without allowing us time to really answer her question. Also, the glass of wine I had was warm as if it just came out of the bottle. I took the drink back to the bar and a very nice lady assisted me and said she would bring a new glass when the wine had chilled a bit. The pizza was very good which is why I am giving a 2 stars but the chicken was just ok. The friend I came with for her birthday has said she has come here before and the service was never that bad."}
{"text":"All in all a good bar. Beer is reasonably priced for such rare varieties. I had never seen about 80% of the beers on the menu. Their selection tends toward IPAs, so be prepared. Kind of light on seating, there's a regular bar counter with video poker machines and a few tables. There seems to be a room just for parties, it was closed off the night I went. Also they don't have much parking. We were directed to park at the adjacent gas station."}
{"text":"Tremendous beer selection and good service. Food is slightly above bar fare but decent. Fun beer events. Super cold, please turn off air conditioner when it's 55 outside."}
{"text":"You like beer?  Then this is your place.  You like good service?  Again, this is your place.  And tasty bar food.  We've been here three times.  Every time, great service and great beer.  We had server, Nicole.  And, boy, does she know her beer. Turned us on to a great seasonal beer and we even got a growler of it to go.  She's super friendly and real knowledgeable about the beers, which you want when you go to a beer joint.  Appys to munch on - pretzels w/mustard cheese dipping, fresh made guac and chips and chicken tenders.  Hubs got a buffalo chicken wrap that he loved.  I think this is our new \"joint\" for hanging out.  If not for the great beer, just to chat it up with Nicole.  We always eat and drink on the bar side.  They do have dining on the other side, which seems great for groups or bigger parties. Oh, and they always have a GREAT playlist playing."}
{"text":"Beer selection is on point! Only place I know where I can get sour beers!! Foods cool but the main attraction is late night happy for food and really good craft beer selection."}
{"text":"Its got a divey feel and fabulous beer. Add to that an interesting mix of patrons and decent eats. What do you get? A great bar to hang out in. 

It's never too loud - so you can actually carry on a conversation with someone. And if you are a beer snob (which I just so happen to be), you can sip some very fine quality beers here - and all while mixing and mingling with other beer connoisseurs."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The beer selection is phenomenal and the food is fantastic. Great relaxed atmosphere."}
{"text":"Beer Advocate and Yelp were spot on with their review here.  Superb service by male/female bartenders who doubled as wait staff.  Great craft beer selection and solid unique pub fare.  Shared the guilt of  of caloric filled dining - cheesy goodness of Mac and cheese w/ shrimp/large salty pretzels and 6 deep fried Oreos w ice cream drizzled w/ hot fudge on top!  If you're in town, definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"They have three items on their breakfast menu. Ordered steak and eggs what a waste of a good steak taste like a dirty locker room smells apparently they marinate there New York Strip in Arrogant Bastard ale... absolutely ridiculous it taste like crap!!! Eating breakfast there is like burning a $20 bill overpriced garbage... I told the bartender they need to stop marinating their steak in beer she said that'll never happen... I guess that's the same chances they have of me returning as a customer....... I tried to give less than one star and it would not let me that's how bad it was."}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this place for awhile and finally had the opportunity.  The beer selection offerings were amazing (for Vegas) and I was excited to try a lot of beers I had never had before. However, I quickly learned that this place may have a wide variety on the chalkboard but most of them are sold out.   The selection seems to be heavy handed on IPAs. Despite the fact that four of the six beers I ordered in my flight (from the menu that was printed that day) were unavailable I would like to go here again. Vegas needs more places like this. If the beers they advertised were in stock I would give them five stars."}
{"text":"Great food. Awesome beer. Always a good time. Crystal was super awesome, great service!  Austin is the new bartender and super helpful and awesome!"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some pizza. Somehow I found this place on the internet. Wanted to find a local place...bar type atmosphere, old rock tunes. several tv monitors with sports on. Had the OG beer bits. Awesome. And a pepperoni pizza. Very cheesy. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"First time here at this location.  Great food great service great beer.  Self seating at big pub style tables with an incredible video beer board.  I would drive here only for the grilled cheese."}
{"text":"The best grilled cheese ever, high end food and drink, bar setting, loved it."}
{"text":"I'm a simple man. Give me good beer, good wings and a tv and I'm one happy fella. This place has all these things and more. If it was closer, I'd be a regular. The food was really good, the service was as well. I tried some really great brews on tap and I look forward to trying more. They have a wall full of tvs for my viewing pleasure. I hear they have football specials too so I may have to check them out some Sunday."}
{"text":"Great friendly place... Food is above average for bar food. My goto place in the area"}
{"text":"I'm so glad this location opened in the northwest, the first site is just too far for me. 
BEER SNOBS come here! Up to FIFTY excellent craft brews on tap, plus an extensive bottle collection, even a few cans (Oskar Blues). I'm a hop head and there are at least 10 varieties of IPAs on the menu every time I've been here, plus plenty of reds, browns, stouts, and lagers of all styles. PLUS sour beers! You have not lived until you've tried a gueze (extremely sour beer, an acquired taste). My favorite bartender so far is Matt (SING: \"His name is my name too!\"), he is very passionate and knowledgeable about beer and even cracked open a bottle of Lips of Faith to share with us at the end of his shift when he heard two of my companions hadn't had any sour brews before. Oh, and they do growler fills, bring your own or buy one there. I also was able to get 1 oz tastes of quite a few before ordering. 
FOOD! It's pretty dang good, they've thinned out the menu recently, no more Capt. Crunch waffles (never tried it) or Greek style Mac n cheese (meh, wasn't great) or their salmon entree (sorry to see that go, I liked it). I was super hungry this time so I ordered the damn Arrogant Bastard onion rings (not bad, couldn't really taste the AB) and the ahi tuna salad (fantastic after I added avocado). My friend had the steak wrap & she liked it. After midnight, their happy hour kicks in, their Mac n cheese is $5, so I tried it Cajun style, with andoullie sausage, which was also excellent.
MUSIC: There's a TouchTunes jukebox so you can throw your songs on without having to even leave your seat! Plus there's the added fun of anonymously Rick Rolling the bar, or playing your favorite song as your own personal walk-in music when you arrive, since there are speakers out front.
TVs: Plenty of them, tunes to a variety of sports networks, your bartender can find channels for you. 
SERVICE: Sometimes it can be difficult to catch the bartenders' eye, but they are friendly and helpful.
Overall, I really dig this place, it has become my neighborhood go-to bar."}
{"text":"Good place with a good happy hour. We had the deviled egg appetizer and it was very good. They have many different beers on tap. They are not a brewery. Overall a great experience."}
{"text":"Do you like good beer? 

Do you like a big selection of bottles and taps? 

If you answered yes to these two then Aces and Ales is your place. This place is way off of the strip but if your tired of 3 foot margaritas and domestic watered down beers, then get your ass over here and drink the good stuff. 

I came here for the 2nd Annual Strong Beer Festival that lasted all weekend. They really stepped up to the plate and hit a home run on the brews they got in. Really rare stuff that is tough to find in bottles let alone on tap. They set it up for 27 new beers on tap Friday through Sunday. Check the site for a list of stuff as there are just too many to list. 

The food there is your typical pub food and was ok nothing to spectacular although the Rosemary Garlic Fries are to die for. Pizza is pretty decent but my advice is don't get the fish tacos as they were not good at all. 

Big ups to the owner for passing out hot wings that were HOTTER than the surface of the sun. I think they were ghost chili...and I will never eat those again as I felt like Mike Tyson punched me in the stomach....CHEERS!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Excellent beers on tap. What more could you want in life? I've been here quite the number of times and always had something new and delicious to try."}
{"text":"Terrible service.. Food was mediocre and the staff were very unfriendly. I wanted to leave and I asked for the check 3 times and still nothing. I had to walk out of the establishment to get the attention of the waiter to give me the check. PATHETIC."}
{"text":"I've been to Aces and Ales twice now and I just don't get the hype. There are better, cheaper, nicer places for craft beer all over Vegas so there's no reason that you have to put up with this bar's poor service.

Most of the people here are terribly unfriendly. The waitress we had was so rude! She doesn't give a crap about making conversation, acknowledging you as a human being or even feigning that she doesn't hate her life. She made us so uncomfortable here and I felt very unwelcome! Completely ruined my experience at this bar. She didn't even know the beer menu, which is the absolute least I would expect from a waitress at a bar that's famous for it's beer selection. She needed a menu number when asked for a beer by name.

There's NO happy hour. That doesn't even register with me. I'm fine with paying $$ for a great craft beer but the amount of beer that they give you is tiny - not even a pint. I ended up paying $30 for 2 beers + mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was good but the portion of that was also really small and not worth the price."}
{"text":"Why haven't I found this place sooner? Stephanie promptly greeted us and sat us down. With so many choices she let us sample some of the many many beers they have on tap. Then recommended some great food to go with. My wife decided on the ahi and I did the steak nachos cooked really rare. Looking forward to the next beer fest."}
{"text":"It's gritty but it's great. Food is above average, guacamole is amazingly fresh and taste great. 

We've been here a bunch, tonight was first time with James serving us and he was amazing. Funny, prompt and did phenomenal enough for us to come review this place after coming here dozens of times."}
{"text":"What a cool place. Besides an amazing choice of beers, they have an amazing choice of food. I love the pizza. My wife loved the salmon, my daughter loved the ahi salad and my friend loved the prime angus burger. From misty the manager to Sharon and ari, the service is the best. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I love coming here, especially on football days. Stephanie is awesome. The food is awesome and great selection of beer."}
{"text":"OMG...the most awesome spinich, bacon salad ever!

I had the Cajun Mac n Cheese (cheddar and jack, andouille sausage, bell peppers, cajun spices)...the sausage and bell peppers were diced nice and small, so you get all the flavors in each bite.  Nicely done and oh-so-good.

My partner got the bbq burger, which may seem \"normal\", but she says it was AMAZING!

Ever want onion rings, but you take a bite and the onion pulls out of the ring leaving you holding just empty breading?  Well, theirs don't. \"those damn Arrogant Bastard onion rings\" were absolutely perfect....perfect bites of onion and batter each and every time.

Beer bites:  like good garlic knots you've had before, except for the A&A beer cheese they serve along with marinara & ranch to dip them in.  I would gladly substitue the other dips for three servings of that beer cheese...soooooo delicious.

We've been there in the evenings and on graveyard.  Both times food was equally fantastic, but we prefer the graveyard shift because there is less of a wait time.  Bartenders are always friendly and the A/C is nice and cool."}
{"text":"We always look for off strip places to watch football when we are in Vegas.  The craft beer selection at this place won us over.  So worth the quick 25 min drive.   TVs everywhere and we were able to watch all the games we were interested in.  The beer was great and the bartender, Kim, was so knowledgeable.  We both chose to flights and Kim created mine completely from the knowledge of the fact that unlike my husband I do not like IPAs.  It was hard to chose a favorite from my selection.  Kim also engaged us throughout our morning giving us tips of shows and other off strip establishments we had to visit.  She made the experience so amazing, that we returned on Sunday for football again.  The regular crowd was there, but the place wasn't packed and not smokey at all, which are huge pluses for an off strip location.  We did try the food on both occasions and enjoyed everything we tried.  I had the green apple, bacon, grilled cheese and my husband had the salami grilled cheese.  We also tried the cheese curds and the beer bites  (which was served with a beer cheese dipping sauce that I would ask for a double helping of!).  This would be our regular bar if we lived here and we would run through the food menu because everything was wonderful.  I highly recommend checking this place out.  Especially in the morning to early afternoon so you get Kim."}
{"text":"Very impressive craft beer menu, with decent prices. The food is top notch. I had no complaints about the service, like other reviewers. My service was good. The ambiance was a little lacking for my tastes...but a great place to watch a sporting event. The layout is set up for it perfectly. I also wish they would have had old standard beers on tap. Dos XX, Heinekin, or anything of the type would have made it 5 stars. Only craft beers are available. Its the only bar Ive ever been in that didnt have Bud on tap. Not that Ive ever ordered Bud at a bar...Im just saying."}
{"text":"We arrived about 3:30pm on Sunday May 13. The bartender on duty at that time was professional and courteous, a lovely gal!  The bartenders shift change happened at 4pm, and so did the  attitude!  The bartender that took over at 4pm was snarky, argumentative and flat out rude!  Not an asset to your business! I will also leave my comment on my bill in the tip section.  A person like this can really leave a negative impact on your business."}
{"text":"So disappointed! Not sure what was up but service was lacking and attention to detail was lacking. Drinks were served without being completed by bartender. We watched our food sit under the warming lights for at least 10 minutes and then we had to point out to our server our food was ready. We chose them because of good Yelp reviews. Don't believe everything you read."}
{"text":"Nice place with a good atmosphere.  The only concern we had was that our service was slow.  This wasn't our server Jena's fault at all.  She was as helpful as could be and had ALL of the restaurant bu herself!  The food took a good while to come out, but once it did, it was good.  I had the buffa-lucy burger and my wife had the \"it's too good burger\".  I took the homemade tortilla chips and salsa as my side.  The burgers were good and my wife's fries were good, but the homemade tortilla chips were not cooked properly.  Needed to be in the fryer longer..   We also had the crispy deviled eggs and they were delicious!  Would recommend it, but if there's only one server, be prepared to wait..."}
{"text":"Always has been a favorite! The management and staff have always been great and do whatever to keep you happy! There is not one bad food item on the menu and everything tastes so good it makes it hard to decide. Their Buffalo Mac and cheese is great, also a fan of their pretzel too. Also all the beer options will keep anyone satisfied."}
{"text":"I'm so in love with you, whatever you want to do, oh bathe let's stay together aces and ales!   Best bar food and tap list in town, locals always tourists will be corrupted in the best way.  5 star"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time on an amazon deal! Had great service and a great deal! Seated ourselves ... James was great.. Recommend a sweat beer for me that I loved. Husband for the nachos that he loved. Food was great. Beer was good. Husband didn't like his beer, #28 it was too bitter for his liking. But the deep fries Oreos made up for that. Also James put on the boston Red Sox game for us right in front of our table. Our amazon local deal was honored and a separate check was rang up for any extras we ordered. Overall we loved this place! We will definetly will come back! Great happy hour!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise to an evening that started off pretty rough. 

I had looked at this place's website a few times, but had never made it over here. Moving from Denver I can be a bit of a snob when some place tries to say that it brews beer plus I've been into bourbon lately so I wasn't sure if this place would really be what I was looking for. I had tried to go to a PT's (see previous review) and left because there was no working kitchen. I had my heart set on a burger and read on yelp that this place was good and they a good selection of bourbon. So I decided to head over.

I pull up and am a little worried as the neighborhood isn't THAT great, but I'm hungry so I go in anyhow. I walk in and I'm pleasantly surprised how clean it was. I found a nice table a bit away from the bar, get out my computer (I was there to work and eat) and grab a menu off the table next to me. The bartender was super friendly, came over, and got my drink order. When she brought that back we chatted a tad about a few menu items and under her suggestions I stuck with a burger.

The burger came out incredibly fast. It was big and juicy looking with homemade fries on the side. I have to say that this is the best burger that I've had in Las Vegas. The meat was good and flavorful, the fries were tasty, and the service was great. I have to say that this is now my new go-to place when I want to grab a drink and some food.

***03/01/2013***I've down graded my review after a TERRIBLE experience. I went in last night really just wanting some food and a drink. I walk in and it's pretty crowded so I find a table and sit down with my computer. I was ignored for about 15 minutes. When someone FINALLY came over she goes, \"Have  you been helped?\" I really wanted to say, \"Yeah, this invisible drink and food in my hand is really helpful.\" I ordered a drink and she then tells me, \"We have a party who has reserved this table in about 10 minutes.\" RUDELY. I then ask where I can sit. She tries to tell me I can sit at the bar, but I point out someone is smoking right there, she snobbishly goes, \"Yeah, the whole restaurant is smoking. We have a back room.\" I tell her never mind and she, with an attitude, goes, \"Well sorry then.\" I left. Little does the chick realize that I tip very well and drink well too. Oh well, I won't be back in a place that has their staff dress like sluts and treats people crappy. I don't care how much I liked their burger. It's in a sketchy part of town anyhow."}
{"text":"A&A (hmm....that's a bit too close to another acronym that's associated with ales...intentional?) has the right idea.  It's conveniently located for those of us in the NW part of town and offers a good selection of beers not found easily at other watering holes in town.  We came here on a Tuesday night, found seats in the patio area, and quickly found the ambience rather loud, largely due to the trivia night shenanigans going on inside.  Our group had to shout to \"communicate\" with each other; this was rather disappointing when we were all sitting at the same table.  It would have been nice if the PA system was off during our visit; we felt like we were forced to participate in the surround-sound trivia game because we literally could not escape it!  On the bright side, the food was good and service was pleasant and my company was congenial.  Beer prices seemed high; for instance, my husband ordered the Green Flash Stout, which came in a smaller-than-usual glass (not a full pint, perhaps half a pint?) and was $8 (before tip and tax).  I'll have to check out Tenaya Brewing Company up the street to compare brews and prices."}
{"text":"Came here for some beer cheese soup and it was just okay.  However, the beer and other food we had (can't remember, been awhile) was pretty awesome."}
{"text":"came here with a few buddies for the 'geeks who drink' pub quiz...every tuesday at 8pm, in case you were wondering.  i was pleasantly surprised when i walked in to quite a spacious dining area with a huge walk-in keg room, housing some pretty unique brews, right in the middle of it.  there are also a few refrigerated cases stocked with bottles to purchase and take home with you, if you so desire.  apparently their beer selection changes regularly so there will always be some good choices for you crafty beer drinkers out there.  

the food was ok.  typical bar food with a lot of fried food...beer battered everything.  this is not a bad pairing if you're coming to drink good beer.  we shared some zucchini chips which were just beer battered zucchini slices as well as the ahi tacos which was one of the few items that was not fried.  the items we sampled were not bad.

this is a great bar for those of you who are looking for good craft beers and a nice clean place to hang.  there's plenty of parking and plenty of seating inside if you're looking to bring a big group of people.  i think i would prefer if they had some bar activities, such as a pool table, shuffleboard, dart boards, foosball, etc.  other than eating and drinking, there's really nothing else to do here.  at least there's a pub quiz every tuesday at 8pm which is so much fun!"}
{"text":"Best beer bar, if you like craft beer. They run different events from time to time, like Stone Domination and the three day strong ale fest. Friendly place with no crap on tap."}
{"text":"Hubby found this place on yelp and wanted to check it out, since he's a huge beer snob.  We were impressed upon entering the establishment: very high ceiling, a trendy warehouse feel to the bar, and unpretentious bar staff.  Hubby had the Nogne O, which he quickly proclaimed to be the best beer he has ever drank.  I am not a beer drinker, but greatly enjoyed my ahi tuna sandwich (the wasabi mayo was lovely!).  I WANTED to try the deep fried oreos (what? what??), but I was too stuffed from my sandwich, piggie that I am.

I'm giving this place 4* because of the cig smoke.  Yes, yes, I KNOW that casinos are allowed to have smoke -- and Aces and Ales has a few electronic gambling machines -- but the smoke really bugs me.  Before all you smoky types tell me not to go to places with smoke, I will say: I normally avoid smoky places!  I wanted to support my hubby's fledgling yelp search and check out Aces.  We won't be back for a while, partly because of the smoke, but mainly because of how far it is from home (we live in the NW part of town, aka California....ha).  

Very impressed with the nice gal behind the bar.  :)"}
{"text":"A small group of us had a craft beer bottle share here.  The service was great.  The staff kept coming to make sure we were all doing well.  They kept making sure we were good with the food and also clearing out the table fast because we used up a lot of the space for our beer bottles.  Food was awesome and so was the service.  Thanks again for having us."}
{"text":"Have only been here once...  But, we'll definitely return.  Great selection of drafts and bottles.  Unique and tasty food!"}
{"text":"If you want to wait more that one hour four your order this is the place! And if you want to meet a owner that don't have any idea what is he doing this is the places! Good luck"}
{"text":"8.7.2016. 9pm I thought bars benefit from offering patrons another drink when their beer glasses are empty?

The waitress never offered to sell another drink when the drink glasses were visibly empty. Then finally after following her around the bar and asking for a drink #22 I think, she says ok I'll bring it. Sometime passes and waitress never comes back, so said waitress is asked about missing drink. Waitress replies \"oh we are out of that drink.\" And walks away.

Waitress is then tracked again to get drink. Probably will not be revisit this establishment since the Bartender wasn't too helpful but at least he was busy."}
{"text":"We were going to make a return trip to the Nellis location and then I noticed they have a 2nd one now, which was much closer to where we were staying.  On Sept 3rd we ventured over for an early dinner, and I was really impressed with their new space.  It's got high ceilings and a cool bar right in the middle with lots of taps, but still has that dark and relaxing feel to it that the other location has.

We started with the beer bites with a stout and a honey wheat beer.  Each of those were 5 bucks and really hit the spot.  Kimberly took great care of us and would frequently stop by just to see if we needed anything.

For the main meal I ordered the Mirror Pond brats, no bun, and Mr. M ordered the grilled cheese with green apple and bacon & onion rings for the side.  That grilled cheese and o rings were just as good as I remember.  5 stars!  And the brats were really delicious and full of flavor.  The kraut on the side seemed like it came from a can and was really bland.  I would challenge them to make some fresh kraut like the Germans do.  That would really make that meal.  

All in we spent $41 before tax and tip.  Not too bad at all.  I know there are many places I should try in Vegas, but every time we go back I have to visit Aces & Ales.  We always have a great time."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for work last week, and for the last night there I brought a coworker with me, we'll call him Mr. K, and explained that this might be the best beer bar he has ever been to.  I know.  I know.  That's a lot of build up.

The receipt said Wendy and Jeff, and if that's accurate, both of them took excellent care of us.  They are funny, friendly, and knowledgeable about beer.  I love them.  OK.  I don't LOVE them love them. I'm not a complete weirdo.

I was the DD so had to select my one drink very carefully.  I believe it was a New Belgium/Lost Abbey collaboration, Brett Beer.    I think this is supposed to be a sour ale, but it's not very sour.  I was calling it a farmhouse ale, but I don't think that's right.  I enjoyed it.  

I don't remember exactly what Mr. K had.  I do know that one of his beers was aged in Wild Turkey barrels and he liked that a lot.

Normally I am in awe of the beer, which is expected, but the food that night.  The food was amazing.  So simple yet so good.  I had the grilled cheese with cheddar, slices of apple, and bacon.  Need I say more?  Yes I do.  I also had the Arrogant Bastard onion rings, and when I forced one upon Mr. K, he said that was the best onion ring he has had in his life.  Yeah.  It's that good.

He ordered a pizza with I think shrooms and sausage and possibly pepperoni.  I forget, but I swiped a piece and it was very good.  The crust is not too thick, not too thin, just perfect.  Delicious with the beer.

Now I remember why my memory is so bad.  We were carbo overloading.  I've been thinking about the beer bites since the last time I was here and we started with those.  Just as good as I remember and I was happy to share since I knew we weren't done yet.

I love this place.  And I mean really love it."}
{"text":"Went on a double date night for a movie and dinner. Ended up here since our friends and we didn't have our babies and we hadn't been to Aces and Ales in about 2 years since the babies were born. The food was super disappointing. Everyone had something different and everyone was disappointed. There was only two wait staff for the restaurant and bar area. We sat for 45mins unattended after our food was delivered. My husband had to stand at the baby for 5 minutes trying to get attention for a box and our check. The beer list was not a variety of beer, mostly IPA's. The couple that weren't IPA's they were out of. Just a bad way to end date night. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Great place to take old friends! Service was good and the food was fresh and hot. Bomb Mac and cheese options and homemade pizzas. That with the bazilian beers on tap and life is good! Good get away spot after work."}
{"text":"Service at the bar here is always great,  tables can be hit or miss, but my last visit, new server Vanessa, was absolutely great! Food is a step up from normal bar fare and they have a ton of tvs and beer choices."}
{"text":"I am solely basing this review on the fact that the restaurant advertises themselves as a gastropub..... We drove 30 min off the strip to come here because it had great reviews, and were told we couldn't stay because we had our son with us and the establishment is 21 and over!! If that's the case advertise that on yelp and your website, and don't call yourself a gastropub as authentic gastropubs are kid friendly! My son has a very adventurous appetite and it's very upsetting we wasted our time to try and come here when it is so simple to let it be known NO KIDS ALLOWED!!!!"}
{"text":"I love coming to Aces &  Ales to get myself some good craft beer. Their on tap selection is always changing and they are more then willing to let you sample something before ordering it. Growler refills are always reasonably priced and worth it. A friend and I got a growler of Stone Vertical Epic 10.10.10 (IIRC) and it was great. I've had other growlers filled by them but that was the most memorable. Bartenders are always friendly and fast to help. 

I would suggest checking groupon as well if you are coming here as they usually have some kind of deal on there that will make your visit here even more awesome."}
{"text":"This place didn't disappoint, from reading the reviews about it and deciding to do a visit here. Since honestly, those who say the beer options can be a little limited near the Strip are right. It was a good stop to go to after Pinball Hall of Fame, since it made up for the fact that the beer options at some of the stores selling beer were often limited, save for some limited exceptions.

Didn't try the food(I'd like to next visit), but the service was friendly. I like how laid back it was, that you could play pool/billiards here if you wanted to in a side room, and that the ventilation was actually very, very decent for a smoking bar. It was the furthest from feeling like an overwhelmingly smoky bar, and they got the ventilation issue down correctly!

There are local city buses that do run out to this area too, both on Nellis Blvd. and Flamingo Road. Unlike some reviews I saw here, Tripadvisor, etc., the nearby area didn't feel creepy at all. I can see why some might be creeped out by seeing RVs and a trailer park, but it's fenced off from Nellis where it didn't bother me at all. I am more street savvy and watchful for dangers on streets vs. outside, so YMMV. Las Vegas' bus system does have a real time bus tracker, and there's a bus stop across the street so you can time walking leaving this bar, and catching the next bus on Nellis. There's a 24/7 Walgreens you can run into at Flamingo Rd/Nellis Blvd/Boulder Hwy, in case you have to kill time transferring to the Flamingo Rd bus, or vice versa."}
{"text":"My hubby and I stopped in yesterday out of curiosity. I have driven past this place a thousand times and finally decided to check it out. It's a very casual spot and plenty of seating and t.v.s to enjoy sports . The server Mitch was AMAZING!!! The beer choices put me on overload. So much to choose and so little time! Mitch was extremely knowledgeable and listened to our particular tastes in beer and wow! So on point! We went during happy hour so drinks and food were $2 off each. We ordered pulled pork fries, bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers, onion rings, and wings. The food was cooked to perfection and the portion sizes were much larger than we anticipated. We had to take most of it home. The best part about the visit was that we bought a growler,my first exposure to an awesome idea, of a dark stout beer and left with full tummies and BEER! I will definitely return to this location and look for Mitch. He knows A LOT about good beer!"}
{"text":"We were contacted by Management and my Husband spoke with the Gentleman. The Manager watched the surveillance, and we were told that we actually were sitting there 10 mins before someone thought about helping us. He even agreed this was unacceptable, and even had the server/bartender watch the video. Even one of their \"regulars\" as the Manager stated, made the situation worse
. 
He had my Husband send our names and address, promising he would accomidate us with drink tickets etc...  

We still have yet to receive those, and we have never been back since this ordeal. What a joke, a big let down. If youre gonna try and right a wrong, hold up to what you agree to do."}
{"text":"I bought a groupon today and decided to use it with my gf for lunch , it was close to house and yelp reviews were decent i guess ....  an empty parking lot is usually not a good sign at lunch time but I said ok maybe just a slow day , our waitress was really good and thats all good I have to say , I got the juicy lucy , although it was a HUGE burger , they put chorizo in the middle and it totally over powers the flavor of the burger , the onion rings were so f\gross and greasy I asked for a refund beacuse they charge extra for them and I couldnt even eat them , my friend got the steak sandwhich , it was small and tasteless she said , i tried a few of her fries and they were mediocre at best , I would not go there again."}

They were also asked by someone \"How do they feel being there \"? WTF does that mean ? It is 2017 and that type of behavior is absolutely disgusting ! The owner should be ashamed of having emplyees who treat PAYING customers with that much disrecpect ! Zero Stars for your shitty staff and customer service ! Will never come back if you paid me to !"}
{"text":"We only drank here, so this is a review that just wishes to pay it's respects to this place that brings a much-needed injection of great Craft Beer to Vegas.  Vegas is way behind the curve when it comes to the craft beer movement but this place goes a long way towards righting that.  Impressive selection, a mighty book-ful of great beers both on draft & in bottles.  Great place to watch a game, too."}
{"text":"I am a regular here and go here all the time and looooooove it. 

The food is delicious and there's always a rotating list of beers going around to make you a classy beer connoisseur. 
We are friends with many of the servers here and know them all by name. 

The strong beer night, we came around 8:30 and there were glasses still available. Obviously, it was a busy night and the servers were swamped, so patience is required when there are multiple parties and tons of people demanding their beer and delicious food immediately. Some people here need to relax. ;p"}
{"text":"Awesome food, good beer but awful service.First off we ordered waters along with our beers asked for them 3 times when we did finally get them she slammed them down very rudely then as she was walking away she said oh did you guys want food, second I ordered a beer my friends beers came but not mine I assumed it was on its way after a long wait for the waitress to came back I asked about the beer her reply was \"sorry I forgot to tell you we were out of that beer\" so I ordered another beer which did not come right away as I believe it should have, third my friend ordered a beer but it was clearly not the right beer, after trying to hunt down our waitress yet again my friend decided to hunt down the manager.(let it be known that we came on a Sunday and there was only one other patron sitting at the tables in the bar section where we were located, so being busy wasn't the issue) The manager came out to rectify the bad service and we thought everything was better but then she left without explaining things to her waitress; therefore she didn't know about the comped items so we had to deal with that when the bill came. This place is new and therefore the staff is probably new so we will try again but not a good first impression."}
{"text":"A friend & I had lunch here March 25 or 26, 2017 (can't recall which day).  We had a sub called a French dip.  The meat tasted of good quality, served on a sub roll w/au jus and good, piping hot French fries.  Service was prompt and the sandwich was a nice size.  Priced at $14, as the meat was so flavorful, I think it was well worth it.  We sat in the dining area.  There is a bar area.  There are TVs all around and it appears to be a sports bar.  Private parking lot."}
{"text":"Aces and Ales is THE spot in Vegas for serious beer drinkers!

They have an above average menu of delightful eats...ranging from comfort to foodie in nature.  But the real reason to come here is for one of the best beer lists in the Valley!

Don't come here looking for great Happy Hour specials...don't stop in just to have a Bud Light, but do come here to satisfy your inner beer snob.  Aces & Ales also has a knowledgeable wait staff, that does a decent job in the customer service department as well.

Lots of beers that you can't get anywhere else in Vegas...plus, Tap Takeovers!"}
{"text":"Would give this place zero stars if I could.  Come here if you love a side of ashes with your beer and wings. We sat in the restaurant part of the place and had the unfortunate luck of being seated by a couple that chain smoked the whole time. It was disgusting.  When the issue was brought up to the staff, we were told that patrons could smoke where they want. This place has lost our business.
P.S. Looked up the law. Any stand-alone bar or restaurant  that serves food is supposed to be non-smoking. Someone please call the health inspectors!"}
{"text":"I'm always surprised this place isn't packed at lunch.
Today I got the House Mac and Cheese, because it sounded nice for a hangover. Oh, man is it good. But everything here is always good AND home made. Plus they have a huge assortment of beer, which I can't enjoy because I'm on lunch break. 
They just recently came out with a lunch special. For $8 you get a soda, entree and side. They're all full sized, and the most popular items. 
The reason I came to review them though, had nothing to do with the food. It's all about a GREAT waitress, Sharon. She is so nice, always cheerful. But attentive as all get out, and quick with anything you need. Really, the waitress makes the restaurant, and she makes this place my go to when Im not brown bagging it."}
{"text":"Ate for the first time here last night and the food is awesome!!! Brew was excellent as well!!! Bartender was knowledgable and super friendly. We may be back today for lunch!!  ;) i dont know what the dip was that they serve with the garlic knots but i think it may be laced with crack..... Seriously addicting!!! Good stuff!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the experience. Quality food and drinks with a large selection. Equally as important was the fantastic service we received. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great service great beers! Check the tap list online before you one in they switch it up often."}
{"text":"What a fun place!

Aces & Ales has a beer snob's selection of drafts and bottles worthy of your attention!  Additionally they have a lot of great Bourbon, Rye, and Scotch.  This is not a snobby place though.  It is down-to-earth and equipped for a good time with your friends.  I'm pretty sure that a gastro pub got it on with a mid-west locals bar and sprung off Aces & Ales!

I didn't try a lot of food while I was there, but not because I didn't want to.  I had the Buffalo Mac-N-Cheese and loved it!  The food looked like a lot of great foodie, comfort food...stuff I would love to come back and taste, while motivating me to go to the gym the next day!

Come here for Great beer!
Come here to play pool and bar games with your friends!
Come here for tasty comfort food!"}
{"text":"Came to X107.5 best damn drink night. Jennilee was super cool and totally knew what beer to suggest for my boyfriend and I! Awesome! We will be back!"}
{"text":"After reading my original review, the ownership of this establishment contacted me and made it right.  I am very pleased with their response and look forward to going back.  Thank you."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the Vegas area with many different craft beers on tap. They do different events during the year that are worth checking out."}
{"text":"Didn't try the food but the beer is EXPENSIVE.  Prices that rival the Strip.  Decent \"atmosphere\", but they do have indoor smoking which stinks."}
{"text":"Measure drinks and doesn't comp when you gamble. If you are going to charge me at least give a decent pour. One thing about Vegas is they aren't required to measure and exact shot. Thanks crystal won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Great beer selection, tasty food and excellent prices. I especially recommend the truffle fries and buffalo chicken mac n cheese."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely horrible. DO NOT GET PIZZA! Or the Buffalo Chiken Wrap. Both were straight garbage. The staff was friendly and the place wasn't bad if you are going for drinks...just don't order food. 
I hate saying never but I will never go back there."}
{"text":"This place is just awesome! Good beer selection and food variety, the too good burger is a must!!! And they have countless of beers on tap!!!"}
{"text":"My first time at this bar, I was very please with their service,  how attentive the server was, willing to let me try samples of beer.(since I'm not muchof a beer drinker) Order food - guacamole and chips which I was told they make as you order freshly -tasted awesome!! I will definitely go back for their food and service!"}
{"text":"I've decided to give this a few more chances. I really enjoy the food when it's good, but there seems to be some inconsistency. I hope this gets sorted out because the food really is delicious... and they have cheese curds. I had three bad orders in a row, but the past two weeks the food has been wonderful."}
{"text":"Move over Yard House, there is a new kid in town... and he actually knows something about beer.  Well, Aces and Ales (a locally owned business) isn't new in town, but this new location is definitely the best beer bar in town.  As a fan of the Nellis location, how does it stack up?

Well, the interior is about 2-3 times as big and is much classier.  The atmosphere has the feel of an upscale San Diego beer bar.  Plenty of new lush seating, lots of TV's at the bar, and even a sweet looking patio and fireplace outside give this place a totally new and refreshing feel for Aces and Ales.  

When I first heard about the second location and the 50 taps, I feared that Ryan, the co-owner, wasn't going to be able to live up to the original locations rotating tap selection.  I mean, Aces on Nellis is well known as Greg Koch's favorite beer bar in Vegas (CEO of Stone Brewing) and for good reason.  You will find fine craft beer from all over the world that you won't find in other Vegas bars (including Yard House, Public House, Burger Bar, etc).  As a beer geek, Aces 2 has recreated that great beer selection with double the amount.  With a rotating tap selection, there will always be different beers at Aces.  Today the menu ranged from Epic Brewing's Sour Apple Saison, to Nectar Ales Black Xantus, to Ballist Point Habanero Sculpin IPA.   There are bottles of Parabola, most years of Stone's Verticle Epic Series, and The Bruery's special releases.  Each and every single beer on the 50 tap menu is a craft beer, and many of them are hard to find special releases.  Finally, a bar that beer nerds in Vegas can be proud of.  

I had the Juicy Lucy for lunch, and it was pretty awesome.  Just as good as the old location.  The beef was nice and juicy with a perfect amount of stuffed cheese and applewood bacon.  The bar is less than a week old, so they are still working out the kinks in the kitchen and getting the patio installed.  The service was top notch, just like the old Aces, except a lot more staff.  Our waitress Kimberly was very attentive and did a great job.      

Overall I am extremely happy that Aces and Ales has opened a larger, classier, craft beer bar on my side of town.  If you are into craft beer, unless you are willing to drive 5 hours west, it doesn't get any better than this."}
{"text":"Service was amazing from Stepfanie and food was awesome! I come here every few months and love the beer, food and service. Seriously I love it here it's fun and just chill. Bring back habanero beer pls."}
{"text":"My new favorite spot for beer drinking has just been found.  As you may or may not know I enjoy great beer.  No Bud, Miller, or Coors for me.  Real beer is not light yellow when it pours. Just saying!  Aces & Ales has at least 40 taps of all micro and craft beers.  Every style of beer is available Stouts, Barleywine, Lagers, and of course IPA's.  I was totally impressed with their beer selection.  Another great feature is that they also carry rare and expensive Lambics and Gueuze in large magnum size bottles.  These types of beers you can cellar like a fine wine and have their flavors improve overtime.  I cannot wait to get a large group together for a tasting at this place.  

My friend and I ordered some food at the bar while we were sipping the delicious brews.  He had what looked to be a delicious burger that was stuffed with all kinds of spicy stuff like jalapenos and pepperjack cheese.  I went a different route with the fish and chips.  When I received my order I was slightly disappointed with the portion that was delivered.  Two 6oz chunks was all that was brought so I inquired about the portion.  The bartender expressed her concerns with the portion and offered to bring out more with a charge I found out later.  We were able to resolve the issue in an  amicable manner.  Kim was a great and friendly bartender.  The food was decent.  however I will be back for the 5 star beer of course.  Many of there recipes seemed to incorporate beer in some form or fashion in the menu descriptions.  Very nice.  I will be back and hope to organize a big drink fest since this palce is open 24 hours. Sunday they have all taps on special for only $5.00."}
{"text":"I've noticed that I've only given Aces and Ales 4 stars.  Shame on me.  This is the best craft bar in Vegas.  What other place gets Deschutes Jubelale, seriously?  Even craft beer nerds from San Diego or Portland would be at least moderately impressed with Aces.  Sure, the atmosphere leaves something to be desired.  It does sort of feel like a dive bar.  But the craft beer selections here are the best that Vegas sees.  From Port Brewing to Double Dry Hopped Stone IPA to Belgian sour beers, Aces is the place for the true beer nerd.  

The food has also improved since my last review.  I love the salads.  Try the Tuna Ahi Salad or even just the Caesar.  Awesome stuff.  If you don't like healthy food, the rest of the menu will definitely give you a delicious heart attack... at least you will die happy!  

It is worth mentioning that Aces has events almost every weekend.  For example, the owner of Stone, Greg Koch, seems to visit annually.  Other great breweries that are new to the Vegas market take over the taps at Aces to offer their finest selections.  Parking can be a PITA though, so be prepared to park behind the gas station out back (not in front!).  SNAFU, the local homebrew club also has their monthly meetings here.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying I'm a mature woman who just wanted to have a nice time at a bar . This was my first time at this bar and I walked in with my friend who is black, ( I am Asian ). We politely asked for two shots of Hennessy and the bartender said - with attitude \" Nope, we don't carry it !\" So I asked if the have Courvoisier , when she rudely and unnecessarily replied \" Nope ! Not that kind of bar!!\"  I really want to know what that's supposed to mean . Every bar should carry each type of alcohol . So just because black people typically drink cognac you don't carry it ? That  was a completely racist and unnecessary comment  . I definitely won't be going back and I wouldn't suggest anyone of color to go either if you're wanting to have an enjoyable time ."}
{"text":"Visited on vacation because we had a groupon. Nice place, great atmosphere, excellent service. Beer was pricey, but I'd assume the prices were in line for the quality. I had the Mediterranean mac n cheese, Yum! Wife had the arrogant bastard steak salad, excellent for a salad. Would have been okay paying full price, will be back next next trip."}
{"text":"We've been here twice, once for lunch on a weekday and once for Monday Night Football. Both times, the service was absolutely terrible! It takes forever to get a drink and the last time we came, the server forgot to put our food order in so we waited for almost an hour for a pizza and onion rings. If they could put a better staff together, this place would be awesome!"}
{"text":"This was a nice relaxing spot for a lunch break. The buger was good, fries were too salty, but the onion rings....OMG THOSE WERE SO GOOD! And I HATE onions! But with that batter I couldn't even taste the onions. Would stop in again."}
{"text":"This place amazing. Jenni and Kim treated us right recommending tasty Stouts' IPA and Ales to drink along with some devilishly good Spaghetti pizza. Very chill atmosphere and the music was perfect and allows you to actually have a conversation with someone. If you are looking for a great local spot away from the chaos of the Las Vegas strip, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Aces & Ales. We went for dinner about 5PM on a Thursday night.  Our waitress was Nicole and she was very friendly. We went with a Groupon. However, the Groupon stated it was for 4 or more, so we were unable to use the entire $60.00. They did let us use it for the amount it was purchased for. 
We ordered the regular nachos as an appetizer, the caprese grilled cheese sandwich and the arrogant bastard steak sandwich as our entrees and a beer each. Everything was good. We really enjoyed the atmosphere. As the Broncos/Chiefs game began, it started to fill up pretty quick. 
It seemed like a fun place to stay and watch the game but we had to leave right after dinner."}
{"text":"Ladies and gents, I can attest without hesitation that all the good reviews about Aces & Ales are true. It would be superfluous to underline the same noteworthy qualities this unique bar has, but as the saying goes, \"repetition is the mother of learning\", so here goes: 
 
Off the beaten path location that only adds to charisma of the place...check! Extremely knowledgeable and friendly staff...check! Hearty choices of food perfect to accompany beer...check! But, first and foremost...prime and diverse selection of craft beers that you can't find anywhere else in Las Vegas...double check! 

As the incomparable Shakespeare would say \"A quart of Ale is a dish for a King!\" and this adage does not go to waste at Aces & Ales! 

However, all things being equal, I want to add something that has not been previously mentioned. From my own point of view, the secret weapon of Aces & Aces lies with the magnificent server Debra. When there was no food, she personally served us her amazing stuffed artichokes! They are so unequivocally succulent and sinfully delicious that they should definitely be on the menu! When our glasses were almost empty, she was quick to suggest other beer options based on our previous choices! When we felt like sharing stories, she was a perfect listener. Debra was attentive without being intrusive, the most distinctive quality a bartender should possess. She made us feel at home without being regulars! I have to give this shout out to her because she made the whole afternoon truly wonderful for us!  

When you go to Aces & Ales, you get more than a buzz, you get an unforgettable and unique Las Vegas experience. Was it Edgar Allan Poe that said:\"What care I how time advances, I am drinking ale today\"? Well, I say, \"What care I how time advances, I am drinking at Aces & Ales today!\""}
{"text":"We were pleasantly surprised we had the party room the service was great the food was outstanding in the room was just perfect for a small party or large party but they really work with you on getting everything together what a great place in the beer selections amazing"}
{"text":"After being a long time vistor to the other Aces across town I was over the moon when this location opened! Chef Jason is a master at making my tastbuds do the happy dance. From tastie bites to accompany my beer on TNT night,  to my gotta stop and have that Caesar salad moments. The staff starting with Misty couldn't be more knowledgeable on the ever changing
taps, the new additions to the Aces family on this side of town will catch up. All of these moments that one may have to endure waiting for items just gives me morw time to spend tasting my craft beer. Once again I love, love, love this bar. They will be around for a long time and that makes me very happy!"}
{"text":"First time going all that way for some craft beer I have been reading bout for some time now. Was greeted by some of the nicest bartenders, and servers! Nachos are huge and the sweet potato fries where perfect! I loved all my craft beers and can't wait to make the drive out there again! That's my kinda bar!"}
{"text":"Great bar, if you love beer this is a must visit bar for you. They constantly rotate taps. Misty is the best bartender and will take care of you. The food is high quality especially for a bar. Come on Sunday for half off growler fills."}
{"text":"Love this place, great beer cool bartender (Jenni) and pool tables. I love the Ahi tuna sandwich with sweet patato fries. Also try the stone arrogant bastard chilli fries. They rotate the taps often so get on the e mail list."}
{"text":"Food is so-so. For craft beer, this is probably the go to spot in Vegas whether you live there or are just driving through. My first two choices were 86'd, so that was kind of a bummer. I did try the Bad Beat beers and the Port Brewing IPA's. Not bad. Pub trivia on Wednesdays. Tons of bottles for sale."}
{"text":"Basically my dream bar. A divey locals hideout, a bajillion craft beers to choose from (though be warned, they don't always have every bottle listed in stock), a very decent tequila and scotch menu, and an EXCELLENT food menu. Great music playing all the time.

$4 draft beers and 1/2 off Mac&Cheese during Hoppy Hour (M-F 4pm-6pm, 12am-6am) and they always have a ton of specials going on. The food is some of the best bar food I've ever had. Cheese balls, grilled cheese, Arrogant Bastard chili fries, burgers, mac and cheese (I obviously really like cheese), etc. etc.

$1 games of pool. The tables and cues aren't in the best shape but it's $1/game so....... 

And, of course, there are plenty of TVs around the bar to watch the game of your little heart's choosing. The bartenders are very accommodating as well."}
{"text":"Good food, but bad service. Suggest sitting at the bar if you want the have more than one drink."}
{"text":"This place is the best beer place in Las Vegas. If you like good craft beer go here. It is worth the trip off the strip. 

We came here and ordered a few different beers. The taplist was very impressive. My wife beer cheese soup and a grilled cheese sandwich. I had the arrogant bastard cheese balls. I really liked eating here. Also the tap list is amazing! I mean, there is nothing else like it in vegas. 

If you a beer person you absolutely must drink here."}
{"text":"Service was amazing!!  We sat in the bar and she took really good care of us. The food was good. Fun place to stop at. We will return. We had the steak sandwich and french dip and both were great!"}
{"text":"I want to love this place so bad! If I had to sum up my review: men are more than welcome here, ladies take your business elsewhere. 

Food is good, beer selection is awesome. My three star deduction is because the customer service is horrible. Usually I come in, sit at the bar, put some money in machine, start gambling and it's at least ten minutes until I'm acknowledged. This is because the bartenders are usually flirting with the patrons and/or the staff. 

Usually when I go to a bar, I like to gamble and usually a few drinks get comped in exchange. Nope, not here. My friend and I put in a combined $150 one night and only had ONE $5 drink comped each...seriously?! Meanwhile, I told my guy friends about this place, they came in, gambled and had all their drinks comped AND were given drink coupons. This drove me nuts since they wouldn't have even come to this place if it wasn't for me. 

At my most recent visit I gambled, had some dinner and two drinks with a friend. They comped one drink on my bill and I left. Then my friend informs me later that they comped one of his drinks...mind you, he wasn't even gambling! I don't get it. 

I've worked in the industry for the past few years and I definitely won't be frequenting this place any time soon. Customer service is everything and it's definitely lacking at this establishment."}
{"text":"Frikkin Awesome place, however we couldn't stay because this place is 21+ and my hubby has a couple months to go.  Glad I asked the waitress before she did.

Totally kewl with having to leave, not to worry we will be back in April.

Atmosphere is great if your into the kick ass pub scene and super friendly staff.  

Will write about the food and drinks when we go back.  But please, support this place, it is wicked awesome."}
{"text":"They play sports and serve tons of beer with happy hour ALL DAY Sunday. The food is good and the beer is better. They also have a nice patio area on my side of town (Summerlin) which sets its apart from other similar places in my opinion."}
{"text":"I am so torn, I use to love this place especially the patio.  The onion rings were fantastic and so many beers on tap was like being a kid in a candy store.   I took some friends in that have never been.  The onion rings tasted like the oil in the fryer was old.  I told our waitress she took it back no problem, poor think the place was packed and the cooks were taking a long time.  Then our pizzas came out a hour later burned we told the manager and he said it our perspective that he didn't think it was.... um the crust was black I personally have burned enough food to know!!!!! We were all too hungry at that point to wait another hour for any dish out of that kitchen...
I will never recommend Aces n ales..."}
{"text":"Sharon( I hope I have her name right) was our server.  No problem with slow service!  She was very attentive and friendly.  Our drinks were promptly refilled and our food was served at the proper temperature.  We started with the cheese curds.  I prefer A & A's over the \"the other cheese curd place.\"  The breading is just right, not so heavy.
I had the bacon- avocado- turkey sandwich.  Oh yum!  You will not be disappointed.  My husband had the pastrami and swiss on grilled rye.  The meat was very tender and tasty.  He
was very pleased.  Overall the quality of our food was top notch.

Nice atmosphere, although I wish they had a table or two with chairs instead of bar stools.

We are looking forward to many return visits.  Anxious to try the beer tastings!

We were happy to find a new favorite place.  Try it, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This new location looks great inside and out! So much nicer than the other location on nellis, and its closer to home. It also has a dining/restaurant section so you don't have to eat right in the bar area. 

Now here's where things take a turn for the worse...
The food is nowhere near as good as the other location. We have been to the other location a number of times and each time was awesome.  
This particular visit we had the juicy Lucy and it was anything but juicy. It was more like plainy janey.  The bun has been changed. Not enough cheese. The meat was falling apart. Just blah. 
The jalapeño grilled cheese was short on the cheese and heavy on the peppers. Seemed kind of dry. Needs more cheese please.  
The tomato basil soup was great! Good consistency and awesome flavor. 
Our server Linsey was super nice and friendly. Very attentive and polite."}
{"text":"I've ordered the \"Eddie spaghetti pizza\" to go several times in the past. It's one of my favorites. Tonight was a disappointment though. Clearly burned crust on half the pizza, the middle seemed soggy, and certain spots tasted overly salty. The quality just seemed to have gone down overall. Sadly, I don't think I'll be getting this again."}
{"text":"Got dragged in here by John R. because he had a coupon from work for \"Medical Workers Appreciation\". It stated 20% off entire bill and also free craft beer OR appetizer. 

Upon entering, we seated ourselves right away. Learned my lesson last time, no one will seat you.. You just gotta seat yourselves. We got here at 12am thinking it was happy hour. Unfortunately HH is Mon-Fri 12am. And it was technically 12am Saturday. Which was a bummer! Because all speciality cocktails were $5 during HH. 

This place is so cold. Like freezing! So bring a light sweater. Our server (totally spaced on the name) took about 15 minutes to acknowledge us. We told her about the coupon. She said we can't use it. We were pretty shocked. The only reason we decided to give this place another chance was because of the coupon and happy hour. So that's 2 strikes already. 

We were already here so we decided to order food. Food took FOREVER to come. Just like last time. The beau ordered steak and eggs. The server didn't even ask him how he liked his steak or eggs cooked! Food was ok, the beau really liked how the steak was cooked. It had a good flavor to it. 

Probably will never come back."}
{"text":"The beer (if they are able to bring you one) is great here but that is about it. The waitstaff are always busy so the service is slow and not very pleasant. I have ordered the soft tacos, onion rings, pizza, and some other appetizers. They seem to lack seasoning and just don't leave me wanting more. There are better options available."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers kinda overwhelming though but still good for people who like variety a little something for every taste. food was excellent but we waited a while for it which was my only complaint service was ok friendly bartender. We had the chicken fingers (3) and cheese curds witch were bomb."}
{"text":"Cool staff, fun environment for locals to come. The food was good and they even give free samples for you to try drinks. Come check them out if you never been to this location"}
{"text":"Great place with a great beer selection and food.  My wife and I split a burger and a grilled cheese and both were awesome.  The bar had a relaxed vibe to it.  It was a great place to watch sports, enjoy a selection of excellent beer and have some good food.   

Id recommend this place to any of you who are looking for good beer in this town.  The taps are great, but I also noticed rare beer you can buy by the bottle in fridges when you walk in.  I'm not sure how it works in Nevada, but at worst you should be able to pop the bottle open and enjoy the beer at the bar.  Maybe they might let you buy them to go, but I can't say that for sure."}
{"text":"Love this place. Food is delicious and the beer selection is so varied and adventurous! Not a huge fan of the communal seating the dining area, but we usually go when it's not too busy. The service has been hit or miss in that  sometimes the food comes out quickly and other times it takes way too long. But the servers have always been friendly."}
{"text":"Not sure if I'm capable of writing this review but this place is great.    It probably has the best selection of beers I have seen in a long time.  The hawt waitress Genna gave great recommendations.  But be warned ,the cream ape will hit ti


Great service. Great ambiance.  Great food. It was just a comfortable experience 

Thanks Jenna for a great time"}
{"text":"Fantastic food, fantastic service, fantastic refreshments, extensive beer list, and well versed staff. What's not to love?!"}
{"text":"Good beer for sure. Many beers on tap. Very loud sports bar. Also allows smoking which is a deal breaker for me."}
{"text":"Love this place so much! Been here for everything.. Breakfast Beers, Late night drinks and Trivia Night!  The girls we've had for service too!! Kaylie and Danielle are such amazing ladies!!"}
{"text":"This has become my favorite bar in town. Been coming here for years. Staff has always been friendly and helpful. They have a huge selection of beer on tap that rotates weekly! Plus weekly trivia nights and karaoke. What more could you want?! If you end up stopping by say hi to Nicole, Kim, Matt, Krystal, and Steph! They are awesome"}
{"text":"This is a great place...now if only they had a smoke free area I would give it a 5* rating.  

Very friendly helpful staff (Wendy) great beers on tap...had a Karsteen Rouge....mmmmm a nice sweet cherry flavored beer and a burger $10, who can complain about that?

Plus, I played the video poker machine and actually made $1, yahoo!  

I am really glad this is close to home.  It's a great  find."}
{"text":"Awful service. One waitress was more interested in socializing rather the making the bar more money or tips. 

Came in with a group of 5 people. Ready to spend. Difficult to get the waitress attention and when we finally verbalized our order, waitress litterally walked away mid sentence an disappeared. 

After finally bringing out the food order waitress dropped the drinking from table top onto one our friends laps. She quickly threw towels on her lap and ran off to get a new drink. After minutes of waiting we took a look around for the waitress with the replacement drink. Found her socializing. After she saw us walking up to the manager she quickly ran across the to refill the drink and hurried up to hand it to us in front of the manager."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service with a phenomenal beer selection. Tons of TV's so every seat has a clear view.  Solid fries and meaty wings."}
{"text":"Great selection of beer. My husband has tried so many beers over the years. But this place had a bunch he'd never tried. And their food is fantastic!  They make their own sauces -- bbq sauce is so good and honey mustard salad dressing. Had the French dip and onion rings - fantastic. Husband had fried cheese curds which he said were very tasty. Friendly and quick service. Just a nice laid back pub."}
{"text":"I love the casual atmosphere of this beer heaven.  The food is tasty and the diversity of hard-to-find beers is fantastic.  The bartenders are knowledgeable and will help you explore if you're game.  There is no pretentious snobbiness like you sometimes find with some of the other multi-tap gastro pubs around town, which adds to the good vibe.  I just wish they were closer.  The location tucked in back of Sam's Town is kind of out of the way but it's worth a visit and it's probably the reason why it is so chill."}
{"text":"Where to begin. I go to the west side location often and this location is the total opposite. My party and I went here due to our normal Sunday football bar being full so decided to try here. This location is a lot darker than the Westside spot. I had to use my phone light just to see the menu. We asked the waitress to change the game on the tv facing us to our teams game. She didn't know how to change the channels and asked if we could just watch it on the tv facing the other direction. After a few moments she figured out the tv and got it on. We ordered the pretzels and chicken tenders. The pretzels were ok, the chicken tenders (best in town according to our waitress) were horrible. They were way over cooked and had a weird taste. I excepted more out of Aces and Ale food. During our meal the waitress had to come over our heads and grab a beer tab on the wall above us. Nothing more annoying then having to stop eating to more for that, along with the dust falling all over us and our food. After that we got our $25 check and left to watch the games at the casino. We couldn't wait to leave. Worst sports bar I've ever been to."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best \"Beer Bar\" in Vegas.  Always the most exclusive tap selection due to the owners relationship with Deschutes, Stone, Speakeasy and others... and for $6/pint, it's actually a great deal!

Food options are custom to beer pairings, bartenders are somewhat beer savvy, but are more their for \"looks\"... gaming options available, shuffleboard, billiards and jukebox."}
{"text":"I came to this location for a holiday work party get together. I am not a really big beer drinker, but I did appreciate all the dedication A&A puts in to providing its customers with a wide variety of beers. I chose an apple cider beer and it was very good and refreshing. I liked how the bar was separate from the dining area. It made it feel almost like 2 different places. A dark and quiet bar on one side and a bright airy dining room on the other side. There is a back room for parties and a patio for some fresh air.
The menu provides a wide variety of choices to chose from, salads, pizza, sandwiches, appetizers, main dishes. Our group loved the pizza, burgers, and wraps. They do offer mixed drinks and wine if beer is not your friend. I am not a huge sports fan but I was kept entertained by the numerous TVs mounted. 
The wait staff did seem a bit frazzled and skipped over some of us in the party. Food took a while to come out and drinks were not refilled as often as I think they should have been and orders were mixed up as to who they went to when they came out but we were a party of almost 20 so that could have factored in to their confusion. 
I hope to come back to try some more of their menu items and another cider beer."}
{"text":"My husband and I went last night with a couple of our friends...it was a TERRIBLE!! Avoid at all cost!! My husband has a peanut allergy when we ask about there food it took 15mins for a response. When ordering beer they didn't know what they had everything had to be a #or didn't know what it was. My friend ordered 2 beer and the girl came back with 1, we told her we had ordered 2 beers we were missing one she comes back with 2 more!! Another friend food was wrong and late!! The only + is the tv's!! The food is average nothing great. This place has potential but the staffing needs retraining or all in all new staff. Very disappointing"}
{"text":"So, I think that Aces & Ales needs to decide what kind of bar it wants to be.

I love the food and the craft beers but everything else pretty much sucks. The service is usually geared towards the \"regulars\" so if you are not one...good luck. Not that they are mean or rude or anything, they just shrug you off a bit.

When I was there on a Tuesday evening, it was mostly video poker players and their free Bud/Miller/Coors Lights. Maybe because you can't get comp'ed for craft beers? Is this a craft beer bar or just another creepy video poker bar?

Lastly, I realize I am biased being a non-smoker, but I don't see how you can enjoy the great food and great craft beers with chain smokers all around you. Maybe I missed the \"less\" smokey area?

To summarize, they have great food and craft beer but the environment very much distracts from this."}
{"text":"My husband Tony and I performed a wedding at Aces and Ales this Saturday. The manager Austin and his team were flawless in their customer service and professionalism. The ceremony was on the patio with a gorgeous fireplace. The reception was held in the private dining room. We had meatballs, veggie tray and cheese curds as appetizers. It was delicious! Ceasar salad, chicken breast, and alfredo for entree. Everything tasted great! The wedding was spectacular and perfect. The dining room had enough room for the DJ and dancing. Our business, Perfect Unity Ministry, highly recommends Aces and Ales for all occasions; even Weddings!"}
{"text":"Tried this place because of Groupon. 

The beer selection was amazing, if you're into craft beers and not the usual American variety. Staff was very nice and friendly. I had a Pizza that was HUGE and very very tasty! For dessert my gf and I shared the Fried Oreos with Ice Cream - what a guilty indulgence. It was very tasty.

The ambiance is not top notch, very no frills and kinda gives off a \"biker bar\" feel. However the staff and tasty food more than makes up for it!"}
{"text":"They have an awesome beer menu! The food is also pretty good, their Mac N' Cheese dishes are delicious. The service is also pretty good! If you love beer, this is a good place to go!"}
{"text":"Weird how your arms stick to the tables in there but they say its the veneer finish not spilled dry beer. Decent food huge beer selection. Good location."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty damm good.  I was real suprised with their Seared Ahi Asian Salad.  Hamburger was grilled perfectly and paired with the right toppings. 

Their pizzas are great value with good happy hour specials.  The Eddie Spaghetti is a combination of eating spaghetti and pizza.  It's a massive carb overload.  They should have an eating contest if someone can eat the whole thing.  It's filling - after 2 slices i get the meat sweats.

So why 3 stars?  Well the service is pretty bad.  We try to grab a table right by the kitchen.  After watching my friend wait for her pretzel app on the food line for 5-10 mins, I took more initiative and grabbed my salad from the line.  I talked to the chef and asked him for sides of ranch b/c our server was no where in site.  I felt like I was part NFL playoff spectator, part time customer, and part time expediter.  I bet they wouldnt even notice if i jacked a couple plates of food and pulled a 5 finger!

Food is great but dont expect 5 star service!"}
{"text":"Beer = Awesome
Veggie Burger = Awesome
Helen the Bartender = Awesome

So nice to have a bar right by my house where it's laid back and customer service is on point!
Aces and Ales is where it's at!"}
{"text":"Good beer is not enough. The selection of beer here is second to none, with lots of rare(ish) selections and high caliber tap take overs, however the service is not on par with the prices that are attached. On a Sunday evening I found the place relatively empty but I still had to walk to the bar to order, our table did seem to have a dedicated server, and there were a few food concerns. You can't really judge based on one experience so I'll likely come back, eventually."}
{"text":"This is a great bar . Huge beer selection. In fact it's the best in town . Service is top notch the female bartenders are hot and nice people . The servers are also really great . The food is really good . Heck this place qualifying as the best bar in all of Vegas ."}
{"text":"Aces & Ales is a better-than-most neighborhood bar with tons of draft beer choices and above average food. Sadly I don't live close to here but it was perfect for a stop after hiking out at Mt. Charleston. We called ahead on a Sunday to make sure their patio allowed dogs and it does! We weren't sure how to actually get our dog to the patio since there isn't  an entrance from the outside but we just carried him through the bar (not sure how to do this with bigger dogs). Surprisingly we were the only ones on the patio but the bar area was packed. The waitress was very friendly and turned on the Golden Knights game for us outside. 

We found out it was Happy Hour which includes $2 off draft beers and appetizers and 1/2 off pizza. My boyfriend and I each had a few beers and shared the piggy back fries and beer bites. The piggy back fries were a modest portion of fries covered in pulled pork, onions, and BBQ sauce. The portion of pork vs. fries was generous and it's just the right amount of food to not make you feel sick afterwards. The beer bites were a little underwhelming: balls of dough served with a watery marinara and pimento-esque cheese dip. I guess this option is better than a nacho cheese but it wasn't easy for dipping. After having a version of this in California where the cheese was baked into the bread, everything else is only mediocre in comparison. 

Overall Aces & Ales is a great option for sampling new beers, watching sports events, gambling, or enjoying a rare outdoor patio. They advertise for all kinds of events from karaoke to trivia and if I lived closer I'd definitely be frequenting this bar on a more regular basis."}
{"text":"Loaded beer bites are awesome!  Beer selection is awesome!  Went on a Friday at 4:00 so it took a little longer to get service sometimes.  Allie (hopefully spelled right) was great.  She was very busy and helped out our table of 8 as fast as she could.  She's a cutie.  I'll go back again for sure."}
{"text":"I have been ordering their food when I visit the bar or when ordering take out/delivery. The portions are huge and the food is always great. I haven't had a complaint or any negative to say about food and food quality or presentation. The house made chips are amazing crispy and seasoned with the right amount of salt and they are not greasy! and so is the home made \"Black bean veggie burger\" every time I order takeout for my guest at home I get compliments about how good the food is. and I tell them it's from the local bar down the street (they go wild) surprised that as the presentation and food quality is beyond your typical bar food. I have ordered a bit of everything off their menu with the exemption of their pizza's yet to try. 
please share my review with your back of the house staff. Kudos"}
{"text":"Great food and Fantastic service!! Our server Nikki was on the ball and on time even on a busy karaoke night! Love her great beer recommendations"}
{"text":"Great service very nice ambience great burgers awesome delicious soup can't wait to go back"}
{"text":"Wow all these reviews and not one mention of how they became a RAIDERS bar overnight...

I have come to this bar on and off since they opened. Spotty service but good food and tons of screens for football season; along with raffles and specials during games. 
Unfortunately on my last experience I questioned whether I could continue to patronize this business.
I came in September for the Falcons/raiders game. My husband is a die hard Falcons fan, I'm a 49er fan, and we brought a friend who is a Seahawks fan. 
To paint the picture: my husband and I were simply wearing our team hats and our buddy was decked out with a hawks jersey. 
I was personally heckled twice while watching this game. 
One man stood up to leave furious and stopped upon seeing me. He pointed at me and said 'I THOUGHT THIS WAS A F***ING RAIDERS BAR' and stormed out. Maybe 20 minutes later a guy two tables down picked me out and said 'hey! Hey you!' And flipped me the bird. 
We stayed and finished the game. Paid our bill and tipped well but this has been enough to deter me from potentially coming back."}
{"text":"Ordered through UberEATS. I had the classic burger with fries. The good came in a timely manner. Delicious!!"}
{"text":"Very good selection of craft beers, decent atmosphere and some of the best has-been cock-rock bands in town!"}
{"text":"First things first, this review is long overdue. I've been coming to this bar for as long as i could and I've never been upset about any visit. This place is like a home away from home. Especially if you're into hair metal and grunge and everything in between. 

Second thing, this is the least cigarette smokey bar in LV i've ever been to... which is why I come here frequently. Even when someone is smoking, their filtration system picks it up quick. The recent reviews contradicting this are pure asinine. If its that big of a deal to you, don't go to a bar.

Third, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST FOOTBALL BARS. it's unfortunately a raiders bar (i'm an eagles fan), but i came here for almost every football game this year. I even saved a seat for the superbowl because i had such a good time during the regular season games. They have a special brunch menu and bottomless drinks on Sundays. 10/10 worth it

This bar is by far my favorite for beer and food. All the food is fresh made and to order, and they're quick to correct your order if it's the slightest bit wrong. They have the best rotating beer selection, with 50 rotating draft beers. Matt (who is in charge of the beer program AFAIK) is an awesome guy who knows his stuff when it comes to beer and all that's green and golden. He's also a goofy and fun dude with some awesome stories.

Krystal (i'm like 90% sure its with a K?) is one of the best! She is always easy to bs with, and she has great food and beer recommendations! I always know me and my friends are in fantastic hands when she's on the bar. Chick doesn't have a mean bone in her body. Knows what good Whiskey and Scotch are too! I've also got a list of potentially awful 80's movies to watch thanks to her.

Laura and Sarah are typically on the grave shift so i don't see them as often, but i'm always glad when i do. They're always fun and easy going, and quick to fill my cup. Both really sweet girls!

Kim is great too, I always enjoy annoying her for a couple hours. She's fun and super sarcastic like me, and i seem to do better playing keno when she is working the bar. She got me into the Jameson IPA caskmates and it quickly became my favorite whiskey. She's awesome with regulars in particular, even the headass obnoxious ones.

Nicole works more at the Nellis location, but i have had too many interesting conversations with her to not say something about her. She always has something fun to share and I definitely enjoy chewing her ear off when the bar is slow. She's always quick to point out when there's a good Stone on tap (my favorite) and point me in the right direction with something similar if there isn't. This poor woman even got me to awkwardly pose for pictures in their Aces and Ales shirts. 

Mitch is a smart dude, and whenever i have an in depth beer question he's quick to provide me with an in depth response- literally down to the chemical science of the beer. He and Matt both know how all sorts of beer are made and fermented, how barrel aged beers come out in different kinds of barrels, IBUs, etc. Great dudes to have a beer and chat with when they're off the bar!

I almost forgot Helen, who is the biggest sweet heart behind the bar. She's fun to chat with and has my favorite sense of humor. She is quick to recognize regulars and remember their type of drinks, and is always quick on her feet. 

I don't normally sit at the tables, but i'm always happy when i do. Jenna, Steph, Summer, Mike, Azure, Fallon, and all the other servers are phenomenal. That is an understatement. They always make sure our glasses are full and we have all the food we need, even when the place is ridiculously packed.

Fact of the matter is i can't praise this place and any of these people enough, they're one of a kind. I sure hope i spelt their names right.

TLDR: cooks are awesome, bartenders are awesome, servers are awesome, food is awesome, beer is awesome. There's no reason to go anywhere else. If you genuinely think you a had a bad experience here, i recommend trying it again. You WILL change your mind."}
{"text":"This place has an amazing selection of bear on tap that is different every week. I go on Tuesdays for their Appetizer/Bear special where you get to try 6 different bears and have a special food item that isn't on their menu. It makes it great for trying new bear without being stuck with a whole pint of it if you aren't to keen on it.

Kim is an awesome bartender, and the rest of the staff have always been friendly. They will give you suggestions on what they recommend depending on what you like.

The mac and cheese is delicious as well. The pizza is just like pizza anywhere else.

No Hendricks available though, but do try their breakfast shot! Half and half shot of Jameson and Butterscotch Snapps with a shot of orange juice as a chaser and then you get a piece of bacon to eat after that. You'll want more than one!"}
{"text":"I had the fortunate opportunity to attend the Winter Beer fest in January thanks to winning tickets from Yelp! This place is a bit out of the way, but I was lucky to have a vehicle since my mother currently lives in Las Vegas. I Love Beer and my mother knows that. She too likes to knock 'em back, so it wasn't difficult convincing her to come check out this event with me. We had several options for seating when we arrived and I noticed the shuffleboard not being played in the side room, so we decided to play a couple matches with our beer tastings. The servers were extremely friendly as well as the bartenders. 
Had the chance to try some Joseph James Brews which I had never heard of since we don't get their beers in Portland. The Stout was awesome. My mother hadn't ventured out much in Stouts and Now she is a fan! 
We had a blast playing Shuffleboard and tasting beers, I think my Mom even had more fun then me! =) 

For the Beer Lovers, this is the place to Go!!! Thank you again Yelp!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place, but I can only give it a 3-star, A-OK rating...

We were looking for a fun bar and grill (with good ambiance and great food!) on our side of town to frequent every now and then, and sadly this won't be it.  
But only because of the indoor smoking. We are not judging the smokers - it's their personal choice and they are allowed to smoke inside this establishment - but we don't want to eat our meal and spend our entire visit within a few feet of someone smoking - it's our personal choice.

In all other categories, I'd give this bar and grill high ratings for food, decor and especially the friendliness of the bartenders!"}
{"text":"I went to aces and ales recently and I got the buffalo chicken macaroni and cheese and my boyfriend got the pastrami and Swiss on Rye bread with mustard. We also tried the cheese curds, they came with 3 sides - one was buffalo sauce the other was a ranch and there was another one that I can't remember right now. Since we did take out the food was a little cold when we got home but that's our fault. I really enjoyed the mac and cheese and he seemed to enjoy the pastrami sandwich even though he said the bread was a little rough. We both really liked the cheese curds and the buffalo sauce was our favorite dipping sauce for them. 

If you are going to do take out I would suggest calling 25 to 30 minutes earlier than anticipated pickup time because they can get a little bit busy. I've been in here to eat several times and the service is always excellent!"}
{"text":"Love the food beer cheese is fantastic and the staff sweet! Especially Austin he makes the experience extra accommodating considering I come with a service dog!"}
{"text":"I had a great time here. My server Kaylie was super sweet and knowledgeable about the beer list. I only had appetizers, but she made great recommendations. I would go back there just to see her."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Watching the World Series! Great atmosphere!! The bartender makes you feel like your the only one here!!drinks are always full!!! Great place to have a great time!"}
{"text":"Update 10-13-10
I went to order 4 beers off of the menu and after each number I called off I was told the keg was topped off (empty). Here's an idea shift manager, it's called a pen and a ruler and cross off the beers that are out!"}
{"text":"If you stop by this place make sure you try some of their peers. I love their spaghetti Pizza. My daughter loves it also. We typically always order that. Happy hour is also good. The cocktails are really fancy and delicious during their happy hour specials. I left a Bloomin Onion. I think it's one of the best around town."}
{"text":"great food, staff & beer selection! Atmosphere is very homey. The patio out back has a fire pit and sting lights. Lots of IPAs. Prices aren't bad either!"}
{"text":"I have to say by far the worst service I've ever experienced at any location.  Our server Crystal seemed more concerned about going home than working. It's great that a location offers such a variety of hard to find gems. After arriving with a party of 5 it started bad from the go. After our server disappearing for 15 min we had to go to bar for refills and to track her down. Then  she informs us that she is leaving and transferring our bill to Rose but fails to inform Rose of our bill wich was divided by 2 parties. We decided to bail on this place after so many of our friends and followers have spoken highly on your establishment. Our check comes and nothing had been split or done in the manner that was asked then both  the bartender and server begin to bad mouth and berate the server that bailed on us. A total lack of professional on there part. We travel to CA. on a regular basis to purchase what u carry and I almost found a great place to spend $$$$ at but after last night I'll happily take a 3hr drive then deal with this again. It's a shame how quickly 1 employe can cost your business  this much money in the long run. I hope things change before they cost you more."}
{"text":"the food here is excelent and far exceeds any expectations. i mostly come late night and both sarah and jess are probably the best bartenders i have experienced in a long time. the are very attentive and knowledgeable about the most amazing beer list."}
{"text":"We went here to watch the Golden Knights hockey game. It was on every tv and they had the sound on. It's been a real struggle to find a local bar to watch the games at. The food and the service were good. Will definitely be back soon! They have half price pizzas and offer a ton of beers, so if beer is your thing, this is the place to go! We also ordered this delicious dessert. It was a Nutella pizza and it was the bomb!"}
{"text":"Once upon a time, I was not into beer in the least. Guess what changed that? I'll give you a hint: A dude. So, in an effort to try more craft (read: good) beer, I adventured to a far away place on the east side of the Vegas valley known as Aces & Ales. Boasting one of the most impressive menus in the area, the bar is a good place to go whether you're a seasoned brew aficianado or a total newbie. The place is so ingrained in the craft scene that it's home to the annual Stone Domination Festival, which is headed up by the Stone Brewing Co. master himself, Greg Koch. And while this place may look like an ordinary bar, don't be fooled: It's got great food, good drinks and you'll definitely meet some characters.  I may have had a lame ushering in to the wonderful world of beer, it's been a good visit so far.

Things of note: Beware the microphone. The food menus is massive. No, really. It should have its own zip code. I think I also remember something about A&A winning an award for best bar food in the valley.

Make sure to try: The tap list is ever evolving so get your beer while its cold."}
{"text":"Stephanie was our server and was amazing! She recommended me numerous beers after I told her I like any beer. I found out I did in fact NOT like every beer!  she was amazing, and very responsive to our requests. She is the absolute best!!!! Make sure to buy her a beer or two, or three. The servers here are all beautiful!!! Except Mitch. He is not beautiful."}
{"text":"Visited here a few weeks ago.  Friendly bartender.  She recommended some great food including the deep fried Oreos.  Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"love the beer selections.  but the service and food is awful.  I put $40 in the machine and I didn't even get 1 drink comped. my total for 4 beers and breakfast was $80 over priced by far for a bland breakfast sandwich that didn't even come with cheese or flavor.  this could be a great spot if customer service existed ..the woman bartender took 20 mins to ask for drink order I felt like I was waking her from her nap . she seamed so happy  and friendly NOT."}
{"text":"Tried this place out because of a Groupon. This place is awesome, and it's really unfortunate that it's so far away from my house. I'd probably live there. The bartender was sweet, our pizza was pretty damn good, at least for Vegas, and the beer/ale menu consisted almost entirely of stuff I've never of. Yay! I love exploring new beers. 
The atmosphere perfectly fine for a bar, plenty of pool tables scattered around the building, nice and dark, plenty of tv's, but they're all over the bar, not EVERYWHERE. I appreciate that;  I'm not a big fan of tv's 5 inches from my face in every direction. 
Oh, it's smoker friendly, so be prepared!"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Saturday night. 1030. Maybe 20 people in whole bar. Outside open. Several waitresses wandering around. No service at all. 15 minutes. Seriously. Get in gear. We left. Who cares what beer you have if your service sucks."}
{"text":"Headed over for a bite. They have a lunch special menu! Yipppeee! I had the burger with chips and salsa...holy crap...so good! Added a pumpkin spiced stout..freakin' better!  I ate everything it was so good. Did I mention it was a lunch special?! Waitress was awesome! I will be back for more burgers and beer!"}
{"text":"The food was GREAT and the selection of beer was even better! The Staff could be a little more friendly but overall I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"Jena with one N is the best waitress at aces and ales, and she's hot. The food here is excellent and the service was fabulous. I come here all the time. Great food great people!"}
{"text":"Went there on Tuesday night with my brother for the first time and sat out on the patio. It was a nice outdoor patio. So we ordered appetizers, we got the salt and vinegar crisps and the arrogant bastard cheese balls, I'm not sure if that is the exact name. So the cheese balls were pretty good, but the potato crisps were so salty and they bring you a spritzer with the vinegar inside, which was gross cause it just made the chips soggy, yuck. For our meal , I got the Mac and cheese burger and my brother got the juicy lucifer burger. I'll start with the worst, my brothers burger had raw ground beef hanging off the side. I said to him what's the red stuff, thinking it was like some red peppers or something, he thought the same. He didn't even realize he ate raw ground beef and was too embarrassed to tell the waitress. He is like that and it bugs me, so I could not get him to say anything. Ugh, thank God he didn't get sick, he has a stomach of steel. That was just gross! My burger was actually cooked, but the meat was bland as heck and the burger had no sauce, it was served dry with the Mac and cheese on it and a slice of red onion, I kid you not, about an inch thick! Won't be going back, the food is just nasty. I mean who the heck serves raw ground beef, that's a health hazard and dangerous! He could have gotten really sick. Oh and by the way the music was so loud, I thought I was at a classic rock concert!"}
{"text":"I went back and tried to cash a coupon I received.  They would not honor it and the waitress said that since she poured the drink already that I would have to pay and then turned her back and walked away.  I left as I didn't want to pay for the drink; I came simply because I had a coupon and was in the area.  The manager then chased me outside as I pulled away.  Aces and Ales, you have a great draft list, but respect your customers.  If it says 1 free pint, then either honor it or don't give out coupons.  We'll see if I ever come back."}
{"text":"This review is for 3.5 stars. 

I like the other location in Tenaya better just because of the selection. The main reason I come to Aces and Ales is for the beer so if given the choice I would go to the wests side version for proximity and tap list. 

Still Nellis isn't bad for this area and they have a solid rotating list. Staff is friendly and the biggest plus is their back room with shuffle bids and a bunch of tvs which offers this location a nice party room which the other Aces doesn't have. 

If you're looking for a good beer list on the east side  I think you can't go wrong with this place."}
{"text":"We set up a karaoke event here for a work team building. It was super affordable and really fun!

We rented a karaoke guy that the venue uses, ordered food and endless alcohol. 
The waitress was ON IT! Our cups never ran dry! She was always around the corner making sure we were taken care of.

We were a really loud party but they just let us be and gave us our own room. It was great. 

There was food and so much alcohol and we walked out only spending under $2k for 25 of us."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to come here for awhile. I'm glad we finally did. Great beer selection and the food is outstanding. Everything tastes great. Lots of beers to choose from. The juicy Lucy burger was great!"}
{"text":"I was doing business on the east side of town and need a place to grab a quick bite. I stumbled across the Nellis Aces and since I was familiar with the Tenaya location I knew that I'd get quality food. I ordered the breakfast burrito. It was good.
I like my home Aces better but if I lived in the area I'd be here all of the time."}
{"text":"My friend and I tried happy hour here last month ended up ordering food also everything was great the sweet bartenders were very pleasant and quite personable made us feel like regulars. Since first visit  I have been back with my wife 3 times the food is very consistent and tasty the drinks are plentiful and the staff rock!!We all enjoy this place!! Wings, Eddie Spaghetti pizza, sliders and hamburgers all good and tasty thanks"}
{"text":"Lots of beers to try.  Pretty good food menu.  Fun trivia games played live and lots of TVs to watch various sports.  
Fun spot to come with a group of friends. Loud enough not to overhear any one else's convo as well as them not in yours.  Get loud and have fun"}
{"text":"Great people. Good service and great selection on beer. I like saison, this place has it on draft. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Wasn't a bad place. When I arrived waiting for a friend took awhile for someone to stop by and get my drink order. When the waitress finally arrived she was real nice and accommodating. Surprised they didn't have a few drinks we wanted but over all wasn't bad. Food was pretty good."}
{"text":"What a find! The only bad thing about this place is there aren't more around the Vegas valley. Talk about a beer selection.. Amazing! 
I got the oatmeal stout they had on tap. It was very rich, silky, and bitter. So good. My girlfriend and I got the pretzel appetizer to share. It was so good, and the mustard it came with was super good too. The only drawback the bartender didn't comp any of our drinks and we gabled quite a bit and she charged us a buck for a side of marinara sauce. haha no big deal just thought it was odd. 
If your ever in the area of Nellis and Flamingo I suggest checking this place out."}
{"text":"Fantastic beer selection and a pretty good menu that goes slightly beyond your typical bar food. The buffalo chicken mac and cheese is awesome. The pretzel bites are good choices to. Cool atmosphere and outdoor fireplace area. Location is a bit random, but still worth it."}
{"text":"It was ok. They are close and wanted to try it out. Was told that everything was made on site and was fresh. I had fish and chips... They were pretty good. Also had their beer cheese soup, it was good. The fries were very good. If you look on Yelp it appeared that they had a huge selection of beers that included Alaskan and Mirror Pond products... Nope. Must have been long ago....I was looking for a lager or Pilsner... Nada. Odd selection. Stuck with water...."}
{"text":"Stephanie is the greatest ever! This was our first time here and we plan on coming back. Bomb wings and pizza!"}
{"text":"SICKENKY SMOKEY.  Place needs to be aired out.  Didn't venture more than 3 feet in door, turned around and left."}
{"text":"Awesome electronic beer board. Great selection. Very cool atmosphere. Staff was very nice. Good service. Tried a couple appetizers, chicken tenders and zucchini chips. Both were very good. This is quite a drive for me, but I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"We came here for the Nintendo quiz, so keep in mind we were here for an event that was BUSY. So my perception may be off from normal nights.
Beer cheese soup and nachos were delicious.
The beer selection was great. 
My issue was the service I had to ask 3x for lemons for my water and when an order was taken the lady ran away from me and didn't ask any questions or give me any service, one girl even said something rude about my friend after taking my order.
I ordered Parmesan fries and waited 30 minutes for it, when the waitress walked by I asked where my fries were and her response was \" oh, I decided not to order those\" then walked away!! Wow! I had to then yell at her to come back and give me nachos instead because apparently fries weren't preferable for some reason ?!? 
Teach your staff customer service. 
Your food, venue, and beer selection is on point. 
Fix your staff."}
{"text":"What a fantastic little find!!! An all scratch bar menu that clearly goes above and beyond and bar food I've ever had! We ordered the Mac attack burger and a pepperoni pizza... yummm.. the Mac and cheese on the burger was delicious and the pizza was tasty as well. The beer selection is out of this world.. 50 beers on tap.. so many to choose from! The atmosphere was cozy and the staff was very attentive! We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Went here to get away from the insane lines and prices of the strip.  We had pizza and the home made mac and cheese and of course beer!  All was very tasty!  And the prices - fantastic - we saved enough money on that dinner to pay for our rental car just to drive over there!  LOL.  This looks like a hole in the wall dive bar from the outside - don't be fooled!  It's decent inside and the food and high quality beer selections were great!"}
{"text":"Honesty was amped to check this place out. Me and about 15 friends went last night, food was amazing but our service sucked. The waitress pretty much made us feel like we were bothering her the whole time we were there. I would go again but hope the service is better, it was pretty busy and it looked like the place might have been alittle understaffed but no need to make a customer feel like they're a pain in your ass because you're having a bad day.

After leaving my review the manager of operations dmed me and apologized for the service. For someone to take there time to make sure they got back to me and try to make it right changes my review for sure. I will be going back to try some more beers and food soon."}
{"text":"Great service, booze, and PIZZA!  My gal pals and I come here occasionally to let some steam out from a long week.  I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to kick back and have some fun."}
{"text":"Food's good nice bar delivery is an issue ordered twice ok the first time 40 minutes late and cold pizza hope they fix that"}
{"text":"The bartenders here are always fantastic, and the beer selection is hard to beat, but after years of coming here late night for food and drink, I'm going to start having to go to the new PT's down the street instead where the kitchen is open 24/7."}
{"text":"I don't really get this place.

Honestly, I don't find the beer menu that extensive. Compared to other beer-centric bars I have visited, the selection did not seem that great (and it was rather repetitive at that). But I am no beer expert so maybe true connoisseurs will say that the selections they do have are excellent... I wouldn't know.

The food is pretty tasty, particularly the many variations on mac & cheese, but not worth going out of your way for.

Finally, the service is dismal. On two visits (one just for drinks, one for food), we have had a shockingly brusque waitress.

No thanks."}
{"text":"I came here for a friend who is moving. She said its a karaoke bar in Monday nights. I dont know if they have it other nights. 
They have a bunch of beers on tap. I am not a beer drinker but I decided to try #7, and it was gross. I had to suck it up and just drink it quickly but it was difficult. All the tap beers on the menu were $8.
They do have a decent menu and I ordered the cheese curds. They were very good. Nice sized portion too served with 3 different dipping sauces. My friend ordered chicken wings and it was a decent portion as well. 
The place has about 5 pool tables. We weren't playing since there was some type of tournament going on.  I'm not sure how much it costs.
The karaoke was a little loud for me. My friend went up and it was cool to cheer her on!  
It's close to my job from far from my house so I wouldn't frequent this place. But if you live near here, it's worth checking out."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere for after work drinks or dinner. 50 rotating beers on tap, really great food. My favorites are the homemade salt and vinegar chips, grilled artichoke, cheese curds... I could go on. A little pricey, but consistently good, and they have a discount at happy hour. I have only eaten in the bar, but the service has always been great."}
{"text":"With the number of drafts on tap at this place, you cannot go wrong. Pair that up with some awesome comfort food and you've got the best hotel adjacent dinner joint I've ever walked to while traveling for work. I had a saison and a dry Irish stout, the names and breweries are insignificant since they apparently rotate their kegs out all the time. To go with the liquids, I ordered a caprese grilled cheese and some of the tomato soup. I didn't want it to end."}
{"text":"Popped in to watch some football. Definitely seems like a spot. Didn't get a chance to take a peak at the menu, but the beer list was extensive and impressive. 

I was too wrapped up in the game to really pay any attention to everything else. But it seems like a great place to snag a drink. It seemed a little difficult to get a drink, but not enough to bother me. 

Would definitely love to return."}
{"text":"Second time here. They are open 24 hours a day! My bf and I met friends here last night. They have a nice outdoor seatings but the weather was cold.

They have a good choice of craft beers in Las Vegas and better selection of quality beers. The waitress says the beers on tap on the menu changes every three days. They also do events so check their website for current tap list and special events.

If you like video poker then this is also a very ok place to hang out.

They have a discount at happy hour.

I had a glass of Riesling. My friends had Nachos and cheese. We tried Candied bacon, it tasted like Teriyaki bacon and we didn't like it. 

The music was loud and noise level was high.

Our waitress is very attentive and friendly.

Overall, this is a pretty average bar. I don't feel like there's a real reason to go out of your way to come here, but if you're in the area then it's worth a visit."}
{"text":"Wow! I gotta say we just left in a serious food coma  We went for Happy Hour on a Sunday (which was all day on a Sunday) and ordered pretty much all of the happy hour food - split between 4 people. The food was simply amazing! Really good! I don't think you would be disappointed trying anything. The only thing we all didn't care for was the smoking....yuck!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Nicole is the best ever and knows what beer we want before we even ask. The food has never disappointed us, and the beer selection is one for the books! We drive across town just to go here, that's how much we love this place."}
{"text":"Went here to grab some lunch. They didn't have the two beers I asked for on draft nor the bottle of (Newcastle!!) that I asked for instead. Service was slow. Walked out and won't be back. They should be renamed \"Deuces and Not Many Ales\""}
{"text":"Plus breakfast ALL DAY!! Minus it only had two choices. Plus the bacon and eggs were quite good. They say everything is made from scratch and I believe them because it took a little while to get the food but it was worth the wait. Us felines hate pre-made crap. Good dining at reasonable prices. Three meows and a purr!"}
{"text":"Food was great, nice atmosphere and I tried the flight of beers which was awesome! Our server, Nicole, was excellent at recommending what beers to sample and she was great at checking in on our party to see if we needed any refills. She really knew her stuff! She also recommended a chocolate beer which I thought was great! 

On a side note, they have a nice room you can also reserve for private parties and a really pretty outdoor patio as well."}
{"text":"Came here to watch basketball and get dinner on Friday night. 

The food was AMAZING. The service was GREAT. The bathrooms were clean.

We had the chocolate chip cookie for dessert SOOOOOO GOOD. 

Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Called the food order in when I was about 20 min out the girl said about about 15 minutes to 20 min tops gave the server my name she answered with let me check I'll be back another 20 min I ask the bartender to please check my order she comes out with my food, 2 cheese burgers with onion rings each  $36.00 yes  $36.00 bucks okay get home 10 min drive walk straight to the table open the box, rings are swimming in grease along with the bottom of the bun can't eat the burger with the bottom bun this was both burgers, it was all all cold very disappointed"}
{"text":"We love this place. It is one of our \"date night\" choices. HOWEVER, you changed the menu and got rid of the ahi tuna salad. That was not only my favorite BUT it was the best in town I have found ( I am currently sitting at The Yard House after having their mediocre ahi salad and missing yours). I even went so far as bringing dressing and pickled ginger to your restaurant one night but it just wasn't the same. 
Please bring your ahi salad back!!!!"}
{"text":"At 1st, 'ACES' was my go to bar as it is about a 5 minute drive from my house and they were the only bar in the area that has Arrogant Bastard (my fav by the way) and some other Stone and Rogue beers on tap. But, seemingly every time I walk in and ask for Arrogant Bastard they never have any. Happened on more than one occasion and it kinda makes me irritated that I have to drink something that I don't want. The staff and bartenders are friendly and their sweet potato fries are amazing and a must have with your beer.  The Veggie Burger is actually pretty good as well but a bit pricey in my opinion. They also have pool tables, numerous amounts of TVs, and video poker available.  I've never won on the video poker but maybe I just have bad luck when I play there haha. Fights have broken out on more than one occasion while I was there but it's a bar so whaddya expect? Good bar just don't come expecting a beer that might not be there even though it's advertised outside."}
{"text":"Hands down the best small bar in Las Vegas, the staff is the best Ryan and Misty have to be two of the best folks we have come across since moving to Vegas. The selection of beer is great....I dont even know if they sell the beer made by the the evil Ambev and you should not even consider those beers anyway. They have a constant rotating variety of true micro brews and a beer Connoisseur's dream but also something for everyone too. The best has to be Wednesday steak nite throw $20 in a machine and get a great steak dinner or the Tuesday Nite Tastings 6 different beers and the food of the week."}
{"text":"A good selection of beers on tap. There's some locals and some more nationally-available choices. Pricing was OK.

I wasn't overly excited about the menu, but had a pastrami sandwich. Didn't really dig it. The deep-fried Oreos were excellent, though. Nicely paired with chocolate stouts."}
{"text":"I arranged my 50th birthday to host here. It wasn't my first time using their awesome big private room and I wasn't disappointed at all!! The food is great! The service is awesome!  It's a best-kept-secret venue!  My friends and family had a wonderful time!  My big thanks to Kimberly and staff! It was truly memorable!!"}
{"text":"I started coming here because it was close to work and home. I keep coming here because the staff and patrons are so nice and the beer selection can't be beat in this area. I come on the shift that Helen works most of the time. She knows my name and more importantly she knows my drink. She makes great suggestions for beer to try based on my tastes and she never gets it wrong. Misty, James and Crystal never get it wrong either. It is important that I go to a place the employees are happy and genuinely like their jobs. It really shows in the service and atmosphere. The food is great. The patrons are fun and it's always great to hang out and meet new people. This is my go to bar in Vegas at any time, day or night."}
{"text":"Exellent Beer List that gets updated and changes frequently. Great Mac' n' cheese. The Bar tender Matt is a beer guru and introduced me to some new beers that are amazing."}
{"text":"Even after reading all the positive reviews from my fellow yelp friends, my experience at Ales & Aces exceeded my expectations. 

Upon entering, I was immediately greeted w/ the friendly bartender Jenny. She was one of the main reasons why I enjoyed my visit there. If you want good, outgoing & helpful service you have to come when she's there. I came there in the evening so I'm sure she works the night shift. I love going to places where people are outgoing & friendly. It really makes you want to to return. I wish I can add another extra 5 stars for having such a great bartender. When you go to some bars in this town, it takes a while for the staff to acknowledge you & when they do, they act like you're lost & from another planet or something. They don't seem to want your business. That's definitely not the case with Jenny. She's amazing & very welcoming!

This place is heaven sent for all of us beer connoisseurs in town with the vast beer selection. I didn't even know where to start. I got lost reading the menu. Oh man! It's like beer paradise up in this joint. 

The food came out very fast & I ate it very fast cause it was so tasty. With the good beer, good food, pool tables, gaming & great service, how can you not check this place out? Too bad it's on the other side of town or I would be here religiously every day if it was closer to my home. This place is a must go to if you're ever on the east side."}
{"text":"The best beer bar in Las Vegas. Fantastic food, attentive service, a very well chosen list of 50 craft beers on tap and even more in bottles. Plenty of flatscreens for catching the game from any seat.
Appetizers are a stand out. Love the cheese balls... Sort of a less spicy and more savory version of a jalepeno poppers. Watch out, the chipolte aioli it comes with has a kick!
Draft list is heavy on the California brews, but always has some local Las Vegas brews. Bottle list includes both hard to find and vintage ales. Beer geek heaven!"}
{"text":"Friggin love this place. Anyone that appreciates great beer and an awesome environment this is the place for you.

Just an amazing selection of different beers for you to try. The guys runnin the joint know their beers..no BS'n goin in here.

So if you wanna ditch the trendy crap at the Yardhouse, punish your liver,or just try somethin new come hit this place up it will not let you down.

One of my top places to go in the states to try good beers from all over."}
{"text":"If u have had enough to drink and want to drink water to sober up b4 u go home, u can't get it unless u buy their bottled water.   Not cool!!!!"}
{"text":"OMG! I'm really blown away by the quality of the food. The boneless wings were the best I'd ever had, like picture perfect and plentiful! meant to take a picture but my husband and I dove right in. They have great blue cheese too. You can tell their dressings are homemade. My burger was perfection. I ordered a simple cheeseburger with all the fixings and let me tell you it was perfectly prepared. The meat had the best char on the outside and the inside was so juicy and flavorful. I was so full half way through, but it would have been a crime to let the other half go to waste. We left so happy, and the first thing I said when we got in the car was \"the quality is so good there\".  I'm a chef, a recently pregnant chef and I have a feeling I will be craving Aces & Ales a lot over the next 7 months  can't wait to come back"}
{"text":"I know how a poor Islamic Pilgrim feels when they pray at Mecca now. 

This Majestic wonderland is split into two significant sections: a fairly casual bar area with numerous flat-screens and an amazing amount of taps. Your eyes will quickly find the flat screens with the up to date lists and serving varieties of the masterfully chosen beer (seriously, I've only seen one beer there that looked like it wasn't artfully chosen. It was a Cherry Blue Moon or some such thing.) There's so many amazing beers that it's actually hard to see them on the screen from the back of the bar.. And I have spectacular vision.
The other section is a Lovely combination of Hogwarts Dining Hall and a San Diego Beer Bar. Slightly brighter lighting, high tables and a beautiful view of the Keg Room. Tons of room for everyone here. This is the section I did not sit in and plan to on my next visit.
The food I had was glorious: Crunchy balanced Arrogant Bastard Fries with an expertly assembled burger. So Good.
Service was spectacular as well. The beer menu was said to be out of date but I have no idea how they could keep them up to date. Hence the flat screens.
One excellent idea: The beers are all six bucks: they are just served in different portions. The servers claim this is because of alcohol content (which is true: good beer is correlated to higher alcohol content) but we know what's up. Still six bucks per beer is really fantastic. It really cannot be overemphasized that this is the best selection of beer anywhere in Vegas. I honestly don't know where you're going to find a better diversity of ales and lagers. You're definitely going to need a jet to get there, wherever it might be. 
I hope that my fellow motorists, my family, and my insurance company appreciate how hard it is to stop drinking at this amazing temple of hops and barley. I do not believe in drinking and driving but I was pretty damn close to finding a homeless person to drive me home.

PLEASE PUT THE NEXT ONE IN THE SOUTHWEST ITS A LOVELY PART OF THE VALLEY WITH LOTS OF GROWTH AND TERRIBLE BARS. THANK YOU."}
{"text":"This is the best beer bar in Vegas. No contest. This place is proof that a loving God wants his children to be happy. Also I saw no mention anywhere of Bud Miller and Coors: I almost kissed the owner on the mouth on discovering this.

Firstly, the place doesn't give a hint of the glorious temple of craft beer inside. I mean, plenty of bars mention beer in their name \"The Copper Keg\" and consider Blue Moon to be a \"craft brew\". When you go in your only real indication that at first is that the beer mirror decor is of a much rarer caliber of brews.

The tap list bitch slaps places like the Yard House and Pour 24 on their wannabe faces. This list was chosen by a master. A Master of masters. The Bottle list is a \"what's what\" of the last five years of craft brewing. One wonders how the owners get these beers. The taps are even available in smaller sizes so you can sample  some of the pricey exotics.

We got the tasting sampler. The waitress (Misty, who was spectacular BTW) made a passing comment that made me to believe the tasting/sampler was a Tuesday thing, and if it is I recommend going on Tues, because for $20 we got lots of large amazing samples (they MADE us pick one and yet it was the best) and tamales(?!) for some reason. But hey, Tamales! Also we got Chili Cheese Fries. These were spectacular as well.

They have events here, and the upcoming one looks spectacular if you enjoy good beer. Apparently Alice Cooper also plays here too. I'm sure that's lovely. 

If I were a less honest man I would give this bar no stars, because it was getting a little full on Tuesday and I always want a barstool. This bar does have one negative, and that's it got smoky when I was there. I know poor smokers have been thrown out of almost everywhere, but if it was perfect for me there'd be no smoking. However, from the service to the selection to the prices I would've originally assigned this place one f*cking billion stars. So maybe take one from that. Yelp only allows five.

PLEASE OPEN ONE OF THESE ON THE SOUTHWEST SIDE. YOU CAN USE MY BACK YARD ITS PRETTY BIG."}
{"text":"Great place fun atmosphere the service was top notch! I highly recommend the ahi poke appetizer"}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood, I looked the menu up online and decided that the man and I would go to a nice Nevada style tavern.

Walk in and nice high seats that encourage community seating. Super fun! Lots of big TVs. Lots of beer. What isn't to love? Oh, just about everything!

I order the beer bites. Pizza dough balls with three sauces for dipping. Yum-o! That and my drink were about the ONLY decent things about this place.  (And the tomato soup). The drink I had was some martini, whatever the chocolate/caramel/coconut one is, I had it.

My male companion ordered a margarita and the bartender didn't put a salt rim on it...you are bartender right? How do you not know to do that??
 
Everything on the menu sounds amazing, I will have one of everything! We decided that we were in a bar food burger kind of mood.  ***Note to our waitress, Erin, WRITE THINGS DOWN!!!!  I ordered a simple cheeseburger with Swiss and cheddar, well done.  My super hot date ordered a bacon cheeseburger with Swiss, she had to ask him again to clarify his order. Maybe she should have WRITTEN THINGS DOWN at this point if she couldn't remember.

We get our burgers. They look sooo good, I want to devour it. I take a bite, it's like the best burger I ever had, until my next bite included a half melted bite of AMERICAN cheese. Gross. But you know, no one WROTE MY ORDER down. He cut into his burger which looked so tasty I wouldn't let him eat it until I posted a photo of it to Facebook. And it's covered in BBQ sauce. No, he didn't order the BBQ burger he ordered a bacon cheeseburger. Hmmm. She even asked him didn't he order a BBQ burger? Well, if you had WRITTEN THE ORDER down on a piece of paper you could have seen that no, he did not, he ordered a bacon cheeseburger.  

Both burgers had to be redone.  And again, she has to ask us what our burgers were. WRITE IT THE EFF DOWN IF YOU CAN'T REMEMBER!! We get our burgers, simple cheeseburgers after an eternity, his is great.  Mine however, must have been grilled where the hottest peppers in all the world were because my lips were on fire to the point where I was crying. My dude asked if they season the meat and she said no, so obviously someone didn't clean the grill. Gee, thanks, for the most unpleasant burger experience ever. Our server did offer to make me something else. And wait a third time for food? No thanks.  I will have better luck at home at this point. 

Our burgers were generously taken off the bill, but we were still charged for fries and soup which COME with the burgers. Personally, I think after messing up both burgers once and having a replacement sent back for ungodly spicy-ness that a visit from a manager would have been appreciated or the entire bill save for our alcoholic drinks comped. 

Our bill came to $35.00 after our $10.00 cheeseburgers were taken off which would have made our bill $55.00 ish.  We tipped $10.00 for terrible service (we had to remind her about waters we ordered, drinks took forever to be delivered to our table-we could see them sitting on the bar, we had to ask for appetizer plates, the menus which LITERALLY are nearly half the size of the table were never picked up, and the ordering debacle..she did not deserve that tip at all!  It wasn't even busy, she had two tables, one guy and the two of us!) Of course maybe the cooks couldn't read her...oh, wait, she didn't WRITE ANYTHING DOWN, so there was nothing to read.... So who really knows why I got american instead of cheddar cheese. And I doubt she poured pepper spray on my second burger, but the tip I really wanted to leave is...

ERIN. WRITE. DOWN. YOUR. ORDERS. 
 
I wanted to write it on the check so the manager could see it, but I left a cash tip and didn't want to end up on Facebook looking like a cheapskate who doesn't know how to tip on a bill even with things taken off and a snarky comment which I saved for Yelp so everyone can see it.

My advice is IF you visit this place ask your server to write your order down so there is no confusion. Don't go expecting good, prompt service. The food is delicious...the stuff that comes out CORRECT from the kitchen anyway.  If you don't go out often and you want to treat yourself to a nice evening out to just relax and enjoy good food, THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO DO THAT!

I can promise I will NOT be back.

On a happy note I had a banana and strawberries at home for dinner, I wrote it down and nothing got messed up, I give myself five stars for great service!"}
{"text":"Come in on a busy Saturday night. Only one bartender , Kimmy, was working. Even though she was spread thin, she gave amazing service. Never let our beers go empty and food was delivered hot. She had a great personality! Everything we ordered was delicious! The beer selection was great and it was fun to try something different! I defiantly recommend this place for somewhere casual but a step up from your usual neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"Came here for the Winter Beer Fest on a Saturday afternoon.  As usual, tasting glasses were $15 for the 1st round (you keep the glass) and each round after that is $4.  Not bad!  The lineup of Beer was pretty good, but not as good as the Summer Beer Fest in my opinion.  We arrived at 12:30 pm and here's a list of Beer I had:

Stone Double Dry Hopped IPA
Stone Smoked Porter w/Chipotle Peppers
Ballast Point Brewing Company Dorado Double IPA
Stone Imperial Russian Stout Bourbon Barrel
Stone Smoked Porter w/Vanilla Beans
Ballast Point Brewing Company Sculpin IPA
Big Dog's Sled Dog Stout
Big Dog's War Dog Imperial IPA
Moylans Brewery Kilt Lifter
Joseph James Barrel Aged Desert Dawn

They were all very good.  My favorites were the Stone Smoked Porter w/Chipotle Peppers.....I should have ordered this with a Burger.  Instead, I ordered a 16\" Margherita Pizza ($13).  The Pizza was awful.....0 Stars.  I'm a Pizza lover too and I'm very tolerable about bad Pizza....but this one was soooo bad.  The crust was tough like cardboard and the ingredients were subpar.  You're not suppose to use regular Tomatoes on a Margherita Pizza....but that's what they did and they were bland.  Blech.  Ken M ordered Fish Tacos and he loved them.....I think I ordered the wrong menu item.  Oh well, next time I'll try a Burger.

Overall, it was a good time.....I wish this place was closer to my neighborhood.  Return Factor - 99.9%"}
{"text":"Decent food...actually great bar food menu and excellent beer menu.  My tablemates had excellent appetizers (maple glazed bacon I believe it was called) and raved about it.  The selection is vast and the food is pretty decent.  I was a smidgen disappointed that they were out of the beer I had selected and the backup beer tasted old.  BUT the others I tried were better.  I would go there again!"}
{"text":"Great food and so many beers to choose from! Brie was our server, she was very helpful in the beer selection process. With a convenient location and many more beers to try, we'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"Never would I try this place if it wasn't on Postmates. Hungry one night and decided to be lazy and do Postmates. Nicely packed. Nothing missing. They had our order exactly the way we wanted. Thank you. Had doubts but when food delivered it was pretty good. 

We got steak and eggs like I have said before my mom being picky she actually said she would order from them again 
And I got the turkey bacon sandwich with their fries that I couldn't stop eating
Andddd their ranch which I think is home made it was sooo so good. 

Two things I would love to try are the Eddie spaghetti (funny name ) and their dessert. I'll post back about those :)"}
{"text":"The hangover breakfast was really good!  Kimberly was awesome at the bar. Easy to get in, sit down, get a drink and some food and watch the games. We liked the fried cheese curds too!"}
{"text":"They have a sign that says \"We Promote Communal Eating\"...
Okay....
Well, when there are only 6 or 7 other people in the whole restauraunt and you watch people walk in, and they just stand around because there's no sign that says \"serve yourself\", you figure you could say something.

I was tempted to walk out because of the lack of service. There's 1 guy at the bar, taking care of people, and 1 woman walking around... doing who know's what? A group of 4 people walk in, that's pretty obvious, and yet we don't get acknowledged whatsoever.

We come to sit ourselves so we don't make the situation even more awkward and our server comes over within a minute. We didn't have much time to look over the \"beer menu\" before being asked but my friends made their decisions. 

We got the Nacho Average Nachos and grilled artichoke. Guys, if you want artichoke, just make it at home. It was really well seasoned but not worth $9, in the slightest. The nachos actually did seem pretty average to me. No beans, just chips, cheese, and mango/pineapple pico de gallo  with jalapenos. Also something I would just rather make at home, for much cheaper.

I was really excited about this place, as a vegetarian, since it has a full grilled cheese and mac n cheese menu. I got the Southsider grilled cheese and I have to say, it was pretty damn amazing. It was the redeeming factor. Their fries were pretty damn tastey as well. My friends ordered the Moondog grilled cheese and buffalo chicken mac n cheese. They said the Moondog was surprisingly spicy, but tasty and DEFINITELY recommended the buffalo chicken mac n cheese. 

Also, get the deep fried oreos. You won't regret it, they were amazing. I'd never had them before but I will get them again if I come back!!

Overall, with our Groupon that covered $30, there was still a $70 balance or so which is a bit more than I expected it to be. I mean, there were two appetizers, three entrees, a desert, and 5 beers so it was a good amount of stuff for $100 but I didn't feel like it was worth it... Maybe it was the fact that we spent $20 alone on two appetizers that weren't that satisfying.

p.s. The music was all over the place. Country for the most part but then it would randomly change...."}
{"text":"Gotta drive to the great northwest but a decent establishment for a bar.  Nice decor and atmosphere, great selection of draft beers, menu looks above average fare.  Had the house chips, who doesn't love homemade chips??  Sierra Nevada was here today and took over 25 taps with beer I never seen before, got a free glass too!
Beer up!!!"}
{"text":"I am here in town for my boyfriend's work and needed a place to go for some quick lunch. I happened to stop by just in time for there lunch special. 8$ bucks for an entree and a side. Very pleasant and welcoming  environment. Will be back before I go back to AZ!"}
{"text":"Aces and Ales is my #1 draft pick in Summerlin.  They are a welcomed cold and tasty addition to the neighborhood.  When we're here getting our drank on, it's like Phil from Duck Dynasty says, \"Everybody happay, happay, happay.\"  

Aces is located on the corner of Tenaya and Peak, a couple doors down from Tenaya Creek.  They're in a stand alone building with green shutters around the top.  If you're driving down Peak, signage is sparse.  

With over 50 craft beer handles, there's something to satisfy every beer palate from chocolatey stouts to crazy IPAs to dubbel tripel belgians to you name it.  As soon as one tap kicks it, they already have a replacement plan.  On Sundays Aces offers half off growler fills until 8pm.  Don't be afraid to ask for a sample if you're not sure which beer is going to make your tongue sing and wag happily.

For best service, pull up a seat at the bar.  Our favorite bartenders Coleen and Adonna are amazeballs; freaking love them!  They are super friendly and prompt, taking care of your every need, err beer.  You might recognize Adonna, who was formerly with Sierra Gold down the street.  

We've tried sitting in the dining room a couple of times, but service was meh to non-existent.  

Don't forget to grub.  When you're throwing back the high ABV beers, sooner or later you will need to please the hunger that dwells within.  We've tried a wide variety of items from their menu, and have yet to stumble across anything that we wouldn't order again.  Maybe I'm crazy, but I think their pizza dough/crust tastes better than at the Nellis location.

Keep an eye out for Aces on Groupon.  Occasionally, they have half-off offers that are redeemable both food and/or drinks.  Their Groupon offers ARE location specific though."}
{"text":"I've tried this place 3 times.  They are always running a Groupon deal and I will always take advantage of deals... It seems like every single time I've gone in there they are either short staffed or their servers just never come back to the table.  On my first visit we were sat in this large room...away from everyone.  My brother in law ordered about 5 different beers from their menu...and they were out of ALL of them.  ALLL OF THEM.  Our food was overdone.  On my last visit... I went in to watch the game and eat some pretzels and cheese curds and chicken tenders with my sister.... I ordered a water with no ice because I was hot ... maybe because we and a bunch of other people sat outside locked out for about 15 minutes...even after pounding on the door... it took my sister calling the bar to see if they were open for someone to actually come open the door.  I ordered my water without ice and then when the food got there i ordered an iced tea.  The server brought me iced tea without any ice.  I didn't ask for no ice... so after about 15 minutes she finally returned from where ever she was no doubt hiding in the back ...i asked for ice... she looked at me like i asked her to bring me a brand new meal... complained that i ordered water without ice and that she ASSUMED i wanted the tea without it... no... i just made it easy for her...just asked for a cup of ice and for the side of lemon and sweetener I had already asked for... overall...the food is decent and the Groupon deal makes the price worth it... but I'd rather never go there again that put up with their terrible service."}
{"text":"Phenomenal service, delicious drinks & eats. 

Love this place, especially with Krystal behind the bar! Had some great brews for a reasonable price and the piggy back fries, substitute in sweet potato fries! To die for.

{"text":"We were really impressed with their classic hamburgers.  We had stopped at the nearby LaQuinta after driving for 7 hours and were tired and hungry. Food often tastes particularly good after driving all day, but the burgers were out-of-this-world. Cooked to medium rare perfection, covered with fresh lettuce and juicy tomatoes and a wonderful bun, they were so big I couldn't finish all of the fries or dill pickle that came with my burger. We will eat here again when in the area."}

We were not disappointed.  

Starts with a good selection of beer. 

We ordered the bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers and cheese curds.  Both we prepared and presented very nice.  

We ordered pulled pork tacos, and bacon burger and a pulled pork sandwich complete with a fried egg.  

Every dish was presentee beautifully and tasted delicious.  

I'm looking forward to my next Vegas visit."}
{"text":"Service was fantastic! The beer on tap was fantastic! The waiter was really helpful in helping us decide what beer would suit each of us. The parmesan cheese fries are to die for."}
{"text":"Well I love craft beer, so I was anxious to find a good place to check out new beers in Vegas.  I read up all the reviews for months before we finally moved here and it seemed like Aces & Ales was definitely the place to be.  We finally were able to visit the bar for the strong beer fest, and the beer list is AWESOME. The prices were pretty average for craft beer ($8 for 12oz), but I noticed that they have a really great happy hour - $4.50 for 12 oz - every day from I think 10pm to noon. The staff was super friendly and helpful, but they were definitely a little overwhelmed with the big crowd for the strong beer fest.
The minuses are definitely the Boulder Highway location - it will have to be a special occasion for me to drive all this way. Also, I wish the ambiance had a little more to offer than an old Big Dog's Tavern with the lights up super bright. Overall, 4 stars, mostly because of the general lack of craft beer in this town."}
{"text":"**UPDATED**
If you like craft beer, you absolutely need to make a stop here. Lots of great craft brews on tap and even some \"on nitro\" that give it that creamy Guinness-like mouth-feel. THey have a lot of great vintage beers like Vertical Epics dating back to 2005. 

I've yet to order a meal here but the appetizers are a must.  The Arrogant Bastard Onion Rings are exactly how I remembered from the early days of The Stone Bistro and Gardens but my true love is the deep fried cheese curds. The wings are fantastic but I wish they had an extremely hot version. 

On a particularly busy night we had some issues with getting the waitress' attention and getting our order in a timely fashion. She was aware of the issue and gave us some beer on the house. Much appreciated. All of the other times we went they did fantastic, so no complaints. This is my go-to spot now.
--
UPDATE: I've been here many times since and have ordered meals and have been very pleased. The pizzas are top notch. Never had an issue with service since even when we're alone on the patio. This is now my go-to spot. So much so that when we decided on a place for a monthly meetup for our group we unanimously chose this place and haven't even entertained the possibility of moving it elsewhere."}
{"text":"10$ chicken pieces - 3 small pieces 6$ desert - a small piece Chips - ok but cold 12mins late Mac and cheese was ok.  Terrible experience"}
{"text":"This place is a must visit if you are in vegas and are a microbrew fan. Their draft selection is the best in vegas, the atmosphere is laid back with tons of tvs (we were there for sunday night football), and the food is outstanding. It is a little off the beaten path, but it is well worth the trip."}
{"text":"We went for the spaghetti pizza we've heard so much about and it did not disappoint! It was so friggin' good! Spaghetti layered with pepperoni and sausage covered with cheese on a pizza crust...mmmm...will definitely be going back! The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because they allow smoking in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Myself , wife and 2 friends decided to check out Aces and Ales for lunch before the Guns n Roses Concert last Friday, What a GREAT decision that was!! The staff was extremely friendly, outgoing and very knowledgeable about the beers and menu. Immediately you felt good being there. Started our meal with the Ahi Poke which I HIGHLY recommend!! and a ice cold pilsner. My main course was the stuffed hamburger (awesome) and the onion rings (also awesome!!) The bar has a Rock n Roll feel to it and the music that was playing made the atmosphere fantastic! This will be a go to place when I hit Vegas!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this cute little bar. Tonight we were totally taken care of by Matt and Austin and let me tell you they rocked it. But as I explained to them, I have been in this place maybe 5 times and every time the customer service has been 100% and the food and OMG the beers all amazing every time. And I am a crappy customer. I will wait until people buy food so I can sneak a little and try everything before committing. But everything is always good. Tonight, another A+ night so I had to leave a YELP review. They took care of us and they were so adorable, as we left they gave us a FREE water bottle because we were complaining about having to go out in the heat. When I was done drinking, my water glass was never empty. As soon as my fork and napkin hit my plate they snatched it up. They just GET IT DONE. I love this place. If you love GOOD beer and good food and you love SUPERIOR (practically NON existent) Customer Service then this is your bar. I can't wait it for it to cool down a little so I can be planted outside because their outside patio rocks too! Thanks Matt and Austin. You rock!!!"}
{"text":"This is something Vegas needed or, at least, something I needed to find in Vegas: a really great beer bar.
Tap selection was not only impressive and prices very reasonable, but they have an electronic board for the tap list that shows the approximate QUANTITY OF THE KEG and changes its color from green to red when it's low. F'in genius! I love that and I wish more places would do it, because it just pushes the beer snobs like me to drink something we may have otherwise passed up, but then regretted not getting when they're out of it next time.
A nice round-up of pretty much everything good you can get in the area, including Sierra Nevada Narwohl, Stone Double Bastard, Maui/Jolly Pumpkin Sobre Humano, a couple of Speakeasys, a Dogfish, a Uintah, etc.
The food menu is actually pretty impressive too. They have a few pizzas, one of which has spaghetti on it. The bartender (who was really nice and helpful) insisted that it sounded weird but was delicious. We got an order of Beer Bites, which showcases their pizza crust, and is served with a homemade, mustard-based sauce. The sauce was a little weird, but I love that they're trying something unique. Bread itself was excellent. The people next to us got a pizza... Food envy...
I'm a beer bar guy, but I also like sports. And they have lots of TVs. This is a problem at many beer bars who often have no TVs or maybe one, in a corner, with a 14\" screen. Why can't I watch a football game while drinking an excellent craft beer? So this may be exactly what I want from a beer bar.
Downsides are, of course, the smoke. They also get a pretty weird crowd for a place that serves what could only be called \"gourmet beer.\" A lot of MIller Lite bottles passed around while we were there. Didn't think much of the music either, but I'm probably more snobby about that than I am beer.
Staff were awesome. Really can't say that enough. Willing to answer annoying questions and give tastes. Very knowledgeable about the beer. They also have a pool table, but it's in a separate room, so it's not really noisy.
I also have to give props to the bottle selection. They have an enormous menu and a cooler full of specialty bombers that they've collected and will sell for a collector's price. If you have someone to share with, I would recommend going that way, if you can resist the taps (which is tough), because it's just that good."}
{"text":"The beer selection is amazing!  Great vodka tonic! Then the food came. Wow! I really wasn't expecting such good food! Hubby got the Arrogant Bastard steak sandwich with onion rings!  These are some serious onion rings!  Yum!!! I had the beer something cheese sandwich with tomato basil soup and fries!  Sooooo good! Loving watching Thursday night football with excellent sound.  It's drowning out the high pitched voice girls beside us!! Yeah, we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went back two nights later after my boyfriend and I ran a race in Boulder Dam and one of the bar managers was there. We had a fantastic night! They had a great selection of beers on the list and we stayed for hours. I again got the fried cheese curds. A-MAZING! 

I have no idea what this soapy glass business that people complained about. I didn't see a single one.

This is definitely a hike from the strip but it is by far the best beer selection we saw in Vegas. Also, the prices are very reasonable and you can get a good beer, with an actual taste, for the price of crappy beers on the Strip."}
{"text":"So far, 1 for 1.

Aces & Ales is a bar that's surprisingly close to my \"Northern\" Henderson home, enjoying its own home alone in a small lot just off Nellis about half a mile from Boulder Highway. At first glance, it doesn't look like anything special inside, but a wall of tap handles from depleted kegs and the updated draft list itself (also available on their web site), which is chock full o' interesting craft beers.

Happy Hour was just the right opportunity for me to show up. It's 4-6pm and midnight-2am daily, except for Sundays (when it's all day). Draft beers, wine glasses, and cocktails are $2 off, as are appetizers. Also, pizzas are 1/2 off at this time.

I've been exploring the world of craft beers for a while, and Aces & Ales has reportedly been one of the best if not the very best bars for that sort of thing in town. I finally showed up so that I could try my beloved Canadian Breakfast Stout ($8 happy hour, $10 regularly for the 8 oz pour), aka CBS. It's a pricey limited-release bourbon barrel-aged imperial stout by Founders Brewing Co which I'd completely enjoyed before at a different bar. This time, the coffee was far more prominent in the flavor profile compared to the expected maple and vanilla flavors, so I didn't quite love it as much as my first time, but I appreciate that Aces & Ales was offering this particular beer on draft.

Next, I picked up a glass of the Modern Times's Mega Blazing World ($5 HH, $7 normal for a pint), having not tried this \"imperial\" version yet of one of my favorite San Diego brewery's amber ales. This one barely had the typical amber-ness because of hoppy flavors filling the palate before and after it had warmed up. I liked it though, and it didn't taste very bitter at all.

At this point, I wanted to order Black Market's French Toast Vibes, but the bartender asked me if I wanted a small taster instead, perhaps thinking that I hadn't liked my 2nd beer's flavors because I'd slowed my drinking pace so much (no ma'am; I was feeling the alcohol). I accepted the offer and got to sip on a surprisingly cinnamon-y and syrupy stout, which I'm sure I would have enjoyed had I ordered the full 11 oz pour ($6 HH, $8 normal).

Instead of that, I picked another option, which was North Park's Mocha Massage ($7 HH, $9 normal for a 11 oz pour). This is my first taste of another San Diego brewery, one which a beer-loving San Diego friend had lauded before but not been able to fit in my hectic day trips yet. It's also marked on the menu as an \"exclusive,\" which the 'tender said was because it's not distributed through normal channels in the Las Vegas area. Instead, someone had driven there, gotten special permission, and \"imported\" it. Anyway, the Mocha Massage is easily a top 2 if not favorite coffee stout for me, with huge coffee flavor in every sip but low bitterness.

I almost let the occasion pass without ordering any food, but with the $2 discount for appetizers, one of the two Devil's Eggs variants ($4 HH, $6 normally) sounded too good to pass up. It's four pieces of what appeared to be large eggs (maybe jumbo?) and this recipe was topped with smoked salmon and flavored with dill, oil, and lemon. The eggs were delicious and not overcooked, the smoked salmon was as delicious as my drunken palate could have appreciated, and the other flavors were balanced. I was very happy that I changed my mind.

Aces & Ales simply rocks (including the music, which was heavy on alternative rock with some classics thrown in). I haven't seen much more from a bar than a wide variety of rotating craft beers, good food (well, at least the one item), regular check-ins by bartenders, and relative proximity to home. and the weekday happy hour visit was a lovely time. I will be back again for their happy hour and/or Sunday all-day happy hours."}
{"text":"On my 1st visit here I ordered the juicy lucifer and ordered it medium. It was cooked well and it wasn't too spicy that I couldn't eat it. I loved it. I love spicy food. My husband asked me where I wanted to it the other night and I asked to go back to have this burger again....

This time around I don't know if it was the sauce or what. Despite putting the jalapeño to the side then trying to eat just the patty with a fork...3 small bites max and I just couldn't. It was 20x spicier than before. I mean I love spicy food so why couldn't I eat it? Furthermore, it was undercooked, pink and the patty couldn't keep together. I know what juicy Lucy's are and despite having cheese in the middle the party shouldn't crumble. The waitress seemed annoyed and looked at me weird when I was complaining about the food. No apologies but more judgement from her reaction. I very, rarely return food. She told me she would have to talk to the manager to replace my food that I picked because I did pick a spicy burger. Instead of saying \"I'm sorry, let me see what we can do to fix this for you\" ..she made me feel embarrassed and it was a turn off so I just decided to not even exchange. I kept the fries because they were delicious.  

My husband enjoyed his food. He got a turkey, avo and bacon sandwich. We enjoy the beers and the selection there.

After a short wait the manager came out and talked to us. He was very kind and offered to replace my meal and make things right. At that point I lost my taste buds lol and couldn't eat anymore so I declined. However, I love that he came out and took the time. What a stand up guy. Overall, I think this place is great, love that they rotate beers and it gives you a chance to try different beers from all over. My hometown is San Diego, CA so it's nice to drink beers from that area too. Especially since we lived in CO for 5 years before moving to Vegas. It's nostalgic as our first date was at Pizza Port and it's nice to enjoy drinks from there.

 I definitely want to come and try out some karaoke and try more of the food because everything on the menu looks good. And of course check out the new rotation of beers :) 

Five stars because the manager made the effort to show he cares for the establishment and his guests."}
{"text":"Good beer! Great food! Everything on menu is good, especially the breakfast burrito. Different beer selection almost everyone I go in!"}
{"text":"This place has an awesome happy hour and really yummy drinks and food. If you're looking for a chill spot to hang with friends and enjoy quality food and drinks come to this place!"}
{"text":"I'm a definite fan after one visit, and plan on checking Aces & Ales out again soon. It definitely has a great selection of beers with a solid pub-style menu. 

My buddy and I worked our way through 4 beers each with a steak wrap, a chicken bit of sorts, and fried cheese curds that everyone raved about. 

The service was great, and friendly, and the place quickly filled with regulars and tourists as we sat and enjoyed our grub. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came in with my boyfriend and we sat at the bar. We were greeted immediately and beers explained to us as well as samples offered.  We ordered our food.. Fish tacos and stuffed burger .. They were both delicious .. Oh yea we got the sea salt and vinegar chips to start .... Yummmmmmm! Over all had a good experience here and will definately suggest it to others..."}
{"text":"My initial impressions of Aces and Ales II on Tenaya were less than favorable.  I sat at the bar and was ignored by the bar tender who walked by me twice before standing around talking to another customer who already had his drink.  Then I noticed the sign on the poker machine saying the seat was reserved for players only.  I was not in the poker playing mood.  I have never seen that anywhere else.  I thought that was kind of rude.  All I wanted to do was order a pizza to go and get a beer while I waited.  I ended up sitting in along the wall and eating there.  Service, when service was recieved, was great.  My server was very friendly and helped me to decide on a beer since I was lost in the number of options they have available.  I settled on a seasonal pumpkin porter.  Holy cow was it ever spiced.  It had a kick to it, no doubt about that.  It was good though. When my pizza came out, the Eddie Spaghetti pizza by the way, my server told me I had to finish it all.  Challenge accepted!  This was some wicked pizza.  Thick and fluffy crust with a bit of a chew and a crunch on the edges.  It is a special kind of pizza topped with spaghetti and meat sauce, pepperoni, spicy Italian sausage and mozarella cheese.  I loved it and wanted to keep eating but alas I could go no further.  Challenge failed.  No worries though.  I was able to take it home where I managed another three meals out of it.  Each reheating was just as good though the spaghetti dried out a bit.  Upon settling my tab I was offered a couple of coupons for a free beer.  I will be back soon to try more seasonals."}
{"text":"First off... The menu is big as hell! Almost as big as a torso. Once you open it, then the fun begins... I like the creative, food selections of the Mac & Cheese and Grilled Cheese... Btw, if you like CHEESE, you will love this place."}
{"text":"This is a good place to watch some NFL on Sunday.  The food is creative and never disappointing.  You have to try the Wisconsin Cheese Curds if it's your first time.

The beer list is a lot of Stone Brewery and analogs.  I usually get the Woodchuck Cider draft.  I can't believe how much better Cider Ale taste on tap compared to the bottle, night and day."}
{"text":"As of now, my favorite bar in Vegas. Absurdly good beer selection. Not the largest I've seen, but everything on the list is always worth trying. No gimmicky flavor-of-the-month beer here. Karaoke night is a good time. Seats are comfortable. The food is priced incredibly cheap, considering the taste. The menu puts a creative spin on typical bar fare, without being pretentious. Try the chicken sandwich. The slaw is insane. The jalapeno poppers are made of real peppers, and are actually spicy. As a chili-head, I approve. Wait staff are attentive, and your glass rarely stays empty for long. This is the place to drink!"}
{"text":"Having experienced the good old A&A a whopping twice now, my heart breaks that I can't honestly dole out that well-deserved fifth star. But this place is amazing nonetheless and truly a beer connoisseur's wet dream come true!

Our first visit garnered a perfect 5. Easy to find, plenty of parking, friendly staff, price is right, decent happy hour (I think a buck or two off pints and an IMPRESSIVE discounted food menu -- mac and cheese, sliders, beer bites, mini pizzas, each $5 and so worth it), INCREDIBLE BEER SELECTION. You name it, A&A probably has it down pat.

My most recent visit, however, left something to be desired. The joint was filled to the hilt (AFC/NFC Championships + Winter Beer Fest = crazy go nuts), so understandably service may not have been as awe-inspiring as last time. But the beautiful ladies serving us were a bit rushed, occasionally pushy, and slightly clueless in terms of communicating with one another. But let's get to the point, shall we?

Winter Beer Fest = $15 for a SMALL commemorative glass (cool), $4 to fill said glass with whatever (meh). Those not choosing to participate (like myself) HAD to pay for $8 pours. There were no other regular-priced pint options of ANY kind. I mean I am super happy to have gotten some of these heavenly concoctions into my tasting arsenal. Don't get me wrong. But it is hard to justify $8 for EIGHT OUNCES of something when it doesn't ordinarily cost as much. Boooo. I felt slightly ripped off; I don't mind paying a hefty penny for variety, but I don't feel the same \"WOW!\" factor as I did before. Plus, it's too dark.now.

Anyway, A&A is definitely worth the side trip if you're at all into the brewed alcoholic beverages. Stop by between 11-3 (am OR pm, I believe) for happy hour -- check in on Untappd to see your name scroll by on the sweeeeet electronic beer board -- but try to avoid anything that has the word \"Fest\" attached to it!"}
{"text":"The reviews talking about all the smoke made me very leery of this place, but since that is the standard in LV, and A&A was convenient to my hotel, I tried it anyway.  I was pleasantly surprised.  While there was a smoke smell, it wasn't nearly as oppressive as I'd expected.  A&A also has a back patio, so we just sat outside and avoided the smoke altogether.

The bonus was that this President's Day weekend, A&A had a beer festival featuring some really unique, really tasty beers."}
{"text":"My friends and I just love this place! We come every other week or so for Trivia night, and it's always so much fun (Tuesdays 8 pm-10 pm ish).  The atmosphere is really fun, servers are super friendly and food is soooo good.  And trivia is free to play! 

Here are our favorite dishes:
- Onion rings (very greasy, but that's how I like them!)
-Pretzel bites 
-Pepperoni pizza (crust is homemade!!)
-Ahi tuna salad 
-Beer cheese soup (it sounds strange but is sooo good)
-Fried Oreos (duh)

Here's what I would skip:
-Chicken fingers (always kind of dry and unexciting)
-Fish and chips (same problem as the chicken fingers, and malt vinegar served in a spray bottle...)
-Spaghetti pizza (too weird)
-Mac and Cheese (it's verrrryyy richhhhh.  So try it if you like that sort of thing)

Also they have a HUGE selection of alcohol, but I can't comment on it because I don't drink.  I'm sure it's good."}
{"text":"Sticky tables.... Is the reason for my 3 star review. Other then that place is good and speedy service.  Everyone's very nice and drinks are awesome."}
{"text":"Yeah. This place is not good. We arrived, walked in to about 1/3 capacity crowd. We walked around for 10 minutes trying in vain to get anyone's attention. There were 2 servers in deep discussion behind the bar, but they could not be disturbed. Finally I went and stood in the servers station at the bar, the bartender showed up. Says we had to move. I asked him if I gave him money, could he give us drinks since the servers were apparently on strike? We sat had our drinks, waited forever for some crappy fried things, threw cash on the table and split. Not worth the stop."}
{"text":"Best place for a good burger and deserts, love ordering here and just great service and food."}
{"text":"Should be zero stars. I find this place has shady and sketchy pricing, so when the bill comes WATCH OUT! Happy Hour prices are a joke after going today. I doubt they applied the $2 beer discount to all the beers, which were ALL ordered during happy hour. This is the same thing almost every time I've gone - not some one time occurrence."}
{"text":"An unassuming entrance leads to a large horseshoe bar and perimeter seating with prompt service for a Friday evening.

The extensive menu runs the gamut of offerings, sure to please anyone willing to eat in an unfortunately smoky environment. (One of my biggest pet peeves while trying to enjoy anything eating or drinking.

The draft beer list is 20 deep; a good 20 but, the massive bottle list with fair prices and old vintages takes the cake here. Of course it was only after starting to write this did I find out that the bottle list is shared between the two locations so they might not have what's on it - which they didn't when it came to my selection.

I saved room for more beer and snacks on Fremont so I went with the OG Beer Bites which were nice little chunks of dough with chunky marinara and gooey cheese dip.

The service was key to making it a good experience, though - plenty of help to steer me in the direction of good local beer!"}
{"text":"Having visited the original A&A on the South East side of town, I was excited to learn they were going to open a location on the NW.

Atmosphere - The bar is very open and fun with 3 areas.  There is an outdoor patio and the inside is divided in two with a main bar area with gaming and tables and the other with long tables for better socializing.  They also have trivia night there occasionally.

Drink Selections - Stocked with a full bar and the rotating beer menu can't be beat, especially for locals.

Food - There is a good variety of items on the menu and I've always found the quality to be consistent for decent bar food. I know some people don't have great feedback on the food, some of my friends included, but after a couple pints you can't go wrong with some pretzel bites.

Considering these, Aces & Ales is an easy 4, if not 5 star.  It's unfortunate I feel I need to rate it a 3 based on the service.
Many times the bar seems to be understaffed with one bartender also working the surrounding tables.  Even with multiple servers, the service can be poor and slow.  With a table of 4-6 people ordering food and drinks, we've gone more than an hour without being checked on and any special request seems to be a burden.

Despite this, the bar is worth a visit to check on some beers you won't find anywhere else in the valley."}
{"text":"This place would be awesome if the music wasn't so shitty all the time. I'd rather hear the game than 80's hair metal."}
{"text":"I came in here the other night with a friend after drinking at another bar. We were super hungry and ordered the Mac n cheese, caprese grilled cheese and the buffalo wings. Holy crap. Everything was SO GOOD. Even the spicy cole slaw was amazing ! Washed everything down with a cold 805! Will definitely be returning. Not to mention the seats were really comfortable and the music was good!"}
{"text":"Carb lover's paradise.

Great beer selection and tons of typical bar food munchies. Super spacious and clean on the inside. 

The Eddie Spaghetti pizza is ridiculous, in a good way. Pretty much combining some of my favorite foods. It is so carby and heavy, I feel like taking a nap just thinking about that pizza. It's a pretty unique kind of dish and my parents just totally loved it."}
{"text":"I'm giving four stars because I'd like to think if we didn't take our food to go that it would've been more enjoyable. By the time my boyfriend and I got home to eat my tomato soup dip for my grilled cheese was cold. I ordered the Frenchie and expected a side of fries, apparently the ones on the sandwich were all I was getting...
Besides that, I thought it was good. Chill atmosphere and a helpful bartender. We didn't stay long enough to order any drinks, perhaps in the future."}
{"text":"The first time I came here was a few days after they opened the location. They had some growing pains in the kitchen for the next few times I went there. No problem, I understand. Recently the service is getting pretty bad. I've been waiting ~ 15-20 mins for my first beer. Which is ridiculous. When I confronted the staff all they could say is they were understaffed. I've seen other bars  with a single bartender and 1 or 2 servers handle a similar crowd with no issues. What the hell is up with this place. Their food is also hit or miss."}
{"text":"I forgot  Joe is a great bartender  and Eddie makes the best food Austin and kimberly are the best wishes it went back to food 24 hours 9 am is to late if you want breakfast"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious! Every time I go to vegas I have to come here at least once! Prices are low compared to other restaurants in vegas! However the reason to come here is for the bounty of bears on tap!!"}
{"text":"Love the food and the all the beer on tap! The beer belly grilled cheese. Loved the service I always get from Ali. Always knows to get me a #35 Alpine-Chocolate Oatmeal Stout. Awesome lunch box special from 11am-3pm and then Happy Hour starts at 3pm. Happy hour with $5.00 dollar beers and $5.00 food items."}
{"text":"I've been here few times.. The service is slow, and could be  a lot better. They have a good beer selection, but the happy hour could have more options beside mac and cheese. There is a cool back yard and you can play corn hole. Besides that that's really all... just your typical Vegas video poker bar."}
{"text":"SOOO SLLOOOWWWW.... been here a few times to see if it was a fluke, nope! Good food and drinks, but MAN the service takes ages to even be acknowledged/ get your order taken. The another long wait for the food. Every time."}
{"text":"I have been a fan of the Eastside Aces & Ales for a few years now, but only make it out that way on very rare occasions. This was my first time at the Westside location, which is far closer to my normal stomping grounds.

I arrived with another beer snob friend, who had also not yet visited this location, and we were immediately greeted by a very friendly waitress. She provided us with some suggestions on both food and beer. We did not take her up on the food (she did mention that the pizza oven was not yet installed), but did take her up on the beer.

There are 50 taps available, and I only saw one that was not craft (Blue Moon). The selection is very diverse with different styles and different breweries. I didn't immediately notice the size of servings on the beer menu, so I was a bit shocked when I didn't get a pint of my first beer. 

After having 3 beers (the Joseph James Citra Rye was my favorite of the evening) and receiving our bill, we noticed that all the beers we had were $6/each.

I really liked that the place is still new so I didn't walk out smelling like smoke. The staff was really friendly and the clientele was pretty low-key, which is exactly what I am looking for in a good beer bar.

I will definitely be back for the amazing beer selection and the delightful ambiance."}
{"text":"I came for the 1st Annual Strong Beer Festival, but will stay for the friendly staff and great selection of beer. On our way to A&A we got a little lost, but were able to find it. It is situated on the East Side of town near Sam's Town & Boulder Station. The first thing I noticed other than the very full parking lot, was all the microbrew and craft beer posters and ads on the outside of the bar. Not your typical \"Coors Light\" or \"Corona\" signs here. Walking in we were greeted with a fairly large bar area to our front and some pool tables to the left. The bar itself is pretty large with lots of video poker is that is your thing. Because it was pretty full, we went to the back of the bar area to find a table. Once the waitress made her way over to our table (it took a while because it was so busy) she was very friendly and helpful. After that point she was great for the rest of our time there. Looking at what they had on tap at that time (not for the Festival) and it was a good mix of styles and local and non-local brews. 
As far as the Festival goes, the selection was incredible! Many different styles from many different brewers. The staff was very passionate about these beers, and it was obvious. 
I am really looking forward to my next visit and the many beers I will sample at A&A."}
{"text":"Aces and Ales was a cool spot to catch the game. See Stephanie if you're in the dining area, she was great !"}
{"text":"So I came back and got garlic parm fries, candied bacon, onion rings and chicken tenders. Fries and bacon, amazing. Onion ring were good but way too greasy. Like intensely greasy and the chicken tenders was completely terrible... The breaking was burnt and the inside of chicken was very cartilagey and veiny which was weird to me.. Seemed to just be cheap quality of meat. But th candied bacon and fries are why I give 4 stars. I literally ate that everyday for like a week so good"}
{"text":"Fantastic staff, fantastic beer, fantastic owners. Pretty much a really good place to meet you friends at for dinner /drinks & chat! Reasonable prices and great selections."}
{"text":"Overall 4.5 stars! Even though we were hesitant and skeptical of being so far from the strip we wanted to trust the reviews that we had read.
Right off the bat service was excellent. And the menu was filled with delicious eats, good thing cause we were hungry. 

It was all pretty wonderful. Boneless wings, pizza bites, bastard cheese balls were amazing. So much flavor!

We are foodies and love our food! We were not disappointed. I docked .5 star since my steak tacos were disappointingly dry and under seasoned. But, the rest of our experience was enough goodness to bring us back really soon. Maybe even next weekend!  Drink selection was massive. We had some delicious martinis and beer.

To top off our night, owner Keri Kelli sat in seats right next to us. 

We will be back from California!"}
{"text":"Truly an Ace!! This place is not your typical bar and a huge relief after seeing so many PT's pop out throughout the valley.

Layout: We got here on a Monday afternoon at around 5 but soon after began to pile up for their huge karaoke night that started at 9pm (unfortunately we didn't have enough time to stay for it).  When you first walk in, there is a decently sized pool area on the left of the bar.  Continue to the right and the main bar is situated in the center with a few tables surrounding and a lone billiards table on the opposite end of the bar.  The area we sat was decorated with old beer levers, tap levers? whatever they're called but was really cool (the beers labeled on those levers are not all available for drinking).

Service:  Our server was really nice and warned us that he was new but was motivated to make sure we got great service.  Later towards the night the billiards table ate my money and the bartender working there was very friendly as well
*to play billiards ask for the balls first, once you're done and all the balls are inside, insert your four quarters to get them out.

Food: Now being at a bar across town, I didn't want to opt for the traditional wings and wanted to choose something more original and specific to this location.  The selection of food is just right and you're not too overwhelmed with selections (like at cheesecake factory).  We picked the shrimp mac and cheese ($12.5), arrogant bastard onion rings ($6) and the Eddie Spaghetti pizza ($20).  The shrimp mac and cheese was probably the cheesiest i've had a mac and cheese.  Literally the cheese could be stretched from one end of the bar to the other.  Macaroni itself wasn't tough and there were a generous amount of shrimp.  Overall mac and cheese was like a 4/5.  The arrogant bastard onion rings were PHENOMENAL!! The batter on the rings were none that i've ever had before, so crispy, onion will preserved and just so much taste in that ring.  It comes with bbq and ranch but the ranch is enhanced with a blend of herbs to give it such a rich garlicky, cilantro-eeyy taste.  The pizza was also amazing and massive (16 inches).  The pizza has a spaghetti base with the cheese, sausage and pepperoni placed over it.  This was a delight!

Alcohol: As the name suggests, there are only ale based beers on tap.  I think I saw someone drinking stella from a bottle but the menu features mostly ales.  The menu is extensive in terms of beer and other alcohols, literally like 6 pages of alcohol so I leave this part of the experience up to you! The only drawback were the serving portions of the alcohol.  They're not served in mugs or cups but in a shot glass that fits 2 big shots.  I mean the alcohol was there and got me feeling good, the content was a bit small.

Overall: This place is a hip bar that offers a great alternative to your typical bars in Las Vegas.  Good selection of amazing food and alcohol, a fun and friendly environment to just hang out with a friend or to party and sing along with potential new friends. GET THE ONION RINGS ! !"}
{"text":"From June until early November I was working more than 80 hours a week which left zero hours a week (and zero hours a month) to write Yelp reviews so I am playing catchup here but I remember good places. 

My coworker of two weeks was having her 21st birthday so what better way to introduce her to adulthood than to take her to Aces and Ales? Big Dogs was great (that is in another review I will write soon) but was getting old so we decided to try something a little different. 

We all sat down together outside on the patio. I ordered the Sierra Nevada Pale Ale as the Californian in the house (and my coworker who was from Chico was very proud since they brew it there). My other coworker arrived and ordered some beer/ale strongly wheat or barely based (this one always gets that). They enjoyed it. I enjoyed my Sierra Nevada as well. Then some ordered macaroni and cheese, that was also good. 

Then I noticed people were entering the main room and I wondered why. I heard they were singing karaoke. I had some choices on a song. The choice I had was Applause by Lady Gaga because cmon, we needed some cheering in here. 

I picked Applause which was the right decision (at the time) and sang. Boy did I get a strong reception. After this dinner, whenever anyone mentioned karaoke, they always pointed to me and said, \"Applause.\" That was a good choice at a good pub with strong beer and strong macaroni and cheese. Overall, I am very happy I was here and do not worry, Aces and Ales gets an Applause!"}
{"text":"Food was very good. Service was very bad. I had the chicken fingers which were good but the cheese soup was out of this world. Next time I'm getting a bowl. The service was horrible. Ordered a beer off the beer menu. A dark IPA. I was brought a pale ale about as light as I had ever seen  when I told her I ordered a dark IPA she told me she would check with the bar tender. Came back about ten minutes later to tell me it was a mistake and I ordered something else. About 15 minutes later (my friends beer was about gone by now) I asked where the beer was and she told be it's on the was to be patient.   Next time I'll make sure I have a different server"}
{"text":"Excellent deviled eggs (with maple syrup and bacon) and cheeseburger with steak fries. Just need a women's restroom and this place will be 5 Star (sign for women's restroom have to go through the kitchen)."}
{"text":"super great place wth high end beers at an extremely down to earth no frills un-doucher habitat. that being said it does suck ordering a raririty of a beer seldom seen in these parts and after paying somewhere around 6.50 it is brought to you in a tiny white wine glass. now before you go throwing your arms in the air, shaking you double chin, screaming \"this is proposterous\" and dropping your monocle in your over zealous glass of Pliny the elder i am somewhat of a beer aficionado my self. I do understand why certain high ABV beers are served in a goblet but a tiny white wine glass does permit of at lest one eye brow to be raised.

great ever changing draft beer selection that doesnt even warrant a look at the bottle list. Ive had the pepperoni pizza that left much to be desired with the pre made frozen crust but the belgium pomme frittes are astounding to be modest. fried extra crispy with copius amounts of maytag blu cheese and REAL CHOPPED BACON!!!!!! trust me one appetizer is a meal for two people.

the staff is extra friendly and while some may not be as beer savy as the patrons they are definitely eager to get your feed back.

this place puts Freaking Frogs draft list to shame. Not sure about the bottle selection but like i said no need here! their draft list changes faster than your kids fashion sense. Plus they are consistently hosting amazing brewer shindigs and events.

minus one star purely for the aforementioned price versus \"goblet\"

bottom line. you like fantastic craft beer then get your non Reinheitsgebot butt up and go!"}
{"text":"The food here is great. My boyfriend kept mentioning this bar and how he has never had a bad bite to eat. I gave in and went to watch a football game with him, only to find out I was disappointed in not coming in sooner. The bartenders were friendly and really helpful I'm not a beer snob so I don't know much. I ended up with a Peach Basil Moscow mule which was delicious! I'll definitely keep coming back for more wings and that yummy grilled artichoke."}
{"text":"Aces & Ales definitely takes me by surprise for it is far more sophisticated than your local bar.  It is located near Sam's Town and is open 24 hours.

We came on a Monday around 6 and it was fairly busy. We were able to grab a table in the corner and a server came by quickly after we sat. He gave us a menu of what beer they had available and I was sad the girly ones were out (pale ale & hefeweizen). He then asked if we were first timers and let us have a taste of one of their beers based on our preference. It was still too strong for my taste. We then ended up ordering a beer that said something about having raspberries and the Nip Slip martini which tasted like lychees. Both were good, but verrrry strong! I was babysitting my drink because I knew a lightweight like me couldn't handle it.

Now onto the food! It was what I initially wanted to try here, beer came second. We got the arrogant bastard onion rings to start off the meal and paired it with the shrimp mac and cheese and Eddie spaghetti pizza. Talk about carbs overload!! And they don't skimp on the servings, 1 appetizer and 2 entrees is more than enough for 2 people. We had to take home most of the pizza and half of the onion rings home. 

Arrogant bastard onion rings: everyone has raved about them being the business and I would have to agree! I didn't care much for dipping them in the BBQ sauce, so I asked for a side of garlic aioli and it worked much better. 

Shrimp mac and cheese: it came with 2 pieces of garlic bread on top. It was some of the cheesiest mac I've ever had. The best way to describe it would be a cheesy version of shrimp linguini, with a touch of lemon butter. It was different in a good way, but having it as mac and cheese was just throwing me off.

Eddie spaghetti: advertised as a deep dish pizza and it's ADDICTIVE. I was sad to see it wasn't truly a deep dish when we got it, it was more like a regular pizza topped with spaghetti and sausage and pepperoni. But my disappointment left me after my first bite, it was delicious! The pizza crust was buttery and crisp, reminiscent of pan pizza.  

We played a couple games of pool also.  We made the mistake of putting in money first.  Don't do that!  Ask the bartender for the balls and use your money at the end of the game to give the balls back to you.  

Great place to bring friends and enjoy the food and beer!"}
{"text":"The BBQ chicken pizza is beyond awesome!! Yes, it takes a few minutes. They're not little Caesars!! It's worth the wait!! Enjoy my friends!!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this place has bad reviews. We had a great experience here!

I had bought a Groupon for $15 for $30 worth of food and drinks, which I had no problem redeeming. 

We came here for Valentine's dinner, and I was pleasantly surprised to see hardly anyone here at 7 pm that night. You seat yourself (there is a sign explaining this), and we picked a nice booth on the bar side. I love the booths because they are pub table height but they have little rests to put your feet, so you aren't hanging in mid-air. 

Both the greeter and server were super nice. Heather, our server, took so much time explaining craft beer offerings to us, and let us sample one or two before deciding. We had a great time trying some new drinks and talking to the staff about them. 

For food, we ordered the ahi tuna salad and Arrogant Bastard steak salad (steak grilled to order). The food came out quickly, and the presentation was beautiful. Both tasted amazing. The ahi tuna was perfectly seared. 

I loved the ambiance in here as well. For a little bar, it's actually a tad romantic - low lighting, candles on the tables, great music playing. 

I def. want to come back to try their Tuesday night beer flights!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a wide range of beer, look no further than Aces & Ales! Their beer menu is massive and extensive, and while I am not a big beer drinker, I can see how someone who loves beer would enjoy this place. The food options are good as well -- I would recommend the fish and chips, the Jucy Lucy stuffed with cheese and chorizo, and the cheese curds (always get the cheese curds whenever you can). Their grilled cheese sandwiches are good, too, but as with any grilled bread sandwich, it can be a little greasy.

Why not five stars? The service has been hit or miss, in my experience. Last time we were there, the waitress was friendly, informative, and attentive -- yay! Other times, we've been almost ignored -- boooo. It's worth taking a gamble and visiting Aces & Ales, though!"}
{"text":"By far the best beer bar in Vegas! Always an amazing selection of craft beers on tap and the tap takeovers are always a good time. The menu is top notch, but the Buffalo Chicken Mac & Cheese is a must have. The service has always been outstanding also. Great bartenders!"}
{"text":"I'm from San Diego and I'm a total beer snob/geek depending on my mood! Geek when I'm excited, and admittedly snob when I'm bummed out or disappointed. This place is amazing!  They have 50 taps of stuff FROM San Diego, that we hadn't been able to find in San Diego! 

We went on a mellow Sunday for lunch, and I'm used to poor service at places when things are slow. They were amazing! Our bartender was very fun, knowledgeable and honest about what she did and did not like. 

All in all, this is my craft beer Vegas holy grail.   I have been looking for a place with good, well priced food and beer for years. Don't pay $16 for a bottle of Green Flash on strip! Save your money for the cab and head out to the Aces & Ales Tenaya location! 

We'll be back in August!"}
{"text":"We'd heard a lot about this place: great beer selection and good food.  Been wanting to try it so we did.  Very disappointing.  My husband loves the craft beers.  The sign outside says $4 pints, all beers, all days.  So, we go inside; it's very loud.  Not very many people in there at all (for a Saturday around 6 PM).  We're handed the large menu with the bottle beer selection, other drinks (I'm a wine drinker), and dinner menu.  We were also given a sheet of paper with the craft beer selections. Between the lighting and the very small print on the paper, you couldn't read the selections.  We were told there were boards posted to the left and the right of the bar, but DAH, we were seated and wanted to relax and order.  I ordered a white zin and while the bar maid told me the brand, wasn't recognizable; it was awful.  Why not get a Sutter Home or Berringer like a lot of bars.  Reasonable prices and not bad tasting.   My husband order his beer and gee, guess what, it was one of \"the beers\" that didn't come in the $4 pints.  He ordered a second beer, different type, and guess what again, it still wasn't the $4 pints.  When he ordered his second beer, he told the bar maid when you come back we'd like to order dinner.  Long story short: she came back with his beer; no mention of food; & when we saw her again, we asked to settle the tab and went elsewhere for dinner.  Doubt we'll every go back.  We went out of our way (about 10-12 miles) to go to this place because we'd heard so much about it; in my opinion, was a waste of our time when there are plenty of local bar/pubs closer to home with good food and much better service."}
{"text":"Very nice sports bar. They have their own unique beers instead of the name brands, but the waitress was extremely helpful in guiding us in the right direction. They will also do 'samplers' that can be helpful and fun as well.......
Food was on the upper level of bar food. I was disappointed, because they didn't have deviled eggs. On the menu they can be ordered three different ways, hey sounded pretty good.....
My husband got the wings and I got the pretzels, both were really good and worthy or returning!"}
{"text":"This place wreaks of cigarette smoke.  I understand here in NV you can smoke indoors but OMG this place should put better ventilation or vents that will suck that crap up.  I had to leave because my entire party was getting sick due to the smoking around us.
The food wasn't that great, the service was slow and we weren't able to finish watching the Hockey game which was the main reason we went."}
{"text":"Kim makes one hell of a Bloody Mary *drops mic* 
You won't be sorry you went! So many great events and great vibes!"}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday afternoon , the bar was full but the other side of the bar was not.  We walked around a bit then they seated us near the bar.  It took the waitress like 20 min just to get our drink order, after another 20 mins we get our beers which by the way they have a large selection.  After another 20 mins they waitress comes back and gets our food order. We ordered onion rings, a steak wrap and a grilled cheese sandwich.  The onion rings were  cold and greasy the steak wrap was mostly chunks of steak fat and the grilled cheese was ok but cold.  I think the only thing I enjoyed was the fries but i think It was because I was soo hungry.   Food was mediocre and the service was terrible. Will only give one star because of the beer selection.  Will not be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Fried Oreos are unbelievably amazing! Completely hooked. It's the main reason every time I think about returning.

There menu is gigantic. Literally. 

Huge beer selection on tap. 

Outdoor lounge seating available. 

Customer service is remarkable. Honestly for a neighborhood bar the service is better than some of the casino bars around town."}
{"text":"We went to try this restaurant because people have said it was good, not so much! The 50/50 bacon meatballs were overcooked, very dry and had chunks of bacon fat (sent them back). There was only 2 small pieces of fish in the fish & chips. The cheeseburger was kind of small and had wilted lettuce and a VERY thick whole slice of onion! Also no mayo (ketchup and mustard on the table). This after the waitress was very excited to tell us they serve huge portions! The next night my husband was talking to someone about it and they said you should only go to the Nellis location because it is totally different  (much better). We will not be returning here!"}
{"text":"Monday night football forget about! Nicole was awesome the other girl who came on after Nicole didn't chose to acknowledge us or give her name was bad!! I never write reviews however this girl had her friends  I guess that were there and more important Ihan patrons or anyone gambling. No drinks empty empty empty.... it was like pulling teeth to get one and then the kicker....300 or more dollars played the insult to injury....a bill!!! lol! Bye bye Aces and Airs! 31 years here one of the worst! Your food isn't worth it!!"}
{"text":"After a long day of work this is the place for Happy Hour. Ask for Stephanie. She's bomb  I recommend the pretzels"}
{"text":"I have never had a bad time at Aces & Ales. The beer selection is fantastic and is constantly rotating to new brews and the food is pretty darn good for a bar.

The only downside I have seen here is the waitstaff can get behind, is slow, and/or not enough of them."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Vegas the top thing on my list is Aces and Ales. First impressions mean everything and our Bartender Joe made sure our experience was the best. Our friend had numerous specials requests and Joe made sure they were all met. Great place to come for beer and delicious food to go along with it our food was gone to fast to take a picture, maybe next time. The other location does not have their kitchen open all night so another reason to come to this location! No matter what time of night we come in, we are welcomed with a smile! We are currently on our way back to Vegas and we know where our first stop will be. Make sure Joe is working when you go :)"}
{"text":"The food is good, the beer selection can't be beat, and they have a great happy hour 3-6pm. But the service is generally awful, but I am giving 5 stars still because it's a bar, and they have tv's and alcohol to keep you busy while you wait for service. 

If this was a family restaurant and the service was sub par I wouldn't go. But to me the beer selection and happy hour deals compensate enough for the service  

Happy hour is $5 for any draft, and they have like 50 to choose from"}
{"text":"I got the Buffalo Mac n Cheese and it's amazing. Piping hot too! The OG Beer Bites with the cheese were delicious. I will definitely order again. I didn't realize how close this place was to my house."}
{"text":"Have been going for years. The Eddie spaghetti pizza still my favorite thing although the wings are of epic proportion. Im talking dinosaurs size. Service is hit and miss except for the manager. He is on task like a cactus needle.. I love the selection of microbrews, but the prices always make my wallet cry just a lil bit. Overall quality beer, quality food. I miss Misty though. She added a lil sass. Worth a stop In for sure. There was a groupon floating around. Grab it up and head on in."}
{"text":"I'm a new fan of this place. I just wish it wasn't all the way on the other side of the valley. Hows about opening one on the west side?

I'm fairly new to the craft beer scene. In fact, I used to not care for beer at all. I'm really enjoying what I've discovered recently. My buddy is a beer snob and has been schooling me on the finer points of the brew. Honestly, it all goes over my head. I just know what I like.

We finally made it down to Aces & Ales because of a Deschutes-related event they had on Saturday night. My friend is all about this Oregon brewer and he didn't want to miss this opportunity.

As soon as we stepped in the door, we wasted no time. I asked the bartender about her favorite Deschutes. I put my trust in her and ordered the Jubel 10. It was probably a little strong for my first drink of the night. At 10%, it definitely got me going and I never looked back. It's not really my type of beer, but I still enjoyed it.

Next up on my itinerary was the Hop Henge, followed by the Hop Trip. I thoroughly enjoyed both beers, but I'd give the edge to the Hop Henge. It's a little sweeter and exactly what I hope a good IPA would taste like.

I took a break from the Deschutes and tried the Sah'Tea by Dogfish Head. It's supposedly infused with some chai tea. It was OK, but not really my cup of tea (pun intended). After that, I rounded out the night by switching back to the Hop Henge.

Somewhere in the midst of all this beeration, we ordered an interesting menu item - Wisconsin Fried Cheese Curds. It just sounded intriguing on the menu and it was even better in real life! Those cheese curds were perfectly breaded and fried, and were incredibly light and delicious.

The down side to all this hoppy goodness is the price. We spent a good amount on the night, but you get what you pay for. We also got to meet the owner of Deschutes. He offered to give us a free round, but by that point, our ride had arrived so we had to bounce. Our consolation was a free Deschutes glass."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this local sports bar. One of my main problems is that I can't ever find a bar that is not too smoky. Thankfully, this bar is different.  The ventilation is pretty good. During the spring/summer they open the patio doors which makes it even better. They also carry a large selection of beers, which makes your stay even more enjoyable!! The decor is nice and modern, it's definitely different from your typical PT's. The food is good for a bar. We ordered the cheese curds which were awesome. The melted cheese was also good, but it was not the best ever like some of the reviews make you believe. Lastly, we ordered some chicken nachos which were very average and would probably not order them again. Overall. A good place to come and watch some games close to home!"}
{"text":"The beer list is out of this world!!!!  Food was good but service was poor.  Waitress came to our table and drop off the menus without even a \"hello.\"  We were there for happy hour which ended at 6:00 PM.  at 5:45 we were done eating and wanted to order dessert.  One of the guests at our table tried to flag her down, she said she'd be right back and at 6:02 she stopped at our table.  He asked if we could have dessert while still on happy hour. She said no, it's over.  One guest at our table said, I flagged you down 15 minutes ago and you didn't come back so how is that my fault.  She just shrugged her shoulders and said it's only $1.50 more now anyway.   I personally didn't care either way, just thought she was rude to our friend.  

I will say, the fried oreo cookies were amazing as well as their grilled cheese sandwiches.  Old bastard onion rings were very good too.  Would have given a 5 star if not for the rudeness of our waitress.  T"}
{"text":"I freakin' love Aces and Ales!! We go hear weekly just for the BBQ chicken pizza. They have great prices on the food and beer. Their staff is ALWAYS friendly! I could go on and on about this wonderful establishment. Just go and see for yourself how amazing they are!!!"}
{"text":"This was the first place we hit for our most recent Vegas trip. One of the guys we were with had been here before so we came on his recommendation. The drink selection was great. I like beer, but not how I like whisky so I was pleasantly surprised to see a robust scotch collection as well including the Yamazaki 12 and 18 year (no Lagavulin though...) as well as Ardbeg, Laphroaig, Oban, etc. Everyone was happy with their drinks and the food was great as well. I had a steak wrap on the waitress' recommendation along with their onion rings. My friend had some buffalo Mac and cheese and I'm thinking of going back just to try that!"}
{"text":"Awsome beer selection on draft and in bottles!!! Staff is extremely knowledgeable!! If you are a \"beer snob\" this is the best place in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place is freakin amazing !!!was really Linda of skeptical about the knots don't ask why but was blown away with how tasty they are !im truly happy I found this place great food great music ...this place hits me right in the feelers lofl ...ps try the garlic bread bites just do it !!!youll thank me later ;)"}
{"text":"Good tap selection, but prices are a bit high. The food was good, in particular the Eddie Spaghetti Pizza. The staff (bartender and server) were awesome!

Probably won't be back as it allows smoking and of the 20 or so people in there, probably 18 were heavy smokers. But, it's Vegas. Live and learn."}
{"text":"Game day, date night or just havin a beer this place is a go to! The food is delicious, chef Jason knows his stuff. The beer is great and the atmosphere is casual. Just the place to be! If you have a chance to catch the master pairings event, do it! Well educated staff and DELISH pairings! Worth it!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great time, good drinks, and an amazing bartender (Sarah!), come to Aces & and Ales on Tenaya! Easily the best bar/pub in Las Vegas! If you're lucky enough to come while Sarah is on shift, she'll take great care of you, (so be sure to take care of her!) Food, drinks and service  - best in Vegas!"}
{"text":"1.5 hours later and we are still waiting for food! What a bummer! 
The last time we came it was great!
:("}
{"text":"Honestly, the real negative is all of the smoking. That comes from customers, not employees. The last thing I want to have in my face is smoke while I'm eating. We've given this place a second chance but couldn't avoid the avid smokers. 
The service is friendly and the food is tasty for top notch pub fare."}
{"text":"Great beers on tap to include a fantastic Stout selection. If you are looking for a place with a large outside patio, this is the place to be. The patio has comfortable seating, a large gas fireplace, and misting system for the summer Vegas heat."}
{"text":"Food is great and so is the service. We we're passing by and stopped by to catch a game. Atmosphere is laid back. The wings are great."}
{"text":"We came here for a birthday, but we've been recommended here previously because of Ruben's love for craft beers. I'm not a beer drinker, so my review is primarily based on the food and atmosphere. Their list of beers is impressive, mostly because of the sheer quantity, but so many were tapped out that night. Otherwise, everyone that ordered beer seemed to enjoy themselves. They also do flights or tastings, which is a great way to try several new beers!

The atmosphere is just like every neighborhood bar in town. Bar in the center, half booth seating around the exterior, dark, a few TVs, and lots of smoke. It was really clean, but I found it difficult to enjoy while smoke from the bar found its way to overwhelm me at the booth. We had a wonderful server (I wish I could remember her name) and she was with us for most of the evening. Another server took over at the very end of our duration (after checks were settled, etc) and she seemed to want to ignore us.

The food is not very good. I've seen many reviews mention this fact and you'd be wise to heed it. Of course, I needed to try it for myself (and you might feel the same way). We ordered Bacon Cheddar Fries ($8), French Fries ($5), and Chicken Tenders ($9). The fries were all right, but the bacon and cheese were not worth the extra $3. The cheese was not \"smothered\" like the menu claimed and very dry. The chicken tenders were decent. All white breast meat, moist, and nice buttermilk breading (fried). Both dishes came with their ranch dip that was really thin and didn't have much flavor.

Come for the craft beers, eat somewhere else."}
{"text":"Dude was an asshole. My friend ordered a pineapple juice and the guy literally mocked him. As soon as he handed my friend (Our DD for the night) his juice, the bartender turned around and said \"f***ing pineapple juice seriously\". We let that slide whatever, but then I asked for a Tokyo tea and they didn't even have the items to make it, so I didn't want anything. Other friend went on to ask about certain beers and the bartender continued to have an attitude. After that we just decided to leave right away. Took our business else where."}
{"text":"Stopped in the other day for a business meeting.  It took a few minutes for my eyes to adjust to the dark interior. The dim lighting makes it a perfect place to take a friend you don't want to be caught with!

Back to the beer... I was impressed by the number of beers on tap. The service was a little too helpful.  I wasn't a 1/3 done with my drink and the waitress wanted to know if I was ready for another!  There were only two other people in the bar.  I guess this place gets busy later in the day."}
{"text":"Update! We've come back twice recently to feel it out again. Feels like a whole new place with the same cool vibes and awesome beer list. The food is timely, delicious and looks great, service is really good again. We'll be back! Thanks Aces!"}
{"text":"Now that this place has chilled out on the over controlling of sitting at the bar without playing max bet, it has greatly improved. Guess what? You're welcome at the bar! Isn't that a great idea at a bar! The food is good, beer list is great, and the environment is dark & intimate. Plus the newer bartenders are much friendlier. I just wish it were larger."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good place to get a cider. I didn't find the place!

This is a typical dive bar you can smell the cigarette smoke a mile away. 
As soon as we got there we got good service the bartenders were very nice and served us really well. I ordered the tomato basil soup, yes in a bar I know, and Parmesan fries. The food wasn't the best, the soup was a bit too thick for my liking  and the fries were a bit too greasy. 

The cider itself was pretty good it was the only one they had raspberry woodchuck I believe. I didn't hate the place but I won't be a regular on this one.

The price was not bad at all but I'd rather pay extra and go to a nicer place."}
{"text":"Visited A&A last Thursday....  Nice place with pool tables... A big plus for me.   The beer selection and menu is really good.  I wanted to try something different and the bartender was very nice and gave me a few samples of beer before I arrived to one I liked.... 

I was hungry so I ordered the Wisc. cheese curds, which was very good, I also ordered the steak wrap,  but when it arrived it was very cold.  Not slightly warm, cold!  But I didn't mention anything and i still ate it,  the steak was thoroughly cooked and even though it was cold it was good.  The bartenders are very nice and very attentive..... I would definitely go back again...."}
{"text":"I really should have done a review on this place before, as we are regulars and love this place.

First off, if your into craft beer, this is probably your best spot to go in all of East Las Vegas (though there are plenty of good places in Henderson to). They have twenty drafts that are constantly changing. Some beers may only last a week, some longer, but they don't have anything permanently, so there is almost always something new.

Prices are very reasonable, with most 16oz pours in the $5 to $6 range. They always have a few high gravity pours that run $8 to $9 for 8oz, but they are usually worth it. And they will almost always let you taste whatever you want. I usually only get the expensive stuff during happy hour, when all drafts are two dollars off. They even comp the 16oz pours if your gambling ($1 average of course).

Speaking of happy hour, it's 4pm to 6pm everyday but Sunday, when happy hour is all day long. If you have a growler they will fill it for half price on Sundays. This makes most of their beers $10 for a growler fill, and $22.50 for the pricy stuff. Honestly you can't beat that price for 64 ounces of high quality beer.

One more note on happy hour, they have half priced pizza and food specials. There half price pizza is obviously homemade and blows PTs half price pizza out of the water. Most of the delivery pizza places I have tried around here aren't near as good, and you can get a pie for under $10 during happy hour.

And all there food is good. I've never had anything here I didn't like. They are known for their mac and cheese and have some great sandwiches.

Oh and we love the staff. All the bartenders are friendly and do a great job. Dani and Kim are who we usually see (based on the hours when we come in) and they are great, but everyone else we have met had been good to.

I honestly have friends and coworkers that have told me how lucky I am to live down the street from this place. They have two locations, though I have never been to the other one, but I can attest that the Nellis location is awesome. If you are a fan of beer and/or bar food, and you are on the east side, this is a must try."}
{"text":"I had such a great time at this bar tonight at the Ballast Point event!!! Misty and Matt were on point!!!! Along with everyone else!! Definitely a place to check out!"}
{"text":"Great draft & bottle choices. Always something great that you probably won't find too many other places in the valley.

Tasty food. The Hoppy Hour is a deal worth checking out. 

Had the Juicy Lucy this visit. Yumm. Burger stuffed with chorizo & cheese. Perfectly cooked."}
{"text":"Excellent choice of the more unusual & tasty craft beers on tap here. Great bottle choices too. Make sure to visit during their Strong Beer fest. Great food & fun bartenders,"}
{"text":"Always a big smile from Helen as soon as we walk in the door, very welcoming and the food was awesome! Best grilled cheese I've had in a long time! Went to the brewery down the street was so disappointed, this will always be my go to place! I'm very glad I'm back"}
{"text":"I love this place. It has a very local feel. Some of the best staff in Vegas. They're very knowledgeable about the craft beers served, and very personable. If you enjoy craft beer not found anywhere else in Las Vegas, and service, you must make this a stop."}
{"text":"Great beer selection and friendly service. Enjoyed the atmosphere and delicious appetizers. Just wish it was closer to my home"}
{"text":"Nice little hidden gem. They make some great bloody Mary's and have a huge selection of craft beers.  Great selection of food and love that they have TVS everywhere.  We will definitely be back the next time we come to vegas !"}
{"text":"Aces & Ales is definitely a local bar you want to visit if you're in search of craft beers on draft.  This locations boasts up to 50 beers on tap at any given time.  A neat feature of this bar are the TV's that list all draft beers along with pertinent information: type of beer, alcohol content, brewery, and amount of beer left in each keg.  If none of the 50 beers appeal to you (you'd have to be quite picky to not find something you like) they have a large bottled selection as well.  Few bars in town can compare to Aces & Ales' broad selection.

Outside of drinks, they have a full kitchen serving up sandwiches, chili, burgers, nachos...all the types of food you can expect from a bar.  Much of the food is also fried, so be prepared to deal with that; the amount of oil can be overwhelming.  The best thing I've had here has been the Juicy Lucy, a burger stuffed with cheese.  Outside of that, I can't say that I necessarily look forward to eating here.

Also of note is that onTuesdays at 8:00pm, there is a weekly pub quiz hosted by Geeks Who Drink.  It lasts 1.5 - 2 hours, and bar tabs are up for grabs for the 1st and 2nd place teams.

Come for the beer, stay for the pub quiz, but only order some food if you haven't already eaten.  Aces & Ales strives to cater towards craft beer enthusiasts, and they do an excellent job of that."}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for above average bar food. The Mac and cheese is delicious and they have multiple varieties. Their food menu is also available all night. They're beer selection is hard to beat with 50 beers on tap. The service is good and they do have video poker at the bar."}
{"text":"Great hole in the wall! They have a huge selection of beers and the food is very very good! I love The Hangover Burger! And the Boneless orange chicken is to die for! I probably go here every couple weeks during my lunch break and the staff is very attentive and courteous as well are most of the customers if you want to shoot a game of pool they have plenty of tables to do so"}
{"text":"my boyfriend and I went here last night since we heard such good things and we loved it. Krystal was our server and she was super helpful and attentive! atmosphere was laid back everyone was watching some type of game. food was pretty good too! on and to the lady that complained about the sticky tables--the heat and humidity stripped the polish from the table, nothing the bar could've controlled but they are getting them redone soon :)"}
{"text":"The bar food here is extraordinary and so is the beer! My boyfriend and I love going here and trying all the different kinds of beer they have to offer. The bartenders and servers are always so kind! The outside patio has a really nice fireplace. I love this place."}
{"text":"I have been to Aces twice for their winter beer fest. It's a fantastic place for craft beers. Recently they have added more (and more comfortable) seating as well as new flat screen tvs.

Again I can only give Aces 4 stars because they need to open another location by me. I can't be forking over 55$ for a cab ride every time that I want to drink some beers. The beers are so good! 

Food is decent and fairly priced. Service can sometimes be spotty, but the last two times I have been there it's been very good."}
{"text":"Went for the 107.5 radio event on a few different Thursday nights.  I'm not much of a beer connoisseur so I really relied on the bartenders to help me find something I would like.  They were so patient and found me my perfect beer.  

Now on to the food.  We tried a lot of things with the standouts being the mac and cheese with lobster (yum), wings (perfectly cooked and tasty), prime rib dip and saving the best for last......the spaghetti pizza!  This thing is insane and made me the envy of my whole section.  Deep dish and layered with pepperoni, what seemed like several types of Italian sausage and of course spaghetti.  It is a lot to eat, probably weighs in at 20 lbs, so bring reinforcements.  I had 3 other people and still took almost half to my teenage son who immediately fell in love with the pizza.  Oh and their ranch is to die for.  Asked for a gallon to go...eh I tried anyway.  Waiting for this pizza to show up on one of those best eats shows.  DO IT!!"}
{"text":"Bring your patience. Lunch is super slow.
Beer cheese soup...PASS
Steak salad? Still waiting for that.
UPDATE 
Steak as cold as the dressing soaked salad.

I think I'll stick to Sunday brunch when they have their a game in the kitchen
Girl waiting tables BY HERSELF was doing good. Bartender good also"}
{"text":"Great place to grab a beer any time of the day. 50 beers on tap plus bottles of some rarer ones if there is nothing you like on tap. My go to bar. Jess, the waitresses and bartenders are very friendly and will take care of you. The food is pretty good if you need something to eat. Definitely worth a stop."}
{"text":"Originally posted a bad review. Gave them another chance to redeem their service. I've now been back dozens of times. What a complete 180!"}
{"text":"Best craft beer bar in town, great events."}
{"text":"Horrible that's all I can say. I don't even want to give them a star but I had to in order to post on this die. Have been waiting with a party of 8 for food. And it took over an hour to get our food. All the food didn't come out at once so now some of us our eating and the other people in our party still don't have their food. Waiter is never present and our drinks never got refilled."}
{"text":"Great selection of beers. The service is friendly, but slow. Great food, poor service. They go at their own slow pace."}
{"text":"It's about time I review this place, if you've read my reviews - you know how I feel about an extensive beer selection! This place is for beer connoisseurs. My favorite feature is the keg TV, yeah, I'm not sure what else to call it. They have a few flat screens throughout the bar that display what is on tap and how much they have of what's on tap left. Example: You'll see the beer name \"Moose Drool\" and next to that a little picture of a keg, if the keg is fully lit green, you're good! They have a full keg waiting for your consumption. If the keg only has a little red color at the bottom of it, you better order your next beer quickly b/c they're almost out.

The pizza/bar food is good, especially after you've had a few. They could speed up service to the tables, but if you're hanging around enjoying some beverages then you shouldn't really be in a rush anyway. They have a lot of events and growlers! You can purchase a growler and ANY beer on tap to fill it! Bring it back and refill it with whatever you want as many times as you'd like. Of course, there is a charge, but its minimal for what you're getting.

They have darts and pool tables too in case you're feeling competitive. Okay, that should convince you to give them a try!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan, for sure.  Best place in town to get rare microbrews! They have a rotating selection on draft, so there's always something new to check out.

The dudes who run the place know a lot about beer and are always happy to chat with you about particular beers, styles or breweries.  They also have festivals (Winter Ales, Strong Beer) throughout the year where folks can come in an get smaller samples of special beers. (NB: these are not your typical beer festival where an entrance fee covers unlimited tastings; you buy a small (7 oz) glass and then pay a reduced price for a 7 oz tasting of beer.)

They have a large menu that even includes a few vegan and several vegetarian options!  They also serve booze if you wanna bring a beer-hating date.

They sell (unopened) bottles of rare beers to take home to enjoy, and also growlers of draft beer.  Prices are a little on the high side, but worth it if you love craft beer.

Lots of TVs for sports fans, pool tables, and video poker too (hmmm, wonder if the play $20/drink free thing is valid for high gravity beers - if so, I'm becoming a gambler), if drinking isn't enough entertainment on its own."}
{"text":"I heard great things about this place... It was packed. But the red headed curly hair' d bartender seemed to be in a bad mood. Kinda ruined my experience.... She need to correct that because I probably won't come back because of her..."}
{"text":"This was a terrible place to eat. I placed an order to go and did not receive my fries and they messed up my main order. And the low level guy that answered the phone was a smug like he was the king of the hole in the wall restaurants. Next time I'll drive an extra 2 miles for better service.

Update
So I have to say \"Thank you\" to Adam for giving me a gift certificate for all of my troubles!"}
{"text":"Still awesome, still a great beer selection, even if they were out of what I ordered last time I went.  Friendly staff who know their stuff.
Check out the bottles as well as the taps, they have some pretty cool stuff on bottle.

As to the people I saw ordering coors light here: what the hell?

Cons: I guess TV placement could be slightly better.  Maybe?"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place out of pure need because my phone was dead after getting treatments and it was the first hope I saw about an apple charger .. I was greeted by Austin he was not only amazing but even just offered me water and to charge my phone .. after my walk I got a titos vodka  and diet and some food which he also recommended the ahi tuna which let me tell you was soooooo good with the chips omg .. if only my phone was charged before I finished it off .. I also ended up trying out the fried Oreos which are Amazing and I did snap a photo of those talk about delicious !!!!!! This place has such yummy food , awesome service by Austin and I also was helped my Kaylee (sorry if spelling is off ) and Matt .. everyone at this place on a Tuesday afternoon was super awesome and they treated me like a rock star eventho I looked like a bum from being at my infusion lol ... I plan to make it a ritual to stop on in here due to how kind they were plus.. those fried Oreos tho ????"}
{"text":"They have karaoke during the week and the food is amazing. A great combo in my mind. Seafood lovers: You have to get their ahi tuna salad. YUM. 

I come here often and have no complaints except for the last time I was there. The waitress was a little rude and forgot my drink order. She might have been having a bad day. 

Other than that, highly recommended this bar as a place to hang out with friends and grab a bite."}
{"text":"My friend Keith and I were bottling our first homemade Ale last night and we thought we should go drink some real Ale.  Where better to go than Aces and Ales!  I had heard about this bar about a year ago after watching Zane Lamprey live.  He had gone to Aces and Ales for his drinking show so I put it on my list.  When we walked in I was very worried that the bartender wouldn't give us a first, let alone, a second look.  The bar seemed to be filled with regulars and here we were, two guys in boatshoes plus a pregnant lady.  Despite my reservations, we sidled up to the bar and, like a flash, there was the bartender.  Needless to say she was probably the best bartender ever!  If we even thought about looking at the bar she was ready to take our order.  On a more important note, I'm a fan of beer and they have plenty of it.  I think we tried about 8 different Ales as well as some delicious pretzel bites.  I am definitely going back here.  Judging by the buzz I still have from last night, it was money well spent!"}
{"text":"Beside myself at the fantastic beer/food and staff!!! You would be a fool not to visit AA if your in Vegas."}
{"text":"We had lunch here, and did not partake of any oat sodas.  As everyone notes, the selection was fantastic.  I'll be sure to have a few when I return.  

When we walked in, it was very dark.  Extremely dark, to the point it was hard to read the menu.  I guess my eyesight may be getting worse as I get older....

The wife had the chili.  This was served in an interesting way, in a dish with tortilla chips.  They were good chips.  The chili had a nice crust of melted cheese on top.  Unfortunately, it didn't have much chili flavor.  It's like someone made chili without a majority of the seasonings.  I certainly liked the presentation, and it has potential, but needs some heat, or at least flavor.

I had the juicy lucy.  This was a VERY solid burger.  4 star burger.  Chorizo, American cheese, and onions cooked in between 2 large beef patties (the toppings weren't exactly inside the burger as in a traditional juicy lucy.  But, I won't complain when you give me so much flavor that the large burger can't contain it).  A very soft bun that somehow was strong enough to hold it all together.  I put a little mayo on it, but it probably wasn't needed.  An excellent burger, and one I would gladly order again.  On the side, I had fries.  They were also very good.  They had parmesan and garlic on them.  No ketchup needed...

I will say, I am not entirely schooled on the smoking laws, but the server let 2 people smoke at the bar.  The first one was not close enough to bother us, but the second one was.  Maybe smoking is completely allowed here and I missed the sign.  The wife left early due to smoke.  Maybe this was a one time thing, but it's something we will have to consider before eating here again.  I'm sure we will, how can we not return to  a place with grilled cheese and mac n cheese sections in its menu..."}
{"text":"Food was super yummy and the service was great. Mae took great care of us. Love the fried Oreos, pretzels and Mac & Cheese. Highly recommend this as your next lunch spot. I can't wait to come back and try more things off the menu."}
{"text":"Tonight happened to be Trivia Night and a few of my friends were going.  Tons of beer on tap, they frown upon you ordering Bud Light.  I wasn't really in the mood to spend a ton, so I elected to get a few Bud Lights.

My friend ordered the Chicken Strips and said they were decent.  Another friend of mine ordered the Steak Wrap and said it was okay.  So there's nothing. Special about the food judging from their reactions.

Trivia itself was fun, but took almost 3 hours to complete.  The inside ambiance is a little weird die to HUGE tables that you have to share.  It's a little awkward when your party of 4 belly's up to another random party of 4.

As for the service, it was good but something weird happened at the end.  My bill was $10 and I said I needed change for $100.  She brought back $90 with four $20's and a single $10 bill.  Hmmm, am I supposed to tip 100% of my bill?  Seems like a bizarre way to make change.

This is my second time coming here, but my first review.  I'm sticking with my guns here and rating it 3 stars.  Probably not coming back.  Thanks, but no thanks."}
{"text":"Had such a great experience at Aces & Ales with Jena! She is very attentive and a very good waitress!! And to top it off ... she is HOT!!!"}
{"text":"JJ is the best. Great service, hospitality, and a killer personality. The food beats everything in Vegas too. I've only had a few things off the menu, but I recommend boneless wings and Bleu Cheese dip all day! Again, ask for JJ if he's behind the bar. Solid guy."}
{"text":"Ordered the pizza bites which were delicoius and addicting all at the same time. Service was good. Only con was their touch tunes jukebox was offline at the time so I could not play my favorite songs."}
{"text":"Holy shit!!!this place is AMAZING!!! stumbled upon this place after shopping and heading to a late lunch and lawd I'm glad we did...I got a trout Slayer and it was yummy, idk what my gf got but she loved it...now to the food...she got the boneless wings and yummy!!!tons of white meat minimal breading and they were perfect. I got a burger with the Mac and cheese on it with the onion rings and I am now hooked!!! The service was amazing, beer was perfect and food was phenomenal!!!I can't wait until we are back and I can see this being our new place!!!"}
{"text":"I had been anxious to try this place for quite a while.  During my most recent Vegas trip, I was able to stop by here before going home.

After checking their tap list online, I saw they had Dogfish Head's Immort Ale.  Since I had never had that, or seen it available in LA, I made the effort to get there.  It's not located near most of the other areas I go during a stay on The Strip, and it does require driving (which is a never-do for me in Vegas) or a substantial cab fare.  The closest recognizable landmark that I saw was Sam's Town.

This place is huge, but it was empty when I went in the afternoon.  They have pool tables, darts, and video gambling machines.  They had classic bar food that I did not see or try.

The beer prices are reasonable.  One great thing is that the ALWAYS have Rouge Hazelnut Brown Nectar for $4.  If you go here with a girl, have her order that and she'll love it.

The bartender was more beer-knowledgeable than a typical Vegas bartender, but she was not knowledgeable enough for me.  I had to guess at some of the beer styles based on the names, and she did not know who brewed some things, or where they were brewed.

My best advice:  Check there tap list online (they have daily specials too).  If there is something that interests you that you cannot get at your favorite craft beer bar back home, go here.  Actually, if you're a craft beer fan, go here and support.  They also support homebrewers, and the local club hold their meetings there twice a month."}
{"text":"This place has really good food and great service! The bacon and chive deviled eggs are amazing! We had the Mac and cheese burger. It was good but not amazing and I'm not a fan of the fries. The deep fried Oreos are delicious but maybe a bit too much breading. I also don't like people smoking while I'm eating. I'd come back during happy hour to watch a game!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. They do pub trivia on Tuesday nights- always a good time. The staff is awesome, they have a ton of beers on tap, and they make a damn good Bloody Mary. The food is great- I recommend the House Mac n Cheese."}
{"text":"Super smoky,  not a place for food.  All the tables were tall or stand up.  Didn't stay."}
{"text":"Love it! Been there several times great prices and good beer. The environment is very relaxed and they have several pool tables. The staff is amazing!!! Vegas tends to have a lot of rude bartnders not here ive had the plasure of meeting Bobby , Melissa and Emo all were outstanding!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little bar/restaurant with cool ambience.   But the FOOD is incredible!  Definitely get the Cheese Balls & the onion rings.  This is my new place to eat in Vegas"}
{"text":"Waitress got our drink orders right but not our food orders. Never got our food and weren't charged but it's the principle. You're not busy, bar isn't busy. Take care of your customers."}
{"text":"Aces & Ales is one of the handful of places that offer craft brew and I'm excited to have a location on this side of town since the SE location makes it to where we don't go often.

I wasn't up for a beer but the BF got a Nitro tapped stout Hauling Oates which I think was superior on the tap than the bottle.  

We shared our two sandwiches. 

Jalapeno popper grilled cheese- they use fresh jalapenos and it definitely had some kick. It was crispy, but not overly greasy, right amount of cheese and jalapenos for me. I think the only thing I could say badly was for cheese, white bread and a jalapeno $10 might not be worth it. 

Turkey, avocado & bacon - this was a pretty yummy sandwich. It's not the typical turkey club bar sandwich as it came on a ciabatta and had a nice basil mayo in it. The portion was pretty generous with the meat.  

Sandwiches come with either regular fries or sweet potato so we did with one of each. Both options are solid, came crispy and well seasoned. 

It seems their service is spotty based on other reviews and this is where I was a little worried about dining here. Our gal was nice and I thought it was decent service considering she was the only one working the floor and others were the bar. We got our food and refills at acceptable intervals.

I think their bar food is above average greasy spoon fare and worth trying and their tap selection is one of the better you will find in town.  I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Came for the 2nd day of the A&A 1st Strong Beer Festival. 

So you buy the commemorative cup and get a free first cup ($15ish I think) and it was $4 after that....or just $8 for a regular goblet. The \"tasting cup\" was sizeable, about half a usual goblet. I like the idea of getting various taste and some of these are rare so I have no complaints paying the per taste than the usual- drink yourself to a coma- flat rate.

Got to try today-  Sierra Nevada Chico IPA, Samichlaus Bier, Deschutes Red Chair, Deschutes Black Butte XXI, Rogue John John Juniper, Kasteel Donker, Red Hook IPA (they were pouring for free!), Joseph James Red Fox.  I got some onion rings and they were solid bar food rings. 

The minus was that it was hot inside. It was packed in there so I'm sure the body heat doesn't help, but this place isnt really well ventilated and made for it being stuffy.

I was going to try to go to all days, but it was hard to do. Just getting here is hard....I think next time it might be worth my while to buy a growler of beer to bring home something worthwhile a trip (price depends on the rarity, but growlers are pretty reasonable- $15-$20+)."}
{"text":"Food was good & a very lengthy selection of beers & cocktails with a great set of music. Server was very friendly"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere!!! Privately owned which makes it homey and comfortable! No corporate non sense! Kimberly is an amazing bartender! She is friendly and so interactive with the guests. My friends and family enjoy coming here, because of their vast array of beers and breweries! They have fun side games when you are gambling and you can just feel like relaxed welcoming vibe as soon as you enter. 

Try the roots to boots American beer!! It is so delicious! A hef with cherry flavor so good!!!"}
{"text":"For me Aces and Ales is the best bar in Las Vegas.  There are a few things I really care about when I go to a bar and those are Beer selection, and the food.

The bar itself is very unassuming, and in a less then desirable area in the shadow of Sam's Town on the east side of Las Vegas.  Inside the bar is dark, with gaming at the bar, and seating at tables around the outside wall.  Several pool tables and a shuffle board in a separate room by the entrance. Overall the appearance of Aces and Ales is very unassuming, and on the surface docent appear to be anything special.

Aces and Ales has a rotating Tap list that is never the same twice.  This means you will always have a fresh selection of beers to choose from.  I have yet to find another place in town that has a better beer program.  They also have amazing Tap Takeovers a few times a year with different themes.  This is typically where you will find the \"whale\" beers that you will have a hard time finding else where.  Overall this is the place to go if you are looking for good beer.

Bar food is something I truly love.  Simple food like cheeseburgers, fries, and chicken wings are made so poorly at so many places around town.  Aces does all of these things right.  The Eddie Spaghetti is in my opinion the best pizza in town. They make incredible burgers, there fries are always crispy, and there chicken wings are always amazing.  I cannot say enough about the food at Aces and Ales, they have managed to elevate the run of the mill bar food to something really really amazing.

The worst thing about Aces and Ales is that you have to choose between all of the amazing beers, and food options they have."}
{"text":"The food at this restaurant is delicious! My husband and I went here on a Monday night as we stopped over in Vegas on our cross country drive. The place looks a little shady from the outside and doesn't have great ambiance, but it's worth it for the food. The waitress was friendly and tended to us quickly. I am not a fan of bars, or of smoking in restaurants so I would have preferred a different style restaurant. The food is worth it though!"}
{"text":"They have a great selection of beer. The food was much better than I expected. I was expecting the typical pub grub. We had a table of 4 and we went around 3 PM on a weekday so it wasn't that busy. We ordered some food to split. The green apple, bacon and cheddar grilled cheese and the mac and cheese were my favorite items. Our waitress was friendly. I've tried MANY of the IPAs around the West Coast and I wanted to try something new. She gave me some suggestions that were great."}
{"text":"We got a recommendation to come here from a local and it's pretty awesome!  Super laid back, really attentive waitress (She was the only one on the floor and we never felt unattended)  It looks pretty sketchy from the outside and it's not super fancy looking but the food is great, the beer selection is pretty varied and the price is great.  We had 5 beers, 2 meals and an app for $50 before tip.  Anywhere closer to the strip or back home in LA would have been at least $75 for the same meal.  I'm sure I'll be back next time I'm in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Service definitely sucks! Sat outside by fireplace. Cool and windy. We (two of us) were the only ones. Five minutes later, three people came out out and sat at a table. A server came out and they introducedorder. Never acknowledged us. Brought them their libations. Went back inside and brought out menus for them. Went back inside. Fifteen minutes - we must have been invisible. We walked out - never going back there. Too many good places with great service. Maybe that's why the place was empty. Don't waste y themselves to her. She took their drink our time!  Life is too short! If I could give a negative star, I would."}
{"text":"Best beer bar in Vegas! My man and I make a special trip here every time we're in town. The whole staff knows all the things! Come here for all of your craft beer questions. And with 50 rotating taps of the best beer from around the country, this bar can't be beat!

If beer isn't your thing, Kim makes the best Bloody Mary's! Although, Austin is giving her a little competition! Two great Bloody's in one day? Yes, please!

Don't forget the food!  Raul has a great staff and they make some killer food! Try the moondog! You won't regret it!

We love you Aces crew!"}
{"text":"Been to both this location and Nellis. Not sure if just females get ignored or if they just don't care that someone has been sitting and waiting for 20 minutes. Overall, expect absolutely terrible service. My wine's price on my receipt was higher than what's printed on the menu, and food is usually burnt or takes forever and a day to come out. I've been coming in since they opened in hopes of it getting better, and it's come to this...I'm sorry, but I come in expecting horrible service most of the time."}
{"text":"I'd give it a 4.3. Pretty good place. Staff is cool, especially James, Kim, Theresa and Rebecca. Food is good because David cooks a bomb ass breakfast. Best part is when he k owe you and sees you, he knows what you want and how you want it."}
{"text":"I sat at the bar for 15 minutes before anyone acknowledged me. Then I ordered a beer and onion rings to start, after that no one approached me for another 35 minutes. I had an empty beer glass for 35 minutes at the bar while I gambled. I was super exited to try the rest of the food but once I got to 35 minutes of waiting I couldn't wait any longer."}
{"text":"The quintessential neighborhood bar, Aces has a cool but welcoming vibe where customers can range from octogenarians to tattooed vaping hipsters.

In the past we've had trouble finding a place in the bar away from dreaded tobacco smokers (don't they watch the horror story commercials and realize you can only be so hip missing your tongue, teeth, and jaw).

This time we found a relatively smoke free corner and we throughly enjoyed our visit. The beer was outstanding - I had the midnight ritual (not a very large pour, but with a great kick and awesome complex flavor profile) and the chai milk stout which was creamy, smooth and flavorful.

We had the Bacon Bombs appetizer and were throughly impressed. The Bacon Bombs consisted of in-house cheese stuffed jalapeños, panko breaded, wrapped in bacon, and deep fried. They were just perfect, served hot and not greasy. A sumptuous combination of flavors. We were there on a busy evening so our waiter was a bit slow, but since he was covering a good portion of the bar I totally understood. He was accommodating despite being overworked."}
{"text":"We came here because it's supposed to be the best beer bar in Nevada. What a disappointment. A pretty good selection of beer, though not exceptional, and service was really mediocre. The door was locked when we got there, apparently you are supposed to know to ring the bell. There were only a few customers, but the bartender was quite inattentive, and it was hard to get her attention. The one plus was that the pizza was really, really good."}
{"text":"4 stars only cause it s hard to get the bill.  There was no one here and it still s difficult!  Great food and drinks though"}
{"text":"Great food, service and a lot of craft beer on tap..."}
{"text":"As we pulled into the parking lot of this fine establishment, my entire party in the car raised their eyebrows and even trembled a little. The building is windowless with heavy black doors with a camera and a small sign posted below directing patrons to look into the lens. Sketchy.... Just a little, until you go inside....

Inside its just another dimly lit sports bar with cute girls in short shorts that are entirely friendly and helpful as any could be. There's an impressive soda cooler in the corner boasting some lovely rare beer finds that one wouldn't expect to see at all for purchase and at decent prices too! As we sat down I was delighted to receive a huge menu of even more rare bottled beers and then a separate list for all the amazing craft brews just on draft... Around 20 of them! I was in heaven trying to choose what I wanted and even more excited to learn I could do a flight of six 4oz glasses of my choice for $16!!!! Yup.... Heaven, the beers were nice, my mother enjoyed the martini selection and we even ordered theist bites.... Mmmmm yum! I may try to get my party to return so I can purchase a jolly pumpkin bottle... But then again... I'm only n Vegas for a little while and I need to explore!"}
{"text":"the location on North Tenaya has a great set of beer selection but they do not update their beer menu to often so the beer that gets ordered might not be the one you get. The food is always good but the service was terrible. Takes along time to get drinks and the waitress forgot our food order after 45 minutes of waiting. Not impressed overall. Gave them two tries but not a third one."}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and get the parmesan garlic fries. Great appetizer with a creamy aoli, and nothing was burnt or undercooked. Then wash it down with one of the fine beers from their constantly rotating tap. 

Stephanie was super nice and helpful! Water was always full and she provided beer samples before we committed to anything strangely flavored. Only issue is that service was sporadic and slow. Food also came out at odd times, but it's a Friday night so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. 

I got the Pizza Port Pickleweed Point IPA (Alliteration: always awesome). Deliciously crisp but still hearty.

Plenty of space to sit down, good open atmosphere with a jukebox and fantastic music selection. Good for a weekend or weekday solo or with large groups of friends. Lots of TVs too to catch up on your sport of choice. Plus, super clean!"}
{"text":"As always the beers are tasty and you can count on a variety. My wife and I are IPA fans and even though there are rare occasions with few IPA's there many others too choose from.
 A few changes at the bar internally as Matt, long time bar manager, has left. We are bummed and will miss him. 
Nicole a server and part time bartender is always a welcome sight. She does an awesome job at taking care of our food and drink needs as well as Mitch.  There are a few new faces but so far so good.
This place is a regular stop for us."}
{"text":"The beer education of Misti Y could have very easily been completed tonight if I hadn't had to run off to catch an art show. I am a beer-drinker, but nowhere near the connoisseurs that frequent Aces and Ales. There was a special selection of Rogue brews on tap starting tonight, and the occasion brought out some deep beer lovers--avid home brewers, the Beer Meet-up organizer. In addition to sipping the suds on tap, they brought out special bottles to share. Passion was in the air.

Because I am just a lowly drinker, I can't say that I am the most qualified to determine the quality of the beer selection, but based on the survey of the crowd, this is the place to be. I trust them. They did mention Freakin' Frog and Yardhouse, but for straight-up quality and not quantity, they agreed Aces delivers best. I tried the Rogue Hazelnut: delicious. I also tested a Belgian ale. The name escapes me, but I wish I could have handled an entire glass! I had to drive.

When I arrive, I was starving, so I ordered some grub. I was impressed to see a veggie burger on the menu and sweet potato fries. The veggie burger was a pretty standard Morning Star-esque patty, and it came on a sesame seed bun with a nice stack of lettuce, onions, tomatoes and pickles. It was charred agreeably. The sweet potato fries were a tad salty, but I finished every morsel of sustenance on my plate. Overall, it was a solid offering for bar food. I would not be afraid to come here hungry.

As for the physical atmosphere, the bar was a large, clean and comfortable video-poker bar with pool tables. Nothing trendy or thematic, but I was impressed by the lack of overbearing smoke, and the fact that one TV station was dedicated to music videos on FuseTV.  Plus, the co-owner is the guitar player for Alice Cooper. That earns bonus atmosphere points, as does the friendly staff. 

I am torn between 4 and 5 stars. I am a sucker for bold interiors, and Aces is a straightforward bar. Still, I know that most of the people coming here see everything through beer goggles, and if designer ones are your thing, then this is 5 stars all the way. For specialty beer passion, this is as good as it gets in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I've had a couple different experiences here. Most have been with good service and good food. A couple times the crowd was a little rough, but mostly it's been good. The food has been really delicious through the week."}
{"text":"Stopped by Aces and Ales last night for a pub quiz, and had a good experience. 

I seem to recall coming out here once before, a few years ago, but that was long before my Yelping days.

We arrived around 5:15, and seated ourselves. 

Let me say this:  they have an AMAZING beer selection.  The best I've seen since The Freakin Frog closed.  They have like 6 Delirium beers on daught!  That's amazing!

I was on a tight budget last night, so no beer for me, but I will update the next time I go, because I definitely plan to go again. 

My friend and I ordered:
The Chicken Tenders with Ranch, and the Fish and Chips: 

Both were really tasty!  The chicken was not greasy, and they were big pieces, but I was a little disappointed that a $9 dish didn't even come with fries, and there were only 4 pieces of chicken.  But, on the upside, the quality was really good, so I'm not completely turned off by the price.  

The fish was awesome. Huge pieces of cod, lightly battered, and super flakey and delicious.  Really impressed with that. 

Service was a little bit slow, which was understandable during the quiz, but we were there 2 hours early, and still had quite the wait for a waitress.  Our server was very nice though, which almost made up for the wait times....the big complaint I have is that the server was super quick on refilling the beers of the rest or our party, but not the water glass I had.  We were there for 4 hours, and I only had 2 glasses of water...the second one sat empty for the last 2 hours.  

The only other issue I had, was that we were not told when  we arrived that they had happy hour specials...and since it took almost 40 minutes to order, we missed out on happy hour prices.  That bummed me out...I could have had a drink AND something to eat someone would have mentioned it.  

At any rate, the quality of the food was good, and it was a pleasant experience, even with the handful of minor things.  

I definitely plan to go back, and soon.  The incredible Delirium selection is calling my name!!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine comes here weekly for karaoke. 

I, sadly, usually have to work super early the next day, so I hadn't been able to come out...until last Monday night.  I had some vacation days in, so on Monday night, about 9:00pm, we headed over to Aces and Ales.

I'd actually been to this location about 5 years ago, and enjoyed the food.  

This time, we didn't eat, but we drank...oh did we drink.  

Their beer selection isn't as vast as the Tenaya location, but they still have GREAT beers at great prices.  

My selections for the evening: 
Crafthaus (my FAVORITE local brewery) Centerpiece Sour:  AMAZING.  I'm new to the sour beer side of things, and I just loved this.  
Delirium Tremens:  My second favorite beer of all time, I had two of these.  This beer is SO much better on draught, rather than out of the bottle, I will definitely come back here the next time I want one, instead of buying a bottle at Lee's. 

I also tasted a handful of other beers that my friends ordered, including 2 scotch ales that were delightful, and a gingerbread porter? (I was drinking, so I don't remember if it was a porter or not)  They were all tasty. 

Shall I talk about karaoke?  
Everyone who reads my reviews knows I'm a karaoke junkie and snob.  
As a former KJ myself, I'm really picky about my sound, and queue management.  

Kool Katz Karaoke did a phenomenal job.  Their sound was great!  Their selection isn't as big as some other companies, but they are willing to try to find songs for you if you write them down.   And their books are kept up to date, which is a HUGE undertaking.  Mad props!

The KJs all sang too, which is a pet peeve of mine, but there wasn't a HUGE crowd of singers that night, so it didn't bother me much.  

The regulars who go there to sing are all AMAZING, but don't fret if you're not the best singer.  They were all supportive and encouraging!  

I will most definitely come back to the bar whenever I want a good beer, and you can be sure if I have a Tuesday morning off work, I will be heading here for karaoke."}
{"text":"I'm giving this a three stars based on they no longer offer they're advertised specials and the bartender looks a little bit frustrated and irritated even though there was only about three people in the whole place , if it wasn't for the other bartender being bubbly outgoing and always smiling I would not return to this place again."}
{"text":"Fans of Beer have found the right place. 24/7 availability of craft brews with a prominent presence of Amazing on a huge draft list with options to buy bombers of rarities and profound bottled delights. Additionally the food is fresh, delicious and inexpensive and the whole menu is served 24/7. Had great experiences with the Fish and Chips and bacon cheeseburger with jalapeños. Wow. Impressed every time I come here. Great for those Vegas residents (many of us) who work this weird shifts. Nice to get a great dinner at 6am! They also hold regular craft brew release dates. Servers are friendly attentive and polite."}
{"text":"Beer = love. That being said, a microbeer bar should be paradise, right? Unfortunately Aces and Ales didn't quite deliver.

Bubs and I met friends here for some drinks and bites. We ordered the nachos and candied bacon. Both were very sub par. The nachos were beyond basic. Cheese, sour cream, and salsa. Similar to something I would make drunk at home at 3am. Candied bacon was more like sweet jerky. Tasted good, but needed to be crisper.

The beer is hard to review because they rotate taps every three days. From the 6 we tried, only one was really good. Maybe we were just here for a bad rotation?

The saving grace was the customer service and overall ambiance. Our waitress Summer was awesome, and the other staff seemed friendly as well. She was a great conversationalist and very friendly. Also the bar wasn't packed or super noisy (we went at 9pm on a Saturday). Good place to hang out with friends and actually hear each other well enough to carry on a conversation. 

We weren't crazy about the place, but we might try it again."}
{"text":"Aces and Ales is an upscale bar with an impressive list of craft brews on tap. The menu is extensive and features unique dining options (beer candied bacon, anyone?) in addition to the usual bar food (nachos and pizza). It has never smelled like cigarette smoke inside, and I only eat on the bar side of the pub. I came here with a Groupon for $15 for $30. 

BEER BITES ($6.50): I've ordered these in the past, but this time the beer bites were pretty lackluster. They were all parmesan and no garlic, all bark and no bite. The bites come with a trio of sauces: beer cheese, marinara sauce, and queso dip. They seemed to be nuked. The beer cheese didn't taste like anything at all. Probably won't order these again. 2/5    

CAJUN MAC & CHEESE ($11.50): Minus the sausage and onions of course. I always get this when I come here because it's so delicious. Again, it did not compare to previous visits. It had a powerful greasy taste to it and lacked the usual spicy kick. No bueno. I'll try something different the next time I come here. 2/5 

FISH TACOS ($13): My guy had to pull out the jalapenos because they were so spicy! He couldn't handle the heat lol. Overall, he said this dish was just okay. 3/5

THE COOKIE THING ($6): Hated it. Took one bite and said no way. The description made it sound like a wonderful chocolate chip cookie. Instead it looked and tasted like a burnt brownie. 1/5

DEEP FRIED OREOS ($6): Of course it was delicious. They're fried oreos! It's a huge portion of fatty goodness. Hmmmm. I swapped the cookie thing out for the oreos. 4.5/5   

SERVICE: It's seat yourself. Also, make sure you have at least an hour and a half to spare if you choose to dine at Aces and Ales, because service is aggravatingly slow. If you can get past the slow turn out times of the kitchen staff and the slow service received by servers, Aces and Ales is a great local bar to hang out at. 2/5 

VIBE: I love the vibe at Aces and Ales. There's a mix of young and old here. On my most recent visit, my husband and I were over the moon about the playlist. Aces and Ales was actually playing good music! Slipknot, Faith No More, and Slayer were our favorite bands that graced the playlist. Apparently the bartender was in charge of the music set, and we made sure to thank him for the great music before we left. 4/5  

Worth a Return Visit?
So this particular visit was a flop with the food, but my husband and I remain fans! Make sure you come with a Groupon (there's a $15 for $30 deal for dinner), because food can get expensive real quick. I'd recommend checking out this bar if you're big on craft beer and are looking for bar with a twist to the usual bar grub.

Having found myself quite impressed by Born And Raised with a subsequent visit to Naked City Pizza Shop showing nearly as well it was with only modest 'bar food' skepticism that I agreed to a friend's suggestion to visit Aces & Ales on North Tenaya for some Saturday Night playoff action - a game-tying goal with 7-seconds on the clock and an OT-Win for the Kings pairing with surprisingly good food and a relaxed atmosphere for a nice change of pace.  Large in size and seemingly crafted from an old barn with comfortable communal seating amidst the glow of two-dozen televisions and gentle fluorescent lights it was mere moments after entrance that we were greeted by our young waitress and although not much help on the enormous beer list her service proved competent, each of six plates and six beers brought with good pacing and wide-smiles as water glasses continually brimmed full.  Unable to speak to the beer flight but impressed by the $12 tab it was with bar-food-staple soft pretzels alongside squeaky curds that we began and with both golden bites proving plenty salty it was the sauces that served as game-changers -  the funky bleu, beer cheese, and queso all remarkable.  Moving next to things more substantial it was to a truly cheesy trio that we were next treated and although the pizza could have tolerated a few more minutes in the oven to firm up the crust I was more than impressed by the ingredient quality across the board - bright Romas and fresh basil on the pie while crisp bacon and snappy apples graced the toasty sandwich, a skillet of tender macaroni under a blend of cream, cheese, and breadcrumbs rounding out the troika.  Never one to end a good meal without something sweet it was last but not least that we rounded out the evening with a steamy skillet cookie riddled with chocolate chips and eating more as a pudding than a cookie beneath Blue Bell Vanilla as Gaborik ended the game I couldn't help but smile...they just don't do sports bars like this back in Ohio."}
{"text":"The bar food at Aces and Ales is everything you'd want from your neighborhood bar and then some. My favorite dish is the buffalo mac and cheese - you can't go wrong. They combine mozzarella cheese, blue cheese, pieces of fried chicken tenders, and hot sauce. It the perfect comfort food!

A few other honorable mentions include the following:
Bavarian  pretzels with beer cheese (A-)
Beer bites (B)
Zucchini bites (C)
Fried Oreos (A+)

If you want delicious bar food in Northwest Las Vegas, then Aces and Ales is your spot."}
{"text":"Really had a good lunch with my sister.   The service was good and the food tasty.  We had appetizers, artichoke hearts, candied bacon, cheese curds and my favorite the meatballs!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"First time stopping here since we are new Nevada residents and definitely our new go to place.. Food was amazing beer was amazing and service was amazing! Our new favorite place! If your ever around the area definitely would stop and support. Thanks Aces and Ales for the great experience we will be seeing you soon"}
{"text":"This place was so cool! Huge beer selection and great food. We went there during the day and it was definitely too dark inside for lunchtime. :p The service was really good, too. 

OK so let's talk mac and cheese. They have like 9 different kinds and they all look delicious. I got the buffalo chicken one, but modified it a bit by basically adding buffalo chicken to the \"cheese please\" which had 4 different kinds of cheeses. They were totally cool with that. I'm a woman who knows what I want when it comes to cheese. 

BEER. So many different kinds of interesting craft beers that I had never heard of. I got the \"dirty old man\" which made everyone laugh. It was super hoppy, but good. The keg was almost out and it was \"heady\" so I got this one on the house! So then I ordered the Alaskan Smoked Porter (I mean, my last name is Porter so I was born to love porters :p). Yum! I'd never had a beer that tasted so smokey, like your clothes smell after camping. 

I'll definitely be returning soon to try some of their other menu items. :)"}
{"text":"Best selection of beer in Vegas (on tap)...food is good as well as service...they are always having beer events which is very cool...If you love beer this is the place"}
{"text":"I am not a huge fan of beer, but my husband and all of his friends are, so after hearing great things about the beer selection, we headed to Aces and Ales.
1st of all, the staff....all very friendly, knowledgable and obvious work very well together. 
The food....so good. I had the Mediterranean Mac and Cheese. Artichokes, sundried tomatoes, kalmata olives and goat cheese.....I can honestly say it was in my top 3 favorite mac and cheeses of my life. The husband had a Juicy Lucy burger, a burger with bacon AND chorizo, not for a vegetarian! He finished the entire burger and the arrogant bastard onion rings. He told me he plans on eating that again.
All the appetizers were delish....and OH MY GOSH the deep fried oreos were amazing. Im pretty sure I am gonna dream about that.
The boys drank/sampled at least 20 different beers, and were ready for more, but carrying out 15 grown men from a bar would 
not be easy, so thankfully they had enough....for now.
We will be back, and that says a lot about us. We like to stay in our \"three mile zone\"... but Aces and Ales is worth the drive. 
Check out their website, it tells you about the specials, whats on tap, and upcoming events."}
{"text":"Aces & Ales is a no frills bar, with an odd lay out, 5 tables scattered throughout, a killer jukebox, a solid selection of craft and microbrews, solid bar food, and cheap drinks.

Monday nights they have a huge karaoke following. Starts at 12 AM. Karate Karaoke. You can earn you way up to a black belt. It's a great way to meet people and to people watch.

Came here for a friend's birthday and it was a great time. The place was clean, the staff was friendly and accommodating for our large group. I wish it wasn't clear on the other side of town for me because I would invite people to come play and hang out here. 

The ladies room was also clean, too, which is real struggle in Vegas outside of casinos and nightclubs. Definitely a fan of this place."}
{"text":"Great place  amazing beer selection and the food is outstanding. I highly recommend Aces & Ales if your in Vegas"}
{"text":"This is our favorite bar! Staff is extremely friendly and helpful. They have the best beers on tap and their food is nothing short of amazing!"}
{"text":"The beer selection is always pretty good, and it's a good spot to come in for a quick beer after work."}
{"text":"BEER is great here. Tons of selection so you never get bored. The service is great on some nights but on some nights it sucks. Unless you sit at the bar. Food is actually pretty good for being a bar. Also, Alicia worst server NA."}
{"text":"Best beer bar in Vegas! Great selection the only issue I had is that I d love to see more local and state beers, there was no NV beers on draft at the time I went. However when I asked why they stated the taps rotate often. The food was legit bar food. I love the bacon wrapped fresh poppers. The service was also great and the staff was very friendly"}
{"text":"This tends to always be my go to when in Vegas. Staff is friendly and the rotating drafts are a plus. Great food,  with the exception of the pizzas. I never really fancied them. Dimly lit and very lax with plenty of TV's. They've got a large bar with plenty of seating for gamers."}
{"text":"I have had the pleasure of going to this bar a couple of times now and this is my new favorite spot. First thing I like was the endless beer selection. I told the bartender what I normally like and he made excellent recommendations based on my taste. I had the pork tacos for lunch with chips and guacamole. The chips were homemade, the pork was juicy and the guac was so fresh and tasty. I also spent a fair amount of time playing the machines and the machines play back! which is a plus! I left with more than I came with each time and who can ask for anything better than that??? Overall this place is great. Upbeat, friendly and I would say open to any kind of visitor. My mom who went with me and is in from on out of town swears she will never go anywhere else lol!"}
{"text":"I am giving this place a one for two reasons....the food is mediocre and the service is terrible. The first time I ate here we sat in the dining area and waited at least 10 minutes for a server to acknowledge us even though there was no one else there. I ordered the Jalapeño Mac n Cheese and it had absolutely no flavor at all. There was zero heat from the huge slices of jalapeño on the top. They appeared to be thrown on as an after thought. I was not impressed. But we tried again last night.....still not impressed. 

This time we sat in the bar but it still took at least 10 minutes to be acknowledged. There were two servers and neither one seemed interested in taking our table. When a server did stop by she asked for our drink and food order together and seemed annoyed. This time I ordered boneless wings figuring it was a simple order. I was the last to get my food and they were cold and tossed in a sour tasting wing sauce. The menu said spicy and they were not. 

Lastly the bar allows smoking and it was thick in the air. Unpleasant when eating. They have a patio why not make the smokers sit outside. It's not like it's the Midwest and freezing."}
{"text":"Parmesan fries were cold, the onion rings were over cooked and did not taste good. Came for Geeks Who Drink Trivia night, but the host was awful. Couldn't understand him at all. He just swore a lot and thought he was being funny and trendy, but was not. Wouldn't return to Aces & Ales or for Geeks Who Deink Trivia."}
{"text":"I decided to venture of the strip looking for an ale house. I was not expecting a windowless building with dim lighting, but the beer selection is fantastic with multiple American craft beers and Belgians on tap. The staff was very friendly and food was decent. They have some beer infused dishes which fits well with the theme. Overall a good find, but don't go in expecting a casual lunch spot."}
{"text":"The beers they have on tap span a large spectrum. It is also cool how they have a TV specifically to show the lifespan of each keg. The only time my group goes to A&A is for their Tuesday night Geeks Who Drink Pub Quiz. 

Each time we come, there is a beer I haven't had before and that makes for a fun experience. Especially since I am not much help with in the random knowledge department. I'll still make my presence known with a few drinks though. 

The food is typical greasy bar food. The nachos are lackluster. The Juicy Lucy and the Rueben are rather delicious though. Most of the items that come out of the fryer has a pool of oil on the bottom of the plate. For some this is a good sign that a hangover will not be coming. 

The service staff has always been nothing but friendly. They check up rather often and give a great pep talk."}
{"text":"Great service and food, and an amazing tap list. Was able to try a number of great beers that I don't have access to back east. 

The night I stopped in, their special was unbeatable... 6 tasters in a flight and two authentic tamales which were incredible.

I will absolutely be returning next time I am in Vegas and any craft beer lover, will not be disappointed here."}
{"text":"The northwest side of town is where you want to go for craft beer in Las Vegas. You have Tenaya Creek Brewery and Big Dogs to provide you with great local beer.

Then...there is Aces and Ales on Tenaya. It's the premiere beer bar in Las Vegas.

With over 50 different rotating taps, it's hard to get bored of the selection. Aces and Ales tends to get special kegs as well that aren't available anywhere else in town from such breweries as Stone, Green Flash, and Epic.

Aces and Ales is also know for their beer themed events. Every Tuesday is TNT in which you can get a sampler of a beer inspired food along with 6 4oz tasters of beer for $20. Thursday Nights they partner with local radio jockey Jason Mahoney from Xtreme Radio 107.5 and have special drink/beer prices. Outside of those weekly events, Aces has tap take overs constantly along with Local Brewery events.

The food here is amazing pub food. The Pizzas are some of the best in town and the cooks are willing to be very creative with your pizza orders. 

All around, this is THE beer spot to stop in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"This is the premiere beer bar in Las Vegas!

Aces and Ales is located on the East Side of Las Vegas near Sam's Town. If you are not a local, it is not more than a twenty minute ride from the strip and it will give you more of an affordable/local selection on beer.

Aces and Ales has over 20 taps that constantly change throughout the year. Some of the local taps they may have on include selections from Big Dog's Brewing Company, Tenaya Creek Brewery, Joseph James Brewery, and Chicago Brewing Company. Outside of that, they tend to have fantastic selections of some of the nation's best craft breweries such as: Epic (UT), Stone (CA), Deschuttes (OR), Lagunitas (CA), New Beligum (CO) and much more!

The food selection is amazing for bar food. They have some of the best bar pizza in town and some interesting creations such as the Eddie Spaghetti Pizza or the Metallica Meat Lovers. The Mac and Cheese menu is very good as well with many different selections to choose from. Every Tuesday each week is a special event known as Tuesday Night Tastings. In this event, the chefs at Aces and Ales create an appetizer or dinner item that comes with 6 4oz tastings of beer for $20. Some of the most recent TNT offerings included a Krispy Kreme Burger, Lobster and Crab Bisque, and Baked Oysters.

Aces and Ales also has some very big beer events! Every first Friday of the month is SNAFU---Southern Nevada Ales and Fermenters Union. This is a homebrew club that meets at Aces and Ales and partakes in sharing their brews and stories with each other. Every Sunday is Black Market Crash where all beers are $4 and there are half-price Growler fills. Aces is also known for its festivals including Stone Domination Tap Takeover Weekend, Strong Beer Fest, and Winter Beer Fest. On many occasions as well they will have brewery take overs (most recently as of 3/19/2013 by Epic Brewing Company and one by New Belgium) 

The ladies and men that work here are some of the most friendliest staff you will find in Las Vegas. They will gladly talk beer with you and as well give you recommendations based off your own personal preferences. 


Over 20 taps always pouring great beers! Outside that, the staff is super friendly! Bar food is killer....go for the Belgian Frites or fried cheese curds. This is by far the best beer bar in town. They have multiple events each year like Winterfest or Strong Beerfest that make for a good all around time"}
{"text":"Went around 1 in the afternoon so needless to say it was pretty empty despite the few old, lonely, and sad alcoholics. The bartender was nice and let me try a bunch of samples. The place is kinda dark but you can tell it goes off at night.

They have a pretty awesome bottle selection if you want to take any home. I found a bottle of dogfish head that I had never tried called My Antonia. If you are from California you may be happy to hear to you can bring in ANY grower and they will fill it up for half price during certain days so call ahead and find out when they are."}
{"text":"Why can't you be located closer to my home??
What an awesome locals bar with the beer lineup that belongs in the shmanciest casino on the strip. 
Stopped in for their First Annual Winter Fest, the Superbowl playoffs were also in full swing. Even though the bar was packed, the bartender made sure we didn't wait long to give them our order. The staff was helpful, friendly and efficient.
The place wasn't too loud, so we were able to hold a conversation. The atmosphere was comfortable. Lots of TV's to watch.
We got a plate of their Arrogant Bastard chili cheddar cheese fries ($6.75). Perfect size to share while snacking with your drinks. They were bar food fantastic...crispy seasoned fries smothered with tomatoey chili and gooey cheddar. The plate was clean in no time.
We had a great time. We will definitely go back and hang out, try more beer and food. Maybe convince them to open another location on my side of town."}
{"text":"lots of beer on tap, but smells like an ashtray.  If i were a smoker, it wouldn't bother me as much.  But as a non-smoker, the smell of smoke is just overpowering."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch one day and I must say it was amazing!  It is your typical bar food (fried everything) but the food was great!  We had the mergerita pizza and onion rings!  I had my first ever moscow mule here and now I'm hooked!  Seems like one of the few places that even carries ginger beer to make it so make sure you give it a try!  I'll defintely be back for more!"}
{"text":"Ordered on uber the food was great but the portion sizes are so small... They didn't even fill the soup containers half way. The soup also had to be nuked as it came colder then the heart of a woman who hates you. The sweet potatoe fries came so mushy and soft you'd swear someone steamed them. I'd eat here again still but look for something else next time perhaps."}
{"text":"Came for a late night dinner (12:30am) Friday night waited around 30 minutes for a cold stale pretzel that my girlfriend sent back. Had the lucifer burger which was half decent but the cold parmesan fries with chucks of rosemary that I paid 3 extra dollars for ruined it.
Also I still paid for my drink even when I was gambling. A burger fries and a beer cost me $30 still. You're better off going to Steiners on buffalo down the street better service and way better food. 
The cook needs to learn timing on his food so everything comes out nice and hot  and the bartender needs to be more observant  on what she is serving to her customers."}
{"text":"I want to like this place cause I like the atmosphere and its close to home but you guys seriously charge $9 for this teeny tiny porter?? LOL. Naaahh. Bartenders are nice, though some are a bit slow even when the bar is nearly empty. Ah well, onto the next."}
{"text":"I live in the area been there once before. Wanted some to go food and a couple beers. Went in there around 12am it was pretty much empty other than a couple at the bar and group of guys at a table. Sat down at the bar put a $20 into the machine played that no one came by to greet me or give me a menu. Played a little more still no one came by. No beer. No menu. No hello. I'm consider myself a patient person but after 10 mins I just walked out. Pretty ridiculous for having 2 guys and a girl behind the bar at once. All good tho I won't be back .. There's lots of other bars in the area."}
{"text":"I love this place! Great to go hang out and chill with friends. Great food, friendly staff, and rotating beer draft menu. Best of all is the prices. The added bonus is watching the bartender's interaction with the regulars. Spent a good hour or two just amused by her."}
{"text":"I was here on Halloween night. I liked that they were playing Halloween shows on their tvs while i was there. As a lover of thick dark beers i enjoyed their #49 chocolate oatmeal beer. My favorite was their #37 cream ale with vanilla. So good i had 2 instead of trying a third beer."}
{"text":"We've ordered from them via GrubHub many times. 99.8% of the time the food arrives hot, fabulous and just what was advertised. We even get the fried Oreos with ice cream, and the ice cream is frozen while the deep fried cookies are still hot. Just DELICIOUS!!  In the spirit of fairness, once or twice the food was subpar, but as soon as we let GrubHub know about the problems, we got an immediate phone call from the manager at the restaurant & offers to remake it \"right\" as well as provide a refund. Service plus great pub eats? Oh yes, they've earned our permanent business!"}
{"text":"I hate to leave a bad review! But I just have to share my experience...first, make sure to ask how much you'll pay before anything you order. If they ask you which side dish you'd like with the food, it's NOT because it comes with the food, it's extra! But they don't tell you. Same for the sauce (ranch!). You'll find out only in your bill. They have a huge beer selection but not even one Hefeweizen (the one they had was over), onion rings felt like I ate oil, I ordered fish and chips and it's basically 2 tiny pieces of fish (too oily). When I walked in I loved the way the place looked but I left very disappointed :("}
{"text":"My new favorite bar in the Summerlin area. The entire staff is super friendly. Adonna, Jaime, Colleen, Misty and Adam make it such a great environment to just relax and take a break from life. The machines are paying really good. Lots of money to be made. The food is some of the best bar food I've ever had, and I've had a lot of bar food. Can't go wrong with the French Dip, Burger or Mac n Cheese. They are all amazing, but that's all I've tried so far. They make the best Jack and Coke in town. 
It's almost football season, this will be the new best place to watch football. They have a million TVs, so chances are the game you want will be on."}
{"text":"Food is sooooooo good... service could be better. Recommend the Mac and cheese and the Caesar salad! Super good happy hour deals too"}
{"text":"Candied Bacon and Craft Beer! How can you go wrong?"}
{"text":"Heather was spot on with all recommendations - including the Ahi Tuna Salad, cheese balls and MY LORD the onion rings. 

Excellent beer selection, attentive service, and delicious food. Definitely give this place a try!"}
{"text":"A heaven for beer geeks!  Fantastic craft beer on tap, a great crew of people behind the bar, and fair prices!  I only wish this were closer to my home!"}
{"text":"Wow! I can't believe this place is just a couple of miles from my place.  But, that can be a curse as well.  I got a call from my roommate to come and pick him up because he walked to the bar and was too drunk to walk home.  And, the area isn't the best place to walk / stumble around drunk.

I walked in to find my buddy sitting at the bar talking to whoever will listen.  I pulled up a stool and grabbed a diet soda and shot the breeze for a bit.  I'll be back I'm sure to have drinks.  Maybe for the upcoming Yelp event.  We'll see!  

This place is a lot bigger than I thought it was going to be.  And, they have a lot of beers to choose from."}
{"text":"My 2nd visit here, and I'll have to say this time was better tonight....maybe I was more open minded?  I enjoyed that it wasn't crazy packed and didn't stink of cigarette smoke, unlike many other bars in Vegas!  Lots of TV's to watch, and a HUGE menu with the first 6 pages being the alcohol options (try balls to the wall if you like cinnamon apples)...I had a grilled cheese specialty, their apple cheddar bacon with sweet potato fries...I was very pleased with the meal, and the service was excellent!! The atmosphere is decent, I'll return...they have a decent selection of beer choices out of the norm, and I felt like I was back in the PacNW!!"}
{"text":"I'm so upset I didn't like the food because the beverage menu is awesome. We had to stay a couple nights at Mountainview hospital and we're super excited to be able to eat real food.  So we found aces and ales by yelp and ordered food to go . I got reg. Wings and hubby Got a bacon cheeseburger, pretty basic.  The wing order was just wrong got boneless instead of bone in.  The ranch was watered down . Really gross and the burger was overcooked.  It's too bad I really wanted to come check it out when we could, I may just for all the beers on tap but I certainly won't be expecting much for the food."}
{"text":"Came a few times on lunch break- you can call it in and it will be ready when you arrive! Great service, also there frequently on groupon! You have to have the salt and vinegar chips!"}
{"text":"Vegas Baby!!! One of our favorite destinations to visit for both work and for pleasure. It has become a yearly April tradition - driving up for the broadcast convention, walking the convention during the day, and then, hittin the town at night. But every year - there's always the same dilemma. Once we're on the town, where do we go for good craft beer?

I wouldn't say we are beer snobs because we don't make other people feel bad about their lack of beer knowledge. We just enjoy good craft beer. Okay, rather, good craft beer is a necessity in any place we decide to dine or chill.

We made our decision. Our first stop would be Aces & Ales. We decided to fly to Vegas this time around so we were a little concerned about the cab fare. We were staying at PH Towers on the strip, and the cab ride wasn't bad. It was well worth traveling off of the strip. Our previous experiences in Vegas had taken us to Triple 7 Brewery (mediocre at best, although cheap) and then Burger Bar (super nice servers, okay selection) and a little pricey. Aces & Ales seemed right up our alley. It ended up being the best decision we made.

We cabbed at about midnight and the driver pulled in to the empty lot. You can't miss it - there's a huge, TALL sign that says Aces & Ales. We walked in and the bar was pretty much empty except for a few locals. We expected it to be quiet though since it was a Monday night and it was off of the strip. We were instantly greeted with open arms (I was wearing my Bear Republic shirt, my fiance his Russian River). The super friendly barman Eric instantly chatted us up - and the beer talk began. He showed us the menu - and it was awesome! Not only do they have an insane amount of bottles to choose from, they have an amazing selection of beers on tap - very unique - things we have never experienced before. As soon as I saw Dogfish Head Red and White and my fiance saw Dogfish Head Burton Baton on tap - we knew we were in for a long night. We never thought we'd actually experience good craft beer in Vegas!

Then, we met Ryan, one of the owners of the bar, and he was soo nice! It was like we had known him for years - and we talked for hours. And when I say hours I mean HOURS! Before we knew it - it was 4AM!!! That was the coolest part for us! Amazing craft beer available 24 hours a day! I am soo spoiled by our visit. Needless to say we left VERY happy, and with a few good to go bottles under our belts.

We were told that Keri, the other owner of the bar would be there on Wednesday, so on our way home, we made a farewell stop to Aces & Ales. He was beyond nice - and it was just soo great having conversation with people that actually know good craft beer! Every staff member we met was super super nice also. We only wished we had a few more hours in Vegas (they were having a Deschutes Jubelale tapping that night). But that's just an example of what types of beer the get in (and they were nice enough to have a sample of it before we left :)

The atmosphere is soo cool - pool tables - poker machines at the bar, and Flat Screens which would be great for Sunday football. Just enough of Vegas to make it Vegas without the inflated prices and snobby people. Prices are inexpensive. No $8 Coronas here like they are on the strip. They also have a happy hour from Midnight through the morning.

We've since been back numerous times, and were fortunate enough to go back for their Stone Brewery Event, where they even got CEO/co-founder Greg Koch to fly in.  It was an unbelievable experience - getting to try rare collaborations before anyone else!  We also ate there a few times - and couldn't believe the quality of the food - especially for a bar!  The onion rings and sweet potato fries are to die for!  

I can't say enough about how great our experience was. If you are ever in Vegas - make you sure you stop by!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came for the Strong Beer Festival and hang out with some yelpers before going to a Rush concert at MGM.  I was very impressed with the selection of beer, as I love microbrewery beer (sorry still can't get used to calling it \"craft beer\").

We stuck mostly with some of the Dogfish Head beers, including Midas Touch (my favorite saffron beer that I've had at Todd's Unique), Red and White (has a little Pinot Noir juice in it), and Black and Blue (blackberries and blueberries).  I loved the black and blue the most out of all of them.

It was fun hanging out and meeting Misti, Jacob, Jen, and Jade.  The food looked really good too (Misti and Jen ordered sweet potato fries), but I had eaten at the M resort buffet earlier in the day and I was too full to eat anything.

I would definitely come here more if I lived close to here.  I also think the prices are a little hefty.  For now, when I want my beer fix I go to PT gold or 32 degree bar at M resort for some hefeweizen."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood pub. Clean, well layed out, seating for families on one side, while the other side is dark & comfy. Can usually score a groupon to help with the price. One of the best craft beer selections in town. Food's tasty, delicious mac & cheese's, grilled cheese's, excellent pizza's. Service can be hit or miss, which knocks a star off."}
{"text":"This place is great! Went today with my mom and did the beer sample thing. The waiter was very very knowledgeable and we both found one we liked. We also had chicken wings and nachos which were very good. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"I love coming to Aces & Ales, although I don't venture there as often anymore. Even though there are 50 beers advertised on draft, they are usually out of about 10 of them at any given time. They also have many which are of the same kind (5 Imperial Stouts, maybe 10 IPA's). I'd like to see more variety, especially with wild ales and sours. Their food menu has been limited since they've been open, and there's no longer breakfast all day. Their breakfast wrap is my favorite item on the menu and it's good amy time of day to me. But with beers that change all the time on tap, I'm always coming back to them. And their service staff is some of the best in town and they remember you. Outdoor patio is awesome with a fire pit and plenty of seating. Great place for watching any kind of sports. I definitely recommend checking them out at least a few times!"}
{"text":"Was there last night about midnight. Signs all around the joint advertising $4 draft and half off mac and cheese SWEET ! Oh I'm sorry you can't get that special cause it doesn't start till Nov.1st. Well you are advertising so whats the problem. Nothing says starts on the 1st so whats the problem. Now the supposed Manager comes over says Sorry I'm putting these out now cause I won't be here tomorrow I have to take my kids out. BULLSHIT  Don't advertise if your not going to promote"}
{"text":"Expectations exceeded again? How is that possible? First and foremost, it's because Kim is tending bar. And in a close second, it's Sinners Sunday, which translates to All Day Happy Hour. Great beer, amazing food and 5-star service, ridiculous prices! Yes, yes, yes and Yes!"}
{"text":"Writing this as I'm about to head out the door to go have the Juicy Lucifer at Ace's!!  If you're into great craft brews and excellent food, then you should def hit this place!!
The juicy lucifer is a stuffed burger, filled with chorizo, cheese, and jalapeno's!!  And it's OUTSTANDING!!  Choice of fries is sweet potato or regular, both are tasty, and for a little more dough you can get the parmesan fries which are well worth the money!!  I also recommend the cheese curds,,, probably not the most healthy of options, but hey, you only live once!!
As for beers, the draft list is 50 deep and constantly rotates through different beers.  And these aren't your daddy's beers, no milbudcoors headache domestic drafts, we're talking beers like Speakeasy Black Lager, DogfishHead Choc Lobster Brew,  Big Bad Baptist's, Delirium Red!!  
The staff is great, and most seem knowledgeable on the taps available.  And if you'd like to, you can even sample most of the 50 on the ever changing list!  
A great place for bar food, an even better place for beer!!"}
{"text":"I give A&A an A-OK rating mainly due to their selection of beers.  I most recently enjoyed their flight of six 4oz beers for $16.  My favorite of the flight was the Anderson Valley Wild Turkey Bourbon Barrel Stout.  I  have found the service to be hit or miss on my visits and they need to do something about the bathrooms that reek as you walk in. The only other thing to get around is all the communal seating which is fine for Oktoberfest or any other beer fest but not everyday drinking.  Ultimately, weird bar/restaurant layout and service model but the beer wins in the end."}
{"text":"No need for a long review ...a must stop for any beer lover that has not previously been here...nuff said."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I'm not a fan of smoke but thats a personal preference, that didn't take away from the service and food. Other items I want to try on next visit!"}
{"text":"The food and brew selection was really great. The staff was personable and kind. The only issue was the wait time on the food and beverages."}
{"text":"Love this bar! Very chill atmosphere. Beers & food are phenomenal!

Love the pretzel, grilled cheese with beer cheese soup & the crispy fresh made potato chips!"}
{"text":"The service here was on point the last time we had a group outing. We had a private group of about 25-30 people this time, and it  appeared our one waitress was struggling to keep up with our drink requests. I'm not sure if it was her fault entirely, or if the bar was that busy, but it seemed our drinks were taking at least 15 minutes from the time we ordered them. Lucky for us the food was already setup when we first arrived.

     The food here is your typical bar & grill kinda food. Pizza, chicken tenders, wings, burgers and sandwiches. For our party we had pizza's (spaghetti pizza was a hit amongst our guests), firecracker buffalo wings (pretty spicy), Arrogant Bastard Ale cheese balls (good bar snack), & meatballs (had the most left overs).

    As far as drinks are concerned, they had a plethora of choices to pick from. I was like a kid in a candy store. I really enjoyed #5, #19 & #28. The number designation is how you order beer around here. If you don't, the waitress will look at you with a clueless face, and ask for the number on the menu anyway. 

    This is a great place to come with your friends, relax and enjoy beers with sports. There is no shortage of T.V.'s or drinks here."}
{"text":"Was hoping that this local watering hole would up the ante on food at a sports bar but this is not the case. Ordered the margarita pizza. Not recommended. Sloppily made with some slices of tomato that were way too thick. Chunks of garlic poorly distributed across the face of the pie. Waited quite a long time for it and it was a disappointment. Lots of screens to watch sports. Might give it one more try with other menu items but that was a bad introduction."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! The food is fantastic!!
There is a sign that says no one under 21 allowed but you can bring Kids to the the restaurant side, which to the right after you enter the business. 

Customer service here is some of the best I've had around Las Vegas. The food whoa, we tried a variety of things. Everything sounded good and all the food we ordered was delicious!!

Beer, beer and more beer to choose from!! They have some beer there they brew and other beer that is imported in!! 

The facility is comfortable and decorated accordingly to an upscale restaurant bar.  We enjoyed every moment of being there.

Bathrooms are on the dirtier side though.  They are nice big bathrooms just the floors are really dirty. A little bathroom cleaning will improve visits !!"}
{"text":"Came in as our first stop on a bar crawl. The house Mac and cheese was so good! There were very few patrons at the time and yet the bartender had a rough time getting our bills out to us even though we told her not to leave it open. That was highly annoying. I would go back but not when I'm on a timeline."}
{"text":"Worst service EVER. Had a party of 20 people for a birthday and waited an hour between drinks. Blunt, rude and disrespectful."}
{"text":"Checked this place out because we couldn't decide what to have for dinner. Service was great and the food was good. We did go on a night that they had karaoke, which I wasn't expecting. But all in all I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I FINALLY made it to A&A Tenaya! 

I seriously wish I could make a copy of this location and replace the original A&A.  It's awesome! First of all, it's a large space.  There is plenty of seating, and a large patio as well.

There isn't much I can say that hasn't already been said. Mainly, to compare it to the original - this location has many more taps, a patio and quite a bit more seating (plus the patio). Those all equal a great time!

The servers are friendly and knowledgeable and will provide recommendations if you need help deciding.  Just as with the other location, the food is pretty damn good.  My only complaint was that our cheese curds tasted like lettuce, since they were served on a bed of greens. Both of us commented that it kind of ruined the flavor of the cheese balls.

Anyhow, I am glad I finally made it out here, it was certainly worth the trip! This is basically beer lovers heaven in North Vegas!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical on the way to the Winter Beer Fest.  There is just a serious lack of great places to drink craft beer in Vegas.  I don't want to pay the outrageous prices at Yard House...plus, they may have ALOT of beers, but none of them are really that out of the ordinary or unique (IMO).  My skepticism continued when I entered the bar, it looks just like any other bar in Vegas - dimly lit with a large bar, filled with smokers and video poker machines.  The beer list is definitely what sets them apart.  They had a great selection, which included one of my favorite beers, which is just now becoming available in the area.  The waitress was friendly, and when there was an issue with our tab at the end, she fixed it quickly with no arguments.  My Mom and I shard the Wisconsin fried cheese curds and an order of the garlic parmesan fries.  Both were really good, but the fries were really amazing.  The garlic aioli dipping sauce was SO delicious.  I would love to try other things on the menu.

I was hoping to meet other beer lovers while there, but unfortunately it seemed as if everyone was in small groups and were not too friendly (obviously not the bars fault).  So I didn't make any new friends thi time around, but I will definitely be back for a visit soon."}
{"text":"This place was great! There's a male bartender with long hair who was AWESOME. The prices are a little higher than I'm used to (I usually go to super cheap divey bars) but it's so worth it. I ordered jalapeño poppers and a pulled pork sandwich and could've died happy right then and there. The atmosphere is awesome and it's a great place to watch sports."}
{"text":"This place has an insanely good tap list and really great servers. I was impressed with their knowledge of the beers and how well they paired food options to what we were drinking. Bar staff was awesome, 25 cent video blackjack is great and we loved every minute of it."}
{"text":"Ate here on Sat, Dec. 21st at around 6pm.  Had a Groupon.  There was not a hostess.  We waited about 10 minutes and then seated our self.  It was just my wife and I.  Tables are huge, easily seating 8 or more people.  We then sat for about 15 minutes until someone came to check on us. Waitress then took our drink order and we got our drinks about 5 minutes later.   She then did not return for another 10 minutes or so.  Finally place our order.  We ordered an appetizer and two entrees.  Got our appetizer about 15 minutes after we ordered it.  The entrees it not come out till at least 30 minutes after ordering.   So we basically got our food after an hour of waiting....:(  and it was not really that busy.   Food was ok, but fries were EXTRA crispy.  Probably will not be back.    Timbers has better food and MUCH better service."}
{"text":"Great selection of brews... friendly staff and pretty great food.. Portions a little small on some things but the 5 cheese Mac n Cheese was a hit with my hubby! They have many bottled brews to purchase for takeout as well."}
{"text":"We used a Groupon (without this discount, it would be pretty expensive). I had the 'Its Too Good' burger and my wife had the avocado melt. My burger was good, except for the bitter and under-seasoned \"spicy\" coleslaw on it. The fries were good, and our waitress was nice. The cigarette smoke in the air ruined our meal and set off my asthma."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place on Yelp while looking for good beer bars in Vegas.  This is quite a ride from the strip.  We made a visit while we had a rental car and it was still a haul.  

We originally came with the intention of eating while we were here, but this place is definitely more bar than it is eatery.  They were having some sort of Hawaiian \ Maui Brewing promo.  The whole place was decked out like a Tiki bar and there was some sort of buffet food available for no extra cost.  

Seemed like a large crowd of locals, but the bartender was very welcoming.  She went over the tap list with us (which was pretty extensive for Vegas) and then she offered up the specials which were a coconut porter or a pineapple hefeweizen.  We went with the latter and although it was $5 \ can she gave us 3 cans for $10.  It wasn't half bad.  Pretty tasty.  

We were looking for some good grub so we passed on the buffet and ended up going elsewhere for dinner.  Would go back if I was looking to get my drink on while in Vegas."}
{"text":"Every time I go to Aces & Ales the staff is super friendly and the food is delicious!  They have the best  Mac & Cheese , grilled cheese, and sandwiches. Let's not mention the variety of craft beers they have. This place might not look like much on the outside, but inside you will be happily surprised!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service,  and with 50 different beers on tap it's a win win all the way around."}
{"text":"I was actually looking forward to coming here because I love the idea of a neighborhood bar that serves good food.  Reading the menu you would think that the food was pretty great.  Very creative and interesting enough to want to take a look.

The service was quick.  We didn't sit at the bar but the bartender came over right away to get our drink orders.  Obviously if you like beer, you should come here as they have many many kinds.

The food was just ok.  We ordered the salt and vinegar crisps but they were neither salty, vinegary or crispy.  I can absolutely tell that they cut the potatoes themselves but in this, the chips were soggy and unappealing.  There was a bottle of vinegar to spray the chips but it was pretty ineffective.  I don't want to work this hard for chips.  I got a salad and it was ok.  A salad is a salad.

I'm not saying I wouldn't come back but I am also not jumping at the chance."}
{"text":"Dropped in here for a bite to eat. It's a good sized bar with tons of beers on tap. One of the best beer menus in town, offering lots of variety. 

I ordered the Alaskan White wheat ale, a bowl of beer cheese soup, and a steak sandwich marinated in beer. Maybe I went a little beer nuts with all the beer orders but each was very tasty and good. 

Service was decent, only mix up was bringing wrong plates of food to our party. We almost got someone else's beer and food as well. 

I'd come back as it looks like the menu has improved since my first visit here just after they opened. I do miss the Capt. Crunch French Toast that is no longer on the menu."}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! Good atmosphere, great food, good brews, and great service! Heather is a great server and was totally on top of her game! Love the burgers and the Mac and cheese"}
{"text":"The greatest food.  We absolutely love it.  Everyone is fantastic.  Truly a hidden spot but is a real gem of a find."}
{"text":"This place is \"hopp\"ing!!! 
Where Beer lovers come to unite. 

Good music, good food, good service, and a HUGE beer selection. We come here frequently for the unique beer specials. There is a TV screen with what's on tap and you can even check in on the untapped app. 
I've tried multiple items on the menu and haven't had a bad experience yet, so come hungry."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but it seems to be struggling these days. The food is not the same, service is very hit and miss. They are often out of menu items. The servers and bartenders are usually very sweet but there also seems to be quite a bit of turnover lately. I also wished they regularly offered a couple of cider selections. There haven't been any on their menu the last 3 or 4 times I've gone.  Something just isn't working very well at this place anymore. :("}
{"text":"Was staying at the hotel across the street and decided to stop by with a friend.   The place was hoping on a Thursday night.   That's a good sign.   The bartender was quick and friendly.   The beer selection was very good.   We tried a few things we had not seen before and enjoyed a nice evening.   I can't comment on the food as we didn't order any.  But hey, beer is food.  
Nice selection folks."}
{"text":"When I walked in I was hoping for a little more restaurant feel and less bar feel. The interior was very \"typical\" vegas gaming bar. The menu has a variety of options which is always cool. A lot of it was different, but sounded good. 

Our server suggested the spaghetti pizza which neither of us would have tried normally but since we were starving we said \"what the hell\"

That pizza is freaking delicious. Who the hell knew. Seriously, try that pizza.

As far as the beer menu I was again a little disappointed. Although I always appreciate a bar that offers an extensive and unique menu, all of the beers on tap were on the hoppy side or fruity side. Not my thing. I would have loved to have seen a few great red ales, brown ales, porters or lagers. None of which were options. 
The server did manage to find one she thought I'd like which was the Stone Sublimely Self-Righteous Dark Ale with a hint of espresso and nuttiness. Still though I wasn't in the mood for added flavors (chocolate, coffee, berries, etc.)

The \"Beer\" descriptions in the menu were poorly written and some had no tasting notes at all. For instance the Saison. I suggest they go over that part of the menu asap. 

Those minor complaints aside, the service was great, the pizza was amazing and the beer I did end up ordering was nice."}
{"text":"You guys seriously suck......tried to come In and enjoy ourselves. ..I guess you have no value for drinkers and people that order  food.

Guess if you don't play the machines they want you out. 

Never be back. ...hope you don't go either. ..no matter what dave and mahoney says"}
{"text":"This has quickly become our favorite Raider Bar. Our server Jena was awesome and made sure we were taken care of. She made great beer suggestions and the food was great. Will be back for sure and for every USC and Raider away games."}
{"text":"Moderately clean & comfortable. Food was okay. Lucifer burger & fried Oreos were okay. The sweet Potatoe & garlic fries are delicious. Mac & cheese isn't creamy orange stuff, but stringy cheese goodness & kinda bland. Prices were average. Happy hour, snack & beer for $10. Wide selection of craft beers on tap. Service is slow but there was only one bartender and there was a lot of people. Some guy came in trying to bum food off of us and talked about having the munchies after smoking."}
{"text":"I will never come here again. The morning bartender is racist. When I read other reviews this wasn't the first time this was said."}
{"text":"I frequent vegas 3 times a year on average and have never had a great beer until I came here. generally crap beer flows freely around vegas but this place steps up the game. unbelievable beer selection, by far the best I have seen in vegas. great taps and rare bottle selection. live music and pool too. what else is there? do yourself a favor and go"}
{"text":"Just stopped in because they're across the street from my hotel. Really nice atmosphere and super friendly staff. The food was good, too. I had the pulled pork tacos, really tasty!"}
{"text":"It's all about the beer, here.
My first visit here involved a discount via Groupon. I decided to try the NY steak and eggs meal. The steak was very good but did have quite a bit of fat. The eggs were fine. I also got a growler (empty) to hopefully come back and have filled. 
I sat at the bar, and although all the beer was tempting, I stuck with coffee. They even made it fresh and it was better than I expected from a poker bar. They have one of my fave video poker games, Power Aces, and I was a winner at that with very little effort. That paid for the Groupon many times over. They have many beer events such as Stone Brewing tap takeovers, a Strong Beer Festival and the like. Great selection of beers and the menu is quite extensive also. The patio looked nice and although this isn't my neighborhood, I was impressed enough to consider returning."}
{"text":"This place is great! I forgot to Yelp it last night when we were there.

Anytime we're on the east side of town and want to get a beer, we get it here. We live on the west side of the valley so we take any opportunity we have to visit Aces and Ales on Nellis and Twain. The have lots of craft beers on tap as well as the regular stuff, full bar, kitchen and gaming. They've also got a shuffle board and a couple of pool tables. The bartenders are great, especially Sumi (I hope that's how you spell her name!) We went there about four months ago with some friends and she remembered us! Last night she greeted us once we stepped in. She also remembered our friends and where we were coming from that night as well as what we had for dinner!
We heard rumors of an Aces and Ales possibly opening up closer to us westies???
Take a look at the rest of the reviews for A&A. A lot of people make the trek out to this place--that says a lot. Let me mention again that it's at Nellis and Twain. It's not the best of neighborhoods but we've never had a problem with that."}
{"text":"What an amazing beer bar! My wife and I have been wanting to try Aces and Ales for years, but never actually rented a car or took an Uber to do so. What a mistake! 

Let me get this out of the way... The only reason why I can't give Aces and Ales a 5 star review is that the service was very slow and the waitress wasn't that knowledgeable about beer. When the places has 8 + IPAs, it would help if she could distinguish between each brew. 

Food wise, we ordered the pretzel and Buffalo chicken Mac and cheese. Both were good, typical pub food, but nothing to write home about. I would recommend just getting something quick before coming here, save the cash! 

Just come here for the beer. The tap list is that good."}
{"text":"LOVE. THIS. BAR.  Once you've been there a couple times, the bartenders get to know you and remember your name, they always have a GREAT selection of craft beer on tap, and the atmosphere is great for having a night out with friends.  Misty, Jenny, and Kim all do a fantastic job tending to customers, even during the busy times like the annual Winter Beer Festival.  The food is amazing, get the cheese curds!!  Also, try any of the grilled cheese plates, they're a great deal at $8 and come with fries!  Delicious.  No other bar can compare when it comes to craft beer on tap!"}
{"text":"I've had a party in the back room and I come here every Tuesday for pub trivia. The food has really gone downhill over time. The party we had was catered wonderfully, however every week there are new servers that are clueless, overwhelmed, and forget everything you order. Courtney was probably the best server we've had, but we come in one night to see her and unfortunately find out she was let go. Shame because she was awesome. Last week we ordered ahi tuna salad and a French dip and my bf and I were so sick all night. As we haven't been sick before, we decided to try again...Tonight I ordered nachos with extra cheese. The nachos came with a sprinkle of UNMELTED cheese. I ordered extra sour cream as there was barely anything on the tortilla chips and the server never came back with it. One person in our group ordered tacos, never came. Beer selection is good, food is awful, and service is worse.

EDIT: the tacos and sour cream finally came...40 minutes later."}
{"text":"Don't just stand there like an idiot, if there are no hostess or anyone to greet you when you walk in, just claim a seat at the bar or stake a claim to any table and make yourself at home.  Just don't get too carried away and take off your smelly shoes or walking around in your undies.  Exceptions will however be granted on a case by case basis, but don't even bother unless you can make playing rock, paper, scissor look sexy similar to what the MMA ring girls can do just by breathing.

So you think you are into craft beers?  Then buddy, this might be the place for you to hit up. They have 30+ selections on the craft beer list and is updated frequently.  Just keep in mind that their inventory does not seem to be very deep, therefore your first couple of selections may be unavailable.

I don't drink, but there are occasions when I feel like watch the latest game and getting something to eat at bars like Aces & Ales.  Lucky for me, their burgers and salads are above average in the bar food category.

If you want good service, then sit your ass at the bar.  The tables along the wall and on the other side of the bar are for larger parties, but service level is not so great (which was mentioned in several previous reviews).

So on this particular occasion I ordered myself the Arrogant Bastard Steak Salad.  It was an entrée sized salad with nicely cooked steak sliced up served on top of mixed greens.  If you are not in the mode for an above average burger from a bar, consider ordering this.  You will probably send me a message thanking me later.

A friend of mine was being adventurous or maybe just looking to find a decent Chicken and Waffle spot in Las Vegas, so that was what he ordered.  I tried some of it, but we both agreed that it was no bueno.  Mucho disappointed, my friend was, as he was wishing he had gone the route of an entrée salad.  Well, that was the tiny voice of experience that I did not ignored this time.

We also split an order of Fried Cheese Curds, with the dipping sauces it was a decent appetizer.  I am sure it will not be hard to finish this as you engross yourself in the games shown on TV or the video poker at the bar while snacking.

Anyway, great spot for craft beer lovers and a hidden gem for above average bar foods.

{"text":"Food and Beer was good but service was awful. Granted they were having a private party but the restaurant was empty.  Took 30 minutes to get a sandwich from the kitchen"}

My dude got me into this place after getting me into craft beer (I was a willing recruit for that, though I give him all the credit). It's a bit out of the way for me, living in Henderson, but I still manage to get over there quite a bit. I mean, holy crap, they've got taps for days here with some really awesome stuff, and they get switched out all the time. Check out their website for the newest additions. There's around 18 craft beers on tap at any given moment (with still more in bottles), ranging from local to nation-wide stuff. They've done events around Deschutes and Rogue, as well as Stone, I believe. They also do an annual Strong Beer Fest in the fall, which I got to attend last year (that still sounds weird to say -- feels like earlier this year!). We've gotten to know some of the bartenders quite well, and they always take care of us (Jenny, Misty, and Kim, I'm looking at you guys). I've also had probably around half of the things on their ginormous menu by now (the menus themselves are literally ginormous, evidently a printer error, but their selection isn't bad either), and I've only ever been slightly disappointed in one thing (the ahi tuna sandwich). Ok, maybe also the cheese curds, but that's only because I'm so in love with the ones over at Rum Runner. Otherwise, I can vouch that their appetizers, mac & cheese, pizza, sandwiches, wraps, and grilled cheeses (new menu section for those!) are all super delicioso. Between all the beer & all the food, I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask them to start sponsoring a gym membership for me. How dare they have such awesome offerings."}
{"text":"Great place!  Ton of beers to choose from and the food is excellent also.  I got the Meatallica pizza last time I was there and it was honestly one of the best pizzas I've ever had.  Big too!  Leftovers carried me through the next day as well.  Sara, the weekend graveyard bartender is awesome sauce.  Only complaint I have is that it's sooo far away from where I live, so I don't go as much as I'd like to!"}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for ages, but I never feel like driving all the way to the other side of town to try it out. When I saw the Groupon available, so I was excited to get it to force myself to try it out. I waited until two days before the Groupon expired to redeem. 

We came tonight to watch some Monday Night Football and get some beers and grub. I'm not a beer connoisseur, but I do enjoy trying different types and was excited by all the variety here.  

I ordered The Cheese, mac and cheese. It had amazing cheesy goodness. My fella got the wings and my mom ordered the pastrami on rye. The mac n cheese and pastrami were my favorites. I really wanted to try the fried cheese curds, but maybe next time. The food was excellent pub grub and there were tons of other things on the menu that I'm excited to try.

As for the service, it was excellent. Our server was incredibly friendly and attentive. She made excellent drink suggestions and kept our drink refills coming. I was very impressed with the service. 

Looking forward to coming back again soon. I won't be a regular, for the simple reason that it isn't conveniently located to my house, but I'm excited to try their happy hour and getting the tasting glass on my next visit to try more beer varieties."}
{"text":"Bartender / waitress Kim: 5 stars! Friendly, chatty, helpful, overall awesome. :) 

There are so many delicious beers to try and some bottled ones to take home. Next time I'm going to not DD so I can try more!

Happy hour snacks: holy grease fire, batman! We had the beer bites, parmesan fries, onion rings, a couple of the grilled cheeses, and a cheese pizza - everything was tasty but I think we just weren't drunk enough to really appreciate the amount of grease these things were soaked in. 

Like many other bars in this 'hood, it is smoooookey in here but you (unfortunately) get used to it after a while."}
