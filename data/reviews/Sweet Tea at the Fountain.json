{"text":"Delicious and great value! I had the fried fish with greens and mac'n'cheese, plus key lime pie and sweet tea, and all were very tasty. The service was prompt and attentive. This place is very small, so don't miss it!"}
{"text":"I picked up fried chicken from Candy through their catering menu. Best in class for Madison and the real deal overall! Can't wait to try dinner in the restaurant."}
{"text":"One star is being overly generous, zero stars is what this establishment deserves.My family and I were visiting from Detroit and wanted to support a local soul food business. Absolutely horrible, walked in to a completely empty restaurant, No staff, No patrons nothing. We waited around for 15 minutes and not one person was around to greet us.  Don't waste your time going here it was a major disappointment."}
{"text":"Really very impressive food. Menu rotates. Have had nothing that was not stellar.  Who knew carrots could taste awesome?   Not me before Sweet Tea!   And the greens!  Holy crap they are good. This chef could make green cardboard taste good.  Spinach, kale, mustard greens - all awesome. 
Great chicken dishes. Vegetarian. And flippin' homemade pickles!!!!!  
Outstanding food served by nice folks. 
And check out jazz six nights a week at Cafe Coda where you can order Sweet Tea food!  Wow!"}
{"text":"Delicious collard greens and awesome music. Can't wait to com back for an entree. Also prices are"}
{"text":"Awesome food always interesting combinations and choices although each day is essentially a fixed small choice of sides and one main entree'

I have found the bar always friendly and the jazz upstairs at the Fountain fun and local."}
{"text":"Awesome Southern comfort food on State Street! I've had the opportunity to eat here twice and love the offerings. The menu rotates daily and Candace and company do a great job of offering both meat and vegetable mains. This food reminds me of the kind of food my Nana would make growing up. 

The space is a bit small and pretty unassuming. Get your meal to-go and watch the wonderful procession of folks down State Street. 

Please support this black owned restaurant offering killer food downtown!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Fantastic value in the amount of food you get for the mea ($10 gets you entree and 2 sides) The fried chicken was crispy, salty, so flavorful. The mac and cheese was delicious. The fact I can take my food back over to The Fountain, get a beer and thoroughly enjoy this soul food is the best part. I lived in the two-state area of VA/NC/TN for a couple years and this is way better chicken than I ever had living in the south."}
{"text":"I've eatten at Sweet Tea 2 times, both meals were superb. Fantastically seasoned, lots of food for the price. Service is a little slow but I think the staff is still getting acclimated. 

The fried chicken was fabulous. Crispy on the outside but moist and tender on the inside. 

The menu changes daily"}
