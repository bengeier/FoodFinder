{"text":"I echo the reviews of the people below. Meh?  When I think back to what we ate, I honestly can't remember. Every dish has a mumbo jumbo amount of ingredients infused together. Lots of use of interesting techniques, molecular gastronomy etc, but honestly, very style over substance kind of food. If you are looking for substance and style I recommend Bero. Edulis is also good. I'd much prefer going to Edulis over this place (same price point)."}
{"text":"We came in with high expectations and left with our expectations dramatically exceeded.   Highlights: Seasonal fiddleheads flown in from BC Tasting Menu: Best Value for complexity in the city; an Amuse Bouche, Starter, 2 Mains, 2 Deserts for $55 (you can't get even match that price at an average franchise restaurant)  Scallop Seared - starter - fresh seasonal - perfect Duck 2 Ways - well executed Braised Wild Boar - Homerun  Wine Pairing for $30 - Insane 5 accompaniments from white to red to desert wine to port  Service: Sat at Bar - was engaged by the bartender entire meal  Drinks: Cocktail style drinks for $7 dollars   If we could get reservations easier we would be back really soon"}
{"text":"A real whimsical selection of dishes with thoughtful plating. The ambiguous menu descriptions--they just list off a few ingredients like halibut, thistle, sunchoke, etc--up the dining excitement. The human-sized British flag might mislead you, this grub at this eatery has veered away from British towards Canadian.   Service is a bit shoddy. Free wine pours that differ for each guest (one person at our table got about two ounces the other four). Slow bussing of empty plates. And the water was running dry the whole night. Maybe someone did't show up for work? The one waitress working the floor looked beat. The owners hovering around the bar helped deliver a few dishes to the table, but she obviously needed more help."}
{"text":"We had an incredible dinner at the Grove last night.   Admittedly, when it first opened I looked at the menu I didn't think much of it. Nothing really caught my eye and so over the last few months it has slowly moved down my list of must-try places. Fortunately we met friends there for dinner and I am happy that we did.   The space is beautifully understated. Music is great and not too loud and the lighting and wood create a warm, intimate atmosphere.  Every single dish we had was delicious. We started with the fries and mayo ketchup and the devilled eggs. Both were incredible and a good start to the meal while we waited for our friends to join us. The (deep fried?) bread with whipped butter was amazing.   Most of the table had the parsley root soup with the snails, bread and bacon as an appetizer and it was fantastic. One of our party had the steak tartare and it was probably my favourite dish of the night. Really nicely seasoned and not too large a portion. I'd order it again for sure.   I had the cornish hen with sausage rolls. The hen was good and the piece I had was quite moist, with the skin being crispy but my boyfriend said that his piece (we split it) was a little dry. The sausage rolls were amazing! Tiny little bites with a dab of mustard. I could have eaten just those all night.   Two people had the beef, with bone marrow and gentleman's relish. I had a few bites and really enjoyed it. The beef was incredibly tender and the sauce wasn't too sweet (which I often find is a problem).   For dessert  my boyfriend and I split the marshmallow and cream granola and it was AMAZING. So delicious. I'm not a huge fan of marshmallows but this was amazing. Light, flurry and sweet without being overpowering. I'd go back just for coffees and the granola.   The service was quick and efficient at cleaning plates and cutlery between each service and in getting food and drinks out to the table, but not particularly warm or friendly (not rude by any stretch - just no niceties). Not really an issue for me since I usually like my servers to blend into the background while I'm eating but some might find it a little off-putting.   All in all, one of the best meals we've had in Toronto in a long time. Looking forward to the menu changing so that we can go back and try more."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service.  The little \"amuse bouches\" they brought out were great, the potato soupwith duck egg and garlic scapes was unbelievable and the rye berries were nice.  The peach dessert was a little weird and it seemed a bit slow, but the folks working there were friendly and the place is comfortable so it's a pleasant place to sit with a drink and talk with friends while waiting."}
{"text":"....Despite the empty room upon arrival (literally, there was one other sat two-top), we were first given the table at the front beside the drafty windy door.  I told the hostess there was no way I would make it through the meal up there, so they moved us to a table in the back (really a four top with an extra chair). Perfect. Not so much. After our water had been poured we were then told we had to move because a table coming in had actually requested that table because of a specific chair that might help the back (I later understood this request, as the booth chairs were INCREDIBLY uncomfortable).  I think they expected us to move back up to the front, but thankfully we ended up at the very back on a booth four-top that we could squeeze an extra body into. Crisis averted, but let's talk about the rest of the service.  Our servers (I guess everyone kind of helped out), were friendly enough but incredibly forgetful and even inattentive.  Cutlery was brought and changed (thankfully), but getting what we ordered was a bit of a mess.  Two of our (under aged) diners ordered pop/tea, both of which never came until we had to ask about them 20 minutes later. Next, I ordered a cocktail, which just never even came (or appeared on the bill, thankfully).  When we ordered dessert, three of us asked for cappuccinos.  We probably waited about 12-15 minutes for the desserts to come, and the cappuccinos didn't make it until AFTER we had finished our sweets.  It's one thing if the bar and servers were slammed, but the place was still pretty quiet, and I saw the cappuccinos sitting on the bar mantle for at least 4 minutes before getting picked up. Speaking of beverages, other than the cappuccinos, pop and tea, between three drinkers, we had Old Fashions, a Bourbon Sour, and Bloody Mary (made with \"mushroom ketchup\" and garnished with a pickled quail egg).  I was a little disappointed in the Bloody Mary- it had a hint of rich umami flavour, but otherwise tasted really watered down and bland- I probably should have asked them to make it \"extra spicy\" for me. The other cocktails were classic and well received- if I had received my second round, I might have more details to divulge......"}
{"text":"The prices are semi affordable, the food was terrible and the service sucked!   My wife and I finished our two iced teas in record time and weren't asked if we wanted refills even after the waitress dropped off our meals, the Veal Parmesan was lacking in every way but the cheese... Maybe these guys can only make pizza... But from what I saw I wouldn't rely on the delivery guy to get it to your door.   Someone, I forget who told me this place was good...  I don't think they had ever been."}
{"text":"The food was very, very good but the service not so much.  We sat at the table for a good fifteen minutes before the waiter came over to ask us about drinks and then gave us attitude when told we would not be drinking.  Literally rolled his eyes as he took away the wine list and glasses.  We ordered our meals when he delivered the club sodas close to ten minutes after we ordered them.    Our meals were delicious and very well presented if a little on the small side.  In fact I told my partner I'd like to go back just to sample other dishes on the menu.  There are only four appetizers, four mains and two deserts to choose from so a couple of visits and you can cover the whole thing.  Speaking of deserts, the waiter brought the wrong one and seemed annoyed when I asked for the one I had ordered.    If I was rating on the food alone I would give a higher rating but the service brought the star level down."}
{"text":"Being part of the great Commonwealth, us Canadians are well familiar with British 'cuisine'. Steak and chips, bacon sarnies, and anything curried.  But this isn't your gran's cooking, if you know what I mean.  The ubiquitous name, the high ceilings, exposed brick walls and mismatched place settings are a little too 'on trend' for me, but the servers, bartender and kitchen crew clearly know what they are doing--and they do it very, very well.  The menu is compact and for this lactard/glutard there were only 3 options that I could order. And Tiffany, our very talented server was diligent to double check with the kitchen on each item ordered for hidden dairy and gluten. One GF/DF dish ordered being the chips and curried ketchup...think fluffy, crispy, hot tater tots of your youth with sweet, limey curry ketchup. Addictive. I *may* have had two orders.   However, my handsome dining companion, who is food-allergy free, had the black pudding devilled eggs (his second favourite bite of the night), Beef, bone marrow, celeriac and gentlemen's relish (think amped up HP sauce). While one side of the beef was burnt, the rest was delish.   And finally for Pudding--the chocolate and celery mousse. The celery mousse tastes exactly like, well, celery, and is IMHO, an unnecessary foil for the dark and rich chocolate. Maybe something spicy or heck, even curried, would have been better. But the teeny tiny spoonful of the chocolate mousse I had was, by far, my favourite spoonful of the evening.  Great wine list, solid cocktails and on a snowy February evening, the Grove is the kind of place that makes you want to stay awhile and see what's next."}
{"text":"We used to dine at olive grove frequently before the new owners took over.  The staff, and especially their pizza were worth the trip.     The last few visits have proven that the new owners have taken a decent business and are running into the ground.     Rude staff, moldy sandwiches, stale bread, and to top it off, they scraped an allergen off the bun, and re-presented it.      I wanted to believe in this place that some changes would result in a better business.  That is not the case.    Unfortunately, we gave the team the opportunity to make it right, and have long-standing customers return.  Instead we received an awful phone call, accusing us of slander.  No one even wanted our money back.  A business who showed they cared about their customers would be nice, for a small community restaurant.    Poor management, poor food, and most of all, a terrible experience fixing a moment of truth with long standing customers."}
{"text":"Going by the yelp designation for what a 2 star rating is... \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" is fairly accurate.  Pretty good bites; a single lettuce leaf denoted caesar salad, a fantastic zucchini fritter and chilled pea soup (like a smoother, greener Campbell's concentrated green pea soup but actually good).  All of these bites were great.  The pretzel baguettes, also great.  The cedar wood grilled asparagus with way too much rapeseed aioli, not great.  I forget what the other app was, if there was one.  The first main plate of salmon was fantastic, but ever so tiny, as one would expect with all of these tasting dishes. The second main plate of ~24 hr (exact time?) sous-vide beef rib was just terrible.  Full of grissol, cold and red.  Cheese plate was pretty good, pre-dessert was very good and dessert was meh.  All in all, it wasn't worth the money.  There were redeeming qualities, but it just wasn't worth the money.  There are many different flavours so if that's what you want from $55, great - this place is for you.  If you want different flavours that are also great and you don't want to feel like you need a cheeseburger afterward, skip it.  Interior was decorated very comfortingly.  Staff was absolutely wonderful and attentive.  Bang on."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  Every dish I had was a flavor bomb of heaven.  I was worried it would turn out be similar to Yours Truly, where everything sounds and looks amazing but just tastes weird.     Instead, everything looked and tasted incredible.  And personally I found the 5 course prix fixe very filling.  The desserts were the only dishes that weren't incredible.  One was decent, the other just plain weird. But knowing that the menu changes frequently, I don't doubt that the next time I go, the desserts will be delicious.    I will definitely go back and I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"One word to describe this place: DISMAL.    From the ornery host/greeter/server, to the mediocre tasting food, to the painfully slow service, everything about this place is dismal.  We came here because some friends got us a gift certificate.  We concluded that those friends must secretly hate us.  Let's break down this dismal experience by food & service.  SERVICE: We were promptly provided with water upon our seating.  We then sat sipping our water for a solid 15 minutes before a server came to check on us.  Since this place only offers a prix fixe menu, it's not like we needed much time to scour the menu and make some decisions.  (Side note: If you're going to play loud music in your establishment, make sure your servers can SPEAK UP.)  We wound up getting the 5/6 course meal with wine pairings.  There was a solid 10-15 minute lag time between courses.  It might not have been so bad except for the mis-timed wine pourings.  So we wound up consuming our wine before the course it was meant to compliment arrived.    (Side note 2: Extremely uncomfortable chairs.  Goes with the theme of this joint: style over substance.)  FOOD: To echo previous reviews, if you're going to go for molecular gastronomy, know how to do it well.  This place is way more concerned with making deconstructed, powdered, foamerized food than actually producing good tasting food.   - \"Snack\": Deconstructed caesar salad on a single piece of lettuce.  They actually forgot to bring us this dish, along with the bread, and we had to remind our server of this after we received the 2nd listed course.  Oh, and they also forgot our wine pairings until we reminded our server.  The \"snack\" was fine but I would have rather just eaten a freakin caesar salad.  - Heirloom tomato:  Highlight of the meal, but hard to go wrong with an in-season ripe heirloom tomato.  Complimented with ricotta cheese and some frozen melon balls.  - Poached duck egg soup:  Egg was poached well.  Soup was just meh.  Complimented with crispy chicken skin which, when put in soup, becomes soggy chicken skin.   - Turbot with mussels:  I can't remember the last time I ate a more boring piece of fish.  Dear lord was this bland.  Same goes for the \"brown butter foam\" on my plate.  If you're going to do foam, make sure it tastes good.  Otherwise, just put freakin sauce on the plate.  - Quail stuffed with sausage:  I love quail and I nearly cried when I realized how horrible this was.  Completely flavorless.  That poor quail died in vain.  To make things worse, there was some powdered, frozen foie gras on the plate.  I guess when my server described the dish, the pounding music drowned out the part that there wouldn't be actual foie on my plate.  - Two ice cream based desserts: In short, do us all a favor and please, please stop making ice cream.  Was it just an off night for this place?  Perhaps.  But we won't be back to find out."}
{"text":"My friends and I have been to this restaurant in the past, and even though the prices seemed a bit high, the food was ALRIGHT. My freind and I went back on Thursday nighy and had nachos and small pizza. Needless to say, we both spent the entire Friday and the weekend with FOOD POISONING.  In addition, the waitress was super awkard amd rude. You really don't need to hover over me when I am paying with the machine to see how much tip I am leaving.  We are NEVER going back again. I am disgusted."}
{"text":"This place is great! We had the tasting menu and everything was out of this world and extremely well priced - $55! Great spot for a date or meeting up with friends. I've been to 1 Michelin star gastropubs in NYC and this beats it hands down."}
{"text":"An old dental office come rustic restaurant with high ceilings (15 ft), open concept kitchen and exposed brick walls with knickknacks all around including a vintage fridge from the 50s, mismatched chairs and a long harvest country dining table in the front window space for good people.  Elevated British pub fare is the name of the game.  The amuse are english chips with a potent curry dipping sauce.  The chips were perfectly salted, crispy and piping hot and I enjoyed them so much that I burnt the top of my mouth because I didn't want to wait for the chips to cool down. My appetizer was the parsley-root soup - a must have.  Presented with juicy and plump snails, crispy sourdough bread cubes and bacon nubbies while a velvety and creamy puree of simplicity was poured on top making the soup whole.  My friend had the first spoon full and she literally closed her eyes and relished the goodness of the soup for a moment.  It was amazing to watch and more amazing to taste! She had the chanterelle mushrooms, black pudding (yes, blood sausage out of the casing) on toast served with a poached duck egg which was nice and flavourful as well. Our mains came shortly after and while they looked like small plates - they were quite hearty.   Heaton's beef, oyster dish is his take on surf and turf as he pairs beef two ways--skirt steak and short ribs--with fried oysters, over greens.  My girlfriend once again after taking a bite of the oyster lost herself as her eyes closed and she stopped in mid-conversation to savour the bite.  She wouldn't even share her other oyster bite with me as it was that good.  The beef was very tender as well but the highlight was the oyster. I had the cod served with small clams and crispy bacon slices in a beurre brun.   The cod was melt in your mouth delicious infused with flavours of bacon - it was so good!  We were too full to try any of the sweet delicacies at the end of our meal but I definitely will come back before the madness starts and I have to line up for this goodness!"}
{"text":"This restaurant certainly deserves all the praise it is receiving. The service was fantastic-taking great care of our group of 20. The food was amazing, and the drinks were very tasty, and some I've never even heard of before. I highly recommend the bone marrow, and ask for a shot of pickle juice (you'll be surprised!)."}
{"text":"I would give this place five stars on the food alone, but the story goes way beyond that. Cool, but unpretentious vibe, super friendly staff and a nice place to spend a few hours.   Short menu, but unbelievably delicious. Knock your socks off. Yum. Coctail menu was very creative and the beer on tap is craft brewed. Will come here again.   You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had takeout from here the other night. The pizza was great. Tons of cheese, and they didn't skimp on the toppings. The girl who took my order was friendly. The restaurant is huge, and it was empty on a Friday night.  But I'd definitely go here again."}
{"text":"I am not surprised that this restaurant closed down.  My wife and I were here for a friend's birthday as this restaurant was apparently featured in certain Toronto foodie or trending magazines.    Our main issue with this place is that a restaurant is somewhere you satisfy a need (hunger) and we didn't find it here.  While the fixed menu seemed delicious on paper (indeed I was so hungry after the meal I probably would have eaten the paper), everything that was served would not even qualify as a snack.  We had trouble containing our chuckle when our salad was literally ONE piece of lettuce with mayo on it.  Yum.    I ordered the chicken as the entree thinking that I would at least get a thigh or something to fill me up.  Nope - I got literally 3 slices of chicken.  I didn't know chicken was so expensive that it had to be rationed out to customers paying $50+ for a meal.    Our group ended up more hungry coming out of the restaurant than going in, since the whole experience took 2 hours.  This place scarred me even more with so called trendy foodie places...I will vote more wisely with my wallet.   Good riddance."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best restaurants I have been to in a while. I went with two other people and we shared all the dishes we ordered (bill was about $175 and I think we each had 1-2 drinks).  The portions are small but SO GOOD! The chefs are so creative and the menu is always changing. Service was great and I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I rarely find the 5 star system too blunt. But this was a tough call between 4 and 5.   If money is no object, this place is just a blast. Each dish is an exciting new experiment in eating weird plants (grape vines; sea asparagus) or dusted nuts or crisped malts with mostly interesting and nicely done main items like guinea fowl or octopus or hanger steak. In between courses come more tiny surprises (devilled eggs; strawberry puree chocolate cookies). You will not be bored here.  But you will chew with your front teeth. The dishes are tiny. And if dropping $150 vs. $100 on a two person meal matters to you, you should think twice. A couple of the dishes seemed to lack bold flavours in spite of the interesting ingredients. And one of the wines I tried (the zweigelt rose) was very flat indeed. Not such a sin, but rather disappointing at $12 a glass.   You pick 3, 5 or 7 dishes ($45, 55 and 65). Or, as we did, do 4 each (3 + 5). And then when you're still hungry, order two more. The thing is, as each tiny plate arrives (not withstanding the amuse-bouches), you wonder if you are going to want to pop into the KFC across the street to finish dinner afterwards. We ended by ordering 2 more dishes (two amazing chocolate ganaches).   Still, this restaurant was a ton of fun and I look forward to telling people about it. I'll just tell them to bring their wallets--and have a late lunch, too.   Service--excellent Ambience/decor--excellent"}
{"text":"Terrible terrible service. Friday night not very busy. Our waitress is the worst I've had in a decade and to make it even worse it's the owners daughter so what can you say? Went up to bar to order from him instead but he ignored me as well. First and last time here."}
{"text":"Wow...I have to wonder what happened the evening I was there. Checked out all the Yelp reviews beforehand and was excited to try this place out.  What a disappointment...decor was okay...food was mediocre at best...service was worse. I didn't like a dish and chose not to finish it.  Easy...just clear the plate when you clear the table. BUT...don't ask why I don't like it and then give me attitude about my opinion. I'm not going to bother writing more...it's not worth the star I'm obliged to give."}
{"text":"I have been reading so much about the The Grove, I felt the need to see what all of the fuss was about. What a great little joint.   The atmosphere was great for my dinner plans with my BFF but it would also be really romantic if you're on a date (amazing first date potential!). It does have the Ossington feel where the space is long and narrow but it's great. And as a bonus (come on, we all think about it), the washrooms were singlettes.. nice and private!  The service was exceptional. They were attentive yet not pushy, and were very knowledgeable about the dishes they were selling.  Here's where I get a bit confused. The Appetizers we had were delish, We tried Raw beef, onion, egg, marmite AND Lobster and sweetbreads on toast. The size portions were great. Amazing for sharing. The entrees though were really small in comparison. I had the Beef, bone marrow, celeriac, gentlemen's relish. It was great but really left me wanting more.. But then back to the dessert, A bowl of marshmallow and granola goodness. It was back to being a great portion size for sharing.  All in all this restaurant is definitely worth going to. The food is good, the people are great and the atmosphere is cozy."}
{"text":"I'd like to rant and rave about the Grove....but I just can't. The food was terrific, don't get me wrong. But the whole experience was just...well...pretentious. There, I said it.  I think it all comes down to whether or not you are a food foam kinda person. If you like foam, you will LOVE the Grove. And I don't judge that. There is some tasty kick-ass foam out there.  But if you are more of a Ruby Watchco, generous portions of wholesome, loving food kinda person the Grove may feel a bit...well...pretentious.   Best: deconstructed fish and chips - perfectly cooked cod with two kinds of peas (barely cooked fresh whole peas) and a killer silky smooth puree, deep fried beer batter, a house made aioli and potato chip.   Meh: shaved coconut sorbet (why shaved?) had a light, clean finish but didn't have that much personality.  Music was much too loud. I was literally shouting to my friend sitting one foot away from me.   I think the way to do this place is to spend the $50 and get 5 courses. We did three and couldn't help noticing how small the plates were. So pick a night when you want to splurge, go for 5 courses (I'll bet the wine pairing is great) and have yourself a delicious foamy blast. Maybe you can get your server to smile.   Vegetarian Score: 5/10. This is not a great resto for veggies. They only offered two savoury vegetarian dishes and neither was a homerun."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza for takeout. No idea about anything else as I've never eaten in or tried anything else on the menu. The place does look a little dated and it's not really a great location as it's adjoining an old mall.  But if you want pizza this is one of the best places to get it, so I'm going solely on the pizza"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the place. brick walls, beautiful chairs. trendy looking. good vibe. AMAZING food. the menu is a bit hard to understand, I ordered new potatoes, thinking that I'm ordering a side potato wedge or something, but it was the most delicious potato dish ever.  Also tried the crab cake.  which was more like a crab bruschetta. YUMMY, and I'm soooo not a crab person. Staff were super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Was recommended by a friend.  Thoroughly enjoyed the great food as well as super friendly service.  I tried the Parsley root soup, snails, bacon, fried bread ( I requested to exclude bacon and was obliged), plus\" Celeriac dumplings, hens, truffle, duck egg, watercress\" as the main.  Wanted to order \"Chinook, crab, cabbage, black pudding, hollandaise\" but the bartender politely advised that black pudding contains ham that I do not eat. I did not want to request the Chef to change the recipe, and instead changed the order. Both the Parsley soup and the Celeriac dumpling main were outstanding.   For the dessert I ordered, \"Pistachio and almond tart, pomegranate, orange clotted cream\" and it was also wonderful.  I went today without reservation on impulse. Will visit again with my wife and sons and will reserve in advance. All in all a  great discovery!"}
{"text":"Service: Knowledagble, they fold your napkin when you leave to go to the bathroom!  Ambience: For a Tuesday night this place was packed. Dimmed lights and candles on every table. Warm and inviting.  Food: Two snacks were ordered. Chips with curried ketchup and the smoked mackerel on toast. Both were delicious! Instead of complimentary bread and butter like other establishments, brioche and whipped butter were served! Mains- beef,bone marrow, celeriac root and \"gentleman's relish\". The beef was so tender and the sauce made a great accompaniment. Halibut, trumpets, Chicken skin, red wine, bacon. Two pieces of fish cooked perfectly with the perfect crunch being provided by the chicken skin. The plate was cleaned! The chef and his cooks seem to enjoy they're work with all the amazing plates being put out.  I would definitely go back. Next time for the tasting menu!  Side note: They have Innis and Gunn cask!"}
{"text":"I really don't like to be negative, but this place seemed slightly confused to me. First appearances... the outside looks super-doper. The prices represent a higher end restaurant, but the food itself was not so great. The restaurant is divided into two parts, the restaurant and the lounge. They serve the same food in the restaurant as they do in the lounge. The lounge was clean, but decorated in a more causal style with the floral seat coverings that make you wonder why.?! I would recommend going here for a beer and a snack to listen to the live music or join in the karaoke on Tuesday nights, but as far as fine dining... hummmm no.  Oh and they have VLT's."}
{"text":"I'm still thinking about this meal!! We got the 5 course tasting menu for $50/head and the wine pairings for $40 /head. Both courses and wines were consistently scrumptious. Over and above our courses, we got prosecco and snacks before our first course arrived, a brioche with creme fraiche halfway through the meal, and finally bourbon drops at the very end. All the food was delicious and beautifully presented. I thought I would be hungry since the portions were all so tiny, but by the time my 4th course came my dining partner and I were already struggling. Not sure how that happened, but we will definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"Booked the restaurant after reading reviews from En Route and Macleans.  I'm definitely a fan! Three of us all ordered different things and basically ate all the food family style. The most memorable dish for me was the salmon, which was cooked to perfection ( I usually don't order salmon since they are always overcooked). We also had very good wine and cocktail there, that's probably why I can't remember too much of the other dishes...  All I remember is the meal was delicious!!"}
{"text":"Unpretentious, well put-together food and excellent service. Though some things can seem a bit pricey ($14 glasses of wine), it is well worth it and there are some tasty inexpensive options.  Tip #1: Come with a 4+ group so that you can get the table at the front. You'll feel like you are the only group in the restaurant. I've been there twice now on a weekday, and had little problem getting the table by reserving it a day in advance.  Tip #2: Have the chips and curry ketchup as a starter. $4 and it's fantastic: crisp, perfectly cooked chips.  Tip #3: Try the cocktails.  $9-$11 and comparable to the same cocktails at $14-$16 that you get elsewhere.  Tip #4 (haven't tried this myself): Sit at the bar. They have a \"snacks\" menu and a nice cask ale and reasonable cocktails, so it might be a nice place to start your night.  1st visit I had the lobster salad, which was light and fresh. For my main I had \"Halibut, hens, Chicken skin, red wine, bacon\". \"Hens\" means the hen-of-the-woods mushroom. Crispy, well-cooked fish. Nicely constructed dish. I started with a Manhattan which was excellent and reasonably priced. Also, we had a fantastic wine but I didn't order it, so I don't know what it was.  2nd visit I had the tasting menu which was delicious, it included: fish, lamb, and beef cheek. Would be a nice date menu. Also had a nice Pinot Noir with it."}
{"text":"*we went opening night (or at least their first Sat) so will cut a bit of slack*    The space is a repeat of many of those Ossignton / Dundas spots.  Unfinished = cool, I guess.  Not inspired.  Not too crowded, we had plenty of space at our table.  You are very aware of the kitchen and the staff pass back and forth quite a bit.  At one point I felt like i was in a staff meeting - literally wanted to stand up and organize their service team, who were discussing everything by this hutch in the middle and then running back and forth over and over between the kitchen and the bar - not enjoyable or chill.  Menu was limited, SMALL portions - creative and well executed...extremely pricey.  Would be pretty upset if I was taking someone out for dinner and I saw 20-30 entrees that did not have more than 4 bites - they will be forced to change I am sure.  Poor guy by us was definitely flipping out as his date ordered a whole second round of food!  Bar area was fun...better than the restaurant energy-wise.  Doubt I would go back or recommend others do until I hear they have ironed out the kinks and increased the portion sizes."}
{"text":"4.5 STARS  Tried the 5 course meal and i was very impressed with the quality and technique used.  I tried the lobster soup, scallop pasta, onglet, duck, and blackberry for dessert.  I can go into more detail but there is too much to write and i am doing this from work LOL  Basically what you need to know is that you need to try this place because the service, food, and experience was top notch.  The waitress was on top of her game and knew everything about everything.  Not to mention they had accents which was sexy :)"}
{"text":"Dining room or lounge - Worst food ive had in a while. Went there when i was younger and hated it. Came in years later with an open mind and empty stomach and left retching and regretting returning. 4 people ate - all said was disgusting."}
{"text":"The Brits aren't exactly known for their proprietary cuisine, so we were curious to try this British-inspired resto having all lived abroad in the party. The food was nothing to complain about - a little bland but non-offensive, and the restaurant itself was warm and welcoming, not unlike your average British pub.  Not my cup of tea, but I'm sure there are many who have a flavouring for it."}
{"text":"I went with the impression that this was the best new restaurant in Canada. I have to say it didn't disappoint BUT it wasn't a \"holy sh*t\" meal. We had the tasting menu so tried the chips with the amazing tamarind sauce, smoked mackerel and mussels on toast (also brilliant), snail-bacon-veggie soup (yes I am making it sound unappetizing but its very good). The fish main dish (forget if it was cod) was the highlight for me but the following item, the beef cheeks, which I was very excited about, was a bit of a letdown. Honestly, it tasted like the beef cheek I had at banh mi boys- not the flavour, but the quality of the meat. In any case, it is a very decent restaurant but Toronto's best new restaurant? Maybe not."}
{"text":"The food was delish! You can really tell that they actually spend time to make it just right. The extras kept coming and we're loving it! Advertized as 3 meals course for $40 but we actually got 5 amuse bouche! What restaurant does that these days? The only complained will be the portion... I was ok but the boys were still hungry after. Overall the place is good way to experience some interesring taste."}
{"text":"A friend and I wanted to try something new and the reviews for the Grove were generous, so we decided to give it a try.  I ordered the following: Parsnip & Escargot Soup Pork Belly Beef Cheek Lamb  I enjoyed all the dishes, in fact i though each dish was better than the last. But something tells me they plan it that way... :)"}
{"text":"The room and fixtures were nicely appointed and the food had a great presentation -- i ordered lamb chops, with lamb sausage and gravy ($26) plus a side order of mini yorkshire puddings ($5) and they looked great. The cooking too was reasonably well executed, though my friend, who ordered the duck was less impressed with the taste of his. But...the portions are miniscule! I was still hungry at the end, $50 later. i'd consider eating at the grove if the portions got larger or the prices went down. Until then, i'll just be ordering drinks at the bar..."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere and thoughtful food but I found it all really forgettable.   Manfriend and I ordered off the tasting menu and each had a glass of wine (a bit on the expensive side, even for Toronto.) The food was good, but nothing really stood out to us - it was kind of like a lacklustre version of Yours Truly. If you're looking for a delicious tasting menu that you'll be thinking about days or weeks after, I'd skip this place."}
{"text":"This restaurant has been on my radar for a while now but I was always somewhat skeptical.  I loved the idea of the restaurant, kind of like chose your own prix fixe, but I was also aware of the possible Archille's heel of this place -- the portions, pretentiousness and what not.  I did not want to have a meal of just micro greens, jellies, and foams.  So, I decided to dine here tonight because I was feeling for lighter fares.  My boyfriend and I went for the 5 courses for $55 per person and -- even though there were the above mentioned frills --we were actually quite full after the meal.  The dishes I really enjoyed were the octopus (I never thought I'd say this but the fava beans were blowing my mind!, the tagliatelle in uni sauce (even though I would prefer a more thicker pasta), the pickled mackerel, the deviled eggs with truffles, and the tiny shrimp slider things (they were complementary so I forgot what their real names are).  All the dishes were very complex and meticulously thought out -- every element had its own preparation before being part of the dish.  However, the whole experience for me in general was simply overwhelming, even though I had moments of genuine glee sprinkled throughout the meal.  This may be because both my boyfriend and I did not enjoy the meats of our meal:  my duck and his onglet.  I didn't like how much fruit there was with my duck and the onglet was VERY heavy handed with the seasoning.  That may be the issue for me; the flavours were great, but the meal ultimately lacked \"grounding\" -- or substance.  Even with Japanese omakases, there are not heavy dishes but there is usually a lot of rice in the makis and sushis towards the end of the meal.  That is what my meal lacked tonight -- even though I was full, I did not feel satisfied. I think I was pleasantly surprised because my worst fears did not come true, but my expectation about what this place could be were not met.  That being said, I do encourage anyone who enjoys having all parts of their palates explored in one sitting and discussing the food with their dinner companions to go."}
{"text":"Went here on a suggestion of a friend, and was SO happy I did!  The Grove was basically made for me. If I had to create my own restaurant, this would be it! It's all about the tasting menu!   The restaurant itself is well designed with lots of groups of tables and a long bar when you arrive. There is dim lighting and I honestly think this would be a perfect date spot, especially if you and your date were up for splitting each others food (more options!!).  They have a great cocktail list and a decent wine list, with a good variety coming by the glass. Cocktails are a little pricey, coming in around $14, but well worth it. I tried the \"Corpse Reviver\" and was quite happy with it, it had a serious kick.   The Tasting Menu is $45 for 5 choices, and is unbelievable. You select 4 savory choices and one dessert.   Each dish comes out beautifully plated, like a piece of art! Everything I tried was amazing, my favorite being the seared tuna with chicken skin chips and frozen guacamole (WHAT?!).   During the meal, they break up your courses with a few little bites which come on the house. For us, this including a tiny Parmesan puff, teeny personal baguettes, and a delicious mini dessert tart.   I LOVE that I was able to try so many little things, and still feel completely satisfied at the end of my meal. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Loved it! Couldn't get into another restaurant, stumbled across this one. Very limited signage, I thought it might be apart of Churchills (next door). I hate the way there menu is presented, minimalist, only listing the ingredients. Not the preparation.  But I order the beef, Jeremy ordered the Arctic Char, mine was decidedly better, but both were great. The potato chips at the beginning (served with smoked cumin ketchup) are great, the scallops were amazing. Nice interior, good service. Weak Pimms cup (needs more mint and berries). Will return."}
