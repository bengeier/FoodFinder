{"text":"Ok BBQ. I prefer the sauce added during the chopping, so adding it was just ok. The price seemed high for a pound at $12.99. Hushpuppies were a good blend of corn meal and onion. Staff need smiles."}
{"text":"Good barbecue and fried chicken. Sides are mediocre at best, so I make my own sides at home to go with my order."}
{"text":"Class? Show of hands for those who think a Yankee should not have the first review of a BBQ joint?  Thanks for your input.   I tried the BBQ plate of pulled chicken. Comes with a hefty portion of pulled chicken and white bread bun (they can keep the bun) along with two sides. I got the mac n cheese YUM and the green beans and stewed tomatoes(they can keep them too).The chicken was great with some Carolina gold sauce.   Also tried a full rack of BBQ ribs. These are stellar. Big, thick, meaty,fall off the bone, baby back ribs, nicely coated in BBQ sauce. I also got a side of BBQ baked beans.Delicious. 4 star ribs!   Here's where the stars start to fall from the sky. I tried a \"by the bulk\" order of pulled pork. (we're talking 1LB) I was disappointed that it was dry. By dry, I mean no sauce. Yeah, they gave me a few (three) little cups of sauce but each was a different flavor?  So I ended up with 1LB. of pork and about three tablespoons of sauce. Each container approx. a tablespoon in three different flavors?   This BBQ thing is confusing the sh*t atta this Yankee.  I do see on their menu that you can order a bottle of their sauce($5) and I would have , had I known, because the portion I got to try with the sauce was good.   I guess they assume anyone ordering BBQ has done so before and knows how to roll. Me? Not so much.   Over all, I thought the service was great on each visit besides them trying to confuse the crap out of this little damsel in distress (*blink *blink)  My, my, my, I do declare confusion."}
{"text":"Just had this for lunch and it was delicious! We got the family special which came with a generous helping of BBQ for each person. The BBQ comes dry (without sauce) and included our choice of 3 different sauces. It also came with 3 large sides. We picked mac and cheese, baked beans, and white coleslaw. Everything was tasty and we had enough left overs for supper. Before this we had only been to the Stallings location. The atmosphere is not the same outside of the original rock store, but the food was excellent!"}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Fast service with a smile. Prices are very competitive. Clean and casual atmosphere.  They also offer catering service.  The food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I've wanted to try this place for a while, but I kept hesitating in going. Honestly I wasn't very happy with my food. I ordered the Beef Brisket and the Shredded Pork. Both lacked considerable flavor. If it wasn't for the sauces available, they would've had no flavor at all. The potato salad wasn't so good the mac & cheese was so so...The baked beans could've come out of a can. Overall I should've kept hesitating in going. Won't be returning"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today and ordered the pulled chicken sandwich and a side order of banana pudding. Not very much of what I expected, the chicken was very bland and I had to add my own sauce. My assumption was that it was all made together and had everything marinated instead of pulling out an already made sandwich and throwing it in a bag. The banana pudding was just OK, I've had much better. It was just an OK experience, staff was very nice tho and clean environment. Just not up to par on food for my standards of BBBQ."}
{"text":"One of the BEST BBQ restaurants that I go to. I live in Harrisburg-University City and drive the 30 minutes to pick it up! FANTASTIC- always 5 stars!"}
{"text":"While in the past we have enjoyed the BBQ from this establishment, sadly today they earned a 1 star rating from a livid customer.  It is Sunday, and this location is open 11-7pm, one would think during those hours they plan to serve customers.  Not the case.  At 6pm...you know...dinner time, we go in to buy pork BBQ and get told they don't have any...yet they are still open for some reason........their reasoning for this is that they close at 7 so they wouldn't cook more??  I found this reason both lazy and unacceptable for a pork BBQ restaurant.  If you don't want to serve people at dinner time then close earlier and save us the time of going to your establishment only to be turned away wasting my time and thus losing any future business you would possibly receive from us.  I hope the owners of The Rock Store happen to read this and can understand how asinine it is for a BBQ place to not have BBQ at dinner time on the weekend.  Shut down early so your lazy incompetent employees who think this is excusable practice can go home and not pretend to be open for business when there is no food....at 6 o'clock...you know, when most of the country eats a meal...  Fresh food is deserved by all who are willing to support your business and pay for your product no matter if its 6 hours to close or 15 minutes.  Choosing your restaurant as we have many times in the past to only be offered \"whatever we have left\" at 6pm is unacceptable.  I get that shortages happen, I really do.  My problem is that is was 6 fucking o'clock..."}
{"text":"I love the food here. The pulled pork with the Stallings Secret sauce is where it's at! The banana pudding is creamy and amazing. The hushpuppies are my favorite. Do yourself a favor and enjoy some food from this great BBQ joint."}
{"text":"Our family loves good BBQ. We will travel a good distance to eat it. We will not be return customers here. While the staff was friendly, the food was a big disappointment. It seemed that the food was cooked somewhere else and reheated for this location. I don't think they made anything there. Well, maybe their banana pudding which was gross. It was a waste of time and money. It's sad to see a lack of care and attention to quality, because this place could be nice."}
{"text":"Just had lunch there and was pleasantly surprised with the value. That is, it wasn't the best bbq I've ever had but it was priced well. For 7.50$ you can get a good sized platter of pork, 2 sides and some complimentary hush puppies. I had the beans and mac and cheese for my sides. The pork itself was cooked \"clean\" as they called it which just meant it wasn't seasoned with any BBQ sauce before it gets to you. They have 3 sauces that are set out on the tables for you to try a vinegar base, mustard base and another one that escapes me at this very moment. Anyways, I tried the two sauces other than the vinegar base one and they were both acceptable. I kinda think Macs Speedshop has a better mustard based sauce but that is another story. The side of beans was \"ok\" in that it obviously came from a can and the mac and cheese was good but probably needed some salt. As for the staff they were very friendly and engaging when it came to the menu and were happy to explain any items we had questions about.  With it's location being kind of in a strip mall and catering more to the fast food bbq scene there again, its a good value. If you're in the area and want to try some quick BBQ this is the spot for you."}
{"text":"Very very good BBQ....the sides however suck.  I love great BBQ and hated to see first Elliott's and then Outlaw BBQ go out of business.  I have always really liked the Rock Store's BBQ but the sides are horrible.  The slaw taste like it's Ruth's or Star's store bought...and that is nasty stuff, we tried the Mac & Cheese and it's boxed Craft if I had to guess.  The beans taste like canned beans, and the banana pudding also tasted like it was out of the box.  We're eating their BBQ tonight, but we ordered just sandwiches, we bought chips from the store and it's a very good meal.  Overall the BBQ is awesome, the sides not so much....if they fix that, they will be one of the best BBQ places in Charlotte."}
{"text":"As soon as you open the door you know that real, quality BBQ is coming your way. The smell of the smoke used to craft their food is abundant, and it should be.....it's the real deal. I am from this area and smoke lots of BBQ myself so I feel pretty qualified for reviewing a BBQ restaurant. I have tried all of the meats the offer and they all have brought a smile to my face. I am partial to the pulled pork, but  really everything will please. The sides are really good, I have tried them all but the slaw and love them all. The hush puppies are my favorite and are addictive. They offer 3 sauces, each are very good, try them all. The portions are great, if you leave hungry it is not their fault. The place itself is a small, plain, no frills hole in the wall.....and the prices reflect that. If they were a stand alone, large place the prices would more than likely be higher....but would still be a great deal. Bottom line, this Carolina boy is happy to have this place near by, it keeps me from firing up my pit so often."}
{"text":"I first went to the Rock Store BBQ in Marshville and Matthews and was kind of excited that they opened a location in Mint Hill. Honestly, Rock Store's bbq is not out of this world and you certainly can get better around town but for the price and convenience it is a solid choice. Their three sauces are real good. I actually would use all of them. They do have your typical side items of slaw, mac and cheese, stew, beans etc. Again, the sides are decent but nothing special. Certainly not homemade items either.  But there prices reflect that. At arounf $7 for a plate compared to $13 at some of the better bbq places in Charlotte. The store is on Mint Hill Matthews Road in down town Mint Hill right next to Harris Teeter (old Lowes Foods)"}
{"text":"Great stop for a quick cheap lunch.  $6 Pork BBQ Sandwich Combo is fantastic. Good food fast?  Fast food good?  I dunno.  The BBQ is great, very clean.  You chose your sauces, if any.  Corn bread is to die for, some of the other sides could be better."}
{"text":"For starters-let me explain what BBQ means in the Carolinas.  Unless you see a BBQ restaurant with a modifier like Texas or St. Louis, you can bet that BBQ is pulled or minced PORK.  In eastern NC, they flavor the BBQ with vinegar-esque sauce.  In western NC (i.e. 'piedmont style'), its flavored with tomato sauce.  SC style BBQ is flavored with mustard.    The Rock House is typical Carolinas BBQ that caters to all tastes.  The BBQ is cooked plain and you are given a choice of these 3 aforementioned sauces to doctor it up.  Though their BBQ is not as flavorful as actually marinating the BBQ in the sauces, Rock House makes a meaty BBQ sandwich for a good price.  Their lunch combo is $5.50, which a BBQ sandwich, a side dish, and a drink.  If you don't like slaw, be sure to order your sandwich without it.  This is standard procedure for making  BBQ sandwiches.   The mac n cheese is the best-creamy, cheddary goodness, yum yum.  The baked beans are top-notch as well.  Like your typical BBQ joint, they have banana pudding, coleslaw, and Brunswick stew as sides.  If you're in Mint Hill, stop by the Lowe's Foods to find this little gem.  Also, they have a location in Stallings- a literal rock house on Old Charlotte Hwy. (or Monroe Rd. as its called in Charlotte).  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I always enjoy delicious Rock Store BBQ, and frequent this store as often as I'm able to.   The service I experienced tonight, as always at this location, was of the highest quality. The two gentlemen working the counter were polite, personable, friendly, and efficient. This store is consistently clean and orderly. The condiments and drink accessory bar are always fully stocked.  For dinner I enjoyed the always delicious pulled pork BBQ plate, which has a rich smoked flavor and is always perfectly tender - I chose to pair it with the Stalling's sauce (sweet tomato). Alongside the pork I had mac n' cheese, hushpuppies, and the heavenly banana pudding - whipped to to the consistency of fluffy clouds, with a single wafer on top like the halo on a chubby little cherub.  The only reason my four star rating is not a five star rating is because when I entered the store this evening I was overcome by how hot it was. Initially I had planned on eating my meal in the store, but as I was becoming hot just standing there ordering - so I took my food to go.   Y'all are great, and I won't stop coming by - but for your customers and faithful employee's, get the AC fixed, please!!"}
{"text":"Just picked up a pulled pork sandwich plate here for dinner. It came with two sides, I got the mac n cheese and hush puppies. A solid choice. I seem to forget about this place, which sucks because it's exactly what I want when I'm tired of everything else. A small business with great food and greater staff. The price is extremely reasonable and man did I get more than enough pork for one sandwich. I could probably have made at least one if not two more sandwiches! Growing up in Charlotte, it's always nice to steer away from the bigger 'chain' BBQ places. And yes the hush puppies are wonderful here. The BBQ itself is just what I expect. It comes unflavored and you simply add the sauce of your choosing. Let me just say, \"I'm full!\""}
{"text":"Good, functional BBQ which slides to very good if you stick to what they do best.  First, I've only ever had takeout from this spot, as well as the original location in Stallings. Some BBQ joints just work better as take-out (not unlike some Asian places) and this is one of them. Also, buy in bulk and get everything else you need from the Teeter next door--buns,beans, etc.  Next, stick to the basics pork and slaw, although I've also had some really good brisket here. There is not the depth of smoky    flavor and bark of the very best BBQ but it is still nicely done and will scratch your cue itch. Also the slaw comes in red and white varieties which is an old Lexington thing you don't see everywhere. Basically the white is a creamy prep while the red is made with some of the vinegar based sauce. The latter results in a kinda a cross between a condiment and a side, and folks who do not like a lot of sauce with their cue seem to like to use it to give a little tang and crunch to the meat.  The rest of the sides, except maybe the Mac n cheese you can probably make better at home. But if you are doing take-out in bulk, that is not a problem."}
{"text":"Great BBQ.  Great lunch spot.  Service is very quick.  Great spot if your craving some awesome BBQ and in a hurry!"}
{"text":"This place has seen better days. Several minor cosmetic changes like wood panels rather than glass at the counter doesn't really add anything to the ambiance. But that wouldn't bother me if the food had remained as high quality as when they opened.   Bbq pork lacked flavor, no discernable smoke flavor, no spices - the new Bojangles pork bbq bests it. The potato wedges were not crispy and had a lack of flavoring in the coating. The \"banana pudding\" was a joke - vanilla pudding with one wafer on top and no banana slices or even flavor!  But that's not all, sadly the signature sauces also failed to live up to the past. The \"Eastern Carolina\" lacked heat and was merely poorly spiced vinegar.  The \"Stallings Secret\" was barely passable but easily bested by generic grocery store bbq sauces. The \"Carolina Gold\" was perhaps the most disappointing as it was nearly without flavor. This is my wife's favorite sauce as she grew up living Piggy Park bbq in Columbia.   All told, if you want BBQ and you are in Mint Hill, keep driving!"}
{"text":"Between this location and the original Rock Store off Monroe rd. You'll never be let down. Eating here takes me to a place as a kid when the family is all together at a pig pick'n. Its a very relaxed place to sit and enjoy your favorite southern BBQ foods. Great people, Amazing food, Cheap prices! Homemade desserts are the Bomb!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch to meet a friend during December.  It was so hot inside that we had to sit outside on the patio. (That was basically closed for the winter) other than the extreme heat inside the restaurant, the food was great!  I had a pulled pork BBQ sandwich with the spicy vinegar based sauce, side of macaroni and cheese, and hush puppies.  The macaroni and cheese tasted like it has four or so kinds of cheeses and was so cheesy I almost couldn't eat it.  Who knew something could have too much cheese?  I almost bought some of their spicy vinegar based sauce to take home with me it was so good.  The place was empty when I arrived at noon and full when I left around one o'clock.  The staff was very friendly.  I would love to eat here again but I was so turned off by the extreme heat inside. I had read complaints of the temperature of the restaurant in other reviews and thought it can't be that bad.  It was that bad. If I didn't live so far away, I would go there to pick up a to go order but it's 45 minutes away from me.   It's not the best pulled pork BBQ sandwich I've had but it was good! It was also a great price. It's inside the harris teeter shopping center right next to the grocery store."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre at best. The quality of the meat and all of the sides is what I would expect at a chain restaurant that doesn't specialize in BBQ, not at a restaurant that claims to be a BBQ joint. I really don't think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great BBQ and ribs that fall off the bone.  They have a nice variety of delicious sauces and some of the best cornbread ive ever had.   The place is very small but its well worth the wait."}
{"text":"The fried chicken breast was dry and overcooked  Potato wedges were undercooked  Honey mustard gold sauce was delicious  Hushpuppies were good  Mac n cheese was pretty good  You do get stuffed for $7 though"}
{"text":"Friendly guys behind the counter but that's where the good stuff ended.  Tried the pulled pork, but as a Charlotte native I've been spoiled by real BBQ and this wasn't it.  Their other offerings might be better but I won't be back to find out.  Noon on a  Friday and only two other customers in the place should have been a clue."}
{"text":"I really love brisket it's the best ever in the world, so I've been searching for a new bbq place since my favorite one closed down.  And I found rock store bbq, well I got the brisket with two sides and well let's just say I enjoyed the brownie I got for dessert more, I wasn't impressed but because I paid for it I ate it any way.  I didn't like how the sides where out in the open, although covered up but not in a heat source to keep them warm so that sucked, let's just say I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Prior to this experience, I had two experiences at the Rock Store.  One was at the actual rock store, out on Old Monroe Road.  When we showed up, they were closing the doors.  Not for good, just because they decided to do so.  They did not seem to be out of food, they just decided to close.  The other was at a food stand/truck.  There, the food was generally good, but it can be difficult to get a good idea of what things are like in that environment.  So we decided to try out their new(ish) location and see if we could actually get some food in the restaurant-like setting.  For starters, it just does not have the atmosphere of the rock store.  The strip mall does not carry quite the same level of interest.  That is to be expected.  Luckily, it is carried off by the fact that the staff goes above and beyond to help you decide on your dishes.  Huge props to them for their friendliness.  When it comes to the food, I still find that they fall a little bit short.  While the meat is good, and generally tender, it is just lacking in flavor, and comes out a little dry.  The Rock Store does offer several varieties of sauce, and all are decent.  But without any sauce, the meat itself is just lacking, and there are better options in town.  Definitely check them out if you just want some company, though.  In that regard, they are tough to beat."}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ!! The best around Charlotte!! We always compare BBQ to this place when we try a different place and nobody is as delicious as this restaurant!! (Jim N Nicks might be close, but it's a different type of restaurant)"}
{"text":"A neat little spot next to Lowe's Food in Mint Hill.  Now, I'm not connoisseur of barbeque by any stretch of the imagination, but this stuff was pretty darn good. Pulled pork and chicken, a range of sauces from tangy Carolina vinegar to sweet mustard-based, lots of sides that the staff are eager to recommend and help you choose from.  It has its opportunities, I'll give them that, but for inexpensive, fast, and close by, not too bad.  Kinda dull on the inside (it's a strip mall, though, so there's few things to do), but the great staff make it worth visiting.  When I'm looking to break the routine for a quick meal, Mint Hill Rock Store does the trick"}
{"text":"How disappointing. Here we are in North Carolina and we have a restaurant selling rewarmed barbecue that is prepared in advance at a different location then shipped and and reheated. Ugg. No thanks."}
{"text":"I got the pork BBQ plate with mac and cheese and baked beans. Overall, it was OK. It's not the best BBQ that I've ever had. The gentleman working there was very nice. Also tried the Cheerwine cake. Not too bad."}
{"text":"The BBQ in this little strip mall joint decidedly does NOT rock.  I've never been to the original Rock Store but I've heard good things.  I had some time to kill between photography jobs in Mint Hill, it was lunch time, and I was in the parking lot, so I decided to grab some good old NC style BBQ pork.  I should have realized that any place with all that traffic outside and a jam packed parking lot at high noon that only had three customers inside may have problems.  I had the pulled pork sandwich and potato wedges.  The pork was dry and without sauce or flavor, slapped on a cold bun.  I was offered several sauces and chose the spicy, which was OK but too sweet and not very spicy.  I was horrified to see that when I ordered fries the lady behind the counter pulled open a warming oven and pulled out a pan filled with a giant pile of precooked wedges being kept warm.  There were enough wedges in that pan to feed everybody in the parking lot.  She grabbed a handful off of the top of the huge pile and put them in a cardboard boat.  You can about imagine how they were.  Flavor, not bad but texture, soggy, limp and old.  Another Charlotte area BBQ joint bites the dust. Too bad."}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time today. I ordered the brisket plate with mac and cheese and potato wedges. My wife ordered the bbq plate with white slaw and mac and cheese.  The brisket was very tender... however, the flavor was severely lacking. They have several different bbq sauces to add to your meal but you shouldn't depend on sauce to flavor your meat. The mac and cheese tasted a bit bland but the potato wedges were good.   My wife liked the pork bbq but absolutely hated the mac and cheese and white slaw. Although the staff was nice,  I don't think I'll visit again."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I used to love this place a few years ago. Every time I would come home from college my mum and I would stop in for a quick bite, can't beat a sandwich combo for $6! I was a huge fan like seriously, the customer service was great and the food was on point.   I stopped in today for a bite to eat and while the customer service was great the food was lackluster to say the least. The BBQ wasn't really pulled well or smoked well. The bun was cold actually ended up just eating the bbq and the side. Not sure what has happened over the past few years, but please step it up. Y'all used to have some of the best bbq in the area!"}
{"text":"This is one of those places that I couldn't remember if I had already reviewed or not my review seemingly as memorable as the food. I would have given them a half star (2 1/2 stars total if I could) .  I think my Dad, who was a BBQ aficionado said it best when he tasted their ribs... \"I've had  worse\"   I used to come here 1 or 2 times a month, not a great customer to be sure, but better than most I suppose. Never had a problem with the service from the kids behind the counter.   While the ribs are ok, to be fair, the cornbread and banana pudding are very good.  I say \"used to come here\" because I won't be back.    They recently expanded their menu, which was well needed, and included fried chicken.  I LOVE fried chicken(Can you say Price's Chicken Coop?!?! )  so I was very excited.  I tried some of their chicken last week, and was a little disappointed.  It was crispy and had a good flavor, but it tasted like it had been hanging around a long time, and again, to be fair I was in there fairly late.    I decided to give them another chance, went in at a more reasonable dinner time around 6 PM.  I ordered the 2 piece dark meat dinner that comes with two sides. I asked the  young lady if I could get two thighs instead of a leg and a thigh, and she looked absolutely flummoxed. Could I possibly be the only person in Mint Hill to ask this question?  She told me she would have to check, then goes and  confers with another kid behind the counter and collectively they deliver their verdict.. NO!  What? Seriously? How about you charge me extra? \"NO..we can't..because...(wait for it) \"if we do that we would have more legs than thighs.\" Unbelievable.   I guess I am glad that business is doing so well for them they can say NO customers on something so silly.  She then asks me which two sides I wanted.  Images of corn bread and banana pudding flashed by my miffed mind, and I could hear the voice of  my dear, departed, mother in my ears...\"So, what are you going to do son?  Cut your nose off to spite your face?\"  Why yes, as a mater of fact I am. i said no thanks, no sides, no chicken and walked out.  And that would have probably been the end of it, and I wouldn't be whining in this review but noooooooo.  Just as  I hit the door I hear that young lady say to me, in the most smarmy voice....\"Have a nice day!\"  You know the voice,, the one that tries to make you look like an a**hole when you say \"She told me to have a nice day!\" Smarmy, syrupy, just oozing with insincerity.  It was totally uncalled for as I was not the least bit dick-ish to her.  So, long review short..ribs mediocre, chicken mediocre, sides mediocre (Except the cornbread and banana pudding :-) 1 douche behind the counter    2 1/2   stars"}
