{"text":"Pizza never fuly cooked and dough is raw.   Problem would be solved if they turn down the oven heat and left pizza in it to bake a bit longer. I've had their pizza on 4 different occasions and everytime the pizza near the crust is mostly cooked while near the tip is mostly raw dough. I took a few photos of the area of pizza between the crust and the middle of the pizza to show the dough.  Also pizza is left sitting around for a while so it ends up dry."}
{"text":"One of my favourite options for fast lunch downtown!    Their lasagna is delicious and a huge portion.  The chicken parmigiana sandwich is also huge and tasty, and while I've never tried the veal, I can tell from watching others order that it's a huge hit as well.  If the servings seem too big, ask for a \"small\" pasta, which is about a soup-bowl size (which in my opinion is ample), and is only a few dollars.  You can take a roll or slice of fresh bread to eat with it for no extra cost.  The pizza is among the better fast-food/takeout pizza options in the city - delicious.  A tip: if you are ordering a slice and a side salad, they will ask you if you want a drink -- take one, you're paying for it whether you ask for it or not, as the slice & salad are priced as a combo with a drink.  Take it away, or eat it there.  There are lots of seats, and a few screens showing sporting events and News channels."}
{"text":"This Italian sandwich/pasta/pizza place is good, the prices are roughly 10 dollars per average meal.. The owner is friendly, and the veal sandwich is good! I've come here multiple times and never been disappointed. It's not necessary the best Italian food I've had from a place like this, but give it a try!"}
{"text":"the only reason this place is busy is the lack of better options in the area. i really hate places that thrive in this type of situation. best of the worst doesnt get a restaurant anymore than the 1 star i'm giving.  although +0.5 stars for the guy who runs the cash register. you know him. he's the hairy dude, with a sabertooth necklace, and long curly locks. work friends and i called him tarzan. hence the nickname for this place become tarzan's.... for example: \"hey do you want to grab some lunch from tarzan's?\""}
{"text":"My husband's favorite lunch place. He had his lunch there everyday for the past two weeks. I tasted pasta once. Really good!"}
{"text":"So I placed an order through the Ritual app as I work upstairs in the offices. The app indicated my order was ready and I should head down. Lo and behold, my order was not ready. In fact I had to wait an extra 5 minutes for my order. Food wasn't \"great\" either. Not coming back, that's a given."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with friends. This location is situated at Brookfield Place, and it has a large food court at the concourse level. I usually purchase my food and eat in the food court as the lighting and ventilation is better.   Food wise, I got a few slices of pizza and they are the thin crust type, which I prefer. Sometimes I will grab their sandwiches as they are very well made. I have yet tried the pasta. Cause if I had their pasta, chances are I will be having a nice nap after lunch. So not a good idea if I am back in the office.   Staff are great, they got good attitude. Will come back more often."}
{"text":"More like 2.5 stars, but for what it is (somewhat cafeteria like) and the nice people, I'll round to 3.  Located in the same building as Starbucks and Tim Hortons, this is kind of a last-minute, can't decide what I want for lunch type places.  They have some decent sandwiches, pasta, sausages and a tolerable (though pricey) pizza. If you get pasta or sandwich with a drink and salad, it will most likely to come to around $10.   My recommendations from this place: Panini (the one with a lot of deli in it, forget the name), salad and sausage.  My avoid: Pizza - not a fan. sorry."}
{"text":"A good spot for lunch. Better than typical food-court italian food, with far friendlier staff, and a wide selection of foods from Pizza, Pasta, Panini Sandwiches, and Veal/Chicken Parmigiano. The prices are slightly higher than a food court italian place, but the food taste, quality and decor (real plates and cutley if dining in). makes it worth paying the extra money."}
{"text":"This place has been going down-hill since the change of ownership.  Agree with Jason - it only gets clientele because of location. Instead of appreciating its local clientele, you're usually met with semi-rude/attitude service.  Bars nearby like Miller Tavern / Fox will definately put this place out of business eventually."}
{"text":"This place is incredibly over priced, the food is very bland and generic, only in north York would a food court equivalent dare to charge 12 bucks for 2 pieces of bread and 100g of meat and sauce, reheated..."}
{"text":"I'd seen people at my work eating tasty looking veal sandwiches pretty often, and finally subsided to by baby-cow eating urges and went for a sandwich. Disappointment came shortly after.   I bought my sandwich, selected its toppings, paid approximately $8.50 after tax and carried it back 5 minutes to my office to dig in. At first glance, it looked pretty good. 1 big piece of veal fitting the entire bun, sauce applied liberally along with some nice green peppers. But I've gotta say, the taste just didn't impress me. It was pretty bland and very forgettable in the world of veal sandwiches.  And that all said, I'll take responsibility for the fact I forgot to ask for hot sauce, but the real deal breaking issue for me was its temperature, not the spice or flavour. The sandwich was lukewarm at best. I mean when I buy lunch at 12:10 and am eating within a few minutes I would've assumed that I shouldn't need to reheat it since I don't reheat any of the food I buy in the neighbourhood.   This area may be short on variety for lunch options, but I'm really not feeling this place and doubt I'll ever be returning."}
{"text":"I really really really enjoy Piazza Manna as a lunch spot in the downtown core. I like to go when their pizzas are freshly made and usually get the pepperoni as I find the other slices are seen as \"deluxe\" and more expensive than just the regular pepperoni. The young lady in the cash that usually works during lunch is a little rude as I have had times where she makes me open the bag with my pizza inside to make sure i'm not lying when I say I have a pepperoni slice. I get she has to do her job however, there are more polite ways to ask guests.   They do have a little sit down area which is awesome considering finding a table in the food court can be disastrous during the lunch hours. I also do enjoy their pizza, the little pepperoni's are great and I find the pizza to be thin, crunchy and have just the right amount of cheese to sauce ratio. I have tried their pasta as well however it was very below average and I did not enjoy it.   This place however is a little hidden and can be missed if you are coming from union station and happen to pass by all the other options before getting to them. If you are looking for a pizza spot and are okay with spending $5.75 for a bit of a small slice and pop go for it or you can get two slices and a pop for $10.11 with tax included.   I would give this place a 5/5 had their slices been a little even and bigger and their work staff a little friendlier! However, I will give the gentleman that usually goes around the tables to clean with a big scruffy beard a 5/5 for being very kind!"}
{"text":"Panini was cold and bland. Pizza sits around for awhile so it also tends to not be warm enough and also ends up being a bit dry. Some of the employees look like they don't care about their jobs. Also, this place is pretty overpriced given the quality of food. The pizza isn't much better than say Pizza Pizza but yet for two slices and a pop you are paying a few dollars more here.  If you want a panini, go to the Fast Fresh Food at Commerce Court or even Pumpernickels just a few units down. For pizza, if you can make the trek, the Longo's at First Canadian Place will make you an entire personal sized pizza form scratch if you've got the time to wait for it (there's also the Longo's underneath the Maple Leaf Square, which is a bit further). The pizzas from there are so much better. Heck, even the Marche's across from here used to make better pizzas, but they for whatever reason no longer offer that option."}
{"text":"Choices of fresh focaccia sandwiches, pizza, salads and hot food counter which change daily. You really do get good quality to price ratio here. If you get the chance try their Kale beet salad with candied nuts and goat cheese - if there's any left - and again made daily.  They also have a bar for after work with some local beers on tap.   I come here easily 3 times a week for a couple months now  today's meal Pesto chicken sandwich, small Cobb salad, Coke total damage $14.41"}
{"text":"Don't let the non descrip office building vibe send you away. The pizza here is the best in this harbourfront area near the Westin. Best value, best taste. Plus you can enjoy the bar adjacent to the patio area for cocktails and pizza. Decent salads as well as Mouton Cadet Wines poured by the glass-hooray!"}
{"text":"They are getting better - but it is the winter - so the smoking has been minimal.  I really hope that come the summer, they don't start that habit again.  The food is yummy, it's better then it was last year, but it's still over priced.  Their breakfast leave something to be desired, but it's good in a pinch if you're sick of getting Timmy's.  The staff make up for it - they are friendly and they are always wiling to go the extra mile.  They do have a \"bar\" at the other end, but I NEVER see anyone in it.  They aren't open late - by the time I leave work, they are closed....I leave at 6pm."}
{"text":"Went there awhile ago for a slice of pizza. Was waiting to order a slice of pizza. Workers were talking by the cash, looked over and continued talking. So I left and will never go back. Wish I could choose zero."}
