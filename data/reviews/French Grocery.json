{"text":"The best cinnamon rolls ever also great selection of wine and beer. I go here at least 2 -3 times a week for coffee and pastries and the occasional 6 pack of my favorite beer .i love this place Thank you Erin & husband for opening a great place in central Phoenix. ."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Seriously.  Everyone has always been nice and helpful each time I've gone in.  If you want a history of wine, ask for Kevin..and bring a pad of paper with a pen.  He knows EVERYTHING!  

Go in for some wine, some cheese, coffee/tea or a yummy pastry and leave happy!  :-)"}
{"text":"This is a wonderful little grocery! I had a French dip sandwich and it was amazing! The bread was fresh and moist! The meat was super tender and filled with delicious flavors! After the sandwich I could not resist trying some of their crembrule and it was FANTASTIC!!! It was nice and creamy but not to sweet. And the staff was very courteous and friendly."}
{"text":"The staff was  very rude, and not at all helpful. The quiche was awful.
They would not even get my daughter a cup and she was holding an infant or me a napkin.
I've traveled around the globe, I don't know how they stay in business."}
{"text":"Horrible experience with a rude staff and poor excuses. Ordered a few sandwiches and a salad while the restaurant was less than full. The food arrived 45 minutes later with cold eggs. When the food was returned we were met with excuses of \"we were just on tv\" and \"we only have one cook.\"  The second sandwich came out shortly after as being nothing special. The rest of the sandwiches were about the same level of quality. Seeing that we were obviously upset, the server staff was much less than friendly or apologetic. I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I have not one thing bad to say when it comes to their food. 

The first time I visited, I just ordered a French press and some beignets. Got the order of beignets first and after I had finished eating them, I noticed I had not gotten my French press. I proceeded to the counter and asked for one, and the girl behind the counter said I will bring it right out. Then, after waiting about 10 minutes and no coffee, I went back to the counter and again asked for the French press. The girl was responsive, and gave it to me in a togo cup since I did not want to wait any longer. Nothing wrong with a little slow service. 

Now, my real reason for giving this place a 3 star is the service for the second time I visited. I had looked online and saw that they had dinner options and proceeded to the store. Everything went perfect, besides the usual delay in food, roughly about 30 minutes ,but the server was nice enough to bring out some fries at no charge. After we got the good and finished eating. I went up to go look at some dessert items they usually have upfront. Our server was at the cash register so I also told him that I wanted to pay the bill for my food. He told me that he usually likes to bring the check out to the table, but can cash us out there. After I got the bill, about $31, I made the total $35, signed it and left the store. When I got to the parking lot, our server came out of the store and yelled across the parking lot staying, \"I am not going to include the tip in your total,  it's okay, I know I gave you guys bad service.\" And when I said no please add the tip in the total, he rudely replied, \" No Thanks!\" And walked inside. 

I found this rude and unprofessional, chasing down customers in the parking lot. A tip is something that is not required, but is given for exceptional service. While the service was good, it was not the best service. So I gave a small tip, but I guess it's not good enough these days and people expect a generous tip regardless of the type of service provided."}
{"text":"Came in during dinner and had the Steak and Frites. It was one of the better restaurant steaks I have had in a while. It was little more rare than I expected, so when I go back I will order it a little more cooked than I normally get.

The frites were a mix of regular and sweet potato fries. I don't normally like sweet potato fries, but the mix of the two were really enjoyable."}
{"text":"Oh la la!  Did you try the Pots de Creme??  (And please 'o please tell me you read that 'po' and not PoTs....oh so American if you pronounce that 'T'...or so I've been told).  But basically the P.O.C. is the size of your face and you want to sit down and eat the WHOLE thing in a single sitting, which is also 'oh so American' but not 'oh so good for the waistline.  

I ordered two sandwiches here and a pots de creme (two because I had a meal buddy, not because I'm that much of a glutton...but I sometimes can be).  Oh goodness.  The sandwiches (Croque Monsieur and the Cochon Melt) were Fabulous.  Also, not low calorie, but this is classic French Cuisine, not lean cuisine.  All was amazing.  Did I mention the Pots de Creme????  I will never share again."}
{"text":"this has got to be the best roast beef sandwich in the valley  fantastic horseradish dressing and good value"}
{"text":"Vomit. Seriously. We just moved into the neighborhood 5 months ago. The weather is finally nice and so husband thought it would be lovely to walk to breakfast to a French restaurant, so we tried this place. We arrived at about 10:30. They were out of QUICHE. \"It's been busy.\" we were told. Be prepared for business! 

We ordered 2 croissants and 4 strips of bacon and it took 25 minutes. We watched 2 others who arrived after us get their food before us. My husband is much more patient than I. Look at  the photo of his food. Disgusting. Trained chefs, including myself who went through culinary school feel free to weigh in.This egg is old, the bottom of the pan, not fresh. Disgusting. 

We ate our food because we were starving after 25 minutes then immediately went next door to grab some fresh tacos. Mucho Mucho place"}
{"text":"I've been a couple times and I love the concept but the execution still needs work. The beignets are amazing but they forgot to put the order in and I waited almost 25 minutes for them... It seems weird that no one asked what I was waiting for. I will go back again because everything I've tried is good and hopefully their service and hospitality will improve."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try the French Grocery for a while now. Finally checked it out a few weekends ago and have been back three times since. The pot roast sandwich with a side of pomme frites is incredible and made for a great post Halloween hangover cure. The croissants are easily the best I've had and all of the sweets that I've tried have been perfect also."}
{"text":"Haven't come for wine or dinner yet but I stop by for a cappuccino and a pastry every once in a while! All the baked goods I've tried are great and the staff is very nice. Sometimes are a tad slow but always make up for it with great service and sometimes adding in a complimentary treat!"}
{"text":"The food here is delicious but the service is always poor. We always end up the same waiter. He doesn't acknowledge you waiting to be seated (the sign says to wait) so we go to the counter to place the order. We give him the order and he says,\"  Oh its for here, I will take your order at the table\". I am already here, just take  my order or come promptly. Wait again at table, waiter never says his name, which I presume is because of his horrible customer service. I enjoy the food but dread the service. I won't be inviting my friends to join me here, ever."}
{"text":"Food and staff are wonderful...I would highly recommend this to anyone for a cozy breakfast with your better half."}
{"text":"Poor customer service, I went in asking questions the place is a bit bare. I wasn't sure what services they provided. It says grocery store I was expecting more options not like the clerk stated no we are not a regular grocery store we don't carry carrots lol I am not looking for carrots. However was expecting more French items. They have a large selection of imported wine. There were tables I saw a girl eating something good. YET nothing was really explained the place is rather bare. 
I shop at the Italian store and they have many items from Italy. 
However their French desserts were fantastic. Went with a mango custard."}
{"text":"Even after you take into consideration that this restaurant/grocery/bakery/pastry shop started life as a convenience store, the decor still feels sad, drab and uncomfortable.  My lunch, a slice of Quiche Loraine and the world's most over dressed and vinegary side salad, was deeply...ordinary.  The macaron I had for dessert, however, was lovely.  For the prince, I'd rather eat at IHOP where the food is better, the atmosphere is cheery, the seats are comfortable and I don't have to stand in line to get my order taken."}
{"text":"I was so excited to finally make it over to French Grocery in an effort to quell my homesickness. Unfortunately we were pretty disappointed. Of course it was early in the day but they didn't have any take home entrees ready. The beignets were expensive, small, too thick and burnt.  Maybe they were having an off day and I'll try again some other time. We went home and made gumbo."}
{"text":"Unhappy employees, chef was a jerk, server didn't communicate to us that our food would take almost an hour to come out, we kept asking what the status was and they kept saying 5 more minutes. Don't come here hungry. Another customer had to wait 45minutes to get 3 fresh beignets and the staff didn't communicate with her either. The place is hot and stuffy and all the employees look unorganized and unhappy. I saw an employee go from helping a customer at the register to cutting cheese without washing hands or sanitizing. BEWARE! It's unfortunate that the grace and kindness from actual French people doesn't exist here, looks like all the employees are locals who work in the kitchen without an apron or hairnet, how about food safety concerns??!!! Get it together French Grocery!"}
{"text":"Arrived at 2pm to eat and try for first time. Cashier said no food avail til dinner at 5pm. So my friend and I tried an almond croissant. It was the tiniest croissant I have ever seen and it was $3.50. AJ's are$2.50 and huge! Unless u r a wine drinker...there is nothing going on here. No pics on the wallI, nothing. It was a disappointment for sure!"}
{"text":"Was brought here by friends the first time and I'm so glad they did. The coffee was excellent and the beignets, well, just read the reviews. Wow. The folks working there were pleasant and the inside is comfortable. As some have said parking could be an issue, but so far so good. I don't even live super close and I have gone out of my way to go back. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So glad there is a new fantastic place in my neighborhood to frequent. Fantastic service, lovely people, delicious things to linger over in the shop or take home, I am so pleased such a place exists! Far more charm/personality and life than across the street at Starbucks...

Brought a friend for lunch and she loved it as well. Also, the BEST baguettes for miles ;) Will 100% be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"This place rocks for many reasons. The macaroons are so, so good and the espresso is perfection. It is the most well balanced espresso I've ever had! Thankfully this little shop is on my route to work. I'll gladly be supporting their local business often by purchasing coffee and treats on the regular!"}
{"text":"I love, love the French Grocery!
It is one of my favorite places to go with friends and family. I always recommend it to everyone: French press, beignets, cheese plate, soup, burger, wine!

However, their service is not always the best. I've had friends who refused to go back because of it... 
I love the food so much I've learned to take it for what it is and enjoy the food. It is due to Theo service that I do not give them 5 stars, but in General they're awesome!!!"}
{"text":"My first time here for breakfast was good, but my second time, not so much. I like the idea of this place, but it's just not what it could be.

When we first came a few weeks after they opened, they were out of a lot of things, so we got the beignets and pecan maple bacon and a cinnamon roll. The beignets came out piping hot and were great. Bacon was freshly made and came out hot and was amazing. Once it cooled down, it wasn't very good though. The roll was great too and had some almond flavor to it.

We went here today and ordered a chocolate croissant, spinach and cheese croissant and cinnamon roll. And two lattes. We were almost done eating by the time we got our coffee. Also, I can get better croissants from Starbucks. Very disappointing to eat dry crunchy croissants. The spinach and cheese croissant was cold - something I would expect to be hot. And the roll was just okay this time around. Also, noticed the bacon was just sitting out this time so we didn't want to get that knowing it wouldn't be hot.

Not sure I'll be coming back here again."}
{"text":"This is such an amazing little place. The french press coffee, the freshly baked pastries and the beer and wine selection make it a must stop for us."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would cuz this place doesn't even deserve 1 star. Was in today and saw the customer service. Absolutely terrible. A customer in front of me got yelled at by a staff member for no reason. Never going back. French grocery that's unprofessional and never the way to treat a customer!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Friendly staff too. Somewhat expensive but definitely a different experience."}
{"text":"About 2 months ago they started serving dinner so if you have been here before and weren't impressed definitely go back! They have really come around. Their Beef Bourguignon is on par with the Beef Bourguignon I had in the South of France. The Crab Canapé is to die for. They have an expansive wine collection, all at super affordable pricing. I got a bottle for $13! Little tip: If you drink the wine there, there is a $10 corking fee. Ultimately, if you haven't gone, GO! If you have gone and didn't like it, try again, they've really changed, for the better!"}
{"text":"So impressed! I was looking for macaroons so I stopped by French Grocery last week.  To my delight, they had three different flavors, all equally delicious.  I especially like the \"Chocolate Chile.\" It's got moxie.  The staff was super nice and the owner was even there to welcome customers.  I love that the menu includes both Continental and Creole items.  I little more Paris and New Orleans in Phoenix makes everything better."}
{"text":"Been here three times now and it just keeps being scrumptious.

Tried and would try again:  
Eclairs 
Salted Caramel Macaroon
Chicken Curry Soup
French Onion Soup
Gumbo Andouille
Grilled Cheese with French Onions
Ham Croque-Monsieur
Latte

Highly recommended stop for amazing desserts, espresso, not to mention the tasty soups and sandwiches.  Plus the decor is industrial chic with plenty of tables and the staff extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Me and my faithful bestie Ray hit up French Grocery for the 1st time for lunch today, being as we both love anything French! The place itself is very clean with a good amount of tables to sit at. I liked the different Wines they sold, it made me want to buy a bottle and drink some, but it was lunch and we had to get back to work. We went to the counter to order and  the guy behind the counter was nice but for our 1st time there I wish he would of been a bit more friendly and helpful, he did answer all my questions but I just thought he would of been a bit more friendly. We both ordered the speical  which was the Mozz, tomato, pesto sandwich and side of potato leek soup. It was all very good, a bit pricey but very fresh and good. I do have one suggestion, I do wish they sold more made to order food. The only sandwiches available that were made to order were ours and a grilled cheese with french onion. All other sandwiches were premade and put in their case, which was very odd to me. I think they would do better with more fresh made to order things. The bakery items looked delish, but they were out of a lot of things. I did take a Chocolate Chili Macaroon back to my office which I LOVED! I have never had one before! Very good suggestion made by the guy behind the counter.  All in all it was a good experience and I will be back! I do want to stop in before work to try the coffee and pick up a sweet!"}
{"text":"I recently discovered French Grocery on Yelp and couldn't wait to visit. I have been there several times in the past two weeks. In a word, fantastic! It just really doesn't get any better than this.  

The owner Kevin is an experienced and talented chef from New Orleans. His passion for Creole cuisine is apparent. He seems happiest when spending time talking to his customers about the food he and his team are creating. 

Today for lunch I had a shrimp salad. It was very simple. Spinach leaves, red bell pepper, corn, boiled shrimp and vinaigrette. What made this salad different than any other with the same ingredients is the care taken to get it right. It was love on a plate. The spinach was properly washed and dried. The corn was a tasty and colorful addition. The best part were the shrimp. Four lovely shrimp that were cooked to perfection and seasoned in a way that made me very happy! These were not common boiled shrimp. They were poached in a liquid that brought a lot of flavor. There was a sweet spice present that I am still thinking about and craving. Maybe allspice or nutmeg. They were delicious!

Kevin is creating take home meals, many with Creole flavors. French onion soup, red beans and rice, English pea and mint soup. It goes on and on. 

I can't wait to see what French Grocery brings in the future. 

Bienvenue a Arizona French Grocery! Thank you for being here and bringing to our community some Creole goodness.

I look forward to spending many happy hours in your French Grocery."}
{"text":"We had been looking for a great local coffee place. This is it ! They serve coffee in real cups too !"}
{"text":"Yum. I can barely wait for Tuesday morning when they open for the week (I have driven there on a Monday many times when they were not open, ha). They have the most delicious breakfast sandwiches, that are worth the wait. The croissants are the best I have had in Arizona and will keep going back for those alone!"}
{"text":"Amazing!  My daughter and I went on Saturday for beignets, which were made to order and super tasty. Even better, we purchased some lemon, espresso and peach macaroons for later and those were so delicious!
Obviously still gearing up (empty cases) but looking forward to the grand opening on July 9th.  What a wonderful shop for the downtown area!
My only complaint is that there is not sufficient parking - this place will be super popular and there are only a few spots."}
{"text":"Love their cooked food and kind service. It's a great neighborhood restaurant. Very relaxed and low key. Best wines I've seen in downtown Phoenix with an emphasis on French and Italian, think Kermit Lynch and natural wine selections. Good price range for all budgets. Had a delicious bottle of growers sparkling wine yesterday on their recommendation for something happy and cheerful. Their tomato soup du jour was delicious. They also have a great selection of cheeses to go with their French bread. They have baguettes and batards baked fresh daily on the premises. In short, French Grocery has hit its stride and each time I visit I leave happy."}
{"text":"Great pastries but was hoping for more \"french food\" options, a sandwich, a crepe......something.  Did i mention the pastries were great!"}
{"text":"I wish Yelp would let you rate 0 stars.

Arrived at French Grocery with another couple at 5:30 ish on a Saturday evening.  Walked in to a sign that said please wait to be seated -- so we waited... and waited...for anyone...anyone to acknowledge that we came into the building.  As we were waiting, and waiting, I looked up to the left at the counter to see a large chalkboard with large writing that said \"ORDER HERE\" with an arrow, but in front of me there was a sign that said desserts and coffee order at the counter, but since no one was acknowledging us I was second guessing my nature to follow rules.

We finally sent an emissary up to the counter to find out what was going on, and the guys went to the wine retail area to start picking something to drink with dinner -- btw, a very nice French and Italian heavy selection.  Our emissary asked if we could get a table for 4, the restaurant server/manager (?) asked if we had made a reservation, our emissary reminded the server that they did not allow reservations for parties of less than 5, to which they replied - Oh, yeah I guess we did start doing that. 

So, back to the door to wait.  Meanwhile, a table for 2 opened up so the 2 of our party sat at the table.  And sat, and sat, and sat.  Finally after about 20 minutes of waiting for acknowledgement, and after we had picked a bottle of wine for dinner, our emissary went back to the counter and asked if we could move a table around to make of 4.  We were told no, the manager further told us that people liked to come here to sit for 3 or 4 hours and that it would be awhile before we got a table.  He further told us that even after we got a table, it would be at least 1:45 minutes before we would receive our dinner.  He topped everything by telling us that we should just leave.

I've never been asked to just leave a restaurant.

Slightly in shock, and not wanting to wait several hours for dinner, we left, and went to another locally owned restaurant that is interested in having customers.

We debated all through dinner whether or not we should give French Grocery another try, and we decided that if it had just been an issue of waiting we would go back.  However, due to the attitude of the people that worked there, and being basically ignored for the 45 minutes we were there, that this establishment really isn't interested in having customers and that we would not give it another try.

From the reviews I have read, it appears that the food is good, however, I echo many of the other reviews -- be ready for rude or inattentive service.  There are many locally owned restaurants in Phoenix that value customers -- please spend lots of money at those restaurants."}
{"text":"We've been back twice since our initial visit, and it's still good! 

During the week, we had beignets (piping hot, good flavor, and definitely cooked in clean oil - always a plus!), a cinnamon roll (had a hint of nutmeg or something that I wasn't really a fan of), a quiche lorraine (so good! pastry was excellent), and a ham and cheese croissant (also very good). 

Today (Saturday) we just HAD to get more of the praline bacon that we had last week... mmmmm, meat candy! We also got a duck sandwich on a batard roll (a bit pricey at $13.95, but excellent - heavy on the duck, with flavored goat cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, and a port reduction), and a quiche lorraine and an almond croissant to save for tomorrow's breakfast, since they aren't open on Sundays. 

We're about to move across the country, and I'm really sad to be leaving this awesome eatery behind!"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited to try this place out.  I saw on yelp that they had beignets and well...I drove right over!  Haven't had a fresh beignet since I was in New Orleans few years ago.  They were absolutely delish...really, enough for 2/3 people...but I still ate all three.  Very nice, laid back place and I will be returning."}
{"text":"I just moved back to Phoenix and am now in the neighborhood - what a sweet find! They had way more (non-cow dairy) cheeses than I'd realized and fresh breads baked on location, a cafe and omg the wine! The gentleman who helped me was super nice and walked me through all the cheese options, of which I bought a couple because hello I can eat almost everything in this place (!) Prices are about what you'd expect for these lovely cheeses. The cafe menu looked very reasonable - can't wait to try it out.
I'm reserving a star only because he told me in February they'll be licensed to *serve wine and when that happens I'm all over it! 
Hooray for Another fantastic spot in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"It is a little pricey, but love this place! Very good pastries, cakes, etc. It is a grocery store, but it has its nice ambiance."}
{"text":"Have to agree with mrs G. Went there for lunch took almost an hour to receive our food to go. I was third in line, ordered sat down to wait. Several groups that came in and ordered in received there meal. ? How long does it take for a \"roast beef au jus & the uptowner\" turkey on a croissant. Save yourself a half hr. Skip the au jus. The staff are pleasant and the place is pleasant. But it's a time suck. Will not go back."}
{"text":"Come here for dinner. Fantastic local gem. French with a New Orleans twist. Have had many dishes from the mains to the small plates. Not sure I have a  favorite. Great wines by the glass for super affordable prices also great bottles if you want. Having one of those tonight with the steak tartar and sweet breads also the grilled Caesar with artichokes.  The truffle burger is to die for. Oh and the mussels."}
{"text":"Good food but easily the slowest service I've experienced in Phoenix. Stood in line for 25 mins to order (only 6 people in front of us when we got there) and waited another 15 mins for pastries and coffee. 

Go for dinner when they have a wait staff. It's still slow but at least you're not standing in line."}
{"text":"We decided to try French Grocery to see if they KNOW New Orleans cuisine ... Sorta.  It's good! Don't get me wrong... But dark brown beignets is not what you'd ever see on the French Quarter streets.  We both got Shrimp Po'boys and I have to say, it's the first one I've had here that I would order again, but it is FAR from Naw'lins. For some reason, restaurants here in the valley have no luck finding French Bread!  Po'boy bread is crusty and airy..  Why is that so hard to find???"}
{"text":"I was very excited to find this place on yelp and I immediately grabbed hubby to lunch there.  Both hubby were very happy to know the food is more of a Louisiana French, as we both enjoyed the food in New Orleans very much.  I ordered a BBQ Shirmp Po'boy and hubby had the Cochon Melt, and of course, we got the beignets as dessert.  The cochon melt was pretty good, but the po'boy is...a bit of a let-down.  Well, at least we ended it on a high note:  the beignets.  I don't know what it is about a freshly deep fried dough covered in powder sugar...  I should've just gotten the beignets and coffee.  

Right before we left, I saw the dinner special on their board: Fried Soft-shell Crabs, Smoked Corn Grits & Maque Choux.  Yes, it's $24, but it's soft-shell crab and it's a dinner portion.  It'd be worth it.  We came back for it the same day, and had a mixed feeling....  While the crabs are fresh and crispy - perfect in every way and the grits and maque choux are also excellent, the portion size is more like an appetizer...  Was it supposed to be an appetizer?  No...it's not under the Les Hors d'Oeuvres...  I mean I didn't expect the soft-shell crabs to be more, but com'on, who would've thought they can be so stingy with grits?  There was so little grits that it looked like the fancy sauce they \"brush\" on the plate (like what you see in \"Chop\"). 

We also got the chocolate croissant and mango panna cotta; both were not bad but I've had better elsewhere.

I thought about going back for the Shrimp Étouffée, but I think I'll wait a while.  There are many other good places in Phoenix I want to try."}
{"text":"Bought some pastries for an office. It's a nice place to grab something small and relax. Had a french press with an almond pastry. I didn't really look at the wine selection, but they have a lot to choose from. Baguettes look really good. Almost bought one to eat, but didn't want to finish an entire loaf by myself. Took a lot of self control not to."}
{"text":"Everything is simply amazing. I would recommend this quant establishment to anyone in the area. I'm obsessed with the beignets! They take special requests on sweets. Great cheese selection, wine selection, and beer selection. They have cute gift ideas as well! Come for breakfast, lunch, or dinner and you are sure to leave full and with a smile on your face."}
{"text":"I've tried to like this place. No matter how many times given it a chance the service is always non existent. Today I was going to dinner at a friends house who is a wine fan who lived in France. I know absolutely nothing about wine, I figured this was a perfect opportunity to get some direction. Not a single person spoke to me, even though there were only two other customers and about 6 employees including who seemed to me to be an owner. (Since you state there are never 6, here are the 5, a girl who rang me up, one guy talking to the two customers, two cooks and one blond bearded man talking to the two cooks. Sorry I was off by one person!). I resorted to looking up information on my phone. I stood for 20min ( not an exaggeration, I timed it) looking at labels till I found an wine that worked. I see no reason to ever go here again. Why make the effort if they don't. Truly disappointing."}
{"text":"Had a reservation that they would not honor. Told us that they could not accommodate us and we're just rude. Would not ever think of going back there. Way too many other places that I can spend my money."}
{"text":"I really hoped to find food here that I really missed from home. I'm kind of disappointed with the amount of different stuff they sell. There are a few baked items but not more than even American stores sell. The croissants aren't bad, just ok thought. There is more wine than actual food."}
{"text":"Update: I called no less than 5 times over the course of an hour (between 5:30pm and 6:30 pm on a Friday night to ask if they had a specific pastry in stock before driving across town to pick up...each time, the phone rolled to voice mail. We took a chance and drove to the restaurant in hopes that they had the pastry. When we arrived the pastry case was stark/mostly empty. Luckily, I asked to see if there was any pastry not on display. The guy brought out an entire tray and proceeded to refill the case. I guess, they don't automatically keep the case stocked. I also commented on my multiple phone calls that rolled into voice mail. The response was, \"oh really?\" The place was not busy and there were 2 guys socializing at the counter, and one guy serving the few customers that were there. My friend called the place while we were there to see what would happen, and it was funny and surprising to see the two guys standing around ignoring the rings and neither answered the phone. Her call rolled into voice mail. Overall, the pastry  is good, but they really don't make much of an effort to provide customer service."}
{"text":"Ok So I as well had been waiting to go to this place after I saw them Open.
I had waited quite awhile till I did.
Not because, I did not want to ,but because, I always have my list of my 6 most important things to do while in town. 
I finally made it a point to stop in.
I am sorry to say I was very disappointed.
 But, I am going to give them another chance again very soon.
The store is really large so they have an opportunity to do a lot with it. 
It was extremely dark in there though. I can appreciate keeping the lights low when it is sooo hot outside. But, it dark too dark to me with the huge concrete floor.
I ordered a few baked goods to take with me.
I really do love to support local business. They were really good. But, for some reason I was expertly fabulous food and baked goods.
As I say ,I will try them again. Anyone can have the rough day. The service was very nice. I was just let down on the decor and the choices. 
I even bought 2 containers of Tea as well as the baked goods. 
I wanted to help keep it going you know. 
I will post in the future about the French Grocery , so I will let you know.
Parking is right out front. Sometimes ,a bit tight."}
{"text":"The beignets are fresh and awesome and croissants are buttery and good. Enjoyed the French press coffee. The crème brûlée was liquid on bottom and not very appetizing."}
{"text":"I grew up on near the border betwixt Germany and France, I've been all over France and I've eaten a lot of French food.  I love French food.  I try my best when I go to French (and German) restaurants to temper my expectations.  This is America.  This will be different.  This won't be what I remember. 

Forget all that, this was fantastic.  

Our server was Willy (with an i.e.) and he was really very good.  He made suggestions great again (food, wine, beer, etc.) and even paid me the compliment of assuming that Vicki and Enzo were my parents.  I could complain about filling my own water glass one time or the fact that asparagus wandered onto my plate but those aren't his faults.

We started with the pommes frites with a garlic aioli.  Normally, I eschew anything mayonnaise based but my love of authentic French fries and garlic overrode my disgust for mayonnaise.  The pommes frites were what I remembered, perhaps better than I remembered, and the aioli was worth the lifetime on my hips.  We also had goose liver pate and I enjoyed that best of all, I love a good pate and I don't often get it.  I'm pretty sure I hadn't had a good pate since my grandmother's 100th birthday celebration.  My dining companions also had bacon-wrapped prawns which I cannot speak to, I am allergic.  
My entrée was a rack of lamb.  That lamb had a great rack, the glaze was perfect and the meat was tender and tasted wonderful.  The sides were good as well, even if asparagus found its way onto my plate.  I'll find it in my heart to forgive Willy (with an i.e.).  I normally don't get lamb, beef bourguignon is a comfort food for me and my go-to dish in a French restaurant in France, I didn't want to put these fine people through my delusions of refinement.  Had I known everything else would be on point I may have taken a stab at it. 

Enzo had a steak not found on the menu, made especially for him, and Vicki had the shrimp etouffee.  I didn't try their food out of experience and allergies.  Everything looked wonderful.  No food was left behind.  

Willy (with an i.e.) did ask one stupid question which I found irritating, \"did we want dessert?\"  Sir, are you aware of the law?  If Vicki and I consume vegetables we are bound by ecclesiastic and temporal law to also have dessert.  It's not just a 'want,' it is a, 'need.' 

For dessert Vicki shared a flourless chocolate cake that was good but, my dad is a chef, I tend to like HIS better but I think he'd even agree that this was a homerun or other sportsball analogy.  It was fantastic.  I had a chocolate peppermint mousse which honestly left me wanting more, specifically all of it.  All the mousse.  All the time.  My one suggestion is that at dessert I need a shovel, not a spoon for ants.  Also, more mousse.  

We also had a fantastic bottle of Beaujolais Nouveau and then several more.  I woke up clutching that bottle at Vicki and Enzo's house.  Willy (with an i.e.) makes wonderful suggestions and you should do what he says.  You'll thank me later. 

This restaurant functions also as a market with a full range of French cheeses, wines, and other marvels of the French culinary tradition. Much of the things you'll eat are made there (and I think all of them are).  

They offer breakfast and lunch with counter service, dinner is table service.  I would go there in the morning and never leave but my budget doesn't allow that and I am fairly obnoxious.  Willy (with an i.e.) may have quit being nice long ago.  

So, boys and girls: if you're looking for an excellent and authentic French experience take it from me, this is the real deal.  Even if Vicki, Enzo, and Alison weren't the family in my head I would visit them again just to waddle my chunky self over to the French Market."}
{"text":"How anyone can give this place a good review is beyond me. We had a 7:15pm  reservation and we arrived early. We waited to be seated and finally a man with a hat from behind the counter asked our name and if we had a reservation. I told him the name and he yelled you are 20 minutes early from behind the counter. . He acted like he had to rearrange the room for us and there were only 3 tables with people seated there. Finally he brought us to the table and we waited awhile for water to be served. Meanwhile I looked around the room and it looked very messy and unkept in my opinion.  There were 4 men 2 cooks a waited and someone talking to people about wine. They all looked unkept to me. The wine we ordered was very good. Then my friend asked for a separate check when we ordered and he told her it was too busy to do that. That was with 3 tables there...
My husband ordered Foie Gras and there was one piece on top of something  ground up and he didn't know what it was. His main meal was soft shell crabs and they were so over breaded he couldn't eat them and he loves soft shell crabs.
I ordered the lamb and the chops were very small with one a tablespoon of orzo and cut brussels sprout and had no taste. There was no salt and pepper on the table, we had to ask as the food needed it. Our friend ordered the lamb and was told by the waited there were 3 chops. When hers arrived she only had 2. She felt the same as I about the lamb dish.
When it came time for desert she and I walked up to the counted to see what they had. She asked for an eclair and the man behind the counted yelled to the young boy to see if they had any in the back. I ordered the creme brûlée and we carried them to the table????? what was that all about.  My desert was very good but the eclair was just ok. The coffee was good.
The concept of this restaurant is unique but it is lacking in so many ways. I try to give a restaurant a second chance but I will not return to this on."}
{"text":"The food is awesome.  Please please bring the original beignets back!  The small cubes of beignets are horribly dried."}
{"text":"This review is only for the beignets- they were amazing. They were hearty, made fresh and covered in powdered sugar. Plus my car smelled delicious afterwards."}
{"text":"Ignored by a guy who walked from the counter to mess around in the coolers and another who was gabbing with the (only other) two customers at a table.  Cook spoke up only to tell one of the employees that the food he was cooking was ready.  I just walked out."}
{"text":"We came to this little spot after hearing so many good reviews on yelp and from a coworker of mine. We tried the French macaroons and they were to die for. I was left wanting to dive a hour from my house to get some more macaroons."}
{"text":"French grocery is the best hidden gem in Phoenix.  I found it last week and have been a total of three times and can't wait to get back here again.  My first experience was a Friday lunch.  We sat at the while marble bar.  We drank Chardonnay and rose and ate creamy green soup and one of each of the grilled cheese sandwiches!  For dinner a couple of nights later I sat in the same location and ate cheese, mussels, grilled lamb burger and of course had water and wine to drink. Service was great, food even better. Today for a late brunch, croque Madame with a beautiful sunny side egg on top!  I recommend this place for a great chill experience with wonderful food!"}
{"text":"Great pastries and food, cheese selection. Can eat in or takeaway. Limited seating and foot traffic otherwise would rate higher"}
{"text":"I miss little markets/restaurants/wine bar/coffee shop patisserie in one spot.  One of the things I miss the most about living in New York but alas I found the French Market, so cute I only wish I lived within walking distance.  I came for lunch and had the Croque Monsieur for those who don't know like France's version of a grilled ham and cheese.  Very hearty and rich I had to take half home, what I loved was thick slices of actual ham like you would get at a deli, unlike the sliced processed sandwich style meat you usually get some places.  My friend only got the pommes frites with Parmesan and garlic served  with spicy aioli (great) staff was friendly and helpful since I had never been there before.  I looked at the breakfast menu and the prices are great I spend more at Starbucks on the way to work for a microwaved breakfast sandwich and coffee.  I am definitely coming back for breakfast/coffee and desserts.  Great assortment of French cheeses/wine for sale and thinking of shocking my friends at my get together with goose liver pate, more for me I'll just tell them it's a meat dip."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, this review can't be helpful cause I didn't get anything. I went for some beignets because I had read such great reviews. However, because of the oversight of, the owners? There is no mention, not on the website or menu board, that they don't make them to go on weekends. WHAT? Oh well, I tried. Probably won't again because I don't have the time to find a parking spot, wait in line then be told I can't be served. My suggestion is to be clear on your serving issues so they don't become any for your would have been customers."}
{"text":"Came here for Valentines Day dinner. It's an interesting restaurant. Nothing bad just different. I would say it's a cross between a restaurant, deli and gas mart. The restaurant wasn't busy but since there are coolers across the back wall full of wine and beer, it was its carry out that was constant. Also many people coming in to get cheese and dessert to take away. We were seated right away and our server took our drink order first. He recommended their house Chardonnay which was delicious. My husband and I had the Tarte Flambee for appetizer and it was very good. For dinner we had the Steak Frites which was flavourful but it was  warm. I know I should have sent it back to be heated but I didn't. I think part of the problem was that the servers also worked the cheese and dessert counters and was also cashier at times so it was a little difficult to get the servers attention. I did have a cup of cafe au lait but once again coffee was flavourful but just warm. We took dessert home which was the Red Wine cake which was outstanding. I would have loved to have given it more stars but couldn't due to food temperature. I will definitely be back because I truly wanted to love this place."}
{"text":"So I've been waiting for this place to open up, and it seem they're now fully functioning. Maybe I was expecting something different, but I have to say I 'm a bit disappointed. They had maybe 6 cheeses in their case, a few of them were French. They had a couple of kind of boring side dishes, again very ho hum. A majority of the food is set to be taken home, which is nice. They didn't have much selection, but the food did look good. I ended up getting a duck breast sandwich that was okay, but not for $12. My wife really enjoyed her beignets but  the croissants were not very good. Overall, it was just okay. I can't see me going out of my way to get here."}
{"text":"I had really high hopes for this spot.. unfortunately we didn't have a great experience. We ordered cappuccinos and they were awful, almost like they weren't sure how to make it. The croissant was yummy, we wanted croque monsier but they said they couldn't make it until lunch. It's so similar to the breakfast sandwiches you'd think it wouldn't be an issue.. but it was. I left a nice tip at the register but when we were served our food was tossed on the table, no utensils were offered or napkins. So we got up and found them our selves. Not going back."}
{"text":"I come for the beignets. They're wonderful. Fluffy, hot, and sweet. Unfortunately, I don't know nothin' bout French food. But this place is totally adorbs. Like, great for a casual date over nice coffee and beignets. But buy your own order of beignets because you will not want to share. 

Duck fat can be purchased here, if you're into that."}
{"text":"I went for breakfast, it's a really cute little place. The bacon, egg, & cheese croissant I got was AMAZING, but the French press was disappointing."}
{"text":"Such an awesome place. Great wine, great food, and awesome staff. My friends and I had a birthday dinner here. The wine and beer was delicious and the food was phenomenal. I'm so happy to have this place on my list of places to regularly visit."}
{"text":"I picked up some desserts at this place to take home to sample and share with my husband.  I really enjoyed the pear almond tart and the cherry almond clafoutis.  We also tried a couple of macarons.  I found the center to be to \"creamy.\"  I prefer the centers to be more of a chewy consistency.  Most of the other little places I have been to where I enjoy them make them this way.  The dinner menu looks good and I am interested in trying their moules next time I stop in.  I think this is a great place to share some wine, bread, and a dessert during the day.  I can't speak for the dinner yet, but I am looking forward to trying it out."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Bakery is awesome! French bread, crossaints, beignets are fresh taste Amazing! Favorite Saturday hangout!"}
{"text":"2 stars because the macarons were definitely not fresh. It was super hard and crunchy."}
{"text":"I'm glad Phoenix has a cute little place like this, but it's not living up to its potential. 

The macarons were good but the beignets were dense, which may have been our fault since we got it to-go. 

They had an extensive wine selection, and some cheese and pastries to choose from. Overall a great concept, but the execution could be a lot better."}
{"text":"I just had the most delicious Po Boy sandwich.  The shrimp were mixed in a very spicy creole bbq sauce and placed in a hollowed out baguette. The bread was fresh and complimented the spice beautifully.  They have a wide wine and beer selection.  We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"I am editing this review. I did not have a good experience at French grocery the two times that I went. I know plenty of people who have enjoyed their experiences there, but for me, the service was lacking and the food was not good. Yesterday I posted a pretty angry review about my experience there in the morning. Since then, the owner of the store, Erin, called me to learn more about the situation and to apologize for something that happened yesterday. On the phone, she was genuinely kind and caring and I am glad that she reached out. This still would not be my ideal go to for coffee and a croissant. I have not been for dinner, and so maybe it is a different experience in the evening- as several of the reviews below reference dinner and wine."}
{"text":"HUGE selection of wine here. Like wow. Especially for a hole in the wall. It doesn't seem overwhelming or ridiculous like if you went to Total Wine or BevMo, just has great ambiance and charm to it.

I got a ham and gruyere sandwich that was awesome. Their pastries and macaroons are also great. Just a nice gem that's well worth checking out."}
{"text":"I have driven past this place so many times and thought \"I should really try this out\".  I got my chance recently when I decided to take beignets and chicory coffee to a work potluck!

The place is adorable!  It's an old convenience market in a tiny strip mall with a taco shop (and an since-closed \"massage parlor\").

They have a bakery, a kitchen, wine, and some really lovely areas inside to hang out and enjoy all those things.  I am already planning to study there as the need arises.

We have the real deal right in my neighborhood and I am so happy they are doing well, and that I finally tried them out!  If you like genuine food and nice people. give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Delicious treats, unfortunately was done eating it by the time staff brought the coffee, about 15 mins later. I received a bit of 'tude when I sincerely asked if they had forgotten?  Probably great place when not busy, but during this Saturday morning rush service was subpar due to inefficient set up."}
{"text":"Awful.  No self-respecting Louisiana expat would consider what was presented as a king cake edible.  I've eaten better cardboard.  A week old cake shipped in from LA would have been better."}
{"text":"So this place is dangerous if you have a sweet tooth. Stopped in for deserts and wine after a good night out and had an eclair and a nice bottle of red wine.

They offer sandwiches, wine, beer, gelato, pastries, etc...

I'll be stopping by again!"}
{"text":"Late night run to French Grocery = my happy place  cheese and bread and fois gras, oh my!! Eclairs, bread pudding, pot du creme....let the Friday night feast begin!!  ? 

They truly are a French bistro/grocer....such a quaint romantic little spot!! I'm completely obsessed!! 500 stars if I could!!"}
{"text":"This review is for the bread only. It is not French style bread. The crust is very soft, no crunch at all like you find in any good French bread. It's very fresh, tastes fine, but the lack of crisp, tangy crust kills it. You're much better off buying a loaf at Pane Bianco."}
{"text":"It took me a while to finally try French Grocery, and overall I'm glad I did. 
We were here during dinner and were right away confused by the concept. My boyfriend and I weren't greeted or told to seat ourselves, the staff didn't seem to notice us at all. Once we were seated, the server seemed rushed and frustrated. 

We ordered French onion soup to start, Steak Frites, mussels, and an IPA from the grab-n-go fridge. All of the good was super delicious, no complaints whatsoever. 

Bottom line, the only thing keeping this from being a 4 or 5 star review is the service. They may have better luck with a fast-casual format, easier for the customer to understand and the staff wouldn't have to be juggling kitchen and serving duties simultaneously. But we'll be back for the food."}
{"text":"If you're there in the morning- get an egg croissant and french press coffee

If you're there in the afternoon- get a glass of wine and their grilled cheese sandwich.

If you're there anytime- get their macarons! 

Such a fun place to go."}
{"text":"How happy am I to have such a cool place in my neighborhood. 

Great food, great service, great atmosphere....

Starbucks who? Coffee here is amazing and no plastic cups. You get a normal grown up ceramic coffee mug. 

The only thing that is missing here is nice patio...."}
{"text":"OMG, yes please. So good! I would eat here everyday if it would not cause me to gain weight. I always get praline bacon (AH-maxing), a ham and cheese croissant (croissants just as good as in Paris), and beignets (not quite the same as in NOLA, but I'll still eat them!). I like to think if I walk here from my house it helps offset the calories."}
{"text":"Coming back from Target and wanted a quick bite--so I thought I would stop--The parking lot was crowded and I thought oh good --it is doing well--but I was wrong--everyone except one person was obviously having lunch at Mucho Macho Taco.  the grocery has wine, pastries, french cheeses, banquettes and a nice little lunch menu--so I am very confused as to why the place is empty.  I ordered a grilled cheese to go--$6.  not much I admit and it was good, but it was just thrown into its plastic container with no care or company--a couple of pieces of cantaloupe or other melon would have complemented the sandwich very well.  There were three staff there--and all I can say meh--i have experienced better.  If you are going to use the word French in your name you should honor that legacy.   The French are concerned not only with the quality of the food but also its presentation and the company it keeps.  I was in this place at 12;45 and it was empty--I can't imagine what is keeping them open--It is kind of sad--with a little engagement and a little more care with the space--it could be a great little place."}
{"text":"Love the place and their food, just remember to double check your bill, I was charged extra for my food and my wine and I called later and they said that someone would contact me but no one did.  Again, great food and I will try this place again, this time, I would double check my bill to ensure correct amount is charged."}
{"text":"a great addition to the Valley!   serving locally roasted coffee including Roastery of Cave Creek - \"Roc2\"  to go with their delicious pastries !"}
{"text":"I don't give out 5 stars lightly.  Yes, this restaurant is casual and even half-grocery.  But they are exceptional in every way.  We frequent this restaurant and the service is consistently great.  You feel at home, comfortable there.  Like family.  Kevin, the owner is always there and eager to help customers find the right wine.  A wealth of knowledge- and I have never gotten a bottle I didn't like from French Grocery.  But let's get to the food!  Consistently excellent!  Last night I got the lamb burger and frites and it was succulent and flavorful- really delicious!  Steak frites are also a favorite as is the duck.  Happy hour is great as are the small plates.  Creative, fresh, rich yet light, approachable is how I would describe the menu.  And the house made desserts!"}
{"text":"Looks like this place was an old 7-11 at one time. The front has been redone and the inside is simply redecorated. It is more like a small convenience store with the scent of a French bakery in the air.

They basically have some tables to eat at and some display cases with bakery goods, cheeses, and ready made meals in the cooler section. Very simple with a lot of potential. Seen a lot of people enjoying some French pressed coffee and a treat on the side.

Picked up some some ready cooked New Orleans style Red Beans from the fridge to bring home. Had my eye on some Andouille Gumbo and their Shrimp Etouffee. I wonder if it is as good as mine. Hmmm?

Could not resist getting a Chocolate Eclair and some Praline Bacon. Ok maybe a couple bags of those hard to get tasty Zapps Chips for a midnight snack.

Would like to see more inventory and a larger selection of baked goods. I was expecting a little bit more of a presentation. Did not know you had to cook it at home and not eat it there. Hmmm?

Check them out and don't forget ... PRALINE BACON RULES !!!"}
{"text":"Loved everything about this place. If you're looking to get away for a few hours and just relax with great food and drinks; this is your Go-to! We found out about this gem from the show called, \"Check please\". 

I ordered a glass of Syrah, the server was very versed in the wine and was able to tell me the key notes.
Appetizer we split the roasted artichoke Caesar salad- which was amazing. The artichoke was mouthwatering.
Entrees: steak & frites- fries were lightly dusted with a Cajun seasoning I believe. Just an FYI- I think they cook their steaks a temp under so I would clarify your medium rare with them to make sure. The moules marineres which was mussels in a white wine garlic sauce, it was AMAZING! 
We were so stuffed we didn't save room for the most important part, dessert! 

Our server told us that they also have brunch??? Can't wait to go back. Please don't ever change a thing! :)"}
{"text":"Came here with my friend to celebrate my birthday! The sandwiches were yummy! Wine was amazing. Customer service amazing! We plan to go for happy hour soon!"}
{"text":"Great coffee & breakfast.  Croissants are delicious!  I always stop here when I can & a wonderful location."}
{"text":"Although the service was extremely slow (and it wasn't even busy) the pastries are good. The creme burle was delicious. The beignets are very hot, good and covered in powdered sugar. Would be better if served with honey or an orange sauce to dip in.
Got a loaf of bread to take home, the car smelled wonderful all the way home.
There is a variety of wines and cheeses to purchase as well. I think I will do some Christmas shopping here."}
{"text":"Food here is as good as others report. However, the service is abysmal. I was there with friends on Oct. 17, 2017, after hitting a hole in one at nearby Palo Verde golf course. To celebrate, I purchased a $35 bottle of their French champagne. To my surprise, I was charged a $10 corkage fee. I protested to no avail.  Either this is just an outrageous company policy, or the staff is plain ignorant. Take your pick."}
{"text":"I've read so many good reviews and wanted to come in and try their desserts. I came in on a Saturday afternoon, and there were still a lot of goodies to choose from but to my dismay, there were only a couple of flavors of macarons left. 

The lady was very helpful in explaining to me all the different desserts they had. I'm very indecisive and she was very patient with me. 

I ended up trying the macarons -- orange, strawberry and mocha? The orange was the best -- it had a unique flavor, perfect amount of tart, definitely hit the spot for me. But the other flavors were ok, nothing special about them, definitely had better. I was hoping they'd be more chewy. I'm sure they're fresh, but it was a little to hard for my taste, when I took a bite, the macaron was falling apart into little pieces. 

I'd still come back though to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!! I finally decided to try this place for dinner and I was super impressed. All the food ordered was amazing--the mussels are a must have! The sauce they're bathed in was good enough to eat with a spoon. Absolutely incredible. The wine selection was great, and surprisingly, so was the beer. My boyfriend was very pleased!"}
{"text":"This is my go to wine shop whenever I'm in Phoenix.  If you enjoy truly interesting Old World wines as much as I do, you need to shop here for wine.  The owner is very knowledgeable, and he goes all out to source bottles you aren't going to see much of around the Valley, if ever."}
{"text":"Went to French grocery today for some lunch. We ordered take out since we were on a time constraint. I ordered a grilled cheese and soup. Honestly I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the milk-water they call a soup. The grilled cheese was amazing! Next time I'll just get a sandwich and maybe grab a couple of macaroons. (The refrigerator was broken so they didn't have any out)"}
{"text":"This review is for a visit in August 2017.  We stopped in for a late night dessert run.  The beignets were for hubby, he said they were very good.  I got a vegan sesame mousse dessert that was very delicious.  Grabbed a delicious bottle of rosé for later. A very cute little place that was busy and the service was speedy with a smile."}
{"text":"This is a pleasant place to meet friends for pastries and coffee, or even a light lunch. The food is top quality, the service is friendly, and the atmosphere is informal with a touch of class. Parking is limited so the best times to come would be before or after the regular lunch period."}
{"text":"Awesome!

This place while albeit small was delicious. We were on the hunt for goat cheese which was bringing us all over the valley, with the end result of popping in here. They have an entire display of cheeses ranging from cow-goat-sheep, now I wont lie sheep cheese is not my thing. It was very bitter and I did not love the after taste, that being said I think it is super cool that they offered it. The goat cheese selection was small (but that was expected) and ranged from semi hard cheese to hard cheeses. The cheese I ended up with was semi hard with a bit of a bitter after taste, the price was fantastic. 

They had a bunch of cases for wine and beer along the wall, in addition to a case with pastries. 

It wasn't crazy busy on a Saturday which was perfect for us so if you in the area its for sure a  shop you should stop into."}
{"text":"Great cafe. Stopped by to hang out and catch up with a friend. What better way then with Macaroons and French sodas. Delightful selection and decent pricing. Nice location. Staff was kind short and quiet but I got everything I needed and wanted while there."}
{"text":"They have good baguettes and cheeses. Pre-made food is not so good and customer service is lacking. Maybe it's an \"oh you're not a regular\" attitude? But then again, how does one become a regular...

Pros
-Fresh bread
-Good cheeses & spreads

Cons
-Not much selection
-Pre made food is so-so"}
{"text":"I feel bad for my previous review. I shouldn't have based my review from the experience of one bad employee. Everyone else is always so nice here. The owner and all of his employees always take the time to talk to you and help you with what you need. I was in on Friday and the girls were very nice and gave me tips to keep my baguette fresh for Mother's Day. They even wrapped it in cello for me. The food has always remained great. If you are in the area you should support this business. It is people like this that keep food fresh, exciting, and most importantly non-corporate."}
{"text":"I got blueberry coffee cake and an espresso and it was amazing. Of course I'm a little weird and dipped my coffee cake in the espresso and it was the best weird thing I've done in awhile. DO IT! 

The prices are extremely reasonable and for lack of a better term, cheap. I would also like to try the wine or beer next time. Very excited to have the place in my back pocket here in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I have wanted to love this place for so long, but get a new level of disappointment every time.  Service can't be underestimated, but from not one person offering a simple good morning (even after I initiated), getting a french press pour full of coffee grains only to get a scowl and no verbal apology or let me get you another one right away, I don't understand how they stay in business.  The two stars I gave are for the coffee presentation (silver coffee press, tray, etc.) and pastries.  Don't expect smiles, friendliness, acknowledgment, or good service coming here."}
{"text":"This place is so cool!

The owners are great. The guy told me the place was Creole inspired, he's from Nawlins. I minored in French, I was a little excited thinking I'd get to use it. 

I got free samples of their baguette and a locally made goat cheese. 

I got one of their Cinnamon French Toast marscapones. It was really good! 

I came here during their soft open. Their grand opening is July 9th. 

I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I made it to French Grocery today for the soft opening.
And there is a lot to be done before a true grand opening, but I am loving what I see so far!

We ordered 3 cafe au lait (with chickory, as it should be!) and 2 orders of beignet to go. As an impulse, we also got a bag of Zapp's potato chips.

The cafe au lait were perfect! The beignet were a bit overdone (it was mentioned the oil had gotten a bit too hot) - but totally on the right track! The flavor, texture and size was spot on - just a wee bit overdone. We are definitely happy campers!

As mentioned  - I was there right after opening on the very first day of the soft opening - so there are absolutely some kinks to work out, and more inventory to add. For today, there was a limited selection of pastry, dry goods and cold drinks, with lots of empty shelf space, cooler space and bakery case space. I am looking forward to coming back by in the coming weeks and months to watch the place fill up  - it is a great space, and the friendliness of the owners and staff is welcoming.

A GREAT addition to the area, and hopefully a great part of the community for a long time to come.

I'm definitely a fan!"}
{"text":"This hidden 7th St Ave gem boast authentic French food, cheeses and an impressive wine collection. Lunch seating is available and the place is growing In popularity. Check out their amazing dessert selection: macaroons, creek brûlée and amazing beignets. French press coffee is delicious. Breakfast recommendations include their home made croissant sandwiches---spinach and egg are favs---or mini quiches. If you love French food, this place will delight! Service staff is warm and welcoming to boot. Wait time is sometime a little longer the norm, but entirely worth it."}
{"text":"As I stated in my earlier tip, they have beignets AND chicory coffee. The beignets are prepared (fried) fresh and you can request to have chicory coffee, served in either single or double service in a French press (how appropriate). I have been to New Orleans several times (I had many outstanding reviews on my experiences proclaimed on Yelp, but Yelp staff elected to delete most of my BEST reviews--out of state and intl travel) and this experience was mildly reminiscent of Cafe du Monde. Only mildly so, because there is no outdoor seating available. But the service was charming and so was the serving setting. Step in the door and feel yourself propelled to another place/another time."}
{"text":"Sweets, dinner, wine, snacks, beer, coffee and bakery all in ONE! Came here for the dessert after date night. I have been wanting to come for so long that maybe I should have waited some time in between dinner and dessert. Ordered some beignets for the mister and I.. Beignets were so AMAZING! They were just perfect. The right amount of size, warmth, sweetness, crunchiness and softness it was just delicious. Will be back soon and definitely with enough room to maybe eat more than just one lol thank you French Grocery! You and your staff were just awesome! Customer service top was great :) loved it"}
{"text":"A couple from New Orleans started this part market, part restaurant in 2013. They specialize in French, Cajun and Creole foods. The outside of the grocery may not look like much, but the decor and the service makes you feel welcome once you enter. You basically order your food or drink at the service counter and find a table to sit at and eat. They have a couple of huge deli cases full of pastas, meats, cheeses and desserts. They also have an enormous collection of French wines that are displayed beautifully throughout the store. I haven't had the opportunity to grab lunch here yet, but the BBQ shrimp po-boy and muffuletta sandwiches look amazing. The cochon de lait sandwich is also on my need-to-order list. I came in for some beignets and coffee one day and took home some yummy macarons for dessert later. They have quite a variety of macarons to choose from. My personal favorite is the salted caramel one. I also took home some of their homemade cinnamon almond butter and was eating that every morning on my toast. This place has been a nice addition to the Phoenix area and gives me some good throwback memories of my visit to New Orleans."}
{"text":"Beignets sold all night!  Tasty cheese plate. A nice glass of wine.  Good coffee and treats.  Support neighborhood small businesses!"}
{"text":"Salut, to this little Grocery! Bunched in to a small corner strip mall, this place doesn't look like much from the outside, but boy is it some kind of awesome on the inside! Super cute high tops with flowers and succulents. They had fridges full of beers, wines, and foods such as salads, and sandwiches. The Deli was filled with tasty sweet treats, cheeses, and small plates behind glass windows. There were 2 guys manning the whole place. Taking orders, greeting guests, taking out and making the food. They did a very good job at all of the above. We ordered the Beignets, Creme Brûlée, and a French Press. We were all very pleased. I will say that I was a little disappointed in the Beignets... A bit more doughy then what I've had before, not very melt in your mouth. (I would - 1/2 star for that if I could.) but the French Press Coffee was perfect, and the Creme Brûlée was fantastic! I will be back for some lunch and some more sweet treats. And I just loved the ambiance!!"}
{"text":"Saw this on the way home this morning from running errands. There is a starbucks across the street I was going to stop in at but decided to check this out. 
So glad I did.  From the sign, I didnt know if it was just a grocery store or restaurant.
It is kind of both!  
French pastries, desserts, wine, beer, cheese and coffee!
Chocolate croissant was fabulous! Fabulous and fresh!
They have eclairs, opera cake, flourless chocolate cakes, 
Lunch was starting at 11.  I wanted to try the garlic pumpkin soup but it was 1050 am and they apparently werent ready for lunch.  
Great wine collection to pick from as well.  Tables to sit down, counter service to go.
Just a cute little spot to start your morning off!
It's located next to mucho macho taco and shares a parking lot right in front."}
{"text":"I needed bread.  They had bread. They wouldn't sell it to me. They were \"saving it.\"
Didn't  give any other explaination.  It's a short story.  There were literally two tables with diners finishing up on a Saturday night at 7:30 pm."}
{"text":"Came in for the pastries and was extremely delighted with the gluten-free selection!
I am a big fan of creme brûlée and theirs was very good.  I also tried the macaroon parisien one of each flavor and those were also very good. My absolute favorite (chocolate lover) was the flourless chocolate cake. I will be going regularly."}
{"text":"I appreciate French food and like it more than I should. 

I also love NOLA and their Laissez les bons temps roulern!

But, the French Grocery is really not a grocery store at all. You cannot buy any grocery items, like you might find in a typical Champion or Carrefour. No Carte Noire coffee, no Maille moutardes, et cetera

They also do not cook, nor serve food here.  Everything is pre-made, wrapped for sale and kept in a refrigeration case. The only exception is the bakery items and a small chilled salad deli case. 

When we arrived on Friday just before five, there were also very few items left in the refrigerator. There was no croissants, no french bread or much of anything in the bakery case except for some small $1.75 cookies.

There were a couple of small individual Quiche Lorraines (which didn't contain any bacon or ham) and a few small baguette sandwiches, like you would find in Gare du Nord. 

The French Bakery also has a wine section, along with a few French press coffee pots. As others have noted, the lighting is poor and makes the store feel dreary. There are a few tables scattered in this cavernous store. But I am unsure what they are used for since you cannot sit and eat any of the chilled items. 

I believe the French Grocery is set up to appeal to working couples on the go --who want something more interesting than the Take Out selection of Fresh & Easy.  Of the six items we ordered, the best was the chocolate Pot de Creme for $3.50. Our total including tax came to $32.11

But if you come to the French Grocery thinking of Le Pain Quotidien, Le Madeleine, or even local Amuse Bouche (Surprise), you might leave disappointed.   Sorry!"}
{"text":"Watched the review on Check Please which was laudatory.  Found the experience to be highly disappointing contrary to the publicized review.  At lunch all the pastry was gone with little to no option to choose.  The line was long as was the wait for lunch.  Obviously not enough staff onboard as there were dirty dishes scattered throughout the very few tables they have available to sit at.  Did enjoy my salad when it arrived but waited on my roast beef sandwich for over 45 minutes.  The soup of the day was potato leek which came less a crust of bread.  When we asked if we could have some bread with the soup the wait staff said it did not come with bread and we would have to stand in line again to order some.  W t f.   We most certainly will not be back.  Do not recommend."}
{"text":"I stopped by on the way home to get some beignets. This was my first time there and they were absolutely awesome. This will be a regular stop on the way home."}
{"text":"Went there today at lunch with Mrs.  Had heard good things about their breakfasts but it was too late for that.  
Ms. had mushroom soup and a sandwich..turkey and brie with cranberries.
I had mushroom soup and ham and gruyere cheese.
Both sandwhiches were served hot.  Wife declared the soup wonderful.  I thought it was a bit thin.   It was good though, and had a bit of pepper in it but not overly so.  This is because of the Cajun roots that the French Groc. has.
Their cold case had several tempting items in it.
Ms. wants to go back but I'm thinking I want to give it another try before putting it on my permanent \"go to\" list.
Price for two sandwhiches and two cups of soup was $19.00"}
{"text":"Cute space on 7th Avenue!  I was expecting more grocery items instead of a cafe, but still liked it nonetheless.  I tried the chocolate croissant and the pumpkin roll...both were amazing!  Definitely the kind of place you can stop in on a regular basis to enjoy a coffee and pastry or for soup and sandwich for lunch."}
{"text":"Super happy to have this establishment in my neighborhood!  Great food and a large selection of import and quality domestic beers too.  I usually don't get out the door without one of their wonderful desserts either.  Dine in, or take it to go.  I'm seriously going to miss this place..."}
{"text":"I wanted this place to be better than it actually was. The service is sub par. No one really acknowledges that you are there. Went to the counter to order since it appears there is no wait staff, but it's not really evident what you are supposed to do when you walk in. I ordered a Croque Madam, chocolate croissant for my son  and a French press for myself. The kid taking the order seemed spaced out and I had to reiterate the 3 items several times. After that I literally waited 30 minutes for a ham and cheese sandwich....the coffee was good, but I had to go back to the counter several times to get the water they never brought and to ask if they forgot my sandwich since the people that came in behind me got their food and I had not yet received mine. Everyone that works there looks like they really don't want to be there. It's a shame because with great service a place like this in a good location would thrive. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Best chocolate croissants I've ever had! The frites were amazing especially with the sauce. But star of the show is definitely the croissants."}
{"text":"Casual place with food and service of a 5 star restaurant. The frittes are absolutely delicious. They are served with a garlic aioli. My husband had the fried shrimp po'boy. I had the turkey and Brie sandwich and my daughter had the truffle burger. We all had the soup du jour which was cream of mushroom. EVERYTHING was full of flavor and incredible!!  At the end we shared the beignets!  Wow!!  We will definitely be back and this time for dinner"}
{"text":"This place has wonderful pastries. I've had lunch there several times - the food is always good but the place has no ambience which is okay if the people behind the counters and delivering food to table were even a little bit friendly.  They have always seemed indifferent as to whether or not you're there. Lots of other places have good food and a welcoming attitude to make you want to return."}
{"text":"My wife and I are regulars here. To be clear, this is not a grocery! All the better though, as it's a great environment for one of several things: A) eating a delectable dinner, lunch, or brunch; B) casually enjoying wine, beer, or coffee (the French press coffee is my favorite); C) enjoying some of the most exquisite deserts you'll find in Phoenix. The staff are extremely friendly. The decor is very minimalist, but in quite a positive way: unlike other like establishments, there is no air of pretension at French Grocery. Five stars -- this place is a gem."}
{"text":"Hidden gem -delicious food! Steak and pommes frites, crab and toast appetizer and a beignet for dessert!"}
{"text":"Something exotic and down home at the same time. I've eaten here several times and just love it! Today I had a glass of fruity red house wine with a perfect red pear custard tart in a chocolate cake shell. This grocery store/restaurant has an astounding selection of wines, cheeses and pâtés. 
I came back for dinner and was not disappointed in the pâté, bacon-wrapped figs, and duck. I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Lady at the counter could be a bit nicer but the cooks overcome anything with the delicious coffee and beignets 
Also they're very nice to make my 2 year old daughter warm coco or chocolate milk 
I've tried some of their dessert and all of
Them awesome 
Only that I don't appreciate when I paid $8 for a piece and they serve it on a plastic container to go when I'm eating at the place (again the counter lady) 
The food is delicious and definitely will becoming back"}
{"text":"I will never ever go back. The very worst service we've ever had in Phoenix. Beyond slow. Totally disorganized and ultimately owner fairly rude. Food was up and down. Hanger steak and fries good, chicken good ( both maybe 3 star) but beef bourguignon was way way over cooked. There is simply nothing to recommend this place."}
{"text":"I was at the grocery having coffee and Beignets at 11am and checked with the lady at the counter if there would be any issue getting in with 10 of us at 5pm for happy hour. She assured me that wouldn't be a problem as Thursday's are slow around 5pm. Not one mention that a reservation would be needed. 
Initially we arrive at 4:40 said we had 10 confirmed, 8 show up. The host said we could have the table for 10 until the 7 o'clock reservation. We agreed. When the server arrived he was rude from the get go! Pushing food and when we said we'd order after drinks he became quite short with us and rude. When 2 of the ladies ask for suggestions he walked away, then again he walks away when asked for the bill, said not right now. We had 8 people, drinking and ordered food. I spoke with the owner and basically  said there was nothing more he could do! The first 2 guest left not even paying there full bill with them putting everything together on one bill plus the 20% gratuity. When they left after the treatment we canceled the food. They made us move to the bar. Then left to sit there with no further service. We had to ask for our bill which included drinks and service that wasn't even ours. We certainly don't recommend this place after this sort of treatment. One server for entire place, while the owner seemed to enjoy just watching the chaos!"}
{"text":"Literally some of the worst customer service anywhere. I love the food, wine selection and desserts but every time I come in there, the place will have three or more employees standing around doing nothing while multiple customers stand in line. A person can reach a point with no matter how much you like the food or concept of a French grocery ... The horrible customer service an unapologetic attitude about it merits staying away."}
{"text":"The WORST, most incompetent people I have ever encountered. My bridesmaid and myself have tried contacting them (3) separate times each just trying to get questions answered and also to put in an actual order. The first two times I called I was told to call back closer to the wedding, this was 2 weeks before my wedding. I called back 1 week later and left 2 voicemails - never heard back. Called again and finally talked with the actual pastry chef, who they told me to talk to, and she said Im giving her really short notice of my order!!!! Talk about unorganized and incompetent. She told me to email her what I needed after I explained everything.....sooooo then I emailed her and what do you know, NO RESPONSE. My bridesmaid had the same problems!!! Im puzzled as to how this company can have such high reviews.....my guess is they pay Yelp to remove the negative reviews. AVOID FRENCH GROCERY at all cost!!! I will NEVER go to them for anything again!"}
{"text":"I have been to two French Groceries since I moved to AZ.  This one and La Grande Orange.  Neither of them actually sell groceries!  I know for a FACT that grocery stores in Paris carry everything that we have in OUR grocery stores and more.  Oh well.  Just don't show up with your reusable bags expecting to do your weekly shopping.

I have only had desserts here but they were good and I very much want to try the dinner as well.  Their selection of wines is not as good as one would hope from a \"French Grocery.\"  Prices are reasonable.  I would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"The French Grocery is a classic example of \"try it to believe it\".  I would never expect a place so unassuming, to provide such an authentic and inspiring meal.  Located at the corner of Missouri and 7th Ave in Phoenix, AZ The French Grocery offers fine French food at affordable prices.  The atmosphere is casual and inviting.  It features a small sitting area, that starts it's day as a lively cafe offering fine pastries and strong coffee, then thoughtfully ending it, serving a beautiful dinner every evening.
     My first dinner visit I had the pleasure of enjoying the Trout Amandine.  It was a beautifully cooked piece of trout breaded in almond flour, served with asparagus and think sliced potatoes cooked in butter.  The flavors we're outrageous and I could barely hold myself back for another bite.  Everything about it screamed classic French, from the rich butter sauce that the trout was served in, to the moist of fish wrapped in a crunchy almond flour crust.  I was just blown away.
     To be honest it would require a second full review to fully describe what this place offers so just do yourself a favor and check it out as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I cannot review the food.  My review is based on calling to get a reservation.
I called to make a reservation and Brianna answered the phone.  She was extremely rude from the get-go.  She said that she couldn't help me then, but she would be calling me back BEFORE 9 PM.  9 came and went.  I called at 9:15 and she answered the phone again.  Why I didn't just forget about it with the first call is beyond me.  Anyway. if you think she was rude the first time, the second time made the first call look like an angel had answered the first time.  She was even ruder.  I wanted a reservation for 5 PM on the 19th.  Well, her response was that there was no room for us even at that early time.  Thanks to her, this review reflects that call.  I know that no one in our group will never attempt to go again."}
{"text":"Macaroons.. NOW I KNOW the secret.. These were so good I had to sit down!! O.M.G. got some crunchy french bread for $3.00 and a great bottle of wine. I can't wait to try all the wines!  I didn't know they were a restaurant!! May check out breakfast with some great coffee some day!"}
{"text":"Watched a recorded episode of, \"Check\", and decided to go out and off Weight Watchers diet for a meal. We usually don't do that but had to treat ourselves for weeks of diet. with some hopefully tasty flavorful food. 
It was lunch and everything,  almost all on menu included bread. Oh love good bread. I had a shrimp poorboy and shared an order of french fries. with my wife. She had a club sandwich on a dark brown roll. She was satisfied with her meal. I not so much. My bread item tasted like yesterdays or earlier as the dough part was stiff like day old bread.A baguette from Frys foods much better.  The shrimp covered only half the sandwich which is sad. I ate the cut side, or what I call the camera side as what one sees. and the interior was just a little lettuce and some sort of sauce. I didn't finish the bread and left it  on the plate. The shrimp tasted very  good but just not enough for the size of the sandwich. The French fries were great and I gave up many points for them and they were worth it. Of course I haven't had a  french fry in 2 months. They were worth it, did I say.  I read the menu and didn't see anything I wanted to come back for. to have on a second trip but then how often does one travel 2/3s the valley to eat lunch."}
{"text":"Food was wonderful, we had the spinach & mushroom crepe & a second lunch special (it was like a ham & cheese pannini) both were very good. I also had a fruit tart that was extremely tasty. There are only a few lunch options to choose from, but several desserts & bakery items. I'll definitely go back to see the different lunch options."}
{"text":"I found this little Gem today on a referral from a friend. The outside doesn't do the inside justice.  Great Service and atmosphere. The beignets are wonderful and took me back home to Cafe' DuMonde.  The muffaletta was excellent, best I have had outside of Central Grocery in the French Quarter.  Selection might be small to some, but the quality of the food more than makes up for it.  The owner came out and talked to me and the other patrons and thanked us for coming.  It was wonderful to find a little piece of home here in Pheonix.  Will absolutely be going back to try their King Cake! Laissez les bon temps rouler!"}
{"text":"While it's apparent from the outside this used to be a convenience store, when you walk in that impression quickly dissolves. The main thing you find is an extensive wine selection, yet they also have yummy looking sandwiches, salads, and pastries, as well as some French staples. We had just eaten dinner at Hana Sushi across the street when we noticed the store, so only purchased some delicious macarons from a handsome, blue-eyed homme, who my daughter was thrilled to get a picture of.  I know next time we're in the area she'll be asking to \"shop\" there again, and add in that they use local and organic foods, as well as gluten-free, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"First time here and bummed we didn't come earlier.  All we had were macaroons and beignets and a baguette but all were amazing!  We want to go back and try their sandwiches and wines!!  Everything is a moderately priced.  It's quaint and sweet.  Great place to hang out for a cup of wine, coffee, and just talk."}
{"text":"We can walk to the French Grocery, which I found fantastic!
I've been to it for coffee, breakfast, dinner, and my favorite... dessert. Creme brûlée is fantastic. 
They have this special thing on Wednesdays for wine -$10 I think for some of the bottles in the menu.
The waiter was very friendly and honest, which I love because there's nothing more annoying than a waitress trying to sell the whole menu. Loved him.

I'll always go back there for my fav dessert.
Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love French Grocery. We always bike here on Saturday mornings then enjoy the French press coffee and croissant sandwiches with egg, bacon and Gruyere cheese. Delicious! I always love the black iced too. It has such a great flavor. My only complaint is the hours. They don't open early enough to go before work and they aren't open on Sundays-- one of the main days people would go."}
{"text":"Such a neat place. Good-looking interesting and quiet (at lunch anyway). I had the red pepper and goat cheese quiche, she had an order of praline bacon (to die for) and croque monsieur. Beignets for dessert. Just great."}
{"text":"I highly recommend this place. I just went for the first time for breakfast. Its cute and casual with counter service. I had the Croque Madame, which was delicious. It had lots of cheese, not too much bread, a perfect egg, and came with a side salad with a light vinaigrette on the side. They serve mimosas with orange or grapefruit juice, and they are a good size. I took a chocolate croissant to go and it was amazing, as were the macarons. They were giving away day old bread for free, so I took one and that was great as well!  Great all around. I will buy some wine next time, as I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Finally got around to stopping in here today since I happen to live in the neighborhood and I couldn't be happier I did. I ordered a sugar free vanilla latte with nonfat milk...they did not have the sugar free flavoring, however, a friendly gentleman (seemed like maybe the owner?) went above and beyond accommodating the request by adding real vanilla and leaving sugar out. He handed me the coffee and assured me if I needed any extra vanilla to not hesitate to ask. I love that sincerity and genuine want to ensure the customer is satisfied...lastly, my partner and I ordered beignets to go. They come in batches of three and are made to order which, I think as someone posted before, are well worth the wait. I've actually only had beignets one time at the infamous Cafe DuMonde in New Orleans when I visited there earlier this year and I have to say these things are comparable, if not even better than those! They are huge in size and crispy in all the right places on the outside while soft on the inside....just don't bite in too quickly as they come out piping hot! If I can, I will attach a photo of mine before I annihilated it. Seriously happy to see this sort if place in my neighborhood, I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Came here at 12 noon. This is a lovely bakery and has tasty food. Maybe because it was Friday noon, the service was a little slow and my burger was well done instead of medium rare. Regardless it's a great place to check out."}
{"text":"Amazing wine selection with many Kermit Lynch imports making appearances. I love having a glass here, some snacks, and picking up bottles to go. This is a rare spot in the valley that will make you feel like you're in a much bigger city."}
{"text":"Just tried the spinach croissant and INHALED it. French press coffee as well.  I enjoy how relaxed and mellow this place is and food is terrific."}
{"text":"Beignets

I found \"French Grocery\" because I was on the hunt for \"beignets\" in Phoenix.  I am the first to admit that I've never been to New Orleans, but I have had the beignets at Disneyland and a few places in California, so I do have a small basis to claim that French Grocery's beignets are delicious.

The beignets at French Grocery are the perfect amount of doughy-ness and sweetness, they're the reason I will keep going back. 

The website doesn't detail how much they are, but at the time of this review they were 3 for $5  and worth every penny!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem! Absolutely amazing.  Food is fresh and fantastic. Please get wifi so I can have all my business meetings here."}
{"text":"This little place is on a busy corner and quaint so seems to have good foot traffic.  My biggest concern is you will have to wait for----e-----ver if you want to use a card to pay. It's been like this at least for the last 2-3 years....smh :/ :/ :/    That's why though I've visited this place about 5 times in the past, but only made a purchase 2 times and passed it up plenty of times due to not having time to wait. 

In fact, (what I think is a funny story), on one of my visits I took a friend's little girl in with me to buy her a thank you treat and we waited and we waited and we waited and no one acknowledged our presence and we waited. Finally, the little girl says to me, \"Why are we waiting so long?\". My reply, \"I don't know.\", and so we left the store to spend money somewhere else.

So, the only 2 food items I can comment on are the French macaroons (or macaron if you prefer;) and the beignets.

The macaroons I tried were very pretty and had a good flavor, but that's as far as I can compliment. Why? You ask....Do tell. You say. WELL! With how hard the macaroon was you they might as well have renamed it biscotti because I darn near broke a tooth trying to eat them. Lesson: ask the person behind the counter which little sweets were made most recently.

Now for the beignets that was another l-o-o-o-o-o-o-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-g-g-g-g-g wait, but this wait was worth it? I'm still questioning myself about that one. The minimum order was 3 so that's how many I ordered. While waiting I perused the offerings they had in the attached store. The donuts were actually bigger than I thought they'd be and quite filling so I had breakfast and snack for a couple days.

Only the beignets rounded my review up to a 3. Can't say I'll be in soon unless I have a lot of time to waste one day soon or simply looking to luxuriate and have coffee talk with a friend.

If ever have time to eat in I might write about the customer service, but for now we'll leave that for another day."}
{"text":"I'm so sad to hear that 17 June 2018 was their last day for restaurant operation. I just found them recently, and I was ecstatic about their pastries and baked goods. Now where can I find a clafoutis in Phoenix? Another cute restaurant is gone"}
{"text":"Cappuccino was good, beignets were hard as a rock.  
We asked if that's what they were supposed to be like and he said, \"sometimes they come out like that, they're inconsistent. I can give you a refund, if you want\", we didn't accept but we were disappointed and won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Wine and pastries and coffee and more galore! This little grocery has everything you need for a good picnic. They have refrigerated cases filled with wine, champagne and beer along with non-alcoholic beverages. Behind the counter lies freshly made croissants, macaroons and other delicious sweet treats. They also serve up some delicious sandwiches on baguettes or croissant, along with a fresh roasted coffee that packs a punch. With several tables for seating, this is a good place to either grab a quick bite on the go or stay and hang for awhile."}
{"text":"I stopped here for lunch hoping to have some French dejeuner and stock up on some French groceries! The lunch was good- stinky but tasty cheese in the croque Madame and quiche, and the salad was fresh and had French style vinaigrette. We were a little disappointed by the lack of actual French groceries :( the cheese selection was not too far above Trader Joes, they didn't even have all of the classics like Beaufort, and classic chèvre. Also they had a very small selection for the patisserie and boulangerie. To summarize, it was good, but I was just hoping for more variety overall."}
{"text":"Love thins amazing French Grocery!! Wonderful ambience with café  feel. Yes, I feel loved and back in France!!"}
{"text":"This is our second time here. The first time was great - this time was a little disappointing. 

The cashiers/servers do not create a welcoming experience - not are they attentive to the patrons. 

The food, however, was great.  We had brunch and thoroughly enjoyed the Croque Monsieur and Bananas Foster French Toast. The wine was also very nice. 

Definitely pricey for their overall value prop.  Would try again but probably order to go."}
{"text":"They open at 7am but baguettes at not ready but after 8am? Not very French of them. Too bad for one of the only few places where one is able to get decent bread in Phoenix. 
In addition, the attitude of the woman making the bread.. Hilariously ridiculous. She thinks she is running the top bakery of Paris or something."}
{"text":"This is one of those hidden gems that delivers amazingly delicious food, attentive service and a great wine selection.  Every dish from appetizers to main course to dessert was beautifully prepared.  We had the best time in this relaxed bistro environment."}
{"text":"Hands down one of THE best croissants I've ever had exists here. It's on my way to work so sometimes I stop in and grab a coffee and pastry to go.  I've also stopped in midday. Oddly every time I've gone in it looks a bit empty and understocked.  The food is good but the environment leaves a bit to be desired."}
{"text":"Good , unusual food light music in background large selection of wine. Hard chairs. Not many tables."}
{"text":"I had great expectations on this place but My first time I went there, I got some desserts and a baguette. The two desserts were not bad but nothing amazing, the baguette was good, actually. But the negative side on my first visit was the poorly customer service specially from a tall guy with an attitude, didn't welcome me, or thanks or good bye, no eye contact and poorly answered my questions.  I felt he didn't need my business. 
Two months later I thought I want to give it another try and I went for two different desserts and two croissants.  The two desserts weren't great (too bad). The two croissants were much better. 
But again I had the bad luck to got service by the same tall guy with a really bad attitude, exactly the same. After I tasted the desserts and croissants and had a non welcoming experience I decided not to return to that place or recommend it to any of my friends."}
{"text":"Love this place so much! 

Their food is delectable and the place is also nice to hang out and chill on Friday noon sipping a glass of wine and nibbling some delicious food. My personal favorite is their shrimp Po' boy & lamb burger, my husband loves their Turkey Brie sandwich. To tell you the secret though I come here often due to my love for their fries. They make really amazing thick crinkle cut frites. I like their beignets too bit they don't beat the fries .

The only negative that I can think of for this place  is if you come here often then the menu is too short. I have to make conscious effort not to come every other Friday as I don't want their food to get too monotonous. I hope they add some more seasonal and innovative options."}
{"text":"Um, is this place not super cute or what? Obsessed with all things French, once I saw this new, local business I had to try! And tried I have, as twice I went on days they were closed (and I was so bummed!) But today was the lucky day! 

First off, the interior is beautifully laid out and feels very much like a combination of a cafe and market from France. The co-owners were so nice, as I asked question after question about the business, excited it was my first visit. 

Some amazing pros about the place: 

-They make their own gelato in house - yum!
-Some of the most delicious espresso I've tried around town, and it's not on fire when they serve it (my taste buds thank you).
-AMAZING imported wine selection :)
-Delicious looking pastries and nibbles (that I will have to try on my next visit!).
-Most importantly, it's all things French!

Thank you French Grocery for creating this little gem in the neighborhood! I will definitely be frequenting your business!"}
{"text":"So I went in to get some Beignets and coffee, but i accidentally said Barguette so the owner pointed to a basket of bread. lol. so embarrassed. Any store with cool names like that deserved a five stars. jk. hahaha anyway my impression the poeple are nice. The Beignets is really good. i like it. i'm excited to see what they will have on opening days. Man french is so sexy... and that french girl at the counter is sexy too. I just want too......."}
{"text":"If i could rate French Grocery 6 stars I would!  I'm native to Phoenix and I love that this place makes me feel like I'm on vacation.  The music and service set the tone right when you walk in.  This was another wonderful dining experience at the French Grocery!  Tonight we had salmon veloute and the steak & frites.  The salmon was amazing!  I don't typically order fish, but I'm so glad that I did!  The sauce was delicious and savory and with a squeeze of fresh lemon....oh my gosh so good!  My husband ordered the steak & frites (again), which reinforces it's deliciousness!  You can count on any of the specials being creative and yummy.  I love that French Grocery has main dishes that don't change, but also have unique specials that vary.  Desserts are a must!  There are so many to choose from.  You will not be disappointed!  To top it all off, the staff are super friendly and knowledgeable.  If you have a question-ask.  If you need a recommendation-ask.  It's clear each employee is invested in your experience and has first hand knowledge of the preparation of your meal."}
{"text":"I'm not what you would call a huge fan of French cuisine.  That doesn't mean I can't appreciate delicious when it hits my lips.  I didn't really know what to expect from this place, other than I was fairly certain I could get some duck confit or a croissant.  I was right, but they have a lot more.  Sadly, I came near closing time, so many of their savory options were gone.  But, I was able to snag some of their macaroons and a madeline.  I guess their macaroon flavors rotate all the time, but the blueberry one I had was easily the finest macaroon I've had to date.  Couple this with a very European feel inside & very friendly service, and this was a nice change of pace.

I will go back, if nothing else, to try one of their savory croissants - and possibly some of their other fresh items that frankly wouldn't travel well in 110 degree heat.  This place is unique and if you're in the area, definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"Need to have a nice dinner with a glass of wine? Tired of old town? Tired of downtown Phoenix?   

Treat yourself to a little French cuisine. Yes here in Arizona we have an Authentic French restaurant. French wine, French dinner, French deserts.. they have it all.

I've been here a few times. Today I had a little lunch sandwich and a glass of house red wine. 

The atmosphere is delightful and enjoyable. The music was at the perfect volume. We will definitely come back here again. I really want to eat every desert they have so please do yourself a favor. Save a little room for the macaroons. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I came here solely for the fact that they had macaroons. For the record they were not freshly made. Most places don't bake their macaroons daily anyways so it makes sense. I personally would not buy macaroons here again, they were way too sweet(in a too much sugar way.) The customer service was friendly, and if you want to grab a bite, this place definitely has a restaurant vibe to it"}
{"text":"Big fan of French Grocery. The beignets are excellent and a favorite of ours (as well as some out of town guests when they come to visit) along with their french press coffee. Their espresso drinks are also great. 

Service is always friendly and, while the turnaround isn't necessarily the fastest (beignets and coffee are both made to order) I never have a problem because it's such a neat little place to hang out."}
{"text":"I've come here a couple times and I love it!Good assortment of beers and definitely of wine, delicious baked goods and French presses. I would highly recommend this place!

Good atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"I have a million things I need to do today but they are ALL on hold so I can write about how awesome this place is. They are not even fully up and running (Grand Opening is 9 July, folks) and they've already won me over. Why?

Their Espresso is at the top of my list. It is very well balanced: not too weak, not too bold, not too bitter and a really pleasant aftertaste that makes for a well-rounded consumption of coffee. Maybe my response was psychosomatic but it really took me back to Europe for a moment.

I read about their beignets and the reports are not exaggerated. They are fried up perfectly light and just a tad crispy. As much as I love donuts this was such a step up I don't know if I can ever go back. 

So my first visit here was like a mini-vacation to France and I feel like I got back a little joie de vivre. There was a bit of a wait to get my order but the folks took my coffee order while I was in line and I got to start savouring before I put in my pastry order so props for being mindful of the customers and doing their best to look after us. Since the beignets are made to order, it is worth the wait....trust me.

They also have some tasty looking gelato and their cooler already had some deli foods like olives and cheese (I need to come back soon to pick up some parmesan). I can only imagine what awesome goodies they're going to have. Once they get their liquor license we can look forward to French wine and craft beer for sale. They also have fresh flowers for sale. How awesome will you be when you bring home some fresh flowers and a bottle of wine and some cheese? Oui, oui!

The inside is very pleasant and has a nice European feel  with white walls and French Country décor. I had a chance to chat with the owner's wife and they are really great people so this is a great new business that is well worth patronizing. I think it is a great concept and am so happy that we have this in Phoenix. It is dangerously close to where I live so I could very soon turn into a beignet whore-consider yourself warned!

Parking is a bit of an issue and after going around the block twice I had to park across the street and walk in the 115 degree heat....but it was worth it. I do hope that they find reason to open earlier during the week in the future because I would be in for coffee every day on the way to work.

Really great place run by good people. Well worth checking out and I can't wait to see how much more I love them when they are completely up and running!"}
{"text":"Neat little market and cafe that we randomly drove by. We had a sandwich, coffee, and macarons. The man behind the counter was happy to come out and chat for a few minutes. Food was pricier than a typical lunch/snack, but for basically handmade with quality ingredients I'm not surprised. Great place to get a sweet fix and I'm sure we'll be back when we're in the area."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings on my visit to this small cafe. The young waitress tried hard but was not experienced and seemed overwhelmed. The first course of sweetbreads was really exceptional, tender and well flavored! But the steak was quite poor, chewy and not tasted, veggies boring with no flavor. Wine was lovely."}
{"text":"Poor customer service. This was my first time going and was really looking forward to trying their macaroons. The employees were two men and a woman behind the counter who didn't welcome me nor acknowledge my presence. In fact they continued with their conversation as I stood next to the counter. I finally felt the need to interrupt their conversation and ask for what I wanted. I paid and asked for a receipt and then said \"thank you\", which was more than that person said to me. 

So, I enjoyed the macaroons. Did not enjoy the lack of respect coming from the employees. Will I go again? Maybe. 

It's been 10 months and I haven't returned! Don't plan to."}
{"text":"The owner knows his wine. Picked up some amazing wine from this location and it was because of the owner. If you want some amazing French wine for a great price this is the place!"}
{"text":"Have only been for groceries and sweets to go. My visits were over two years ago, around the time when they first opened. My gf and I lived in the area then and I have to say that we had a pleasant experience on every occasion. The owners were very helpful with our wine selections and the pate and confit were a treasure.

Haven't been in awhile but will be returning soon. I don't understand the negative reviews as I've not gone for sit down service. As a neighborhood place, I believe guests might be more understanding or helpful if the service isn't quite what they may expect. I mean, how many French groceries are there in YOUR hood?!?!?"}
{"text":"This place is a sneaky little asset to the 7th and Missouri neighborhood. With a wide selection of wine, sake and bombers right across from the BYOB sushi place, the French Grocery is a must-visit. Pick up a bottle or two to take back to your place, or do it genuine French style and set up at a table in the grocery's lobby for a bit. 

The recommendations from the on-site sommelier will help you a great deal in navigating the wine selection by your tastes and price point. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"French Grocery is one of the coolest places I frequented when I lived in Phoenix. A great menu featuring coffee, gelato, baked goods and a deli case full of interesting goodies. If you're looking for a neat place to have a cup of coffee or a little indulgence, check out French Grocery's French Press for Two and pick up a couple macaroons. The salted caramel ones are always a crowd pleaser, but I really liked the pistachio. This place really is a gem."}
{"text":"I had bookmarked French Grocery awhile back and was in the area and some time to kill, so I pulled up the address on Yelp App and made my over there.

The French Grocery, is more of a bistro/wine bar, not really a grocery, but please don't let that stop you from checking it out, because it does have plenty to offer.

When I traveled to France the one thing I wanted most was cheese, bread and wine, and now after checking this place out, I see I don't have to wait too long to get it. They have fresh bread, croissants, so many cheeses, French and American, so many to choose from, I just need to invest in a raclette grill and I will be one happy girl!

They also have some amazing looking desserts, custards, éclairs, beignets, pastries, macarons, tarts. Everything looking equally delish, but I walked away with  1/2 dozen of macarons, which my house loved, even my 2 year old grandson, who is very picky.

They have a nice wine selection too, bottles range in price, oh the bistro looks like it would make a cute date night/lunch spot too. Looking forward to my next trip back."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Cheese, wine, and yummy macaroons.  Staff is very attentive, there are plenty of dessert choices also.  They also have gelato which seems mysterious, but I guess it's just a train ride between France and Italy.  I plan on perusing the wine selection more next visit.  The place definitely has a French feel and flair."}
{"text":"Have driven past here many times. Wanted to check them out. This place was profiled on Fox 10 AZAM this morning. Thank you to Cory McCloskey for profiling Kevin and his amazing place. We started with a Fromage & Charcuterie Plate that had a bleu cheese, bre and a French farmhouse cheddar cheese that was quite tasty. My husband had shrimps and grits. Blackened shrimp with 2 grits cakes. I had scallops mango. Pan-Seared Diver Scallops and Coconut Mango Beurre Blanc, sautéed seasonal vegetables. We had a bottle of Rhone red that was delicious. Anxiously awaiting beignets for desert. Kevin is from MS/LA. His wife an AZ native. They have a wine selection that is pretty on point. Cannot wait return...."}
{"text":"Had dinner here this Saturday and had an awesome time sitting at bar.  Drank some awesome French wines, and eat delicious duck confit and some spicy mussels as an appetizer.  If you love New Orleans food, or just good food and wine in general, you gotta check this place out!   Best part, if you find a wine you like, grab an extra and take it home for later."}
{"text":"Stood there waiting for a table. No one acknowledged us. No one said, \"I'll be right with you.\" Darn shame! I was excited about trying this place. Not good for business guys!"}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to the opening of this place but have ended up being so disappointed by their food. On my first visit, I got an almond croissant and 2 macarons. (not macaroons, folks--that's a completely different cookie) The croissant was extremely dry with some sort of weird gummy paste inside. The macarons were refrigerated, which is really a crime against pastry. I get the feeling that they are not made fresh daily, which totally ruins the quality. Day old, cold macarons are never good. The filling in the pistachio one was also very greasy. I ended up spitting it out and throwing the rest away.

On my 2nd visit, I tried another croissant, another macaron and a baguette. The baguette was good but not worth a special trip for. The croissants and macarons have not improved at all. 

The dinner options seem to be more Creole based which is not really my interest. I haven't seen a lot of options available at the French grocery that make it worth a special trip. I'll just wait for the new location of Essence Bakery to open if I want good French pastries. 

I just came back from a 10 day trip to France so I've had the real deal and it's so much better than what this place has to offer. I don't really see any reason to go back."}
{"text":"I had read about this place opening up and being from South Louisiana I had to see what it was about. 

I got a few of their ready made soups..French Onion, Corn and Crab bisque and the potato soup.. All were outstanding. 

They have these fresh made macaroons with interesting flavors.. Got a few of those and an almond Danish .. All were just as good. 

Lots of French/cajun and creole dishes you can get ready made along with a nice size wine collection.

Atmosphere is really clean and airy.. I look forward to trying their chicken and andouille sausage gumbo which they were out of at the time."}
{"text":"I have become a French Grocery Addict. 

When I first dropped in to try this place out it was a relatively quiet afternoon and I found myself ordering some lunch and an iced tea, not knowing what to expect from this new spot in my neighborhood. Little did I know this was the beginning of getting completely hooked on this tiny gem with tons of character.

When I think of French food, I think of intimate locations in France's countryside with rich food that tempts you to linger and make small take with the wait staff. This is the exact feeling of French Grocery. As a central phoenix local, I love having this atmosphere so close to me.

Items Not To Be Missed: 

-French Dip Sandwich
-Fried Langostines
-Opera Cake
-Mussels with Shallot Butter Sauce
-French Onion Soup

Honestly, all their food has been delicious without exception. Lunch options include delicious flatbreads as well as sandwiches, and their selection of Iced Tea from Harney & Sons make a refreshing compliment to our summer heat.

French food is nothing without desserts, and French Grocery's Eclairs, Opera Cakes, and Macaroons are all delightful. Again, there are no bad choices here. Combine this with the amazing service, the exceptional list of wine and beer, and this has easily become one of my absolute favorites. This is one addiction I'm happy to indulge!"}
{"text":"There are a handful of \"must have\" restaurants here in Phoenix, and the French Grocery is one of them. My wife and I have tried, and we never manage to leave with left overs. The food, the wine, and the bakery are all fantastic and authentic. Best in AZ."}
{"text":"Excellent!   Great food and wonderful value.  Sides are not included in prices and portions are huge so sides not needed. We will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I am very mixed on this place. It has such potential but in the end the service is why I give it three stars. 

I have been twice for lunch and the experience has been the same both times. 

It smells wonderful inside from all kinds of pastries and baked goods. My first visit I had the shrimp po boy, a baguette stuffed with barbecue shrimp served warm (not the traditional New Orleans way, cold with lettuce and mayo), it was very good. I had iced tea to drink after asking for an Arnold Palmer. They can make an Arnold Palmer with a lemonade you can buy from their drink case, however this day the drink case was wiped out of just about everything non alcoholic. 

This visit I had the Cochon Melt, a warm baguette sandwich stuffed with sliced pork, cheese, slaw and picked scallions. Again, a very good sandwich. I also ordered the French Onion soup, as did the rest of my party. To drink I ordered the French press coffee for one after going to the drink case and seeing that it was again pretty wiped out of non alcoholic beverages. I was very happy with the coffee though, excellent flavor! 

We took a seat and waited for our order. Two of my friends received their soup right away but not me. I thought to myself, maybe she didn't hear me order it, so I'll wait it out and see if it comes. Well, it came out with the rest of the food. I can't stand when something I order to be eaten first comes with my entree! My friends were already done with their soup. As for the soup itself. Good, but French Onion should have soft bread and melted cheese on top. This soup was hot, but the bread was so hard I couldn't cut into it and the slice of cheese was just laying on top not melted. The sandwich made up for it though, as I said, it was very good. 

Back to the real reason for the three stars, service. Some of the staff just don't seem to too interested in being there. They don't seem very helpful and have zero personality. It's almost like they are doing me a favor by serving me. No, I am doing YOU a favor by paying you for good service. Since you pre pay for your food at lunch time, you also pre tip. Next time I will hold off on the tip until the end to see if I will still get 50% good service! The was a very nice woman who was working in the wine section, I wish she had been taking care of us! 

Another thing French Grocery, I don't think it's hard to keep your non alcoholic drink case stocked. I am no stranger to cocktails and wine and would love nothing more than to get loaded at lunch time, but unfortunately my boss does mind. You are most likely going to sell more non alcoholic drinks at lunch on weekdays."}
{"text":"I've been visiting Phoenix for years and this was my first time to the French Grocery. I'm now obsessed! The breakfast croissants are outstanding! They must put some sort of spread on them that's delicious. The cappuccino reminds of cappuccino I had in Paris. It's not the generic stuff you get from big chains. The macarons were the BEST!! Everything is reasonably priced and I loved the vibe. The staff was very friendly. The owner must be a fellow Harry Potter fan! She complimented my Hogwarts tee! 
I highly recommend this fantastic place! I'll definitely be frequenting it!"}
{"text":"Decided to check this place out last night on Thursday and it wasn't too busy. It was a pretty small and secluded place, which I enjoyed. You go in and pick a table and sit down and the server comes to greet you. Our server Willie was excellent. He was very knowledgable about what they had to offer and made great suggestions. We went with a meat and cheese platter, duck breast, and mussels. We also went and ordered 2 bottles of the white bubbly wine. It went perfect with our whole meal. They had many options of cheeses to choose from and also they have a whole wall of fridges of beer and wine to select from. You can also purchase any single beers for a six pack like at Total Wine. We had the creme brûlée and sangria cheesecake for dessert and both were delicious! The sangria cheesecake was probably my favorite!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to go here since I first got wind of this place and FINALLY made it today! 

I am not familiar with Creole style food and one of the owners (I think) was happy to give me the low down. She even offered to make me a new coffee if I didn't like the chicory flavor, since it was my first time having. Awesome customer service! I also can't have dairy so I asked what their non-dairy options are. They just had soy. So of you've been reading my reviews, you know I get peeved when a local coffee shop doesn't have almond milk. So I decided to suggest they offer it, and the owner said he would from now on! So those of you almond milk lovers can thank yours truly for French Grocery carrying almond milk :)

Anyway, we ordered macaroons (I liked the green one the best, I think it was pistachio rosemary). They were perfect! Soft, chewy, not too sweet, bold flavor. The beignets were hot and fresh covered in powdered sugar, OMG to die for. And the praline bacon. Just sinful. I wish they would serve those hot out of the pan though. The one we got had been sitting out for a few minutes and cooled down and got kind of limp. They were so delicious. I'm a huge fan of sweet and salty mixed.

Unfortunately, they were sold out of croissants by 10am! I'm coming back during the week for those. Diet be damned.

We also got a French press and cafe au lait with chicory. I really really liked the chicory flavor! It's hard to explain. They use Cortez Coffee which I was thrilled to hear about because we know Ron Cortez and his coffee is superb.

Since they are brand new I figure there are kinks to be worked out. It was kinda hectic and disorganized at the counter. I think they are still finding their groove. I think they need to open earlier and definitely need to be open on Sundays. Parking is also a pain. But, their food and coffee is high quality and delicious. They will have lines out the door by the year's end.

Can't wait to come back. Seriously, I can't get that green macaroon and cafe au lait with chicory out of my mind. And the beignets...and French press...and praline bacon..."}
{"text":"I first stopped here for a baguette and brie and now I stop off for my morning coffee.
This is a very roomy combo grocery/bistro.
The baguettes are great and there's usually a decent selection of cheeses and pate's. There is a variety of coffee selections at reasonable prices. Regular coffee, french press, lattes, etc. They have several breakfast dishes as well as lunch items. There appears to be a nice wine selection and they have $5 house wine for happy hour. I have not tried it for lunch or hh yet.
Service has always been pleasant.
Big negatives for me are no wi-fi available and they are closed on Mondays. Oddly enough there is a Starbucks on the opposite corner which both has Wi-Fi and is open Mondays. For me the Grocery is much more comfortable and I prefer the french press coffee.
I highly recommend French Grocery for baguettes, croissants and good cheese selection. I would give it 5 stars if they had Wi-Fi."}
{"text":"I love this place! Their baguettes are amazing- some of the best bread I have ever had. Perfect Saturday lunch; a baguette and their delicious chaume cheese. Their eclairs, macaroons and croissants are equally amazing."}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal! We were privileged to meet the owners before their soft opening and have visited twice already. The beignets are wonderful (which is why they run out so quickly!) and the coffee is great (try the French Press with Chicory)! We've tasted madeleines, macaroons, gelato, and the Vichyssoise (smooth potato and leek soup, for those who are as ignorant as I was). All were delicious.

The restaurant just had their soft opening, so there's not a full selection of offerings yet, but they have lots of space and lots of plans to be totally stocked and ready to serve the masses for the Grand Opening on July 9. In the meantime, take advantage of being able to get in the door to try their coffee and bakery goods, because this place will be PACKED when they're ready to start their full-scale production.

PS. I'm dying to try the praline bacon next Saturday morning!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. Having heard good things, I ordered a take away lunch for two giving the hostess the honor of choosing the items. Well it did not go well.  The soup was not tasteful neither my guessed or me ate it. My roast beef sandwich had nothing on the giant bread and the broth for dipping was tasteless.  My friend faired better.  And to think I waited one half hour for this disappointment."}
{"text":"Got the chance to go here this afternoon for the first time and was astonished that for a little over a year this gem has eluded me. The food was incredible, the service was amazing, everyone was talkative and ready to help. Also the Macaroons freaking amazing, and the beignets...lets just say this guys gonna have powdered sugar all over his face for the foreseeable future. so happy this place exists."}
{"text":"Terrific local shop with top quality pastries, wines, and breads.  The owner is incredibly knowledgeable about wine and will guide you through the selection while being considerate and down to earth!  I hadn't been before but I will be back!  Phoenix needs more places like French Grocery!"}
{"text":"Delicious pastries including chocolate and almond croissants, beignets, macaroons, and tasty French bread. They also have prepared food like soups, salads and take home meals like coq au vin and beef bourguignon. The coffee  is delightful. Check out the website."}
{"text":"Returning customer of this lovely place. If you are looking for something new & different without giving up on quality, this is a must-try! I love their Shrimp PoBoy & can't bring myself to eat anything else because it's SOOOO DELICIOUS, but the atmosphere is classy & simple & I really love this place. A ton of wine choices to drink there or to buy for home, deserts, cheese....you've just gotta check them out!"}
{"text":"Awesome place for coffee and lunch. Great service and the french macarons are delicious."}
{"text":"Got a plate of beignets, a cinnamon macaroon, and a French press coffee. The beignets were delicious and fresh, covered in (extremely messy) powdered sugar. The macaroon, my first macaroon ever, was really odd - I don't get the macaroon trend, to be honest. It was doughy and sticky and didn't have much of a distinct flavour. I expected it to be a lot more airy and light. The coffee would have been better had I put more cream in before I left but it was otherwise all right. I'm not a fan of the roaster they use (I've had the coffee at a few other local places before) so that's more on me.
I'll need to come back when it's not so close to closing time so their bakery and food case is a little more full."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of their bacon, egg + cheese croissant sandwich. They aren't stingy with the bacon and with every bite you get perfect amount of each ingredient. I've also had the beignets and although they were good, I would've liked them more with some chocolate sauce. That's not to say they don't have any, I just didn't ask  to find out. I would love come here for dinner one day since the times I've come so far have been on weekday mornings and I'm usually the only one there."}
{"text":"The restaurant food was good but definitely not authentic. They have a good selection of imported French cheeses at a hefty price point. The cinnamon rolls were good."}
{"text":"We give it three stars because they have the most amazing French press coffee! But.... their beignets are awful. Over-cooked and hard. Terrible. Skip them if you go. 
Anyone know of a great beignet place?"}
{"text":"A wonderful selection of wines and helpful friendly service every time I have been here!"}
{"text":"This place is worth making the trip across town. Great food and service. Next time I want to try breakfast."}
{"text":"Rude staff! Avoid the macaroons, they are flavorless and basically fall apart at first bite."}
{"text":"Such a great place! Cute decorations and French theme. Ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with chèvre (goat cheese) and grilled red peppers and a chocolate macaron. Both delicious! We split the order of beignets and it was a but burnt at the edges but still yummy. The powdered sugar is my favorite part anyways. I like that they are a grocery store and sell food items ready to go in their fridges. I'll have to come back for their chèvre salad and to try more desserts."}
{"text":"If you want to feel unwelcomed this is the place to go. Not only is the staff unfriendly but the patrons will constantly stare and throw daggers your way if you don't look like a hipster. The self-service area contained only a few napkins (which I refilled for the other patrons who rudely stared while I did) and ran short on eating utensils. Two separate times staff members went to the self-service table and didn't bother to refill the forks or knives. When asking the staff questions we were met with ambivalence and made to feel like we were waisting there time. Will not ever be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here recently on a rainy day and were pleasantly surprised. The inside is cute and quaint. Half of it is like a grocery with a large selection of beers/wines, some small goods, and a cheese counter. The other half is a bar, a pastry counter, and a place to order food/drinks. Tables are sprinkled in-between both sections making the place flow.  Since it was after lunch, we looked at the pastry display case and drooled over the delicious looking cakes, tarts, and other goodies. The menu board had a few specials of the day and announced fresh, made to-order beignets. Our decision made, we ordered beignets and two vanilla lattes. The lattes came out first and were delicious. The espresso was strong and flavorful, not bitter at all. The vanilla was sweet but not overpowering. (The lattes were so good, I ordered another before we left.) Shortly after the lattes were delivered, the beignets followed and were huge, hot, sugary puffs of deliciousness. Three beignets come to an order and they were very filling. I would definitely come back for the beignets and I would love to come back and try some of their other items."}
{"text":"Great pastries and coffee. It's a little crowded at the order/pickup window; I'd suggest moving one to another spot along the bar.  Looking forward to seeing the Grocery side of things expand to carry more products!"}
{"text":"Omg so I was telling my boujee boyfriend about how I've never had macaroons before and he was like describing them to me and it sounded so good. So we hop on Yelp find this place and read the reviews look at the pics yadda yadda so we pull up and it's literally the cutest place ever and the macaroons are delicious!!! I've never been to Paris, but in this grocery store I actually felt like I was in the city of love. I recommend this place! 10/10!! PS the pumpkin cheesecake is to DIE for!!"}
{"text":"Came here for the shrimp ettoufee (based on pics on Yelp) and the macaroons but they don't sell the shrimp anymore :( 
Ordered macaroons, French onion soup and beignets. 

Beignets seemed a little burned (unless that's what it's supposed to look like but it wasn't when we were in New Orleans) but were good. The French onion soup was ok, the flavor was on the mild side."}
{"text":"I lived in France for 5 years, so I'm fairly picky when it comes to consuming French pastries in Arizona.  This is one of the few places that really has their stuff down.  Pastries are awesome, coffee is tasty, and their lunches are damn fine.  I've dabbled a bit in their cheeses which were quite satisfying.  Next, I will tackle their booze selection."}
{"text":"Great spot with tasty food. I had the roast beef and a cup of gumbo. The gumbo had a great flavor from the stock and the roast beef was truly excellent on a fresh baguette. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants. It isn't loud and bustling like some other restaurants in the area. It's small and quaint. The staff really knows their stuff. The food is excellent, at a decent price. The wine selection is pretty good. We have met a lot of nice people at the communal table. We have never had a bad experience. Don't leave without trying the flourless chocolate cake."}
{"text":"This place is just \"ok\". The macaroons were very disappointing. They were really chewy and cold. The macaroons at The Kak Shop are so much better, which really surprised me given that this establishment is supposed to be more authentic. The croissant I got was nothing to write home about either, and I felt like the service and ambience were just lacking. Ultimately, I was disappointed and probably will not waste any time coming here again."}
{"text":"I've lived in phoenix for years and just discovered this place not long ago. 

Most French cafes or restaurants are in  Scottsdale.  This is the only one in the central  Phoenix area. 

Although a bit pricey,  the food was good. 

I had a croque monsieur, cafe mocha and chocolate croissant.  Everything tasted good. 
My kids really like the  chocolate macarons.

I'm not a fan of the staff here but ehh..They were OK. Not really helpful. I don't think they are French though. 

Anyway,  overall I liked it enough to come back! Good place to work or meet with friends."}
{"text":"So I just called to ask about their macaroons, the guy answers the phone very up beat and peppy and got rude so quickly. I asked about their prices and their flavors. I saw by people's pictures there are usually different flavors available and I was interested to know what they had in the bakery case. The guy gave me the prices ($1.75 each or $17 for a dozen) when asked about the flavors he just says there's a lot of different flavors. I asked how many, he replied six. Then I asked if he could list them off for me and he acted very annoyed to have to do so and told me he is very busy, and then said I'd need to be put on hold for a few minutes and then asked if that would be okay. As I was really interested to know I agreed. After waiting shortly he gets back on the phone asking if I'm still there. I said yes. He QUICKLY lists off five flavors (banana foster, lavender honey, anise, chocolate, and another flavor I missed because he listed them off so quickly and with so much attitude I couldn't catch it) I then asked him if that was only 5 flavors he said yes. And I said well I only asked because originally he was so annoyed to be bothered about listing off 6 flavors and in reality there were only 5. Still not sure what the big deal was. He replies with a laugh and a 'yeah, goodbye' and hung up on me. Needless to say I was having an insane craving for macaroons and would have easily come in to buy a dozen if not 2 dozen. But this phone call has put me off. I'll take my macaron money elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Great place for a lazy Saturday morning coffee date. Things that are awesome here: coffee, sandwiches, pastries, and praline bacon. They have a wide variety of wines and beers that are more affordable than you would expect. Service is a little slow, so not somewhere to hit up if you're pressed for time."}
{"text":"So sad to hear they are closing - June 17 is the last day :(

Great place to get awesome French pastries!"}
{"text":"Cute place. Came here with a friend at night before 8 pm. It is dark inside place but don't  let that turn you away. They are indeed open. 
Love the way they did this place. Great things to check out.  They make their gelato in-house. Pastries looked yummy. Had their beignets. I don't know how much they normally cost but I thought the price was really good. $3 for 3. Will be back to try other things."}
{"text":"Delicious benges! Love the french roast! The club sandwich on a benge is a must try! Friendly service and relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food looks amazing, however we didn't get to try it. We came in sat down, then watch other people get acknowledged while the server ignored us. We went to the counter; thinking we would skip the food and just get coffee, only to be told that he was \"too busy\" to help us. That \"someone\" would be right with us.... we sat, we waited, server buzzed by once...twice... NO EYE CONTACT. No, \"sorry folks, I will be right with you\" when I did flag down the server, we were told, AGAIN, that we would just have to wait. Then we left. Friday night. Pretty Sad."}
{"text":"The food and baked goods here are truly world class and fantastic. Unfortunately, they know absolutely nothing about running a business or customer service. They forgot or screwed up a very simple order five separate times. Frustrating and utterly unnecessary since there were as many employees as customers during our visit. It's a shame."}
{"text":"I hate to give bad reviews. The staff were really nice, but the food wasn't up to par. It was quite bland and although the descriptions are creative I was so disappointed when my food arrived. I also heard the table next to us complain n to each other. The decor also needs a little work. I was looking forward to trying this place and Wanda ed to like it but I won't be going back. Quite pricy too for the quality."}
{"text":"After many returns to French Grocer, a three-star review is merited.  My experiences have unfortunately just been subpar lately, and the best thing going for them- the take-away sandwiches and salads- are no longer available.  My biggest gripe has been service lately.  I can handle very slow since I've come to expect it here, but not slow AND rude.  The young bearded gentleman (ok so everyone has a beard these days!!)  who seems to be a manager, is just plain impolite and unhelpful."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

Came in for dinner on 3/31/16.  First time since bookmarking when it opened a few years ago!  The decor and ambience inside felt a little \"off.\"  A divider screen, or two, could help out in parceling the two \"rooms\" (dining/deli-display cases and racks and fridges of wine and other beverages.  (I just spied Mark R.'s review on my upper right and he hit the nail on the head when he wrote \"Looks like this place was an old 7/11 at one time... like a small convenience store with the scent of a French bakery in the air.\")  Walking around- looking at the dessert and cheese display cases, dry goods on shelves- and then walking over to the table I chose (the community one nearest the bottles of wine by the wall, it felt like I was walking from one world into another- like crossing an abyss.

I arrived during happy hour, so I was able to try the Vegetable Frites app (orig. $8, but $5 during hh) and a glass of Domaine de Fontsainte Corbieres for $5 ($2 off glasses of wine).  From the dinner menu, I chose the Steak Frites ($18), perfectly-seared medium-rare sliced hanger steak and delicious mixed fries.  I'm allergic to mustard, so the kitchen swapped out the Dijon mustard for garlic mayonnaise.  The vegetable frites were beautiful to look at and so much fun to eat! https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/french-grocery-phoenix?select=fFuG8cQ9-ASu129kBkrtLA  Lightly-battered** and flash-fried pieces of onion, asparagus spears, haricot vert, and red bell pepper served with garlic mayonnaise.  I'd order this appetizer again.  The steak & frites were also equally-great! https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/french-grocery-phoenix?select=VS54sdtZsGJXv5LWJz9sKw  I used to enjoy medium-rare cooked meats when I was younger (grade school through mid-20s), but found that I rather appreciated a medium-cooked texture and flavor as I got older, but this hanger steak was perfection!  So great was the flavor and sear, that I worked hard to stop myself at eating half to save the other half for Mom to try.  (I left it for her to try that evening, but then ate it all the next evening, saying to myself \"you snooze, you lose!\")  I was able to sample a taste of the Savary Epineuil Bourgogne Rouge, a pinot ($10) before settling on the Corbieres, a Carignan wine.  It was served slightly-cold and was refreshing to drink by itself, though it paired well with the hanger steak and veggie frites.  It also was lovely to sip in between teaspoon servings of silky and rich chocolat pot de creme ($5.95). https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/french-grocery-phoenix?select=XLXFgweFOay4i5YWtisHmw  Shh!  I just had a scooped a rounded-teaspoonful of it before starting this review, and it still felt and tasted fantastique!  (My fridge cools items well.)

Loved speaking with Willy at the wine and dessert counters (thanks for the Carignan suggestion!) and handsome owner Kevin, who gave me detailed descriptions- preparation and presentation- of the veggie frites and Steak Frites.  Even Chef Beau came out a couple of times to see if I were enjoying the food.  Why, yes.  Yes, I was!  Loved the great service and seeing their enthusiasm and dedication to what they're offering.  I would love to return again soon and try other items on the menu, and I hope to be able to upgrade my rating to solid four or five stars... I feel a little re-arranging would fix the discord I sensed inside the French Grocery.

**The vegetable frites' light batter contained cornstarch, which gave the veggies a great crunch without being heavy nor tasting too greasy.  I did pay for messing with corn (allergy), with abdominal pain and a slight headache all night, and a rash on my face the next day."}
{"text":"I really wanted macarons for dessert. The place I wanted to go was closed, so we went here instead. It's at a corner in a building next to another restaurant. I appreciated the awesome service. We were greeted with a smile as soon as we walked in by the employee that helped us. Also, I appreciated that the macarons were $1.75 each instead of the normal $2.00 or more at a lot of places. Unfortunately, they weren't that good. (Insert the saddest face here.) I think the lemon was the best out of the ones purchased, but I still have had a lot better. The red velvet ones had no flavor at all. It could have been an off day for them, or they could've been older macarons. I guess if I ever go back, I'd have to try something else - maybe... possibly give their macarons another try..."}
{"text":"Excellent fresh made French Beignets here.  Great coffee & a small but very good looking fresh pastry case!  Definitely be back!"}
{"text":"It has to be said that the standard of the baking here is fabulous. Wonderful croissants, breads, coffee etc. I met up with a few of my friends here for a little breakfast get together. 
Three of us ordered the french press coffee, hot chocolate and Beignet. I wish I had ordered something else because the Beignets were
 huge! They come in three pieces, so they can be shared with your friends. One was enough for me since it has a lot of sugar.  It took a while to get our orders, but the Beignets are made to order, so it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Nice spot to grab good wine at great prices.  pastries are fresh and delicious! Ordered food and the guy that brought us our food was really polite."}
{"text":"Dined there with 2 other couples, at the suggestion of one of them, who is a foodie.  Our group's initial impression was skeptical:  storefront in a sketchy neighborhood with zero ambiance and one harried employee.  We did have a reservation and once our server got his act together, the experience was actually quite fun!  Food was delicious (we all had something different for dinner) and the server made a nice recovery.  He was probably overwhelmed as he appeared to be the only employee there, besides the kitchen staff. Wine selection was great!  I was hoping for a better Beignet (FG's was unnecessarily heavy) but all in all, we'd return."}
{"text":"I was lured in by the sign that said they had beignets. I've had beignets in New Orleans at Cafe du Monde and Cafe Beignet. These were nothing like those. I expected something light and airy with a crispiness from the fryer. These were heavy and dense and seemed baked. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Very disappointing, bought deserts for a dinner party realizing they all with no exception taste 2-3 old, stale crime and dry very dry and old pastry. not doing that again."}
{"text":"C'est si bon! French Grocery offers various Louisiana style and more traditional French dishes. We came here for lunch and had a roast beef au jus sandwich, pomme frites, iced cafe au lait, and a croque madame. The layout is chic and uncluttered, with various tables, a cold fridge section, numerous varieties of wine for purchase, a dessert case, and a cheese case. 

The food came out in a short time and smelled heavenly. The croque madame was perfectly crisp, with a lovely mix of flavors from the ham and cheese. The runny egg on top was perfect. It was so filling I could only finish half of a sandwich. The roast beef in the sandwich was tender and flavorful. The pomme frites were more thinly cut, but had an airy crispness and were perfectly seasoned. The cafe au lait was smooth and I loved the hint of chicory in the coffee. This version tasted a little lighter than others I've had though. 

At this time the menu seems more skewed towards traditional French dishes than Louisiana style cuisine. For instance, the dinner special for today was a rabbit cassoulet, and the only Louisiana type foods I could see for today (for lunch) were the beignets and chicory coffee.

At the condiment and utensil counter there is honey, agave nectar, and sweeteners at the table include sugar in the raw and stevia.

If I didn't already have enough desserts at home for a small army, I would have taken home some of the goodies in the dessert case. There were various flavors of macaron, stout gingerbread, fruit tart, and eggnog cheesecake when I browsed. 

I'll definitely come here again for more delectable edibles, and will have to try their beignets!"}
{"text":"Average. Very few tables and the menu is limited. Food was good but waited a while. Only 2 people taking orders and bringing it to your table. Had a ham and cheese sandwich- very tasty. Don't know if I would return."}
{"text":"I was on the hunt for a good croissant.  Croissants are one of those things I find tricky.  Most of them are terrible in these parts.  I went to the bakery next to Federal Pizza owned by the Coes hoping to find a good one.  The young man behind the counter told me that he believed the shop made them, but he had only been working there for 2 weeks and hadn't seen any made in that time.  I got on Yelp and since I didn't want to go out to Tempe to that apparently fabulous Essence Bakery, I decided to go to French Grocery.  I used to live around the corner from this place back in the day when it was a Circle K. (hey, that rhymed!)  I used to scrape together $1.50 in quarters and walk there to pick up smokes.  Yes, back in the 80s, cigarettes cost $1.50.....really.  But I digress.....I went into French Grocery and it seemed pretty bare bones.  The cheese case was tiny.  Like, you can get a better selection in the Safeway Deli... Many of them weren't even French.  But I was there for croissants.  I was going to a friend's house for coffee and thought these would make a nice accompaniment to the brew.  Wow.  What a complete disappointment.  I got 2 plain and two almond.  The almond ones were hollow where they should have had almond paste,  like the filling had melted out of them while baking.  We were left with the merest hint of flavor.  But the worst part?  The croissant dough was just bad.  Really bad.  I've lived in 2 cities with large Vietnamese populations and they are known for their excellent bakeries.  They were, after all, colonized by the French for a long time.  Anyway, I know my way around a great croissant and we didn't finish either kind.  The plain were just wrong.  Crusty like a biscuit, not flaky and buttery......dense and very dry.  It's almost as if they forgot to put the butter in the dough!  The consistency was so unlike that of a real croissant, they should take the French out of the name French Grocery.  Quelle disappointment.  I guess I'll have to continue my quest.  Also, they were way overpriced, even for a great croissant....Boo."}
{"text":"I'd like to recommend this place as the food is delicious, however the fact that a nice looking young couple were blatantly turned away ( she stated for the second time! They had tried to eat there on another occasion.) by an obnoxious waiter. They were told they could not be seated as they didn't have reservations. It was 8:00pm on Valentine's Day. Which normally, at every other restaurant in town, would be believable. However, THIS restaurant only had five of its dozen or so tables occupied and we had all been served our meals. The kitchen could be heard closing down shortly after this. And not another table was seated. So not only is the service slow as slow gets, the staff are as blatantly unashamedly lazy as anything I've ever seen, and I'm choosing lazy here, as the alternative is that, if it wasn't laziness then this is the absolute worst case of discrimination against someone ever. I give the food four stars, I give the staff zero stars. The odds of this place staying in business are minuscule. The staff or as the waiter stated, the \"husband\" will have it going under inside of six months. If this truly was an owners decision, then it would make as much business sense as putting fried dog crap on the menu."}
{"text":"I am super disappointed in this place...I have bought French macarons from this place for a while now and most recently 2 weekends in a row I had never been told that if I needed to purchase more than 2 dozen I needed to give advance notice.  In fact I was in the store on 3/23 and purchased a dozen and asked if there was an issue if I came in and purchased 3 dozen and I was told no.  Now 3/24 I stop by to purchase 3 dozen and I am told that anything over 2 dozen needs to be requested at least 2 days in advance.  I am a business major and I understand having product on hand so that your case is not empty but I would never turn a customer away or even make it seem as if it were an issue because my product is being purchased instead of being thrown out.  I was told that this time I could purchase 3 dozen but for future I would have to place an order.  This isn't the type of customer service I enjoy and I can take my purchases else where this isn't the only place that sells French macarons.  I believe you need to re-evaluate what the purpose of your company is, are you wanting to make a profit or be left with inventory? Not to mention the lack of customer service, you may want to let all your staff know that any large orders need to have at least 48 hour notice because it doesn't seem to be common knowledge."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots. 

Great coffee, good breakfast, seating is limited so get their early."}
{"text":"A New Orleans haven in Phoenix! This restaurant/cafe has the perfect combination of French/New Orleanian food & beverage options. The French press here is some of my favorite coffee in town. Plus a great wine selection & authentic French food offerings. I'd read about this place and finally got to try it- what a treat! Well worth the drive, and I'll definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Woeful service is right!!! one person taking orders, one rearranging macaroons, 3 standing around - and food handlers without gloves!  This place was in slow motion, no greeting, nada, nothing. Stood in line and walked out after 20+ minutes with 3 other parties in front of me.  Au revoir."}
{"text":"The worst service I've ever. Seen. Was sitting for 10 minutes while people at two tables next to us were served. The first time we asked about being served he told us that he was too busy and a server would be there soon. Then the SECOND time we asked the waiter said that they were too busy and he couldn't take our order(after serving the lady next to us) and someone would be with us \"in time\". Ridiculous. No acknowledgment of our existence, extremely rude, and very confusing seating. Will not be retiring. Was so excited to try this place and I am severely disappointed."}
{"text":"I usually do not care about service at a restaurant as long as the food quality is good, but this was too much. The same guy (with the long pony tail) on three separate occasions has been very rude to me and my wife. The third time I brought my whole family here 50 minutes before closing and he told us that we cannot be seated because the kitchen was \"about to close\" - im not usually one to suspect this, but I have a feeling it was because I am South Asian."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in a city full of diverse dining establishments.  The wine selection would be overwhelming if not for their helpful and informative staff.  The menu was surprisingly diverse.  For those that know me I came for the steak tartare.  FG's tartare portion was perfect.  I am always disappointed when an establishment provides the bite size version.  The taste and texture was fabulous and their several good wines by the glass the would perfectly compliment the tartare.  This is a must try when in Phoenix.."}
{"text":"Cute little neighborhood wine market and bistro. Awesome place for happy hour or date night. Owner is super knowledgeable about every wine he carries. The food is all delicious--best cheeses, yummiest mussels, steak and frites to die for. Highly recommend this place to grab wine to go, to stay, or to eat."}
{"text":"I like this place very much! It was a good experience (late afternoon) for espresso and light lunch and glass of wine...and a light taste of Creme Brulee - life is good! Wines are emphasized from French, Italy, and Spain...which I found a few labeled vineyards I liked. It's a lovely Bistro/Grocery (wines and cheese/beers). Staff are super friendly. Clean place! I would like to try this again for dinner. Happy dinning!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of French Grocery - we've had the pleasure of dining at this fantastic place several times, and in spite of some criticism below, will definitely be back!  Rating French Grocery is challenging - more so than usual.  Based on past trips, I'd have rated them a \"5\" but if this past weekends visit were the only one I had experienced, I'd rate them only as a \"3.\"  So, I've landed on a \"4\" and am hopeful for their future.

I love the ambiance.  I love the location and the fact that this is a bakery and a cafe and a restaurant and a bistro and a deli and a wine shop!  I love the truly fantastic food - Steak & Frites and the Duck Breast dishes are both delicious...the lump-crab appetizer was completely uncontrollably drool-worthy...the wine selections endless. You could make a meal of small-plates, but you shouldn't because you'd miss spectacular entrees!  In nearly every interaction, the service has been fantastic.  We've eaten there on our own...brought friends and family...and nearly every time we've raved.

So now, some criticism about the last visit.  Recently \"Check Please!\" (a local PBS show that reviews restaurants) showcased French Grocery and as you'd expect, it's gotten a lot busier for them.  There were little things in our last visit; they were out of water glasses and served our water in big disposable plastic cups...wine glasses weren't clean so we had to wait a bit to get our first glass of wine...they are open until 10, but the kitchen closes at 9 and by 8:30 we were getting heavy pressure to order entrees (at the same time they took the soup and salad order) which didn't have to be an issue, but when the entrees appeared before the salad did, it just screwed the service up and made them look a bit less capable than I know they are.  Generally, we were less attended to than past visits - no water refills over two hours for example.  The friends that were with us this weekend weren't impressed and said they'd probably not come back.  Fortunately, I know better - but I think of other people stopping in for a first visit and I get concerned about how they'll interpret service like this. I read the review from the guy on February 5 that rated them a \"1\" and I get the sense that there are some serious stress-cracks appearing and knowing how fragile restaurants can be, I'm concerned that they won't successfully manage through this increase in business and I don't want to see them go away. This is an opportunity and I hope they can find a great way to harness and take advantage of it!

If you can manage through what seems to be very recent - and hopefully self-limited issues - I think you'll come to enjoy French Grocery as much as we do.  

OH...they do breakfast and lunch too - we haven't taken advantage of that (yet) but I bet it's terrific!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to check this place out for awhile and now that I was there I was a little disappointed. It was a lot smaller than I imagined and still pretty sparse. They had a lot of wine and some decent cheeses but they seemed be out of pastries (maybe this is because I came mid afternoon on a Saturday?) Overall, I felt like this place wasn't as great as I thought it would be but I'm willing to give it another try."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to go here since they first opened.....last year. I'm late in trying them, but better late then never. My husband surprised me today with the cutest box from French Grocery. Inside sat the most delicious coconut cake I've ever had. We both try to limit our sugar intake at night, but the cake is so good that it's worth a sleepless night. I literally cannot wait to devour the rest tomorrow so I can go and get another one or four."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and it is real French food!!! The ambiance is perfect and great service! Will be back to buy some baguette fariné!!!"}
{"text":"It's pretty good, but not great. I mean, there's only like two French places in Phoenix, so it's in the top two at least. The eclair we had was a bit rubbery and the chocolate on top was not very good. 
The coffee was really great, but this place is not really a French grocery. They have LOADS of wine, a tiny bit of cheese, and that's about it in terms of grocery items. Haven't eaten lunch there, but it's far enough away from where I live that I won't make a special trip to try it again."}
{"text":"Good cafe. Good baked goods. Great cheese shop. Fantastic wine store! 

Although more reminiscent of my strolls through New Orleans than Paris, French Grocery is a solid destination for fulfilling some of the finer, rarer cravings I've had.

Perhaps it's the chicory-infused coffee that feels reminiscent of my visits to NOLA's iconic Cafe du Monde. This spice, the taste of which I'd compare to anise or licorice, has roots in the 19th century. During coffee shortages, most notably in the civil war, it would be used to stretch the supplies. The trend stuck, and even today this particular type of blend persists in the area. On my next visit, I'll pair it with their famous beignets! 

The sweets are legit. I have only had a couple of the tarts so far, but they were delicious and affordable. For more savory baked goods, you can't go wrong with a ham and cheese croissant for breakfast It's surprisingly light, and you'll enjoy every bite. Since they open at 7am, it's a nice, peaceful spot to drop by during your morning commute!

Other noteworthy products include a small, but fancy cheese selection. The largest selection of all, of course, is the wine. I have only perused it, but look forward to indulging. 

French Grocery isn't French enough to please those missing ventures across the Atlantic. Ironically, it's not even resembling a grocery. Still, it remains a solid spot for any time of day. Dine in, and grab some goodies to go."}
{"text":"This review is specifically for the pastries section (macarons) and their pomme frites (thin cut fries). I came on a late weeknight just looking for some desserts and ordered several macaron flavors. I thought they were standard, and to be honest, I expected better from this place specifically. The texture and consistency of the macarons were pretty good, but the flavors they had when I went were pretty typical - chocolate, coffee, salted caramel, lemon, passion fruit & earl gray. The fries were alright, def nothing special.

This place also has a small bar with different wine selections, a small grocery area, as well as a dining area for sit-down meals. I have not tried their entree items and will probably not come back for a while since I wasn't too impressed this first time around. 

Parking here is VERY tight, so make sure to be careful when driving into this small corner. This was an ok first time visit and although I wasn't impressed, I'd come back to try other items if I had to."}
{"text":"The fries were so salty we couldn't even eat them.  We sent them back and the next batch were just as bad and didn't eat them.    The coffee was good but not hot enough. My GF wanted another cup of coffee so I ordered a second one but when I went to pay with my credit card they said they had a $5 minimum on card purchases.  I had just spent $18 on coffee, fries and beignets and after sending the fries back I would have thought they'd either run the card for the $3.26 or give us a complimentary cup of coffee.   We love to patronize mom and pop places but they need to differentiate themselves with customer service and empower their employees to serve their customers.    I will not be coming back here.  They need to think outside the box."}
{"text":"Bump it up to 5: they are consistently wonderful, a place I really look forward to going!"}
{"text":"I came in here Saturday morning and bought a baguette and some eclairs. $12.  OK, $12, but I felt like I was bothering the cashier.  They weren't even busy and the place looked like it needed a good cleaning.  I shouldn't have to be the one who says THANK YOU.  The cashier should say THANK YOU to me.  I live nearby and don't think I'll be coming back.  Just saying."}
{"text":"Be.. Our.. Guest! Talk to Kevin when you visit and enjoy the coffee which is freshly made. You can get either espresso drinks or french press coffee! The sandwiches here are nothing short of magnifique! All sandwiches are served on their fresh daily baked bread. No wine or alcohol yet but I spoke to the manager and that seems to be in the works. Lovely place for a lovely lunch or a romantic dinner that reminds me of a cafe in Europe. Had the shrimp sandwich which was fantastic and fresh. Finished with a lavender and honey cookie which was equally amazing (be warned you can only buy a dozen at a time sine they are hand made every day) Lumiere from B and the B would be proud!"}
{"text":"I just love everything about this place! They have cups of bacon, right? How awesome!

Quick tip: If you want to order food to eat there, get a menu, grab a table on your own, and then order/pay at the counter. They will bring the food out but won't come to you to take an order (for lunch anyway, I've never been for dinner!).

My mom, sister, step-dad, and myself all adore this place. Everything we've had to eat here (sandwiches, specials, pastries, etc) exceeded our expectations. They do have some pre-made meals in the cooler you can grab and go as well."}
{"text":"This used to be one of my favorite places, unfortunately, that's no longer the case. I hadn't been in several months but I was going to have some people over so I wanted to put together a really good cheese board. Before, I would always just head over to the cheese display and have one of the staff members help me pick cheeses that would go well with what I was serving. However, I can't do that anymore because the cheese display is no longer there!!! It is now pre-cut and they have it in the furthest fridge from the register, by the wines. Additionally, I wasn't able to buy bread anymore! My disappointment cannot be put into words. The name \"French Grocery\" is false advertisement now. It may be \"French\", but there's nothing \"Grocery\" about it anymore."}
{"text":"Cute place! Do think it needs a bigger menu and a wider selection of times. When I hear \"grocery,\" I'm expecting a wider range of French items of the sort I bought while living in France that you can't get here (cute yogurts, Orangina, etc). Cheese selection could definitely be expanded too. Big focus on wine currently.

Also think their current hours are unrealistically short for the sort of place they are trying to be. 

It's a new business and I want to see it succeed so I will continue to patronize and hope they work on growing/expanding the selection!"}
{"text":"The crab canapé is amazing, their lamb burger is one of the top 3 burgers in town easily and their duck breast is enough to make me drive 30 minutes out of my way (surrounded by 'best of' restaurants in my immediate neighborhood) for dinner. Love the videos the owner does on Facebook every Wednesday (I now sound like a wine snob when I go out with friends for dinner)... and Willie (the server / host / all around everyman) is pretty much the nicest guy you could possibly want to ever meet. Go, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"A friend turned me on to this place and now I'm hooked.  The staff is super friendly and patient.  The beignets are out of this world and made fresh to order.  They have excellent coffee and I've never been disappointed by everything I tried. That garlic aioli they serve with the fries should be bottled! You need to try it if you haven't been here yet."}
{"text":"When we walked in, there was a couple ahead of us. We stood waiting and I decided to go look at the dessert case. Slim pickings, 4 different desserts and 4 flavors of macaroons. We then went back to stand behind the other couple. I started to notice signs here and there, sit here for this or that, order here for that or this. Not sure of where I should be and tired of standing I simply went and sat where I wanted. Waters were brought to us along w/ menus. We explained we were there for a dessert and drink. He explained we had to go over and order at the counter which we did, weird, just take my order. Wait in line at the counter, ordered one vanilla and then a banana fosters macaroon. We also ordered two hot chocolates and the beignets. Back to our table w/ the macaroons which were okay but odd. The cake portion was crispy on the outside but deflated when you bit in, no airy light cake type texture on the inside like I'm used to. The center was an ice cold chalky gauche type filling. Not a fan of either. The hot chocolate came out later, luke warm at best. The flavor was a cross between lavender and old Mexican chocolate. I understand they are wanting to serve an elevated hot coco but to go so far away from the standard is silly. We kept taking sips to try to understand the flavors but it started to taste like soap as it got colder. The beignets came out 15 minutes later, signs states as much so no problem there. Big problem, raw on the inside!! Imagine a medium rare steak, lots of pink running through the center. Large gummy, cold and raw center streak through the center. I ate some of the outside edge but it was pretty tasteless, if it wasn't for the powder sugar it would of been darn near bland. I've eaten many beignets in my day and this was bottom of the barrel. I was just really disappointed in this place. At other tables I looked at some of their dinners and they did look really good, maybe we just ordered poorly. Staff were all pleasant. Very eclectic group of customers which was fun for people watching. Maybe we'll stop in again and stick to wine and entrees."}
{"text":"Delish.  Best meal I've had in a long time.  Great service.  Fun atmosphere, the best deserts.  BLT bruschetta was amazing.  Will visit again for sure."}
{"text":"I came here not long after they opened and I got 4 assorted macarons and a crème brulee.  

We've never had macarons at our house before and were perplexed by the flavors of the macarons; we thought at least two of them were savory (a green one and a tan one) as they had a surprising lack of sweetness.  But I am the first to admit that I'm not at all familiar with macarons and their flavors, I guess I'm not sure what they were supposed to taste like, but the savory taste of the two surprised us and not in a good way. 

On the other hand, the crème brulee was amazing, absolutely perfect.  The French Grocery itself was cute and I liked the open format so you could see into the kitchen.  

It's worth mentioning that the ordering process was a little awkward (for me) as the customer right in front of me was carrying on a personal conversation with the employee who had rung up our purchases and I felt a little like an intruder on their private discussion as I stood there with my macarons in hand and waited for them to caramelize my crème brulee in the kitchen...awkward."}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING but the reason I am giving 3 stars is because the food takes FOREVER to come.  I ordered at 8pm and did not get my food til 8:45 pm.  Also dont expect to receive your full order.  One of the items I ordered never came, and I heard all the other tables around me question the server about where some of the things they ordered were as well.  Dont know whether or not I should ever return here."}
{"text":"Never got to try as they closed early- called to make sure they would be open and when we called at 8:45 said closing early... planned on picking up pastries for Christmas. Oh well- will try somewhere more reliable."}
{"text":"Becoming one of my go to spots. Excellent coffee and breakfast goodies. Also just had the steak, Pom frites and French onion soup. All most excellent.

Huge selection of beer and wine at a good price and a very knoledgible staff. They also now do wines by the glass. 

And the beignets ARE TO DIE FOR!!!

Give it a try!"}
{"text":"The grand opening is July 9th, but my coworkers and I wanted to grab beignets after our lunch. We came and we didn't know they had croissants and a lunch menu. Nonetheless, we got an order of beignets, some macaroons, and one of the coworkers got gelato. I got an iced coffee that was made exactly how they made it in NOLA. It was wonderful. The beignets were delicious. Everything was reasonable priced. I can't wait until they have their full lunch and dinner menu. Will definitely come back :)"}
{"text":"I had to come in and try the newest macaroon flavors- pumpkin pie and fig. To my surprise, I found something even better...Coconut Coffee Stout. Too bad, FG doesn't deliver!"}
{"text":"French Yumminess and an Adaptive Reuse Infill Location All in One

Wasn't expecting an option for French food in this area of town, but caught that French Grocery was down the road from my tailor.  It's more a deli/bakery/wine shop than true grocery store.  Still, you get the fix you're looking for.  

Tried two sandwich options and the garden salad from their cooler, along with a pear tart, one of each macaroon, a mousse cup, and a type of cake that looks like a big macaroon.  All were hits with my wife and daughters.  Especially the mousse cup for my ten month-old... but she would bite through mild steel with her new chipmunk teeth for access to anything remotely chocolate.  

Cheese selection was amazing.  Blast my Asian lactose sensitivity.  

The macaroons were best at room temp.  The big macaroon cake thing was excellent at room temp, but hard to cut because of the cream middle.  But chilled, it was easy to cut and stiff to eat.  So, recommend cutting while chilled and then eating when left to warm for 15 minutes.  Sandwich bread was a tad too hard.

If they had a true grocery selection for baking supplies, it would have been everything we were looking for.  And the shop is a beautiful conversion of what looks like an old garage or laundromat."}
{"text":"Too pricey. Food was not that great, it was too salty and not fresh.  The workers were rude and not nice.  Would not recommend this place at all"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. Go for the nosh menu as the prices are incredible. Their cheese selections are to die for, chicken liver pate made me a believer and the desserts/baked goods are perfection. 
The entire experience is an aphrodisiac."}
{"text":"This place was a gem of a find. I was in the neighborhood and there was traffic. So I decided to stop in and glad I did. The service was great, those guys were really knowledgeable. I just wanted a glass of wine and ended up taking a bottle home. 

I'd love to come back here and bring friends. I'm not in to French cuisine at all. In fact I have been to France and was not super impressed and would never go back. But I'd come back here in a heart beat. And next time I'm getting food."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in Phoenix! Love it! A bit of the Rive Gauche in Central Phoenix. Great food! Great wine! Excellent staff! And, I can speak some French here and they understand! Fantastique! I will miss this so much! Bonne chance!"}
{"text":"This is our second time here for desserts, which are amazingly delicious. The food looks good too but we haven't made it around to try it yet. The place was busy but service was fast and the guy that helped us was very friendly. We had the beignets for the first time which were very good and not to sweet. We also had some macaroons and the chocolate pots de creme which were all delicious and no complaints at all. We will definitely be back for more desserts."}
{"text":"I'm SO bummed to update this but not sure what happened here??? We ordered the beignets and they were burnt, so gross. I went to pour cream in my coffee and it was empty (even though they had just opened) and I took the lid off the milk container a horrible smell hit me. They had not washed or filled the carafe from the day before. So sad this place went downhill..




So happy I tried this place!!! The coffee is delicious and the beignets are out of this world!! The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because it opens at 10!!!??! If it opened earlier I would go there many many mornings!! It's also closed on Sundays which is kind of a bummer because it would be a great after church spot : )"}
{"text":"Took 45 minutes to get a burger, salad, and a couple grilled cheese on a Saturday afternoon where the restaurant was not very busy. Others complained about the wait too. Hopefully the rest of the staff's lives aren't as difficult as they made our order appear. 

Grab and go what's there (and watch the expiration date!) but NEVER wait around for an order."}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday and they had 2 types of desserts,  what a disappointment.  Neither was very good."}
{"text":"It's a cute place for a \"not so quick bite\". I realize they cook everything fresh so don't come in starving because you'll be waiting a bit. The coffee is pretty good. The music is nice. But the one thing this place is missing is a warm welcome with a smile. Everyone that works here looks likes they're in a bad mood. TIP: if you don't enjoy your job find something else. YOU set the tone for everyone that walks through that front door looking for a \"wake me up\" coffee and one of your delicious pastries."}
{"text":"French Grocery quite honestly has the name working against it imho. It's hard to find because there's no name on the building and it looks industrial on the outside and inside. The black framing doesn't seem to help either. So it's not a grocery store from what I can tell. They do seem to have really upscale, refined products - patisserie style products. And wine. Lots of it. We purchased some things to go because the atmosphere is a bit gloomy.

The space is large and airy yet seemingly without presence - kind of like industrial or empty-modern probably. Staff seemed bothered by the presence of customers, which is not unlike what you get when you don't enter a bakery in France saying \"bonjour\" except that here nobody seemed to be actually french and I definitely said hi.

Our pastries certainly had great body and full flavor though they were lacking in the main identifying ingredient, ginger in the ginger cake and pear in the pear-almond tart. The latter had a bold almond flavor though. At the price point, considering the location and the decor, I can still understand why they charge what they charge - it's french, and the recipes are undoubtedly good.

Limited parking upfront. Would have stayed to sit at the window with a cappuccino if the staff had been more welcoming. Fortunately there's a Starbucks right across the street."}
{"text":"We hoped in for a bottle of wine before dinner across the street, a very knowledgeable gentlemen from behind the counter helped is selected a bottle. It paired well with dinner and we came back for desert and coffee after dinner. The staff Is knowledgeable and friendly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"I came into the French Grocery during the first day of their soft opening. They were almost sold out of pastries, but their kitchen was furiously prepping lunch. I'm looking forward to great things coming from the French Grocery. I'm very excited that a new grocer is back, and hopefully can produce great food to keep the crowds consistently coming back for more."}
{"text":"The French Grocery gets bumped up to four stars because of its beer selection. We stopped in after work one day to pick up some dessert and were pretty disappointed. We got the genoise cake and a peanut butter tart. The tart wasn't bad (not great, but not bad), but the cake was not good. There were really no redeeming factors to the cake. It was flat and boring, not recommended at all. However, they did have some pretty good looking stuff and we are excited to go again, but we won't be repeating our dessert purchase. 

Now the beer selection is another story. They had some very interesting, very hard to find beers. One in particular called Bourbon County, was awesome. It is aged in bourbon barrels, and the tastes makes it clear it was. Amazing. Like I said before, we are disappointed by our dessert selections, but we are excited to go back and try something new. My one hope is they start offering a wider selection of goods, the space felt a little sparse, and it would be nice if it at least felt like there was more to choose from."}
{"text":"I love this place.  So far, I have only come in for the macaroons because I do not live in the area but when I am there, I frequent the taco shop next door.  The macaroons here are amazing and the flavors change regularly.  I want to try more of the menu so I will have to come up with excuses to be in the area more often :)"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I have a tradition where we order tacos from Mucho Macho and while we wait, we grab beer from the French Grocery next door since it's BYOB. We've come here a number of times for a DIY 6-pack and happily select from their craft beers in the back. 
Then we grab a few macaroons- the flavors are always different. This time we tasted the lavender berry and the absinthe. The lavender berry had great flavor but I was not a fan of the absinthe, it was just as it sounds so if you don't like the taste of licorice flavored alcohol don't order it. The macaroons aren't the best quality, I wish I could tell you they taste like little bits of heaven but in reality they taste like average macaroons that will give your sweet tooth a fix that it needs.
More importantly, the space is a combination of a grocery and dine in area. I can see how this concept may affect the ambience and experience for some diners seeking an immersive experience, but for a grocery store, the smells and selection, which are specialized in desserts, cheese, and alcohol, are fine enough for me."}
{"text":"I've been looking for French food in the valley for a while now. The food is excellent and the service was wonderful as well. Even my 2 year old ate a ton of food! Save time to browse the grocery side too. I'm excited to goo back for date night and try some of the extensive wine selection."}
{"text":"This place is such a fun find. I got the turkey and Brie sandwich that was $8. Good size, it was served on a fresh baguette with cranberry preserves and was so delicious. I also got the pommes frites which was such a great side of fries and garlic aioli. Highly recommend getting and order (or two) of those. Their iced latte was yummy as well. My friend and I shared an order of their beignets.... and oh my goodness exactly what you want in a beignet. Overall everything tasted great and I have no complaints about anything."}
{"text":"Wonderful little spot...I stopped here on my way home and had their chicory coffee and beignets which were both scrumptious. The owners are very friendly and the prices are just right. Some of their other pastries like the croissants maybe looked a little funky but they may be very good. I am a little picky with patisseries being from Europe, but they are trying so I'll give them credit for that...

French grocery also has a nice selection of imported cheeses and gelato. Their grand opening is July 9 after which they will also be having to go dinners and other items.

Check them out and try their beignets...and do make sure to ask for extra powdered sugar. It's just not the same without a grand amount of the powdered stuff...and dip the beignets in the coffee too!

All in all a very cool place. Will definitely return!"}
{"text":"I stopped by today to pick up dinner for a friend who just had a baby. One of the owners helped me with each selection, and my friend texted me to say that this was the best meal her family had in a long time. 

Stock was running low at 4:00pm, but the staff and owners are great."}
{"text":"We saw a review of French Grocery on Check Please! and decided to give it a try for dinner. I'm not a huge fan of French cuisine , but after looking at the menu I knew I'd be fine. This is more of a French/Creole style place. Our server , Willie, made our experience incredibly fun! He was very well versed in wine and did an excellent job pairing for us. To top it off, he has a really great personality that made us feel like regulars. Now, on to the food. I had Veal Sweetbreads to start and holy delicious! My mom had the Crab Canapé and I'm pretty sure it's what heaven tastes like. Brown butter, fresh crab - just divine! I had the Cassoulet with a roasted duck leg and let me tell you...decadent doesn't even begin to describe this seasonal dish. I don't even like duck and I couldn't get enough. Go give it a try!"}
{"text":"Go hsve dinner and comr here for Wine and beignets. Amazing!! I can have beignets for days. Love this cute place.

Friendly staff, and whatttt? 3 fat Beignets for $3.50? Soldddddddd"}
{"text":"The food is delish.  I had saute Duck Breast in Paris, and theres take me back to Paris.  There Fiiilet Migon is to melt in your mouth. Wine great.  My only complaint is the service.  First we call for reservations and they didn't have it.  They had only one waiiter who was slow, which was OK, but seem to forget request for salt, another glass of wine.  No bread serve with meal, which is odd since french love bread.  I took some home with me, great. Hope they can get more staff."}
{"text":"Friends took us here after a 5k run downtown, surprised that we'd never heard of this place before. They insisted we try the french press coffee and beignets, both of which were worth the trip.  

I spent half the time there deciding which wines and cheeses to take home, and then spent the rest of the next two days trying all kinds of cheeses I still can't pronounce and wasn't smart enough to write down.  Although I'm not a huge fan of desserts, there were some that looked simply amazing, and I will eventually break down and try a few."}
{"text":"My wife and I stumbled onto this little gem while driving around. It was an impulsive ooh look, let's go in. What a wonderful place. Small, friendly, unusual, creative. These are some of the words I use to describe this place. The food is amazing and different from any other place we've been. If you want a New Orleans, French inspired food, this is the place. There is a come, sit, have something to eat, drink some wine and relax philosophy here. No rush to get you out. In fact they make it a point to tell you this. Breakfast, lunch, or dinner, you have to come and check this place out."}
{"text":"This place reminds me of La Grande Orange Grocery, it's modeled in a very similar fashion. 

Food: 
1) croissant sandwich: very tasty! Highly recommend this!
2) blueberry cake: more dense but great flavor! I would totally recommend this for a good hearty dessert!
3) Macaroons: very tasty! Super delicious! Recommend getting a few of these!
4) Beignets: VERY VERY OILY. Delicious, but OILY! We didn't finish it right away and we had it in the bag, and the oil seeped through the bag and onto any surface it touched for DAYS! Don't get me wrong, it was DELICIOUS, but so much oil!
5) Salted caramel gelato: TOO too too salty. I did not like it at all. Do not recommend this flavor of gelato! 

Service: 
You order at the cashier and then bus yourself. The workers there were all very friendly and nice.

Ambiance: 
It's a hybrid of a bakery and a liquor store, very hipster-like place, it seems like it's going to be the up and coming place. 

Price: 
For the quality and taste of the food, it's very reasonably priced. 

Overall: 
I really liked this place! I would love to come back to try more bakery and food items. I would stay away from the gelato though."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been to French Grocery several times now, and don't mind making the trip from north Phoenix as this place is every bit worth it.  

For our latest meal we had the moles, which were excellent.  I found myself finishing the leftover sauce with a spoon.  We also had prawns wrapped in tasso ham for an appetizer and it was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  

For our entrees I had the shrimp étouffee, which I've had several times and love it.  My wife had the beef medallions which replaced the beef bourgeon on the menu.  She wouldn't share because she was enjoying so much.  

They have a huge selection of french wines and great beers too.  I've eaten pretty much everything on the menu and honestly every time we come, the meal gets better.  

Great ambiance, quiet and really enjoyable.  Our waiter is always cheery and welcoming and we always enjoy the conversation.  I wish we lived closer and we'd be there every week."}
{"text":"I was really wanting to like this place. I went here for a french coffee and to take a look at their baked items. I wasn't really hungry tho so I just settled for the coffee. They asked me if I'd like cream and I said yes. I am handed a cup with no cream and every sip of coffee that I could bare to take had coffee grounds in it. Unfortunately I didn't take a sip until I was far away from this place. Maybe I'll go back to try their baked goods because they did look good.... and maybe I'll try the coffee again but for now 1 star."}
{"text":"We just love the French grocery. We have had breakfast there a few times and ordered deserts and breads for family events and have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"My experience at the French Grocery was a 3 star but with full potential to move up. I went here to try a croissant. When we got there, the place was cute, still pretty empty despite having their grand opening already, but cute. The food at their deli case looked tasty and so did the gelato, but I was there for a croissant. Unfortunately they didn't have my first choice (chocolate...duh), but they had almond, so we got that and some beignets. The beignets were fine, but it wasn't one of those desserts that was just 'yummy.' I wasn't doing a dessert dance or making happy noises while eating this....it was just like a powdered sugar donut, pretty not exciting. The croissant (which I shared with a bunch of people including other Yelpers) was good, but wasn't much like a croissant. It was very dense and heavy and it wasn't flaky...the flavor was good, but the texture was all wrong. Anyway, I would try this place again, but I didn't think this first visit was anything to write home about (just something to write on Yelp about)."}
{"text":"Great little place! The beignets and croissants are the best! Very friendly girls that work there! Desserts are delicious! You can find a variety of hard to come by cheeses and wines. Great happy hour! Lunch and dinner menu's are both incredible with a nice variety of options. Get here early, it gets packed rather quickly!"}
{"text":"Wow!  Went here based on the reviews and I must disagree.  Café Du Monde you are not.  Stopped by on a Wednesday evening.  My beignets were overcooked on the outside, which should have been recognized by the color, and too thick and doughy on the inside.  Oil too hot perhaps?  So disappointed."}
{"text":"Yum!  Shrimp etouffe to die for!  Everything is fresh and fantasic. We were very impressed. Prices are great too."}
{"text":"This place smells wonderful. When I went I ordered a cappuccino and an éclair. It was delicious. It also looks like they have some options for lunch and they have coolers where you can grab your wine.

You order at the counter and the  staff was patient, friendly, and fast. We were able to find a table and sit and talk for a while without anyone bothering us. The only thing is that I wish they had more seating and more comfortable seating. Other than that our experience was great. I'm definitely coming back for a baguette."}
{"text":"This place has so much promise, but two visits later and still not impressed. First time I went was back in December for lunch, got a croque Madame - it was just ok, not very memorable. 

Came in again today, admittedly was a bit of an off time just after 3:30. I had just missed their lunch menu and now it was happy hour. But wait, I can't get happy hour items to go, so no food right now. This could be understandable, but there three different people behind the counter telling me different things. Woman at checkout visibly confused by what I can order when, another guy cooking trying to bend the rules for me and say I could get something and a third guy overriding both of them telling me very specifically that it is now happy hour but only if I eat there. And then finally saying they have salads and sandwiches to go. That's all I was asking for! Except there are no sandwiches left, just some salads that don't look great. No thanks.

Full disclosure, have not had any of the baked goods which do look amazing, but at 3:30 there were hardly any left anyways. This place seems to not know what it wants to be, wine bar, bakery, restaurant, French deli...trying to be all of the above and not successfully doing any of it."}
{"text":"Interesting concept w/good food & beer/wines choices. Reasonable prices but not enough servers the nite we were there. Worth trying ps a nice alternative to lgoNo!!"}
{"text":"Such a cute little shop. There's a nice extensive wine section and you can enjoy a bottle in the shop or to go.

We tried the beignets and they were AMAZING. I cannot emphasize how good they were. Go on a day where you don't care about your diet and just enjoy these gorgeous, fried, delicious, magical treats. You get three in an order, and you can easily split the order with two other people so that you each get one.

We got a baguette to go which was also delish. I really want to try their dine in menu and other dessert items."}
{"text":"The most amazing pastries! The cinnamon rolls are literally the most delicious treat I've ever consumed! I wish they were open on Sunday morning. Oh and the wines! Mon dieu!"}
{"text":"We arrived after 1pm for lunch.
There was a line.  
After waiting to order for about 5 min.  our order was taken.

We waited a long time for our food, but the glass of white house wine held us over.

Constant companion had the shrimp po' boy, very good.  I had the uptowner, also very good and pomme frites with garlic aioli, also very good.

But the beignets were a bit under done.  We cut off the edges on two and left the third in an order of three.

This is not fast food.  Come when you have time.

The cheese counter looked amazing as did yhe desserts!  I will try it the next time.

Oh, another 5 minute wait to buy wine and bread.  But both are so good!

Be patient, it is very good."}
{"text":"A great uptown gem. Pastries are delicious; the coffee is fantastic, and staff is nice and helpful. Outstanding wine selection."}
{"text":"Very cute but no one speaks French. Macarons are sub par. Not airy or light enough - very dense and no \"melt in your mouth\" feel. Sad for à french teacher :("}
{"text":"Stopped in by chance decided to try it out. Well for starters the menu is simple looked like some tasty  appetizers as well as dinner and the wine looked tasty. The dinner looked pricy for the place since I have never been there before so we just stuck with the appetizers. They turned out perfectly. Some of The wine I have not tried prior to going there. 
Well two thumbs up well done the appetizers were perfect and the wine recommendation fit it perfectly. 
Great place casual easy going laid back great place it made a nice impression to my date as well as myself. Definitely going back will have to try out the dinner next time."}
{"text":"Why has it taken me so long to review French Grocery?!?! This place is truly a gem and a terrific addition to the neighborhood. Everything I've eaten here has been terrific: macaron parisien , out of this world (I've taken them to several parties and they are always a smash); muffuletta sandwich, divine; French bread, fantastic; beignets, awesome; praline bacon, heavenly (and I scored a free order by flashing my bacon tattoo). Their selection of cheeses is pretty good, too. The grab-n-go sandwiches have been a wonderful change to my normal work lunch, at about half the cost of eating out downtown."}
{"text":"What an amazing little place. I can't wait to go back. Their crepes and French Pressed coffee are heavenly. All of their desserts looked amazing."}
{"text":"The French bread is great with a nice crust. The beignets are the best. Fried fresh to order."}
{"text":"Great pastries & service. Love having it in my 'hood. Wished they'd paint the outside of their bldg."}
{"text":"Came in here late on a weekend- so glad we did! The macaroons are amazing, probably the best I've had. They weren't dry at all like other places, and the filling was just enough to really bring the flavor around. I tried the chocolate, raspberry, vanilla, and salted caramel. Honestly, I loved every flavor! I am definitely going to make this my go-to treat spot!"}
