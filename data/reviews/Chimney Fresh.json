{"text":"Chimney Fresh is still fairly young so there's some problems. Service is very slow so bear in mind when you come you will have to wait a minimum of 10-15 minutes for someone to take your order. There's two waitresses usually but apparently they can only handle one table at a time. We have been the third table a couple times and this seems to cause service to slow to a crawl. 

Also, many items on the menu don't seem to be available with no explanation given. One day we can order a cheese Dosa, another day they just won't make one. It doesn't really make any sense.

The food itself is pretty high quality though so it's worth coming at least once. The hours are unreliable though, the owners will close if they feel they don't have business during the listed business hours so it's hard to know if they are just not answering their phone or if they have closed. 

Also, there is a problem with communication with the servers in that, even repeating the same order multiple times, you're never sure if they actually understood. Your order has a decent chance of getting messed up. 

Overall, it's a nice place that needs some crucial improvements but everyone is friendly and the food is great for a fair price. It's worth a try but it can be a bit of a frustrating experience."}

We just had dinner at Chimney Fresh and it was delicious!. Each dish was made to order. We had the Kerala porota, king fish fry, beef ulliyarthiya (beef dry fry), mutton biryani, chicken dosa - crispy, samiya paysam and 2 Madras coffee. 

The fish fry was crisp, with a hint of spice and just fresh and delish. i had read reviews on the porota and have had porota in many restaurants but nothing compares to the flavor here..reminded me of home! Chicken and dosa, not a flavor I expected to go together...the spicy chicken with a hint of sweetness pared so well with the crispy dosa. The mutton biryani, paysam and coffee were all authentic and flavorful. 

Overall, the dishes and the vibe here was warm and friendly. The owner, George and Jobi were inviting and pleasant and passionate about the business. George came out to check on us and the meal...he explained that all their spices are made in house including their clarified butter...crazy right in the most awesome way! A night that was a let's just check this place out turned into an amazing foodie delight! Looking forward to going back with more of my fam and friends"}

{"text":"The craving for Kerala food lead me to this place. Since their number and website was not working I assumed they were closed. But to my surprise they were fully open and functioning.  Their food was delicious. We ordered , chicken curry, beef fry, chicken biriyani, and king fish curry. The food was was very flavourful, and authentic. I would highly recommend this place. The owner is is very pleasant and it was a great experience from start to finish."}
{"text":"Ordered cheese dosas, mussel fry and a fish dosa. Out of this world Fresh flavors from Kerala. I would definitely recommend this small homey restaurant.

The Chef introduced himself to all patrons and he happens to have years of experience with the Taj hotel in Mumbai, etc.

Now they are a start up so be prepared to wait. They need additional staff serving guests. But take-out seemed to move smoothly..."}
