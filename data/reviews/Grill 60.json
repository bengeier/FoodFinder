{"text":"Went for breakfast on Mother's Day.  Started with fantastic spicy Bloody Mary drinks and the 3 of us ordered something different on the menu with 3 additional side orders.  All the breakfasts served promptly were delicious.  Total bill all 3 was under $50.00 including drinks.  The service and atmosphere along with the view of the golf course through the glass wall made the best experience we could have had for the holiday.  No loud atmosphere here!  You can actually carry on a conversation, unlike some of the other down down restaurants.  We have returned to Grill 60 numerous times since and have had different items for lunch.  Favorite wings in town by far are Earl's smoked wings.  Pick any sandwich.  You will not be disappointed.  This restaurant is located on the golf course and shares the newly remodeled building with the San Marcos Pro Shop.  It is soon to be discovered by the heavy lunch crowd in downtown Chandler, making it a hidden treasure for now.   I have lived in Chandler since 1972, and make it a point to shop Chandler.  I have patronized all the restaurants in the downtown Chandler area, and have found Grill 60 to be our favorite for breakfast and lunch."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and I was very impressed with everything from the service to the food itself to the gorgeous view of the golf course.   The breakfast burrito is my personal favorite, especially with the chorizo!  The food tastes fresh and delicious and the breakfast potatoes are AMAZING as wel, crispy on the outside and full of flavor."}
{"text":"Breakfast sandwich is amazing, but when it came to the breakfast burrito, I can't even imagine they still serve that. It was so horrible, please if you value your life do not get the burrito!"}
{"text":"This is a chill restaurant right beside the Golf course in Chandler. They offer patio and inside seating. They have a full bar, a nice couch and a couple big screen TV's.   We tried the Jimmy Stewart burger and added mushrooms to it. It was really good for a classic burger. I had fries as a side and they were very good. We also tried the Clark Gable with a side of onion rings and it was everything a patty melt should be.   We also tried their Bloody Mary and it was just enough spice. Very good.   The very best part? The price. Super reasonable and amazing service. We will definitely be back."}
