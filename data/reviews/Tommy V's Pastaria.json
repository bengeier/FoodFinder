{"text":"Unimpressed.  Pizza by the slice is a reheated slice of cold pizza.  The crust was like cardboard.  If you are not going to offer fresh slices, don't offer pizza by the slice."}
{"text":"Tommy V's is a great little Italian restaurant.  The pizza is phenomenal and has a very distinct taste that separates it from other local shops in the area.  Having only tried the pizza, I will be sure to come back and try the rest of the menu.  Tommy's has a customer for life!"}
{"text":"I travel a lot and eat at a lot of new places. I'm rarely compelled go review. This place makes a fantastic pizza. It has all the charm and character an Italian place should and almost everything is made on house daily.   Check this place out !"}
{"text":"Pizza that is different from the norm. Square, not round. The crust is a little thicker than average and is baked nice and crispy on the outside. Nice tangy sauce with a generous amount of toppings. Mozzarella topping seems to be fresh, not frozen. Can be a little messy to eat when it is hot out of the oven. My favorite thing about this pizza is that it is also excellent when it is cold. I always order a large so I have some for the next day! 

The place has a few booths if you want to eat in but it is mainly a take out restaurant. Friendly staff and very clean inside. I cannot attest to the other menu items as the pizza is so good that is all I order."}
{"text":"Awesome food.  Love their food; love the eggplant.  My mom loves their wedding soup.  Everything is homemade, especially the bread.  If you love authentic Italian food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"My wife and I just had a quick bite at Tommy V's and really enjoyed it.  This place only has a few booths so most of their business must be carryout.

We ordered a large dinner salad to share and a Italian beef sub with Rapini (fried greens).  We shared that also which was plenty.  Salads were really fresh and the sandwich had a lot of lean tasty beef with plenty of greens on top.  Really good sandwich!  Ordered a bottled iced tea and water all for under $20 bucks.  Good value, nice people, and really good food.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Pizza is very good.  Not as good as Mama Santa in Little Italy or Edison's in Tremont, but good.  Chicken parm is good and extra cheesy .  Agree with other Yelpers... Get carryout and don't dine in.  If you do not like black olives tell them to 86 them if you order a salad.  The salad is loaded with them.  The red wine vinaigrette salad dressing is super.  The disappointing thing?  No grilled chicken.  All chicken is breaded.  All pasta is made fresh and in- house.  Gluten-free pasta is not offered."}
{"text":"This is very clean, mostly to-go, restaurant with a small dining area. The Eggplant Parmesan was the best that I ever had!  They raved about the Mom's cheesecake, but I was not a fan.  This is a special restaurant with a focus on Italian.  I think they do an admirable job."}
{"text":"one day I will get their pasta. but I can't stop getting the pizza. it's the best in the area period. Not sure what it is, the sauce, the cheese, the toppings, or the dough, but it's fabulous. Try the large deluxe well done. Or pepperoni and onions well done. And grab a loaf of the pepperoni bread."}
{"text":"This is a great little carryout place.  (-- correction, they do have a few booths but it's mostly  a carryout place).  My friend turned me onto this place, they order carryout from here twice a month.  The staff was friendly and  like the other reviewer said the place was clean. I know they call it a \"Pastaria\" but honestly,  I liked their pizza and salad better than i liked their pasta.  The pizza was awesome, ummmm-- i'm thinking about it now.  Nothing mind blowing but very rememberable.  The pasta was under done (and i like al dente) but that could've been because I waiting for the food in the store.  I'm definitely going back for the pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza was Delicious, perfect crust and quality meat toppings. I favor Guido's pizza in Chesterland, grew up there. The pizza at Tommy V's is same high quality. Hope both Pizza Restaurants Live on in both areas."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today. First impression is it is very nice, clean pizzaria. The staff is very kind and friendly. I ordered the italian beef sandwich, it was loaded with perfectly cooked beef on fresh made seeded roll with a healthy portion of giardiniera. I also ordered a slice of the eat your spinach pie. The toppings were fresh and delicious. The crust was cooked perfectly. You can tell everything is made fresh daily and they really care about their product. What a wonderful experience I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and amazing staff. Supper friendly. Had pizza and Alfredo with chicken. Clearly all home made, delicious."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza! Found this place because I was in the plaza to pick up carryout from another restaurant there. Ordered a large pizza with sausage, meatballs, eggplant and onion. OMG so good!  It was pricey ($19), but full of toppings, sauce and cheese.  I was surprised when I picked up the pizza - it was heavy!  Best pizza I've had in a while.  Tasty sauce, fresh dough; medium thick yet light and slightly crispy on the edges. Definitely try you will not be disappointed.  We also ordered Fettuccine Alfredo with Lemon Chicken. Homemade pasta? Check!  Alfredo sauce was ok; pasta and chicken very good.  Next time will try the Italian beef which looked amazing."}
{"text":"The pastas and sauce are made fresh daily.  So you know they are serious about what they do.  Nothing is lacking in quality here.  The sauce is not heavily seasoned and is more acidic than sweet.  Basic and very good.

With all the sub shops in the area, they are the only one I've found that serves a true Italian beef sandwich.  Slow braised for hours with hot or mild peppers on a fresh loaf.  If you want cheese, just ask because for some reason it's not included.

The dinners are sized either \"small plate\" or \"regular portion\".  The regular portion can easily serve 2 people with 2 generous pieces of chicken parmesan, a ton of pasta and slices of fresh bread.

The best thing about Tommy V's is they are not another corporate chain.  Just simple and authentic."}
{"text":"I just had an inedible lunch at Tommy V's so I can't give it more than one star.  

I ordered one of the \"fast lunch\" specials - the eggplant parm sub.  As a person who eats eggplant regularly, I can distinguish between good eggplant and tough, oily eggplant.  Guess which kind was on my sandwich?  Ugh.  

If anyone working at the restaurant had asked me how my meal was, I would have let them know how disappointed I was with it.  But the place was busy and super crowded, so I didn't have an opportunity to.  

If you'd like to try out the food at Tommy V's (you can try anything once, right?  my friend's meatball pasta was good, from what he said), I suggest that you get take out.  There are a few small tables next to the counter, but this restaurant is definitely not set up for more than a couple people to be eating at one time."}
{"text":"Thank you Tommy V's for making a fantastic square pizza.  The edge and corner pieces are the best.  Nice and crispy from the high wall pan that it is baked in.  Crust not too thick, right amount of sauce, cheese and tasty sausage.  One of my favorite items to order.

I've also had the chicken parm sandwich and eggplant sandwiches.  The bread is crusty on the outside and fresh soft on the inside.  Whether you choose the chicken or eggplant, both are sliced thin and nicely breaded.  A really tasty marinara sauce with some melted cheese sets the sandwiches up for wonderful flavor.

I always enjoy getting takeout from here."}
{"text":"Best red sauce in town! So amazing, definitely not from a can! Tommy wakes up every morning to put this sauce together and you can tell! Fresh bread, noodles, sauce and pizza makes for a great place for lunch or dinner. Have a party, great catering options too! 

Nothing like this place in Cleveland, this is truly a gem! If you are driving through stop in! You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Tommy, I must admit your food is excellent. The marinara is great, the Italian beef is delicious, the bread is fresh and done just right, and the meatball sub I tried was top tier. There is only one area of this business that needs improvement, and that is the customer service. You have some of the best food on the east side but you really need to be a little more upbeat and friendly with your customers. I thought I might have caught you on a bad day, but after several visits you just don't seem to enjoy any interaction with your customers...if that's the case, please hire someone who will give a more positive experience at the counter, it would make a world of difference and keep people coming back."}
{"text":"We came in on a Friday to sit down at lunch and the pizza and salads(with chicken) were cooked to order. Everyone was happy with their meals. And we all purchased the pizza bread next to the register when we left too for a mid day carb snack :)"}
{"text":"I was in town on business and found this place on yelp. I ordered the chicken parm. The portion was huge and it tasted okay, but a bit bland. Not sure if it was supposed to be, but the sauce was real watery. Overall, not impressed and will skip this place in the future."}
{"text":"Went with the chicken parm on suggestion of the employees. The bread is amazing and so is the marinara that goes on it! The chicken is the only down fall. It reminds me of the fake subway chicken. Will return for something I suspect is much better!"}
{"text":"I just went into Tommy V's for the first time since I moved to the neighborhood a couple weeks ago. I'm a pretty happy guy, quick with a smile type. I walk in and smile and say, \"Hi, I'm Mike, I'm new to the area. I saw your sign outside for an Italian beef sandwich, what's that?\" You'd think this would be a golden opportunity for the guy (who turns out to be the owner) to get to know a new customer with the potential for many returns. But no, this guy looks up like I'm bothering him. Is he mad? Upset? Bad day? Long week? I'm not sure but I know he wasn't very friendly. He says, \"I'll show you what the beef looks like.\" I gotta say, it looked good. I ordered a sandwich. While he was assembling the sandwich I asked if he owned the place and he said he did. Still not introducing himself to his new customer. He rolls the sandwich up, hands it to me and walks away. Never even thanked me or even look me in the eye. Thankfully the guy at the register was very nice. He thanked me for coming in and said he hoped to see me again. In the car the sandwich smelled amazing. I returned home and split it with my friend and my mother. We all thought that it was good. We all think it was a bit bland and would have loved melted mozzarella but to be honest I didn't ask if they would put cheese on it and they didn't offer. I also thought that the meat was very lean and dried out quickly. Listen, Tommy, there are A LOT of other choices for Italian in Mayfield. I don't like being treated unkindly, especially by the owner. Like I said, the sandwich was good but not any better than across the street where they are very nice the food is good and always make their customers feel like number one."}
{"text":"Met the actual Tommy V running the kitchen while dining on my chicken parm. This place is super comfy and I think the owner is the reason why this place rocks. Offers the traditional Italian menu. I think the quality of the sauce determines your destiny and his is in the high quality ranks. Asked for more sauce to douse my chicken I just couldn't get enough. Sauce was a medium consistency, good balance of herbs. Pasta al dente. Chicken patty moist and tender on the inside. Didn't get to try anything else but had my eye on his pasta fagioli."}
