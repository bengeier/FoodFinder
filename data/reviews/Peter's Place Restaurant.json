{"text":"Came here for a quick lunch while in town on business. Has your typical diner options (chicken fingers, grilled cheese, BLTs) and a few Chinese food options. Food was ready quickly, the location was clean and food was what I expected for a quick diner lunch."}
{"text":"I work in the area and love to pop in to pick up lunch regularly.  Lynn is great, she bought the business a few years back but has worked there for at least 10 years.  The restaurant is basically a greasy spoon diner...set up more cafeteria-like though. the food is what you would expect, burgers, sandwiches, soup, fries, etc.  They also offer hot daily specials like stew, lasagna and beef dip etc.  The Chinese and Vietnamese food they make are great too.  added perk..Free Wi-Fi available to all customers!  Keep up the great work Lynn!"}
{"text":"Came here about two years ago and got their Chinese lunch special. It was not good. Really just not good.  Decided today to give them another try only to find that they are gone. The beauty supply place next door has expanded into this space."}
{"text":"In all honesty, this is another of those places I would rate it more as a 2.5 than a 2.  Just like other greasy spoons, this particular place was apparently one of the more legendary ones run by a Peter just up to retiring in 2011, and sold to a chinese immigrant couple.  They've tried though to keep up the menu and the standards as I've heard, though when I went there for breakfast, I didn't see anything especial really.  Again, one of those local greasy spoon restos I like to go to every do often, the food is filling, inexpensive, and very very greasy (be prepared to pat it down with napkins).  It has a bit of a different type of layout, looking like a cafeteria style, but don't bother walking around like it is one, just go straight to the cash and order.  Maybe when it's busier at lunch, since it is surrounded by garages, offices and warehouses of all sorts, maybe you would have to line up but as I was the only one there....  Breakfast and coffee will set you back around $7, which is one of the more expensive of the greasy spoons.  Considering that the Century Casino (former the Silver Dollar) is just a few blocks down with a $2.99 breakfast, I can't imagine it being particularly good for business.  Still, if it's something you want that's simple, then here's as good as any other such resto in it's class.    They also offer the usual mix of sandwiches, burgers and so on, muffins from Costco for takeout and actually fairly decent coffee.  I only wish I had a chance to try it when the legendary Peter was around.  #37 of Yelp's 30-Day Review Challenge"}
