{"text":"Blanchards deli is insanely amazing and left me speechless! This place makes my mouth water every single time I even think about it, its so good i cant drive by it unless I can stop and eat there. The hours of operation are the worst part of blanchards  because they are way to short so there is definitely room for improvement there, but the prices are fair and the food is delicious! The breakfasts are outstanding (my preferance out of their breakfast meals is the one that comes with bacon, eggs, toast, and hash browns), but my favorite out of their menu is the lunches. I could go to Blanchards Deli and order their two chili cheese dogs and a side of fried okra for the rest of my life. I would never get sick of it and would be perfectly content. If you get the chance, are hungry, just stopping by the shell, or are just close by and want some good food that will make you smile then don't hesitate just go to blanchards deli. The service is probably the best part of their entire dining experience. They get the food to you in a timely manner. Every time I have eaten at Blanchards there was a woman working the counter and a woman working the kitchen. So I'm not sure if they have any other employees, but those two ladies are very very nice and courteous. They are very good at there job, and do nothing but impove the already great atmosphere to enjoy your amazing meal in. I'm not hired by them, they did not ask me to say anything, didn't pay me to say anything, this is my genuine opinion. Like I said this is MY OPINION. If you don't agree with my opinion then that is your opinion and no reason to be rude. If you do have a bad review for this place then you did not even eat at the same place I did! Thank you very much for taking time to read my review, and I really hope I achieved my goal of helping you decide where to eat and helping you make an informed decision! Seriously at least try this place!! I promise you will not be disappointed. You will be thanking me! I don't know anyone who has tried blanchards and not turned into a regular customer with the employees remembering your name and asking if you want the usual(:"}
