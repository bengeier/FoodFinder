{"text":"I believe this restaurant, even though new, is now closed.  I had made a 1pm reservation today on Open Table, showed up on time (actually a few minutes early), only to find the door locked, lights out, and \"open\" sign unlit.  Looked inside and saw no signs of life--only an Uber Eats bag sitting on a bench.  The writing on the door clearly stated they were open today 11am to 9pm, but at 12:50pm, there is no sign anyone had been in the restaurant anytime recently.  There were no signs posted to advise what was going on.  What is irritating is that I had a reservation and drove from the other side of town to have lunch here (40 minutes round trip), only to have to drive back home because there were no other suitable restaurants around and the nightmare construction and barriers on Independence made it too much of a hassle to try to explore anything else.  Huge waste of time.  Even if it had been open, though, the area is sketchy and likely would not have warranted another visit.  In the 2 minutes that I stood outside trying to figure out if the restaurant was open, there was a group of 3 men standing outside a tattoo shop next door loudly using all kinds of vulgar language.  Not a good atmosphere so I won't even attempt to go back,"}
{"text":"I went in and was greeted right away. I asked a couple of questions and ordered the special with extra veggies. I don't eat sweet carrots but I got them anyway on the side for my grandson to eat. The staff even brought some out for him to try while we waited for my to go order. I was given a flyer and a coupon. I was also told they deliver. The place looked clean and the decor looked nice.   I came home and my food was still very warm.  It was good but a little pricey for the portion and taste. I will try again but during lunch for a cheaper price."}
{"text":"This restaurant replaces Fu Lin, and they have done a fine job on the inside. It looks quite nice. What has not improved much, if at all, is the menu. It has two selections that are essentially the same.  You select your meal: chicken, steak, etc. On one side you can choose to get the entree, which is simply the protein and rice. On the other you get what they seem to label a combination, which includes veggies (perhaps two veggies instead of just one) and the like. But when I asked about the difference (namely including a heftier price), they did indicated that they were the same.  While the staff is friendly, and happy to oblige requests, be careful about substituting. For instance, if you don't like carrots, and ask for more zucchini, they will do so but charge you for the option, and you won't get much in exchange. Want more onions? No problem, but that will be another charge too.  And they seem busy handling Uber Eats, with no one (other than us) at the tables. Not sure if this is a good sign or a bad one, but it is what it is."}
