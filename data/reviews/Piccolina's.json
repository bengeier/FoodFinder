{"text":"This was the most fabulous place.  It was very romantic especially outside.  The food was incredible.  We both had the Virginia Spots with Crab and it was superb."}
{"text":"First, the average age is 70+ on a Saturday night.  That being said, the food is actually very very good."}
{"text":"Food was average. Service was ok. Prices excessive. Caters to the senior citizen crowd. Will likely not go back."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner Saturday! Awesome salmon special with a honey glaze on top.  Love the balsamic glazed brussels sprouts and bacon appetizer. Another favorite is the eggplant stack.
No room for desert but managed to enjoy the homemade limoncello shot.  Service was awesome! Thank you Alli! We will be back soon."}
{"text":"Went here by myself last night for a late dinner and a glass of wine at the bar.  Wait staff was really friendly.  The bartender Pat is fabulous.  I heard they recently got a new chef who is working some magic in the kitchen.  I ordered the Fresh Pappardelle, which has braised duck.  I LOVE braised duck!  It was a nice ragu duck sauce over fresh al dente wide pasta.  I think I would have preferred a smaller pasta noodle that I didn't have to cut with a fork, but it was still very good.  Then, to top off a good meal, they serve a complimentary homemade Limoncello.  But this is not typical limoncello, this is a sweet cream limoncello that has been in the freezer.  It was heavenly.  They recently started serving Brunch too.  Which is great since I live so close.  I will be visiting Pat at the bar more often on nights where I work late."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience! Pizza and salads are very delicious!  Desert is also great!"}
{"text":"The food was absolutely incredible! We didn't have to wait at all, which was surprising because the restaurant was packed. I was so delightfully surprised with this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my Birthday. Since we have dined 
Here before, and it was superb, we thought we would give it another try.
Since we didn't have lunch. We were early at 5:00.
I had my suspicions when our car was the only one in the parking lot.
When we walked in to an empty dining area,
I knew it wasn't going to be memorable.
And was I so correct.
My prime rib was loaded with fat, and tough
As shoe leather. The mashed potatoes were
Runny and cold on the bottom. Snap peas were
Definitely frozen.
My wife had crab cakes. Cold as the outside
Was. She took them home anyway.
The bread was good and my manhattan was very 
good. I heard they were going out of business.
I think it's time."}
{"text":"Why did I never try this before?! We live in USC and I just assumed it was just another cheesy(no pun intended) italian restaurant. 
The food quality and execution is amazing!! We used them to cater a usc function and the quality was so amazing that even the small amount of leftovers were better the next day!!
Chicken Romano was battered so lightly but had so much flavor and juiciness!! The tomato basil pasta was so much better for a crowd than just boring marinara!! The kids are the small amount of leftovers that evening!!
We live I. USC and will be including this in our regular list of restaurants now!!"}
{"text":"surprisingly very good. We will be back! But the atmosphere is horrendous- so outdated. If they spruced it up in there it would be more popular!"}
{"text":"We decided to go to Piccolina's for our 10th anniversary dinner, because in years past we had really good food here., plus it was convenient to our home. Well, what a big disappointment. The one star was for the scallop appetizer, which was delicious. Also, our waitress was very good. It wasn't her fault the food was horrible. The salads came, which they should have been embarrassed to serve. Basically the lettuce was not fresh , one grape tomatoes split in half, one olive and one pepper. I could have opened a bag of salad at home, which would have been better. 
I had the limoncello shrimp with risotto, which was so sweet, I should have dipped it in my water. I couldn't even finish it. Believe me, if I don't clean my plate you know it's bad. 
My husband had the spots with crab, which is one of our favorites. But this dish was unseasoned and flavorless. Not sure if Piccolinas got a new chef, they really need to reevaluate what they are serving. Yuk!"}
{"text":"We recently celebrated my parents 50th wedding anniversary here in their private dinning area. From the appetizers to all of the items put out on the buffet everything was excellent, and reasonably priced. The staff was equally impressive from the planning stages to the end of the evening. I don't think I could've had a better experience anywhere else. It was a fantastic party!"}
{"text":"Our family had filets for some and crab cakes for others. Food was fantastic! Excellent wine list. And limoncello is complimentary. Rebecca was server and did a great job."}
{"text":"Used to be good but in the past five years has gone down hill. Over priced, sell Tilapia and call it Spots
Outdated, needs revamped"}
{"text":"Going down hill. Service was fine but asked to substitute pasta for polenta on a salmon dish and the waitress said fine. Put unwanted risotto  on the dish and charged extra for pasta. Salmon was ok. Wouldn't have a problem other than the waitress misinforming. Also had the Virginia spots. The fish tasted as if it was a week old. Mush with zero flavor. The white sauce tasted of paste. Even the bread was stale and downhill from rolls that were normal in the past. The place was empty so no excuse of the kitchen being swamped. Have been eating here for over 10 years and will give it one more chance."}
{"text":"I will not be returning after the way we were mistreated by the manager. My mother ordered the surf and turf and she ordered the filet well done and came out medium inside so it was sent back to be cooked again. When she finally ate a piece it tasted like blood. We alerted our waitress, who was very sweet and attentive, that my mom could order something else and it would be comped, she ordered soup. When the bill came, her filet was still on the bill and when brought to the managers attention she said my mom ate the meal (with a sassy attitude) so she didn't take it off and she had to check with the server to see if it was in fact eaten or not. Why were we told it would be comped? The manager didn't even see my moms plate and accused her of eating all of it, because she's overweight? She ate the vegetables and gave the shrimp to my brother which was 2-3 pieces (rip off for a $30 surf and turf meal). If it was such a big deal the manager should have come over herself to check on the plate! She comes back to say it's not worth fighting over and decides to take it off.  The manager had a bad attitude about the whole ordeal which we didn't appreciate. 

Aside from that, most of our meals were ok, doesn't seem to be worth the price for the quality you get or quantity."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner with a group of 10 and I think we were the youngest people there. The service was good, our waitress was attentive and the menu had quite a few vegetarian options. Portions were huge, taste was average (except for the pumpkin gnocchi - that was awesome) and it was a bit pricey. The place was pretty loud too but that was expected because there were large groups on a Friday night. All in all it was good."}
{"text":"I wrote a review 2 years ago.  Went to Piccolina's last evening.  The service was efficient and pleasant.  The big disappointment was cold rolls taken straight of the bag to basket.  They were stale and crumbled on the plate.  The spots were very good but the polenta was just dumped on the plate and luke warm.  This restaurant is not like it used to be a few years back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I both had dinner here for the first time tonight. We sat at the bar, as we usually do. Angie took care of us and she was great! We talked, laughed, and joked the whole time. The food was excellent, as well. He got the strip steak and I had crab cakes. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We were meeting a couple there for a holiday business dinner, and were seated immediately.  Then our server disappeared for a half hour.  No drinks, no order taken.  We usually would have left, but the other couple had recommended the place, so we waited.  We had to ask someone to take our orders.  Then she wouldn't leave us alone for more than five minutes.  Unfortunately, the bartender doesn't even know how to make a good vodka + cranberry.  Really?   There was a long brown hair in my stuffed peppers, and the entree, I literally could not stomach.  Very bad on all levels.  Will NOT be back."}
{"text":"A bit on the pricy side but GREAT service! Food was good nothing over the top. Sat outside watched the ducks and wait staff feed them although there is a sign posted not to, lol. Nice little place close to home!"}
