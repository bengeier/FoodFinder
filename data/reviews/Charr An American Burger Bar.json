{"text":"$13 for a 1/3 lb cheese burger. $6 fries? This place was waaay overpriced for 7th st and thunderbird area. $5.50 for a bottled beer? This place was absolutely terrible. I knew it was trouble when I saw a raw bar five feet from the bathrooms."}
{"text":"A couple weeks ago I was starving and decided to stop in and grab a bite mid afternoon. I ordered this amazing chicken sandwich that had zucchini, grilled onions, cheese an some other delicious veggies. It was literally the best sandwich I ever had. The only problem was that it had so many wonderful veggies on it that it kept falling out of the bread which I was fine with! I also had the sweet potato fries which were perfect and the bar tender made me the perfect Moscow mule. They have s ton of shakes as well and was gonna come back for one but I was just so full. My eyes were larger than my stomach. Totally am going back. Quaint atmosphere. Great food. Great service"}
{"text":"Worst  experience  ever!! The hostess was rude. The waitress was rude and the manager Joe was worse!  I think Amy's Bakery has met its match! The food was as bad as the service."}
{"text":"Just left charr. Had a great burger at the bar. service was good, food was good and I will diffently come back."}
{"text":"I don't understand why people knock charr it's the only place in north phoenix that has a great drink menu and there food is goodn"}
{"text":"My favorite, the Mac n Cheese n Bacon Burger, is hard to beat. The Blue Lemonade is my favorite drink. Highly recommended. Joe and the boys, Brian, in particular, do an amazing job. I love this place! Their onion rings are home-made, too. Good stuff."}
{"text":"I ate at Charr Burger a few months ago and recommended it to a friend a couple days ago. The burgers are outstanding. Tasty, creative, plenty of food for a grown man. The atmosphere is open with a slightly loud operational noise vibe. The service I had was great. The waitress and bar keep both went out of their way to take care of us. Remember its a two way street. A friend and I went for a late dinner and they let us close the place down without any hassle. Cant wait to go back for a more reasonably timed dinner soon."}
{"text":"Wow. Stupid good. Amazing burger/sliders and buffalo sammy. Truffle fries and ask for garlic aioli and dont miss the garlic chili wings... each one as big as your arm.  Come here now. Only negative is... hmmm no real negatives. Improvements: serve wedge on bigger plate. Blue cheese with wings instead of ran ch. Pretty good when that is the worst I had. To top it off... nothing left to go, that good. Deliver to my house. We WILL be back. Brian rocks too!"}
{"text":"Used them for delivery and I was highly upset with the overall experience. Looked at their menu to order crab cakes and pork tenderloin. I get a call to advise me they are out of pork tenderloin. So I order their ribs. I asked if everything else is okay and they said yes but told me the ribs cost $3 more (they could of waived that). Then 5 minutes later I get a call stating they are out of crab cakes. Again 5 minutes ago I asked if everything else was okay.  First it took over an hour for my food to get delivered Then I get my ribs (not even what I originally wanted ) and I would say I was and am very underwhelmed. This will be my first and last time I would eat at Charr unless they can pull a rabbit out of their hat."}
{"text":"My husband and I had dinner here tonight and were very pleased.  I had a wonderful salmon dish and my husband had the Phoenix burger that he said was the best burger he's had in a long time.  The service was very good and very warm and friendly."}
{"text":"Best burgers, truffle fries, and garlic chili wings!!! We LOVE going! Staff is excellent and kids eat free on Tuesdays. Whenever my parents come to visit they make sure to eat here. Just try it and I promise you will become a regular as well. Again....try the wings and fries...can't envision anyone being disappointed. They are the new standard we measure all wings and fries against now."}
{"text":"Best flavor chili chicken wings when not overcooked. Delicious with ranch. I keep going back just for these! Could do with providing finger tip bowls or wipes though, the sauce gets all over your face. Yummy!"}
{"text":"Well I finally got around to doing a writeup on charr. The reviews here seem mixed so I had to check it out for myself. The first thing I noticed was the setup -- the multi-color backlit bar and the nice flat-screen LED tvs. I'm a big football fan so I will be sure to come by to eat and never miss a game!   I came for dinner and was seated very quickly by the hostess. Menu had a wide selection of appetizers, salads, soups and drinks. Went for the charrburger with some custom toppings to my liking, beer on tap, and crab cakes to start. Some other reviews mentioned about price but having sampled other places in phoenix like Delux  I found the prices to be quite on par. More on what I think of the value later.  I got my crab cakes to start and they were excellent! Very moist, tasty and hit the spot. Next was my burger and it was quite a burger. The garlic knot bun turns out to be the differentiator between the other joints I ate at so I give charr the nod on the taste of the burgers. I thought the food was excellent and certainly of the best I have had.  Whether it is charr or the other burger places I sampled that serve high quality gourmet burgers, I think the price is very reasonable. This is not processed meat and the quality of the food, the ambiance where I can kick back and watch the games on the flat screen tvs and hang with my buddies makes it well worth the price. I dont plan on coming every night but at the end of a hard week of work it's nice to have a place to hang with both my buddies and colleagues for some drinks and/or food. If I want a cheap burger I can always get a big mac at the other end of the mall but I always regret it later when I choose fast food over quality.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal and the atmosphere and the service. I liked the other burger joints I have been trying as well but give the nudge to charr. I'd say try it out for yourself. Tip: waited at the bar for buddies to arrive afterwards for drinks and surprisingly found some cool outlets right under the bartop I could charge my pda while waiting. Very hard to find outlets to charge my phone while I am out so this was a nice bonus! They are kind of hidden under the counter so not sure this is well known!"}
{"text":"From other reviews, this is a hit-or-miss place.  As Charr is near where we live and restaurant choices are not very good, we gave this try on a Wednesday night.  Easy parking.  Great ambiance.  Nice patio with a fire pit.  Got seated promptly.  Good start.  Water came.  Weren't familiar with the menu so we didn't order immediately.  Took a long time for the server to come back.  My water glass was empty again. We ordered a burger with avocado extra ($1).  Our menus were different and it wasn't clear that fries came with your order. It does in most places.  Ordered a flat-iron steak sandwich with bleu cheese---very good.  Enough for two small appetites.  The burger was overdone; no avocado, and a dried out bun.  A pile of \"truffle\" fries were placed in the middle of the table.  No dipping sauce (most upscale places offer that).  Wait staff was scarce in an almost empty restaurant.  Had to leave the table and go into the restaurant from the patio to get a check.  Commented that I felt invisible.  The waiter chuckled (wrong emotion). He gave us a small discount.  One can run up a big check here when you add in drinks and side orders of fries. But the quality does not justify these prices.   We are very generous tippers when service is good.  Our tip:  $0.00.  Another tip: Avoid this place.  Finally, a friend shopping at the nearby Safeway ran into a customer buying truffle oil spray (an employee from Charr).  They spray the oil on the friends--voila truffle fries.  Can't imagine this place surviving with service and practices like this to go with high prices."}
{"text":"Best burger place around, and you can get a great micro brew with it, doesn't get any better than Charr"}
{"text":"What happened here? I have been lots of times in the past and it was incredible. I even used to recommend it to others. I went in tonight we were seated right away and the hostess even brought us water. We then began waiting. It took the waitress about 15 minutes to even ask if we wanted something to drink and take our order. We never saw her at our table again. Other tables just not ours. When our food arrived it was incorrect they forgot my bacon. The previously delicious garlic buns are now cold, dry and tasteless. Our fries were cold. We didn't have any silverware so we had to wait. We were asked if we would like mayo, we were like yes finally. We she brought the mayo, one little cup for our whole table, she basically dropped it off and left before we could even say anything else. Then we didn't see anyone again until we were ready to leave. We got no refills on our drinks, No one even asked us how everything was, nothing. It saddens me that I have lost what used to be a terrific restaurant, but I have never been treated so rudely. Even bringing the check nobody said another word to us. No wonder there were so many empty tables."}
{"text":"I gladly pay the extra money to enjoy fantastic food, great atmosphere and most importantly the lack of unsupervised, uncontrolled, misbehaving children!  Just an FYI, the fries come with your burger and other sides come with the meal, so kudos to them for listening to the previous gripes and addressing them.   I have been twice. I will be back again. It is a nice date spot, great dim atmosphere with some music, but you are able to carry on a conversation with ease.  And, like I noted before: lack of children.  The few I have seen were all well behaved and parentally managed.  The service was great both times, friendly, knowledgeable and attentive without hovering.  Give it a try and you may discover a new jewel of an eatery!"}
{"text":"I went with a few friends and it was awful! Everyone agreed the only decent thing about this place was the crispy fries. The service was so atrocious we considered leaving before even being greeted. It's a very unfriendly place. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Great burgers, salads, and sandwiches. Although they just opened, service was quick. Using the garlic knots as buns is genius! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was my first time to Charr!  I can promise it will not be my last time.  I had the portabello burger( FABULOUS), the truffle fries are truly worth writing home about, and OMG, the blueberry bread pudding with whiskey sauce.  I literally needed to be rolled out of the door with left overs for tomorrow!  Happy tummy for 2 days!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and loved the food & drinks! The chef has been there every time to walk around and make sure everyone likes their food and interact with guests. The burgers are absolutely delicious! Definitely satisfies that craving for a large, juicy burger. For about the same price as a Red Robin burger - skip the large chain & try this place. It is worth it!"}
{"text":"My husband and I really wanted to like this restaurant as we love local non-chain restaurants. We stopped in for lunch and honestly were horrified!  We waited 10 minutes to be seated although there were only two other tables occupied and the waitress and cook walked past us 5 times.  Then we sat at a filthy table, were served ice tea that had gone rancid (seriously it must have been says old!). When we asked for something thing else the waitress said she might have to charge us for it.  We had both taken a sip of the tea and asked for a fountain soda?  She relented but with a ton of attitude.  We ordered our food, it took 40 minutes to get to us, it was not well made or cooked to order as both burgers were burnt.  To top it off the restaurant is just dirty.  The owner came out covered in filth to tell off color jokes to the table of regulars next to us.  Never again!  Just awful."}
{"text":"We are regulars here. We love the food and the service. I'm shocked at the service critiques. We've been here a lot, and only once did we have mediocre service. Otherwise it's been terrific. I love the Buffalo Chicken sandwich, but really everything here is  excellent. I like the onion soup or the wedge salad for a starter. The burgers are tasty and too much to eat even for a big guy. The beer and wine selections have what I like. The atmosphere is just right. Not only that, but they will bring up Italian from their deli if you ask. What's not to like about Charr?"}
{"text":"Service good. Atmosphere good. Burgers...to die for. Shrimp Po Boy, overlooked and plain."}
{"text":"We have become big fans of this place and our experience with them during Restaurant Week totally sealed the deal.  We had the flank steak in Marsala sauce.  My dining partner nearly licked the plate it was so delicious.  The potato croquet that accompanied it was also totally yummy--crispy on the outside and fluffy and cheesy on the inside.  Service has been great every time we've been there, prompt and attentive but not intrusive.  The burgers are always lovely, juicy and done as requested --a perfect pink medium rare--and the fries are addictive.  Monday night is bargain burger night and a complete steal.  Love this place!  A great addition to the Moon Valley neighborhood. The owner has been in the house every time we've been here and he always checks in to make sure we're enjoying our meal.  When they first opened, the fries were not included with the burger entrees, but they have since remedied that, which was a really good decision."}
{"text":"We're planning on going to Wild Tuna next door but unfortunately they didn't open until 5pm. My boyfriend and I decided to try Charr- we walked into an empty dining area with only 2 people sitting at the bar. Figured we could have a quick bite and be in and out easily... Turns out not so much. The server looked like we had annoyed her by even being there. 30 minutes later, my pulled pork sandwich came out dry like it was sitting under the heat lamp for about 20 of those minutes. Mind you- we were literally 1 of 2 tables in the place. I attempted to just power through but the meat was so chewy and rubbery that it was unbearable. My boyfriends burger came out very well done after initially asking for it to be medium. He decided to send his back to the kitchen only to be given an eye roll from the server and uncomfortable stares from the kitchen staff (the kitchen is open to the dining area). About 10 minutes later the burger came back out to only be cooked \"well\" again. My boyfriend decided to just eat it this time and found it to be tough and tasteless.To make a long story short- every single staff member we had the privilege of being in contact with there made us feel as if we were annoying them from start to finish. I will never recommend this place to anyone and will not be going back. It makes so much sense as to why I never really see many people in the restaurant from the street. These people really need to get it together."}
{"text":"I love this place, great beer selection, great food, cool atmosphere. If you don't like hot spots and would rather chill at a cool neighborhood joint, this is the place."}
{"text":"Just returned from an excellent dinner at Charr -- our entire party of four enjoyed their burgers, and the service was gracious, efficient, and complete. I had the Turkey Burger, which was delicious and easily altered as per my requests. Instead of fries, I ordered the grilled veggies, which were perfectly done. Our waitress, Claudia, was very professional and extremely attentive. (I am glad that we did not take those negative reviews below to heart. Instead, we gave Charr a chance to prove those reviewers wrong, and we are certainly glad it did.) We look forward to returning."}
{"text":"Always friendly and good food. The burgers are great. New bartender Melanie was very attentive and got the orders perfect.  Owners always remember your name unlike those chain places."}
{"text":"Been here twice other than I'm not a big garlic on the bun fan, there is nothing to complain about, really good stuff."}
{"text":"Been to their Italian restaurant and loved it so much I decided to give their burger joint a try. They did not disappoint. I got a steakhouse burger with A1 and crispy onion rings which was the best burger I've had in Phoenix. The fries with truffle oil that came with it were on point.  My fiance got a flat iron salad with a spicy ranch dressing, it was amazing but she kept trying to steal bites of my burger so looks like I'm going to have to come back by myself."}
{"text":"I deducted a star for the high price for a burger. The burger was juicy and filling, with a nice grill taste. The fries are DELICIOUS! Thin and crispy, full of flavour. The service was very attentive. Nice slightly upscale decor. They even were kind to my messy one year old!"}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood spot! Great place to grab a beer and burger after work but don't rule out the rest of the menu! Killer spicy chili wings and crab cakes! Top it off with a milkshake for dessert you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"We came for the first time and the server was kind and friendly, although never told us her name. We ordered the Mac N Chz burger and a turkey burger version of the Carolina burger. A regular next to us suggested as I ordered to get the sauce on the side. This was helpful and made it enjoyable to eat. We both had our fries crispy because that's how we like em. We were delighted by the shoe string truffle fries. They were crispy and flavorful. The service was average Friday night timing and the owner touched base to see how we were. The lighting is romantic, the atmosphere a quiet roar and the price point on par for the items being served. We will be back."}
{"text":"We've been twice now with the whole family, once during their opening test nights and then again last night.   On the test night, you'd expect mistakes and working out the kinks. In our case, every aspect was just spot on. My eldest, the self styled expert on wings, pronounced Charr's Chili Glazed Wings the best she's ever had. My youngest, not a wing fan, devoured them. High praise from both ends of the spectrum.  Last night, spot on again. Burgers on large garlic knots are excellent, juicy and perfectly cooked. Wings...yep, perfect again. A couple of Leini'e Summer Shandy bottles, super cold and served in cold glasses by our excellent and friendly server Kevin (only his third day, and you'd never know. Great job Kevin!) Fries were nice and crispy (called Truffle Fries, and while did not taste the truffle oil, they were still very good).   Really well done concept, great service and excellent food!"}
{"text":"Don't order the \"fresh\" blue point oysters! They were so over priced and not worth the money. Pappadeaux are way better and even cheaper. The service wasn't the best and there was only us and another table during lunch on a Sunday. Bathroom area smelled so bad. They had no changing table in the restroom. I understand just another reason why we won't be going back. Go to Moon Valley Cafe and get a better hamburger for way cheaper."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I absolutely love it. The funny thing is my favorite thing there is their mac n cheese. I just wish they had a full plate to order instead of just sides. I end up buying like 3-4 sides just for my self. Other than that the environment is great the people are awesome and the food is on point."}
{"text":"If I could do zero I would. For some reason you have to order at the bar for reverse happy hour pricing, which was deceiving. The buns were stale, the meat was less than decent, and the fries were comparable to Burger King. They had clear signage in the dining area boasting reverse happy hour with no mention of \"their unique rule\". This place flat sucked, myself and the wife could've spent nearly $100 elsewhere and left happy, but instead we left as if we were robbed. Who ever gave this place 3 or more stars has obviously no clue as to what a dining experience consists of. Thumbs down!!!! Twice!!!"}
{"text":"I really liked this place! So festive with their Christmas decor.  I went here for dinner on a Friday with a sorority sister because she had recommended it. It has a great location in morth Phoenix and hosts a beautiful fire pit fitted outisde patio, but was a little chilly for outside dining that night. We opted for a table in the middle of the place, my only complant was that I got the chair and my sister got the booth. In the chair, I felt like I was a foot above her and it was a little uncomfortable to sit that way.  None the less, the service was fantastic. We each ordered drinks and were hand delivered by a nice bartender. We could see the hustle and bustle of the kitchen from our seats and with an open air kitchen like that it really fills the room with the right amount of noise. We got an app, friend zucnini with ranch dipping sauce. They were alright. I wish they had a bigger crunch when you bite in but they also cut really nicely for nibbling perfection.   I got the The Buffalo Chicken while my sister orded the Grilled Chicken. Mine came with the most melty, amazing, mouth watering white cheese. That was my favorite part. The bread was great and the chicken too. Not enough buffalo sauce but the blue cheese dipping sauce was on point.  The place is owned by the funny Italian guy and he was just hanging around the place. He speaks poor english but is super friendly and will always ask you how your meal was. I'd go back."}
{"text":"Awesome local restaurant with wonderful service. We went for burgers and a glass of wine and was not disappointed. The staff went the extra mile to whip up a fried egg to top our Carolina BBQ Burger. The meat was well seasoned and cooked to perfection. We'll definitely come back for happy hour!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch when I first moved to the area.  Will agree with some of the previous reviewers to say service was slow but not anything painful.  It was just a laid back type slow, but I could see how it would get on people's nerves.  Overall both me and my moms hamburgers were good quality cooked correctly and had interesting topics.  Their fries are great!! This is trying to have a more gourmet type feel for the area and maybe people are not prepared for it.  I liked it and the atmosphere is funky.  Would definately take friends and family back."}
{"text":"Not so much a review, but a chance to vent about about the negative experience we just had at Charr. The hamburgers are great and they have the best onion rings I've ever tasted. No complaints about the service. Nonetheless, our meal tonight was very uncomfortable. The owner paid for our meal and told us not to come back.  The hamburgers now automatically come with truffle fries, which is a step in the right direction as they are a bit pricey. My niece wanted to know if she could substitute sweet potato fries and pay a little extra. The waitress indicated that this was not their policy. However, she would ask the owner indicatiing he would not like it. The owner came to our table asking what was wrong. So my niece asked again. The owner indicated we were getting the fries for free. My husband indicated that he does not eat fries so they would be wasted. My niece said matter of factly, \"So you don't make exceptions.\" She did not say it in an accusatory mannter. This is when the owner's friendliness turned to hostility. He said that we would get everything we wanted on the house and added, \"Don't come back.\"  Maybe the owner had had enough complaints for the day. I don't think we were obnoxious. We were not asking for anything for free. We would have accepted, \"sorry no exceptions. We wouldn't have liked it, but it wouldn't have stopped us from coming back as the hamburgers are that good.  The restaurant refused to take our money even though we expected to pay. (Ironically we were using a Groupon.) I don't have complaints about the food or service; in fact I have recommended Charr to others who liked it. I am not advising anyone not to patronize Charr. The food is great, but the owner overreacted. We live in Sunnyslope and like to support local businesses. However, the owner made it very clear that he did not want or need our business."}
{"text":"Had not been in the area in a while and wanted to hit Market Bistro which used to be in the spot.  Found out they had closed and decided to try the new Charr.  In a nut shell, overpriced and the food was OK at best (nothing you can't make at home with some basic store bought ingredients).  Ordered a \"glorified\" grilled cheese which literally was a hunk of cheese between two pieces of bread with no real flavor and my wife ordered a chicken sandwich that was dry and hard to eat.  The sandwiches didn't even come with fries (for $10 bucks each you can give your customer .50 cents in fries).  Ordered the cream cheese filled poppers which literally tasted like they came out of a freezer and where dropped old oil.  Defiantly not impressed and wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This was the second time I have come to charr. The restaurant is really cool and appealing to the eye. The food is really really good. I have had the buffalo chicken sandwich and on this trip I had the Carolina burger. The fresh handmade garlic bun is an awesome addition to any burger. I have zero complaints as far as food goes.  Food gets 4 stars.   My issue with this place is the service, or lack there of. Upon arrival there were two other tables that were occupied. It still took 10 minutes to get a drink. 15-20 minutes after that we got to order food. The food arrived after a reasonable amount of time. I felt like I wanted to pay my bill at that time so we could leave in a timely manner and not be held bill captive.  Service gets 2 stars.   I want this place to survive because it is a local business with great food. Service issue needs to be resolved to reflect the price point of food. There are a million places to go get a $12.00 entree and a $5.00 beer, give me a reason to want to spend my money here."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place because the neighborhood really needs a great place to eat, but the service is unprofessional. My family and I have been here a total of 4 times and each time it gets worse. Our last time at Charr was a nightmare. The manager on duty (blonde female) was completely short w/us because we complained about our waiter who we saw drinking a beer and smoking a cigarette by his truck minutes before we sat down. Usually when you go out to a restaurant you don't want your waiter smelling like a bar. Our food took over 30 minutes to get to our table and it wasn't busy. No refills on drinks until I had to get up and ask for refills. The food is good, but that is not good enough. A professional wait staff and a nice manager would be a good idea for this place. The owner of Charr would have been very disappointed with the managers attitude."}
{"text":"Great local place for Moon Valley. Felt at home with Joe greeting all of the customers, just like at Aiello's in Central Phoenix. Burgers are good. Onion rings are lightly battered and tasty. Good selection of craft beers. Nice array of selections other than burgers too. This place will be one of our regular eateries. Congrats to Joe and Myrah for another great concept."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were craving a big, juicy, off the grill kind of burger that has an unmistakable charred taste.... then we yelped upon this little burger bar. The menu is packed full of great options, salads, burgers, sandwiches and sides. It really was a tough decision with all the great choices but  I went with the Belly Buster fork burger and my boyfriend had The Phoenix burger. Delicious. It hit the spot, cooked the way I wanted. Complete with that charred taste. They came on Garlic Knot Buns, just a hint or garlic taste if any. With these buns we noticed that they are a much hardier type of bun that won't become soggy after sitting as easily. Sturdy yet soft. Butter lettuce, tomato, and onion served on the side. When they say \"smothered\" they mean it.   We found a good Burger joint without having to treck across to downtown phoenix or scottsdale for an overpriced burger. No reason to go else where now :)"}
{"text":"Friendly prompt service, food delivered quick. Designed to compete with deluxe.  Had the Phoenix burger, great flavor, and that's no Anaheim pepper either. Love that green chile flavor."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Charr a few weeks ago.  I purposefully waited to write this since we wanted to re-try a couple of other places nearby for comparison.  We had 2 wedge salads, 2 burgers, an order of onion rings and 3 beers.  $60.  In the next two weeks we went to a nearby sports bar/Italian place and a brewpub.  For similar quantities, the price was $35 at one place and $38 at the other, both similar quality.  I have a hard time justifying the higher price tag, especially considering how loud it was at Charr, it was difficult to have a conversation.  The beer selection is good, but overpriced as was the case with everything.  Doing a la carte will be a tough sell when that is not what everyone else does.  We may return but not often unless the value gets better.  I wish them well but would encourage them to consider some changes that will price them more competitively."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the goods....burgers were marginal, but fries were decent although the ticket time for a side order was approximately 20 mins, and the staff was very polite and attentive (that might be because we were the only two people in there at the time which was roughly 530pm).  Men's bathroom was run down (faucet falling off the wall), dirty, and smelled like stale urine....I understand it is a bathroom but it doesn't have to smell that way!   My biggest beef is the price of liquor.....$7.50 for a call brand liquor (we ordered Captain Morgan/Coke and Malibu/Pineapple) served in rocks glasses. This establishment is no where near trendy enough to be running these kind of prices. I have bar tending experience and have travelled enough to know when to pay those prices and Charr is not it.  Happy hour ran from 330-500(or close to that). This didn't make much sense to me...during the week most people are barely out of work by 5.  I might return for food only if I happen to be in the area, but will never seek out or recommend Charr."}
{"text":"I got a burger asked for medium. I got we'll done with over salted fries. My girlfriend got a salad. Which looked like cut up condiments for the burgers on top of romaine lettuce. The lettuce was mainly the heart of the romaine which was yellow.  Cool looking place that's about it. After visiting here I really don't want to attempt to visit aiellos. Don't want to get disappointed."}
{"text":"This was our second time . . . because it's in the neighborhood we thought we would give them a second chance even though the first time was not that great.  There is nothing good about this place.  We went there for lunch . . . walked in and were told to sit wherever we wanted, and then when we chose a spot out of the wind (all doors were open), we were told that whole area was reserved for large parties.  There was one other couple in the restaurant and two people sitting at the bar.  The waiter was surly, impatient, and uninformed.  When we asked a question about the beers on draft, he snapped that he had no idea because it was 4th day on the job.  There was no manager in sight.  The beer, by the way, was warm.  We ordered and waited forever for the food.  Again, there was only one other table.  The food was definitely not good.  How do you ruin a basic burger?  Put it on a smashed bun with a mealy tomato slice that was sliced 4 days ago and a brown-edged leaf of anything-but-crisp lettuce.  It was awful.  The Buffalo chicken sandwich was even worse.  Even the french fries were terrible . . . they were a mix of crispy ones and pale, cold, floppy ones.  Like they mixed an old batch and a new batch together.  Gross.  We took a couple of bites and asked for the check.  Seriously, this place is bad.  Don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"Great service. Have the French onion soup. Fantastic flavor. Would have liked the onions to be a little more caramelized but still great. Ordered a burger medium rare came out a little on the rare side but still really good flavor like the sweet potato fries. The owner stop by to touch the table. Nice place I'd come back"}
{"text":"The food is excellent if you can stand the horrible service. We tried three times unsuccessfully and today simply walked out when the blonde Lady bartender refused to accommodate a special request for dietary reasons. She was inflexible and exceedingly rude. she even used the F word at us. Very disappointing because it is nearby and the kind of ambience we enjoy. The only time we had a decent experience is when we were served by the owner himself. not worth going back for - we are done."}
{"text":"My son and I had lunch at Charr today, the food and service was amazing.  The quality of the burgers and salads were outstanding. My son had the Carolina BBQ Burger, fries and a side salad, I had the The Phoenix Burger, onion rings with a wedge salad. The burgers were cooked perfect, their french fries and onion rings are the best I've had in years. It's so nice when the chipotle mayo, ketchup, lettuce (they use butter lettuce, yummy), tomato and onion is service on the side. That may sound crazy to some of you but I love it when the condiments are serviced on the side. Omgosh, we tried the Blueberry Bread Pudding, it was amazing. Our waitress Kristen S was attentive, courteous and best of all she knew the menu.  We will definitely be stopping in again. Thank you for a delicious lunch."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The waitress was totally elusive. The mushroom dish was not the same as described on the menu.  I will NEVER go back!"}
{"text":"Been there a dozen times on Monday burger night , half of those times the burgers were well done when we ordered them medium rare ,When you send them back they get pissed , like your the one who is wrong . You would think they know how to make a medium rare burger . Been there other nights also , same issue at regular price , although on Mondays lately they skimp on the burger size , Nice going ... Most of the servers are terrible . Joe is a buffoon, thinks he has good customer service because he says hi to everyone , he couldn't give a damn .  We will never go back . Too many good burger places in town."}
{"text":"Went on a Monday - an app, two burgers, o-rings and 4 drinks - $72  - We had the Cali burger and turkey burger both good.  The house made o-rings were over battered and too greasy for my taste.  With two of the drinks being on \"Happy Hour\" (note: only seated at the bar or outside) seems pretty expensive for a burger joint.  Had 3 servers standing around but only the bartender did anything - had to flag her down a time or two.  Still seems like they are sorting out things, hopefully pricing is one of them."}
{"text":"Hmm, the reviews for this place seem to be all over the place. My experience was all good.   Stopped in for late lunch on a Sunday. We kept it pretty straightforward. I had a Charr Burger with Cheddar Cheese. It was nicely cooked to medium rare. My girlfriend opted for the Chicken Grill. Both turned out to be good choices. The garlic knot bun for the burger is unique and buttery good. The meat could have used a bit more seasoning, but still had good flavor. The truffle fries were an excellent companion piece to the whole meal.  In the end, our waiter, Gino, was kind enough to give us some extra garlic knot buns to take home. Had a sandwich on one for dinner that night.  The burger world is the crowded spot these days, but Charr does have a home in it."}
{"text":"I've been a vegetarian for four years now and this restaurant has one of the best veggie burgers in town. Really awesome that you can take any burger on the menu and put a veggie patty on it instead. I'm also a truffle-fry fanatic, and these fries were definitely top tier. I highly recommend this place as a huge foodie."}
{"text":"Well I have been around town pretty much I test everything and post reviews. And on that note I will NEVR post a bad review I will call the owner direct as it's not my choice to ruin any business.. I  love derek .. and my favorite things are the sweet potato fries the spinach dip and the fried pickles omg !!!!! Not to mention I'm a real advocate on mutts nuts man I love that beer . So stop by on a night when u can and tell them TK referred you    Humbly TK"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a recent Fri. night.  There was live music on the patio but we opted to sit inside and were immediately seated.  The restaurant was 1/4 to 1/3 full but we sat there through at least 4 songs (about 15-20 min.) and no one asked us if we wanted a drink, brought us a glass of water, or acknowledged our presence in any way.  The hostesses were directly behind us, there was wait staff milling around chatting and cleaning other tables, a chef was chatting it up on the patio with other guests but we were completely ignored. I would've liked to try the food but the service was non-existent (other than being immediately seated by the hostess) so that we wound up walking out."}
{"text":"Good live music, friendly and attentive staff in a nice atmosphere. Lots of food choices for a burger place. Especially tasty was the barbecue sauce and tuna on nicoise salad."}
{"text":"I was meeting a friend for dinner and she suggested Charr since we were both in that area. Being from the southwest Valley and rarely in that part of town, I had never heard of it, but I'm always willing to try out new places.  I arrived there at 5:30 on a weekday and there were only two people in there. That made me a little nervous, but the place looked nice on the inside and the bartender and hostess were very nice as well.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger with fries and everything was delicious! The burger was cooked exactly how I ordered. The meat tasted fresh and high-quality. The goodies that come with the burger (lettuce, onions, tomato, etc.) looked fresh and tasty. The fries were equally delicious. They're the thin and crispy type and not greasy at all.  This little place pleasantly surprised me! If I'm ever in the neighborhood again, I will definitely go back to Charr. Nice staff, good service, reasonable prices, and great food. Can't really ask for more."}
{"text":"We decided to try this burger place a month ago after a good review from a coworker.  We come to Phoenix for business frequently, and come to CABG frequently whenever we are in town.   Our waiter Kenny, was attentive and funny!  He helped to make the night.  The food was delicious we loved the pickle chips, and our burgers were great.  Our waiter, Kenny brought our food promptly and in the right order, perfectly timed.  We have been back since and actually requested to be seated in Kenny's section.  WE have decided to make this one of our go to places whenever we visit.   However, the beer could be more reasonably price, but we solved that by having water and soda. We highy recommend this restaurant.  If your waiter can't make it right the manager also seemed helpful after observing him at another table.  Luckily we didn't have any problems with our waiter!  update: visited again a few weeks ago and asked for Kenny's section.  He remembered us and made us feel welcome.  This time we had a game of pool to relax.  Still as happy with food and server!"}
{"text":"Consistently slow service. Staff was clearly annoyed they had to wait on us. Owner walks around visiting tables- maybe you should be training staff and addressing kitchen issues. Also please don't touch the female patrons- they don't appreciate it. Burger was overcooked. Fries portion was skimpy because they thought we were doing Restaurant Week. Took two hours- no refills - 30 minutes waiting for the check. We want to support this neighborhood place but they need to get it together."}
{"text":"Great way to start restaurant week 2015! Wings were the best!!! Sam was a great server! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"We went fur restaurant week and were neither impressed or disappointed. Just an average burger with less that great service. Meh..."}
{"text":"$6 for fries is ridiculous. Burger, fries and a diet coke should not cost $20."}
{"text":"Came in after work for a burger to go! Friendly staff, great atmosphere! Can't wait to actually go back and try more things on the menu! 2nd best burger I've ever had."}
{"text":"Just like JC from Phoenix on 4/29, the very next day on 4/30 I was here with two friends. One had a mediocre burger and two of us got sick on the fish and chips. Pepto for days. Either the fish or the oil was very bad and the beer battering was soggy and disgusting!  Our waiter was fairly new he said and was friendly and attentive, with just a tad to learn. I can't say service was bad, but so many others do that I think we got lucky. I doubt the owners care since bad reviews go back years. Don't waste your money here!"}
{"text":"Right now, I'm grateful for the open kitchen concept . I just watched cook batter my order of fried pickles with his bare hands. I cancelled my order and I'm sure to never eat here. Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"This was our 2nd time there. 1st time was not very good (burgers were overcooked and flatbread was dry like cardboard), but thought we would give them another try. This time was horrible. There were 3 tables in the restaurant and it took over 30 minutes to get food to our table. Both the sliders and charr burger, ordered medium, we well done and too dry to eat. They offered to make new burgers, but since it took 30 minutes to get our food, there was not enough time to wait for them to make new food.  The table next to us also had overcooked burgers and were also upset.  Too bad, we live close, but would rather make the drive to Delux."}
{"text":"Good burgers and service but not spectacular. Both my son and I had the fish and chips last time both ended up getting sick. Burgers are good but I won't go back. Patio is nice and the place is clean."}
{"text":"We live across Thunderbird, in a residential neighborhood behind the condos. We moved in in December, and were optimistic that there were pizza/burger joints in walking distance. Upon trying the pizza, by our third visit/take out, we figured out that they have a one size fits all attitude that leaves much to be desired....bigger is not always better. It's a flavorless crust with greasier than necessary toppings. Then, we tried Charr, for burgers, since that's all they do, we were again hopeful that our burgers would be terrific. Such a pitiful excuse for a restaurant. First off, the server argued with my fiance about putting mustard on her turkey burger, and then neglected to honor my wish of medium for my burger. It was cooked all the way through, and the garlic knot bun is not a suitable vessel for the patty because it is too firm and crushed the toppings and it all squirts out. The service was so slow even though the place was almost empty during \"dinner rush.\" The fries are really small, and too salty, sweet potato were also a disappointment. To top it off, this evening, my fiance was at home and could hear loud band/bad karaoke sounding music (which we have been hearing Thurs-Sat. since memorial wknd it seems) come blaring through our back yard starting 8pm. She traced it's origin to Charr, and asked to speak to the mgr. Joe Aiello (owner) fielded the complaint. He was a page out of Kitchen Nightmares, first arguing with her that as a business he didn't have to honor her request. When she suggested he turn it down or reposition the speakers, so as to keep the other possible neighborhood customers happy and returning, he insisted that as a bar that having this band as entertainment was beneficial. He called her rude for asking, and started to pressure her and intimidate her toward the door, trying to kick her out, he just cant take the criticism. This is not the kind of customer service you would expect to be given to someone who could bring in a lot of repeat sales. He is extremely unprofessional and it shows throughout his establishments. The food, service and ambiance in general is all sub par and reflective of his attitude toward guests and the Moon Valley community. NEGLIGENT! We highly recommend skipping this place, just head to McDonalds. We will not be back!"}
{"text":"I've only been into charr a handful of times but whenever I come in the atmosphere is perfect! The food is good and the servers are amazing! Kristin was my server, she was super busy with all of her tables but always made sure they got what they needed in a timely manner. She has a smile on her face at all times which is something I appreciate at any restaurant!"}
{"text":"Forgotten that I had been here once before and swore I would never be back. Now I know why. Called earlier during the day to make sure they had gluten free buns because my son is allergic.  They said yes then when we ordered they said they just ran out. Then ordered spinach artichoke dip which on menu said served with chips.  Came out with bread. When I asked for chips they said the bread is their chips. Once again, my son can't eat it. The burgers are decent but the \"house made\" garlic knot is nothing to write home about. Service was slow and food sat under warmer forever. When I asked why no one else could bring it waitress said it wasn't her table. Don't bother with this place. So many other burger joints in Phoenix that are of far better quality and actually carry the things their menus offer."}
{"text":"Very underwhelming to say the least...  $38 plus tip for 2 burgers 1 glass of house wine 1 draft beer  Burgers were okay but this place is charging Scottsdale prices in north phoenix.  Happy hour only 3-5 pm and I think reverse as well.  No daily specials, nothing exciting, oysters were priced at $3.50/each lol.  Probably one and done here for me as I will gladly enjoy a culvers or paradise valley burger company and go to Scottsdale when I want to pay $13 for a cocktail.  Sorry guys, not worth it."}
{"text":"While having to wait for an unexpected car repair, my friend and I chose Charr since it was close to my mechanic.  Not a big fan of the industrial décor, but if the food is good I can live with it. Well - ugh!  A far cry from a burger joint, the menu was uninspired. We ordered the basic Charr burger -  one medium rare, the other medium well and got them cooked exactly the same. The garlic bun was intriguing but we both would have preferred them warmed a little. Ketchup served as the condiment of choice? I would prefer Thousand Island Dressing and maybe toss in a couple pickles. Neither of us had ever tasted Truffle fries, and I can honestly say I will never bother seeking them out. The muscle bound staff stood like guardians at the path to the restrooms. My friend braved the trail past them, announcing she had been in better restrooms in gas stations. I decided to skip the use of the facilities. I think a staff could at least \"fake\" busy so you don't feel like cattle being surveyed by prospective bidders at an auction. Charr is totally off the list of restaurants, and I wouldn't bother trying any of the sister restaurants. I can understand why people find their reservations available - it's because no one really goes there. Too many good burgers in town - I've learned to accept a $10.00 burger like I accept gasoline over $3.50 a galloon. The difference is, I have to buy gas - but I can get good food elsewhere for that $10.00.  I only wish I was in possession of one of their coupons they put out regularly. A painful experience is better with a coupon."}
{"text":"First time we went here we ordered the French Onion soup, the onion rings, and the Phoenix burger to share.  The item we liked the least was the burger, but that's not saying it wasn't good.  The soup and onion rings were awesome.  The truffle fries took center stage!  Since our first visit we've been back several times and have had equally good experiences.  The service is always friendly and speedy, but sometimes the kitchen is a little slow.  I don't mind the speed because good food is worth the wait, which it is here.  It's a great addition to the Moon Valley neighborhood!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite neighborhood restaurants! Great burgers and a lot of other options. Kids menu is perfect for our little ones too."}
{"text":"Ordered here with UberEATS and it's been 40 min passed the estimated 30 min time frame. When I phone the restaurant the order still wasn't ready so it looks like the fault is at the restaurant not UberEATS. I'll update when and If we actually get to taste the food!"}
{"text":"Great casual good. Great service. Quaint place. Pleasant atmosphere. I love this place and highly recommend it.  I just don't get some of these negative comments here. I've been there probably a half-dozen times over the past couple of months and have not had one negative experience (food OR service). If you don't like the prices, then all I can say is go to McDonalds next door."}
{"text":"Love the Aiello's concepts!   Went for dinner and had the traditional burger and it was awesome! The burger was cooked to perfection with a flavorful charr crust and placed on a homemade garlic knot bun.  The truffle fries were sensational!  My  sister had the grilled chicken sandwich with grilled vegetables which was also delicious.  The veggies were grilled perfectly and seasoned to perfection. The bread was warm and had a nice crunchy crust.   Love the open kitchen and the atmosphere in the restaurant; very warm and welcoming.   Service was excellent!   Will definitely return to try other entrees."}
{"text":"It was okay... First off, this place is in a strip mall - not the kind of place you expect to be asked \"do you have reservations?\" I think there is a little mismatch here. The decor is smart and clean, if a little bland. It screams \"American Bistro\" in a cookie-cutter manner. The good things? They have a raw bar and do oyster shots (which I found reasonably priced, too)! Their bar is denfinitely well-stocked and they have a select list of wines and local/ micro-brew beers and ales (San Tan Ale was my choice that evening and it didn't disappoint), the shots were served cold (Patron) with lime, but no one remembered the salt until it was requested (quibble if you will, but I do like salt and lime with most commercial tequila). The quality of the ingredients of the food is quite good, too. Now the bad part: It took over 35 minutes for my order to come out (a burger and fries, an oyseter shot) and when one of the people at the table asked for HER check (not \"the check\"), we got everyone's tab on it! WHat a nightmare. The server, who had been inattentive or disorganized all night never got better (hint: you will improve your tips if you don't call the men \"buddy\" and \"bro\" and if you don't call the women \"sweetie.\" Frankly, \"Sir\" and \"Ma'am\" work really well). And the burger was NOT rare, but to be fair, you really can't get a patty that thin to be rare and warm. Oh, and \"truffle fries?\" Meh. Truffle oil doesn't impress me, but the texture was right, not overcooked or undercooked with a nice crisp outside. The beef was tasty, but the patty surprisingly thin, even for a $10.00 burger. I'll go back, but I won't be in any hurry if I do and I'll ask for a different waitstaff if I get the same waiter. All in all, it seems like some of the staff could use a little more training in cadence and attentiveness but the food was pretty good. Oh, and lastly, the bathrooms in a place that is trying to be upscale should be in good repair - broken tp holders and a large unpainted patch job isn't consistent with the image this restaurant wants to project."}
{"text":"This place sucks when it comes to service.    Went there today after several poor experiences in the past. Trying to give Charr one more chance.  No one greeted us for at least 10 minutes.  When the very tan, blond woman finally approached us, she was very kurt and I never did see a smile one her face.  We ordered drinks, which were delivered in a timely manner but when we were ready to order we found her to become very rude when I asked about customizing my meal.  When I finally conceded to her inflexibility she rudely snatched the menu out of my hand, with a nasty look on her face and stomped off in the direction of the computer to place our order.  At that point I decided we were through.  I expressed my feelings in what was probably an inappropriate way, left a few bucks to cover the cost of our drinks and headed for the door.  As we did, the server said, \"don't f**king f**k me!\"  There are only 3 reasons to go out to eat in my opinion.  Good food, good ambience, good service.  Food has been good when I have eaten and the ambience is good but the poor service combined with ugly attitude makes this place a disaster...    Yeah, won't be going back here ever again...."}
{"text":"We really wanted to love this place. However it was mediocre in every way. It took forever to get waited on, even to get a water!  The alleged in house baked bun was cold and tasteless. The side salad was boring and tasted like preservatives. The main event, the burger, was gross!  The beef was low grade. This was such a disappointment. How do you screw up a burger??"}
{"text":"Not with another visit. Saturday nite not busy. Should have known. 1st wine on wine list Prosecco out. Went to Aiellos and they were out. How is an Italian restaurant out of  Prosecco?  Do not get the shrimp salad. The dressing is store bought, the shrimp was over cooked and was so bland. Asked for new and got worse. We sat at the bar only patrons, Husband only got water and had to asked for refills. Moscow Mule and bbq burger were tasty, hence the 1 star. Again not with another visit."}
{"text":"This place rocks!!! They use black Angus beef, have turkey burgers that are huge, and a black bean based veggie burger too. Gluten free buns are an option. You can have fries with white truffle oil or homemade mac-n-cheese. A side salad or sweet potato fries are a buck more, and homemade onion rings are a couple of bucks more, but are yummy. They have two slider options for appetizers where the garlic knot bun's are homemade. The chili wings are tasty. They have great portion salad options in case a burger is not what your wanting. The shakes are a great compliment. They have a few desserts. I had the warmed brownie with vanilla bean ice cream, whipped cream and more chocolate syrup on top. Did I mention they have a full bar, and many craft beers on tap. So many choices I did not list."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in on a Friday night around 8 pm.. The bar area and dining room were dimly lit and to our surprise almost empty. We were told to take a seat. We sat and waited for our server until I believed to have been forgotten. We flagged a waitress down. She took our drink orders and sent our server to our table. Our drinks arrived 10 mins later. The mint was fresh in my Mojito however the limes in both our drinks were discolored and unpleasant looking.  A waitress came over beside our table and started polishing dinnerware and talking on her cell phone in a very loud manner. I wished she would have chosen a different table away from us to do this task as there were many others to chose from.  Our burgers arrived with a side of thin cut, crispy fries and burger fixins. We topped our burgers with the veggies only to realize that the chipotle mayo was missing. Our server apologized and bought us the condiment.  My husband and I each had a hard time eating our burgers. The kaiser roll they came on was just too tough for our liking.  With eat bite we took the inside of our burgers would push out into our hands. I ended up dumping my burger contents on my plate and just eating the patty. The patty itself tasted charred and was a very nice quality beef. They were cooked to our liking. The experience in this restaurant was okay, far from the worst and far from the best. Pretty much just a 'meh' experience."}
{"text":"This sounds like it will follow suit with many of the other reviews I've read here.... the food was fantastic, service was really on the slow side. The truffle fries are the best fries I have had, ever. The burgers are delicious. I have never been disappointed in the food, the multiple times I have dined here. My advice is to go here when you have some time to hang out and relax, because the food is definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"The restaurant was pretty empty while we were here. Our waitress was very nice and timely, not super educated on the menu however. Food was average, our burgers were slightly burnt, enough to taste. Lastly, beer menu was subpar. Probably won't come back."}
{"text":"Food was amazing but the service sucked. It took 20 minutes just to get our check after we were done eating and had already had to go boxes. Waitress was too interested in flirting with men at the bar then serving her customers. Would have given a lower rating but the food was good.  And we were the only people in the restaurant besides the man at the bar. Just hope you don't get the blonde tan woman who never actually gave us her name."}
{"text":"This is our favorite burger place by far. We will drive out of our way to get here, passing tons of Bieber places along the way. Try the Brie and mushroom one - you won't regret it. And the truffle fries are amazing. Plus cold cocktails and great staff."}
{"text":"Thoroughly average, if not below average.  Our burgers were fine, edible.  Fries are tasty, but I think they give you way too many, such that the fries spill on to the table, which is gross.  Why gross?  because this restaurant is just SHABBY.  It feels like nobody has any pride in this place. Our table was dusty and dirty, our booth was dusty, our apps plates were greasy...  Sad.  Service was fine. Food was fine. I thought the fried pickle chips were the best part of the meal, actually.  Overpriced, though.   I waited a very long time to try this place, and I have no plans on going back. Too bad, because I'm a fan of both of the other two Aiello restaurants in the same building."}
{"text":"I must start by saying that we are always looking for new and interesting takes on burgers.  I thought we hit the jackpot with Charr American Burger Bar, sadly that was not the case.  While the menu is interesting and I was very excited to see that they are  using homemade Garlic knots in lieu of the standard burger bun. We ordered the zucchini wedges and they were a true disappointment,  bland and overcooked.  My husband ordered the Phoenix burger and it was bland. I ordered the Carolina burger,  the burger was also not seasoned, the \"grilled chipolinni onions were ice cold as was the bun, the bacon was precooked (way too far in advance) and it was lukewarm.  The restaurant was not busy with only one person at the bar and one man having lunch, so I was not expecting such a mediocre meal and service.   Truly dissatisfied & disappointed."}
{"text":"Love this food, Love the sister restaurant - Isa's and Sulmeria. Drinks are very good, Everyone treats us well- and I'm a pain :)"}
{"text":"Do not waste your hard earned dollars here. For a Saturday night the place was almost empty.   Appetizers (onion rings and fried zucchini)  came out cold.  The wings were very good. My wife's chicken dinner was COLD, beans almandine had no almonds and mushy.   The so called smoked ribs were NOT smoked (1/2 rack was a 1/3 rack).  The waitress added $40+ on to our bill,  The peaches and cream martini had very little alcohol.  After the adjustment the bill was still $175 and we drank very little for 4. .  Oh, they were out of half of the deserts.  I would have given this joint zero stars but you cant.  Dont get me wrong I can afford a 5* restaurant but we decided to try Charr this place is doomed to closing.  Oh NO cold glasses.  The waitress brought glass's with ice water in them to chill them and emptied them but left 3 oz of water in the bottom.  This place needs a visit from   Gordon Ramseyor David Irvine."}
{"text":"first, i'm not sure who decided this place wasn't good kids. unless you plan on saddling up to the bar with child in tow (if you do this, you should officially be labeled 'not good for kids'), i don't see why you couldn't bring the little ankle-biters along. we brought a 6-year-old, and she loved it. they even have a kids' menu.  we went on a sunday night, and everything was perfect. if you haven't yet had a hamburger on a huge garlic knot, you haven't lived. the fries are also excellent.  the decor is very minimal and nice. it's in a strange part of town for being so hipster-ish. i hope they survive."}
{"text":"I went here for the first time for restaurant week with my husband. The service was a little slow but the food was wonderful. We had the charr garlic chili glazed wings, easily in the top 3 wings of all time meaty, crispy, and the sauce was amazing, we actually had the waiter leave the plate of sauce so we could dip our fires in it. We had the Carolina BBQ Burger on a garlic knot instead of regular bun, which is a genius idea, and the truffle fries. We finished our meals with the apple crumb cobbler. Everything was amazing. Even though it was a far drive for us, we will be making the trek again just for those wings and burgers. Can't wait to try out the rest of their menu."}
{"text":"Place is so good!! Fancy! Best burger ever!! they serve it on a pretzel, yum-o! Everything is cooked to perfection and is fresh and tasty. The place is so city looking, has a colorful bar and is a good date place without the city parking hustle and parking issue. I will be back, also i hear they have groupons be on the lookout!"}
{"text":"Was here on a business lunch with a colleague.  I had the Arizona burger.  The bun was burnt stiff on one side and the burger, and while good in theory, was ok at best.  Definitely could have done better.  I just don't understand why these places try and get fancy and butcher an American classic.  I don't need a fancy bun, especially if it's burnt, and if you aren't going to season the meat, at least make up for it in other areas.  The fries and southwest sauce was pretty good though.  On another note, there was a cold seafood bar near the kitchen, so I'm not even sure what theme they are going for here.  I can get surf and turf somewhere else, not at a burger joint.  If I lived close, I would give it another try, but don't expect it to blow you away.  Just another trendy burger joint in my honest opinion."}
{"text":"I'm going to start this off with this...$6 for an order of string fries!!! There is a thing called know your customers and this place has not heard about this. If this restaurant was in Scottsdale it would probably work well. But this is at 7th st and Thunderbird. Prices here are outrageous. Burger, fries and a drink is about $18. I'm not exaggerating prices either. My wife ordered the 5 cheese sandwich and it was bad. Just a huge blob of cheese on some bread. Extremely flavorless cheese log. I will not be back to this place and really want my $40 back.   If you notice, the only good reviews on this restaurant all refer to the owner Joe so these are all his friends and of course they are going to give a 5 star review.  Heed my advice and go somewhere else. $6 for a side of fries!!!! I still can't believe this."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for restaurant week and sat at a table for 20 minutes and still never got greeted after 4 tables were seated after us and had been helped. As I sat at the table I started searching for another place to eat. Finally I got up and asked who the manager was and told him we hadn't been taken care of yet. He asked if he could get me anything as we explained the situation. We ended up going to another place so can't say how the food is but we have no desire after seeing how their service and atmosphere was. No music, extremely rude servers and just a bad vibe overall. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"This place is NOT the Grind, Zinburger or even Delux Burgers. Not even close. The owner thinks it is but he should at least TRY these places and  then UPGRADE the beef and the preparation and the knowledge of the service. Only then could you possibly justify the prices!  PLEASE get a clue, I live a block from here and old really appreciate The Grind II NOT another Amaccapanes!!"}
{"text":"Disappointment! This place used to be so good, and recently service and quality of the food have gone down. My favorite sandwich to eat was the Chicken Grill. Before, the chicken was truly grilled and you would get an actual piece of breast. Today, the chicken was like the one that comes sliced in bags that are typically used for salads. My dad ordered the Buffalo burger and completely lacked seasoning. On top of it all, our table was dirty, there was no silverware, and our waitress never asked if we wanted refills. It saddens me to see how much this place has gone down."}
{"text":"We love how cute and quaint this hidden gem is in Moon Valley!! Great burgers, turkey burgers, and salmon. Be sure to try the truffle oil fries! Great neighborhood place for any night of the week."}
{"text":"Very good fries, very good house baked pretzel buns, good beer list on tap and bottle, blueberry bread pudding with whiskey sauce was amazing. Service was fast and nice enough. Only letdown was the burger itself? Underwhelmed by the pizza burger. Everything else was good."}
{"text":"We love that we have found a good burger place close to home! I had the Hawaiian turkey burger, modified slightly because I'm not a spam fan, the burger was delicious and I loved the sweet potato fries. My husband had the Mac N Chesse burger, he enjoyed his burger especially the garlic knot bun!"}
{"text":"We were pleasantly suprised when we went here for the first time. The reviews here didnt seem all that great but we live close by and found a groupon for their wings and 4 drinks (beer, wine or mixed) for only $18!   Wings = outstanding! The spicyness of the wings does build up and make it almost unbearably hot (to me) but the chili sauce they put on them is delish!   Alcohol = we had a few of their drafts which were pretty good: Purple Hazed (something like that), Mission Lager, Sweaty Betty, and Four Peaks Kiltlifter, yummy!!  Staff: friendly and attentive; family owned i think? even the owner/ chef came up to us a couple times while we were at the bar to make sure the bartender was treating us well (his son apparantly)   Atmosphere: upscale, romantic, really nice!!   Prices: expensive if you don't come here for happy hour! We gave in and tried \"The Phoenix\" burger and it was amazing!!  It is expensive considering they don't include a side with your burger but the food is awesome and worth a try!"}
{"text":"I usually don't do reviews but my service was so good I had to give them props. The pretty Latina waitress Drea was so kind and caring, kept up with my table and drinks even on a busy night. Food was awesome and can't wait to come back and try another fabulous burger."}
{"text":"I've found my favorite burger here! Try the steakhouse burger.. A burger covered in a smoked gouda cheese and mushrooms, slightly smothered in a yummy steak sauce, and topped off with some crispy onion strings. The truffle fries are just the added bonus! I also loved the apps.. Grab some fried pickle chips or some spinach artichoke dip. Definitely a great spot for a quick lunch bite or a nice dinner date."}
{"text":"I got out of class early tonight and I was starving. I drove by Isa's pizza which was, unfortunately, closed. I decided to stop in to Charr as they were still open and close by.  I sat at the bar and the bartenders we very friendly. I ordered the fried zucchini and a blue moon. They are very generous with the zucchini even though it is only an appetizer and the beer was cold and refreshing. The zucchini came with a side of ranch, but I prefer marinara, which they did not have, but they were able to accommodate me with their pomodoro soup which is very similar. I will definitely be going back and bringing friends. :)"}
{"text":"When this restaurant first opened my wife and I were fans and since we were moving back to Moon Valley we were excited that MV was going to get a new good restaurant since there aren't many.  We got the Carolina Burger and the garlic knot bun was a great idea. The burger was juicy and delicious. The truffle fries were the perfect side for it as well. Anything truffle I'm a sucker for.  Last night we went again after a few months and it seems they forgot the butter and garlic on the buns and the truffle on the fries. The burger was pretty dry due to the dry bun and lack of any garlic and butter so it was just a knot bun really.   Not sure if it was a bad night, but if I truly hope they pick up the quality again because I want them to succeed here.  I'll give it one more shot and if it's good again, I'll be happy to update this review with 5 stars that I would've given it a few months ago when I first ate here."}
{"text":"They took away my pizza burger,  raised the price of the salmon burger and added a milkshake bar.   Hmmmm."}
{"text":"Although happy to find another decent place to eat in the Lovely's hood, this was not a 5 star experience.   The good: revamped Market Bistro space is attractive and the bar selection solid. The burgers were very good and the garlic knots they're served on, equally delicious. The portions were fair - that is not overly generous or skimpy - and the food was fresh. Service was prompt and hostesses polite. Owner came through twice to ask about our experience. Prices are okay.   The not so good: We were put at a table that did not have proper clearance between us and the next table on one side and a booth on the other. It meant that a large woman's stomach met my back as she passed through. Mmmm blech. Wait staff frequently hit the chair. I moved to the other side which meant that no one could get through there but it moved traffic around the two tables. Music, although nice, was too loud.   For the number of families we saw in there, this does not read as kid friendly. I have a 10 year old for whom we ordered sliders without the peppers and chipotle mayo and although we could've sprung for a milk shake [hello more sugar] water was about my only other option and bonus! free. Now, I'm not expecting the crayon greeting that we get at CPK, but it just didn't have the family vibe to me. Kiddo liked the burger and the brownie dessert [which came as described on the menu but without the whipped cream] and the lovely seconded the dessert thumbs up.   My flat iron salad had freshly cut romaine, homemade croutons, some bermuda onion, corn and black beans and a slice of tomato that was cut in half. I asked for the dressing on the side. It came with a good portion of sliced flatiron steak that although cooked well, had zero seasoning and the dressing on the side was described as a southwest caesar. I didn't get southwest and I did get blah/lacking in flavor.   Bottom line, we'd go back but for the burgers only. Cost of the meal for three of us with no drinks, only water, was $40. Its nice that its in the hood and that there is good food but overall it was good, not great."}
{"text":"Food was great....had the Phoenix burger and it was cooked a perfectly medium as requested. Great spot to hit for a lot of food at a decent price."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to the opening of Charr.  Menu was looking great, right down the street from us,, burgers beers and fries.  How could it go wrong?    Sadly, it just all went wrong.  My wife and I just grabbed a spot at the bar early on a Friday afternoon.  Not too busy at all, early dinner and drinks.  Keep in mind, we are sitting right \"In the Middle of the Bar\".  Took us what seemed like 5+ mins to get our first drink.  Were then waiting another 5+ mins before we were asked if we would like to order food.  Ok, definitely could have flagged a bartender down for attention if I wanted, but for a first visit was just seeing how the service truly was.  So already, we are off to a bad start.  Our order was to split the Sliders on Mini Garlic Knots, the 5-cheese Melt and order of fries.  1) Sliders were dry and very overcooked.  Was missing the Chipotle mayo and the buns seemed not fresh and too dense with absolutely no Garlic flavor.  Sorry, if you are a burger joint and you put sliders on the menu, they better be damn good.  2) Five Cheese Melt was......incredibly flavorless.  We didn't even finish.  I was shocked.  5 cheeses an grilled sourdough!!!  How is it possible that it could be flavoress?  5 CHEESES!   3) French Fries are the only reason it's not a 1 Star review.  They are really good.  Not the best ever or ground breaking, but still very crisp and delicious.  Their is no way in hell they are worth $6, but they are still good.  My wife and I promised we would give them one more shot and this time be more vocal if needed.  We really want Charr to work out but if the food and service remains the same, our next visit will sadly be our last."}
{"text":"My first and ONLY time Charr will get my money! The manager told me off, including using the \"f\" word, when I phoned about an incomplete delivery order. If they weren't in such a crappy location, I just may have visited in person. Now? Don't think so. There are far better burgers all over Phoenix."}
{"text":"Walking into Charr we had high hopes. They were flatten when we were greeted by the hostess who was seated behind the podium. Not only was the hostess seated,but we had to ask to be seated outside. The hostess never offered inside or outside seating.  Walking outside we noticed the many dirty tables, and the trash from previous customers littering the floor. In addition to the dirty tables, there was broken glass lying on top. The glass came from the lightbulbs above. So we moved inside.  Once inside  we were seated near a server station where you could hear the servers and hostess cursing. In addition to the foul language I witnessed a sever chasing the hostess around the restaurant with a dead bug!  I had ordered a beer on draft which was poured into a warm glass so with in minutes the beer was room temp and unpleasant. We both had burgers of course. I had ordered mine med rare and my girlfriend had ordered hers med well,both came out over and under cooked. For a burger bar I would think you would train your cooks to cook a burgers to order properly.  Truffle fries were nothing special have had better. And finally the bathrooms where so gross that most dive bars bathrooms where better then there's!! Overall would not recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We went here years ago but decided to give it another go the another night after hearing about Charr Cade...they have opened the other side up with some games such as pool and our teen wanted to play.  Unfortunately they charge to play so we passed.  We started out with an order of fried pickles and a beer. They do have a large selection of beer with something for everyone. My husband ordered a burger loaded with bacon and make and cheese, my son had the basic Charr burger and I had the buffalo chicken sandwich. I really did not like my sandwich at all. The chicken was on the rubbery side and the sandwich would fall apart and drip buffalo sauce everywhere every time you tried to take a bite. The little that I ate I had to eat with a fork. The truffle fries were decent though even though they didn't show up until several minutes after our burgers were served. My husband and son liked their burgers which is how they ended up with 3 stars.  The service was a bit spotty as it took a bit to be seated when we arrived even though they were fairly empty and the server was slow with refills and taking our order but it does seem to be a good local spot to grab a beer."}
{"text":"The Mushroom and Brie Burger is amazing! Cool atmosphere and the staff is pretty nice. Only complaint is the TVs are mounted so high that it makes it uncomfortable to sit and watch a game at the bar. All and all good place."}
{"text":"My wife and I were looking for a good hamburger lose to home.  We checked on Yelp and Charr came up. I wasn't so sure because some of the most recent reviews were not so favorable. We decided to take a chance and I am glad that we did. Our server, Kristen was great. She was very friendly and personable. Took our order with a smile and was very attentive to us.  We each ordered a burger, mine with fries and my wife's with onion rings. The food was very good and cooked the right way. Everything tasted very fresh. We look forward to coming back and trying more of the menu. Thanks again for the great service.......leave room for desert, I herd the shakes are great."}
{"text":"Wow. wOw. WOW. Did I say WOW, cuz WOW. And I mean wow in the best possible way! Party of 7 came by on a Friday night with no expectations, no reservations, and a 2 year old which can usually spell out a recipe for disaster but boy did Charr impress!   We were seated right away at a perfect size table and greeted immediately by our very friendly and very competent server. We received info on the specials as well as tips for first timers. Our drinks came right away and our server was even conscientious enough to ask if we should bring the 2 year old's food right away! (YES PLEASE!). Mr. Aiello himself came by to greet us twice and make sure that everything was perfect.   So, what did we have? I can tell you, I had one of the best salmon burgers I've ever had in my whole life. A delicious, perfectly cooked filet atop the most delicious house made garlic knot bun. What I loved most was the fact that the bun never got soggy from the lemon basil mayo sauce and the arugula was so fresh I'd swear that it was snipped that day!  The salmon was perfectly done. The baby had housemade macaroni and cheese that every adult at the table swore was the best ever. I think we might all have it next time as a main dish ourselves. 4 different cheeses mixed in the sauce and topped with a slice of cheddar and baked to perfection. O.M.G. Several of the grown-ups had the Phoenix Burger and the Charr Burger. Everyone said the burgers were DE-LIC-IOUS and cooked to perfection since so many of us have different degrees of doneness that we prefer.  Final friend had the pork tenderloin and while that fell a tad short versus the burgers, the overall dining experience left her feeling 5 star all the way.   Dessert was also superb. I had the Strawberries and Zabaglione sauce while others had the Apple Cobbler served hot with vanilla ice cream. All were super yum.   While this restaurant is very out of the way for us, we will definitely be making an effort to go out of our way again to visit Charr very very soon.  Thank you for a great experience and excellent food!"}
{"text":"Well let's start with the servers they don't know the menu they have no idea how stuff prepared and oh they're really good at mixing up your burger so you get the well-done burger while somebody else gets your medium burger yeah not such a good place to eat I would not recommend it to anyone unless you're in a poor customer service and getting the wrong food and yeah all that good stuff"}
{"text":"My first time eating here. I won't be coming back. The worst service ever!!! I love eating out and do it often. If I pay $12.00 for a burger I expect great service and great food. I got neither! I can't emphasize enough how bad the service was!!! I will be sure to tell people to steer clear of this place!!!"}
{"text":"Great place for a burger. Food is awesome and the truffle fries are top notch!  The bar has a small town vibe but uptown look. It is fully stocked with a great selection. They even have some rare whiskeys I like.  I have been here 3+ times. Joe came out from the kitchen this time and chatted with our family. It was a nice touch and made me want to write a review."}
{"text":"I've lived near Charr for quite some time and FINALLY stopped in for dinner....OMG it is SOOOO GOOD! If you're in the mood for a burger that is on the gourmet end of the spectrum you won't be disappointed. Everything we tried was delicious, including the truffle fries and sweet potato fries. My boyfriend was also very pleased with the beer selection."}
{"text":"You can make better dinner for yourself at home.  For waaaaay cheaper at that. Its such a shame that this replaced the wonderful Market Bistro that used to be there.   As if it wasn't disappointing enough-things have gotten WORSE.  If poor service, mediocre food, and high prices weren't enough to ruin a restaurant, they've gone and gotten the bright idea to have live...er...music...on Saturday night.  (I use the term \"music\" loosely because if that is music, then everyone who can YELL lyrics to a song in an off-tune is a musician.)  So now to add insult to injury they have ruined any ambiance they may have had.   If anyone is wondering why I am only just now posting my opinion of the joint it is this-I have the unfortunate circumstance of living across the street :-/   I NEED EARPLUGS!!!"}
{"text":"Great burgers, excellent grilled flavor, you have got to try the Chipotle mayo, it is awesome. The truffle fries were to die for. Our waitress was very attentive and was on top of all of our needs. We can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Easy location. I only wish they were open and delivered at lunch time. The food is very good. I had the 5 cheese sandwich, a cheese lovers dream, and the housemade onion rings. I had ordered a diet coke which was flat. They could not fix it, so I just drank water. The wait staff was friendly, but kind of slow. I thought it was very, very pricey for what you get. The food was very good. I guess it comes down to what are you tradeoffs for good food?"}
{"text":"Stopped in for just a drink and the service was horrible and they really didn't care that we were there.  The restaurant had maybe 4 tables, so was very slow.  Second time this has happened and will not be coming back.  Sad because I've been in the neighborhood for 30 years and love to support local businesses but not this one!!"}
{"text":"Honestly, the only thing good about this restaurant is that it is in the neighborhood and we have very few restaurants to choose from in Moon Valley.  The food is just okay but the worst thing is the service.  We just waited 35 minutes for a bowl of soup, a salad and a kids meal of chicken fingers and french fries.  If we weren't so desperate for someplace to eat in this area, I would never go there!"}
{"text":"The food was ok but the condition of the kitchen and bathrooms literally made us sick to our stomachs. This was the first and last time we will ever eat here!"}
{"text":"Last night we went to Charr where they had 2 live music bands playing. As always the food was great, the place was packed and we had a lot of fun!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Charr is yet another in a long list of burger restaurants that have sprung up around Phoenix (and across the country). I'm convinced these places justify their high burger prices by adding the descriptor \"gourmet\" to their name, and offering a variety of burger options. Who would have imagined that $10+ for a cheeseburger would be a good deal??  We ordered the American Turkey burger, Charr Burger with cheese, and the kid's meal chicken fingers. We thought the turkey burger was a bit on the dry side. It comes with a garlic aioli, which was flavorful, but there was a lot of it! The cheeseburger was ordered medium, and was more medium-well. It was good, though. The little one loved the chicken fingers and all of us devoured the truffle fries!  Attentive service, nice ambience. Decent food."}
{"text":"Good Burger but on the pricy side for what you get. I work nearby and was hoping for a lunch deal but they aren't open for lunch. Pleasant staff and service was good but no lunch no return trips."}
{"text":"The food was so good! Delicious drinks and great atmosphere! Weekend happy hour is so great. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The food was very good.  I picked up my pre-ordered meal.  The waitress just handed already wrapped up bag, so I paid and took the plastic bag and left.  Opened the bag finding that she never gave me any utensils  or napkins."}
{"text":"I was here last Sunday and must say that I was pleasantly surprised.  I had passed this shopping center on Thunderbird numerous times and wondered what the *&&^% was in there.  Now I know.  The restaurant cuisine is modern American.  What I mean to say is that the food is basic American fare with a twist.    The restaurant has delicious hamburgers...........hence the name  - Charr.  The presentation is also modern as is the restaurant.  I rather enjoyed the Caesar's salad with REAL anchovies and a hamburger with REAL Swiss cheese and crimini mushrooms - yum!  My little one had the mac and cheese that was creamy and done perfectly.  My wife had the turkey burger which was juicy, not dry.  Our server was delightful and had a great sense of humor and was real likeable in general.  I would opt to say that the food is on a five star level.  However, the time to fill the order and receive the food must have been close to one half hour.  I was especially cognizant of the time since I have a seven year old that was hungry and making every minute after ordering count.  My advise to Charr, perfect the order time and you have a winner.  The restaurant offers many daily specials, including hamburgers.  Try it out!"}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews I was sceptical. Turned out to be tasty and no more pricey than the other burger joints we had visited. Friendly staff and happy hour all day Sunday! Will return!"}
{"text":"Visited for Restaurant Week so we had a shared app (crab cake), two entrees (Carolina burger w/string fries and fish and \"chips\"/string fries) and shared dessert. The waiter was friendly but somewhat unattentive and tried to push the other restaurants/deli on to us quite a bit. The food was pretty mediocre but edible..no complaints. I'm not a huge string fry fan so I was hoping for some thicker cut \"chips\". The blueberry bread pudding was okay. It tasted like they used old garlic bread from the other restaurant next door then smothered it in whiskey and butter. We went about 15-20 minutes without a water refill and waited 10 minutes for our card to be picked up. All in all it was just okay but at least now we know and it only cost us $30. I guess that's what Restaurant Week is all about though right?"}
{"text":"I would have giving another star if the burgers were cooked correctly. I think if mostly all you do is burgers they should be cooked the way you asked for and we were the only table they were cooking for at the time. We ordered two burgers and asked for one medium rare and the other medium. The medium rare one came out rare. The medium one came out medium well. So both of us were slightly disappointed but being one off we could manage and didn't want to waste time having one thrown back on.   The burger I had seemed to be seasoned nice with a slight charr. About half the people are like me and will only eat half the roll because that's too much bread to eat. I thought the house made garlic knot was good and not too garlicky with the burger. (but I only ate the smaller half not the whole roll) But my companion eat the whole thing and said all together it was too much garlic so it can go either way.  The truffle string fries are OK but don't didn't taste truffles on our visit. Maybe they left it off or maybe they use real truffle oil that's very delicate? Usually if you taste a lot of truffle flavor it's artificial truffle aroma. So that may be a good thing that we didn't taste the truffle.  We both had margaritas and I'd pass on them them next time as they were large and too much mixer in proportion to booze.  Two burgers that came with the fries and two margaritas about $40.00 before tip."}
{"text":"This place was terrible! The first thing that I noticed when I sat down was the floor was wet. I figured they had just mopped, boy was I wrong! As I was sitting there during my meal a drip of water caught my eye. I looked up and the duct work was leaking! There was water all over the exposed duct work in the ceiling and it was leaking on floor! Gross imagine if that landed in my food or on me.   Now about the food. First it was way over priced. Each item is sold separately. I looked at the drink menu and almost fell over. A cocktail is on average $8. I ordered the 5 cheese melt (sounds yummy right? WRONG) When the sandwich came to the table it looked horrible! Just a large mound of cheese on tiny bread. When I opened the sandwich the inner layers of cheese weren't even melted. I took a bite (thinking it was going to clog my arteries the whole time) and it didn't even have any flavor! A grilled cheese I make at home tastes better. I didn't even finish a half of a half and the waitress never even acknowledge that I didn't even touch my meal.   I will never go here again. Moral of the story... overpriced, gross food and who knows whats dropping into the food as it's being walked around the room."}
{"text":"Best burger in town! And whether you get the truffle fries or the potato cake you won't be disappointed! Patio seating for dining when the weather is nice. Great place to bring visitors from out of town."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited Charr with a couple friends for restaurant week this week. We sat out front and waited for our waiter to take our drink orders... And waited... And waited.  Nearly 10 minutes after we were seated, I try to flag someone down through the front window, and finally our waitress arrived and took our orders. She apologized for the delay, said something about how she had to train someone to enter food orders. It didn't seem exceptionally busy, so I think they just forgot we were seated. I thought this might be an isolated incident, but then I watched another man with a small child get seated near us a half hour later and end up leaving before a waitress ever arrived because the child couldn't wait any longer to eat... I see from the reviews other people have had similar experiences. Maybe the wait staff they're training will improve the service here, but it wasn't great when we went.  The reason I am giving 3 stars is the food. The Carolina burger was delicious... The sauce and bacon were savory, the garlic knot bun was perfect. Their fries were great and they give you plenty of them.  I'd recommend this place for the food, but expect to wait for it."}
{"text":"Stopped by around 1:15 on Sat afternoon. Only 3 or 4 tables have customers. One guy serving and he said to sit anywhere. Took him almost 10 mins to even bring us menus, he was too busy standing behind the bar talking to customers. Finally took our order after another 10 mins. We got talking and finally realized that our food wasn't coming even though others coming in after us had theirs. I had to go up to the waiter and ask if we were going to get our order. An older woman came in and was hustling around, accomplishing more than our waiter! Joe finally came in, came to our table, and while assuring us that there would be no charge for our lunch had to ask what our order had been.  This is 50 minutes after we came in!  He was full of excuses and repeatedly asked us not to yelp him.  Sorry Joe but the public needs to know and you need to pay attention to the number of recent bad reviews. I ordered your Phoenix Burger and it was tasteless, maybe because it had to be cooked so quickly. You never even asked about why I didn't finish it in spite of standing next to me and seeing 3/4 of the burger sitting on my obviously finished with plate! Your waiter never, ever apologized to us. Everybody has bad days in business but take note, apologies go a long way to getting people to try you again.  Fire that waiter, get a better cook, and apologize when your staff screws up."}
{"text":"The only thing that keeps this from being a 5 is the horrible service both times I went. They are hiring, hopefully they will find staff to take them to another level.  Me and my family are foodies and the burgers don't disappoint. Great French fries too!"}
{"text":"Nice patio and good service.  I had the Phoenix burger with truffle fries - both tasty.  I was there for happy hour and told that happy hour only applied to the bar & patio, so I opted for the patio even though I was one of a handful of people there in the middle of the day.  I enjoyed my visit, but wouldn't say it was spectacular.  If I am in the area, I will stop in again."}
{"text":"Absolutley the worst turkey burger i have ever had. My date ordered the salmon salad.......no salmon. She had to substitute chicken. Really, no salmon on a the Friday night before Easter?  The turkey burger was over cooked and rubbery. The bun was stale and unedible. Absolutely zero flavor. What a waste of a Saturday night. As much as I like to support local mom and Pop's, I wont be able to support this one. PV burger Co, or Red Robin for me."}
{"text":"AZ Restaurant Week 2013 brought me to Charr - An American Burger for the first time.    Let's just run down the good things about Charr real quick:   About the restaurant itself:  -takes reservations on Open Table.  Sweet.  -had reservations available on time on our arrival.   something to be said as many places don't!  -nice outdoor patio  -good ambiance and decorations  About the food:   -crab cake appetizer was good. flaky, good flavors, good size for sharing (2 on the plate)  -my cousin loved the truffle fries  (she actually took the leftover fries to go she liked them so much) -I had the salmon burger.   The salmon was perfectly cooked.  I decided to forego the bun, it was delicious on its own.  I get that this is a \"burger joint\" so there's a theme, but it's great as a non-burger too (that's how i would order in the future)  -My cousin had the BBQ burger.   MMM!!!  I had a few bites of it.  Now that's a burger!  Get it! -The garlic knot buns are awesome!   -The Moscow Mule was perfect!  Served in a copper mug, minty fresh, all I hoped for!    My only grumble about this place was that the service was pretty slow.  We sat outside and it seemed like our waitress didn't know if we were in her section or not, though she was friendly.  It took about 10 minutes for anyone to greet us after we had been seated  The meal took about 2 hours to finish for the two of us.  Nevertheless, it was enjoyable!!  If you're up for a leisurely meal, definitely hit up Charr's."}
{"text":"Wow they have a great hamburger now, even my wife is telling me so and she's a salad person.  I ordered mid-rare and it was perfect."}
{"text":"I used to visit Char quite frequently, but stopped coming for a while. I'm happy to say that when my son and I went there tonight, the service was great, the food was tasty, and the atmosphere was pleasant. We even hung out for an hour+ playing pool. Their reverse happy hour looks promising--and it is the only reverse happy hour in the area.  We shared the Char burger and fries, because we didn't want to over do it, and it was filling and tasty. I'm glad to see this successful business in Moon Valley. Great job, Joe and Myra.    :)"}
{"text":"Since we loved Aiellos so much, we had to support them and give this place a try! We ordered the Family Dinner to go from Aiello's Salumeria just down the sidewalk, and ate here while waiting for our food.   Bryan had the green chili burger while I had the pizza burger. We decided to order different ones so we could split and try both. The buns are actually garlic knots or something similar, but they are shaped like cinnabons in which the dough is spiraled all the way to the center. Unique fun idea but man, does this make for a horribly messy burger. You are forced to gobble up the burgers very quickly so they don't fall apart on you. The pizza burger was good, but I liked the chili one more just because there was more flavor to it. It's not that spicy either, so if you're afraid of spice, you are safe to order this chili one.   The restaurant and bar are very nice. I loved the dark woods and back lighting. The place is alot more trendy and fun in comparison to the rustic, yet charming older restaurant on Central Avenue close to Camelback. I'm hoping for this place to be a success, but I feel like there are a few more \"things\" that need to be worked out. Even if their burgers are just okay to most people it seems (after reading several previous reviews), let me assure you that their regular Italian food is their specialty and what they're amazing at!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite local joints. My son has severe shellfish allergies and they have always been very attentive to that. There is a nice selection of food and we have always had great waitstaff. We have never been to Charr where Joe, the owner, hasn't come over to greet us. He is very active in our community helping our schools raise money for things like music programs. We appreciate Joe and love Charr"}
{"text":"So I wanted to give Charr another go after my so so last experience. Sad to say that it was another unimpressive showing. If you are claiming to a burger bar, COOK BURGERS TO THE REQUESTED TEMP!!! I can get a properly cooked burger at village inn why can't I at a \"burger bar\" . The char on outside is great but doesn't make up for An over cooked dry burger. I will not return."}
{"text":"Monday night burger special was awesome. Our server was very attentive and friendly. We will be back next Monday."}
{"text":"We have been here a few times and the food is always good but the service is totally dependent on whether or not the owner is in the room. If he is walking around the dining room the service is good. If not, good luck getting any food."}
{"text":"Food was great. Had the portobello. Yummy!! Service was great. Was a little concern from reading previous reviews!! Only thing is that happy hour is limit to bar and patio and till 5. Place was empty at 6.  Will go again!!"}
{"text":"The food is FANTASTIC. Zucchini, pickles, artichoke dip, wings, French onion... all amazing. Highly suggest coming!!! Drinks are great too!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here because we were in the mood for 'fresh' hamburgers. When we arrived on a Sunday about 6:30pm, the place was almost completely empty. This scared me a little, but there was a local NFL game starting at that time (Cardinals vs Seahawks) and, it seems, everyone was at the game. I'm told the place normally has a wait to get in.  Inside, they have 4 large flat screen TVs (3 over the bar, 1 at the opposite corner) showing sports with closed captioning on (thank you!).  My wife and I each ordered burgers and she had a side of the Mac and Cheese. My burger came with fries.  The hamburger buns are very unique. They are like a swirled garlic bread. However, there was really no noticeable garlic taste, which is a good thing as far as I'm concerned. But each time I brought the burger up to my mouth, the aroma of garlic from the bread was quite nice.  The Mac and Cheese has elbow macaroni sitting a soup of a cheese blend that is more like how 'grandma used to make' then you might expect. It was, like the burgers, exceptional.  The fries are shoestring style (very thin, very crunchy) and everything tastes fresh (not frozen) and home made. The burgers are not uniform in shape or thickness, which tells me they are made by hand. Hallelujah!  The service was outstanding. The staff was extremely attentive. I noticed they have a 'Vernors Pound Cake' on the desert menu. Vernor's is a drink made in Detroit (where I was born and raised). I asked if the restaurant was Detroit-inspired and was told it's actually Brooklyn, New York-inspired and they really like Vernor's Ginger Ale in New York.   They also have a root beer float on the menu, so I asked the staff if they offer a Vernor's float instead. (A Vernor's float is known by folks in Detroit as a 'Boston Cooler' and its no different than a root beer float, except you substitute Vernor's for root beer.)  They never heard of it before (not shocking, since no one outside of Detroit has ever heard of it) but they were more than happy to make one for me. And it was delicious!  My wife thought the ice tea she ordered tasted a little off, but she didn't say anything to the staff. I have no doubt they would have made it right if she brought it to their attention.   She also ordered the Vernor's Pound Cake for desert. She thought it was too rich for her liking, but it wasn't bad by any means.  It appears the three restaurants beside each other are all owned and run by the same entity. There is Charr, then a pizza place (Isa's Pizza) and then a fine dining restaurant called Aiello's East Coast Italian.  There were plenty of items on the menu I wanted to try, such as baby back ribs and a grilled chicken sandwich. The pizza served next door looked good and Aiello's also looks like a nice place for us to try as well.  So we have four reasons to go back (try each of the other two restaurants, try other menu items at Charr, and if worse comes to worst, we would definitely go back to Charr and have REAL, fresh handmade burgers again! If I was going to open my own burger joint, this is similar to how I would do it.  There's only so many fast-food burgers one can ingest before desperately craving something that isn't factory made and doesn't require a loan to pay off. (our complete total for dinner and desert was $39 after tax. Quite reasonable and fair considering the quality and quantity of the food and the excellent service we received.)"}
{"text":"I was in town for business with a colleague and was recommended this place for dinner.  - oyster shooters: great bloody mary mix, okay oysters - zucchini fries: juicy and fresh, but limp with no crunch. I would pass on this next time - Phoenix burger: a hint of heat, but otherwise meh. The bun is not a normal bun, but rather some sort of knotted bun that fell apart when I bit into it. It was definitely hard to eat. The meat was well-cooked though (hit right on med-rare). Truffle fries were thin and right on. They had perfect crunch - flat iron steak: coworker enjoyed it, as well as the green bean and potato cake side - lemontini: really tasty   The bartenders were great. Jill and Mimi were fantastic company. This is a solid place for good conversation and decent food, but definitely not the best burger I've had. I will say it is a place with great value. During their reverse happy hour ($3 well drinks, $3 off appetizers, $5 burgers), our total came out to $60 before tip. That was for 2 oyster shooters, 3 drinks, zucchini fries, phoenix burger, 2 raw oysters, and the flat iron steak. Not bad!"}
{"text":"We were thrilled to see that Joe was opening Charr in Moon Valley along with Mini-Aiello's and his awesome pizza place. We were not disappointed.  From the hostess to the bartender to our waitress to Joe himself coming to chat with us, you feel like you are a regular at a restaurant that you've been going to for years. We were seated and ordered drinks, some alcoholic and some not, and all were good. The dirty Grey Goose martini was especially good. It's nice to find a place that will make it dirty when asked, instead of skimping on the olive juice. Always a plus for us is a strong, free wi-fi connection. Just ask your server for the password.  For our appetizers, our table had the tomato bisque soup, onion rings, and the red fresno pepper poppers. The soup was very creamy and thick, and the goat cheese was a great added flavor. The poppers brought some extreme heat to the table. These aren't your wimpy Sonic jalapeno poppers. The onion cream cheese filling cut the heat a bit with a nice tang, but be warned, these things pack a punch! As to the onion rings, I won't call them a \"miss\", but they were just so-so after the other two great offerings.  Various burgers were ordered along with some sandwiches. Everyone loved the obviously fresh-made garlic knot buns and fresh toppings. The sauteed crimini mushrooms and carmelized onions on my steak and blue sandwich were awesome. If you are a fan of the blue cheese, ask for extra. It was a little skimpy on my sandwich for my taste.  We were offered the desserts (made by Joe) including bread pudding and an apple crumble, but we were all too full to try those. Definitely next time."}
{"text":"This place is wonderful.. My work had a Friday night get together here and everything was amazing from the second we walked in to the moment we left the food was good service was GREAT and the atmosphere is fun and laid back... Thank u to everyone there we will definitely be back....."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place, but unfortunately they just did not pan out. The Phoenix burger was in serious need of seasoning, as were the sweet potato fries. My husband tried the Cuban and while the garlic aioli was good (if you love garlic like I do), it was overpowering and the only thing you could taste. Bar had no happy hour options and we were told it was because they hadn't put one together yet? Sorry excuse for spendy drinks, I think. Overall a very pricey dinner excursion for a mediocre meal."}
{"text":"Another disappointment from Aiellos owned businesses. From their original restaurant to their current pjzza place, Italian restaurant and now Charr. I'm done with this business, just sad. Burger was ordered rare and came out a heavy medium, gave them a second chance and it came out raw. A burger place should at least be able to make a burger. Their onion rings were good but that's all I can say. My son begrudgingly ate his Grilled cheese, I tried it and it was dry and lacking flavor. A tip for charrs, don't melt cheese on focaccia bread open faced then stick the pieces together and think you made grilled cheese, there's more to it than that.  Lazy kitchen and generally underwhelming food."}
{"text":"For burgers, this place gets 5 stars! Perfectly done, delectably served on perfect fresh made rolls! The truffle fries rock! Their desserts are amazing! Highly recommended this place! Great prices too!"}
{"text":"I cannot review the food as we didn't stay. We had a reservation for 6 pm which was not needed as the place was almost empty. A hostess managed to ask our name and stepped ahead to seat us. We picked our way through food which seemed to have been on the floor for days, only to be shown to a table that had not been cleaned off or set up for the next customer. REALLY? I asked to be taken to another table and was told they were all reserved. REALLY? The place was almost empty and it was 6 pm. What excuse can there be for a dirty dining room and tables sitting there with food and dishes not cleared. What kind of surprises could there be in the kitchen? WE LEFT."}
{"text":"Fun atmosphere with a large selection of beers.  Fun time with great meal and great service.  Fries are perfect."}
{"text":"Went for Spring Restaurant week hoping to check out a new local spot with a few friends.  Unfortunately this ended up being the worst dining experience of my life.    We were seated for 10-15 minutes before anyone came over to our table.  Waitress was awkward and possibly on drugs (?!).  We got our appetizers 30 minutes after ordering.  When our entree eventually came, it was cooked incorrectly and was incomplete, missing sides of French fries for each burger.    The owner came by our table several times making crass jokes and being offensive. The waitress unapologetically blamed the slow service on \"trivia night\" and only being staffed with two waitresses.  To top it off when we go to address our experience with management, the rude owner comes over and tells us to GET OUT, mocks our concerns, and asks us to never come back. NEVER have I felt more uncomfortable and offended than during my visit to Charr.   The sad thing is, the food here was decently good."}
{"text":"You would expect a burger place named Char would know how to cook a burger to temperature, but sadly they seem to have a consistent problem with this. Now, that's not to say it wasn't a decent burger, but are there burger joints that do it better? You bet! Hop Doddys and Rehab Burger both in Scottsdale, I think cook a slightly better burger. That being said, why did I rate Char a 4? The service is what kicks this place up a notch. Everyone is so welcoming, including the owner who is from NY and walks the dining room asking his customers how their meal was. Oh, and the fries were pretty good too. The only downsides so far are the burgers and the hostess who walks around like she's on Xanax. I mean, come on, if you're going to hire a hostess then hire one who has a bit more pep and enthusiasm. Honestly, she looked positively bored."}
{"text":"I have been here 3 times. The food is very good. They have a good menu, and an excellent beer and liquor selection! The first two times I came here, the service was horrible. Our servers paid no attention to us, forgot to bring us our drinks after we ordered, and acted like they didn't want to be here. I decided to give it one more shot due to the quality of the food and beverages. Finally, I was not disappointed! My server, Ashley was wonderful. Not too overbearing, but ver friendly and present. She paid attention to details, and fulfilled every need I have. I am glad that I can continue to come here! Ashley gets 5 stars! Due to previous experiences, I am giving 4 to Charr."}
{"text":"The burger was actually pretty good. Love the shoe string fries. The service wasn't bad. The atmosphere was a little dull though. It felt really tense in the restaurant. I'm not too sure why that was, to be honest, but the food was great."}
{"text":"Went to Charr's last night for restaurant week. It was busy, good Saturday night vibe. Owner (Joe) was circulating and jovial. Though they are on the pricey side on their regular menu, the restaurant week deal was generous. A large and very strong cocktail, the Charrismo (their take on a cosmopolitan). Quite good. Appetizers, I had crab cakes, GF had wings after asking to make sure they weren't too spicy. They were about a 5 on a scale of 10 spiciness, too much for her. Waitress offered to exchange 'em, but we simply swapped. I thought they were great. Fries with orders, I had salmon burger (great), GF had Portobello Burger (phenomenal). I had a beer flight, she had a glass of Chardonnay. Then we still had desserts, but were full so we'll get to those tonight. Really a great deal for 30 bucks per. I'll be back, probably for Happy Hour because they are a bit pricey on the regular menu....."}
{"text":"OMG . My husband and I were looking for a new casual dining place and happened to drive by Charr. We,went in on a Sunday evening and sat at the bar because they had all day happy hour. We ordered the spinach and artichoke dip as,an appetizer. It was Amazing! By the time our dinner came we were stuffed! My husband ordered a Buffalo Burger which was great and I had the chicken salad which was very flavorful. We left with 3 big to go boxes and,will be back soon. Oh  and great friendly service and clean too (:"}
{"text":"My wife and I came here for restaurant week -- the pull of a $33 couple's dinner was just too enticing. We will not be coming back. There were issues with every single course.   The crab cakes were cold by the time they reached our table. My medium burger was cooked perfectly, but my wife's well done burger was cold. While the buns were delicious, the burger was slapped together like an afterthought. I had a dollop of BBQ sauce under my top bun and a puddle beneath it. The ice cream in our apple cobbler was clearly freezer burned.  To top it all off, the head chef was wandering around the restaurant, greeting guests and getting kind of touchy feely with people. He also had a conversation with a server about an unhappy customer within earshot of our table.  Look, I get that $33 for two people is on caliber with Chili's, but at least I remember Chili's consistently delivering HOT food -- even if said hot food tastes like hot garbage. If the goal of Restaurant Week is to get people to come back and try more expensive menu items, Charr failed on basically every level."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend for dinner during restaurant week - it was $33 for a couple, you got an appetizer to split, 2 entrees, and a dessert to split. We started with the chili glazed wings. Now I'm not much of a wing person but these were awesome - super crisp and the glaze was amazing. For our entrees I picked the mushroom & brie burger and my boyfriend got the phoenix burger which both came with truffle fries. The server failed to ask how we wanted our burgers done and without being asked I forgot to specify so I ended up with a well done burger which I'm not into. The flavors were there just the fact that it was overcooked ruined it for me. My boyfriend enjoyed his though. The fries were phenomenal! I love truffle fries and these were some of the best I've had, really thin and the perfect level of crisp. For dessert we got a slice of cheesecake - nothing special, but it was good. Decent experience overall."}
{"text":"I was disappointed on my experience.  Great concepts but the burger had no seasoning, the bun was cold.  My wife asked for no sauce and the added sauce, but then only to take off the bacon and add cheese over the top of there mistakes.  They put cold onions and cold bacon back on my wife's burger... The fried zucchini was not very good see photo. We were disappointed"}
{"text":"Ate there last night. Place should be great with nice surroundings, quality ingredients, and diverse menu. Restaurant failed at the two key places. A brand new server who was slow and inefficient was irritating, but the real sin was over cooking the burgers. 4 people at the table ordered medium and 1 was served medium and 3 well done.  I assume the beef was as high quality as everything else, but I had no way to tell with meat that over cooked."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here with my husband and two little kids.  The burgers were outstanding and the cocktails were perfection. Even the kid's meals were delish!  Perfect little local joint."}
{"text":"Joe makes the best friggin burgers hands down!  The rest of the menu is very inventive and plenty of options that are non burger related. Brian the head waiter is awesome and a pleasure to see . The beer is always ice cold and the shakes are delicious!  $5 burger mondays are insane!"}
{"text":"Great food! I have been twice, once for dinner and once for lunch. Service was great both times, so I'm not sure what the others are complaining about. They  have a few decent craft beers on tap as well so that's a bonus. The only thing I didn't quite like is the buns, which seem to fall apart creating a mess. The truffle fries are delicious."}
{"text":"We love this place! Great burgers, wonderful truffle fries and an awesome bar selection! Plus you can bring your dog on the patio.   It's a nice, local, family-run establishment."}
{"text":"Delicious burgers, soup, fries,  and flat-bread caprese!  I expected the bun to be more like the garlic knots but it had no special taste, just a different shape.  The service was a little slow, most noticeable when a table of 5 people that arrived 5-7 minutes after us were served 5 minutes before we were."}
{"text":"Hit up Charr: An American Burger Bar this evening for Arizona Restaurant Week 2018!  Not only was it my first time at Charr, but it was my first time participating in Arizona Restaurant Week!  So the premise behind Arizona Restaurant Week is it allow us (the consumers) to try new restaurants and new menu items at a somewhat discounted rate.  My wife and I paid $33 for us as a couple for an appetizer that we shared, two entrees and a dessert that we also shared.  Drinks and anything else are excluded.  The restaurant is in a little strip mall of sorts right on Thunderbird in Phoenix.  Very convenient location with plenty of ample parking!  The first thing I noticed when I walked in was this gigantic chalkboard in front of me that said - MILKSHAKE BAR.   Sold!  ...except, I wasn't there for a milkshake, but it sounded good.  I may need to come back for a milkshake at some point in time.  Forget about the milkshake for now.  Anywho, the restaurant was clean and do not let the word \"bar\" fool you.  Yes, there just happens to be a bar in the restaurant, but I would not call it a bar, per se and we were not there to do any heavy drinking, anyway.   Back to my review... we were seated right away and considering it was a Friday evening during Arizona Restaurant Week, I was pleasantly surprised.  Music was playing and it was loud enough to hear the lyrics, but not loud enough so that you couldn't hear yourself think or carry on a conversation with your hot date.     We were waited on promptly and our drinks were brought very quickly.  We knew more or less what we wanted so it did not take long for our food to begin piling up on our table.  For our appetizer, we went with Panko Parmesan Zucchini.  The panko was golden brown, crispy and delicious.  The zucchini was still crispy and not mushy.  It was very green and fresh!  So delicious!  The perfect appetizer that didn't leave you feeling stuffed.  It was the perfect start to our meal.  For my entree, I opted for the salmon burger.  You can probably tell from my other reviews that I absolutely heart salmon .  I mean, I could seriously eat salmon every day of the week if my wallet allowed it.  The salmon was grilled to perfection and quite fresh.  It wasn't skunky like salmon can be and it wasn't dried out like it can be so easily.  On top of the salmon was a hefty bed of fresh mixed greens in addition to several slices of fresh red onion, a couple slices of tomatoes and several pieces of fresh butter lettuce.  Soooo good!  The bun was fresh, warm and awesome.  I've had several salmon burgers and this one from Charr is one I'd recommend for Restaurant week!  The burger was accompanied by a small trough of skinny fries.  They appear to love the use of parmesan cheese as the french fries much like the panko zucchini was lightly sprinkled with salt and parmesan cheese.  An awesome compliment to my salmon burger!  For dinner, I was hoping to obtain the cobbler, but sadly enough, they were sold out of it.  We instead opted for the brownie which was baked fresh in-house and still warm and then smothered with a large helping of vanilla ice cream.  I don't think I need to go into gory details about the brownie.  I would've taken a photo of it, but my lovely wife dug into it faster than you can say \"restaurant week\".  I'm pretty much stuffed right now, but terribly happy.  The perfect start to our Memorial Day weekend as we're thinking about our veterans and those who paid the ultimate sacrifice.  I will end this review by saying I would highly recommend a visit to Charr.  I know Arizona Restaurant Week is ending this weekend, but a visit to Charr is still a worthwhile endeavor for your next meal out with family and/or friends.  The service was pleasant, quick and polite.  The food... well, I think I discussed the food enough and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised just as I was.  Thanks for having us and thanks for letting us spend Restaurant Week with you guys!"}
{"text":"My husband enjoyed his Hawaiian burger.  The barbeque burger was Ok except the barbeque sauce was very sweet.  The server was good but was very touchy feely and kept calling me pet names like \"babe\" and \"sweetheart\" which made me uncomfortable since he was at least 15 years younger than I am."}
{"text":"They were legitimately too dumb to properly help us out with even getting seated.  What's the deal with the service here? It's some of the worst we have ever experienced."}
{"text":"Drinks are expensive. I don't think I have ever paid $27 for 3 beers before this. Food is hit and miss. The crab-cake burger is horribly dry, stick with the regular burgers. Place smelled of standing water last time I was in, said something about that and received a funny look. They are doing this thing where there is a jukebox that is the only source of aural ambience in the place. When no one is paying to hear music the place feels really dead, you can hear the clinking of cutlery from the kitchen - makes we want to leave. The bathrooms don't seem very clean. They have some competition now up on Greenway, let's see if they can step it up. Need to extend their hours, which are confusing."}
{"text":"I ordered to-go from UberEATS and this place did not disappoint. Super yummy, even as take out. I would definitely order from here again. The onion rings and Mac n cheese are awesome!!"}
{"text":"Went there a few times before and had the best mac n cheese bacon burger. Never had any issues whatsoever. Tonight went in with a group of 5. Two of the people work there and one did a no call no show since the owner refused to allow her to call in sick. We all went in and the owner refused service to all of us and made us all leave. I have never dealt with such unethical business practice. Just because an employee quits or does a no call no show because you refuse to allow her to call out sick you automatically ban them from eating there and the people they bring in... I was planing on buying the $14 burger a side of mac and cheese and a few mixed drinks.. So you lost a few customers.. Great owner.."}
{"text":"The best french fries I have ever had. I didn't taste any truffle, but they were thin and crispy and cooked just right. I had the bbq burger and it was delish. The only reason I took off a star was service. Our waitress apparently knew the people at another table and spent all of her time speaking to them. We had empty glasses and a long wait to get our order taken and then to get our check. If the service was up to par I'd go back sooner."}
{"text":"I had a Groupon for Charr so my husband and I decided to go there for date night. I loved Aiello's when it was open and I like the Salumeria they have next door. Charr  was decent but not overwhelmingly good.  The atmosphere is nice... I like the decor. Most of the servers are attractive young males.  I had a Moscow Mule which was refreshing and potent. I thought the drinks, including the beer were overpriced.  My husband ordered the Charr burger, cooked medium rare. He said it came medium well. He still thought the beef tasted good though.   I ordered the roasted veggie sandwich. It was okay. The aioli that came on it was delicious. The bun that both my sandwich and my husband's burger came on was good and I liked the idea but it came apart on both of us.  The fries were thin and crispy and yummy but our server only brought out one serving for us to share. I noticed other tables of two each had their own serving... hmmmm. Luckily we were more than full despite sharing one serving of fries.  Service was good except for when my husband had to flag someone down for some mayo after getting our food. It took a solid 5 minutes.   Our total bill before the Groupon discount for 2 burgers, fries, and 2 alcoholic beverages was around $45. A little overpriced for a burger date night.  We will return for happy hour. The drinks were tasty and I am eager to try some of their appetizers."}
{"text":"Much-needed upscale place in Moon Valley.  Cheated on my standard, Ammacapanne's, 3 times to try this place.  Much better fare, but much worse service.  This most recent visit, the hostess seated us and I asked for a reminder on what the WiFi password was (I'm not a total douche...my wife and I run a small biz together and commonly work over meals and drinks).  The hostess kinda curtly said she didn't know if the place even has WiFi (I knew it did) and didn't know the password if it did.   No effort to go get it.  Finally waited for a server, who vaguely thought she knew it.  I'm not in the HRM industry, except as a consumer, but I can't imagine not training my staff on this.  Love the ambiance and food. Just disappointing service in my 3 visits.  The servers at Ammacapanne's still win the day in this area for me."}
{"text":"This is a crazy place. I've visited twice now. Both times have sat on the dog friendly patio. I've had a different waitress each visit however, they both seemed so uninterested in being at work. Also the yelp hours listed never seem to match what they're open. Last time as we were leaving another couple showed up thinking they were open till 10 weekdays.   Here's the saddest part, I love the location and the menu. But the wait staff is so unwelcoming it's amazing. First visit ( we think they're open till 10(yelp listed) we show up at 8:15. At 8:45 while eating our entrees the waitress turns off the fire and starts closing down. Ok ok we're done can we have a box?  Tonight our waitress had three tables (all outside) we ordered a salad and an appetizer and twenty minutes later they show up with our entree right behind when we ordered them at least 10 minutes apart. Our waitress spent the majority of her time in at the bar with the other staff eating pasta from a to go container from somewhere.   Ok also don't order the veggie burger. I know I know it's a meat place, but I was trying to make a healthy option tonight. Tasted like when I tried a Pinterest fail recipe. Just get a burger."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Charr for restaurant week. We were a little early for our reservation, so we sat at the bar. The bartender was really nice and lively. I ordered a cocktail off their menu and it was pretty good.   When we sat down for our meal it took some time for our server to get to us. She came to us and asked if we had been helped since we already had drinks. I guess the hostess didn't inform her?  We ordered crab cakes for our appetizer, the portabella burger with truffle fries for me and steak with marsalla sauce with potato cake and asparagus for the boyfriend, and bread pudding with Bourbon blueberries for dinner. This is the reason I'm giving this place 3 stars: service was really slow! Another couple sat next to us after we were seated and they got their food before us. I'm not sure if it was because of the steak we ordered, but it was a long time until we got our main course. The actual food tasted good, but nothing to die for really. Also, their tap water tasted a bit off. Maybe it wasn't filtered? Eek.. Just like this rating, my experience at Charr was A-Ok."}
{"text":"Ok food ... bad service  The burgers are ok if you order a medium. .. if you like rare or another way don't expect to receive it.  Service was very slow ... 2+ hours for dinner???? Also 1hr and 15min into waiting at our table we get told some of our order is not available.... go figure."}
{"text":"UGH. That's the word that comes to mind when I think back on our visit to Char.  It was restaurant week and I can only assume that it was their first time participating judging by the fact that they ran out of half of the items on their menu.  The 3 things we wanted to order- guess what were out.  And the poor maybe a day over 16 year old waitress had no idea how to handle that.  We wanted the oysters, we were told they were out, so we said we take the chicken wings and guess what, they were out too!  So, of the appetizer choices we were forced into a crab cake.  This crab cake was mediocre at best. Crusty on the outside like a potato cake and mushy in the middle.  Gross.  We received potato pancakes with our meals that looked exactly like the crab cake- and just as disgusting.  When some older gentleman that I can only assume was an owner came by to check on us he noticed I had barely touched the potato cake.  When he asked me if I liked it, I began to respond with a \"not so much\" look on my face and he quickly ran off before I could even share my feedback with him.  This place needs to get it together. You obviously weren't ready for restaurant week or a serving food in general."}
{"text":"I like having a local spot that is always simple and consistent. Love the pulled pork sandwich and sliders as well as the YUMMY truffle shoe string fries. Always a welcoming friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"Great food went there with a large group sat after moving. Got in easy, server was attentive, chef even came to our table! The food was delis! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been to Charr about three times since it opened, in hopes that things would improve but the never do.  I've had many of the same experiences as several other Yelpers -- they are out-of-stock on what I order, the burgers are never cooked as per the customer's order, tables and floor outside sit littered with old food and napkins for WAY too long, rude service, over-priced, etc., etc.  Not sure why they don't read these reviews, learn from their mistakes and make the changes necessary to be a good restaurant."}
{"text":"Wonderful burgers,  excellent onion rings, good service.  Just don't order dessert.  We ordered apple cobbler and was served blueberry bread pudding.  When we questioned if it was apple cobbler our waited assured us it was cobbler. After we ate a few bites... no apple! The waitress told us she has been waiting for a customer to question it.  We still were charged the full $7.00 for a dessert we didn't order or want! Too bad the rest of the meal was great!"}
{"text":"Very friendly server but unable to overlook the well done burger I was served after ordering it medium.  A burger place should be able to get that part right. My daughter's medium-well burger was cooked to the same burnt on the outside, dry as dirt inside consistency. Truffle fries were delicious hence the two stars."}
{"text":"Good burger, found this place on IDine."}
{"text":"Food was OK...just OK.  Service was miserable.  My wife ordered a Portobello burger that was inedible.  Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"The place looked interesting thought Id give it a try, bad idea.  Service is average - Food NOT good.  Burger was dry flavor bland and on horrible bread.  Even didnt like the fries really??? The price of the burgers a bit high.  Best burger Ive had in town is the GRIND costs $12, bad burgers should be $7-8."}
{"text":"I wish I had a better update.  We have been to this restaurant sporadically after our review in 2013.  Unfortunately, we will not be returning.  The food wasn't that bad, but the service and drinks were horrible.  The restaurant was only about 20% full, and it seemed fully staffed -- there was no excuse for the poor service.  Drink order took about 10 minutes, and despite the 2 hours we were there, no one ever asked if we wanted another drink.  It took 37 minutes to get our appetizer.  I guess if the food was outstanding, we might give it another try, but my husband's medium burger was well well done, and the rest of our food was underwhelming."}
{"text":"My husband and I thought \"oh awesome! We love burgers!\" but when we sat down to look at the menu there were only 5 burgers. Odd...since it's a BURGER bar. Oh well... we ordered the Caprese Flatbread and two BBQ burgers. The flatbread was a cold piece of focaccia with tasteless tomatoes and some bland mozzarella. Not impressed. The burgers were good, messy but good. I was really disappointed that there were so few choices of burgers at this place. Their truffle fries were very good. The staff...well they didn't seem to care that we were there.  Sadly we won't be back here. They had potential but for the money they won't get a second chance."}
{"text":"wasn't happy at all!! when in for lunch saw the menu online it looked great got there before 12:45. there was only 3 people it took a long time to get our food out. the menu wasn't close to what I saw in the internet, the server there wasn't even helpful. one of my employee had chicken sandwich with eggplant. where's the chicken. i will never go again nor my business staff that came with me. to bad there pizza next door is awesome...."}
{"text":"Charr hosted our company holiday party last night and it was fantastic! Myrah and Joe were great to work with and everything exceeded my expectations. They have a buyout package, so we had the restaurant to ourselves for the evening, and Myrah was great working with our DJ and photo booth and ensuring everything would work for the night of. I arrived before the event started and it being my first visit to charr, I was very impressed with the atmosphere and the staff was working hard to make sure everything looked great. They provided a buffet dinner and the bar was available to employees. Once it got dark, they lit the fire pits on the patio and it had a nice, warm feeling to it. I would definitely recommend them for a private party for a large group (we had about 60 attendees). The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because the food was from Aiello's (their sister restaurant), so I can't speak to the food at charr's. But I will definitely return and recommend them based on the service they provided last night and throughout the planning process."}
{"text":"BEST BURGER IN THE WORLD! THE WORLD! Jesus himself would have loved this burger! Awesome service. Awesome music. About this time of year I usually get super fed up with X-mas music. So theydefinitelyget extra points in my book for that!"}
{"text":"Went back for a return visit and were surprised to see the addition of entrees.  French Onion soup was superb, as was the crab cake appetizer, and our dinners (Pork Tenderloin and Hangar Steak with Marsala wine sauce and mushrooms). Pork was juicy and sauce was just right with the apples lightly cooked but still with a bit of a crunch, and the steak was cooked just as ordered - medium rare."}
{"text":"I like this place. By FAR the best deal is the Hot Dog (Phoenix or Carolina style) for $6 which comes on the same huge pretzel bun as the burger and comes with excellent truffle fries.  The wedge ($6) is very small."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in on a Monday night because we saw they have a $5 Charr burger special. Its hard to beat that price, so we thought we'd give it a shot. I'm glad we did! We both got the Charr burger, and it was great. The meat was cooked perfectly, and I like how they give you one big, thick burger instead of two small ones. The pretzel bun was also good, but could have been pretzel-ier. I wanted to try the turkey burger, but since the $5 special only applied to the Charr burger, I had regular beef. But next time I go back, and I will go back, then I will pay full price and try something else."}
{"text":"Char is very close to my house. I went in on a Saturday to watch football. Only five other people in their, sat at the bar and ordered the spicy margarita, the bartender looked at me confused and said, \"huh?\"  I repeated my order and showed her the menu. The marg came in a pint glass and was a MESS chopped up jalapeño with seeds floating in it. It's a BAR don't they have a shaker/strainer?  I sat for a very long while before I got her attention to order their wings. The bartender made fun of me when I ordered them, she was laughing and mocking me saying \"this girl says she wants some wings\". They came out and were covered in way too much sauce. Half moon has much better wings had more choices of sauce.  I like the concept of this place and the way the bar is back-lit but there are a lot of other choices in the area with much better service and food."}
{"text":"We had food delivered which can be dicey for a regular restaurant but I have to say we were impressed and surprised.  I had the Salmon with lemon sauce and capers, my partner had the Grilled Garlic Chicken - both were cooked perfectly, the potato cake was even in a separate container so the sauces did not soak up into them.  The portions were more than generous, even for the salmon.  I had dinner and lunch from the one dish.  I will definitely be ordering from them again."}
{"text":"Atmosphere was good, service was good, onion rings were absolutely amazing.   Ordered my burger mid rare, but it came raw.   They did the right thing and comped the burger....we will give them another try, because had the burger been cooked right, I'm sure it would have been great and they were nice people, doing the right thing."}
{"text":"We ate there yesterday for lunch, food and service were terrible, it was lunch time and only two tables with customers. We both had a burger ordered them med rare, they came out med well..also ordered onion rings but i guess he forgot so we finally got them and they were doughy and not cooked enough. Will never go back YUK!"}
{"text":"Disappointing... food was not good, they messed up our order, did not take anything off the bill for doing so and when I asked about why they gave me attitude and were very rude."}
{"text":"I went to Charr for the second time. I was with my father who lives in nearby Moon Valley. He was eager to try Charr after a neighbor recommended it. It was a complete failure.   GOOD NEWS: burgers now come with side of  fries for the same price.   BAD NEWS: The service was horrible. We just ordered burgers. I had the Carolina (with bbq sauce ON THE SIDE) he ordered the Phoenix burger. In only a few minutes our food was brought out by a someone from the kitchen. They asked, \"who had the Carolina?\" and set the plate in front of me when I responded and then gave the other burger to my father.   My burger had BBQ on it (not on the side as I ordered) had it came on the side I would not have touched it. My fathers burger was just a plain cheese burger. We figured that we got someone else' order as it came out so fast. My father told the waitress about his lack of \"Phoenix\" in his burger and she went to the kitchen before I could get to my BBQ sauce issue or our theory of it being for a different table. Someone came from the kitchen and took the \"Phoenix\" burger away and came back 20-30 seconds later with roasted pepper on it and left. We got the waitress again to say that it still didn't have the chipotle mayo and she left immediately to get some despite me trying to tell her about the bbq burger I did not want.   We told the waitress when she came back with the mayo that my burger had bbq on it and not on the side, but rather than having them recook my burger (they took my burger away but left my father to eat his) we just abandoned the meal. Also we never got flatware and/or napkins the entire time.   Overall we spent 3 or 4 times longer trying to get our servers attention and get the order fixed (not including time it would take to fix mine had we stayed) than it took to get the food after we ordered.   We are not picky eaters nor complainers. But they failed to do accommodate our one simple request (no bbq) and also simply forgot two components (the only two things that make it a \"Phoenix\" burger rather than a cheese burger) on another and made it a circus trying to fix them rather than just simply scrap the two burgers and remake them again correctly.   The whole experience made me think that they just did not give a s**t. Little to no effort by the waitress and how can a kitchen claim they make great burgers if their solution to missing components it just to add them several minutes after they serve the food."}
{"text":"What a great experience.  So happy we weren't let down.  We were customers of Aiello's when they were open (same Owners) and always had a great meal. Had the fish & chips & fries and it was great.  The fish was so mild and fresh and the breading was delicious...not over breaded.  My husband had the burger and I tasted it (of course) and agreed with him, that it was a winner.  The dessert we had was the blueberry bread pudding with whiskey sauce and it was a home run!!  Of course, the best part of the whole experience was Brian, who always took care of us at Aiello's and now is at Charr.  We will definitely be returning.....many times!!"}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time being here and the first was okay, I just got a grilled cheese but my friend got a burger and she said it was overcooked. This time I ordered a burger and she got steak sandwich, we both ordered medium rare...I thought that means pink in the middle...well, they both came out well done. Granted they tasted fine, but when you prefer your meat cooked a certain way, you'd hope it is. If you order, order well below how you like your meat, it will likely come out more done then expected. I guess next time I will ask they don't even kill the cow, just embarrass it =-p"}
{"text":"Just finished eating here. Great food, great service, i'll definitely be back! 2AM burger is awesome, and the truffle fries are good. Good neighborhood spot for sure. Started off with the chili wings and they were delightful."}
{"text":"Horrible service, overpriced food.  Brugers are decent but inconsistent.  Tried it 3 times and its hit or miss.  For the price they should be awesome everytime.  I had a server tell me my opinion didnt matter when i complained.  AC ducts were leaking water on the counter from the ceiling (gross). Employees standing against the wall doing nothing with dirty tables, trash, etc all needing to be picked up."}
{"text":"Last night I was invited to a private party at Charr. Joe personally cooked for us. We were seated in a little area good for 25 people.   Service began with white and red wine. I ordered more than one light and refreshing sangria's this evening. Sara makes this sacred sangria with her secret ingredient Grand Marnier. This very berry refreshing drink is a great way to enjoy summer dinners.  Course one is mixed baby greens and cold antipasto platters of prosciutto, souprisatta, spek, housemade mozzarella, provolone ,grilled vegetables, roasted peppers, marinated artichokes with a country mix of earthy, delectable olives.  Course two for me was  Linguine Fra Diavolo with shrimp, clams, mussels, calamari hot pepper bite. Fra Divalo translates as \"Brother Devil\", hinting that this dish is a little spicy but it was mild enough.  Out of respect I wanted to thank Joe for the fabulous meal and the wonderful staff because as Don Corleone once said \"Friendship is everything. Friendship is more than talent. It is more than the government. It is almost the equal of family\". -Mario Puzo."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Charr burger. I first tasted their food at a Multiple Sclerosis Society event called Cooks & Chords. They were offering tastings to support the cause, and I wanted to support them after seeing their efforts. Absolutely loved the crabcake burger with tartar. Truffle fries are amazing, and wow the portions. Enough for dinner and lunch the next day. Service was top notch, very quick. Appetizers are awesome, I particularly liked the fried zucchini. Perfect spot for lunch or dinner when in Moon Valley. Must check out if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Stopped in with the kiddos today for lunch.  The server/bartender had about a 1/2 dozen tables and serviced us all well. Multiple refills and check ins.  The food did take a while, but not too long for a real burger and there was one guy in the kitchen doing everything. I could see straight into the kitchen and saw the guy wash his hands. I appreciate his proper hygiene.  The food was very good and a good value at lunch menu prices. One kid got the battered chicken fingers, she got a nice pile. The other kid plate came with 2 nice sized sliders and fries.  I am not a fan of truffle oil on fries and they get heavy handed with the truffle oil. Nobody else seemed to mind, just my personal taste. The sweet potato fries were good."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for an amazing meal, superb service and an adult milkshake... yes you read that right! I have been enjoying the patio with my dogs for years! Whenever I have friends or family in town we always go to Charr. Occasionally we'll see the roadrunner make an appearance on the patio. Joe, the owner, runs a phenomenal three restaurants! It's obvious the staff are happy, appreciated and love what they do. The truffle fries are to die for and when you're craving a dessert and adult beverage you can kill two birds with one stone. I have recommended Charr to many people over the years and will continue to!"}
{"text":"What happened? I have been here in the past and both the food and service were very good. When we went there tonight the service was terrible and the food has gone downhill also. We were seated quickly when we arrived and we were given drinks and our orders were taken we were never asked again if we wanted another drink and our waitress never came back to our table the manager brought our food no silverware or napkins were at the table we had to wait for them also. This was the worst service I have experienced at any restaurant that I can remember. The food is also not as good they used to have delicious garlic knot kind of buns. now they taste like bag of 8 buns that you get at Fry's for .99 gents. for a 12 dollar burger you will have to forgive me but I expect a little more. this is unfortunate that they have gone so far downhill I used to really like to go here. I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Nicholas my subordinate from work suggested that we should try this place because it looked cool.  So we jump into the car and drove a bazillion miles to get here.   The place definitely looked cool in person and it was well kept and clean.  The loo was pretty decent as well for a burger joint.  The staff were super friendly and helpful because this was our first time eating here.  Service was good speed, and no mistakes were made.   To the food, Nicholas order their signature burger, and we split their mac and cheese... which was absolutely amazing! It's definitely not the best I had, but close enough.. and I highly recommend it.  I also order some wings which was okay, they were really tough to chew.   Overall a good place.  Probably won't come back again since it's so very far."}
{"text":"Way overpriced.  Love the decor and ambiance, but Delux prices don't work without top notch burgers.  And $6 fries is just ridiculous."}
{"text":"Went there because of hearing good reviews of their burgers. Burgers are good but overpriced at about $15. Frys came out half way through meal and not with burger. Also \"caramelized \" onions were just greasy and fried. Staff okay but when expressed concern about above, they became arguementive. In breif, restaurant has potential but needs improvement. Much better places for mid  to high end burgers in Valley."}
{"text":"The husband and I stopped today about 11:30 this morning. You sit at the bar you get the specials. Really?  Server was good but did not refill the diet coke. The burgers are 1/2 pound so we shared. The Phoenix has jalapeños, cheddar, chipotle mayo, red onion, lettuce and tomato. Thin truffle fries, that are wonderful!  We shared and it was plenty and for a nice lunch discount!  The only thing wrong was the well done burger was WAY too done.  Nice if in the area!"}
{"text":"So I went back to Charr after my initial visit to take the boyfriend in. What man doesn't love a burger?! Well he loved it....until he found a hair in the meat. I hope for their sake this was a one-time thing but we haven't been back since.  Bummer because I like supporting local places but it was one hair too many."}
{"text":"Service was slow. Deep fried Zucchini was Costco fresh. Asked to have the outside heater re-started & all we got was a grunt of \"out of fuel.\" Didn't bother to replace it. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"If zero stars was an option... A few comments from my first (and last) visit to your restaurant: My girlfriend and I stopped on 05/12 around 4:20 pm for what we thought was going to be happy hour and dinner. We walked into an empty location, but it was early so no big deal being the only people there. We were seated in the dining room (where I wiped crumbs and food off the booth before I sat down... server didn't notice or care) and I asked the server if they had a happy hour menu. She said \"happy hour specials are only available at the bar and if you sit outside\". Kind of a surprise, but I get the idea. She then asked \"do you want to hear the happy hour specials\" and my response was \"well since we aren't sitting outside what is the point?\" She didn't seem to get the joke, and told us the specials anyway. Those included some deals on draft beer, wine, and food, but then she said there wasn't any tap beer tonight so it would be bottles on special. We looked around at a completely empty dining room and commented that it seemed odd to be so rigid on a happy hour (that ended at 5 according to your site) when there wasn't a single other person inside or outside. We didn't come in for cheap drinks, and we actually joked on the drive over that it was so close to the end of happy hour that we were prepared to pay full price anyway. The whole attitude of the place didn't communicate that we were appreciated as customers, the server and the other 2 staff seemed to be prepping or something else, so we opted to leave. Reading the reviews on various online blogs and the media articles, we expected much better. The food may be great, but the service and ridiculous \"happy hour rules\" will keep me from coming back to find out. I can only imagine what the response would have been if I had ordered something and asked for a substitution. We actually went to another option down the road and were thrilled with the experience. Having been in the hospitality industry in an executive position, I realize that things happen. I am simply writing to tell the owner of my experience, and what my observations were. In a competitive world where there are at least 30 other food options within half a mile of yours, the rigid rules, the poor service added to a dirty restaurant adds up in the customer's buying decision... it certainly did factor in mine tonight. My $50 plus dollars spent at a competitor seemed more appreciated by them than at your place."}
{"text":"The burgers here are some of the best i've ever had! the atmosphere is amazing, yet simply a nice place to relax, unwind, and enjoy a REALLY good burger! :D"}
{"text":"The burgers at this place are fantastic and the truffle fries are thin, crispy and decadent. They have a nice selection of beer on tap and a full bar. Salads are maybe a bit run of the mill. The wings are served with a sweet sticky sauce on them and my preference is a crisp fried wing with light sauce so I typically don't eat wings here. The service is friendly and if you go later in the evening (7:30-onward) it is more lively."}
{"text":"Best skinny little fries.  They serve them in these little wire baskets that look like miniature fryers.  The burgers are good, of course, but salads are pretty good too.  Last visit I had the grilled chicken and was very impressed.  The beer selection is pretty good.  Their wine list is also good."}
{"text":"This place could be way more successful if it was ran with good customer service and fair menu prices, I mean come on now your 12$ Ruben doesn't come with a side . ownership it's to blame for this failing restaurant. My tab for 2 people with a few beers was just under 50$ don't get me wrong the food was good but this place could be waayyy more enjoyable"}
{"text":"I was happy with the atmosphere, calm and collected with ... tv. To see your favorite sport if you like. Also milkshakes for everyone, we enjoyed. Will go back."}
{"text":"I don't get the bad reviews.  They have good, solid burgers, with lots of options and unique ingredients.  Try it, you won't be sorry (unless your standard for a good burger is McDonald's, then go to McDonalds)..."}
{"text":"Burger was great, and filling.  Service was good.  It was a little weird that they didn't have iced tea, but oh well.  I had the a bacon cheeseburger with chipotle mayo and jalepenos.  Delcious."}
{"text":"Stopped by Charr after church for lunch and truly enjoyed the experience.  My wife had their Turkey Burger and I had the Charr Burger made medium-well.  We also had their Truffle Fries.  They tasted great!!!  Our server, Gino, made our visit an excellent experience!!!  We will be back for more."}
{"text":"This is the most wonderful grill in the Phoenix Metro area. You can relax and visit with friends and family over one of the largest selections of burgers anywhere. The service is anazing and the atmosphere top notch. Once you eat there youll always be back for more. Say hi to Madison who will ensure you leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Please explain to me the rationale behind having a happy hour that is limited to the bar or outside patio when there are only three (count them on one hand) three customers in the entire place?  The entire restaurant is small and I could hold the hand of the person sitting at the bar while I sit in the restaurant section,  yet, I am not allowed to benefit from the happy hour menu for my drink. If you want to split hairs over this one, you can do it with someone else.  I will not be spending my money on a place that is petty."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. Service is awesome. Owners care.....beer selections are different and very well .... prices are very reasonable.....it is very clean and has a nice patio. Definitely check it out. Mondays are Burger night......very inexpensive menu for a great food."}
{"text":"Fabulous burgers! Great drinks and a wonderful staff! All 3 keep me coming back for more! Great local spot dead set in north phoenix! Kristin is fantastic at the bar and when the cooks make that 2am burger  Ohhh boy!!!! Joe and Myrah are always so warm and welcoming to every guest that walks through charrs doors!"}
{"text":"We left before our food even showed up. 30 minutes we sat and waited for fried pickles and mozzarella sticks in a restaurant where there was only 1 other table. We walked in the restaurant and it smelled slightly of dirty mop water. 30 minutes of waiting and observing the staff stand around near the serving window/waitress station was enough for us. We left and went to our go-to date night spot. Save yourself the trouble and don't go to Charr. I can see why the restaurant was empty at 530pm on a Saturday."}
{"text":"Nice cool (temp-wise) place for those Summer Hell lunches. Our server was great. LOTS of personality, friendly and took time with us, even with training a new server.  They were both attentive and kept our drinks full. I had the BBQ burger and it was great! Juicy, good toppings and not drenched in sauce. My buddy had the Charr burger ans said it was cooked well and very tasty. Actually heading back in a bit and wanted to let them know they are doing a great job!!"}
{"text":"The wait staff is friendly and bends over backward to make sure you get what you need. They gave my husband a taste of a few beers so he could decide what he wanted. Food was yummy; specifically the truffle fries."}
{"text":"The prices are too high for the area.  Service was lukewarm at the bar - there were some younger folks sitting on the other end and they got more attention. But worst was the slider appetizer we ordered.  All three patties were very tough with grizzle.  We would have said something but no one came back to check on us."}
{"text":"During restaurant week was my first time at Charr, my partner and I decided we wanted to try something new the Blonde waiter by the name of Kenny (I believe) helped us and was literally one of the best customer service interactions I had in a long time he was literally excellent since our first interaction. He greeted us with a warm smile and gave us such good recommendations, although we knew he was trying to up sales us at times with his recommendations we didn't mind because they were good. For the price the food was decent but the customer service we experienced might have us returning."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place for a really, really long time and decided to try it with my husband and son for our anniversary. Went on a hot Monday evening about 6ish to find only two tables (both with seniors) occupied...uh oh. After reading mixed reviews we grumbled on the way in how our dining experience was going to be. Wrong!  Was immediately greeted and seated. Menu is fairly short so it didn't take long. French Onion for me, Crab Cake Sandwich for him, Charr Burger+ American cheese for the 10 year old.  My husband's soda was flat but my son's wasn't. Uh oh. Waitress kindly brought another. Food took a little longer than average due to the fact it wasn't busy.  When the food arrived it was without the fries, which our waitress said was on the way. She was correct, they arrived shortly there after. My soup was smoking and I mean smoking hot. I loved my soup, it was almost perfect. Onions were cut fairly small and it wasn't overloaded with cheese like FOS is sometimes. My husband's crab cake sandwich was damn near picture perfect. Lots of arugula with a small drizzle of the \"tartar sauce\". My son's burger was thick, a little over cooked and accompanied with a fresh tomato slice, onion and butter lettuce. Those fries are amazing and worth the trip! Thin, crispy and salty.  Our drinks were never empty and our server was personable, I think her name was Ashley.  We will definitely be back to Charr we thought the food was great and with just a few minor tweaks it would have been a 5 star experience."}
