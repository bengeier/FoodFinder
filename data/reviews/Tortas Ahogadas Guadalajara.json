{"text":"I recommend the Torta Cubana and their carne asada tacos. Don't go between the hours of 11:36am and 12:10pm since that's when the high school kids go and eat."}
{"text":"I love this place. I am from Guadalajara, Mx and this is the best Mexican food I've had here in AZ. Some of my favorite dishes are the Torta Ahogada, tacos dorados, carne en su jugo... well basically everything! My family and I come here at least twice a week. The staff is super friendly as well."}
{"text":"Ive been searching for Mexican food in America for 15 years now and this was the first most authentic place I have ever found it outside of Mexico, I recommend just about anything here for nothing I have had has questioned its authenticity."}
{"text":"Huevos Rancheros were cold and huevos con chorizo had a strange cinnamon taste.  Very inexpensive but won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I was craving for menudo and no other American style Mexican restaurant had it. 
Of course I yelped it and found this place.
Very friendly staff and very good menudo I was looking for.  I am coming back for the other menu items later.
If you like authentic Mexican, must try this restaurant."}
{"text":"The Carne Asada tortas are excellent...the beans and rice are pretty legit to. Hands down my torta spot though."}
{"text":"I love this place... The people there are very kind and the food is excellent... Real Mexican food"}
{"text":"Brought out empanadas on the house and they were the best I've ever tasted. Great place great prices will be coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic; my family and I have been coming to this restaurant for years and enjoy very much their food.  Don't expect a fancy decor, this is a simple place but the food is terrific."}
{"text":"The food was great and the service was very friendly.  I have only been once, I had the smothered carnitas burrito, the portion sizes are huge!  The red enchilada sauce was good, not as good as si senior's, but still very tasty. The carnitas was really good.  I will definitely be back to try out something else.  Another great find thanks to yelp!"}
{"text":"Deliciously awesome! For the serious spice lovers ask them to make it hot for you and they will bring it on!!!"}
{"text":"Favorite place to eat very authentic mexican food!! Always freshly made never disappointed even when there are long lines while your waiting they bring out a snack for you to eat which is awesome !! Menu is legit and so are the prices I totally recommend this place to anyone that loves mexican food!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices and great service (with a smile!) in a place that I can only describe as stepping through a portal into Mexico.  We tried the tacos (chicken and pastor), classic burrito and cheese quesadilla.  Nothing too exotic (yet!).  Very delicious and well-prepared.  I know what I want for lunch now."}
{"text":"Love this place!! The caldo de polla has such great flavor, the broth is amazing. It's also filled with plenty of vegetables that are cooked to perfection. They serve it with 2 tortillas, corn or flour. Great food and friendly service!! This is a must stop for me when I visit chandler."}
{"text":"If you are traveling Northbound on Arizona Ave, you may miss it becase the sign is obstructed. It looks like a Mexican grocery store from the outside. I had to do a u-turn and go around in order to pull into the parking lot. 
I am a little confused by so many good reviews. Sadly, my experience was less than stellar. Parking was difficult. I had to wait for a spot to open.
When you walk in, there are different little Mexican shops which surround the eating area. The restaurant is in the middle, set up more like a cafeteria. There was only one person in front of us when my friend and I arrived for lunch (on a Monday). Neither of us had been there before. I tried to order an horchata (Mexican rice drink). But was told I had to get it next door. They only have sodas and bottled juices. 
It was busy and not many places to sit left. The table we sat at was still dirty because no one had come by to clean it. We had to wipe it clean ourselves. They took longer than expected. We chatted for a while (10-15 min) before someone came by with our food (2 tortas- that's it).
My friend and I both ordered the torta de carne asada (grilled steak sandwich). It wasn't bad. But, not the best I've had. It was a little greasy. I suddenly wished I had ordered the torta \"Ahogada\" (smothered for you gringos. lol), instead. Maybe I have been spoiled by eating at some of the best authentic Mexican restaurants in Chicago and Mexico. I know I have made better tortas myself before. I just get lazy sometimes and prefer to go out to check some new places. Not sure I will be going back. But, will consider giving them a second chance."}
{"text":"Carne asada was awesome.  I almost ordered the large plate and the person taking my order talked me into the small.  Good thing because I barely finished it!"}
{"text":"Cheap and good, plus ambience.  It feels like being somewhere in Mexico.  I ordered a burrito for less than $5 with tax, which was not only huge, but good quality; filled with nice tasty chunks of chicken you don't have to spit out because of fat or gristle.  The woman who took my order at the counter was very friendly and so was the person who brought it to my table.  This place is so authentic, they naturally assume you are Hispanic and begin talking to you in Spanish.  I liked that."}
{"text":"Very pleased we ate there. If it wasn't for Yelp we never would have gone into the building. The food was outstanding. We enjoyed every bite and the the flavors were rich and delicious. The menu offered many items, although some were unavailable (goat, for instance) were unavailable - perhaps because it was after the dinner rush."}
{"text":"Let's be clear, the \"torta ahogada\" is a typical dish that is not suited for everybody.

It's a pretty hard roll filled with pork meat and soaked in tomato base salsa and then ultra super mega spicy sauce (like 3 days of stomach ache spicy if you're not used to it).

So what people need to do is first think if that's a dish they want to try and second make sure you order your torta ahogada not spicy at all and order the hot salsa on the side.

Squish some limes on top and put red onion to have the real mexican experience. 

Pretty good flavor, serving and price.

All in all, it's almost as good as in Mexico."}
{"text":"Return trip this time for dinner and brought a new tastebud (aka boyfriend).  Ok seriously, amazing friendliness from the cashier girl.. she leaves the register since we were standing a distance away while we decide on the menu and comes up to talk to us...I asked what she suggested but told her I'm decided on the Cubana and bf is up in the air... she had the that's-a-nice-torta-but kind of look and then proceeded to try to describe a crunchy taco and its filling.  It didn't interest bf, so he went with a classic burrito filled w/ pork (pastor).

While we're waiting at a table, the cashier lady (who turns out to be the server and busser later) nonchalantly swings by and drops off in front of each of us a crunchy taco filled with potatoes dressed with red sauce and white crumbled cheese.  With a very surprised thanks, we got to them... OMG, from now on I'm ordering these Taco Durados (only 99cents each!).  Later when we tried to thank her again, she was quietly pleased and told us they come in either beef, bean or potato.  Probably will be my next meal.

Classic burrito w/ pork reminded me of bacos mixed with rice. The Cubano could of been good (salty but forgiveable, it's breaded steak, ham and who knows what else..I better be reasonable), but it was no match for the taco sample.  

Definitely extra star now...we're excited to come again and what kind, friendly service to make us feel comfortable!"}
{"text":"All the food is great. I recommend the Milanesa sandwich. It is like a chicken fried steak sandwich with onions and avocado. Excellent."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food!!!!  In what was once an antique store in downtown Chandler, this authentic little eatery sits in the back corner while the seating area takes up most of the center and outlined by a check cashing place, Mexican candy store, clothing store, beauty salon, cell phone store, and the best 'Antojitos' or Mexican 'Munchies' kiosk/counter serving up a bunch of delicious sweets and snacks."}
{"text":"Not enough good things to say about this place. I'll admit I've lived in Chandler my whole life and had never been here, I will be back. I felt like I didn't pay enough for the food quality and portion size. The combo plate took up half my table and the tortillas took another quarter. The food was absolutely incredible. How have I not known about this place before? Amazing food, great place, chill atmosphere and very little wait time... you better believe I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Had the Barrila and lengua tacos both were delicious. My wife had posole and she loved it as well. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty and authentic food. I got one of the plates and wasn't disappointed with the taste or the portions. The servers were friendly and quick to serve.

Tip: Don't go between 11:30-12:30 because that's when there's a mad rush of students from the high school trying to grab lunch."}
{"text":"As you step through the door, you feel like you've been transported to Mexico. It's a small indoor marketplace with a variety of stores surrounding the seating area for two of the food places, one being Tortas Ahogadas Guadalajara. 

TLDR; Won't be surprised if I'm here every other day. 

Let's get to the best part of the visit, FOOOOOD. 
We ordered 2 tacos (carne asada and al pastor) and 3 burritos (Vallarta and Tapatio). 

The burritos were amazingly huge for the price. Two grown always hungry boys were able to share one full burrito and be full! The tacos were a treat. They serve two corn tortillas filled with just meat, and you can help yourself to condiments and other toppings at the condiment bar. It was different from the other places where they load on the condiments and sprinkle the meat. Al pastor was marinated perfectly and the meat was tender. Even better, they were only $1.35 each at regular price!!! 

Plenty of seating for groups, small and large alike. The girl who took our orders was very knowledgeable of the menu and her recommendations were on point. The staff was very kind :) A slight downside to this eatery is that they close at 8 pm so for those who get out of work late and want some food, it would be difficult."}
{"text":"The best mexican food around! If you are looking for that real authentic taste,this is the place. The best torta i could find in phoenix! I never had a torta ahogadas i wasn't a fan,but everything else is fantastic. The nice lady at the register had us try the empanada which was amazing highly recommend trying."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican as they come in the valley. I've been coming here for the last couple of years when I want to get my fix of authentic."}
{"text":"My whole family loves coming to eat here. Best Mexican food in AZ. We're what you'd call \"Mexican food snobs\" as I grew up with my Nana making homemade Mexican food and my mother in law comes in twice a year from Mexico spoiling us with her food. This place is real authentic food. My go to is the carne en su jugo or the birria. Very tender and flavor meat. My husband loves the chilaquiles and the caldo de pollo and albondigas are very good. You really can't go wrong with whatever you order. My husband is from Mexico and he knows good Mexican food, this is only one of 3 places we will ever eat Mexican food, because we know we will be disappointed. While waiting for your food, take a look at the shops they have. They have a clothing store, an accessory/toy store, barber shop, natural medicine store, and more. My husband can also send money to his family down south and get his meal in one spot. We love it here and the service is great. It also gets very packed so beware, but they do their best to keep up. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"If you want authentic Mexican food (No cheese) and great homemade soup! This is the place!!!"}
{"text":"I now live in Cali, but when I'm in town I always stop here to have two things. Tortas Ahogadas & Tacos de Barbacoa. For those who love hot & spice food . Try la Torta Ahogadas, serve with sourdough bread and carnitas...  I would recommend for those who love hot spices..."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. They brought my party free smothered tacos, awesome. Plus the food is great. It was a little greasy, but eating most Mexican food typically is. they add guacamole to everything. The rest of my party got tortas, they were very flavorful."}
{"text":"So there's this place right across the street from my favorite
Korean restaurant Chodang that looks like some kind of converted
motel or something. Plenty of parking if you keep driving through
the parking lot till you find a space. You walk inside and there's 
a number of Mexican shops inside and lots and lots of seating and 
tables. Feels like you just crossed the border into Mexico. But the 
main star of this show is the taco and torta shop Tortas Ahogadas 
Guadalajara. I love a good torta every now and then - this may not 
be Los Reyes de la Torta but it probably is the closest thing to it 
you'll find in Chandler. I had the torta named after the place - Torta 
Ahogadas. They have some soft drinks in bottles but if you want some 
fresh Mexican fruit drinks or Horchata you just need to get it at the 
place right next to it. Not sure if they take credit cards - I just 
paid with cash. You get the little number stands so they can see where
the order needs to be delivered. My torta was delivered by a lovely 
dreamy tattooed angel - of course, I could've been hallucinating since
I was starving. My torta came in a dish and was soaking in sauce - 
pretty much ate it with fork and knife. After we finished our tortas 
the same sweet woman brought us a complimentary taco cut in two to share. 
It was delicious. Real casual place. I think my dining partner and I were 
the only non Spanish speaking folks in the entire place. ¿Muy Auténtico? 
Si! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican spot. Feels very authentic inside and the employees are so nice. Everything was good and the salsa bar has every topping including the veggies. I'll be back a lot."}
{"text":"Las tortas ahogadas aquí están buenísimas, se le acercan mucho a las originales de Guadalajara! LAS RECOMIENDO"}
{"text":"Where do I begin the ordering line is a disaster the wait is infinite the staff looks hungover or high or BOTH the owner doesn't have a clue and the guest all look suspect but damn their food taste good, oh don't even ask me about getting a refill on a drink lol seriously 15 mins standing in a line to ask for a refil only to be told to have a seat and wait again was my breaking point in fact you couldn't pay me to go back seriously no amount of money and that's saying a lot because who doesn't like money and good food right"}
{"text":"Omg bomb! I got the torta with ham, milanesa, and pork. Also the breakfast burrito. Takes a little bit but beyond worth the wait!"}
{"text":"The restaurant is in a small mercado. I've had tried pastor tacos, torta ahogado, some big burrito they have with everything including shrimp and my favorite, carne en su jugo. I drive 60 miles round trip for the carne en su jugo a few times a year. If you have never tried it it's worth the drive. They did give us a sample of a chicharron torta, this was like a free appetizer. It was very good but I have never had chicharrones that weren't dried.  Overall I would say the food is a 4 star but because I have only found carne en su jugo at this place and it is IMO to die for I must give it a 5."}
{"text":"We have driven by numerous times and finally went in. So good!! Authentic Mexican food with friendly staff!"}
{"text":"Absolute amazing food. I could live here!!!!! I had tacos and they were so good I ordered 10 to go!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! It's Vegetariano burritos are HUGE and full of tasty fixin's. Most of the time that means onions and peppers, but not for this place. Rice, beans, cheese, potato, pico, and guacamole make this tasty burrito one of my local favorites. They have a salsa bar with fresh salsa and tasty add one like cilantro and radish. And, one of my favorite parts, they carry Mexican bottles CocaCola. There is a wide array of patrons and if you happen to speak Spanish you'll be right at home with whatever is playing in the TV(usually soccer. I love watching but never have a clue what they are saying.) if you haven't eaten here, give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Sirven buena comida... los tacos están buenos, la carne que usan es fresca y de buena calidad. Las tortas ahogadas también están buen, lo único que falta es birote salado como en Guadalajara."}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying OMG.... best Tortas and burritos I have had here. The only reason I didn't give it 5 starts was purely for the location. Its located it what looks like an old indoor strip mall, once inside there are places to buy party supplies, medicine, I believe there's even some sort of salon in the corner as well ... but don't let that fool you because straight back is the restaurant with the most amazing food. Their burritos are the big enough to feed the hungriest man or a two people at around $6-$7 each, their carnitas Tortas is my favorite the pork is cooked perfectly and has such great flavor you can even order a fresca in a glass bottle to wash it all down with.. If you are on this side of town its definitely worth stopping by and trying it."}
{"text":"This place is spectacular. There is nothing here that isn't the best I've eaten. And we eat Mexican a lot!  Staff is lovely and genuine. If you like Mexican food this needs to be your go-to place."}
{"text":"Great tortas and burritos.  Tortas served wet with knife and fork.  Tastey meat, good sauce.  Coworker got a chimi, great results.  Aa other got a couple burritos and said best breakfast and bean n cheese burritos ever.

Needless to say will be coming back often.

Watch for the high school lunch hour"}
{"text":"This place reminds me of my grandmas cooking when I go visit her in Mexico. Cheep prices for great food. There is little shops around so you can go shopping around once your done with your meal. Restrooms are kept clean, tables and chairs are always clean. The employees are amazing and sweet to all. This place is the place to go if you want real Mexican food in chandler!!"}
{"text":"The torta cubana was great, the chips and guacamole delicious. Sauces were all very good as well. Very good guac so make the stop."}
{"text":"I went here today with a large group of friends. Their staff are so nice (and mostly speak Spanish!) Its basically inside of a mini-mall that has clothing, salon, jewelry, and phone merchandise. Now, about the food: I ordered a vegetarian burrito (no pico de gallo). The size of this burrito was GIGANTIC! You can easily feed up to 4 people with the size of this burrito. It tasted amazing, but I wasn't a fan of the loads of cheese, bits of potato, and avocado chunks. It costed a little over $7.99, which is fair for the amount of food you get. I know some of my friends got the carne asada fries (fries covered in cheese and meat) and said it was delicious! They also sell juices/ice cream which I did not purchase. Tortas Ahogadas Guadalajara place has real authentic Mexican food which you will love! I would surely come back soon with my friends!"}
{"text":"Generally, I agree with the other reviewers -- this place is pretty good and authentic.  Some things are really good and tasty, but some other things are underseasoned (I wonder why?).  The menudo was hearty, but underseasoned.  The lengua could have been seasoned more and thrown on the grill a bit.  But the tortas and the burrito were very, very good, as were the sauces.  The condiment counter is well stocked with a variety of typical but good things to add to your order.

I will be back."}
{"text":"This place is so good. Authentic food, and the price is really cheap for the quality of food. I love the atmosphere, with the little shops all around. 

PLUS you can get real Mexican sodas here :)"}
{"text":"It not my mom cooking she is from Guadalajara Mexico. But it is a very close second. If you want true Mexican food in Arizona this the place.  I will be back many more times."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for breakfast and neither of us really liked the place. It was nice that there was a salsa bar and the food wasn't bad, but it wasn't really good. The portions were kind of small and the ingredients didn't seem very fresh or flavorful."}
{"text":"Tried a carne asada torta and it was delicious.  Loved the caramelized onions and avocado and beans on it.  Will get without tomato next time.  Big enough to share!"}
{"text":"Outstanding pastor tacos, great carnitas tacos. Only $1.35 for tacos loaded with meat. The salsa bar is awesome, it has pretty much everything you could want on a taco and delicious salsas."}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic, look no further. If you're looking for Tex-mex or Baja style, stay away. Hands down our favorite Mexican restaurant and we're there at least once a week whether it's just to pick up salsa, tacos to go, or to treat ourselves to the enchiladas tapatias (a bit on the heavy side but so delicious it's worth it!)."}
{"text":"The \"Breakfast Torta\" with chorizo was fantastic. Some of the best chorizo I've ever had. The \"Good Morning Breakfast Burrito\" w/ chorizo was not as good. In this item the chorizo was burnt and their were hardly any eggs. 

It was interesting since we got both items at the same time. I only mention the burrito as a point of caution on this item, but the Torta was so good I can't wait to come back and try other items."}
{"text":"Great Tortas!  We had the Al Pastor & Carne Asada Tortas.. We can't wait to come back again... We'll probably pick up a piñata from the little store nextdoor. . ."}
{"text":"This place blew me away on my first visit.  The decor is indicative of authentic Mexico.

I had the Pierna torta, and the pork was amazing.  The toasty bread coupled with the pork and avocado delighted and surprised me while exploding flavor in my mouth!  The reusable glass coke bottles were a nice touch.

Thank you Tortas Ahogada Gudalajara, you are my new favorite place.  

Special gracias goes out to the kid with the mohawk who brought my companion and I some tongue tacos 'gratis'.  I was so full from my mountaineous torta that I left one quarter of the tacos untouched - much to my dismay.

The kitchen and wait staff were friendly and appeared to be familiar with many of the patrons.

One note: the girl running food with the piercings in her lower back - smoking hot.

I will go again, and again, and again."}
{"text":"Really authentic, hot and delicious food. Very long wait even at lunch time. Reasonable prices and portions are huge. We had several meals in leftovers. Very spicy if requested. We will be back but not if we are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food in town! We always order Tortas de pollo con todo and they are AMAZING! Very reasonably priced and extremely friendly & welcoming staff. Very modest decor but that didn't bother me. The food, service & price by far makes up for it."}
{"text":"If you are looking for good food, cheap I would definitely recommend this place. If you don't speak Spanish however, you may not be understood to the fullest extent. But pretty good authentic Mexican tacos, not the best but I would say pretty great overall. Our food took a little longer to come out so as we sat at a table one of the workers brought chips and salsa with cheese on them, even though we ordered to go. So pretty good service, but I would definitely say you get you money worth here."}
{"text":"I saw this place on yelp and I decided to try it. When you arrive it's a bit confusing because the entrance it's kind of hidden so we were a bit lost. We finally found the entrance and walked in. The place looks like a food court. At this point i wasn't to sure of what to expect but Can I say delicious?! I tried the torta de pierna and it was sooo yummy. The avocado and sour cream give it the perfect touch. It was a little soggy but the flavors made up for it. I have been looking for a good Mexican food place and I think I found it. I can't wait to try everything in the menu...I love food"}
{"text":"We had an occasion and were seeking a good restaurant.  Scanning options nearby we spotted this place.  Good ratings here on Yelp.  So we decided to go.

Driving by it is not obvious this place is here.  It looks like  motel from the outside.  Inside there is a shop and this restaurant.  The menu is a large board above the counter.  It's a dive.  But the ratings were really good, and a dive isn't necessarily bad.  So we got in line.

The three of us ordered different things.  I got the signature dish (ahogadas Guadalajara), my wife got the caldo de res (soup), and our guest got a chicken burrito.  Plus a side of rice (me).  My wife says her soup was good.  Our guest says her burrito was good.  I didn't notice any great enthusiasm, but they apparently were content.  My dish is essentially a smothered sandwich.  They take the meat they would normally wrap in a tortilla and put it on a bolillo bread.  I see why there wasn't enthusiasm from my dining partners.  My ahogadas was fine.  Not great, but fine.  The sauce tasted a lot like chili powder.  Reminded me of a sauce I made years ago in college that was basically tomato soup and chili powder.  Really underwhelming.  And the rice was REALLY underwhelming.  Very weak flavor.

I've had authentic Mexican food, both in Mexico and here in Phoenix (I still mourn the loss of La Tolteca to fire).  This really isn't it.  If the other reviewers here like it, that's their prerogative.  But I most definitely don't agree that this is particularly authentic or good.  It's not bad.  If I were in high school I could see coming here to get away from school food (as we noticed:  about 15 minutes after we got there the line got VERY long full of high school kids from Chandler High).  But otherwise, no.  I could come here again, but I wouldn't make a point of it.

Real rating would be 2.5 stars if I had that option."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant hands down, feels and taste just like home ! Always fresh, delicious and extremely satisfying"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but was sadly disappointed.  I ordered a chicken taco and side of rice.  I asked for cheese between the tortillas but the cook was taking s much, he didn't listen to my request.  I had to scrape the chicken out as it was over cooked, dry and chewy.  Store bought tortillas.  The rice was moist but lacked any flavor.  I tried to put done red sauce on it and it made it worse. Red sauce has no kick and tastes like watered down tomato soup,   Hubby on the other hand liked the carnitas burrito but wished there was a decent salsa to add to it."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, if you haven't eaten here you NEED to! The food was fresh, and full of so much flavor. The staff was great and gave an awesome recommendation on what to order. It was clean, easy wait time for a lunch break, and I did not leave hungry! This is definitely some of the best food I've ever had. Be prepared for big portions though. It's a lot of food if you need to get back to work, so try and have self control!"}
{"text":"Had lunch there today and really liked the food. I had the street tacos which were a pretty good value. I had the Tacos Al Pastor, very tasty and affordable. Atmosphere wise it was like being in a Mexico. Probably not a place you would take your girlfriend for a romantic dinner but if you are looking for some good street tacos this is a great place in Chandler."}
{"text":"Second time here wonderful food and great service.  Came at lunch time lots of students from nearby high school but very fast service. Impressed to say the least.  Would recommend this restaurant with 5 stars."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican I've had since in Chandler for work. My coworker had the bean and cheese chimichanga, was topped with avacado, very good! We split an empanada de queso, amazing and only 1.99 and filled an entire plate. I had the torta de pierna... so good with extra limon and salsa verde."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to go in at first in case everyone spoke Spanish, and it is a mall type setting. I'm soooo glad I went in though. Delicious! I'm takin the family back soon."}
{"text":"Enjoy cheap delicious mexican food! Pulled beef plate is delicious. Tacos with goat or Birria with goat = happiness. Enjoy local food at the right price point."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Very simple small place. We would never find this place without yelp's recommendation. Thank you dear Yelp! Chili relleno was so good I considered ordering another one - I wish I had an extra stomach. My husband ordered \"Birria\" -a stew like dish with goat meat sweet fresh onion, cilantro and lime - also delicious . And it is also very inexpensive."}
{"text":"I've already been twice this week.  They have given us free treats both times!!! We're spoiled and in love.
So this is a bit hidden, kinda. It's in a Mexican mini mall...think of it as in the food court...of the world's tiniest \"mall\". 
The staff is friendly, speaks English (I only mention that for those who shy away from authentic places because of language), they will answer any questions, and bring your food out to you.  
They have tacos (1.29), burritos, quesadillas, tortas, and combo plates. All choices of meat. Small salsa bar. Mexican bottle sodas. 
Next to it they have liquados and paletas. 
The food is super yummy and a ridiculously good price."}
{"text":"Stopped in here last night on the recommendation of many Yelp reviewers after running errands. I'm glad others mentioned that it was located inside the Mercado.  The door was locked but someone was exiting so I asked if they were open.  The customer, an apparently very intoxicated man, but most pleasant, greeted me and started talking to me like I was an old friend.  The employee, also most pleasant, said they were closed.  When I asked what time they closed she said eight and it was close to 8:30, so I said I would come back another day.  Next thing I knew, she was letting me in and asking me what I would like to order.  I told her I had wanted to try the goat dish, Birria I think it's called.  So they started preparing it for me (to go).  I looked around while waiting and discovered they also have Thrifty Ice Cream, paletas, various Mexican desserts including strawberries and cream, flan, etc, also Aguas Frescas made with real fruit.  I don't eat a lot of Mexican food in Az because it is plentiful in San Diego, but I WILL be back to this place, only a few blocks from where I'm staying.  

The food was delicious.  But the customer service is even better!"}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets in AZ. It is by far the most authentic Mexican restaurant I've been to in the state. I've been to many parts of Mexico and I felt like I was in Mexico while eating there.  :) I had a  fish taco, shrimp taco and guacamole with chips. All were made fresh after I ordered. Amazing! My husband ordered the Vallarta burrito which was huge.  He could only eat half of it in one sitting. I'd give this place five stars but we waited for our food for over 30 minutes. Be prepared to wait. They definitely are not fast food but definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"I need to say this again, get anything with the Carnitas!  I always try something new....but I must say the Carnitas have the best flavor.  The staff is really, really nice too.  Very Authentic."}
{"text":"Tried this place while in Chandler and it proved to be a wise choice.  I took a shot based on the info from yelp and it was awesome.  This is small restaurant tucked in with a small swap meet if you will.  The food that is being prepared is authentic and delicious.  I had the name sake dish with carnitas.  The portion was large and had great flavor.  I will definitely be back when in Chandler."}
{"text":"Great place to go for when you want some real Guadalajara food. Always delicious and always great customer service"}
{"text":"Well, this is my new favorite place! The food was amazing and the staff was awesome. Fresh Mexican food without tons of grease or smothered (hidden) in cheese. This is exactly what I have been looking for in a Mexican restaurant. I will be back....often!"}
{"text":"Employees are super friendly. However I was looking for more authentic Mexican food. Chili wasn't spicy at all. My boyfriend ordered a red chili dish and it looked liked tomato paste he said it was awful. My food didn't have flavor either. Just over all disappointment. Only thing good was the salsa."}
{"text":"We found this place on the Yelp app and since we don't live anywhere near Chandler, we had no idea what we were in for when we decided to drive down for lunch from Scottsdale.  The restaurant is located inside of an old indoor mall that's not in a good part of town....I'm glad we were here for lunch and not dinner.  Everyone was looking at us like we were from outer space.  We were here for the food, not the ambiance...here's what we ordered:

Carnitas Tacos, $1.25 & Pastor Tacos, $1.25

Mexican Coke

The Tacos were amazing...served Street Taco style, they were simple but very good.  The Pastor Burrito was average....the Pastor was very dry, which is unusual to me....Pastor is generally juicy and full of flavor...this was dry and full of flavor...different and it didn't appeal to me.  The Burrito comes with Beans and Rice inside.

There's a Salsa bar with a handful of choices for you to place in small, plastic cups.

They have Mexican Coke available here...which is my fav and it comes in larger than average bottle (500 ml).  When you're done eating, you leave your empty bottle on your table and they will come pick it up for you....at least that's what I think you're supposed to do.  We looked around and didn't see a place to put empty bottles....we didn't want to throw them in the trash because there's recycling value to them.  During our meal, we watched several other tables leave their bottles on the table when they were finished, so we assumed that was expected.

Overall, the food was OK.  When we left, it didn't leave me wanting more.  I'm not sure I would drive all the way back here again.

{"text":"DON'T LET THE EXTERIOR (OR INTERIOR FOR THAT MATTER) FOOL YOU!!!!!!
Amazing food! Best I have had north of the border. Their Sopes, amazing! tacos great! Service has always been exceptional! The little treat shop next to the main restaurant has the most delicious flan!"}
{"text":"We had a very good experience here. We split the torta al pastor and a side of beans. Good thing, too, because the sandwich was huge! It was delicious. The al pastor was tender, with a smoky flavor that had definite adobada underpinnings. The beans were tasty, with a generous crumble of queso fresco on top. The salsa bar was a nice touch, and the salsa verde had a cilantro zing that really tied the sandwich together.

All in all, this was a great, very satisfying lunch--especially for the price. Recommend!"}
{"text":"The food is made in an actual kitchen that looks like your grandma's.  You cannot complain about the taste, despite how much you should worry about the sanitation of it.  But in a sense, that kinda gives it a real Guadalajara street feel.  They'd get more stars if they paid more attention to little things like wiping down tables after patrons leave and doing more daily sweeps.  It is what is is."}
{"text":"Just great, authentic street tacos and other mexican dishes.  We love this little place and how it is set up in the middle of a small indoor mall.  Not only is the food great, but the service is excellent.  The next best thing to driving down to Rocky Point!"}
{"text":"This place still sucks I can't believe they still stay in business. Can we give him negative stars for service"}
{"text":"Awesome tortas! Loved every bite! My fiancé and I have been struggling to find a good torta spot ever since we returned from our trip to Guadalajara. Everything was cooked to order and tasted very fresh. The staff were also very friendly. Great food, great service. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Fear not my fair skinned friends and come get some authentic and unique Mexican!

Obviously this place isn't winning any awards for ambiance or location but for value and food it's a pretty great lunch option.  Located in the Guadalajara Mercado on Arizona Ave, this is pretty much a spot in a mini food court surrounded by predatory cell phone companies, a western union location, and some clothing stores.  The menu is clearly laid out (in English) and ordering is fast and easy.  

The signature torta is $6 and will leave you full for hours.  You have numerous other tortas and burrito options as well in the $5-$6 range.  The torta ahogada has a great roll stuffed with roasted pork which all swims in a pool of sauce at your desired spice level.  It's good but I think next time I'll sample some of the burritos.  There is a toppings bar to add pickled onions, lime, cilantro, etc.  

If you're over in this area and want a good lunch for a good value then you can find it here."}
{"text":"DELICIOUS tortas. I had the torta de pierna, which was a very generous size and very tasty. It was a bit spicier than I'm used to, but it had avocado and sour cream which helped dim down the spiciness a little. Try it out!"}
{"text":"This place is alright not the best. If your gonna server me give me everything that's supposed to be on my plate. Meat was dry not freshed cooked"}
{"text":"I had Tortas pastor and menudo. The food was very good - bold flavor you can expect in Mexican cuisine. They seemed to have had price increase so it doesn't seem cheaper than going to a restaurant. I would love to try more tortas!"}
{"text":"Love their \"good morning burrito\". Perfectly made and the beans they add, omgoodness! Lol. I'm yet to try their Tortas ahogadas. Love how they have a salsa bar that also includes chopped onion and cilantro to add to some tacos....which I'm yet to try as well. Just love their breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"They were rude to me, food was over priced. Spent $16 on a bowl of soup and two tacos. Not to mention the lady spilt soup all over me and said she would come back with napkins, and never came back. Sat for 30 minutes while she did everything but that. Also they did not even offer me to pay for my dry cleaners. Cost me $4.50 for dry cleaners. Overall, a damn bowl of soup and two tacos cost me $20.50."}
{"text":"This place deserves all five stars! The tacos are some of the cheapest, yet best tacos I have found. They are completely stuffed with meat. The red chili used for my enchilada style burrito tasted very fresh and resembles that of my moms homemade red sauce. I will absolutely be returning."}
{"text":"I had wanted to stop by after reading the reviews and finding out it is 2 minutes away from the hotel i am staying out.

The place is not fancy, but it looks clean and has a nice salsa/condiment bar.  The employees were super friendly and patient with me.  I had the torta ahogada and said yes to very spicy.  I sat down and she surprised me by bringing me some sauce to try and it was quite spicy but fine for me.  Then a lady dropped off a free fried taco like dish which was good and then brought my torta a few minutes later.  And then she came back and brought me some limes and pickled onions.  Anyway, the sandwich was good and i had fun.  Next time i'd try a regular torta.  And the tacos there are very good."}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I have ever had!    This place is authentic and worth the trip!    The atmosphere is like a little Mexico with shops and hard booths, but for that food I would eat anywhere!    Definitely a great place to check out.   I ordered a torta and my boyfriend ordered a burrito.   Both were absolutely fantastic and we had to get boxes because there was so much left over even after we stuffed ourselves!  Check it out!"}
{"text":"This was so good we decided last minute to stop. We had the three hard tacos chicken, beef, & carnitas which had cheese sour cream and I think cabbage. Had so much flavor. We also had a burrito enchilada style. So good and the people working were awesome and nice."}
{"text":"Now that's what I call authentic.   Why drive 5-6 hours south when one step through these doors will make you feel like you just transported down South.  

It's located inside the Mercado, but don't let the outside detract.  This place has all the charm to Mexican Street shops with a fantastic little eatery inside.  The aroma hit my senses like if I was at Nana's house.  

Everything, smelled absolutely delicious and you could tell it was made from scratch.  And it may have been football Sunday everywhere else, but in here is was Futbol Sunday.  All the TVs were set accordingly. Talk about GOOAAAAALLLL!!!

The staff was excellent.  Very eager to answer any questions we had.  Extremely friendly.  

Now for the food.  We ordered a few different items; Birria - this is a go to dish and so freaking good, Lengua (tongue) Tacos - These were very tender and done right.  Simple yet great execution.  That have a salsa/topping bar for all your onion/cilantro needs.  Also ordered a Torta de Pierna - (shredded pork, avocado, and sour cream) this was huge, but again was good. Top it all off with a Mexican Coke.  Food Coma here I come!!!  

Safe to say I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is authentic and great.  Opens at 8am and if you're not Latino you'll be the only one. This is a good thing.

The breakfast burrito (Good Morning Burrito) with bacon, eggs, potatoes and beans is amazing.

The salsa bar is fully stocked with several great salsas and even some guacamole salsa. 

Oh, if you need your taxes done, to buy trinkets, get a massage or many other things, you'll be able to do so inside this small indoor mall."}
{"text":"Seems like most of the locals come here as I noticed many of them already knew what they wanted to order. My friend who used to live in Chandler brought me here. It's basically a small casual Mexican spot inside a mini mall. The menu has a lot of different options so depending on what you're craving they probably will have it.

I ended up going with just 3 carne asada tacos with a side of beans and rice. Simple and basic. They have a salsa bar including different topics you can add to your meal such as cilantro, jalapeño, onions, and radish. I noticed that the cooks were homemaking fresh corn tortillas so I was excited to eat, and you can really taste the difference! Each taco had enough meat enough to make two tacos so that's something to keep in mind. The rice and beans were delicious and the beans came with chips.

My friend got a side of guacamole that came with chips however I wish they included more chips with both beans and guacamole. This is a great spot to visit if you want a really good Mexican fix! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I am so excited to have found this place thanks to Yelp!
One of the greatest pleasures in life is being able to eat a torta ahogada. Its spicy, to the point that your face will feel tingly and you start sweating, yet you can't stop eating it. Filled with delicious pierna (pork leg) and covered in a super spicy but also super delicious sauce all inside a roll that is crusty outside but soft on the inside.
If you are not into self torture, as my kids describe my love for the torta ahogada, they have many other foods that are equally delicious.
Torta de Milanesa, burritos, enchiladas, caldos breakfast and many more things. Don't be discouraged by the appearance of the place. The owners and all the employees are very friendly and kind. Also, skip the chips and salsa and order an empanada as an appetizer."}
{"text":"Excellent dinner for the whole family. Burritos are large and delicious. Tortas are authentic,  not too spicy. Thrifty ice cream cones to top it off. Excellent prices, good service. Great environment."}
{"text":"Seriously the food here is outstanding. This is the best food from Mexico. It all tastes homade. Although I am not from Mexico the flavors are clean fresh and authentic. The beef milzinesa is flavorful and tender its an awesome sandwich!!!! The sopes my wife loved these! The cheese enchiladas are not like all the other Mexican restaurants these are light and fresh and authentic. I live nearby and I think this is the only Mexican restaurant I will go to now. You really need to try it! Don't be intimidated by the location or setting it is a tiny mall and you seat yourself so no need to pay for a tip. Its family owned I believe and the staff is professional and friendly. Sitting here watching CNN and loving everything ever time!! This place is a gem!!!!"}
{"text":"Best Tortas In AZ unbelievable food and great value. Live little Mercado where you can find great western wear shipped direct from Mexico."}
{"text":"The best, most genuine Mexican food I have found in the valley. It really reminds me of actual food my grandma would make and I like that. The meat in the tacos is amazing and even though the ambience is poor it still feels homey. All around definitely a place to check out if you want authentic home style Mexican cuisine!"}
{"text":"Really good food, great condiment bar, and a clean dining area. It's not the fanciest place around, but the food speaks volumes. The menu is reasonably simple and it really has an authentic taste. It's 79 cents extra for handmade tortillas for tacos."}
{"text":"Checked this place out after reading some Yelp reviews.. we ordered the tacos and goat birria.. they were pretty good with their home made tortillas.. they also had the salsa bar with all the extras (onions,cilantro,lime,etc) have a Mexican desserts and drinks shop right next to the restaurant .. saw a sign that said they had mangonedas so I have to check those out next time.."}
{"text":"Great food and super friendly people. Kind of in an odd location, but we'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"So I learned of this spot while doing some volunteering just down the street. One of kids was telling me about these torta sandwiches so I sent him with some cash and told him to bring back 5 to share. 

They came cut in half and blew me away. He showed me the building but I was looking for something from the outside... duh... it's an inside plaza!!! 

So now I'm back and got the Carne Asada torta and tall Coke... like the 1st time it was equally as good... 

The atmosphere and food is about as authentic as you can get and the servers are friendly when it comes to helping make a selection.

They have a salsa bar directly behind you after ordering but I didn't need anything today to compliment my sandwich. Busy/hectic time is during lunch but worth it!"}
{"text":"This is the closest thing to an authentic torta ahogada we have found. Tortas ahogadas are supposed to be extremely hot and this place is doing it right!"}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly and accommodating. The food here is authentic, fresh and tasty. My favorite item is the torta Cubana. The Cubana houses ham, milanesa (breaded beef, el pastor (seasoned pork), refried beans, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, grilled onions. I add jalapeño to mine. The bread is fresh and toasted. You can order by phone for carry out."}
{"text":"Just like a tianguis market in GDL! Amazing food and juices/shakes. Really clean, and good service too. Order at the counter but they bring your food to your table and the servers check up on you. We tried the chilaquiles combo plate which was traditional and perfect, but not too spicy. We also had the taquitos, which are small flautas that come with meat or beans or potatoes. The juices are fresh and delicious. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"This place is legit. I'm asian but I can honestly say I know Mexican food! The food from menudo to tacos is off the chart. And the tortas are made to perfection. The service is A plus. Truly a gem hidden in downtown Chandler. Love the atmosphere. It is busy busy..., all you see are mostly \"locals natives\" but if you can get out of your comfort zone. Then what you find is a hidden treasure."}
{"text":"The best mexican food I have tried in Arizona, finally authentic Mexican food from Mexico not tex mex. Even though they do serve the most common foods found in other Mexican restaurants they also have real traditional dishes like milanesas, tortas like in Mexico, tortas ahogadas, birria, pozole Jalisco style, tacos al pastor in little torillas, authentic tostadas, enchiladas tapatias and the best empanadas/quesadillas around.
I will go back to try their breakfast and perhaps find authentic huevos rancheros........to be continued"}
{"text":"Been only once so far. Will be back. Had an excellent burrito. It was huge. Was my lunch as well as my dinner that night."}
{"text":"Best mexican food and service at a mexican restaurant I've ever had. Good people. Made fresh. Remember you when you come back.  The area is not the Biltmore but it's safe and people are just so nice. Big portions and great value. Can't say enough."}
{"text":"Proper!!!


This is located in a indoor mercado type place. It's pretty geto but it's damn good!!

We ordered a bunch of stuff. The taquito type dish was the best and the burritos were great. Ironically the Torta was our least favorite. We ordered the most popular one."}
{"text":"Round 2, switched it up n got the breakfast burrito.  The orders do still take some time to get ur order,  but it is what it is.. 

Everything was good,  cooked thoroughly,  but man,  beans in a bfast burrito..  just not into beans at all,  and dont lime places that put them in Everything.. 

need to add requesting no beans,  acacado,  n sour cream even if it doesnt say so on menu.. 

the food was good enough to try one more time in few weeks"}
{"text":"Very authentic very fantastic food! Our faves are the tapatio burrito, chimichanga, and al pastor tacos. The same lady helps us each time and she is very attentive and helpful. Eat here and you won't regret it!! We love taking our out of towners here for the authentic experience, great prices too!!

Sometime, they have empanadas on special - cheese ones are very delicious!!"}
{"text":"Hidden in a questionable location but well worth it.  The tortas were delicious and very affordable. The staff was friendly too. Food was ready in a timely manner as well and tasted fresh. 
Open salsa bar with many choices to pick from.
It was a unique experience for dining, I got mine to go during lunch."}
{"text":"This is an interesting place. When you walk inside you definitely feel like you are in Mexico. Food is good, place is usually packed and it's always loud. They are known for their tortas but everything is good. I usually go for the tacos as I like all their meat, it's seasoned well and has an authentic taste."}
{"text":"Given the great reviews this place was really disappointing and just average Mexican fare. 
Had the chilie relleno, mostly chilie no real batter to speak of and the entire plate was cold. My wife had a Chorizo burrito; not sure if the chorizo is beef, pork or both but either way it had a weird texture and did not taste good. 
$30.00 later I can confirm I have had much better Mexican dishes, or in this case I believe they are claiming \"Guadalajaran food\" for much less.
Please excuse any typos on the spelling...
Bummer"}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican! Very friendly & helpful service. Torta de piena was amazing. Had sopas as well which were excellent. Can't wait to return to try other dishes. If you want the best Mexican in the east valley id say you can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"Great caldo de res! And I love their tacos de papa. I have been going to this restaurant for years. There hasn't been anything that I've ordered and ended up not liking. I highly recommend."}
{"text":"Food is really good. I had the taco dorados which were amazing and my husband had tacos of pastor and tripas which he stated were also good....I would come back you would think that there was a restaurant in here."}
{"text":"Very good authentic Mexican food. Very odd shopping market with a very big Mexican influence. Awesome staff great service. Food can be a little pricey but it's very delicious. Nough said!"}
{"text":"I am always on the lookout for dive type Mexican places to try and if not for my fellow Yelpers I may never have found this hidden gem in Chandler! 

If you don't know where it is, it's tucked inside a little Mexican market called Mercado Plaza del Sol on the west side of Az Ave, just north of a tire shop (llantera). 

When you walk in, you'll notice a clothing shop, a toy store, piñata store, hair salon, cell phone store, an ice cream shop, and then the restaurant/cafeteria is right in the middle. 

Since discovering this place a little over a year ago, I have probably eaten here at least 10 times. Being the taco junkie that I am I usually just get a variety of tacos (try the Super Taco) and everything is fresh, tasty, and authentic. They have the traditional salsa bar so you can add the garnish of your choice. Bonus points for the fact that they have Mountain Dew as any day I get the pleasure of eating Mexican food and chasing it down with Mt Dew is a great day in my book.

On my most recent visit, I tried the tapas chimichanga with carne asada, potatoes, guacamole, cheese, pico de gallo, etc. and it was phenomenal! I definitely need to add this to my rotation. I've also had the tortas ahoghadas (Mexican sandwich) which was really good, but it fell apart pretty quickly and had to be consumed with a fork the rest of the way. 

The portions here are pretty big (Tortas, chimi's, burritos, etc.) with the exception of the street tacos. 

If you amor authentic and tasty dive Mexican food, you've got to try this place!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food I've had in Arizona.  As a California native we have plenty good Mexican food to choose from. And this spot reminds me of los Angeles Mexican food."}
{"text":"Nothing but wonderful, delicious Mexican food here -- along with a great and friendly staff. Run, don't walk...
We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Now that I work in Chandler and have an hour lunch I have time to explore all the great Mexican joints on az Ave..... I'm definitely excited to try this spot again until I've had most of the menu... It seems like a local favorite for people looking for authentic Mexican favorites. It's set in the middle of a indoor shopping area. You'll see high school kids local laborers and other local shoppers. The tortas (Mexican sandwiches) are 6-7 and they have a handful of other Mexican staples but still accommodating the whitewashed options you find at Philly b' s. I had the barbacoa torta and saw plenty of other tortas I want to try. A handful of the plates could easily be shared and even though you order at register someone will deliver food to your table. There is an ice cream stand that shares space but common Mexican drinks can be found at the eatery"}
{"text":"Authentic Tortas and tacos. Fresh tortillas. Salsa and lime bar. Tell me what's wrong here? Nothing."}
{"text":"Best authentic Mexican food in Arizona.  I have nothing bad to say about this place. Great food. Great service. Fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Thought I'd give this place a try after reading all the great review, and I was pleasantly surprised. Is in a typical Mexican mall. But the Milenesa Torta is so good!! The restaurant was nice & clean and not hot like some small restaurants are. The staff was friendly and the salsa's were also great. Highly recommend and will forsure return!!!"}
{"text":"All I can say is wow.

 My family is from the Jalisco area, this food reminds me of the dishes my Tia would cook me as a kid. 

Have been here several times, yet to be disappointed. 
Definitely going to try more of the menu options.

 I would recommend trying the Torta Ahogada and tacos dorados! Torta de asada also extremely good!"}
{"text":"Authentic, amazing and real Mexican food. Having been to a few places in South America and to other Latin based countries the food has a real flare for authenticity. Down to the small visible tortilla maker, where fresh tortillas are made. 

Clean bathroom on the men's side, cold condiment bar and the staff taking care of sweeping the floors continuously with pleasant smiles and a willingness to serve. 

Tapatio burrito and their pastor meat is awesome!!"}
{"text":"This Place was exactly what I needed today. Delicious Mexican Soul Food and service with a smile. Just be prepared to wait in line............ it is worth the wait."}
{"text":"First time here. Really liked it. I got the torta ahogada. I think the bread was a little too toasted hard. That's why not five starts. But it was awesome. If you live in Phoenix metro, you've got to try one of these.

My wife had the carne asada tacos. Wow, the meat was so tender, the rice was truly authentic, and the beans had great flavor.

I highly recommend this place."}
