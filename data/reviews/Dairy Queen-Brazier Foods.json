{"text":"Been many times, super friendly owner and staff, last time we accidentally stayed 30 minutes past closing and only realized when they unlocked the door to let us out apologized and were told with a smile not a problem thanks for coming.  Helpful tip: the poutine is vegetarian and is delicious. We get ice cream cakes from here a couple times a year and are always a big hit. A+ service A+ hot food and ice cream cakes."}
{"text":"It's summer time and it's nice to have a place to get a cold and sweet treats. But now they also offer some fast foods like burgers etc. Nice staffs too."}
{"text":"There was no soap in the men's room. That's not an issue on its own, but when I mentioned it to staff, they knew about it already, didn't seem concerned about replacing it, and actually seemed annoyed that I said something. The wait was extremely long for food and  the staff were audibly and heatedly arguing the entire time. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Worst visit ever. Because of their customer service, I'll never be seen in a Dairy Queen during my lifetime. If there's Dairy Queen in death, I won't go there either. Went to order a frozen cake for Tuesday (child's bday) had 1 owner hovering over me like I was about to rob them, I finally had to tell him to go away from us so we could discuss what cake he wanted. We go up to the counter and tell her we want a PLAIN vanilla ice cream cake, no borders, no icing, no decoration, no writing, not anything. Plain, as in put a pile of vanilla ice cream on the board, shape it like a round 8\" cake, stick in a box for us to pick up on Tuesday at 3. Probably the easiest, and by far the most profitable cake they have ever had ordered. For some reason she decided to grill us on how we wanted the cake. Do you want a border? No. Do you want writing? No. Do you want decoration? No. Do you want this, do you want that... How many times does a customer have to say \"no\" before they clue in. We just wanted a simple plain ice cream cake. How difficult is that? I finally asked her if she thought we were stupid? Apparently she took that to mean she was stupid (thinking now, yes she is stupid), she easily asked us 15-20 different variations to the same bloody question. When we say plain with nothing on it, just the ice cream, I'm not sure how I'm making that difficult for her to understand. So now that she has decided I've called her stupid (I DARE those idiots to watch and listen to their own cctv), they will quickly see I never made any such remarks (I'm sure they'll deny it though), she then gets bent out of shape and tells me that that she has the right to refuse service to anyone, says she's not serving me and pretty much hustles to some back area of the store. Dingleberry 3 now gets into it. After her giving me such an impossible time to just order a simple cake, I asked for a copy of the order form. I was told they don't do that, I point out to her that since she can't understand we want a simple cake, I want proof of what I ordered so that when I show up, and they try and pass off something else I can prove they've screwed it up, and it's not my fault. For some strange reason this doorknob (apparently another owner) wants to start an argument over the fact that he can't make a photocopy, that he has to scan it then print the picture out. WTF does that have anything to do with anything? All I want is a friggin copy of the order because I know they'll screw it up, then try to blame me for it. Why stick your nose in, to only stir the pot more and keep the argument going? Just go make a copy. It's not rocket science people. Somehow I'm now \"harassing\" (their words) them. I've no clue how they came to that conclusion. I am FINALLY given permission to pay for the damn cake ($30), and I ask the guy his name, he says it, and I repeat it back to him, and ask him to write it down because I'm going to mess it up if I try. He now accuses me of saying that his name is \"messed up\" (hey dingleberry, watch AND listen to your own security cameras, you'll see again), I made no disparaging remarks about you or your name. In fact listen closely, and you'll hear me admit that \"I'm stupid with names\" and once again repeat myself saying that \"I would mess it up, that's why I asked you to spell it for me because I'm horrible with names\", nope. So, if they ever see this, they'll deny everything, tell you what a bitch I was to them, and how they had to endure my abuse. Ask yourself this question: Is it more likely I drove to another town (25 mins 1 way) way over paid for a blob of vanilla ice cream in a cardboard box, that has to be ordered AND paid in advance, then picked a fight with these people, so they could secretly spit in my child's bday cake when making it, or is it more likely they treated us poorly then stood together backing each other up? They have a reputation to try and keep shiny. Me? I get nothing. I asked my friend to go back to the store, get my $30 refunded, cancel the cake. I'll never give another penny to DQ. And I'm sure they're just fine with me not being a customer anymore. I know the few (maybe $25) dollars I spend per year in their stores is never ever even going to register any millionth of a minuscule of a blip on their profits. That's ok with me though."}
{"text":"Came here on my way to the cottage from Toronto. The staff and the owner were both on site and they are very friendly. I believe it is one of the few ice cream shops around that you get the creamiest milkshake and blizzards."}
{"text":"This location can get annoyingly busy during the summer months. I really enjoy the caramel apple tart (can't recall the exact name) which comes with vanilla soft serve. The staff are nice and seem to keep the place clean. Would definitely recommend and continue to visit"}
{"text":"This DQ takes forever for service, especially through the drive thru. Staff doesn't seem to be interested in getting the orders correct or working efficiently. Understaffed in the summer doesn't help."}
