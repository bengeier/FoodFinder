{"text":"Good pub, pretty random & eceletic vibe.  Was expecting mostly undergrads, but had a varied age group. Tried the nachos...nothing amazing...
Until after 11 when the lower level turned into a dance floor. Great dancing music ! New and old...top 40s included. 
Pretty cool vibe throughout the place...bunch of pubs connected together, each with their own unique music \"theme\". There was one room with a piano player taking requests too."}
{"text":"I don't want to give this place too bad a rating since it's really not THAT bad. I think it really depends on what you're going for. 

I went for a friend's birthday a little while ago and arrived early with my +1. We took a seat and saw the menus but found out our friend would be late so we left and came back. Both times the bouncers were nice to us, so that wasn't a problem. When we got back, the place was getting a bit busy and was obviously understaffed (there was only one server in our area with two other guys running around delivering food). This was a Friday, mind you, so this didn't make much sense to me. The server was really nice but understandably slow because she had so many tables to wait on. 

I ordered the chicken fingers and fries while my friend got fries and apple pie. This is where things got weird. We never got cutlery with our orders and had to wait for them to come back around to get some. Again, because of the wait times this took 5-10 minutes each time. Also, the chicken was wrapped in fish batter...you know when you get fish & chips? THAT batter. In my opinion it really wasn't good and if my friend didn't have an iron stomach, that food would have been thrown out. Her food wasn't much better and while she ate it, she wasn't too happy with it.

I get that it's a pub and you go more for the drinks and entertainment but the food was really bad for the price. My bill was eleven bucks while my friends was around the fifteen mark. A little pricey for the quality if you ask me. 

The other floors are beautiful though, and on a nice summer night I can imagine it being a fun time. However it can get really crowded and a little hot but again, it was a Friday so no surprise there. 

Not sure if I would go back, but it was definitely an experience!"}
{"text":"After looking at the other reviews I can definitely agree that the service is terrible. We all must have had the same waitress. We sat up on the outdoor patio,it was a gorgeous day. Our waitress was prompt but didn't come back for 20 minutes with our drinks. Our order took even longer, it was only nachos. Yes we did get attitude from the waitress when she forgot part of our order. 

All in all it was a gorgeous sunny day and great to be outside. To avoid the poor service, order from the bar directly, it's much faster."}
{"text":"Ugh, if you're over the age of 22 just do yourself a favour and walk on by.

If however, you're a young Uni student or wishing to relive your days as a frosh than you'll probably have a good time.  It's loud, full of rowdy youth and has a decent brew selection and a few nice patios.

This place is always packed despite its enormity.  To my surprise there also always seems to be a big line-up out front, although I can't for the life of me understand why anyone would line up to get into this place.  

Although, to be fair, I am writing this as someone that is a decade too old to enjoy a place like the Maddy.  I would happily avoid it but occasionally a friend who has gone back to school at a more advanced age is taken in by the reputation of the pub as a college hot spot.  They then proceed to organize a birthday party, inviting all of their 30+ year old friends to join them in this cavern of obnoxious drunkenness.  We all wonder why they have invited us there and bitch amongst ourselves about spending a night with the frat kids.  Of course none of this is conveyed to the oblivious friend who planned the ordeal.  In the interest of friendship we begrudgingly attend and try to yell out a conversation over the noisy backdrop, all the while feeling a little bit of pity for the friend that just hasn't caught on to age-appropriate hang-outs.  

Don't let this be you.  If you're an adult with a social circle above the age range of 18-22, invite your friends to join you somewhere else."}
{"text":"This is an awesome pub with a great atmosphere and so many levels that is doesn't matter what you like, you will find it here. Cheap food and drinks, half price food after 11:30, live music, a dance floor, pub area, pool game area and general communal spaces. There are soany levels to keep it interesting it is like a labyrinth. Service is a bit slow but given the crowds not surprising. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"It is great for young students, but not so good if you are above 30 years old! I went there with a friend (we are both above 30), so we didn't feel connected with people there much. Although I went there with a guy friend, a couple of guys came to me and asked me out just when they saw he was not around me! So, I had to tell them that he was my boyfriend! So weird, but I thought maybe this is cool when you are at school! So, when I saw other people's comments about there more looking like a frat house than a pub, I do agree! 
The piano bar was so much fun though. I really enjoyed it. Specially when they played Bohemian Rhapsody!"}
{"text":"I was a regular here in my UofT undergrad days a decade ago when everyone still smoked indoors.  Now I am living in the neighbourhood again, this time as a full-time working member of society.

Totally agree with the other comments on the amount of underage females who seem to have no self-respect.  Their frat boy friends are equally annoying and way too young looking, but what actually disturbs me are the older gentlemen at the bars...

I still go when a group of us are looking for a reliable place that's a short walk away, but I have moved on to become a regular at other places where my older kin-folk show up in greater numbers."}
{"text":"Fantastic place. Been frequenting the Maddie for a few years now, and it's the *variety* which always grabs me: a dance floor, pool tables, rooftop patios, a piano bar. Hold hands with strangers at 128 BPM. Sing along with new friends, gathered around live music. Get destroyed by semi-professional pool players.

Be aware that it's often crowded past midnight, and that it might take a while for your drink to get served. I've never actually had any issues with service (as some people have complained), I really think it's just too busy sometimes and I don't blame them. However, I find the claustrophobia and cacophony part of the experience -- one that I've grown fond of, actually. 

Overall, this is an incredible establishment. I can't speak for everyone, but it's one that's truly enriched my life."}
{"text":"AVOID avoid avoid. You will be treated like crap from the moment you step in line, which stop and think, why is there a lineup to a pub?! Who lines up to subject themselves to this terrible pub? This place is douchebag central from the power-tripping bouncers to the rowdy 19-year-old patrons who don't know any better.  The last time I was there one of the bouncers told my friend to pull down her skirt. Grossly inappropriate. Will never go back."}
{"text":"The Maddie or Madison is getting mad props, but I wanna throw in my two cents here.

If you have never been to a bar in your life, you're from a small town, or it's your first time having a drink in your first year of University, the Madison is a good intro. I went to Queens University for one year, and I would have loved to have a big old bar like this there.

BUT, if you are a seasoned bar goer, like service, micro-brewed beer, good conversation, or you're over the age of 22, the Madison is a terrible option. It's like one giant frosh week keg stand of a night. If you have this in mind when you go, you can always make the best of it. The drink prices are decent, the service is bearable, but if you're looking for anything other than a house-party vibe, you will not find it here.

And, I'm not gonna lie, the carpet kinda stinks.

It's not that I hate the joint, I'd just hate to send anyone there without telling them exactly what they're in for."}

{"text":"First patio day of the \"spring\".. even though I'm sure given Toronto weather it's bound to become winter weather once again. Anyways, given the gorgeous weather I decided to spend the day on the patio at \"the Maddy!!\"

I give this bar 3 stars (which, I think, might be generous given the service and quality of food or drink... but I've always seemed to have FUN when I go here). I've only been to the Maddy when it's bumpin' on a Thurs-Sat night once or twice. It's fun, it's huge, it's packed...but it's not really my style. I prefer the more laid back sunny afternoon pints on the back patio. 

They have an amazing back patio (That fills up fast because it's right in the afternoon sun). This is usually filled with frat boys and bros, but also many people looking for the pub atmosphere. 

I recently found out yesterday that during the day the prices are cheaper than at night. For instance, my bartender admitted that the prices for pints go up at night (which I can believe, I got a pint of Rickards White, a more premium beer, for $5.50). Also another plus for during the day is the half price appetizers! Order a few between you and your friends and you'll be munching for less. It's really a good deal -- My sister bought the first round of 2 rickard's white and an order of sweet potato fries and it ended up coming to around $13.

CONS
We didn't get served on the patio. We got there, found a seat, waited... waited... waited...20 minutes in we figured, HELL let's serve ourselves and just ordered from the bar inside. Not a big inconvenience at all, but still disappointing about the horrible service. To be fair, the waitress was running around like mad because perhaps they didnt anticipate the weather being nice but... comon... theweathernetwork.com guys!

Another bad thing is just that the prices go up at night and it just gets packed, I've seen long line ups on many occasions. but if frat style parties and chugging is your thing, then the maddy is for you. there is also a piano bar sometimes open in the basement, and pool tables. there are more bars and floors than I can count. can't wait to hang here in the summer!"}
{"text":"Wow, the service at Madison blows big time. Sitting for 10 mins and no one's come to serve and the patio is half empty. It's the same hole it's always been, but now with nonexistent service. The patio is alright, but I am by no means tempted to come back here."}
{"text":"So; I don't usually making a practice of leaving bad reviews. I've worked in the service industry as a cook for years, and it is a JUNGLE out there; sometimes mistakes are unavoidable, and everybody has a bad day.

But - I have never received worse service in my life than last night at the Maddy. We were a table of six, being helped by a new server (which she stated, and I would normally be pretty understanding about). We initially asked for separate bills right off the bat (for the record - this comes into play later) and when placing our orders mentioned she wasn't writing anything down - which, could potentially be confusing. She insisted she didn't have to and not to worry...

We received an extra basket of fries we didn't order, which she told us to just keep (but, we asked not to have put in the bill - pretty standard) and I ordered a plate of their \"all day\" 1/2 off wings that arrived with the wrong sauce initially, which she promptly fixed. Cool - not so bad. Food was totally acceptable pub grub - nothing sensational, but pretty good.

When it came time for the remaining 5 members of our group to settle up, we initially received one cheque, not separate cheques as requested. Our server reprinted them - repeatedly - up to three more times for myself and a friends order (which, were NOT complicated, I swear - no weird substitutions, less than five items on my bill in total). She was kind enough to honour their wing special price as advertised, only after I pointed out I had been charged full price, even though it is advertised as an all-day special, and I had SPECIFICALLY asked her when I placed my order if they were 1/2 price (to which she replied yes). 

It took an hour for us to get settled, without exaggeration - and, one person never even received their bill at that point. When I received my last printed cheque there were still items I had not ordered on the bill, even after repeatedly pointing out what I had ordered verbally, and writing it down physically. Also - we were charged a gratuity, that was incorporated into the bill - for a table of SIX people?? Especially after all of the multiple mistakes and poor service, I was not pleased at all to find that they had extravagantly added on a gratuity, without our knowledge. In such poor taste. 

I don't know if the Maddy has a policy about how you have to take orders, or if you're not allowed to write things down - or, if this person was the only person was on staff this particular evening and was being stretched beyond their means; there could very well have been circumstances that dictated why we received such terrible service, but if so they're unbeknownst to me. This seems like it would be a really unsupportive and awful place to work, as at no point did another server or FOH manage come over to give this person a hand or help with the confusion. 

Left with a terrible taste in my mouth and a headache this morning from their draft (they most definitely do not clean their equipment properly or regularly - stick to bottles or cans) - neither myself or my friends will ever set foot in this bar again. Don't bother; it is NOT worth the trouble."}

5 stars = Must visit!
4 stars = Really good. I take my friends here.

2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary.
1 star = Do not visit!


I think the Madison was designed by someone who tried to recreate whatever vision emerged in my brain from watching American movies about college guys going to bars. It's a big house, and there are taps, and lots of dudes drinking beer.

Do you really need to read a review about the Madison? Even if you haven't been inside, you know what it looks like. It's full of men drinking beer. The women there have either been dragged there by their man, or are there to meet men (if they're into 20 year olds taking Poli Sci and Philosophy), or are there for some groovy U of T birthday party.

I can't merely call it a frat pub, because the decor is a slight step up. That is to say: it's clean, and you can take your study group here to celebrate after finals.
This is the kind of pub that is very popular for people who first move into the area, probably because they're going to U of T.

2 stars"}
{"text":"Great place for a casual bite and beer with friends! Mind, service does gets slow when it's busy. I.e. always:)"}
{"text":"The main thing that the Mad has going for it is its hugeness.  Especially its huge amounts of patio seating.  With the labyrinthine rooms and stairways, including one notable stairway to nowhere, I can't help but be reminded of the Winchester Mystery House (google it if you're unfamiliar, it's a crazy interesting story).  Its as though this particular pub/bed and breakfast was given the power of self-replication.

The menu is nearly identical to the Madison's sister pub down the street, Paupers (which I've also reviewed).  There is, however, some intangible element which makes me prefer Paupers.  You might say that the Madison is the slightly eccentric Victorian sister to Paupers younger, brasher self.  And while the menu items are uncannily familiar, I would say that in terms of service and quality, the food is definitely second fiddle to the Madison's bar service.

I've mostly gone to the Madison for work-related birthday lunches and as such have never experienced the hopping nightlife of the Madison, which I'm told is a horse of another color altogether.  Its proximity to the University frat houses more than likely has a lot to do with this reputation.  Still, I can only suggest such a seedy underbelly, as I've only been in the place on quiet afternoons, dazedly wandering through its endless rooms of brass railings and carpeted stairs.

If you like the sound of the Paupers/Madison menus, go to Paupers.  If you're looking for a college bar experience, head over at beer o'clock and report back your findings.  And whatever you do, don't get lost in the Madison, because you'll be damned to wandering the halls forevermore...."}
{"text":"I'm giving it two stars instead of one because the times I've been to the Madison just for a few simple beers, it's been OK. But when I've gone for an actual meal and relied on the servers, it's been horrible. 

One time I went with my roommates from Graduate House and we sat at a table on the top floor for a good 20 minutes - no server. So then I went to actually find a waitress and let her know we're waiting. When she finally came around to our table, she gave me attitude for not being more patient. How long are people expected to wait here before getting served, exactly? I'm sorry but even at a place like the Madison, any longer than 20 minutes is just unacceptable.

Moral of the story: don't go here for anything that requires much service. If you're just going for a few simple drinks, it's an OK place."}
{"text":"This place is filthy, in a good way!  It's crowded, it's gross, and I LOVE IT!  People drink super heavy here, and the dance floor on the second top floor is always packed (but really dark lol).  If you are visiting Toronto, you gotta gran a beer here!"}

{"text":"One Friday night I took a buddy to the Madison for a roll. After the line up thinned out and all the fake id's made it thru, we headed for the basement. Of course we quickly made our way to the top heated patio. I forgot how CASA LOMA huge this place is..... like 4 houses wide and 4 levels high. The Mad's  holds approx. 1500 patrons. There are plenty of red coloured booths and always a drink shelf just when you need to put down your drink if you are standing. There was a guitarist in the basement and a band on the 2nd floor. I spent most of my time at the horseshoe shaped bar on the 2nd or 3rd floor that had the best guitarist I have heard/ seen in awhile.  At 11:30 pm the place was wall to wall with 20-somethings.  Great place to go if you are under aged (5 stars), not so great if you are over aged (1 star). Although it's not my scene, 20 somethings would do well here."}
{"text":"What a disappointment!! It looks like nobody is managing this place... On Sunday evening it was at 25% capacity while other bars down the street where packed. Should have been our first clue...
There is absolutely NO service. We waited for 30 min just to be acknowledged. Eventually ran out of patience, came up to the bar and asked a bimbo with IQs of a cannoli to send someone over when she gets a minute. She couldn't be bothered. She was too upset that remote control for a TV wasn't working... WTF!
After 30 min we left, along with few other people who couldn't get waitresses attention. Makes you wonder, if waiting staff is that incompetent, what could be going on in the kitchen???"}
{"text":"Checked out this local historical bar last night. Liked the outdoor patios and atmosphere. The crowd was not rowdy in the section we were in, despite the fact that the finals for hockey were on, and the area was about half packed (on a wed. night).
Food was decent...I tried the 'lumberjack' burger which had chicken breast and bacon and came with a side of fries for 9.99. It was the usual pub fare.
Overall, I'd return here on a weekday but would probably opt to stay away on friday and saturday."}
{"text":"I've been to the Maddy around a dozen times, but am writing this review based on an issue I had yesterday. Prior to yesterday I found this bar to be quite pleasant, with an eclectic mix of atmospheres and an exceptionally talented pianist.

Yesterday I ordered a dish that was listed on the menu as being $7 (with a 50% discount because it was after midnight). After eating, the waitress brought me a bill that was higher than it should have been. I pointed this out to her and she said that the price of the dish had gone up to $9 (still with the 50% discount), but the menu that was brought to us didn't reflect this yet. I asked to pay the amount listed on the menu that I had ordered off of, and she said that there was \"nothing I can do\". Upon speaking to her manager, he told me the same thing and that it was \"only a dollar\".

I eventually found Chris H. the owner (I believe), and politely explained to him what happened. He told me that the prices were reasonable. I told him that I agree that the food was reasonably priced (even at the new price), but that's not what the menu listed. I simply wanted to pay the price listed on the menu. Even if they had warned me about the price change before I had eaten, that would have been fine, but they didn't. After we spoke he gave me $1 to make up for the difference in price, but then immediately grabbed me, physically dragged me to the front, and kicked me out (without refunding me the $5 cover). I suppose that he just wanted the last laugh in that interaction, even if he had to act in an immature and incredibly classless manner to insure it.

To clear up any potential misunderstandings about why I was kicked out, it was only because I annoyed him by asking to pay the correct price. I didn't refuse to pay, I wasn't being rude, belligerent, insulting, or loud, I didn't touch anyone, I didn't refuse to leave when asked, and I'm not misremembering the situation because of alcohol; I don't drink alcohol (at all, ever) and hadn't had any that night.

The following section was not a part of my original review and is in response to Chris H's comment on my original post. 
You are either mistaken about what happened or simply trying to discredit me, regardless of which it is, I'll try to straighten it out.

First off, as noted in my original post, I don't drink alcohol at all, and under no circumstances would I ask for a drink let alone demand one. That simply didn't happen. I did speak with a bartender but I only asked her to find a manager I could discuss the situation with. 

I was given $1 (slightly less than I overpaid by) seconds before being kicked out and nothing prior to that. To repeat, the server didn't refund me any amount; if she had, the issue would have been resolved right then and there. 

I suppose the term \"dragged\" was a bit ambiguous. The manager grabbed my arm while asking me to leave and continued holding it for a prolonged period of time. This wasn't necessarily violent, but was still inappropriate."}

First of all, it's just confusing. Unless I'm in a cornfield maze or lazar tag, I don't need to clutch my friends in fear I'll lose them at every turn. The rooms all look quite similar. There might be one in the mix where people are dancing but it's not that kind of place. It's all outdated. 

The drinks are drinks. Nothing special, nothing I can really tell you or recommend. We sat at one of those big, long, glossed up picnic tables. That part was fun- how you can sit in a large group, seeing and talking to everyone. Also noted, there are little hooks for your coat as you take a seat. 

It's not that it's BAD, per se. It's just that it's not good. In all the Toronto establishments, why does this one have such a heavy following that keeps coming back for years?"}

Service: our server was rude, he was constantly nagging me to buy alcohol when all I wanted was to drink water and told me I was too high maintenance when I asked for a lemon with my water. He then brought the water and took ten extra minutes to bring me the lemon cause he forgot, which is honestly fine. I ordered an appetizer that took over 20 minutes to arrive, which again is fine to me. I understand things take time. When I went to pay my bill I was told it was an automatic 15% tip charged because I came with a reservation. And last but not least. I am outside in the smokers ally with some friends, mind you I do not smoke anything. People I am associating with spark a blunt and I get kicked out for association. I am allergic to weed. I get a fever, I rash up, I get sick, etc. I explained to the security guards who essentially grabbed me and threw me out that I was not smoking and that I do not smoke and I have an allergy. There responses we're all rude and ignorant. I was unable to go back in and pay my bill leaving my friend to have to pay it. I was unable to go back in and grab my things.

{"text":"I have been coming to the Maddy since I was 19 years old. I went when I was in college, and I continue to go well after those years! The truth is, the pub has a place for you no matter what your age group.

The youngun's who are JUST legal, the old timers who I am sure have been going for much longer then I can say, and everyone in between.  There are always interesting people, and good times.

The patio is by far the best feature of this bar. It is MASSIVE, and as Canadian's we love to get out there as soon as we see double digit temperatures. The Maddy is always ready for those times (well mostly)!

Other features, the piano man on the main floor bar, south side. I believe he plays on Thursdays, but I am sure I have been there on a weekend when he was as well! He takes requests, and the room is a massive sing-a-long. The jukebox on the second floor, north bar.  There is a pool table, and you can put change into the jukebox and pick the music for the night. Another feature, is the 3rd floor patio which I have only seen open on weekends in the summer.  It is small, but fun! 

The downfall of the bar is, on weekends the line up. But this is similar to what you would see in the entertainment district downtown on any Saturday night.  The drinks are somewhat expensive at night, and the whole bar does not do pitchers (only Madigan's - the basement sports pub), which is daunting, trying to get to the bartender pint after pint, due to the amount of people that crowd it. If you are a small girl like me, it could prove difficult. Also, the guys are just bros, and not particularly the gentlemanly type (for the most part), and therefore, HARDER to get to the bartender! Haha!

I have been to the patio recently during the day and not been noticed for a long period of time.  But I am also not one to summon the waiters either (I always thought the hand wave was rude!).

Every so often you have to serve yourself, because it is busy on the patio.  But it is a busy spot, and lots of fun, so most times forgiven!

Overall, great vibe, good diverse crowd, not AMAZING food, but it fills you! And lots of Beer which is always great!

I love this place because it kind of holds a place in my heart! I will never stop going!"}

{"text":"I don't like this place. I tried to get into it. I tried to like it, I really did. I just couldn't do it.

Lets talk about the decor. What decor. How do I even explain this. It's a big old house, with many rooms. Each room is decorated differently, with it's own bar. It's thrown together feeling, and ramshackle. It just felt really cheap and tacky, I really couldn't get into it.

I didn't eat at this place. I wasn't brave enough. Instead my friends and I enjoyed some drinks. The bartender wasn't surrounded by that many people, maybe 12. He was really inattentive and slow. I understand he was solo, but it's not like he was swamped. 

While I was at the Madison, I forgot what women look like. Never have I seen a place filled with so many guys. Upon leaving I saw a woman on the street, at first I wasn't sure what she was.... thanks Madison Pub. 

I guess this is a good place to go if you want to get really drunk with a bunch of dudes.

On a more recent development I got to speak with one of the owners. I am impressed by how much they care about their establishment, and are willing to listen, take criticism, and improve accordingly. The way a business owner should be."}

The nachos are super bad by the way but who cares I come here for the cheap drinks and the killer patio.

The dancefloor hmm. Is sweaty. Now when I go there I have to wear old navy or blue notes clothing otherwise I would ruin my Ferragamo shirts.

P.S

The entrance security guard is a brave soldier, pay my respects captain, you have a tenacious temper that does not decay in the worst winter storm nor with immature kids bearing fake I.Ds. 
The band salutes you!

P.S ( I once saw a guy jumping on the spike fence in the ground patio just to get in, as he was being professionally removed by a security guard out of the premises he yelled: I am close to achieve it, next month I will be 19 HAHA frustrated laugh)"}
{"text":"Update: 1) It would be nice if they could change up their menu for the Summer with new and interesting options, as well as add more flavours to their wings, besides having just the same old standards: maybe even have a few monthly experimental options created by the kitchen staff to see what works; 2) On a positive note, I've notice that some of the door staff has changed since my last review and that the new personnel are a lot more polite and customer service oriented than in the past. A few times I have observed them handle potentially out-of-hand situations in a calm and professional manner, de-escalating a possibly volatile situation."}
{"text":"Awful service. We got in and found a seat, And waited for nearly 20-25 minutes before getting served. The waitress hardly ever came over and never refilled our water. We ordered drinks, but never got them, utterly awful. Food was good, And the environment was pretty interesting, but that's all."}
{"text":"We all have somewhere in Toronto where we won't be caught dead in. Whether it's a certain hotel where you got into a fight with the valet, or the restaurant where you sneezed your food onto the table next to you. There are places you just don't want to go. 
The Madison, or 'The Maddy' is that place for me.
Why? Well, first because I'm not 19 any more, and secondly I never went to UofT.

The whole thing feels like a big house party, and that's actually quite good. Despite it being rammed with frat boys and Tri Alfa girls celebrating God knows what every week, the environment feels surprisingly friendly. 
The Madison is a fair sized Victorian mansion with a huge patio that doubles as an overflow area for dining. But mostly people just smoke there. There are a dozen beers on tap, and the food comes in generous portions. There is a decent sized parking lot at he back for the area, and it is generally a very relaxing environment. Buzzing, but relaxing.
So what's my problem?

I don't understand the establishment. This place caters exclusively for the people of St. George Campus and Ryerson. You can't come here if you're over 25. Unless you got the Van Wilder complex, and even then you'll feel out of place unless you're here with like a dozen dudes wearing t-shirts with tit & fart jokes printed on them. Yet there seems to be an unspoken dress code among the Women. Trying to seduce someone to doing their assignment possibly?
Also, I don't ever remember having to line up to get into a house party (not that I was invited to any in high school). The lines are unbearable, and the glacial pace to enter the establishment is as far as I can tell...unnecessary. The bouncers are polite, which is rare in Toronto. But what's the hold up? 

Also the place seconds as a Hotel, which makes zero sense. Do you want to stay at the house next to the house that's having the house party? I rather be passed out on the couch at the party than trying to get some sleep next door. 
I don't think I've ever seen a washroom here. I know there are washrooms, but I never found it. I absolutely dreaded the University years where my friends would have their birthdays here. But I'll say this, the girls are hot, and they're drunk. If you're into that kinda thing.

I haven't been in school for a really long time, and I'm just fine with that. It's not a place for mentally 80 year olds like me.

Oh, and I was rejected by this Russian girl who originally approached me first..then her friend cockblocked me...OHHHH IT'S ALL COMING OUT NOW! T__T"}
{"text":"There is everything in here! Dance floor, quiet patio, bars, live piano, etc. 
The general age group is college students and there are a lot of people. Apparently, it is best to come on a Thursday night but its $5 cover! But you get one drink for free!  The drinks are not really on the cheap side, but it is mediocre. It is definitely close to campus so most likely to come here often!
The only negative thing is that it gets really hot downstairs and it is very loud and crowded. There are drinks spilling everywhere and a lot of young people going crazy.
But it is the closest to the UofT campus and it is always crackin' here!
Made so many memories here during my stay in Toronto!

Note: WiFi is really bad here and you can never connect to it.."}
{"text":"After hearing about this place to be a popular destination I finally decided to go this Thursday.

So expect a queue by 9.30pm otherwise expect to wait at least half an hour. The queue moves very slow for no apparent reason as they only check ID. Not exactly frisking everyone that walks in.

The security guy was polite, I always appreciate it when the security guy greets customers politely. 

Anyway the pub itself is massive, it reminds me of European pubs where it is nitty gritty, not modern, but very lively.

Before I went people mentioned the piano room. Well its not really a piano more a keyboard and an okay singer but he keeps the crowd happy so fair play.

I spent the first hour with my friend exploring all the rooms. The service was quick or slow depending on which bar you try. They have large patio areas, serving food till pretty late so I would like to go here again in the summer perhaps to try the food.

My only issue is it is way to student on a Thursday, would like to try it another night when perhaps the crowd is not so studenty but i suppose being right by the UofT that students will always come here.

Drinks were cheap on the thursday, $3.50 so that was a bonus :)

UPDATE

Went on Friday evening for food - the place was not as busy and the crowd is alot more of a working crowd. The food and service were both good and I think this will become a regular for weekend food/sports/drink combinations due to the amount of TVs and rooms to choose from.

UPDATE

Having worked in the industry this place was totally off in its approach. My friend ordered a Stella. Like seriously nobody here has the money to otherwise afford a Stella and at the time the bar area was seated with many an old drunk patron counting coins. 
He took a sip, he took another and then said something is not right so he asked me to try. 
Now I know how Stella should taste, it is one the biggest sellers in Europe and this tasted totally wrong, nothing like Stella and more like the lines have not been cleaned or the keg was just old.
Friend took it back to the bar, barmaid hands it to one of the drunk patrons who sluurs \"it tastes okay to me\" and then tells my friend she will not exchange it or refund it. Friend was fuming told her to f*k off and off we went."}
{"text":"Just like many other reviews, the manager was unbearable. He was straight up rude. Maddy has changed. It does not deserve our business anymore. There are other places in the neighbourhood you know (green room, el furniture to name a few). Do yourself a favour, go somewhere you are treated well. And for the manager, sorry your life sucks man but you have no right to humiliate your customers."}
{"text":"Le Madison c'est l'insitution des étudiants torontois : c'est immense, on se perd à trouver la bonne salle où nos amis sont déjà installés , on se fraie son chemin en prenant garde aux étudiants tellement excités d'avoir atteint l'âge légal de boire qu'ils sont déjà en train de tituber à 22h. 
Pas de mystère ici, pour prendre une commande levez la main ou agitez frénétiquement les bras pour capter l'attention de la serveuse. Les burgers sont à des prix raisonnables (10$) et le choix de bières est correct. Parenthèse : il y a tellement de choix de bières en pression, s'il vous plait commandez une bonne pinte au lieu de boire de la bud light ou de la Molson.....
Le plus dans ce bar c'est la terrasse fumeur, en été je pense que ça doit être pris d'assaut.
Shout out final aux videurs qui doivent gérer les hordes d'étudiants bourrés et irrespectueux : c'est pas en disant voilà ma fucking id que tu vas rentrer dans le bar mec......


// Madison is the place to go for Toronto students, U of T is next door just so you know. The place is huge, you just loose your way to find the room where your friends are.
Beware of the drunk students on your way in as they are so happy to reach the legal age of 19 and they are already messed up at 10pm.
No mystery here, if you wanna have your order taken, just wave your hand at the waitress. Burgers are pretty decent for 10$ and they do have a huge amount of beers.
Folks, please order a nice pint of Rickard's red or any other beer, but seriously drinking bud light or molson in a bar? You can buy those at the beer store and stay home.
The bonus in that bar is the patio where smokers can enjoy a nice evening in Toronto. Guess it's gotta be crazy in the summer.
Finally big shout out to the bouncers who have to deal with irrespectfull students shouting \"here is my fucking id\" and hoping to get into the bar. Seriously folks, show some respects, these guys are just doing their job."}
{"text":"Meh. The place is big, but the drinks are kinda expensive, and the service is ok.

The place is always packed and rammed with college students. So that could be good or not."}
{"text":"go! (if you're a frat boy, cheerleader, or if you always wanted to be one).

patio is nice during lunch hours in the summer when none of the above are present."}
{"text":"This is the greatest pub for students that don't want to spend a lot of money... 
Like \" okay, let's have only one beer this night my friends ... only one beer...!!!\" .
Then you stay pretty much the entire night... Yep! 
If you don't have idea where to go, just go to Madison, for sure you will have a great time meeting new people from all over the world and drinking a cold beer.,
By the way, Thursday is the best day... :)"}
{"text":"Ewww eww and eww all the way.  They place is disgusting.  Im sorry but thats how I feel even now when I  think back.  Nothing about this place, the food, or the service was up to any good level of standards.  

I found out online that this place was showing the finale of Game of Thrones (crazy episode by the way).  I called in to confirm this event and asked to make a reservation.  They did not take reservations and advised me to come in 1.5 hours early due to high volume.  

When I got there I noticed all the good seats were already taken or has reserve signs on the tables.  I thought they didnt take reservations so why are tables reserved??????????????   

Service:  slow slow slow.  It took forever for someone to acknowledge our table.  It tooks forever to receive our drinks and we waited 50 minutes for our food.  I understand it was a busy night, but the servers were rude.  Im sure they were stressed but why not put on more staff to serve all the tables????

Food:  The first brought my order but then took it back and gave it to another table. WTF??? When the food arrived, the sauce was missing. I asked three people to bring it.  Im still waiting! I felt like I was getting sick from eating the sweet potato fries so I stopped.  The next day I was sick!  

The place was dirty, the carpet needs to be changed, the bathroom was disgusting.  At my table, I could see dirty-eaten food onthe floor.  I wanted to throw up.  I stayed for the GoT.  Who else plays the show at their bar????  Its always sports on the television sets.  The weird thing is, as bad as the experience was.....id go again for GoT. They know my weakness :("}
{"text":"Look if ur underage, this place is GREAT! An over sized OVER sized house party, messy, dirty, yet fun.
I do however not mind their wonderful happy hour specials."}
{"text":"Looking for a down-to-earth kinda place to sit back and relax? If yes then Madison's for you! There are plenty of things to do to keep you entertained and occupied. They have several levels with a various of things to do such as a comfy lounge to just sit back and drink with good company, piano section, semi-outdoor seating area, billiard table, and of course, the dance floor! Near the bar there are also plenty of TV screens if you go in for a sports game. Atmosphere is definitely casual/club attire with a high noise level. Music is decent and the decor is dim yet seating areas are bright red and decently comfy. Beware, if you go on a Friday or weekend then it can definitely become quite crowded! Overall it is a fun atmosphere if you like to party :)"}
{"text":"4 stars because of - PIANO MAN. I hope they pay him well.  The live music here is fantastic. The strange layout causes me to get lost.  I can never find my friends but I always make new ones.  No dress code so I can wear my pyjamas.  Picnic tables inside.  Huge patio.   At the Maddy I always get this strange feeling that I'm really at a pub somewhere in London, England and it makes me want to speak in a British accent.  How much better or stranger can it get?  - Cover (ICK)."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times on my excursions into the city to see friends and it never disappoints as a solid place to hang out and grab some drinks. The building itself is a labyrinthine of an old house with multiple rooms each containing its own bar and theme of sorts.  None of them are spectacular per-se but definitely interesting. The best feature/ room has to be the 'piano man' room as I like to call it.  Essentially there is a room that has a piano behind the bar where a pianist plays Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. There's lots of space in this room to post up with your beer, shout out a song you want to hear and sing along with the rest of your mates. This is definitely the most fun room to be in if you're just trying to hang out and have a good time with your mates instead of trying to chase some tail. It gets very busy on a bar night and is always a good time."}
{"text":"I've been here about 50 times over the years and it's always the same. Really packed. The patio is great. Mostly an under 25 year old crowd. 

I'm giving the 1 star review almost solely because of security. They served us drinks right at 2:00 am and then took them away less than 10 minutes later. The dim witted bouncers were insanely rude when my sober wife questioned them. Smirking bully attitude.

Never going back."}
{"text":"The Madison Avenue Pub & Restaurant is super popular and lively pub around Bloor and Spadina. One of its most notable features is that it spans a couple houses/mansions, which has allowed them to setup a number of different style areas, ranging from regular sit down tables, to standing bar areas, to pool tables, to patios. Just be forewarned; the Maddy has come to be a popular university hangout spot, so if you've angrily told someone to get off your lawn recently, you may want to reconsider stopping by.

Though we didn't necessarily come here for food, I got their basic nacho dish called Nachos Supreme. As far as toppings go, you get yellow & blue corn tortilla chips topped with the reliable staples: tomato, onion, black olives, jalapeños, cheese, sour cream, and salsa. So let's cover our nacho rubric. 1) Firstly, the topping coverage was overall adequate, but a fair number of those edge chips were a lil naked. 2) Next, the cheese consistency. Yes, it was previously melted, but it was served solid. Easy points missed here, because little is more satisfying than a hot plate of nachos with a confidently stringy cheese pull. 3) The freshness and taste of the toppings was surprisingly high. And I must make note of their zesty salsa! Their menu says that it's house-made, and you can definitely tell when you try it. Just make sure that you don't bring any greedy friends who are gonna scoop a third of the dip on one god damn go. Overall the positives neutralize the negatives. A good plate of nachos!"}
{"text":"Great big space.. multiple levels.. good food.. recently revamped menu. I have had organized meet ups there.. met up with small groups of friends. I had the steak & mushroom biscuit pie dish.. soooooo good!! I have had the nachos and burgers before.. good value for your wallet! 

Friday and Saturdays it can get pretty crowded.. so not my first choice of places to go to. Very nice venue even though they could upgrade the women's washrooms.. barely any room to get in/out of the stall."}
{"text":"Oh, the gift of subjectivity. The one thing that we all have that is pretty much wrong depending who else you ask; and as such, The Maddy can be so many different things to so many people. For example, if alcohol is an integral part of your social life, such as that of a poor student or an outright alcoholic, then you will really appreciate this venue's overall cheap booze prices. 

If you love patios, piano bars and gargantuan maze-like-bars where you can traverse in your quest to search for a Minotaur or to find your friends, then you will love this place too. But say, if you are looking for a classy place, then somehow you will regret walking into this overcrowded bar full of early 20-somethings. 

The general demographic tends to hover around the just legal enough to drink (as in, the day after) to about 26. If you are older than this and you are here with just a friend or two, then you might feel yourself a bit out of place once the alcohol gets infused with student silliness. 

If you come in large groups then it really does not matter because The Maddy is a great place for groups, specially if you book the more private areas like the lounge on the second floor which is like it's own little party room. Or the pool area with its own little fireplace and tall chairs. 

The patios are nice although in reality they get extremely packed and it is hard to book them although they do from time to time. And yes, the place is large but it is not as confusing as people think once  you come out a few times. Then the layout makes perfect sense and you will never get lost, but as I said, finding your friends might be a problem if THEY get lost. 

Which I must say, I have used this location for many of my events over the years mostly sticking to the second floor and although most have gone without a hitch from the staff, I would say the biggest problem is having my members find the group.
 
A few times (2-3)  we have been relocated last minute --and this after I specifically asked for this not to be done--  without being advised until we are there... And when  you got 20+ people who thought you were going to be in one area and you end up in another room entirely... yeah... not cool. 

I have gotten some negative feedback because of this exact reason and hence I do not use them much for this reason. Perhaps in the sub 10 - 15 range number then it would not be too bad. 

All in all and if you are not hosting social events, this is a decent, laid back place for semi-larger groups. Food is pub fare so don't expect much. 

Just remember the name of the game here is really to come out wearing some old jeans, joke around, maybe get some sun and ponder on the cheap booze prices. Oh, and the piano bar, it can be fun when everyone starts singing although expect it to get packed.

Give it a chance when you are feeling like bumming it.

Fun Facts:  If you want to walk in, you MUST come before 9:30pm, otherwise you might find a line-up and  they ID **EVERYONE** so bring ID."}
{"text":"it's this sort of giant bar that is home to frat boys and sorority girls.  it's a weird beast of frat party, college bar, and random pretend-annexers that are slightly on the alcoholic end.  
Strange enough, it is pretty good at doing what it is..if you're into that scene.
Fine placec to end up, just not the best place.
Good for big parties because the random bump-ins are not the type that will make you smile or glad you went there"}
{"text":"Maddy's. Definitely the go-to spot if you live near St. George's Station. 

Last summer, this was our version of MacLaren's Pub. We were a group of Californians studying and interning abroad in Toronto. If there was definitely any fun memories of going out, I would say this place hit the spot. 

Amenities: This place definitely had everything from pool tables, sports TV, patio, rooftop, overly crowded dance floor and bonus a piano bar! We have been trying to find the alternative here at Berkeley but it's not the same. 

Atmosphere: The age range here is definitely college students with a few recent grads and creepers but that's like every place. Maybe it was just the summer or people trying to be \"foreign\" but we met many people from Europe. 

Service: I was a bit bummed when we went here for my friend's 19th birthday and they didn't have any whipped cream for a blowjob shot. However, despite the \"angry-looking\" security guards outside, they were relatively nice every time we came, I felt like he remembered us with our group of Californians. My friend and I were kicked out of this place once, but during the process, they were relatively nice about it and made sure we were going to be okay going home since my friend, the guy, was not okay and I had to carry him home. Luckily, we lived extremely close by. 

Affordability: I would say we love this place for their Thursdays deal, even though you have to pay $5 to get in, it comes with a drink and drinks are a discounted price. Despite the many times we go here, we seems to go for the usual rounds of shots so I can't say much about their drink quality. However, I got to say, their prices are a bit steep but that's all of Canada. 

Would I return here? Most definitely when I'm in town, I will definitely visit this place because for the two months I was abroad, this place held many memories for our group."}
{"text":"The Madison is a local institution, and once was a haven for young professionals and those on the up-and-up, who wanted a little class while checking out the physically and intellectually interesting people around them. 

Okay, scratch that - that was a LONG time ago. You have to admire how long they've kept this reputation going. 

The Madison is a haven for local university students who love the outdoor (smoking) patio and the three floors, each with their own bar. Not that I dislike university students (I mean, my fav bar is Einsteins), but these guys just have no class. Everyone is showing off, looking for a fight, or otherwise has something to prove. Earlier in the evenings it's okay, but really get yourself out of there by 11pm and move somewhere else; otherwise, you're liable to ruin your night.

The beer selection is honestly crap (no Tankhouse or Steam Whistle? Seriously?) and the prices are pretty high (about $7/pint). Oh, and forget about getting service unless you can convince one of the servers that you're gonna be spending some dough. Otherwise, they'll walk right by you. Classy."}

Bad: too many flies in the washroom, feels like a typical uni pub (though McMaster pubs are still better...just cuz....I went there).  Regular fries are frozen McCain fries.  Waitress only came around every 15 minutes or so.  Took a bit long to get drinks and the bill.

Strange:  They admit on their menu that it is McCain fries.

{"text":"Having gone to the University of Toronto, i was surprised to find out (three years after I graduated - FINE I was an anti-social geek) that this little jewel of a gem place right off Madison Ave, one street east of Spadina. From the front, the place looks like a quiet little house (the place is surrounded by houses on a seemingly residential area), but head up to the patio on the second floor and it's a whole other atmosphere. On a sunny Friday mid evening, the whole patio was packed! Ended up sitting inside. 

The menu was pretty extensive, you can find the full menu online. We ordered the \"Manor Combo\" which had nachos, quesadillas, bruschetta, and garlic bread. Enough for two hungry people if you ask me! The nachos were not the greatest, a little too dry for my liking, but everything else was ok.  The burgers looked pretty delish and the fries were very fresh.

{"text":"The Madison is a giant pub/bar, spanning 3 floors and multiple buildings.  It's often packed on popular college drinking nights (Wed-Sat) but as far as college bars go, it's a better atmosphere than some similar options in the neighbourhood.

Drinks here are expensive.  They don't sell pitchers, and you can expect to pay $6-$8 for a pint of beer, depending on what you decide to get.

Also, on the busier nights, there's a good chance you'll run into a line up.  Lines move at a slow, but fairly even pace, so you can be happy in the knowledge that if you decide to line up, your slow progress is actually progress."}

{"text":"The Maddy is another bar I have a love/hate relationship with.

Back in the day when I was 19 years old and throughout my university day, this place was a staple for me on the weekends.

It is an interesting place because it is a HUGE house (or some houses joined together) to create one massive bar with different atmospheres of every floor. For example, one floor has a piano bar with cover music artists entertaining the crowd. On another floor, they have pool tables and an entrance to the patio.

There is no cover, the drinks are cheap and you will always run into friends and other people you know and love to see once in a while. 

However, when it gets packed inside, it is very hard to move and to find seating for a group. As well, it gets all hot and sweaty, which may sound sexy, but trust me, it is not!

It is still a fun place to me to go to because it reminds me of university because it has that pub university feel and I never go there and not run into a fellow Queen's University alumni.

Overall, it is a hit or miss!"}
{"text":"I finally got into this place... still reminiscing about the time I wasn't 21 years old yet and the bouncer didn't let me in on a Saturday night because it was 25+ night.... and I had just started dating my \"husband\" at the time, who is eligible for entry.... how embarrassing! Well we're married now and I'm old enough to drink like the cool kids.

Our friend picked this place - it's his favourite bar and he's leaving for England so we had to send him off in style. I've heard so many thing about this place - the cool atmosphere, the piano man, the numerous rooms... on and on and on.

We sat in this room with two very long communal tables. I like the fact that there are coat hooks so you don't have to throw them on the benches. Luckily, there were a few small TVs playing game 7 of the world series and a big sigh of relief that the Cardinals took it home!

There is a large drinks selection, although I was disappointed that they didn't carry Blanche de Chambly... Rickards White is definitely a close 2nd, which I ended up getting.. beware - no CAESARS either!.... I knew by the end of the night I would be getting hungry and was saving myself for the yam fries. The one thing about a long communal table is that if your server is not bringing out your food, then there's a chance you're not getting it. I saw my fries come down the communal lane.. but could not wave the guy down as the loud music and chatter made it impossible. Eventually my actual server brought it out to me. For $6, this bowl of fries are huge... and pretty decent in taste too. Due to the consumption of alcohol, I scarfed down the yam fries... and let me tell you - this portion is really for sharing. Their chipotle sauce is prepacked in plastic containers for ease of convenience - how long it's been in the fridge, I cannot be sure.

Lastly, the one thing that was a little disturbing was the fact that the waitresses would occasionally walk on the tables to get to the other side of the room. Yes it may seem cool, but if I was actually eating a full meal, regardless of time of day, I would find it extremely unappetizing.

All in all, I think this is a great place - good music, and seems like it caters to a lot of people. Come with a few or a lot of people and you really can't go wrong... but come late and expect a line up!"}
{"text":"I went here with a few collegues... Guess I was too old for this place... Sticky table, server with an attitude.. The crowd seemed friendly and energetic.  Mostly college kids.  I can see that I would have enjoyed it ten years ago..."}
{"text":"Oh the Maddy! You've helped/hindered many a University of Toronto finals for me. I've never hated you for it but I sure as hell never loved you for it. Your high population of bros and hos is amicable and despicable and the same time but I find it hard not to have fun here on a nice night. Not because you have a good crowd or great service, oh no, it's exactly the opposite it's because your crowd is so obnoxious and service is so dodgy that there is always something to laugh about. 

If you've never been, it is a pretty cool place as there are endless amounts of patios and a maze of rooms. This place is great for summer nights and to see the odd hot college chick but it is mostly filled with dbag frat guys and dbag frat guys. Seriously, the amount of obnoxious, loud, drunken dbag is mind boggling but they always make for a good story as there is always something bound to happen.

Decor is decent. On the patios there are plenty of picnic benches and tiki hut bars. On the inside there are plenty of bars and small seating areas. There is a bar in every room/patio and on every level yet it can still take forever to get a drink because it is so busy. 

Service is hit and miss. It's a when/where situation as sometimes the bartenders are really nice and helpful and sometimes they are the biggest asses. I guess it depends what room and bar you go to. 

Drinks here are priced decently. I though it would be cheaper as it is a college joint after all. Food here can be god during the day for lunch or horrible during the evening for late night munchies. Again it would depend on when/where situation. 

Overall, this place is where to go if you're in college or want to pick up someone in college. Drinks are decent priced and crowd is hopping with frat guys and college girls. Come at night if you're looking to score a one night stand. Come during the day if you want some sun, a few drinks, and cheap food on one of the many patios."}
{"text":"went here for a work lunch today. i hadn't been here in years, and never in the daytime before. the first thing i noticed was the smell. 

my god! 

decades of spilled beer wafting out of the carpets, not to mention the smell of stale cigarette smoke, which is pretty disturbing considering how many years it is since smoking was banned in bars... blecch.

anyway we sat on the patio, thank goodness, so the smell wasn't overwhelming. but the service was terrible. there were 9 of us, so i can see it taking a bit longer, but we waited an hour for burgers, fish & chips, chicken fingers, & a salad. not rocket science, and the place was empty (in hindsight, i know why). also, 3 orders were wrong.

i actually felt bad for the guy who took our orders, a middle-aged australian guy, since he seemed to be surrounded by idiots, and after a young guy brought out the wrong things, spent some time explaining to him how to enter orders into the system. eventually 2 sort of managerial-looking older people came out and got 5 of the meals sorted, leaving a 6th on a separate table. then they brought 2 of the missing meals, apologized to 1 of the lunchless people, and left the other lunchless person's meal on the other table till we noticed it and fetched it for ourselves.

the food was not great, especially the fish & chips, which two people ordered and neither finished as they were \"overcooked to the point of being crunchy.\"

and now i feel sick. total fail!"}
{"text":"Where do I start.... 

I have never experienced such horrible service as I did last night at Madison Avenue Pub. I am not a hard person to please so when I say that the service was bad then it was BAD. I am usually quite content with my service when I go out to restaurants or bars.

Myself, my boyfriend and a couple of other friends decided to come here for drinks and appetizers last night. First of all, there was NO waiter/waitress serving us so we had to order everything at the bar. When my boyfriend and I went to the bar to order 2 rum and cokes at the bar we weren't acknowledged at all! Not even a simple \"hey guys I'll be with you shortly\" NOTHING. The bartender was too busy flirting it up with all the single women. And us being a couple, we weren't being served. We are just as much of guests as anyone. After 5 minutes of waiting, we finally decided to go to the bar on the upper floor. We were served RIGHT away. We were happy.

So once we finished our drinks. I offered to buy us another round. My boyfriend stayed at the table, as I went to the bar. I went to the same guy thinking that hopefully he would serve me. I approached the bar, and I said \"whenever you're ready can I please have 2 rum and cokes\" in a very polite tone and a smile. He responded with, \"I am serving the ladies right now\". I couldn't believe it. But I already placed my order, so I wasnt going to leave at this point. I FINALLY got my drinks after he flirted with the single women (very poorly may I add). I did not tip him, and I'm usually a generous tipper. 

Time for round #3, the whole table wanted rum and cokes so I went upstairs because I was not going back to the same bartender. I got my rum and cokes right away. I was happy! I tipped him and thanked him. Because I had multiple drinks I had to put them on a tray. As I was downstairs, I lost my balance of the tray and the drinks split. I didnt want to go back upstairs so I asked the horrible bartender on my floor if he could kindly pour me a new set of drinks. He refused. I finally said \"You have been a horrible bartender all night\" and then he said \"well youve been a shitty customer all night\". The bouncer (being his friend) also said Ive been a shitty customer, a girl that worked there also was being rude to me. I couldnt believe it. 

NEVER in my life have I been spoken to like that by someone working at a restaurant. I have worked at multiple restaurants and if I ever talked to a customer like that I could pretty much kiss my job goodbye. Yet these people are getting away with it.

The only reason I am giving this place 2 stars is because the venue is good and the live music is also good. But other than that I would not recommend anyone coming here.

ALSO, if multiple people are complaining about the service then the owner really should have better judgement on who he is hiring."}
{"text":"I've been here several times. I don't like it, but sometimes you'll have a friend in your group who really wants to go. Whatever.

The only thing going for this bar house is the piano man. Live piano singalongs can be fun, especially if it's Bohemian Rhapsody or The Night Pat Murphy Died.

On the other hand, it's full of douchebags, frat boys, and desperate people hitting on and grabbing everyone they see. Visit on the weekend and it's likely there'll be some fight or vomit on the floor.

But I was bothered most when I came here last week. I ordered a Creemore Springs. I know this beer and this brewery well. I watched him pour it, and I know it came from a Creemore Springs tap. It most certainly was not the Creemore Springs I know so well. Except it was no beer I was familiar with either. This \"beer\" tasted awful, with this spoiled and sour after taste. I think this MIGHT have been Creemore Springs some time ago, but there's no way it was now.

I don't think this establishment realizes that not every brewery plagues their beer with preservatives and thereby doesn't last as long as many of the mainstream beers."}
{"text":"I have nothing good to say about this place.  The staff are incredibly rude, the drinks are expensive and the crowd is unnecessarily pretentiousness.  It's unfortunate b/c the location itself is nice."}
{"text":"Madison's has really improved tremendously lately in terms of their service. I came here a couple times this month and our servers were so polite and easy-going! They seemed genuinely happy to be working there. The starters are 50% everyday from 6-8pm and they have daily deals ($4 bar rails, $5 pasta and meatballs, $5 wings, etc) and the ambience is one of the best in Toronto. Love this place. Will certainly come here again!"}
{"text":"Over all I love this place it is unique and special. places like this one are rare in Toronto. It is like a house with multiple floors. It satisfy all the moods they have dancing area soft music normal bar name it and they got it. I have been here multiple times and introduced friends to this place and they liked it. I will recommend this place to people it is busy and nice they also have huge outdoor patio. I usually got there to grab drinks but I also had some of there food and it is good. I would not say special but good. So make sure to check it out if you have not.,"}
{"text":"I am currently writing this review at the Madison using one of their outlets to power up the ol' laptop, using the free WiFi and about to tuck into the daily special which is the softer option.  It's a chicken salad wrap which makes me feel a little bit healthier instead of the stuffed burger.  I've had that before and it is quite fantastic.

The Madison is a mainstay in Toronto near the U of T campus (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/university-of-toronto-toronto-8) which affords it a huge influx of students and locals alike.  On weekends, the place is mobbed with folks getting drinks in and I'm pretty sure it approaches the maximum capacity of 1474 persons, a number that is more than half the population of the town my parents grew up in.  The Madison is in fact several venues, each of which is a reconstruction of old mansions that took up Madison Street.  It's easy to get lost and have no idea where your party is if you're supposed to meet up with them.  How people found people before SMS is beyond me.  There are also back patios available that are heated in the winter to afford the clientele the ability to hit the 1474 pretty regularly.

Every night is a new special for drinks (e.g., Domestic Bucket Thursday, Tallboy Tuesdays) that can easily derail your plans to go in for a quick one and not stay for a session.  Add to this that they run $5 appetizers every night from 4:00pm to 8:00pm.  Why would you bother going home for dinner?

So, the obvious question is what's an old guy like me doing in a student bar?  The Madison is also the host of the Toronto Central Rangers Supporters Club where you're able to watch Glasgow Rangers games from across the pond.  Good for travelling Rangers fans as well is the boutique hotel that is also connected to the Maddy.  Rangers games in your housecoat?  Why not?  Bar opens at 11:00am."}
{"text":"The nachos were decent. Given, it is hard to mess up nachos. This place is really crowded. If you're into that, you're going to like it. If you don't like extremely crowded spaces, don't go here. The music on the dance floor that they have is pretty much badly mixed top 40. The only thing worth going here for is the Piano Man."}
{"text":"Adjectives that describe this bar:
Huge
Frat-party
Oktoberfest-like
Sh*t Show
Wild
Student-y 
Labyrinthine 

So, I popped in here with some friend on a Thursday night.  On Thursday nights they do a special of $3.50 for bottle and $4.50 for pints of beer.  That doesn't sound great to the average American, but these are good prices for Toronto.   This place is enormous and labyrinthine, multiple levels, multiple buildings, multiple bars, multiple patios.  I'm not sure I could find my way back to where I started here if I tried.

Ok, so this bar has a very young, very crazy vibe.  It's filled with stupidly drunk U of T undergrads.  It's not what I'm in the mood for usually, but I actually really appreciated the energy and intensity of this place.  There are more pub-like areas, a nice patio, a dance area, and a piano bar even.  The downside is that it's packed and must have a security staff of 25.  They're a little bit of the over-bearing mall cop types that love to decide that an area has to be clear.  I watched probably half a dozen people be thrown out.   They advertise having 100 taps, but I don't think they actually have 100 different beers, little misleading.  Most of their beer selection is pretty standard pub stuff.  It was worth $4.50 a pint, but I doubt I'd be down for their other nights hwere it's more expensive.  

Anyway, if you're in the mood for some crazy people watching in this ginormous bar, stop by on a Thursday.  Just an FYI, there is a line outside and they check everyone's IDs.  This was the first time my ID was checked in Toronto actually."}
{"text":"A mansion teeming with loud frat boys.

It's great when it's not busy and you're just hanging out with friends drinking pints on the patio.

But you're going to make this the purpose of your night? Seriously?"}
{"text":"Went with my co-workers the other day for a get-together. We had half-priced appetizers including the following: nachos, wings, calamari, onion rings, sweet potato fries, and breaded pickles. I think my favourite was the breaded pickles (but I have a strong bias). I didn't get chance to check out the rest of the place. However, it's a great place to get together with friends to chat for a really long time. Not to mention, the service was great!"}
{"text":"The patio has picnic tables, so it gets very uncomfortable.  The white sangria was awful, it tasted like Orangina with tons of ice cubes.  Nachos were the worse I've ever tried, almost nothing on top."}
{"text":"The chicken breast in the chicken Parmesan I was served tasted rancid, so I didn't eat it. I told the waitress and also said that I didn't want another - I would just eat the pasta on the side. And that's exactly what happened. I guess I was kind of expecting an offer for recompensation, an alternative, or an apology from a manager. In retrospect, I'm a bit skeptical the manager ever found out...

Anyway, I've been here before and had a good experience, which is why this review is not just getting a single star, and aside from the chicken my experience today was fine.

Hopefully I do not get food poisoning..."}
{"text":".... 24 years later and this place is still kicking. 

Came in for drinks with the gang for my BD, and I still love this place!

Good drinks, decent food, good service, and all around good times!"}
{"text":"oh my....is this how all university students act?

LINEUPS
so this place is super busy on the weekends and there was a lineup that was at least 1 hr long. I can't believe I waited in line for that long...and to go to the Maddy's! 

Not only that, I had some s*#% disturbers behind me that kept chanting my friend's name.  Honestly...is that what U of T students find entertaining?

CROWD
I have no idea why but there were all men at the pub.  My guy friends were disappointed.  I wouldn't have minded so much except for the fact that wherever I walked, random boys would chant \"ASIAN GIRL\".  Umm...we live in Toronto. I'm not an anomaly. 

MUSIC
the one thing I did like was the live music. They had a live band on second floor I think. It was great!

anyways, if you go to this pub, just be prepared to deal boys. not men."}
{"text":"Bah! I ALMOST made it through my undergrad without coming to this pub.

My friend dragged me here on a Saturday night. Being the DD, I parked across the street for $6, and the friendly security guys told me I could've parked on Bloor or Spadina for free. Too late. Anyway, there was barely a line-up at about 11:30pm, so we made our way through the front room, where a guitarist was belting out \"Sweet Home Alabama.\" Boss. Everyone was having a good time.

Overall, we had some great laughs with new friends, played around with light fixtures, sang along with the awesome piano man, and met two pathologically lying 30+ year-old men who were dressed in BLAZERS. Wrong place to be, homies. Oh well, they were entertaining at least!

Because this place is so huge and usually packed, it could cater to anyone except those who prefer upscale nightlife. If you're into douchey, gong show frat parties, the Maddy can definitely be that. If you're into non-douchily meeting new people, it can be that, too. If you want to just belt out 80's and 90's songs all night, they've got you covered there as well.

The place is understaffed though. Twice when I was buying drinks for my friends, I ended up waiting at the bar (with only one bartender) for about 10 minutes. Really, y'all?"}
{"text":"My review will be a bit on the shorter side. 

They have some bouncers at the front checking ID. We were at one bar before this, and I had ordered one of those milk jug beers to share with some friends, so I was carrying the milk jug. They forced me to leave it outside, and almost didn't let us in because of my milk jug... 

It was rather empty at 8 pm on a Saturday night. The drinks are quite expensive- I've had drinks for much cheaper prices compared to here. The waitress was quite friendly, however, and our service was prompt. They also have a nice variety of food. They ran out of the beer we originally wanted (what?) so we had to settle with a different brand. 

I just didn't have a good experience overall at the Madison and would much rather drink elsewhere, thank you very much."}
{"text":"This bar was extremely mediocre, having a DJ that played distasteful music, refusing to play one song that was released after 2010. Secondly bar service was slow and the dance floor isn't very large. Thirdly still not over the terrible techno 2001 music. On the upside the drinks are very cheap.Wasn't that bad of a night but could recommend plenty of bars that are much better!"}
{"text":"When it comes to reviewing pubs, bars and joints that sell copious amounts of liquor and beer, it is hard to do based on what people's opinions are. Personally, this place was fun, but not my kind of place as a whole. 

Visiting Toronto from Vancouver, I have been used to chill, smaller, and not as loud places to hang out to have a beer. This place, was not quite the same, but like I mentioned, people LOVE this type of atmosphere. If you want to get lost, have to text buddies to figure out where they are, listen to 3 different types of musicians, escape a friend, or play drunken hide and seek, this place is gold. If you want loud, sing a long times, and people up in your face, then go to the Maddy.

I like that they ID everyone, no matter what. I don't like however, that there are so many people that you have to wait in line. I don't have a problem with waiting in line, but I don't understand why people enjoy the up in your face, loud sweaty atmosphere of this place. 

The beer was \"normal price\" for a pub. It was not cheap by any means. $5.50 for a bottle of Canadian seemed expensive, and 8 bucks for a pint of Kieth's IPA was also expensive. 

Nonetheless, it is Toronto. People love this place. Personally though, I wouldn't go back. I went with friends, and I probably won't go again.

Check it out if this atmosphere seems suited for you!"}
{"text":"This is the biggest and best pub in town.  It's a mansion transformed into a pub basically.  A great place to go enjoy drinks with friends and even to catch a Leafs game (in the basement sportsbar, Madigans).  The dude at the Piano bar on weekends is a good show.  It has always been an awesome pre-drink spot due to it's location, draught selection (all I require is Guiness or Keiths) and seat/table availability around dusk.

Caution:  The food here is horrid you should definitely eat BEFORE you arrive :o).  Expect a mix of drunk U of T students and the minority: Yuppies and old folks.

Plus:  Spacious most of the time without elbow fights, drinks priced reasonably and location.  Ages 21+ Thurs., Fri., Sat.!!!  Kiddies head over the the Brunny down the street."}
{"text":"Place was garbage. Long lines that are not worth the wait. Spend time in another busy Toronto line rather than this place. Crowded bar, weak serving skills, overly power hungry security, and nothing special about the set up. Saw a group behind us not be allowed in because they had beer in line at the back of the line when they weren't even in front of the bar. Security made them do the whole line to then tell them they are not allowed in. When they tried to reason with the dumb bouncer he only made it worse. Joke of a place."}
{"text":"I've only been here once......and I have a feeling that I went a few years to late......seeing as I'm sure the 17 year old that was blatto should never have gotten in and I found myself thinking \"does she not have any respect for her self\"....

The place is HUGE.....I was thinking it was going to be a small pub similar to a Firkin or an O'Gradys...boy was I wrong....there are 2 levels, a club house kind of area, a hotel and the list goes on.

I was here on a date - that didn't work out, but I did get to hang out at a cool place.  It's out of my hood and during the school year I'm sure it's crawling with undergrads - but I would give it one more go, just to make sure I've given it a fair shake."}
{"text":"This place is situated off a side street along Bloor. ID is required to get in. On my way in, a lady said to my friends and I not to party too late cause the music kept her up...not sure if the house is sound proof. But that's exactly what this place is...a house that has a couple of floors to have a cheap drink. The benches have no backs so it gets taxing on your back sitting for long hours. Our waitress brought me the wrong drink without an explanation. At the end of the evening I inquire about it and all she said was that they didn't have mojito and she forgot to tell me. I left no tip thank you very much!"}
{"text":"When friend's ask me \"where can I find the BEST chicken fingers?,\" My usual response is: Jack Astor's...however, if you are in The Annex (right at Bloor and Spadina) or if you are a chicken finger enthusiast living far from it I HIGHLY recommend getting your butt down to The Maddy and checking out the fingers which hands down are some of the best chicken fingers I have ever had! Most people come to The Maddy for relatively cheap drinks, a spacious patio (in the summer time), and of course fantastic live music (aka. PIANO MAN). The Maddy is a great gathering spot for UofT undergrads and young adults in their early to mid 20s because it is spacious, charges no cover and because you can literally walk in wearing your PJs. Apart from being a popular night time hangout spot, most people are often shocked when I tell them that the place is a restaurant serving fabulous food during the day, and in greater disbelief when I tell them that they have some of the best chicken fingers in town!

The chicken fingers at the Maddy are beer battered (like Fish and Chips) chicken breast selects; hence they are very different from ones served anywhere else! The fingers are very crispy and very tender. As usual, they are served with fries and plum sauce. The ONLY downside to these fingers is that they are evidently drenched in oil...but they are so mouth watering that it's barely noticeable. In addition, the fries are crappy and very plain tasting (lacking flavor and crisp) compared to most pubs and similar to McCain frozen fries. However, the fabulous tasting fingers make the fries bearable.

Bonus: The chicken fingers also appear on the 'Late Night Menu,' hence, they are perfect for an orgasmic tasting drunk snack...AND you can even buy a giant platter of them to split with a few pals.

Price: TOTALLY worth it - only 10 bucks! AND if you go anytime before 6:00pm they are HALF PRICE (*with the purchase of any drink).

Portion: HUGE portions and the fingers really fill you up (I barely touch any of my fries)

{"text":"This bar is better known as \"The Maddie\"\" and has a big college crowd on the weekends...... but here's what I just learned this week...... they have amazing deals during the day.  From 3-8pm, all starters are half price, and their house beer (which is pretty good) is only $4.  We stopped in here for a beer and a snack before going out for the night, and our total was under $10 per person!!!!!!  

AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Oh..... and the food was pretty frickin' delicious BTW."}
{"text":"Great place if you want to get some blood flowing, some sweats swapping, and have some floors shaking (which questions the integrity of the flooring). 

I have never been here except on Thursday nights so I have no clue what goes down during other nights."}
{"text":"If I were drunk when I arrived, I would have loved this place.

If I were 15 years younger and still into frat boys, I would have loved this place.

If I were a light weight and could tolerate watered down alcohol, I would have loved this place.

Since I am none of the above, this place was pretty 'meh' to me.  

It's big, it's huge and it's got a lot going for it so I can understand why it's probably loved by many ... but alas, in my decade + years of life after college, drinking well drinks surrounded by woo girls has lost its appeal."}
{"text":"hmmm...yeeeaaah....
 
Apparently this bar looks much nicer in the daylight because when I went on a Saturday night, it didn't look nearly as nice as it does in these picts.
The floors are quite small but it's nice that they all have a bar to themselves. 

There were a few funny people at this bar but all  in all just a bunch of youngin's. Not fun to be picked up by people who have no social skills. 

Good place to go if it's your first time there and you wanna play a game of hide and seek but I don't recommend becoming a regular. YEEP!

ps-  I agree with Alejando A when he mentions drinks being expensive. I'm not from Toronto so everything seems expensive to me but $8 for  a pint of Stella???!?!"}
{"text":"The place the security is so rude and unpolite they try to make you drink as much as they posible and kick you out as soon as they can."}
{"text":"The quintessential university bar nestled just above the University of Toronto. I've spent many an hour here and although not my thing anymore, it has it's place. Unfortunately, some university students actually like good beer and hanging out with their friends and Madison only offers the latter. Come on Madison, spport your local craft brewers or at least Ontario craft brewers. I'll admit that hey did have Mill St. Org. Lager but nothing interesting.

I wanted to rate this lower, but decided that 90% of uni students would love it and I should factor that in."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! It's not upscale fancy restaurant lounge or club, people are simple, Lot's of young people and students there (probably because of the area). Madison is huge, they have patio, dance-floor, lots of tables and par seats, but the best part of the place is piano room with live music. They have great piano man playing. Drinks are good and cheap. Can't tell anything about the food, i didn't try anything. If i would live in Downtown Madison would become go-to bar for my friends and I."}
{"text":"Great food . Cheap beer when leafs play and great kitchen staff and waitresses. Only one time I went it took forever for drinks and food but every other times been great"}
{"text":"You can't knock the Madison! It doesn't pretend to be a gourmet bar, it doesn't pretend to be a home to beer aficionados or anything else for that matter! 
It's just a really huge bar (Toronto's largest?!), with a mix of students and recent/not so recent alumni! There are many many rooms to check out in this mazy place, and you could have fun just walking around the bar for an hour or so. The piano room and the pop covers using the instrument is probably the most interesting segment of the bar!

The mood of the bar changes frequently and if you try to figure it out you can probably align things with reading weeks, exams, etc! 
Thursdays are probably the best bet thanks to beer and $3 mixed drinks specials.
The bouncers are generally nice guys, but kinda moody! Don't piss them off!"}
{"text":"Let me sum it all up in one word for you all: Average. Place is huge, with lots of seating, and it definitely looks like a space for younger people, but it was just average. Food was okay, drinks were okay, atmosphere was okay - nothing exceptional. 

The one thing I really did not like was the slow service. We always felt forgotten, and had to chase the waitress and ask for things twice, before getting the things we want maybe 20 minutes later. Meh, been to better."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I can't base my review on the actual place, but about the experience we had with it. But I figured that I needed to mention this, so here goes.

We were hoping to go to Madison for NYE, and therefore decided to buy tickets in advance. Having purchased 11 tickets, we made our way to the venue around 10.45PM, and there was total chaos outside the pub. Not only that, there was no preference given to people who had pre-purchased tickets. Generally, the idea of buying tickets in advance is that you make the effort to go to the venue and pick up tickets so that your entry is guaranteed and you don't have to wait in line, hoping for there to be tickets available at the door. Also, tickets that are bought in advance should be taken into account when considering capacity and turnout, because those people are definitely going to show up. 

I wish they could've had a better system in place for NYE. What started out as a seemingly efficient system of selling advance tickets to reduce rush on the actual evening, turned out to appear as little more than a money-making scheme. That's $110 they pocketed from us, with no benefit to us."}
{"text":"Cheap drinks but the real definition of pub food. Have to be drunk to appreciate their food. I would come here if I want to get wasted but not to satisfy my hunger."}
{"text":"Yesterday my two friends and I were at Madison, we love that place since is good food, music and people, but yesterday we three paid the 5 dlls cover to get in and once  we were inside I was kick out because I was wearing a tank... The bouncer is mean as usual and he never recognized that he allowed me to get in like that. We all tried to talk with the manager and I was denied to do so, I called the manager phone number and was now available, I sent an email and no answer so far... I read the dress code policy that they have on their website and the \"etc\" let the door open to misconceptions... I like this place but the bouncer and his friends are getting worst every weekend, I have heard about this kind of things very often... Sucks!!! Madison owner or managers should do something about it..."}
{"text":"The first time I went here was in the summer on a weekend afternoon. It was empty. I was one of maybe 3 customers. It was the best.

And then school started again. The patios were so, so packed and I made the mistake of trying to get a drink there instead of going downstairs. It took over 15 minutes to get the bartender's attention, but she was like a drink pouring machine and I was pretty impressed by how quickly she was getting people drinks. And it's college kids, so they don't know what they want and were bickering with her over drink prices (!!!). They're known for their specials, so I guess there was some confusion.

Their space is like a labyrinth. It's huge, so even when it's packed you can still find a spot for a sizeable group. The staff are great and seem used to managing a crowd. It's not quite my taste, at least not when it's crowded, but it's obvious why it's so popular."}
{"text":"Once again, I decided to host a joint birthday party for myself and a few friends.  The staff was courteous while the food and service were excellent.  I was delighted to be seated in the VIP room because it's perfect for a more intimate setting.  Everyone had an awesome time, so thank you for being such a great pub!"}
{"text":"I've only been to the Madison a few times and it was after much duress and persuasion by some visiting friends. On any given night I was quite a few years older than even the oldest person in the bar as it's mostly composed of first year university students and guys trying to pick up wasted underagers. 

Really not my scene but if you're looking for a drunken night of debauchery and people watching, or just to hook up with some random, you'd do well to check it out."}
{"text":"Liked the atmosphere a lot! 

There's a ground floor & 2nd floor bar area with lots of seating for people that wanted to eat food there too. The back of the ground level has a clubbing/dance floor with great music. Downside was the DJ did not take requests.."}
{"text":"The Madison has the only piano bar in Toronto...  A fact that baffles me.  It is a very young crowd and the food is blase but if you want a piano bar, this is your one and only choice and on that basis alone it is 4 stars for me.  I've had a lot of fun nights singing with friends here."}
{"text":"This is a decent place to have a quick beer with your fellow U of T med students.  I was at this place for exactly 7 minutes a couple weeks ago, which was more than enough time to down a pint of Rickard's White.  I can safely say for those 7 minutes, I had no complaints about the Maddy."}
{"text":"After last night's experience at the Madi I can confirm that every meat market has an expiration date... and one thing I'm sure about is that the madi has definitely expired. If you're looking to have fun with your friends, by all means the madi is great. HOWEVER, if you're going to meet people this is not the place to go. It has turned into creeper central. Now I don't know when this little switch-a-roo happened but it has, and so now you can't say I haven't warned you."}
{"text":"The Maddy. Poor dear has been sexually harassed and puked on by so many frat boys she has no self respect left.

This three story patio monster is in my top five least favourite places in Toronto, and I'm including both the Dufferin and Sherbourne buses in this list. Any Torontonian I would be friends with knows what I'm saying, and is aghast at the idea of spending an evening at the Madison. 

I've been dragged here a handful of times over the years and never had a good time. A line up for a pub is always a bad sign. I am pretty sure they are 21+, which basically means it's full of 18-23 year olds drinking pitchers and vodka sevens. The only fun I ever had here was one time I was dragged by a friend's boyfriend and fellow Elite Matt M pretended to be Josh Groban. I guess that was sort of fun? 

They serve pub food and it's bad. 

Pepper is so pissed she has no quips."}
{"text":"Pretty fun bar with lots of variety. Great for big groups to go out and have a few drinks. This place gets crowded very quickly!"}
