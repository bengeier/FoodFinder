{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! They have the best donair. My boyfriend and I literally order from this place at least twice a week. The guys are so friendly, they make the food so quickly and it is always incredibly tasty. I've tried so many donair places in the city and I am not lying when I say this place is the BEST. Pizza is awesome too. You can't go wrong with this place. I would give it 6 stars or 10 stars if I could. Love it, love it, love it."}
{"text":"I ordered a pizza from these guys this week and it never showed up. Delivery guy never knocked on my door, never called. Just went \"poof! \" Of course they were closed by the time I called back."}
{"text":"Their chicken shawarma is to die for! And the pizzas are great too. The best thing is that they deliver as well, really great for cold nights when pjs are on the agenda."}
