{"text":"Food was mediocre. I've had much tastier Vietnamese food. We ordered the beef satay soup, chicken soup and rare beef soup. For apps we had the salad rolls, fried pork rolls and vegetable rolls. There wasn't enough meat in the soups and the soup base were bland (I questioned the amount of MSG used in them). The salad rolls were good, but there was hardly any pork in the pork rolls. Vegetable rolls were decent. It was busy during lunch so I didn't mind having to help myself and going to the front counter to request for extra utensils and napkins. What really shocked me was at the end, when I went to pay for my bill. I decided to pay half cash and the rest onto debit. As I was entering the TIP percentage, the cashier actually told me that the TIP amount percentage was based on the total debit amount and not on the other amount paid in cash. Wow. I felt that was rude :( 

Unfortunately, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Great Value and good quality Vietnamese. I've ordered for pickup a couple of times and enjoyed their Chilan Special Beef Pho - tripe and tendons, flank and all. Great for take-out or a casual sit-down place. Good service too."}
{"text":"They only accept debit or cash. I missed the sign on the front door...my bad. When I mentioned at the till they could do more to let customers know I was told they very rarely have a problem. When I called to advise the manager I was told again they very rarely have a problem and there's a sign at the front door. When I suggested to the manager that their servers could tell customers about payment options being cash or debit before an order is placed I was told the servers were too busy. Call me old school, but when I spend money at a place I feel my opinion matters as a customer. Food and service was decent (although I like a more \"peanutty\" beef sate soup). Recommend the Owners review priorities with the managers. Is taking customer feedback as constructive more important, or is arguing and confronting? The latter option left a bad taste in my mouth...to each their own though."}
{"text":"We ordered pork spring roll, #10, and #65 on the menu. One out of the 4 spring roll were all carrots no meat. When we told the waiter, he just shrug his shoulder and walked away. The pho, #10, was less than OK. Hardly any meat and the soup you can tell is full of MSG. We ordered large but it was more like a medium bowl. Which was OK I guess since it wasn't that good.
#65 rice combo with pork, beef and shrimp was really dry. You can tell right away when the plate was placed on our table that its been sitting out for awhile. There's no way a freshly cooked meal would dry up so quickly. No veggies on the plate either. 
We would never go back to this place again. Customer service was lacking. Not once did he come up to ask how everything was or if we needed anything. And it wasn't even busy! 
I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. There are better places for Vietnamese food in town, this one is not worth the money."}
{"text":"We love love this place. Pho is to die for and the salad rolls are impeccable! Service was very friendly. 2nd time here and we will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Forever my favourite vietnamese restaurant, i always get the sate beef pho and its one of the best in the city in my opinion!"}
{"text":"Our goto spot for pho near home.  It's a bit pricier than it's NE competition but nonetheless matches or exceeds the quality of most places we've tried.  The pho is a hit, salad rolls and spring rolls always fresh and tasty.  Good vegetarian options and the service is friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"There was a point in time that I ate here so often they would know my order as soon as I walked in. Great pho, great service, reasonable priced. Love Chi Lan!"}
{"text":"This place was not for me... The service was good but the food was not.
Looking over the menu we saw the regular Vietnamese fare and in the back of the menu it states the choices you can request to be \"MSG free\" ok.. so that means everything has this additive unless otherwise asked? great. 

So with this in mind we order some salad rolls and vermicelli bowl to share (like usual) The salad rolls were ok and the peanut sauce tasted - off (like it was either from a generic can or just old) 

The bowl was super tiny and tasted pretty awful, if this is what it tastes with additives I don't want to know what it would taste like without MSG. (btw this bowl wasn't on the list of ones we could modify)

Anywho, I didn't enjoy it and wouldn't go back. There is much better places to go in Calgary."}
{"text":"Yummy, spicy pho!  The satay beef provides a real (delicious) kick in the pants!

We grabbed take-out from there the other day. Cold winter days are getting to us all & a nice bowl of pho, eaten in the comfort of my own home sounded like the perfect way to spend an evening - and it was.

Their portions were generous. They packaged the broth separately from all the fixin's. This ensured we had a fresh meal.  Easy enough to put together.  I wasn't sure about how well the broth would cook the thinly sliced beef, but it was as if it were prepared in the restaurant.

Broth was delicious. Would not change a thing!

Chi Lan is definitely worth seeking out in their quiet little corner of  South Trail Crossing (in the strip mall across from Wendy's.)  We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Calgary has a very competitive Vietnamese restaurant market. Chi Lan is a reliable and affordable bet. It offers great value and decent vermicelli.  They do a few things differently than the standard norm, such as shredded cabbage adding some nice colour to the Bun vermicelli.  Prices are very reasonable, with each Bun option being under $10.

Service is good, and the restaurant itself is very clean, modern, and well laid out. It's a safe bet!"}
{"text":"This is a short review, only because my food is coming and I'm hungry. :)
Food is great, service is prompt and courteous, addend prices are fair (considering there aren't many Vietnamese restaurants around, they have stayed humble and fair with pricing). 
I always order the pork spring rolls, shrimp salad rolls, pho and palace chicken on a rotating basis depending on my mood and the dishes are always fresh, consistent and delicious!"}
{"text":"My favourite Vietnamese place! I only eat here the food is always so fresh and flavourful. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Went here when I was in the city for a meeting in the evening. Definitely make sure you have a map on hand as the restaurant is located within a shopping plaza surrounded by many other stores! So easy to drive by and miss it. I got into the restaurant and it was busy! Around 6PM, so not totally surprised, but from what I had read it is a popular place, it definitely showed.

I wasn't greeted at the front by anyone, so I moved to the empty tables where one of the waitresses greeted me and told me to sit where a table was available. I was given some time to read through the menu, where I choose the pork and shrimp salad wraps and a lemon pepper chicken Vietnamese submarine. The salad wraps arrived shortly after with some water, they were delicious! I had 3 of them cut in half (so six small portions). They had rice, cooked shrimp, a thin slice of pork wrapped in a delicate rice wrap, and came with a delicious peanut sauce! I scarfed them down quickly and enjoyed the flavors. Unfortunately I had not yet received my submarine. My meeting was at 7PM and it was 6:45 and so I went to the front to tell them I would pay, but have my sub to go. The waitress apologized for the wait, and told me the sub would be ready momentarily. After using the washroom I came out not 5 min later and my sub was warm and ready to go. I was definitely disappointed with the wait as I was still hungry, but had to leave for my meeting. So after my meeting I ate the sub, and it was also delicious! Generous portions of spiced chicken, some fresh veggies and a creamy sauce or cheese like spread. Still warm too! I might make another visit to these guys when I don't have a tight time limit as the food is really good and worth the trip, but improving the service time would definitely be a work in progress, at least on my trip."}
{"text":"if I could I would give this a 4.5 as it was nearly the best pho I've had. like everyone's comments, the spring rolls were also very very good. we went when it was quiet so I can't comment on the service. I'd definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"When I'm in town I have to eat here! The food is great and very affordable. The service is outstanding! Really!

It can be intimidating eating at new places but the staff here will walk you through the menu and help you find exactly what you didn't even know you wanted! 

Eat here!!!!!"}
{"text":"I've been here once before with a buddy so when I was in the area I thought I'd ring it up again. A little busier than I expected but the service was still prompt and friendly. They were out of salad rolls so I went with crab spring rolls. Pretty damn tasty I must say. For the main course I had one of their vermicelli combos. Once again tasty with an averge portion size. Overall it was a decent albeit typical place. It was no better or worse than other Viet I've had. I would reccommend it to others, but it's not a must see location."}
{"text":"News articles in the paper today indicating people got sick from eating here. Unsafe food practices."}
{"text":"Best Pho I've had so far in Calgary. I go almost weekly and the quality has always been excellent. Very prompt service and great prices."}
