Looking forward to getting ice cream back!"}
{"text":"This is by far the greatest pizza you'll ever eat in your life...no joke...i lived there 7 years and iit s the only thing i miss (besides my neighbor) in Mentor Headlands. They have other good things too but get the pizza...even the white pizza with just tomato is phenomenal. I recently moved but i will travel to the ends of hell to go back for pizza from Corduroys.....the pizza isn't that great for leftovers.....but it's so freakin good that typically there are none!!"}
{"text":"The last review for this place was in 2012.  I had this today.  I got the pizza home and both were undercooked.  The center was raw dough.  The sauce tasted like something out of a can, and the pepperoni was not very good either.  There was a very strong after garlic taste.  This may be the worst pizza I have had in the greater Mentor area, and I have had some bad pizza.  I had one piece of the pizza, and it made me ill.  I am currently writing this with a very bad headache and I am nauseated (usually a symptom of preservatives, which means not fresh ingredients).  Please Please Please, go to Papa Johns.  Or Dominoes.  I would even recommend Pizza Hut over this pizza.  Run far, run fast, and never look back."}
{"text":"The food is ok. Super slow service. The wings are always super slimy even if you order them well done. They always mess up the inside of my jalape√±o poppers! The pizza is worth passing up. The only good thing about this place is that it's close to my house."}
