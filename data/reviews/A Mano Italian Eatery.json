{"text":"I am a big coffee lover and try coffee everywhere I go. I must say this was one of the best cappuccinos I've ever had from anywhere from all the different countries I've tried it was amazing it is a must-try. I've also had their large size rice ball on a previous occasion and it was to die for I ate the whole thing and I'm planning to go back again for another one"}
{"text":"I tried this place when I saw it along Bayly. Tried their meat arancini , lots of meat inside but I found it salty , but the sauce was really good. I also ordered spaghetti with meatballs. The spaghetti had an amazing taste, a good portion , and their pasta sauce was very tasty.  However it only came with 2 meatballs.   I would definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"If you want authentic Italian food this is the place to get it!!! The portion sizes a huge and the prices are very reasonable. The owner is very friendly and warm."}
{"text":"I was looking for the Arancini restaurant that was here before but it was gone, so we decided to try the new place.  I'm sorry we did. We  ordered 2 rice balls that came out cold inside, which they blamed on the fryer not working. If they knew that, they should have not served the food the fryer uses... I ordered chicken parm, for which they almost gave me veal, on a panini, and it came out on a roll. All in all, everything was flavourless and bland. Would not eat here again."}
