{"text":"This was a great place with excellent service and delicious burgers. (I had the pimento cheese burger). Their fries are sooo amazing. Best I had at any bar for quite some time. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Horrible service, I'm sitting at the patio bar outside and our bartender is overloaded with the full bar and 5 tables of 4-6 guests. The food menus have slime all over them..."}
{"text":"Went to try out the great patio scene. Walked in they said we can seat ourselves went out to the patio. Patio was busy sat at a table for 15 min before even a waitness acknowledged. Waitress finally came by asked if we have been helped told her no then she disappeared to talk to 2 other wait staff that kept looking over. No one came over. Ended up leaving and going to a bar up the street. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Had a great experience here on a Saturday night with a few girlfriends. The place was packed, staff was attentive, and the appetizers and jalape√±o burger were great. We sat on the outdoor patio and enjoyed the nice weather and atmosphere. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I can't believe these guys destroyed a great neighborhood bar for this.  Hopefully, this place will have a quick death and someone can try again.  I hope they at least saved the great bar and other iconic decor from Ed's.  The food is below average and the service is even further below average.  The patio was a great addition, but the rest of the changes more than obliterate any benefit of a nice patio.  This really is a sad.  Ed's was a jewel of Dilworth.  Now we have what looks like a strip mall concept in an iconic location."}
{"text":"Awesome and inexpensive.  Had the $3 tacos and they were really good.  I had ground beef and chicken and my husband had buffalo shrimp and chicken which he thoroughly enjoyed.  A friend had a salad which he devoured.  Large patio in back and plenty of parking in back.  Good service."}
{"text":"This is still Ed's. Everything you loved about Ed's is still here, plus they've added an awesome new back patio. Food is solid, lots of drafts, lots of TVs, good vibe. Docking one star purely for the idiotic, generic, bar-rescue inspired new name."}
{"text":"This place was awesome to watch March Madness games! The walls are lined with TVs and the patio has tvs under covered areas as well. The space is big and can accommodate large groups as well as duos. We sat at the bar and our bartender was very attentive. The patio is also a good size and will be a go-to spot over the summer.  I ordered a mixed drink: the Strawberry Basil Lemonade (not frozen) and it was awesome! Well made and just sweet enough, but still light and refreshing.   I ordered the Cheese Quesadilla as my meal and it was decent. The outside of the tortilla was seasoned and crispy, which I enjoyed, however, there was almost too much cheese.. it was overpowering. Also, it said it came with pico... but it was just a pile of iceberg lettuce with tomatoes on top. No sign of any sour cream or guac around either.  My biggest beef with this place is the name. What was wrong with Ed's? Naming a place based on what you serve is kinda lame.. and the \"N\"? Really? Not even an ampersand? The menu was divided into \"Bourbon Drinks\" and \"Not Bourbon Drinks\"... how original."}
{"text":"It's definitely not Ed's.  It's really just not good and the beer is warm.  The bourbon sucks too."}
{"text":"In general, I think this place is decent. The food came out fast but wasn't stellar. The patio was super nice and we enjoyed our time but I can't say I would be going back here for the food.   Side note: while the main meals were just okay, our group shared the southwest egg rolls and they were super tasty!"}
{"text":"A great option to watch the game, grab a simple bite to eat, or enjoy a brew. At it's heart, Ed's never really left. They just updated the name to something awful-sounding and with tacky graphic design. Maybe a slight menu update. The Lady and I came to watch South Carolina play in the Final Four (and that's all I'll say about that. No comments, people. Still grieving.) and I truly believed we wouldn't be able to find a seat. Lo and behold, we found places in the parking lot, and we found all four seats at the back bar to be open. Our waitress was absolutely attentive, and there were TVs everywhere, so nowhere was a bad seat. One of the bartenders even bought us all shots because she saw we were rooting for Carolina!  I ordered a beer to drink, and the chicken tenders with buffalo sauce to eat. I can't complain about this - classic buffalo with franks and butter. Delicious, and a good amount of meat. Fries were decent as well!  Bourbon N Burgers, once you get past the branding, is a great place to go for a game or on a weeknight, but I feel like it did kind of lose the soul of Ed's even though not much has changed."}
{"text":"They're certainly not going to lose money on the bourbon. Rocks or a neat pour, they seem to go pretty light (under 1 oz).  Selection is good, just not great value."}
