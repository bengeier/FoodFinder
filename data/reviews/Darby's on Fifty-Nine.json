{"text":"Used to be one of my favorites but the food has taken a change and the overuse of garlic is in all their dishes. The last two times I have been there, I specifically mentioned to be \"light\" on the Garlic in the pub chips, etc. but tonight, once again, even after I asked - the pungent garlic is just too too much!  You don't need to saturate to the level that they are using. To the point you taste it for days!  It's now turning us off. Just go for drinks and stay away from food - unless you need protection from vampires!"}
{"text":"Darby's is my FAVORITE locally owned gem. The menu is creative and unique based on fresh ingredients from their garden (behind restaurant). The food is always fresh and DELISH. The service is typically exceptional. Don't go if you are in a rush. They are known for atmosphere and providing a culinary experience. Meals are often served with space in between courses... (which I prefer) everything is prepared fresh. And I love to enjoy time with friends over a nice meal when at Darby's. Also, weather permitting, the outside seating is extremely quaint. I absolutely love this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went to Darby's on a Friday night with family.  The atmosphere was great. It was quaint and very well decorated.   Our waiter was also tending bar, but even with the double-duty, the service was phenomenal.  We got the pub chips as an appetizer and they were out of this world.  Our main course consisted of the \"butchers block\" special and the shrimp and oyster po boy.  The po boy was amazing, I find myself craving it ever since eating there. The \"butchers block\" that night was a 14 oz pork chop wrapped in bacon and smoked, with fingerling potatoes.  It was great.  This place is a new favorite of mine."}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times over the last few years,  the food has always been good and the food this visit was tasty, however, that's the only thing that was good tonight.  When we arrived, there was a table for four which was ready, right in front of us.  No hostess ever greeted us or acknowledged us.  The place was not very busy?  I asked a waitress if the table was available and she told us we could have it. After that, we never saw a waiter for 15 minutes and only after he saw me get menus for everyone at our table.  I am not going to embarrass anyone by using names, but this waiter had no idea what he was doing. He had no personality and acted like we were bothering him???  About thirty minutes in, we finally got our drinks and ordered.  This is where it gets good, we arrived at 7:10 P.M., we got our 2 hamburgers and 2 sliders at 8:40, it took over an hour to cook a hamburger??  Seriously, I could have gone in the kitchen not knowing where anything is and prepared this myself in twenty minutes.  We did ask our waiter what the issue was and he said the kitchen staff was not very good and he offered an apology, no drinks, no comped appetizer, no real customer care whatsoever.  I'm sure Darby's will be low on my list from now on.  The only reason they got 1 star is because the burger was actually pretty good.  I hope if you try Darby's you have better luck than we did, or that you are a very patient person who is not starving half to death........"}
{"text":"Great service at the bar. Plenty of beer to choose from. Salmon Carbonara on linguine was delicious."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!!!!   It's under new ownership and it has not missed a beat - it has upgraded everything!  The dinner was phenomenal - SHORT RIB SLIDERS - to die for!!! The desserts are killer.  The atmosphere can't be beat. A night at Darby's is a night well spent. N"}
{"text":"I have not been happy with this place in the past, however, some friends wanted to go here.  It will be my last.  The service is terrible.  The food is mediocre, at best.   Don't waste your time nor your money."}
{"text":"I really like Darby's, but avoid it during peak times - especially when the outdoor seating is closed - because it has a limited amount of seating and no real place to wait. That said, the food and service has always been good, and there are always plenty of beers to choose from.   It's an older crowd, but when it gets packed on a weekend night, it can get pretty loud."}
{"text":"This was our first visit here. We were looking for a location convenient to meet friends. We were hoping for a relatively quiet place so we could talk during dinner.  I wouldn't base the atmosphere on this visit because it was St. Patrick's Day and I'm sure that made the place louder than usual. It was hard to talk though. Will have to try again before I decide.   The food and service were great with one exception.  Two of us had the spinach salad. It was good and we both enjoyed the dressing but it was light fare - lots of spinach with little sprinkles on top. I had a buffalo chicken slider. Good, but a hard call at $5. One of us had the burger. It was great and a lot of food. Probably the best choice of the evening.   Now the exception. One of us ordered the pulled pork sandwich. When it came, it was not \"pulled\" pork. It was an odd slice of pork on a bun. We asked if they could chop it up or something or replace it with pulled pork. Our waitress was very helpful and took it back to see what could be done. A LONG time passed, but she stopped a few times and tried to explain that she was trying. In the end, there was no sandwich. They didn't bill for it, but maybe should have written off their whole check. None of us had ever encountered anything like this before.   We will probably try again to see if it was a fluke or standard practice.  It was such an odd visit that I can only give two stars till I know more."}
{"text":"Earned the 4 star rating.  The black and blue burger (pepper, blue cheese and caramelized onions) was massive and was excellent - I had to finish the whole thing!  Wife had the salmon BLT. Was very tasty. Good homemade chips.  Definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Darby's with my uncle,  just looking at it I thought it would be a bar with greasy food.  But I was really surprised to find out how nice it is and how great the food is.  I ordered one of the specials they had that night and the waitress was super, very friendly and informative.  I've been back a second time and plan to return again."}
{"text":"When I first heard about Darby's, I expected exceptional food. I was sorely disappointed. Don't know how this place gets four star ratings. The food was mediocre at best and very overpriced. Unfortunately, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I'm going to start by saying that I really, REALLY want this place to be great. It's around the corner from our house, it's cozy and quaint and has a great patio... but... I've been here several times hoping it'll get better, but it never does. First, the service, while always very friendly, is painfully slow. Even at times when you are one of the only people there. And the food, while never bad, is just good food at great food prices. I'm not much of a Yelp reviewer, but I really like this place and really want to make it my go-to neighborhood spot. So I hope the feedback is helpful."}
{"text":"My wife and I heard good things about this place so we checked it out, and weren't disappointed.  We had the buffalo chicken pot stickers which were really good, and I had the blue cheese burger.  portions were a good size.  They had some nice beers on tap.  They just finished the outdoor patio which is really nice, and speaking to the owner, she said they were in the process of installing a bar and fire pit out there, which will be great.  It was a little on the pricey side, but it was well worth it."}
{"text":"Had the fried chicken, Mac n cheese and bacon saut√©ed green beans. The food was delicious and the portions were very generous.   The staff when I first arrived left a lot to be desired.  I stood by the door waiting for one of the many staff to acknowledge and seat me. Darbys seems to be a place where locals frequent, the wait staff and bartender knew most of them by name."}
{"text":"Good selection of beer. Food a bit overpriced. Smaller portions. Had a flatbread, 4 small pieces - $14"}
{"text":"The main problem with Darby's is that it is too small. And no reservations. There is a patio for the summer, but not really a view of anything other than the fence and a parking lot. The plus is the food, which is excellent. A somewhat limited menu, but usually a few entrees in addition to the limited menu. Limited wine list, but reasonable prices. Very nice people there. I love to go there, but can rarely get in."}
{"text":"The shrimp po boys are great and highly recommended  , the staff is decent and friendly what was not positive about our dining experience was the local ward councilman was there and he sat there and insulted my partner and I and the management allowed it it continue .  We will not be returning , if you are not a 'normal' couple you are unwelcome ."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Consistent quality. Never disappointed. Lovethey support CVCA Football. We should all support locally run and owned businesses. This is one the .best"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. It is one of favorite date night restaurants. Service is always great and the food is amazing! We've never had a bad experience at this restaurant. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This is a great little treasure in Cuyahoga Falls. If my mom hadn't suggested it, I probably would never have known it was there. We went for lunch, and it was absolutely adorable. Moderately priced, you can get a lot of bang for your buck here. The service was great, and the decor makes the place feel like home. We started off with the tempura fried green beans, and then I got the tequila lime chicken wrap, which I ended up taking 1/2 of it home since it was too much food. My mom and great aunt each got a slider, which is a generous proportion of food, and I recommend starting with 1 and working your way up from there since they are so large. I can't wait to go back and try more items on their menu!"}
{"text":"This is a super quant bar with really cool decor. I personally HATE (yes hate is a strong word and I probably shouldn't use it anymore for these....) green beans. I go out with a handful of ladies atleast once a month, usually more, and we try different places. Since being introduced to Darby's I have been back atleast 3 more times, probably 4. Can you guess why?! Yep! I LOOVE their green beans!!!!!! One of the ladies ordered them and everyone was ranting and raving about them so I tried them and fell inlove They are sooo yummy that I crave them."}
{"text":"Thanks to Yelp we found  this delightful Silver Lakes  neighborhood joint when we were in the area buying a piece of furniture. Great vibe, great people, great food. I had the short ribs and my husband the ribeye. We sat at the bar and enjoyed the regulars and the bar tenders all of whom struck up such pleasant conversation. Food was excellent. Darby's on Fifty-Nine was a great find."}
{"text":"It was good food. I had the scallops which were cooked to perfection but the risotto was ok and personally I didn't like the asparagus it was just bland. But the alcohol selection was very nice and o liked the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Had lunch here yesterday. Was worried they were busy because of all the cars in the parking lot. Upon entering that was far from the truth. It was nearly empty. Stood for several minutes without anyone as much as looking at us let alone greeting us, even though two employees were right there. I finally asked if we should just seat ourselves. I had a scallop slider which was tiny, but delicious. I also ordered a half a peach salad which was very small, even smaller than a side salad. It however was delicious. My lunch guest had chicken salad croissant and Cole slaw which were both void of flavor. Other than at the beginning, service was friendly and efficient. Very pricey for what we received. Not so sure I'd return."}
{"text":"The food was very good. The fried chicken and macaroni and cheese was tremendous. Sliders are a little small for the money."}
{"text":"Another diamond in the rough... You wouldn't even know Darby's existed except for the twinkling lights coming from the outside patio. And even though it doesn't look like a restaurant from the outside, this place is well designed on the inside. You can tell that a lot of love and care went into designing the space. Everyone I've taken there loves the atmosphere and the food. Even the fries are fantastic! Check it out..."}
{"text":"Menu looks promising but end result was not good.  We wanted to sit outside but the sky was starting to turn gray and we were afraid it would rain.  The hostess told us if we sat outside they couldn't guarantee they would have a table for us if it started to rain.  So we didn't want to risk it.  The dining room is fairly small and not ideal for any group over 6.  Actually, I only saw one table that fit 6, so this is more of a date night place.  We ordered the pub fries for an app and it was under seasoned, and the risotto that came with my meal was overly seasoned.  I was not able to eat it without drinking water since the pepper was too much. For the price, our food was just okay.  I wish the nights outcome could of been better, but I don't think we would give this place another chance unless we happen to be near by."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time today with my husband and son. The food was very good with lots of variety."}
{"text":"What a find.  You could drive by this place 10 times and never consider going in.  I almost don't want to post becaus I don't want it to get crowded.   It's small inside."}
{"text":"good food, relaxed atmosphere- good range of food and reasonable prices. nice patio on good days and great service"}
{"text":"I think I may have been at a different place than past yelpers? 3 star is stretching a bit but tonight, tonight I'm feeling generous.   First our waitress wasn't the most friendly. Seemed like she had 100 better places to be & here wasn't on that list. Our friends arrived 5 minutes before us & ordered drinks but my husband got his first. Not sure how that worked out or why the gap. She also never checked on how our good was.  The good? Mehhhhhhhhh. Crab cake was pretty mushy & the side of avacado was brown. Filet sliders undercooked, chicken slider I could not  tell the difference between the bun & chicken. No flavor of seasoning on the chicken at all. Husbands food was decent, friends burger wasn't what he ordered & another's risotto tasted of no parmesan but far too much pepper instead.   We just weren't impressed at all which was a total bummer because we've been looking forward to it."}
{"text":"I have eaten here atleast 10x and never once have had bad service or any issues with my food!  It's small so come early (before 5pm) for a seat!! When weather is nicer patio is awesome! Very friendly!  soups are excellent made from scratch.  Love all the salads too!  Good menu choices!  The owner Todd is there often and always in a good mood!"}
{"text":"I had lunch here today with 2 friends from church. I had the chicken salad croissant, with cole slaw ($12.00) and a glass of wine ($7.00), with a total of $23.28 with tax and tip. Negatives included the lack of handicapped parking and the fact that both the chicken salad and the cole slaw needed salt. One of my companions had the potato/leek soup and also indicated that it needed salt. We had to actually ask for the salt because there was none of on the table!"}
{"text":"Seriously just ate the best ribeye steak of my life!! 16oz and seasoned as well as cooked to perfection. Great service to boot this place is truly a gem. Steak lovers don't pass this place up."}
{"text":"Fun staff, great food and cozy atmosphere! It is a very small restaurant so make sure you get there with plenty of time to spare if you have an event you are attending the same night. Hot tip: they make their own buffalo sauce and it is amazing!"}
{"text":"The food is AMAZING but the restaurant is way too small for the demand. If you go during prime time at lunch or any time after 4:30, you're going to wait at least 45 minutes. It's definitely worth it but they don't accept reservations so you have to plan your night out around if you can get in or not."}
{"text":"Loved this place. My husband and I had the Ohio burger and The Mac. Delicious!!! My mom had the prosciutto burger which she liked. Great ambience and beverage selection."}
{"text":"I went to Darby's for the first time this past weekend, and I had a great experience. We went around 9pm on Saturday night and they were pretty packed.  We, a party of 5, got two appetizers: the calamari and the pub chips. The pub chips were just greasy chips covered in cheese and I was not super impressed. However, the calamari was perfectly cooked and seasoned - the sauce on it was to die for! I was really impressed with that.  I got a margarita for $9 - but all of their mixed drinks are $9, which is a little bit pricier. However, I felt that it was worth the cost as it was very well made - with just enough tequila tasted great. I don't normally get two drinks at restaurants (especially when they are $9), but I was definitely enamored enough with it to get a second!   As for dinner, I got the Chicken Parmesan sandwich and I would definitely recommend it! It was really well made on french bread for $13.  The french fries did not impress me too much, however.   Our waiter, Tyler, was kind to me with great customer service.   I will say that Darby's is a little pricey, but I'd say overall, that it was worth it and I'll definitely be back!  One thing to watch out for, is that Darby's is really small on the inside - and it's part of the appeal (it's very cute inside!), but they have a tough time seating parties larger than 4, especially when the place is packed. Not sure if they take reservations or not, we just kind of showed up. I'm sure it's better when the patio is open, as there is more room for customers to spread out."}
{"text":"Darby's on Fifty-Nine is absolutely adorable. I loved the ambiance - it was rustic but classy - and the food tasted like it was made from scratch right at the time of my order.   We had the pub chips, which were delicious, and sampled a few of the sliders - all very good.   There is also a great selection of beers - draft and bottles, wines and liquor.   On a day that wasn't as hot and humid as today, I would have loved to sit on the patio - it was fenced in and covered in string lights and felt like a private little retreat.   I'll definitely be stopping by Darby's again."}
{"text":"Went here for Mother's Day lunch.  Our cheeseburgers were the best I have ever had.  Very nice and clean place.  Love it!"}
{"text":"Such a great cute little place. The menu is fun and fresh and they have a outdoor patio which is just perfect on a nice day. They have a huge beer/wine and draft menu. The place is small but I think that adds to its charm. I had Buffalo fried chicken sliders and sweet potato fries that came with a Cajun/ sour cream dip and they were amazing. Lovely staff and warm atmosphere. Slow down on 59 and stop because you will drive right passed this place, but it's total worth it. I will be back for sure. $-$$"}
{"text":"A spur of the moment dinner was great. Charming atmosphere. Service was fast and courteous.  The grilled veggie salad and steak was tasty, and the chicken dinner with Mac and cheese was unbelievable.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Darby's has some great food, I had the salmon BLT and my wife had the sliders ( short rib and Southern style fried chicken). I only had two small issues with the place, that they have a limited draft beer selection and that since it is such a small place you can wait a long time to get a seat. But if you go on a day that you can sit outside they do have a decent outside patio area."}
{"text":"SLOW service COLD food NO atmosphere PRICES HIGH Mgmt needed front and back possibly ? WE wont be back again Philadelphian thank God"}
{"text":"We have been patrons of Darby's for quite some time and have always enjoyed our time here whether eating or drinking.  We have even brought our out-of-town friends here for dinner on several occasions.  Recently there has been a change in the waitstaff during the day.  One of the new waiters has been short with me numerous times and his service is always slow.  I recently spoke with one of the owners about the waiter's rude behavior.  I was told that this gentleman is a family member and has been taken to task several times based on customer complaints.  Although the food and wine list at Darby's is exceptional, the hit-or-miss customer service is not worth the cost in my opinion."}
{"text":"We love Darby's! Best bartenders and service in town. Perfect for a good drink, great food, and the perfect atmosphere."}
{"text":"The service was very good and the meal came quickly.  Very nice atmosphere!  The pear salad was delicious and the filet mignon tacos were amazing!  We will be back, we really enjoyed this restaurant"}
{"text":"Went for lunch and found affordable but tasty options. Mostly sandwich options but a few salad offerings and some other stuff.  It's still primarily a bar so the food should be viewed in that light. It's a small place with minimal seating and, from that perspective, the food is far better than you would expect to see in a local bar. It's a great place to watch a game."}
{"text":"Quaint bar/ restaurant! Ordered a bottle of cab, the fried green beans, sliders, and a few sweet potatoes fries. Very good! Will be returning !"}
{"text":"We stopped by on a Saturday afternoon after doing some errands for a late lunch. Easy to get to location right off Ohio Route 8. Note to out of towners, this place is easy to get to, so consider it if you're staying in the Akron Cuyahoga Falls area, or if you're traveling Route 8 for any reason.  Pluses include the beer, wine, and cocktail selections, as well as the price point. The menu is diverse and we had a tough time deciding what to order. There are several appetizers that sounded great, a very respectable small plate offering, as well as salads and mains that sounded great.  We decided to go Tapas style and share a few things; stuffed peppers, arancini, fish tacos, roasted pear salad with a pear vinaigrette, fried green beans, and finished off with a bourbon caramel bread pudding.  Stuffed Peppers - 5 stars. The marina they make is lights out good, and the sausage was a perfect match to the heat and flavor of the peppers.  Aranaci - 5 stars. A very fun dish with a lot of flavor and texture. Bonus is that it also comes adorned with the delicious marinara.  Fish Tacos - 3 maybe 4 stars. Nothing bad, just okay.  Roasted Pear Salad - 5 stars, but you have to like walnuts and blue cheese.  Fried Green Beans - 3 stars. The preparation is the best I've ever seen for this dish with a very light tempura coating, so light you don't really notice it, but just enough to be glad it's there. The downfall was the balsamic that they use. It was just way too sweet for us. If they used a savory balsamic, this would be a five star rating. It's one of their best selling items, so give it a shot if you like sweet things.   Bread Pudding - 4 stars. Very good but it could use a little more punch of bourbon and more caramel.   Service - 4 stars. The bar tender did his best, and is a very friendly person, but he was running the whole show and a couple of things slipped.   I was going to give them 4 stars, but after writing this, I'm going 5 stars. The price point is acceptable, ingredients are solid, and it's a bistro bar.   Environment - 4 stars. Clean hipster joint meets sports bar. Small with around 12 tables, which doubles in the warm weather months.  Try them out, and hope you enjoy it."}
{"text":"My mom and I visited this place on a Saturday afternoon. We were pleasantly surprised at the menu offering and reasonable prices for a small establishment. It is quaint and cute from the exterior and I love the green pop the signs give it.   Although it is small it didnt feel cramped. They could definitely use another staff member serving as they only appeared to have one server and a helper. Food took a while, then again we were soooo hungry so we were impatient. We split the chicken salad crossaint and the burger. They were both very very very good and fresh. The chicken salad was not super wet and full of mayonnaise and the burger was cooked to order. The sweet potato fries were warm and not over seasoned with things and the home made slaw was cold and flavorful. Wish there were more slaw as that was the side chosen, the bowl could have been filled more to mimic the amount of other sides offered.   We will definitely come back to this place when in the area or even travel out there for it. Want to try other things on the menu but will be careful not to bring a large group as likelihood of seating for more than 4 on a walk in could be difficult!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Darby's last night and sat on the back patio. It was maybe 5 degrees too cold but I was comfortable. We were quickly brought menus and a drink menu. I ordered wine, husband ordered a beer. The waitress told us about a special clam appetizer so we ordered that as well. We received our drinks and appetizer pretty quickly.   The clam appetizer was so not worth the $13 price. The dish consisted of 12 clams with chorizo, jalapeno, peppers, bacon, shallots, and a few other ingredients and 4 slices of toast to soak up the juices with. Unfortunately, the clams were extremely overwhelmed by the strong flavors of the sausage and peppers and the dish overall was way too salty. Clams are so delicate and slightly sweet, it was sad to not be able to taste them. The toast that came with it had an awful fuel torch taste to it. I think they were trying to imitate grill marks on the bread. It was very unpleasant.   The waitress asked us what we wanted to order. My husband ordered the swordfish tacos (appetizer) and a side salad. I tried to order the braised short rib sandwich but the waitress informed me that there was a new chef tonight and he had taken a couple things off the menu. Ok, I understand. So instead, I ordered the filet sliders. They were $5.95 each so I ordered two with a side of french fries. If I remember correctly, the french fries cost extra. Why? I don't know.   The food came out promtly and looked really good. I dug right into the filet sliders. Perfection! Extremely tender, perfectly cooked to medium like I asked, covered in caramelized onions and a delicious, aoli. The french fries were nice and crispy and sprinkled with sea salt and pepper. Two sliders was the perfect amount of food for me. I'm glad I didn't order 3.  My husband's fish tacos were awesome! He let me try a bite and the fish was perfectly cooked and juicy. There was maybe a bit too much pepper on them but overall, they were delightful! His side salad was good. Typical lettuce, cucumber, tomato, etc.  We got our bill and it was $50. A bit pricey but the food was excellent quality (minus the clams). My husband was a little annoyed because they took his beer away before he could finish it. There was probably 1/4 of it left in the bottle. Oh well. We had a nice meal and I think we would go back. It looks like they are working on building a bar on the patio so that will be pretty cool once it's finished."}
{"text":"Amazing food and amazing atmosphere! Had a great experience. Even with a large party the chef was very accommodating!"}
{"text":"I think that Craft Beer Bar needs to take some of the credit here. After all, had we not arrived there first only to find out that they were closed (a sign on the front door mentioned something about a \"mechanical problem\") we probably wouldn't have discovered Darby's. They were a fallback and we were pretty happy with it in the end.  It was a Saturday evening, 6-ish. We arrived at the converted single-family house not sure what to expect. Once inside the reviews of others were quickly confirmed - Darby's is pretty, well, cozy There's a bar that takes up about half of the floor space (you walk right into it when you enter the front door) with the remainder populated by a combination of standalone tables and a few booths that line the wall. I wouldn't have been surprised if they had told me that they could only seat 30 people. The decor is comfortable and laid back, basically like the vibe of the entire place. Wood on the walls, dark leather on the benches, chalkboards with drink and food specials. It felt worn-in and modern at the same time. There are places that work very hard to get a vibe like this and it felt like Darby's came upon it naturally.  We quickly spied a pair of empty stools at the bar - conveniently located adjacent to the ladies' room -  and took up temporary residence. The pace behind the bar was frenetic with servers coming and going, kitchen staff retrieving dishes and bartenders slinging suds and mixing drinks. Speaking of drinks, there's a pretty nice offering of adult beverages including a healthy cocktail and wine list along with a craft beer selection (six rotating taps and dozens of bottles) that had the beer geek in my doing my happy dance - on the inside, of course.   Our server for the evening would be one of the several capable members of the bar staff. He presented us with menus, gave us plenty of time to peruse, and promptly took our orders. While the menu is filled with things that I would have ordered had my appetite been bigger - buffalo chicken potstickers, chorizo mac and cheese, and a beef short rib sandwich, to name a few - on this night, it was to be a lighter sampling. Sliders and other nibbly bites.  We started with the calamari, fried and served with a drizzling of sweet soy chili sauce. Delicious. Perfectly crispy, seasoned beautifully and eaten very quickly. Among the best calamari we've ever tasted, second only to Oak Barrel. Barely. After our tasty tentacles it was on to sliders and half-salads.  There are about a half dozen different salad designs, all which looked delicious, and each is available in whole or half size. The sliders, all of which are served individually with a tasting portion of house-made chips, average about $5 each. For an additional buck you can get more chips or fries. This may seem a bit on the pricey side, but once you've wrapped your lips around one, you'll gladly hand over your wallet. We opted for sliders and half-salads.  The Caesar salad was done traditionally with the welcome exception of crispy bites of bacon tossed in amongst the rest of the well-dressed party. My wife had the pear salad with shaved fennel, pickled onions, chili-spiced candied pecans and bleu cheese dressing. She thoroughly enjoyed it. All of the ingredients were fresh and lovingly plated.  The sliders were the stars of the show. Each was cooked perfectly and the house-made soft buns bookending their innards were just right. The lamb slider was perfectly seasoned, cooked a beautiful medium and topped with tzatziki and tabbouleh. The filet mignon was cooked spot-on, amazingly tender and juicy, and topped with slightly sweet caramelized onions and rosemary aioli. My wife's short rib was ridiculously delicious, melt-in-your-mouth tender, topped with a tangy, biting gribiche and fried onions.  We had a really nice time during our first visit to Darby's. Sure, the place was crowded, nearly spilling out into the street with people, and it was pretty loud, but none of that really mattered to us. We felt like we were alone, in our own little world there in the corner of the bar. The service made us feel welcome, the food made us feel full and the memories make us want to return."}
{"text":"Great little treasure! Darby's is my favorite meal. Started with the perfect Moscow Mule. The Pear salad is the perfect balance of flavors-fennel, pickled onions, blue cheese and candied pecans. Finished with my all time fave-the salmon slider, on a fluffy roll with citrus aioli.  The place is intimate and cozy."}
{"text":"Great service with good food equals a great place to go eat and enjoy yourself."}
{"text":"Excellent burger, the Buffalo Chicken Pot Stickers were great.  My wife had the Lobster Pot Pie and she was very happy!  Only negative was that the fries were wonderful but very salty. Could have just been a mistake. Neat little place with a nice laid back atmosphere. Very simple place. Thank you.   Service with a smile and very professional. Nice experience."}
{"text":"Where do I start?    This is an incredible little place in the Falls.    I had the chicken saltimbocca, and it was heavenly.   My wife had a burger served on a bun that was an artisanal treat in itself.  French fries were crispy and plentiful.   The menu is limited to a handful of items that they are really good at.  Atmosphere is casual.  It's all about the food.   My only complaint is that the seating in the booths isn't very comfortable.  I'll go with a table next time.     I'm not a wine drinker so I can't speak to their wine list, but the draft beer selection, while brief, is first rate.  It included Founder's Breakfast Stout.  Do you know the only other place I've been able to find that world class beer on tap?  At Founders brewpub in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  That's where.  Somebody here knows great beer.  And if you prefer standard beers, they have a lot in bottles.  At last, an awesome dinner restaurant. in the Falls.   You've got to check it out."}
{"text":"Guys, this place is amazing. Expect a wait on weekends, but also expect that it's worth it. In the summer, they have a sizeable patio that probably doubles the number of tables, and it's really cozy. I've loved everything I've had, but the bread pudding changed my life. I never get dessert, ever, but get the bread pudding here every time. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I want this place to be good but it fails me every time. I brought my parents here for dinner and was totally embarrassed with my dining choice. I tried it two more times after that and continue to be disappointed. Their menu looks great but what is delivered is a total let down. To top it off, the service is painfully slow. The only thing this place has going for it is the dog friendly patio and craft beers. I hope someone reads these reviews as the poor service piece continues to be brought up as an issue."}
{"text":"Love this place! They have amazing food, although I always just get their amazing burgers. They have a good drink selection - fruity and chocolatey Martinis for me and craft beers for my boyfriend. The atmosphere is great, kind of cozy and relaxed. Plus, they have a nice patio outside to eat at when it's warm. The service is always great. Definitely my favorite go to place in the Falls."}
{"text":"Darby's was an excellent experience.  It is also very popular.  At 4 on a saturday, waiting was required.   They do not take reservations.  A shared appetizer, small plate (scallops!), and half salad was sufficient for dinner.   The staff was speedy and efficient. The only complaint would be that the scallop on the slider was much smaller than the small plate scallops.    The place is 30 miles away,  otherwise we would definitely go back frequently."}
{"text":"Love Darby's! Always eat here after my step father and I shoot down the street on Front St. Their drinks are always cold, they're always tentative and the food is delectable. Their sandwiches are great, so is their soup and salad. The atmosphere is always inviting and very quiet and friendly. I love this joint-check it out!"}
{"text":"This was a last second decision place, selected off a decent looking menu, but it definitely wasn't special or worth revisiting. Everyone in the bar looked to be having a good time, but I guess they weren't waiting for food. We ate outside, which the patio is nice, but the service is slow and  not good. I don't like that the servers don't wear a uniform or atleast the same color so you can tell who to ask for help from. Our waiter brought out a grilled Cesar salad with no knife to cut the romaine hearts. I sat at dinner tearing it with my hands, because I had already starved in the 30 minute wait to bring out the salad, that I couldn't wait longer for the knife. The fried chicken slider would have been better coming from Mr chicken, and the flatbread was cold. I can excuse somethings but never cold food. Overall, we waited 30 minutes for food, 15 minutes for the check, and we're out 70$, never again will we be going back or will we recommend this place because it is that unmemorable."}
{"text":"Went for the 1st time ever for lunch on a cold Wednesday.  Overall experience was excellent.  It wasn't busy at 1:30. A few tables taken.  The guy serving us was super friendly.   The place is clean and cozy.  They have daily specials.  I got the soup of the day which was tomato basil-delish!! We also got the buffalo chix potstickers, omg yum!  Then we each got a fried chicken slider.  Comes on a mini homemade bun, score!   Nice juicy hunk of chix, not a skinny frozen processed thing.  Enjoyed the breading in it, but I did add some mayo and on some bites I dipped it in ranch ... Sooooo good!!  We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"We ended up walking out and will never return.  If you are not a local or regular to this place (we were here from out of town for business) you will be ignored.  We waited for over 30 minutes for a table to only have several parties come in after us and be seated ahead of us and we even called to verify if they accepted call ahead seating and were told no.   Horrible first and last impression"}
{"text":"If you want a Cheers atmosphere-- this is it. This place is so small and quaint. The food is freaking delicious and unpretentious. The staff is eager to please and friendly. This is our favorite place to eat in the area."}
{"text":"What a fantastic little hole in the wall, my only complaint would be that it's so small. But I have never had a bad meal here. The house potato chips are amazing, the calamari is delicious, and the fried green beans are to die for. The scallop and short rib sliders are a must have. Everything on the menu is delicious."}
{"text":"Eh. I wasn't impressed, but not entirely let down either. We waited way too long for a table (which is mainly because the restaurant is super small, but also because the service is super slow) but we've been wanting to check this place out for a while. Our server was very friendly, but it took forever to get our food. I ordered the lobster bisque, which was amazing and had big ol chunks of lobster in it (as it should for $9 a cup) and a buffalo chicken slider, which left something to be desired. It wasn't bad, per se, but it wasn't anything to write home about. My husband ordered their macaroni and cheese entree, which was good, but hardly worth the $18 we paid for it. Basically, the food is good but definitely overpriced. We don't mind spending a little more money on a nice dinner, but this was spending a little more money on an average dinner."}
{"text":"4 stars may be a little generous but I am going with it. This is a local place that just opened recently and I have heard great things about so I was super excited to try it.   I got the salmon BLT and it was good. Not great but good. The bacon was thick and tasty, but there wasn't a huge amount of salmon, what was there was cooked OK, not over but not perfect. I also had a side wedge salad and this was spectacular. I don't get weed salads often but this one caught my eye and I'm so glad it did. It was wonderful with the blue cheese crumbles. We also ordered some pub chips for an app, and these were also just fantastic. Garlicky and Parmesan made these stand out for sure. And they give you a ridiculous amount of them. My husband had the filet sliders and I thought they were they great, he asked for medium rare and they were medium but not that big of a deal.   The prices and the drink menu were good. We sat outside because inside was packed, which I didn't expect for a Tuesday night, and it was a bit chilly but they had a neat area with rocks on fire that the chef said was new. It's absolutely a place to come and get some really good food and hang out. We live right around the corner so you can expects some updates on the food!"}
{"text":"Oh, hey, THIS PLACE IS GREAT. I grew up down the road from it, when it was a skeevy-seeming bar called Frankie's that I only ever went to once, for a friend's dad's band's performance. It was as expected.  So when Frankie's closed for a year & transitioned to Darby's, I was skeptical. Their space is teeny-tiny, it's in a sort-of-weird location... How good could it be? But I kept hearing, over & over, that it was outstanding, so I finally gave it a try.  A+, two thumbs up, would go back again on repeat.   The space is gorgeous, totally revamped from its Frankie's days. It feels very clean & a little bit fancy, & somehow much bigger than before. Their food options are broad, from burgers & wraps to strip steak, scallops, & fried chicken with mac & cheese. I feel like there's something for everyone (& every wallet preference) on their menu. They also offer a few different kinds of sliders, none of them burgers, which is sort of an interesting twist. Their lunch prices are particularly reasonable, & as a dinner spot, Darby's is suitable for a date, a meal with Mom, or catching up with friends - casual or a little bit upscale.   At night, Darby's transitions from restaurant to bar, with craft beer options & basic beer options alike, in addition to a full bar, that make it a great space for casual weekend nightlife.   I'm a fan. Well done, CF."}
{"text":"First time in today . Very good and fresh . Will be back. Had soup and salad on this very rainy day. Everyone was very friendly. Hope to try some other dishes next time. I thought the portions were very good. Will try out happy hour soon. Spinach salad was very good. Potato soup and crostini was awesome."}
{"text":"My husband and I love Darby's.  The food is excellent so is the service. Tuesdays are burger deal night.   The have everything from burgers to short ribs to a catch of the day.   It is DEFINITELY not for kids.   All the seating is at high top tables. They also have a great outdoor dining area which usually fills up fast.     We generally eat here at least once if not twice a month."}
{"text":"Service was a little slow but the food was great. She was really nice, just a lot going on for only one waitress. Loved the sliders! Super cool atmosphere. Very rustic. It gets pretty crowded quickly though.   Update: we came back on a Tuesday for their burger night. It was $6.99 for a huge burger and your choice of fries. I got the sweet potato fries. It was a fantastic meal, especially for the price. Usually establishments give you quarter pounders for the special. Not here."}
{"text":"Not so hidden gem in the Falls! Place packed, maybe it's bc Tuesday is American cheeseburger nite. 7$ gets you the basic American cheeseburger, LTO on the side w my only complaint, a flimsy vlasic pickle sliver, and a decent portion of hand cut fries. Cannot overstate how good the homemade in house bun is, Incredible! Lookin over the menu it's pricey 30$filet 31$ ribeye 10$ salads but they must be doin something right. Standing room only every seat at the bar taken as well"}
{"text":"I have dined and imbibed at this place a number of times. Kind of like a slightly upscale neighborhood bar.  Last visit was good. Waiter was on the job, but not obnoxiously so.  Tuesday night is burger night...American burger with fries for 7$. Good bar and good drink selection. Outside seating as well. Kind of hard to spot as you roll by on 59. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Cozy little atmosphere at this little restaurant. The food was amazing and tasted like it was from quality ingredients. They have a great beer selection and cocktail menu. I strongly suggest trying the filet mignon tacos - they were absolutely delicious. Not only was the food and beer great, our server (Sarah) was so tentative. All around delightful experience!"}
{"text":"Very overpriced food, very substandard food. Wait staff is a joke.  If you like being ignored in the front room of a one story house and being charged for it, by all means. Otherwise, go to freaking McDonald's."}
{"text":"Where else can you go to eat delicious, crisp, fresh cut truffle fries? I mean honestly, I can't think of any where else that's local that offers such a unique menu. And, for all of you die hard cheese cake fanatics- their New York style cheese cake isn't bad either :) Can't wait to go back and dive into another delicious meal at this cozy little hidden gem."}
{"text":"I had never eaten at this restaurant before, but I grew up right around the corner and I went to school with the original owner Mike Darby.     I was with a friend who eats there  quite often. They do not take reservations,  the place was packed when we arrived. We were  able to get a table within 30 minutes. staff was phenomenal! I believe that our server's name was Tyler, he was wonderful.  The calamari was lightly breaded & seasoned/spiced just right.  I had  a half portion of the roasted beet salad with scallops. The scallops were cooked to perfection.  creme br√ªl√©e cheesecake- oh my!!  we wound up staying until closing . We never felt rushed and it was a great experience. I honestly don't know why I have never had a meal there before but it certainly won't be the last!"}
{"text":"This has to of been one of the most enjoyable dining experiences we've had in a very long time! Tyler our bartender/server was outstanding and his attention to detail was supurb. The food, was over The top. We ordered the scallops and risotto, holy cow!!! Amazing!! I highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"From the moment we walked in the door we had a great experience. We were immediately sat, greeted and brought menus by I think a busser. Then our server Renee was prompt and got our drinks, (which never were empty all night). Our appetizers were the peppers and calamari and were perfect. Our server went over all the specials with great detail,  I enjoy that because sometimes you may have a question. We both ended up getting the fried chicken, Mac and cheese and veggies. Amazing. Honestly, it was super crunchy and yummy! Then when we were done our server went over the desserts and we got the whiskey bread pudding. Wow. That may have been my favorite part! Lol! Honestly,  I am a picky person and I give this place 5 stars. This is a quality spot."}
{"text":"Good food.  Fresh food. Healthy alternatives. Phenomenal burgers. Nice atmosphere.  Friendly service. Would definitely return."}
{"text":"The food is fine, not great, fine. I feel it is overpriced for what it is.I can't say that a regular burger with caramelized onions or blue cheese is now a gourmet burger and charge too much.Several people have complained about the service and I agree - they are really understaffed. The staff is great but they have crammed so many tables into a very small room that the wait staff can't keep up. This is an old house they converted into a restaurant/bar so the dining area is the living and dining rooms. If the weather is nice, outside area is nice , but again, slow on service."}
{"text":"Great food, Tyler was awesome, asked our food preferences and suggested the perfect meal for my wife and I. Pear Salad was one of my all time favorites, 16 Oz Ribeye was fork tender and amazing. My wife got roasted veggie salad and Scallops with risoto. Great flavor. She is a vegetarian that usually has choice of bad pasta. I had to stop her from licking  the plate."}
{"text":"Great Philly Cheese steak, fries, and ranch!  I'd definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great, cozy place with awesome service and a fresh, trendy menu. I've been delighted there for lunches, happy hour, and even winding down date nights with my wife."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant with some seriously delicious food.  We had dinner at the bar last night.  Service was quick and friendly.  I had the ahi tuna as an App then the salmon blt on Texas toast with Mac n cheese as my entree and my fianc√©e had the jalape√±o burger with fontina cheese and fries.  They were both outstanding.  My fianc√© said his burger was the best burger he has ever eaten in his life.  So kudos to you Darby for that one.  He is a picky one to please.  The only thing I didn't care for was the Mac n cheese.  They loaded it up with way too many breadcrumbs.   We will definitely be back next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Darling restaurant with yummy food!! I like the inside, they also have an outside patio that is cute and they have their own garden which is terrific!! The menu is full of really tasty things, I've attached pictures of the food we ate. Everything we had was delicious.  The steak sliders were fantastic, the fries were yummy, the green being appetizer was tasty, and the mac & cheese was to die for!!"}
{"text":"Came here today for lunch and loved it! The restaurant is so small and cute on the outside, and a wooden tavern/bar on the inside. It's not a place anyone would directly pick out to go to for food, but should. The menus posted are mainly up to date. I had the filet mignon tacos which were cooked and presented perfectly. For my entree, I had the Ohio Burger with a side of Mac n cheese. They make their own homemade buns from scratch for sandwiches and the meat is thick and juicy. The Mac n cheese is a MUST get. We waited an average time for the food, and the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"Food is good for the most part I have at least liked everything I have tried. Wine and beer list are solid also. Place is small but nice the clientele is fitting for the atmosphere. Darby's on Fifty-Nine would make a good date night.   Cheers responsibly"}
