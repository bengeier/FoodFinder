{"text":"I love this place. The food truck is awesome so of course the little restaurant they have is just as good."}
{"text":"The potstickers are amazing!!!! We checked these guys out while at the Gibson Mill a few weeks ago. I'm sold, and will be back again."}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered a few items while they were at Cabarrus Brewing- we both agreed that it was the best food truck food that we have ever had. We ordered pork nachos, chicken skewers, pork steam buns, and dumplings.. We loved all the dishes, but the nachos were our favorite !"}
{"text":"Chibogz has a brick and mortar restaurant but a couple of months ago I got to try their food truck that was parked outside of High Branch Brewing.

The ordering process was easy and they come find you/bring it to you when it's ready. The staff is young and energetic.

We tried the Lumpia, Manila BBQ Skewers and Gyoza. Nothing to write home about but not bad either. The pork skewers were a bit dry and chewy, as were the Gyoza. The flavors were good though. Maybe just caught them on an off day or moment.

Looks like once a month they pull out all the stops and do a Filipino Street Food feast."}
