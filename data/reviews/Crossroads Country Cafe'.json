{"text":"Since relocating to this area, I have been on the search for a real restaurant that I can take my family to and feel good about taking a night off from the kitchen myself.  One in which actual food is prepared and served.  Unfortunately, all I got here was another swing and a miss.  

Our server was friendly, but could not really answer the questions that we asked her about the menu, or tell us what the charge was for a child to get the buffet.  We also had to wait for at least 15 minutes for them to figure out our check.  We had a coupon, and they were having an issue with the register.  They finally figured it out manually, which is what they should have done in the first place, and figured out their difficulty after we left since no one else was in there.

On to the food.  My husband and I got the Friday night dinner buffet for just under $10, which included a decaying salad bar.   The lettuce came straight out of a bag and was slimy and had plenty of brown on every edge.  They were clearly not going to replace it until some poor soul actually ate what was there.  All of the veggies, looked as if they were bad or going to turn at any second.  

If they actually make anything from scratch here, I just would never believe it, probably even if I saw it.  Everything had the taste of processed, frozen or boxed Sysco food.  The mashed potatoes were the flakes out of a box.  The stuffing tasted like stove top with extra pepper, not a real piece of onion or celery to be found.  The beets were rotting.  The corn was frozen.  The meats, turkey and meatloaf, arrived at the restaurant frozen and heated up in a sea of frozen or canned gravy.  

The only reason I gave Crossroads Country Cafe' 2 stars is because I have been served worse, once or twice in my life, and the people here were at least friendly.  But as far as dining here, you can get the exact same meal, much cheaper, from your grocery store freezer, and cook it in your own microwave."}
{"text":"Dirty place. I wanted to scrub the table and wash the silverware before we even sat down. It's dingy, rough looking. The food wasn't terrible but it wasn't good either. The staff was nice enough."}
{"text":"I often visit this area during the summer time.  It is right in the center of Middlefield, away from the tourist zone.  My family and I were looking for a place the locals go to, not part of a chain, and not part of the tourist trap genre.  This place is reminiscent of a 1970's diner.  You can order breakfast, lunch and dinner.  Menu is basic comfort food.  Service is friendly and attentive.  Food is prepared well, and portions are generous.  I got the special hamburger for $2.50 (without sides).  I'll admit that the salad bar looks a bit sad.  If you are looking for a place that serves basic comfort food, is not fancy, part of a chain or touristy, this is a great place to go.  Should also mention it is kid and family friendly."}
