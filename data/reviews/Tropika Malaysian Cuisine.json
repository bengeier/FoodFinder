{"text":"As a Singaporean, I'm very disappointed with the food. The satay is all right, but the food doesn't even come close to the real thing. It doesn't have to be the real thing, but at least make it close to it. We ordered Hokkien Mee, and it came out as something completely different. I wouldn't go back there again."}
{"text":"The food has certainly gone downhill while the prices have gone uphill. I've been there a handful of times over the years and each time it seems like this place has gone a little further downhill. Definitely not good value for the price.

On the most recent visit, I ordered sambal bunchies(stir-fried green beans in sambal chili sauce), curried beef brisket and lemon-grass chicken. The sambal bunchies was the best dish. The curry brisket was decent but nothing spectacular. The lemon-grass chicken was underwhelming. 

Over the years, the prices have crept way up... but the food has been mediocre at best at this Calgary location. I wouldn't go back there again."}
{"text":"This used to be a good location for our group of friends to go for a mass dinner, usually for a friend's birthday or going-away party. When I think of Tropika Malaysian, I think of Richapalooza. And vice versa. It is now likely about four or even five years since we've gone (and because it is on the opposite side of the city, probably just as long as its been closed as far as I know), and what I remember are delicious dishes and good laughs being shared before our stomachs were pummeled into submission. It has been far too long to remember specific dishes and complaints (aside from the hefty bill we would pay at the end of the night, without drinks), so I rate it three stars for the pleasant memories. There is also an infamous photo of Kat and I during the last Richapalooza in 2005, where I am at the end of a three month beard growing operation, and looking a lot like Benny from ABBA. R.I.P. Tropika, see you in another life!"}
