{"text":"This place just SUCKS! The owner is a HUGE DOUCHBAG he tells people they need to buy more drinks because he has kids."}
{"text":"Drinks are reasonably prices, but it doesn't make up for the drama that seems to follow the people there. Never seen so many situations in one night."}
{"text":"Hmmm I have not had the displeasure of dance night at the Chilly, I guess. I came here to meet some friends I haven't seen in a while and ended up having quite a good time on poker night. 

It was crowded but I never had a hard time getting a drink. Mostly regulars, I would guess, and I thought everyone was pretty cool that I played with. 

Can't complain, but can't rave, either..."}
{"text":"I'm going to rate their Saturday night.

We went in around 830 to grab some food and drinks.
At 9 the DJ booth turned on (which was unfortunately right next to our table) and blinded us with neon lights.
The food came out really fast, but it was really good. We all got hamburgers variations (cheeseburger, double cheeseburger, etc.) with fries and it was all pretty fantastic for bar food. In fact, I would probably come back in the daylight hours to try some other items off of their (somewhat limited) menu.
Then at 930/10 the DJ started spinning this weird mix of 90s music. I can only assume that Saturday nights are 90s nights and that is the reason behind it, because there's no other explanation.

I would recommend this bar for a girl's night, boys night, date night where you want to dance (though you might be the only ones dancing out there... at least that was how it was for me and my friend)"}
{"text":"This bar sucks. Its small bar that wishes it was a night club. It's full of dumb douche bag types who think they are in Scottsdale or something.  I feel like I need to hit people when I go there. The staff sucks an they are FULL of drama and would much rather be busy with their friend and drama that serving drinks to people that actually pay! I only recommend this bar to white kids with no money but think they are rich."}
{"text":"This Place sucks.

I'm 25. And back when I was a newly 21yr old I use to come here and get annihilated. 
Look let me be honest. This place is GREAT if your 20-21 and want to pick up a drunk SLUT. And when I say slut...i mean dirty slut. During the day this place is like a ghost town. Only at night is when the activity picks up, usually only Friday and Saturday nights.
The owner or head manager now, use to be the manager/owner (not sure which he is) at another crap hole, Casey Jones. Which isn't too far away.
Anyway I digress....He is is douche. Racist guy. Kicked out my black friend one night because his pants were \"baggy\" and they were skin tight compared to the types that frequent in here.

To sum this place up, you might get stabbed, hit with a bottle or catch a std just by entering into this closet."}
{"text":"I had been here a few years ago and it wasn't that great. That being said, my wife & I and a bunch of friends didn't have high expectations. We were looking for a place that had some dancing and there isn't much in north Phoenix so we figured we'd give it a shot. We arrived around 9:30 on a Friday night. The place was pretty quiet and not crowded at all. TV's were still on and only light music in the background. So far, it wasn't looking good.  We got a menu and some of our friends ordered food. Sometime around 10 a DJ started playing. Started off slow, but soon enough we were all dancing around our tables, having a great time! Not to mention the drink specials were awesome!! We will definitely be back again. My only complaint would be that it's a pretty small place."}
{"text":"Terrible bar to go have drinks at. It's about the size of my living room and they let more people in than the fire department allows. There is always some kind of fight here.if this place closed down it would be the best thing that ever happened to the area."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of 20 after they had their poker night. 

Everything on their menu was fried, fried, and more fried.  Not one healthy item!

And I was a bit afraid to drink the water they served me cause I wasn't  sure if the cup was clean since quite a few of the plates the waitress brought out for the appetizers were dirty.

The upside was the waitress was friendly and the company I was with was fun.

Def would not come here on my own or be one of my choices if I was the organizer!"}
{"text":"i haven't been here in ages, but i'm sure much hasn't changed.  whoever said that they are over-priced must be from somewhere else because there prices are definitely low to average.  which is why there hasn't been a single incident when i haven't witnessed a bunch of over-served d-bags.  it takes a LOT for a bar to make me feel uncomfortable, but this one succeeded.  there are some great people that hang out there, but there are enough shady ones that it's just not worth it.  there are too many other dive bars in the area to ever go back here."}
{"text":"Service was good.  Our bartender was friendly.  Overall it's a nice place to drink in the middle of the afternoon. The bathroom was clean and smelled nice."}
{"text":"This is a Browns backer bar and closest to our home.  The bartendar, Leanne is fantastic!  What a sweetheart and on her toes!  The medium wings are awesome, didn't care for the onion rings and the basket of fries is huge and yummy!  On a plus, they serve Coke products.  The group that comes in to watch the Browns games are a great bunch.  On a Sunday afternoon, the crowd is mostly 30+ and everyone is friendly, regardless of what team they are there to see.  Drink specials and food specials are great prices.  Friday & Saturday nights is 21-25 year olds."}
{"text":"Last Friday was my first time visiting this place in 10 years, and I had a really great time all around.

It was the day after New Years, so it wasn't really packed. Although It is a smaller venue, I saw first hand that it has a lot to offer in food, drinks, good people, and fun.

I looked at some of the yelp reviews before coming in here, and although some of the negative reviews were not very encouraging, i'm really glad that I did stop in anyway and ignored those reviews because my experience here was the polar opposite of what I saw from those people.

At about 9pm I arrived and ordered something to eat and to drink, which was served almost immediately (it took about 7 minutes for the food, and 2 minutes for the drink).

It looks like it's just grill food that is available after 8pm (chicken tenders, hamburgers, fries, sliders, etc) which is normal for pub food, but just be aware of that in case you're expecting the full menu like I was when you stop in. When the food arrived it was great and I enjoyed it!

The drinks were nice and cold, and the prices are pretty cheap compared to other places in the valley.

I used the ATM machine to pull out some cash (as a rule of thumb, no matter where I go, if it's a bar I tend to pull out cash instead of credit or debit at bars just to avoid any issues with it). The ATM machine fee is either $2.95 or $3.95 in case you were wondering or needed to know, which is about the same as any Bank of America or Chase ATM on average. Some bars have a higher ATM fee than this, so I was glad to see that I didn't have to even worry about it.

Throughout the night there were actually 3 different bartenders; two pretty female bartenders (one was a shorter girl that sang country well and kind of looked like Avril Lavigne) that were really nice, and a cool dude named Lance, They were all very friendly and provided outstanding service, and never missed a beat even when it started to get busy around 10 o'clock.

The group of people I came to hang out with arrived at about that time, and karaoke with Simon started. They dimmed the lights, and the party got started. ;)

The karaoke is a lot of fun, and overall there were some really good singers that were fun to listen to. There is also a small stage area you can go up on if you decide to sing.

What's the karaoke style like? It's very laid back. Instead of looking through a book for a song, you just go up to the host and ask if the song is in the collection, and write down what you want to sing there. Most popular songs are already in the collection so you can just write down what you would like to sing, but it's always a good idea to check just in case (or have a backup song that you know is common and will be in there).

At the end of the night I spoke with one of the owners (Abe) who was really chill and talked for a few. I got a good vibe from the owner and all the employees there.

Most of the patrons were really nice and fun to hang out with, and two cool folks (Joel an Tomique) even bought our group shots twice - just because! It was a good bunch who showed up throughout the night there. From country to hip hop, r&b, 80's, and cameos by a professional singer or two, you'll find it all in there.

So far I can only speak for my experience and friday nights, but as far as pubs and karaoke places go, my visit to Chilly Bombers was one of the nicer times I've had in one for quite some time.

I'd encourage anyone who maybe didn't have the best experience their first time around to give it another shot or see if their experience was just one night's crowd or an isolated situation. My honest take on it is that even if one or two times end up not being great, I had way too good of a time and awesome service to not give it another try."}
{"text":"This bar is terrible in all ways possible.

Bar: Overcrowded and overpriced. You will wait/push/shove/yell for at least 5 to 10 minutes to get any drink.

Inside: Crowded to the point where you have to manhandle the other patrons to get anywhere. The dance floor is the size of a civic hatchback. 

Outside: The patio is tiny and always overcrowded just like the inside.

People: 21 - 25ish all tattoo artists (ie chronically unemployable) and they all know each other. The patrons of this bar think that trying to \"act hard\" and draw pictures on peoples' arms is a productive venture.

Chilly Bombers is the culmination of bad design, bad service and useless people all mixed together."}
{"text":"Had enough beer to think this was one of those hip, retro bars.

Platinum blonde indie girl spinning old-school gangster rap from 20 years ago...IRONICALLY. It's cool because you're superficial and don't expect her to play that. 

Bunch of guys repping Extreme Sports fashion like Monster Energy caps with their Ed Hardy shirts...IRONICALLY. It's cool because no one seriously wears that anymore, and it's a great throwback to simpler times. 

Not much for pastafarianism, I tried chilling out with my modern, 2010s clothes and music taste. Didn't fit in. But fear not! Chilly Bombers has some redeeming aesthetics. Like...the pretty lights (so bright!). Or the huge (and unfortunately vacant) dance floor. 

When I closed my eyes just long enough to stop the spinning, I envisioned how much cooler this bar could be if it tried to be a little more dive-y, and a little less of a refuge for people too broke or afraid of Hurricane Bay*. 

*I can't believe I just used HB as a favorable alternative to something."}
{"text":"This place rocks! If you want to chat a bit get there before 9pm...after that it starts to fill...and the dance floor starts to shake. Can't beat the $4 shots! Wait $4 for a shot?? Well these shots are a bunch of shots all in on BIG glass. Most drinks come with 3 shots some with five. Even the names are exciting like The Pornstar, The Purple Gatorade (UV Blue, Blue Curacao, Sweet and Sour, sprite, and Red Bull) and The Vegas. They get served like a shot or with some extra ice and some extra pucker or sweet n sour for a big drink! Tasty is the word, and a bit of a punch is the after. 

Don't like sweet, Jack Daniels can be your friend as well as a slew of vodka beverages. Lyndsey or Lance know how to make them all. There are even rumors of the occasional bar top dance.

The music has a beat and the video mixing is killer. There's even a special area for VIPs that has preemo bottle service. 

Oh and the place is open in the afternoons for a cold one, oh yeah.... and there is beer for those of you who may not like the harder stuff. And TVs to watch a few sports.

Pretty sure I will be back ..."}
{"text":"Bombers is my fav local bar. Jess, nugget, and Leanne are the best. I come during the day, and it's an awesome place for good food, and cheap happy hour drinks. Totally try it out!"}
{"text":"It probably looks better in the dark, but in broad daylight....ehh. 
Extension cords hanging out of the ceiling tiles and speaker wires poking out of holes in walls is not very professional IMO. In addition, some black painted plywood \"boxes\" maybe 1 foot high and 3 foot deep spanned almost the entire north wall. I can only imagine what these are actually for, but my only guess as to their true purpose is that they may be to dance on??? I guess I'll have to go back for more cheap drinks and to find out what these mystery boxes are. Dammit!

Service was very friendly and attentive, and the drink prices were definitely reasonably."}
{"text":"Went back after about year hiatus. It was a decent vibe for a MNF game. Met the owner who was a cool guy. They have 1.50 domestic bottles from 6-9pm, which I thought was killer. 

This is a small establishment abd I really dig the sports bar side, but not so much the club part on the weekends."}
{"text":"Awfull, chicken undercooked, bartender a got order messed up, there were 6 people in the place total, awful experience"}
{"text":"I dropped a few weeks ago, early on a Saturday evening and split prior to the place going all W/S disco (WESSSIDE!). The place certainly lacks charm, to say the least. You can tell that the daytime hours are just filler before the meat market, ho's/bro's auction begins. 

What I can say is that the food was surprisingly good. Just the typical bar fare but everything was super tasty; burgers, fries, mozzarella sticks, wings etc. were all great. They have no beer on tap but a decent selection of domestic, micro and import bottles. The service was very good as well. Can't say I'll be rushing to return, but I'd meet up for lunch at someones request just for the food."}
