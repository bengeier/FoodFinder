{"text":"THIS PLACE IS THE BEST. great service, amazing food, and a relaxed atmosphere. I still dream about their butter chicken. amazing!"}
{"text":"OK I ordered  food tonight and it was amazing as always but this  family  owend restaurant doesn't really care about customers honestly it only cares  about fucking profit and Im sick of not saying enything about it I literally just spent 15 mins sighng up to this bull shit so I could express my fycking feelings.honestly you order 80 dollars worth of food and you don't even get half a  half of chicken breast   per 12 doller dish I swear to godo  this is the last time we order from these fucking  scam artists theyreally don't give two shits about there customers they only want money.they are money hungery and don't even remotely give you what you pay for  so I honestly wouldn't bother unless your rich"}
{"text":"I just discovered this place this past year and it is now on my list of great takeout places.  Great to dine in as well.  Delicious, satisfying food and they will adjust then spice level to your taste.  I love the lamb vindaloo. Reasonably priced menu."}
{"text":"Lived in Little India, this is as good as best there. Not perfumey at all. Not fatty. Not full of artificial colours. Food is fresh and savoury and amazing. They deserve so many accolades. They are a treasure. The Baigan Bartha superb, Chicken Shakouti, tandooris and Biryanis all excellent. Can't go wrong trying everything there. We are long time customers and can't recommend more highly!!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here. Ordered delivery: butter chicken, eggplant dish, saag paneer. Delicious! I've been looking for a tasty Indian place which has been surprisingly difficult to find in the East end. Tried a number of places before here and won't order from anywhere else. We ordered 'hot' and they definitely don't lie about the spice. My mouth was on fire. I'll order medium next time, but I respect a chef who doesn't cater to us white folk and pussy around with the heat!"}
{"text":"It's ok but nothing special. Highs: none really. Mediums: the sauces are fine, had a bhuna, jalfrazie and vindaloo - nothing offensive but flavour are nothing to write home about. Lows: naan bread tasted like the frozen shop bought ones - not light or fluffy just kind of flat. The onion bajees are completely devoid of flavour and the tandoori chicken is smothered in some kind of weird sauce which was not even close to tandoori. Would only again if desperate, many better places just up the road on Gerrard Street East."}
{"text":"We waited 45min for our order, there was only one other couple in the place.   The couple two tables across from us were served and then flagged down the waitress five minutes later to say \"the food is great, but it is not what we ordered.\".  The waitress rushed the plates back; my friend and I watched them argue and point at us through the kitchen.   No less than a minute later \"our\" meal arrived, though it looked to have been spread a bit thin to compensate for the missing portions.   Suffice to say, they served us recycled food and didn't think twice about it.   Even if this was a one-off situation, they will never get my business again."}
{"text":"I would give this restaurant a 5star for there food but a 2 star for the portion of food you get for the price.i paid 68$ tonight and I barely got anything.there was no chicken or beef in the food.so disappointing. I order from here all the time and every time I tell them that I want more meat and they always say ok but they never listen.im fed up!!!! I'm not asking for more then I pay for !! I feel like I got ripped off. I called back and complained but I don't feel satisfied with the response I got. they just said next time they will give me more which I don't believe because every time I ask for more and get less it seems like.like I said good food but price is high for barely getting no food.its a shame.i will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"This is our #1 choice for Indian and delivery in the Beaches. 
The food tastes great and offers plenty of choices for vegetarians and meat eaters alike.
Nice people / friendly service, too."}
