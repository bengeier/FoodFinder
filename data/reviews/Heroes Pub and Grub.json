{"text":"I had no idea this place was here, but so glad we found it!

My parents were in town visiting, and we just wanted a beer and a snack after driving around town. We happened to find this place on yelp and decided to check it out. It was great! Very clean, great atmosphere, and with two great patios available for outdoor seating! We each had a couple of beers and shared one of the pizzas on the menu, which was delicious and flavorful. The bartender was very friendly.

It was the perfect place to spend a Saturday afternoon soaking up a little sun on the patio after many days of rain! SO glad to see a nice locally owned place, can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Great local spot it's not very big so the service is Always on point.  Happy hr pizza is 12 inches and $5 Can't beat it and it is Never too greasy, just right! Good beer selection as well.  A big window opens bringing the outside inside very nice."}
{"text":"This place is great! Awesome tribute to veterans and has a great vibe complete with comic book super heroes for the kids. Id highly recommend the breakfast burger if you're into eggs on your burger and the blue berry beer is surprisingly awesome. Kyle and Josh will likely be behind the bar when you get there. They're personable and a lot of fun. Scope heroes out!"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic... simple menu that satisfies!! Service is TOP NOTCH and the atmosphere is super laid back and exactly what I was looking for. Great place to watch sport... also, a local Notre Dame bar!

They honor \"heroes\"... Fire, Police, Military."}
{"text":"I love trying new foods and even foods that I have had in the past but am looking for a new twist on a traditional favorite.  Thors tots (cheese and bacon in a tot?!) are awesome and a great way to kick off your experience here.  Growing up in the mid-west we always had taco pizza.  This place has it!!  I don't think that I could have eaten the pizza faster than I did.  The service was great, environment is unique and fun and the food was delicious.  There is a great patio and coming into AZ beautiful weather I will be using it.  From the pictures provided by some, don't think that this place is only for super heros from the big screen.  \"Heros\" is also for fire, military, police, teachers, etc...  Its about time someone promotes those that so unsung far to many times!  LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"What great service.Good and different menu items.Certainely will be back for much more!"}
{"text":"Great place for Awesome pub food and cold beer!!! Our waitress was spot on. She had a giant party outside and still didn't miss a beat with us!! Their meatballs are homemade and so so good!!! Don't miss the tatertots too!!! Yumm!!!! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!!
Great wings! Finally hot means hot!
Ghost & apocalypse are great if you like them hot. Garlic Parmesan are great if you don't like them hot!
Great potato chips too!!
Favorite new place for wings. 
Sliders are great as well. 
Great to see a local place honoring our military members."}
{"text":"First time here.  Appetizers are unique and very tasty. Service is one of the friendliest places on Arizona.   We had the very delicious TOTS and Buffalo Egg Rolls."}
{"text":"Best Stromboli in town. Will definitely be back .  The staff were great even got to chat with the owner."}
{"text":"Was here for less than 3 hours and got charged for 7 beers.  There is no way I drank 7 beers.  I would be wasted on 7 beers.   Paid the bill, to avoid a disturbance with customers, but if they truly serve/over-serve this is may not the place to go.  Also, the beer supply did run out.  First they ran out of Ultra, then Rolling Rock, then Bud Light.   Had no options for a lighter beer when the kegs went dry.  Bartender said they don't have storage for kegs...."}
{"text":"I stopped in and had lunch before getting back to work and the bartender was friendly. I like their selection of beer and the pretzel fondue was good. I haven't tried the rest of the menu yet but I am giving them a try again for dinner. I hope this place makes it, I love the concept and will be back."}
{"text":"Man, what a sad disappointment.  Despite all the issues we had when dining here, we were still ready to give them support for trying.  But when we asked for our check and said we were leaving early, the owner came over, lectured us that it was our fault for not understanding their way of doing service, then she interrupted my wife and me while we were explaining the slow service , then she told the waiter to get our check, and stormed off while we were still talking.   

Um, a little hypersensitive on the owner's part.  And RUDE. 

The upshot: 
The Good:  location is good, a decent beer selection, TV in the bar area
The So-so:  menu is pretty limited - pizzas, burgers, and salads. A few other sandwiches like the Reuben, which i never received because of their nonexistant service. 
The Bad:  service is worse than the DMV. You'll wait.  You'll wait some more. And then you'll really wait.  No drinks. No appetizers.  No food. 
And when you call someone over to inquire as to whether they remember you, you'll get the owner to come over and berate you for not understanding. 

Save your money. Go next door or across the street, there are plenty of better, more friendly restaurants in Glendale that want your business."}
{"text":"This is a great bar. I come here to watch a lot of football and basketball games. Great beer selection, awesome rear patio and front patio with a garage door they open for you to sit right at the bar. Lots of TVs. The owner, Mike, always comes around and thanks us for our business. He's an old vet that just loves to welcome everyone. Food is good, beers are great, service is fantastic."}
{"text":"Ate here and watched the NCAA basketball tourney games while in town visiting family. Plenty of TVs, great food, with a cool-vibe yet family-friendly atmosphere. Definitely a tried and true neighborhood establishment. If you like wings, the Sriracha Honey wings are seriously out of this world. The wing size is right-on and they are cooked/seasoned perfectly. If you are up for something different, there is a \"build your own\" option on paninis and pizzas, which is cool. Coming from a family of veterans, I also thought it was cool that they take the \"Heroes\" theme beyond decorations (which are cool on their own, btw). I'm told they even source their house vodka (not ironically called Heroes Vodka) from a veteran-owned company. Will definitely come back next time I'm in town! I'm a big fitness guy, so I look forward to riding my bike on the Skunk Creek Trail and dropping in for a beer (lots of local and interesting stuff on tap)!"}
{"text":"Nope- this is not a good pick. Look for something else. I know it's close to large organizations...travel a little further and save some money and have better food. 

The service was fair and Spidey hanging from the rafters was cool but not enough to pull this restaurant above a one star rating. 

Ordered wings, at a dollar a wing, they should be sprctacular (10/$10). Placed our order and about 25 minutes later a pizza platter came out with my wing combo, parm/garlic and the hot sauce/BBQ. The minute they hit the table, I could smell cigarette smoke. Gross. Obviously someone preparing the food or near the food went for a cig. The second major faux pas, the wings were not hot. In fact portions of the wings were even cold. The wings perhaps were warmed under a broiler or in a pan, but they were not piping hot as one would expect wings that are newly fried. I couldn't get myself to eat the wings, I pawned my food off on a co-worker.

Expensive and the food was just gross."}
{"text":"First time here and won't be the last! Great food and atmosphere! We had the honey Sriracha wings, fries and sliders-- Mmhmm !!! The manager greeted us and was such an awesome guy! Loved it and love having a place like this in our area!"}
{"text":"Slow service. I ordered the beer cheese burger, bun was cold because it was previously Frozen and burger was over cooked. Owner was walking around and didn't ask about the service. Server brought empty ketchup bottle to the table, just rookie mistakes not coming back"}
{"text":"Chicken and waffle boneless wings are amazing and the taco pizza is Our kids loved it. Owner came to our table to thank us for coming in."}
{"text":"I have given this place numerous chances and they just dont cut it! Last 3 times there were thick lipstick on my shot and beer glasses. Food and attitude from staff is raunchy. My last encounter I had the barbeque chicken pizza which was totally dry and had a few peices of frozen chicken (high school cafeteria food is way better).I also had another glass with lipstick on it and the arrogant bar tender said \"sorry bro\". I told him the pizza was not good, and he said \"sorry bro\". I wish I could rate this joke of a restaurant better because I am a local and truly want to see local establishments suceed, but this place truly sucks....its only good for beer."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best places I've eaten at in a while, great location, beer super cold, food amazing! (Try the bbq chicken pizza),and service was top notch. Family friendly and locally owned. Its a must try!"}
{"text":"Neat neighborhood place. Angus Sliders yesterday were great, bartenders and staff really cool and the owner makes you feel at home. If you live in the area, make sure and support them!!! We need a place like this in the Arrowhead area."}
{"text":"Simply the best staff.   Go more than once and they remember you.  Kelsey,  Josh and Chad know my beer tastes, and bring me new things to try constantly.   I have not tried a bad thing on the menu yet.   It's the little neighborhood bar and eats you've been looking for. Try it you won't regret it."}
{"text":"Heroes is a great small local bar and grill.

The services was excellent,everyone in there was very friendly and inviting.  The food came out fast and was very good!"}
{"text":"Always a pleasure coming to this place! Food is good, the beer is cold! Mike the owner is always a delight -- brings a joyful conversation and warm welcome! The atmosphere is so fun! Bringing out the hero in all of us!! Will continue to come back again and again!"}
{"text":"I have to give this place 5 stars. My coworker and I have been looking for a cool place to come when we need a drink after work and I think we found it. The service was awesome, the wings were incredible, and Kyle the bartender not only made great recommendations but his witty banter was enjoyable as well. One of the owners, Mike, even stopped by to say hello. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"New little pub spot in north west Phoenix- land of chain restaurants only!  On a weekday my mom and I stop in for a late lunch.

You write your name and circle the food options... No wine menu?  Weird drink selection still in progress.  This new business mustn't underestimate the westsiders wish to get their drank on.

The Parmesan garlic wings were crispy but not overwhelmingly garlic. If I did not know the name of this dish, I would not pick garlic as the first flavor.  Yes I can see pieces of minced garlic but the flavor is not there.  Served with ranch & celery on a pizza tray... Big whoop. 

The pizza was some chiche \"fun\" name like the big kahuna or Chattanooga... Basically salami, pepperoni, pancetta.  Immediately it arrives looking greasy but we aren't scared to eat it.  As we dig in I realize it's all just slightly undercooked.

When a mature gentleman asks how everything is, I share this feedback that the food could be warmer.  We also share this with our server who is quite nice but not overly knowledgeable.

We are hoping to find a neighborhood spot with a little more flavor and attention to detail."}
{"text":"We came here for lunch and to watch football on Sunday afternoon. This place has really good food, great local beers, and Sunday NFL ticket with lots of TVs! I definitely would recommend Heroes to anyone looking for football, a good Bloody Mary bar, and a great meal! We would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Paid my first visit to this place today for lunch. Food was rock-solid. Thor's (house-made tater) Tots stood out, along with the hardworking owners we met. Sarah and Mike; it was a pleasure. Thank you for your genuine hospitality. Looking forward to sampling more of your chow and chewing the fat again soon. Keep up the good work, and a big salute to your honoring those who've served us militarily and in civil capacities through your business model."}
{"text":"First timers to a local business...always support the locals . Also loves there there is a Purple Heart parking spot outside!

We started with the Thor tots.  These were a very good and simple appetizer!  I got the sliders, paid a little extra to try all 4 and we got the taco pizza!  Food was awesome!!  Pizza was amazing!  The burger and chicken sliders were my favo

We will be back for sure!!  This is a great place."}
{"text":"Update:

The owner messaged me and told me to call him about this. I did. This ended up as a conversation about him defending Kelly and that she's working on performing better (she's also the best worker at this location apparently). The conversation ended poorly. Kat doesn't work there anymore and she was one of the best servers I've ever met. 

Now I got no reason to come back! 

------------------

KAT IS AMAZING! The two times we've come in, we've been a big group, and have had Kat both times as our server. She is so fun, checks up on us consistently, and seems to be very genuine with us. We will definitely be coming back for her! Without her, I would be giving this place 2 stars for service. 

One star off because we came in today and our server started off as a woman named Kelly. The night began normally and she got us our drinks. Then it took almost an hour to see her again. We tried to get her attention while she was taking 5 minutes to wash a glass behind a bar, and she saw us but proceeded to walk away!

Keep in mind we've only had one round of drinks and water. She didn't even take our order for food or another round. 

However, she did seat us in the back patio so there would be more room - which was nice. BUT WE STILL WEREN'T GETTING SERVED. 

After a while, I went to talk to her behind the bar, and told her if we weren't getting served, we were going to pay and leave. She then proceeded to throw attitude at me saying that we came in as a big group without a reservation. I get it, but there was PLENTY of room for all these people. MANY BOOTHS WERE EMPTY, KELLY. There were 3 big groups from what I observed. We were a group of 11. We had servers and a bartender in our group too, so they understand the struggle of balancing it all. Even  were also getting pretty fed up from the wait, and didn't understand what was going on. 
There was no need for attitude from Kelly, but that's what I got! 

BUT THEN we ended up with Kat, so all is good! 

TL;DR - Kat is amazing, and Kelly really ruined my night!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have visited twice so far.
Our first experience was awesome!
The bartender was fantastic and very knowledgeable.
We shared the mushroom - swiss burger with the house made chips, 
Cook on the burger was perfect and we loved the chips dipped in ranch.
We took a pizza home with us which wasn't great honestly, but we're kind of pizza Nazis.
On our 2nd visit the same great bartender helped us and the service was stellar.
We again ordered the same burger & house chips which was quite dissapointing.
The burger was overdone and the chips were replaced twice due to undercooking. They were stuck together and unbearably greasy due to the lack of agitation while in the fryer.
I used the restroom and noticed the cook behind the line was not one of the owner's as our last visit but a kid who looked 12.
We will definitely be back but consistency is key in getting us to order food again."}
{"text":"My friends and I came here post Spartan race so you can imagine how dirty we were. Luckily, it was between rush hours so it wasn't packed and they still didn't turn us away. That was one of our biggest concerns. We absolutely love the \"heroes\" theme at the restaurant. Marvel characters to real life heroes such as fire fighters were displayed proudly throughout the place. Their service was good... friendly and attentive. We had their wings and pizza. The wings were surprisingly crispy and flavored well. Pizza was good, too."}
{"text":"Heroes Pub and Grub is a happy revelation. I hadn't heard of the place until yesterday. Jim, Twyla and I headed out to meet an old friend and the evening turned out to be one of our better ones recently. Themed around our service men and women, Heroes is laid back and feels like a place you'd frequent regularly. 

The owner is a former Army Ranger who takes the time to come around, get to know the patrons and generally make you feel welcome. There is a wall near the entrance on which are written hundreds of names of folks who've served in the military and in law enforcement and fire, I believe. While settling in and deciding on food, a booming voice called for everyone's attention. This is a regular occurrence and a pleasant one: he takes the time to honor any service member who happens to be there, they sign the wall and have their photo taken by the owner. The whole place breaks into applause and you go back about your meal. It's a really nice thing to be present for. 

For myself, I ordered the Turkey Pita Club which consists of shaved turkey breast, red onions, tomatoes, pepperoncinis, cheddar and pepper jack, spring mix, bacon and garlic chipotle aioli on pita bread ( I'm stealing this all from the menu ).  This comes along with a side of fries and was, frankly, pretty outstanding. I'll certainly be having it again. There's a pretty good selection of craft beers, many local brews. I had both the Heroes Lager and the Honor Golden Ale. Now, I'm not really a beer guy, but I can say I liked both brews quite a bit. You can also choose from various burgers, specialty pizzas, salads and appetizers. 

The ambiance of Heroes Pub and Grub is both casual and unique in turns. There are various military memorabilia on the walls, including the owner's various decorations. In addition there's a fun Super Hero theme going on: Spiderman hangs upside down from the ceiling; The restroom doors are adorned with, respectively, Wonder Woman and Superman. Throughout are several comic-themed prints. Pretty cool. 

Heroes Pub and Grub will definitely be a regular spot for me from now on. Non pretentious, great staff that's friendly and happy and just a good atmosphere.

{"text":"I really enjoy this bar! the tots are delicious beer is good and great prices. The owner is super friendly and always says hi!"}
{"text":"Heros is amazing. The Monte cristo is so good, I had 3. Also the toco pizza is amazing."}
{"text":"Love this bar! Owner and host were a 10, out server was great and the Taco Pizzato die for! Perfect local bar, and when then get the TV outside they will be the best place in town!"}
{"text":"This is a neighborhood bar that just opened near where I live. I stopped in when they opened on Labor Day and I was the only one there (no surprise - it is a holiday). I was greeted by Chad, co-owner and bartender. He was awesome and very knowledgeable about all the local, craft beers they have on tap, which change seasonally. The menu had a large selection and there are lunch & happy hour specials available. I ordered the Scottsdale Blonde on draught and a personal pepperoni and mushroom pizza. Chad and I had a lengthy convo about supporting local business which he said, as a business owner, he tries to do as well. Food was great, beer was great, ambience was great. He mentioned they will start opening early for football season. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I took my husband and kids there last night for dinner. This place is awesome! Dedicated to our veterans and decorated with superheroes this place is awesome. Mike the owner is so nice, he stopped by our table and thanked us for coming in. Our server Kyle was so excellent with his hospitality. I will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"Just happened to hit Heroes on their grand opening so the place was packed! We had a brief wait for a table but just a few minutes. The service was quick, friendly and efficient. We ordered Thor's Tots for an app and they were great! Absolute deliciousness!! We also split the taco pizza which was very good. The crust was done just right and it was topped with taco chips! The beer was cold and the cocktails were not short on alcohol. The west side has needed a good pub for a while and this is a very good option! We will be back frequently!"}
{"text":"LOVE THIS PLACE! Great food and friendly faces. And beer! Who doesn't love beer?! 

It's everything a neighborhood bar should be, great beer, great service, and even better food. 

The staff is beyond welcoming, the beer list includes local favorites, and the menu is literally as good as it looks. 

I have celebrated birthdays here and drank away sorrows when I didn't get accepted into a school, all while munching their food and drinking my fave Big Blue Van. 

We love it here, and you will too! 

**Get the chicken sliders, pork tenderloin, and the hero gold wings, they're my fave**"}
{"text":"My husband and I like to support our local businesses and community so we decided to try Heroes Pub. The service was great and the owner Mike stopped by the table to make sure everything was to our liking. Mike explained the theme of their place, honoring local heroes serving our community and a bit of fun for families with the marvel heroes in the dining room. My grandson would have loved Spider-Man hanging from the rafters. 
The food was great. We had the wings and pizza with a couple beers from the Happy Hour menu just to give it a try and were pleasantly surprised.  The pizza had just the right amount of crispness from the brick oven and super cheesy! The hero gold wings had a great flavor. Beer selection was great too. We intend to stop by again soon."}
{"text":"First, outside there's a \"Purple Heart\" only parking space. Have never seen that before, so kudos to them! Great local place that values our local heroes - veterans, first responders, nurses, etc. 

Owner came around and talked with us for a while. Great guy. Got a few solid menu recommendations, which we chose, and we're very happy with. 

Sriracha wings, Thor's tots and taco pizza were delicious. I'm super, super picky about ground beef and almost never eat taco meat, but it looked and smelled so good I had to try it. Two pieces, just to be sure. Definitely a must have. We also had a burger, pretzel sticks and Stromboli - all good. They also carry a decent amount of local craft beers on tap and rotate them periodically. 

Will return!"}
{"text":"Went there to meet a bunch of friends who I hadn't seen in a long time wasn't surprised to find the food was great and prices were reasonable. I suggest this place it's a family oriented restaurant. I will be bringing mine back for sure."}
{"text":"We went there the other night to watch a basketball game. We were pleasantly surprised at the crowd. Nice beer and drink selection. They had one waitress working the bar inside and out. She was trying but wasn't very attentive. We kept having to stop her for drinks and refills. Unfortunately, the  food wasn't very good either.  We ordered the sliders and were disappointed in the lack of flavor. Not sure if we would go back."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks! Owner is always friendly and remembers you after one visit; very willing to talk and share the story of his restaurant. 
A must is the blueberry mule if you are a fan of Moscow mules! Friends have gotten the pizzas and really enjoyed as well as a good variety of local brews. The burgers are great, as are the pretzels and Thor tots."}
{"text":"Unique menu with great food. Good beer, wings, burgers and Thor tots. We met Mike, the owner and talked awhile. He's a decorated Vietnam vet, Army Ranger, 3 time recipient of the Purple Heart and earned a couple of Bronze Stars. We will be going back often."}
{"text":"Not a bad place, decent selection of Arizona beers and the wings were not bad either, however the price is a bit much for the serving size. $10.50 for 10 wings... c'mon."}
{"text":"My boys and I were up in the area recently for a Boy Scout activity and stopped in here after for a bite to eat. I was happy to see that the theme isn't just fictional Superheroes, but that they also recognize our real everyday heroes in the military, police and firefighters.

Of course the theme would be worthless if the food wasn't good, but it was excellent. I had the beer cheese burger on a pretzel bun, while my boys went for a mushroom burger and a classic burger. Service was fast and friendly and the food was delicious. No pre-made, warmed-up bar food here! You could tell that everything was cooked in-house and that thought had been put into the menu.

If I lived in the area, Heroes would be a regular hangout for me. Good food, great service and they support a great cause! Definitely a place to check out."}
{"text":"Great service! Loved the jalapeño margarita!  Pita club was great and the buffalo wings were just spicy enough!  

Get the fried pickles!"}
{"text":"Hate to give 2 stars but just went in for second time after moving nearby. Love the place and atmosphere and my boys love the Heros theme. Unfortunately both times , we had bad and slow service. We enjoy the food but takes way to long to get it. First time in , there was like 2 other tables and today there was maybe 4. Only one bartender/server, and she was super slow. The multi tasking needs to be picked up a notch. We wanted some cocktails but ended up having one, by the time she came to check on our empty glasses it had been about 15 mins and we were ready for the check. Our tab could have been racked up a little higher if we were paid attention to. The owner was friendly and came by to interact with my little man. So not sure if we will be back. Like the place, like the food but but he times the service was slacking bad . Enough to where I wouldn't want to wait again. Sorry but not sorry"}
{"text":"Fantastic back patio. Get the sliders!! The owner is a retired marine and is helping his son get this place up and going."}
{"text":"Pizza was great and the service was outstanding. My six and and nine year old sons have a new favorite place."}
{"text":"I found this place near my house and got excited to have a place that honors those that serve. I am a Navy veteran and I am proud of all the men and women that have served in the armed forces as well as police and firemen. I stopped for lunch and enjoyed a burger (ok) and beer. i went home and told my wife that I found a great place near the house.

We order dinner later that day and that is where things went south. We ordered wings and tots and one other item (I can't recall). They were way over fried and very tough, we ate most of it because we were hungry. It was already late so we did not call the restaurant to complain, because I did not want them to offer to remake the order. I did however  send a message on the website about our experience, also explaining that I did not intend to go on social media about my experience. I never received a reply from anyone at the restaurant, and it has bothered me for while. I feel if someone takes the time to reach out to you about your business, you then should take the time to reply. Therefore my 2-star rating reflects the quality of food and the lack of customer service that I experienced."}
{"text":"The pizza and wings were really great. The only thing that kept my review from a 5-star rating is that they only offer one size of pizza. We wanted a larger pie than they offer. They have local craft beer on tap, which is nice."}
{"text":"Heroes is a great local bar.  

What really sealed the deal with me was the owner.  I've been here about 5 times and every time I go there he comes up to see how everything is going.  He is also a vet which just makes it even better.  The fact that going there supports a vet and not some corporate conglomerate makes me happy.

Now in regards to the food and drinks.  Everything I have eaten here is great.  I especially recommend the Chicken & Waffle Wings.  Man they are good.  

The draft beers are great and there is a great selection to choose from.

My only complaint would be that the Happy Hour isn't anything special.  $1 off appetizers isn't really a draw."}
{"text":"This is a great sports bar- pizza joint to bring the kids to. The superhero theme went over great with the kids and my husband had a sub and loved it , while my kids had the taco pizza. Great place for the entire family ."}
{"text":"This place is just plain fantastic. The atmosphere is always inviting. The staff is friendly and it always feels like you are among friends. The owner is amazing, and truly a hero. I love how this place is so dedicated to the military and those in public service and saluting all of the selfless things they do. 

The food is spectacular. Great pizzas, burgers and salads. Highly recommend the Thor's tots! Also, wonderful bartenders and drinks. Lots of microbrews and local stuff. 

5 stars every time. Never a disappointment."}

{"text":"Went here with a large group, nice place and atmosphere,  enjoyed the food, service and price."}
{"text":"Love this place. Found it a couple weeks ago and have been 5 times now. Great prices (especially during happy hour) and amazing food. A full size pizza is only $5 during happy hour and is the best restaurant (non-pizza chain) pizza I've had. The service is awesome, they remember my name every time."}
{"text":"Had a great Happy Hour visit. Good beer selection and excellent wings.  The Monte Cristo was only above average.  The layout was welcoming with an outside patio. Service was outstanding and will have me returning soon"}
{"text":"Very good!  Tried the \"Thor Tots\" appetizer, and they were delicious!   The Blueberry Mule drink was amazing as well.   My fiancé and I shared a burger, and it was very good as well.  We'll be back!   Good service from Santiago."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great food and super friendly staff! The owner is always walking around thanking people for coming and it just makes you feel that much better when you come in, as if the tots, pizza and cold beer weren't enough! We've had the Thor tots, the cowabunga and the barbecue pizza and weren't disappointed in any of it! They have a nice patio and a great beer selection. Great place to grab a bite with the family or to start a night out!"}
{"text":"My gal and I tried out Heroes Pub & Grub for dinner for the first time yesterday, we were very pleasantly surprised!  We just had pizza and wings, and holy crap both were delicious.  We met the owner (Mike), really nice guy... turns out he's an extremely decorated military veteran to boot!  Totally sold on this place"}
{"text":"We tried it for the 1st time last friday, the wings were great!  The White pizza was a disappointment though.  We always loved the white pizza from Bravi and Stella 59 (the two names that were previously in this location).   I was excited to see the White pizza was still on the menu.  It tasted terrible....had a strange flavored paste dropped on it and no cheese that I could see or taste...and real strong pieces of garlic..and the crust didn't seem quite done.  We will try something else next time.  Maybe they could get the recipe from Bravi or Stella 59!"}
{"text":"I think the best thing out of the experience there was the Diet Coke I opted to drink. My companions ordered different flavors of wings and we were highly disappointed. The wings were not exactly the best flavor and very very greasy. It also did not help that the wings were not practically priced. Felt nauseated after eating two of them. The waitress was friendly but it did take her a long time to even refill a drink. Not as attentive as I would have liked. Additionally I don't think they were expecting customers considering the trash can in the bathroom did not even have a bag. Overall, would not return"}
{"text":"Nice dog friendly patio and excellent selection of craft beers! Neighborhood crowd and the staff is great."}
{"text":"Awesome place to have some beers and good food. Everyone is friendly and the food is delicious.  The owner came up to me and thanked me for coming, also asked if I was a between (which I'm not) but I think it's cool that they honor those who serve. They have a whole wall dedicated to those in the military. If you're looking for a great vibe and great food definitely check this place out. Try the wings and pizza. So delicious"}
{"text":"Such a great local place. Food and drinks are fantastic. Staff is caring and personable!!!! The TOTS are lit and taco pizza is bangin. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after seeing this place on Yelp. Food was excellent and beer was cold! Love the heroes theme and one co-owner served in Vietnam and is Purple Heart recipient x 3! Always stand for our military and first responders! Will definitely be back for taco Tuesday and fish fry Friday! Modern decor, very clean and has outside seating as well. Overall awesome neighborhood pub!"}

On our first visit, the owner came by and introduced himself and told us a little about the backstory of this restaurant. He is a veteran who supports other veterans and this country, which automatically made us like the restaurant. What we weren't expecting was the amazing quality of food and drinks! Ever since then, we have come back and ordered take-out numerous times.
To start, we will usually order either the Thor's tots or warm pretzels with beer cheese. You really can't go wrong with either one. We both love the turkey pita (which is enough food for dinner and next day's lunch!). The fries that come on the side are amazing. We have also tried the Arizona burger and the Hang Loose burger, both of which are great. We will definitely keep returning to this place!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Always friendly staff, great cold craft beer with awesome choices. Every choice we've made on several occasions of their menu we have enjoyed every bite! Thor's Tots are one of our favs!"}
{"text":"Dear Yelp,
I never thought this would happen to me, but true story..
My husband and I went out for a casual early evening.  well, one thing led to another and we chose Heroes to try for the first time. 
Our experience was flawless!  Choirs of angels...
The real:
Beer, yummy. Food, YUMMY.  Bartender, Josh, A+
Freak' n raspberry wheat, Big Blue Bus blueberry wheat both excellent, as were Hefe and the other beer my husband had, which I can't remember now.  It was good, though. 
Sliders and pretzels both really good"}
{"text":"Heroes came to the rescue!  To rescue us West Siders with their Modern Pub that we have been so desperately in need of. 

Walking up you see a cute little patio and Bar that opens up to the restaurant. We sat on the inside part of the bar facing out to the patio. I love these kinds bars that open up to the outside. They are perfect for AZ. They also have high tops in the bar area that lead in to a dinning room, where you will find a giant Spiderman hanging from the ceiling. The dinning room opens up to an open kitchen so you can see the chef's creating your entree's and appetizers. And attached to the dinning room is a side patio with a game of corn-hole. You will find all kinds of Heroes décor. From Pat Tillman's Jersey on the wall, to statues of not only Comic Book heroes, but real heroes like Policeman, Fireman, and Military.  Pretty unique experience. 

Sitting up at the bar we were handed a small menu. They have a some craft beers, wine, and spirits. Happy Hour from 3-6 even on the weekends. We were there for a drink and some appetizers. My husband got a beer (Big Blue Van) and I got the Bloody Marry. Bloody Marry was the only thing that left me with something to be desired. But everything else was spot on. We got the Heroes Siracha Honey Wings. and the House Made Thor's Tot's. The wings were some of the best wings I have ever had. Just the way I like them. They were crunch and large, they were not drowned in sauce. You could pick up the sweet, tangy sauce with every bite. No need for ranch. They were delicious. The Thor Tot's were also large and crunchy. You can tell that they were made from scratch. I think the plating of both items could have been done on much smaller plates, but that is just a personal opinion. 

Our bartender got very busy, so the owner stepped in and helped out a lot. He sat people, took orders, served food/drinks, and made sure all the customers were happy. The bartender and the owner were both attentive, nice, fun guys. 

So happy to see this place packed with people on a random Saturday afternoon already. I think this place can make it. The small menu I think is perfect. It offers just the right amount of options. Burgers, a few Pizzas, sandwiches, Salads, a fun hot dog, Create your own Panini's, and Appetizers. I'm looking forward to brining some friends and trying some more of their creative food items like the Krypto Dog. bacon wrapped, sriacha mustard, onions, sport peppers, feta cheese, tomatoes and celery salt. Sounds pretty interesting. We will be seeing you soon Heroes!!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Bartenders are really cool guys. Menu is small but makes the decisions easy. I love the wings! Great choice. I have not gotten the owners full story but seeing him inside the restaurant every now and then is awesome. I think he was awarded Purple Hearts in the military. One of the time he asked for everyone's attention to honor a family eating there who had 3 generations of military members present. So awesome!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  They have a fun atmosphere and very neat and clean.  We had the meatballs and the Thor Tots, they were both amazing!  I love that Mike (owner) came to our table to greet us and see how we were doing.  I told him the food was amazing and he told us of all the efforts he puts in to making it amazing!  Fresh ingredients and time, the Thor tots alone take over 6 hours to make, I love recipes like that.  Mike you are awesome!! Keep doing what you do,  we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! 

Staff: Friendly greeting right away, immediate assistance in getting our little one settled with a high chair, and a personal hello from the owner. The waitress was nice and attentive.

Cleanliness: Spotless! Everything was neat and orderly. 

Atmosphere: Fun but also patriotic! From the Spiderman hanging from the ceiling to the Honor Wall, this is definitely a place for heroes and those who love them.

Food: Delicious! The Thor Tots are a must for anyone trying this place. I had the beer cheese burger.. so flavorful and cooked perfectly! The fries were some of the best I have had in a long time. My husband had the AZ burger and sweet potato fries- all of which was also delicious. They have kid friendly meals too- my son was definitely full & happy."}
{"text":"Love this place ! Stopped by after looking for some good food places on Yelp. Yelp never disappoints ! The place is so rad inside with the cool super hero theme . Also the food was so amazing as well so it was a double win! The Siracha honey wings were the best wings I've had in my entire life . Everything was fresh ! Mike was super awesome and so was the bartender who shared his love for pugs with us ! Thank you guys for an amazing lunch and we will totally be regulars now ! We can't wait to go back !"}
{"text":"Oh how the mighty have fallen. This place used to be great. I was here a few months ago and it was bad but I decided to give it one now chance...that was my mistake. This is the second time I have been here and ordered something only to have it delivered to my table not matching the description on the menu. Both times I have received the response from the server saying,\" oh we don't have that anymore\". Please correct the menu and stop doing this. My husband then got his hamburger which was charred beyond belief. I'm assuming it was the owner who came over to apologize about his burger which I thought was great until he proceeded to start an argument with my husband saying that he will take the burger off the bill but it was done medium well. My husband insisted that it was far over well done and then the owner went and got the sent back burger and proceeded to pull it apart to argue with how it was done. I have worked in restaurants both front of the house and back of the house and I was appalled at this. After this the table next to us came over to say they had an awful experience and they won't be back either. On a side note our server was polite and gracious and I feel bad she had to deal with this. I'm sad we used to love it here but we won't be back."}
{"text":"Went here for the 1st time tonight and I must say this place is AWESOME! The food was on point, me and the wife each had the Classic burger and our two sons had the pepperoni pizza. Everything was fresh,hot, and delicious and their prices are wont put you in the poor house! The staff was very friendly and our waiter was especially nice to our kids and helped choose the right meal. We will be coming here regularly!"}
{"text":"Great hidden gem on 59th and union, the good is good, the atmosphere is even better. It has a superhero / real hero theme to it. If you've ever served in the military, police or fire and rescue you can have your name put up on the hero wall and the owner is a Vietnam vet with stories for days. Great place to take the family for pizza and burgers. The cowabunga is my favorite pizza!"}
{"text":"We never tried this place before and we are glad we did. We got the Cowabanga and the garlic Parmesan hero wings and they were amazing. It's a great place to go and have a few drinks with great food."}
{"text":"Love the Pizza! Doesn't matter which one you order they are all amazing! We Have been here a couple times now and the food is always good, the service gets a little slow when they are busy but it's worth the wait! The taco pizza and the homemade tater tots are my favorite! They are super kid friendly and always so nice. I would recommend this place to anyone who is down for good food in an easy going environment."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Everyone from the owner on down is very friendly and very cool and the beer selection is great. Nice, relaxing atmosphere and a nice ambience."}
{"text":"got some wings togo ...was today's chef didn't care for the wings? It was WAY TO SALTY... :( my first time trying after reading the reviews from yelpers...disappointed.. ;( i am so angry, if i was at the restaurant, i would have sent it BACK. sorry. it is HORRIBLE. i can only imagine how the salt and vinegar flavor would taste like. these are unedible. i took 2 wings. at first bite i was like \"first maybe\". 2nd definitely \"not good.\" i feel unhealthy ..."}
{"text":"Def 5 stars. Quick service, great food, and great staff!
I recommend the white pizza and the Hawaiian wings. The wings were sweet and savory! Perfect!"}
{"text":"Had a great lunch at this place with my fiancé. Highlights from the menu were the Thor tots, chicken wings with sriracha honey and the krypto-dog. Server was friendly and the bartender Josh was great too. Josh apparently knows magic and is not afraid to show off his skills, when asked. We will be back for sure after the official grand opening, especially to see more magic tricks! :) 
Dessert?"}
{"text":"Awesome vibe. Vet appreciation is great. Tjw Hawaii wings and the variety of beers on tap."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time, josh was my bartender. He was super nice and took good care of us. Local beers, food looked good. Will be returning"}
{"text":"I liked the decor, it was very clean and the waitress was friendly.  The food....mediocre.  My husband got a burger ($12) and it was dry and overcooked, the waitress did not ask him how he wanted it cooked, so I guess he got well done.  I would make sure to ask for medium or medium well next time.  I got the taco pizza, the bottom was burnt beyond being edible.  She asked if I wanted a box and I said no thanks, it is too burnt.  They offered to remake it and I said no thanks, so they took it off the bill.  The manager never came over, it was the waitress that gave us the credit and apologized.  The cook, who I think may have been the manager spent most of his time on his cell phone.  Not a great experience, but we may go back and try it again."}
{"text":"Saw this place for the first time and stopped for lunch today. Nice modern pub with a full bar. Was about 12:30 and was a little surprised that I was one of only four people there at that time. Sat at the bar and was given a menu card which I found out was an order card that I had to fill out what I wanted. Kind of nice that most items were \"build your own\" so I checked off cheese burger with American cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion and pickles and a side salad. Service was quick and pleasant (Sarah). 

Couple of things though: 

-Salad and burger came at the same time which I would have liked the salad before, but that's a personal preference. 

-Salad was a standard premade sitting in the fridge salad consisting of chopped Iceberg lettuce, couple of sliced cucumbers and three cherry tomatoes. Dressing (Italian) was glob like a heavy syrup and was pretty much tasteless.

-Burger was tasty, but a little challenging to eat. Lettuce was the same chopped stuff that was in the salad and way too much which didn't stay in the burger. The pickles on the burger were crisp, but in the form of spears (two) not chips which meant I either had a mouth full of pickle or none at all. 

Most other reviews seem to rave about this place so I will have to go back and give them a another try. Maybe the pizzas are better."}
{"text":"Just OK.. that is the BEST I can say.. It was clean and easy to find. The wings were cooked correctly but just ok. The drinks were $8 and were not very good. There was only flavored beers on tap. I want my beer to taste like beer. Not blueberry... The waitress was VERY slow and inattentive. The \"owner\" or so I thought was not attentive to us either. We will not be back. The tater tots that everyone raves over..were again.. Just ok. I guess that's all. Nothing to talk about/ Nothing to go back for."}
{"text":"I wish I could give negative stars. I've been coming to heroes on off for a few months and have never had a bad experience until tonight. The bartender Kyle I believe is his name, gave my self and my friend horrible attitude the entire evening all because we have two large dogs and we're sitting on their \"dog friendly\" patio. He continuously shook his head every time we asked for anything even plates, silverware. Coming from a customer service background I feel completely disrespected. Not to mention one of the partners, I believe his name was David was just as displeasing to speak with. Chad the other parter has way more people skills. Not to mention they are also continuously out of products to make the items on their menu. They also complete messed up our orders. I feel discriminated because I have a dog, which the parter David made sure to tell me was not a \"child\". If you are a pet owner and believe that your animal is your child this is not a place you should come to."}
{"text":"Things have really taken a turn for the worst here. I wrote them an excellent review a year & a half ago but it all gets worse each time we've gone. We've finally decided to take it off our lists of places to eat. The prices have raised several times & they must have a new cook because the food isn't half as good as it used to be, specifically the pizza & burgers. I also feel a lot of tension & attitude from some of the staff (actually not staff, just the owners)."}
{"text":"Some of the best pub food we have ever had.  

Siracha honey wings were incredibly flavorful!

Thors Tots - awesome appetizer 

Braut sliders we great on a preztl roll

Taco pizza - our kids favorite.

Guinness and Oak Street on tap!  This is a GREAT spot"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Recieved a hero's welcome here. The owner came out and gave a tribute to veterans and asked me and the others there to sign their hero wall. A very hometown kinda of place. The taco pizza was also pretty good. Otherwise your traditional sports bar food."}
{"text":"Good place, friendly staff and owner. Food was tasty and lots of beer choices. Just needs more Tv's in dining area."}
{"text":"So, not only is the food WAY Better than i thought coming in, the owner is one of the nicest people I have met.  We sat and talked for 10 or more minutes. Then i watched him walk back in the kitchen to get things moving.

Pros:  
The food is all scratch cooked.  (The tater tots are to dye for!!)
There are several items on the menu that have flavors to surprise.
Clean, nice atmosphere
Parking for Wounded Vets and a wall for all vets to sign!  I absolutely love that he stays true to his roots and honors our service members!
Friendly Service

Cons
the 2 times i have been there, service and food can be a bit slow but nothing terrible
The burgers are cooked to DEAD AS A DOOR NAIL Nuclear without asking
.....thats it.

I have  a new go to place for the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"OH MY YES! Best Wings in all of Arizona EVER! Customer service is awesome! Everything about this place is great! The heroes gold sauce is a winner forsure. Recommend To Everyone!"}
{"text":"Here is a chill, neighborhood joint, that is a good option to grab a very good beer and enjoy the atmosphere. Heroes Pub & Grub is located on the northwest corner of 59th Avenue and Union Hills Drive. It's in a nice retail center that makes the most of a small parcel of land. It's also been home to some nice restaurants and shops over the years.

I was introduced to Heroes while hanging out with a friend who was already familiar with this establishment. The theme is a clever mix of super heroes and honoring our everyday heroes (military, police & fire). And yes, there is a nearly full size Spider Man hanging from the ceiling! It turns the bar atmosphere into a family friendly kind of place.

Unfortunately, the food wasn't sampled today. Fortunately, the beers on hand really good! The local variety and the styles on hand are impressive. My Barrio Rojo (from Tucson) was delicious as always! Plus, the service provided by Josh and Bryce was excellent.

The pub was enjoyable. Next time, I want to sample the grub. Heroes is definitely on my return list!"}
{"text":"At the time of this review Hero's Pub & Grub is a newly opened restaurant that is still in the process of tweaking things and the menu.

This is a \"Hero\" themed Pub that has a life size Spiderman hanging from the ceiling and the walls are decorated with sports heroes and movie hero's.

At the time of this review the menu is on a card and you circle what you want to order. Then your server picks up your card and runs it to the kitchen.

The menu offers some appetizers, build your panini, pizza, hotdog and a few other things.

We shared the fried pickles and the Thor's Tots. Both appetizers were fried to perfection. They seemed oil free. All the sauces that came with the appetizers were ranch. One was Sriracha Ranch. We didn't think ranch really went with the pancetta in the Thor's Tots but as you know we are very picky. We thought the Thor's Tots could have used some salt and pepper but I note the tots were made very nicely.

I tried a vegetable filled panini with Swiss Cheese. The bread was toasted very nicely and all the vegetables were fresh but lacked any seasoning. They do get points for using fresh spinach and I appreciate that but in the panini all the vegetables got got steamed with out any seasoning so my sandwich came out very bland.It was OK but bland. The sandwich seemed a little light with the cheese. See Photo. Half way through my first half of sandwich I added salt and pepper to the inside and it was better. THEN I got the idea to add a little Sriracha Ranch and a couple fried pickles and then the sandwich was tasty. If your ordering a vegetable panini you might want to do the same as I did so you will have a tasty sandwich.

My husband also had a panini with a patty melt center. They cooked the burger a perfect medium rare. He said the onions on his burger were very good but the sandwich was more like an onion sandwich than a burger sandwich because the burger was very tiny and he tasted mostly just onions. The filling also didn't fill the bread so he got many bites of just bread.

I do note everyone working there seemed very nice.

3 stars is a positive review and mean A-OK according to Yelp."}
{"text":"Came in on 5/10 for lunch around 1:30. Food was great and so was the server. Very clean, well kept establishment. Love all the military theme. Will be returning soon with my veteran husband so he can check this place out! And love that it's basically across the street from my house!"}
{"text":"Went there tonight and thought it was ok. Nothing bad just nothing great. I felt it was a bit over priced for what you got. Good beer on tap was s bonus that took it from 3 to 4 stars."}
{"text":"Went here on a whim with my girlfriend and had a great time! The owner; Chad, was really nice and interesting. The service was outstanding and the food was very good. The Sriracha honey wings were excellent, and by far the best wings we have had since moving to Arizona. The bartender let us try some of the local beers they have on tap, and the drinks on special were very good! Overall, this is a very good bar and grill in the area. We look forward to going back very soon."}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza, wings and staff.   Friendly staff who go out of their way to make you feel comfortable.  The owner is a proud veteran who recognizes and acknowledges his fellow veterans with respect and appreciation.  Fire brick stove pizza and crispy wings are the best in the area."}
{"text":"Come here if you like a good tap been selection, good service and a neighborhood feel! Currently drinking a twisted pretzel wheat beer on tap, sitting on the nice patio enjoying my Thursday. Be jealous! One of the owners introduced himself and he is the type of guy whose business you want to support! Good prices for happy hour.. Didn't try food yet. Plenty of TVs.. Ok I'm rambling: just try it out."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great little neighborhood bar. Excellent burgers! Great tribute to veterans."}
{"text":"Everyone should go here at least once!  Mike, the owner, is a very humble decorated veteran who has so much respect for his fellow heroes.  He has a wall that he asks all veterans to sign when they come in and he has a special parking spot right out front for wounded vets.  Mike made it a point to stop and chat with everyone in the restaurant and I'm very glad he did.  He's a very friendly and welcoming man and I hope everyone gets to meet him when they visit the restaurant.  :) 

I recommend the pretzel with beer cheese as an appetizer.  My husband ordered the Arizona burger and Scottsdale blonde beer and really enjoyed it very much.  There aren't too many meat-less options for entrees, but I ordered the white pizza and wasn't disappointed.  The whipped margarita is a little on the sweet side because it's made with a sweeter vodka so I might try the regular marg when I go back.  Parking is really easy and it's easy to find.  There are a lot of booths that sit 1-4 people so if you have a big group, you might want to call ahead (they might be able to reserve seats in the bar for you).

The decor is really fun, Mike is amazing, the food is good, and the ambiance is really casual and fun.  We happened to go on a night when Fox10 was filming a segment and I can definitely see why they were there.  Go to Heroes, meet a hero, enjoy the eats & drinks.  :)"}
{"text":"Love this place my husband and I have been coming to this place for a year now and have no regrets.

The service is incredible the owner Mike comes and greets you and makes you feel at home as he shares his dream for the restaurant and his life. I haven't had a bad experience.

The food is amazing I love their wings, pizza, pretzels and cheese dip the most. They have served me cold cheese and I just asked the server to get a new one and they do right away. They always make sure that the quality of food and drinks are the best.

They did change their happy hour but this guys does a lot of fundraising for the schools and I don't mind paying a little more for a non chain restaurant. 

The last thing the decor Mike has some awesome stuff and you need to go and check it out!"}
{"text":"Great food. Try a lot of things on the meanie from the meat balls, their tits, and the pizza. Everything was delicious, buy the burgers were the best! Kyle was awesome too."}
{"text":"Tried Hero's for the first time and really loved it!  We had the homemade tot's that were gone fast at the table, very tasty and unique. The Monte Cristo was awesome, first time trying and now I'm going to crave it. My kids loved the pizza and pasta salad. Fun decor and friendly environment. Great job on the theme and ambiance."}
{"text":"Amazing! This is a great new place not far from me. The food is so delicious; you have to try the taco pizza. They make their dough from scratch, and it's heavenly. I would definitely recommend this place for everyone."}
{"text":"The pizza was fantastic they have a few selection then a build your own which was a great choice. The wings were nice and crisp. The service was great and we will definitely come again. Would recommend for a date or small family. Or just happy hours with friends. Definitely a five star and the decor is so awesome!!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. Loved the wings and tots. The sloppy joe was yummy. Haven't had anything bad here!  Hope this place does well."}
{"text":"Best New Pub in Glendale. 

Definitely check this place out.

The food is terrific and the staff is friendly and efficient.

The wings are the best in town."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I tried this place and planned on sharing a salad and an order of wings. We had dinner plans and didn't want to spoil our appetite later. We got half sriracha honey and half buffalo. The skin was perfectly crispy and wings had just the right amount of sauce. They were so amazing we got 10 more wings. I had a blueberry mule which was also great. The owner came by and spoke with us for a few minutes and thanked us for coming in. I came in the next week craving wings and again the owner was present thanking everyone at their tables for coming in. A big sign saluting heroes had been put up with active military and veterans signatures. A couple of old vets signed it and everyone cheered for them, which I thought was very cool. This time I got the wings and Thors tots which were delicious! They have lots of beers on happy hour but no cocktails although they are reasonably priced about $8. I will definitely be back for the wings!"}
{"text":"this is a great local bar and restaraunt, we found it by accident and it will be our go to place, the service was first rate all the way, inital welcome was fantastic and not overbearing, the server knew the meny intimatley and his selections were spot on."}
{"text":"I had a maid rite loose meat burger/slider. Served with fries. The meat was lacking a tad bit, but a little salt and pepper made up for it. 

The decor, the staff and the prices we all good.  I will have to come back on a nice day with the bar windows wide open. Looks like it could be a nice bar to hang out and drink and eat."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place because we wanted some hot wings and the Yelp reviews were good. We tried the Thor tots, the sliders, the boneless hot wings with the Hero gold/buffalo sauces and the green been fries. They were all excellent and our server, Katlyn, was great! I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The owner is the most amazing person and so kind! Discount for teachers! It is also the coldest beer in town!"}
{"text":"Great friendly staff. I highly recommend their hero gold wings, delicious! Their pizza is good as well."}
{"text":"Beer was cold..... Showed up 40 minutes before closing had the owner comment \"little late\" and he proceeded to mean mug us at the bar....It was 10:20 told they close at 11 pm but Yelp says they close at 12 midnight"}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly wait staff and efficient bar tenders.  The fried pickles were great and Thors tots are a must try."}
{"text":"Great place! Good food, bar tender is a straight hoot. Had us laughing all night. Need bigger exterior sign. I'll be back again for sure!"}
{"text":"Great spot with great food and drinks and wonderful service!!! Gotta try the lemon drop, tots, and Sriracha honey wings!! AMAZING!!!!!"}
{"text":"Our party of 11 ended up here after reading some of the Yelp reviews. We ordered 30 wings, 4 large pizzas & humus to share. The food wasn't anything great, especially the pizzas. At the end of our meal a nice man came out to thank us for coming and  for choosing his restaurant. That was definitely a nice gesture and left a smile on our faces!"}
{"text":"Came here the other night with my wife and kids and it was so good came back the next day for more. The Honey Siracha wings are maybe the best wings I've ever had. Also, love the Thors tots with Siracha Ranch. Definitely will be back again and again."}
{"text":"A must try! Started with Thor's tots- comes with ranch & siracha ranch, outstanding yummyness (that's a word right?!) The gold wings were full of flavor and cooked to my perfection. Created my own panini - salami, turkey, spinach & pepperjack cheese. I just had to dip it in the siracha ranch because I got addicted to it after trying it with the tots. Try the blueberry mule- I had 2 and wanted one to go. They have happy hour too from 3pm-6pm so I will just have to go back and have another. Kid-friendly, another plus. There's a nice patio out back too. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"For a neighborhood place to grab a drink, I'm a huge fan of Heroes. I haven't tried a ton of their food but what I have sampled has been pretty good, especially the honey sriracha wings. 

The patio is comfortable for happy hour ($1 off beers and the house brews are $2.50) and their selection of craft beer has something for everyone. Bar staff are friendly and make you feel welcome and there are a few TVs if you can't miss the game while you're drinking or dining. 

If you are from Iowa, you might want to try their taco pizza. See if it's the real deal or not. 

The restaurant portion is perfect for families looking for a bite to eat for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Best place for bar food:

This is the best Wing place is town. They are actually rated #2 in Phoenix for their wings. My personal favorite were the Sracha honey YUM. They were crunchy but juicy inside and the flavor was amazing. They spicy and a hint of sweetness. SO GOOD. We also ordered the ghost wings, they were tasty but very spicy. My husband loves spicy food and he really enjoyed them. 

The Ruben sandwich was also amazing. We have gone to so many places in Florida looking for the perfect Ruben sandwich, little did we know we would find it in Glendale Arizona.

The sliders were great, the pork one was a little dry for my taste, but if I were to order a full size of any of them, it would be the Chicken burger. They add garlic to it and it adds amazing flavor. 

I gotta say, what makes this place so special is not just the food, it's the people. Everyone has a great sense of ownership and community, their staff genuinely cares about this place. They owner makes sure to check in with every table and you can tell how important it is for them to provide the best service possible. 

The restaurant is call Heroes and they honor all military people and public service heroes as well. 

I definitely recommend this place 10/10"}
{"text":"If you want to go have a beer and hang with the crowd, around 3 pm you are gonna really disappointed and probably the only one there. The three times I was there there was no others there at all. The pubs and sports bars nearby serve large beers at happy hour. Heroes doesn't because let's face it. They ain't making no money. Literally the most boring, over priced , under served pub I have ever been in and I've been going to places like this around the US since '79. Pretty sad. The Super Hero cartoons in the bathrooms are the best part."}
{"text":"By far the best service and the best food. The saracha honey wings were amazing, Thor tots OMG and the burgers and pizza had so much flavor. My only negative is I can't give more stars! This will definitely be our regular stop. Thank you Bryce!"}
{"text":"Tried the Buffalo wings for the first time with my son about 5 days ago and have since had them 2 times since. They are the best wings I have ever had and I have had lots of wings. We also some Bavarian pretzels which were also fantastic. I will have to get myself to try more on the menu but it is hard with wings this good."}
{"text":"Terrific place! Owner, Mike is incredibly friendly!  If you're looking for cold beer, delicious food and friendly environment then look no further!!!"}
{"text":"The food was terrible and overpriced. Our Cobb salid was unappetizing as we only ate an eighth of it."}
{"text":"On Veterans Day , yahoo behind bar was rude to customers and other employees. I am a veteran and went to support. Couldn't get waited on by any one. A joke"}
{"text":"New favorite place. They have really great appetizers. The wings are my favorite. Favorite main course is the pizzas. They make their own dough. The best! Personal favorite is the taco pizza. Combine that with outdoor seating, an outdoor bar and a full bar with great beer selections and this is my favorite place to hang out. 

Best of all, these are some of the nicest people around."}
{"text":"It was good food, the only negative is the service was a tad slow and when I asked about desert items, I was informed they were all out of their specialized deserts but the could slice me a piece of cheesecake and put chocolate syrup over top.  All in all good food friendly people just need all their ducks in a row."}
{"text":"Love this place - friendly/quick service, casual atmosphere, local craft beers, and good food (not just bar eats). The happy hour is every day and includes a deal on their pizza which is fantastic. This is truly a class locally owned, neighborhood place that supports local businesses. Just what the Arrowhead area needs."}
{"text":"Great place.  Ordered a pizza and the Thor tots for dinner take out and was very pleasantly surprised by the place.  As soon as I walked in I was greeted immediately and made to feel very welcomed.  I mentioned that I was impressed with the decor and how they honored veterans, as I am one, and the owner came by to say hello and talk.  He asked me to sign the veteran wall and thanked me for my service and I thanked him for his.  Great place, clean, nice and the food was great.  The tots ROCK!!!  I will definitely be back and try other items and hope that others support a true military hero who owns a great restaurant."}
{"text":"We went to Heroes on a Sunday afternoon. The waitress came quickly and the food also came out shortly. We ordered the full sized Cobb salad and white pizza. For the cob salad, it was mainly iceberg lettuce with little toppings, the dressing was also subpar. In my opinion, not worth twelve dollars. The white pizza was also bland and could use more flavor. Overall, average food."}
{"text":"This is he best new America -style food restaurant I have visited in a long time!!!!! All the food was great, however the Taco pizza was THE BEST!!! The best part is the atmosphere... They want to honor anyone who was a hero in your life by sharing stories, putting photos on their wall... Amazing. My new favorite place."}
{"text":"The service and beer are great. The food is okay and a bit over-priced. I've had better sandwiches in the Glendale area, but it is nice to sit out on a patio and have a cold beer."}
{"text":"Great food .. awesome service. We LOVE that they honor our local heroes! We've been here at 15+ times and they never disappoint!"}
{"text":"I like the atmosphere and the super hero theme. The bar is nice and there's always sports on."}
{"text":"Superhero themed restaurant bar. 

We went to go to Zipps on 59th and union hills but because there was no parking we decided to venture somewhere new and landed at Heroes pub and grub. 

Food was really good. I got wings which they messed up my order and gave me chicken and waffle wings instead of garlic parmesan. I didn't say anything about the mistake because the wings were really good. Reminded me of the salty sweet chex mix. I also got the hero hot wings which were bbq and hot (bf choice) they were too hot even at being the lowest hot level. Bf didnt like them either. Bf got a beer cheese burger with fries which was really good. Daughter got a caesar salad which she said was also good.

Service was not great by any means but not upseting. Our server just took a really long time on everything and got some of our order wrong. He was still nice.

Willing to give it a shot again. 

Really liked the superhero theme."}
{"text":"Came here the other day on a whim. Wanted to try something new and Heroes is in biking distance from my house. Got here at 5pm still in time for happy hours.  As in other reviews, Heroes is a superhero themed bar.  Lots of comic scenes on the walls and the staff were all wearing superhero T-shirts. A cool idea. 

Seeing it was a nice day we sat at the bar and the garage doors were open letting in the breeze. We looked at the happy hour menu and ordered the pepperoni pizza. Wife had to throw in an order of fries jalapeños. Total was $10 bucks for both. Was expecting a small personal pizza but this was a good size. Easy to share, heck if we weren't so hungry from riding our bicycles we would have had left overs! Great value.  Plus it tasted great too!

Happy hour had all draft beers for $4. They have 16 on tap so that's a good deal too. They also have drink specials. Overall happy hour was a great value and probably the best in the area for food and drink. 

Sitting at the bar the two bartenders were great. We even had the owner (Mike) introduce himself. Mike's an ex Army Ranger who served in Vietnam. His Purple Hearts are on the wall. Super cool to talk to Mike and he is very pro military and civil service. 

I've only been to Heroes once but I will definitely come back again. I love local restaurants and this one is not to be missed."}
{"text":"One of the best cocktail I have ever tasted ..Blueberry mule. Gpod beer and good food as well. Many options in draft beer."}
{"text":"Great place and kid friendly. The stromboli was fantastic and the sliders are amazing. Loved their pretzels with beer cheese."}
{"text":"This is our new local spot hands down. Great people friendly staff the food is always consistent and phenomenal."}
{"text":"Cool place. The beer is always cold and always in a cold glass. The wings are awesome. We order them naked with honey sirachi & ghost pepper on the side and mix them. Good flavor and a bunch of heat."}
{"text":"Service was great, beer cold philly cheese steak was awesome!  The owner comes out and greats everyone and if you're a veteran asks you to sign the wall of Heroes. Will be going back several times this week while oat spring training!!"}
{"text":"Great place! The owner is so sweet and makes you want to come back. The tots are SO good, and the owner makes them every morning. Cubano sandwich was great as well. Blueberry mule is perfect if you are the drinking kind."}
{"text":"The food here is so amazing. Not your standard boring menu! We had the taco pizza and monte cristo panini and they were both so delicious. We will definitely come back very soon."}
{"text":"What a cute little place! I stopped in with some friends to unwind on a Friday afternoon during Happy Hour. The drink specials during HH are decent with cocktails, draft beers and wines at a discounted price. I got a personal sized pepperoni pizza off of the HH menu and it was HUGE. It came with 8 slices, was thin crust and it was only $6! Definitely a winner for me. If you're a cheese purist, you can get the same sized cheese pizza for $5. My main issue with this pizza was that it was SO GREASY. I dabbed it with my napkin several times and I swear grease was still seeping out. For it being a thin crust pizza, I was fairly surprised. At least I know there's a lot of cheese right?

The main issue my friends and I had food-wise was with Thor's Tots. It's description in the menu makes it seem like normal tator tots smothered with deliciousness such as garlic, cheese, chives, and bacon. What came out however were deep fried mashed potato balls filled with cheese and bacon. It was not a flavor nor a texture that we were all expecting and we were all disappointed about it. Even the ranch and sriracha ranch couldn't really change our minds. Now if you like mashed potato balls, then you would probably enjoy Thor's Tots, but they were not a hit at our table.

Overall, Heroes is a cool new spot in the Glendale area with pretty good food, drinks, and service. Additionally, there are several TVs and an outdoor bar patio which will be pretty sweet now that it is cooler. 3.5 stars for me!"}
{"text":"We have been waiting for a place like this in our neighborhood. My husband liked the variety of craft beer.  We spoke to the owner for awhile very nice guy who uses local business for beer and wine. It's bar food but there were 4 of us and everything we had was good. Great atmosphere, lots of TV's so looking forward to catching some games this football season. We will definitely be making this place our Neighborhood bar and restaurant."}
{"text":"Great spot for food and drinks.  I absolutely adore their appreciation for our servicemen and women, and the staff is incredibly personable.  The food was delicious, and everyone in our party had a wonderful and memorable experience.  At the time of writing this, Local Flavor has a $15 for $30 deal going on, and with that discount, there's no reason not to make a stop at Heroes."}
{"text":"Sriracha honey wings - Best wings I have ever had! Highly recommend this place. Pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"We just happen to see this on yelp because it was close by and we wanted wings. Boy am I glad we stopped in!!! Friendly staff and very welcoming. The owner was amazing so friendly! Thanked us for coming in. Now onto food, the hero gold boneless wings were our favorite! I also got a blueberry mule which was super good and 2 jalapeño margaritas that are my new favorite! For sure coming back! 
And sign up for the VIP club to get coupons and offers!"}
{"text":"We love this place.  The food is really good, the beer selection is varied and the ambiance is nice.  They are one of the few sports bars that has a shortened menu, its basically two pages.  Some sports bars has 5-6 pages of food, which tells me everything is probably frozen.  If I owned a bar I'd have a one page menu and make everything daily and fresh.  We s/w the owner and he shares my feelings.  And their devotion to veterans is heart warming.  Kudos Heroes.  

The only complaint is there is a female waitress that seems to have a bit of an attitude and seems irritated by simple requests.  Otherwise everyone else is fantastic."}
{"text":"Love this place.  If you are from the Midwest and like Happy Joe's taco pizza...this is your place!  Great taco pizza, great wings, great beer.  We haven't had anything we didn't like.  Always friendly, and welcoming!  Not the fastest food service, but the wait is worth it and a couple beers while you wait are perfect.  Thanks again for another great night!"}
{"text":"This is our Friday hangout as often as we can. Good food, real friendly staff and they now remember our orders and drinks. Prices are very reasonable too."}
{"text":"I had my eye on this place for awhile and finally made it here last night with my hubby and kids.  I love the inside art and the life-size Spider Man hanging from the ceiling was especially a nice touch.

The food was all delicious.  Thor's Tots was a hit with all of us and something I highly recommend ordering.  I wish the order was bigger but this was enough to be shared between 2 adults.  I ordered their slider trio of the burger, chicken, and bratwurst.  I found the mustard on the bratwurst a bit powerful for me but I was overall very happy with the order.  My husband ordered the breakfast burger and it was devoured in mere minutes.  The kids shared the kid size pizza but with them being picky eaters, it went unfinished and we brought it home.

Service was excellent and the owner stopped by to chat with us and was particularly nice and chatty to my older child.  I find this place to be kid friendly with all of the superhero art and nice for the adults too with the bar/drinks.  This first visit was a bit rushed because of the impatient kids but I would love to come back for adult time and try out some drinks and other food!"}
{"text":"Excellent taco pizza!! This is a staple back in my hometown in WI & it's been a journey to find a decent match  - Heroes offers up! Beware as the taco sauce has a KICK!! Also tried their tator app & those were good & likely better had we are them at the bar rather than did take out. We'll be back to check out the bar, sports, taps and menu!"}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted to try something new. We weren't disappointed. The service was great and the place has a fun atmosphere. 

Try the thor tots, they're really good, so are the Sloppy Joe sliders."}
{"text":"1st time here for an impromptu date night with my wife. Attentive and friendly staff and pretty darn good food. We'll be back."}
{"text":"Yikees Wingman!! In my first review I mentioned we were going back for the Ghost Pepper Wings. Well, we did. Let me repeat...YIKEES!! We love hot things around here, I even grow some scotch bonnets just for kicks (see what I did there?). Now, TBH we are pretty sick and tired of places and items advertising XX HOT this or that only to find out that it's actually mild on our scale. 

Apparently, so are the people at Heroes. The Ghost Pepper wings are rated 4 fire emojis and I'm here to tell you that's equivalent to about a 9 on a Thai restaurant scale, aka Chef Hot or Thai Hot. I literally cried after a wing and a half, never finishing that second wing. It's melt your eyeballs hot. Out of curiosity, we asked our waitress how much hotter Apocalypse wings were and she informed us that they are based on the ghost pepper with some Trinidad Scorpions and the Carolina Reaper (I'm pretty sure it was Reaper) thrown in for good measure. We brought a sample home but I'm not sure we'll ever try it. The owner, Mike, came over and we discussed the sauces. He assured  me that they were using fresh peppers for the sauces, flying them in from NYC as needed! He said the ghost sauce weighs in at 900k+ scoville and Apocalypse is weighing in at 2.7M scoville for you serious chile heads.

Long story short...if you want some wings that make \"Suicide\" look like child's play - this is your place. Order plenty of extra ranch or bleu. You've been warned."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood location. Hoping for a turkey patty to be added - that would make this my go to sports bar  Very friendly staff with make your own panini sandwiches"}
{"text":"Great Place!!! Its a great place for a few drinks and a bite to eat. Not too loud, No tvs blasting everywhere. You can actually sit,talk, eat and drink in a great atmosphere. The owner Mike is super nice! I really enjoyed talking with him. We had the wings, sliders and green beans no complaints!!! Someone mentioned cooked to well on the burgers...that's how they should be. Burgers can have a good chance of getting all sorts of not so nice things in the grinding process, etc. Not the same as an overcooked steak. I loved the sliders!!! Great Job Mike!!! We are coming back. Thanks for what you are doing for the Heroes!!!"}
{"text":"Found our new Friday night! Awesome service, very clean and everyone was extremely friendly!! We ordered the Thor Tots and Wings in Hero Gold...best wings ever!!! The sauce was just spicy enough and the tangy flavor was delicious! The tots were like tiny balls of loaded potatoes...yum yum yummy! We ended up with the white pizza, Monte Cristo and Patty Melt for dessert: FANTASTIC!!! We had a Whipped Margarita: AMAZING!!! Our server was so sweet and Gave great recommendations on the food and then, just when I thought I was stuffed, she mentioned Boston Creme pie for dessert. I'm officially a fan...we will be back!!"}
{"text":"I don't normally write many reviews but I highly recommend this place. My boyfriend and I have been coming here since it opened. Food is always great. Everything we've tried we've liked. Wings are always a good choice (I've tried heroes gold, siracha honey, garlic parmesan, and chicken and waffles) and tamale bites are one of my fave items. They always have a variety of local beers. I myself don't really drink beer but I usually get the pear cider. Though I have grown a liking for the big blue van.  Owners are awesome and always friendly, staff as well. All in all great place!!!"}
{"text":"My kid loved Spiderman hanging from the ceiling, the super hero decor, the super hero color sheet and his pizza!! He ate the entire pizza! I could not have eaten the entire pizza! Hubby had the burger and enjoyed it! I thought the pizza was great! They have a wood burning oven, my favorite way to have pizza cooked!

The owner came up to us and introduced himself. He is a very proud Veteran who loves this Country and his fellow man, especially other Vets. He asked my hubby to sign a wall near the entrance dedicated to Veterans. Bless his soul!! We will support this business on a regular basis!"}
{"text":"It was like a kids menu with upscale prices and an over-the-top adult bar.  Burgers, Hot Dogs, Pizza.  $9.50 for a 'Burger King' type of hamburger served in a plastic basket???  Not that the burger itself wasn't good, it was. It was just $4.50 good like Burger King.  I didn't try the beers so maybe that's it's sweet spot.  I wish it had been better since it's so close to the house and I loved Stella 59."}
{"text":"I would like to tell now this is my bar. Everything is perfect starting with the excellent service. The food is delicious, there are many types of beers, the attendance is perfect and friendly and the place is awesome. 
The owner is a living hero!!! 
You guys need to try this bar!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was nervous when I walked in to this place at almost noon on a weekday and was the first customer, but was pleasantly surprised! The service was very friendly and food was quick!
The Thor's tater tots were amazing and I could eat those for days! I ordered the lunch sliders and fries. The sliders (bratwurst and burger) were really tasty, but I was disappointed by the fries. I had higher expectations for fries in a sports bar setting, but was let down. The sliders, by definition, are a small portion so the fries made up what seemed like half the meal and could've been better.
My coworkers had the pizza and salads and were definitely happy! I would still return, but would just try another side."}
{"text":"What a great local place. Love the people, wings, cold beer and the closeness to my house. Salute to veterans is just an amazing touch. Go. Eat. Drink. Support this small business!"}
{"text":"One of the best burgers I've had in a while! Before you go to a regular place like Chilis for a burger go to Hero's!"}
{"text":"Fun place tucked away in a little strip mall on the northwest side. Food here is really good. I had the Siracha honey wings and the Thor Tots. I like that the wings were not drenched in sauce but had enough sauce to have good flavor. The Thor Tots are really good and original. Tator tots with bacon and cheese bits in them. The Siracha ranch it comes with is tasty as well. Server was very friendly and helpful. The interior of this place is very nice. The tables and chairs are high quality. Not sure why the Italian place that was here before failed, but the colors seem to be left over from that. They also have two large patios here, and I think I even saw a cornhole game. My only advice would be maybe to add more TVs and change the interior. Either ditch the super hero theme or REALLY play it up and have a lot more memorabilia, costumes, drinks/menu items, theme nights etc. Also, and this is a big one, dim the lights at night. This is not a Denny's, it's much cooler than that. If they start dimming the lights at night this has potential to be a fun night hot spot with the 20 and 30 year olds. There aren't many other places for them to go in this area."}
{"text":"The best. From bartenders to the owner they kill it everyday. Food is on point chicken and waffle wings are money. Plus how can you not love a place with a giant hanging Spider-Man."}
{"text":"First time here & was beyond impressed. The concept is amazing ~ all about \"heros\".  The owner came up to my husband and I personally introduced himself. He gave us a rundown of the concept and was a very personable guy!  Food was good and great atmosphere!  Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Great for neighborhood food and drinks as well as dinner with the family.  I'm so glad Heroes is getting good reviews!  My wife, daughter, and I have been a few times.  The food selection is good and well prepared.  The beer selection is quality, but not overwhelming, and you always get your beer in a fresh frozen glass.  The best part of this place are the employees and the owner, which is why I'm so glad to see positive reviews.  They are the nicest bunch of people and really care that you are enjoying your experience.  Stop on in.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great food and close by!! Loved that the owner came to the table and explained the menu and discounts offered. Kids liked their meal choices and the taco pizza was amazing. The lemon drop even more impressive"}
{"text":"Was looking for a new restaurant and found this place on Yelp. Food is absolutely delicious. So fresh  and flavorful. I will be coming to this place all the time. Mike came over and talked to us also and you can tell how passionate he is about his restaurant. Great place, can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Loved it!  Really cool atmosphere and the food was great. They had a lot of local beers on tap and a nice variety of dark and light beers. The staff was really friendly and practiced quick service.  We will definitely be back. Thor tots for the win!"}
{"text":"This spot feels like home by now, have over 25 check-ins by now I think..  love the bar keeps and food is always delish. Plus they are all about patriotism which is great.  #mike"}
{"text":"Stopped by for brunch on Saturday the first week it opened, great beers on draught & cocktails, amazing food! Mike, the owner, came over to chat with us and thank us for coming in-- truly a community centered establishment. Build your own meal style menu, I had the panini & loved trying out the ghost pepper cheese. The tater tots are a must! We ended up taking some to go."}
{"text":"This is definitely going to be our go to place! I have yet to have something I didn't like. Their Thor tots and Sriracha honey wings are to incredible! Huge plus was their beer was so ice cold. You you have to come try it out. Employees here are so friendly and fast. Would recommend to anyone to come try it out. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time here and we loved it! The food was delish! We had the pepperoni pizza, honey gold wings along with the siracha honey wings and they were amazing! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I am surprising myself and giving a bar and grill place 5 stars. Ha! I really did just have a wonderful 5 star experience here. To start, I had the deep fried green beans. I was sad that the online menu listed pickles and they do not offer them anymore. The online menu is not exactly the same as their actual menu. The GB were great and so was the chicken salad sandwich I ordered. They make their own homemade chips here. Homemade Potato chips are one of my weaknesses if they are made right. Yummy. 

The theme is the best. The place is run by an Ex- Army Ranger so military posters are hanging about.  He has a heroes theme to the place.  So inside there are things like: fireman hats, police memorabilia, super hero toys. Of course, who could resist having Spidey dropping down to take a look at what you are eating. Maybe he wants to get in your selfies or group photos? The bathrooms have Wonder Woman and Superman painted on them. Pretty fun and kind charity to first responders. 

So, the reason I gave the place 5 instead of 4 was because I was blown away by the service. Kat was more than A-mazing with that capitol A. We had such a nice chat. Granted, I hit the place up at a slow time but still it was really cool of her to placate me. She hung out with me for more than a few and we talked double FF, Food and Fine Arts. Ha! I really enjoyed our conversation. Customer Service matters.

I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Service was fast and the ghost wings were actually g*d d*mn hot! Salad was weak but for brews, burgers, beers this place is killer."}
{"text":"It is very rare that I have disliked a place so much that I decide to never go back there. This is one of the few that I have chosen to not experience again. I would love to say that I perhaps went on an \"off night\", but speaking to relatives and friends they had almost an exact experience. 

The place was well enough for my son whose only enjoyment was the spider man plush they had hanging from the ceiling. In my opinion, if you are calling yourself a Heroes bar, you would have more heroes on the wall or memorabilia than what they currently possess. It is more like a sports bar with a few super heroes splattered on the wall. I would have even expected that (being a heroes themed place) they would have a few of the TVs playing a super hero movie. 

Don't get me wrong I totally get that the name of the place is Heroes PUB and grub, so not necessarily really geared towards kids, but again if you are going for a hero theme, then have more hero related items. 

My frustration with my visit is not only due to the lack of hero related objects, but the service my family and I received there are well. To begin, the beer selection wasn't all that great. Sure, it contained the typical drinks on tap that most other places have (bud, etc), but lacked in all other options. 

Secondly,I can understand that some places do not offer rare as an option for hamburgers; albeit VERY few. But when the only option is well done it makes finding food on their already limited menu difficult. Their specialty seems to focus around panini. 

Also, if our food were to take long due to an extremely busy night then I wouldn't be additionally upset regarding my visit, but inside the restaurant there  was one other table with customers other than our own. It took a while to get our drinks and longer for the food.

 We both ended up ordering wings and my son got a grilled cheese sandwich (virtually a cheese panini). My fiance took one bite of her wing and I could see her kind of hesitate as she chewed it, so I took a bite of mine to see what the issue might have been. Only to figure out our food was most likely ready a while before that and just not brought out to us for our wings were lukewarm at best ( and that is being generous in my description of the temperature of our food). The same was trued not only with the wings we ordered but with the tots, and her other side item. We couldn't even bring ourselves to eat the leftovers because we were so unhappy with our experience 

On the rare occasion our server came by, to be honest I was extremely frustrated at this point in time as well, he asked how everything was; so I was brutally honest with him. I explained to him that our food was cold, but that we did not have the time for them to make new batches for us and that my sons was only slightly warmer than our own. I told him we will need boxes so we can get home and get the check. Even then it took him a while for the check to arrive and even longer for a different server to pick it back up. 

During the course of our dinner the person who I can only assume is the manager walked by our table more times than our own server and not once asked how things were like I am used to at every other restaurant I have visited especially on such a slow night. Our waiter never brought the manager by to see what could be done about obviously dissatisfied customers; granted I should have asked to speak with him myself, but I was livid at this point in time. 

Again, as I left I kept hoping that this was just one bad experience, but when I heard from multiple people they had an almost exact experience, I can't convince myself to go back and give it another shot."}
