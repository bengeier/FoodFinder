{"text":"Very disappointed in the portion of food. We ordered a 2 item with the nilaga, the bowl that they use for a second item is for a size of a salsa cup. It's the tiniest \"bowl\" we've ever seen.  Needless to say, there was one meat and a potato in the tiny bowl. The kare-kare is made of pata instead of oxtail which is hard as a rock. The sisig was okay. And to top it all, the server is rude! Completely lost my appetite."}
{"text":"Seriously good Filipino food. Better than I've had in some restaurants that charge twice as much. They've got the recipes down, and service is super fast."}
{"text":"If I could give 0 stars I would. While ringing up customers, the cashier was on the phone entire time, so rude. No acknowledgement to the customers whatsoever."}
{"text":"If there's one place that you should avoid ordering Filipino food especially during holiday is this place . Very unorganized!! Being somebody from out of town , we thought to save us trouble from cooking is to just order food. The time to pick up our food we were told that they don't have my ticket order. Luckily I have mine!!  The stress that this place gave me before New Years is unbelievable.  So if you don't want to go through the same situation I would avoid this place or call hours before to make sure your order is ready."}
{"text":"I was excited because it was close to home but disappointed with the bad service. I was called suplado because i voiced my opinion and they were talking shit about me in tagalog. Wanted to give it no stars but prices are cheaper then most pinoy stores"}
{"text":"Good stuff! Swabeng busog! Masarap! Kaya kumain na kayo dito! I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Very little parking, isles way too narrow to do any real shopping, and today the lumpia tasted like yesterdays fried fish. They really need to clean their deep frier."}
{"text":"Closer to home, lots of choices of Filipino turo-turo, even lechon, but expensive in comparison to other Filipino turo-turo and worse, they skimp on the portions they give. We bought XL Kare Kare for take out today, when we got home it turned out to be mostly sauce and no meat, just bones! Servers help you with heavy faces."}
{"text":"Sometimes the food is super fresh and I enjoy it when it is. Other times, it's like it has been sitting there for days. I go there because the price is right, they always have Lechon Kawaii and I can do a bit of shopping. I am however disappointed that I catch the workers eating on the buffet line which is a major food violation! Although it is just a worker grabbing a piece of meat with the tongs and eating it, her saliva while eating is most unsanitary. I have also experienced the bussers cleaning the tables and spraying cleaner on the tables right next to where we are eating, making our meal and myself nauseous! I think if management showed more discipline on their staff I would be here everyday. The food would be better and I wouldn't have to worry about getting sick from lazy unsanitary people. But it is so hit or miss I am thinking maybe I should not visit anymore."}
{"text":"Lots of variety if you're looking for a quick and simple place to get Filipino food. By variety (aside from the product availability), I should also mention that the grocery store is connected to an all you can eat buffet which has reasonable prices. This location ALSO has a quick service food station for to-go orders (hence \"Express\")."}
{"text":"Worst market I've ever encountered. The employees are super rude. Where's the costumer service at? If your unhappy at your place of job leave don't show attitude from beginning to end ridiculous the owner needs to re evaluate the employees maybe this store would be worth keeping but I'd rather have this place shut down! I won't ever step foot in that store again! People that had recommend me that store was the biggest mistake id rather take the long drive to seafood city take my business else where!"}
{"text":"If you're craving Filipino food on this side of town I recommend this place. It's a bit small but doesn't really bother me. Always have a variety of dishes to choose from. I really like the kare kare, pork sinigang, mongo and if they have it the eggplant omelet. \m/"}
{"text":"Whenever I get the hankerings for some quick and cheap Filipino food I come by here. I typically order the 2 item combo with kare kare and lechon kawali, with 1 additional side of something that looks good that day, perhaps some goat kaldereta or pork binagoongan, or even a fried bangus.  The food here is pretty decent for the price and what keeps me coming back is the kare kare - they have it all the time.  Other turo-turo spots only serve it up on certain days, which is a bummer since I always seem to want it when they're not cooking it.  So I end up back here to satisfy my craving.    With the extensive selection of food they have here, it is not surprising that they are busy here.  You'll find something that will satisfy."}
{"text":"I have been to the other location on Maryland pkwy so I was expecting this to be buffet style.  First it's inside of the Filipino store and has a small area for seating, there are 7- 4 seat tables that line the window side and the food counter runs about the same length.  It's a small area but I was surprised at the amount of choices they had.  I ordered the salmon sinigang and pinakbet, they were both really good.  Price :  1 item = $4.99 +tax 2 item = $5.99 +tax"}
{"text":"Be warned!!!! Do not waste your money and do not put the unworthy calories in your body from this restaurant.  Quality of food= sucks Price= ok Food selection= sucks Customer service= sucks  Dnt waste your money here. Not worth it."}
{"text":"Very scary my sister and I ate here and ordered the fish with coconut milk and vegetable about a week ago and that night my sister and I both had a skin problem/irritation from that fish that we both ate from this place. We also ordered pinakbet that we can't even eat because it was super salty/inedible....my sister called me from CA and begged me for us not to eat at that place again next time."}
{"text":"No Star for this! Rude Cashier! No manners . that little long blond hair always talking shits! not professional! i love the food but will mever com back if the staff are still here."}
{"text":"The cashier/lady servers are very unprofessional- they will talk and laugh right in your face, making you feel like you're getting in the way of their conversations!   Come on ladies, basic customer service- greet your customer, scan the items and maybe have a little convo and bye- that's it. Not asking for a 5 star service but a basic client courtesy.   Food is so-so, nothing special but it'll do.  Fresh meat/fish at the back and veggies too.   The guy at the fish/meat counter is very nice and accomodating.  Ordered 2 fried fish to go and got that right away--- very oily and super fishy smell, they need to clean their deep fryer.   You'll find your basic filipino groceries, some lunch-- and if the ladies at the back counter adjusted their behavior towards customer, this place would be a hit!"}
{"text":"The service here SUCKS! If you're not Phillipino, they don't give 2-shits about you. We had to SEARCH for someone to help check us out because everyone on the other side of the counter just stared at us. We had to ask someone that apparently was on break because he was more concerned about making his plate than helping a customer. If I could give a negative star, I would; because SERVICE IS EVERYTHING and if you can't cut it -- DONT DO IT."}
{"text":"Best kept Filipino secret in Henderson! Not only a market of Asian goodies but a restaurant that serves the best tasting filipino food in Vegas! Gotta try the buffet!! Given the fact I've just moved to Vegas 8 months ago.....still exploring.   BTW, cashier lady should make a little more eye contact and I do understand filipino. I heard what she was saying when I asked another cashier if they had puto. Just say she wasn't being nice"}
{"text":"The food is terrible. The batter is too floury and they charge an extra $1 for this. The portions are small. My boyfriend says I can cook better than this. The dining area is too small. The only good thing is that it is close to where we live. But we doubt we will be going back"}
{"text":"By far the worst customer service ever!!! Never fails!! Every time I go they are so rude!! They only talk to you if you speak Tagalog. I'm Filipino but I don't speak the language and they knew it so they treated me as if I didn't exist. So irritating!! I'd give them a zero if I could. Food is too greasy and it smells like chemicals in there. Wish they had more Filipino stores in Henderson because I will never go back to this one."}
{"text":"Yeah!! Love this place. Been there several times for lunch and have not been disappointed. The ampalaya, the sinigan, the sisig, and kaldereta have all been on my plate. Plus, the market and meats are very handy."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! Rude and extremely dirty! If you want food poisoning, eat there! The staff is the most unprofessional and unfriendly people ever!! I can not believe they are even in business! They do not even deserve 1 star!"}
{"text":"They recently opened a buffet next to the store. So I tried it out. $8.99 buffet soda $1 each extra. Food selections basic (no pancit) what!?! disappointed in that. no lumpia either not good start. They served siningang, beef machado, bbq pork and chicken, vegetable soup with shrimp? about 6 pieces of shrimp in a pan, adobo etc. It was ok food that I can cook at home but I'm too hot & lazy to cook.   Worst of everything !!!! It was soooo HOT!!! inside. No central A/C barely on or not but they had 2 portable a/c conditioners running. It was uncomfortable to eat while you're sweating all the time. Seems like most of these restaurants (filipino) never stay cool always uncomfortable!!! It's 108 outdide!!!! All the ice in my glass has melted away  btw, they serve fruits N small i mean small pastries"}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this is the right location or not, but I ordered at one of their restaurants a few weeks back. I ordered nilaga. The beef tasted like it was in sinigang, and then they rinsed the meat in water and put it in a nilaga broth. It was utterly disgusting. There was a gamy taste to the soup. It was disappointing. I've never tasted nilaga like that."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely atrocious! The floors are always filthy and the employees are just downright rude. My husband and I are both Filipino but it's easier for us to converse in English. I don't understand why they act so annoyed when we ask them something in English. The witchy cashiers NEVER smile and NEVER greet the customers. All they do is ring up your items, tell you the total, and collect the money. No \"thank you\", no \"did you find everything you need?\", NOTHING!   The food is actually not too bad but the horrible customer service ruins any good in this place.  Go to Ortigas on Las Vegas Blvd and Silverado Ranch instead."}
{"text":"Good place to come if you just want something quick and cheap. I had their one item, sisig and rice and it was really good and had a nice kick to it. The only thing was it was REALLY oily, I had to drain it. Other than that, it was tasty. Bf had dinuguan and I don't eat it but he loves the stuff and said theirs was good."}
{"text":"Great little find while coming up to Vegas!   It's your normal Filipino fast food style restaurant in a small market. Cramped to say the least. They sell goodies from the Philippines here, which is awesome for my little fobbish family haha! They do have a small fresh fish and meat department at the rear end of the store-alongside a fridge with some fresh Asian vegetables as well.   The food they sell here is not the best but they were pretty busy-so maybe I just picked the wrong dishes when I went. I shared a plate of BBQ pork belly and \"lechon paksiw\" with my mother and all was just extremely oily and bony, not too appetizing. They have a few tables and chairs set up here for dining.   I'll probably be back again the next time I'm up in Vegas-the stores out here in San Diego don't sell the snacks they sell here at this store."}
{"text":"No matter what days you go to this place, they always  ruins your mood.  This time I'm complaining about their staff  from the hot food  they're not supposed to serve at the front., they're  absolutely rude,  hopefully the owner or whoever in charge on that location will  read this."}
{"text":"Came here during work lunch hours,thank you for not having a line,having fresh food(not dry looking food),and a friendly staff that day no matter what the payment plan maybe"}
{"text":"The worst Filipino restaurant I've ever been, I will never recommend the place, they used rotten veggies."}
{"text":"Laugh out loud to this store. It's ridiculous how they treat customers plus the fact that it's small and dirty, they just don't know customer service at all. I only buy stuff here when Island Market doesn't have what I am looking for. One time, I bought an empanada.. and when I got home, she gave me the burnt ones! Lol! Their snacks are stale, oh and just when you open the door, the handles are disgustingly dirty- they don't even bother cleaning or changing it & You would think that they would be friendlier with other Filipinos but they kinda seem like they hate you or something. Haha. Today, I bought a drink and they didn't even bother putting it in a bag, I have to ask them myself. They were too busy chatting. Omg. I wouldn't waste my money here anymore. TOTALLY not worth it. Glad they are building Seafood City close to my apartment. To others, RUN!!! This place is extremely bad!"}
{"text":"I always come here when I crave Filipino food. They have excellent food and customer service. Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"I've come here a handful of times because the location is convenient.   The store is disorganized, cluttered, and dirty. The prices on display are often lower than the actual price when scanned.  But the main reason I will no longer spend my money here is because the staff are all rude.   The female employees always talk shit under their breath in Tagalog, snicker, and assume I don't understand them. The male employees are dismissive, refusing to be bothered with any questions.  I'm all for supporting local, mom & pop businesses. But, not if they don't respect or value their customers."}
{"text":"Great Filipino grocery store, carries basic items, but needs more variety of veggies. Aisles could be bigger, and overall cleanliness needs improvement. Cashier was friendly."}
{"text":"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge 75/100  When I do come here, it's usually for the grocery market side. It's pretty small and tight but usually has what I need if I forget it from the larger Asian/Filipino markets. This is close to home, so it's convenient. I went here just the other day and noticed they have new items. More desserts and other items at the restaurant side. A new item is their homemade Kimchi which is a little different than Korean Kimchi. It has other vegetables in it, that are not usually in kimchi, I'm assuming it's used as a filler here. Large pieces of green onions/scallions. I'd prefer to get the Korean style Kimchi which they usually have in their market cold section.   I have tried their food at the express, and it's not the best.   Service is nice. Nothing to complain about but also nothing to rave about."}
{"text":"So disappointed. Downloaded Yelp just so I can leave feedback. Went in at 8:45am wanted to longsilog they have on the menu. The lady said they have no more longganisa but there are few left on the side as I can see. Then there were no eggs. Normally they Fry eggs for you especially still breakfast time. But no, the lady says get something else instead. Left and drove to another Filipino restaurant nearby and got my breakfast."}
{"text":"If it weren't for their location just a block away and on my drive home I would take my business elsewhere.  The workers seem so unhappy and annoyed - except for the nice man working the meat counter. The food is decent but their attitude always makes it less appetizing.  Not to mention I always reheat my arroz caldo because the chicken is not thoroughly cooked so be careful!!!"}
{"text":"This place has been fined for poor hygienic standards. I would avoid this place like the pest."}
{"text":"Best ginataan Langka, and pimakbet. Reasonable price. Kate-Kare is average. Salmon belly is very good, only they don't have it too often. They also have a small market, which makes it very convenient to be in one place and get groceries needed."}
{"text":"I just saw them at Dirty Dining. Not surprised since I saw a truck driver once enter the area where they serve food. Serve himself a meal, and eat right in front of the food line and customers. Just picked up a piece of meat from his plate and ate it right there. And also when they spray Windex on the glasses while the food are still there. Customer service used to be really good but went downhill. One lady worker were always rude or lazy. She always gives off that vibe that she doesn't wanna serve. Also, the manager/ owner was yelling at them one time for not doing their job while ringing me up. Awkward. She's yelling from one counter to the other side of the store (where the food was)... I don't know if we'll be back. 2 stars because the prices are reasonable and the butchers at the back are really really nice."}
{"text":"Filipino comfort food + Asian market all in one!  I love coming here to grab a bite to eat when I'm craving for Filipino food.   They always give a generous amount of food. One plate could be shared between two!  They have a lot of yummy food options also!   One thing they lacked was good customer service. I come here at least once a month and I'm never acknowledge by the employees and they always look at me funny...  (but the food makes up for it!!)  I would suggest this place for authentic Filipino food! But be prepared for the poor customer service... It's a very reasonable price for what you get!! Yummmm"}
{"text":"- opened 2 months ago. - grocery/Filipino restaurant - point..point. - fresh meat/fish/vegetables. - You can buy Lechon here. - frozen foods too. - pretty much a one stop shop. - clean inside. - workers friendly.   Check it out!"}
