{"text":"The food tastes okay, but the price is too high for each item and the service is horrible. We need to find the waiter for water or other service and it took Forever for them to come!!! We were supposed to have dinner before the movie but end up almost missing it because the whole meal took so long!!!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome if you are looking for a place for late night or for eating before movies. Their chicken is pretty good and I love their budae jjigae. They also have a nice variety of korean wine and alcoholic drinks. I will definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a satisfying meal with friends or alone."}
{"text":"food was okay, but waaaaaay over priced!!!!!!! i like their fried chicken and pancakes, just wish they were a little bit cheaper!"}
{"text":"I just loved the food there! The no.9 spicy ramen, kimchi&sweet potato pizza, pork and beef hot pot.....I just have to go there once in a while to treat myself!"}
{"text":"I tried the sweet potato and kimchi pizza. It was really good and very cheesy. There was more potato then kimchi in the taste and texture. The kimchi was too mild for me, I like it hot and tangy. So it fell short on that area but it was still delicious. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is probably the only karaoke place in central Illinois and it does a pretty good job considering the price tag.

I've only been once, but the private room is a lot nicer than I thought it would be. I went with 4 other people and we each paid around 20 dollars each which is a little pricey, but that's as good as it's going to get considering where we were. Also, keep in mind we also bought some drinks.

There is a devoted English karaoke machine, but we didn't use it so I can't tell you much about it, except that it doesn't have Lady Gaga's newer songs. There's a nice guy who works at the place who'll show you how to use the machine if it's your first time so don't worry about that...

The other machine was what I was used to. It was your standard Korean one. There were some English, Japanese, Chinese and Thai songs on the Korean machine as well. (The Japanese songs have Korean above it for those who can't read Japanese haha!). 

There's also a restaurant attached to the place where you can eat before or after you sing, but I can't tell you much about that."}
{"text":"I'm sure my experience would have been better if I had gone to Star Karaoke myself, but I was stuck at home. I had some  food delivered, but it took a really long time, and it was really cold by the time I received it. Food might have been better, but it was hard to tell because it was cold."}
{"text":"I went here because I heard that they had the best Korean fried chicken in the area. The exterior planted doubt in my mind that this was a real Korean restaurant, and I actually drove around for 5 minutes because I didn't expect that the sign saying \"BBQ and Pizza\" was the one I was searching for. The restaurant is managed by an old, and very friendly Korean couple. I ordered the whole chicken instead of the wings, which was a very good choice because the table next to me ordered the wings and they were pretty small. The whole chicken was carved into 16 pieces, each with a large amount of juicy and tender meat, and just the right amount of crispiness. The sauce was very good. 

I also ordered stir-fried calimari, which was excellent. Comparing to the other restaurants on campus, I'd say this place is definitely superior. They also gave us white pickled radish as an appetizer which was equally great. Perhaps most of all, I like the fact that they give rides to and from their restaurant for groups. This probably cuts down on the incidence of drunk driving on karaoke nights."}
{"text":"I live in Champaign and usually order the food online, but after today I ordered it they suddenly called me and told me they can not delivered that far. I was really angry about the attitude from the manager who called me. Because if they checked the delivery history they can find me, but they just said they can not do the deliver.   I don't think I will go there again because of the manager's attitude."}
{"text":"I used to study in this area. The tofu soup and seafood pancake are soooooooo good! So is the fried chicken. Whenever I come back to champaign area, this is a must go! This time, we drove 3 hours from north chicago. Star is supposed to close within 40 minutes. The owner and cook must leave. We are so sad. But after we told her, she was surprised and helped us make the order. She cooked the dishes quickly and left. Leave us with the whole restaurant. Wow! What a huge faith! Thanks very much! Thank you for letting us fulfill this must go! Again! Must go, must come place in champaign/ Urbana area!!!"}
{"text":"budajige?not bad. We always order this dish, and the restaurant open late, good for people like me who stay pretty late at night"}
{"text":"My voice never sounded so good on a karaoke sound system - granted that I've gotten better at singing.  Still, awesome sound that made me forget the price.

Don't forget to order soju and Korean-style chicken wings with your experience. 

Apparently it costs money to bring water into the room though."}
{"text":"It's a Korean Karaoke/ Restaurant, probably the only karaoke place in Champaign-Urbana area. 

In terms of karaoke, there are good selection of songs ranging from mandarin, cantonese, english and of course korean songs. And the songs are surprisingly up-to-date.

For the food, I like the kimchi pork a lot. And the soup with beef ribs is good too...On a side note, they serve really good fried chicken. Alot of customers only come in and order fried chicken. 

Another note is it opens late. It serves food till 4-5am...so it can be an alternative drunk food from pizza/hot dogs..."}
{"text":"This place is an ok place for Korean food around the area. I had the beef soondubu, which was alright, but could have been better with less sesame oil and more spice. They're better known for their sweet potato + kimchi pizza, which is pretty good and is a good item to split if you're going family style. Fried chicken here is pretty good too. Buddaejigae is also not a bad option."}
{"text":"Best best best chicken I ever had. Called in for pick up around 2 pm and the lady answered the phone was really nice! Picked it up within 15 mins and it was still pretty hot when I got back to the hotel. Got the 16 pieces chicken with sweet and mild sauce and supreme sauce(a little to medium spicy). It tasted sooooo good! The reddish came with it is also really good with the fried chicken. Will get it again next time I'm visiting u of I."}
{"text":"I lost my keys there and they kept that for me till I went back for it! And their fried chicken is the best."}
{"text":"The only Korean restaurant that I can go to after 10pm! I love their Go Chu Jang Jjigae and Popcorn Chicken but almost every item is good! Also the server that works there is always so nice :) I'm so glad this place is  near where I stay at when I'm at U of I."}
{"text":"The fried chicken is really good if you get it in hot and spicy. The soups are decent, but the last time we ordered kimchi pancakes they came out burnt..."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with the karaoke experience here. I took my friend to celebrate her birthday. We arrived around 11:15. We were asked at 1:15 if we knew when we were leaving (the place closed at 2am) because the owners wanted to leave. I get that it's a slow night, but just because there are a few people in your establishment doesn't mean you should kick them out or make them feel unwelcome. That pretty much ruined the mood. The waiter apologized, citing cranky managers for wanting to leave early. We were obviously not happy about being asked to leave earlier than closing time, and made that clear to the waiter but were still charged for every cent for our time there. I thought the waiter, who seemed sympathetic and embarrassed at having to ask, would have at least compensated us for asking us to leave early. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Their mild and sweet fried chicken is legit. The sauce is *exactly* the same as that used for the 'yangnyeom tongdak' you'd eat in Korea. 

I think the secret is in the heavy taste of garlic and also the chopped peanuts. It's a classic that's hard to replicate one hundred percent, even for many fried chicken restaurants in Seoul these days. 

So if you're eating Korean-style fried chicken at any other restaurant in CU, you're basically wasting your money. 

Can't comment on anything else because I normally order to-go."}
{"text":"is not that great.

 (fried chicken in heavy, yummy sauce) is EXCELLENT. Our special monthly treat."}
{"text":"Interesting little place by the theater that offers some good Korean bbq and other Korean food. Stopped by with someone before a movie and had a decent experience. The beef bulgogi was good but my buddy and I agreed there was no strong flavor. The soup I ordered was pretty good but the pork belly was pretty chewy and there was a small bone inside. We also tried chicken wings, which were surprisingly crispy and covered in delicious sauce. The service was fine. We did not check out the karaoke rooms and could not hear the singing but they were very close to the tables, which is interesting."}
{"text":"I had a very bad experience here. My boyfriend and I went to this place because one of our friend recommended us to go. However, their services are terrible. After we found a seat, no one came to ask us anything for 10 mins. Then we went for asking for some warm water and saw if we could start to order something. The waitress wrote down the dishes we wanted and then never came back to us for 20 mins. People came after us got their dishes ready before us and you can tell easily that they spoke Korean. We went to ask when our dishes will be ready. The guy in the front desk told us that it should be very soon. Then we wait for another 10 mins and asked him again. He went to the kitchen and said whatever things that I completely don't understand (of course, coz I don't speak Korean.) and then came back to me saying that we need to wait for another 5 mins. We started to realized that they never truly started cooking our dishes!!!!! I have never saw a restaurant has services like this before. Very unfriendly to people don't know how to speak Korean!"}
{"text":"It only got two stars because I enjoyed the karaoke machine and it had a lot of songs that I wanted to sing. It's pretty updated for popular songs that we listen to in 2014.

Other than that, prices on food and karaoke are overpriced. The waiter wasn't friendly with us and barely came to our room to offer us water or to provide us customer service. 

Every time my friend tries to go find our waiter, he would always be lounging around with other Koreans or giving other Koreans better service than us. 

The food took over a half an hour to be served and some of the food was already cold. Definitely don't wanna come back here again."}
{"text":"So having lived in Austin for 5 years now, I am very spoiled when it comes to private karaoke and this place just doesn't cut it. 

While the cost of renting the room out is not so bad, you are not allowed to bring any food or drink (even water!) in without paying a fee or buying food/drink from them. This wouldn't be as outrageous if their prices weren't outrageous. I cannot say the quality of said food and drink since we refused to purchase any. 

We've always gotten stuck in the back room which is apparently one of the largest but is still fairly cramped. 
The song selection is pretty decent and we were able to find a TON of songs to sing and dance to, even recent hit songs within the last couple months.

Another weird thing. There's a window on the door so the employees can walk by and look in whenever they want. I'm sure this is partly for security or so they can peep on you and make sure you haven't snuck in your own food or drink, but it's a bit unnerving and sort of takes away from the whole privacy feel.  

I'll still go here if only because this is the only korean karaoke place in the Champaign area that I know of.."}
{"text":"Was definitely not happy with my experience here. I've been to many many karaoke places and this one is pretty low on the list. 

I was in town with my cousins and we were really in the mood for karaoke and drinks! We walked in and the guy in the front was short (attitude) when he spoke to us. No greeting, just kind of stared and spun around and walked off to find us a room when we asked if they had one available for 8 people. He disappears down a long, extremely dark hallway, us unsure of it we should follow since he didn't ask us to. He came back out after a minute and said, 'Room 8.' We finally found it after briefly feeling like we were in a horror movie. 

I'm not sure if karaoke places are run differently in Illinois, but I thought it was weird when no one came to greet us in the room and ask for drinks or food or anything. Eventually, my brother went back out to get us a bottle of liquor, and he came back to tell us they \"didn't serve bottles\" and, \"he would need to see everyone's ID.\" ... First off: What? Who doesn't serve entire bottles of liquor? Especially if you already sell shots/drinks? Secondly: If you don't serve bottles (or won't serve one to us), why would you need to see everyone's ID? What sense does that make? 
 
We had to go back and forth all night ordering and taking shots at the bar, which was a HUGE hassle for us all. Definitely a buzz kill when we just wanted to sit and drink and sing. 

Speaking of singing, the song selection is TERRIBLE. There's about 4 entire pages of Reba, but hardly any up-to-date songs. I don't even like the radio, but I would've gladly taken some newer artists over the genres this place had. No doubt about it, this place is geared towards specific clientele. It took me ages of flipping through their torn apart, sticky song books to find anything worth singing.

The only reason it has 2 stars is because the drinks were cheap (compared to back home) so it mended my mood a bit. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would.  The prices are higher than most Korean places in town.  Once they seat you, the waitress grabs a water and asks you immediately if you know what you want.  I did not and she left me waiting.  I would comment on the food, but after 30 minutes of no service I left for a place with real service.  The place was 1/2 empty.  The wait staff just does not care about the customer.   Unless you speak korean, avoid this place like the plague."}
{"text":"nice sweet potato pizza which I strongly recommend"}
{"text":"Allow me to share my Star Karaoke adventure.  During a trip to the Savoy 16 Theater, I spotted this strange building as I was pulling into the lot.  From a distance, I could only make out the more prominent part of the building's sign: \"BBQ & PIZZA.\"  I shrugged it off as a typical family restaurant, but a friend told me later that it was actually a Korean karaoke place.  This piqued my interest.  With an upcoming birthday, I thought I would investigate Star Karaoke as a potential venue, especially as I have an appreciation for quirky spots.

After some investigation through the Internet, I was able to confirm that Star Karaoke was a true Asian karaoke place; that is, the setup they offer is not the standard single stage that you see in American bars.  Instead, the building holds many separate \"booths,\" or small enclosed rooms.  Each room has the requisite big screen TV and equipment (microphones, song lists, etc.) so you can fulfill your karaoke dreams.  If you're someone who is easily embarrassed by your singing abilities, this is an ideal setup as you can karaoke with your friends in the comfort of a private booth.

I also found a \"food list\" while searching the Internet.  Do not expect to find American-style barbecue and pizza if you come here; all of the food is made with Asian cooking techniques and flavors.  According to one website, Star Karaoke sold food items like \"ricecakes covered in lava.\"  Yikes?

I called a week in advance to reserve a booth for my birthday celebration.  With a party of 10, the employee offered us their largest booth, which cost something like $40 per hour.  The price seemed pretty expensive, but was not too bad if you consider splitting it between 10 people.  For whatever room you intend to rent, just anticipate paying around $4 to $6 per person.

When we got there, she led us to our booth, which had a large table, plenty of seating, and a miniature disco ball on the ceiling.  (Don't forget that these are still fairly small rooms, so prepare to get cozy.)  For anyone interested in just trying the food (not the karaoke), I also saw a separate, large dining area that I assume is for dinner guests only.  

We ordered beer and several dishes to share, including bulgolgi (Korean-style barbecue), sweet potato pizza, seafood pancakes, and the previously mentioned \"ricecakes covered in lava.\"  Most of it was pretty mediocre and did not stand out too much in my mind.  The sweet potato pizza was interesting, though the cheese and crust were a bit hard and bland, a pretty amateur attempt at pizza.  I enjoyed the seafood pancake with its crispy edges and flavorful dipping sauce (I think it was everyone's favorite dish).  Unfortunately, nobody really wanted to touch the ricecakes covered in lava, which was indeed spicy, but also tasted a little weird and came with a single, huge boiled egg (?).  

Although this karaoke venue is owned by Asians, the provided song lists had both Korean and American tracks.  I didn't look at the Korean list, but the American song list was pretty extensive (probably 300+ songs) and had all of the favorite karaoke tunes, including (surprisingly) some pretty recent hit songs from the previous months.  The equipment was easy to use and the staff only interrupted us to deliver food, pick up dirty dishes, and take additional orders.

Overall, the experience was a good one and while I would consider going back for another celebration, I probably wouldn't make this a permanent hangout on Friday nights.  I docked points mostly because the facilities seemed a little outdated and the food wasn't too exciting.  For anyone who hasn't had the Asian karaoke experience, though, I would suggest trying Star Karaoke at least once."}
{"text":"This was the worst experience of my life. First we walked in and the server asked how many. We answered 5, they then asked if we wanted a karaoke room for 35$ an hour, we told them we just wanted to eat. The server then brings us to a room despite all of these tables that were still open in the main dining. The room looked like a closet and had stuff all over it and a huge table. We asked her if we can eat in the dining room instead and she rolled her eyes at us, huffed and then dropped the menus on a table. We sit down confused like, what is happening. That's when we realize we are the only black and white people in the whole place. I read a previous review that if you are white you won't get service, i thought that person was being sensitive but now I realize it was true. And obviously true if you are black as well. Basically, If you aren't Korean they don't want to serve you. So we sit there and brush it off. 20 minutes go by and the server is ONLY SERVING THE KOREAN PEOPLE. They didn't even drop waters on the table. So we decide to leave and as we're walking out my boyfriend notices the server celebrate us leaving by saying \"yes!\" And  shaking his fist. So my bf asked him what that was about and he tries to make up some excuse and my bf tells him he's not supposed to treat people this way, the other servers come to that guys defense and basically justify what was done. 

Anyway, it's pretty upsetting to be treated this way. Because of the color of our skin they wanted to turn away our business, I don't usually think like that but there's no other excuse in my mind that would make sense as to why that all happened. Needless to say, this place looks like a broken down chuckee cheese and the menu is hardly authentic Korean fare with expensive pricing. Please save yourself the discrimination and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Fried chicken is the best! and the staff there all really nice as well. I left my wallet there and they kept that for me till I went back for it!"}
{"text":"Good place for eating before movies. Nice fried chicken, pizza, and hot pots. Noisy since the door of karaoke never closed. You could hear people singing during the meal."}
{"text":"I keep forgetting how expensive this place is! I'm still exactly unsure how the pricing breaks down but every time I've been here with friends, I end up spending $20-$30 more than I expect. The food is pretty good. I recommend getting the various korean style omelettes. I forget what they're called."}
{"text":"We stopped by here before going to a movie and its obvious the place's focus is the Karaoke. It was very busy and as a result we were only able to eat one of the dishes we ordered, before we had to cancel the rest due to needing to get to the movies. 
We had the bul go ki chicken was just so-so. I think a few pieces had the texture like it was not fully cooked (possibly thigh instead of breast). Though we definitely checked and it was not pink.
So if you are looking to enjoy karaoke with friends and have time, I imagine this place is great (most people going for karaoke see to have ordered pizza and wings), but definitely not if you are on a schedule."}
{"text":"like the food kinda expensive for what it is.
but if your white...american.
the service will be slow as hell and once you get your food...forget it your have to wave yell practically tackle the \"service\" to bring you more fill your water or even give you the check. last time there i got no service and got up and left...sad...sad.
i like the chicken and pickled diacon radish but not at the point of being humiliated im s&m but not that bad.."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery and it was only \"ok\" if not bad. I spent over $30 and I ordered fried dumplings and Sam Gyup Sal Kim Chi Bok Eum. The person who answered my call said the Sam Gyup Sal Kim Chi Bok Eum could easily fill two, but when I received it, it couldn't even fill me up. Furthermore, I ordered fried dumplings but I got steamed instead. The next time I come, it won't be for the food. Maybe for the karaoke experience (but heard it wasn't that good as well)."}
{"text":"It's the combination of karaoke and restaurant. It's really cheap compare with other Korean restaurant and karaoke. You can have food while singing. My favorites are Kimchi hotpot and fried chicken."}
