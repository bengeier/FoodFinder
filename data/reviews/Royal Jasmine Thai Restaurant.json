{"text":"We had the red curry and the spicy noodles, which were both great. The prices were also great at this place. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Really good chicken pad tai! Been twice and loved the food. Great portions as well! The pot stickers are very yummy and so are the spring rolls with a side of peanut sauce and ragoons. Must try!"}
{"text":"This was terrible enough to make me finally use yelp.  Long wait time for service, proportions did not match price nor did the quality.  Rice was terribly overcooked, little to no meat in dishes. Hard to find location.  Experience did not match the higher reviews on urban spoon.  The waitresses were nice though when they actually came around.  Restaurant was only half full so the delays on service were not warranted"}
{"text":"They have an amazing Thai iced tea. Pair this with some shrimp rolls and a pork salad for an amazing hot weather meal. Service was great.  Rolls were made while we were in the restaurant instead of the day before like at most places. Super fresh ingredients!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food we've had in AZ!   We were there mid afternoon so it was not crowded.  We had both red and green curry - they were both fabulous!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The food is authentic and very quick! Yummy!! This is my go-to place for Thai in Goodyear... I highly recommend the Drunken Noodles, as well as any of their curries (yellow is my favorite!)"}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times and every dish I've tried is excellent.  Great pricing and friendly service.  Will definitely be back many more times!"}
{"text":"Their food is so delicious! We eat here several times a month! Whether we are dining in or taking out, the food is always hot and ready to go. I love their yellow chicken curry and my dad always gets the pumpkin curry. All of their dishes look amazing! TRY NOW!"}
{"text":"My fav in the area! Decent prices.  Nice atmosphere. Perfect for takeout too. Hubby and I usually ordered two items and shared.  You can even just order appetizers and share. Nice portions."}
{"text":"We started with the free egg rolls with a yelp check-in & I usually have one bite and leave the rest but I ate the whole thing & right now am wondering how pathetic it would look to dig the last one out of our to-go bag. We frequently order the same things which is phad-see-ewe, Penang curry & green curry all were fresh made and excellent. A bit spicy for the mild dish but this will be our new favorite Thai place along with Sala Thai (but you have to get to go from them because the landlord won't fix the smell in the building.   Thanks Royal Jasmine see you soon."}
{"text":"Wonderful Mother's Day at Royal Jasmine.  Thai food craving sufficed!  We really like the orange chicken.  It was quite busy but the 3 waitresses worked non-stop.  We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Coconut milk soup and curry are perfect for curing colds. Our family loves this place!"}
{"text":"If you like Thai food, this is the perfect place. Every dish we had was perfect and the service was great! Recommend the yellow curry!"}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week to get my fix for the Yellow curry with chicken, it has got to be the creamiest most savory yellow curry I've had here in AZ.  Their soups are also very good and their Pad Thai is better than most places.  The only problem I have is that their serving sizes are too small....I am almost always left fighting the urge to lick the bowl when I finish."}
{"text":"I read such great reviews so I was excited to try it.  We ordered take out.  The Pad Thai was bland.  I had to add salt.  To Asian food!  That never happens.  The rice noodles were over cooked.    I ordered chicken and plain rice for my 10 year old.  The chicken was like shoe leather.  Terrible.   I gave it to our dogs and they choked on it!  No lie.  I gave it two stars because the Crab Rangoon was edible."}
{"text":"I am obsessed with this place. Could eat here every day.  Definitely a must visit if in the area."}
{"text":"My boyfriend introduced me to this place a few months ago, and it is the best.  The curry dishes are amazing.  Service is great they know our order by heart.  Tucked away in a random strip mall in Goodyear you would never know it was here.  Do yourself a favor and check this place out."}
{"text":"Food was good but service lacked. We sat with empty water glasses until the very end of the meal while we watched her attend to every other table numerous times. To make it worse my husband had the hot red curry, water would have been nice. But she was nice."}
{"text":"My wife and I keep on coming back to this place since its much closer to home and its authentic. We already tried their pad thai, mus sa mun, pa-nang and spicy fried rice. It was almost the same as what we've tasted in Thailand. Their lunch selection specials tastes good too!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Excellent Thai food - the green and red curry are my favorites.  One of the few decent restaurants in Goodyear."}
{"text":"I had take out from here last night. The chicken pad Thai had dry strips of reddish chicken that I was barely able to chew. There were two black chunks of some unknown substance. They sort of looked like burnt, opened pistachio shells. I was so hoping I would love this place. I won't go there for pad Thai again."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food I have ever had. We had stir fry with beef yellow curry chicken and roasted duck. All were fantastic. Will be back to try new dishes."}
{"text":"I recommend the grilled pot stickers. The Pad Thai and the green vegetable curry was freshly prepared and delicious. We finished the meal with mangos and sticky rice...Absolutely excellent.  Overall the service was very prompt and courteous. They clearly took pride in their service and food.  I will be back soon."}
{"text":"I ordered the pad Thai with chicken with a 4 out of 5 spicyness.. I came home to just pad Thai and about three pieces of chicken and NO SPICY. I am disappointed that I paid 9 dollars for just carbs!"}
{"text":"If I can give zero star I would. This restaurant is so terrible. We sat down for over 10 minutes, no one came to service us. No water or a menu. When this place is busy, they don't know how to handle and they froze. One waitress kept staring at the computer screen, and the 2nd waitress only stayed around the front area. Only one waitress seems to be running around and she seems overwhelmed. They all seemed it was a bother to come to the back of the restaurant. We left after 15 minutes with no service. Terrible! We will never come back here because how we were treated. We told our friends how great this place was and we felt so bad what they witnessed that night with us. There are other Thai restaurants around the area that will treat you better."}
{"text":"First time here. Food was excellent and the wait staff attentive and courteous. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"We were very pleased with our visit here.  We had heard so much about this place, we thought we would give it a try.  We shared the tempura vegetables, and he had chicken pot stickers and sweet and sour chicken.  I had the vegetable soup with seaweed in it.  Everything was delicious!  The service was great, and so was the atmosphere.  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Hidden treasure! The place has a unique decor and the food is so delicious! Never had Thai prior to coming here. I recommend the red curry lunch, and the Tom Khu Kai soup (2 hotness)."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious, and wonderful service. I'm SO glad this restaurant is so close by, for those seemingly random times where I'm suddenly craving their food. I'll absolutely be coming back soon."}
{"text":"The food was good.  I asked for them to make it spicy but they forgot to put in the hot stuff.  I had to do it my self.  that was very disappointing."}
{"text":"We go to Royal Jasmine about 3 times a month. Always consistent, so friendly. Love their Pumpkin Curry, fresh rolls, and any of the stir fried veggie dishes. A fun place to visit on the West Side!"}
{"text":"We asked to sit on the patio and were told that we couldn't. We asked why and were told, \"Dirty\". From what we could see it wasn't dirty at all. Even if it was dirty, CLEAN IT so we can enjoy dinner on the patio that is advertised. We left to another Thai restaurant..."}
{"text":"Two thumbs up!  Best Panang Curry I've had in years. My wife loved the Tom Ka Gai soup,  says it's the best she's EVER had (and she's been to Thailand twice). Nice people,  too. We'll be back."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write a review about this place for a while. This i my and my co-workers go to place for lunch. I've tried several of their dishes and can honestly say there's maybe 1 or 2 that I didn't love. The curry is great (red, yellow, and green). The lunch portions are filling and not expensive at all. Customer service is good and they have the best pot stickers I've had whether they are grilled, steamed or fried. The pot stickers come with some kind of sweet soy sauce that is the best. Kudos to this place, it'll definitely be one of the establishments I'll miss once I leave Arizona."}
{"text":"Really good Thai food in west valley. My husband loves the green curry and I really like the chicken pad Thai. Great cream cheese ragoons. Good prices!"}
{"text":"Our friend recommended for lunch.  Eight of us had lunch for the first time. I had red curry from dinner menu spicier.  It was great. Can't wait to come again and try their basil chicken."}
{"text":"This place is much better than the other Thai restaurants in the area. Super authentic, very reasonably priced, and the servers are friendly. Everything is always good so we come here whenever we feel adventurous and want to try a new Thai dish."}
{"text":"Best Thai/Vietnamese/Laos food place that we've had in this place so far. Service is quick and friendly and very helpful if your new to the style of food. The food is great and flavorful, pretty authentic as well. I highly recommend this place for someone looking for authentic Asian food"}
{"text":"The food was good, the service was fine but a little slow ( I think they were busier than expected). The teriyaki chicken my daughter ordered was good but more of a gravy sauce so it was different than expected. My son enjoyed the chicken noodle and my other son loved the pad see ew. My pad noh Mai chicken was good but not as good as other places."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and the size of the dishes can be shared between two persons. I will come back."}
{"text":"Our new favorite thai place. Fried rice was my favorite. Padthai and pad see ew with hot chili sauce was really good too! we also got the free fried wantons for checking in."}
{"text":"Nice quiet place with good food. My favorite Tom Yum soup around the valley. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"As a fellow server i'm a believer in tipping well when deserved. That being said i'm never received such a snotty service that I didn't want to tip at all. For half of our meal our server was talking on the phone while serving our table using hand signals. After our food came we waited a good fifteen minutes to wait for her to come by the table to ask for more rice but she never did. So I went up to to the front to interrupt her personal phone call to ask for more rice. She brought it. Then disappeared in the kitchen still on the phone. After we finished we sat for a good while before she brought our ticket. We love the place great food but when I have a server who is so unfriendly I want to leave as soon as my meal is over. Women like that should not be servers"}
{"text":"I love Royal Jasmine.   Excellent food.  My favorite is curry which is always fresh and hot."}
{"text":"Can't tell you if the food is any good, but service is HORRIBLE. Called to order 5 times no answer. Drove over. 5 people waiting for orders, she's answers phone in the middle of taking order, turns her back and doesn't acknowledge anyone for 10 minutes. Horrible service."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good Thai food when traveling in a new area.  We were fortunate to find the Royal Jasmine in Goodyear.  The food is excellent, the service superb. Clean, classy, casual.   It was such a good experience and the menu so varied that we went all 3 nights in town to the Royal Jasmine.  It's in a small, quiet, but attractive \"mall.\"  Closer than you might guess to the main street and hotels.   Worth every effort to locate.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was pretty excited when I saw how highly rated this restaurant is and even more excited when I called to order take out and they said my first choice for dinner was gluten free although the excitement ended there. When I arrived the order was just coming out. It was right on time so it was nice and hot when I got home. I ordered a few different dishes for my family, the pad thai, phad woon sen, and orange chicken along with the fresh vegetable rolls. It was my husbands first time eating thai food (he will not venture out) and he wanted to try the pad thai. He tasted it and said it was just ok. I couldn't resist and had a bite as well. He was right, it was just ok. It lacked flavor and the noodles were very sticky. For myself I ordered the phad woon sen and also found it lacked flavor. The vegetable rolls were very fresh indeed and my kids loved the sticky rice, they picked it up and took bites to eat it. That was all they liked. Sadly I would not try this restaurant again."}
{"text":"The venue was not what I thought it was. Decent food but, more fast food like than a place to sit, have a friendly conversation and relax."}
{"text":"Well sad to say this was not a good experience. I called and placed an order to go and was told it would be ready in 30 min. My husband arrived 10 min later to wait to pick up our food. He was on the phone with me so I have an exact wait time. After waiting 70 min we cancelled our order. There was no offer to accommodate us for this wait and he was given an attitude from the front desk lady when he cancelled it. SUPER disappointed."}
{"text":"Struggled a little when they opened but we tried a few more times and now we are very happy with take out.  They have been consistently good lately.  We usually get a curry dish and either padseeew or pad thai and we are happy with them all now.  I would give it more than 4 stars ( in its price category ) except we have not been completely sold on the dining room experience yet, and it seems like not quite enough white rice with the curry and we have to order an extra serving."}
{"text":"Now anyone who's read any of my reviews has seen me say over and over again, that me and my partner have big appetites.  We're not dainty eaters.  And so, it was with great anticipation, that we paid a visit to this restaurant after working out.  Perhaps that wasn't the smartest thing to do, since we're usually not so hungry after lifting.  Nevertheless, we ordered two Thai teas; the appetizer combo plate; a combo curry entree for me; the Penang Peanut curry for him.  The Thai teas were a little sweeter than I've had in other places, but sinfully delicious, nonetheless.  The appetizer combo for $11 was a surprise.  Frankly, I would have described it as \"Asian fusion\" rather than Thai, but that was hardly a problem.  I've had similar combo appetizers in other Thai places for the same amount of money and they hadn't had half the amount of food this one did.  I wasn't expecting to see tempura broccoli; and the fried scallops on the stick instead of beef was interesting and tasty.  The crab puffs actually had more than cream cheese in it and nothing was greasy, which you'd expect from a plate full of fried food.  Unfortunately, by the time we were done with the appetizers, we had to ask them to pack the entrees to go without even having had a forkful.  Back at home a few hours later, however, we dug in and can now report further.  The combo curry is so named, because it comes with three kinds of meat instead of the usual one.  You choose the curry color  (I chose red and hot).  It was indeed spicy, but not enough to drown out the tastes of the meat.  Perhaps, I would have wanted a little less sauce; but that didn't ruin anything at all.  My partner thought the Penang Peanut quite good.  The restaurant is located in a quiet corner of a mall.  We showed up there around 6pm on a Friday and it was not packed.  Service was quick and friendly, as well as efficient.  The decoration is simple, but doesn't distract from your dining experience.  I must say, that, overall, this restaurant deserves the very positive reviews it's been getting.  I am constantly surprised at the quality of restaurants here in Goodyear.  You wouldn't expect such skill and service in the middle of nowhere.  Then again, with the economy slowly getting better, it may just be that the bullet we dodged five years ago, when they wanted to make Goodyear a metropolis in the desert, may just be boomeranging back and maybe we'll be seeing more such restaurants soon.  Oh, and it doesn't hurt that the place is open til 10pm on Fridays and Saturdays.  So nice not to have to drive all the way to \"the city\" for a late meal, isn't it?"}
{"text":"We ate here at least 10 times before finding out it is one of a few restaurants in the west valley that failed health inspection.   Food is good though..  Compare to other Thai restaurants around.  4 stars for the food but sorry keeping it clean is more important."}
{"text":"OMG!! My mom and I went here today after reading the reviews.  The food is amazing!  The owners were so nice, the lady told us the chef has been cooking Thai for over 35 years.  We had the Chicken satay and fried potstickers...peanut sauce was delish.  Chicken was tender.  I had the beef pad thai....my mouth was happy!  My mom had #46, it was a yellow beef curry dish, which was also very good.  I had the coconut ice cream.  It's homemade, and tastes like coconut ice milk and it was very tasty!  I'm normally not a big fan of coconut but this won me over!  Prices were very reasonable.  Definitely check this place out if you want great Thai food!"}
{"text":"Took family in from out of town.  We all love Thai - I can't believe I have not been before!  It is easily the best Thai on this side of town and probably can go toe to toe with whatever else is out there.  The Tom Yung soup was awesome - great balance of flavors.  The red curry is addictive.  We were there for their first anniversary and all received complimentary dessert to boot!  yum!!"}
{"text":"Nice location, and nice decor. Clean restaurant with polite helpful waitresses. Food here is amazing, especially due to the fact that they can make certain items without fish sauce and oyster sauce. The wontons and red curry are my favorite here. Rice portions could be larger."}
{"text":"This is a little jewel off the beaten path.  Love their lunches!  We have been here often.  Love the Orange Chicken and the Thai Pad Chicken.  The staff is friendly and the restaurant is cozy and happy.  Try it!  This is a wonderful restaurant!"}
{"text":"The food was taste but was cold. The service wasn't very good. They didn't check back to see if we wanted anything until we were almost finished eating. We would have had soy sauce, it want on the table. We couldn't get the servers attention to ask for anything don't  think I'll be back."}
{"text":"Delicious! Ordered tom yum tale, pad see ew, chicken satay, shrimp balls and orange chicken. All were delcious!  Originally from Cali and I have been trying to look for a very good thai place... Finally found it. Tried Line Thai and Thai Orchid. This one is my fav and will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We have been to this restaurant many times now and it is always delicious ! The service is great and the price is right. I crave this place often, Yum!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed on the taste of the Tom Yum Gung, flavor was bland. Pad Se Ew, as well needed more flavor, and it was oily. Fried rice, very oily, see pic. The one thing I did enjoy was the yellow curry.  Sorry to say, this is a restaurant I would not recommend.  Hope they improve."}
{"text":"I had lunch here and enjoyed the $7.95 lunch special. No complaints about portion size, even at such a great deal. I got the Chicken Pad Thai, which was just ok. The sauce had an orange color I've never seen on Pad Thai, and a bit of a citrus taste. It was very light on egg. Probably wouldn't order again"}
{"text":"Visiting Phoenix for the first time and find this restaurant nearby Goodyear subdivision. The restaurant is located in a strip mall.  We have appetizer combination to start, fish ball is tasty, deep fried broccoli and eggplant is a bit crunchy. House salad with peanut dressing is good. Pad Thai is a tad bit on the sour side. Overall the meal is good.  Service is excellent, waitress is attentive. Always check on our water and tea refill."}
{"text":"This local restaurant has great food that can be prepared Vegan, organic, and with meat. So much easier to deal with my food allergies when a restaurant is this thoughtful. Great service too!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Royal Jasmine Thai because of it's proximity and a promotion we had. The description for the restaurant stated: \"We greet our guests with Sawasdee ka? our traditional greeting in Thailand meaning hello, welcome, how are you & farewell.\" Nope! We were not greeted at all and were immediately seated.   The groups that were seated after us were waited on first. It took about 40 minutes for our appetizers to come out. How long does it take to fry tofu? We almost cancelled our chicken wings because the tofu took so long to come out. We figured we'd get our entrees soon. Nope! Good thing we had two appetizers to munch on.  Almost an hour into being seated we finally received our entrees. We chose pork for the pineapple fried rice. At first we couldn't tell if it was chicken or pork. The pork we're used to is the BBQ one. Either way it didn't matter because it was super bland. The chicken pad woon sen was not any better. We actually didn't eat any of the chicken because it tasted like boil pieces.  If you're okay with mediocre food and horrible service, then settle for this Thai place in the middle of nowhere."}
{"text":"Came here recently for the first time with visiting family. The food was delicious and very affordable. We plan on coming back for more very soon!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Took my wife on a date and was more than what we expected. Service was unusually good! And the food was really good. I am glad that we now have found a place close to home that we can enjoy good Thai food. Pad-see-ew was excellent."}
{"text":"Ordered the Red Curry lunch special, 'Thai' hot. It had a nice spice to it, not overpowering the flavor. I plan to try the Double Thai Hot next time I am in.   Service was great, I drink Iced Tea pretty damn fast, I never had to wait long for a refill.   The curry wasn't runny, like many other Thai restaurants. It has a nice consistency. The fried spring rolls were tasty.  We also tried the home made ice cream with fried banana. It was a coconut ice cream and it was excellent.   I'll be sure to come back, this is my new favorite Thai place in the west valley!"}
{"text":"Good food, clean, and good service. Will visit again. Try the Spicy Noodles - it is similar to the Drunken Noodles. Also had the Yellow Curry and Thai Toast.  All good!"}
{"text":"Decor is very nice and clean. In a small shopping center/business center. They also have a patio that looks pretty with little lights. The food is great. We have ordered Tom Ka Kha (sp) soup (coconut tom yum soup), pahd see ew, pahd thai and panang. I did not prefer the pahd thai but my husband loved it. Everything else I thought was very delicious and flavorful. Their service was spot on, always with a smile. We've returned several times here and have never been disappointed. They have $2 domestic beer during their happy hour which is also cool. :)"}
{"text":"Came her because my boyfriend wanted to try it out. Had their pad Thai but got dry very quickly and wasn't very appetizing."}
{"text":"I come here ALL the time for pumpkin curry. A lot of Thai restaurants I've been to in the area don't even have pumpkin curry on the menu so I'm glad Royal Jasmine has it. I honestly would eat it everyday if I could. The food can be a little pricey, but that aside the food is always good and the service is always friendly!"}
{"text":"We were on a mission to find a lard nha dish that is comparable to restaurants in California, but I think we took a step back in our search with this place I ordered the lard nha and it was way too peppery and the broccoli was bitter. I couldn't finish my food. I don't think we will be back. Only upside was the service was good."}
{"text":"We have been here in the restaurant and then we did take out tonight and we really like this place. We ordered the Pad Thai, one of the curry dishes and some spring rolls and they were all great. I love having another option for take out. Our food was ready in 20 minutes and we will be eating here again."}
{"text":"Called and ordered 2 chicken Phad Thai dishes for the hub and myself for dinner lastnight, asked for it to be \"medium\" spicey. We had never eaten here before, as its fairly new. Picked the food up, very nice lady rang it up. Beautiful interior of the place. Brought the food home, dug in. It was delicious! Fresh, full of flavor. The hubs and I were both pleased. Can't wait to go back and try a curry dish!"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I just moved to Goodyear and were excited to start trying some of the restaurants in the area. We ate at Royal Jasmine Thai for the first and only time last night (2-7-14.) We walked in and were told to seat ourselves at a booth right by the door. We sat there for about 10 minutes without anyone acknowledging us in anyway. We were actually discussing whether or not we should just leave when a girl finally came over to take a drink order. Someone else brought over our two sodas a few minutes later. A little bit later the first girl came back and took our food order. We ordered an appetizer and two entrees which ranged from good (not great) to not good at all. A third person brought our food out after a while, and that was the last time a staff member actually came to our table. We ate the entire meal with empty sodas, no knife (only 1 fork each to eat with), and an entrée I couldn't eat. I ate my rice and some of the appetizer waiting for someone to come over to we could ask for refills, a different entrée, and a knife to eat what we did have. My fiancé ended up finishing his entrée and we decided we were just done. At this point, since no one had been to our table since the food was brought out I looked at the time on my phone. After a full TWENTY-FIVE minutes passed (which has to be at least 35 minutes with no one coming to the table to check on us), I got up and walked up to a staff member at the bar and requested our check and complained. She did apologize and take the entrée I didn't eat off our check. She also offered a complimentary dessert, but we declined since we didn't want to sit at the booth another 30 minutes.  My fiancé and I agreed it is the worst dining experience we've ever had together. We will not be back."}
{"text":"I completely disagree with the price range... the lunch special was perfectly portioned and only cost $7.  I had the red curry with chicken, thai hot. It was the perfect level of spice and flavor. The homemade ice cream with fried banana is the perfect afternoon treat.  Everyone in our group had a great experience and enjoyed what they ordered."}
{"text":"Get your Chicken Pad Thai \"Thai Spicy\" and get ready for one of the greatest things you'll eat on the West side.  Wife and I eat here 2-3 times a month, have found you do get a more consistent product when dining in because they seem to get the spice level wrong often when getting to go...  Wife likes Mild and I like HOT and typically both meals are one or the other when to go.  Maybe we've just been unlucky there.  Ate there 2 weeks ago and it might have been the best meal I had eaten there yet.  Love this place!"}
{"text":"Pad keem mow( please excuse spelling)  Drunken Noodles! or on their menu- spicy noodles my personal fav- looks, smells and tastes great!  Definitely a hidden gem"}
{"text":"Not a really Thai Food lover but this food was excellent! Great service & great food!"}
{"text":"If my wife would let me eat here 7 nights a week I would. :)  Love the curry's (Panang and Pumpkin are my favs), love the fried rice, loved the Pad Thai, love the soups, love it all.  Best Thai restaurant I've every tried."}
{"text":"The food deserves 5 stars but the service 3 stars.  It wasn't bad but the poor waitress had her work cut out for her with quite a few patrons to tend to.  She also had quite the accent but that doesn't bother me ... makes it all the more authentic.  It just makes ordering a little ... adventurous.  Food was AWESOME.  We had the pad na (big noodles) and it's one of the best we ever had.  We also ordered the pumpkin curry which the hubby thoroughly enjoyed.  A little on the spicy end but of course that's all relative.  We also had the bbq pork and that is probably one of the best I've ever had.  Most places the pork is brown but this place it was white and so so tender!  They even drizzled some of the bbq sauce on it which usually you do not see.  At least I haven't.  The decor is nice and service was decent as long as you come in with a positive attitude.  Big cups for water which is also a plus!  We will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Eat here!!! Delicious curry soup, and pad Thai! I recommend you don't miss this place. Soooo good."}
{"text":"This is your typical Thai place. They serve a good amount considering the price. I got their eggplant entree and it tasted really good and was made very well."}
{"text":"Being from NY I am skeptical of any Chinese, Thai etc. I was very happy with my Red curry chicken. tasted just like my favorite Thai place in NYC!"}
{"text":"The food was just like all Thai restaurants. That was fine. The service was not at all fine. I had to ask foe WATER twice. We waited about 30 min to order the food. Waited another 30 for the appetizers. Maybe it was an off night for the establishment. Whatever it was it was not because they were busy. There was a total of 10-15 customers there. If I had a choice, I would not go to this place again."}
{"text":"Good food and decent service. I usually order food to go. The red curry with vegetables is delicious!"}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant yesterday during lunch. Ordered the Pad Thai, with vegetables. I am a HUGE Pad Thai fan, and am always skeptical with a new restaurant. The Pad Thai was absolutely delicious, and had lots of veggies in it. Service was excellent. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"So, we had a dinner there 2 days ago. I tried   The chicken with green curry. It was good just need more vegi in my opinion. The desert was good . Nice atmosphere, friendly waitress."}
{"text":"Yum. There is nothing less than excellent at this place. We had the pad Thai, red curry, egg rolls, and a soup. All excellent. Great lunch specials, includes soup or salad and an egg roll for 6.95. Really nice service too."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Great lunch specials for under $7. I'm already looking forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite things to do is go out to dinner and find someplace that I've never been to before. Thai food is a guilty pleasure of mine, and I can be picky about the food. My first meal is always the same, Chicken Satay, Green Curry and Pepper Steak. Boring I'm sure, but I don't care what you think.   Royal Jasmine's Satay is good, nothing better or worse than what I've had elsewhere. The sweet and sour is outstanding though, it has a pronounced herbal note, the parsley adds more to this than most. The green curry was very good, at a medium spiciness it doesn't overwhelm the rest of the flavors. Pepper Steak here is another story. Rich, flavorful, savory, delicious. This is the first time I've ever reconsidered ordering the curry for myself. It's the best I've ever had. Often the steak is overcooked, being tough and chewy, not here. The meat practically melted in my mouth. The vegetables were crisp, not soggy and there was plenty.  This is a great place to go eat."}
{"text":"A few months ago we were craving Thai so we looked for a nearby spot and decided on this one. It was busy when we got there so we expected a wait but after sitting at the table for over 10 minutes before a waiter appeared our hopes were getting less. After asking a second time for our drinks it took another 20 minutes for our food, but only my children and husband got theirs. I had to flag someone down to get mine. I ordered brown rice with my meal and got white but at this point my 5 1/2 and 2 1/2 yr old children were getting restless so I finished my food then my husband got in line to pay without a ticket. All in all it took over an hour. We are very understanding patrons, but will not be back unless we are without our children."}
{"text":"Writing this review as it's fresh in my memory. Family ordered the following: shrimp spring roll, fish cakes, sticky noodles, spicy rice and orange chicken.  Pros: the orange chicken was incredibly good! Best I've had in a while.  Cons: SERVICE SUCKED our server was inexperienced, had to get up multiple times just to get things like soy sauce, sugar, ask for napkins. It was ridiculous. Party of 4 and we get two plates for the apps.  Fish cakes  just gross. The rest of the food was just simply okay nothing memorable. I don't know how this place has so many good reviews. Unless people only order the orange chicken! Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great place to eat.  Many great menu options.  Don't be afraid of the strip mall.  Good restaurant.  Great service. I had the curry and loved it.  West valley does not have many options.  This is a good one."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's always clean,  great service,  great food,  and great Thai tea. The orange chicken is really good too. We eat here often!"}
{"text":"This rating would have been a 4.... but the service was unorganized and the 1 poor girl who was working on Wednesday night was trying the best she could.   Had a group of 8 people... we all got served different dishes anywhere in a 15 minute period so no one got to eat together.. plus our rice was brought out nearly 10 mins of our main dish.     Luckily the girl who served us was super polite and appologetic... and we are a very slow laid back crew.     The food was good.  Warning for the weak stomached.... dont do spicy unless you want spicy... mild was spicy enough for most.   I had the duck curry.  It was very very fatty. but the rest of the food was good."}
{"text":"First off - I want to thank all of the previous Yelp reviewers for their past reviews! This restaurant was great! The food was fresh, delicious and well priced. The ambiance and service were stellar. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Thailand revisited with my daughter, Cay. This summer, we went to Thailand for a week and a half. Today, after a doctor's appointment, we noticed that Royal Jasmine Thai was next door. After looking at Yelp reviews, we decided to give it a shot. Indeed, their lunch Specials menu was a nice package. $8.25 with soup, egg roll and potsticker with entree. We also checked in the appetizers and saw they had our favorite, tob man or Thai fish cakes with cucumber and peanut sweet sauce, so we ordered that as well.  The ambiance was quiet and lovely. We did see a lot of families in there. The waitstaff was pleasant. Our waitress was shocked when we practiced our Thai with her. We our ordered our food phet nip noi or a little spicy.  Our fish cake was as good as we've ever had in the United States. The cucumber sauce was really well prepared and perfect with the fish cakes. Our egg roll was prepared in a way that would be typical of a Chinese fast food and under seasoned. Fortunately, the sauce they gave was Thai sweet and spicy and not a Chinese restaurant sweet red sauce. The potsticker had a nice filling with pork and shrimp. The soup was an unremarkable vegetable and ground meat soup. The Panang Chicken was lovely with a nutty and thick gravy. Sadly, we didn't get enough rice to curry. Finally, my daughter liked the sweeter pad Thai while it was okay and better than most other places I have tried so far.  I think I will come back for the fish cakes and try more dishes. Did I tell you I had fun practicing Thai with our waitress."}
{"text":"Came here for their $9.95 lunch special, really good curry and pretty great service, also had $3 sapporo's for their happy hour."}
{"text":"Go! Run! And, don't hesitate to enjoy the delicious curry pumpkin dish I had at Royal Jasmine Thai. The blend of curry , coconut milk and spices was a delight over brown rice for my palate. As I write this, I long to return for seconds!!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I just had dinner here. We both enjoyed our meals and egg roll appetizer. The coconut ice cream with sticky rice and sprinkled with nuts was the highlight of our meal, as it was our first time experiencing. Now it's a favorite and we look forward to another great meal!"}
{"text":"Great Thai the best I have found on the west side of the valley. Small but nice decor and good service.  They do have a patio with a nice view of the sunset over the white tank mountains.  Their soups, noodles and curry dishes are supreme."}
{"text":"Not sure why I waited so long to try this place out. It is a hidden gem in Litchfield Park with all the positives. Seems to be some tight parking for all the businesses in the small area but I always seem to find easy parking. Very welcoming and nice staff promptly seat you although the seating arrangement doesn't really appeal to me much. I hate the small tables that are directly next to another couple. Makes you feel like they are a part of your lunch or dinner as they can easily engage in your conversation. The food is great and so far, everything I've ordered has been awesome. Try the orange chicken that has a very unique flavor unlike any I've had. A new favorite dish I found is a first for me found here, the Tom Yum. Caution on ordering this with extra spice. If you like spicy, ordering medium spicy is just fine. You will break a sweat! First fish I had here was the seafood salad and that was also incredible. Nothing held back on their dishes and they serve to impress. Prices are low to medium with plenty of choices on the menu. I recommend this place if you're looking to sit down and enjoy some good Asian food in the west valley or anywhere in the greater Phoenix area. I would say it's worth the drive if you're on the east side."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food and very tasty. Every dish we had was good. The service was good. The waitresses were pleasant and helpful."}
{"text":"My wife and I love this place! Beautiful Food and the service is fantastic! We eat here almost every week. We live on the west side but it's worth the drive from anywhere in the valley!"}
{"text":"Love love love the Thai food here. It is the best Thai food here in the NW valley. We eat here often and my hubby is full Thai, he also says its authentic and delicious. Everything we have ordered is delicious, a little pricey but well worth it. Recommendations would be to make a better happy hour menu and drink menu is to steep. Other than that the service is awesome as well as the cuisine."}
{"text":"Have been to this Thai place a few items... their Tom yum soup never disappoints.. you can order the level of spicy you would like in most of their dishes. last time I ordered take out and placed a side order of noodles.. oh my so much better with noodles and beef on the soup. Tried the paid Thai and I could survive without it lol their spicy noodles and pineapple fried rice are also very good. I still look forward to eating here. Lol"}
{"text":"Although the service wasn't great, the food was phenomenal! Definitely the best Pork Pad Thai I've had in a long time! The sauce was very flavorful and not too spicy. The menu is very robust, so there's something for just about everyone (including French fries and onion rings for the picky eaters).   Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"My hubby and I got away from the kiddos for a little bit last Friday night and decided to finally eat here. We walked in and were greeted and seated right away. We checked in with Yelp and received a free appetizer, we chose the fried wontons. They were light, crispy, hot and the sweet and sour sauce was tasty. We ordered the chicken pad Thai and the Larb salad with beef. We asked for both medium. The Larb is by far my favorite Thai dish. It is so complex in flavor and great texture from the veggies. The medium was a bit spicy for our tastes, but I finished all of what was on the plate despite smoke almost coming out of my ears-- that is how good it was. The pad Thai was good, a little sweet and not as spicy. It was really good cold right out of the fridge as leftovers the next day. We will definitely be going back in the near future and we hope it stays busy and in Litchfield Park."}
{"text":"Delicious. The Pumpkin Curry is not even fair. Glad I finally went and looking forward to going back! The mango sticky rice. Save room for it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Its right down the road from my house and I just recently discovered it. Great food and good prices make for an excellent dining experience . The Orange Chicken is amazing and the Pad Mee is outstanding!  LOVE the sticky rice desserts!! Best part is that they are not super busy but have a steady flow of customers. That signals to me it's a good place to eat. Its a MUST TRY for West-siders as well as the rest of the valley."}
{"text":"Literally the best green curry in the universe!!! I had my first experience with curry here and since have gone to many other places and none ever measure up! I've had a lot of other dishes too and haven't even disappointed yet!"}
{"text":"Have been here a few times and loved their Thai food. If you know that cuisine well you can order \"off the menu\" and they will accommodate. The owners and chefs are all from Thailand, everything is so authentic and fresh. I live close so we'll be regulars!"}
{"text":"Small portion minimum amounts of chicken. Priced way too high for what is served.  They also charge for rice. However its a small bowl. My family says no go back no return.  If your gonna charge high prices you need to give big portions. They just want you to order more. I wont go back. Pad thai way too saucy and same for spicy noodle."}
{"text":"Woohoooooo!  We have located the holy grail of Thai food in the west valley!  (review is for take-out not dine-in)  Having been to Thai Orchid multiple times and thinking that it just wasn't my most favorite Thai spot, we decided to try something new one night when we felt like getting take-out...Thai style.    This place already has higher ratings than Thai Orchid.  So there you go!    Or course, I ordered Pad Won Sen and my hubby got his favorite, Pad Cee Ew.  Both do not come spicy, but we had ours made with mild spice...not knowing if this was one of those places that is higher or lower than their stated spice scale.  Well...their mild is definitely their medium!  So tread lightly and carefully.  Both dishes were way more flavorful than Thai Orchid for sure.  We were very impressed.    We have now ordered take-out from them 3 times and every time is just as good as the last!  Also?  Their grilled pot-stickers are spot on tasty.  Not a huge fan of their eggrolls or the sauce that comes with them though...I do prefer Thai Orchid's for sure.    If you're in the west valley, definitely order yourself some take-out or try dining in too.  It is well worth it!!"}
{"text":"We love eating here- there isn't a dish we didn't like!  Everything is fresh and made to order!  The servers are always so polite!"}
{"text":"Great food, nice atmosphere, fair prices. Slow service for sure but I'd go back anyway!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times now for lunch and I took dinner to-go a couple of times too. My only complaint abt this place was that there is no one to greet or seat you upon entering. That appears to be fixed. The service was great. Food was delicious. I'm so glad this new place opened. I actually drive past Thai Orchid to come to this place now."}
{"text":"The food is actually pretty good, but they have a couple of opportunities that should definitely be improved on in order to get five stars. Number one is the customer service. I have been here now at least 6 times, both eating in the restaurant and take out. I've had several staff wait on us and all are not very pleasant. They come off as impatient as well as no sense of urgency. Secondly, their prices are a tad higher than most Thai restaurants. I would feel comfortable paying the prices they put on their menu if they had good customer service, however, they do not. So it feels like I'm not getting my moneys worth."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had. Don't hesitate to try! Awesome service whether pick up or dine in."}
{"text":"I ordered the beef salad, pad see ewe and fried rice. It seems to cater more towards the American palate. The food was ok, didn't have the sweet, spicy, sour and umami flavor that Thai dishes should have.  I ask for 5 stars and still had to get the extra spice Tray to make it spicy. I probably would not come back here, it was below average."}
{"text":"My husband & I have eaten here a few times since we moved to Goodyear. I'm obsessed with Thai food, and my husband just likes it. He's not a fan of spicy, so he likes that he can order it to his taste here. Whenever we've been here we've had nothing but great service & the food is always great."}
{"text":"LOVE this place!  I typically get their yellow curry with chicken.  They spice well for me as I like flavor and not heat.  If I tell them I want it medium hot, it's nearly always consistent and just right for me.  My 3 year old also enjoys the yellow curry here.  She has had the kids meal fried rice and also enjoys it.  Their menu is kid friendly with a nice selection for little ones.  I really enjoy this place and eat here regularly - every week or so typically.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This was an unplanned stop along a nationwide road trip - but boy was it memorable! The waitress was so helpful and urged us to try new items, such as the spicy chicken wings. These were absolutely delicious, so crisp and flavorful on the outside with a juicy and tender interior. We both had soups that night, including a tom yum with a coconut base. I would highly recommend this place to anyone! Definitely ask for recommendations from the servers as well!"}
{"text":"Love the food here!  I love the curry and the panang is my favorite. They have a large group table if you have a large group. Also outdoor seating. Great lunch combo plates also!"}
{"text":"Pa-nang curry in either chicken or beef is fantastic! Great service and staff that rocks! Clean inside and out."}
{"text":"It was girls' lunch out day and we went to Royal Jasmine Thai.  There was a nice lunch menu for choices besides the regular menu.  The place is very clean.  We had a coupon for a free appetizer which was brought out prompty.  We also ordered an app of satay chicken.  It was delicious!  Our meals came with a cup of soup, egg roll, fried wonton, rice, and Everything was delicious.  We did question the potatoes in one of the meals that didn't seem to belong.  They don't have a soda fountain, but canned sodas. I am looking forward to a return meal there!!!"}
{"text":"In Ft Walton Beach area, I sampled 24 Thai restaurants  alone. This is one of the best I ever had. I suggest hitting any BBQ platter, tho the duck is bar-none. Last time I went they had a new owner-manager type person (only white lady there), she is horrible and should stay home. Ignore her and enjoy everything else!"}
{"text":"For a Tuesday night, it was a little busier than I'd expect, no problem there.  However, it did seem like the service was stretched a little thin, with a bit of a wait time for ordering and a slight mixup on our rice request.  Apart from that, the food was excellent, really great Thai as far as I was concerned.   We'll definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Surprisingly disappointed! We have been there a few times with little to nothing to write about. This time however the staff was condescending and disrespectful. Definitely not traditional Acting Thai. Specifically Joy who as a younger Thai to speak disrespectfully to her elder is absolutely the antithesis of what Thailand is about."}
{"text":"First class Thai food. We drive 30 minutes to dine there. Excellent service too. Their Pad Thai is delicious and they also make a terrific Ref Curry."}
{"text":"Pretty good. It doesn't compare to my favorite Thai restaurant Thai Rama, but then again nothing does. There aren't many options for Thai food in the west valley so I'm happy to have found this place. So far I've only found two options for Thai out here and this location had much better service. I had the red curry with veggies. It was good but nothing too special. It was missing that extra kick of flavor, but I will definitely give it another shot. Worth checking out if your in the west valley!"}
{"text":"Great authentic Thai. Highly recommend if you're not afraid to eat adventurously. The Tom Yum soup was great."}
{"text":"Craving for Thai? This is the place for home made style dishes. This restaurant is tucked away in an adjacent row of suites serving the body beautiful. Hair salons, nail spas, etc.   The dishes are cooked just right and the taste is where it keeps you coming back for more.   Typical Thai dishes that bring a wonderful taste to your pallet. I recommend the Pad Thai & Duck noodles.   Service is super too."}
{"text":"Awesome food, awesome service, Im not sure about the location, definitely will eat here again"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Royal Jasmine since it opened about five years ago. Back then, I lived fairly close to the restaurant. In fact, I even dined on the patio when this location was a Mediterranean joint. It wasn't very memorable, and that is why we are now talking about Thai food!  You've probably driven right by the building on the northeast corner of Wigwam Boulevard and Indian School and didn't realize what was there. The entrance faces east off the parking behind the building. The dining room is fairly small, but always busy. And these days, it's more common for me to grab some take-out. However, I have eaten in the dining room and know first hand how very friendly the staff is.  Their menu has more than a few Asian beers to complement your meal. You're going to want some Chang or Singha on hand to put out the fire. And when you order a spicy dish, they ask you to tailor your level of spice from 1-5. Four is good enough for me. And I love spicy food. Asking for five may be too much for some people.  My first impression of this restaurant, is still relevant today. No matter what you order, you can taste the freshness of the ingredients! The menu is extensive enough that you can try something different each time, like I do. Even the deserts are original! It's nice to find an Asian restaurant that doesn't rely on the deserts from other cultures. (Hello? Cheesecake!?) Try the Sweet Rice with Thai Custard.  Royal Jasmine is definitely one of the few \"gotta go there\" places in the west valley. And I'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"VERY GOOD PUMPKIN CURRY! Pumpkin was used to thicken the curry and chunks of pumpkin all though it! Even the white meat chicken was moist and good!                                                                                     YUM!  The Pad Gra Pow was delicious but lacked enough basil. It would have been perfect if it had enough basil. I would ask them to add on extra basil if I come back and get it.   We both ordered level 4 out of five for heat and one came out fiery hot and the other was pretty tame but tasty!   The Summer Rolls were very fresh but I'd skip them because I didn't care for the sweet teriyaki like sauce for dipping.  They also offer brown rice and sticky rice here.  Dining room is sort of lavish. It's very decorated with tapestry, drapes, dark carved wood furniture. Almost like someone's Grandmother's house. (If you have a Thai Grandmother)  They had a current grade \"A\" health inspection posted.  Service was quick and efficient.  VERY GOOD!  Worth a try when you're in the area!"}
{"text":"A lot of veg friendly options! The pumpkin curry w tofu and veggies is awesome! The sticky rice and the Panang curry is delicious as well as are their summer rolls w tofu. We have gone here about 4 times and it is always great!"}
{"text":"Great place for lunch, good choices, nice setting,friendly service. Had the Pa nang curry chicken and it was very good, although could have been a bit more spicy. But that is a problem with all (most) US Thai restaurants .Prices are excellent, most dishes on the lunch menu are a mere $7.99 which includes soup, a won ton and spring roll. Just right for a lite lunch. I will be back."}
{"text":"The west valley was really hurting for a joint like this. we've been here a couple of time now, and while the service could have been faster, it was very much worth the wait.   Be sure to try the green curry."}
{"text":"Only one waitress. Took fifteen minutes to get my order. I ordered the pad Thai chicken, they didn't have the thai Beef Ma Sa Man Curry i love so much... The pad Thai is decent the last time I was here. I'm actually a fan now. Order it spicy! I had to add extra spice. give this place a try"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch to go.  The Thai tea is amazing!  I had the yellow curry and it too was good but never have seen such huge potatoes in curry.  My wife had the sweet and sour chicken and the sauce was put on before i brought it home so it was a little soggy."}
{"text":"They have great fresh Thai cuisines. There prices are reasonable as well. If you like Thai curry - all colors this is the place."}
{"text":"Excellent all around.  Service, cleanliness, and food.  I've been there a handful of times and always great.  So happy we have them on this side of town!"}
{"text":"It pains me to have to re-do my review and only give 3 stars.  Let me first say, the devalued rating has nothing to do with the quality of the food.  The food here is simply marvelous!  My problem is with the amount of rice served and if you ask for more, you're charged an extra $2.50.  The amount of rice that comes with the curry is highly inadequate for the portion of curry.  Charging for extra rice at an Asian establishment is akin to charging for more bread or dinner rolls at an American restaurant or chips at a Mexican place.  I could even let this extra charge slide if the original amount of rice was proportionate to the amount of curry but it is not even close.  I will continue to eat here because the food is exceptional, however, the extra charge will continue to be docked from the waitstaff's tip.  I know that's not fair to your waitstaff and perhaps they need to voice to ownership how ridiculous charging extra for rice is when the original amount given 1/2 cup if you're lucky!  GET WITH THE PROGRAM GUYS!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food in the West Valley. We enjoyed the service and food. We will be back. Great prices too."}
{"text":"My wife, our friends and I experienced Royal Jasmine for the first time.  It will be the first of many visits.  Our waitperson, May, was excellent and personable.  She knew the substantial menu extremely well.  We told her it was our first visit and she became a helpful guide including the seasonings.  We enjoyed our appetizers and entrees - each of us had something different.  We loved the food and we ate it it all!  The only concern was the very limited wine list, but all things considered, that was a minor issue.  Even in July, make a reservation. It was a busy place."}
{"text":"This restaurant may have decent food but the customer service is horrible.  The issue at hand is online ordering via EAT24.  They do not actively check for online orders at this restaurant.  The first time, we arrived to discover that our order had not been started.  They started at the time we arrived and indicated that we should call after placing an online order.  Today, I placed an online order and attempted to call them SIX TIMES prior to arriving at the restaurant.  Each time, no answer.  When I arrived, they were in a frenzy with no assigned person at the register.  After waiting, I asked about my order and they indicated that they didn't have an order for me.  I explained the first person that the order was most likely waiting on the laptop next to the register that was covered with papers and money.  I told her that this was not the first time and if the order hadn't been started, please refund my money.  She went to the kitchen to get another person (a supervisor I assume).  I re-explained the situation and without any show of remorse, she indicated that they were busy and no one was checking for online orders.  She made no attempt to check the order on the laptop and told me to contact whomever I placed the order with.  Completely nonchalant and dismissive.  I will never patronize this restaurant in the future.  While I can excuse a mistake, this establishment seems to not care to take the extra effort to check for online orders or even answer the phone."}
{"text":"Great quaint Thai restaurant with as authentic as you can get in Phoenix! Excellent service with Thai humbleness.  The decor is classy and not over the top.  Get the chicken, basil veggie dish!  I enjoyed the Tom Yum with shrimp. The shrimp was huge and succulent with mushrooms. The broth was very flavorful with ginger, lemon grass and lime leaves with tomato. But it didn't have any other substance to it. No other vegetables. So although I liked it I would probably opt for the other Tom Yum's that have much more in it.  I hear the lunch specials is wonderful.  I will definitely return when in the area. :)"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite restaurants in the west Valley. They have a variety of different appetizers and entrees at affordable prices. This place is worth the drive, can get very busy around dinner time. If you can, plan ahead to arrive before the dinner rush. With that being said the food is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Never really dined in. I attempted once on a Sunday evening the place was full we got our seat but 10-15 mins goes by and we haven't even been serve any water or even asked anything.   Seems like they were under staffed,regardless of how busy they were 10-15min is unacceptable to be serve-less.   We left! We just figured if it's going to take that long for us to even get drinks imagine how long it'll take to get our dinner. We were hungry and figured it'll be faster if we cooked at home instead.  So the reason why I gave this place a 3 star even after the poor service.  I came back a week later and ordered to-go. I had the shrimp pad-thai. It's probably one of the best pad Thai I've ever tried. What makes it so special is the balanced between the sauce and noodles it was perfect. Not too sweet or drenched in sweet fish sauce like other places. This was surprisingly done right!  Food I give them a 4 of 5 given my limited experience  Service was a 2 of 5"}
{"text":"Great Thai Food and Service. I came here once a few months ago and been back several times since. If I'm in the mood for Thai I'm coming here for sure."}
{"text":"I came with my girlfriend at 2:30 on a Sunday. The restaurant was very clean, quite, and only about 1/4 full. We were immediately seated, given menus, and asked for drinks. After a few minutes we placed an order for the shrimp spring rolls. These were just okay, I'd give them 5/10 overall. We placed our order a little later and got shrimp Pad Thai (spice level 4) and Pad Prick Khing seafood combination (spice level 3). We also got 2 side orders of sticky rice.  The food did take a little while, but there was a table of 10+ that did order before us so they got their food first. I recommend getting an appetizer in case the service is busy.   The food itself was awesome! I'd give the Pad Thai a 7.5/10 and the Pad Prick Khing an 8/10. The sticky rice was only okay, maybe a 4.5/10. We did notice an error on our bill where they charged is $3 for sweet sticky rice when we ordered $2 plain sticky rice, but not a big deal.   Overall, it was a nice meal and we will be coming back. I recommend getting an appetizer if they're busy and double checking your bill."}
{"text":"Tom Kha, curry, noodles, we have enjoyed everything we've tried here. This is a place the entire family enjoys!"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch specials, $6.95 can't be beat for meal, soup, spring roll and pot sticker. I always try the red curry when I go to a new Thai restaurant. I ordered the medium hot version. Overall it was delicious, didn't over crowd my plate with food, just enough for lunch. Service was excellent, ordered food in a few minutes, soup arrived two minutes later and main meal arrived a few minutes after finishing the soup. The restaurant has a nice tranquil setting also."}
{"text":"Decided to give this place another try and like always friendly service   Honestly probably the best Thai food in this area though, everyone should try it for themselves :)"}
{"text":"We had pot stickers (very good) and yellow curry with chicken (good). The meal was very good but we have had a little better curry chicken here in the past. The curry seemed to be a little short on the coconut milk. They offered to make it again but it was still really good so we told them that would not be necessary. We will be coming back again I am sure."}
{"text":"Grateful for a Thai option in Goodyear! The lunch special is about $9 and includes a cup of soup, potsticker, and spring roll. The food is good but the service can be a little slow sometimes. Not a great place for a rushed lunch... depending on the day.   I would definitely recommend the yellow curry chicken!"}
{"text":"Only fair. Pad Thai chicken and shrimp, chicken was very dry as tho it had been reheated several times."}
{"text":"Overall good food.  My girl is a Thai food snob and has been asking me to try this place.  I had the Sweet and Sour chicken.  Good flavor but wish there was more chicken and less veggies on the plate.  She had the Pad Thai and thought it was ok.   She thought it lacked a little flavor and nearly no chicken.  She does want to try the curry next time.    Overall the prices are fair and the food is pretty good.  We would likely return due to how close we live."}
{"text":"The food here is great and honestly if I were rating on the taste alone it would be a 4.5. Although, with a limited wait staff to tend many hungry customers the entire dining experience was disappointing. By the time my food reached the table it was cold. To add to my frustration, the customer service was poor. I couldn't even get her attention for a box, so I got it myself. My advice is go during the off hours, maybe you'll get a hot meal with an attentive server."}
{"text":"OMG, the ambiance is cozy and authentic. Best of all is the delicious food; I am in love with the Tom Yum soup, the fried rice...everything indeed. The staff are always pleasant & attentive and the cook there really knows what she is doing as it shows in the food. I respect that I can taste fresh veggies (which they are generous with). They also take time to work on food plate presentation. Very satisfied and happy they are in the west part of Goodyear."}
{"text":"Very good, gotten takeout here 7 or 8 Times and its always been really good. Service was quick and food was always fresh. Pad Thai and Panang Curry are delicious."}
{"text":"Food is great, however, both times I have been here their billing system wasn't working so they made me wait over 30 minutes to pay....I am writing this as I am still waiting for my bill.....so finally I got the bill. They gave me 10% off for waiting."}
{"text":"Visited this restaurant for the first time today for lunch and was pleasantly surprised.  We ordered the Pad Phrik Khing (spicy level 4) and Chicken Pad Thai (mild) off the lunch menu.  Our meals came with a bowl of Soup, Egg roll, and Pot Sticker.  The food was very good and mine was more than spicy enough (level 5 or \"Thai hot\" probably would have hurt me).  Service was a little slow, but the food presentation and taste more than made up for it.  There is a small bar in front and the restaurant is decently decorated in Thai decor.  We will definitely return and try some dinner entree's next time."}
{"text":"My dining partner and I went to Royal Jasmine Thai for  lunch yesterday. I'd read the reviews and thought this  place sounded very promising. The decor is beautiful and clean and it wasn't busy at all, so we were seated immediately.   We each ordered the Pad Thai. It comes with soup or salad and when when we asked what kind of soup it came with, we were told that they don't serve soup with this meal. Okay---we ordered the salad.   The salad arrived with ranch dressing on it. I know that's not a big deal--but come on---this is a Thai food place that had good reviews. I was very disappointed, but hungry enough that I ate it.   The main dish arrived and it was okay, not outstanding, not even great, just okay.  I've never written a review before, but had to after having the ranch salad dressing.   Thai Orchid Garden at 127th Ave and Indian School is better, in my opinion."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant. Atmosphere is great and the restrooms are clean. I had the Pad-See-We with beef, mild. He had the Yellow Curry, very spicy. It was delicious! We would've like a bit larger portion of rice with the curry and they could use some extra hands to help with the amount of customers during their busy hours. But, all in all, we'll be back."}
{"text":"A very good Thai restaurant.  I enjoy a good curry and the red and green curry are fabulous.  The staff is terrific and I will be going back again really soon!"}
{"text":"Ate here for dinner tonight and everything was delicious! We had egg rolls, fried dumplings, yellow chicken curry, chicken pad Thai, beef noodle soup, and pineapple fried rice. The only disappointment was that we were too full for coconut ice cream! Next time!"}
{"text":"I was a bit skeptical at first, then I walked inside and was immediately impressed with the decor and ambiance. Then I had my first bite of Tom yum soup and ginger shrimp with chicken! The favors exploded in my mouth and it was simply sublime.  We deserving the 5 stars, as the service was just as delightful! I recommend wholeheartedly and will be back to make many more memories with family and friends!"}
{"text":"Great food.. And very friendly staff.  We had the seafood Tom yum soup, which is very good, and the roasted duck was also great.  Pad Thai was OK, but more ordinary.  Hidden gem, as its not easy to spot this place or know about it."}
{"text":"Woah...I had no idea this restaurant was even in existence until a few days ago. I am a big fan of Thai food and I have to say this place is amazing. I have high standards for Thai food, so for me to give this place 5 stars says something. My boyfriend and I ordered the veggie fried eggrolls, the vegetarian pad thai, and the vegetarian red curry. All dishes were excellent. In fact, I had wished we had ordered even more food because it was all so good and we quickly ate up every last morsel of it. No leftovers is a good sign of a great restaurant! I will definitely be going back to this place and am so excited to find it close to my home in Verrado. We got take-away so I cannot review the service, although the cashier who took care of us was very friendly and nice. Highly recommend this place. Making my mouth water just writing this review. :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I am extremely particular about my Thai Food and this place is perfect.The Panang has amazing flavor! I love spicy food and usually get a 3/4. The crab Rangoon a and egg rolls are wonderful. I recommend going during the lunch hour in order to get their lunch special soup eggroll and entrée for less than the cost of most dinner entrées about $9.25. I love this place but service can be slow but I still give it a five out of five"}
{"text":"The service was fast and the staff was very friendly. The dinning room is clean and there is a family atmosphere. The prices are average. I would be coming back for more . Chicken friend rice was awesome. It's hard to find a good restaurant I had to drive 20 miles to get here.."}
{"text":"Came here with my nieces after a spa day at The Wigwam and the food was delicious. The service was awesome. But waiting for food, it was a little bit slow. Would definitely go again maybe they're just super busy that day."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Ok so since my last review which was the first time we ate here...we have made this place one of our go-to regular stops. We always order the same things. Pineapple rice, shrimp pad thai, fresh shrimp rolls and two mango sweet rice. We also added thai tea a few times. THAT stuff is DELIGHTFUL!  So we still love it but every time we order it seems to have less and less flavor. So i am lowering their stars. We ordered again last night and it was ok. Better than before so maybe its just not consistent and weekends are better.  we are planning on trying the curry dishes next time."}
{"text":"First time here I have to say that I was impressed. I I'm a huge fan of Thai food and this is the best that I've had in a long time. The chicken Pad Thai was perfect and the chicken panang was the best iPad in the West Valley. I will definitely be coming back. I highly recommend you giving this place a try.."}
{"text":"This lovely restaurant smelled wonderful the minute we walked in! I love Thai food and was excited to try their soup. I ordered the Coconut seafood soup. I can't remember what she called it. It was amazing! It came out hot and delicious with various types of yummy seafood pieces in every bite. My husband ordered the pad kathiam prik thai with pork. He said it was very good a well. The atmosphere and service were great and we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I ordered take out and was blown away with the care they took in prepping the food for my drive home.  It was obvious that food quality was important to them. I ordered a spicy dish and was definitely impressed.  It had a very even heat and tons of flavor. I'd definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Our favorite Thai restaurant!  It can't get much better!  Pumpkin Thai Curry, Pad Thai Chicken & Shrimp, Pork Fried Rice, Mixed Vegetables with Tofu, and the Shrimp Spring Rolls sub Plum Sauce and ask for the Thai Sweet & Sour all of these made our meal perfectly delicious!  The service is wonderful!  May is friendly, attentive, quick, professional and sweet.  She's a 30% tip type of waitress.  I can't visit Phoenix area without getting my Royal Thai Jasmine fix."}
{"text":"Love this place!  My husband is from China and very critical of Asian restaurant food.  Everything we have tried on the menu is delicious!  Prices are reasonable and services is excellent.  Favorite Asian place!  Thank goodness they are on the west-side of town!"}
{"text":"Great food and specials! It was a great stop with the family and our one year old!  The service was and when I asked for spicy, \"Thai Hot,\" they actually brought it to me!  Definitly a place to go back to."}
{"text":"Just got into PHX and drove to our hotel, Wigwam and needed comfort food. Love the shrimp rolls, nam sod and shrimp pineapple curry. All very very good."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Just moved from Scottsdale and I travel to LA weekly. This has to be the best Thai food hands down! Seafood combination Tom Yum / Shrimp spring rolls / Chicken Satay / Chicken Mee Grob. First time and I will be back weekly. The BEST"}
{"text":"We ate on a weeknight adn place was slow. we were greeted and seated promtly and the food was excellent! I had the green curry Beef ($11.25) and it was delicious (Best I have had) and had lots of meat. we also had thai tea, Pad Thai chicken (Awesome) ($9.25), crab rangoon ($4.25) and satay beef appetizer ($6.25)  all VERY VERY good. Place was clean and quiet and we will definately be back!"}
{"text":"My son and I tried the RJ and he is a huge Thai food fan.  He LOVED it and ranked it right up with some of the best he has had.  I am new to it and it was good, and not as hot as I had heard it could be.  So it is good for newbies and folks who are Thai Food lovers!"}
{"text":"So last few times I visit for lunch I have notice the price increase is crazy. My partner and I use to come here for lunch. Are bill would come out to around 15 bucks or less before tip. Recently it's around 26 bucks before tip. There excuse is min wage increase. Over all service is not what it use to be. Food is still fantastic but for portion  you get I rather just wait for dinner. Not really a lunch special anymore."}
{"text":"This used to be our favorite local restaurant, but due to the last three times we've eaten here, going forward we will only order take out from here and enjoy our extremely long wait time from the comfort of our home. The service here used to be exceptional and we don't really know what's changed. Is it the kitchen staff? The wait staff? Management? All three? We are sitting here waiting for our food and apparently the group at the table behind us has been waiting for their entrees for an hour and a half.  Our waitress even informed us that we would have to wait 20 minutes for our meal. Sigh. Does that really mean 20 minutes? The food is great, so we won't stop ordering from here, but we will stop coming here."}
{"text":"Really good, really authentic Thai. I spend a few weeks a year in various parts of thailand, and this is really pretty good. it is in a strip mall (what is with the valley with strip malls) though they have all of the flavors. The vegetables aren't 100% thai per se, they use a lot of local things, but their sauces, and gravies are great. They do have some american-ized menu items, but I found their Phad Nam Prik Phao was about as good as I would have anywhere on the Chao Phraya. Their green curry had the awesome sour limes, which I really enjoy when I'm in thailand. I wasn't expecting this from here. We'll easily be back and I will ensure that I let people know about it, as it is kind of hidden between Indian School and Wigwam roads in Goodyear."}
{"text":"The restaurant was very nice, the staff was very personable (with the exception of the one person who was running the food that wasn't very friendly), the food was very good, and although they were closing they didn't rush us out of the restaurant.   If my order hadn't been incorrect I would give them 5 stars."}
{"text":"Cheap and great!  Excellent service. Delicious food. I had never seen many salad choices at a Thai restaurant ! My wife ordered one of the pork salads with ginger. It was great.  Beer and wine only with singha bottles. One of my favorites.    Yelp gives a free app if you check in ahead of your visit. Free spring rolls for us.   Nice place in litchfield park area!"}
{"text":"I'm not from the area and each time I come to the Phoenix area I try a new Thai restaurant because there are no Thai restraints near where I live. This place is so good I came back a second time! The Pineapple Fried Rice, Yellow Curry and Pad Thai are really good. So are the pot Potstickers and fried Fried Wontons!!"}
{"text":"Great tasting Thai food! The coconut curry, the pad Thai noodles, and the roasted duck are definitely recommended!"}
{"text":"We just  ordered from them this evening. The lady we made our order with said they didn't  deliver today because  they did not have a driver. It was a bit of a challenge  to make our order over the phone because the nice lady couldn't  hear us well or perhaps,  understand us.   Once we got through this huddle,  we ordered  and picked up within 20 minutes. It was ready on time. The food was pretty  good. We didn't know what to expect  but we were pleasantly surprised!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmm I love the yellow Curry.  The food is fresh and the price is average!  The restaurant is very clean and it has an enjoyable atmosphere."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good but the servings of there protein are lacking. I order pad Thai and only got a few pieces of chicken. Other than that the flavor was good and the service was also."}
{"text":"Just wasn't impressed.  Pad Thai was really gummy.  The Panang chicken curry wasn't that good.  Eggrolls, were just eh.  The papaya salad was delicious though.  The server was very nice.    Maybe I was there on an off day?"}
{"text":"Overall good food. Service could be better, but they were busy. My pad woon sen was a bit salty and the dishes I think were mixed up as far as the spice levels were supposed to be. We will be back to try other things. Panang curry was delicious, but could use more veggies."}
{"text":"I tried this place three different times, and the food does not disappoint! However if you plan on eating its better not to be in a hurry. The service is slow, but that could be cultural, I am not sure. The wait was worth it though. I tried the coconut curry soup, Larp chicken salad, and home made coconut ice cream ! Yummy! I love this place, I just can't go if I am in a hurry. Updated"}
{"text":"Good, kind of expensive but good.  Chicken pad Thai and Pad See Ew and egg rolls were all tasty."}
{"text":"This place has a wonderful atmosphere,  great staff, and good food. Their service is great; however, I have had to wait too long for a drink refill too many times. I like most of their food; however, their curry is more than disappointing. Personally, I love spicy food. One of my favorite types of food are spicier Thai dishes; however, I was seriously disappointed when I ordered their most spicy item. The flavor was off just a bit and it was no where near spicy. Deciding to give it another go, I ordered the same item on a different trip, this time asking them to make it as spicy as they can. That time, it was better; but, still missing something and it did not have the heat I am accustomed to. Bottom line, everything on their menu is great, other than their curry dishes. I highly recommend their Thai tea, Thai coffee, appetizers,  and desserts."}
{"text":"Came here before lunch rush and sat in the entryway for roughly 30 minutes without being acknowledged so we went elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love Thai food! I prefer the red curry! I recently went here with a very large group of people and they accommodated us very well. The service was great and the food was delicious! I plan on coming here frequently! Kid friendly atmosphere!"}
{"text":"I'm sitting here with my mouth burning at a level 2 spicy red curry.  It hurts soooooo good!  We have only ever ordered take out and it's delicious every time.  I've tried several of the curries, my husband is partial to the drunken noodles.  I have yet to dine in...but every time we pick up our order we're reminded how lovely it is inside.  Hoping to make it in sometime soon.   Flavors are great.  And like I said...nice and spicy :) enjoy!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the valley. I have been coming here for 3 years and have never been disappointed. The ambience is nice and the service is good. The Thai iced tea is delicious along with the yellow curry and spicy noodles. A must try place if you like Thai food."}
{"text":"Quick and simple... we love this place. Great food, good portions, and a fair price. If you haven't tried it and you enjoy Thai food make a stop for some good food."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Friendly service and not expensive. The pineapple and pumpkin curry are just a few favorites !"}
{"text":"I love eating at this Thai Restaurant over Panda Express. I've always ordered their Orange Chicken and what makes this dish unique is the delicious along with cashew mixed in with the chicken. I'm a huge fan of Orange Chicken, and i've never come across this type of mixture. Cashews are also my favorite type of peanut as well :) So in conclusion, anyone into oriental food must give this place a taste if your in the Goodyear area because you will not regret it! 5 stars most definitely xoxo"}
{"text":"3 stars is overall. Pricey for lunch. Food was ok. I had pad Thai chicken which was ok. Noodles could have been a little but thicker. Wasn't cool with the sprouts cooked with it but that's ok. Lunch special gives you your choice of entree  small egg roll wonton which was cold.. and a cup of ginger chicken soup. Now that was good. You do get a good portion when ordering pad Thai. Husband had teriyaki chicken it was ok.  So will I come back? No. There was nothing here that said bring your friends and family.  Oh and it's a negatory on fish cakes. Rubbery tasteless. Had to drench in chili paste."}
{"text":"The food was fresh and delicious. The service was great & extremely curtious. We just happened to be on the West side and found this place. We all loved it! From the decorating to the dessert. This was a really nice way to end our day before we had to drive all the way back to the South East side of the Valley."}
{"text":"This place is great. Its off the beaten path a bit but well worth finding it. The service is very friendly and has the restraunt has a good atmosphere. The food is the real highlight, fresh, cooked well and delicious! I ordered a seafood type soup. I dont remember the name of the dish but it comes with 5 or 6 different seafood items in a mildly spicy coconut milk broth, so good. The papaya salad was great as well."}
{"text":"My friend and I had a really enjoyable and delicious lunch here.  We got there a little before lunch time, so it wasn't crowded at all.  But, by the time we left, after slowly eating our meals and gabbing, there was a nice lunch crowd.  We started with the fried potstickers (which were tasty) and the vegetable tempura (which I really loved!).  My friend got the shrimp pad thai.  She loved it, but found it a little annoying to have to pull the tails off the shrimp.  We get that it looks nice, but when you're trying to eat a hot meal with a fork, please take the tails off the shrimp.  I got the pork pad thai.  It was delicious, but the pork was a little dry.  The service was very friendly, and our glasses were always full.  The restaurant feels quite comfortable and spacious.  We both enjoyed it a lot, and will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"The food is great. Love the Phad See Ewe the Panang Chicken, Green Curry and juicy chicken satay! Fast service but Super unfriendly and feeling like we are bothering one woman at her job. Quan (Kwan? Not sure of spelling) was a pure delight. She's happy, friendly and warm...other servers should follow her example and be kind and happy.  Try if you love Thai!! 4stars for food, not service."}
{"text":"This was our first visit. We had duck curry, Pad Thai and spicy friend rice. Everything was hot and fresh. We'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This place is delicious.  My boyfriend can't get enough of thai hot and he said it was spicy when nothing else ever is. I've had both the curry and pad thai and both have been wonderful."}
{"text":"Good place.   Had the lunch special there. The waitress was kind and quick.  The lunch was cute :3.   Had an entree with a one potsticker, small eggroll, and a small soup.  Overall is was satisfactory.  Ive had better but the service was speedy Good place for a quick bite."}
{"text":"This place was a surprise for myself and my husband, we were driving from California to Texas back to California for a wedding over a weekend, first of all not a good idea, secondly on the way back we are both hungry since we are trying to bust a mission here and haven't really bothered to stop and eat, mostly just drive, drink, pee. We got into AZ and couldn't wait any more, we were going to stop at the first place we saw we could sit down at and relax for about 45 minutes. Well the first like 5 places were packed so we Yelped this place and thought why not. The staff was really friendly and the food was surprisingly good. I'm not a huge food snob but growing up in the area of So.Cal I have, you eat a lot of food from a ton of different places and thai has been a staple in my family. The curry was awesome with a great blend of spices! The sticky rice was good too! Definitely a great place to eat and sit back for awhile. If I'm ever in the area I think I would stop again"}
{"text":"I used the Eat24 link to place a pickup order.  Too easy.  The food?  Outstanding!  The Royal Jasmine just became my go-to for Thai.  My next visit will be for dine in.  It really was delicious!  Pad Thai with chicken and Pad Kathiam Phrik Thai with chicken were the choices.  Stop reading and go there for yourself or order with Eat24.  Either way, you'll put one in the win column."}
{"text":"Noisy patrons led to many \"carry out\" dinners this night.  I love the food here and have frequented this restaurant often. However, on Saturday night, May 26, 2018 one table with many young family members was so loud (screaming and crying for our entire stay) that I watched at least 8 other diners walk out of the restaurant.  We asked for the manager and were told no one was present. We asked for the owner's names and we were told they didn't know. We suggested that they politely request that the family take the noise outside or carry-out. Nothing was done at all.  This was an extremely disappointing evening."}
{"text":"My husband and I spent $40.xx for the Appetizer Platter, Panang Beef and Chicken Pad Thai carry out dinner. Ten minutes to pick up the order. IT WENT INTO THE GARBAGE!   The appetizers were greasy and dry...disgusting. The two meals were certainly not what we ordered. They had no taste, the noodles in the Pad Thai were not rice noodles and the whole mess was cold. I would wager that \"food\" was not even cooked that day.  When I called to complain, I spoke to an older woman named Lucy. I was told that they would return our money and replace the meal for free. I told her that my husband would be in the next day.   The very next day, I called to tell her that my husband was coming in to get his refund (we didn't even want their \"free meal on the house\") but Lucy insisted that she paid my husband yesterday.   NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I really like this place. The food is delicious. I went here a few times already. My husband really like the curry. The sweet rice with mango is delicious. I really like eating the BBQ duck dish. The flavor is really good, but the only downside is the bones in the BBQ duck. I'd probably get it again anyway!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. We had the Orange Chicken, Crab Rangoons, Shrimp Wonton, and Chicken Satay. All of it was wonderful. More so the Orange Chicken and the Chicken Satay than the other things. But overall you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Maybe it was an off night but this is the worst Thai restaurant I've ever been too. I don't know how you screw up Pad Thai, but this place did. No flavor. Just a mound of yellow noodles. Also, it took over 45 mins for our order to arrive when the restaurant was half empty. Extremely disappointed."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent! Very fresh and flavorful. Reasonably priced. The chicken  kaprow and chicken pa nang is our absolute favorite. When they ask you how spicy you want it - be aware that 'Thai spicy' is mouth burning spicy (but we still ate it all)! Highly recommended. Staff is very nice."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service.  Stood at front waiting for service over 10 minutes.  Waitresses walked by said nothing."}
{"text":"Love it...spicy and flavorful!  Great prices!  Service is a little slow but it's worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Ok tasting.  I ordered my usual Pad Thai and it was so sweet and sour I almost choked on it, and had too much MSG or something in it that irritated my system.  my stomach didn't feel right for a day afterwards as I eat very clean, simple meals normally."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time yesterday. Got there at 2:45 for an early dinner, but the lunch menu was still available so we tried it. Amazing! A really nice cup of soup, a potsticker, and a vegetarian spring roll. All delish, and only $9!  Hubby had the veggie Penang curry and I had the red curry with Tofu. Both were really good. We'll be going back again, soon!  The server was friendly, as was the lady inside, maybe the owner. Service was a little slow and we had to go inside to pay, but we're retired so we have the time to wait. Sat outside on the patio which was nice, apart from the high schoolers walking by, yelling and swearing. Not the restaurant's fault, obviously, but must drive the shop keepers nuts.   I would definitely recommend this place. Best Thai we have found since moving to the area."}
{"text":"It was average, food took very long to arrive. They were not busy at all when we went and it took us forever to have our order taken. It is the only Thai place that will actually make your food spicy if you ask for it to be, so that was very nice."}
{"text":"Good food, quick service....I've eaten her several times and the coconut curry chicken is my favorite!"}
{"text":"I'm going to start by saying that their food is very good. But their service is absolutely TERRIBLE. We were at the restaurant for TWO HOURS total. We waited one hour to get our food. And when Wanna (the waitress) took our order she was completely rushing us and didn't even ask us what we want to drink. Come time to pay the bill was $6 over so we told her to fix it. And she seemed very annoyed about doing so. Anyway, it took us another 20 minutes to pay and the line was out the door. Idk how this place is still in business honestly. They are so rude and unwelcoming. BE PREPARED TO BE THERE FOR 2+ HOURS. EXPENSIVE FOR NOTHING."}
{"text":"Disappointed after reading high  reviews, expectations were high. American Thai Food. Spicy fried rice was soggy w no flavor .Pad ka prow was ordered Thai spicy & had little spice or flavor. Place is clean & decor is attractive , server tried her best to suggest ways to make food more flavorful. Great Thai food is already cooked w seasonings & flavor w no need to add chilis/spices afterwards especially when ordered Thai spicy. Stay away if you desire Authentic Thai."}
{"text":"Three of us ate here for the first time and we all raved about the food. It was excellent and the service was extremely pleasant!  We will be back again and again."}
{"text":"They DO NOT DELIVERY direct.  It is through a third party company.  They claim they deliver on here and on their website, which is very misleading.  It's unfortunate because I would have liked to have tried the food being that I'm from out of state and here on business."}
{"text":"Update: this used to be my favorite place ever to eat but not anymore. Don't get me wrong the food is fantastic. But I went in today and sat for 20 mins after the server seated us with no service after. I understand if they were super busy and apologized, however they were/did not. And then after they took our order 60 mins in (we set a timer)  my husband got up to ask, kindly I may add how much longer it would take. The server got defensive with him. I myself have been a server for over 5 years and this is so unacceptable. No apology, she argued us when we were just asking if she could check how many tickets were still ahead of us. Then proceeded to tell us we can cancel our order. Jesus woman, no one even yelled at you. So we just left. I'm so upset about this server, but I don't even want to come back to see her face. So 1 star because server was worst I've experienced but food is good."}
{"text":"The most AMAZING Thai food EVER! I got once a week!!! I just smile at my husband when he asks me what I want and he knows where to take me!!! Hahaha"}
{"text":"My new spot!! Fresh and delicious. The yellow curry was on point! The gyozas are fresh and hot. Thai tea is perfecto!! Love it."}
{"text":"Nom Nom Nom... Yummy Thai  Yellow Curry and Duck Soup were both excellent.  Serving portions were generous.  And the kids meal fried rice was okay.  Service staff was super nice and the restaurant is well appointed.  On the other side, there was food on the floor and chair, along with a used napkin on the table leg where they sat us.  Probably just a rare miss.  We'll definitely visit again because the food was so tasty.  Their curry was perfect on a chilly night."}
{"text":"We really enjoy the food here. Comes out piping hot, so be careful with those tastebuds! Quality ingredients and the pad Thai was delicious as well as the appetizers of shrimp rolls and crab rangoons. Topped it off with sweet rice with coconut ice cream. We'll be back again."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place in the West Valley ! Everything is Great-Very Authentic atmosphere & very friendly people ... just great experience !"}
{"text":"This is our go to for my thai food cravings! Food is amazing and they serve very large portions! It was my little brothers first time having thai food and he loves there pad see You!"}
{"text":"This place is okay. Their Pad Thai taste more like sweet n sour noodles. Their noodles taste SUPER sweet. I can hardly taste the tamarind or soy sauce on it. I mean, isn't that what AUTHENTIC (Not AMERICAN) Pad Thai is composed of?? They only give like 3 pieces of shrimp. Where I'm from (Hawaii) they give 6 pieces of shrimp (for the same price). Also, their curries are sweeter than most Thai restaurants. Service is okay. One of the older Thai ladies was rude. She had an attitude problem and slammed the dish on the table. The first time I came here, they sat us all the way in the back. Then took forever to take our order. Their food is tasty but this place is not my first choice when I'm craving Pad Thai. I'm military so this place is convenient since it's somewhat close to Luke AFB."}
{"text":"Came out to Arizona to visit my aunt and decided to yelp nearby restaurants. After reading the reviews I came out to try it out. I ordered the fresh vegetable roll to start which was crisp and refreshing I also checked in on yelp and presented it to my waitress and with no problem received the free appetizer which was a choice from fried egg roll or wonton, I went with the wonton which was stuffed with cream cheese i think. It was creamy and nice. For my entree I chose the Pad Mee and asked to add mushrooms, also ordered pork fried rice. The dishes came out family style (I was not aware but it's all good ) I had sooo much food haha. To drink I had a Thai iced tea, I had never had one before so I asked the waitress about it, she said it was popular,  that a lot of people liked it so I ordered it and was not disappointed.  It was really good. Tea with cream? Not sure but it was good. My pad mee was to die for. If you're in the mood for thai, give this place a try.  Don't forget (if you like spice) to ask for chili sauce. They bring out a chili paste, a green and a red pickled vinegar, and a dry chile.  It was perfect."}
{"text":"This restaurant was great. Reasonable prices excellent service. I'm a vegetarian and asked about Oyster sauce coming with my dish and the waitress said she made sure the chef knew to alter the dish to make it vegetarian saying \"we could make it work.\" the food came out hot and we'll done and the ambiance was great too."}
{"text":"I enjoy trying restaurants  that are not available  in my home state. My daughter  selected Royal Jasmine and that was one of the best decisions  she's  made. The service  was excellent  and the food was awesome . The waitress  was very helpful . She answered  every question  we had about Thai food and offered  suggestions  for ordering .  I will definitely  return  to  Royal  Jasmine  on my next visit  to  Arizona ."}
{"text":"This place has great Thai food. Always consistent. Always pleasant service. Always hot inside is the only draw back!!"}
{"text":"We have now been here twice.  Once for take out and once for dine in.  Both time the food has been absolutely spot on and service is great.  Like most places, you can specify the spice level which is awesome but even at the spiciest, the food still had great flavor and doesn't get lost in the heat.  I highly recommend and I know we will be going back."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Thai food and am constantly on the lookout for new places. We found Royal Jasmine on Yelp (of course) and decided to give it a shot.    The restaurant itself is located in a corner of a quiet strip mall, and looked nice enough from the outside.  Every table was filled and there was a 15-20 minute wait for us to be seated.  There were comfortable chairs to sit in and wait.  There is a bar, but it doesn't look like it's used as such.  It would have been nice to be able to sit there and get a drink while we waited, so maybe they can work on that.    The servers were all very pleasant and the menu is extensive.  I had the pad prik king and my wife had the panang.  Some of the Yelp reviewers had noted that the food was slightly under-spiced (they use 1-5, with 5 being Thai hot), so we ordered both dishes at a 4.  They definitely earned their star ratings this time.  Luckily, we like hot food.  The food itself was delicious, and I would definitely recommend Royal Jasmine.  The prices were on the low side as well, and I'm not complaining about that.  Give this place a try.   4.5 stars, but only until they fix the bar area."}
{"text":"We've found the where the local Thai chefs are now cooking. The food here is very good, service was good, too. The staff is eager to adjust the level of heat to each individual's taste, and did that very well with our group. The Pad Thai was flavorful and traditional. We also had great shrimp and vegetable spring rolls. You have no problem finding vegan/vegetarian options here, if you follow that culinary approach. I had a meat combination in my \"spicy\" pumpkin curry and was impressed by the execution and tenderness of the meat."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! A group of 4 adults and a child, we were looking for something easy to get to while staying at the Wigwam Resort. We shared the Vegetable Rolls, Vegetable Eggrolls, Fried Tofu and Potstickers to start. The tofu was very crispy on the outside but soft and fluffy in the middle. Each was delicious and perfectly cooked. We also shared the Papaya Salad and Tom Kha soup, both of which had perfect spice and incredible flavor. Then the husbands had the Basil Eggplant and Salmon Curry. Incredible! My daughter had vegetable fried rice and it was so tasty - not like your typical fried rice that is oily. Every single dish was perfectly cooked and everything tasted very fresh. Service was prompt and the staff was very nice and accommodating. Highly recommend this lovely place!"}
{"text":"Being here the 3rd time in less than 30 days, I'd like to say I've tried a different dish every time. But that's a lie. I've always grabbed fried fish balls for appetizer. And have tried Chicken Tom Yum, chicken Pa-nang curry, and my fave is the Thai pumpkin curry. I've been trying to fight the crave for that pumkin curry!! I ask for level 3 spice, but it's a good hint of spice.  The prices are reasonable and the ambience is laid back and quiet.  The servers are professional and do a great job getting back to you. I've never been here at peak meal hours, so I don't know if that would change on that. I highly recommend this place as its so far my fave in the southwest valley of PHX. Military discount available :)"}
{"text":"My husband and I ordered take out and the food was mediocre at best. We have been to Thailand many times though and we are probably spoiled."}
{"text":"In all the take out orders we have done, they left off a whole order of pad thai and my favorite soup had 4 shrimp when there is usually at least two to three handfuls in the soup. I sent my husband in for the order but they didn't go over it with him which they usually do. I guess everyone can have a bad day."}
{"text":"Great food fresh as can be authentic Thai cuisine!! Soo good!! Thai people will love this place!!"}
{"text":"The service was spot on.  They have a very small bar section (three seats) but for someone often on the road it was perfect. The alcohol selection is very limited (primarily beer and wine) but they make this up with wonderful food. I tried the mild yellow curry with chicken.  A lot of sauce (it could have used some more potatoes and onions) but a strong flavor. Far from fine dining but a great local, casual dining spot."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here a few times. And we will for sure be continuing to go back. This Restaurant has amazing food!! Staff is really nice!! Its hard to recommend any one dish because honestly everything is so good!  If you are ever looking for a private big group event this is also a great place. I had my husbands 30th surprise bday party here. They gave us the outside patio. Owner and staff were very helping and went above and beyond making sure it was nice.  I only had a hour during day to decorate. So i could not go over to many details on how I wanted things set up. I really wanted it too look nice and it set up a certain way. But when we arrived that night it was awesome. Staff put white table clothes on tables. Buffet table was set up nice. They also had a table with with wine, wine glasses, cake accessories. It was great. Big Thank you to owner and staff for a great night! :)"}
{"text":"Wasn't easy to find a Thai restaurant that I enjoyed after moving to Phoenix. Love this place! Love the beef and shrimp fried rice. Also love both Tom Yum and Tom Ka soups! Haven't been disappointed yet!"}
{"text":"The food was okay, certainly was not the best, but it wasn't bad either. Subpar customer service, probably won't return."}
{"text":"Very good! There were 7 of us and we all ordered something different. 3 appetizers, potstickers, wontons and thai toast. All good. Spicy noodles at 3 spice (out of 5) not hot but a green curry at 3 had some bang. The pineapple fried rice was good (also a 3, not hot), the orange  chicken was crazy good, light crunchy and bright. One meal was ordered off the appetizer menu, and while we told them to hold it, it came out with appetizers. One plate came out a little late. Those were the only \"hiccups\" and didn't sway our overall experiance. We all enjoyed it and will visit again."}
{"text":"Best Thai food ever the soups are excellent and I love the Thai tea , very friendly  and clean ."}
{"text":"A wonderful addition to the West Valley.  The food is fresh, wonderful presentation.  The dishes are spiced perfectly.  Standouts are the yellow curry and basil chicken.  Warm, gracious service."}
{"text":"The food and service are amazing. Potstickers, vegetable tempura, yellow chicken, and orange chicken all were the best I have ever had it will not be long before we are back again."}
{"text":"I got to show love to one of my favorite restaurants. It's this misplaced hidden Thai restaurant in Goodyear. Its quiet, never overpacked, and the food is fantastic! My personal favorite is the Curry. The people there are so friendly. If you have a curiosity for east Asian cuisine or a knack for it, this place should certainly be on the top of your must eat list."}
{"text":"Royal Jasmine is my favorite restaurant in Goodyear.  I originally went there for a birthday party never thinking I would fall in love with Thai Food.  I loved it so much that I asked my husband and children to go back the very next night.  It is awesome.  I love the Yellow Curry and Sticky Rice.  My daughter loves the Pineapple Rice.  The service is great!"}
{"text":"This was such a good surprise way out in Goodyear! Very, very good Thai food. I had the spicy noodles, I ordered it medium but had to send it back because it was too spicy for me (and I do like heat, but I'm not one of those crazies where nothing is hot enough...) when it came back, it was a dish to die for... Not too sweet, and perfectly savory and with just the right amount of spice (for me).   Very nice service, especially considering they redid my dish. We were a group of 10 and yet they were very accommodating. I would highly recommend and would go back again!"}
