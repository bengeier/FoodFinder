{"text":"Stacy's Place is located in what was Nick's Italian Restaurant location. I was never a fan of this Nick's location and when I saw a new name I figured I would give it a try. 

Stacy's Place is a family affair, Stacy was sitting in the corner when I entered. They say they have been open for about 10 days and the \"shaking out the bugs\" feel is still in the air. The decor has been redone in a modern, comfortable style. Nothing ostentatious but nice looking and comfortable. When we entered there were only 2 tables occupied (12:15 on a Saturday afternoon). 

We were told to sit anywhere and given menus that were photocopied rather than printed. Not an impressive beginning. The menu is reasonably broad although I found it a bit difficult to read. Stacy apparently likes to rhyme words so there are lots of silly rhymes on the menu - a bit distracting and rather annoying. After looking past the attempted poetry, I found the menu to be rather interesting, lots of homemade items, broad selection. 

The waitress suggested the pulled pork sandwich (she said it was homemade) and a couple other items. I tried the pork, my wife stayed with a (safe) hamburger. The first interesting event occurred 6 or 7 minutes after we ordered... the waitress returned to tell us it would be another 10 minutes of so because they were out of buns and were BAKING FRESH ONES! I didn't really believe it because fresh baked hamburger buns were not touted on the menu. After 10 minutes our food arrived and yes, the buns were clearly home baked and fresh out of the oven. And very worth the wait. 

On my plate was the aforementioned bun, pulled pork that did seem made on site, home made BBQ sauce and homemade coleslaw. And frozen french fries. 

The pork was excellent - a nice bark, very tender meat. The sauce was really noteworthy, sweet and tangy with a nice bite to it. I should have taken a half dozen buns home - they are that good. The fries were not fresh but I did ask for them extra crispy and the kitchen complied (not as common as it should be). The burger was also very good, generous and as well prepared as you can do with a well done burger. 

Stacy's has the makings of an excellent neighborhood spot. Decent prices for the part of town its located in, very good and creative food. Stacy (who stopped by to introduce herself and does like to talk) explained that they would be rotating the menu every few months to keep things interesting. That, combined with a full bar and nice environment can keep me coming back. 

Overall, a very very good experience."}
{"text":"BRING BACK NICKS!! We live close enough to walk to Grayhawk Plaza with our dog so we were excited when another restaurant that allowed dogs on the patio opened in Nick's place.  After receiving paper menus we decided on grilled portabello mushrooms and we each got salads.  The mushrooms arrived on sticks with balsamic dressing for dipping. The salads were definitely edible but VERY bland (and no salt on the tables). The food here is edible, but I could make better at home and that's not saying much as I am NO chef! 
The service went from good to terrible quickly. After giving us our food they never checked on us once. When I went to the bathroom the waitress panicked and said \"oh you probably want the check.\" As she ran around the restaurant trying to handle other customers. 
After over 20 plus mins waiting for the check, and not being asked if we maybe wanted coffee or dessert, my husband finally went inside to get and pay the check. 
If you want bland yet edible food and service that is running around crazy this is the place for you. But at least you can bring your dog with you on the patio!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and ordered fish. Service was nice. The fish (tilapia) itself was fine and had flavor. It was kinda bitter but not offensively so. The rice was rather stale though. I've been here before with the folks too (they ordered the pulled pork & antipasto) and the verdict = nothing special. The menu is like a random mixture of various favorite dishes.

Don't know how they'll keep alive though. Both times I went, the restaurant only had a couple customers during peak eating out hours."}
