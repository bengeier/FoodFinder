{"text":"We had their Canadian  Pizza and garlic bread with the donair sauce. Everything was really delicious. The only thing is their sweet style sauce is very very sweet and I didn't really like it. Next time we'll try the regular sauce. Their donair sauce was also super sweet; was more like cream cheese icing. Going to give it another try though, because it was really good."}
{"text":"Went here for my first time today. What caught my eye was the east coast Donair. I LOVE those. The one at this place was good, but definitely second to the ones I enjoyed at the Halifax Donairs in Milton and Burlington.  The pizzas at this place looked amazing too!! It's a very nice business with lots of choices. Great menu and there is something for everyone. Pasta, Pizza, Fries, salads, chicken and fish and chips, shawarma, Burgers...AND ABOVE ALL...GREAT OWNERSHIP! I met the owner, I think, and he was one of the nicest people you can meet. I loved my first experience there and WILL be back to sure!!"}
{"text":"Pretty happy with that Donair. Been to their flagship location in Sydney tons of times, back when it was Island Greek even.  This is definitely the best and most authentic around.   Took a star because it's a bit pricey, and, just like Sydney, the pizza is brutal  Stick to Donair based items and you're golden"}
{"text":"This place makes the best traditional Donairs I have ever had. They do have other foods on their menu, but I have only had the Donairs. Open late is also a great thing."}
{"text":"Recently opened in Brampton with authentic East Coast donairs as well as pizza and sandwiches. We planned on visiting for donairs but ended up ordering online for delivery. They were exceptionally busy (it's the holidays!) and the delivery was delayed. They more than made up for the delay and brought awesome donairs and a very interesting donair eggroll. We'll be back in person to check out some of the other interesting menu items. The donair pizza sounds interesting."}
