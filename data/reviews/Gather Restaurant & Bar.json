{"text":"Got a coupon in the mail for Sunday Brunch, Buy 1 Get 1. My wife and I remembered the days when that hotel was a Holiday Inn and had a wonderful spread of food for Sunday Brunch, with mimosa's and a guy playing tunes on the piano. Well let me tell ya, those days are gone. Now a days they want 18 bucks a person for a breakfast buffet that couldn't compete with a FREE breakfast at the Motel 6. They call it brunch, but not 1 item could possibly remotely resemble a lunch menu food. We cooked our own waffles at Gathers buffet, just like ya do at Motel 6. We ate salt free mushed potatos suppose to resemble hash brown potatos. It looked more like baby food just like at the free breakfast at Motel 6. When we sat down at our table and told the server we had a coupon, it was like we tripped a switch and instantly became 2nd class citizens on work release at the restaurant for breakfast. I could go on and on about this poorly planned and extremely poorly executed Sunday Brunch but I won't. By now, I am sure you all have a general idea of how we felt about the place. Without the coupon, the Sunday Brunch would have been 36 dollars. Highway robbery that should carry a life sentence of eating 2 for 99 cents hot dogs from Sheetz everyday. We couldn't even justify in our minds being charged 18 bucks with the coupon for the prison food they were serving. Do yourself a favor, get all dressed up and have Sunday Brunch at McDonalds, you will enjoy yourselves a lot more being entertained by all the screaming and crying kids. Your welcome."}
{"text":"I had bright expectations for this restaurant. It was recently renovated and looked like a great hotel restaurant. Pretty decent menu, it was pricey but had the impression of being upscale. Service was nice but he kitchen was slow. But the food was what really disappointed. I had one good dinner, the gnocchi, but the rest were not so good. The fish and chips was pretty basic, I could've gotten better fish at the local Coney Island for half the price. Ordered a chicken risotto with walnuts and squash. The squash was undercooked, walnuts were missing, and they used cheddar cheese in a risotto. Then we ordered cinnamon French toast for breakfast and there was no cinnamon! Just French toast with powdered sugar. It's an okay restaurant, but it's overpriced for what you get."}
{"text":"I don't see why there are so many bad reviews for this place because I felt Gather was extremely adequate for my needs. I've eaten here 9 times spread out over a few weeks between breakfast, lunch and dinner. I mean, you don't go somewhere 9 times if you don't like it right? Also, it's inside the Crowne Plaza hotel and it's quite easy to just walk downstairs. Lol. Let us begin.  Atmosphere/Appearance: Quite cozy and comfy. There may be space for 8 people directly at the bar, tables for maybe 12 in the bar area and another 36 throughout the dining area. Like I said, it's inside a hotel, so there are no outside windows, just big glass ones that allow you to gawk at people dragging their luggage on by. People watching for the win. Very modern and simple feel.  Service: Sadly, THIS is where this place lacks. For breakfast, everything is cool. There's a buffet available so you kinda serve yourself. This could be my fault... but every time I came here for dinner I either sat at the bar or in the bar area. Karen, I believe is her name, bless her heart. Lol. She's so sweet, personable, helpful, funny and did I say sweet? She's just a bit slow. Seems like she may get flustered easily and can be forgetful, but no matter. I'm never in a rush there so I allot a fair amount of time to chill, hangout and eat.  Food: DELICIOUS. I ate here 9 times and had something different almost each time yet the food was on par consistently. Very good. Their buffet is pretty extensive and it's SO MUCH better than Holiday Inn Express breakfast. Lol. They have freshly cooked bacon, grits, two types of eggs, fresh fruit, the list goes on and on. They switch it up too, not the same thing every day, which I loved. I won't go through each entree I've had, but I have managed to get the Vegetarian Omelet, Jumbo Wings, BBQ Pork Quesadilla, Crowne House Salad, Arugula & Fennel Salad, Crowne Burger and California Burger. My favorite of these was definitely the Crowne Burger, in which I added Pepper Jack cheese and bacon. I was also allowed to substitute the fries out for sweet potato fries! Huge portion, savory, messy and full of flavor. My 2nd favorite would be that omelet. It felt good going meatless and it was filled with perfectly cooked vegetables. On one of my salads I added chicken and shrimp, excellent decision, I'll always do the chicken... I'll explain the shrimp in the next section.  Value: (Inhales through teeth.) Well, somethings here are worth it. The burgers, the breakfast buffet and the omelet for sure. Now the wings, definitely not. $10.00 for 6 wings? You crazy. They were good, but ain't worth it. The shrimp for the salad, $6.00 for 3. THEY TRIPPIN'. Even my server knew they were trippin'. When she brought me my salad and it had 3 shrimp on it, I looked at her and she already knew what time it was. I said, \"3 shrimp for $6.00\"? She agreed, went to get her manager and he said he'd throw some more on the grill for me. So I wound up with 6 for $6.00. I felt a lot better about that. Lol. I just won't get shrimp on my salad there anymore. The food is decently priced for the most part though, just don't come in here thinking you're going to spend less than $20.00 for dinner.  In conclusion, this is my go-to spot for eating when I'm staying at this hotel. The food is good, pricing is okay and it's a walk down the hallway. Don't be afraid to ask the front desk for the 20% off coupons to the restaurant, they help reduce the price of the bill dramatically. That's what I did each and every time!"}
{"text":"This was my second time dining at this hotel.  What a disappointment:  I am not likely to return.  The breakfast buffet used to be served in a large, elegant room.  It is now presented in Gathers, a small, modern area where there are few tables.  To start us off on the wrong foot, a large party that was in the hotel for a wedding stood right over us as they loudly said their goodbyes: not management's fault, but indicative of what was to come.  There is a limited selection of mostly mediocre food, not as good as Golden Corral.  The fried chicken was dry, the dozens of pieces no doubt having been sitting in a container for a long time.  The mashed potatoes and gravy were the highlight: homemade, delicious, and the gravy was thick as it should be.  The eggs mixed with broccoli spears were okay. The broccoli was the only vegetable other than add-ins for the omelettes: no mixed vegetable dish. There is an omelette station which produced a decent product, but no salad selection, no pies or cakes for dessert, only some breakfast-type danishes and cinnamon rolls.  The fresh fruit assortment was all melon with three small pieces of pineapple.  Our server was inattentive.  The glasses of water are small and filled with ice.  We were offered but one refill.  The check with my credit card sat for a good while.  There was no reason for this as there were two servers for the room and a maximum of seven customers, including my party, after the large, loud party left.  There was a musician providing entertainment, but it was at times far too loud, overpowering the room. No one in their right mind would pay $17 for this and it was overpriced even with the two for one offer I had.  I could have had a lavish, fresh, and delicious breakfast at Golden Corral, including extensive salad bar, for that price."}
