{"text":"I've been here numerous times, i am just not a big fan. you don't get all the items you order, the staff iis emotionless. and I find the tables are to close for my liking. iits pretty bad when my boyfriend and i's conversation is getting interrupted cause the other table iis talking to loud. we've asked to move to a side booth they told us no our group wwas to small, yet there was other couples sitting there.   good points to tatami. is there sushi is great especially there rose roll and I find there rice to fish ratio great and well balanced"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with my family, and I have to say this is the worse ayce sushi I have been to and I will never return here. First of all the server knocked over our tea and did not even apologize. Second of all the food here is not even hot it was served lukewarm. Last but not least the sushi rolls and hand rolls were served almost frozen. Worst experience ever."}
{"text":"Went there with my family an hour before closing time and the front desk guy was making a lot of excuses (like the area where tables are available is already cleaned up, etc) and eventually succeeded in sending us away. We go there frequently before but not anymore."}
{"text":"I have lived the \"acquire only the best sushi places in town\" lifestyle since I was a sperm. I think I found one that is nothing short of a champion."}
{"text":"They have a pretty consistent service every time we go here. Atmosphere is good, the staff is nice, they have a good and wide variety in their menu. One of our favorite eat all you can place."}
{"text":"Their price for lunch is good ($14.99) but there is no sashimi on the lunch menu and the rolls are average. I didn't even go for a second round. I would say one of my least favourite ayce sushi places I've tried so far. Their green tea ice cream was the highlight."}
{"text":"This is probably the best AYCE sushi in the area.   If you are nice to the servers then they are nice back. Lunch is $33 for 2 people! The lunch menu has a few things left off from their dinner menu. The dinner was $ 22 a person at this writing. The dinner has calamari, mango salad, seared tuna of what I can remember. They have lots of vegetarian offers but their beef ribs and beef and garlic cubes are yummy."}
{"text":"I found out about this place from a coworker and couldn't wait to check it out; my first visit was on valentine's day with some coworkers and the service was great. I came with a large group and they were able to accommodate us without a reservation; we completed our order and within a few mins they were being delivered to our table. I loved the fact that they were willing to accommodate a friend with a shellfish allergy and they did everything to ensure he food didn't mix with ours.   Since my first visit, been back twice; only downside is they don't have their liquor license so will have put my Saki love on hold (for now).."}
{"text":"Nice but an expensive place to eat for the whole family. Not worth bringing your children, since the food is for a more mature palette."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service, but small rolls of dubious quality. Tuna left a bright pink stain on the rice."}
{"text":"Overall a great experience every time I've been. The wait staff could be a little more attentive. Also, if you order a lot all at once, they won't give it all to you. But I can't complain. Some of the best sushi I've had, nice decor, and an amazing price for the selection. Definitely recommended if you have a few hours to kill."}
{"text":"Atmosphere/Ambiance - It's nice when there is not a lot of people here but when this place is crowded it gets really loud and really cramped.   Cleanliness - It's alright, I have not had any problem, but their lights need a bit of dusting.. (sorry, I'm really observant) also one time they served me with plastic cup for water that had a crack on it.. (please throw it out xD)  Service - The service is okay. Sometimes their service is really slow. also one time, I paid with cash, and I'm suppose to get my cash back. Me and my friend sat there for a good 5 minute and one of the server asked what we need help with? I think the server who took my money forgot about me but as a server you are suppose to give customers their change back even if they do not ask for it.  Food - The food is okay too, it's not the best and it's not bad. There are a lot of choice to choose from."}
{"text":"My spouse and I often find ourselves with a sushi craving. Usually that means driving to the places we know and love much further away. Needless to say  we were quite excited to see an AYCE Sushi place finally opening nearby.   Tatami is in a great location. We went to an early movie, did some shopping and then parked to go inside for dinner. I was surprised by how spacious the restaurant was inside. It was nicely decorated as well (Don't let the outside appearance fool you).   We were seated promptly and one of the first things I noticed was that the tables were quite wide. Great for holding a variety of dishes rather than having them all jammed in your face. Another plus was that  there's a full pitcher of hot tea on every table so I never had to wait for my cup to be refilled.   The waiter never asked us if we had been there before, or explained how the order process works (we're both white, they probably shouldn't assume that we know how this works lol). Luckily that wasn't a problem. They also never asked if we wanted anything other than tea to drink. They just took our order form and then scampered back and forth with our dishes. All of our food came quickly, and there was nothing missing but it took awhile before my spouse was able to ask someone for a cola and a fork (still working on mastering those chopsticks lol).  Overall the food was very good. Not a fan of their take on mango salad (too many onions for my liking), but the rolls were good (no filler like some places) & the sashimi was perfectly cool (White Tuna = Yum!)  Next time, and there will be a nice time, we'll try some other things."}
{"text":"the best sushi spot...ive been to million of sushi restaurants (im not exaggerating), and this has great service n food for AYCE. Whenever i go, there's always a nice waiter. Green tea is nice n warm. Came with a big group of friends and other times with my sister/bffl, its always a nice experience"}
{"text":"Their kalbi beef never fails and their sashimi is great overall. I especially like their little bowls of ramen and wontons, those are addictive, I think because of the sesame oil they use to season them.  Been here 3 times now and always leave satisfied."}
{"text":"Really don't want to come back again. We came here on a Saturday for lunch, the food variety is not much. They gave you SO MUCH (close to a full bowl) rice on almost every dish that contains rice. Food is not seasoned well before cooking, you don't get much taste when you bite into the meat."}
{"text":"This place looks dull from the outside  but it is super nice and comfortable inside.  They have an all you can eat menu and it's awesome for catching up on good times and events with friends. The staff is hard to get a hold of to ask them for stuff so you have to ask them quickly when they're dropping off your food. For the most part, the food comes around the same time but pretty quickly. The tables are small especially if you order a little of every dish since they all come on separate plates.   The food itself is delish. It's well seasoned and hot (temperature wise). I can't get enough of this place, I wish my stomach could hold more food!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times. I like the menu but most times the food you ordered aren't the ones coming to your table, or missing. They always forget what you have ordered.  The staff though are nice and courteous. And yep, the mango salad is not so hot :(."}
{"text":"Today was not a good day for the following: - poor service  - charging extra for tea that used to be free - not getting things we ordered in a timely fashion (do I really want beef with dessert?) - serving every other ice cream at lunch except chocolate...apparently chocolate is just for dinner time.   FAIL TATAMI FAIL!"}
{"text":"Horrible service..... hair in my dishes... mopping floor while I'm eating... Horrible manager.... worst experience ever....  never go back ever again..."}
{"text":"I usually leave really positive reviews but the sushi was awful. Especially for a place that charges $26 for their weekend sushi, was expecting much better quality.   Firstly, the AYCE menu on the ipads don't have descriptions so you don't know what you're ordering.   They double up the rice in each roll (you can see it, they roll it twice). They load up each roll with sauces. One looked like they poured mango juice on top. Could barely taste the fish.   The only good things really were the ice cream, and dumplings. DO NOT spend money here for AYCE"}
{"text":"Came for lunch on a Saturday afternoon. Pretty happening place considering an hour left during lunch service, with additional diners trickling in. The service was quick, our food was arrived sooner than expected.   All the food we ordered was well prepared and pretty good. The maki rolls didn't contain too much rice as some restaurants tend to use too much in their rolls. The salmon sushi was good, really liked the beef udon noodle soup bowl, quite tasty. For dessert had mango and green tea ice cream that wasn't evidently pre-scooped and sat in a freezer and generous size serving. The only con was no free tea, just offered water upon seating. Other than that positive dining experience. Would likely come back."}
{"text":"I should point out that I am in no way a hard core sushi fan, I like some sushi but I usually order more non sushi items at these places.  The price is great, the place looks very nice, and the service is good.  The thing that really stands out is how big the menu is, I went for the lunch buffet and there was so many options. Way more than any other place I've been to like this.  Most of the food was good, there was a few items I didn't care for but the rest made up for them."}
{"text":"If you have a sushi craving that you can't budge this is the place to go. Affordable and plenty of selection on the iPad menu (a lot better than their previous paper method)."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre but when I found a long, black hair in my sushi I discreetly told my waitress.  I was told, basically, what did I expect.  No.  I will never return."}
{"text":"We come here at least twice a month, we really enjoy everything they serve. They now use iPads for their orders, the service is good . I can't say anything is wrong with this place as it's one of our favorite place to eat on a Friday evening, if you haven't been then you should make a point of coming here the food is really good."}
{"text":"i hadn't been to any japanese ayce after fushimi (a former favourite) closed last december. having discovered tatami in my neighbourhood, i decided to give it a try tonight  the service was great, and food came quickly chicken wings were crispy red bean ice cream was satisfying most of the things i tried were quite good eel fried rice is huge. beware.  for the price, $23.99 weekend dinner, i think it deserves to be the best japanese ayce in scarborough."}
{"text":"The variety is very limited, quality is below average, service is quite slow and absent-minded. I'm a sushi aficionado and I wasn't impressed even considering this is an all-you-can-eat place; there are many other better options.  I ordered a gold dragon(salmon & shrimp tempura), and green dragon and they had the saddest looking shrimps on the inside- may want to call it a worm than a shrimp.  The hand rolls I got (crispy salmon and spicy white tuna) were so sad looking - the only benefit to their rush attitude and not caring what it looks like or how little fish they put in it - i was amazed how fresh the roll tasted only to not find much fish.  It could be good or better if management cared for better service, better quality fish, and better presentation with the fish.  Oh well!"}
{"text":"Tatami offers variety at a reasonable price, $13.99 (Sunday lunch). There is a good balance between non-sushi and sushi items on the menu so all diners can enjoy. The food is fresh, served quick, and there's always hot tea on the table.  The environment is posh, but cozy with a lounge feel. The servers are friendly and accommodating. From time to time you'll see the manager chat with the diners.   It would be nice to have more options for the dessert menu. Currently, they only offer ice cream (good ice cream). They don't have white tuna sushi, but they do have white tuna makis and sashimi (dinner only). They missed one item from each round, but that seems to be common at most AYCE places and you can order it on the next round.  The restaurant is located in a great area with shops, a Cinplex theatre, and free parking!"}
{"text":"So this was my first time at this restaurant, and I had a great experience.   So my friend and I really wanted to get AYCE sushi dinner, but my friend didn't get off from work until 9:00 PM so we were hunting around for sushi places that did last call at 10:30 PM. We found Tatami sushi, and decided heck, it had good ratings and it also did last call at 10:30 PM, so why not.  We get to the restaurant at 10:00 PM, and proceed to order a ton of food. The food comes, and about 5 minutes to 10:30 PM, the owner comes out and goes to each table asking if we had any orders they wanted to push in before last call. We decide to go ahead and order another huge amount. The owner tells us if we don't finish, we'd get charged a la carte. We thought we could handle it, so we tell him to go forth with our order.  Low and behold, by the end of dinner we are STUFFED, and there is a TON of food left on the table. I estimated roughly $20 worth of rolls on the table at least (4 rolls that we didn't even touch, and some specialty items we barely started on). We're a bit worried at this point, and the owner must have noticed. He comes by and we tell him that we had over-ordered, and that we're willing to pay a la carte (I was ready to see a bill of 20$+10$ at least). He tells us that yeah, it's a common mistake and he often warns customers, and that people often do this near last call. He tells us he'll charge us much lower than a la carte.  He charges us 8$ TOTAL. I am flabbergasted at this point as we would have easily paid much more and still felt good (as we got to take the food for home). The owner goes on and gives us some tips on how to keep the sushi fresh once we take it home, and we pay and leave.  This experience alone made me want to write this review for them, because it is so unusual and made me feel like a valued customer.   In terms of the food itself, I was pleased with the variety and the quality. Amongst other AYCE sushi that I've had, it is average (which is fine by me). Their salmon flower (it's rice wrapped by salmon around the edges) is definitely my favorite, and their rolls are average. The worst dish for me was the eggplant and the ramen.   Overall, I recommend this restaurant - the service was great, and the food was very comparable against other AYCE restaurants."}
{"text":"Have been going here for a few years now. The prices used to be much cheaper...now it's 25.99 for a weekend dinner, used to be at least 2 or 3 dollars less. With tax the difference is quite a bit, especially when you pay for 2 people. They're downgraded their quality, using wooden chopsticks now that have slivers. They used to have free green tea but they don't have that anymore, you have to pay extra for a single serving of tea. Also, if you really like a dish and put down 2 instead of 1 (e.g. calamari, normally 4 pieces, but put down 2, for 8 pieces), they will still only bring you 1 serving. Every time I go, they forget at least one of your dishes, or a few of your sushi/maki/sashimi picks. If you ask them, they'll check on your order but even then it won't come out for a while. Then you order it AGAIN on the paper form and when it FINALLY comes, they bring out 2. Also, some of their older female servers are SO grumpy, you can see it on their faces when they bring your stuff to you. I get that it's busy, but still... So the price is becoming unreasonable for the quality of the food and many of the servers are just not happy. Service IS quick, but I'd rather get all my food that I ordered at once and not wait for that one plate of beef teriyaki for 20 minutes. I usually tip fairly but lately I've felt like not being so generous when I'm not receiving the service that one would expect at a restaurant."}
{"text":"Disappointing AYCE experience.    The atmosphere was good, unique seating, nice lighting & decent noise level for a fairly packed time.  One strange aspect was that half the restaurant has digital ordering while the other half has paper.  The other strange thing was the TVs with the discovery channel on without audio.  The service was better than our last visit though nothing to write home about, it was reasonably quick just no interaction with the server.    What disappointed was the food and there were a lot of problems on this front:  - Didn't taste all that fresh  - Ordered 12 pieces (2 orders) of Crispy Spicy Salmon Maki, received 6 pieces (1 order)  - Ordered Arctic Roll Maki (Crispy Salmon + Rice paper), it barely had any salmon and had Crab + Avacado instead  - Received errant order of cooked white fish  - Teriyaki Salmon was undercooked and/or dry & the teriyaki had been stretched to the point that you could barely taste it  - Yam Tempura pieces are twice the size of the dipping bowl making it frustrating to eat at times   The worst of it, that I wanted to highlight separately, is that there is fish substitution going on.  I ordered Spicy White Tuna Maki and it was plainly obvious that a generic white fish of some sort had been served instead.  It wasn't even a subtle substitution it was blatantly obvious from look to taste to texture that this was a cheap fish not Tuna.  Overall what we did like was average at best, what we didn't like was questionable as to how it made it out of the kitchen.   Would not recommend.  Update:  The fish substituted was likely Escolar or there was spoiled product in our meal as 'laxative' like effects took hold later on that evening."}
{"text":"A friend invited me here for sushi and movie and this place is right next to the theater. Outside looked kind of bland and the inside  has this modern look with neon lights. The staff was super friendly and attentive and it didn't take long for them to seat us or place our order. The all you can eat is a bit more than other places but totally worth it. The fish is super fresh and yummy but not enough menu items with unagi methinks. Not as much variety as some other places but I think I only tried 1 thing I didn't like most of it is yummy. All things considered this place is one of the better sushi places in the city."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times only because I live 5 min away and my favourite sushi place is outside of Scarborough. Every time I come here I end up leaving unsatisfied and wonder why I paid so much $$ for AYCE sushi.   Positive: 1. Service is fast and good every time I come 2. The atmosphere is nice. Classy decorations and great seating for large parties. 3. Sashimi is fantastic. 4. Their desserts are great.  Negative: 1. They do not give you tea but instead water. Very strange for a sushi place. 2. They stuff too much cucumber in their sushi and use it as a filler instead of giving you more fish. The type of rice they use fills you up faster than it should.  3. Their soups are waaayyyy too salty. I feel like the broth is watered down soy sauce.  4. For the quality of food you're getting this place is way over priced."}
{"text":"Location is busy but spacious enough.  Service is average but the quality of the food is sub par. Beef served is like roast beef in sandwiches... Shredded and has a funny taste.  Nothing nice to say about the food.  Not fresh and tasteless.  Skip this place."}
{"text":"For an all you can eat sushi restaurant the sushi is decent .. I like that they don't over do it with the rice... So I ordered grilled veggies and they brought me boiled veggies . Enough said"}
{"text":"What an underappreciated AYCE Sushi restaurant. I've been to over 10 ayce sushi restaurants across the GTA and this is one of my favorite. For an AYCE restaurant, they don't stuff their rolls with rice. Their beef ribs are so juicy and flavorful and their sashimi are fresh and cut really well. The arctic roll is to die for. The service is courteous and friendly. The only small complaint I have is that they don't have complimentary green tea anymore :(  Still recommend Tatami to anyone because the food is so damn good."}
{"text":"Disappointing it's been 2 times already that things taste expired... It's sad how this place has changed it started by being so good..."}
{"text":"Been past this restaurant but never tried it out so decided to try it their lunch ayce.   Great parts:   1. Their grilled meats are really delicious. Grilled beef ribs smokey flavoured ....yum!  2. Service is great. At least our server. One male server actually bowed to us as we left the restaurant and thanked us with a smile. He BOWED.... You don't get service like that unless you really go to Japan or Korea. I think the guy was Chinese and Chinese are known for their rudeness not manners. So props to this guy.    3. Their ice cream was really really good. It is the high quality type with very high fat content. You could tell by the hardness of the ice cream. It finished the meal with a high note.   4. Ayce for 13$ on a weekday lunch is a terrific price. What great value!    The Bad:  The udon and ramen was really bad. I recall it was some salty consume with noodles. Nothing else. The ramen wasn't even ramen.... It was the cheap Chinese thin egg noodles. They should really just remove it from their menu if they are not going to put any effort into making actual food. Fried scallops were also mushy and not very appetizing.   Overall it was a positive experience, and I'll know what items in their menu to avoid next time around."}
{"text":"Nice modern looking place. Service was ok. A bit slow at times. I know it is all you can eat so I didn't have high expectations going in. We just had seafood items. Fish selection was pretty limited. Food was ok. If you really like your sushi, go elsewhere. Not a bad meal. I would give 2.5 stars if I could. You can fill yourself up. Lots of meat and veggie dishes on the menu too."}
{"text":"They rejected giving us a table because we went with a stroller with a sleeping baby...."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. I go to Tatami frequently. I have eaten at AYCE restaurants which have had better food, so I have downgraded my ranking slightly. The reason I eat here is the service. The manager and some of the servers know me and treat me exceptionally well.   There is a beef with garlic item that I like especially well.   For younger people, I think that Tatami is a great introduction to Japanese food."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out since it was right by Cineplex and we had just gotten out of a movie.  On top of that, my friend and I were both craving some sushi so it was perfect.  Place is clean and the service is quick, however, it was too quick.  The con about that is that you get your food which was pretty much pre-made from God knows what time. We ordered a couple of maki rolls and from the quality of it, it just seemed as though they had been sitting in the fridge as they were slightly cooler than room temperature.  Sure that's somewhat okay with the rolls but not so much dishes that are generally grilled such as teriyaki chicken and grilled eggplant.    The teriyaki chicken was very cold as though it had literally just came out of the fridge.  The grilled eggplant was nice but again, it would've been better if it were warm at least.  The Volcano Roll was nothing but just crispiness on the inside with barely any salmon.  It was like they had taken some tempura crumbs and rolled it.    One positive thing about this experience was that their sashimi portions were larger than what you would normally get at an AYCE.  That and ice cream.  Ice cream solves everything.  Well, almost everything since I wouldn't consider going back to this place.  Good ice cream, though."}
{"text":"Pretty good for all you can eat sushi. Most of the time, their food is good. There are times when the food is not up to its usually quality. I think they are just really busy and the quality suffers. 8 out of 10 times they are good.   They have scallop sashimi on Fridays and weekends. White dragon sushi in my opinion is unique to this restaurant only. It is torched white sushi with a crunch! Grilled sushi is also a must try and their black pepper beef is very good if ordered medium rare. Grilled octopus is also served here and I have not seen at any other AYCE sushi place.   Staff here are very friendly and I feel are personally trying to help me."}
{"text":"Great AYCE sushi joint with lots of alternatives. My boyfriend and I always get lots of sashimi and it is always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"So, why is sashimi sweet?  Why is the wasabi sweet?  General not bad but they have added sugar to their food!!! What is going in here???  Who put sugar on sashimi???!!!??"}
{"text":"The only times I have gone here is on my lunch break, because I work close by and it helps give me that Japanese satisfaction when Teriyaki in Eglinton Square just isn't enough.  To be honest, there's a lot more better Japanese AYCE places, but it does what it does for me. The service is good though, but the food is just really .... Eh."}
{"text":"Decent sushi, good service. Beautiful dining. Any beef skewer or chicken skewer you get is mouth watering!!! I will be back and I have been back lol . They need real stir fried veggies though (asparagus,  broccoli, etc)"}
{"text":"I hate to dock these guys a star, but I returned for supper with my girlfriend on Thursday and was left disappointed. To put it simply, Tatami is cutting back.  THE GOOD: - Service is still on point. We placed our order and our food came out almost instantly - it was like magic.  - I do enjoy their food - a lot. Their BC Roll with cream cheese continues to steal my heart. We tried the Pork Steamed Dumplings for the first time, which were also a hit: meaty and succulent. And make sure you leave room for dessert because the mousses and puddings are bomb.  THE BAD: - No more unlimited tea included in the price. I know, I know - it's just $1 extra for tea - but why? I used to love having that big ol' teapot ready at my fingertips when I was ready for another cup. Now I'm being charged extra, and I have to pester them everytime I want a refill.  - They downgraded the chopsticks. The sleek, black tools of wonder from the past have been replaced with sliver-inducing bad boys - the kind you chuck in the garbage after your meal. - I love me some fried bananas at AYCE, but these were underwhelming and smaller than the size of my thumb.  Tatami, why you gotta cheap out like this? I'll probably still come back due to the convenience of the location for me - and the fact that there are no other AYCE alternatives nearby - but don't think that these changes have gone unnoticed!"}
{"text":"Bad customer service. We called to ask what time their kitchen is open till, lady on the phone said 10pm but when we got there, they said 9.30pm ...and argued with us that it wasn't what they said. Walked off. They need to get a grip on long-term guest satisfaction. Also, on Yelp their hours of operation show open until 11pm."}
{"text":"Food is good, but have had better. They upgraded the ordering process by getting tablets. Some of our food wasnt delievered but the waitress brought it right away. Overall its good for dinner/lunch and its close."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and our relatives took us here for some AYCE sushi. Being from Southern California, I was surprised to see sashimi offered on the AYCE menu. In SoCal, that's unheard of! The salmon and clam were pretty good but the white tuna was very watery (at least it wasn't fishy!). The rolls were okay but I'm not a huge fan of rolls anyways. The beef, chicken, fried scallops, and mango salad were good. Overall, I liked the place a lot and wouldn't mind coming back the next time we visit."}
{"text":"Quality was not good, over charged for what it was. They charged a dollar extra for each 6 piece roll of brown rice which made it too expensive Nice salad The miso soup was too salty"}
{"text":"THE WORSE SUSHI I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE! I couldn't even finish eating (and wish I would have never started). The amount of oil my sushi had was disgusting, not even sure if the chicken teriyaki was real chicken, the dumplings made me throw up. The staff is the worse customer service I have ever had to deal with. This place DOESNT EVEN DESERVE one start. Something as simple as a miso soup was truly horrible and probably had one of the worse taste I've tried before. This place should not be open for business!!!! Not even half way our meal and we decided to walk away as we couldn't stand the horrible disgusting taste of the food and terrible service. I strongly recommend to NEVER GO TO THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"service is ok! unfortunately,  it was mouth dry and thirsty after eating every time!  i thought they put lot  of msg on food!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I used to hate sushi (only because I only ever had takeout sushi), and when my cousin took me here, I realized my love for sushi. I don't know how I could ever live without it. What I recommend is the Black Dragon Roll, the tempura  sushi rolls (forgot the actual name), and anything with salmon because theirs is actually amazing. Also don't ever forget to order some shrimp tempura and vegetable tempura (specifically the yams).  Service was nice as well. They refilled a waters as requested and whoever they saw our glasses empty, and they were very quick to attend to you as soon as you need to order or make a request."}
{"text":"Was there on Jun 11 and had the dinner buffet. Being a first timer, wasn't use to the ipad ordering which took a little time as the waiter did not give the proper procedure to press place order after selecting.. However, they were very nice and serve all thje orders timely.. I did enjoy all the entrees I ordered. Had the salmaon maki, salmaon, makerel, tuna sashimi, spicy salmon sushi, beef ribs, tempura shrimp along with plain rice which met all the qualities of excellent food . I was quite pleased and recommend this restaurant to anyone with a Japanese taste and other.. Definitely will go back with comapny.. Thumbs up for this place... Rate 4.5 on the scale"}
{"text":"Tatami Sushi is an all you can eat sushi joint in Scarborough around Warden and Eglinton.  Unfortunately, despite the good looking interior, the food quality is just not that good. I'm not sure how else to describe the food other than low quality. Not only this, but the AYCE is also a bit pricey, especially considering what you get. At least service here appears to be pleasant.   Perhaps the regular menu is better. I'd really like to like Tatami, and I might even return to satisfy those AYCE sushi cravings before a movie one day, but I think for now I'll stick to grabbing sushi elsewhere."}
{"text":"Such horrible service such bad management had dinner sat for an hour and nobody cleaned our table when we asked why No response please see the pictures"}
{"text":"I have been here several times, and I can honestly say, that I've always enjoyed it. The décor is modern and looks fairly clean, sometimes too clean, as their floors sometimes are extremely slippery. The food tastes good, on par with the rest of AYCE sushi bars here. Nothing over the top. The rolls are ok at best, somewhat flavourless in my opinion. They bring out the food fairly quick. Last time they forgot a roll, but that's ok. They do have a large selection of items, especially for dinner. Parking is close by, and they also have a patio, although I haven't seen anyone outside. This place is great, and you won't leave disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been to the restaurant twice for lunch and have not been disappointed the food was great the service was excellent."}
{"text":"Good service, but fairly poor quality - even for cheap AYCE standards. And why no tuna?!? The chicken skewers were surprisingly nice, almost like fried chicken. I have to agree that the sushi was very 'meh' and sloppily rolled. Really, most things lacked taste overall."}
{"text":"This was the first time i had gone to an all you can eat sushi and I would definitely go back to this place again.  The atmosphere was very neat and beautiful. Most importantly the sushi was really good. The shrimp tempura was a little bland but still edible. The miso soup was tasteful as well.   The waitress that served us was exceptionally helpful. As this was my first time going to an AYCE sushi, i was still not familiar with some of the items on the menu. However, the waitress was able to answer all my questions and was very patient although it was very busy."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant. Sushi was great enjoyed every bit of it. Staff are friendly and on stand to get your next round of order.   All you can eat is well worth it. Definitely go there again :)"}
{"text":"The day of my birthday, I was craving sushi. The problem: Finding a good Sushi restaurant in Scarborough.  My cousin picked me up and suggested we try this new place in the Eglinton Town Centre complex. I was game.  The look from the outside wasn't to appealing, as they took over a former restaurant that was there.  But the minute you walked in, it was like stepping into a lounge. The restaurant felt like a lounge you would find in the heart of the city.   They seated us right away and explained how the all you can eat works. We checked out the menu and immediately knew what we wanted. Edamame was the top of the list along with Udon noodles, avocado rolls, sushi rolls, chicken teriyaki to name a few.  We had two servers, one of which went above and beyond, the other, not so much.    The food came fairly quickly. I ordered for no Tobiko and one order came with it. The server who took our order didn't write it down (next time, I'll do it).  But the great part was, the second server was so accommodating, that she said not to worry and just to eat what we ordered and she would bring out the sushi rolls we ordered without the Tobiko.   The food was really good. Not sure how else to say it.  If I cold have held more, I would have ordered a few more different things.   Because it was over the lunch hour, the restaurant wasn't too busy, which was a bit concerning when it felts like they were trying to usher us out without making it look like they wanted us to leave.  When the busser comes to the table and asks if we are finished, and when a server looks at our table and see only beverages, it's hard to no ignore that they may want you to leave the restaurant.  This would be my only complaint.  As it wasn't busy, I didn't think there was a need for them to rush us out.   Overall, I would go back here. It's great to know that there is a good sushi restaurant with decent pricing (average for an all you can eat Sushi restaurant).   If you live in Scarborough and need a good all you can eat sushi restaurant, definitely give this one a try. You won't be disappointed. And with the free parking, why not, right?"}
{"text":"Great service, food and decor. Haven't tried everything on their menu but their sashimi and rolls are great. No complains from me!"}
{"text":"Not a bad place for a AYCE sushi spot. Usually go for a lunch and grab many orders of the beef short ribs (my favourite) and tempora.   Sometimes when you order a lot at one time..they don't bring that exact number you asked for (i don't know why, maybe to be sure that it won't go to waste)  Overall it's not a bad AYCE sushi spot that has a good selection of sushi and non-sushi dishes"}
{"text":"This is the fastest ayce service I've ever had. Order from an iPad and they'll bring it to you in 5 mins or less, even when it's busy. Not too cheap but the food quality and attentive service is worth it. The server attitude isn't award-winning but they do fill up water frequently without asking, and never gave us any attitude."}
{"text":"I have now been here several times since this place first opened a couple years ago. This is definitely not one of my favourite AYCE sushi places.  I do enjoy the decor and set up and they have a couple of seating area that would seat a good 12 people in each, should such a large group come by.  But I find that the sushi is not always consistent. Sometimes fresh fish, sometimes not to so fresh. The menu for the weekend dinner is large, but it's almost too much. They have beef steak and beef teriyaki with no explanation as to the difference. Most places sell a beef teriyaki that is a sliced beef \"steak\" in tereyaki sauce. This place sells beef tereyaki which is shredded, with tereyaki spices and looks like it should be in a Philly cheesesteak sandwich.  They have tea cups, but serve you water and don't mention tea at all. The dinner on a Friday night comes out to $28 and change for an adult with tax (PRICEY!!) and they charge extra for soft drinks. Although why anyone wants to drink soda with sushi is beyond me, but apparently people do this.  I'm often surprised this place has lasted as long as it has. But then I recall that this part of Toronto is sorely lacking is decent-great sushi options and this is the only AYCE sushi house in this particularly neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Staff was nice and friendly but food wasn't great. Too much rice in sushi rolls that were also smashed, sushi pieces werent formed properly and everything fell apart, and soups were bland. Selection was also very limited and I found myself scrolling through the same menus over and over. The worst part was that they gave us cheap takeout WOODEN chopsticks. However some staple items such as tempura shrimp were decent. You can't expect too much for 17.99 lunch but other places I've been to for the same price are much better. Give it a try if you're in the area and want to satisfy a craving."}
{"text":"Great time. Fast service. Good looked great. Tasted good. Ice cream was great! Order 2 though. Coconut pudding was good. Will return."}
{"text":"I decided to try out Tatami a new Japanese AYCE buffet before I went to see a movie last night. It's definitely an interesting addition to the area since there are no real places to get sushi in that particular area especially an AYCE.  From Monday - Thursday dinner is $20.99 plus tax and Friday to Sunday dinner is $22.99 plus tax and a gratuity is not automatically added on like most Japanese AYCE restaurants in Scarborough.  Food:  Sushi/Sashimi: The maki rolls weren't bad, the execution was a little sloppy but the rolls were somewhat fresh and wasn't overloaded with rice. The sashimi was pretty decent also, it was somewhat fresh and nicely cut, not too thin or thick. The selection was also decent but not very large but it includes all the basics like salmon, white tuna, butterfish and etc. Keep in mind my expectations are different for AYCE than say a high end Japanese a la carte restaurant.  Grilled food: The grilled food was pretty average with nothing really outstanding other than the grilled teriyaki short ribs. The grilled vegetables offered were more or less the same as other Japanese AYCE in Scarborough (grilled eggplant, fried mixed vegetables and mushrooms).  Dessert: One thing that was really disappointing was the dessert offerings, they only had a few choices of ice cream available on the menu and not even chocolate surprisingly and a few choices of pudding. I was really shocked when told me they had run out of pudding at dinner since their dessert menu was so limited already and out of half your desserts at 6:30pm on a Sunday night?  Service: Service was pretty slow, I had the feeling our waitress had good intentions but her section wasn't too big and she seemed really inexperienced.  Decor/Cleanliness: Since it's a new restaurant, the decor is pretty modern with a lot of dark colours and the washrooms are clean and well kept.  Overall it's a great addition to the area since the nearby surrounding area doesn't have a Japanese AYCE restaurant and it's situated right next to the movie theatre but they definitely need to improve the speed of their service and increase their dessert menu because it's pretty embarrassing for an AYCE."}
{"text":"I took my boyfriend here for a last minute date because I was in town. I've been here a few times and I wasn't disappointed. We ordered quite a lot of food and they had no problem bringing them over. In the past, I've had them forget some of my dishes. However, even though it was very busy by the time we came, they remembered everything. The staff was very polite and accommodating. And the food was good as always.  I recommend the fried rice and the green dragon roll. Those are always my go to items and I always get seconds. If you have room for dessert, I recommend the green tea ice cream. The portions there are a little small for dessert but I guess it's because how many people can actually leave room for it after they eat dinner here.  However, do not order any alcohol other than perhaps sake. The cocktails are really watered down and they have put too much ice when serving beers."}
{"text":"My first impression of this place wasn't great one because i used to not like sushi, until i came to this place. WOW. Their sushi is amazing! Not only is this place an all-you-can-eat for a fair price, but the quality of the food is perfect! They're service is fast and friendly. Perfect place to take someone for a date or a night out with the girls or buds. Although, the lighting in the bathroom needs to be brightened up because it just feels too dark. But other than that this sushi place looks great inside. They play music throughout the day, a lot of people arrive during the night and weekends so you might want to make a reservation just in case. The only catch of this place is if you can't finish what you ordered you must pay for it, seems reasonable. The location of this place is also great because you can always catch a movie afterwards or before your meal since it's right next to the Eglinton theater. Unless If you don't like sushi I don't think this is the place for you, but i would say is just try it because it's a mind blowing taste. I can't wait to visit Tatami again."}
{"text":"Pretty nice looking restaurant with booths and seating good for big groups. They can even reserve a section for private group parties that's closed off by folding screens. They do need to do a better job keeping the carpet clean though.  We tried the AYCE lunch ($18.99). You use an ipad to order, which keeps track of what you ordered and the time the order was placed. Lots of attentive and efficient staff to take care of diners' needs, most are cordial but you get a disinterested one once in a while.  POSITIVES: - Sushi comes out super quick after you order - You can order the sushi one piece at a time, good for trying something out before committing to a bigger order. - Wait staff is good about topping off water glasses. - Dirty plates are cleared quickly and often.  Food quality is meh, fried items were oily and the \"grilled\" salmon belly was actually battered and fried (yummy but oily). My favorite item was the tender grilled short ribs; I could make a meal out of that and their yummy sweet, sticky rice. Complimentary ice cream comes with lunch; choices are found not on the ipad, but on small order sheets where the pencil and chopsticks holder is.  BASED ON LUNCH SERVICE ON FRIDAY"}
{"text":"Probably the best AYCE I've been to, due to the variety. I've been to a few AYCE restaurants and while some served their standard quality dishes, they didn't serve AYCE portions, or others only had a couple of items that were actually worth ordering while the rest was pretty much bad. I generally don't go to AYCE due to the high cost that usually leaves you with less food per dollar. While a standard meal will give you leftovers to enjoy at home, AYCE generally gets you one $15 meal's worth of food for nearly double the price. Tatami Sushi surprised me; I ended up eating a large variety of dishes and didn't dislike any of them. I definitely got my money's worth!  I don't recommend the rolls, at least not until you've tried everything else. They are the right size for AYCE but they really don't have any flavour. Overall, they are boring and will just keep you away from better choices.  The skewers are pretty good. The mushrooms are great. The sashimi is good. The scallops weren't overcooked but also had no flavour. The other cooked fish choices are very good.  I suggest trying one of everything on the menu. Order starchy items last (rolls, breaded items).  I believe someone at the table ordered teriyaki beef and I found that, although it was a bit rubbery, the flavour was nice.  The absolute best dish was the black pepper beef. I had to order it twice, one of the times in the middle of dessert. It was perfectly cooked.  Dessert was alright. Standard ice cream choices and a chocolate mousse. There was some pudding as well. All dessert items were nice. They seem to store their ice cream properly. I think I ate two servings of ice cream and three servings of chocolate mousse. There were quite a few empty dessert bowls at the end of our meal."}
{"text":"Good price among all these sushi all you can eat restaurant.Convenient location, close to movie theater and gym. Do not even mention their grill short ribs, best of the best."}
{"text":"THE NEGATIVES: -Waited 30 minutes to get a server to take our order  -another 15 minutes to get water (and the only reason we got water was because we had to ask for it)  -out order came in tiny parts (so essentially we ate a plate of sushi and had to wait 10-15 minutes to get another plate of sushi)   -We felt like we had to hunt our server down (even the people sitting behind us had to keep hunting down their server)  -when we finally got a hold of a server (any server at this point), when ask asking questions to the server, you could tell she was really inpatient with us  -after asking for the bill, we had to wait almost 30 minutes to receive it (having to ask for it twice might I add)  THE POSITIVES: -Food was amazing! Tastes fresh!! My personal faves were - the Tempura veggies and shrimp, Rose Roll and the Spicy Crab Roll  -dessert was yummy. We got the mango and green tea ice cream  FINAL THOUGHTS:  It just really sucks that a restaurant with such amazing food has really crappy service. If it weren't for the service I would have honestly rated this place 5 stars. I would suggest that management hire more staff to work especially on busy days. Would I recommend this place? Yes, but with a warning that the food is good but the service is bad."}
{"text":"Nice AYCE sushi spot. Service was good and fast. Only complaint the restaurant was freezing which made it hard to get comfortable to really chow down."}
{"text":"Nice modern atmosphere. Great place for a date night or special gathering.  Good prices.  Cocktails are $5, which made me really happy.  I had the Pina Colada and it was on point.  Not the best I've had though, only because my tempura were cold.  Other than that, I enjoyed my bento box.  Friendly staff, was pleased with their service.  Would go back."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to go for sushi. The food is incredible and always comes quick. I try to come with my friends as much as I can. Be careful when you come in because it addicting! The only thing that needs work is the service, other than that I recommend you eat here!"}
{"text":"My fiancée and I love sushi. We were really excited when tatami opened up a few months after we moved into the neighbourhood. I have to say I'm pretty disappointed. This was my 5th time eating at this restaurant and I will not be going back there.   Food: I found the food to be pretty amateur. You can tell the avocado had been out for way to long giving it a slimy texture. The sushi was cut and made way to large and you couldn't just pop it into your mouth.   Service: I ordered items in multiple visits that I never received. This time it was my miso soup and salad. The fastest thing to arrive to us was the bill. They never gave us the wasabi and ginger until we asked for them. They didn't even bring us water."}
{"text":"3 stars. Wouldn't necessarily recommend, but also wouldn't tell you to avoid the place at all costs.  Location: Lots of parking, and easy to get to.  Price: Average, both for all you can eat and a la carte.  Food: Okay. Just okay.   Service: I felt rushed, and on the day that we ordered a la carte instead of AYCE - felt very judged by the servers and quality of service/attention went down."}
{"text":"This place has AMAZING service!!! Reasons why I always come back! No matter how many people are in the restaurant they always get your food to you quick!! I really enjoyed their black pepper beef! I've had better sushi before... I would give their sushi a 7/10 but their service makes the experience so much better  Good place to reserve if you have a big party"}
{"text":"It's right down the middle. The staff are good, but not great. The food is tasty, but often misses the mark. The place is clean, but not the washrooms, so I wonder if they know I can see the restrooms, what does the kitchen look like that is not visible to the public?   I mean, it's the McDonald's of sushi all you can eat restaurants. Therefore, if you set your expectations to this level, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"While I put my rating as a 4 star, I would say, it is more of a 4.5.  We have come to this place every year for my kid's birthdays since it opened and I have to say I have loved almost everything that I have tasted.  My daughter goes here with her friends at least a few times every month that I know about - it could be more.  The reason I deducted 1/2 a star, is because I would really appreciate better descriptions on their menu since I am not that familiar with everything as it is listed.  I had ordered a couple things during our very first visit that I was sorry I did, but choked down since I asked for it.  I have been a little gun-shy on subsequent visits to be more adventurous.  I have been to several restaurants over the course of my life and I honestly don't think I remember being to one that didn't have some type of descriptor to accompany the name of the dish; even maybe just a picture would be helpful for someone that is unfamiliar with names that aren't self explanatory to one unfamiliar with Japanese food.  Our last visit went very well, since I looked their menu up on here (thanks to another yelp poster for providing pic's), and was able to google many of the items to find out what they actually were.  I discovered that I had been missing out on several items that I would have loved to eat simply because I didn't recognize the name on the menu and was afraid to order something I may not like.  My favourites are the teriyaki salmon and chicken curry (I wish I could order the curry to take home so I could have it again-next time I go I am going to ask), and my daughter loves their short ribs and salmon sushi.  Overall, this place is a 4.5.  Awesome food.  Service is prompt."}
{"text":"Terrible experience. Had dinner once and will never come back. Customer service is horrible and they are incredibly cheap with their AYCE options. Sushi quality is also very low. Never again!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times and the quality is pretty consistent. The sushi is ok, the sashimi is pretty good. The rolls are not good. The black pepper beef is excellent! In general, this is a good all you can eat Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"The best all you can eat sushi in east Scarborough. The 3 of us got a table on Saturday at 8pm with no wait and no reservations. It was really busy, but the service was super quick. There's a lot of variety of food  on the menu and the quality is really good. They use real ramen noodles for the soup. The green tea is roasted. The sashimi is fresh. The portions are really reasonable so you can try many different things, not like other sushi places where they give you a lot of the same food. The price was $23.99 for an adult. Total came up to $30 with tax and tip."}
{"text":"Decent spot for AYCE sushi in Scarborough. It's usually my go to when I crave sushi just because the lunch price is fair and the food is decent. Nice to see they have updated to ipads as well, it used to be a bit of a game of roulette with the paper system; you would never know what would or wouldn't show up! Tip: the curry sucks, it's supremely bland."}
{"text":"I have been here many times, but last night was exceptionally amazing. Let's say it's been more than 3 months since the last time I ate here and there's already a number of improvements worth noting:  1. they now have a tablet for ordering food (easy to navigate, and order comes in an instant) 2. the drinks now come in cans but still refillable, which means new drinks in cans will be given once you request it 3. the salmon sashimi will arrive in a plate of shaved ice. better presentation and fresher salmon (buttery!) -- for me this is a deal breaker if it's not good.  Service still excellent, we were not hurried or there is none of that 2-hour limit bullshit like in other ayce restos.  They now do an automatic 15% service charge for large parties. That's OK because I have no complaints with the service I got.  Will always be back. Will try other places, but will always be back to this place. Tatami, please just get better and better!!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend took me here for Valentine's Day, we pretty much came in here expecting the place to completely packed but surprisingly it wasn't at all. We were seated quickly and waitresses didn't rush us to order.   Pros: - Big fatty slices of sashimi - iPad ordering system - Quick and welcoming service  Cons: - Ordering system was confusing especially the dessert portion, iPad menu had a section for dessert and they also had a check off sheet on the table"}
{"text":"The food came very quick, but that was the only thing good about this place. The salmon is clearly not fresh. Some of the other things we ordered were satisfactory. The service was..... Horrendous. The gentlemen were better than the ladies who were on the shift. One lady threw the food onto the table. Our plates were dirty, so we had to ask for another. NOT coming back to this place again. We were supposed to go to ten-ichi, but that closes on a Sunday. The ladies don't smile. Maybe the pay is bad, I understand that people have off days. BUT other than that I would rather spend $16 elsewhere."}
{"text":"It's a decent place for sushi. Not the best but it's not horrible. AYCE has a pretty good selection. My favourite thing that they offer is the salmon teriyaki. The sushi is average, but service makes the place better as the servers are always walking around, available to help and super nice!"}
{"text":"We came here for some dinner as we were in the area running some errands and finished really late. We were too full to do AYCE so we just ordered some a la carte stuff. Basically we just ordered their medium platter with mixed sushi, maki and sashimi.  The sushi was not too bad, but the rice to fish portion was not very good. too much rice! The maki was average, nothing really spectacular about them. The sashimi I will say are pretty fresh, and I did enjoy that. Their rice didn't have vinegar in them though so overall it's average if you want some sushi, but I wouldn't necessarily come here for a la carte sushi. maybe for AYCE."}
{"text":"We went there for my sister's birthday and they sadly had no special deals for that.  The price was great. The food was great. No complaints there.  The person who \"greeted\" and seated us was not very friendly. The next two servers however were much more friendly and willing to \"serve\". We did feel a bit \"unwanted\" at some point though. Everything about this place is amazing and it has very high potential if it wasn't for the non-friendly, unapproachable staff."}
{"text":"Everything was pretty good until I got food poisoning from the salmon, lmao. But if we're trying to be optimistic, it was a pretty damn good salmon so at least I had a nice meal before the chefs nearly sent me to the same place they sent the fish, lolz."}
{"text":"I know next to nothing about sushi or what makes it \"good\" but I really dig this place. Especially for lunch, great price. A little steep for dinner but I'm sure it's comparable to any other AYCE sushi spot.   Everything seems to taste nice and fresh to my palate, though I have no doubt it's frozen.   Staff is average at best I'd say. They are pleasant enough when they notice you might need something, but getting their attention can be a bit problematic. Also some of them get a bit rude or almost sarcastic when you want more than 1 round of food (hello? It is all you can eat, I didn't come here to be polite and proper...I came to pound down some tasty sushi for my carb up)  Plenty of parking, it's in your run of the mill Big Box, made of ticky tacky SmartCentre outdoor \"malls\""}
{"text":"This has become my go-to AYCE sushi place. It's a little out of the way, but having ample free parking makes up for the drive.  The service isn't the greatest, and literally every time I've been there they've forgotten at least one item on my order. It's also damn near impossible to flag someone down to get the bill. That being said, the food is consistently good (just steer clear of the ramen and short ribs) and there is a decent selection. The sashimi is always the right temperature and the tempura items are less greasy than I've seen at other places.  I definitely recommend going for lunch on a weekday to get the best value and (marginally) more attentive service."}
{"text":"Had a very nice All-You-Can-Eat Sushi dinner with my co-workers after yesterday's shift.  It's so close by.  For $21.99, I was ready to stuff myself sushi silly with my favourite Salmon & Unagi BBQ Eel!  We were seated at the big square table in which you have to step over the seat to get in.  It was really nice because we were right the middle of the restaurant.  A nice setting and a lot of space to put our sushi goodness on the table.  We ordered from the big sushi menu, penciling in our selection and giving it to one of the waiters.  We were doing this throughout the night.  There was a lot of selection but I usually go for what I like, which is just fish and plus, I am allergic to shellfish.  The sushi came to our table within 10 to 15 minutes.  It looked pretty good and tasted pretty good too.  The presentation of the sushi was a little messy but all around, again, we're just putting these down the hatch anyway.  Some of the salmon sashimi was a little tendony/chewy but was doable.  The Salmon Sushi was great.  The Unagi BBQ Eel only came in maki rolls.  It didn't have the eel listed in the sushi kind which I was disappointed with.  This ain't no Makimono in Pickering!  Staff were helpful and came around often clearing our table which was expected.  They did however forget 2 of ice cream which we got for dessert.  Other than that, splendid time, great people and setting, good food."}
{"text":"Tatami is one of the best AYCE sushi places I have been to. The food is always super fresh and very flavorful, very important qualities when talking about sushi. My favorite dishes are the pepper beef, fried rice, and any and all of the sushi and sashimi.   The servers are very attentive and the food is always delivered quickly. It does sometimes get busy so if you have a big group, make a reservation, I suggest reserving one of the big middle tables- they are great for bug groups and make the experience even more fun.   Now that I've gone through all of the positives the only things I wouldn't recommend are the ramen dishes and the udon noodles, they aren't very flavorful and not really worth filling up on.   All in all this is an amazing AYCE place with great service and a really nice atmosphere. I would highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I stopped in here last minute with my Mom because she was starving & it looked like the best option for our situation. To keep this review nice & short. I don't plan on coming back.  We ordered off the menu, not the AYCE. I got a sushi dinner with miso soup & salad. My Mother got a bunch of appetizers. My sushi dinner was not the best. The fish didn't taste/look fresh. My Mom said her food was fine.   The service was super attentive. Almost to the point of annoying.   Overall I don't plan on coming back."}
{"text":"Solid work lunch today. Clean restaurant with very fast service due to their iPad ordering system. Our glasses were constantly filled, food was kind of thumped down rapidly on the table as the servers rushed away. All you can eat made it a reasonable and very filling option.  What I liked: Sushi: salmon, white fish, shrimp Rolls: dynamite, dragon, spicy salmon Agedashi tofu Tempura: shrimp, yam  What I did not like: Teriyaki beef (sauce was different colors of opposite sides of the plate, shredded so finely it looked almost pre-chewed) Teriyaki chicken (texture of meat was off)"}
{"text":"After my fav sushi place closed down, I have been in search of my new sushi go to place ( yes, it's that serious). Kikus (horrible service), Matsuda ( poor serving method), Osaka (rice not sticky), and I could go on and on w the sushi places I have visited. However, I recently went to Tatami after a long time and I think I don't have to look any further as this place meets my expectations ! Ipad ordering is great because it shows the pictures & its fast, food is fresh, rice is on point, service is polite and charming, decor is nice! I def recommend"}
{"text":"If you don't want to travel too far north just to go to All you can eat sushi place. This is a good place, regardless how good or bad compare to other sushi place."}
{"text":"Before I always went to this place with my family(4-7 people )Because food was good.  Since 2 months ago I went there with family . The food taste yuck  , we thought they changed chef ,and service is really bad. In this restaurant nobody knows how to serve customers. They always miss ur order! Today I went there with family again. The green salad was really bad. We put the green salad on the side. When waitress took them ,they didn't ask why we didn't eat them ( the green salad was first food they sever us )  , when we almost done.  I asked old guy where were wonton soup. They old guy said \" if u Oder they will come \" fuck. They never come ! Then I asked another girl about wonton soup.  The soup came with our dessert same time ! The coconut pudding glass was so dirty. I asked them to change another one.  This time I noticed they increase the price.  They charged the green tea. Everytime we gave good tips. But service was really bad. They always miss ur a couple of order ! Last time we all were not happy.  Today We are  not happy neither.  Definitely We will not come back again ! They will lose more regular customers !"}
{"text":"I've been to Tatami for lunch about three times, and although I like the food and I think the value is great for the price, the service is certainly inconsistent.   You have to usually flag down the servers to come to your table, and if the manager (who is very friendly, by the way) offers to bring you soup and/or salad, you're probably not going to get it unless you remind him! Also, the first time we went, we were offered ice cream at the end of our meal, which was included in the AYCE price. Since then, we've never been offered it and have needed to ask. Sometimes we haven't even bothered though if we can't seem to get the attention of the servers.   Order a whack of stuff at once so that you won't need to much from the servers later. I personally love their Alaska rolls, teriyaki salmon, tempura yam rolls, and most of their udon noodle soups."}
{"text":"Went here recently and I agree with whatever commenter said they were meant to feel rushed. I don't think they intend that though (just intend really good service, but it ends up feeling like you're rushed). Went here with a good friend to find a new good sushi place (a lot of places go down hill after a while) and we came at lunch but wanter dinner (no problem here), but several waiters (atleast 3, including I think the manager/owner) came by and double-checked that we actually wanted the dinner/to point out the fact we had the dinner menu and that the price was different. Not bad, by any means, just became comical after a while.  There's no real \"menu\" with pictures, just the order form that has the names, how many pieces/if it's a plate, and sometimes a bit of a descriptor (what vegetables/seafood is in it). Since this was our first time, we were taking a bit to go through the menu and decide what we wanted to eat. I imagine in efforts to provide good service waitstaff came by no less than 5 times in 10-15 minutes we were reviewing the menu to ask if we were ready to order. Again, not bad, just became comical after a while.  One of the waitstaff came by to take our salad order/drink order while we were deciding, and when she dropped them off, asked us to cross them out before we handed the menu over otherwise we'd get duplicates (understandable!). My friend decided to erase them instead and the manager/owner (a real type A guy) noticed this and tried to explain to her that she could just save herself the time and cross it out. It wasn't as if the eraser did a poor job though, so while I appreciate his concern for us, it seemed a bit weird/almost micromanaging us/how we ordered. The same owner/manager spent some time arguing with a server in another language right beside out table about the menu being the dinner menu despite it being lunch time (I think it was the server who had the problem since he already validated we did in fact WANT dinner not lunch), which again isn't horrible just a little weird/comical.  Everything was super fresh and delicious. The sushi was served on really warm rice, and the sashimi was melt in your mouth! The only complaints I have is that the spider roll (soft shell crab) tasted really bitter. I traced it down (eating it's components individually) to the cucumber and I wonder if it was because they didn't peel the cucumber's skin (it wasn't the edible skin kind)? A piece of the avacado in the same roll had started to brown, but it was just the tip, (and there were no other pieces of avacado in our sushi that was brown) so I chalked it up to a one time experience.   The lighting and ambience is super beautiful, the booths are big and comfortable, and if you have a group of 6-10 people, you get to sit in one of the special booths in the middle of the restaurant which is supposed to simulate those rooms that some sushi restaurants have where you sit on the floor (you don't, it's just one solid seat for the two tables, going around each table, with a hole for the table to sit, and your legs to go if you don't feel comfortable sitting on your legs traditional style).  My friend's only real complaint I believe lied in the fact that a roll she ordered specified shrimp, avacado and crab, but didn't indicate there was going to be mayo. (Yes, I'm guessing she could've asked, but usually when they serve crab it's those crab sticks, and not crab salad? so who would've known?) hence why I think the restaurant would really benefit from a picture menu (even if it's just the special rolls, and one per table or something).  What I really enjoyed about this place was they emphasized if something didn't come... LET THEM KNOW, don't just order it again (again why I think they were striving for excellent customer service all along). They also gave back the used order forms so you could keep TRACK of what you ordered! Genius! I wish more AYCE sushi places did this!  Order after order was filled, and eventually came the time for dessert. They have a good selection of ice creams and mango pudding but that's about it (which is fairly typical I've found, but I'm just letting you know...) As soon as we ordered dessert they dropped off the bill (which I agree can be made to make you feel rushed, but... what's worse, getting the bill and paying when you're ready or spending 10 minutes trying to flag the waiter down when you really just want to pay and go?) We were able to order seconds on dessert without any problems, and I was able to pay by debit at the table (love it when restaurants have that!). Another misunderstanding sprung from me paying early though was the assumption that my friend was ready to pay and since they had the machine there they turned to her and asked if she was ready (while she was still eating dessert no less, haha), so understandably she was not impressed. They didn't push her though, and quickly left, leaving her to finish dessert and pay cash when she was ready."}
{"text":"Service was decently fast but they had  limited options for lunch AYCE. The atmosphere and cleanliness of the restaurant was just okkk, you can definitely tell it used to be a diner before.   Unfortunately we found a hair in the ice cream, and after informing the manager they gave us a small discount on our bill.   I wouldn't necessarily recommend this place, but I will  definitely will not be returning. there are much better sushi places in the area."}
{"text":"I came here with a couple of friends on Good Friday. The first thing I did not like about the restaurant was that they white out the price. When I verbally inquired about the price, it went up by $1 for lunch making it $14.99.  What I do like about this restaurant is that they give you a piece of paper and you can tick off exactly the amount of items you want. They serve the food very quickly and they give you everything you ask for. They also don't bring the fried stuff first to fill you up.  Overall, I would come to this restaurant if you're craving AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"One of the best AYCE sushi restaurants I have been too!  A+ for the fast and good service.  The sushi menu was great, lots of variety and it all tasted amazing.  Came here on a weekday dinner and it was a little pricey,  came up to $31 after tip and tax."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place. We went to the movies but stopped by for some lunch, only had 45 minutes and it was perfect, we ordered what we thought we could eat, very fair price, ordered some more and it all came very fast.  It was our first visit and I don't have any experience with this type of \"order what you can eat\" so just wish someone would have explained the procedure. Otherwise great and we will be back. Also very nicely decorated."}
{"text":"AYCA Sushi is my weekend must-have, and Tatami Sushi is definitely in the top ten of my Weekend AYCA Sushi list. I had better AYCE Sushi with better quality, but the combination of very fast food service, a decent menu with a lot of options, and good price ($14.99 for lunch in weekend) of Tatami Sushi makes it outstanding.   Tatami Sushi located in a huge shopping plaza with plenty free parking. My boyfriend and I arrived around 2:00 Sunday afternoon, and we had no trouble finding parking at all. Tatami Sushi has a pretty big dinning area, and we only waited couple minutes for our table.   Compared with other AYCE whose menu is very small and has only limited items, Tatami Sushi has a very good lunch menu, including seaweed salad which is the favorite of my boyfriend, more than 15 different Sushi, and all kinds of noodle and reman.  Of course, their noodle is AYCE level quality, but I still feel satisfied considering how much money I paid for it.  I would say Tatami Sushi has a pretty FAST service. We handed in our order, and one minute later miso soup, and salad were on our table already. Other things came very fast too. However, they did missed two items on our order but I will give it a pass because we kinda ordered too much and wouldn't be able to finish all of them anyway."}
{"text":"The staff were extremely rude to my friend and I. They responded to our questions in a rude manner and did not care about serving us. The sushi was tasty tho."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! A friend and I went for dinner on a Tuesday night, no reservations needed. The place is huge, definitely able to accommodate large groups and families. The menu is varied and the food is good. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here often since we live around the neighbourhood. The price is decent, food is good and the service is fast. One thing my husband really like about this place is the fact that they always get us what we asked for unlike some AYCE restaurants who always get our order mixed up or even forgotten. So I would recommend this place to any AYCE lovers out there."}
{"text":"We drove by Tatami while going to the movie theatre in the same plaza at Eglinton Town Centre before. Today we decided to go and check it out for lunch - what a mistake. Their weekend lunch special is $14 something.  They were quite busy on this particular Saturday but its a large restaurant so we were able to get a seat promptly.  Our sushi came surprisingly fast and the service was good BUT the sushi was not that great.  The rice was soggy and sushi rolls were on the lower end of your typical Chinese run AYCE sushi places. I would scratch Tatami off my list of places to visit.  I will mention that I did not try any of their cooked dishes like assorted ramen dishes, tempura, etc."}
{"text":"My brother recommended this new sushi spot to me. From the outside, it looked kind of .. Tacky with the neon lights and the \"Ponderosa\" type roof.. but when I walked inside it was very modern and contemporary looking. Cool Lounge vibe!  The sushi is great for all you can eat. Nice and fresh and they have a pretty wide selection for the all you can eat Lunch menu. More than I've seen at other places. Which is nice. The dinner menu is much bigger and lots more options!  The staff is attentive and the manager comes by to every table to chat and make sure everything is ok. I like that they give you your own tea so that stays nice and hot while you're there.   I like this place. It's my new regular all you can eat spot to go to, mainly for the broad selection. The quality is not over the top better than other places I've gone to, although it is a bit more fresh than most.. but the variety of the menu is what keeps me coming back.  They currently don't have their liquor license which stinks, but I'm sure they'll have that soon."}
{"text":"Actual customer service is better than most of the all-you-can-eat sushi places - but I got rejected when I placed an order for more food. The waitress tells me we have too much on the table right now. Never knew there were restrictions. ?. And they added the tip at the end in handwriting saying this is how much it's going to be with tip. ?. Thought that was different. Good thing the waiter calculated a tip that's fair or I might just be really upset. Never had a waiter do that to me before. And I've had better sushi at other restaurants. Plus, the conditional pass by the front door makes me wonder..."}
{"text":"Service: extremely fast and reasonably friendly Appetizers: I had Edamame, pork katsu and gyoza. They were all pretty good Sushi: was a little disappointed. The mackeral sushi was very tender. The salmon sushi was also tender and not chewy. However the salmon sushi was small. I also feel the rice was lacking.  Rolls: I got spicy salmon and spicy white tuna rolls. They were okay. Just a little small.   Overall I would say it was a positive experience even if the sushi wasn't amazing."}
{"text":"I must say that this is a pretty good AYCE sushi place in this neighbourhood. The price is pretty much the same as all the other ones at 23.99$ on weekends (that doesn't include soft drinks). It seems quite crowded due to the layout, but there is quite a bit of seating which is great. The food quality was pretty good and it arrived really fast. The service was cold and brief as usual due to the nature of the restaurant, but they were helpful when we asked for extra ginger and wasabi. The pieces of sashimi were pretty big and the rolls were small enough not to stuff yourself with rice. Overall, I found it to be a pretty enjoyable time and the food was great. I would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"Went for the first time a for lunch was so busy but the food was delicious.. the waiter was very helpful and the environment was clean and modern"}
{"text":"The quality here has really fallen off. I used to really love visiting this place with my family, but within my last 3 visit I have seen the portion size decrease drastically and the quality in the food is no longer the same, the taste also is not as good anymore. Really sad to see the negative changes that have occurred here I will no longer be visiting this place, even the price doesn't make it worth it any longer."}
{"text":"3.5 stars I go to this AYCE sushi all the time whenever I crave sushi and dont want to go downtown because this location is so close to my home. It's a good sushi place for take outs and sit in. The severs here are all very friendly and fast.  I like how they have the iPad to order; but sometime when it's busy they don't have enough iPads and give you a sheet of paper of the menu to fill out what you want.  Overall it's a decent AYCE sushi but I feel that the cut of fish isn't fresh and sometime inconsistent with how thick/thin the cut of fish on the sushi. I would still recommend this AYCE sushi if your in the area.   My fave items on the menu is: Crispy Rolls (tempura flakes) Alaska Roll (deep fried sushi;crab meet, avocado) Grilled salmon  Chicken teriyaki Rolls Fried Rice Spring Rolls  Dinner $ Monday-Thursday $23.99 Friday-Sunday $25.99"}
{"text":"- Good selection.  - Decent price and surprisingly good service.  - The decor and seating is pretty cool too - They have these cool group tables.  Typical selection for an uptown AYCE place but they did have salmon tataki and white tuna (fish) tataki sashimi for dinner. The quality of the food was on par to ah la carte maybe cause they offered ah la carte.   Also often there are a couple of left over pieces at the end from ordering a bit too much which we struggled to down but servers were nice enough to just offer to take it away and let us order dessert. Think this was pretty cool."}
{"text":"OK AYCE. Only really come here because it's close to my house. If I had options to go other places in the city I would."}
{"text":"Very bad experience they said closed at 11 on Friday and when we get there they said the kitchen close at 10 that is really bad, I was there at 9:50 they ruining my night"}
{"text":"This place is close by to where I live and I'm so grateful it's there. Always a nice place to go for dinner and stop by before or after a movie. Their menu has a huge variety and selection, at less than $25 for dinner.   The staff are always very friendly and nice. They are always looking to make sure we're comfortable and attend to our needs. The ambience of the place is very modern and chic. They also seat large groups and take reservations, and they've got a take out menu as well.   Their food is pretty good for an AYCE sushi restaurant. I love their maki rolls and their teriyaki meat is great too. I usually go with a group of 5-10. We order a lot of things and try it all out. A great place to go for any sushi lovers. We even went there this christmas."}
{"text":"My family enjoys coming here the food is good would recommend to another to come in & try it. Personally I think it's over priced you be the judge."}
{"text":"Ive been here like three times within the past year. The service experienced here is horrible, and the food is not that great."}
{"text":"wasn't a big fan of the selection. it's a place i would recommend someone who is just getting into sushi to go to if they really need to be eased into it. the food wasn't bad, there just wasnt enough of the stuff i prefer to order."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times now and every time was the same thing. Okay sushi, not great, and really poor service. In particular, there is one guy, he was rude and just provided bad service. We left him with a reasonable tip afterwards, even though we shouldn't have, considering the god awful service that we received. Next time, I'll just stick to my regular sushi place 'Akita Sushi' on hwy 7. Went to the other side of the city for okay food and poor service. Ugh."}
{"text":"Went in for a late lunch with a friend. Was not impressed with the quality of food, and the service was slightly below adequate. To be fair, it's AYCE sushi, you generally don't come to be wowed by the menu or the service.  Food arrived promptly after ordering (they've upgraded to the popular 'order via tablet' option), and it was... not terrible? Bland, really. Mostly inoffensive. The sushi/maki/sashimi is notably better than the majority of the other kitchen items.  Total price for two people with tip and without drinks came to $75. Not a fan of the price point, but I can't exactly eat my money's worth at AYCE, so that one's on me.   If you're looking for quantity over quality, you could do worse."}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi I've had in a long time. Large portions for an all you can eat lunch.   The servers were fast and very polite even through a busy lunch rush.   Will definitely be coming back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"My goto place for sushi cravings. Their iPad ordering system is super convenient with photos and I come here mainly for the spicy salmon, enoki beef roll, wonton, kalbi beef, and mango pudding. Located in the same plaza as Cineplex and has tons of free parking"}
{"text":"I went to this place on a Saturday night and didn't have to wait too long for a table. It is your average uptown AYCE Japanese buffet. Fairly decent, clean, and surprisingly good service.   The sashimi was average quality; several choices for tepanyaki (which was nice); had a decent selection for maki rolls (nothing special); ramen was disappointing because the noodles were actually the instant noodle-type; and a short dessert list (ended up with green tea ice cream... surprise, surprise!)  OVERALL: this was a decent uptown AYCE, which has fairly nice decor on the inside, considering the exterior still looks like a Casey's that it took over. Good for groups. The food is average, nothing to write home about, and nothing that sticks out. But I would consider coming back for large group gatherings because they are fairly accomodating with good service."}
{"text":"One of my favourite AYCE spots in the city albeit somewhat pricey. I've been a few times for both their lunch and dinner menus and left with a full belly each time. The location is great. Close to the highway, lots of shopping and movies. The inside of the restaurant is beautifully decorated and the seating is comfortable and intimate. The service is mediocre, they could definitely be a little more friendly and attentive. They have a great menu that will cater to most people, even those who claim they don't eat 'sushi'. The iPad ordering is a nice touch too."}
{"text":"This used to be my #1 favourite AYCE sushi spot in Scarborough, but I think it might have changed during my past few visits.   The service was pretty good, we got seated quickly and the servers were attentive. They refilled our glasses with water whenever it was even halfway empty and were around if we needed them. Basically, the service was fast and the servers were friendly.  They have iPad ordering now, which is pretty cool. They have plenty of options to choose from for the lunch special. I've been here for both lunch and dinner, and I feel like the lunch special is much more worth it even though it has fewer items compared to the dinner special. When it comes to food, it's not horrible but it's not amazing! I've tried many items on the menu, however I would only get certain items if I were to return.  Some of my favourites would include the: - Chicken fried rice - Yam tempura - Shrimp tempura - Spicy salmon hand roll  - California hand roll - Siu mai - Spicy sour soup"}
{"text":"Food is decent. Like the tataki.  I do like the staff they are very friendly and quick. I would go back again for an AYCE fix"}
{"text":"I haven't been here in over 3 years because my first experience with the food wasn't so great, HOWEVER i recently went back and I have to say the food tasted great. I ordered almost each item from the menu to taste and pleasantly surprised how good it was. Sushi tasted fresh, great improvement. And the price for AYCE in Scarborough is great as it's hard to find AYCE, you also get alot of options at this spot esp if you are going with family/ kids or large groups of people."}
{"text":"A square box located opposite the Cineplex Odeon and across from an East-Side Mario's it featured double glass doors that opened into an interior that would be welcoming on a cold winter night. It was decorated in hushed chocolate tones with a hint of deep eggplant purple that only became clearer as it became darker outside. There are a selection of booths and tables seated in front of a bar that runs the width of the back of the place where all the magic happens. The menu is a large sheet of paper that features all of the items available for dinner sorted by how they are made. The food arrived beautifully plated on simple white plates in portions that were well sized for an AYCE place. It is the perfect place for anyone seeking food on a warm winter night after shopping on a weekend or before going out to the cinema."}
{"text":"They have an item on their menu called white fish, when I asked their waiter what kind of fish it was he said butter fish. I then said that's your white tuna, then he replied snapper. When this so called white fish came, it had a pink hue. The sane pink hues basa which is Asian cat fish. Be warned of this place that serves you raw catfish."}
{"text":"Fav sushi place! I've tried a few places in toronto and waterloo, this is by far the best one I've gone to.  Their sushi/maki platters are always so neat and visually appealing.   Pros: - decent price for lunch - Great selection - Their red bean ice cream is amazzzing! - cool, modern atmosphere - Friendly staff who know english  Con: - staff tend to forget little things: water, a few orders - shrimp tempura always takes the longest, every single time."}
{"text":"Frankly, I come here because one of the servers is a friend. I have been to AYCE Sushi restaurants that I like better; however, Tatami is a good basic AYCE restaurant. The sushi is fine, if not very adventurous. The kitchen items could be better; although there is a beef with garlic dish that I love. I find the service at Tatami to be excellent."}
{"text":"This is the spot to go if you want to have delicious all you can eat sushi! Their other menu options are delicious as well. The price is regular for an all you can eat. It's usually really crowded during dinner so make reservations. I go there all the time it's great. Service isn't amazing but still worth it because of the food!"}
