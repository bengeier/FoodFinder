{"text":"Had a great experience.  Service was fabulous, food presentation was phenomenal, delicious authentic Japanese food. I would recommend this over sushi rock any day. Meals are appropriately priced and the music and environment is wonderful. I loved it!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I arrived there at 5pm, the exact open time so there were not so many people there. The atmosphere created by the decorations and music ( I think it is traditional Japanese rhyme 'sakura') and the smile of staff was wonderful. The serving speed was fast. I love the salmon sashimi and eel sushi. The salad dressing is a little over sour for me, but generally I like this restaurant. Can't believe I never been there before."}
{"text":"Very average and small servings of sushi. Not well rolled and fell apart easily-didn't use much seaweed. Fish did not seem fresh and nigiri was tiny for price. Good service."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service. We used to order out from there every time, but we stopped when they could not get our order out in time - every time. They would say our order would be ready in 25 minutes, then EVERY time my husband would be waiting for another 20 minutes for our order. I called and complained about this twice and they did nothing.  Their response was well, your husband only waited another 10 minutes. Um no. The food is good, but not great. Not worth the wait. Especially when they do not value their customers."}
{"text":"The best japanese restuarant so far! Taste is great, reasonable amount and price. Sushi is fresh. Service is good too."}
{"text":"Very yummy ramen. We liked the sushi, too. Everything tastes very fresh and we had good service."}
{"text":"Horrible experience with the service.  There are basically 1 server and most of the time you couldnt even see her.  We had to wait for 44 min for a three person food to come...  on top of that, they actually charge you extra for a side of katsu sauce even when the food we ordered has katsu in it because \"we didn't order a katsu dish\"... honestly the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard in any Japanese restaurants.  The only plus side is that their curry was good, sushi is just ok.   Really regret coming here..."}
{"text":"We tried some rolls, tempura, and ramen. I'm a huge ramen fan (not the cup-o-soup kind of ramen) and this was NOT real ramen, which requires a slow-cooked pork broth as the soup base. This ramen's soup base was thin, almost like they opened a can of beef broth and added some soy sauce. Also, there was no soft-boiled egg in the ramen, which is usually pretty standard. Rolls were fine, tempura was generously portioned. Service was good, but for the price I would not go back."}
{"text":"This place was terrible. Walk in it was dim. Took the server a bit to get to us. The table was clean but sticky. They don't serve any alcohol and they don't have a beverage menu. We should've walked out at that moment but still decided to give it a try. The sushi was salty as all hell. It's like it was all rolled in salt. The ramen was bland. And the teriyaki chicken was not what expected.  I'm surprised this place is even still. There is no way I'll be returning for a second try."}
{"text":"My knowledge of Japanese cuisine does not extend far past northeast Ohio, but in that context Shinano delivers. I visited on a Monday evening, before the dinner crowd began to show up. The place is cute, quaint is another word. Clean, authentic, and a very friendly staff. It seems to be Japanese-owned and operated which makes me feel good because it guarantees at least some basis in authenticity and indulges the anim√© fantasy I think we're all pursuing at these restaurants.   Hot green tea to drink. Very good, perfect temperature. My girlfriend and I ordered some unagi nabayaki to start. We were presented with a small, sophisticated-sized portion that fulfilled all of my eel fantasies. A perfect barbecue-esque taste with a wonderful consistency.   We both ordered ramen. They use a miso broth. The portions were very large for such a cheap price, and presented in a sexually gratifying manner (meaning it looked really good and they even have the cute naruto with the little pink swirl that I secretly hope for with all ramen but don't complain as to keep a composure of a member of the culinary elite).   The noodles were great in texture. The pork was cooked to match the miso so perfectly. I drank all of the broth and I still feel very confident about that decision. As a whole, the dish didn't blow my tastebuds out of control but it was a solid meal.  Great lil place in Solon for some kickass noodles."}
{"text":"The people who work here are always so nice, the food is amazing, they have authentic ramen. Not much else to say."}
{"text":"How likely you will find a sushi restaurant in Cleveland has real Japanese ppl?! This is the one!   I really enjoyed all my meals here ^^ recommend all the sushi~ and like the ramen too!"}
{"text":"Best Japanese food in Cleveland. Very authentic. Yakatori chicken, ginger dressing , sushi, Raman are all amazing! Service is exceptional."}
{"text":"Place is delicious and everyone is so nice! Every time we order everyone is so polite and the sushi is really fresh! Def our go to in Solon!"}
{"text":"Mixed feelings about this place.   I was craving sushi and a bottle of Asahi so I thought I give this place a try. No ABC license for alcohol.    My sushi were good but my friends teriyaki chicken looked vey plain. I like that they serve the fried calamari tentacles instead of the battered rings.  Overall, not bad."}
{"text":"I'd give this 0 stars if I could. The rudest woman up front, who happens to be the manager. It's shocking how inappropriate and nasty she is. We ordered take out (Believe me, you do not want to eat IN! It is as bright as can be and you feel like you're in a cafeteria.). We craved sushi and it's the closest place. My son was going to try a beef dish and was asking for the difference between their two dishes. This woman became so intolerant and rude and was actually yelling at my son because he first asked about the sauces and then the difference in the cuts of beef. I was horrified by the way she shouted at him. She got nastier and more rude by every follow up question he had. Then she went on some rant about how we never tip. On takeout!  I'm so curious, should I be tipping on takeout? I am a great tipper.  I've waited tables in my younger years so I am very sensitive to that and tip very well. But I'm supposed to be tipping on takeout? I was so surprised to hear that so I googled it. Google agrees, you don't tip on takeout unless it is, for some reason, so exceptional. But being handed a bag? And to yell that we don't tip? How tacky! I cannot even believe this place is in business still."}
{"text":"This place is close to my shop so the wife and I checked it out. She had the sashimi lunch and really enjoyed it. It came with miso soup and 5kinds of fish. I had an Alaska roll that was good and ramen that way giant and excellent. Everything was under $40 which I'm ok with. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Highly recommend their Unaju (eel) special and Dengaku fried tofu with house sesame sauce. Nice ambience and you can BYOB. Family-owned restaurant...they were super friend and great service!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty surprised that this place has gotten such good reviews, and chose to try it out based on its outstanding ratings on Yelp.  On the plus side, service was excellent -- our waitress was very friendly.  On the negative side, the food was mediocre at best, genuinely dissatisfying at worst. I got a crunchy tuna roll, but the tempura flakes were soft and mushy, as if the sushi had been sitting around for a while and the tempura had moistened. It was not a pleasant texture for a roll advertised as \"crunchy.\" A yellowtail roll also disappointed, and tasted radically different than the yellowtail nigiri my girlfriend received, leading me to suspect that the rolls were not made from the same cut of fish. This reinforced my perception that this roll may well have been pre-made. My third roll, a daily special, was better, but 1 out of 3 is not good for a sushi restaurant.  This is not a cheap place, either, which compounded our disappointment. Dinner for 2 was around $45."}
{"text":"The seafood is great, sushi is also good. Didn't know its BYOB, so don't forget to bring some booze!"}
{"text":"One of the very best in Cleveland, bar none.   Used to be nearer to me, but moved into new digs in Solon.  Always worth the extra 10 miles.  Sushi Chef (owner) is very good, but lately his nigiri rolls have gotten smaller.  For a tall man, he has small hands.  His handrolls are smaller than average too, but just as flavorful as can be.  I love this place..."}
{"text":"We we're greeted at the door by multiple people and promptly seated. We each got an order of nigiri, my wife got the tuna and I decided to go with the king crab. They arrived quickly and were cleanly assembled and presented. We both agreed it was some of the best nigiri either of us have had.   We both ordered the ramen for our main dish. I wouldn't say it was the best ramen I've ever had, but it was still delicious and I would recommend on your first visit. The pork broth was very salty (as it should be) but not over powering. I did wish that I had some spicy chili flakes to add to it. Overall, we both really enjoyed our visit to Shinano. The wait staff was very friendly and the unlimited, free green tea was a nice touch."}
{"text":"So I was in the area for work from the west coast and I was looking for something asian. I came across this place and walked in with low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised when the chef behind the counter was speaking Japanese. You are probably saying of course he speaks Japanese it's a Japanese restaurant.   More and more you will find that Japanese restaurants are actually run by Koreans or Chinese which is fine.   I ordered the bento, which came with tempura, sashimi, grilled salmon, appetizer salad, miso soup and rice. Over all everything was great and service was very attentive.  Surprisingly great experience overall.  Would recommend to anyone looking for Japanese in he Solon area."}
{"text":"\"itadakimasu\"    Loved how fresh their fish was!  For dinner, we ordered Chirashi Zushi (that came with miso soup and salad), their special - Japanese curry rice (that came with a salad), and a ginger squid appetizer, which were all very delicious.  I was particularly happy that the salad contained fresh spinach and romaine lettuce - which I think goes to show you the care and quality of a Japanese restaurant.  The presentation was spectacular and service was very warm - with that authentic, Japanese hospitality that I love so much.  And to top it off, the food was very good and amazingly fresh for sashimi in suburbia Ohio!  \"oishii!\""}
{"text":"Sushi is pretty good. Service and attention is amazing. Support local...perfect place for lunch!"}
{"text":"Such a great atmosphere at shinano! I went here for the first time with my boyfriend. I had the fried calamari which was amazing!! The calamari was still warm and crunchy. They gave us these really nice warm towels to wipe our hands and the palette cleanser. Our waitress was amazing. She was super friendly and made us feel really acquainted with the menu. I love this place!! Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Amazing place with great service and fresh quality sushi. Easily one of the most authentic Japanese cuisine places I've been in northeast Ohio, I plan to return many of times in the future."}
{"text":"I come here often for lunch. The food is very good and fast. It's a family owned and operated restaurant, by real Japanese family. Is very casual and clean. You will spend probable close to $20 per person. My favorite dish is the Bento Box, a little of everything concept! You should try it too!"}
{"text":"YUM!!!! This place was soooo good! We are from Hawaii, so we are accustomed to (and spoiled with) delicious, fresh fish from the pacific. I was apprehensive to try this sushi spot because our last experience with east coast sushi was just aiiiiiight. I was worried I wouldn't get my sushi fix until I went back home. However, this place did not disappoint!  We ordered sashimi (salmon, tako, ahi, saba, and another white fish). The sashimi cuts beautifully buttery and oily (fish quality, not actual butter and oil! Lol) it came with Miso soup and your choice of white rice, brown rice, or fried rice. We also ordered a few sushi rolls and they were excellent.   Aside from food, the server, Jen, was so personable. She chatted with us and was so accommodating. She asked if we wanted to do any switches with fish in the sushi roll to let us know, like if we wanted salmon vs smoked salmon (which we did!) our waters and tea were always filled, and she even checked to ask if we wanted refills on our rice, with an option to try a different type of rice even if we wanted.   Price point was awesome - their specialty rolls were anywhere from $6-9! The sashimi (with rice and miso soup) was $15. Again, very reasonable for what you are getting.  Great experience, would recommend and go again if I found myself in the area!"}
{"text":"Not that great as far as sushi goes. The fish just didn't seem very fresh and was pretty bland......the one piece of salmon had a big fatty part to it that I felt should have been trimmed off and the cuts of fish were pretty uneven.   I am probably being nitpicky here since the prices are VERY reasonable so I guess you get what you pay for.  Also, be prepared that they do not serve alcohol."}
{"text":"Awesome. The food was great, really fresh and tasty. We had sushi rolls, salad, rice, and the chicken sukiyaki and enjoyed it all. The waitress and the other workers were very warm and friendly. Also we were able to bring our own wine! We came here friday night and there were only two or three other parties so the service was quick and it was a nice atmosphere. The bill came up to 50 dollars for two including a sushi roll to go. We were  thoroughly satisfied and took home leftover sukiyaki. Definitely will be back :)  Other great things: -The waitress gave us a warm towelette before our meal. Really Awesome considering it was cold outside.  -We were given green tea at the end of our meal.  -They had some really cool serving dishes and cups."}
{"text":"Blah and yuk.  Staff is really nice and attentive but the food just sucks.  My meal consisted of everything from being not fresh to undercooked.  Quality is just terrible."}
{"text":"Pricey, but just may be some of the best sushi in Cleveland!  Also, for those of you who may not love sushi, definitely try the ume-shiso vegetarian sushi. The location, however has changed - they are now in Solon, in the strip mall next to Miles Market."}
{"text":"Visited on Saturday, right after 5PM opening.  As I did a few years ago, I sat at the sushi counter and asked master for 'omakase' for $50.  He gladly accepted my request.    Omakase consisted of; nigiri sushi of master's choice and they are; salmon, hamachi, ikura, uni, red snapper, cucumber roll, unagi and my request of ika (squid).  In addition, omakase came with a tempura appetizer, crab meat assortment, and grilled mackerel with salty flavor.  I wanted to end the meal with ramen and this time I ordered miso ramen.  It was excellent.  The bill did not say ramen so I asked.  The master said he put ramen as a part of omakase.  What a treat!!    I ordered Katsudon to go since I drive a distance to go home.  Later after I came back home, I ate Katsudon as a night snack.  It was excellent.   As a native Japanese, I fully enjoyed Shinano, because it is one of few authentic Japanese cuisine in the area.  I am not against Japanese restaurants owned by non-native but my experiences show the Japanese owned is always the best.      Japanese cuisine can be found everywhere these days but there are few true authentic ones as far as I know.  If you adore a real (I mean a real) Japanese taste, try Shinano.  You will be happy to visit and leave with a smile on your face."}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner with a collegue.  I ordered the sashimi deluxe which came with soup, salad and rice.  The soup was good and flavorful and the salad was larger than the average sushi restaurant offering.  I asked for uni with my meal and they were out. I also asked for saba instead of octopus and the ended up giving me more salmon instead which I had to go to the counter to exchange. Quality was not a major issue but the tuna tasted pre-frozen.   Service was alright but could have been better."}
{"text":"Great place for some Japanese comfort food. The restaurant is clean and quite. Service is very good. The fish jaw we had was amazing. Make sure to ask for their Japanese menu since there might be more authentic dishes."}
{"text":"Went to Shinano for a casual dinner on a Saturday night with a few friends. I must admit that although I am a fan of Japanese food, my experiences have been quite limited. I ordered the cucumber/avocado roll and the sweet potato tempura roll, both of which were fairly tasty, although I felt that the meal overall lacked anything exceptional. I would say that this place is good if you want a very laid back, quiet atmosphere and are looking to get some great deals on sushi, as the rolls here are mostly inexpensive. The service was great; our waitress was exceptionally friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"Just had dinner here, one of the only legit Japanese restaurants in Cleveland.  Very reasonable w generous portions. I had the shrimp tempura dinner - it came with heaps of veggies and four pieces of shrimp, salad, miso soup, and rice. All this for $15. My sister had ramen and told me that it was awesome.  Service was great. Our server told us all the ins and outs of Cleveland.  Heaps of parking on site as it's in a plaza.  My sister just moved here so I'll be coming back here often. A four star here!"}
{"text":"Three stars is perfect for Shinano - everything was okay to good, but nothing was really exceptional to me.  I took my mom here for her birthday and the staff was really friendly, definitely going out of their way to wish her a happy birthday. The service was really good.   We ordered a bottle of wine and soup and sushi, and everything ranged from average to good. We got the \"Chad's Roll\" which was my favorite part of the meal, and a few other sushi rolls as well. I would certainly eat here again, but it probably won't be my first choice."}
{"text":"You know it's legit when they have a Japanese menu available!  Unfortunately the restaurant doesn't serve fresh sushi-grade salmon (my favorite), but I guess it can't be helped when you're further out in the Midwest. I did try some of their other maki rolls and thought they tasted pretty good.  Next time I think I'll try their actual dinner entree menu. I took a bite of my friend's chicken cutlet and it tasted super authentic - crispy, well fried, and not at all oily. Yum!"}
{"text":"I've ordered delivery from a local service called DeliverMeFood.com, I've also ordered takeout and I've ate inside on different occasions.  The food is great and I'd reccomend the Volcano!"}
{"text":"Hands down the BEST JAPANESE FOOD in CLEVELAND!    Before I go on, I'll sum up WHY right now: quality & freshness of ingredients, expert & accurate preparation, and friendly interactive service with a smile.  Oh, and if you want that lame and overdone, overhyped \"Asian Fusion\" stuff, go elsewhere!  Shinano is best for patrons who appreciate and enjoy TRADITIONAL Japanese cuisine.  So, I'm gonna kick myself for not writing a review long ago - but I had so much to say about this place that I kept putting it off and putting it off until I decided: just do it.  So please forgive this wordy stream of consciousness!  Shinano doesn't do the steakhouse or hibachi (yakiniku) thing but is a good, solid, family-friendly Japanese eatery wet in a somewhat residential part of town.  Family-own and run, Shinano has just about everything you'd expect on a traditional Japanese menu - sushi, sashimi, tempura, bento, donburi, sukiyaki, etc.  Eat at the suhi bar or opt for waiter service at the tables.  The sushi is fresh and wonderful.  The tempura is light, airy and crispy.  Everything in between is full of flavor - so much so I'm mouth-watering just writing about it.  Specials include raw oysters on the half-shell, soft shell crabs, and my favorite: unaju (broiled eel in teriyaki sauce).  Not inexpensive but certainly not overpriced.  Shinano is nowhere near exorbitant like an \"Asian Fusion\" sushi restaurant nearby (which shall remain nameless) and yet the freshness and quality brought to the table is far better.  Sushi runs $4 - $5/plate (2 pieces nigiri or 6 pieces maki) while some of the fancier rolls range upward from $6 - $8/wrap.  Most bento dinners run $15 - $20, full sushi dinners range $20 - $26.  Dinners start off with sprouts with sesame oil, miso soup, and salad with Shinano's delicious signature dressing.  Alcohol options includes several brands of sake, plum wine, and Japanese beer.  Dessert options include mochi, mochi ice cream, and even some old school Japanese candies great for the kids (tomoeame, pocky, melon gum, etc.)  Call-ahead take-out service and delivery service (via an outside food-fetching vendor) are both available.  I have been patronizing Shinano for seven years, ever since I arrived in Cleveland.  Up until 2008, Shinano was originally in Richmond Heights in a strip mall across from JC Penney's.  Shinano relocated to a fresh, new location in north Solon on Miles Road (easily accessible from 271), right next door to Miles Farmer's Market.  And although Shinano was closed for new construction for about a year, most of the original wait staff followed to the new location.  That should say something about the restaurant!  Having spent three decades living and travelling in areas of heavy Japanese populations throughout Pacific Rim states and countries, I have been utterly disappointed in many of the restaurants that call themselves \"Japanese\" here in Cleveland.  Shinano is the only Japanese restaurant I consider authentic, quality, and delicious enough that my sushi-loving friends & I visit at least once or twice a month!"}
{"text":"I have been a customer at this restaurant for many years. Sushi is always fresh and it has excellent authentic Japanese cruisine. They have the best Sushi in Cuyahoga County! The staff is friendly and I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"My first experience with sushi was at Shinano when they were at their location on Wilson Mills Blvd by Richmond Mall. I still find time to head to Shinano when in the area. Service has always been great and relaxed, with the servers eager to please. Some of the appetizers are out of this world. The seared tuna is tremendous. The sashimi and sushi rolls are always top notch. Here in Cleveland, there is no shortage of great sushi bars in the city."}
{"text":"So this place was great but not awesome.  The staff was friendly and the chefs were awesome.  The food was great but not amazing.  I had a few rolls that were really good but don't remember the exact ones unfortunately.  Definitely try it if you are in the Solon area."}
{"text":"This restaurant is locally owned and run by a Japanese family. Mostly homemade cooking (ginger dressing and sushi rice) and fresh (not everything considering we're in Ohio but most). But great quality and authenticity. Not only is there great sushi, but there's other food for all eaters!   The new location is beautiful and even has a bar and patio seating. There is even a 42' tv in the bar, and a large selection of imported and domestic beers!   Same friendly staff and great sushi chefs, that you can watch from the sushi bar."}
{"text":"Wow, so disappointed. Had the sashimi lunch, complete waste of 14 dollars, had about 3 ounces of fish at most. Including average frozen block tuna, decent hirami, escolar and a octopus.  Spicy tuna roll was tiny as well. They used a pepper salt instead of sauce. I'm not sure why but the tuna was not fresh caught in lake Erie.  Overall a poor value for very average fish.  Not worth returning."}
{"text":"Tastes like Japan.  These were the first three words out of my mouth after the first bite. Not that I've 'eaten' Japan before, but I was born there, and it wasn't until now that I've been to a sushi bar that has taken me back to my childhood.   I certainly had my doubts reading the few reviews regarding the authenticity, but those were out the window as early as the appetizers. The miso soup was delicious--rich, but not overly salty like most restaurants. The salad was fresh, and the ginger dressing might be one of the best I've ever had.  For the main course, I went with the ikura (salmon roe) nigiri, the Volcano roll, and a half order of the Futomaki roll. Can you say heaven? The Futomaki might be one of the best rolls I've tasted, and I immediately regretted not getting the full order. This would be the first thing I recommend, as it would turn anyone into a believer. The ikura nigiri is authentic as it gets, and it didn't disappoint, though large fish eggs might not be everyone's cup of tea. The Volcano roll was delicious as well, albeit a bit on the small side for a specialty roll. My girlfriend got the tempura dinner which was phenomenal as well. The tempura batter was perfection.  You can tell the chef puts a ton of work into each dish. The flavors are just so complex and satisfying. I still have a place in my heart for other sushi restaurants in Cleveland, but Shinano is authentic, traditional cuisine and hits a spot on my palate that no other can touch. There's so much more I want to try. It just sucks that I only found the place now that I'm moving to the west side, but that won't get in the way of me and some damn good Japanese food."}
{"text":"I've been to a lot of authentic Japanese restaurants all over the country, some of the best in New York and San Francisco. This rates at or near the top, no doubt. The sushi was superb. The ramen was incredible. No hibachi, no big deal; Japanese cuisine is more than that. Stop in and try the real deal, close to home. Plus, it's Bring Your Own Alcoholic Beverage! How can you beat that?! You can't!!! 5/5!"}
{"text":"I tried this place and you know, I just wasn't super impressed as I hoped I would be.  Don't get me wrong, the service was adequate, atmosphere nice and quiet, and authenticity seemed on point but the FOOODDDD.  We first ordered the scallop and shrimp salad...very lack luster.  Very small scallops and shrimps that just made the salad a hassle to eat.  Starting the meal with that seemed to just make this restaurant go from a 4 to 3.5 rounding down. Soup was typical Japanese miso, salad that came with our sashimi meal was as expected.  The Sashimi gourmet was well worth the price though and this restaurants redeeming quality.  3 pieces of several different types of fish and seafood each was this restaurants redeeming quality for 20-30 bucks.  The price for sashimi was quite affordable but the entire meal was just A-ok.  I'm hoping the next time I go, I'll be blown away!"}
{"text":"I cannot describe with words how fantastic this restaurant is. But I'll try.   When I go to a Japanese restaurant/sushi bar, I have high expectations. I expect the quality of inbreeding to be very high, I expect the food to be prepared/cooked properly, I expect the staff to be friendly and accommodating, I expect the food to taste GOOD and the atmosphere to be inviting and comfortable.  This place far exceeds my expectations. Atop all of that, the food is priced just right!  Anyone seeking sushi for either the first time, looking for a repeat of an authentic experience, or looking for high quality food and service, you need to go here. This is my favorite restaurant. Period. Through my travels across the United States and to Asia, I have had my fair share of sushi and Japanese cuisine, and Shinano is up there with all the top-shelf restaurants. Superb-quality!"}
{"text":"One of the simplest, best meals I've had in a while.  My car was getting fixed so my mom and I used the Yelp app to see what places were in the area.  We were lucky to choose this place.  We were and given a little background about the place from the friendly server.  Turns out the restaurant has been around for almost 20 years.  At it's current location for about 2 years.   We had the sashimi platter that came with miso soup.  For 14 dollars it's a great deal.  The miso soup was good, a tiny bit salty, but still good.  The platter actually contained more than the amount listed on the menu, a nice touch. It had octopus, mackerel, white fish, tuna and one that I forget.  Served with a couple pieces of lemon, all you needed to do was squeeze some lemon on each slice and it was perfect.  Very flavorful.  It was the first sushi place in Cleveland where I didn't want to add or dip it in anything and just experience the fish flavor.  I cannot wait to go back."}
{"text":"In the distinction between Japanese restaurants and pseudo-Japanase restaurants Shinano falls down in the first category. As main disadvantage, it really is in the middle of nowhere, no one can argue about that, but you won't regret the trip over there cause this place has value written all over it. Typical delicious Japanese food, wonderful service, heaven-tasting sashimi, one of the best green teas I had in the Cleveland area, it's an absolute must! (and the price is really really cheap when compared with some of the high-end disappointing places I've been to for Japanese food in Cleveland)"}
{"text":"In an effort to avoid some busy areas during the RNC, I've been spending more time in the suburbs.   Shinano probably has some of the more authentic, inventive sushi I've had on the east side. I loved the Chad's Roll and the Rock-n-Roll roll. Very fresh fish and creative combinations. On my next trip, I will return solely for the sushi! Otherwise, they have a huge menu and the portions are pretty generous. My guest and I had the Ramen and the Negamayaki. Both were just OK. The ramen broth didn't have much flavor, nor did the Negamayaki, despite having beautiful presentation.  A few other things:  + They have no liquor license; therefore there's no drink menu. Just soft drinks. + If you ask for sriracha: beware. They will charge you $1.25 for a little side (not even a bottle) to be brought to your table. I thought this was the weirdest thing ever. Doesn't everyone put sriracha on his or her noodles?  + No salt/pepper or any condiments on the table. + You have to ask specifically for utensils that aren't chopsticks.  Overall, I think Shinano's has some kinks to work out, but since I'm absolutely hooked on their sushi, I'll be back."}
{"text":"I used to frequent this place more when it was located in Richmond Mall, but since I was in the area, I recently visited Shinano Japanese Restaurant.  I was recommended this restaurant by my college Japanese professor. The chefs are Japanese, but interestingly, the head chef was trained in French cuisine. There are definitely subtle differences in the way the chef prepares Japanese food - most notably, the curry is a homemade Japanese curry that involves heavy use of onions with not as many carrots and potatoes (though carrots are on the side, they are not made with the curry itself).  I went last weekend and had the tonkotsu ramen.The broth was very good, as were the noodles. The char siu was ok, but overall the ramen was solid for what is available in the Cleveland area.  In the past I typically went for their katsu dishes, katsu curry and katsudon. Shinano has a special place in my heart, as it was the first place I ever had katsudon and oyakodon. Both are made fairly well here, and during my college and med school days I would get katsudon here before any major exam.  After 10+ years of me being a customer there, Shinano continues to be a winner in my heart."}
{"text":"I like that this place offers bento boxes!  These are combination lunch/dinner boxes where you can mix and match small portions of your chicken/salmon/beef teriyaki, your tempura and your sashimi in a single meal.  In any other city there would be lots of restaurants that offer these boxes... Cleveland doesn't really have any.  I had a bento box with salmon teriyaki, tempura and sashimi.  My girlfriend had a fish teriyaki.  The fish was tilapia which.. didn't go too well with the teriyaki sauce and tasted kind of off.  But the salmon was good.  The tempura was pretty typical, I'd say.  I was also admittedly kind of disappointed by the sashimi because of the selection that they gave us (tuna, tilapia, octopus instead your typical salmon).  However, the fish was fairly fresh, and we also ordered a special \"rock n roll\" roll which I thought had a good amount of fish in it.  The service, as others have mentioned, is pretty good.  The waitresses are very nice and attentive, and they care to ask about the little details such as whether you prefer low sodium soy sauce or regular soy sauce.  If I find myself mulling around Solon I just might stop back in here again."}
{"text":"This is an unassuming, family-run business that serves what may be the best sushi (or best value at least, since I haven't tried Ginko) in Cleveland. Other than the more expensive stuff like o-toro and uni, the nigiri generally runs about $4-5 for two pieces (or a 6 piece roll), and it is definitely authentic and fresh. The saba stands out as particularly tasty, and I order it every time I go here, but the anago, unagi, maguro, sake, and hamachi are all great as well. The sushi is not cheap, but well worth it.  I like to sit at the bar and watch the chefs prepare the sushi. Service here is always great. For some reason not a lot of people come here, so you get a lot of attention, and they are always friendly and welcoming.  Parking is absurdly easy here. Sometimes I wish I lived closer so I could go more often, but that would be too damaging to my wallet."}
{"text":"Authentically Japanese with flavorful items like a well made chirashi sushi, excellent futomaki roll, soft shell crab, fried chicken wings, salmon skin rolls, homemade gyoza, and homemade ramen. On inquiry, there are a lot of off menu items for their Japanese clientele. Service is hit or miss"}
{"text":"Bento? Check. Legit sushi? Check. Ramen? Check.  My lunch bento box was delicious. Tempura shrimp was prepared perfectly with light and crispy batter. Teriyaki chicken was tender and subtle in seasoning. The sides of seaweed, pickled daikon and orange slices were a nice treat that complimented the chicken and tempura. Nothing over salted, everything balanced. Overall the bento box covers a wide spectrum of flavors that will please people who like variety.  The sushi I had here was excellent. I was very pleased with my spicy tuna and ebi sushi. Prepared with care and attention. I need to come back and try some more. The ramen was tasty with tender pork, firm noodles and smooth broth. There are very few places in the area that serve legit ramen. Try it out.  The presentation of the food was top tier and the service was wonderful. I loved the courtesy. The staff thanked us as we were leaving and we thanked them. No alcohol served here. I just wish I could get to order sake or Sapporo with my meal.  Until then, four stars."}
{"text":"We met a friend there for lunch.  The staff was overwhelmingly accommodating on this particular day (maybe they had read some of the earlier reviews).  They were helpful, patient, smiling, and friendly.  The lunch menu was comprehensive, properly sized, and affordable.  There were numerous choices of bento boxes, meals, sushi, and sashimi.  We all enjoyed a threesome of rolls, prepared by the sushi chef himself.   The service was a little slow, but we weren't in a rush.   The restaurant itself is in a strip mall, but very clean and bright. My favorite part is that they do not overcrowd the tables, so there's plenty of privacy. I will be going back."}
{"text":"I asked someone who is originally from Japan living here in Cleveland, where can I get good Japanese food here?  He recommended Shinano for the most authentic restaurant you can find in the Cleveland area.  We went here and found that the recommendation lived up to its expectations.  Along with the standard sushi, sashimi, and tempura you will find at any Japanese restaurant, they offer other items such as bento boxes, soba, and they even have natto.  I tried some of the appetizers- agedashi tofu and broiled eel.  Both were perfectly cooked and delicious.  I had the mackerel dinner for my entree.  The dinner came with miso, and salad with ginger vinaigrette. The mackerel was a good sized portion and the fish itself was perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, very juicy and tender.  Service was attentive and friendly.  I would definitely like to go here again to try more of their dishes."}
{"text":"Hand down the best Japanese restaurant in Cleveland area.  I give Shinano a 5 star.  We have to go there every other month for my wife to get her fix.  We have been going to Shinano more than fifteen years since they are in their old Wilson Mill address.  We are a little lost when they are in between move.  We are very glad that they finally re-open and find such nice location and a lot closer to our house.  Did you know when the Japanese MLB baseball player came in town for Indian games, the Indian bring them to Shinano and there is signed sushi plates display around the paid area.  The restaurant is own and ran by Japanese family. Most the waitress has been worked for them more than ten years.  A lot of regular like us follow them from Wilson Mill to Solon.  The waitress treated us like family.  The atmosphere is very warm and close. There is a large sushi bar area with two to three sushi chefs.  Their menu selections are large and complex.  They also have a Japanese menu with some special home cook dishes.     Their sushi is always fresh and patty of selections.  Please try their Tamogo (egg) and Giant Calm if they have them.  Their Japanese salad and Miso soup are excellent.  We always order their grill whole squid.  I think they are the only place around town serve this item.  Their tempura is best around town and their bento box dinner is a good value.  They also have the Japanese style Curry dishes (sweeter) and some Japanese grill fish in their Japanese worth a try.    Don't forget their dessert menu, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"Definitely the best ramen and Japanese food you can get in Cleveland. I got volcano roll and a ramen. The ramen is really amazing. They make their roast pork belly and I love the bamboo shoot. The volcano is awesome. Definitely hit the place!"}
{"text":"We had a wonderful dinner at Shinano.  The staff is super friendly and the food is wonderful.  Only wished we lived closer."}
{"text":"Enjoyed it but overall average.   For apps tried one of the seared tuna dishes-- wasn't fresh and tasted very fishy. Would not recommend.   The sushi was thankfully much better...we split the volcano roll which was pretty good, as well as the sushi and sashimi platter. The platter was nice bc of the variety, but was hit or miss on the sushi. The tuna sashimi was quite tasty (MUCH better than the app) as was the Saba sushi which was my first time trying it. The rest was average.   Next time I'd prolly just get a few rolls separately. I do wanna come back and try the ramen as the rest of the entree list looks pretty good.  Unfortunately they don't have a liquor license so no hot sake, but is BYOB.   Service was great, everyone was friendly and it seemed like a nice family owned business."}
{"text":"Love love this place. Authentic Japanese cuisine. I was sitting across from a table of Tibetan Monks.  That's gotta say something for it's authenticity.  I had Yellow Tail which was delicious and the Volcano Sushi and Spicy Scallops. Everything was beautifully presented, fresh and delicious!  Service was prompt and friendly.  Pricing was appropriate to the level of service and quality of food."}
{"text":"The manager Kathy is the rudest and most unaccommodating restaurant employee I've ever encountered.   I've eaten at this place for more than 10 years and never was treated so poorly.   Kathy turned us away when plenty of tables were open. We were also with a baby.   We won't come"}
{"text":"Sushi heaven. Finally. Some place around CLE that actually has good sushi (bleh for all the other places), and omg, why are there no other yelpers who have been here? It's GREAT for sushi! Plus, if you want free produce, it's right next to Miles Farmers Market.  I've been on the hunt for sushi. I agree with the past yelp review- this place is definitely authentic. We walked into the friendly restaurant and sat at the sushi bar.  Took one look at the menu and definitely knew it was authentic. The waitress asked us if we wanted normal sodium soy sauce or low sodium soy sauce. Hmm... nice to have the option.   We ordered the sashimi lunch option- 4 different types of sashimi+ rice+ soup for around 14 dollars. And wow, it was fresh. FRESH. It had the ika, maguro, saba, .and 2 others (they added a fifth one). But wow, that's some fresh fresh sashimi.  We also ordered the shinano maki- hamachi, unagi, crabmeat, masago, and japanese pickles. It was HUGE- but well packed, nicely presented, fresh, and just plain good. YUM.  If I need a sushi fix that's way better than any place in Cleveland and super authentic, I'm definitely going back to Shinano. YUM. YAY for FRESH sushi!"}
{"text":"Hostess :4.0 Waitress: 4.0 Food: taste, presentation: 4.5 Property-style, decor, ambiance: 2.0  The best in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I love this place. Great service. The sushi is great. The food is excellent to. I recommend this restaurant it is authentic Japanese."}
{"text":"I work down the road and wanted a nice light meal on this dark day. The service was great. I felt bad for the server because there were a few ladies asking any and every question there may be about the food because they were vegan. They were not asking in the most polite of manners and actually left without eating. They left in their Audi SUV. The girl was so sweet and apologetic. I sampled some sushi and did one of the lunch combos. I will definitely start coming here for lunch more often. I am not that mad about the Pacific East in Solon closing now. This is actually better. Thank you to Rachel and Dee for putting the idea in my mind to eat here!"}
{"text":"One of the worst sushi restaurant I have ever been. The sushi completely falls apart when we try to pick it up. The ingredient is unevenly distributed. Fish is not fresh. The only redeeming quality is the service. Had a good server."}
{"text":"Great sushi. Great service. Nice restaurant. You can bring your own wine since there is no liquor license."}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly and attentive. And the atmosphere was good too.  The food was pretty good. Just never had spicy tuna roll made with pepper flakes, so that was new. Its not the best sushi I've had, but I would return there to eat if I could."}
{"text":"This place was legit! My husband and I have had some really tasty and fresh sushi since we lived in California. When we came to live in ohio we had tried a few places and were either seriously disappointed or sick. I can honestly say this was the best we have found and we were not at all disappointed. For our rolls we decided on Spicy Tuna, Louisiana, California and Soft shell crab (I can't remember the name ). We also got Yakisoba, miso soup (delish) and the house salad(the dressing was on point)."}
