{"text":"Traveling on  US 74, checked on Yelp for a place for lunch that wasn't a chain. Jefferson Street Deli Deli came up, It's about 6 minute off US74.
Perfect choice. The food is delicious - from the sandwich and salad we ordered.  There are about 8 tables- tables seat 4 to 2 people. 
The staff is friendly. Reasonably price. Worth the 6minute drive."}
{"text":"Best deli shop in Monroe!! I love that it's family owned and operated. Their sandwiches and wraps are made with all fresh ingredients. Plus they have delicious desserts and pastry's. Dine in our take out."}
{"text":"This place has the best food in Monroe -- yes, a lunch joint has the best food.  Their food is truly handcrafted and just delicious.  I wish they were open longer each day.  Their \"3-Way Sandwich\" and \"Southern Lane\" sandwiches are my favorites.  The Garden Highway salad is a terrific value.  I can't get enough of this place!"}
