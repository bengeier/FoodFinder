{"text":"Took the family there yesterday for dinner as always the food was great and service was fine. I just wanted to thank the shift supervisor for giving us a discount because my daughter is a Palo Verde High School  student that was very nice. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"I LOVE SAMURAI SAMS! The service is amazing, the food is reasonably prices, & it's quick. They have great variety when it comes to their bowls. I order the spicy beef & broccoli bowl every time & I'll still have leftovers for the next day. I definitely recommend this spot of you like teriyaki grills."}
{"text":"They have yet to disappoint on service and food quality. Everything on the menu is excellent but the steak bowl is my go to item! Plus it's right down the street from my gym so makes a great post workout meal."}
{"text":"If you check my old reviews youll see that i am very generous with my stars, but this samurai sams just made me dis like em. First the service was rude abrupt and they all seem to have an attitude second the rice was not good and i am a rice lover so that right there was the most upsetting but the overall whole experience isnt anything to write home about"}
{"text":"Love that their food is simply simple 
Its very filling too..not pricey..just right
Wish they had a variety of drinks other than the normal fountain drinks"}
{"text":"Terrible service. Cook had to get someone to my take order.  Two women finally came out and then told me to wait while they take a phone call.  They can't get called in order get order to take in automated system so I keep waiting.  Finally I just gave up & left without ordering."}
{"text":"They have a special for a chicken and vegetable teriyaki bowl and a drink for 3.99 which is a steal.  I always ask for no carrots because I hate those little buggers, and they never have a problem accomodating my wishes.  I don't ever crave this place, but its an ok place to grab a quick bite to eat when you don't feel like cooking after a long day."}
{"text":"This was the worst Samurai Sam's Food I've ever had! While the service was fine and the wait wasn't bad, I got my food to go. I ordered two large Spicy Beef with broccoli teriyaki bowls and two grilled egg rolls. The food was nasty. The beef was dry tasting and burned! There was hardly any teriyaki sauce and mostly contained the broccoli and rice. I've eaten at other Samurai Sam's where I enjoyed my meal immensely and I was disappointed. Do not eat at this Samurai Sam's unless you like the taste of burned and charred cheap meat with no seasoning!"}
{"text":"The food here is always excellent and made to order.  I'm a picky eater and order my bowl with brown rice, extra spicy and with only some of the veggies that are normally included... they have never messed up my order and they even double up on my veggies.  The staff are always extremely friendly and genuinely seem to appreciate my business, even though there are many times I've arrived right at closing time.  By far the best tasting reasonably priced Japanese take out in the area."}
{"text":"You can't complain of you don't get the best.
However for $5.00 you get a bowl of chicken rice and vegetables.
I wish we could review others reviews. Some people just take themselves too serious."}
{"text":"I will never come to this restaurant again. First and last time. This food taste like it's microwaved. When I entered the store, I did not smell one sense of food. That should have been my first impression that it was not going to taste good. The noodles were disgusting. Enough said. Everything was horrible."}
{"text":"Well, I met the owner. He reached out immediately after my post and when I went in he was genuinely sorry for the lack of service. The food here is great, like I said I'm a regular here. I'm very big on hospitality no matter quality of food. Thanks again for rectifying this James"}
{"text":"Great place.  Clean, nice employees and the prices are perfect!"}
{"text":"Food did not taste good at all for the price, we were very dissapointed and won't be back."}
{"text":"Went to the Deer Valley Center store....the worst! I ordered the Teriyaki beef and it was like chewing gum. All gristle and leather! NEVER AGAIN!"}
{"text":"Our family absolutely loves going to Samurai Sam's! The staff is so wonderful and friendly and the food is AMAZING!!! Thanks for the great food and service!"}
{"text":"I am surprised by the reviews...I have zero complaints and this is one of my favorite quick stops for lunch. Loli and the crew are very personable & will always have my business."}
{"text":"My boss's current favorite. We eat here almost daily. Great tasting, affordable, healthy food. We both go for the brown rice. He prefers white meat, I prefer dark. We always load up on the chili sauce, chili powder, sesame seeds, etc.. 

Their reward card system (buy 10 get 1 free) is kind of cool. You leave it in a semi-alphabetized tray there, rather than having it clutter up your wallet.

I'm not a fan of the wraps. I tried them and they're too sickly sweet for me. Otherwise, great food."}
{"text":"Always delicious... I usually go about once a week for the teriyaki chicken yakisoba noodle bowl"}
{"text":"The yakisoba here is horrible compared to the Grand Canyon location. Did not even get a sear on the noodles. Steak I could tell was leftover from yesterday since I was the first customer in the morning. Chicken was dry and also tasted like the leftover from the day before. The coke soda didn't even taste like coke. Will never come to this location again."}
{"text":"Best chicken teriyaki in town. Really affordable and healthy.. The veggies are fresh and delicious.. Plus the owners are really really nice people"}
{"text":"I love this place, I lost so much weight by eating lunch here all the time, just order with no sauce and put on very little sauce yourself, kick it up with some chili pepper for extra kick in the metabolism."}
{"text":"Took a friend here visiting Vegas, and she &I really liked it. I had not been here in a long time, but it was pretty clear there were new people & management taking care of things now.
We each had the steak rice bowl, and split the sesame garden toss.
Good stuff! I'll be back I am sure!"}
{"text":"The staff here is super friendly!! The food is always amazing and they are very prompt with it also! The best treatment from when I walk in to when I walk out! It is also convenient that you can call and order it ahead of time."}
{"text":"New management is really improving the place. About 2 months ago I really didn't like this place the service was lacking I mean cold crab puffs really.. but this recent experience was.. A big turnaround.. the guys here smiling, happy, talkative about how my food is cooking and just great service. Thanks!"}
{"text":"I have worked in a customer service job for four years and this was an absolute terrible customer service experience. First off, don't come here within the last 40 minutes of them being opened. Everything felt rushed. The lady at the register told myself and other customers \"they were out of meat and it would take at least 20 minutes to cook\" in a persuasive way to try and get everyone out. When I ordered a combo, she asked if I still wanted the egg rolls (that come with the combo) as that would delay my food even longer if I still wanted them. All the nozzles were off the soda machines so getting a drink was an even more difficult process. They also decided to lock up and turn off their open sign 25 minutes prior to close to keep other customers out. The only reason I give this location two stars is because the food is still better than eating at McDonald's. Terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Everytime I come In this place I get greeted by the same people, that's a nice thing and means the workers are friendly And love their job, the food is always great and never had a bad experience.. You must try the Yaki soba bowl, it is my favorite!!"}
{"text":"Of all the Samurai Sam's in the Valley, I like this one the best.  For some reason the chicken is always so much better here - I don't know why but its seriously better here.  I really like the manager guy who is always there (can't remember his name) he always remembers what I order and asks me how business is going.  I really like when chain restaurants aren't so commercial."}
{"text":"They need to get back their old sweet and sour sauce this new sweet and sour sauce is disgusting and no one likes this new sauce. When I asked why they changed and got rid of there old sweet and sour I was told that shamrock fooods doesn't carry the old sweet and sour and they have to buy through shamrock now. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I went in there one evening and was at the register ordering my food. Once my order was taken the lady brought the money to the cook he counted it and stuffed it in his pants. After that he never change his gloves and continued to cook people's food. I asked the register lady to have him change his gloves and she dismissed me like a child. So then I took it upon myself to tell him to change his gloves after handling money. He got all pissy and slowly changed them after was told twice. Gross! Food is good but the service sucks at this location!"}
{"text":"Must be new owners. I have been to this location before and it was pretty good back then. Went tonight and the food was terrible. The vegetables were overcooked and mushy!  Ordered two bowls - one brown rice and one white rice. They mixed up the two orders.  The white rice was very soft and mushy. Too much water and cooked too long.  Not as much food as before either. 
Very disappointing and wont be back.  They should heed these reviews and do something to improve the quality."}
{"text":"The food is quick and delicious, made with fresh whole ingredients. For anyone in a hurry, can fill up fast without feeling guilty about it. How often is that the case? The staff is wonderful- so polite and friendly. Definitely above and beyond for an order-at-the-counter restaurant."}
{"text":"Not a fan of samurai sam ahaha but seriously the food was sub par and the service was abrupt. As i walked in they sounded reluctant to say welcome, and then it took forever to order im thinking i wont be back"}
{"text":"Absolutely awful. I wouldn't feed this slop to my dog. Sent it back twice because it was cold. After watching them prepare it I understand why. They cook the meat far in advance and then put it back on the grill for a few minutes, slap some sauce on it and put it over steamed rice. Nothing fresh here. Move along..."}
{"text":"Always wonderful have been completely satisfied every time!!! I been coming for 8 years and the customer service just keeps gettin better thank u to all the wonderful people who work here!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, great food, great service and great staff.  ample parking and location was convenient and not inside the shopping, easier to get to considering I have a fairly large truck for and not easy to find parking.  during those hot summer days they even have smoothies, I would definitely recommend to my friend locally and friend who come into town.

I always order there regular steak yakisoba bowl with extra veggies and blueberry smoothie, always taste the same and fast service.  could never go wrong...."}
{"text":"Love this place, not often super busy so food comes out hot and quick!  Excellent shrimp bowls or chick bowls and friendly employees!   Egg rolls are grilled not fried and crab puffs are pretty tasty too.  You won't be disappointed for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"OVERPRICED - The noodles are OK - chicken and steak were marinated and tasted very good.  It was very pricey for a bowl - well over $12.  When I inquired about he roughly $8.50 price on the menu, then I was told \"ok it is 90 cents extra for the brocolli\" and something else for the carrots and tax and ...  And the other dish I ordered for my kid was so small for over $6.

For the price, there are many other choices around (e.g. Wok Box is so much better, much cheaper and much larger portions; Jade Palace is a little cheaper and excellent)."}
{"text":"I dropped by to check this place out. The grill is out front and looked messy with a lot of burnt food. I was scared so I did not order food but a boba tea. It was disgusting the bobas were crunchy. I let them know that it was the grossest boba tea I've ever had and returned it to them. I will never set my foot in this place again. Yuck. I expect to see this place on an episode of Dirty Dining soon."}
{"text":"It appears the management has changed.  They are cheating the customers by filling the bowl with rice and some salad and a thin layer of meat on top giving the impression there is a lot of food.

I will never go there again.  My next visit will be toTeriyaki madness."}
{"text":"I am trying to be nice here and maybe I have been spoiled by other Teriyaki places I have been to but this place was average at best.  Sauce seemed watered down and the meat was dry and had no flavor.  The best part of the bowl were the veggies.  Never again."}
{"text":"My hubby likes it here for some reason. I prefer Tokyo Express for a chicken teriyaki bowl any day! Not that the bowls we got here last Saturday afternoon were bad, they just weren't very good."}
{"text":"This has been and always will be my go to spot for a quick rice bowl. The staff is awesome, always remember me and are quick to fill an order. They stay busy and the food is regularly made fresh, they have their system down and can get you in and out in a flash. I can't say enough about this place, after coming here for almost six years every few weeks. It's a staple in my lunch and lite fair rotation. If you're in the area, not looking for much ambiance, but classic and fresh food - come check out Samurai Sams."}
{"text":"I am a frequent patron here and the food is always fresh and great.  Today, I found a piece of hair in my food. I showed the hair to the tall gentleman who was behind the register. He immediately said that none of them has hair. I was totally disgusted. I asked him if he was going to do anything, he said \"no!\" This is by far the worst service I have ever received here. I don't expect much as my meal was only $5, but because of his departing resolution, I will not come back after 6 years"}
{"text":"I've always liked Samurai Sam's for the better part of a decade now.  I'm a spicy chicken teriyaki guy, and they do it right- decent prices too.  The only complaint I have is that it normally takes 10-15 minutes for me to receive my order, which given how simple the food is, seems a bit long.  When I'm in the area I try to call in an order ahead of time so I can bring home a good dinner!"}
{"text":"You can tell difference between the corporate owned Samurai Sam's and franchise owned. This Samurai Sam's i would guess is a franchise.  The cashier is not very thourough when taking orders, talks way to fast, seems to be in his own race to take your order as fast as he can to set a new record on the fastest order taking. Had not even finished giving my order and he is telling me the price, really??
I watched him as he takes orders of other customers and is in a speed race again. Does not even hand the cup to the customer, customer asked for it and pointed to it. 
Then cashier calls my name and says my order is ready. I approach the counter and he states sorry your egg rolls are not ready?!?!
Cutomer service needs to be addressed. This stems from lack of management.
Won't be going back."}
{"text":"This was the first Samaria Sams I've tried. I ordered a chicken bowl with noodles. My chicken was a little dry and so were the noodles. The flavor was good but it seemed as though the noodles and chicken were cooked long before I got there. After finishing my meal and sitting at the table to watch a little bit of the news, I saw a cockroach crawling across the dinning area floor. I'M OUT!!!!!"}
{"text":"Our family made a bad decision to grab dinner here and it will not happen again!  Out of four of us, no one finished their meal - they were barely edible.  The chicken and vegetables tasted frozen/thawed/old and the egg rolls were... well, just plain gross.  I usually prefer to write positive reviews, but I just can't for this place."}
{"text":"I do like Samurai Sam's, but it depends on the time of day that you go. For the most part it is good, and worth trying if you've not tried it before. If you go during a \"slow time\" you'll notice your food isn't that fresh - meat has been sitting for a bit, etc. If you can manage to go at times when there is a faster turn around for food - lunch time, etc, you'll enjoy it quite a bit more. I love the Steak Yaki Soba bowls. They are great."}
{"text":"The wait is always a little long but totally worth it, I always order the vegetable and noodles bowl and it's always fantastic! My mom got the 3.99 bowl, smaller than the regular bowl but still very filling! I always recommend this place to my coworkers :)"}
{"text":"This is a franchised location not far from my house...the food is great and reasonably healthy and they don't charge extra for extra sauce at this location...the only other location I've been to does charge extra.  Kudos in my book for a place that doesn't charge extra for a sauce they are known for!!  I just wish they were open longer hours on weekends but I'm sure their weekend hours are due to the fact that they are located in a commercial area."}
{"text":"Overcooked rice, cold chicken. Do not recommend. When i approached cook would only microwave which in turn, dried out rest of food. Caveat emptor."}
{"text":"Love the quick somewhat healthy lunch, but the three stars is for this order.  I called in an order, teriyaki dark meat chicken and broccoli bowl and no rice teriyaki dark meat chicken bowl.  I received a white meat teriyaki broccoli bowl and the other bowl had rice.  I only had thirty minutes for lunch otherwise, I'd go back.   It would have been nice to get what I ordered.

They make a good bowl in general."}
{"text":"I thought that it was rather pricey for a bowl with not a lot of food in it. After passing by this multiple times, I thought I'd give it a try. It did not held to it's expectation. The place was rather unclean and if I peek in the cooking area, it was a mess. The trash bin was very exposed near the food."}
{"text":"I am giving this location one star because yesterday my husband and I tried to go eat in there and the minute you walk in the door it smells like somebody poured acetone in the ventilation system. They are right next to a nail salon and the smell was so immediately overpowering that we couldn't even walk all the way into the door. I don't know how all of the people working in there don't have headaches 24/7."}
{"text":"We received some coupons at work and decided to try this place out.  I had never been at Samurai Sam's before, but in looked good in the pictures.  Got there and when placing my order I asked a couple of questions about the menu and the cupon I had (what options I had, what else I could get...) and he take the coupon from me and says \"Is only one, teriyaki meat, sauce that's it.\" I said okay (prob had a bad day, won't make a big deal about his attitude), and continue to order adding one more bowl to it.  Every question I would ask him he would answer it as if he was scolding me, just very horrible customer service.  He was older, hispanic male at the cash register, I couldn't see the name tag but he had like a gold tooth it seemed like.  Got my order to go, asked for a couple of fortune cookies from the box sitting behind him when I was about to leave, and he said that my order did not come with any fortune cookies, only the kid's meal.  This I just thought was outrageous, I just spent $20 for 3 bowls and 2 sodas, horrible service, and you are going to deny me of a fortune cookie, really? Really? 

Just a horrible experience, will not be back to this place again."}
{"text":"Would have liked to see fried rice on the menu. However, we ordered the teriyaki chicken bowls with white rice. Delicious. Fresh and came out quickly! Great prices also. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Not sure why the place was so empty at lunch time on a Saturday but I liked it! I had the steak and chicken bowl with soba noodles. Will be back again!"}
{"text":"Best bowls ever. The vibe and decor of the store rocks too. I really love the Bushido writings on the wall. As a student of traditional martial arts and a follower of the way of Samurai. I bring my family and friends here often. Its just great vibes and friendly staff. Truly a hidden gem in Vegas."}
{"text":"I will never come back to this location, 
The service was terrible!
The cashier was nice until I presented my groupon.

He completely changed, and gave me an attitude.

Why place your restaurant on groupn if your going to give your customers an attitude.

Then I heard him talk about me and was laughing about me.

I dont recommend this place"}
{"text":"I went in regardless of their low rating because I didn't think it applied to their thai tea with boba!  I was soo wrong even the boba was gross. Its the first time I buy bad boba -_- I never thought someone can actually mess that up!!!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a teriyaki bowl.  The rice was under cooked, the vegatables over cooked, and the chicken was greasy.  

The customer service was cold and almost approaching rude.  I should have walked out when I saw the floors were dirty and the tables had not been wiped."}
{"text":"Delicious food, reasonable price, clean dining, clean restrooms, their teriyaki sauce taste really good I could finish the whole bottle, customer service is great, they were all friendly! The guy at the cashier smiles a lot and greets customers well, I am here every other night and the guy is really nice and already knows what I am going to order, he is funny. Seems like he and his co workers really love what they are doing, would recommend this place for all teriyaki lovers."}
{"text":"I love Samurai Sams.  Just not THIS Samurai Sams.  Every time I have gone in this location, I have been treated rudely and have had to stand at the register waiting while the employees chat.  EVERY time I have ordered here I order a Spicy teriyaki bowl with dark meat.  EVERY time i get my food its dry chewy white meat and no spicy sauce.  They charge a quarter for the spicy sauce which is no biggie unless YOU DON'T GIVE IT TO ME. I hope this place goes out of business."}
{"text":"The food here was as to be expected and the same as I've experienced at other locations. Were it not for the girl working the register this would have received 4 stars.

I advised the girl that I wanted a chicken bowl and a drink. She rings up only the chicken bowl and then says she needs my credit card back to run a separate charge for the drink. When I'm traveling son company travel a second charge for the same meal is not possible. Everything with expense reporting is very automated.

The right thing for hew to do was just to give me the drink for free. She screwed up. I ended up paying for the beverage with cash. Additionally, it would have been nice of her to tell me that I could have the whole deal for less money if I bought a combo meal.

This all seems pretty trivial, but the crappy attitude I got from her throughout the tire ordeal really pissed me off. This particular location will receive no more lunch business from me. But more importantly, they will no longer receive any catering business from me for the large orders I place for companies in the area when I'm visiting them on business.

Service fail. Get rid of this girl."}
{"text":"We come here multiple times a week. Until today I would have given it 5 stars, however,  they have changed the packs of sweet and sour sauce. The new sauce is gross,  not sweet, and I'm wondering if it's cheaper because the quality isn't good.  If they don't change back to the old sauce packets we'll have to look for another healthy fast food option."}
{"text":"I had the sweet chili bowl. I used to eat Smaurai's farily often when I worked in Chandler. Before I always thought they had great flavor for a great price. I wasn't that impressed when I was here a few weeks ago. The flavor was just ok, nothing special or it just didn't taste like I remembered. Everything was just ok, nothing exceptional. I would go back, but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"I like eating here. It's simple and the yakisoba is yummy. So close to home. Prices are super cheap too."}
{"text":"Chicken teriyaki bowl with brown rice = super yum. Review based solely on that as it's the only think I'll eat here. My coworkers and I frequent this place and they are always more than satisfied with their food. In my opinion, much better than Teriyaki Madness."}
{"text":"yakisoba chicken bowl is just ok. Low carb bowl is not so hot either. I guess it's supposed to be healthy food. Meh."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I had the spicy sumo bowl which came with white rice, veggies, steak and chicken. It was tasty and the portions were huge. A great place to get your protein in after working out at LVAC."}
{"text":"The previous owners took so much pride in their food.  It was always top quality and I never, ever found any gristle or bad meat.  In the last year or more, We've been coming less because it's just not that good, but we live in hope.  I get gristle in my steak bowls and inedible pieces of chicken.  It seems the ratio is more filler like rice or noodles than meat and vegetables.  I used to crave it.  Not it's OK  for a change.  Franchise owners should be held more responsible."}
{"text":"As always the teriyaki chicken Bowl was fantastic! But Apparently today was not customer service day, the lady taking my order took a phone call in the middle of completing my transaction and I was forced to mime can I have my drink cup to the lady. But I will return for the chicken!"}
{"text":"Great place- a little pricey, but It really works if you are craving a chicken bowl. Staff is always friendly- especially Kevin. I always enjoy having  a quick chat with him while my food is being cooked. I go there about once a week, and my coworkers also go there about the same amount."}
{"text":"This is great tasty food.  It's not fast food but it is quick food. If they had beer and tv's it would be the best place in Cave Creek   Yummy"}
{"text":"Location: 7620 South Las Vegas Blvd.
Purchased a Groupon for $14, but it is supposedly worth $28. The Groupon will print two, therefore, you'll have two $14 Groupon Vouchers. We were approached by John (Asian young Guy). While we are looking at the Menu up above on the wall, he was getting impatient. We asked him questions about the menu and he was Curt on answering. I finally gave him the two Groupons vouchers and he said he can only use one per visit. I told him why does the website sell two vouchers at the same time if you can only use one per visit? He doesn't know?

Since there are four of us, wife and two kids, my wife will use one and I will use the other and make two separate receipts. He told me I already know that you're together so he can't do that! I can't believe what I'm hearing. So I just used one Groupon and proceeded the order. This person does not have any customer service skills and tact to deal with customers. Since we're from Cali, we've basically going to throw away the other Groupon voucher.

The food was okay, but the large plate should be a Medium. The steak has a lot tendons that you can't eat."}
{"text":"I've only gone here 3 times. Once because I had a great coupon & the other 2 because it's close to the office. I get the chicken teriyaki bowl. It's ok. Today my chicken was either over cooked or reheated too many times. Only half of the chicken was edible. 
The place is odd, sort of a cafeteria feel. Three restaurants in one."}
{"text":"The Shrimp Bowl is Awsome!  Fresh from Rocky Point!!!. Just tried the PORK Bowl, very good, they  use fresh Pork!
The staff is helpful and friendly.  The big screen TV's are always on for the game.
Dan (retrired Navy) is lots of fun to talk to, always gives my kid a free cookie."}
{"text":"luv this place. Fresh,flavorful teriyaki. My favorite is the shrimp teriyaki.yummmy!! price? yes reasonable. They also took care of us like a special guest even if I use a groupon."}
{"text":"Got a Groupon to here. Checked the place out on Sunday afternoon for lunch. I had the Steak Yakisoba bowl. My wife had the steak with rice. Got the white meat Chicken bowl for my kids. Have to say I liked mine, the steak was very good and cooked perfectly. Good amount of veggies and noodles were with it. The white chicken was a bit dry from the kids bowl. Also had the egg roll which was a bit soggy. 

For the groupon price I was definitely happy, but at full price I dunno if I would be a regular, though I would still go from time to time."}
{"text":"I agree 100% with the other reviewers. About 5-6 years ago, this place was phenomenal. I ate here for lunch with my friends almost weekly. They had great food and was always prepared in a quick and timely manner. 

As it happens, we found a new place and I gradually stopped going as frequently. With fond memories of this restaurant, I went there the other day and I am said to say that it is just a shell of its former self. Portions were smaller overall and the amount of chicken they gave me in my teriyaki bowl was miniscule. My overall experience of eating here was not even close to what I recall. 

I asked and was told that a new owner was running the place, so that explains it. Its too bad, because like I said, it was a great little spot before. Revert to the old ways, and I will once again be a regular."}
{"text":"The food isn't bad but the older Hispanic gentleman who works the cash register has poor customer service skills and could use a couple lessons on manners. Nobody wants to take food from a jackass."}
{"text":"This is the pinnacle of all Samurai Sam's. The staff is polite and efficient, the food is spot on and the building is always clean. I'd drive out of my way to eat at this one."}
{"text":"It smelled like a broken sewer pipe when we walked in. We should have taken that as a sign and left. The food was nothing special and not worth the money. We ordered chicken and steak bowls with vegetables and brown rice. The egg rolls were soggy and flavorless. We could have got a way better meal for the same price somewhere else. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Food is good here spent plenty of money. Came here Saturday 5/23 40 mins before close. Cashier told me they were out of dark chicken. I told her I came for a dark chicken bowl. I asked her would she charge me more for white because they ran out. She actually said yes. I went to five guys and left. Mind you the rice and vegetables that come with the meal cost less than .50 to provide why would u lose a customer over you running out of chicken and opting to charge me more for white meat. This is called fuckery. I'm not one to complain but the profits they make off my sale shouldn outweigh charging me extra to settle for the only chicken they have left. Think about it."}
{"text":"Love it! They are always consistent. I come here for healthy fast food, I crave it a lot!"}
{"text":"Don't waste your time or money. The meat is tough, servings are small, and the overall value just isn't there. Find a Teryaki Madness instead. Believe me, you'll get a much better meal there."}
{"text":"I ordered the Sumo Bowl which includes grilled steak and chicken. Both meats were high quality. The serving portion was huge and I could only eat half (and I fairly large myself). For a quick and relatively healthy meal you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I really don't understand the fuss about this place. Food was food. Nothing special. A little bland. Not my style."}
{"text":"Ive been going to this place after my workout at lvac and ever since I always get my beef and broccoli bowl with onions and brown rice and a daily special for later on the day. 
I love the teriyaki sauce! Sometime i got myself the teriyaki bottle that they sell and gave it to my parents to put on their home made food and they liked it!

Theyre constant on how they make the food and i love it spicy! So far its nice that this place has gotten more customers the recent week ive been there.

Would recommend the beef and broccoli bowl add onions on it to have more flavor! Keep it up"}
{"text":"Nice guy behind the counter, but very stingy on the meat. I asked for 2 dishes, both \"Large\" meaning extra meat but it still was paltry. I asked for a meat/chicken combo w/brown rice and he got it right. I also asked for a large white meat chicken with NO rice, but more veggies. I guess that was too complicated.

Both dishes served in a plastic bowl 5/6th full of rice, a thin layer of veggies and a thinner layer of meat.

It took exactly 75 seconds for my order to be passed to me. If this was McDonald's , that'd be normal.  For a teriyaki place, that's an obvious indication of 'pre-cookery' so who knows how long ago the meat was made.

I just moved here and I really hope this isn't the best Teriyaki this area has to offer.
I also got some chicken wrap thing, which was actually pretty good, well 2 of them as that was my own \"delivery reward\".
Paid $19 for the entire order.

I won't go back since I'm not into paying all that $$ for a huge bowl of rice and very little meat.

This place would not last 1 week in Seattle. (or many other places for that matter)"}
{"text":"AMAZING service, food, home made sauce and atmosphere. The menu is a mix between vegetarian and meat dishes over rice or noodles. YUM! This place is a wonderful quick spot for healthy lunch. When they cook their veggies, they do not come out soggy or salty, they are still packed with their nutrients and have a great crunch. The food is prepared very well. The business hours vary, so make sure its open if you are in a hurry! They have home made sauces as well as a mix of hot sauces and the dreaded GHOST PEPPERS! Fantastic little stop and very affordable."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, affordable food. The food is good but they give you lots of rice in the rice bowls (not a bad thing), the noodles are good as well. The eggrolls are a great add on as well as the pot stickers. If you want quick teriyaki style food I would recommend this place for sure!"}
{"text":"Brown rice is MUSH!  Today was the second time I've been since my office moved a block away.  I gave it another chance because there is no way a place like this would over cook their rice to the point where it practically melted together....think again.  I have been to Samurai Sams a million times over the years for the \"healthy alternative\" to fast food and either something has changed to the quality of food or I've been there too many times that I'm burned out.  The rice issue is huge...who wants mushy rice?  Like someone said in reviews below-everything is now premade just sitting there.  Not sure how true that is but thats what it seems.  Big bummer. :("}
{"text":"Don't waste your money here. Foods and noodles are cold and burn. Pot stickers look like just come out from microwave. Receptionist is not welcoming."}
{"text":"I know that this is Americanized Japanese style food but I still like it. Why? The teriyaki sauce is really good. More flavorful than most places. They use steak instead of cheap meat and they grill it to perfection. I also like the fresh crisp vegetables that they use. The place is nice and clean. Samurai Sam's is a hit for me."}
{"text":"I'm here for the first time and this place is pretty good. They sell healthy Asian food. Tasty & fast. The price is ok. Would I come back here? Yes, but not one of my favorite healthy Asain food places."}
{"text":"Great food great service! I recommend a yakisoba bowl with steak and chicken. The food is cooked fresh and is served hot and quickly"}
{"text":"Nasty. My rice was crunchy, steak was full of fat, and the employees were assholes. I'm going to tmad."}
{"text":"Randal is very slow at making food and that causes my kids to get very angry and upset when they have to wait that long for their food. Please do something about this because if this problem doesn't change, I'm never eating there again"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good for lunch. They have a tasty Teriyaki Bowl with lots of rice and veggies with chicken or steak.  They have a wraps with whole wheat tortillas with chicken or steak too. They offer noodle bowls and whole grain rice as an option too.  The egg rolls were fresh and different and really good and the service was very fast (kind of like ths review) even though they were packed. 
Nice fresh food and smiles.  I like that."}
{"text":"I used to go there ALL the time 8 years ago! They were amazing and I was obsessed! Since it's been so long and I work near them , I decided to stop by for lunch. I ordered dark chicken with brown rice and veggies. It was pretty much a sweet soup with the heavy amount of teriyaki sauce they put in my bowl. I didn't finish it and ended up with a stomach ache."}
{"text":"Great food also great customer service they offer substitution option which yogis grill across the street from them doesn't instead they want to charge 5 dollars for a side of noodles I love samurais food always delicious!"}
{"text":"The locations are sparse and hard to get to. We happened to be by this location, and decided to stop in since we had not had it in  quite a while. I went to order a chicken wrap and was told they were out of chicken for the wraps. Then they told us we could order a chicken bowl because I don't like steak. My sister asked why couldn't they just put the bowl chicken in a wrap, but was told they could not do that. Makes you wonder how fresh their food is if their bowls are sitting there already made."}
{"text":"I keep trying them but each time their chicken is so dry!  They do have great customer service.....but I can't go for just that."}
{"text":"I've been going here for about 2 months and never been disappointed. I always get the chicken teriyaki bowl. It's reasonably priced for the portion. And even made my coworkers reconsider after having bad experiences at other locations. All the employees there are super courteous. Some days I have to refrain from getting it everyday. 

Definitely recommend. Never a ridiculous line like the other eateries around (Fired pie or chipotle) quick service if you're on a short lunch or in a rush."}
{"text":"Same 3 star food as any other location, but here they seem much happier when you are headed out the door than when you come in. Evidenced by their never asking but assuming your order is to go."}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots. Simple bowls with lots of flavor . Fast efficient service every time"}
{"text":"First time here and I tried the Korean BBQ bowl with dark chicken. The chicken was good and cooked right. The white rice was good. The pot stickers that came with the combo we're good but soft because they're not fried. Fast and friendly service with reasonable prices. I was filled up by the regular bowl. My only suggestion is for the Korean BBQ sauce is increase the flavor of it, it was a little bland. If it was more flavorful you wouldn't have to add more sauce."}
{"text":"Great people that work here. The always try there best and the take extra care of me lol because I'm a regular. We small business stick together and help each other out. Food was great today :)"}
{"text":"I can always rely on smiles and great food in a hurry from this location. The owner is so nice and every employee I've encountered here has been positive and professional."}
{"text":"I'm always pleased with the food here. Last night I got the shrimp and noodle bowl. Lots of shrimp in it, it surprised me for the price of 8.99. I ordered the chicken and rice bowl for my son, and you can choose from either brown or white rice. Service was especially fast last night. I've never eaten in, always do take out, but I guess it is an ok atmosphere for dining in. Will return many times."}
{"text":"Great place to purchase food. The staff is knowledgeable, friendly, and are timely-mannered towards their customers. The food and dining floor are exceptionally great and is a must-go for regular lunch and dinner options. You can't beat Samurai Sam's if you are looking to get in  and out with great tasting food."}
{"text":"Thank You Steve, you are the true definition of OWNER OPERATED, I am a fan for sure. 
I have been eating here for 5 years, and you are there always making sure your customers are happy, You must know 10,000 people by name.

And this is one of my weekly lunch habits. original small bowl, dark meat chicken \"veggies on the side\" YEPPP!! I love a good Teriyaki Bowl."}
{"text":"Stark contrast between this location and their other location in phoenix in terms of ambiance and food. was extremely excited to get my teriyaki craving fulfilled after having gone to their other location and loving the food, so i had high expectations. Also for the fact that they are healthier than other japanese/teriyaki places, i was excited. From the inside, looks more like a really cheap, old takeout place, but very clean nonetheless. I was still hoping for a great vegetable teriyaki brown rice bowl. What I got was hardly any veggies that were watered down and no flavor at all, i don't even think they added any teriyaki sauce and the food was not hot. Overall, sad waste of $5, I ended up going home and adding my own teriyaki sauce and siracha.
Only gave it 2 stars because the person at the register was very helpful. 
If you want to try this place, definitely, DO NOT go to this location, it was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Place was empty when I came in. I ordered the chicken breast bowl with brown rice and veggies to go. The 2 people working there were alright. Customer service was nothing special just got me In And out. Food was served quick with no problems. The bowl was good nothing special just a quick lunch."}
{"text":"It was closed when I tried going in at 12pm on a Saturday. No closed signs or anything.

UPDATE: Contacted the company and it was a matter of the incorrect times on the website. Now I just gotta try the food!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for almost 10 years now.  This place is close to my work so it's pretty convenient.  For those of you who are aware of the area you know there isn't much out here.  That being said I love the place.  I go a few times a week and the staff is very friendly.  The food is always good and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 large all white meat chicken bowls and 2 grilled egg rolls.  The egg rolls were taken out of the refrigerator and heated in a microwave and were mushy and gross. There was a hair on the outside of the lid on my meal and also a hair in my food that I discovered about half way through my meal.  Both meals looked as thought everything was leftover from the night before and reheated.  The chicken was very dry (just like reheated chicken) and the veggies were mushy.  I won't be going back for leftovers."}
{"text":"Well,  I have been sick with terrible food poisening since Sunday evening.  It began within 2 hours of eating here.  I witnessed a pan of melting ice on the counter near the ice tea, they were digging something out of there...the tea, lemongrass green tea had weird floaties in it, when the food came, it was barely warm, the eggroll, cold.  While eating, the crew that was cooking, sat down to eat in the dining area with us.  Very unimpressive.  Just dirty and not who I'd want to cook for me.  
I so regret eating here, my whole week of activities are curtailed.  I am turning them in to the health department.  Shame on you , all who are involved here, for not doing the right thing and taking care of your customers, YOU CAN KILL PEOPLE WITH YOUR LAZINESS."}
{"text":"This place has the freshest chicken and veggies.  I would highly recommend trying this place out for lunch if you're in the area"}
{"text":"Came here a few nights ago for some brain food, and I guess I came in at the right time. I've heard stories about lackluster customer services but each experience that I've ever had has not been bad in any way like the \"others\" say. Like forreal.

It wasn't busy that night, but they saw me park my car as they were cleaning up to pass the time and all the employees pretty much got up into position and waited for me as I was walking in. Kind of awkward, kind of nice to be appreciated. They all intently waited for me to make up my mind.

I ordered the STEAK RICE BOWL with brown rice and veggies. By the time I was done paying for the order, they were practically almost done with my food. I was thanked for coming and it did feel genuine. I was pleasantly surprised that the services was so good.

Now the fact that the food was cooked so quickly, I was hesitant, but the taste test proved otherwise as my food was delicious. I've come to this place before, one of my younger brothers used to work here and the quality of the food has always been very good. I don't usually go to other locations so I can't speak on their behalves, BUT this place never disappoints."}
{"text":"My sister working out so she wanted something healthy while we're here. I wasnt really for it but I'm glad I did. When we enter, we were greet right away by the cashier.

I got the steak rice bowl. The rice was fluffy and moist, the steak was cook perfectly and veggies was blah but their teriyaki sauce pulled the whole meal together. My sister couldn't decide if she wanted brown rice or noodle, so the cashier let her order half and half. I didn't try my sister steak bowl but she said she liked the brown rice here, it wasn't dry like other places. 

The cashier came by and checked up on us to make sure everything was going okay. I thought that was nice of her. I would come back when I'm in town.

The bathroom was CLEAN."}
{"text":"Not bad, the chicken with teriyaki sauce bowl I had was ok. They mucked up my order by giving me brown instead of white rice, they did serve my order super fast. It had a lot of chicken which was soft and pretty decent, the teriyaki sauce was good.
For the price and convenience, this is not bad spot."}
{"text":"This is the worst spicy pepper steak bowl I have ever had. Way to fatty for me.  The rice was what I had for lunch today"}
{"text":"Great fresh food! So many new options like brown rice, salmon, Korean bbq and more! Healthy lunch options. Delish! I had forgotten how good this place is!"}
{"text":"Their teriyaki sauce were super sweet! Like syrup sweet. Me and my friend couldn't finish our bowl and had to to go them. If you like real teriyaki chicken bowl taste, this place is not for you."}
{"text":"I Love Samurai Sams --- BUT Not this ONE !!!

Went in and purchased 3 bowls -- 2 combos and was $27.00 .    I used a Groupon that saved us $6.00.  As soon as the gentlemen at the cash register saw that we wanted to use our GROUPON -- he immediately said we would have a long wait because they were busy.

We waiting around 15-20 minutes to get 3 Terriyaki bowls !!!!    To top that off the bowls were half full --- hardly ANY MEAT at all --- I am assuming because we applied a Groupon to the order.  WE  should of said something when they gave us the HALF FULL Bowls but we were so hungry we did not !!!

Prior to leaving -- my daughter had to use the restroom  -- FILTHY, NO TOILET PAPER, NO SEAT PROTECTORS AND NO PAPER TOWELS.   I guess this is their way of saving more SAVE MONEY!

WE WILL NEVER Go to this Samurai Sams EVER EVER EVER AGAIN !!

Disgusted at getting SO RIPPED OFF Tonight !!"}
{"text":"We ordered veggie rice bowl and veggie yakisoba bowl. The teriyaki sauce was just toooooo sweeeeet. We got additional spicy sauce which was less sweet and not spicy at all! We went for the chili paste to balance the sweetness!!! Infact there were a few other customers whom we saw not finishing their meal/ adding variable condiments coz of the unbearable sweetness!!!"}
{"text":"If you look at my few posts I think you'll see I usually try to keep the bad to myself and only share exceptional experiences. Despite only receiving three stars, I am still going share an exceptional experience. 

I came to this location after working out at the LVAC across the street. I asked for a combo but they were out of egg rolls, and crab wontons, and potstickers.  So, no combo. No problem, I'll have a salad. Except they were out of half of those too. 

Basically the management at this location stinks. 

However, the young lady behind the counter kept a smile and cheerful attitude the entire time despite being let down so severely by whomever completes the ordering for this location.  Well done. 

Oh, I left with a chicken and steak yakisoba bowl. Dark meat, all out of white chicken breast."}
{"text":"Nothing really special here. Pretty much the same as any other teriyaki place.

I had the chicken teriyaki bowl, white meat with white rice. It was good, but nothing that blew me away.

However, the counter girl was very nice!"}
{"text":"Inconsistent portions, poorly seasoned food and BOTTOM OF THE BARREL service. No greeting when you walk in, no smiles. Employees don't even look at you when you go in.  Beef is overcooked and dry, vegetables are steamed with no salt so no flavor there whatsoever. Soba is just boiled noodles as well. No flavor. And take a look at a pic of the egg roll I got. Burnt till it was black! Seriously?"}
{"text":"The food was okay. I had a combination teri chix and beef bowl with rice. It was nothing I'd make a special trip for. The menu at this location is kind of confusing. The menu looks like there's so many options but they are essentially just variations of the same offerings. I'd much prefer eating at Fuwa Grill. It's in the same area except it's inside of the mall. Less convenient but worth it for me."}
{"text":"Siracha had dried goo on top, floors were dirty, I ordered dark meat n got dry white breast. The bowl was but the service has deff hone downhill n you can tell. The place was almost empty at noon"}
{"text":"I love this place. The food is what it's supposed to be, teriyaki chicken, steak or veggies. The large chicken bowl is $5. Don't listen to the bad reviews, if you're nearby and want teriyaki this place is great"}
{"text":"Tried a new place for lunch. The service was great, very friendly and attentive. Food came out within about 5 mins, perfect for a lunch break pick up. I have the teriyaki chicken bowl for $5 (great deal). I like that I was given the option of light or dark chicken. I had dark meat and it was delicious! Veggies were nice and crunchy and the chicken was perfectly juicy."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and hot. I love this place! I only have 30 minutes for lunch, but that's no problem here. Chad and his staff are friendly and efficient. Best place to come to in a time crunch or not, and when you just want good food."}
{"text":"Just got my first Samurai Sam bowl through UberEATS! I must say, it was very fast considering it was a delivery. The food was awesome! I ordered their Special Combination bowl. The beef tastes good, the sauce is the bomb! I will order again!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite during lunch. It's small and clean.   My order came out fairly quickly.  I had a chicken bowl.  All and all it was a decent lunch.   I feel it was a bit pricey for a bowl of rice and chicken."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!  There isn't a healthier or quicker place to get a bite to eat for lunch.  Steve, Alex, and Magda are always awesome and welcoming when I need my midday meal.  The chicken and steak teriyaki bowls are delicious!"}
{"text":"Sometimes service is awful but the food is good BUT HERE ITS NOT THR CASE!
The cashier was so rude and didn't even smile or say Hi, my wife ordered yakisuba noodles-sims like it was frozen before they took it from some frozen bag infront of us and that was taste like cheap noodles -very dry. I get the white rice and chicken -white rice was full of dried chewy pcs and both of our chicken was full of bones and super dry.
The guy that cook the chicken on the grill  coffin few times to the grill area-on the chicken !!!!!!
We order an egg roll and they says it's veggie we found some unknown meat pcs inside -so we asked again and they says that they not sure if it's only veggie!!!
How come an employee is giving you that answer; \"I am not sure and I don't know\""}
{"text":"Food is always tasty here. Fast, fresh and friendly. Always smiling and distinctly remembered me and has always been pleasant, despite my infrequent visits. The crab puffs and noodle bowls are awesome!!"}
{"text":"Food and staff is great at the 67th ave location....healthy alternative with great service...keep up the great work.."}
{"text":"Went into this location the other day and was really impressed with the staff..they made a point to come over and ask me how the food was and if they could take my trash for me...i thought the food was hot and delicious...I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Our family loves samurai sams. The food, service and atmosphere are great. And the employees are always so friendly."}
{"text":"I always get a quality bowl of food here. Rice is always cooked right and meat is juicy and tender. Never any complaints."}
{"text":"I really like the food here but because I don't eat rice much I don't come here often. I had one of those stamp cards that you get the 10th free. Finally filled it up. 8 of the stamps the employees initialed and the last stamp they used a tiny stamp on it. When I went to use it today for a free bowl, the employee said they couldn't take it because the 8 visits were marked with initials. I asked if that was wrong, then why on my 9th visit had the employee stamped the 9th with no questions.  Granted this is only a $7 bowl but it totally p...d me off. If you're gonna gave stamp cards that have no expiration dates, then honor them."}
{"text":"A work colleague recommended we go here for a quick lunch in between meetings. He's local to Phoenix so trusting him, I figured, would be wise. 

I was right. 

There is not a lot of variety on the menu but that's sort of the point. This is a specialty-type place, and what is here is very good. A wide assortment of rice dishes and wraps/burritos are available. I ordered the Wrap and Roll Teriyaki. It was outstanding in every respect. Think BIG burrito and small egg roll, which complemented each other quite well. 

It's a casual place with soda machines and a friendly, efficient staff. 

But next time I'm going for one of those rice bowls. They looked pretty good."}
{"text":"Let me tell you a true story about this location...

I needed to use the restroom before I ordered and ate.  I walked down a hallway and passed kitchen supplies and a bicycle.  The bathroom was a horrible mess and immediately I noticed there was no soap.  One bathroom, employees and guests...no soap...hmmmm.  I immediately turned around and got out of there...sickness waiting to happen."}
{"text":"I love Samurai Sam's and always get the Spicy beef and broccoli bowl. Size is great and I always take home some leftovers. Staff is way friendly and the place is always clean."}
{"text":"I always hit this place up after the gym cuz I'm trying to eat healthier after I kick my a** working out.  I'm not a big fan of eating fast food so this is a better alternative.  Whatever you order here will be really good...they pretty much make it fresh while you wait so that is the really good thing.
You can't go wrong with the white meat chicken breast veggie rice bowl or with the salmon bowl.  Same great taste every time!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good.  I've had the chicken with vegetables bowl, and the 'riceless bowl'.   I would recommend getting the sauce on the side, as they usually drench it on there.  Veges are pretty good and the price is ok."}
{"text":"We came here Sunday afternoon at 1:30. The place was closed!! It clearly states on the door they are open 11to7 on Sundays. Happened several other times too. Seems like they open when they feel like it. Terrible service. Every time we go in there they always mess up our order. I always have to check it on the way out. The cashier asked me if I had a dime so he didn't have to give me coins back. He said he doesn't like dealing with coins. It smelled like sewage the last time we were in there. We turned around and walked out. It's a shame because we really like the food and it's close to home."}
{"text":"The staff of this place are garbage, they treat people like crap. I ordered my food and for some reason they brought it right out to me with in 30 seconds. So of course the quality was poor, it's been sitting around for who knows how long. I been to many Sams and this one is the worst, most of them cook the food fresh!"}
{"text":"Nice clean location. My dish was hot fresh and fast but, a little over priced for the quantity. I give four stars for quality as my bowl of shrimp with vegetables was equal to that of eating at an actual restaurant and not a fast food spot. The employees greeted me promptly when I walked in and when placing my order I asked about the eegee slushees that they displayed in photos. She offered me a free sample of my choosing and the watermelon pineapple was a lightly sweetened cool refreshing treat. I have never eaten at a Samurai Sams before now and I don't think it would be a place I would go out of my way for. I didn't mind it as my daughter wanted chipotle next door and Samurai Sam's gave me the option for a healthy option of eating out. A quick tip they offer brown rice with all meals."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting.... Whoever owns this place should be appalled and embarrassed. My white meat chicken bowl contained multiple pieces of dark meat, and bone that almost cracked my tooth. The side salad came with white vinegar for dressing!!! WHITE VINEGAR?? Are these people that dumb. Who the F serves straight up white vinegar as a dressing?? Last but not least, the 3 piece pot sticker order that only came with 2 pieces. These pot stickers were so pathetically small, I felt bad for them. I havent been to this location in years, and I wont be going back till it goes out of business and another restaurant takes over. Peace bro"}
{"text":"yesterday my family and i bought food from this location, it was good until i got two bites into it and a huge cockroach was in my bowl. it looks like it was cooked with the food, the cockroach was dead and had spicy teriyaki sauce on it. if you choose to go to this location after reading this i would highly recommend you check your food for any cockroachs. never go to this location! highly not recommend for anyone!"}
{"text":"Came in today for the first time.  Place was clean, the line was moving fast.  I asked if I could order one of their signature dishes, but instead of using the Rice, I asked for the noodles.  I was told this was not possible, which is surprising, as they allege these are made to order.  I ended up getting nothing, I will go to another place to grab a quick lunch.  Too bad."}
{"text":"So many great meals here, but tonight staff insisted upon sweeping (rude) and mopping (gross, especially that strong chemical smell). Truly DGAF if workers want to wrap up early. If you're open, don't sweep or mop with pungent cleaning chemicals. I know it's a cliche that customers tend to leave bad reviews when things go badly, and don't despite many good experiences, but hoping this can persuade management to review these practices."}
{"text":"I do not believe this night crew actually listens to customers.  Always make them repeat the order!  Every time I've come here they get something wrong."}
{"text":"I am not the one always leave review on Yelp but I have to do this time. 
The food was not tasty at all. Boba was nasty. 
I was so shocked to our total bill because it was so expensive. They didn't tell us about additional price for white meat when they asked the choice of red or white meat. I could not find that additional price for white meat on the menu. I have ordered deal menu on the door but until my husband asked why our total was so expensive, the guy didn't make it deal price. This place is not tasty or nice. We would go to teriyaki madness and never come back to Samurai sams!"}
{"text":"I love Samurai Sam's because it has healthier options for things such as egg rolls and noodles. I love the taste of the food as well. But what REALLY makes a difference at this location is the woman behind the counter, who I assume is the owner. She is sooo nice! The seevice is always excellent! I always go back to this specific location because of her."}
{"text":"Looks a clean restaurant and good customer service. Bowls to small for the price. I can go to Pei Wei get the kid bowl go the same price or lower."}
{"text":"One of our favorite teriyaki places and we drive from Goodyear just to eat here. Wish there was a Samurai Sam's closer to us."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and always consistent chicken bowls. A great part about this store is they give you bottles of spicy and regular teriyaki sauce to add to your bowls. Some stores charge 25 cents for an extra little container of sauce. This one also has a TV which I like to watch while inhaling the brown rice no veggie white chicken bowls. :) Yum! Keep up the great work Sammy Sam."}
{"text":"Awesome as usual. I can't say anything bad about this Sammy Sams!"}
{"text":"I really like the place and the staff is always so friendly. I always choose the same things- chicken or a steak bowl- light sauce, light rice- veggies. I like that my food is made while I wait."}
{"text":"This is more of a review of costumer service than the food quality which I'm sure is good if I had a chance to order it. I walked in to this location and was greeted by the employee at the counter. While I was looking over the menu the employee says something to her other employee which I didn't quite catch, but once the person in back responded she said that they were closed for the day. It was 4:50, and I asked what time they closed. She responded with 5:00 and I replied back, ok, so you are still open? No, we closed early today. While leaving, I looked for something with their store hours and nothing was displayed, but their neon \"OPEN\" sign was shining bright. Yay for lazy employees!"}
{"text":"After reading Lindsey's review, I had to think twice about my original review of this place. Yes, I had been back and gave it another shot.

Yes, perhaps, I was a bit douchy in my prior review. 

This place is definitely a great spot if you need a quick lunch, and you are on the go. Its a fairly comfortable place to eat, and it's better for you than a Baconator (although, that does sound delicious right about now).

They tend to water down their Sriracha, but it might be more of a heat thing rather than a cost cutting thing. Sriracha can be a bit spicy for some.

The spicy chicken bowl is the way to go. Try it. Don't listen to my old review. I was probably having a bad day at work."}
{"text":"I asked for my veggies to be sauteed but there just wasn't any flavor and there was way more rice than veggies. I asked for it be spicy and it wasn't at all. Unfortunately, I'll pass on this place."}
{"text":"Great food! This place had always been a favorite. The grilled egg rolls are the BEST!! AND THIS LOCATION HAS LEMON EEGEES!!?"}
{"text":"Noodles w/chicken breast was great, my family enjoyed their meals as well.  Customer service was great."}
{"text":"Me and my family are not impressed with a few things at this location.... the cashier works the register and cooks food but I have yet to see her put on gloves nor wash her hands in between?? I asked for more teriyaki sauce and the cook hands me over the same bottle he is using to prepare my food?? My sons chicken was cold and my husband had a 1/4 full bowl of dry noddles with salmon on top?? I glance over and see another guest ask for extra teriyaki sauce and guess what the same cook gave him the same bottle he gave me??? Yuck!! I would rather them put the community bottle out then have that same bottle behind the counter with fresh food where none of the staff are wearing gloves and germs can be transferred to everyone's food! This place needs tighten up!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of teriyaki, and Samurai Sam's does a pretty good job. I've tried the various chicken and beef teriyaki bowls they offer, and they're all pretty good. I usually will get the chicken teriyaki bowl with dark meat and white rice. For some reason the white chicken meat just always seems to be too dry. I have tried both dining in, and have called in orders for pick up. So far they have not messed up my orders and were ready when I got there. I really enjoy Samurai Sam's but I just couldn't give them 5 stars. At least at this location, the portions can be inconsistent. I've had orders where I asked for dark meat and got white; or there were plenty of veggies but very little meat. On another instance, the rice was course and hard. Overall I like this place because it's quick, healthy, and affordable. The service is usually good as well, so I'll keep coming back"}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill a bit in recent years (new management). However I still find it plenty enjoyable, the staff is usually freindly and I've never had problems with service. It is true they can take a long time though, for some reason every time I get an egg roll it seems like a fifteen minute wait, what is that about? Lol I basically stopped ordering an egg roll with my meal because of this."}
{"text":"I just stopped by this place to pick up a quick dinner - I was in too much of a hurry to cook for myself, but really didn't want fast food.  This was kind of the perfect alternative, it was quick and cheap, but also tasty and reasonably healthy.  I had the combo yakisoba.  The beef was delicious, the chicken was just ok.  They also deliver.

Edit: Went back and had the spicy beef with brocolli, delicious!  The fruit sorbet desserts were also very tasty."}
{"text":"They only have one register open and there's 10 people in line come on really I don't understand I really like this place too but now I can't eat"}
{"text":"Nommy nommy nom nom.

I always get the $3.99 special with just brócoli for veggies. 

They charged me .50 extra this time but whatever's. 

The cabbage gives me a tummy ache and the carrots are hard so just get the musical fruit veggies. 

It's always good and fresh. Hit or a miss on the attitude of the employees.

They were pleasant this time though. 

Only lost one star because I got charged for my brócoli and because there was raw chicken just chillin in a bucket next to the grill. Cook or cover that shizz homies."}
{"text":"So, I've ate here a few times since it's around the corner from work. Food is good, I usually get the chicken breast Yakisoba bowl. It's pretty tasty. The food is cheap and fast, and portion size is decent. But something here ALWAYS upsets my stomach. Not sure what it is, but this place may have you running to the bathroom after lunch!"}
{"text":"I gave 4 stars because there food is delicious but the last couple times I've got lunch there they over charged my debit card for example my total yesterday was like 7.77 the charged my card over 9 dollars and its cleared sooooo therefore someone is getting over on their customers  bad business. I understand it's only a couple bucks but a couple bucks is a couple bucks!!!"}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend this place for those who work out and need a healthy meal to refuel themselves; or those looking for a good healthy meal in general! 

I am here on vacation and like many people, I wanted to stay active and eat right.  I wasn't sure if I would have been able to do that, especially here in Vegas but this place definitely did that for me! 

I was greeted when I walked into the store with lots of energy and happy spirits. 

I couldn't decide if I wanted rice or noodles and they were so kind to let me have both! The brown rice was delicious, so fluffy, and moist! (I usually get dried brown rice from other places so I was super happy that it was made right!  ) And the noodles were excellent especially with their teriyaki sauce. I also usually go for sriracha but I tried their seven season spice and it was so perfect with the dish!! I wish I could take it home to season all my meals! 

They gave a great amount of steak / chicken which I was very pleased with! ( we need our proteins:)) and I received my food very fast. It's like fast healthy food. Who doesn't like getting their food faster than expected?? 

The vegetables were not seasoned but it went perfectly with the teriyaki sauce they spread over the bowl alongside that seven season spice! 

Their customer service was awesome. They checked up on us to make sure we were enjoying the meal, and were super friendly to everyone that came through the door as well as when they left. I can't express how much I believe customer service makes the experience all the better. 

I will definitely return every time I'm on vacation! Great customer service, and great healthy food choices. 

Plus they even have a calorie chart for those of you who count!!! How awesome!"}
{"text":"I come here so much they know my name, always greet me with a smile when I walk in. Very reasonably priced, tasty teriyaki bowls."}
{"text":"There was hair in my mouth after taking a bite of food and threw it away right away. I so surprised that I didn't even take a picture. I was short black curly hair and my husband has no hair and I have long brown hair so it wasn't either of us. I'm literally traumatized, that is so disgusting be careful here!! Don't get food poisoning!"}
{"text":"The service is ridiculous! Coming in seemed like a battle between two parties. It was our first time here so we took a little longer to decide on our order. The older man stood there and stared us down the whole time. 

I ordered the 5$ bowl, and he kept asking me if I wanted other options, after I said I want the 5$ deal, he acted surprised like \"ooooh the $5 bowl\". Yes, that's what I said man. Veggies were undercooked and almost absent. We also ordered the kids meal with dark meat. It was the smallest plastic bowl, no veggies, & WHITE meat. When we asked for the kids drink, he said he didn't charge us for the meal, only the bowl. Yoshinoya is better than this place. 

The man gave off an uninviting demeanor, almost rude. He earned them the one star for sure. Not coming back nor recommending to anyone."}
{"text":"friendly & fast customer service! 
my favorite thing to order are their yakisoba bowls, 
the steak and shrimp are cooked to perfection based on your preference (: 
i will definitely be going back here with my friends and family
also, the best part is that the food is HEALTHY !"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times. Friendly service. I will probably not go back because the last couple of visits the chicken has been dry and the steak is not edible. The vegetables always looks old and burnt."}
{"text":"Very healthy food and a very nice size portion of food. The food is fresh and its tasty. The dark meat chicken rice bowl is very nice. Service was prompt and food came up quickly. Far better choice than Chipotle up the street."}
{"text":"Not sure how I did not know about this place for so long but I am happy I found it!

The staff is super friendly and provided great suggestions. I love the selection of being able to have white meat. The noodles are delicious and the food is always flavorful!"}
{"text":"This is the best samurai sam in the valley
I drive all over town I will drive out of my way to eat here staff is kool owner is great! Dont pass up the chance to eat here...."}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly and restrooms were clean
Really liked the edamame garlic. The bowl was good just the chicken was dry
Couldn't really eat it. Overall a good samurai sans"}
{"text":"Place is small, the food is limited to on what you want. It's a nice place for a quick grab for lunch. Nothing extreme but nothing bad. Place is an alright spot. Been here for years finally went in to try it. Will be back but won't be my first choice of food."}
{"text":"Always delicious.  A good go-to for a quick and healthy lunch.  Happy customer for seceral years!"}
{"text":"Good food, quick service. I always come, order and have my order ready less than 10m. I try a few dishes but i will stick with their chicken. I try steak once but too much fat and very chewy. Apart from that, their chicken is da best. Small dark chicken bowl with brown rice is my favorite."}
{"text":"We had three entrees and unanimously agreed that if we gave it to our dogs; they'd no longer be our best friends.   The meat was overcooked and it was like Samurai Sam karate chopped my intestines.  Summary - Meh on its best day."}
{"text":"Restaurant seems kinda dingey inside, and some of the surfaces did not look like they had been cleaned in a long, long time. Samurai Sam's, I wanted to love you, as I miss good Teriyaki places in Phoenix (they are everywhere in Seattle, literally 30 within 5 miles of my old house). But no such luck, the steak teriyaki is chewy and has a funky  taste, and the chicken is nothing special, fairly dry, in an overly-sweet teriyaki sauce. Nothing seemed fresh at all, and based on the speed with which it was served, I doubt it was. For what you pay, you don't get a lot of chicken/steak, and mostly it's just a bowl of rice. Won't be back- The lack of cleanliness I could accept, but subpar teriyaki for a high price I simply cannot abide."}
{"text":"It's basic, inexpensive and you good get value for your money. In the realm of Teriayki places, I like sam's because they offer the chance to put white meat in the wrap or burrito for only 50 cents more and don't charge extra for more sauce on the side. Today, I ordered my usual, white meat wrap with white rice and sauce on the side (always a key decision). Mix of Broccoli, carrots and cabbage I think and real slices of breast meat in the wrap for only about $6.00. It's one of those places you can go to and know that every time, your not playing Russian roulette. Healthier than any fast food and will leave you plenty of room for dinner."}
{"text":"It has the wraps, smoothies and the teriyaki bowls.
Healthy eating, brown rice, white rice, white meat, dark meat. Geeze, a variety. Nice staff
 While waiting for my order to go, Lil did I realize that they charged me 99 cents for white meat and 25 cents (to go fee). Unless If I'm desperate, I'd rather go down to another qsr and get another meal. c'mon if you're gonna mess me over, do it discreetly (like McDonalds).
This location doesnt accept the coupons. I was just dismayed at the fact that something that should come with the bowl, shouldnt be charged extra."}
{"text":"Best bowls ever. The vibe and decor of the store rocks too. I really love the Bushido writings on the wall. As a student of traditional martial arts and a follower of the way of Samurai. I bring my family and friends here often. Its just great vibes and friendly staff. Truly a hidden gem in Vegas. Sumo bowls are to die for."}
{"text":"Grabbed a quick lunch here and it's been awhile since I had any food at Sam's. The menu is a bit bigger now, but they still have all the usual suspects and I still got the wrap instead of the bowl. The rice seemed a bit overcooked and the sweet and sour sauce packets were tasteless. Also ordered the teryiaki sauce on the side which was a good choice based on other photos. This is the best sauce, but on this day it just barely helped the flavorless food. The chicken was pretty good though as I ordered the white meat version."}
{"text":"Been a regular for 4 years now. I've always enjoyed their food. Friendly staff. It may be busy during lunch hours due to it being next to lvac, but nothing too crazy. Food is always good! They give decent portions and if you go to lvac make sure you tell them about your membership so you get s discount"}
{"text":"Solid healthy meal was enjoyed at this location. The large bowl was only $7 and the white meat chicken was very good quality and was plentiful. Needed an extra teriyaki sauce, but will get that next time. Could use more veggies, but overall a great choice."}
{"text":"My first visit to this location. My order  Rice with the teriyaki sauce, medium bowl. 
Rice wasn't filled as the other locations. Maybe they are following a standard, or could be giving less portions, so they would have to not make more through the rush hour. I found a hair, so out of being courteous I called and let them know about the dried rice, and the hair. The manager wasn't available, given the situation to be handled by a shift leader. His solution was, \"thank you for your concern\" no acknowledgment, and a phrase showing the customer some mutual understanding that this is a common problem. 
Definitely needs a couple of new staff members."}
{"text":"Had the low carb bowl. Chicken wasn't too dry and it was ok. I just ended up drenching the bowl in Sriracha and spicy teriyaki sauce. 

Place is just ok, nothing special about it"}
{"text":"$9 for their \"large\" yakisoba bowl.  Ridiculous small portions. Their large size is more like small size at other teriyaki places."}
{"text":"This place is great! Especially after working out. All the choices on their menu have great portions. They have brown rice!!:-) The workers give good service and are very friendly as well. I have to say, after a good work out, this'll be the one place I'll always eat at.

Low crab bowl!!"}
{"text":"I like coming here for lunch, quick and affordable the only thing I don't like about it is that they add TOO MUCH sauce in your bowl wether is a teriyaki bowl or a sweet and sour bowl it's just too much. I wish I knew they added this much sauce on their sweet and sour bowl so I could have asked for easy on the sauce."}
{"text":"Good enough for fast asian style food. Clean place with friendly staff. what the heck it is what it is and it is not horrible by any means. Fast, convenient, good price, and decent."}
{"text":"Always love this place! Always have a great healthy fast style meal. Veggies, white meat chicken and brown rice how can you go wrong. Also I love the yaki soba choice to for those noodle lovers"}
{"text":"I've spent years eating at teriyaki places. Being a military veteran there is usually several to choose from near a military base. This is easily the worst place ive ever eaten. The food is not good at all. I didn't even want to finish it. My veggies were cold. Not even slightly warm at all. The chicken was reheated not even cooked fresh. We had our food in our hands before we even finished paying. The chicken had that reheated taste were it was kind of mushy in my mouth. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Pretty decent for cheap Chinese food with tofu. I love the teriyaki bowl. It's really close to home so I go there rather than chipotle"}
{"text":"A lot better than Panda Express. Ordered the regular size dark meat chicken rice bowl and it was so good. I love the teriyaki suace and made sure to ask for extra! The regular size is a perfect portion to fill you up and they aren't skimpy on food. It's nice to find a clean, fast, and delicious teriyaki joint. We will be back."}
{"text":"Good food, good service! Found this beauty randomly after leaving my optometrist. 

Greeted nicely, and was fed fast!! Which is great when your starving!! 

The food was DELISH! I got the Korean BBQ Bowl and my gawwd it was good!! The flavor was on point! The chicken!! Oh god, the chicken. It was 100% all white chicken breast!! There was no fat/skin/fake chicken texture!! It was all 100% white protein baby! The brown rice was cooked perfectly!! 

Would def recommend trying this place out!"}
{"text":"If you are in the Las Vegas area off the strip and you're looking for a good alternative to fast food, then check this place out. The quality and price are far better than some of the other chains they compete with. I usually look for places that have good portions of meat, so if you want that order double meat. The price was still under $20 for two people with big appetites for protein."}
{"text":"I am on a no carb diet and one of the salads advertised on the menu in the restaurant and and the paper menus to go, having noodles. On a no carb diet, noodles are not allowed. I requested no noodles and proceeded to have 3 workers argue the salad did not come with a noodle. Even showing the menu to these workers didn't sway their opinion this salad didn't come with noodles. I finally walked away and went to Chipotle instead. Only to be stopped by 98.3 saying I should go into the restaurant. After suggesting the employees learn their own menu, the 98.3 person suggested the employees were saying I could take the noodles off giving them the benefit of the doubt.

I don't think, \"it doesn't come with noodles\" can be misinterpreted.

If you have a specific request avoid this place at all costs!!!!"}
{"text":"I wonder if I'm missing something?  For some reason, although Samurai Sam's is very close to my job, I always seemed to pass it by for no reason in particular.  However, yesterday they had balloons hanging and it looked festive, so I decided to stop by to see what was going on.

Apparently, Sam's was celebrating their anniversary, so every meal came with a free egg roll.  Okay, let's try it out! I got a chicken (dark) and veggie Yakisoba bowl along with my egg roll.  It was just okay. I felt that it was healthier than Panda Express, but I really didn't feel very satisfied. The noodles were a little dry, and there wasn't much sauce at all. The egg roll was okay, but a little on the small side. And all of this cost $7.19.  I didn't feel like it was really a great value for the money, unfortunately."}
{"text":"Went back and ordered the same thing from my prior review. 
Everything was the same..but the food was warmer. The taste was still not appetizing, and the portions are small. But you get 4 times the amount of rice/meat. I gave one more star for the effort. If I want chicken teriyaki, I'll either make it myself or go to L&L BBQ down the street."}
{"text":"This place is great. I will be coming here more often. It's very clean and the plus you can see them make your food, which is important. Food is bomb.com I dig."}
{"text":"I don't understand why there are so many negative reviews. This place has always been a go-to for me. Their food and prices are equally awesome. They now have \"combos\" where your entree, drink and an egg roll is included for only $7.99!! And, it's HEALTHY. Never once have I had a poor experience here. The portions are plentiful and the veggies are crisp; the chicken is never dry and the brown rice was perfection. I love the staff here. They are so warm & friendly. This is something that one rarely finds in Las Vegas. Keep in mind, this is a fast food diner, yet they grill their meat per order and it's always fresh. If you want a luxurious 5-star gourmet Asian meal, this obviously isn't the place for you!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty close to my job so every now and again I hit it up for lunch.  It is a little pricy but their salmon teriyaki bowl is awesome!  Their boba is OK but definitely overpriced.  I usually order to pick-up so it's faster.  Every time I talk to someone they are friendly and helpful, and it's a decent size with the tables spaced out well.  I have always had a good experience here.  =)"}
{"text":"Always have a great experience when I stop by, staff is extremely helpful and go out of their way to assure my picky confusing order is always right. Never a long line. Always super clean and well staffed. Highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I had dinner at Samurai Sams tonight and it was good. I had the Teriyaki Steak rice bowl and the meat was very good. The Vegetables were excellent and the rice also good. I will go back again."}
{"text":"I wanted more vegetables with the chicken teriyaki.  I got all carrots.  I had so much rice and so many carrots.  I told the guy that it had been awhile since I had been here it didn't say anything just looked at me.  I could here the Mexican music over the restaurant music.  Just won't be back to this one.  Explains why so empty.  My husband and I were both very un-impressed."}
{"text":"This place is so yummy! The service is so friendly and clean. I come here a lot during my lunch break. This place is definitely one of my favorites because it's a healthier alternative compared to the other restaurants. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"2nd time here. Was there today at about noon (22may2016). To begin with the guy at the register taking orders was very surly, as if we were bothering him by placing an order. Then when the order came I asked for some paprika for my order to which he responded 'I'll have to charge extra for that\" . I'll say at my regular Sam's the paprika and teriyaki sauce are with the other condiments-not hidden under the counter. I will NEVER go back to this location again. I'll stick with my regular Sam's!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this place a few times and wasn't crazy about it BUT then I had the Asian Chicken Tacos and it is all over. That is all I get and I am VERY happy about it...."}
{"text":"Was so disappointed.  This was the first time ordering for me and my son. I should have known something was wrong when it only took a couple minutes to get my food. Got home and my son bites into an egg roll and it's cold. Not warm but cold in the middle!!  Also our veggies with the teriyaki bowl weren't cooked either. It was like having a bowl full of raw veggies.  I'm sticking with teriyaki madness - they are consistently good and actually cook their food."}
{"text":"First time i've been in here it was for a take-away, and both me and we were quite satisfied with a food, an overall of maybe 3 stars and a half.
Second time I've been in here I chose the beef and rice bowl and two spring rolls!The bowl was quite Ok, again, but the spring roll was the softest spring roll I ever saw.So, asking about the state is in at the counter, first of all the guy was having an attitude , like how can I ask about this, why the roll was so soft and watery?
Seconfd of all, I asked for two, I paid for two and i got one!I presume the guy was too busy watching the football in the kitchen then to take care of the customers.
Now i'm not making a fuzz because of the thing that I paid for something and I got something else, it is all about the attitude!
There are just too many food joints around for me to ever go to this one again!
I don't want to get attitude for my money, that's it!
I don't care I paid more than I received , but receiving crap attitude instead of goodies is not Ok for me!
And also maybe the managers will have an eye on this guys as they're smoking(the staff) near the entrance door!
I might go on another Samurai joint but definitely I'm not coming back to this one!
Thank you for reading my review!"}
{"text":"Healthy teriyaki action. Naturally just by the name my first thought was going to be your basic teriyaki bowls chicken or beef. What I did find out was sure the menu is your standard fare teriyaki joint see in food courts or fast food type of teriyaki bowls. The quality of the food I felt was really good and made me fan!. Not only teriyaki bowls also have yakisoda bowls and even go with brown rice instead of white rice (not all places offer brown rice for substitute).. They even sell boba style drinks or thai tea. I love the diversity of the menu. The interior design another thing that love from the asian mural artwork along one whole wall. the asian lanterns hanging above for lighting, and enjoy the vibe of it. 

The food I ordered the yakudosha chicken and steak combo! Both the chicken and steak was cooked perfectly moist, hot, and enjoy the spicy seasoning on top (I recommend if like spicy food) the beef. The portion size for the protein is good size and the amount of vegetables love fact they not skimpy. It nice assortment of vegetables then typical more chain teriyaki joints. I had broccoli, cabbage, carrots, zucchini, and even cauliflower. All the vegetables was cooked perfect. The yakisoda noodles was again cooked perfection not over cooked noodles but just right. Every bite get great balance of all three. The egg roll that comes with the combo enjoy the fact it was not your typical deep fried egg roll. Instead they grill the egg roll. It taste lot better. Not as greasy. I liked it. Teriyaki sauce loved the fact that not over sweet but had some depth too the sauce. 

The prices are reasonable for under ten dollars get teriyaki bowl with egg roll plus drink. One that am sure will be taking advantage of....."}
{"text":"Way over priced for the quality of food. I paid 24 bucks for two rice bowls and a drink."}
{"text":"We always come to this Samurai Sam's even though there's another one closer to our home. The food is always fresh and our order is always perfect. Plus, they have really good smoothies!"}
{"text":"I prefer the other Samurai Sam's in Village Center but when I don't feel like driving I end up at this location as it's closer to home. The quality is not as good as the other location (rice is sometimes mushy or hard) but it's convenient."}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today and was very disappointed. Staff was not very friendly. My teriyaki chicken bowl had almost no sauce. The vegetables and chicken were also very scarce."}
{"text":"This place is ok for lunch. You can get a \"large\" chicken teriyaki bowl for about 5 bucks and some change. 50 cent extra for white meat and 25 cents extra for brown rice. The bowls come with chicken and mixed vegetables on a bed of rice. Everything looks like it's steamed with a little bit of teriyaki sauce on top. The large bowl was a joke, came out not even completely full and there wasn't much meat, but hey it was only 5 bucks. The food was decent overall but I was hungry again in about 3 hrs before I even got off work. I would only come here again if I needed a light snack and not an actual lunch."}
{"text":"So here's the deal. I gave my friend money to purchase me food for lunch. I had her order the steak and shrimp with veggie bowl for me. When she returns to work I realize they gave me chicken and shrimp. It's an inconvenience to drive there and get a new bowl, but not a big deal as I work about 3 miles from here. They give me a new bowl with steak and shrimp and I go back to work. As I get back and start to eat, I find a small black hair!! Gross, but it was solely on a piece of shrimp so I threw it away and the food surrounding it. I continued to eat and then found another hair..... I have obviously lost my appetite... I call them and they apologize and tell me they will refund me. I drive back there and wait in line to return my food. As I'm doing so an employee goes to refill a soy sauce bottle and drops the top into a box on the ground. The employee then proceeds to put the top back on the bottle unwashed. This last act is what prompted me to write the review. Unfortunately I will not be eating here again.... 
I will add I did get refunded."}
{"text":"Back in the days when I was an Executive Assistant, one of my jobs was picking up food from Samurai Sam's for one of my more health conscious execs - so I would occasionally pick something up for myself. I found the food fresh and tasty.

Years, and many jobs later, we found ourselves starving mid-day and were passing this area by.  My husband had never been, so we popped in to grab something quick.  I got the veggie bowl with brown rice.  It was just OK - not as good as I remember.  Kind of tasted \"too healthy\" with not enough deep sauce flavors.

I have to say - the best thing about this place was the staff.  The girl that took our order was happily singing along to \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and evangelizing about the greatness of Queen.  The entire staff obviously got along and were enjoying working there together - not something I expect from a casual FF joint. That wins an additional star from me immediately."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place as an alternative to Teriyaki Madness as we live closer to this location.  I walked in and was greeted by an individual who was unkempt and had a lot of hair with no hair net.  He was very friendly and personable though, so that prevented me from walking out of the store.  When I placed my order, I then witness the server start to prepare my food.  I say prepare because all of the ingredients were already cooked and the process of putting them together and stir frying them on the grill was the biggest effort.  It took the server quite a long time to heat my order.  When I brought the order home, my wife and I looked at each other and vowed to drive the longer distance to Teriyaki Madness next time.  The beef bowls were bland and the quantity was far from generous.  I was not impressed."}
{"text":"Staff was nice, but don't waste your money. Almost $20 for two tasteless, lackluster rice bowls. Do yourself a favor and buy veggies and chicken from Albertson's; it will be cheaper and healthier to make your own. People keep talking about the sauce here but it's just regular teriyaki sauce. Small portions that aren't worth the price."}
{"text":"I have gone to this place ever since they open but keep forgetting to write a review. 

Anyways samurai sams doesn't disappoint. It's an adequate price for lunch and you are satisfied. It's not gourmet it's still fast food but a lot better and healthier options. I usually go for the regular chicken bowl. It never disappoints, its delicious.

But today I tried their Asian tacos; they have this taco Tuesday special for $3. 3 tacos with chicken n veggies on top of rice with a special spicy sauce, and man was it good. And only $3, I would have paid a lot more for that.

This location also serves as a Blimpie subs and another restaurant I could never remember. Very fresh food."}
{"text":"Food is ok here but the spicy is way too spicy for my taste. I usually really like spicy stuff but this made my mouth fire up. I do think that the chicken and beef items are really good here and the sauce isn't too sweet. I'm also not a big fan of veggies but they taste good here because they are very soft. 
This place is good for a quick stop and it's always filling. Just be careful with the spicy sauce!"}
{"text":"Horrible! Everything on the menu was unavailable!! They advertise everything they don't have. It is just ridiculous. They have several signs up for \"General Sam's\" which she told my friend was not sold anymore?? Maybe take down the sign? My friend also got Jasmine tea from their fountain drinks and literally water came out. He also ordered large and got a small. Then I ordered a veggie bowl and wanted a side salad, she said they were out of salad and then proceeded to tell me they haven't had orders for their stock. I think they need new management. I am very upset with all of this. I do not recommend coming here!!!! She woman was horrible!!!!"}
{"text":"If you're craving a Teriyaki bowl, the Samurai Sam's is your place.
Fast.  Cheap.  Tasty.  
You can't beat that with two (chop) sticks!

Try the spicy chicken bowl (my preference is dark meat, no veggies, and white rice).

The people working at this location are the best.  You'll get greeted with a cheery \"How are you my friend?\" and a big smile.  

(and for those of you complaining the prices have been going up...check the other restaurants around town - that $10 minimum wage is raising prices everywhere...and it's going to go up again in January - don't blame the restaurant!)"}
{"text":"I wonder where the health department is for this location. Person wearing the gloves, touches your food, then without removing gloves, uses the scraper to clean grill, then touches your food, then scratches his head, then touches food....get the idea? BTW order was wrong and there was so much water/liquid dripping from the wrap (at least 2-3 oz), and veggies under cooked. This location has gone down hill over the years. Too bad"}
{"text":"Average at best. Food is not that good and the customer experience is not good. Would not go back anytime soon"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick dinner. They messed up our order 3 times and we eventually ended up paying for food we did not order. The food was good however the service was horrible as we tried to correct our order and they could not get it right. The cashier became frustrated with us as we did with them. Food was good and came out quickly, however customer service was not friendly."}
{"text":"Was craving Teriyaki chicken with white meat and brown rice....for some reason that's hard to find. I was so happy to find a Samurai Sams some what by the house. Its near an industrial area so its hard to see it...use ur gps or keep your eyes open. Food was great though and fast. Not so fast though that you knew they \"warmed up you chicken in the microwave\" fast though. It was cooked to order. The gal at the counter was great too. Very friendly! Always a plus. So food and service are great. Ill go back!"}
{"text":"I've spent years eating at teriyaki places. Being a military veteran there is usually several to choose from near a military base. This is easily the worst place I've ever eaten. The food is not good at all. I didn't even want to finish it. My veggies were cold. Not even slightly warm at all. The chicken was reheated not even cooked fresh. We had our food in our hands before we even finished paying. The chicken had that reheated taste were it was kind of mushy in my mouth. I will never go back."}
{"text":"Horrible service! They young man who took our order and money was so rude and completely uninterested in his job and it showed! My sister and I always order both chow mien and rice in our bowl with steak and chicken and this young man swore that that was not allowed due to policy! Did it change in a week because I got the same thing from someone else earlier on the week! So frustrated my sister didn't even eat she was so hungry and upset she burst in to tears as soon as we got in the car! Not to mention the area where you order looked like it had been wiped down with a dirt dish rage, the drink station was also a mess we won't be back to this location that's for sure!"}
{"text":"I love Samurai Sam's especially the sumo bowl. The egg rolls are not great, I guess because they grill them."}
{"text":"Ordered the soba noodles and vegetables...they do not know what soba noodles are...I got ramen noodles/not cooked enough/too much sauce on it and not even a palm full of vegetables...will never go back ."}
{"text":"So good!! Had not heard of this place, stopped by for lunch and was not disappointed at all! By far the best terriyaki bowl I've had anywhere in Phoenix! Awesome food and friendly service as well. Will definitely be back for more! I had the Yaki Soba Bowl with chicken and steak, highly recommend!"}
{"text":"They have cheapen up the quality of chicken. It is rubbery and the texture is unappetizing. Nice people, but I no longer prefer the food."}
{"text":"Ordered for takeout and was very pleased with the quality of the food when I got home. Food tasted really fresh even after 30 mins. The chicken and teriyaki bowl was delicious and veggies were so fresh. Price is not bad too! Will definitely be back!r"}
{"text":"I went here for lunch last week. When I walked in the place was empty except for a lady behind the counter and a little boy about twelve. The little boy went behind the counter while I was ordering, and the lady proceeded to ask him to grab my egg role. He then proceeded to help her get the rest of my food. Needless to say I was a little grossed out. Apparently someone has never heard of food handler cards and that children are not to be in the kitchen much less handling the food. The food is decent but too often I go into these places and find workers sitting on the counter, talking on their phones while handling food etc. It's pretty gross. I'm told they don't have a c corporate number but someone definitely needs some retraining on handling food."}
{"text":"The food was very fresh. First time I've ever been here. The food is really good. The workers are blah. Not the most enthusiastic. But will only come back for the food, not the workers. Lol."}
{"text":"I made a trip up to Phoenix from Tucson yesterday just because. We were hungry when we got there and remembered seeing this place across the parking lot from another restaurant we'd gone to before. This time though, we were with our two infants and just wanted somewhere we could bring them in after a long trip and wouldn't bother anyone around us. 

Thankfully, this place was empty except for the guy working there and two people he seemed to be friends with who were watching a football game. The employee was very friendly and even asked questions about my son's helmet (he knows another child who wears one). Our food was out literally as we were filling our drinks after ordering. I definitely appreciated the speed since, again, we were looking for something quick. 

The only downside, and perhaps this is our fault, we were sitting under a loud football game on TV. The place was literally empty so we could have sat anywhere, but it's also small so regardless we were bound to hear the game. Not a big deal at all though. I'm sure we'll be back since I don't think we have this chain in Tucson. Plus, my 10-month old loved the food too. To be fair, he also tries to eat socks, but he was gobbling up bites of vegetables and rice without so much as a sour face about it. :)"}
{"text":"Samurai Sam's tries hard at creating some Asian inspired food

The three of us came here last week, each ordering something different. I had three chicken tacos which were good, but had virtually no meat. As you can see from the photos, it's hard to find any. Lots of veggies though.

As for my friends, they each ordered different types of teriyaki bowls. Both came with a lot of rice, but again not much else.

Sadly, you can get  nearly twice as much food at Panda Express.  It's hard to justify coming back, our bill came to $24.70, including two soft drinks and one water. So, Two Stars and yes, we have had better.

Sorry!"}
{"text":"I just want to say thank you to the young man working today .  I work in the mall and had an employee call out so I was unable to pick up my lunch . Not only did this young man take my phone order but he brought it over to me free of charge and was so nice and quick , thank you for your great food and service !!! I will be back soon it was great"}
{"text":"For a little fast food place, not too bad.  I won't order meat at these kinds of places as it would terrify me to know where they get it, so I ordered the veggie teriyaki wrap with brown rice.  Umm, you really need to tell people they are paying extra for brown rice instead of just asking white or brown.  Other than that, a good wrap and nicely sized - not so gargantuan that you feel sick afterwards."}
{"text":"You want a healthy nutritious choice of macros? This beauty is located across of LVAC. Made to order and they cook your food right in front so you can see what goes in. Staff is great, restaurant was super clean, and the only downfall was ordering the sauce. Should have had on the side. Chef diced mines with the sauce but that was the flavoring that made it out of this world   Ordered an extra 4oz of steak cause the original plate only comes with 4oz. I'm a small boy and I need to grow Rating 9.5/10"}
{"text":"Great place to get a good brown rice and veggie chicken bowl"}
{"text":"I go to this location very often. Their food is cooked fresh and is consistent. The employees always greet you with a smile and are very warm. My favorite part of this restaurant is the smell of fresh chicken being cooked. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"There is nothin like being starving and being brought home muck.. how do you specialize in bowls!? Vegatables are raw and brown rice is mosh I am hangryyyyyy!!!!"}
{"text":"I probably hit one of these chains once or twice a month, especially after the gym because the food is healthy for being considered fast food. This location in Henderson is never busy when I go, which is interesting because it is located in a high traffic area. The benefit to this is that service has always been fast. The customer service is excellent and the restaurant is always very clean. 

Some of the platters I've ordered here include the steak & chicken bowl with soba noodles, beef with brown rice bowl and the salmon bowl. Also, I've enjoyed the white meat chicken breast veggie rice bowl. But my overall favorite item is getting the beef with soba noodles."}
{"text":"Tried the grilled egg roll with a chicken dish. It wasn't bad at all. I really liked the passion fruit tea. The place looked a little dirty like a rush had just happened but wasn't busy when we walked in. Staff was nice. Would come here again."}
{"text":"As I walked in to place my order I noticed gnats flying around the register (OK GROSS! I should've walked out then), the woman that took my order was very rude (sighing, rolling eyes, etc), my order was wrong and I was charged for something I did not receive. 

If you really want to try Samurai Sam's I would NOT try this location."}
{"text":"I ordered the chicken rice bowl.  The veggies were limp and obviously frozen.  Chicken was also pre-grilled and just dunked in sauce before service and probably reheated in a microwave.  Rice was okay but nothing spectacular.   Also, they didn't keep siracha out, I had to ask for some and they gave me some in a small container.  I'll won't be returning."}
{"text":"The is food good and they have fast service.The staff is always friendly to all the customers. Dinning in is always an option for us since it is clean place and well kept.

They have good prices especially if you are in their texting program you get even better deals on a regular basis."}
{"text":"healthy food!!!! i get their lowcarb plate which is veggies and choice of meat. and if i dont feel like eating healthy i get yakisoba with choice of meat. they normally heavy the teriyaki sauce so i always ask for it on the side. service is great, food is great, location is great. but i stopped by recently and saw they were closed due to ownerships so i really hope they don't close down!"}
{"text":"We got there at 830 and they didn't want to cook anything because they were \"almost closed\" 
Obnoxious. I ordered smoothie and they \"didn't have enough people \" event though there were five people there. 
They didn't want to wash their machine again. 
Rude don't go here"}
{"text":"My coworkers and I ordered from this restaurant through the Eat24 app because it was free delivery to our job. Ordering online was easy, but when we received our order, it was riddled with errors (no sauce, missing chicken, missing drinks, incorrect veggies, etc.), the 9 bowls ordered weren't labeled as requested, and the food just was not very good.

I immediately called the restaurant and spoke to an unhelpful employee. She claimed that she did not see my specifications for each order (even though my order summary was very clear). After some convincing, she gave me the manager's number, who did not pick up right away. I had to call them through the customer service line using Eat24 app. When I eventually did get a hold of the manager, she said she was not informed by her employees of the situation. She was apologetic, but only refunded me two bowls and two drinks. I honestly think the inconvenience and the taste of the food was worth more than this, but at this point, I was just done. Therefore, I would never eat here again.

If you just have to have Samurai Sam's (the Grand Canyon location is good), I recommend ordering from a different restaurant. I also do not recommend ordering from this location through the Eat24 app. I would have given one star, but I'm only giving a second star due to the fact that none of us have fallen ill (yet)."}
{"text":"Wow... Even with my BOGO coupon, this food was horrendous. I'm not even joking and not that you thought I was. Please save your time and do not stop here. The chicken was dry and their rice tasted like hard white pellets. The veggies were okay. They do give you extra teriyaki sauce and now I know why, so the chicken would have some sort of taste!

There might be other Samurai Sam's locations that are good, but this specific store is a no go!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to this place for about a year and I don't have any real complaints. Their food is good and the service is always fast. This place is a terriakyi fast food! If you know this before you go in, you will be happy. 

The food: I have ordered almost everything from their menu at one point, but my favorite is just a steak bowl. The meat is always great tasting and I love the vegetables they add in the food. JUST A TIP, order the small portion. It's cheaper and has the same amount of food. The larger size is just in a bigger container. Besides this, the food is always satisfying. 

The drinks: they do sell boba and milk tea here, and it's very mediocre. I am a boba and milk tea snob, so I judge very critically about this. It is good here, but I rarely get my milk tea or boba from here. 

The service: I have never had to wait more than 5 min for food here. The workers are always polite and fast. I have been here with 10 people in the store and also while it's empty, both times it was relatively fast. 

I come here about 1-2 times a month. I will continue to come back!"}
{"text":"The staff is super unfriendly and they close an hour earlier than the time they're supposed to close (for example: they close at 8 pm when the sign says they close at 9 pm) and they don't even open the door for you and apologize, they just sit around and stare at you."}
{"text":"Steve and Alex are awesome. High quality customer service and even better food!

Get the steak bowl!!"}
{"text":"Really good food that is fast and healthy.  I normally get the chicken, rice-less, with extra veggies and the spicy sauce.  The food is always hot and is just the right amount.  The people here are nice as well!  It is a great alternative!"}
{"text":"I've always liked this place for what's available over here. Considering the type of restaurant it is, the food is plenty good. The bowls are a good price for the amount you get. The employees are always nice enough and the service is quick. I've never had a bad experience with anything here."}
{"text":"I in general really like Samurai Sam's restaurants for their healthy meals. This location is, however, terrible. Wait time is really long - often 30 min instead of promised 10, once in a while screwed up orders. But I would still come there occasionally after my work outs at LVAC. This time, however, made me really pissed off. I'm not ever going back to this location (unless management and staff will be changed!). I've ordered 4 different teriyaki bowls for my family to go. Not only I had to wait for over 30 min (kitchen staff worked so slow, no multitasking whatsoever!), when I got home I've discovered that they've screwed up all 4 bowls. I immediately called them, but instead of a apology and acknowledging it, lady servicing me (\"Emmy P.\") was rude and said that they can't do anything about it. I had to dump 2 of the bowls, as my kids refused eating it not the way was ordered :(((( Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Ok

Don't have their \"grilled\" eggrolls or crabpuffs
They're soggy and floppy and just soooooooooo gross.
Seriously.  Don't.

Their chicken bowls are pretty good though!  I would prefer their spicy teriyaki sauce to be less sugary... but it was definitely edible."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good just very greasy but over overall it was tasty not bad for 5$ ofc"}
{"text":"They had a grand reopening today. Big specials. I'm here for the eegees. Tucson is too far to get eegees. I wasn't impressed with the teriyaki chicken today,  but most days it's alright. Meh."}
{"text":"This kind of food is awesome! The teriyaki bowl with veggies is the best choice. So tasty! The staff is very friendly and helpful... totally worth the place to stop and eat..."}
{"text":"This Samurai Sams is a franchise, and is a shame to the name. Every time I go in there the tables ane dirty and a bunch of girls are in the back giggling and \"hanging out\". Placing the order is easy but expect to starve to death once you wait so long for very mediocre food. My food is never all the way hot. Stick to company owned Samurai Sams, they are much more strict about management and cleanliness!"}
{"text":"The Asian clown behind the counter is a condescending a-hole. The dude has a bad attitude and seems like he not only hates his job but hates life itself. Everything he says is forced. Perhaps he shouldn't take his anger issues out on paying customers. He also made it a point to give customers their orders first who clearly ordered after me. Dude mad dogging everybody just isn't good for business."}
{"text":"They are always friendly.  The food is always ready fast and they never mess up my order even when it is a large order for myself and fellow coworkers.  I love the their sauce and I love that they expanded their menu."}
{"text":"I was really impressed with our first visit to this Samurai Sam's. 

We came here on a Wednesday night and were originally going to go to Panda Express next door, but it was packed to the gills and we were on somewhat of a schedule. Samurai Sam's was near empty, but we were greeted promptly by the young kid who was working. Initially, we were going to order just two teriyaki bowls and two drinks, but the nice kid working there told us of the special they had going on; 2 teriyaki bowls, 2 side salads, and 2 regular drinks for $10.99. In my opinion this was a slammin' deal because just the two teriyaki bowls by themselves would have been around $14 after tax. I was really grateful, because all in all, he saved us a relatively large amount of money considering what we were getting- plus we got two side salads! 

Anyhow, the food came out in maybe five minutes which was nice. They have a variety of condiment packets (both regular and low sodium soy sauce, which was a plus), spicy mustard, and even sweet and sour, which was nice as well. The salads were fresh and served with sides of a sesame-style dressing which was lite and good. The teriyaki chicken was similar to that of any other teriyaki place. It wasn't charred nor was it unbearably chewy. The veggies served with the bowl were okay. The mix was mostly composed of steamed zucchini, which is probably why I didn't really care for it. I would prefer if it had more cabbage or broccoli, but honestly it wasn't that big of a deal. The rice was good as well. It was typical of what you would find at other teriyaki places. I would most definitely return, especially because of the customer service. The young kid, I think his name was Kobi from the receipt, was really nice, saved us some money, and was professional."}
{"text":"I got the steak and broccoli bowl and it was very delicious. My friend and I tried it for the first time and we had a great experience. I can't wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Just has a chicken brown rice bowl for the first time. It was so good and the service was fantastic! I may go back for dinner!"}
{"text":"I can't honestly understand why Teriyaki Madness seems to be more popular than this place. Samurai Sam's is cheaper, faster, and tastes better. They're priced reasonably even with the extra charges ($.25 here and there for white meat chicken instead of dark, brown rice instead of white, etc). If you like TM, you will probably like SS; and I would like to hope you'll like it better. 

The staff is above average. They great you politely, take your order, and that's about it; professional and minimal conversation is a nice plus for an introverted soul such as myself who doesn't need customer service chit-chat with every transaction I make. I keep it simple every time: large white meat chicken teriyaki bowl with brown rice and a little bit of both sauces (spicy and regular) has yet to disappoint in any way. For about $8 for a full meal with drink and grilled egg roll you'll leave satisfied."}
{"text":"As other reviews pointed out the teriyaki really pulled everything together. The spicy teriyaki is what I preferred. I went with a friend so we tried the dark chicken, steak, and salmon. Chicken was our favorite."}
{"text":"Samurai Sam's is a very friendly environment and the staff is helpful!

I ordered a grilled chicken egg roll and two steak wraps with brown rice and no sauce. They did not have wheat wrap, so I asked to just have it in a bowl. That was no problem for them. When the order was ready, the one individual gave me a second grilled chicken egg roll for the \"long\" wait. I think I must have waited 15 minutes.

I am very pleased with the service considering there was only one employee working at the time."}
{"text":"Don't call ahead, they won't make it until you get there, after waiting in line 10 minutes just to tell them you pre-ordered, again, only to get a blank stare, and sorry it will be right up. If you ask for sauce on the side you get a double tablespoon shot glass of it, barely enough. Only positive thing this place has going for it is they run 2 registers at mid day because the Washington location is in the middle of a massive \"business park\". The Haiku Grill is right across the street from me and twice as good and the food is waiting when you walk up to the cashier, I won't go to Sams again."}
{"text":"I tried Samurai Sam's about 10 years ago and never went back.  Just bland Teriyaki and stale vegetables and rice. Today I couldn't think of any place to eat and decided to give it another shot. Completely regretted my decision before I even paid and after first bite of chicken and first sip of Thai Tea confirmed what I always thought about the place. I won't be back in 10, 20 or even 30 years."}
{"text":"The food here is great and healthy I love the food the workers are awesome and polite the teriyaki sauce is great I always ask for extra definitely recommend even after a work out its so healthy I recommend the spicy pepper steak or a large steak yaki"}
{"text":"What I love about this quaint restaurant on the edge  of the south Las Vegas Outlets parking lot is the speed in which you get your freshly made meals. Seems like the moment you finish paying, your order (carry-out or pickup) is being handed to you. I just ordered a Sumo Bowl (awesome chunks of both chicken and steak) with brown rice ($9.99 plus $.25), and a low carb bowl (basically veggies and meat, no rice) with steak ($7.90). Literally I have not finished typing this review and my food is ready!!!! Did I mention the meat is tender and juicy?!? And veggies are always crisp and soggy"}
{"text":"My wife and I wanted something away from the casinos and found this place. The teriyaki bowls were very good and light meal. The price was affordable and the place was clean with very good and quick service. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I went with the large orange peel bowl on Brown rice and a side of crab puffs. The crab puffs were perfect and the they give you the option of all white or dark meat with your meal. 

The lady at the register was nice and friendly. She helped me save a few bucks by recommending that i go with the combo as opposed to buying my items separately. They have plenty of space here so when you come to eat you want have to worry about sitting on top of each other. Plus the location is perfect."}
{"text":"The service is really fast here. The food smelled really good. Taco Tuesday got me 3 tacos for 3 bucks (That's an amazing deal ). They come in chicken white meat, chicken dark meat, or steak and it comes with rice. That alone was enough to fill me up for lunch. 

The eating area is small but clean. I like eating outside and their seating here is really clean outside. There's enough space for about 10 folks to hangout if your party is that large."}
{"text":"I love this place better than the competitor.  You know that place that rhymes with Meriyaki Ladness.  I live close to here and frequent most of the nearby restaurants.  They had a special going on for a $5 chicken bowl.  You can't beat that.  I like this place because you don't have to pay extra for vegetables.  I think that's insane to have to pay extra to make it how it should be served.  So kudos for the Samurai for making it happen.  I took a little long to get the bowls I ordered but it was also a Sunday afternoon and a packed restaurant.  If you are in the area check this place out. Good food at a good price! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food, tge vegetables are very crispy which I love! Shows they aren't over cooked and drenched in sauce!

The only downside is the place is small so during the lunch rush there isn't too much room and it gets awkward trying to eat while someone is standing next to you and watching you eat.

The staff is friendly and efficient. The food can be made healthy.  I think its way better tasting than panda."}
{"text":"Excellent place for quality fresh food. Everyone that works here is friendly and they like to know there customers. I usually eat the yaki soba bowl with chicken or shrimp. All Samurai Sams are not the same. This one seems to have bigger portions of meat. They are what i would call healthy fast food. Fair prices especially for the portions."}
{"text":"There's a specific reason why I am submitting a review of another chain. Samurai Sam's is close to work for me, but more importantly, the menu features more healthy options than the average fast food joint. This is important to me because I am still on my New Years diet.

Frankly, I've eaten at this location several times over the last couple years, and I've never walked away regretting my lunch. The variety includes an all vegetable bowl to brown rice options and of course, the proverbial egg roll. Not to mention the variety of limited time menu items, such as my most recent selection.

Me and a colleague stopped in for lunch this week and right away, the promo photo for General Sam's Chicken Bowl caught my eye. In fact, my photo (below) of the entree shows how appetizing this choice is. Plus, the sweet and spicy sauce sealed the deal. I requested brown rice and enjoyed every bite. Ask yourself this. When was the last time you saw snap peas in a fast food restaurant?

The only down side to this location is the very crowded parking lot at lunch time. It feels narrow and there doesn't seem to be enough parking. If that's the case. You can always find room on 48th Street.

Bottom line, the menu is always pretty tasty. And the only way to make it any healthier would involve walking to the restaurant."}
{"text":"It's required I leave a star in order to post my review but trust me when I say if I didn't have to leave one I wouldn't...

Stopped in to get a bowl cause I remembered back in the day this place use to be pretty good. Anyway, I ordered the spicy steak and broccoli bowl with white rice to go.  As I'm driving home I start to take a few bites.  By the third bite I noticed that there was a hair in my food.  By this time I'm grossed out and I call the restaurant to let them know what happened.  

The manager tells me that they would replace the bowl and all I would need to do was give up my name when I came back.

Speed it up to today, I'm in the area and I decided to stop in.  I look at the sign and I'm like cool I still got 20 minutes.  I'm waiting at the counter for someone to come to the front.  I say excuse me a couple of times but still no acknowledgement.

After about seven minutes the cashier finally comes to take my order.  I explain that I should have a credit due to the hair in my food incident.  She looks in the computer and tells me that she can't find a credit. Slides me a pen and receipt paper to write down my name and number and proceeds to say the manager would call me when she finds the credit! WTF!!! 

Customer service and courtesy is something they obviously don't practice.  

I'll never patronize this place again!!!"}
{"text":"I have been to numerous samaurai sams before and find this location to be the worst. Something seemed off with my entire meal. Chicken had tons of fat in it, noodles were slimy and flavor was non existent. Customer service was non existent. I will not return to this location."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Who is the asshole giving it good reviews?

Bland, generic awful placid semi-food. How do you manage to ruin shrimp?"}
{"text":"This place didn't quite, cut it. Get it, Samurai swords and they cut stuff...and...um, oh boy. 

Anyway, this place was option three on my quest to get some type of Teriyaki food in my belly. Sadly, the first two places were jam packed and this third option was on the way to some of my errands. First red flag, the place is empty on a Saturday afternoon during snacking time and they're right next door to a major shopping area. Second red flag, three stars on Yelp. \"Hmmm, let's eat\", my stomach took over my brain at this point and the next thing I know I was at the counter ordering. 

\"I'll have the Spicy Steak and Broccoli Bowl w/ an egg roll.\" What seemed like three seconds later, \"order up!\" and boom my plate had arrived. This dish visually was not super appealing and did not even come close to the picture on the menu; it also looked very dark and almost burnt. That old saying looks can be deceiving, well in this case they weren't, the steak was over-cooked and the rice tasted like it had been sitting for awhile. This dish got better once I smothered it in Sriracha and some extra teriyaki sauce. The broccoli was actually cooked well and tasted fresh, which besides the extra sauces, is what probably saved this dish. 

The egg rolls here are very interesting. Normally egg rolls are filled with veggies or meat or both and fried. Theses were stuffed, fried and then toasted? I'm not sure if they did this to heat them up or keep them crispy, but they just came out burnt and tasting bitter. The Samurai food gods would be displeased with such disrespect for the egg roll. 

This was almost a two star rating, but this place is very clean and the customer service here is quick and helpful. I might give another location a second chance."}
{"text":"Went in today for lunch and was told there would be a wait which I was ok with, but after i waited a long while I asked how much longer it would be and was told it was gonna be a little while longer cause they only had one stove working. It was ridiculous how long I had to wait and I barely even had enough time to taste it before I had to be back at work."}
{"text":"Very good teriyaki chicken bowl. The price is right and its a nice little spot if your looking for something quick and decent"}
{"text":"If you want a straight up Teriyaki bowl, this is your place. Everything is cooked well. Fresh veggies and tasty meat. Their teriyaki sauce is on point, a bit on the sweet side which I like. The only reason I don't give it a 5 is that the inside doesn't appear very cleanly so not sure how carful they are with their food. Fact of the matter is this, if you want a teriyaki bowl, this place won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Samurai Sam's would have gotten a 4 or a 5 star review, as the food is actually pretty consistent, flavorful, fairly healthy and at a good price point.

The issue I very often find, is that there is a HARD up sell at the register.  

At the register and outside the building on banners, they advertise a $5 bowl of dark meat chicken, white rice and veggies.   It's very clear what comes in that dish.  What happens nearly every time I go, is that the person at the register attempts the up sell, asking you if you want to add white meat chicken, steak, brown rice, noodles, extra spice, etc.  Each of which come at an additional charge.  Choosing these options push a $5 bowl up to the $10+ range.  Mind you, the menu has all of these options is other dishes available at their respective price points.

When a customer doesn't know this, they are caught off guard by the price, yet often times don't protest or even mention it.  I witnessed this twice in this location today.

When I order and clearly state: \"I'd like a $5 bowl, as it comes, with dark meat and white rice\" that is exactly what I desire.  Why the additional hard up sell?  

This aspect makes it hard to keep coming back."}
{"text":"This place is decent however lacks cleanliness which is concern for me when I want to dine in. Food is good I had their teriyaki rice bowl and their ultimate meat bowl which was also pretty good.  I think Yogis on Camelback j's the best rice bowl place in the valley though."}
{"text":"Whatever you do don't eat here !!!! After I pay $25 for my friend and I ... not only  did they screw it up but they wouldn't even fix it and the lady at the cashier was argumentative didn't want to make things right and on top of that I tip them for customer service that was actually terrible they couldn't even make my order right what a joke !!!! It used to be my favorite spot but not anymore!! They really need to train their employees on customer service because you're not getting good customer service here!!!"}
{"text":"Food was fantastic and fast! Dining area has nice atmosphere and the service was great!"}
{"text":"I'm just not into food that tastes like plastic. It was a cheap experience overall, but the food is not good."}
{"text":"New ownership has really bought back this quick high quality healthy meal restaurant. The quality has been very consistent and the service has been amazingly good with the change back to a family owned business. They offer a much healthier alternative to the standard fast food places. The Asian tacos are  sprightly tasty."}
{"text":"This Time ,,, Not So Good 

I have always had a high-quality, hot meal that tastes great at Samurai Sam's. The staff is always friendly and you're greeted the minute you walk in the door.  However, today I was very disappointed in the quality of the food.

I ordered a Steak Yakisoba Bowl, pot stickers, and drink. After placing my order I was handed a cup so I headed over to the soft drinks, and even before I poured my drink the cashier put my tray on the counter and told me my meal was ready. I grabbed my tray and headed for my table.  After taking just one took bite I realized my meal wasn't hot, it couldn't even be considered warm.  So I brought my dish back up to the counter, where the cashier apologized and advised she would get me a new \"hot\" dish.

A few minutes later my meal was replaced and it was very hot (smoking to be exact), it was also very tasteless. The vegetables, a mix of cabbage, broccoli and carrots had no flavor whatsoever and the steak was so dry and overcooked from being re-heated that it was impossible to eat.  The potstickers were terrible, they were hard, dry, and over cooked.   This was the first time that I ate very little and was not able  to finish what I ordered even tho I was hungry... I just couldn't do it."}
{"text":"Ok food for lunch. Smells funny in there thou."}
{"text":"Chicken over yakisoba is incredible. Great for lunch or dinner. Sharing our big appetite, try a sumo bowl. Then walk over to yogurtology for some butterfinger crunch!"}
{"text":"Great and fast Asian bowls. I got spicy beef and broccoli. It's spicy and the steak is REAL! A must try. Far better than Panda Express!"}
{"text":"If I lived closer, I would eat here multiple times per week! This place is the truth!!

The chicken bowls are excellent, regardless of whether or not you do white or dark meat. HOWEVER, the steak dishes are THE BEST things on the menu...strictly because of the quality of the steak. Most teriyaki joint use reconstituted shoe leather for their steak dishes (or at least it seems that way based on how tough that \"steak\" usually is!). Samurai Sam's uses true steak (flank steak if I had to wager a guess) and its honestly cooked to perfection! It's thick cut and extremely flavorful. 

Spicy Steak and Pepper Bowl is my go to but any combo of meat, veggies, rice and sauce is going to be a winner. 

Pot stickers are great, egg rolls are not bad and price is definitely right. 

The staff is almost always very friendly and the place is cleaned and maintained very well. Call ahead pick up orders are the way I usually do it and the buy 9 get one free punch card is a must.

ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Service was friendly and attentive. Restaurant was clean. Forgettable Asian American food though. Steak was dried out like jerky. Chicken was soggy. Egg rolls and noodles were good. Veggies were also fresh and crisp. Good spot for vegetarians ."}
{"text":"Simple, healthy, inexpensive.

Come here if you like the above + teriyaki.

Also come here if you lift heavy weights. This is where bodybuilders hang out."}
{"text":"Good not great. The teriyaki sauce is good, as is the tempura, The quality of meat in the teriyaki is the reason I gave it a 3 instead of 4."}
{"text":"I love eating here and stop by almost every time I get my nails done.  Their specialty is their teriyaki chicken bowl.  I would suggest adding extra teriyaki as the rice can be a little dry at times. Usually the brown rice.  They are usually quick and the guy that works the cash register is always friendly and nice."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. It's inexpensive, short wait for food, and absolutely delicious and healthy!!
Standard chicken teriyaki bowls is their claim to fame. But wait, there's more. I get the Quinoa brown rice bowl, and add avocado. There's perfectly cooked chicken, steamed veggies, and I get no sauce. It's filling, it's yummy, and it's consistent. Punch cards avail for frequent customers. 
Service is very friendly. I'm recovering from an injury and have been here a few times in the past 2 months and the staff even noticed when I didn't bring my walker in. 
I look forward to returning and trying a yakisoba bowl with shrimp or salmon. I
Also like the grilled egg rolls.
China mist tea, 1 original and 1 flavor is available, one of my restaurant favorites."}
{"text":"Very over priced. Chicken bowl wasnt good at all had a better chicken bowl from the frozen food section.   Egg roll soggy and very salty
Over paid amd hopefully i dont end up with frequen trips to the bathroom or food poisoning...."}
{"text":"It always intrigues me when there are reviews of any establishment or event that can be so opposite of each other. Lots of things factor in of course. But you'll see that for this place and many other businesses. Each one has a story behind it. My story this time is that I was hugely disappointed. I've tried at least one other location of this place in the past few years. I don't remember being this dismayed. Very poor interaction from the employees. Seemed bored. Asked for the chicken breast rice bowl and was asked it i wanted dark meat (breast is white). Asked for extra teriyaki sauce on the side - and when I got back to my office to eat my lunch I found they had given me two very small thimble-size little 'cups' of it and the chicken/rice/veggies had no sauce on them at all. Very plain. Very boring. The egg roll felt and tasted like a wet sock. Poor service. Poor food."}
{"text":"I have tried a few items on their menu and I always go back to my Yakisoba bowl with spicy chicken or a wrap. I love their food. Not too sweet, salty, or too much. Just the right amount of volume. 

Service is quaint and quick. Cashiers aren't too pushy and the restaurant seemed clean. 

A quick win if you are ina hurry to pick something up and head home for a quiet enveing."}
{"text":"This location is hands down the best location around! Marlene always welcomes me with the warmest smile. Her energy is so inviting and keeps me coming back. Well, that and the absolutely delicious bowls they serve up. Great food, great portions, and great prices! Thanks again to Marlene, alex, and the rest of the team. You guys rock!! 

P.S. Get the egg rolls, you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"If this weren't so close, I probably wouldn't come here.  The cashier is not the most pleasant person and is extremely rude sounding.  The way she says \"what else\" makes me want to slap some life into her.  

The interior could definitely use some remodeling and cleaning.  

The food is mediocre at best, but my niece likes the chicken which is the only reason I come here and that's not even very often."}
{"text":"Not coming here again.  Ordered dark chicken wrap and it was mostly rice.  Like over a cup of rice, with a few ver thin slivers of chicken and green pepper pieces.  Not worth it."}
{"text":"I had a 2 for 1 coupon which is what inspired me to come here for dinner. The veggies were fresh but the meat was only so-so. I had a steak salad and the meat was very thinly sliced- which I liked- but I think it was to mask the grade of the beef.

The food was not visually appealing. And I had to smother my salad in various sauces to get any flavor out of it. The meat again... lacked flavor.

I watched the woman make my salad and she weighed the amount of meat that was to go into the salad. I watched her pile the meat on top of the lettuce and watch a few pieces fall off the side. I then watched her place my salad to the side to be bagged while while she made my friend's entree. She took the meat that fell off the sides of my bowl (which was weighed once already)  and put it on the scale along with some more meat for my friend's entree.

I stood there thinking.... HEY! I've just been shorted some meat and basically charged twice for it!

Honestly, it wasn't a big enough portion to really complain about but people working in open kitchens should know that they're being watched by the customer and that we're all very critical with the way food is handled since we're paying for it and it's eventually going in our tummies.

I have another 2 for 1 coupon and I'll probably give it away to someone else. You won't see me here again."}
{"text":"There are three reasons I like Samurai Sam's: 

1. Their teriyaki sauce 
2. The low-cal options and the fact that I can chow down on an entire bowl of chicken, rice and veggies for four grams of fat
3. The low-cal option for my fatty favorite, an egg roll -- four grams of fat.

Yes this is a chain, but healthy chains get a star in my book so I'm giving to to Samurai Sam's. If there was only one closer to my home I would probably eat here way too much, but now I know that whenever I'm in the area, I will stop by and fill up on food that fills me without adding to the waistline. 

**** They also sell the teriyaki sauce."}
{"text":"Come on folks! How can you go wrong with affordable, healthy and quick! Oh and let's not forget to mention their addicting teriyaki sauce and low-fat egg rolls! This is a healthy fast-food shop and one that I would frequent much more if it was closer to my hood. But, I will say that it's worth the drive in my eyes because it's not everyday that you can find healthy food that fills you up and tastes unhealthy. It's a win win situation! Get the chicken teriyaki bowl with spicy teriyaki sauce and brown rice and make it a meal because those egg rolls are tasty!"}
{"text":"delicious food, but horrible customer service. every time I go, there's a woman working there constantly on her cell phone whether she's talking or texting. very rude & doesn't pay attention whenever customers walk in! I asked her a question while she was standing right in front of me right after ringing me up & she pulled her phone out & started texting in the middle of my sentence."}
{"text":"So Yelp says that 3 stars is \"A-OK\". A-OK is the perfect term to describe Samurai Sam's.

You can find your typical teriyaki bowl here. Good amount of veggies. Not too overbearing on the rice. Toppings include beef, shrimp, salmon and chicken. The nice thing about this place is that you can pick dark meat or light meat chicken. Their teriyaki sauce isn't too overbearing or sweet. It's quite light and flavorful enough that you can taste the other ingredients in the bowl. 

Yakisoba bowls are also an option here. If you're a noodle person, this is for you! Yakisoba is a dish that can get easily salty when the sauce is reduced down while cooking. The yakisoba here isn't too salty or greasy. It's quite alright. You can add the toppings mentioned above in your yakisoba bowl. 

What I really appreciate about this place is the choice of white steamed rice or brown rice. This Samurai Sam's is located right across the street from LVAC and I'm sure health nuts will appreciate this.

The regular bowls are decent sized. Enough for a healthy meal after a work out. If you're hungry and need something more than that, they do offer \"sumo\" sized bowls. These are HUGE. I've gotten the sumo bowl before and I wasn't able to finish it in one sitting. 

Samurai Sam's always has Groupon deals going on. For what it is, I feel as though they Samurai Sam's is a little overpriced. But their Groupon deals makes this place way affordable (it's usually $6 for $12 worth). So keep an eye out for that! In fact, I believe there's one available now!"}
{"text":"I love the YakiSoba PotStickers and Spicy Pepper chicken  Chicken and Steak Tea is Awesome great sweet tea and ice tea Also  the egg rolls"}
{"text":"prettydamngood...but i suggest you skip the o-chicken salad because it ain't one"}
{"text":"Yummy chicken rice bowl!  $5 for large dark meat bowl.  I opted for white meat and brown rice. Came out to $5.74.  Cheaper than fast food and way better!! Teriyaki Sauce is light and delicious. Veggies are cooked to perfection.  My daughter got the raspberry banana smoothie. Light and refreshing!"}
{"text":"Go to place for chicken teriyaki, brown rice, veggies and tons of sriracha! Awesome service, owner is really nice!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for chicken and rice.  There are a few different \"Samurai Sam's\" around my side of town.  There is a \"Samurai Sam's\" on W Charleston and Town Center which is VERY GOOD.

Then there was a \"Samurai Sam's\" on S Fort Apache and Russell which closed down.  This place on S Fort Apache couldn't even cook rice properly.  Now this place on Village Center seems to fall in line with the W Charleston store.

We arrived one hour before the store was closing.  The store was empty, however clean.  The girl at the register was nice and the food came pretty quick.

My son and I got a Large Teriyaki Chicken bowl with vegetables, brown rice and two regular drinks.  That set me back just under $18.

This location has light lemonade! :)  Also, you can upgrade to brown rice for $0.39.  I usually don't need to add any extra teriyaki sauce to my meal, but I found myself having to add a little bit to finish off the brown rice.

To the reviewers before me, I'm happy to report that the Siracha Suace is now out by the soda fountains.

I'm willing to give this place another try."}
{"text":"My wife was craving healthy so I decided to give this place another visit rather than driving a little further to the other location. 

I was astonished of the customer service. Was this because there was an ADULT on duty?  Very friendly, minute by minute updates. Very professional. I felt like a king in here!

The order had me out the door in under FIVE minutes!  Yes!  This is how you do it people!!!

I literally was back home with hot, healthy food in under 15 minutes, including drive time. It surprised my wife and myself. 

If they can recreate this experience consistently, we have a winner here."}
{"text":"I'm still a fan of their Sumo Bowl!  I get it with Brown Rice, Vegetables, Steak and White Meat Chicken.  

The people here are nice and friendly.  The lady knows me by name and knows my usual when I come in.  The wait for food varies, but in the last few months it hasn't been that bad.  This place does get busy which is a good sign that everyone else agrees their food is awesome.

The only thing that gets me still is the food does not come out hot enough.  The rice and vegetables underneath are steaming hot.  The chicken and steak... not so much.  It is usually just a tad above warm.   If they'd just make it HOT then it'd be a definite FIVE STARS!

The place is always clean and there has never been a time where there was not enough seating."}
{"text":"Got it for dinner tonight- can't wait to drown ounce of my chicken bowl in extra teriyaki sauce that they have out for free!"}
{"text":"I love healthy food, and Samurai Sam's has fresh, healthy food that is prepared just for you! The ladies there, Sandy and Marlene, we're professional and efficient."}
{"text":"Customer service here is terrible!  The teenage Asian girl there never has a clue to anything. Please hire someone with more common sense and a better personality and maybe you'll have more happy customers"}
{"text":"Healthy, quick, and friendly. Sure its fast food, but Id take this over a greasy burger any day. I wish there was one near my place in LA!"}
{"text":"I am on a veggie, protein, fat only kick.. I thought I would try this place today after I forgot my pre made meals. So will I go back? Maybe, but it won't be my first choice. I ordered the low carb bowl ( veggies and chicken breast) no teriyaki and grabbed some siracha to add to my bowl.  The chicken was gross. Super fatty and just ick. I maybe got two small bites off that were ok. The veggies were AMAZING!!! They were quick and kitchen looked clean. So I give 3 stars for cleanliness, good veggies, and quick service- but had to take away two for the icky chicken!"}
{"text":"Nice big hello when you walk in!

I had an irregular order and they fixed it quickly and well.

It nice to be able to see my meal prepared, even if it's quick serve.

It is about 'butt-cold degrees' outside and this place was warm and I was very comfortable.

The prep-station was clean and it was kinda cool that the staff was singing (on key) and happy.

If we play on this side of town again, I will ABSOLUTELY eat here again."}
{"text":"I went there with a few times with friends for lunch since we love teriyaki dishes. I have to say that this is a pretty good place.

This place is located on Las Vegas Boulevard not too far from 15 and the strip/outlet mall so it is pretty convenient to get there, and the restaurant does offer quite a lot of parking spaces so it shouldn't be hard to park. The restaurant itself has a typical fast food layout, and can get a little crowded at times so you should maybe avoid the lunch and dinner rush hour. Keep in mind that this place is rather small.

We had chicken teriyaki bowls and salmon bowls and they all tasted ok even though some of the items could have used a little more effort in the cooking process. The rice was ok, but not amazing and the meat was a bit overcooked. The price is quite reasonable for what you get. Expect to pay around $8 for most items and also expect to be filled after that. 

In conclusion, I would say that this place offers a good quality/price ratio and I would recommend it, if you can overlook the little cooking issues. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!"}
{"text":"Its good, its affordable, but its too sweet...too much teriyaki sauce on my yakisoba, i should have told him to put the sauce on the side, its like eating chow mein made with sugar...match it with regular coke and iam sure youll see blur. Lol"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the food here! I've only been to a few locations but I primarily go to this one. I'm often the lucky one at work who gets to go on \"lunch runs\" for our staff. I'd say we eat here at least once a week. The staff is nice and I never have to wait too long for my food. It's good to go!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located nearby LVAC, this is a great place to go to after hitting the gym or getting a quick bite to eat. The value of food you can get varies by what items you order. I order a sumo bowl every time I dine here. I find it to be a little pricy, but I'm ok with coming here every once in a while. I love how they have the option of substituting brown rice, adding meats, vegetables, quinoa, and anything else they have to offer. Each time I've eaten their food, the chicken and beef has always been really tender, which is the main focus of the meal for me."}
{"text":"Coworkers and I got some bowls to-go. Between all of us we only got two different lunches: steak bowl and salmon bowl. 

Vegetables seemed very dry and old even though they were sautéed in. My boss's steak was so rubbery and dry that she couldn't finish it even though she was starving. 

As for us? Well I never knew salmon could be so beige colored."}
{"text":"I should have looked at the reviews before coming to eat here. I've had to spit out my food 3 times because the brown rice is so crunchy, i cant even eat it. 

On the other hand, the white meat chicken and veggies were good. I'll stick with panda express for my chicken teriyaki and brown rice fix though."}
{"text":"The staff was very rude. They look at you as if we have no knowledge of the dish.  Food is better at teriyaki madness. Rice was drenched with their sauce. Doesn't taste like teriyaki. Very salty. Their bowls seems bigger on the wall than it is when it's in front of you. I would not go back there at all"}
{"text":"Great lunch place.  I love that they will do a Fresh grilled Salmon Bowl.  It's hard to find a place that will do Salmon.

They have great options, good veggies and you can even get brown rice.  I will likely be back for lunches."}
{"text":"Cheap food done poorly. How do these places even stay in business?"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorite spots to eat in vegas. Not only is it healthy but is very flavorful. There noodles with veggies and chicken won't let you down trust me."}
{"text":"They are perfectly average. You get what you ask for in a short time and the food is hot and fresh. They do not charge extra for brown rice. 

The lunch deal 2 for 10.99 is decent. 2 bowls two salads two drinks."}
{"text":"First of all, two words describe the staff here: EYE CANDY.

Now, on to the food.

Look on the menu over to the right, set apart from the main items. The spicy beef and broccoli is the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"First, I get that coupons are a pain in the ass, but if you're going to put them on your website, you should honor them.

My dry, overcooked, overstored dry-as-dust breast was easily shadowed by the cold salmon delivered to my friend.  They cooked a new piece, taking about 10 minutes to do so...

Not fast, not fresh, not as good as it should or could've been.

And you're still not taking coupons from your own site?

Good thing you're on the Strip..."}
{"text":"Obligatory 1 star. Let me start off by saying I'm pretty lenient with awful service. Given I was here the day before and my food still took 15 minutes when I ordered 20 minutes prior to leaving work for lunch. Today however was a different story...but same tragic ending.

We ordered 30 minutes prior to leaving due to the previous days delay and upon arriving, we pay, sit, and wait. Then about 5 other customer comes and one by one, each got their food and of course, me and my co workers are standing around waiting for Jesus's resurrection. Which, spoiler alert, hasn't happened.

So after about 20 minutes and we were still empty handed, I politely came up and asked where my friggety fraggetty food was. I was first told our good was given to someone else, so they whipped up a bowl i literally 30 sec. 1, ONE, O N E bowl. So I was like \"wait a minute, Wheres the rest of it...\" so they scramble some more, then out of nowhere, a bag with my order appear...cold and it turns out I almost took SOMEONE ELSE's order. Lord Jesus have mercy. But I do want to end on a positive note, the bowl that wasn't mine came out extremely fast, and everyone else after me. #slightysalty"}
{"text":"Samurai Sams has always been a favorite of mine.  They offer lots of nutritional information for their food and the grub always has good flavor.  Today's visit was as tasty as always. The young lady behind the counter was in good spirits and updated us regularly on the status of our food.  Once delivered, my steak yakisoba bowl and my wife's chicken rice bowl were darn good.  The only change over time seems to be the steak. It does not taste as good as it did years ago and can be a little chewy. Like chewing on fat chewy. I must like it enough though, given I order the same thing over and over again.  Overall, a good food option for someone who wants to track their calories and is looking for flavor in their food."}
{"text":"Seemingly being a forever college student, I'm on the opposite spectrum of Cristal, Maybachs, diamonds on your timepiece. Rather, I've cultivated a lifestyle of bargain hunting, lunch special lookouts, and happy hour pursuits. What, and there's a Groupon too, you say? You've got my undivided attention and my piggy bank's squealing gratitude. 

Samurai Sam's is known for their large $5 teriyaki bowls. Though NOT the best I've ever had, it's reasonable enough to continue coming back for. You have a choice of white or dark meat, white or brown rice, all with a side of veggies. It's served insanely quick (which always makes me question the shelf life hmm) but it's consistently filling and healthy-ish. At three dollars less, consider it the bootleg version of Teriyaki Madness' bowl. 

The employees are kind and efficient, which is why three and a half turns into four stars. Yay!

Additionally, this place is a Surf City Squeeze hybrid. The coconut pineapple orange smoothie is pretty good. A little thick, but still makes you feel like Seth Rogen and his healthy AF meme.

Currently, there's also a deal on Groupon -- $15 for TWO Groupons each worth $14. Cop it and treat someone out for next time around."}
{"text":"The food is good with very generous portions of everything...........yep. That's it! oh yeah, odd location but it was close to my work so that's nice.......ok........thats it. oh, and the people were nice and good at describing the food. I got this huge plate that had teriyaki beef AND chicken....alright......thats it............for reallies this time."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my lunch in the basement of the Capitol. I had the noodles and veggies bowl and even bought an extra bowl to take home. The price is really reasonable. The service is great, the staff is friendly and help in any way they can. Kootos to Berry and his team. Thank you for your service!! Don't know how the other food is but I enjoyed mine!!!"}
{"text":"I think I tried Samurai Sam's once before, not this location, but can't remember it being a stand out. Their menu touted to be healthy is true to their word.  We had their sumo bowl and the steak yakisoba.  Their sumo bowl was huge and had a huge portion of steak and chicken on top of the rice.  It did not look at all greasy, so I did not feel too guilty eating it.  Their beef and chicken texture and taste were not bad for a fast food joint and their teriyaki sauce was okay.  For the price of around $10, it's not a bad meal.   The steak yakisoba, on the other hand was not worth ordering.  The steak was fine, but the yakisoba noodle was not very tasty and a little on the hard side.  I will have to pass on this dish the next time I come here.  I used the groupon that I had for this restaurant, so for an additional $6, I can't complain.  For a quick meal that really is a healthier choice than the burger, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"I normally love Samurai Sam's.  This location is definitely one I will never return to.  I went here to pick up lunch for my wife at work to surprise her.  I went in ther, ordered my lunch and just waited.  Unless you are one of their \"regulars\" ... don't expect to get good service.  I watched 4 people come in and order after me.  One person got there order, ate it and left!!  The other 3 got their food to go like myself, and left with their food.  They got my order all wrong.  I ordered a chicken and steak yaki soba with extra vegetables and extra teriyaki sauce.  And I ordered a spice steak and broccoli.  My wife didn't get any chicken, no extra vegetables and very light teriyaki sauce.  My order had old yellowed broccoli and old steak that was barely even warm.  I eat the steak and 1/2 the rice and trashed the rest.  This location is vey disappointing."}
{"text":"I became addicted to this place a couple months ago. 

I have tried a bite of what others with me have ordered but for me I can't bring myself to order anything other then the \"Garlic Chicken Bowl\".  I got regular size and it cost $5.99. You can get it served over brown or white rice. I really like their white rice it is cooked perfectly. The chicken has such a great flavor. You can get dark meat or for an additional charge you can get white meat. If you like garlic and you like chicken I absolutely recommend trying this one! 

My man had the \"Spicy Steak Bowl\". He got the large size and it cost $7.39. He loved it. I tried a bite and the steak was cooked just right. For $2.99 more you can get double meat. 

Since we got combo meals it came with a drink and \"Grilled Egg Roll\". The egg roll was just OK. It wasn't something I would intentionally order on the side. 

They recently added \"Pork Pot Stickers\" to the menu. These were very dry and had no flavor. 

I have noticed they are pretty busy around lunch time. The manager said you can always phone your order in for pick up. I'm sure I will take advantage of that at some point.

I really like that they make your food right when you order it so it is fresh. 

The place is clean inside.

Near the soda fountain they have a tray with several sauces that you can help yourself to. 

They cater and have multiple catering or family style dinners to choose from."}
{"text":"Had the steak and rice bowl here.

Fast friendly service.

Food was delicious.

Only negative at all was too many veggies, but that may be a plus for some."}
{"text":"The restaurant was pretty clean overall.  There was only one person working and he came off a little short (verbally, not physically) when he was taking our order.  He almost seemed to be a little annoyed that we were taking up his time by placing an order.

The yakisoba bowl with steak was both good and bad.  All of the ingredients seemed like very good quality but it was doused in teriyaki sauce.  I think if we had gotten the sauce on the side we would have been very pleased.  The grilled eggroll was OK.  It was a little soggy but the flavor was good."}
{"text":"This place is a healthy fast-food!  They have great choices from white meat chicken bowls to wraps.  The price is right, and  the service is speedy!"}
{"text":"It's pretty good oriental-style fast food.  The prices are cheap, and the portions are decent.  Service is always quick.

Ask for their crushed chile to spice things up."}
{"text":"I eat here about 3 days a week for lunch. The staff is friendly. The food is healthy, delicious and most important, IT IS CONSISTENT. The prices are reasonable. AND they have free WIFI, so I can pull out my laptop & hang out for an hour and get some uninterrupted work done.

A few recommendations...
- The large bowl is only $5. (it comes with rice AND veggies)
- Go for double meat. It's not much more and it lowers your carb-to-protein ratio.
- Brown rice is worth a few extra cents.
- Upgrade to a combo which gets you a drink & a side. I get the crab puffs. YUMMY!
- If you get all veggies and no rice, they tack on several dollars. I think they over charge for this. Just my humble opinion. ;)"}
{"text":"I've been to several Samurai Sam's. The food is great & healthy. The greeting was kind of cold when I got to the register. When I asked for a small bowl, she responded, \"We don't have small bowls.\" Uh.... okay, I thought. So I looked back at the menu on the wall, found where it says 'Regular' and 'Large', so then I corrected myself and order a REGULAR-sized bowl. LOL. My mistake. 

When my order was ready, I asked for extra teriyaki sauce to which the cook explained that I would have to pay $0.25 exrtra. Now I've never been charged for extra sauce at ANY teriyaki places including the other SSs in town. One of my biggest pet peeves is being nickel-and-dimed. I can't stand that. So, I don't want to say that I won't be back, because I've had better experiences at this location in the past. I may just strategically avoid this particular location for now."}
{"text":"I finally got around to trying this place thanks to Groupon. I ordered the combo chicken and beef bowl with brown rice.  It was your basic Teriyaki bowl but it was good and there was a fair portion of protein to rice ratio.  Service was friendly and it's close to my house and gym so I'll probably go back."}
{"text":"Love this location the staff is super friendly! The food is always fresh and of quality! Thisbis true healthy fast food. No grease and no fryer on siteIt is easy to order vegan here! I recommend getting the teriyaki bowl with extra vegetables and add extra Samurai Sams teriyaki sauce. Buy a bottle of sauce to go it is so worth it!"}
{"text":"Sam is da man.

I was very impressed with the fare here. I had a bowl with noodles and chicken on my first outing, and it was awesome. Another time I came I felt way hungry, so I ordered the SUMO bowl. Whoa. The bowl is a 32 oz bowl, I could have had it all chicken though. The beef is meh. I agree with another yelper that the eggrolls are subpar. They are grilled I guess? I dunno, lame. At another location they had these \"carnival\" cookies that were awesome. Another variety of cookies were the butterscotch. OMG. Amazin. So yes... Sam is da man."}
{"text":"Well that was weird. 

Sat for about 10 min waiting for someone to greet us and take our order. I think they had one person working all positions cashier and cook. :( 

Ended up leaving since no one came out and eating at the teriyaki place across the street."}
{"text":"Went to this location for lunch today. Get there early, it is a small park lot and gets packed quick then you will need to park on the side of the street and walk to the plaza. 

They have a simple menu: bowls, yakisoba, wraps, salads, value meals, etc. 

I got the teriyaki bowl with dark meat chicken regular size. It is served over a bed of rice with fresh grilled veggies and their teriyaki sauce for $4.69. The quantity of food is quite small compared to other Japanese fast foods. The teriyaki is a little sweeter than I like. I still prefer my lunch spot Blue Fin."}
{"text":"I am truly obsessed what more do you want to know. I love the Sumo bowl, with lots of Sarracha. See you guys again tomorrow!"}
{"text":"This chain should have a no-msg variety for some of us.  I had a giant bowl of it and realized we didn't have to worry about msg in the 60's--70's when I grew up and I still assume food is prepared naturally. Silly me."}
{"text":"Been going to this location for quite a few years now, very consistent quality and the staff is always super friendly.  I usually get the large teriyaki bowl with brown rice after the gym for some good carbs and protein."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my chicken teriyaki bowl while staying on my healthy diet. 

Positives:
I never used to be a big fan of this place, until I was eating healthy! Now I can really appreciate a wonderful teriyaki bowl! I LOVE that I can order white chicken!! I dislike the dark meat.. It's sort of mystery like meat to me anywhere you get it LOL. I got brown rice with veggies. There was plenty of sauce also! They do have a huge sauce container you can use for free as well, should you choose to. Great flavor and fresh. I enjoyed my bowl!

Negatives:
There is not one located in Goodyear! Booooooo."}
{"text":"It is a decent place if you want to grab a quick bite for lunch. I ordered a teriyaki chicken dark meat bowl and it tasted okay to me. The portions are pretty small and the vegetables were a bit bland tasting to me. I've eaten at a lot of gourmet Japanese restaurants before, but this was like a \"fast food\" version of those restaurants. 

I recommend it if you don't eat large portions, don't want to spend a lot, and are not too picky with your Japanese cuisines"}
{"text":"EVERYTHING I LOVE IN A RESTAURANT!!

QUICK, healthy, delicious food! Easy going and attentive staff.

Just perrrrfect. Did I mention quick??"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great customer service and great food. You hardly find a combination of both nowadays. Definitely a go-to place. 2 thumbs up!"}
{"text":"So, the food was fresh and fast. The service was great, the woman working was very polite. That said, the sauce had spice to it. Like I mean HEAT! I love Teriyaki but have never had it spiced for me. Traditionally,  it is suppose to be a glaze made with soy and sugar?! Too hot, nothing worse than someone making the \"too spicy\" decision for you. That's the whole reason for offering packets of Siracha?! Likely not to return."}
{"text":"The food as service was good. I think they are a bit overpriced. I would go again if they offered a better deal for a family of four."}
{"text":"Thier food was yummy!! Coconut rice was bomb veggies were bomb.. good price.. highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Wow location stinks.   The kid they have working there has no personality and a bad attitude.   He wasn't friendly and would barely an annunciate to answer a question.  Not to mention my vegetable were undercooked and cold and the chicken was cold."}
{"text":"I've been here plenty of times for their teriyaki sauce and I love it. Today I tried the streak bowl and do not have a good thing to say about it. I saw them take it out of the microwave, the rice was soggy and clumped together, and the streak had no flavor. The lay working there had a visitor sitting in the lobby, when my good was ready she called me up left my food on the counter than walked right past my table to sit with her friend. Bad service!"}
{"text":"I asked the lady which is better the Korean BBQ chicken or the Chili something chicken. She replied, both are spicy. Than after a few seconds, she told me the BBQ was better. So thats what I went with.

While waiting for the bathroom to open up, an employee walked out WITH HER APRON ON!! Your really going to go inside where poopticles are floating about and than walk back to the kitchen?!?! My first job was at a fast food place - I lasted 6 years up to management and I would get after any employee I caught doing that. Its disgusting! Might as well not wash your hands. Thats how bad it was to me. Thankfully she stood off to the side looking at some folder and wasn't handling my food.

When the food came, NO SPICE AT ALL!! They had a little shaker up front with chili powder, I made use of it. I got up again to use the salt and pepper mix and sauce, it was so plain. There was wayyyy to much rice for that amount of toppings.

The decor is dated and ugly. Yellow and red.

First and last time I'll be going to here."}
{"text":"Advertised hours on the door show Monday through Friday 7:30-4:00 p.m. I arrived at 2:30 to a closed location."}
{"text":"Great food and very tasty! Will deft be back with my friends for another great meal! I always get the yaki soba... A must try!"}
{"text":"This place sucks, my food was cold then I received food poisoning an hour after of consuming my cold food."}
{"text":"Coming to this place reminded me of a reason why I even THOUGHT about changing my name to an \"American\" name.

I was out for lunch with a few colleagues because this place has a special for my company and it's new so we decided to check this place out.

The cashier ask me for my name and here's how it went down:
Me:  \"TRAM\".
Cashier, \"really?\"
Me: \"yea\"
Cashier: \"How do you spell that?\"
Me: \"T-R-A-M\"
Cashier: \"can you spell that again?\"
Me: (louder) \"T-R-A-M\"
Cashier: \"REALLY? wow, T-R-A-M-P? like TRAMP?\"
Me: \"HUH?!?!?\" (note: i don't really have that bad of an accent -if you're wondering)
This dialogue went on for a while so I decided to use my colleague's name for my take-out. 

I'm not mad btw but first impression- is hard to forget ;) - now here's the review.

Chicken breast Yaki Soba bowl: I did not enjoy it- my bowl of Yaki Soba had way too much sauce.  Good thing this location provide Sriracha rooster sauce so I can enjoy the chicken breast. phew.  My noodles= soggy.
$8.65 with a 10% discount for a meal (came with a medium drink and an eggroll.

Two other colleagues had Yaki Soba as well and both of them said - \"Go easy on the sauce Samurai Sam's!\"

One persn had the Chicken Ceasar salad- he said it had too much dressing and the flavor was too strong (too  much vinegar).

Another of my colleagues had the chocolate banana smoothie from Frullati and he loved it! (a lot!) literally down the whole cup right when we step outside.

I would highly reccommend everyone to try this place out because it is a nice place for the Buckeye area.  Don't expect too much but not a bad place to try- the manager there is very friendly as well.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I really like Samurai Sam's.  I wish there were more in the East Valley.

There are two dishes that I like.  The Steak Rice Bowl and the Steak Yaki Soba (sp).  Both are excellent for lunch.  The steak is lean and tasty.  Many other places I go to that have similiar dishes always seem to have a cheaper more fatty steak.  This has not been my experience at Samurai Sam's.  Also, their teriyaki is a little sweet but very good.  They are great about giving extra if needed.  

Overall, I'm very happy with Samurai Sam's and would recommend it as a good value for lunch."}
{"text":"Food was alright until, after almost finishing my meal, I found a short black hair in my food *gag*. So disgusting...."}
{"text":"Tiny salads, small portions.   Used to give much bigger portions,  not any more.   Food in picture attached cost $23.  Much larger portions if you go to Teriyaki Madness."}
{"text":"I have been on a health kick (low carbs) and love the low carb bowl.I lost 10 lbs in 2 weeks.I would have given it 5 stars but they need to give more veggies.otherwise love samurai Sam's ."}
{"text":"My buddy and I went here for a quick lunch because we had a buy one get one coupon. Actually we had two of them. One came from the Entertainment Book and another I found on the website. We walk in and its lunch hour. It's busy. It's noisy. It's chaotic. The guy at the counter is getting stressed so someone I assumed to be a manager relieved him and started taking orders. 

It comes to our turn and we order according to our buy one Teriyaki bowl get one free coupon. We were told that we couldn't use the coupon there. So I said well do you take other coupons. The guy at the register tells me, \"If they are for our store then maybe.\" Well, I'm not trying to pass off a grocery coupon here guy.... so we try another Samurai Sam's coupon. He looks at it for a minute and points out the small print. 

\"See? At participating locations only.\" 
\"So I take it you are not a participating location?\"
He just shakes his head no. 

Now, I dunno... I'm no big business person. But This just got us off on the wrong foot. This and a few other reasons is why I won't go back to Samurai Sam's. I live about a mile from the place too. It is highly likely that if the food was good and there were no hassles with the coupons when ordering. I would have come back many times - without a coupon even! So wouldn't it be worth the say... $5 Teriyaki bowl to retain someone that is going to return and spend far beyond the cost of the bowl you gave away with the coupon I was trying to use? 

It just doesn't make sense to me but oh well. 

We were already there so we order anyway. Now keep in mind I'm irked about the coupon situation so my outlook on the Samurai Sam experience could be a bit tainted. 

We get our food and my rice was really dry. It didn't seem done. The veggies were ok. Just blech. Not much flavor. The chicken was decent and fortunately the whole thing was coved in Teriyaki sauce which made it edible. 

My friend said his thing was ok but neither of us were really thrilled from the minute we walked in."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and affordable. I love the small salad because the dressing choices are so fresh. The service is always fast and the owner is so thoughtful. It's hard to find people that really care in the service industry so it is so refreshing to always be greeted with kind words and a smile."}
{"text":"Walked in around 8:45pm, late I know, but I asked if they were still open. The girl at the counter said they just had a rush and they were out of white rice, brown rice, chicken, egg roles and veggies. Hmmm. Sounds fair except I was parked directly in front for 20 minutes on the phone and there was no rush. Anyways. Yogis next door hooked it up. They were open and had food ready. Fyi. It's not hard to make rice."}
{"text":"Yum! Whenever I forget to pack a lunch, I always head to Samurai Sam's. They have quite a few options that include rice, noodles, etc. You can even have your lunch in a wrap. I always get the large riceless bowl with spicy teriyaki and a side of crab puffs (which are AMAZING!). Delicious, filling lunch for about 450 calories. I definitely recommend this Samurai Sam's location!"}
{"text":"The food was not genuine!  The noodles were like spaghetti and on the cool side!  Chicken both white and dark was tasteless!  Vegetables were very minimal!  Very disappointed! Will not return!"}
{"text":"I have been here a lot but today is by far the worst. Management has changed they now charge 25 cents for an extra small sauce it is maybe the size of a tablespoon. Ridiculous! Also the meat and rice were extremely over cooked. No one that works there ever seems to know what is going on. So I am very unimpressed."}
{"text":"Place is awesome always fresh and lots of choices 
Great place to eat right after gym close by LVAC and they give discount 10% to all LVAC members"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Samurai Sam's for a while.  This location used to be a Rubio's in case you've not been in the area recently (like me).

Generally, I like the food & that fact that it is wok'ed as you order it.  Sometimes, the white meat chicken is a bit dry (the chicken is precooked) .  The prices are decent.  this particular store had some items not on the regular Samurai Sam's menu, like garlic chicken & sriracha chicken.  There were others, but I ordered a chicken yaki soba & a Low Carb Special (no rice, white meat chicken).  Both items were consistent with the other times I have ordered them. The yaki soba was stir fried & pretty dry (only Teri sauce to give it flavor). It should be noted, their teriyaki sauce is very sweet. Too sweet for my tastes.  The veggies were very fresh & cooked well & the dark meat chicken was tasty & not dry at all.

For those of you who want a quick Teriyaki Bowl, you might be better served at the Chinese-fast-food-place-of-the-black-and-white-bear.

All told, though, YMMV."}
{"text":"The food took forever and still came out cold.  The quality of the chicken was poor and the price too high for the quality that you get.

The best thing was the egg roll."}
{"text":"Rice is always HARD!
We've been coming here for 3 years now and was always great until the last 8 months.
I've tried three different times giving them the benefit of the doubt but the rice has been under cooked all three times.
Such a shame as it used to be one of my favorite places to eat. But not worth the money for hard rice...."}
{"text":"I have been eating samurai sams since 1998 and today will definitely be my last day. The quality of the food as well as the service has definitely gone down over time, but the prices sure haven't. Today I wasted $9 on a hot and spicy chicken and steak bowl. The quality of the beef and chicken has definitely gone down and you can tell at first bite. I know that ownership/management has changed as well but it should not ever sacrifice the quality food that you are expecting to receive. After going back in because the order was wrong, to taking two bites to confirm that my first bite wasn't a April fools joke, I bagged it up for trash and went to get a medium fry and drink from McDonalds....smh."}
{"text":"Good food but take long time to get just one teriyaki bawl . Service is bad and super slow !!"}
{"text":"Awesome experience everytime we go, and most amazing customer service and food. They have great deals and specials  and I would recommend this samurai Sam's to anyone! And Chad is the most friendly and wonderful employee there and I really appreciate his hard work and amazing customer service!!!"}
{"text":"Since, I am the new king of this place. It's about time I give my review. After, eating here everyday with my bestfriend, it's time to get down to it.

I go the chicken and steak bowl and man oh man this thing is delicious. I like to chow down on the bowl like I haven't eaten since 1980! Get down on it! (1980) song I think lol!b
Great place to grab lunch :)"}
{"text":"Best location by far!!!!! The husband and wife at this restaurant are terrific and have great customer service hands down!!!  the food is amazing I could have it every day but the only problem is the price but you definitely get what you pay for"}
{"text":"I'm here at least once a week.

My normal order:
Large Chicken Bowl (white meat), extra Chicken, brown rice, and broccoli. 10oz of tasty chicken breast!!!

If I'm here 1 to 2 times per week, obviously I recommend this place. Staff has always been good. This place is not incredibly busy so you may find associates doing nothing. I don't mind it.

Biggest perk is a discount I get because I go to the gym.

 See you guys Sunday!!!"}
{"text":"It's not often an establishment gets five stars simply based off of the food. The location isn't great unless you work at a nearby business (this location is closed on Saturdays and Sundays because I presume 99% of their customer base comes from the big businesses nearby), the atmosphere itself is pretty boring and fast food-y, but OH GOD THE FOOD. There used to be a location much closer to my home, and I would find myself gorging on their food all the time, but it shut down, and now I happily drive 15 minutes each way to indulge in their delicious delicious chicken teriyaki wraps. Honestly, Samurai Sam's is the quickest (and cheapest) way to my heart. I don't care about the dull atmosphere or the inconvenient location. It's all about their wraps, and if you haven't tried one, stop what your doing and go! Go right this minute! And if it's a Saturday, go ahead and camp out until Monday. Because their food really is THAT good."}
{"text":"I love Samurai Sam's, but I always frequent the Lake Mead location.  This was my first foray to this spot.  Per usual, I ordered all white chicken yaki soba.  Not per usual, the noodles were kind of dry and I had to add a ton of teriyaki sauce to be able to eat it.  Normally, this is not the case.  Sadly, I have to agree with the other reviewers who say this location is not as good as the others in the Valley.  I've also tried the Henderson location and always found the food to be yummy.  I will probably still be back here because it is close to my house, but it is definitely not on the same level as the Lake Mead location."}
{"text":"The teriyaki chicken bowl was full of flavor. Lots of fresh veggies and chicken, with rice cooked to perfection. This is a tiny place that seats about 15-20... Much more the lunch place when you're looking for something quick, tasty, and good for you. I didn't like the eggroll, though. It had lots of flavor but tasted freeezer burned. Ick. Definitely worth going to if you're in the area."}
{"text":"We get lunch here every week at work. It is pretty good. I had it before at another location and did not care for it at all. I really like it here. I usually get a yakisoba bowl with white chicken extra spicy. It is super tasty. 

They are always nice when I call and place a large order. I just wish they didn't charge for extra sauce or extra spicy! But overall a good place."}
{"text":"Really good stir fry! I get the chicken and steak rice bowl to go a lot after the gym. Would give this place a fifth star if they weren't so skimpy with the meat. I mean c'mon......where's the beef?"}
{"text":"Disappointing....

My first time to this business. I have eaten a few times at another S.S and had a great experience but this unfortunately was not know one of them.

So walked in and they were packing up around maybe 2hrs early, I had to look online to see if they were open.

The lady who served me was nice, I explained that I had not been to this location and she went through the menu ok.

Ordered mixture of both rice and noodle bowls.

Got them home and the meats were dry and the vegetables were not cooked well.

As i walked out one of the employees was smoking at the front door!! Bit of a shame"}
{"text":"I've lived in this town for 4 years and didn't know this place existed! Tried it for the first time and LOVE it!!! The lady working there was beyond nice and the food was yummy! So glad I stumbled on this place! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I see other reviews on here and complaints about the back area and bathroom. This is a smaller business and if someone rides a bike to work and keeps it in the back to prevent theft that doesn't bother me. As gas as the bathroom being out of soap, it happens...... Just let someone know about it!

Food is great, prices are fair."}
{"text":"I like to stop by here every once in awhile and get some good teriyaki chicken. Very good rice bowls and the sumo bowl is to die for"}
{"text":"Best teriyaki sauce I've ever had. Employs young teens, but the food is great. The wraps are good and filling. Chicken and steak bowls are good by themselves or the combo bowl is good too. I usually do no veggies or jus cabbage."}
{"text":"This was my first visit here.  When I walked in I was confused by the decor.  At first is looks like a chain with cute wall paper and great marketing.  After closer look there are paper signs taped up everywhere.  Including a copy of Kcups that they proudly announce they now serve.  The food was delicious!  Ordered the Steak and veggie bowl.  Steak was very tender and the sauce was yummy and not over salted.  The staff was okay.  Not rude but not very friendly either.  One of the guys behind the counter had a sleeveless tshirt on.  GROSS!  They were closing early for floor maintenance and although they did not ask us to leave the mopping and loudly banding chairs and tables drove us out again.  We will stop again but most likely get it to go."}
{"text":"It sucks when a place doesn't have what you want. No dark meat...forced to get white meat...no spoons...smh...no receipt...lazy workers...yet u spent almost $10"}
{"text":"So I called to make sure they closed at 9PM and the lady in the phone said yes we don't close until 9pm. Apparently when I got there at 845 the registered was closed and there was no meat except for chicken! All I wanted was 2 chicken bowls and there was no reason for their registered to be shut down and their doors closed 15mins before 9PM! Ugh!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Good food for the price and everything is grilled. Nothing is fried or greasy. The low fat/low calorie food actually has a great flavor and their teriyaki sauce is the best ever. 
Had their chicken breast yakisoba bowl (wheat soba noodles, chicken breast, carrots and cabbage) minus a few veggies. Also had their grilled potstickers. Yum!
Only downside is the chicken is a bit dry. 
They are fast, friendly and always have a smile. If you want good food without a lot of fat but need it fast, this is your place to go."}
{"text":"The best place for a chicken teriyaki bowl. Seriously. I don't know why so many places can't do what this place does. Good rice. Vegetables that aren't overcooked and White meat by default. ( you don't have to remember to order white meat, they assume that is what you want! Like normal people!)
Only open weekdays till 3pm.  I often get an itch for Sams and realize they are not open. Grrrr!"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting ..went here starving and left starving ! Couldn't bare to eat food that looked unappetizing , we got the teriyaki bowls .. Veggies were soggy and looked microwaved , they were a dull color , kinda rubbery too. Meat looked like thawed frozen chicken (not fresh) rice was drenched in sauce. Place was dingy inside , not very clean .. I don't expect much from fast food places but when your starving and STILL can't bring yourself to eat the food that's a bad sign (usually everything looks and taste better ! )  just gross all the way around. If you want a yummy chicken bowl go to Yogis ! They r delish and fresh !! ;)"}
{"text":"Great place for Teriyaki Bowls. I classify this as \"healthy fast food at a reasonable price- about $7 per person.\" So many choices to eat here- skip the outlet mall's food court.

I like the chicken teriyaki bowl with brown rice. I also add crushed red pepper to give it some spice.Additional sauces at the condiment station. Free drink refills. Clean restaurant. Nice staff.    The best place for teriyaki bowls- hands down. Too bad there isn't one near our house."}
{"text":"I don't know why there are so many bad reviews, the food was great! I love the spicy chicken yaki soba bowl! And the woman the woman who took my order, Marivic was absolutely amazing! She was very sweet and made sure everyone's order was up to their standards!"}
{"text":"I ate here last week when I was in AZ.  The food was great, but the decor and feel of the place is very outdated.  The rug in front of the soda machine was filthy dirty, and the tables & benches seemed a little bit greasy/dirty. The all white meat teriyaki chicken and veggies with brown rice was super tasty and I was impressed that they had caffeine free diet coke. The location on 7th Ave and Bell Rd is much nicer if you happen to be in that area. .."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with the coworker. I would prefer this over Panda Express any day. Got the teriyaki chicken bowl with the fried rice with white meat. It was pretty good. The chicken actually taste like real chicken and not all mushy like Panda Express"}
{"text":"I like it here ... bye panda!! Place is clean n its very quick too around lunch time"}
{"text":"5 stars for the service and healthier options! Staff are super friendly, and our food came out quickly. We were starving after bowling at red rock casino and wanted something fast, but not fast food. Found this place nearby. Never heard of samurai sams before, but im a fan now. We got a chicken terriyaki bowl combo with potstickers and a yakisoba with salmon. Quality was great. Portions were filling. Teriyaki sauce was bomb! And best of all, we didn't feel like crap after :D Now I wish we had a location back home :("}
{"text":"I came in for the first time yesterday around Noon, and I just want to start off by saying the food was awsome. However the customer service was horrible! The girl at the register just had a bad attitude from the begining. And I even took it to go. Definately made me feel some type of way about coming back. I highly doubt I'll be stopping by again."}
{"text":"Love the teriyaki noodle bowl with veggies. YUMMY!  Also, LOVE the Taro soba drink with the little round balls in it!!"}
{"text":"Beyond disappointed thought this place would be a hit I was wrong first I order a chicken salad with Ginger dressing and she called my name and gave my order and said we don't have that dressing here's oriental dressing like really!!!! I work in the restraunt industry for awhile to know some common sense before even making the order if I don't have what the customer wants I will first offer something else or say would you like something similar but no she just assumed I was going to be fine I asked her to make a teriyaki bowl instead and when I receive my bowl it was very cold and disgusting and my stomach hurts I'm never going back!!!!! Horrible service !"}
{"text":"They have healthier options like brown rice and white meat which is always a plus :)
My only problem with this place is that it can be very slow. I guess it's because they won't cook your food until you order them, so it's not really a fast food joint which I guess is a good thing. So don't come here if you're in a hurry or order in advanced. Other than that this place is pretty awesome after a workout since it gives me (good) carbs and protein."}
{"text":"Food was alright. It is a \"fast food\" joint, so I didn't expect too much. Owners/workers were friendly though."}
{"text":"The stars are more for the staff and service.  The owner was really great to talk to and very interesting.  He's a retired vet with lots to tell you.  The cashier was great too.  I'd go back just to hear the stories from the owner and the service.
  
As for the food - I got the chicken yakisoba.  For a fast food type place, it wasn't bad.  Yakisoba's are usually very saucy and/or salty from similar quick places.  This one was more on the dry side which I like.  You can have them add more sauce if you like but I thought it was just right.  The noodles were firm which were a plus.  Not soft or soggy.  The vegetables were impressive too.  Not the mere cabbage and onions.  They used broccoli and zucchini and others that made it good.  It wasn't a lot but for fresher veggies, that's expected.  Better than tons of cabbage that I don't like.

The owner was telling me that their special was a shrimp bowl b/c the shrimp was fresh that day - not frozen.  If I liked shrimp, I'd be game to try it.

For something quick, I'd say it's much better than \"fast food\" chains."}
{"text":"We were so disappointed in our meals last night.  We used to love this place and were excited that we just moved back to this side of town, so we were close again.  However, last night was terrible.  The rice was beyond crunchy and difficult to chew let alone swallow.  The vegetables were cold and lifeless, like frozen veggies you didn't microwave long enough, and the meat (chicken and steak), were rubbery and tasteless (we each dumped three things of sauce on our bowls to try to make it a little more flavorful, alas, it did not work).
Perhaps we'll give it another shot one day, but not any time soon."}
{"text":"meh, nice guy at the front but when you order a large bowl don't be expecting extra meat. All you get is a larger bowl with 3x the rice.  Kinda bummed, waste of $10, won't be back."}
{"text":"I love Sam's, but not this location. Ordered two large steak and prawn bowls ( read: Shrimp bowls with extra steak because this franchisee has to be different in every imaginable category, including menu). It wasn't what I think Samurai Sam's should be represented as. The beef was about 30-40% gristle, the shrimp was about half de-veined, I guess that's all they wanted me to eat, and the rice was over cooked. So that's the food.

What I really cant stand is the atmosphere, there is crap everywhere hanging off the menu's , Boba this, Boba that... Yoga, Self Defense and Real Estate ads right at the front of the counter, something about a marathon? Then there are 3 large golden bulldog things next to the register and a Happy Kitty ceramic that look straight out of a sushi joint ( Can I get some sashimi here?). This place looks like it belongs on Spring Mountain and Wynn. 

So I will be returning to my usual Sam's @ Town Center and Charleston, at least I get some good food."}
{"text":"We always get our orders to-go from here, because it is real close to LVAC and it always seems to be filled with pre or post workout guys talking about the club and girls. 
Also, it seems to take a very very long time for them to put out food compared to other locations I have been to in the past. So ordering before leaving the house to pick it up seems to be the best way.

I always get a Spicy Steak bowl, or half white meat/half steak bowl.  The veggies are hit and miss here. I don't know if it is the location, or a new vegetable medley company wide - but there is a lot of something in there I don't enjoy and have no idea what it is.  It is like a thick lettuce?  I loved the carrot, zucchini and broccoli mix it used to be.  Now I get a bunch of the weird lettuce and a ton of broccoli and perhaps a carrot.

But yet, I crave it every few weeks.  The sticky white rice is so good and the sweet teriyaki sauce is addicting."}
{"text":"I see this place all the time while at work and decided to give them a try. Nice place inside, although it was quite empty during peak lunch time. I was pleasantly surprised...the food looked very appetizing and it was. I had the chicken and rice bowl. It comes with veggies and your choice of brown or white rice. Very friendly employees. I will be  back."}
{"text":"Best thing I had today: their blackberry jasmine iced tea. Unsweet, so its dyi sweet. Perfect."}
{"text":"20 bux for two bowls of rice with a few raw veggies on top and some fake frozen sauce. Stay away!

Taco Bell would have been a better choice!"}
{"text":"People that work there are nice . Just want to throw out when someone puts money in your tip box as your watching , it is great to say 'Thank you'"}
{"text":"I was visiting Vegas for a month for work and probably ate my main meal of the day here about 3 times a week.  It's fresh, hot, tasty and not too expensive.  If you come at noon or around dinnertime expect there to be a line, which still moves pretty fast.  Try the Hot and Spicy Beef and Broccoli, filling and delicious, although depending on the cook, may come with tons of chopped garlic in it.  Not a problem assuming you don't have to interact with anyone soon after.  The staff is friendly and the food is good, what's not to like?"}
{"text":"Another teriyaki joint for some healthier fast food. You can order and get your food easily here. This business is cleaner than some of the similar stores which always seem to have dirty tables and an inattentive staff. The cashier was nice, helpful, then went about her business after taking my order. Obviously well managed. Good job. 

Ordered a large and the bowl wasn't full. Could up the portion some. At least more rice to fill the bowl."}
{"text":"Gross. Food was bland. Rice was over cooked. Vegetables soggy and to top it all off I found a hair in my bowl"}
{"text":"Samari Sams to me is like Taco Bell to mexican food. Its not like real japenese food but Samari Sams is fantastic. Food is always fresh and hot. 

I always get their chicken yakisoba bowl with all white meat. Large portions for cheap. I have never had a complaint and I frequent this location and one other. Always happy and full when we leave."}
{"text":"CLOSED?! Wow, this must have just happened because I was just there 2 weeks ago.

But, regardless, it was terrible. The service was flat out BAD -- I was ignored for 5 minutes while 4 employees dicked around by the fryers.

We ordered two chicken bowls and an order of potstickers to share.

The potstickers looked like deep fried testes. We asked them to redo them when they initially served us these shriveled little balls that had melted wax paper stuck to them because they put them in the bag when it was covered in hot grease. They brought them back raw, but dripping in grease. I actually said to the girl behind the counter, \"You've got to be kidding me.\"

The rice was mushy, the teriyaki sauce was ICE cold, the chicken was dry, and the mixed vegetables were just a bunch of greasy bok choy and limp carrots.

This was a favorite place to go in San Diego and the first one we'd tried in Vegas since moving here last year.

Totally, inexcusably awful. If it really is closed, it's good riddance."}
{"text":"Yaki Soba here I come, this Sams is my favorite location because it is on my way home.  I always get service from the same man at the register...think he is the owner.  The location is small like most but the area is nice and the store is clean and comfortable.  I mostly get the Yaki Soba (hope I am spelling it right) but occasionally I get the teriyaki bowl but I always get these with chicken made spicy.  I even buy the Samurai Sam sauce and take it home in case my wife makes something that has no flavor and I dowse it with the stuff."}
{"text":"Did not know about this location until I was in a bind the other day, super clean, great service and of course they have the best  yakisoba which is noodles with chicken and vegetables with their super awesome samurai sauce (I buy it by the bottle).  This is the only teriyaki sauce I like and I am sure it is because it has tons of sugar.  It is super sweet and thick and goes great on almost any chicken or beef."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place for lunch today. It's pretty small and plain when you walk in but the service is friendly. I ordered the regular sized chicken and steak terriyaki bowl. The actually asked if wanted dark or light meat chicken, which was nice that they give you a choice. They prepared the food very quickly which was great since I have one hour for lunch. When I got back to work and opened the top of the bowl I found quite a bit of meat but not a whole lot of veggies. And instead of putting the sauce in a separate container so you can choose how much or how little to put on, the sauce was already poured on. The food was good but nothing particularly special. I may go back if I'm in that area again but I wouldn't drive out of my way for their food."}
{"text":"I will only eat at this location due to the quality of food. This review is solely based on the customer service. I arrived at 6:58pm on 12/10. I ordered 2 bowls with brown rice. It is now 7:43 and I JUST got my food! It had been so long that they forgot what I ordered!! Completely unacceptable- not even an apology. Hire more people or at least train them on how to handle situations that will involve people having to wait 45min for \"fast food\""}
{"text":"The outdated, faded menu makes you feel like you are ordering at a concession stand at a baseball game. The food is decent, but nothing special. I have had the teriyaki bowl, egg rolls, and the Thai Peanut bowl. The sauces were very tasty, but they go a little light on the protein and veggies, especially for the price. When Samurai Sam's was new on the scene, they seemed to be innovative and making something others weren't or doing it better. Now, it appears they have cut corners and fallen behind their competitors."}
{"text":"I've been to this place a few times. DELICIOUS food. Fast Service. Reasonable prices. I mean, what more could you want for a quick lunch or dinner? Ask for extra veggies. They're the best part, IMHO."}
{"text":"Great place to be in and out quick.  Kids love the teriyaki bowl.  Adults do too!! Quick family dinner here and clean facility."}
{"text":"This place has been quietly raising their prices by 20 cents every other week for the past 2 to 3 months. At the same time the quality is has gone waaay down. 
40 cents extra for sauce? Way to nickel and dime....the guy called me honey and every girl that went in there as well. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Never been here before. Had the sweet n sour chicken bowl, I can't say I enjoyed it or disliked it.. It was just different. I also had the eggroll which looks like it's grilled... Wasn't bad just different. The place was clean, friendly staff... Not sure if I'd go back..."}
{"text":"There are new owners at this location now. They seem to keep the place much cleaner than it was. The food is still the same. It is good quick healthy food, depending on what you order. I did not expect it to be spectacular, so I don't understand the other reviews that complained about the beef. It is a fast food restaurant, they are not going to use USDA Prime beef. I usually get a Sumo Bowl with brown rice and white meat chicken. It is a pretty big portion.

I do agree with the reviews that said this place was better a few years ago. I started going here about six years ago, and you can tell the difference from then to now."}
{"text":"I can't disagree more with the comments about poor customer service.  My wife and I are always greeted with a smile and a sincere welcome every time we walk through the door!

The food is pretty good and the portion sizes are huge!  Its a challenge to get through an entire large bowl.  And you can't beat the speed either: it takes no more than 2 minutes from ordering to have hot, ready food!  

A great place for a good quick meal on a weekday"}
{"text":"This place is sucks so bad I don't even know where to start I first come and try to order the large dark meat advertise on the window The cashier says that's only for the weekends ? When you try to order something no eye contact no smile no nothing She then asked if I wanted it for here or Togo I said Togo then she says what was that again I said Togo please You then tip her not a thank you or anything ? WTH ?? Food was giving to me by the cook in a minute I said I wanted it Togo ?? He then replys she told me it was here ? By that time I was pretty upset!! I then just grabbed the bowl and just said thank you I'll just take it The cook tried to make it right ( I think he was grabbing a lid ) But I was already walking out the door Now for the food was pretty small, barely any chicken the flavor was pretty bland Vegetables appeared they have been sitting for quite sometime and they were gross I was pretty disappointed cause I remember coming here when it first opened and it was great and I was looking forward to coming back I will NEVER!! Return to this place !! I am super surprised it's even open?? Don't come here if u want unfriendly cashier and not grateful I might add Plus the food is horrible and small There are many other teriyaki places this is just not one of them"}
{"text":"This location is always clean and the employees are extra nice. Food is very good and service top notch. Thank you!"}
{"text":"This location suffered a bit from previous owners but in a short time, it's now better than ever. 

The place is clean and the service is always friendly. Food is always tasty and consistent. I'm glad to see this location on its feet and I wish the best of luck to the new owners!"}
{"text":"I love the Samurai Sams by metro, but this location is definitely not the same. Soda fountain in the back smelled like cleaning product and my chicken tasted microwaved. Probably won't be returning to this location"}
{"text":"Customer service was horrible, me and my boyfriend walked into the place and the cashier was  busy and rolled her eyes at us because I guess we interrupted her . She didn't greet us and while we were looking at the menu she kept sighing at us to hurry up and pick. On top of that the food wasn't good at all. The brown rice was really hard and undercooked, the steak and chicken was ok overall this location and it's food was really bad."}
{"text":"This is a great healthy alternative to burgers or anything deep fried in this area. 

Never too busy nor do you wait long for your food. You can see what is being cooked as well, so no funny business going on with your food :)

Owners actually work there and they care about their customers. 

I will always come here :)"}
{"text":"Went in after a shift at work and was starving. I just had a baby 11 weeks ago so I'm trying to watch what I eat. They have new flavors of sauces that Louis showed me and samples me on. So I ordered the all white meat chicken with brown rice and veggies. I asked for extra broccoli and less rice. Louis took the time to show me if it was enough rice and veggies or sauce. You can tell you have some one working for you that cares about the customer. Thanks Louis"}
{"text":"Last time I came to This location they had just opened and the experience was less than pleasant. Since the one on W. Charleston is closed this is really my only option. The rice was warm and fresh and so were the vegetables. I am pretty sure they aren't frozen as suggested by a different user. The meat is another story. Not that it's frozen so much as that it was barely Luke warm.  It's sitting in a warming table for crying out loud.  Buy one of those laser thermometers and gun the meat once in a while will you?  It was both the chicken and the steak. I wonder if the health department reads random reviews of places before they inspect.  I knew I should have gone to Sultans Grill or Capriottis!"}
{"text":"I was going to give them a 2 star, but I bit into mushy rice. Since this place reopened in April or so it's all gone down hill. Most recent annoyances are that they charge you more than what is posted on their menu board, the music they play is probably too urban for an enjoyable dine in experience, and the food has gotten worse. Mushy rice, tree branch like cabbage and mushy chicken. The steak has gotten better, but it doesn't compensate.  Not sure the staff is properly instructed on customer service or maybe they just don't care.  Last time I asked to be refunded the difference they had an attitude. It was only $0.30, but it was the point of the matter.  May just have to go next door to China Tango instead.  Hope thy get better.  I hate to see small business screw up."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service. I stood at the counter waiting to order for almost 10 minutes while the employees said \"just a second\" and then proceeded to ignore me. I understand if you are short-staffed, but a little communication goes a long way. They had a really inefficient system with the employee taking orders and then making the whole order before moving to the next person in line. There was another employee working, too, so I'm not sure what he was doing; mostly he seemed to just be standing around watching. I felt bad for the one worker doing everything."}
{"text":"I used to grab a noodle bowl here once in a while.  Unfortunately I noticed it is closed now.  Middle of the day, signage is gone and chairs are all up. Lights out..."}
{"text":"Decided to have something different in the area...bad idea! I got the sweet and sour bowl for lunch. The chicken was dry, the vegetables were blanched with no seasoning (no flavor whatsoever), sauce had no flavor, the pineapples had no flavor or juice in them, thanks goodness for the rice otherwise I wouldn't have had lunch. Never going back!"}
{"text":"Guy taking my order was very nice and friendly- nice deal for #1 combo - u can't beat a chicken bowl side salad and drink for $7.29 - I really don't like my bowl drenched in sauce so next time I'll get it on the side other than that good solid reasonable food. 
How about doing bento boxes with tempura etc?"}
{"text":"Not in love. The grilled chicken breast had good flavor and texture. The rice texture was great, sticky white rice! Ordered the combo with the side salad and sesame dressing. The romaine was roughly chopped, not ideal bite sizes and there were older mushy pieces of lettuce. The steamed veggies that come on the rice bowl weren't adequately steamed/stir fried, underdone. I feel like the value of the food is lacking. My total for the combo was nearly $10. And I don't feel like the quality was there to justify the price. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"In 2007 I probably would have given a great review, now 2013 I say Samurai Sam's offers over priced lousy food. 

I was seriously disappointed and I felt as if I was ripped off. I was given a Soggy egg roll (i ordered pot stickers), tasteless over cooked beef, mushy rice, less than fresh vegis , staff has a good attitude ...lack of training though. All goes to show that this place is poorly managed."}
{"text":"Terriyaki shrimp with veggies on brown rice.  sauce served on the side.  The girl at the counter was so nice, helpful and patient with our questions (1st time visitors).  The food was delicious, simple healthy...what more can I say?"}
{"text":"Went in around 2pm, had the #1 combo, Teriyaki Chicken Bowl.  Was way too expensive for what I got, and the Egg Roll was microwaved, not fresh or crunchy.  I would not recommend this place.  There are a few other asian restaurants that are marginally better in the area.  The only plus here is that its the only rice bowl place at this intersection."}
{"text":"I have physically been in this location to order a meal, and my company uses them regularly to cater 200 chicken or steak teriyaki bowls. They always do a great job. The food is always fresh, hot and delicious. No complaints about Samurai Sam's or their delicious eggrolls."}
{"text":"I disagree with Allison's review. Personally every time I've come to this location, the food has been fresh, flavorful, and the cooks have been able to recommend new things for me to try each time.

The place is clean, not quite as nicely decorated as the location in North vegas, and has a fully disclosed nutritional guidelines page posted on their bulletin board, which is great for people counting carbs/calories/whatever. 

The staff here are usually very friendly, as well. I'll definitely be coming back, and if she doesn't want the coupons, she can give them to me. LOL"}
{"text":"Guys...Samurai Sam's is freaking delicious. Give it a shot...or another, if you used to be a vegetarian and came once with your then-boyfriend and got a veggie bowl and thought it was really bland and then refused to try it again until YEARS later when you moved literally across the street and now you eat meat and the riceless white chicken/vegetable bowl with sauce on the side is your NEW BEST FRIEND. And then apologize to your now fiance (who still proposed to you even though you were basically the catalyst for not going to one of his favorite casual places in forever) and rejoice that you get to feast on these ACTUALLY HEALTHY and tasty bowls whenever you feel like it.

Cheap. Quick. Healthy (if you want it to be.). Delicious. Done!"}
{"text":"Good food, nice choices, no online ordering which is a ding against it.  The place is clean but instead of smelling like the food they are cooking it does have a smell more like cleaning fluid.  I could not eat in the restaurant.  The staff is usually friendly but oftentimes you get an employee who doesn't seem to really care and shows it."}
{"text":"My husband is a fan of this place... this was his 'go-to' place whenever he couldn't decide what to eat. I, on the other hand, think its just decent and the dishes are a hit and miss. The only item I would probably eat here is the rice with teriyaki bowl. I tried other items here, but I did not like it."}
{"text":"Samurai Sams is a great little lunch location. The menu is pretty simple, you pick your meat (Dark meat chicken, White meat chicken, Steak, Salmon, Shrimp) and pick your rice (White, Brown, Noodles for $1), your veggies (Broccoli, Carrots, Zucini, Mix) and sauce (Teriyaki, Orange Peel, Sweet and Sour and Spicy). They also offer salads. You an add a drink and egg role for $2. The bowls are $5-7 depending on your meat choice. On my last visit I had to wait about 15 minutes for my food. An employee went around to every table and handed out \"any one free entree and drink\" coupon as an appology for the wait. I thought this was a great gesture, I hadn't seen anyone complaining or upset but it's nice to recognize that most people were on their lunch break and generally have limited time. Food is good, prices are reasonable. Only complaint was the wait, which I feel they made up for, and then some."}
{"text":"Chicken was dry, veggies & egg rolls were soggy. Go to the one on 67th, it's way better !"}
{"text":"Somebody take this old, tired franchise out back and shoot it. \"Grilled\" egg roll was a soggy mess. Microwaved and then put on the grill long enough to get a few grill marks on it. Not fresh at all. Teriyaki chicken yakisoba bowl was short on amount and taste. Restaurant was relatively clean."}
{"text":"Why do people think they can just make teriyaki? Samarai Sam's is definitely a great white hope to asian goodness. Ok so here's a teriyaki lesson:
Japanese make teriyaki usually with shaved beef or chicken pieces. and a light sauce. Usually from soy sauce, sugar, and sake...usually a thin sauce
Hawaiians: grill meat so it's got the charring and add a sweet sauce with a base of shoyu and brown sugar, pineapple juice/honey so it's sweeter.
Samarai Sam's: What the hell is a teriyaki wrap with rice? Doesn't it defeat the purpose of Atkins? Is this fusion? It's basically cheap, fast faux teriyaki bowls. For what it is....it's the McDonald's of Teriyaki. Is it good? Eh It's boring...."}
{"text":"Pretty good teriyaki food
I usually stick with the chicken, rice, and veggie bowl
A major plus for me is that they have SRIRACHA
The rice is usually good and fairly sticky
The meat is tender 
The veggies are surprisingly very good too
The teriyaki sauce adds good flavor"}
{"text":"I just wasted 10 minutes of my life waiting for someone to take our order! 

The restaurant was completely empty. Felt like the zombie apocalypse! I heard someone cooking in the back so my sister and I decided to wait a little. Feeling like Adele we were yelling.... \"hello?!?\"

No one ever came out. We got tired of waiting and decided to eat at Teriyaki Madness across the street."}
{"text":"Love the food and love the service. I recommend the Quinoa Teriyaki Chicken. So good! This is the only location I have found it at. Please try and you will enjoy."}
{"text":"Fast, affordable, healthy. I come to this location often and it's always consistent. 

I order White Chicken Teriyaki with Brown Rice and a Ginger Salad on the side. You can't go wrong there. It's funny to me when people get so frustrated with what it basically fast food service and gripe on Yelp about it like your 7.00 chicken bowl was supposed to be Maestro's epic. 

The Latino Gal that runs the lunch time is always quick and wonderful. Then again I'm not hard to please. 

I recommend this location and the one at 44th St and Jefferson as my favorites in the Valley.

I'll be back, per usual."}
{"text":"Great white chicken teriyaki bowl with veggies.

Not so good customer service but at the same time, they aren't exactly shelling out top pay grade for employees.

I will always come back here. Love healthy and love my teriyaki bowls."}
{"text":"Quick and Healthy. I don't try to reinvent the wheel when I come to these types of establishments. Do yourself a favor and go simple. It's always consistent when it's simple. I always get white chicken bowl, veggies, spicy and brown rice with the occasional quinoa addition. I always get the Ginger salad. When I say always, I'm referring to the countless Samurai Sams around the valley. I come it at lunch, it's quick and healthy. Some are managed better than others but I don't strive for service when it's made quickly.

That's my take! I'll be back."}
{"text":"My family loves this little joint especially my 10-year old daughter!  I love the Yakisiba bowls which is noodles, vegetables and meat (dark meat chicken, white meat chicken and/or steak).   The kids meals are reasonable and come with a drink and a cookie."}
{"text":"This is one of my standby places when I don't really have time for lunch as I work in the neighborhood.  I enjoy their beef and broccoli bowl with spicy sauce.  The beef is generally cooked well and not chewy, the broccoli isn't soggy, which I appreciate."}
{"text":"A great place to get great teriyaki food generous portions.great service a little pricey but worth it"}
{"text":"Ordered the steak and broccoli bowl. I'm getting such a workout on my jaw trying to eat this steak. It's so chewy and dry! Also the rice needed to cook a little bit longer because it's also a bit hard and chewy.
Next time I'll stick to teriyaki boy because their steak is much better quality."}
{"text":"Would give it less than one star if I could!  The midst horrible customer service, cold food, gave little amount.  Think they were about to close...so they wanted us out and gave bad attitude. Never coming back!"}
{"text":"Oh my lord! This place! I would say about a year and a half ago I never even knew this place existed. My brother told me about it, we went, I got the teriyaki chicken rice bowl...by far! And I'm a VERY picky eater, by far the best teriyaki chicken bowl I've had in quite some time! Very flavorful, juicy, not dry, overall delicious! I need whoever cooks this stuff to become a chef with their own show, spin off show, movie, book, memoir! Great place, great food, great service!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch yesterday and I was very pleased to see the $5 Chicken Bowl outside on the window. My girlfriend and I ordered 2 and they were really filling and delicious. The service staff was great, the food came out quick and it was an overall great experience. I definitely recommend coming to check this place out!"}
{"text":"Healthy fast food YAY. 
Went here with my man for a quick lunch. I've been here once before and I noticed it's always on the warmer side in here.. hmm maybe from all that grilling?

There's not much to say.. It's a tad better than your standard chicken teriyaki place.. I say this because they not only have rice bowls but they also have yakisoba noodles and salads. They also offer steak, shrimp, salmon, white meat chicken and dark meat chicken. So definitely more options than Yoshinoya..  If you're trying to be healthier opt for the brown rice instead of white or just get the rice-less bowl like I did.. with white meat chicken and lots of steamed veggies. It's located in the same plaza as LVAC so there are always lots of fitness peeps in here so at least you know you're headed in somewhat of a healthy direction haha It will run you close to $8 without a drink so it's not super cheap but it's better for you than Mickey D's ;]]] 

HOT TIP: If you're trying to be healthy and you order their salads make sure to ask them not to put any of their crunchy noodle wonton things on top.. My boyfriend had to pick his off his plate ;p"}
{"text":"I like to get lunch from here because it's convenient and healthy, but Samurai Sam's falls far below the quality and taste of Teriyaki Madness.  I always get the $5 Chicken Teriyaki bowl.  Make sure you ask for white meat chicken for the extra 49 cents because they never trim the regular meat of fat, which is just gross.  You can't really tell it's fat either until you start chewing it.  They could stand to use a little less rice and a little more vegetables, but hey, for $5 it's not bad.

Service is always quick."}
{"text":"There was dried food on the wall next to the table.  The chicken teriyaki was ok, but the egg roll left much to be desired!"}
{"text":"Typical chain styled joint serving below average fare in a boring setting. Free is still over priced."}
{"text":"Bought this on a groupon and boy am I hooked!  This place has good food and a great variety.  I would recommend you get the larger portion as its very cost effective.  Samurai Sam's...I will return!"}
{"text":"The service is bad and very slow. Barely get a smile out of the employees. Chicken is burnt due improper cooking. Other locations offer a greater service."}
{"text":"This place has hands down the best chicken among all Samurai Sam's that I've been to. I've been coming here for over 5 years and their chicken is almost always fresh, not dry or tough. Many other Samurai Sam's locations' clearly serve chicken that was probably cooked hours before (has that tough exterior).

I'm rating it five stars because I'm comparing it to other locations. The seating area is nothing to write home about. But if you're going to Samurai Sam's for the ambience, you got your own problems. 

Enjoy the teriyaki chicken bowl (white meat, no veggies). Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"I was randomly driving around because I had nothing better to do while I waited for a flight when I found this place. Food was great, the staff was friendly, and the food came right out. Loved it!"}
{"text":"Great Food.  Great Service.  Love this place!  Best egg rolls!"}
{"text":"For  yelp they get 1 star becauset 8:50 they were already closed where on Yelp they have added they're open till 9:30 so as a Yelp user if you say you're open until 9:30 it'll be open at 9:30 not 8:50..."}
{"text":"I ordered their yakisoba chicken bowl and it was yummy but the yakisoba was cold and it was definitely undercooked. I love my noodles al dente but they were definitely still undercooked by far.  The flavor of the bowl was good and it was a good portion size too.  The prices are ok but a little over priced in my opinion.  I saw some other things on the menu that I would try and would definitely go back and check them out."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Food is great.  I usually get spicy teriyaki chicken dark meat with vegetables. They don't charge for extra sauce like some other locations, staff is friendly and so is the owner. Oh, and they remember me when I come back, nice!"}
{"text":"Fresh grilled teriyaki.  Used to go here in Austin all the time...simple and delicious."}
{"text":"I usually write out some lengthy reviews...
Today is not that day. 

The food quality, quantity and price - horrendous.

Save your money...please go elsewhere for your teriyaki."}
{"text":"Healthy when you skip the rice (carbs). Feel bad they are not busier."}
{"text":"Ok this was a tough one for me. I LOVED their teriyaki sauce. It's the best I've found in the are thus far. However, for the money you really don't get a lot of chicken. Instead you get a ton of rice and what seems like a half pound of steamed vegetables (with little flavor). It certainly is healthier that most other food options nearby, but for my money, I'd really like to get more chicken (for this I go to Yogi's).

Service was friendly, but took a bit longer than I expected...especially since I was the only person there."}
{"text":"This is the best fast casual teryaki bowl you can buy!! I love this place, theyre teryaki sauce is the greatest stuff ever, the rice is super sticky and amazing as well. The bowls are wicked cheap and they come with veggies. They are very quick and the bowls are very well portioned. Treat yourself because your tastesbuds are about to dance and sizzle my friend. You can even get on that white chicken game."}
{"text":"I ordered the Yakisoba with Steak.  The noodles were too soggy, vegetables were overcooked and soggy and old tasting, and the steak wasn't seasoned enough.

Service was awesome!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Yakisoba with chicken here yesterday with my friend.  The noodles were perfectly cooked, not soggy and seasoned well.  The chicken tasted awesome.  The barbecue taste was just unbelievably unforgettable.  As for the vegetables, they were also cooked perfectly, not overly done, nor undercooked.  Overall, the food here is the best Samurai Sam's I've ever had.  

Their quality of food can't be beat against other Samurai Sam's Teriyaki Grill Restaurant.  I don't think I'll get food from any other Samurai Sam's.  Oh, and service is always the best."}
{"text":"This food was horrendous. I'm not even joking and not that you thought I was. Please save your time and do not stop here. Gummy noodles and raw veggies...ugh
I even asked for veggies well done. They better shape up or they won't  be open much longer. Just my thoughts."}
{"text":"This place used to be really awesome back in the day. Now it sucks. Maybe others are better but this location is no bueno."}
{"text":"Great food.. I usually have the teriyaki bowl with rice. Never disappointed I really like everything I have tried here. Usually they have a deal on Groupon. Check it out."}
{"text":"It's a quick meal for lunch, but fairly unappetizing. I am quite unsure why there was such a long line leading to the entrance. It's place I am definitely not look forward to visiting again."}
{"text":"Don't waist your money,  really bad 

You'll find a better egg roll at circle K, can't believe they let that food leave the kitchen"}
{"text":"When you're dieting it's pretty damn hard to find a filling affordable dinner for ~500 calories. I was pleasantly surprised to find the chicken sweet and sour bowl with brown rice fit the bill. It was loaded with lots of white meat chicken, pineapples, and green peppers. The sweet and sour sauce was just enough to give it flavor without being too sweet. I was pleasantly surprised by the entire dining experience - prices, calorie counts, taste, speed of food preparation, etc. I hope the ones in Henderson are this fantastic!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken teriyaki bowl (with extra veggies and easy on the brown rice) and it was a nice lunch.  Nice alternative to fast food, although those sauces don't exactly make it healthy."}
{"text":"My first visit was a couple of months ago and it was OK; would have given them three stars.  Nothing to write home about.  It was convenient to the grocery store I was going to and needed something quick.  It was good enough that we tried it again while out doing errands but was highly disappointed this time.  I ordered the noodles with salmon and vegetables.  The salmon was dry and did not taste fresh at all, there were verily any noodles with the entire bottom half of the bowl consisting of mostly green peppers.  I took the bowl up and let them know the fish was dry and did not taste fresh.  He did not offer to refund the money and asked if I just wanted something else.   I don't eat chicken, beef or pork and even if I did my husband was already complaining that his chicken was verily warm so I told him I just wanted noodles which I ended up not even eating those.  I threw almost all of my food and he threw away half of his and we will no longer be eating at this restaurant.  Convenient or not, we just threw $23 in the trash."}
{"text":"For a chain, it sure is completely different than the location on S Eastern. The portions are smaller & the staff isn't as friendly... but i gave them 2 stars since our food came out really fast"}
{"text":"Samurai Sam's is the best! I've gotten addicted thanks to my coworkers. It's located in a nondescript location mini mini mall close to my work, so we frequent at least 1-2x every few weeks. The owner (Sam?) is almost always at this location to greet your lunchtime palate. Each of the tables are \"reserved\" for certain persons, my guess is super-repeating customers. Just shows you how much he values any customer.

If you think this is just a \"local version\" of a Panda, THINK WRONG. When you're eating a dark meat chicken yakisoba bowl, you're not stuffing your face with a month's worth of sodium...wholesome & delish chicken, noodles & veggies instead!  A bowl will run you $7-10 depending in what you order and size. If you're feeling extra hungry, go for a grilled egg roll or the rangoons."}
{"text":"Found a lot of hair in the food. Looks like someone got a haircut before work. GROSS!!"}
{"text":"For the same amount of coin, I'd take some ghetto Chinese over a bowl at Samurai Sam's.

This is obviously healthier than Chinese, there's no doubt. The Sumo Bowl ($10!) I ordered had better quality meats and vegetables than you'd find at a Chinese take out. Tasty, however, it was not.

The ingredients were not seasoned enough for my tastes, and I did all I could to add some flavor. I added some soy sauce, Japanese red pepper and salt & pepper. Adding these after cooking proved pointless and I kind of suffered through the meal instead of enjoying it. 

Perhaps there's some sauce that I forgot to ask for, which will render the Sumo Bowl less healthy in exchange for deliciousness?"}
{"text":"Gave the lady a tip and she didn't say thank you. Messed up my order and she rolled her eyes as if it were my fault. Place seems dead which doesn't surprise me. No music, unmotivated staff. Top it off, I get home and my food taste microwaved. Gross! Never again.."}
{"text":"If you're into puking all night and spending half your day on the toilet make sure you eat here. Haven't had samurai Sams in years and decided to go yesterday for lunch. Still not out of bed or able to keep anything down. Several friends told me they've experienced the same thing. Ugh."}
{"text":"Was not impressed at all. I had not been in years and was curious to try it out again, and I could have bought what I ordered in he freezer section of the grocery store."}
{"text":"This place is great. I loved my Spicy Steak and Broccoli bowl for lunch and the sauce hits the spot... San Jose needs one of these places!"}
{"text":"Worst service tonight.  Left without any food.  One person up front taking orders and then making orders.  One person in the back cooking.  The person in the front doesn't even have the decency to apologize for the wait, just let's us all stand there."}
{"text":"Tried this place instead of going to Teriyaki Madness and we were glad we did!  The quality of the food is just so much better.  Compared to Teriyaki Madness my husband thought the veggies in the yakisoba bowl were a thousand times better - it didn't seem like just all cabbage.  

Also, the grilled (not fried) chicken egg roll was INCREDIBLE.  So much less greasy.  

Their teriyaki sauce was delicious and I poured on some extra, not because there wasn't enough but, because I tend to OD on that stuff lol

They had the choice between dark and white meat chicken.  Only thing I would have preferred is if the chicken had been cut a bit smaller.  

Decor is nothing special but the restaurant is clean.  Could have used some background music.  

I can't wait to go back for lunch again sometime soon and have another one of those egg rolls!"}
{"text":"I've had it with this place. I've been going here for years for one reason... PROXIMITY to my home. There is always the same rude little, old Mexican lady or a little bit younger Mexican guy with a mustache. 

Where to begin. The food is decent. It's grilled chicken atop rice, not terribly hard to conjure up. What irks me every time without fail is the rude service and JESUS GOD forbid you ask for any slight modification or side of sauce!!!

If you ask for Siracha they scowl at you and hesitatingly pull out .5 of an ounce acting like it F%$#ing liquid platinum. Give me as much Siracha as I please, I just paid 7$ for 3 oz of chicken and a scoop of steamed rice. 

Today I went and asked for rice instead of noodles on a dish and the dude actually yelled at me in the store... YELLED. 

ME: Can I do rice instead of noodles please. 
HIM: NO (volume raised)
ME: Why?
HIM: Look BUDDY it's PREMIXED WE DONT SUBSTITUTE THINGS LIKE THIS SO WHAT DO YOU WANT!?
ME: Fine, I'll take it as is I guess. (In my head knowing I won't make a fuss because the power of yelp is much greater then going back and forth with this darling)

Do yourself a favor, DON'T give this place any of your money. I'm done. Bye Felicia."}
{"text":"I would love to give this location five stars, but they have chosen to act as if the teriyaki sauce is made of GOLD! It used to be that they would include one EXTRA little sauce on the side of each rice bowl, plus  they would be generous with the sauce as a standard. This time, not only did I get VERY LITTLE sauce standard, and I mean VERY LITTLE sauce to the point of non-existent, they did not include the little extra sauce container that they normally used to include. 

I normally expect to get an adequate amount of teriyaki sauce as the norm, get one extra small included sauce container on the side per order, and I always request a couple extras for good measure because I like the sauce. 

My \"teriyaki\" chicken rice bowl was LACKING teriyaki sauce, big time!! HELLO, it is called a teriyaki bowl for a REASON!!! If you chose to basically omit the teriyaki sauce, then call it a chicken and rice bowl!!!!!!

When I called to bitch about the fact that I was not happy with an inadequate amount of sauce, it was explained to me that they no longer include extra sauce unless requested because \"people throw it away.\" OKAY, I can accept that fact if someone doesn't like as much sauce as I do, BUT, ASK YOUR CUSTOMER IF THEY WANT EXTRA SAUCE!!!! I noticed 90% of customers (it was VERY busy at lunch time) asking for extra sauce and NOW I KNOW WHY!!!

I typically feel bad giving a business a one star review, but this owner is deserving of it!!! If he chooses to to act as if teriyaki sauce is made with GOLD, then he will lose business. Watching the almighty penny will cost you almighty DOLLARS!!! I will never go back to this location!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have to be honest, I do love samurai sams. But this location sucks. I waited 30 minutes for my order at 3pm, like 6 people there. I was standing at the front and she helped someone  behind me first, weird but whatever. So i ordered 2 goliath bowls, one regular one with a request of no rice, the other with extra chicken which I was charged for . Simple right? wrong, we left as we had already waited for a to go order 30 min. Got home and it was wrong, called them and said nicely that our order was wrong, she said ... yeah. I said well can we get it fixed, she said call back tomorrow and talk to a manager. Needless to say wont be back to this location."}
{"text":"Seems to be a private owned location either family or friends running it, my chicken is burnt, the sauce taste nothing like samurais sauce and for the spice instead of it being red spice it's black pepper. Never will I come back to this location not to mention small portions. Don't come to this location"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have tried Samurai Sam's twice. Both times, he picked it up and brought it home to me, so I haven't been inside and not in a position to comment on the customer service experience, anything I've witnessed in food preparation, or the cleanliness or atmosphere of the restaurant. Both times, my boyfriend bought me the shrimp bowl with brown rice and veggies. Both times it was very tasty. We recently moved from Southern California and enjoy Waba Grill, but couldn't find any Wabas in Vegas, so Samurai Sam's was the next best thing. I thought it was going to turn out to be even better than Waba Grill, but now I'm honestly reluctant to eat here again after reading the recent reviews reporting food poisoning, hair in the food, and the cook scraping the knife on the edge of the trash can then still using the same knife to prepare the food. I'll leave four stars for now because I personally have not had a bad experience here so far, but I may be updating my review in the future... if I feel like taking that risk. If we ever get food from Samurai Sam's again, I'll be sure to tell my boyfriend to observe the food preparation very carefully, or I'll observe it myself if I ever go inside."}
{"text":"I love this place. You will to, just make sure you let them know how you like your favorite dish and they will accommodate you."}
{"text":"I called before beforehand to see if they would accept groupon and I was told yes. When trying to redeem my groupon the cashier said \"ours is not the $14 it's the $16 one\". They basically said I need to drive to the strip to use the voucher. Bad customer service.
Teriyaki madness is better food anyway. I ONLY came here because of the groupon."}
{"text":"very bad compared to the one on via Linda. Grossing got a burnt egg roll and the rice was over cooked. The egg rolls must have been one of those 5 hr egg rolls. They sit there all day until they sell them . The microwave the things before they serve . I wish I could give them a 0."}
{"text":"Love coming here! Friendly staff and owner ( Marlene) . I personally enjoy the large steak bowl with brown rice . The large is only one dollar more then the regular."}
{"text":"Amazing rice and chicken ! And friendly employees !!! Although grant is rude occasionally . I do enjoy the large steak bowls!!"}
{"text":"First time coming here and the experience was great! The staff was very nice and the food was delicious. It's a great place to go if you are trying to grab a quick lunch or dinner. Definitely would go again!"}
{"text":"Amazing place. I have only been here once and only went inside to pick up my food but the service is great and the staff is quite nice. Did not have to wait long for my food and I like that I can pick out how many soy sauce packets I can get instead of them giving them to me from behind the counter. I have only had the chicken teryaki with vegetables and it is amazing every time. The chicken portion could be bigger but it is worth it."}
{"text":"Had a coupon for buy one get one, so me and a co-worker went for lunch. 2 drinks 2 reg sized bowls, it was $5 each.  super fast....we didn't even have our drinks done yet and our food was ready. place was really clean and there were 5 tables already sat [it only has about 8 tables] when we got there at 1130

They have nutrition facts on the front door and online, so if you are trying to eat under 500 calories each meal, this is your spot.

I spiced mine up with my heat, but the food was good for white meat chicken, veggies, and brown rice.  

Give it a whirl!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend the spicy white meat chicken bowl with veggies.   The food is always fresh off the grill and bowls are made to order.   Friendly staff and owner.   This place is a regular stop for me anytime I'm in the Scottsdale Airpark area.   

Next time you're in the area stop in, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I am dropping my rating from five stars to two since the last three times I ate here, the white rice was severely overcooked. This last time, half of the bowl was complete mush and very hard to finish. I probably would have said something had I dined in, but since I took the food home, I didn't really feel like calling in a complaint. I think this franchise is already in trouble due to it never being busy, so repeated fails like this are inexcusable. I will probably start going to Yogi's Grill from now on (unless the owner of Sam's wants to contact me and assure me the food quality is back on par)."}
{"text":"I hate to rate a Samurai Sam's so low since I love the location at 7th Ave and Bell Rd, but this one is totally different. My biggest gripes are the rice (white) and portion size. 

The rice reminded me of plain ol' (dry) white rice, like Uncle Ben's. Other Samurai Sam's locations use a sticky rice that is perfect for teriyaki. Did they run out and hit up Costco in a pinch? Who knows. 

My large chicken bowl was not packed very full. The amount of chicken breast (also dry, by the way) was fine, but the lack of rice made me wonder if I could've had a similar portion in a regular sized bowl for less money. The side salads we got also did not come with any dressing (to-go order). 

I do feel bad leaving a negative review since the owner seems to be very well liked, but I would encourage him to visit the other location and see how the food quality differs. Both are of equal distance away from me, so I'll continue to eat at the other one, which I adore."}
{"text":"I am always so impressed on how upbeat, happy and welcoming the staff is when entering this place. The food is always made correctly (I am a picky eater). The food comes up very fast and a price you can't beat. Ive been coming here for at least 4 years and will continue to patronize this place."}
{"text":"On our way to check out the cloud nine balloon we all realized that we should probably get some food. So as many times as we have driven by this place and named it as an option we always seem to bypass it. This time was anything but the same, I decided we would try it. 
I must just have the same luck at all the places that we have been going to. There was absolutely nobody in the small restaurant. I decided to try out the steak and chicken combo bowl with white rice and oh you better believe I made it spicy.. By the time we filled our drinks and sat down the food was ready. The chicken was fresh, the steak was delicious and the vegetables were delightful. With the perfect samurai kick it was great... The service was fast, friendly and very welcoming, it was not your ordinary empty establishment attitude that I seem to find.. You know what I'm talking about, when you walk in and order and it seems like more of an inconvenience to them to have to work and make your food. That was not the case. For a quick meal that was more than worth the $6.49 I will see SAM again. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"A few of my coworkers and I decided to get a few bowls to-go for lunch. 
I was so hungry so I was really looking forward to the Salmon bowl I had ordered. 

The vegetables were dry as well as the salmon. There were hardly any terriyaki sauce which didn't really give much taste to the entire dish. It wasn't what I was expecting. 
Sadly, the oriental food bowls that Costco have in packages probably taste better."}
{"text":"I'll start out by saying I used to love this place. I haven't been there in about 8 months or so and I remember it being just ok. My wife and I went in there today. I sat in the car with the kids. She placed my order, grabbed it and we drove home. I got the sumo bowl with white rice and all veggies.   The bowl I opened at home was a sumo bowl with brown rice and carrots and broccoli. That's it. My wife got a normal chicken bowl with cabbage. She opened hers. No cabbage. Just broccoli. I'm livid because it's quite a ways away and I am never going back there. I never write reviews. I had to download the yelp app just so I can rant on how much I hate this place and I am never going back. And my word of mouth about this place is going to be horrible."}
{"text":"Ordered the Sweet Chili Bowl. Rice and veggies were good but the chicken was old cold and dry. I would rather go to Panda Express."}
{"text":"They need to change there times on Google and every where else, I came all the way down from lower cave creek to get some and when I arrived they were closed but they showed that they didn't close for another hour. Talk about 1 pissed off customer. I won't be coming to this location because of it!"}
{"text":"I dined it and as I'm waiting for my food I watch the cook use the cooking knife to scrape the food into the trash then he cleaned the knife with the side of the trash can AND STILL USED TO KNIFE AFTERWARDS.. That is beyond disgusting and not health code. Completely disgusted I will NEVER  be here again. Whoever the manager is needs to do something about that because WOW.... and when the lobby is full of customers.. no shame"}
{"text":"This is my go to lunch spot. 

Not quite as good as Flame Broiler but it gets the job done. I love it because its close to school (Midwestern) and cheap! You can request more veggies less rice, which I always do. They also have a Kid's size bowl which is the perfect amount of food for me as I always have leftovers with their regular bowls."}
{"text":"Don't let the appearance fool you! It really hits spot for teriyaki! Text them and you get some pretty cool specials!"}
{"text":"You'd better like teriyaki sauce, because it's that or pretty much nothing on top of your bowl of rice, veggies, and meat, shrimp, or tofu.  If you're okay with the lack of much selection, and come here knowing what you're after, then you'll find some decent grub.   Really, I think they do have a choice of teriyaki, spicy teriyaki, or orange sauce--that's it.

We went on a kick where this was a nice alternative to subs and burgers, but the novelty wore off quickly because my wife, daughter and I each only found one thing we'd always order, and once we got sick of that....

I swear the portions have gotten skimpier across several visits over the past year or so.  They seem clean enough, and exhibit the standard minimal courteousness, but are a little slow.

I can't figure out why teriyaki bowls have remained popular for the masses for so long.  They're usually sickly sweet and having everything dumped into a bowl and handed to me makes me feel like I'm eating out of a dog bowl."}
{"text":"The steak was dry.
And the teriyaki didn't help much in that department.

I love rice bowl restaurants... and I'm always sad when one disappoints. I'm sure it has its awesome days and awful days and I may have just ended up arriving on one of their bad days - but first impressions were awful for me. It looked very promising, and it LOOKS like the quality of the food is great... and the food got served so quickly... it seemed really promising.
But the food wasn't really worth its price... I could tolerate the dry-er rice as I love almost all kinds of rice... but not doing so good with the steak? Don restaurants often live and die by their beef-bowls, and this one would certainly die even if you just put an average Yoshinoya next to it (and that's even considering Yoshinoya's current bad quality beef).

I wonder if this place just gets high ratings just because it's the only one of its kind (as in: not mostly sushi) for miles...
I WANT it to be good. I really do. And with the high praise others give it: I'm sure it is, in its own way, at its own time. But in a competitive sense: I'd imagine it'd disappear quickly if it had to compete. 4 stars for its promise, 2 stars removed for not delivering, +1 star just to give them the benefit of the doubt."}
{"text":"They do a 2-fer lunch deal and they don't charge extra for brown rice like some of the indie locations of SamSam's do.

Nice decor and service."}
{"text":"Food was good, but then again I think anything doused in teriyaki sauce is good.  My girlfriend had a 2 for 1 coupon here so we tried it out.  It wasn't bad, it wasn't good, it was just ok.  I looked at the prices and to be honest, it's a little weird that this place is almost the same prices as Pei Wei, which is 20 times better.  

It's ok here, but with places like Teriyaki Madness and Pei Wei at the same price points and right down the street, I highly doubt a business such as this can survive."}
{"text":"Love coming here. Usually get the spicy white meat chicken combo. The spring roll makes the meal for me. Friendly staff and owner (Marlene)."}
{"text":"I'm giving this 3 stars because the quality and taste of food is good...I seriously don't know why I keep going here because the owner is not nice. He is so rude and every time I leave there, I'm muttering under my breath at what a jerk he is"}
{"text":"I really liked this location. I had a large dark meat teriyaki bowl and it was very good! Both people behind the counter were very friendly!! I will def be back!"}
{"text":"I'm typically an enemy of this type of chain but I'll give this one a pass. It's really simple to order and clean inside. Both big positives in the world of fast food.

This is how it works:

You order the meat - either steak, light or dark chicken, or a combination of the two. The meat's served on a layer of brown or white choice, again, your choice. Last two things are the veggies and sauce. I picked carrots and sweet/sour but they had a few good options for each. About 6-7 bucks and you're out the door. They have a few tables setup if you choose to dine inside."}
{"text":"I remember going to Sam's back in the day in Vegas and it was a fresh, easy fast-food spot. Yeah, not anymore - at least not this one. We walked in and the place looked like a strip-mall Chinese food place that hadn't been updated in decades and we wondered what had happened. The place was dirty. You can't see where the food is made, and maybe that was a good thing. We still ordered, and ate, cause we were too tired to stop anywhere else and hoped the food still stood up to memory. The drink station looked like it hadn't been cleaned in....a long time. Food and randoms all crusted in the corners of the containers the plastic utensils and sauce packets were in - yeah, no thanks, we will use our utensils at home. And yeah - the food was gross. Didn't seem fresh at all and just soggy. Seems like Sam's (at least this one) has seen it's Golden Years and now is just in decline. Oh well."}
{"text":"I had no idea there were Samurai Sams here in Vegas until just a few months ago. Back in Phoenix there were several different locations I would visit. I've always liked their food.

This particular location is close to where I work. I have ordered from this particular store on several different occasions prior to writing this review, usually on my way to work. Sometimes, it is close to closing time when I get there. However, every single time I go, the customer service is pretty good. I just went there again this evening before coming to work, and about an hour before they close. I guess I have been there enough times where they ask if I want the same thing I ordered last time, and they actually remembered what it was! (Salmon bowl with veggies, brown rice, and spicy teriyaki sauce, for those of you who really want to know) I'm always impressed by things like that. 

I commended them on being aware of my order history like that, but I went with a steak and chicken bowl this time around. However, I still got it with the veggies, brown rice, and spicy teriyaki sauce.

Their food and service is consistent here. At least, when I have gone. And I will continue to be a 1-2 times-per-week visitor. Good, healthier food option, good price, and very good customer service."}
{"text":"I love Sam's. Just got back from college and am in town for the summer! Happy to see that the new manager is back. I am an athlete so coming here is a great option for eating out. I can get brown rice, veggies, and chicken breast. What I really enjoy is the fact that I leave feeling FULL and knowing it is actually GOOD FOOD. I usually ask for sauce on the side since with extra veggies. Mmmm! It's so hard to find a place that understands that healthy food CAN be delicious. Thank's Samurai Sam's for the good food while I'm home from college!"}
{"text":"I love Samurai Sam's! I really like how it is fresh, yummy, AND healthy! I really like the options and the customization of my order. I recommend the Yakima soba with steak or shrimp. Pot stickers are also on point.

Also, this location has the most wonderful owner, Marlene. It is a family owned business, and they take pride in getting to know their customers. They have memorized my order and always ask how my family is doing. GREAT customer service!"}
{"text":"Always friendly service. Decent quality food."}
{"text":"Came here to visit my fiancé's best friend who works here. The inside is really cute, appropriately themed for the name of the place. We ordered a chicken teriyaki bowl and a drink, it came up to about $7. It came out really fast, like, by the time we were finished paying fast. I liked that the sauce was on the side so you could add as much as you needed especially since I thought the chicken was a little dry but still had flavor. They have a lot of different food options like different proteins for their teriyaki bowls and yaki soba noodles and wraps. They also offer smoothies and coffee shakes and I think boba. I've only ever had teriyaki from mall food courts so it's hard to compare this to anything else but that and I'd say the chicken here was considerably dryer and the portions were slightly smaller but the prices more reasonable. Overall, it was a good dining experience, I'd go back to try something else next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very reasonable pricing. Good food. I ordered teriyaki chicken bowl. It was good. Try the yakisoba noodles too."}
{"text":"I love this place!! staff is always so helpful and friendly. Food always tastes fresh and is done incredibly fast. favorite location out of all the samurai sams. the spicy teriyaki sauce is the best!"}
{"text":"Went back today since my last visit, total 360° what shall I say GREAT.Beef bowl full of beef and flavor.I guess it was just a one time off day the last visit and I retract my bad review and apologize to samurai sams."}
{"text":"First time here was to get a shrimp wrap to go. The place was half full but the order took over 10 minutes.  The staff were really nice and gave me 2 extra sauces to go with my order. The food was good, not very flavorful without the sauce.  For the price I paid I think I will make this a rare stop."}
{"text":"Healthy good meals. I frequent this place. Very consistent,  but charges extra for everything. Small and nor a very attractive dining experience cause I get mine to go but really good healthy food."}
{"text":"This is an alternative lunch spot for me when I want something different, but still quick and providing at least some vegetables.  It's fast food and the bulk of the flavor that'll stand out in any meal will likely come from the sauces you dump on your rice or noodles . . . still, this can be tasty and it is quick. I like the combo rice bowl with chicken and vegetables.  The steak's a bit on the rubbery side but it tastes fine for fast food."}
{"text":"The girl who works the front had the WORST personality and customer service. She acted as if she totally hated her job. We asked her a simple question about adding to our bowl and she ROLLED HER EYES! So dry and blah! Food was great but the customer service ruined it for us."}
{"text":"I suffered from Yelper's remorse on this visit, rule #1 look it up on Yelp and read the damn reviews first. 

I was out and about looking for a lite bite for lunch and came across this joint. I said to myself, ok well they have a chicken bowl advertised on an outside banner so I am sure they have vegetable bowls as well.

I mean seriously how can you screw up on a bowl of rice and veggies? Well they proved my theory wrong!

I ordered a veggie bowl with brown rice. I paid my $5 (small bowl) and took it to go to later unwrap a bowl of soggy and wilted broccoli all (2) tiny pieces and cucumber slices galore.  The brown rice was ok what there was of it. The teriyaki sauce was ok that was lightly glazed covering the veggies. 

I was disappointed to say the least, they should rename it the \"2 pieces of broccoli and cucumber slices wilted to perfection bowl\".

SS, you bent me over for my $5 this time, but I will stand tall and pull my panties up and walk away and forget you exist.

Not the happy ending I was looking for :("}
{"text":"Do u like eating food that gives you diarrhea afterwards? Well, this is the place for you!!

I had the steak bowl and it tasted not very fresh i would say. Not the worst ive eaten but i def wont go back. 

Healthy and close to my house but i dont wanna get an upset stomach."}
{"text":"2nd time at this location and same girl working behind the counter and actually remembered my name! Very friendly service and good food too! Have not had a problem at all. Recommend this location."}
{"text":"What a disappointing lunch! So I have gone to Samurai Sams in the past and I loved them! Then they slowly started closing them down in the Mesa area and they were just a old memory till I drove by one at lunch while at work. Without thinking I turned around super excited and stoked to have some of that delicious teriyaki sauce drenching chicken and white rice. 
The location was not very clean to begin with however I didn't really care, I already had my heart set on a bowl of teriyaki chicken... 

The staff was nice and was quick to get my order up. Now, one of the reason I gave 2 stars is because I remember they used to let you pour your own teriyaki sauce on your bowl.. You used to be able to load it up and even have it overflow... Not here. Nope, they give you the amount they think it should have and if you ask for more they charge 50 cents for a small cup of it. It was ridiculous. I wasn't going to pay more so I just dealt with what was given to me. 10 min after eating my co worker and I both got sudden stomach pains for a few hrs. The only thing we had eaten that was the same thing that day was Samurai Sams, so im no detective but I am guessing it was that. I personally have probably eaten my last samurai sams meal... Its a bummer cause I used to love this place."}
{"text":"Just went for lunch today and can't say I love it nor hate it. To be honest, it fulfilled my need for a decent meal at a decent price. 

One thing I liked is the choice of white or brown rice. One thing I did not like is the large amount of vegetables and minimal amount of chicken in a teriyaki bowl."}
{"text":"Visited this place on my lunch break and decided to take the leap and try a new venue, and I'm glad I did.

As soon as I walked in, the two staff members working last night greeted me. The atmosphere there was laid back and laxe, which I liked. For around $6, I picked up the teriyaki veggie bowl with brown rice - the portion size was worth the price. Service was quick, and delicious. Definitely recommend to anybody on a lunch break near the area."}
{"text":"So I have never been to this location and had only been to SS one time before and I was not impressed that time. It's been about a year since that visit and at this location and this visit I have changed my mind. I ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl and egg roll which I liked it. The service was fast and so friendly, the cashier I believe her name was Meghan according to the receipt was very nice and helpful..  all in all a good visit."}
{"text":"Called out the guy for handling my food with his bare hands. He took a big Paw full of broccoli and threw it in a bag. I told him he needs to wear gloves. Amazing what can go on without the customer knowing."}
{"text":"Redeemed my Groupon here today.  The restaurant wasn't busy when I arrived around 8pm, and they waited patiently for me to review their menu (first time visitor) and finally placed my order.  With the Groupon $12 credit, I only paid another $3 for a large Chicken Bowl Combo and a Chicken Wrap (all upgraded with Brown Rice and the rice bowl topped with their Spicy Sauce).  But there were a steady flow of customers that came and went during my meal, mostly ordering take-outs.

The portions served here are decent, especially the wrap/burrito.  And it was pretty good, except I thought it could be \"enhanced\" with more teriyaki sauce (packed with a lot of brown rice which makes the whole mouthful of chicken wrap tastes dry).  The Chicken Bowl is pretty much the same thing, except obviously served in a bowl and I liked the spicy upgraded version of the sauce.

Price-wise, it seems like a lot.  But with the healthy portion size that will leave you satisfied, I think it was A-OK.

The restaurant is decorated with Samurai Sam motif wall paper, with Kanji characters, origami instructions, etc. decorating one side of the wall.  I thought it was pretty neat.  It is furnished with small tables and chairs that are typical of these fast-casual chain restaurants, which are comfortable to use during your meal, but not comfy enough to spend a lazy afternoon chilling or reading your book.

The service is surprisingly fast.  My order was complete just a minute or two after I filled my cup with sodas and started to read a library book I had brought with me.

They also have a promotion of 10% off for LVAV members with a current ID, which at least one lady (she was cute and besides myself, might just be the best looking person to drop by the entire time I was there :p ) took advantaged of.  

Overall, it is a nice little take-out or dine-in fast casual restaurant serving teriyaki themed menu.  If I am in the area and in the mood for teriyaki chicken or steak, I would drop by.  Heard their teriyake salmon is good, so maybe I will try that in the future.

Ambiance:  3.5/5

Cleanliness: 4.5/5

Food:  3/5  Not gourmet, but hits the spot when you crave some teriyaki.

Service:  3.5/5  Fast service!

Price:  3/5  You get what you pay for.

Location:  SW part of town, and not close to the Strip, so definitely for locals working, residing in the area.

Parking:  4/5  Plenty of parking 90% of the time.

A-OK!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is really cool inside! Staff is pleasant and the place is clean! 

Their teriyaki bowls are the bomb! Prices are reasonable. It does get super busy inside on the weekends"}
{"text":"This is nothing but fast food that tastes like cardboard. Very salty and my chicken was burnt."}
{"text":"Always great food and fast!  Healthy bowls with delicious vegetables that are not over-cooked and!  Steve is always very friendly!"}
{"text":"I stopped by this place while I was taking a break from studying at the Summerlin library. It is pretty standard issue rice bowl and meat. I had the spicy pepper steak with brown rice. I covered it in Siracha which made it hit the level of spice I was looking for. It was decent. I was kind of surprised how expensive this place was. It was $18 for 2 people to eat. But then, I guess that's what you get in Summerlin. This location was nice though, because it is locally owned and the owners are really nice people. That said,I honestly like the Flame Broiler better."}
{"text":"Very frustrating. I used to go here often after school for a quick meal and I would sub out the veggies for extra sauce. Today I went there for the first time in about a year and I'm told absolutely no way, that I will either get veggies or no veggies but I will have to pay for extra sauce! And it's $0.40 for such a tiny container. What a bummer, I used to love eating there."}
{"text":"Nice little dine-in... service was mediocre for the most part but the cashier was very friendly & customer service is what Vegas lacks come the up & coming younger generation these days. There was a line & the cashier was trying to work fast but of course you can only do what you can do. Although, another young lady just sat next to her on her cell phone & watched the line sit with not even the slightest intent to offer assistance to the customers or her coworker. I stood at the counter patiently for about 5mins after I received my order just for a cup of ice & YES all while the girl on her phone glanced at me but turned away with no regards! SMDH! Word of advice to avoid unnecessary situations that seem more or less unprofessional... personal cell phones should be used on \"personal\" time & not be in use while on the clock unless your paying employees to sit around on their phone. Otherwise if not on the clock do not be behind the counter seeming as if though you have absolutely no professionalism. Just a thought ehhh... on a different note, food tasted great- prices a little high for the portions but were alright size (could use larger veggie portions) but good place none the less."}
{"text":"I don't care for Samurai Sam's based on the very few times I have visited. The food is sad, oily and the portions are skimpy for the price point. 

This location was empty even during peak lunch hours, that says something."}
{"text":"I got the Groupon for this place (shocker) and decided to use it one lazy evening when I wasn't in the mood to cook (another shocker). 

The location is nice enough and the employees are friendly. I ordered the chicken yakisoba bowl and my fella ordered the sweet and spicy chicken bowl. We also shared an order of gyoza.

My noodles were slightly dry and not particularly plentiful for the price. My fella enjoyed his, but I thought it was just too sweet and not enough spice. The gyoza was nothing memorable.

Overall, the place is just ok and if not for the Groupon I think I would've felt a little cheated on the price. I probably won't be a regular here, but I can see it being a good go-to place for an after the gym dinner."}
{"text":"Second times a charm for this chain of restaurants. I have tried Samurai Sam's in the past and have not been impressed. Although the food is not fancy or gourmet in any way, they offer a lot of healthy options for your buck. 

My coworker and I are trying to watch what we eat, so I flipped through my Entertainment book to see what coupons I had for neighboring restaurants. We settled on Samurai Sam's and proceeded to order the Teriyaki Chicken Bowls with brown rice. I love that they have both brown rice and low carb (veggies instead of rice) as options. They also give you the choice of dark meat, white meat or mixed. Definitely a plus. The food was served up quickly and was pretty tasty as well. 

This is definitely a location I will be back to."}
{"text":"Down the street from our house and a good alternative to pizza and burgers.

Different options with white rice or brown rice, vegetables included if requested or just with the meat.

Good flavor, quick service and friendly staff.

Store is clean and there is plenty of parking as it is in the shopping center that use to have the Albertsons. 

Will be back for the dark chicken bowl again and again."}
{"text":"Not horrible.  Get the sauce on the side so you can meter it's overuse."}
{"text":"Small place, maybe room for a dozen sitting customers so i got mine to go. Food is good i think i dealt with the owner, he was really nice all his employees seemed to be in a good mood which made for a pleasant atmosphere the 3 minutes i waited for my food. To recap, good food, nice staff and good prices. 4 stars. Thanks!!"}
{"text":"Loved it! You can't get good teriyaki in Southern California. The Steak Yakisoba bowls were good size with lots of very tender steak. Place was neat and clean and the employees were friendly. I will make this a regular stop when I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"We hit this place when we're in town every year. We love the white chicken noodle bowl. I give it 4 stars because there could be more sauce to make the bowl a little less dry. Otherwise, flavor, price, and portion are great!"}
{"text":"Yummy...and healthy. Unless of course you eat all of the white rice. They do offer brown though. Everything I've had here has been awesome, and I've tried almost everything on the menu. They have this tasty blackberry jasmine tea as well. I wish the owners of this location would take over the Grand Canyon location and the Ft Apache/Russell, cause both of those locations blow."}
{"text":"I came here a lot when I was younger and loved it. But recently it's just been bad. I ordered an large chicken bowl. Went sat down and I noticed my chicken was very undercooked and the rice was not fully cooked as well and they barely went any sauce on it.

I highly do not recommend this location."}
