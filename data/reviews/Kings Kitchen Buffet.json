{"text":"Although I had my doubts about a place which claims to serve Japanese, Thai, Malaysian and Chinese all at once in a buffet format, I went to try it for the sake of science.  Started off with the sashimi, which were sliced in randomly-shaped pieces. Everyone working there seemed to be Chinese, so that wasn't a surprise. I didn't die or get sick afterwards, so I guess the sashimi was ok. Had a ton of the seaweed salad, which was pretty good but had a lot of cucumber mixed in.  The all you can eat lobster and crab was edible, but obviously not fresh as the meat was crumbly. Lobster soup with puff pastry was not bad. Hot and sour soup was good. Green thai curry and mango salad was also decent. However the other dishes ranged from bland to plain nasty. I tried the clams, which were made with I think lemongrass (?) which tasted very weird. The curry lamb was also inedible. There is a large dessert table, and I tried to sample each thing on it but it was mostly bland. They also have a waffle station, which was left unmanned when I was there. To get a waffle made fresh just ask one of the ladies working in the open kitchen. However, go for the whipped cream and stay away from the ice cream as it was bitter. I have never had bitter ice cream in my life!  Around 9:00-9:30 they started cleaning the kitchen and no more food came out. The place was not busy to say the least. I give them points for trying to serve expensive items such as lobster, crab and lobster soup in a buffet format, but the quality is just not good enough. For the price ($21.99 each on weekend night) you could go for much better Japanese AYCE or a decent meal at any other Thai/Malaysian/Chinese place."}
{"text":"Food quality is pretty bad. Rice is not fully cooked, it is hard! the shrimps are not fresh... many of the chinese dishes are edible but they dun taste good.   i was happy to go for the choco fountain that they have but very disappointed by the fact that the texture of the marshmellow is weird... i wonder how long they keep the food for...  the dessert is another disaster... i tried for a few ones... i cant even finish one dessert item... they just taste awful  the only point i will give them is that the sushi and sashimi taste fine... the only thing i would wanna go for at the place..."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I did not have a coupon like some of the other Yelpers who have reviewed this place.  That said, I was compelled to write my first review simply because of how absolutely atrocious the food is.  All the other reviews are bang on and my experience was not any different.  In sum, for a buffet the food selection is limited (absolute joke in terms of quantity and availability!); quality is terrible (not hot and the taste is horrendous).  Sorry folks, I'm not going into real details here but the other reviews do cover it accurately.  I don't understand how a restaurant could be run like this.  This is a 1-star rating from me and it's 1-star too many!!  Save your money and go elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Terrible. The food quality was way below par, although it's fairly cheap.  For my cousins' birthday, they got a \"coupon\" for  free lobster soup for everyone. We used it, the lobster soup was mediocre (though you could tell the ingredients were not of decent quality). We found out later that there was lobster soup out in the open, part of the all you can eat menu - yup, the \"coupon\" gave us nothing that we couldn't have already gotten.  The service was alright, nothing special. Plate-clearing was prompt, (though we did not go during peak hours)  Something pathetic that I found though: They had a dim sum section that served eggtarts, BBQ pork buns, etc. They also had a dessert section that had  \"cream tarts\", (artificially) colourful cake, and pre-packaged individual \"ice cream\" (none of the ingredients said \"cream\" though, just \"milk ingredients\" etc.) etc. The eggtart was meh, and after scouring the desserts for something decent, i settled on taking a \"cream tart\". I found out that they were actually eggtarts in disguise, covered in dried whip cream, trying to pass on for something new. At least it made me laugh.   Oh and the BBQ Pork in the buns? It wasn't even red."}
{"text":"Don't be fooled by the advertisement and group deals that are available for this restaurant. One of the most disappointing buffet experience that I ever had. Came here with the family on a Saturday lunch.  There are so many levels that this buffet went wrong that I don't know where to start. The only positive thing that I can say is that service was quick and spot on with clearing away of the dishes and refilling water. The restaurant is spacious and the decor is also very modern and stylish. But they spent so much money on the decor, they probably forgot to spend any on the food budget.   Claims to offer Japanese, Thai, Malaysian, and Chinese food, I could hardly even notice it when the food quality was so poor. Starting with the sushi, the selection was sparse, offering thin slivers of sashimi, california rolls, tuna rolls, and vegetable rolls. I could taste the vinegar in the rice. It was actually sour.   The hot food counter had about 8-10 selections, ranging from chicken, sweet and sour pork, fried noodles and rice, stir fried mussels, vegetables, and fish. I tried a couple from this section and I was surprised to taste soap detergent from several of the selections. And it wasn't just me that tasted it too.   The dim sum section was even worse. Your most standard har gaw (shrimp dumpling) contained shrimp bits and filling. Can you believe it? The rest were less than passable as \"dim sum.\"  The deep fried section was beyond edible, deep fried to the point of rock hardness. And three selections of soup. Wow.  Their dessert section was quite extensive, but not impressive. There was a chocolate fondue fountain, served with melons (I kid you not) and stale/hard marshmallows. No strawberries? The fondue never hardened. I let it cool for a good 30 mins and it was still wet. I have no idea why.   There are 2-3 selections of cake, black sesame and sweet tofu dessert, and other patries. There wasn't even an ice cream section! All they offered were small packets of \"ice cream\", which really just contained cream substitutes.   Please do yourself a BIG favour and avoid coming here. This restaurant invests so much on advertisements and decor and took away any attempt to upscale their food quality. My whole experience was trying to find the most decent and edible selection, but was unsuccessful. I just hope I don't get sick."}
{"text":"This place deserve 0 Star rating if I can. I have been to every Asian buffet restaurants in GTA, this is the worst restaurant.  I went on Wednesday lunch at 12:30PM. Adult price is $10.99. They have about 8 different Dim Sum dishes, they look bad, over cooked, been sitting there for ours. Curry beef and curry chicken do even have the right color. Sweet and sour soup is OK. Noodles are over cooked, fried rice are over cooked. They don't have enough  customers, so food must in steam bath since 10AM. Sushi looks OK, but selection is very limited.   When come to desert, they are worst in GTA. Very little selection.    The most enjoyable dish I had was ice cream that's because ice cream is made someone else.  Don't torture yourself, go to Burger King near by and have a burger.  If you really want to try KIng's Kitchen, go ASAP. I think this restaurant can go out of business any time."}
