{"text":"My wife and I popped into Guirei out of convenience the other evening after attending an event at the community centre across the street. We found the place to be clean and we were happy to be seated at a (paper) walled in booth. 

We ordered the $49.95 Gui special for two people. First they brought a little amuse bouche of a couple pieces of deep fried maki and a miniature noodle soup. The salad followed which I didn't enjoy as it was a slightly slimy mixture of fresh and pickled vegetables. Miso soup arrived with the salad and it was fine. The tempura was next and that was my favourite part of the meal. It was fresh from the fryer and included 3 shrimp and a variety of vegetables. Our sushi/sashimi/maki platter was next which had a few pieces of salmon and tuna sashimi (the salmon was good, the tuna was mediocre), a few pieces of sushi, and a very average california roll. Next came our teriyaki chicken which we selected from a choice of chicken, beef, or salmon. It was fine, better quality chicken than most teriyakis I've had, but nothing to write home about. A scoop of green tea ice cream rounded out our meal with a beautifully presented slice of orange. 

The service was very good and they timed the arrival of the dishes perfectly. 

We got a lot of food but I still think $49.95 was a bit steep. I might go back if I were in the area but would probably make the 10min hike up to King St. for a wider variety of restaurant options."}
{"text":"By far the worst sushi experience I've had.  While waiting for our delayed flight at Billy Bishop Airport, we decided to leave the terminal for a while to check out the nearby restaurants.  I checked Yelp to see what was around and unfortunately Guirei was the only nearby open establishment.  

Even though it was lunchtime, the place wasn't that busy (which should have been a warning sign).  It was a beautiful day, but all of the 4-person tables (I was with a few other people) were occupied by single diners, so we had to cram onto a smaller table.

Let me say this first: the service was, for the most part, very good.  Our server was attentive and understanding of our numerous complaints.  They could do a little more about dining area management (aka, making sure parties of 4 don't have to sit at tiny tables while single diners take up 4-seaters), but that's about it.

And now on to the food... Our lunch dishes came out soon after ordering (we mentioned having a flight to catch), but there was just something off about everything.  One person in our party ordered the LA Shortribs (supposedly a special), but were really just warmed up in the microwave.  I ordered the sashimi bento box, but was less than impressed.  All of the sashimi had a fishy/frozen taste and smell, which was an immediate turnoff.  Determined not to let this ruin my experience, I forged ahead through the sashimi plate but stopped all together half-way through the tuna.  A hair.  Yes, a long black hair was found in between two of my sashimi pieces.  On the plate, sure, I can understand that.  But *in between* two pieces of the same kind of sashimi is very unusual."}
{"text":"Our regular Sushi take-out place wasn't delivering last night due to street closures for the MMVAs so we ordered from this place via justeat. Ordered at 7:45 and by 9PM, the food still hadn't arrived (we live just over 1KM away). I called the restaurant and the lady on the line couldn't even tell me for certain that the food had been made, let alone when it would arrive. I then went on live chat with Justeat, who call the restaurant and had the same issues getting information as we did, so we ended up cancelling the order and ordering from someone else instead. Low and behold, at 9:45PM, a full 2 hours since we put through our order, the delivery driver called from the street to say he couldn't find our apartment (ever heard of googlemaps, guys?). We told him we cancelled the order because it was taking way too long, and sent him back to the restaurant.

Restaurant owners, if you can't handle the deliveries, please stop using justeat. I'm getting really tired of waiting 1.5 hrs + for my food, or never having it arrive at all."}
{"text":"Been here many times. Great lunch specials. Big portions (especially the Bento boxes). Great selection of sushi and Korean food. Everything I've had has been tasty and well presented."}
{"text":"I live in the states and we simply do not have sushi pizza but this place has it and it is to die for.  Love the location and everything i have had there is fantastic. Casual and wonderful.  They have a patio where you can sit out and look at the water.  I truly go out of my way to to to this place."}
{"text":"Decor, atmosphere is average.  Food is good, with a very average/fair pricing, comparable to many other sushi joints.  I get take out when I am too lazy to travel farther for better or cheaper sushi joints.  Service is OK, turnover of servers is high, so service is something that will be a hit or miss.  Guirei is average at best."}
{"text":"First time there last night. This is a Japanese owned restaurant so the place was very clean, service was gracious and polite and plating and presentation were well thought of. 
For a Friday night, the place was not packed. This is definitely a hidden gem. Got the unagi donburi, and the eel was soft and the sauce was just right. Also got a side of spicy scallop sushi... Omg. Definitely going back there again, the sushi quality and service is better than any of the king west joints."}
{"text":"Love this place. It's hard to find a sushi place that is good every time you go. This place is consistently good. Fresh, delicious rolls every single time. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Pricey but not prohibitive, Guirei gets my vote for prompt, polite, and accommodating customer service (if not the most generous of sushi servings). Given a choice between another neighbourhood sushi restaurant, Mi-Ne on Bremner, I'd go here, for the superior customer service alone.  At Guirei, you can customize your roll with extra charges but no fuss and no attitude. Plus, Ikura is on the menu, which is key for Ikura fans.

I've had the Uni filled Viagra roll twice and ordered Uni sushi, Ikura,Tobiko sushi, Unagi, salmon sashimi, miso soup as well as the Alaska roll: all served fresh, all delicious. The miso soup was served hot, the fish was fresh, and our meal delivered without a glitch. Out of 3 visits, I have had 3 positive dining experiences at this location.


Our waitress was very attentive, refilling our tea and water promptly, and easily accommodating our request to have the Uni served separately (boyfriend is allergic to shellfish). We were seated promptly and served with equal speed. 

Note to large groups: dinner time seems to be especially busy for this location, and in my recent experience, it has been filled with groups of customers around 7.30pm: make a reservation. 

So why the 3 stars? The sushi servings, while fresh, are smaller in size, comparatively speaking. And the prices, in direct comparison to Gonoe Japanese restaurant (located on the Queen's Quay) is more expensive, sometimes by a dollar per order. However, the quality of the fish is high, and I have eaten well on every visit. 

In a pinch, this place delivers a good meal, in a convenient location. My vote: Ikura Girl approved."}
{"text":"I ordered take out here last week.  Sub-par sushi in all aspects.  There are way to many affordable and good sushi restaurants in this city to even justify eating here.  I live close by and thought I might as well try it, wish I didn't.  My neighbourhood is lacking good take out sushi!!"}
{"text":"This is my local sushi restaurant so I'm here a lot and I love it. I usually get the sashimi dinner combo and it's a good amount of food for the price and always delicious. Lunch combos are also well priced and you get a lot. 

Staff here are friendly and attentive and we're always welcomed with big \"hellos\" from the cooks. 

We like sitting in the small private booths near the back. 

Overall, my go-to sushi restaurant."}
{"text":"I got the chicken Katsu tonight and it was horrible the rice when I opened it looked half eaten and also found a hair in it and it was cold. Maybe they didn't like me and gave me someone's left overs. It came with 2 thin chicken cutlets, 1 was good the other awful. Chicken had weird texture when biting into it like... Rubbery carrot... Not impressed did not eat even 1/3 of my meal. $15.58 a bit pricey especially for rice from a trash bin & mutant, freezer burned expired chicken. 

Hungry buyer beware, maybe disappointed."}
{"text":"Slow service and more expensive then the usual sushi spot.  Lots of people waiting on their dinner and no waitress in sight!   More expensive to eat in then take out."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst sushi in Toronto I have ever had. The salmon appears to have gone through a microwave (see my photo), tuna is flaking and grey. So bad we sent it back."}
{"text":"The service is really good and miso soup is delicious!
Is a good place for good sushi!"}
{"text":"My wife and i have been regulars for at least 5 years now, we generally call ahead and order for pick up.  Food is consistently great, no complaints whatsoever."}
{"text":"I have lived in the area for about 8 years and have been frequently visiting this establishment since day 1. I have found it to be a consistently good sushi establishment with large sized portions. I personally order the dinner combination #3 on the new menu - Sushi & Maki dinner. I do like to substitute the unagi roll with a spicy tuna roll in this combo as I'm not a huge fan of eel. Don't be fooled by the low rating. This place is a good sushi place with large portions and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"The sushi here is pretty good. I've gone over lunch time with my colleagues since it's near our office. The problem is that they're slow as molasses. You can expect a work lunch to run almost 2 hours even if the restaurant is reasonably empty. Not the best."}
{"text":"PROS: A nice quiet spot on the waterfront, including a patio out front. Good sushi/sashimi plus other items (like Bibimbap). CONS: The interior could use a fresh color/coat of paint, and staff must do a better job of providing the bill in a timely manner; often times I have to go find a sever in order to pay the bill!"}
{"text":"Only tried the sushi, but it was extremely fresh; lots of variety, great service (actual Japanese staff and cooks, who gave us great advice; and didn't charge us for a couple of rolls that were a bit exotic for us. Nice patio across from the lake. It was quiet till about. 7pm; then got packed till close."}
{"text":"Quite happy to find this place around the corner from  Billy Bishop airport.  I had the deluxe bento box.  Was nothing spectacular but it was good and very reasonably priced.  Service lacked for what was a very slow day.  I think some of that was lack of english fluency so I'll let it pass. 

I was happy with the food, seemed fresh and it was reasonably priced.  I suspect it will be my supper location before flights in the future."}
{"text":"Best Japanese restaurant in Oakville. Consistently fresh and delicious with impeccable service."}
{"text":"Great sushi, terrible  customer service.
They should consider stepping up their game since a brand new sushi place opened right across the street. 
Will NOT be coming back."}
{"text":"Quelle joie d'avoir découvert ce restaurant. Il est à une minute à pied du bord de l'eau, assez spacieux et confortable ce restaurant est une merveille. La carte est très généreuse, le service fut efficace et ceci n'est pas un détail les plats étaient excellents. Le poisson était fondant en bouche. 
Pour finir les prix sont tout à fait correct. Le tout etait très honnête.
J'allais oublier, dans ce restaurant il y a des box de
Bois avec des banquettes à l'intérieur. On peut les fermer avec des drapées pour plus d'intimité. Cela a beaucoup amusé mes filles :) bref pittoresque en plus."}
{"text":"My favourite Japanese restaurant. The menu may appear pricey at first, but you get a LOT of food for your money. I'm not a sushi fan, but friends I've taken here tell me it's great. My favourite is the chicken teriyaki, which comes with rice and miso soup. Tempura and gyoza appetizers are also delicious, and my dad loves the green salad with apple, avacado, and house dressing. Very popular with locals, family atmosphere. Private booths, take-out, delivery, patio, valet parking. It doesn't get any better than this."}
{"text":"I come here for the bibimbap, other cooked dishes or avocado roll-- and because it's super close. It's nice that they give you extra sides like the little noodle side dish, and they used to give a side 2 piece cooked fish roll, but may have stopped. The patio is decent. 
As for the sushi, I'd skip it, the taste is bland and it's pricy for what you get."}
{"text":"Have eaten here at least 20 times between April 2010 and Sept 2011, usually around 3-4pm, mainly because it's the only sit-down restaurant within a ten minute walk from my work.

Food is generally very fresh.  Pretty good dynamite roll, tempura appetizer, banana fritters for dessert.  I always miss the lunch specials b/c of the time of my work lunch or would've tried that long ago.  So it forces me into getting two a la carte items, usually two of the three above, since I don't want to spend $19.99 on the dinner combo.  Then again, my bill usually comes to around $17 after taxes, so it's 20 by the time I tip.  

Service is 90% of the time very friendly and stereotypical of the many Japanese restaurants I've been at in Toronto.  All smiles, politeness, female-only, dressed in cultural style.  Usually they are quite attentive, making sure the complimentary green tea is topped up, your food is good, etc.  A few times I had to wait very long, which I attribute to them being short staffed maybe?  The place is never really busy when I go, often three or four tables occupied inside, and if it's the summer, one or two outside are taken on the patio.  I always prefer the patio if it's nice out, as you can watch planes taking off from the city airport.

Debit & credit accepted.  Liquor licensed."}
{"text":"Ate here again last night and I just have to say I am so lucky to live a five minute walk from this hidden gem. 

I eat a lot of sushi, and this place is pure quality. Beautiful presentation, fresh fish, perfect portion sizes. 

Just such a cute little place too. Very unassuming staff who always thank you when you leave... Or at least they do to me... Maybe because I go so often. 

This is not a premium, high class restaurant people. But if you want amazing sushi, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"The atmosphere alone is enough to get me in the door. Traditional Japanese sliding doors, and the interior is mostly traditional Japanese dining rooms (complete with step to leave your shoes, and sliding doors!)

The food was fantastic (ordered sushi and vegetable tempura). Very well done. The service was super-friendly, too, and it's definitely a place I'll return to when I want some nice Japanese dining with that extra oomph to the experience."}
{"text":"4.5 Stars
Quiet place, good food, good sushi and good service. Will be back and recommend this restaurant to others. However this is not the top notch sushi place (therefore only 4.5 star)"}
{"text":"Been here countless times, always good food, always excellent a service. Prices are ok considering the area is expensive. They always have the house amuse bouche noodles and fried fish which elevates the experience. They frequently have specials- look for the sign when you first come in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Decent."}
{"text":"Love the options and wide range of Japanese menu. They make good food. The ramen was affordable and highly recommended. I had the seafood ramen and it was so tasty!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best tempura in Toronto.  Finally, we've found a place that does tempura as good as Vancouver sushi resto's.  The sushi is fresh as well, no complaints."}
{"text":"Came with my coworkers and found the service to be really good. The waiter was extremely quick and attentive and gave us some free stuff on the house which was really nice!!

The food is 3.5 for me, I got a ramen and it was too salty. Still enjoyable though!"}
{"text":"Been here several times. Fantastic menu, reasonable prices (especially as it's tourist Haven, Queen's Quay. Friendly unpretentious service too."}
{"text":"A 3-hour unscheduled break at work without any food prompted me to finally check out this place which some of my coworkers have raved about.

I ended up ordering the Dinner Box A ($21) which came with with your choice of salmon, beef, or chicken teriyaki, your choice of sashimi, sushi, or maki, shrimp and vegetable tempura, and surprisingly, no rice! For $2 more, the Dinner Box B option included rice, sashimi, sushi, AND maki; no tempura though. My dinner wasn't anything special; the chicken was a bit chewy and the teriyaki sauce was pretty watery in consistency. And for $21, it was a bit pricier than the typical bento box.

They do have a separate take-out section in the restaurant, which I imagine they get a lot of orders from, considering the slim pickings in take-out options in the area. While the staff was friendly on the phone and in-person, I, unfortunately, will not be placing any more take-out orders here."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place for lunch, but a little pricey for dinner (hence the 3-star rating). Did I mention that it is virtually in the lobby of where I live? Oh yeah, it is pretty convenient. 

For lunch, virtually all of the bento boxes are of excellent value -- $10-14 range that come with the entree, miso soup, tempura, and rice. It is a lot of food. My favorite is the beef terriyaki bento. 

The one issue I have with this place is that their sashimi is cut too thick, and many of the pieces are too chewy as a result (or it is a lower-grade cut). I've actually had to COOK the sashimi on a couple of occasions to make it palatable (when I've taken out) -- no joke! 

Otherwise, this is a very nice restaurant with a loyal local fan base. I highly recommend it for lunch, but would shy away from it for dinner unless you want to get a bit spendy."}
{"text":"Restaurants along the harbourfront are surprisingly limited for a tourist area. With options such as Shoeless Joes and Swiss Chalet I would say that Guirei is one of the better selections in the harbourfront neighbourhood. 

Guirei's appearance is like any average sushi restaurant I've been to in Toronto. Unexpectedly large on the inside, the restaurant is dimly lit with very simple décor, creating a casual dining atmosphere. The noise level of the restaurant is also quiet but that was probably due to the fact that there were only a few customers eating there.

The food was OK. They had a vast amount of items on their menu offering a few \"dishes\" that veered from the typical sushi menu but mostly all were staples. Portion sizes of the food were decent and the overall taste was not mind blowing but not bad. 

To start, I was craving something deep fried. I decided to try their \"Soft Shell Crab\" and the \"Agedashi Tofu\".  The Soft Shell Crab was exactly what I expected it to be - battered, deep fried and served with a dipping sauce. In terms of taste, there wasn't anything spectacular about it. The crab was subtle in texture and the meat was juicy...and tasted like crab (surprise!). The Agedashi Tofu consisted of fairly large tofu cubes, also deep fried, and topped with bonito flakes. On the first bite, the tofu is crispy but the middle is soft. The sauce it was served in wasn't too salty but was flavourful enough to complement the tofu. 

For the main, the \"storm roll\" caught my eye on the menu. It consisted of deep fried salmon with avocado, lettuce, and green onion all rolled into a very big fat sushi roll. It had a predominant salmon taste with a hint of spice. I didn't think the lettuce belonged in the roll as it didn't really add anything to it. It was an unnecessary, soggy ingredient that would not have been missed.

Overall, the food and the service were very good. The waitress was friendly and we didn't wait very long for the food. The prices were pretty standard for sushi dining. It wasn't the best in Toronto but definitely worth a try if you are in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"There's not many restaurant options in this part of town. I heard good reviews from people that live in the area, that is was reasonably priced and decent quality sushi. 

From the outside, Guirei doesn't look too exciting. There is patio which was closed given the cold weather. But don't judge a book by its cover, Guirei offered a cozy dining experience inside, with low lighting against dark furniture. As well, the windows are big so you get a nice view of the street/

We started off with warm sake-an excellent beginning on a cold and rainy evening! Service was fast and attentive. We ordered shortly and our food arrived within...5-10 minutes.

They did start the meal with an amuse bouche---fried sushi? lol tasted good. This was followed by a bowl of soup with thin noodles, not sure what exactly it was called, but tasted yummy.

I had the dragon roll-on the sushi quality scale, I would say it was above sushi on bloor, but not at the level of a high end sushi place. The fish selection was fresh tasting. I really enjoyed it. My friend had the dinner special with teriakyi salmon. It was a large serving size, he could barely finish it! He enjoyed his meal and agreed the quality level was above average.

All in all, a good dining experience. The food was affordably priced. The ambience itself was relaxed. I would say the tables were half filled, and this was on a weekday evening.

I would return to Guirei again for lunch or dinner. Definitely a go to place for waterfront locals :)"}
{"text":"I wanted to try this place as I live close-by, it failed on service, food, ambience, pretty much everything. Place was not busy, we were the only 2 people in the dining room, and there were a few people on the patio. Service was non existent, just took our orders, dropped off the food, didn't ask if everything was ok, did not refill our (lukewarm) tea.

Ordered the LA Ribs, they were ok, nothing special. The accompanying rice was cold and hard, the miso soup also lukewarm and overly salty. Also ordered the lobster roll and dragon roll with salmon. Worst rolls I've ever had, rolled so loosely that they fell apart right when we lifted them off the plate. Tiny slivers of fish and just a terrible presentation.

Cleanliness is terrible, the soy sauce container was filthy, and the sauce was black for some reason, probably a combination of being dirty and refilled too many times. Also an \"old\" dirty smell in the dining room, with flies buzzing around everywhere. Just an absolutely horrible dining experience."}
{"text":"I can't even remember the service, or whatever people are complaining about.. All I can remember is the taste.  It was easily the best sushi I've ever eaten and I've eaten at 99,898 Sushi restaurants in my life.  So thats about 10 percent of the Sushi restaurant population on King Street.. Ughhh, the worst is Sushi-Q; they don't give a fudge! But GuiRei best restaurant EVER!"}
{"text":"I went to there only one time, there is very close by my house also I love sushi. that's why I wanted to try here. 
I ordered \"chirashi don\". It was fine. 
The place is nothing special."}
{"text":"I got the bibimbap tonight.  it came with a couple of thin, very small pieces of beef, a few maybe 3 or 4 green leafs, 1 egg and the rest of the stone bowl was the rice.   When I asked for more beef, I was given a very small portion contained in a small soy sauce/wasabi dipping container.   Essentially, most of the stone bowl was just rice.  I feel gypped. Though in fairness, they did give a couple of small appetizers."}
{"text":"Had the lunch specials,, found both the bento box and sushi to be below average. Wasn't a bad price for lunch but was not satisfied. It was decent portions though. Would not go out of my way for this place"}
{"text":"We went with my 2 babies on Valentine's day, and it was such a good decision. We got a cubicle/private-ish seating area, it was a large table so we didnt feel confined at all. Privacy and space is something I value! 
The food and quality was excellent. I had sashimi beef, softshell crab, Dynamite roll and green Dragon roll. We also had udon soup, bulgogi, tempura... 
My parents last went there more than 6 years ago, it was under a different owner then. But now that we revisited it, and had such a great experience with the food, this place is going to be one of our favourite Japanese go-to's now! (and we live in Mississauga, while they live in Burlington). Im suprised it wasnt rammed, I suspect its because its in a relatively business-oriented area, so its busier weekdays than weekends? 
The staff were lovely. The food was great. I liked the decor/setting. 
Yes, yes, yes."}
{"text":"Well I think one of the reasons why this place only exists is the total lack of restaurants of any sort in this area. There is a similar place just across the road but it looks like it has the same owner because it's no better. Guys, please increase the quality of your seafood. I don't mine paying more, actually. Please get rid of your Sapporo bear on draft. It's just yellow water with alcohol. My wife got a piece of seashell in her miso soup. Think about it: a piece of seashell in a miso soup?! How come?! :-) Staff was friendly though. Anyone who likes sushi and seafood if you are absolutely stuck in that area then try it. Otherwise go up to King st and have something better for your money."}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE the bentobox.

The quality of the sashimi is nice but nothing to brag about. Definitely a bang for the buck: the Bento box lunch. Good quality green tea and nice sake list rounds out the experience

 Service can be sloth like so ask for the check when lunch arrives otherwise bring a flare-gun to get the attention of the geisha like servers."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff. I think their sushi and maki rolls are good, I love how little rice they add to their rolls, their fish has been always fresh (my husband orders sashimi and he usually had fresh fish) and I also like their Teriyaki vegetables and tofu. We haven't been here many times so I can't say I have tried many things but usually when we come in, the place is not busy at all. We always get a table right away and when we order take out it's ready in 10-15 minutes or so."}
{"text":"Preface:  Rating is based on sushi...in Oakville.

Decent, solid sushi place.  Best sushi ever?  No.  However, Guirei does its best to outshine the Popeye's, roti, fish & chips, & other fried crap that's in this plaza.  Sadly, I'm not sure if it's working 'cause I was the only lunch diner there and everyone who drove into lot seemed to flock to these fast food type eateries instead of sushi.  

(Btw, this is the most schizo plaza ever with an Organic Garage, Fish & Chips, Anytime Fitness, Ranee's Roti, & Popeye's all sharing the same lot!  I'd say that this would either be the worst/best location for a gym...ever.)

Oakville is more geared towards fast food, the odd pastry shop, overpriced cookies/muffins, so Guirei - NOT AYCE - probably gets lost in the shuffle.

The good:  Crunch Soup came complimentary with the lunch, dressing on salad actually had some kinda citrus zest in it, lunch specials were good value, & fish was of decent quality & freshness.

Waitress was sweet, but hella awkward.  Lingered a bit.  Came to check in at weird moments, but again, harmless.

If you're in the mood for sushi in this area, do give Guirei a try!"}
{"text":"We picked this place over the one across the street mainly because they still have their lunch specials over the weekend. I ordered a sashimi bento box and my hubs ordered a seafood ramen. The bento box came with a salad, miso soup, fried shrimp, and 4 different types of raw dish. I cleared my place. We both left the restaurant stuffed with delicious food and lots of sake."}
{"text":"For take out*
Sorry Guirei but I was not impressed.
This place looks well past its sell by date; the kitchen viewed from the delivery area has a real unclean feel to it. This was probably the worst sushi I have ever had. The gyoza was dried-out and basically inedible. The sashimi sliced far too thickly. The sushi pizza was also v poor. And $65 for 2 peeps, never again."}
{"text":"Service is bad. The guys cheer you at the entrance only to forget about your existence second after. When you finally call them and ask to do their job, they look very busy, even with the place almost empty.

Once we've arrived there 10 minutes before the lunch time end, and were denied the lunch menu nevertheless. The server haven't change her mind even after politely pointing out that we still have some time before the deadline.

Place is not that awfully dirty, but quite \"used\", not maintained well. You can actually stick to the table if you are lucky to get the one greasy enough.

Food itself is just \"ok\" for the price. It is difficult to find decent sushi in Toronto, and Guirei is definitely not an impressive spot menu-wise. Nothing really bad, neither anything to dream about.

There is also a government housing next block, which is not fun to have around while waiting for a streetcar, or getting out of the parking to the normally packed Lakeshore West."}
{"text":"Not impressed with this place at all!

I've eaten here many times and it gets increasingly disappointing every time.  The sushi pizza is more like a flat bread sushi pizza, so it's almost  like fried toffee when you try and chew it.... very gross.  The gyoza is okay, cooked well and very tasty, but the seaweed salad is horrible.  The maki's and hand rolls are never spectacular.   
And you know this would all be forgivable if this place was cheap, but it's pricey for what you're getting.  I would pass on this one."}
{"text":"more expensive than places like sushi on bloor but better quality than sushi on bloor.  a decent selection of korean and japanese dishes.

service is spotty and not overly fast.  seems to be a lot of turnover.

if it's a warm summer's day, the patio is amazing.  definitely 5 stars then."}
{"text":"Finally!!! I've found it! Great sushi in Oakville!!

We gave this unassuming little place a try after being recommended it by some neighbours. While I had driven past it many times, it didn't seem that special so we had never made our way in. I am in that neighbours debt for this recommendation!! 

It's a small place with a few tables, a small sushi bar, and many booths surrounding the room. The menu is extensive, but not that detailed (they don't specify what kinds of sushi and sashimi), but that is because they only use what is fresh and available! 

We started with a tempura appetizer which was crispy and delicious. They also brought us bowls of noodles on the house which were fantastic. The miso soup was delicious and the salads very fresh, I'm pretty sure they're use freshly squeezed lemon on the ginger dressing. 

Finally, our beautiful sushi came! I had the sushi/sashimi dinner, and everything was wonderful. The fish is so fresh, the rice is perfect and slightly sweet, even the wasabi il was the best I've had in some time - it just melts into your soy sauce. 

To top off this great doing experience, the service is impeccable. Our server was friendly and attentive, without being overbearing. 

While the prices are a bit high (my meal was $21.99), it is worth it and I'll be back! I've come to accept that nothing good comes cheap in Oakville."}
{"text":"I lived directly across this spot for a couple years, so it was hard not to give this one a try. 

Food is average and is your typical neighbourhood sushi joint. Same bento box offerings, Maki/sushi/ sashimi combos - nothing too amazing to mention. I did order their Seafood Udon regularly though when I wanted something with broth and it always did the trick. Spicy, savoury, and full of seafood - it was one thing I could order again and again."}
{"text":"Very disappointing. Please do not get the pork bone soup. It's advertised that it came with potato, but it was not in the soup. When we asked about the potato's, the waitress said, \"so sorry\" and said the potatoes would come out in 5 minutes. 10 minutes later, our potato cake out. The food was not that great. Very disappointed.

Update: just tried the potato, it's actually a TARO!!"}
{"text":"My friend an I came here on Saturday for lunch. We both decided to go with the bento box because of their lunch specials. The place was very nice and cozy. I like the overall atmosphere of it. 

It wasn't too busy when we came in but after we were seated, more people started to come in. We settled in a booth, super clean, comfy seats and a nice view of the lake. 

I ordered the beef teriyaki bento box and my friend ordered the chicken bento box. Aside from the protein, the box came with 5 pieces of different tempura. 2 shrimps and other veggies. There was edamame, a bowl of rice, three pieces of yam maki sushi, a fried eggplant in one corner and the teriyaki. On the side with the bento box, there was a small noodle soup, traditional garden salad and the miso soup. All for 12.00! 

I love this place and the food, you can really tell that everything was made fresh and that the tempura was made to order and haven't been sitting around in oil or on the side. The beef teriyaki was so delicious, next time I will get the salmon. I wasn't able to finish the bento box, there was just way too much food and I was pretty stuffed eating half of it. I think two people can definitely share this. 

Do come here, it is not all you could eat but for 12.00 you will get stuffed by the bento box!"}
{"text":"A nice little Japanese restaurant on the Queens Quay, this is one of my wife's favourite non AYCE. A typical Japanese restaurant in terms of decor and food selection. My wife thoroughly enjoys the place because she finds the sushi to be very fresh tasting, and is one of the few places that actually offers a whole soft shell crab as a dish which she absolutely loves."}
{"text":"What's with the hate, guys?

I mean granted I wouldn't really come here for dinner and I do live a block away, but I really do think that their lunch specials are pretty great. I've tried the LA ribs and the black cod teriyaki, and both were quite good. The bento boxes are a particularly good deal since they come with salad, tempura, and 2 small pieces of yam sushi, soup and rice along with the portion of whatever you're getting. Having gotten takeout before, you definitely get a smaller portion of everything, so from a value perspective, I don't really recommend going this route. 

Service is pleasant, and I got what I needed out of them, so I have no complaints."}
{"text":"Been here twice -- one time for dinner at the sushi bar and the second time for take out and both has been a very mediocre experience.
The location is good, near the Harbourfront and the Music Garden and marina, surrounded by tons of condo developments. It's the only restaurant west of Spadina near the Harbourfront, which is too bad as this area really needs more quality restaurants. I live just a block away.

My dinner there just okay. The service was prompt and courteous. The on-the-house amuse bouche at the start of the meal was a bit of a joke: a deep fried piece of maki, over-fried to the point where it was hard to tell what it was.  I had an horrifying thought that it must have been a left over piece of sushi that was battered and deep fried. The second amuse was a simple spoonful of soba in a soy mushroom broth -- not bad. I could do without these complementary offerings.

The restaurnant is run by Koreans which explains for the Korean dishes on the menu. I didn't feel like having Korean food and had an assortment of sushi, maki and sashimi instead. The quality was generally okay in terms of freshness and quality of cuts. The sushi rice was at least properly seasoned (though a bit on the light side) which is key starting point to a good sushi, the cut of fish is ample, however I've found the quality of the cuts of some of their raw fish to be rather poor. Their hamachi doesn't seem to be actually hamachi and I found their \"hamachi\" along with their other white fish to be rather tough and stringy which is a sign that you are not getting a quality cut of sushi-grade fish. I had to spit out a couple pieces into my napkin because it was way too stringy.
The two sushi chefs at the bar were polite, but very quiet and not as social as your typical Japanese sushi chefs -- they seemed to be more fixated on the Just for Laughs Gags that was annoyingly playing on their large flatscreen TV.  The surface of the bar was a bit on the sticky side (just like another reviewer's comments on the dining tables) and so was their plastic covered menus. It was a little off putting.
The cost of the dinner was very pricey considering the second rate quality and cuts of the fish.

I decided to give Guirei another chance by ordering takeout for dinner. Unfortunately the whitefish/hamachi sushi and sashimi pieces were still tough and stringy (I only ate one piece and spat or threw out the rest) along with a few pieces of tuna. The wakame salad was good, though the portion was rather small and it seems like they didn't have any leak-proof containers for it as the dressing leaked out of it (at least they did put it in a separate plastic bag that was tightly tied closed).

Next time I will definitely go to Ichiban Fish further east on Queen's Quay. The quality and taste of their sushi and other dishes are much better than Geirei, and never disappoints, and is cheaper as well."}
{"text":"I come here quite a bit after work since I live really close and their menu is pretty expansive for what it is. Unfortunately their sushi and fish menu is a bit overpriced for the amount and quality you're getting. I usually get the pork bone soup but it's laden filled with MSG, and makes me quite thirsty afterwards. I went there for sashimi as well and it was still a bit frozen. I wouldn't personally recommend."}
