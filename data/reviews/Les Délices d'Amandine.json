{"text":"J'y vais souvent le midi . Il y a beaucoup de monde le midi . Arriver tôt ! C'est très bon , les sandwiches sont succulents et les repas chaud changent souvent .Le service est très chaleureux . Les prix sont très abordables . C'est plus un cafe qu'une pâtisserie par contre, il n'y a pas tant de pâtisserie ."}
{"text":"Les Delices d'Amandine had a booth at the Pride celebration on rue Sainte-Catherine Est and they were giving away whole macarons for tasting! Yes! WHOLE MACARONS! Anyone in the states know those suckers go for $3 a pop. How freaking generous. I tried one... or two. (Okay, I had three when nobody was looking.) I also tried their other pastry samples from oatey bars with chocolate to jam ones and things that were really sweet. And soooo goood. Surprisingly, the treats were inexpensive and of decent size. One would definitely get a tooth ache or belly ache from all the goodies at Les Delices d'Amandine. But it would be due to over consumption and lack of self control. How could you not like anything from here? I loved it all.  Les Delices d'Amandine also conveniently sells packs of cookies and boxes of macarons for take home, hostess gifts, and presents! They really make lovely gift items. The macarons come assorted with all the bright colors (turquoise, orange, purple, lime green) and flavors (peach, lavender, hazelnut, etc.). Usually people tend to dislike the wackier macarons but I'm telling you all of them from Les Delices d'Amandine were delicious. If they weren't, I wouldn't have had so many tastings. We did end up buying a bunch of boxes. No worries, our tastings were justified."}
{"text":"Went there a few time and I tried almost everything they have to offer. Sandwiches are okay, nothing impressing. Their salads are good, but again I've had better in groceries. The service is good and there is a lot of room available if you want to meet people. Don't go for their frozen food, it's mostly bad stuff.   I received a certificate from this place from coworkers after my baby was born to help with food on a loaded schedule. It did just that, nothing more and nothing less."}
{"text":"Thumbs up for this place!! I found it recently while looking for places on yelp and omg what a great find. They have awesome pastries (their croissants and chocolong are too die for) and homemade hot chocolate! If you ever go there you will not be disappointed. We also took a classic sandwich which was delicious as well. I can't believe I just discovered this place and I live right around the corner. Besides it is not overcrowded (i can't believe it's not??) and really quiet if you want to get some work done. It just became my favourite bakery before premières moissons. Kudos to the owner and cooks of this place!!"}
{"text":"Went in for a bread run as I was in the area,and there virtually NO selection. I wanted an olive fougasse but all they had was baguettes and a few loaves of white bread. Lots of croissants; they have different croissant specials everyday, tons of prepared salads and sandwiches,but not much in way bread. I have to add however; this is also a caterer,so the emphasis on prepared to go food is understandable."}
{"text":"Bon café, bonnes pâtisseries, et sandwiches bons."}
{"text":"I came here on two separate occasions for pastries and had wildly different experiences with the pastries.   On a Friday morning, the almond croissant was pretty \"meh\" and a bit chewy. The chocolate croissant was solid. On the next day, however, they blew me out of the water with their chocolate-almond croissant; it had a perfect crust and flakiness. Even their traditional croissant was flawless and oh-so buttery. They also had a nice baguette but, as other people have mentioned, their stock was low; we got their last baguette at around 10am. Glad we snatched one, though, because it was delicious.  We were intrigued by their beautiful cakes - many in a display case and ready to go - and prepared pastas and sandwiches. This bakery must be a good spot for something on the go, though lots of people were sitting in the store and enjoying themselves."}
