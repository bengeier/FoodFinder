{"text":"Amazing view of Old Montreal from rooftop/terrace dining!!! A must visit for both locals & tourists. A perfect ending of our evening."}
{"text":"It's not closed!  It was a beautiful evening in Montreal...everyone was out and on the streets of Old Port. I'm guessing they opened because of the weather. So glad I was here to appreciate it. Food was good. Those truffle fries are lovely. Paillard poulet was yum!  My friends got the lobster \"rolls\".  One is from Boston so he was hard to please. It's not a roll...it's a sandwich on pumpernickel. Not the standard so beware.   Simon was our server. Ask for him. He is a star in the service industry. Details matter. He was impeccable.   I gave 4 stars for the ambience and view. All worth the wait for our community table. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We went to try out the new terrasse a couple of days ago and Im not going to lie... I really enjoyed it! We had a bear and the popcorn shrimp. The shrimp was good, but dont come here to eat if you are really hungry because you will go right after to Mcdonalds :). The portions are small but cute for 2 to share ... i would call them more amuse bouches. The view is amazing btw ! Will go back for sure."}
{"text":"There are two roof patios here - with different menus and different entrances. Both have nice views. Both have staff at the street level entrances who run a wait list.  If the patios are at capacity the staff runs a wait list and they suggest you wait In the lobby - where there is no bar service. A better alternative would be to text the patron when their name comes up on the wait list -because WG, you're a new, well run hotel....right?"}
{"text":"So, this spot is definitely lovely, but leaves something to be desired.  The view is gorgeous and it was bustling and definitely a place to see and be seen.  However, they were out of half of the food when we were there and also, it took us about 45 min to get our snacks though every table around us had already come and gone.  In 'apology', they brought over shots, but as I didn't want a shot, the server said he'd find something else, but never returned.  I didn't need something, but considering we were there hours just trying to have cocktails and a snack, I think they could have tried to accommodate a little more.  The  other guests were starting to get rowdy when we left, so not sure how this spot is the later in the evening you're there....  Worth a visit, but be prepared for some lackluster service while enjoying the nice views."}
{"text":"Initially I thought perche was the same terasse as william gray- I was wrong.  I stopped by here to charge my phone at reception. The front desk was so nice and friendly to accommodate me even though i was not staying at the hotel as a guest. I loved the view from their terrasse on the 7th floor- we ordered two glasses of house wine on last call. I wish I had my phone to capture  the lovely view. Next time."}
{"text":"Favorite rooftop bar in Montreal (we visited 2 others). The truffle fries were good, sliders were a little dry, service was a little slow, but friendly. The view though, is unbeatable and the drinks were solid.   To get in we checked in with the hostess who took our numbers for a 20 minute wait. She texted us when the table was ready and mentioned we have 5 minutes to get there. We just grabbed a drink at the restaurant downstairs while we waited."}
{"text":"Incredible view. What a beautiful patio. Unpretentious food, great drinks and fun staff. This is a good spot for drinks & snacks. They are starting their brunch service and I can see how this will most likely become a popular spot. 12$ valet parking is a plus. Nice hotel with trendy crowds."}
{"text":"Went out with 2 friends and we got some different starters The octopus was amazing, melting on your mouth The guedille d'homard was good The mini burgers a bit over cooked  We also got the cod that was good and the salmon tartar that was pretty small, the salad was okay but the meat was super small"}
{"text":"Went to check out the Miracle bar located on the rooftop terrasse of the William Gray Hotel with a group of friends and truly loved the experience !  The terrasse was beautifuly decorated along with it's heated lamps adding a special touch to the decor. The terrase is open so be sure to dress warm! We had the warm wine drink served in the most adorable Santa shaped mug which was delicious! I recommend sitting in the back side area which is the warmest area. The DJ was playing all the favorite Christmas tunes and the view of Old Montreal covered in a  white blanket of snow was breathtaking! We stayed to watch the fireworks which begin at 8pm and felt like we were being swept away into a magical winter wonderland with Celine Dion's Beauty and the Beast song playing in the background as the fireworks display begin. The view of the Giant lighted ferris wheel and the skating rink added a special touch. To all men reading this ...take note ...this is a truly remarkable place to take your lady to for a date, marriage purposal, anniversary etc. If you are a tourist..this is definately a place to check out. As well..if you are a group of girlfriends or friends and looking for something different to do during the holidays be sure to check out this place!"}
{"text":"OK so I have been these four tresses Nelligan, William Gray, Place D'Armes, and Sur L'Auberge.  They are all within 5min walk of each other and all almost the same, I wonder if they are operated by the same company?  Here is my dilemma, the settings are great for all of them nice view and good ambiance, the food and drinks however severely lacking especially for the price! So I am ranking Neligan as the best (4 stars) - best drinks and ambiance! The other 3 all get three stars because...15 dollars a drink and it tastes like they poured a premade cocktail mix... and the food is very lacking $20 dollar lobster role on a chewy dry hot dog bun with little scraps of lobster claw! Although I should say that the drinks and bartender quality is better at Neligan and so is the ambiance! I will post the same review for all four places."}
{"text":"Waited for our table for an hour which was okay because we had drinks downstairs which had a great ambience. Ordered drinks upstairs and it took them 15 minutes to arrive the food was mediocre little burgers were burnt the salad was very nice and the service was very poor and slow. When we ask for the bill they couldn't show us what we were paying for because their system had an issue with the bills. Very good view tho"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Waited 15 minutes for our waiter without water on a hot night. After an hour, we received one of our 8 plates to share. No excuses nor drinks were given to us. Quite the contrary, the waiter answered our queries with flippant attitude. Very disappointing for a beautiful terrasse. In fact, it is a disgrace. Great view but not worth it."}
{"text":"We came here for drinks on a beautiful Saturday afternoon after being turned away from Terrasse Sur L'Auberge because they were hosting a wedding. We're lucky to have found this spot, as the views were magnificent! We only had drinks, but our service was fantastic. Our server was kind, funny, and made us some great recommendations for other places to check out on our vacation. Would definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Most would say that this spot on top of the hotel of the same name is simply a tourist trap. And indeed,  the high prices on mediocre food and average wine, indeed would have me agreeing. But then again, isn't everything pricier in old Montreal? Either way, you come to this terrace for the view and the scene. The space is minimalist with simple white chairs and tables but the view is priceless, with a full 180 view of the old port! The wine was okay but the vibe, especially on a sunny afternoon, was electric and contagious. Playing tourist in your own city can be fun so I'd definitely return for a glass of Sancerre and some pricey oysters to enjoy the short summer season."}
{"text":"The most beautiful view for drinks in the city! Absolutely loved this place - the ambiance, the drinks, and the friendliest waiters I've ever met."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here to hang out after work on a beautiful week day as I heard the view is awesome.  It is located on the 8th floor of the hotel and just as described, the view over the water in the Old Port is quite fantastic.   The staff was very courteous and friendly. The wine list is not the best I have seen but I don't mind it too much as you can still get around it.  The food was not bad either. We had the parmesan fries, the lobster roll and the duck confit salad. If it wasn't for the view though, I probably wouldn't come here specifically for the food and drink BUT the view is reat so yes I would definitely recommend it :) So 3 staras for the food and drinks, one more for the staff and a whole star for the view itself ;)"}
{"text":"Tourist trap. I have no kind words for this newly opened hole. Service was long. Waitress was unilingual french. The food was horrendous. The tomato sauce tasted strychnine!!! Been here 4 times and three times it was real bad."}
{"text":"Offers exceptional views of Old Montreal, but that's where it ends. Ordered a Hemingway drink which was eh, and also the ceviche which besides being tiny ($16) was nothing to write home about. Ceviche being one of my favorite dishes, this one missed the mark as the lime overpowered any other flavor.  Don't know the servers name as he never introduced himself, also didn't see him after the dropped the ceviche off. No checking to see how everything was. Service leaves a lot to be desired.   I don't see the appeal of this place, maybe for a cocktail if they have happy hour."}
{"text":"Ouverture sur la terrasse à 11:30am mais en fait la cuisine, lors de ma visite, a ouvert à midi... il y a de vitres tout autour de la terrasse ... le toit en toile est retractable mais fermé lors de ma visite.. j'imagine ouvert en soiree; la bouffe correct."}
