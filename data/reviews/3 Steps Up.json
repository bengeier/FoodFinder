{"text":"Love this place! A great place for afternoon tea but they do have lunch and I believe they cater as well.
Tea on the weekends can be busy as they are usually booked solid. Would definitely recommend making reservations. Haven't had their brunch yet but every time I've had tea half the place is people having brunch. 
The sandwich options for afternoon tea are delicious and very varied...not average at all. Scones are good and the desserts are amazing."}
{"text":"With all the great groupon deals offered for Afternoon Tea, it was hard not to try another deal.  Whitby is kinda far for us but it's nice to venture out to new areas.

Came here few weeks ago around 2pm.  It was pretty busy on a Saturday afternoon.  Despite being busy, the service was still superb.  They come by regularly to check if we wanted more hot water for the tea pot or coffee refilled.  That's great service!

The atmosphere was very relaxing - what a contrast from our bad experience at Ruelo.  It was also nice that they had no problem with the 3 of us sharing the Afternoon Tea for 2.  The 3-tiered tray was filled with lovely sandwiches, scones and desserts.  The portions were very generous.   It was definitely more than enough food for the 3 of us.  The meal also came with squash soup that was perfectly done.  The sandwiches were delicious but the scones and sweets were only okay.

Overall, we would definitely come back if we are in neighbourhood."}
