{"text":"Delicious, Real food.  Chef Sara walks the walk and delivers perfection in everything on the menu.  Quality and value, the restaurant is a peaceful sanctuary, clean and beautiful.  Staff is friendly and helpful.  Her desserts are the perfect ending to a wonderful food experience!"}
{"text":"The food and atmosphere is excellent. Chef Sara is super cool. Really enjoyed the hibiscus tea!  Definitely coming back when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The food is beautiful and extremely flavorful!  Chef Sara shows her passion for high quality yumminess on every single plate!  By far my favorite place to eat out on earth...no joke!  Thanks!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place and the food here is incredible! Although since Chef Sarah makes everything herself be sure to only come here when you have plenty of time! But it's worth the wait!:)"}
{"text":"This is the real deal! Finally! A cafe in No. Scottsdale, (Cave Creek), that really does serve healthy food. You can dine on healthy green drinks and smoothies, eat an absolutely delicious raw vegan meal, and feel completely satisfied and nourished, even if you're not vegan or raw.  We love this place for it's ambiance, Chef Sara's energy, and the fresh, organic original tasty dishes. 

We've eaten the Pizza, Rawgasmic sandwich, quiche, wraps, and chocolate mouse for desert. Everything is so good, you would have no idea it was so healthy!

The menu is extensive, so not all items are served every day. Just go with the flow.

It's on the pricey side, but remember, raw organic food is a labor of love, and it nourishes your heart and soul. It's worth every penny! We'll return over and over! Thank you, Chef Sara, for bringing this gem in the desert to us!"}
{"text":"Chef Sara's passion for helping people to embrace a healthy lifestyle is expressed through her delicious preparation and beautiful presentation of her broad vegan menu choices.  What a jewel of a restaurant!  The portions are generous, the food is local, fresh and delicious and the atmosphere permeates good energy.  The time she spends preparing EVERYTHING from scratch is apparent from the first bite.  In all my travels, I have never tasted such wonderfully prepared food. From appetizer to dessert, you will not be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very slow service. Was overcharged for clearly marked items by Chef Sara herself, who then couldn't (or wouldn't) print me a receipt after the fact. 

Really disappointed. The food was fine but I'd never go back based on the level of service I experienced from the chef/owner and the way she talks to her employees."}
{"text":"Amazing!  Healthy food made with love by a chef who truly cares about what she does.  Chef Sara is passionate about healthy  food. The care with which she created her multi-page menu was evident in the the written descriptions of the dishes (or teas, juices, smoothies...) and she  also took the time to describe the benefits of key nutrients each dish/drink/tea/etc.  Very extensive menu with descriptions, pictures, great for those not familiar with raw food. Yum."}
{"text":"First is the beautiful setting with precious indoor and outdoor seating. From the moment we arrived Chef Jose was all smiles and welcoming. He explained the entire menu and was wonderfully patient even though we took forever to decide. Everything looked that good!   Chef Sara prepared our entrees and was so enthusiastic and feels passionate about what she does. The meals are so innovative and flavorful--and the presentation is beautiful!
We got 2 apps, the burger and ravioli. My husband loved his burger (yay! Since he's not into raw as much as I am). My ravioli was so delicious, that I actually ordered another to take on the plane home! We just finished 2 desserts and are taking 3 to go. Who knows when we can get back again? 
Can't stress it enough, this place is a must even if you aren't vegan!!!"}
{"text":"As a resident of WI, I am a believer that every meal requires meat, cheese and/or beer.  And usually frying at least one of those.  WIth this in mind, I truly have no idea why I tried a Chef Sara's Vegan Cafe.  Either way, I am  extremely glad I did.  I have since been back twice for lunch so this review will focus on the lunch options.

At face value, the lunch was pricey.  Each entree was $16 so you can plan on spending at least $20 for lunch once you include tip.  But once you eat, you realize that you are paying for HIGH QUALITY food (which I am ok with).  If you prefer a larger amount of crappier food, I suggest Golden Corral.  The food from Chef Sara is outstanding and homemade, and many people don't realize how labor intensive/time consuming creating raw-vegan food is. The price is fair given the VALUE .  And value is clear once you try the food.

Additionally, the human body knows exactly what to do with the ingredients, so you are left feeling satiated.  The trick is to eat, then wait about 15-20 minutes before you decide if you are still hungry. I finished eating at 12:30 and was full until dinner at 6:30. Keep in mind I usually eat about 4-5 plates at an Indian buffet and down 40oz steaks like they are SLIDERS.  I once ate 14 HOTDOGS at a baseball game... and yeah, Chef Sara's little sandwich kept me until dinner.  Wasn't expecting that...

SERVICE: The service was exceptional, though both times the place was fairly empty, so I was able to talk to Chef Sara personally.  She was very kind and very helpful when deciding what I should try.  THe food was made quickly, I was in and out in about 30 mins (I even took my time eating).

DECOR: The decor....well... it is relaxing and all that, for those that care (I don't).  

FOOD: The flavor of the food was great.  Nothing was bland.  The rawrgasmic sandwich was flavorful.  The quiche was very dense and filling.  My only complaint was that the quiche had a VERY strong garlic flavor, which was fine with ME....but not so much with the people I had to talk to for the rest of the day.

BOTTOM LINE:  Men will like it because you can impress people with how open-minded/worldly you are that you eat raw-vegan.  Plus it is filling and very healthy.  Women will like it becasue of the presentation of the food and the health value. It can be a pricey lunch but the value is certainly there.  I will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in the area! I drove here from Nevada and I had to stop and enjoy a delicious, healthy and flavorful meal! Made with real food by wonderful people. I come here every time I visit Az, and it's so worth it! 

Please come, have an amazing experience, educate yourself in the process and you'll be happily surprised! 

Amazing menu, check their website and see what a big selection they have, including desserts made from scratch ( just like everything else)!

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I love the food!! It's nice to have good tasting food that is good for you. The owner is very personable and funny,"}
{"text":"Truly an Oasis in the Desert!! 
Nutritious and satisfying - every cell in my body was applauding the meals we have had here. 
Chef Sarah comes out to greet her costumers in person and truly care about your well-being and experience while dining. Everyone working here contributes to the ambiance. 
P.s: To prepare these foods takes time...., is the freshest and tastiest I have had and we live in the Bay area CA where fresh produce is abundant! I will pay the dollar amount over and over again."}
{"text":"As a vegan raw foodist, I was very happy to discover this place in Arizona.   We live in California (where there are many raw restaurants) and it is great to be able to eat at a raw restaurant when we visit family in Phoenix.  

The selection is great and was also very much enjoyed by the two non-raw foodists/non-vegans in my party.  I was surprised at how large the portions are.  So many raw restaurants tend to serve skimpy portions.  The other two people in my party could not entirely finish their meals and requested boxes to take them home.  

It is a comfort to know that all the food served in the restaurant is organic, non-GMO, gluten-free and fresh.  

Chef Sara was very welcoming, friendly, and accommodating.  I have certain food allergies and she was very willing to make a special dish for me.  If you have special dietary needs, she advises that you call her two days in advance so she can plan to have the food items available to accommodate your needs.  I really had the feeling that she cares about her customers and goes out of her way to give them a great experience and delicious, healthful food.

The place is peaceful, clean, and nicely decorated.  We all had a wonderful experience and will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Chef Sara's raw vegan restaurant is our go to for take out.  We just call on the way home,  pick it up and enjoy a delicious HEALTHY meal! Sara has mastered the art of raw food preparation.  It's so hard to choose a favorite because they are all so uniquely prepared and are soooo tasty!  However, if I had to choose a favorite I guess I might say \"Happy Cow\" or maybe her \"version of Lasagna.\" Besides the taste,  we actually FEEL better after eating her food. You may feel full, but not that lazy stuffed feeling. We also sleep better the night we eat there.  It's real food,  not processed.  Your body knows the difference!  Thank you for Sara!"}
{"text":"We loved this place!  The orgasmic sandwich was incredible!  We loved that we felt full and nourished and - could barely finish our food.  We are vegan and we'd love to be raw - we wish she'd open a place closer to Phoenix!  We HIGHLY recommend this place.  We'll be back."}
{"text":"Tasty raw vegan with the right touch of lemon, herbs, and fresh veg. Vibrant versions of Middle Eastern, herbal teas, and wheatgrass juice. Chef Sara teaches vegan meal creation. I hope I can take the course some day. A welcome relief from the touristy cowboy fare in the area. This native Phoenician will be back!"}
{"text":"Not open in August   Disappointed ....Stopped by and it was closed.  However, the venue looks very intriguing and we will definitely return to try it out"}
{"text":"Chef Sara's was an incredible experience, and hands down the most delicious raw, whole food restaurant I've ever been to.

Sara comes to your table herself as you've been seated, and walks through the days dishes that are available in exquisite detail. Right away you can tell the passion in which she prepares and serves this food, her descriptions alone were like an appetizer.

I opted for the carrot ginger soup and raviolis. The soup was an amazing starter, garnished with sprouted pumpkin seeds, which added just the right touch of salty and nutty to a very cooling soup. The raviolis came in a beautiful presentation, and had a small kale salad that accompanied it. The salad was a perfect pairing wIth the nuttier, and nastier raviolis. I ate them in alternating bus and enjoyed every last crumb. 

At this point most might call it a night, but I'm a dessert guy through and through, and I couldn't leave wIthout trying the much lauded coffee cake. It was served slightly chilled in the middle, and every bite was better than the previous. The only bad part of the entire meal was each time I looked down and my dish was empty!

I'm alreadY planning my next trip to Chef Sara's with MUCH anticipation, as there's SO much more to try!"}
{"text":"A lot of choices, but pricey. If you are looking to try a totally new experience, this is the place. The soups are excellent, full of taste and flavor and the hummus is wonderful. I had the raw sandwich which was excellent. It is a little on the pricey side and they only have 1 booster chair, so if you need multiple high chairs, this would be an issue."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good if your someone who is big on meet don't mock vegan food till you try it 
Amazing flavors amazing chef and you will be amazed at the things this women can do with no meet and no heat it's definitely a place everyone should try at least once"}
{"text":"The Wife and I were in search of a healthy and hearty meal on Friday night and we decided to try the raw vegan academy cafe.  

The ambiance is very nice and even uplifting.  The walls are painted rich inviting colors and the place just has a nice energy.

The food was delicious.  Chef Sara was there herself and you could tell the food was made with love and care.  I had Sara's Salad and my wife had the pizza.  The ingredients were all of very high quality, the vegetables very fresh, and the food was delicious.  In keeping with high quality and healthy food, both my wife and I felt great afterward.

The prices are very reasonable for the quality of food you get.  The cost winds up being $15 -$20 per person for a full meal.

Reading some of the other reviews, frankly I am a little puzzled.  If you're looking for a bargain and your standard low quality everyday food, Dairy Queen is right next door.  If you're looking for tasty, fresh, nutritious food this place is it.  We'll definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Two people: $60. for dinner. Enough said. Bland food, and the organic drink for $10. was a brown slush that just looked awful. Overdone vegan for too much money, even with the piano player."}
{"text":"If you are looking for only raw vegan food, this is your place.  Nothing is cooked, everyhthing is 100% raw.  They offer a variety of creative options from appetizers, wraps, soups, pizza and pasta.  They have freshly squeezed juices, smoothies and a variety of different health shots.  The dessert is yummy as well.  This is a must try!"}
{"text":"I went here over the weekend with my best friend.  The atmosphere was quiet and cozy.  I have never been to a raw vegan restaurant and was unsure of the food, if I would like it and would I get enough.  Everything surpassed my expectations.  The food was wonderful, and the \"dessert\" was healthy and amazing!  I can't wait to go back.  Chef Sara was an inspiration, I wish nothing but the best for her.  Even if you aren't vegan, this place is fabulous!!  Give it a try."}
{"text":"I had a fabulous experience today! Chef Sara was very friendly and super helpful with the menu. She did let us know she was out of some ingredients though and so the menu was rather limited. This disappointed me at first, so I ordered something that would have been probably my 3rd choice. I got the \"Rawgasmic\" sandwich and let me tell you I was not disappointed in the least! The bread was a amazing and the spreads were so flavorful. The sandwich was topped with so many colorful, fresh organic veggies too. I was completely full and satisfied after eating this. My friend ordered the marinara zuchinni noodle bowl and I swear she inhaled it before I could ask for a taste.

I also loved the decor and even took some photos around the place to copy in my own decor. Yes, it is pricier than your average lunch joint, but I'd rather pay extra here than at some second rate chain. Here I know all the ingredients have a purpose and are all fresh, organic and carefully chosen. The menu is so creative and the plate ends up looking like a work of art. So yeah, I'll pay a couple extra dollars for that. I wish I had room for dessert because the dessert tray looked incredible."}
{"text":"Seriously amazing. was so completely impressed with food, service and ambiance. Truly is as good as it gets! Getting takeout as I can;t stop thinking about the pesto zuchinini noodles!!"}
{"text":"While on vacation, my boyfriend and I were looking for vegan food. When we chose this place, we had no idea it was also raw food. I almost walked out, because in general I don't tend to care for raw food places. In addition, things seemed a little \"weird\" from the getgo. Our chef was also our server, we were the only people in there, and the menu was a giant binder full of dishes but with only a few of them actually available. However, we were so hungry, we decided to stay. The prices were very high for lunch, but once the food arrived, I forgot about the prices and my previous reservation about raw food. It was amazing. Every bite was heavenly. One of the best meals of our entire trip. I got the Happy Cow burger. It was less like a burger and more like chewy crackers with a salad. The vegan pâté and guacamole in the dish were out of this world. I loved it so much, I want to get her cookbook. And I can't wait to return to Cave Creek so that we can go again."}
{"text":"This was the first and last time I will dine at this restaurant. The prices were ridiculously expensive and Chef Sara preached about how bad my diet is during my entire meal. As though her cuisine is the only healthy one on the planet. I asked the great Chef Sara about her courses, and she pointed at my stomach, and said \"you need to take them so you lose that.\"  I was stunned that she would intentionally offend a patron. And this was said in the presence of three other diners!  If you want to eat at a restaurant where you're insulted, get an outrageously priced bill, and still leave hungry...this is the place to go."}
{"text":"I was there for the Grand Opening and it was delightful, this location is in  Cave Creek and with the Sonoran desert as your backdrop how can you go wrong.This was my first experience with raw vegan food, and I must say it was very good.  Raw foods being used for healing the body and gluten free foods to promote health not a bad combination at all. The nutty falafel was with almond hummus was my favorite of all that I tasted. Chef Sara was warm and welcoming to her guest so this event was a hit. I know she will do well with this location."}
{"text":"Found Chef Sara's Raw Vegan Academy Café on Google Earth while checking route to visit Cave Creek, and I was happy that I did! The menu, freshness of foods, preparation, presentation, and taste are exceptional. The menu has a wealth of information about the health benefits and best choices for a plant-based diet. The foods are prepared without grains, which intrigued and amazed me. I cannot wait to dine there again - to try more menu items and enjoy the quality and taste. This restaurant is high on my list of favorites in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"What a gem of a find! I'm from LA and came for Thanksgiving to see my family and Chef Sarah has made it possible for me to eat amazing raw food my entire trip. Chef Sarah sits down at the table and carefully explains everything on the menu at this quaint little wood cottage restaurant. I've eaten here for 3 days and loved everything. They even have a greenhouse in the back where they grow sprouts and wheatgrass. Thanks so much for helping me have the perfect holiday Chef Sarah!"}
{"text":"Had the restaurant all to ourselves last night.  The food was phenomenal - kohlrabi + rutabaga ravioli, the rawtastic sandwich and the spinach quiche.  The crust on everything was unmatched; the flavors really came together well and we were very impressed.

As others have mentioned, it's pricey (had two slices of pie afterwards - fig and pecan - which added $20 to the bill ($10/each), which seemed a bit much), but we had chef Sara's full attention.  The service was great, the attention to detail impeccable, and the food really was divine.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Chef Sara's is my idea of the GOLD STANDARD OF QUALITY in The Valley of the Sun. It's that good; as good as gold. And I'm not saying that after a single trip, but after innumerable trips. (Also, I would never consider reviewing a restaurant after a single trip and imagine that my review ought to even hold the weight of a feather in terms of credibility.)  In fact, I'd go as far to say that Chef Sara's is a crowning achievement of culinary excellence in The Valley; using only the finest, freshest organic ingredients, and nothing that has been deranged (i.e. destroyed by cooking it into oblivion). Chef Sara then takes the finest raw materials Nature can provide and she creates truly unique, imaginative, and innovative meals (see pics) like nothing else in the entire Valley!  
 
In fact, the food at Chef Sara's is so energizing, so nourishing, so delightful, that I eagerly make the 50-mile trip, each way, from Ahwatukee with my eyes full of wild anticipation all the way there; and then there's a bright, satisfied light coming from those from same eyes all the way back - as a warm glow envelopes every inch of my soul.  

The food at Chef Sara's is the elixir of life, and she does it up right. Every bite, an explosion of joy, an exclamation point of taste, as lustrous as silk rolling across my tongue. Each flavor is a moment to savor. My favorite is the RAWgasmic sandwich, a genuine foodgasm if there ever was one; as each glorious morsel that parades over my taste buds feels as if the bands are playing, the flags are waving, and the fireworks are flying! Though, in my mind, everything at Chef Sara's is first-rate, as if you're eating off a silver platter and drinking from a golden chalice. 

In fact, I'd say that Chef Sara's is actually everything the more popular and venerated (Un)True Food Kitchen only portends to be. That's because the food at Chef Sara's is actually REAL, authentic, unadulterated, TRUE food.  And while I'm thinking about it, I'd venture to say that \"real,\" in anything, tastes better, looks better, feels better, and is more alluring, captivating, and appealing - to the all of the senses.  If you think about it, people are naturally more attracted to anything that is authentic; more attracted to the simple; more attracted to the healthy; more attracted to the happy! 

We generally don't like the fake (unless it's fake fur/leather). We don't like fake in people (and all the lies/illusions/distortions/excuses/rationalizations/being emotionally frozen in childhood/etc.), and we certainly don't like the consequences of the fake. And fake food has to be made palatable so its makers (i.e., fakers) can brag about it being \"real\" and \"authentic.\" It's not. All that glitters is not gold. Nope. Putting a disguise on something that's inherently phony cannot suddenly make that something \"real.\" My fellow Yelpers, you can't fly like an eagle with the wings of a wren. There's nothing like being REAL. Nothing!

And no one does REAL better than Chef Sara. She doesn't need to brag about her food. (Only the fake needs a trumpet to brag about its alleged virtue and quality.) The food at Chef Sara's speaks for itself. And nothing's more REAL than when all the sugarcoating has worn off; when the mask has been chucked aside; when all pretense has been dropped; when all the lies have been untangled; when all the illusions have been stripped away; when the true colors are on display and all that's left is the absolute, unvarnished truth. Chef Sara's is real food; real flavor; and real healthy. Amen."}
{"text":"We visit Cave Creek a few times a year, but in our first return as vegetarians, we knew we had to go here to eat and learn more about eating raw, specifically.

The place was packed with locals, so that's always a good sign, and we selected a variety of items, including the spinach soup, rawgasmic sandwich, and \"chip and dip\" sampler.

Get beyond the fact that the soup will be lukewarm, because it's really good and fresh and a nice way to start the meal. The sauces/purées are bright and the seed \"chips\" have a good texture and taste. The sandwich was the topper, though--definitely the item to order.

I'm not saying the food is for everyone, in fact, I know a lot of closed-minded folks that wouldn't even give it a go, but this ex-carnivore, candyvore, junk food junkie is really enjoying the discovery of fresh, healthy, raw meals that are made and presented with such care. Truly lovely.

We liked everything so much that we bought the book, which lays out easy sauce and dehydration recipes."}
{"text":"If you're a health nut, then this place is totally for you!! I love that they use all raw ingredients here, and they list everything that is in their food. We only went for dessert, so I'm not sure how the food tastes, but it's probably pretty good. 

Because they use all raw ingredients here, the food may taste a little weird or different, so go in with that expectation. But at the same time, you can feel confident that you're fueling your body right, and you won't feel bad going in for that extra dessert!

The service is great; the employees and owners were very hospitable and loved talking about their food.

The only reason that I gave this place four stars is because it's a little pricier than I would prefer for 2 slices of cake, and the cake was served a little frozen. Still good though!"}
{"text":"Good service, fresh healthy food, knowledgeable staff and great location.  I saw a small sign for this place while driving through Cave Creek.  I used to live in the area but now live out of town.  I was about to grab some food in town at one of my old haunts when the thought of raw, vegan food was very appealing.  I came in on a Sunday afternoon for a late lunch.  It wasn't busy, but there were a couple of other patrons.  I was by myself and couldn't help thinking my boyfriend might squawk at this food decision (and the overall ambiance - too new age-y for most dudes I've dated).  However, once a guy tastes the food, I am sure he would be impressed.  They have a vast menu, but the server let me know what was available (they make everything fresh).  As an appetizer, I had a shot of wheat grass (and the waitress let me know the best way to consume it -- holding it in your mouth and swishing it around before swallowing).  For the main course, I went with the Veggie Burger, which was more like a reverse veggie burger (two raw onion bread patties on the outside and filling on the inside).  I don't like mushrooms so the waitress substituted hummus instead.  The sandwich was pretty large and very filling.  It came with a side of whipped, chilled butternut squash (?) which was delicious as well.  When I was done, Chef Sara greeted me personally.  You can tell that she takes a lot of pride in the quality of her food -- as she should!  If I lived closer, I would definitely return -- especially because I really wanted to try other stuff on the menu, particularly the Coconut Ravioli."}
{"text":"PHENOMENAL. A very creative menu, delicious food, and a friendly atmosphere. I had the \"pizza\" and my husband had the Chef's salad, which were both wonderful. The best part was the sugarless chocolate pie dessert. I felt so good after this meal, as opposed to feeling a bit sick and nauseous after most restaurant meals. It was very filling and satisfying. I woke up the next morning feeling great too. 

We also had a long chat with Chef Sara about healthy eating and her diet philosophies, which was quite enlightening.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE. Once you start eating healthy food like this on a regular basis you just can never go back to the fatty, greasy, salty, sugary, unhealthy standard american diet. 

Even if you aren't a vegan or health foodie, this place is worth checking out as the menu is so interesting and creative. It's amazing what you can do with vegetables!"}
{"text":"Only eaten here once, but chef Sarah has an extensive menu and is very accommodating about making modifications to suit you.  Will definitely eat here again.

This place also has quite a bit of outdoor seating and is dog friendly."}
{"text":"It's about $30/person, and the portions are small, so you will probably feel hungry (and robbed) an hour later. 

Unless, of course, you are my parents and had the raw sandwich. Then you will be up all night with food poisoning."}
{"text":"Very good and expertly prepared....also be prepared to spend more for lunch for two then you planed!"}
{"text":"We came here for the first time last night.  Chef Sara greeted us cheerfully as we entered.  She sat at our table while explaining what was on the menu.  There were three of us and we all ordered something different, and all tasted each other's dish.  I will say that I wasn't sure what to expect from raw vegan, but I was AMAZED at the flavors that I experienced.  While not expensive, it is more than our typical night out to eat.  But the quality of food and the flavors will definitely make this a place we return to."}
{"text":"My wife and I were out shooting a wedding, but had time for a good lunch. I read some of the reviews here and the one and two star reviews made me scratch my head. Raw vegan takes a while and is more expensive. Just the way it is. And it's totally worth it. A healthier lifestyle takes effort, but we feel better everyday because of it. Chef Sara and her employee/assistant both welcomed us and talked us through their menu. As we shared stories of why we'd all chosen the vegan way, we knew we were in the right place. We had the quiche with kale salad and the rawgasmic sandwich with sweet potato purée. Holy untouched cow, batman! Both meals were satisfying and fantastic. We will be back and recommend Chef Sara's restaurant to everyone."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a nice ambiance, the service was good. The night I went they had live music that added to the nice ambiance. I had marinara sauce with zucchini noodles and cheese cake for desert. I felt that the garlic was hugely overpowering in the entree and I generally found it unsatisfying, especially for the price. The cheesecake was pretty good but certainly not worth the price either.  In short, I would not go back as I felt it was overpriced and I felt unsatisfied when I left. I love to eat healthy, organic food but not at the expense of taste."}
{"text":"This place is hilarious! We went with family. My cousins step mom was trying to make sure to include her boyfriend in holiday fun since he is vegan and she did not realize that there was a difference between raw and vegan food. Understandable mistake. Everyone was totally willing to try something new BUT this place is like a bad episode of Portlandia. 

The menu sounded ok. We were told to sit and the chef would come around and tell us what on the menu we were studying was available for the day. We said ok and started reading the extensive menu. We ordered some tea. The lemon one was great but the Hibiscus tea my cousin and I ordered tasted like we were licking the earth. It was disgusting. So we asked if we could just trade it out for the lemon or if she could just take them away. The server seemed nervous and said she would ask the chef. She came back without asking the chef and said that she would fix the problem by putting coconut sugar in it. We tried it and let her know that it was still just not our cup of tea. FINALLY she agreed we could switch teas. 

At this point we had been sitting for about 20 minutes waiting for the famous chef to let us know what we were allowed to order off of the menu. Still no sign of her except to ask if the door open was making us cold. We decided to pay for our teas and cut our losses. If you have a craving for raw food, the desire to be in cave creek, and 4 hours to kill this might be the place for you. I will stick with cooked vegan food at Green or Braggs Factory Diner."}
{"text":"First, Sara's is hidden behind another building, next door to Janey's Coffee House. While the street number is visible, you'll need to drive to the back and left of the parking area. 

This is what raw, vegan food should taste like. Full of flavor. Good balance of texture. Nothing boring or bland going on here. I had the Almond Hummus Falafel Wrap. The crepe that it was wrapped with was slightly sweet, which nicely balanced the cumin scented salad interior. I didn't feel the Nori necessarily added anything. I had a couple of small rounds of falafel, but honestly didn't mind that this was not in the forefront of flavor. The sweet potato mash on the side was like dessert in a dish. But I had to try a donut hole. I really appreciated that it was a small single hole, providing just enough satisfaction without being too much. I went with another who lives for dessert, so I got to sample the coffee pie. It was rated A+. How the heck do you do that with chicory and dandelion? Delish, but that would have been too much at the end of the meal if it were me. 

My only possible reservation is the pricing. I remind myself that we got very fresh, good for the body meals, but do expect to pay for it. Coin toss between this and True Foods? I'll be here, no contest."}
{"text":"2-1-13
Incredible dining experience in a meticulously clean and charming cafe.  Chef Sara was accommodating, friendly, and highly informative and knowledgeable regarding a healthy and nutritious life style.  As well, Chef Sara provided a detailed review of the variety of menu options available that evening and assisted us with our selections.  Food portions were generously sized, fresh, and delectable.  A \"seasoned\" and most talented chef that strives to ensure guests receive an exceptional, unique, and healthy dining experience at Raw Vegan Cafe!"}
{"text":"I randomly ended up in Cave Creek one day and being vegan, I was very excited to stumble upon this place.  I'm happy to check out any vegan restaurant!  Yes. the food is good.  But for the amount you get, it's really over priced.   Over prices and pretentious.  It's also not too fun being handed a binder for a menu but being told you can only order from the back cover of 5 or 6 options.  The meal sizes are appetizer size at best.  I left feeling so hungry and unsatisfied after spending $15 for the \"pizza\".   I had to laugh at the Life's Paradox essay all over the walls - they're all misquoted as being said by the Dalai Lama.  The person who compared this place to a bad episode of Portlandia is dead on!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and so healthful!!! Worth every penny. The best organic, raw, vegan food in the valley! The ravioli is my favorite."}
{"text":"The food is outstanding - exactly what 'True Foods' promises to be and is not. Chef Sara is a master with raw ingredients, creating wonderful combinations with subtle and spicy flavors. 

We ate the Rawtastic Combo Platter Appetizer with 3 dips and kale salad, and a 5-seed cracker that needs to be seen and tasted to be believed. Then we had the Rawgasmic Sandwich on home made pumpernickel and the Falafel Wrap inside Nori - excellent! Get ready for a little garlic. 

For dessert the Pecan Pie with medjool dates topped off one of the best meals we've had out in a while. All of this is in a cute little place up a hard-to-see dirt road in Cave Creek. Who knew? 

Word of warning: go early. We arrived at 5:30pm on a Saturday night and they were understaffed to handle even a small rush of a crowd that came in around 6:30pm. Chef Sara is a magnificent chef and personality."}
{"text":"So excited to go there for my BDay lunch. Sign on door says closed July & August!!! Really?  No mention of that on Yelp (says it was open) or on their website!!  
Understand you need a break but be considerate to future patrons & post it!!!  It is a drive for us to go & it would have been nice to know you were closed!!"}
{"text":"I have never been a fan of raw cuisine.  I love flavor, and most vegan raw dishes that I've had have been very bland and boring, leaving me hungry and ready to eat again 5 minutes later. For this reason, it has taken me over 4 years to make my way over to Chef Sara's Raw Vegan Academy and Cafe.

As soon as I pulled up, I fell in love with the aesthetics of the cafe.  It has the appearance of a country log cabin. There was a pleasant and welcoming aura which made me feel like I was visiting grandma's house. Its outside walls are covered with various vegan, positive, and health conscious messages.  There is a lovely outside dining area, perfect for cooler weather months. 

Once I entered, there was a sense of tranquility. Everything about the inside is very zen and there are inspirational messages throughout, even in the restroom. 

Sara and a man whose name I didn't get, were both very helpful and friendly. They explained the menu, the ordering process, and advised me of what items were and were not available. I was instructed to ring the table bell when I was ready to order. I have to admit that I felt very uncomfortable doing this... It felt as if I was being rude.  Nonetheless, after browsing the extensive menu, I coyly rang the bell, ready to order.


TURMERIC/CILANTRO/HIMALAYAN PINK SALT $4.50 - 
I started my meal with this hot, caffeine-free, herbal drink. I couldn't decide between this drink and the Cayenne drink, so Sara added cayenne to my turmeric drink and it was amazing.  The menu lists all of the active properties and benefits of each ingredient. (See photos for details.) 


SPINACH PATE $9.95 - 
A very tasty appetizer made up of spinach, various nuts, garlic, and black pepper. You get one medium-sized scoop, and it is served with raw crackers. The pate didn't taste nutty, which was pleasant; the raw crackers do have a nutty taste. Served cold.


PESTO PASTA w/ ZUCCHINI NOODLES $16.95 - 
The menu pairs the Pesto Pasta with cucumber noodles, but Sara graciously allowed me to get zucchini noodles instead.  I received a large bowl filled with fresh raw zucchini noodles, arugula, spinach, walnuts, and Himalayan Pink Salt.  It was very satisfying and very filling.  I ended up taking 1/2 of it home. Served cold. 


Dessert! Chef Sara brought out a dessert tray and explained each dessert option in detail. She said that the coffee cake is their best seller. I dislike coffee so I went with something else.


CHOCOLATE CANNOLI @ $13 - This isn't listed in the menu with the other desserts, however its picture is on the menu cover.  2 nice sized chocolate crepes filled with banana ice cream and what seemed to be a date-based caramel. My dish was missing the chocolate drizzle that they show on the picture, but it was delicious nonetheless.  The chocolate crepes were very rich and sweet.  It was like biting into pure cacao. I'm not a banana fan, so I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious the banana ice cream was inside the crepe.  Excellent dish, and it's unbelievable that it's raw.  I honestly could've shared this with someone. I was full and had to force myself to eat the second cannoli because I knew it would melt by the time I got home. 


KEY LIME PIE $9.95 - It was creamy and the key lime flavor was very strong. I usually like key lime desserts, but they've always had a nice sweet-to-tart balanced ratio.  This one was a little too tart for my liking, but if you are into desserts that aren't too sweet, this one's perfect.

Chef Sara is also Dr. Sara. She is a kind, sweet soul who is passionate about the vegan lifestyle, promoting healthy eating choices, and \"nursing\" people back to health the natural, holistic way.  You can read about her story in the cafe, where you'll also find advertisements for her Back to Health Program, which if I over-heard correctly, is $5000. Contact her directly to inquire about the price and program details.  I hope that in the future she offers a detox retreat or camp. I'd totally join that!

I left this cafe feeling full without the drowsy \"itis\" that typically follows a meal. I felt energized and didn't get hungry for the rest of the day.  

I won't always eat raw, but when I do, it will be at Chef Sara's Raw Vegan Academy & Cafe."}
{"text":"Can't say enough good things about this place. Very much worth the drive, especially if you're looking to cap off a nice hike.  My wife and I wanted to try everything on the menu. Nothing disappointed. The place is cozy and Chef Sara was really cool."}
{"text":"Chef Sara works hard.  She is a bit over bearing and preachy about how 'bad' all other food other than hers is.  My husband, vegetarian, loves her food.  For me, seemed WAY pricey for what it was.  Many things on the menu were not available and there really isn't anything 'conventional'.   Mushroom 'quiche' was like a mushroom puree/pudding poured in pie pan... it was raw, wierd and not really tasty.  The salad was fine, but super expensive for a bowl full of greens and nuts.   I'm surprised this place has survived.  If I want an expensive lunch, I'll go to Cafe Bink.  Plus they don't try to 'educate' you about food while you are trying to eat.  I think you have to be a particular type of diner to enjoy this cafe."}
{"text":"I've been vegetarian - not vegan - for 35 yrs. and a good cook, so I am somewhat informed.  Firstly, the indoor seating/tables were ridiculously uncomfortable on a very slanted floor, and similar to an outdated (50's) run down patio setting.  I appreciate the qualities of raw vegan food, but We found our food all quite similar in flavor/texture, although they were described as very different by the host.  He spent an excessive amount of time describing each pictured dish possibly because we were 2 of 4 people in the very tiny place on an early Friday evening.  We had an appetizer, 2 main courses, 1 tea, and 1 desert resulting in a $77 tab.  Then we left hungry."}
{"text":"Flavors are amazing and a great opportunity to learn more about food. Chef Sara was very accommodating and interesting.  While the pace is a bit slow it is worth the wait. We will be back. Dont expect low prices and super fast service since chef sara creates everything herself from scratch for you."}
