{"text":"The food was good but the owner was a rude women.  When we tired to talk to her about an issue she basically blew us off and walked away."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since they opened.  The food is always great, the service is always great, you can't ask for a better Italian restaurant.  Linda, one of the owners will go out of her way to make sure you feel like family."}
{"text":"Great Sicilian Pie! Having just came down for NY finding a good pizza was seeming endless! Great food great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I really enjoy giving a 5 star review almost as much as I enjoy great Italian food (Yes, I'm a transplant from the North)

So this is why I am back to update Angela's first 5 star review.This place is worthy of both. 
Another five star review and another compliment of serving up some great Italian food.(IMO I happen to think it's the best in Charlotte)

I have tried many others, some even at the cost of a higher priced tab and was left far from impressed.

If I could sum up in one word how great this restaurant is it would be *consistently*
They are consistently delicious. Never have I been sorry for ordering a dish.

Since my first visit/review I have tried almost all they offer including the pizzas which also can be included IMO of being best in Charlotte.

Took friends last night to indulge in some fine Italian cuisine and some pre Holiday Christmas cheer and the place was decorated with such inviting Christmas decor.
 
No Bah Hambug here. Tis' the season for giving another 5 star review to you Angela's!"}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised.  Atmosphere for dinner was outstanding.  The food was good but not great...but the service was exceptional.  A well educated and attentive staff made for an enjoyable evening.  This is definitely a romantic hidden gem."}
{"text":"Hard to believe what I am reading about this being the next best thing to real Italian food!  This food is gross!!!!! No flavor, unseasoned and definitely NOT GOOD ITALIAN!!!!!  And, the prices are very high for what you get!  The sauce is definitely NOT an old family recipe - tastes like it came out of a can and it tastes like it too!! There are way too many GOOD Italian restaurants in Matthews, Mint Hill and Charlotte, so do yourself a favor and skip this place and go to someplace other than Angela's that gives you a great meal, includes a salad and is worth the money you pay.  Also, the service is slow and the servers act like they are doing YOU a favor by waiting on you.  One on my pet peeves is leaving dirty dishes on the table and these lazy servers don't hesitate to do this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Run to another restaurant - NOW!!!"}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Saturday night, it was our first time there the place wasn't busy and asked for a pizza. The waitress told us it would take 40 minutes for it suggests we have a appetizers first while we wait. Wanted a pizza only. Will never return. !!!!!"}
{"text":"What a marvelous meal. Extra friendly staff. The veal was wonderful. We had a great time and great meal."}
{"text":"Had a GREAT New Years Dinner at Angelas tonight. Calamari and white wine Mussels and a good crusty bread. They had our favorite pasta tonight. You've got to try their Gorgonzola Sauce. Tonight it was served with Scallops and Shrimp. Owners and staff are very nice and helpful."}
{"text":"First time eating here. It was highly recommended by a friend. Some of the best lasagna I have eaten. Obvious homemade sauce, with such a beautiful color! Very visually appealing. The ricotta and mozzarella were both delicious. The meat in the lasagna was tender and flavorful, with no gross squiggly things in the meat. You can taste the high quality of the ingredients. The service was excellent and the prices were very reasonable. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is great! especially for the location. Great restaurants are lacking close to this area (in Charlotte off Idlewild near Mint Hill), but Angela's really stands out. We used to live near the Arboretum in Charlotte and found no Italian restaurants as a go to restaurant for Italian take out suitable at all. 

The sauces are amazingly good. Garlic knots delicious. Capellini alla Primarvera is Awesome!!! :) But so is everything else we have tried. If you ask a waiter for the favorite dishes they will give you a long list of beloved dishes to try out. 

Friendly Staff, Angela's is definitely a family owned business not a corporate giant or fine dining experience, so in my opinion the other reviewers are out of line with the staff reviews. They certainly expect you to enjoy your meal with more of a European pace to your dining experience. The owners are present and friendly in appropriate ways. 

The portions are huge and heat up well the next day. Not necessarily dieter friendly. Repeat: The Sauces at Angela's are AMAZING. I think they go through a lot of great olive oil back in the kitchen. The pasta is great too. 

Lots of dishes have lots of vegetables which is a huge plus for me. PERFECT FOR TAKE-OUT. There is always a steady flow of people coming in and out for take-out. Great for Dining In. Nice little outside seating area. Decent Music for a restaurant setting. 

If you have at least somewhat well behaved kids I would imagine Angela's to be family friendly. Great place to go with friends."}
{"text":"Ok. So my daughter and I tried this place today and I was deeply disappointed. It has ambiance and props that strongly support the Italian theme, however the food is boring and lackluster. I had the calamari (from the appetizer section) and my daughter had the Philly cheesesteak. She had no real issues with her food other than it being dry and over cooked. The calamari was missing calamari (seriously, no meat inside) and the batter was totally unseasoned. Thank goodness for the red (marinara or salsa?!) sauce to make them edible. The waitress was the best part of our experience. She was very attentive (although we were literally the only customers during the lunch hours) and friendly. When this place closes down, I hope a good restaurant picks the waitress up. She was great! I'm not gonna say they're not gonna make it, stranger things have happened. Maybe hire a chef with taste buds, or at least serve fresh seafood and meats equivalent to the prices you charge. Not frozen, quick-fry/bake foods. Im not saying you should change anything, I'm not saying you should fire your chef, I'm just sayin...But I really liked the waitress."}
{"text":"We ate at Angela's while in town for a cross country meet. After reading the reviews we figured it was worth a shot. Thank goodness we did decided to give it a go. The food was outstanding. The service was equally matched. The atmosphere is great. It was Friday night and the place was packed. We had the prosciutto and mozzarella to start and then went with a pizza. The ingredients were fresh and the dough was very tasty. Thumbs up to Angela's!"}
{"text":"Not good food did not taste fresh more like preheated. The spaghetti sauce was more water then anything."}
{"text":"We were there for dinner last Friday evening. The food was not presented as per the menu. Baked ziti was not baked etc. when we were presented the bill it read 69 and change. When the used my credit card the price changed by several dollars. The owner came by and was extremely rude. She even walked away while we were talking. Rude was an understatement. We will never go back there and will not recommend to anyone's"}
{"text":"The meal itself was very good, except the bread wasn't the best.  The train really started to derail when they wanted an extra 75 cents for a couple spoonfuls of sauce to take with the leftover half of a calzone.  The service was terrible, they took about 10-15 minutes to bring a bill, and when they brought back the receipt to sign after charging the credit card... It was for six dollars more than the original bill was for. She claimed that when she went to swipe the card she noticed it only had one soft drink instead of three, So she added two more. The catch was, there were only two soft drinks... So it was overcharging by one drink. She didn't seem to grasp why I would want some explanation or communication for a receipt being more than the bill.  She claimed to be \"the old one who knows what's going on\", and was hustling hard, but didn't seem very competent at her job."}
{"text":"I would give Angela's 5 stars but the paper towels in the bathroom needed replacing and the caesar salad wasn't my favorite. However, the salad did grow on me (I'm not used to so many croutons- but I think that's what most people like about salads- yes?) The portions were generous and the food was delicious. I had a green pepper pizza pie (small- and it was plenty with the larger size salad- I have half the pizza left for a snack before bed!). My husband had the sausage linguine- THREE good-sized sausages! We were impressed.

Bobby was our server. He was attentive, professional and willing to laugh. Our beverages were kept full. The restaurant is entirely smoke-free (YAY!!!) AND still has a small bar. The lighting and music were perfect. Next time I may prefer sitting toward the middle instead of off to the side only because when the dessert case is opened a bright light is released (I saw many people go toward the light and they seemed to enjoy it). But nevertheless, our experience was overwhelmingly pleasant and we will be back... soon!"}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times.  Excellent bread.  We usually get the pasta ala vodka?  I think that is what it is called.  It is delicious.

Can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"There is the best Italian Restaurant in Charlotte! This is a family favorite and Charlotte's best Italian food! My parents introduced Angela's to my wife and I and it became an instant favorite. We live 30 minutes north of Charlotte and it's ALWAYS worth the drive. 

The staff is extremely friendly and makes you feel at home. When you sit down, you are welcomed with hot bread and butter. When it's time to order, my wife and I usually get the eggplant parm. The meal comes with a salad. It's always cooked perfectly and the sauce is unbelievable, fresh and flavorful. I would say it's the best sauce in Charlotte. Portion size is perfect.

We have also had their Chicken Vesuvio. This was my Mom's favorite. She loved the different flavors the plate offers. The chicken is always cooked perfect; tender and full of flavor. 

The pizza is good too. Fresh dough made daily and the sauce is always good. They put the perfect amount on too. Pizza needs the perfect amount of sauce. The ingredients are always fresh. 

It's a must. You'll enjoy the meal and you'll be back!"}
{"text":"Went for an early dinner with my mom and we both LOVED it there. Food was great and so was the service. I recommend their gelato for dessert and the fried cherry  peppers as an appetizer!"}
{"text":"Edited to correct a couple of 'fat fingered spelling/word erros' while typing this ---While I am aware that everybody has different tastes opinions and etc, The 1 opinion I've seen a few people post, I really don't understand.

The bread is homemade and made fresh daily. Personally, I think their bread is terrific.

I've been a regular for quite some time. While I do not know the owner(s) personally, I do know them simply by eating there as often as I do and they, nor any employee has ever been rude to me, nor have I ever seen them be rude to anybody else.

I've seen a couple people claim they are unethical by charging more then indicated. I find that sort of odd since its never happened to me and after so many meals there, Id think if this was common, I would have had it done to me by now. Yet, I can only say the actual opposite has happened. Normally, if I am paying with cash and the bill is xx.57, if I dont have any change in my pocket, they just normally round it down. I have cash. They could easily take it and then give me my .43cents change. Which they obviously do many times, but honestly, more times then not they hand me back a $1bill I gave them and round the bill down. 

Pretty nice of them, imo. Considering I've eaten at places in which if you want a small dollop of sauce which comes with your meal, but they give you such a minuscule amount, you'd like a spoonful more. I have had places actually make me pay .25cents on my credit card cause I had no cash or change, but the meal simply would not be as good without that extra .25cents of sour cream or etc..... So, I give them my CC just to get a spoonful of sour cream, that they honestly should give you enough of and if not, dont be so anal and make a customer pay .25cents on their credit card when your tab is well over $75++ and your wait staff is going to get at least a 25-35% tip.

In any event, with that out of the way, how is the food?

I think its terrific. Many many meals eaten there and have never been disappointed. Quality is excellent, portions are generous and prices are rather good as compared to other places serving the same dish that isnt even as good.

The NY style pizza is pretty darned good, imo. The veal and chicken dishes are always good, as is the seafood and many pastas and baked pasta dishes. The Calzones and sandwiches are quite good and priced right. Meatball Parm, Cheese Steak, Sausage and Peppers, all very good.

They always have daily specials on the board, and Ive never ordered one and end up disappointed. Normally its either me and my girl or us and 1 or 2 other couples (2-6 people normally). I can honestly say, nobody I have ever been there with has been disappointed. Normally we are all sampling each others food and normally we all love our meals as well as the others in our group.

I will say that Italian food is quite subjective based on each individuals likes and dislikes and etc. I love Marsala Wine sauce for instance. Depending on where you eat it will always be different then other places you eat. Doesn't mean those are bad and the others are good, but sure, I like so and so's better then so and so's, which doesnt mean any were bad. It simply means I like one better then the other, which I think is true not just with sauces, but with most all Italian food in general.

One other thing I like about this place is I have some 'favorite dishes', that are not on their menu. If they have the ingredients to make what I want, they do it. And while Id be willing to pay more, they normally just charge me whatever a similar dish costs. I love Veal Saltinboca for instance. If I want it, they make it and charge me for whatever the Veal Marsala etc is priced at. Ive been to alot of Italian restaurants and most will not accommodate you in this manner. Some do, but normally they charge you more, which is understandable and 100% acceptable to me. Angelas never charges me more. They could and perhaps should...and Id happily pay the extra money. But they don't.

So all and all, I think the food is great, prices very very reasonable and even if the staff is overwhelmed, they are always nice and polite and in instances like that, which does occur, they will normally bring a free round of drinks or a couple of free appetizers, free deserts for everybody or etc...without us even asking for it or complaining...& whatever they bring comes with a sincere apology that they are as busy as they are.

So, I give this 5 stars. And as always, will encourage people to take all reviews including mine with a grain of salt and go yourself, try it and form your own opinion."}
{"text":"The food at Angela's is delicious and one-of-a-kind! You get a lot for your money-a soup or salad to start with some hot, homemade bread, a large portion of a meal, and a good atmosphere. My usual is Fried Calamari with extra lemon to squeeze on top, Pasta Fagioli soup to start with, and their homemade Chicken and Spinach Lasagna! This definitely fills me up but you need to save some room for dessert (Lemon Cello Cake!). I have tried a little bit of everything off their menu and haven't been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ristorante di Angela ha la migliore autentico cibo italiano in città! This restaurant puts Mint Hill on the map!  You will love it!"}
{"text":"Angela's has what may be the best Fettuccini Alfredo on the planet. Seriously, it's amazing. Their bread is great and the service is top notch. My wife loves the manicotti and the penne ala vodka is great too. Occasionally they have a Sinatra-like singer who is pretty good. It's our favorite Italian place in town unless we're going for pizza (theirs is good too, but there are better options). Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Disappointed after our latest visit...  I would have given the restaurant 4 stars prior to this, but, alas, they must have changed chefs.

We arrived on a Tuesday evening to find the dining room 90% empty.  Our server was new (less than 2 weeks) and obviously this was his first job in this profession. The service was slow, uncoordinated, unprofessional, and over-solicitous when the bill came. (Big tip, please!)

The food, which had been consistent previously, was blandly plated, poorly prepared, and meager on the important stuff.  My guy had Shrimp Scampi and received only 5 medium shrimp with his pasta.  Insert sad face here.  My Chicken Penne al a Vodka sauce was light on the sauce and heavy on the over grilled, tough chicken pieces.  This had been my favorite dish at this venue.  The minestrone was unremarkable, the salads were just okay, but the hot bread was crusty and tasty, as before. So that's something I guess.

Although this had been my favorite Italian place in this vicinity, we will be unlikely to return.  Major bummer..."}
{"text":"Ok, so I decided to go back and try something else on the menu being that I'm still in Italian mode.  It was Saturday around 3:30 and it was basically empty since lunch ended around 2:30.  I ordered the Chicken Vesuvio which was really good, however the service was not on point.  My waiter was also the bartender and since I was the only person there and a couple was sitting at the bar he understandably had to split his time between us(not a packed dining room).......so why am I waving my hand like a 1st grader to get some service?  Geez........I was so pissed when I left it will probably be a minute if I decide to return."}
{"text":"Nice looking restaurant but i wasnt impressed with the food nor the owner  complaining to other employees about the servers! It wasnt hard to hear while i was trying to enjoy my dinner. I think that was unprofessional and the girls do a wonerful job. I will not return to dine here again."}
{"text":"This is strictly a review of the pizza, I have not had anything else on the menu for years. I don't hand out 5 stars for pizza easily, but the honest truth is that this is one of the best pizzas in Charlotte.  Many people don't know about it because the location sucks.  If it were in one of the destination neighborhoods this place would be packed.  It's not close to me, over a 30 minute drive.  So when I do stop by it's always a treat.  I haven't had the chance to speak with the owner and learn about their process, but I can tell they use great ingredients and know what they're doing when it comes to making pizza dough.  My most recent pie was a White pizza (forgot to take a pic, sorry).  I grabbed it to go so it sat in a box for 15 minutes, but the crust still had the great stone cooked texture I like.  It had a bit of chew and a little snap, without being tough.  The flavor of the dough was also nice.  It's one of those crusts you just have to eat when you get to the end.  Too bad it's a little out of the way for many Charlotteans, but it's worth a trip if you really like seeking out great pizza."}
{"text":"What to say about Angelas? The Best Italian Food in the area. Pasta fagioli, lentil, italian wedding soup all my favorites and they are fresh. Had the veal special and it was scrumptious,  tender in tomato sauce that was really gravy as in tomatoes flavored by the juices from the veal. Not a bad dish in the place and we have sampled quite a few. I have recommended this place to EVERYONE I know lol!"}
{"text":"Angela's is by far the closest to real Italian food! 

It seems that you could hardly find an Italian spot-around here, but so far Angela did us a favor by providing the best real sauce they use.  Although their pasta e fagioli is not exactly how it supposed to be, but that's just one thing!  

Pizza is great! all in all- it's great!"}
{"text":"3 stars for the NY style pizza. 

The decor was a little nicer than usual for this type of venue and they have a an outdoor patio for nice days. We kept it simple, a large pie with extra cheese, that's all.
It was a big pie,with a generous amount of cheese. The crust tasted RIGHT, like salty Italian bread and not this buttery sweet dough that seems to be common today. The tomato sauce tasted good as well so it was all good.

Why not 4 stars? Because the dough needs to better stretched, with the crust thinner and more consistent - it was very thin on center but a bit too thick overall. Also it was toasted a little too long, and a bit burned on the outside. The pie at the next table was the same so it was not a fluke - still, better crunchy than than soggy. 

The other thing was the tomato sauce was good but lacked spices. All together a perfectly good classic pizza, nothing more, nothing less."}
{"text":"Angela's is probably my favorite place in Charlotte and certainly the best Italian food around. If I lived closer I'd eat here all the time.

Everything I've had here has been delicious. I typically get the Veal Parm. It's tasty and tender. I've also had spaghetti, gnocchi, and chicken Parm, and they have all been outstanding. I can also vouch for the eggplant rollatini - one of my wife's favorites. 

The appetizers have been great.  We've had the calamari and the mozzarella caprese on several occasions, and they have been great. 

I don't usually get dessert, although I had a cannoli the once. Home run!!

To top all of that off, the prices here are very reasonable. Most entrees are in the $10-15 range.  You're getting the best Italian food in the area for a price that's almost half of what other joints are charging.

Angela's is a can't miss!"}
{"text":"Two persons in my party ordered baked ziti.  Meh.  It wasn't truly baked--looked just like pasta straight out of hot water.
Worst thing, though--there was a mix-up in the bill.  One of the adult members of my party ordered a child's portion, and when the bill was presented, that's what was listed.  However, the actual credit card charge was higher than the bill amount.  It was up-charged to the lunch price.
I've no problem with the policy--but it smacks of a lack of integrity to charge more on the credit card than was on the bill, without an explanation from either the wait person or the owner/manager.  
With so many choices in Italian food, I prefer dealing with establishments where food served matches the menu listing, and where there's no attempt to sneak in higher charges."}
{"text":"I went to Angela's last Saturday for lunch, with my partner and my \"might as well be in-laws\". I have lived within 5 minutes of Angela's for nearly 2 years now, and this was my first visit. I now know why...

We walked in, and the place was COMPLETELY deserted, at 1pm. (Their lunch service runs from 11am - 2:30, so we were pretty much smack-dab in the middle of that).  I didn't expect the place to be hopping, but also didn't expect the place to be completely devoid of customers. I didn't take it as a good sign. The lack of any other customers made for a very somber dining experience.

After perusing their large menu, I ordered the 'Rigatoni alla Vodka'. I make a kick-ass Penne Vodka, and wanted to compare notes on a similar dish. It was good, but not great. I will say that the pasta was cooked the way I like it, al dente, which was a plus. No mushy rigatoni here. The onions in the creamy red vodka sauce were red onions, which struck me as an odd choice. I love all onions, so I was fine with it, but still - weird. All in all, it was good, but I think I would try something else next time. 

The other dishes ordered were a Chicken Alfredo special of the day, Pollo alla Piccata, and Gnocchi alla Sorrentina. They brought us two twee loaves of hot bread after we ordered, with (sub-par) olive oil and balsamic for dipping. Salads do not come with the entrees during lunch or dinner service.  All of our dishes were between $8.25 - $10.

Our server was nice enough, but just didn't seem to \"click\" with us. She acted as if it was a pain for her to refill my unsweetened iced tea (the rest of the table had sweet tea), which annoyed me. 

We didn't sample the wine list, unfortunately (I still can't bring myself to order a drink when the in-laws don't), so  I can't comment on that aspect. 

We did look at the dessert menu, only to close it in disgust. It was strange. It was a pre-fab frozen desserts you've never heard of wonderland. No Tiramisu? No Panna Cotta? No Gelato? Very disappointing for a restaurant trying to do \"authentic Italian\".  (Also the dessert menu was on cheapo, dirty white cardstock, with horribly dated looking photos, with \"Angela\" on the top. Seeing as how the restaurant is called \"Angela's\", officially, this also seemed like a big whoops).

I wasn't COMPLETELY turned off, so T and I will probably go back to try the pizza and wine at some point. I hope there are some other customers then! I'm hoping the ambiance and mood would seem cheerier with other folks around."}
{"text":"If you're a fan of NY style pizza, this is the spot.  Big slices dripping of grease and cheese that reminds me why I haven't had pizza from chain restaurants like pizza hut in years.  Incredible taste.  This is really the only thing we order so I cant recommend anything else except for the Tiramisu for dessert.  Staff is always friendly and attentive.  Wednesdays there is a special for two large pizza pies for $17.  Cant go wrong."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place!!!! It's great to have an authentic family run shop so close to home. We eat there at least once a month. The food is wonderful, even better it's a comfortable quiet atmosphere where you can have a good conversation over dinner unlike most deafening loud chain stores where you practically have to yell across the table. 
The soups are especially good"}
{"text":"Wow! I was blown away by how authentic the food was here. I am already planning my next trip. I had the Chicken Vesuvio and the hubby had Spinach Chicken Lasagna. The flavors were great and the portions were large. The bread that came out with the meal was warm and delicious. I have nothing bad to say. The service was a bit slow but that was fine because I just enjoyed a second glass of wine. The prices are cheap and this is just a fabulous date night restaurant. I can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"We ate here last night with the kids.  I thought they were closed down but was nicely surprised to see the lights on. 
My husband got a cheesesteak sandwich (duh). It was really good. I got the chicken Marsala and oh my, I'll be going back just for that. 

I was a little disappointed that they charged $7 for a kids' portion of noodles with Alfredo sauce, but....it was hands down the best Alfredo I have ever tasted. Ever. Best. 

My other kids shared a pizza, which had the potential to be outstanding but the underside of the crust was burnt so that kind of ruined the taste. 

Our server, Michelle, was extremely gracious and patient with us. We were really excited to be there for whatever reason and she was great. 

It's too bad I can't give 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I love everything I've ever had at Angela's. Chicken Lasagna is my fav! I don't like they are closed Mondays!"}
{"text":"Not sure how this place has 4 stars.  I've had a salad,cheese steak and the pizza.  I recently relocated here from NY and have been trying the Italian places out around town.  I visited on 2 separate occasions and the second was simply due to a group decision.  Mehhh. . if you have too I guess, but if you're looking for good Italian seek else where."}
{"text":"There are a lot of good reviews about this place.  Maybe they just can't handle being busy or something,  The worst service ever, 1 hour and 30 minutes and no food.  silverware was \"unavailable for a few minutes\"  even after we got the food.  what the hell?  ridiculous.  the manager was being a B**tch to a customer at the bar, i can tell you I will never recommend that place to anyone."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times I only order one thing and it is really good I usually get the cheesesteak  I recommend that to anybody who likes steak sandwiches"}
{"text":"Love this spot. The whole menu is solid and it's always good, every time. Worth a visit, for sure."}
{"text":"I had the pizza here recently. It was incredible even though I just had the run of the mill pepperoni pizza. The pizza sauce was just delicious and tasted very fresh. The prices could be a little better, but it is definitely worth it. Great pizza some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"I live right around the corner from Angela's and am a regular. The food and atmosphere are great. Service has its ups and downs (seems there's high turn-over, so a lot of times you're dealing with a newbie). My favorites are the pizza - can't go wrong there. Truly authentic NY pizza! Nothing like it around. I also love the Shrimp Parmesan and the Penne allá Vodka with Chicken."}
{"text":"This is authentic Italian food that is well seasoned, well portioned and fresh. The restaurant was clean & quiet with low lighting. We were met with a smile as soon as we entered."}
{"text":"You will be surprised! What a menu! Beautiful inside and outdoor seating, full bar, and great prices. Authentic and fresh. We ordered a lighter dinner. The salad my wife ordered was a work of art! Prosciutto ham, fresh mozzarella, Kalamata olives, generous other cheese and meat rolls, greens and their signature creamy tomato basil dressing. My Chicken Parmigiana sandwich was amazing. Dessert was insane! Worth a trip! Our new favorite!"}
{"text":"I must have entered the twilight zone yesterday when I had my first visit here. First of all, when we arrived the door had a sign on it that said \"Kitchen closed everyday from 2:30-3:30.\" It was 2:00pm when we arrived, and the door was so hard to open, we thought it was locked already. A server finally walked to the door, and gave us an attitude and said the door was just \"hard to open.\" I was with my 80 year old grandmother, there was no way she would have been able to open the door. We asked if it was ok to come in and eat since they would be closing soon, to which she responded \"I guess.\" 

We finally got inside and before we even sat down and situated she was asking us what we wanted to drink. I asked her to bring us waters to start and let us at least sit down and glance at the menu before we decide on drinks. 

We ordered an antipasto cold app to start. She brought us the completely wrong app (without plates I might add) and told us if we wanted the correct appetizer we ordered then we would have to pay for both. I told her that was absurd!!! She made the mistake, she should bring us the correct app without us paying for both. It had already been 30 minutes and we were pretty damn hungry. 

We were finally able to order a pizza after I had to get up from the table to find our server standing behind the bar doing nothing. I will add there was only one other table in the entire restaurant. The pizza took an hour to make!! We asked her why it was taking so long, and she told us she \"forgot to ring it in because she screwed up her other table's checks.\" At this point it was 3:45 and I had to be at a 4:00 appointment. I was completely shocked she admitted to these mistakes and never once apologized. When the pizza arrived it was slightly burnt, not brought out on a pizza stand, and the toppings fell right off when you picked it up. We threw it in a box and had to leave, still hungry and beyond annoyed. 

I asked her if I could speak to a manager because of our ridiculous experience. She said he was not there but I could talk to the kitchen staff?! I've been in the service industry for 13 years and never dealt with anything like this.

There was absolutely no excuse for the service or experience we had at this place. We will not be returning and I will be contacting management for a refund since they weren't present to comp our meals yesterday."}
{"text":"Well Angela's did a redo  great and wonderful. I say it was a major miss, a few weeks ago me and my daughter ate here after they reopened and supposedly got their selves together.  Well we were greeted after a few minutes, that's odd because no one was in the restaurant, the waitress attitude was a little better than the food.  She had a problem every time I asked for something which is crazy because that's her job and all.  Other customers decided to eat in as well, one of the \"NEW\" employees or family members however you slice it went and got donuts for every one so all of the waitresses gathered at a space behind the bar and chugged their mouths with donuts while customers willing to pay for the food and bad service stood at the door and waited patiently.  The new guy behind the counter rung the bell like 4 times before one of the new employees thought that it was a good idea to seat the customers.  Hardly any of the tables were set with the items that all tables are supposed to have. You know like salt, pepper, silver ware, things of that nature. The food, well the salad that came with the meal was the best part, I guess it's kind of hard to mess up a salad.  The bread was also the same, but the noodles well let's say they took being al dente to a whole new level, not good taste like rubber almost, the sauce couldn't even cover that taste.  Any who I promised to never go back, the owner isn't nice but ok.  So today my daughter wanted noodles and her dad thought it would be a good idea to give Angela's another try well the only difference is we didn't eat in the establishment we took it to go.  The salad good, the fettuccine well it was a group of noodles stuck together, as if they threw them in the pot and didn't stir them before they fused together by then it was too late, and of course they didn't redo them.  I didn't even feel like returning them, because like I mentioned before the owner isn't nice. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"My family likes Angela's.  My wife and teenage son enjoy the Penne Alla Vodka.  I like the Bolognese sauce, and the Marinara with Meatballs. I have also had, and liked, the pasta and sausage dish. Both chicken parm and veal parm are pretty good.  The bread is fresh and warm, delicious with butter.  This is not a fancy place-- just sort of basic family run Italian food, at moderate prices.  For higher end Italian, go downtown to Luce, or Park Road for Fiamma.  Angela's is casual and basic, somewhat similar to Portofino on Eastway, I think.   This restaurant is in an out of the way location in the Mint Hill area, but the experience is comfortable enough that we don't mind the 15 minute drive."}
{"text":"They cannot cook spaghetti when wife told them it tasted burned and my daughters spaghetti that was angel hair tasted better they did nothing 
 They didn't bring a refill of Diet Coke as the guy said the shit the machine down at 10. 
 I asked like 5 to 10 minutes prior. 
 Waitresses standing around just standing around. 
 Owner didn't offer a replacement on the simple spaghetti for my wife. 
 Only reason 2 stars meatballs tasted ok. 
 Hope they were cool right."}
{"text":"If Angela's had a million dollar budget for marketing, it would not matter. Fact is, no dollar amount could ever purchase the raving word of mouth this place is supported by.

You can't put a dollar amount on a satisfied customer boasting about their favorite Italian restaurant in Charlotte. Based on my own experience, I have run across many fans of Angela's,both in and out of the restaurant. 

While dining, I have actually had neighboring tables recommend their new favorite dish I should try.  While waiting for takeout at the bar I've run across some regulars telling me \"everything on the menu is great\".
YES ,  I AGREE !  And there are even times when Angela's name and good reputation was a common factor to perfect strangers on the street.
In fact, I myself had tried out the place due to a recommendation nearly two years ago. 

There are some nights when I go for dinner and they are packed.  Wait time is usually kept short , unless I have brought a group of people.  On the other hand there are times when you have your pick of a table which almost makes me sad. 
It is hard to believe that a place like this would ever be without a line out the door. 

The food is delicious, the restaurant itself has personality that sparkles due to the friendly service and the devotion that shines through from the owners themselves.
The portions are ample and the price is perfect in today's struggling economy.  Their website coupons change up from time to time which makes for more of a deal.

Pizza is one of my favorite things and it is ny style super good but they have things on the menu that will give my favorite a run for it's money.

The Chicken Linda is like nothing else  (chalk board special) and the Zuppa di pesce is memorable.  If they don't prepare the sausage and meatballs in house, I've been fooled.  But maybe that's because of that incredible sauce they serve it in.  Talk about memorable  (I am of Italian heritage for what it is worth)

Half star deduction for the tiramisu which is not house made but still good and half star added back for their fresh cannolis.

Charlotte Observer wrote that this is a restaurant that is \"most passionately supported\". 
After being a customer for nearly two years I fully understand that I might have contributed to that title with pleasure."}
{"text":"So we headed to Angela's for my cousins birthday and to Chad E's amazement I am sure,  the place actually had quite a crowd. 

According to my grandmother Frank Sinatra was there...but really it was just a guy and his keyboard - playing My Way like one would expect. He was good, not great. 

I was a bit sad I couldn't order the smaller lunch portion since I wasn't super hungry but prices were reasonable (about $13 for dinner portion lasagna- and a salad). I opted out of bread since the table ordered garlic knots. I've had better at pizza places- not a fan of warm bread products being sold with chilled marinara. They also did not have a personal pizza option so my cousin was left with a pizza that could have easily been split three ways - which is fine for leftovers but kind of bad if you are looking to have one calorie laden day not two or three.

 My lasagna was meat-centric. The meat was a bit salty but I probably wouldn't have noticed if it had been used just slightly less. It looked more like a pile of mashed Parmesan-covered meatballs then lasagna. Very sparse on noodles and an even smaller amount of mozzarella : ( .  Taste-wise the sauce is great, and this could be one of the best in town if they just used the proper proportions. 

The birthday celebration portion was great. We were served a delicious chocolate raspberry cake that had a sparkler on top. The entire restaurant (led by Frank of course) sang happy birthday...not for the bashful but certainly a lot of fun.

Service wasn't anything out of the ordinary but when we left the hostesses did an excellent job of making sure our meals were satisfactory."}
{"text":"More than three years since I'd been here (or written about it)?  No way.  Time for an update!

Frankly, I'm a little amazed that they are still in business.  Not so much because of anything except the fact that every time we go by there is almost no one in the parking lot.  The place is empty.  In fact, when we pulled in at about 6pm, we were the only diners.  There had to be a half-dozen staff standing around with nothing to do.

Does that mean good service?  Unfortunately not.  It was about average.  Though others might be better, our waitress really didn't seem to have a clue about much of anything.  She could have been training, but at the rate this place goes through patrons - which is not quickly - she might be working at it for a while.

When the food came, things picked up a bit.  The prices are a bit on the high side for what you get.  After all, it is an outpost in the middle of a shopping center parking lot, and it is a plate of pasta.  I'm sure there are places that serve pasta that are worth it, but here?  Not so much.

I decided to go with a \"meat roll\" instead.  Luckily it turned out well, and had a good portion too.  Otherwise they might have come in with an even lower rating.  In fact, if you stick to this area of the menu, you might be pleased.  Otherwise?  A little much for what you get."}
{"text":"Good food, not so great atmosphere. I love their pizza as well as many other dishes.  I prefer to order for pick up rather than eat in because it seems they always have far too many people working when there aren't any customers. Every time I go in the staff (comprised mostly of teen girls) are congregated socializing, which is highly unprofessional. I always feel like an outsider there. If you aren't a regular, expect a rather cool reception.  We've had a good experience there, but it was only one time out of many."}
{"text":"They screwed up a large order to be picked up by one person. Based on prior reviews, customer service does not seem to be their strong suit, but they did not have ANY customer service common sense to tell us they would fix the problem and at the very least refund the difference. Instead they argued that WE made the mistake and the managers dodged our calls only to relay the message through their very rude hostess that it's too late to be refunded. I'm not sure why a restaurant would spend over an hour arguing with their customer for a mistake they themselves made, all the while changing their tune on what exactly their policy is in a situation like this. Just fix the problem quickly and efficiently like anyone else with common sense would do or better yet, shut your doors."}
{"text":"This place is under rated for its authentic food and classy but speedy service. The combination of great authentic food and service that makes you want to dine there frequently is exactly what a restaurant desires."}
{"text":"Yesterday we ordered a pizza from Angela's. This was the second time we've ordered a pizza from them and I've eaten there in a restaurant one time so far it has been good but yesterday the pizza I got was not the pizza I ordered. I ordered a large pizza half pepperoni and pineapple and to put artichokes and mushrooms and olives on the  whole pizza. What I got was half a cheese pizza with everything else on one side I checked the pizza before I left and I said this is wrong. I checked the order which was written correctly. They said they'd call me today but they didn't and didn't offer right then and there to fix the pizza. Oh well won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I live just down the road from the restaurant. Every time I come in for dinner I Remember why I keep coming back the food and service are great. Tuesdays are two for one pizza how can you get any better than that for a great pizza"}
{"text":"Pizza was better than the pasta entrees , ordered lasagna it was \"eh\" sad to say I prefer stoffers and that's not good ."}
{"text":"Menu redacted & wine list is humorous. Children behind the bar. Waitress breaking a glass and bleeding. Surprisingly a 98 health food score."}
{"text":"Best tomato sauce in Charlotte (so far, always looking), great Italian entrees and pizza, live Sinatra music on weekend nights, def recommend this mom and pop restaurant.? I recommend the raviolis!"}
{"text":"So I just discovered this place recently. Well, I knew it was here but I just hadn't stopped in. That changed a few weeks ago. Got a recommendation from a fellow employee and decided to check it out. I stopped in for lunch and did a take out order. I got the Philly Cheese Steak and fries. Wow, that's a lot of food. 11\" sub & a bucket of fries. The cheese steak was really good. I've been back since and the last two times I've gotten the meatball parm sub. For 8 bucks, this is a tasty and filling lunch option. No sides come with it but you don't need them with the size of this sandwich. Great flavor and I like the soft and chewy bread. Fair warning: let that thing cool down a bit, it'll gitcha if you're not careful. A burnt mouth: ain't no one got time for that."}
{"text":"You know what, good for you Angela's...against all odds, you hold your own...Kudos to you!

This place is located in a very unassuming shopping center off of Margaret Wallace Road.  There used to be a snowcone place on the same strip and it was robbed so they closed down.  The gas station across the street tends to bring about every criminal in the greater metro area and truly there is nothing else on this side of town worth your while so you have to be intentionally seeking out Angela's if you don't live in this area.

All that to say---even though it doesn't have the glitz and glam or the notoriety of other restaurants, they truly do hold their own.  Their pizza is very good (crispy crust, not soggy), their meatballs and marinara sauce are very good (trademark of any good Italian restaurant), their calzones are tasty and even their salads are good.  The atmosphere is that of a typical, old school Italian restaurant..nothing great. 

I would say if you happen to be in this area then stop by...but chances are you aren't going to be in this area if you don't live over here but I would advise making it your business to give Angela's a try if you are craving good solid Italian food.  We all know that Charlotte is hurting a little bit in terms of authentic Italian restaurants and Angela's definitely puts a band-aide on that problem.  Give them a try, they won't disappoint."}
{"text":"Finally gotten a chance to try Angela's and I was a bit taken aback.  It's very unassuming on the outside, but nicely decorated on the inside... I felt a bit bad walking in with a t-shirt and shorts.

The menu is pretty big with a ton of options.  I ended up getting a glass of Cab Sav and the special:  baked cheese ravioli.  It was very good.

Our waitress was polite... a bit absent at times.  Didn't really affect the meal though.

The house salad dressing a creamy tomato basil dressing was pretty good.  At first I almost defaulted to ranch, but our server listed all of them off.

The portions are big, and the prices are  proportional to the dishes.  I'd say it's a solid 3-star that I want to give 4 to, but nothing really wowed me about my first visit."}
