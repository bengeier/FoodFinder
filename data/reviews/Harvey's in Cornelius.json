{"text":"Went to Harvey's the first week it opened, was not very impressed.  Decided to give item another try.  Started with the hummus, buffalo chicken doesn't sound  extremely tempting but it was rather quite a surprise.  Waitress was good our drinks kept flowing at a very good pace. My wife had a cheeseburger, frozen patty. Priced accordingly for a frozen patty. I tried the ribs, they were juicy and good flavor. The place had a good atmosphere.  Everyone seemed to be having a good time. There was one bartender, who seemed to be keeping it together. A plus grade for her. Band started at 8:30, they played good music and made the atmosphere better. Until the band started, there was music playing but it was not very loud, could have been louder for my taste.  We will definitely go again"}
{"text":"This is one of several Cornelius locations that have housed so many different restaurants that they struggle to distinguish themselves. but Harvey's has been here awhile, and it is a big space that was nearly full on a Friday night.  I had a salmon with a chimichurri sauce -- it was an interesting combination and tasty.  My wife's quesadilla and my side dishes were not quite as warm as they should have been.  My draft beer arrived without a head and tasted a little flat.  Still, it has a good menu and a good vibe."}
{"text":"Food and menu is great.  Great value too. The place needs to be cleaned outside is the only reason I give a 4 star rating. The ashtray out front needs emptied and the front doors were not cleaned.  I'd recommend they have an employee clean a little while they are standing around.  It is  not busy; therefore that can't be the excuse.  Great wraps, buffalo chicken, and southern Philly steak.  Enjoy!  Go Obama!  You rock!"}
{"text":"The best fish tacos in town, and the service is always great."}
{"text":"Great restaurant!  Waitress was awesome!  Food was great!  Wished we would of tried the nachos.  Kids liked the food and were happy.  Which made parents happy"}
{"text":"We had a great meal at Harvey's..love the new location, short walk from our home. Food was great and came out quickly. Kids \"coloring hat\" was fun and electronic swipe to pay bill made it easy to go when time to leave.  Looking forward to coming back soon!"}
{"text":"The location, food and service are good. Very reasonable prices for what you get. The wait is super short during the week, but on the weekend, especially when it's nice out, expect to wait longer. Kids eat free on Tuesdays. I love the chicken wrap."}
{"text":"Great pub with a wonderful craft beer selection and food.  I would recommend it to anyone.  Also, you can watch App State games here and save the time of driving up to Boone, or elswhere.  Looking forward to attending one of their beer dinners soon."}
{"text":"The service was so-so. We had to track down the waitress to get a water refill. No other drinks were refilled. A children's macaroni & cheese was $5 and consisted of approximately 5 spoonfuls of Kraft macaroni & cheese. A side of macaroni & cheese the same size was $2. We questioned the waitress, but she said that's just the way it is. The chicken tenders and a side of macaroni & cheese was $11. The food was decent, but WAY overpriced.   We will not be returning."}
{"text":"Nothing to write about. Only good thing is the 2 minute to Cornelius drafthouse!"}
{"text":"Well it's official folks. If you live in or are visiting the Lake Norman area and someone mentions they are headed to Harvey's, you might want to ask them to clarify which one. As of this month Harvey's has opened it's second location in LKN, and the new spot is off Exit 28 in Cornelius, on the site of the old RJ Gators.  We saw the news on the original bar's Facebook site so started following the new one until they announced it's soft opening.  We were headed out of town the next day with some friends so all five of us headed over to check out their first night and to sample some beers alongside the new menu.  The first thing you will notice is this place has a lot more room than Harvey's in Vermilion. There is actually a surplus of floor space so much so that on opening day at least 1/4 of the restaurant was completely open.  I'm unsure how they will utilize this space, but if you ever went into Harvey's in Huntersville on a busy night, then you know the extra space is needed. Also given this store is now just one big floor you get a larger wrap around bar with over 24 taps. Immediately out of the gates they were already carrying one of my favorite beers Lonerider Deadeye Jack, so that alone makes me a new regular.  Harvey's has always been known for running great beer specials and this location is no different, so check on Facebook for what night you can cash in on $3 drafts and cheaper domestic selections.  As far as the menu, we tried their hot/bbq wings which were very good and had a delicious amount of spice to them, we also went with two pizzas the buffalo chicken pizza, and I believe it was called the meatza pizza.  The latter being the better, but only because with first night rush, they seemed to have thrown our chicken on after the fact as it was laying on top and not baked under the cheese, but no worries they were packed for an unofficial grand opening. Rumor is the owner or chef use to work with Brixx so if you like their pizza offerings then expect a similar style of pie here at Harveys.  Overall I am pretty excited this place exists now, although it may seem odd to have another bar open just two exits down from the original if you live near exit 28, you know there are very little options to bring you out to watch Football short of Prosciuttos. Because of that I'm hoping this place will shine given it's now offering the most taps in Cornelius and is already backed by the reputation it's built in Huntersville.  We will definitely be back to catch a game, and I'm looking forward to seeing which craft brews they will rotate next."}
{"text":"This is a great alternative to a nearby (also great) restaurant called Alton's. The food here is fantastic, great drink specials, and a nice environment. Service is spot on. Try blackened shrimp tacos!  Yum. Look forward to more visits here."}
{"text":"We stopped in on a Sunday evening after a beer across the parking lot. I ordered the Arizona BLT which was a decent sandwich. They had a special for $3 mystery beer and we couldn't help but take advantage. Unlike other places with \"mystery beer\" specials, we actually ended up with good local beers! I will definitely be back to enjoy that special again!  As a whole, a nice place to kick back and watch a game while enjoying good food and beer."}
{"text":"Yesterday we had Harveys cater a party. The food was excellent and the presentation as well. It was reasonably priced and everything got eaten. People enjoyed the food so much they asked if I could get the recipe for the dry rub on the chicken wings as well as the outstanding pimento cheese pineapple ring. I will definitely use them again. Thank you Harveys for making my birthday special."}
{"text":"We went here for the Wicked Weed Beer dinner. It was a good crowd and although I didn't care for half of the beers the food was very good. I feel like they could've used another server as it was a large group. I was impressed that the chefs were able and willing to adjust there courses to different people's dietary needs. I will definitely go to another. The only thing I didn't like was that between courses they did not exchange the silverware. I feel like they should've at least gave you a new fork for dessert. Also extra napkins were never offered or delivered when requested. To be fair there was only one server taking care of 60 people. She only had help busing and delivering courses. I still feel like she did a great job as did the chefs. We had a good time and will be back again so thanks to the chefs"}
{"text":"I went there it there was all white people in there- made me super uncomfortable. There is nothing special about this place; just another sports bar filled with un motivated post grads looking for a place to watch the game while they talk about there  #firstworldproblems. The wifi was terrible and forced me to make eye contact and engage in stimulating conversation. I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy. To sum upon the place is painfully subpar and you should save up instead of spending it on contributing to the heart issues you'll probably develop later in life from eating so many burgers from painfully average places such as Harveys."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch in between bridal shopping with a friend. Better than expected! Menu is variable, ranging from salads, pastas, burgers, sandwiches, wings and more. I went with the southwestern chicken wrap with a side salad. Wrap was tasty, and their homemade balsamic dressing is very delicious. I could dip anything into it. We also tried the philly cheesesteak quesadillas, which were tasty and served with a good aioli dipping sauce.   It looks like they have a stage so wondering about entertainment - have never been at night. Right across from Alton's and easily accessible from jetton road. Hope to be back here!  Food was better than average. They also have a nice outdoor patio area for the warmer months."}
{"text":"Get the Spinach Artichoke Chicken it comes with rice, but I sub mash potatoes. It's awesome!!"}
{"text":"Heck of a good steak (filet) the other night!  They've taken the best of Harvey's & Block Bistro, in Huntersville, and put much of that concept on the menu.  The beer is cold, the staff is friendly, plenty of TV's, and various forms of seating.  Worth your gander."}
{"text":"First timers to Harvey's. Saw a groupon and thought we'd give it a try. Was expecting burgers and apps but was met with quite a large assortment of options.    We settled on the margarita pizza add pepperoni a little well done and seriously most excellent. Thin crust and very much like a true pizza I've had in Italy. I don think it would travel very well since it's very thin crust but fresh out of the oven yummarama! I would give this pizza a 5. I will be back for this pizza :)  Also, ordered the onion rings which were a bit heavy/greasy for my liking but they did taste homemade. Not sure of they were homemade or not but they tasted freshly cut and dipped. Id give them a 2.5.   Got there on Monday at 1130 and 1 truck in the lot but they were opened.  Patronage picked up as noon came. The gentlemen that greeted and waited on us was friendly and attentive but not hovering.  Who I think was the owner stopped by to check on us also.    We will be back, thanks for a yummy lunch."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I frequent this restaurant and have not had a bad experience yet! Went tonight for their half price wings and they were delicious! Never had a bad server or bad food. Server Olivia does a great job! BLT and salmon salad is also great!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood bar with excellent and very friendly staff. Good place to watch sports, play trivia on Wednesday nights (packed), or host a party or event in one of the large spaces.  Great pizzas, burgers, salads, and sandwiches.  Sweet potato fries are recommended.  Perfect place for a tasty craft beer on tap.  Some of the other reviews are obviously expecting more than a friendly neighborhood pub!"}
{"text":"First I'm going to start by saying I don't give bad reviews usually. I live in the neighborhood by Harvey's and we have been frequent for lunch here. Food isn't great, but it works for families with kids. Today, we decided to try brunch. It was empty at 10:20, and with a two year old we were excited because we thought it would be quick. We ordered tater tots to start. Took 45 min for those to come out, with no dipping sauce. Had to ask 2 different people just to get that. So now, its an hour for tater tots. At this point our toddler and us were done, so just canceled order. We noticed no one in there seemed to be eating food! Waitress asked us if we wanted food to go, which is a joke, because who wants eggs to go? We won't be returning and will let all our friends know around neighborhood how awful it is there. This place won't last. It's always dead and slow. Go to Altons instead!"}
{"text":"Oh crap, I should have finished writing my review for Harvey's immediately after dining there, because now, for the life of me, I can't remember what I had for dinner.   That alone may speak volumes about my experience; but what I can piece together from my poor memory was that the evening was in total, immemorable.   Food, service, atmosphere all mediocre.  Not the type of place I'd choose to eat a full blown meal at again, but perhaps grab a beer, some wings and watch a few games."}
{"text":"Thursday night and tables empty. Service was not good and order was wrong after waiting almost an hour for 10 wings and a burger. Not sure what was going on this evening."}
{"text":"Harvey's is back in Cornelius.  You will also see a review that I wrote about Harvey's in Cornelius that was not very flattering.   A bit of history to put things in perspective. Harvey's first opened in Huntersville a number of years ago and several years after that, they opened a second location at the corner of Liverpool Pkwy and W. Catawba here in Cornelius. They had many issues with both the physical facility (more like a drafty warehouse) and the quality of the food and service were never up to the standards of the Huntersville location.  After a period of time,, they  closed that place which was probably about two years ago, maybe longer. When Peninsula China Bistro closed, the moved into the space, renovated it and came back to Cornelius.  Been open a couple of months now but last night was the first time my wife and I had a chance to try it.  It's definitely a positive addition to the Cornelius dining scene. Nicely appointed decor, heavy on dark wood, beautiful bar and being a sports bar, a large array of Big Screen TV's  Very good service. We were seated immediately and our server was attentive through out our dining experience.  My wife chose the Grilled Chicken Salad but asked if she could substitute Grilled Salmon for the Chicken. They readily agreed to the change.  The menu listed an Eastern Style NC BBQ Sandwich which I decided to try along with a side of tater tots.  My wife enjoyed her Salmon while I enjoyed my BBQ. Only comment would be on the Eastern NC BBQ Sauce. Eastern Style Sauce for those not familiar with it is basically  a Pepper Vinegar. This was a bit sweet and could have used a bit more heat. Still very good however.  This place is a keeper and we will be back.  As for my previous review, remember that it's actually a review of a restaurant that no longer exists. Would have been cleaner if they would have deleted that entry and started over."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! My new favorite place for brunch and lunch! Not too big, so it has a neighborhood bar feel. Food is great and the service was top notch.   Going back in a couple of days!"}
{"text":"This place was incredible !service was great! Thank you Melissa. Charlie greeted us. Very nice man. Co-owner with  Joshua. I look forward to lunch again. Everything was wonderful."}
{"text":"We had dinner here on Christmas Eve. The restaurant itself had only a few people (since no local football teams were on TV), but we still received great service. The TVs around the bar were positioned well and I'm sure it's a good place to go on game night.  We ordered a pretty basic meal, a couple of burgers and drinks. My wife is new to America so she's going around trying new things. The waitress recommended a Moscow Mule which she greatly enjoyed (I tried a bit - well made!). I had a couple of Manhattans, also done well.  She had the vegetarian burger, which was great! My burger was also good, had caramelized onions and blue cheese crumbles. Also enjoyed the Cajun fries option. At the end, we shared a brownie dessert that was good. I think it was called \"peer pressure.\" Hot brownie, vanilla ice cream, what could go wrong?  Good value for good food - they had a pretty good array of options on the menu so I'm sure we'll be back to try something new."}
{"text":"A friend recommended Harvey's and we were not disappointed. My wfe and I both had the Harvey special hamburger and fries.  The burger was fantastic. Besides the yummy bacon the sandwitch comes out with a special honey mustard dipping sauce.  The fries were crisp but chewy inside.  We have tried many sandwitch restaurants and we agree that Harvey's is the best around.  The restaurant is huge with a new bar area, tables, booth and large private room.  So, if you are around the Lake Norman area, don't miss this opportunity for the \"best\" burger in town."}
{"text":"This is a great new bar to the area.  We have been to this location multiple times now without a single let down.  The service has always been really good especially when they are pretty busy.  The food has not been a let down either.  I recommend the wings and the Philly cheese steak.  They really have a great TV setup and management does not mind putting a game on for you at all.  I can't wait for the next visit!!"}
{"text":"Dined here for my first time last night! Wings were delicious. Beer selection was local which is awesome. The ambience was nice and loved loved loved the music choices. Amanda was our server, she was pleasant and very helpful! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here for lunch today.  The place was clean and the service was good, but we were not overly impressed with our food.  We ordered wings as an appetizer, but they came out with our entrees.  We wanted the wings first.  I ordered a steak salad and it was OK.  I have definitely had better; nothing to brag about.  My husband ordered the salmon with rice and veggies. Very nice presentation and he said it was good.  I didn't taste it.    Overall, our experience was just OK.  Again, nothing to complain about but then again just nothing to brag about either.  We probably won't go back.  Too many other restaurants within the area that we prefer more."}
{"text":"The food was good, but the atmosphere leaves a bit to be desired. The booths we sat at were not bolted to the ground and seemed worn and cheap. Our table and booth kept moving the entire meal. We sat next to a window, the blinds were dusty and dirty. There was food between the table and blinds...this was surprising with the restaurant being so new. We ordered the pub chips, would have been nice if they were warm....not just a basket of potato chips with ranch. My husband really liked his burger and my chicken wrap was just ok. Not much flavor. Just ok. Beer prices are good.   The biggest disappointment and surprise came when we finished our meal. The waitress walked over with her iPad and asks, without giving us our bill yet, cash or charge?  My husband then asks what the total for the bill was. She announces our amount and stands waiting for us to tell her cash o9r charge. We still have yet to see a bill...just our total read to us. My husband charges the amount on the iPad,  signs the iPad in front of her...all while she watches the tip we put on the iPad. It seemed very odd, weird and rude. I asked if we could have a paper bill, she said only of needed and in the back. We could have had the receipt emailed to us.  What happened to dropping a printed check out, leaving for customer to review, sign and leave tip in private.   Overall, it was a good meal...just some odd things. I'm not sure if we will be back..the payment at the end may have ruined it for me. Maybe I'm just old school..."}
{"text":"Food is delicious!! Great value! Very cool place for lunch or dinner! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Good neighborhood bar. I like to stop in for lunch. The fish tacos are some of the best in LKN. Pretty good local/craft beer selection for Exit 28. Service is usually pretty good too."}
{"text":"Visited the Cornelius location and I'd say it was more of a 3.5 but not a 3 so rounded up!   Visited twice and definitely preferred my first meal better which was spinach dip chicken with roasted potatoes- the dip was actual spinach dip which personally I would have thinned out to a sauce consistency for better eating but the flavors were definitely.  Hubby had the blackened shrimp  salad and loved so much so on our 2nd visit he ordered it again.  The 2nd visit for me was a huge let down. I opted for the black bean burger which arrived room temp void of flavor and dry!  The only saving grace was the roasted potatoes I enjoyed the same as the first visit.  On a positive side they give you a generous pour of wine ! We met one if the owners who seemed less than appreciative to met 2 patrons and quickly dismissed himself.  Its worth another visit but no black bean burger for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful meal at the newer location. Very nicely decorated. Nice patio too. I used to visit there other 2 Harvey's quite a bit about 4 years ago. But haven't lately. The food was awesome. They have a great selection of sides and they're all delicious. Kids meals are pretty standard. Our kids were wondering if maybe a chicken alfredo pasta could be an option. We enjoyed the southwest wrap with Cajun Adams potatoes and the blackened chicken sandwich with Cajun fries. We will definitely be back sokn"}
{"text":"First time to the new location in Cornelius. Live entertainment was great. Good beer list. Great staff.  Had the wings and they do them perfect. Crispy. Have couple options on how wings are prepared. I put them up with the best of them. Great view of all the tvs. Not sure why it took us so long to try it? Nice patio for outside seating. Def give them a try!"}
{"text":"This definitely feels like a locals hangout. The staff was very nice. The food is your average bar food. It is very close to the draft house. So you can eat here and then go grab a craft afterwards."}
{"text":"Decent burgers...not fresh but frozen. Decent fries. Slow service. That pretty much sums it up. Typical bar food variety."}
{"text":"Service was decent. Food was not very good. Fries were undercooked. Burger was obviously a frozen patty. Why even ask me how I would like it cooked? Cinnamon desert was a Texas cinnamon roll you would buy from a gas station with a scoop of vanilla on top. Way overpriced for what it is. Would be happy to pay $10 for a burger if it were a patty made in house."}
{"text":"Great salads, sandwiches, and apps. Owners are so friendly and all offer awesome customer service. Good beer and wine selection, too. Great addition to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! The atmosphere is great, the servers are always very nice and the food is delicious! I've had a few different things off the menu and always been pleasantly surprised. The owner seems to be very nice, he talked to us a bit about the beers on tap and the different breweries in NC. They also have great drink specials. I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"3.5 Stars, the food was reasonably priced, but I wasn't a big fan of their signature plate, the fish tacos. There was a good deal on beers the night that we went (Wednesday) and the service overall was pretty good. I feel there are better options out there, but is worth a visit to watch a game once in a while"}
{"text":"This is a review for the Cornelius location. Let me start by saying this is our first time visiting a Harvey's, so this isn't a complete review by any means. I hope to update once we've been to the location in Vermillion. Here goes, list-style.  Pros: -fast, friendly service (we had an awesome waitress) -great beer specials and a ton of taps -plenty of TV's with FIFA on -great looking, large interior  -good fries, cooked brown and well-seasoned -good beer-battered onion rings -inexpensive   Cons: -frozen burger patty :( -really dried out kaiser roll (maybe stale?) -bottled ranch dressing, blech -'homemade dipping sauce' for onion rings was just ketchup mixed with mayonnaise  My overall impression so far is that this is a place to go for beer and sports, not so much food. I hope that changes!"}
{"text":"We stopped into the new Cornelius location Harvey's on a Saturday night, the one that's now located by Harris Teeter off Jetton.    Pluses: ~It's a beautiful restaurant.   ~Not too large, it's about 60% bar & bar area seating and 40% booth seating.  We were able to walk in and get the very last booth available. ~The restaurant has numerous televisions, which has obviously become a staple in this genre. ~It's not too loud, you can hear the people you're dining with.  ~Service was immediate, very friendly and they do a very good job of attending to tables between the main server, back servers and I think even the host staff helped bus our tables, as we were ready. ~Food comes out lightning fast.  Literally.  We ordered and got our appetizers in under 5 minutes.  The menu is a traditional bar menu. Pricing is great for this genre.  They served both appetizers and something called \"snacks\", which I thought was a great idea.  Snacks are just little portions of snack-y things when you only want a taste or have young kids with you.  One of our group was really intrigued by the Waffles n' Bacon but ultimately decided to save it for another visit.  Our group of four started with two appetizers.  We got the Pepperjack Nachos with Roasted Chicken $8.99.  It was tortilla chips layered with pepper jack & cheddar, black beans, fresh jalapenos, pico de gallo, salsa and sour cream and we added the chicken for an upcharge.  I wasn't really a fan.  The toppings were minimal (we eventually found more on the bottom of the plate).  The chicken is plain and unseasoned and although cooked nicely, it didn't taste nice, it tasted like chicken straight out of the, err, chicken. I took a bite and thought, \"I hope I didn't order chicken for my dinner... oh, yeah, I did.\"    We also got the BBQ Chicken Quesadilla $6.99 at the recommendation of the server.  This was roasted chicken, pepper jack and cheddar, red onions, pico de gallo, sour cream, bbq sauce and cilantro.  If you look at my picture you'll see why everyone avoided it at first, with it's giant puddle of bbq sauce.  It has all things that I like, but I didn't like it, with the tasteless chicken and bbq sauce soup over top. :(  For dinner our friend got BBQ wings which she absolutely loved. $6.50.    Her husband got the good lookin' Honey Swiss Chicken $9.50 which was Harvey's honey mustard dressing over grilled chicken breast with applewood bacon and melted Swiss served with L.T.O on brioche.    He paired it with some nicely done housemade chips that could be elevated a bit with an automatic side of ranch to dip them in.  My husband got the cutely named Jetton Village Burger which was a 1/2 pound medium rare burger topped with sharp cheddar, thick cut bacon and medium fried egg topped with L.T.O on brioche.  $11.50.  It looked really good and he cut it before I could take a picture but it got only an \"OK\" from him. (Still searching for that perfect Lake Norman area burger!)  I ordered the Southwestern Chicken Wrap $8.50 filled with that unseasoned chicken again, fresh spinach, chipotle guacamole, tomatoes, black beans, cheddar/jack cheeses and a spicy cilantro chili sour cream sauce.  Again, filled with items I love, but the protein always drives the ultimate decision and the lackluster chicken pulled it down to dull.  I opted for the cajun fries, which our server also recommended and while I liked them, I drank two entire glasses of water before I could flag our server down to get some ranch on the side to cool them down.  Yummy, but consider yourself warned!  We all had a good laugh over what turned out to be a new addition to the menu \"Buy the Kitchen a round $6\".  We asked our server about it and she had never seen it before.  Can't help but wonder if it would have gotten my chicken seasoned!  LOL  All and all, I admit that I am a big bar food fan, ((fried mozzarella sticks are my comfort zone (and disappointingly missing here)).  And that being said, I was the least fond of the food here, out of those from our table.    However, on the plus side, Harvey's in Cornelius is new in this location, and people don't really know about it yet, so your chance of getting a seat during prime time is pretty good.  The restaurant is attractive, comfortable and has great atmosphere.  The service is prompt and very friendly.  Tables are bused quickly and politely as you finish your plates.    One thing was sort of uncomfortable though... you don't get a check, you get presented with the server's iPad for payment.  So the server has to stand there...as you have to immediately stop talking to your table... to immediately pull out your credit card... and as a result, of course, the server must also stand there while you decide on a tip, as they watch.  Very uncomfortable for the server and very uncomfortable for the patrons.  That needs to be fixed quickly.  So, all in all, good hangout place, nicely located, good place to meet friends and food is well-priced for the genre."}
{"text":"A bar atmosphere but the wings were really good. They have live music and that is very nice. We had an artichoke dip and I will say I woudl rather pay 2.00 more an have a little bit more but that was my only complaint. The portion seemed very small for the amount of chips they give you to eat it with. Maybe have two sizes.  But the dip was very tasty and fresh. The beers were very good"}
{"text":"Got a couple of apps to split between the table including the potato skins and nachos. Skins were ok, pretty solid but pretty average, but I loved the nachos! They were absolutely loaded with toppings and there were more than enough to share between 5 people.  For my entree I got the salmon with a double side of vegetables. The salmon was just a tad too well for my personal taste but the flavor and seasoning was pretty good. The vegetables were nothing to write home about, but they were served in good portions.  Restaurant is pretty casual with many larger TVs to watch the big game.  Service was good and pretty fast.  Overall, nothing too special, but a solid restaurant nonetheless."}
