{"text":"I was really excited about coming here.  I had heard they had great service and tasty pizza.  I wasn't quite sure what to expect when first walking in but was quickly underwhelmed by the very basic decor.  We were greeted by the waitress and seated promptly.  The menu is pretty plain as far as layout goes, nothing really seems to stand out.  I ordered chicken fettuccine alfredo, my daughter ordered fettuccine alfredo, and my husband ordered the barbecue chicken pizza.  We also ordered cheese curds for an appetizer.

There was only one waitress working and even though it was just us and one other table, she seemed to be a little overwhelmed.  Our cheese curds came out in decent time and were very good and squeaky!  Our entrees took a little longer than I would have liked but still in a reasonable amount of time.

My husband said that while his pizza was flavorful, the crust seemed to be a little flimsier than he would prefer.  My chicken fettuccine alfredo was pretty blah.  I've had more flavorful alfredo sauce at Olive Garden.  I also found a small piece of chocolate chip pancake in my meal, which is pretty odd and really threw me off.  The table next to us had some kids that were having chocolate chip pancakes so I assume that's where it came from but I still can't figure out logistically how it could have happened as their pancakes came out way before my meal did.  

I was a little irritated that while my daughter is only 5, that she didn't get a full serving of fettuccine alfredo.  It wasn't on the kids menu so I figured we would just get an adult sized portion and have leftovers.  Her portion was much smaller than mine but only $3.50 cheaper.  I would have much rather paid for an adult meal at that price.  Her meal alone was $7 and that was just for fettuccine alfredo; no drinks or sides.  

Overall it was an okay experience.  Our total came to $42 for 2 adult meals, a kids meal, and an appetizer.  We all had water to drink.  I can't say we will be back to the actual restaurant but we may order pizza for delivery sometime.  If we do come back it will either be for breakfast or to check out their Friday fish fry."}
{"text":"A friend and I had lunch here on a Friday and were glad we did.  I had the club sandwich with fries and my friend had the quesadilla appetizer.  We both liked our choices -- my sandwich was warm and tasty with ham, turkey, bacon, cheese, lettuce and tomato.  The quesadilla was very good and had chipotle seasoning and the scoop of guacamole was surprisingly pretty.  My friend ordered a taco pizza to go and it looked and smelled great -- lots of toppings to enjoy.  The host and server was the owner, a nice fellow and eager to please.  Service was prompt. They serve breakfast all day and have a few Mexican dishes as well as classic Italian and pizza choices.  I am sure we'll go again."}
{"text":"They have Chocolate Shoppe ice cream so we go there often!  The pizza is good (although they only have one crust option and it's a wee too thick for me), and we haven't tried anything else."}
{"text":"Really good food and just nice people. It was after breakfast time but they let me have breakfast, and they even made a special meatball and bacon pizza."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, yummy food, and convenient parking. Laid-back atmosphere and now serving breakfast - definitely recommend! Delicious pizza omelette!"}
