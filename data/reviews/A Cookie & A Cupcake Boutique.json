{"text":"I went in with my preschool class and it was a bit overwhelming trying to put in 9 orders for children. The employee working was helpful. But was odd this ice cream spot didn't have kid sizes. I asked for coffee and said it was fine to wait as it had to be made. I grabbed a cookie to go with my coffee and proceed to pay with my card. I was told it was a $10 minimum. The employee asked if I wanted to add more to my bill. I said no thank you and left without anything. Glad the kids were able to eat. I will not be returning as this is super frustrating."}
{"text":"What I loved the most was the friendly service and knowledge of not only the deserts but the history of the place.  The cupcakes are great and the flavors go so well together. Nutella cupcake was just perfect not too much to get your tummy hurting but just enough to make the perfect combination of chocolate and hazulnut.  As for the ice cream, cashew (a flavor I have never tried) left me wanting more than just one scoop and the pictures of the wedding cake's have a potential buyer (simple yet inviting and pkeasent) Great place"}
{"text":"Grade Scale 1-5 All around 3 Taste 3 Presentation 2 Good tasting. A little to sweet. Just the right amount of frosting. Fun presentation but kind of sloppy.  The Cupcake Reviewer Inc"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place; I've had their cupcakes multiple times which are beyond delicious (to the point where you kind of can't stop eating them). What really knocks my socks off about the place is their attention to detail and the flavor of their baked goods. I ordered a cake for a birthday last year also just a few weeks ago; their staff is personable, helpful and very accommodating in terms of when you can pick up your cake and what design you want (by the way they NAILED a silly inside joke I wanted on my cake that made the recipients birthday that much better).  The best part was that it was hands down the BEST cake I have ever tasted in my life (Bavarian buttercream with a chocolate ganache frosting).   I will keep coming back until my doctor tells me not to (and then give them a cupcake/cake so they can see why I still go back)."}
{"text":"We shared a brown butter cupcake, a flavor I haven't tasted in maybe 40 years and a scoop of salted caramel ice cream. Not sure how either could have tasted better. Really good flavors your don't see everyday. Perfect sized serving (for people who don't want to gain six pounds in one sitting.) Pleasant staff person. Uses Square for credit card transactions and doesn't take cards for under $10, so bring cash, because, unless you are buying for a scout troop, you won't go over the $10."}
{"text":"Overall, very tasty with many seemingly unique flavors. HOWEVER, there is no public restroom. It's pretty inconvenient when you have kids with you."}
{"text":"Purchased 4 cupcakes (cookie monster, carrot cake,  red velvet, PB around 2 in the afternoon service so so by 7 in the evening when desserts were ready to be served the were dry and sponge.  Not impressed.  Campbell's way better."}
{"text":"The store was cute, pink, and clean, and the cashier was super friendly and welcoming. The cupcakes were cutely designed, but they weren't too special as far as taste. Perhaps this was because I wandered in late?"}
{"text":"Very disappointing.  I had never bought anything from them but had heard lots of good comments.  Ordered a birthday carrot cake from them that was horrible. The \"cake\" was mostly icing with very little carrot cake in it. Considering that a 9\" cake is $40 I truly expected a lot more than what I received. I think that if I were ever to go back I will just stick to the cupcakes and not order a true cake."}
{"text":"I came here last week after work. I chose the brownie bites and 4 cupcakes. The cupcakes I chose were (in order of picture) Salted caramel, the best one imo, Apple, espresso, and the signature. They were all very good. The signature one had a cookie on it that was great, but the filling in the cake was way off center and too little in quantity other than that everything was perfect. The brownie bites are super yummy."}
{"text":"I want to give this place a try and see if they had some good tasting cupcakes and ice cream so,  I got a sample of the ice cream and it was OK we  placed an order for a cheesecake on a stick and for cupcakes in also my daughter get another type of cheese cake on the stick, We sat car in decided try are tasty snacks and the best thing about this place was the customer service I just paid $21 for customer service they should not be making in cheesecakes or cupcakes of any can.  it just wasn't good and I want them to know that they need to get their baking skills up because they are robbing people in the community of their money"}
{"text":"I absolutely adore this new location!  I stopped in to get boss' day cupcakes and, as always, they were prompt and courteous.  The new space offers so much more for this little shop.  I look forward to bringing my husband here in the future for a date night!"}
{"text":"Yum! Enjoying my thin mint chocolate cupcake as I write! Plenty of thick, delicious frosting with a perfectly fluffy cake underneath.   They also have Churned ice cream, with unique flavors such as a savory Garlic ice cream (It's actually very tasty!) and Lavender.   I would have liked to see more interesting cupcake flavors...(Think Irish Cream or Bacon-Topped), and my only other critique would be to spruce up the store a little...(think chic chandeliers, fun tables, a fresh coat of paint) and the cupcake display seemed a little empty and not presented as nicely as I would have thought. With a few improvements I can see a lot of couples and women to stay for a cupcake and coffee after dinner at one of any one of Tremont's lovely restaurants.   Be back soon! Mmm!"}
{"text":"Picked up a few cookies and half dozen cupcakes. Delicious and moist cupcakes w creative flavors. Little on the expensive side AND worth it.... Likely the BEST cupcake in Clevo"}
{"text":"Called ahead of time and tried to get gluten free cupcakes for my bestfriends birthday. After waiting an eternity for someone else to order the clerk informed me they were out. Apparently the \"home office\" doesnt communicate with the store front. Thanks for wasting a 40 minutes literally doing nothing to help me."}
{"text":"Where to start?  The best and most delicious cupcakes I have ever tried, in ANY city.  The staff are always nice.  Except the fact that I did try to go into the South Euclid store a few weeks ago--the door was *open* and some girl was in there chatting with the cashier and he said \"Sorry, we're closed\" (there were still plenty of cupcakes in the case).  So...he's socializing with the door open but they're closed?  Also, I hadn't been to this place since I moved back almost 6 mos ago, so I *really* wanted a cupcake lol.  I would've bought 4 on the spot!  Oh well, they lost out on their money.  Other than that, I'll definitely be back and like this company.  PS- someone mentioned a $10 min and I was told that as well (for credit cards).  They are a small business and charge enough for their goods that they can afford the credit card fees.  And if they don't, then they should up their prices.  Requiring a certain amount to purchase is classist.  It's also actually illegal and companies are not allowed to do that.  I'll be contacting the BBB to report."}
{"text":"I have had their cupcakes several times throughout the years. The cupcakes have a little too much frosting on them in my opinion, but I've never gotten a cupcake that was dried out. They have a variety of flavors and even vegan cupcakes. The vegan cupcakes are a bit more dense and have a little bit of a fudgy texture as opposed to the cake like texture of a regular cupcake. Better to pre-order them if you know you will need them as they only make a few each day.  I couldn't pick a favorite but I do appreciate the cookie monster cupcake and the German chocolate.    They also have ice cream now and have some unique flavors.  I've tried it before, but to be honest, I wasn't in the mood for ice cream so I haven't given it a fair shot.  Their cookies are not my favorite as they are a bit on the crispy side. Their newer location on W 14th is adorable and it gives you a reason for a nice walk before you grab dessert."}
{"text":"I used to go to ACAC a couple of years ago. I don't know why I stopped! The shop is so cute & the employees are very friendly & helpful. They always have a nice variety of cupcakes that are fresh. Their cupcakes aren't topped with a ridiculously amount of super sweet frosting. Their frosting is sweet but not overly sweet like some other cupcake shops. The cupcake part is moist & is filled with either icing or with a filling. I love that little surprise when biting into their cupcakes! My absolute favorite cupcakes from here is the salted caramel, red velvet, & the pb cupcakes."}
{"text":"I stopped in after lunch recently for a cupcake. Pro tip: get there early. By early afternoon, there were very few cupcakes left total in just a few flavors. I'm not sure if I really got the whole \"experience\" but it was still nice to stop in.  The inside is very minimal. They have a cute mural on the wall, but that's the extent of the decor. They have adult tables and kiddie tables. There's plenty of natural light. The gal helping me was chatty and genuinely excited about the cupcakes. I came in for a cupcake but really ended up with ice cream. The same owner of A Cookie & A Cupcake owns Churned, an ice cream company that sells both scoops and pints in the bakery. They had some interesting flavors like paprika, pumpkin cream cheese, and wasabi gin. I ended up trying a few samples and getting a pint of raspberry sorbet to go-- it has an awesome tart flavor to it.  I'll definitely stop back in the next time i'm in the neighborhood. I don't have any kids in my life, but all the little loves in your life will adore this bakery! Like I said, there weren't a lot of cupcakes left but they had flavors I would like to try next time, like Thin Mint, Champagne, and Blueberry Apple Crumble. I didn't have any issues finding a street parking spot for free, so don't be discouraged to stop by to visit!"}
{"text":"As much as I like these cupcakes - & daaaaamn are these delicious cupcakes - I'll be buying mine at Grandma Campbell's at the WSM from now on, whenever possible. I've found the staff here to be generally lacking & even unfriendly, which is exactly the opposite of what you expect at a place as fun & whimsical as a cupcake shop. (To be fair, I've had the same girl ring me up all three times I've been... maybe the other staffers are nicer?!)  The staff's general lack of giving a damn makes this otherwise fairly small matter feel like a bigger one, but: I also really dislike their $10 credit card minimum, which means you have to buy at LEAST four cupcakes if you want to use a card. I know credit card fees are high these days, but seriously? I can't buy a singular cupcake? If Civilization down the road lets people put a 75-cent iced coffee refill on a card (& it does!), I would think that ACAC, consistently rated the most popular cupcake shop in town, could make it work so that customers can buy a standalone cupcake. We don't all need a dozen!  In other words? Yes to the cupcakes, but no the place, which means no overall. Too bad, because that cookie dough cupcake is sooooo darn delicious!"}
{"text":"My favorite cupcakes in all of Cleveland! The icing is sooooo good! I have tried a variety of flavors from red velvet, signature vanilla, gluten free vanilla, grasshopper, and lemon raspberry! They are all delicious but my favorite was definitely the lemon raspberry. Would eat these everyday if I could. The best. :) A must try!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing visit. Stopped in with my hubby to support Small Business Saturday and found the cupcakes looking old with few options, the cookies tasting stale, and the ice cream tasting freezer-burned. The counter help was not friendly and unenthusiastic. It is highly unlikely we will visit again, unfortunately. The original location was better....."}
{"text":"I make it a point to stop here for a cupcake every time i am in the area. Love the flavors and combinations, and their ice cream flavors are to die for as well. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. You can email in orders, which is convenient for me. I've gotten a cake from here before, which looks for different from any cakes-including your typical grocery store cakes, but also other local bakeries. This month, I ordered 45 cookies that they individually wrapped and the even used ribbon with my wedding color. They were just what I needed for the rehearsal dinner dessert."}
{"text":"I haven't been here since they moved from their old tremont location.  I got 4 cupcakes. I tried them all, but didnt love any of them. They tasted fresh, but there was nothing impressive about them, nothing that would make me want to come back. My favorite part of one of the cupcakes was the filling in the apple cinnamon.  That was great. Also the apple compote on that cupcake was pretty good.  The frosting texture was sort of odd on all of them. Like gel and whipped cream mixed  together. The cake tasted good but nothing special. I have had boxed cake mixes that taste similar.    The cupcakes were all big and nicely decorated. The shop was big and clean. I just wasn't into the cupcakes. :/ Their cheesecake looked like it might be good. Maybe i will try one of those next time..."}
{"text":"My favorite cupcake place in Cleveland, maybe anywhere, but was pretty disappointed this time. I stopped in and purchased 8 cupcakes. Here is my review:  Nutella - completely lacked Nutella flavor. It tasted like a chocolate cupcake.  Salted caramel - always delicious, the best cupcake they have in my opinion Signature - this was for someone else, but I got to taste it and it was good, basic, but cute especially for kiddos.  Cookie crumble - tasted like a regular chocolate cupcake. Husband had one and agreed.  Malted milk - again no flavor and tasted like a chocolate cupcake. I tried the icing separate and still nothing that reminded me of malt. Husband had one and agreed.  Vanilla Frappuccino - tasty, but which it was their regular espresso!   I also purchased gluten free vanilla and a cookie crumble for friends. The GF vanilla was cold because they keep in in the fridge. My friend wishes it hadn't been, but liked it. Her hubby loved cookie crumble and said it was the best cupcake he'd ever had."}
{"text":"I used to love Cookie and a Cupcake. In fact, I loved them so much my husband and I used them for our wedding. I was back in Cleveland for Christmas break and was so excited to have my favorite salted caramel cupcakes. When we arrived about an hour after opening on a Saturday morning, my family and I thought it was weird they already had low stock. They were out of several flavors and low on everything else. I assumed it was just a busy morning.  In reality, they sold us day old cupcakes. They were beyond stale and stuck to the bottom of the liners, like they had been sitting in crusty caramel goop quite a bit. They crumbled everywhere when biting into them, something a fresh and moist cupcake should not do. My whole family (who adored them at our wedding and also have had these several times) also agreed. Shame on them. If you need to get rid of old stock, you need to advertise it a such. Don't let people believe they are getting fresh cupcakes and charging full price. Even Panera doesn't sell old items."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore A Cookie & A Cupcake and their sister shop Churred Ice Cream.  Their salty caramel and grasshoppers cupcakes are to die for.  Just the right amount of moist cake to sweet fluffy frosting filled to perfection with just a bit of either the caramel sauce in the salty caramel or mint frosting in their grasshopper.    ACAC also servers Gluten Free (chocolate, vanilla or red velvet) just make sure to ask what they have in stock that day if it's not in the case already.  They also have vanilla, chocolate and red velvet Vegan cupcakes on a rotating basis.  If you come here for ice cream I recommend the captain crunch, they use cereal milk to make the actually ice cream - it's just like having a bowl of the cereal.  AMAZING!  TIP - they also release special limited edition flavors on Fridays so make sure to follow them on social media to keep up and make sure you don't miss something truly luscious and unique."}
{"text":"Great cupcakes. Ice cream is delicious, many many Flavors! Comfortable seating, plated seating. Great parking. Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"This is honestly what I imagine heaven would smell and taste like. I have never had a better cupcake than cookie and a cupcake!!! One of my favorites is the strawberry cupcake... It is a vanilla base cupcake with fresh strawberries and custard in the middle with a fantastic fluffy frosting on top!!! The peanut butter cupcake and the carrot cupcake are amazing also!!! Ugh I'm drooling right now!   Also they have gluten free for my hubby!!! I just LOVE this place!!! My thighs definitely regret it but they are worth every bite!!"}
{"text":"The worst experience .... the cake looked awful and they refused to help. Left with nothing and will never be back ."}
{"text":"Always friendly, always fresh and always fun!  The cupcakes are perfect-- the right amount of cake to frosting ratio and not too big. The flavors change some but it is fun to try some of the seasonal ones as well as their tried and true basics.  Definitely my favorite cupcake place in the CLE."}
{"text":"This would be my second visit to the W.14th location and didn't disappoint...well maybe a little.  I had my taste buds set on the Salted Caramel cupcake but they didn't have many cupcakes left.  Besides the vegan cupcakes, they only had maybe two or three flavors left, so I opted for the Red Velvet. The cream cheese frosting is really good and creamy (with a little extra surprise in the middle) and the cupcake itself is moist.  I did post on the old location's page in regards to the ice cream which is really good.   Definitely a return visit and get my hands on the Salted Caramel Cupcake"}
