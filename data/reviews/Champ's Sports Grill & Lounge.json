{"text":"This is a fantastic dive bar that allows smoking. The real draw is the food. I was skeptical because of the number of reviews but this place totally delivered. The hot sausage sandwich is killer dive bar food. Check out the the pictures of the menu from March 2017 and definitely check this place out. Super friendly staff and locals. Don't let the outside scare you away. A real diamond in the rough."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots. Good crowd and fantastic food! The portions are hefty and the prices are not! I could honestly say I have not ordered one thing not worth getting again from here."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and awesome friendly atmosphere. Perfect mix of dive and sports bar. Came here with some friends to watch the final sports ball game between Germany and Argentina, was not at all disappointed. 

They have a good mix of bar food (burgers, fried clams, sausage sandwichs) and entrees (chicken linguine, baked scrod, pork chops) all of which are surprisingly tasty and inexpensive. 
The sports atmosphere is comfortable too, (I'm not into sports myself) a half dozen or so tvs and none of the macho stuff I don't generally care for. 

Don't be deceived by the lackluster building, go enjoy some awesome and cheap food in this great little spot!"}
