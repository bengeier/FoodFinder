{"text":"They have the best quality and tasting food! Everything is human grade (actually better quality than most of us eat). 
Excellent customer service."}
{"text":"Our English bulldog looooves her treats here, especially the Breath Buster Pup-sicles! First met Marlyn at a Farmers Market awhile back and the passion she has for her business just oozes out of her, which is why we keep coming back! Knowledgeable and genuine owners! Just checked out her shop and it was super cute! Clean and organized! This will be the first time Remii tries the meal, but I'm sure she'll love it!"}
{"text":"LOVE Fido's Kitchen! Our doggies love the food and the store and the owners are amazing. Every time I walk into the store, it feels like I'm seeing family. Cannot recommend them enough"}
{"text":"I was not convince at first, but I realized quickly that the price couldn't be beaten for the quality offered, this is super practical as you can store it in the freezer and on the top of it they deliver too super fast. The dog loves it and do not have any digestion problems."}
{"text":"My dogs LOVE everything from Fidos. It's how I bribe them :) they won't ever turn down a liver treat. All the food is made fresh with good ingredients. It's a family run business and the store is beautiful and clean. It is affordable and worth every penny. If you love your pets then you must try Fidos."}
{"text":"Just so happened to be driving by and seen fido's kitchen! Originally thought it was a bakery for dogs. Come to find of its fresh made dog food. I bought a few packages of the beef food for my picky puppy thats 9 months old.. I've been mixing it with her current food and she just loves it! As soon as I feed her now she come running to eat it. Before she wouldn't care and just walk by and eat her food whenever she got hungry. Now she's loving it!"}
{"text":"Fido's Kitchen is Awesome!  We just rescued a French Mastiff with skin issues and the foster mom fed her only raw food. We have never done raw before and were clueless.  We found Fido's Kitchen online and they have made our lives sooo much easier.  We have had our new pup Kleo for a week now and she is loving the food and treats so much.  Thank you for talking the time to explain everything to us.  The best part is they deliver.  The store is spotless super clean and you can tell the people who run this are really great humans who love dogs and are passionate about their company."}
{"text":"AWESOME PLACE!! Loved this place! So friendly and family owned! My dogs love and enjoy the treats from here. Definitely, HIGHLY recommend this place!! Once you go in there you feel the friendly customer service, you'll see yourself coming back to this place more than once FOR SURE!!"}
{"text":"We found Fidos Kitchen about a year ago at the Downtown Summerlins Farmers Market. Our puppy Yankeebeaster was almost a year old. He was a very picky eater at first, and just picked at it. 
We started feeding him store bought food & treats, until he began getting sick and throwing up. 
We started looking up pet food recalls and treat recalls. We found out that most of the food and treats that we had been feeding our Morkie had all been recalled that month, or in the past. We were so upset!! 
We started scrolling on Netflix, and came across a video called PET FOOLED. It's all about the big Pet food companies, and the secrets they don't want us pet owners to know. We couldn't believe our eyes, and decided we would never buy commercial pet food again!! (You have to watch this film if you love your pet!) 
(You'll also find out watching this video that most sicknesses and diseases in our pets, come from all of the  COMMERCIAL pet food and treats. Another thing commercial pet food companies don't want us consumers to know...) 
We went back to Fidos Kitchen to try it again, knowing he was getting sick because of the quality of the store bought pet food. We picked out a bunch to try, as well as some homemade chicken jerky. They also have seasonal ones, that change for the seasons. He absolutely LOVES it now!! 
We are so excited to have Fidos Kitchen to go to now. The owner is just great, and very knowledgeable about everything she makes and sells. As well as her staff, that always helps us when she's not there. We can't say enough about what this homemade food means to us. Our dog just loves all of them now, and is so much happier and healthier! The prices are very reasonable, and having peace of mind that our pets are eating quality meals is the best feeling ever.
 Thank you Fidos Kitchen for making such amazingly healthy food for our dog! We truly appreciate your local small business, that we know we can love and trust!! 

Krissy & Tina

Note: They're also thinking about possibly making a homemade cat food. We're crossing our fingers, because we also have a cat names Boots that we love. He's currently on Tiki Cat brand. A quality brand, but it's not homemade."}
{"text":"Love this place! I have been buying from them since they were selling at the Downtown Summerlin Farmers Market. My pup loves their salmon treats!"}
{"text":"Our new favorite store for our pups! We were greater with a big smile an amazing service! Wholesome healthy food and treats! We purchased 2 bullysticks, Salmon Chew Treats and ofcourse Pup Ice cream for our birthday girl!"}
{"text":"Owner is great! I'm so excited this place just opened near me. My dogs absolutely love the food!!! I found the prices to be reasonable too....Go check them out!"}
{"text":"My self and my FurBaby love this place! He gobbles up all his food in minutes and looks forward to mealtimes. Before it was pulling teeth to get him to eat but thankfully I found this at my neighborhood farmers market!!! Prices are great and quality is amazing... def a must try!"}
{"text":"I was referred to Fidos Kitchen because I wanted to feed my puppies healthy food not from a can or with all the additives and they are also picky eaters ( 2 yorkies). I'm so glad I found Fidos Kitchen the owners are wonderful and are passionate about what they do to offer healthier alternatives for pet food.. They also go to Farmer's  Markets throughout  the city so I'd call them and see where/days if their store location is far from you,  it's worth it :)"}
{"text":"This place is the most authentic and trustworthy. The owner is genuine and cares about animals. I ordered a cake for my dog and she explained all the ingredients. I'm glad I found this place. Thank you for making a difference and caring!"}
{"text":"Can we add another star here!! I have much love for small businesses. I'm so glad that I found this place. I've cooked food for my Fur Baby \"Turbo\" for a few years now. Just didn't know how to get creative. Now I leave it up to Fido's Kitchen. I cannot wait to spread the word. Turbo loved the Salmon treats. If you're thinking of trying this place out, put your phone down and go there now!!!!!!!!!! You won't regret it. Pricing is very reasonable..."}
{"text":"bought some treats at the farmers market @ The District and my dogs really liked them. Will have to go back and get more"}
{"text":"My husband and I were driving down the street and I saw the sign for this store and instantly began screaming \"homemade dog food. STOP!!\" I was literally a kid in a candy store here because they have so many amazing things!  I was peeping around the shop and everything is freshly made!  They were using actual chicken to make the chicken jerky!! I know that sounds stupid but I always worry what is actually in store bought treats!  So she has liver jerky that I will be giving to my sweet pup. She has salmon, duck and chicken jerky - oh my!  Also! Breath busters!!  Love it here and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great place for specialty and healthy dog food. My Labs are older so finding food that helps their dietary needs as well as food good for their bones and joints is a blessing. The staff is immensely helpful and nice, they advised me on what products would work best for my dogs' needs."}
{"text":"We were waiting for a friend to meet us up for lunch next door so, we killed some time by checking this place out. They just recently opened so, they only had a few items in their fridge/freezer. It's a good sign that they don't mass-produce their product. Their dog food are freshly made in house. They were in the process of making some when we came in.

The ingredients they use are all natural. Salmon, rice, sweet potatoes, etc. I remember when I was little and that's what we would feed our fur babies and none of the pre-packed pellets and wet chunks of unidentifiable gunk in a can.

Ralf enjoyed the salmon jerky and the punkin balls. They have meal plans for your pups. The guys here are very helpful. They have some cute puppy paintings hanging on the walls. Check this place out and get some treats for your pooch!"}
