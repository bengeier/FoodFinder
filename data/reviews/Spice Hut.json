{"text":"The lunch special is always a winner. I frequent this place monthly. It's small so come early. The service is unique and appropriate. Don't expect a whole lot but smiles and the basics and you'll be pleasantly surprised with your experience. Recommend for lunch and a unique experience with great food."}
{"text":"Spice Hut is a real gem. We tried it on a whim and found we were surprised at how much we enjoyed the food. There is a good selection of appetizers and main dishes such as curries and korma. I really feel that we're getting a taste of someone's wonderful home cooking whenever we go there. Spice Hut is not big on atmosphere, but the owners put their hard work into their food instead."}
{"text":"Great north Indian/Pakistani food. Try the chicken tikka, cooked right out front on the cast iron tandoor, and the lamb rogan josh.

I'm finding lately that a lot of the menu is too spicy for me - I'm going to ask them to tone it down next time."}
{"text":"I absolutely love the naan here. But aside from that, this place isn't really anything special. The back kitchen area looks messy and makes me slightly uncomfortable with ordering from there. Also I wish they had more paneer dishes."}
{"text":"This place is really really great. I always come here to get my Indian/Pakistani food. I don't waste my time going elsewhere. We order the chicken vindaloo, beef madras, goat karahi and butter chicken. Absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"Great value on the lunch special!  2 pakoras and a samosa are a nice little feature.  It makes for less butter chicken on your plate, but I'm okay with that.  The naan is chewy deliciousness!"}
{"text":"It could be just me but I think this is the worst place to get your desi food. When you get worst possible customer service from the owner himself (Mr. Manzar if I am not mistaken), then does not really matter what kind of food this place would serve. We went to his place on the way to our hotel after a long day trip to Banff on June 13, and the way he treated us it was utterly preposterous. Felt like we were there for free food. May God have mercy on his soul!"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE the food here!!  Always get their mixed grill platter - the lamb is unreal - of course the chicken and beef is great too.  never had any issues with customer service or pricing - the food has always tasted fantastic. 
The only reason for the 4 star is because of the place. seems run down and not a very inviting atmosphere to sit and eat. the washroom is in the back corner next to a mop bucket... kinda gross. I'm sure their kitchen is fine as they are handling food and never got sick or anything but just the overall restaurant isn't as clean and 'inviting' as maybe a restaurant should be - definitely no fine dining lol. but as I said : the food: AMAZING!"}
{"text":"Excellent Indian (well, technically Pakistani) restaurant. Everything was very fresh and well prepared. The spice level was just right. The place was packed with people from India, thus, you can rest assure that the food is authentic. Just typing this is making me hungry. Think I will go back for more...

Get the grill combo!

Update: am impressed with their vegitarian dishes. had the green peas and paneer curry, two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"One word.  Yum. 

The ambiance is part of the experience.

this app wants this review to be longer"}
{"text":"This food is amazing! Every time I order it's just so good! Even my husband who is not very adventurous with food likes eating from spice hut. It's kind if a \" hole in the wall\" place. I'm so happy I found this place. I have to say, I prefer it over Namskar."}
{"text":"I was starving when I stumbled upon Spice Hut.  The place was packed.  The two men working greeted me with big smiles on their faces.  One told me about their lunch special, which was $7.95 and included a samosa, pakoras, naan, butter chicken, veggie curry and rice.  I decided on that for take out.  I waited about 10 minutes, I got to watch the other guy make naan in the oven, which was interesting.  The menu is pretty extensive all entrees going for between $7.99 and $9.99, which is really reasonable.  I saw the portions of things as the were brought out to the tables, the entrees were pretty standard in size, the rice was huge!  After getting my food and a drink, it cost me not quite $10.  

I ate my pakoras on the way home, they were really good, some of the best I have had!  The samosa was a bit greasy and didn't have much flavour.  Once home the meal was mixed together pretty good.  The rice was saffron.  The veggie curry was mainly tomatoes, with some carrots and peas and one lonely potato, it wasn't the best.  The butter chicken was tasty, the chicken quality wasn't the greatest.  The naan was perfect!

I found my food hit and miss.  The service at Spice Hut was excellent.  I would give this place another try, I probably wouldn't get the lunch special again though."}
{"text":"Love this place. Great food and good price. I love these 'hole in the wall' desi restaurants with no-frills but really good food, and this place is just like that."}
{"text":"YUP...this is a gooder for sure. All the food is quite tasty. The only problem with the place is the actual owner. Kinda has a cocky attitude doesnt really make you feel welcome. For me I like to support the local guys as much as I can but service is huge. Maybe it was an off day for him but hoping that he reads this and knows that he has a good product but service is garbage. None the less because there aren't any other authentic Pakistani restaurants in close proximity to the NW...we will continue to go back and support him/ them."}
{"text":"Great flavors and everything is decently priced. A forewarning that the butter chicken here is spicy for those who are expecting a mild creamy sauce. I like their matter paneer and chicken tikka masala as well. Their beef kabob is very flavorful and full of spices. The  naan has a nice chew and is on the thick side. They have a few tables for diners to dine in but I prefer take out."}
{"text":"I discovered this place when it opened around 2008. There's a single dish that I love and am not interested in anything else: beef and chicken tikka skewers. 

I now live in Edmonton and when I go to Calgary I try to make a special stop. Today I did that and was so thankful to receive such a delicious meal. 

PS: Their roti and naan is excellent as well."}
{"text":"Got a butter chicken (for the kids) and a beef madras for me, along with some naan. The kids liked theirs but it was a bit spicy for them. My beef madras was great. The naan were BIG, soft and doughy made as we stood there. Reminded me of the naan I ate in Pakistan. Fast service, fast to the table. Affordable. A gem of a hole in the wall. 

My favourite kind of surprise."}
{"text":"Best Indian/Pakistani food I've had in Calgary. We ordered chicken tikka masala, beef madras and kebab platter. The portions are a little small for the price but these dishes were able to feed three of us adequately. Taste was great, naan were good size and fluffy. The store is a little small and cramped but the food was great. Would definitely recommend and will definitely return"}
{"text":"I've gone here twice. First time I got briyani and chicken tikka and it was great. Second time I got the veg pakora and briyani. Pakoras were good tasting but very soggy and the briyani lacked flavour. Hopefully my third visit will be a tie breaker in a positive way :)"}
{"text":"This is a dinky little place that will surprise you with great Indian food. Their butter chicken is awesome! Spinach paneer is awesome! The only thing is the spice is never precise, i can go one day and it might be medium heat the next week i order the same dish and its high heat. so, you need to tell them mild, medium or hot. Other then that they are great. They do however make their naan on top of a deep freeze, i don't know how sanitary is that? Oh well, food still good!"}
{"text":"One of the best options for south Asian cuisine in Calgary.. Recently became vegan and they were able to modify dishes for me. Amazing!"}
{"text":"Eat in is decent. Naan is above average. Butter chicken is decently flavourful. 
Take away is consistently a very small dismally pathetic portion and such a bad rip off. I ordered a second time and opened the food up in front of them, showing them the teeny tiny small portion and 4 small pieces of chicken in the butter chicken. They argued that's normal. I showed them a photo of the portions when I had eaten in their restaurant and then they still argued. 
There is MUCH better authentic East Indian eats 
in the Marlboro mall area."}
{"text":"Recently came here and was pleasantly surprised we live close by and will definitely come back. The prices were fairly cheap and it was quite tasty. Good butter chicken that was spiced great samosas and naan! Worth a try for sure"}
{"text":"I walked in and was sold on the smell alone.  The portions are a nice size and priced accordingly. It was a busy lunch and my food arrived after an acceptable wait. The food is delicious, but not fancy. A good value, I will return."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by Spice Hut. It's tucked away in Huntington Hills.  I had been driving around for a while, hungry and undecided as to what I was craving when I saw the name.  
The place is sparsely decorated but clean.  Utilitarian tables and chairs that you would find in small take-out places fill the seating area.  Menu is broken down to the usual sections with a middle section of their specialties.  I opt to try the Nehari, beef shanks slowly cooked in special spices for hours.  The proof is in the eating with tender morsels of melt-in-your-mouth beef, the flavour is very subtle.  The heat is there though.  I was warned that both my dishes were very spicy. The Nehari is not as spicy as the Vindaloo.
The chicken Vindaloo packed the real Vindaloo heat but it was a little (just a smidgen) too tomatoey for me.  The chicken pieces were nice and tender. All in all good Indian food.  The prices are extremely reasonable with the Nehari at $9.99, and @8.99 for the Chicken  Vindaloo. I ordered 2 naan @ $1.50/ea. The naan was a little dry but it looked really good coming out of the tandoori. I'll try rice or Roti next time. Parking is plentiful."}
{"text":"Great food for very reasonable prices. Slightly awkward setting for a first timer but owner was very welcoming after initial confusion. Standard Indian food but great naan and roti. Awesome for quick takeout or a fast dinner."}
{"text":"Had the lunch special which was a lot of food.  All of it was very delicious!  Lots of variety and two sauces came with it.  Definitely check it out if you love Indian food."}
{"text":"The food is really expensive here. They serve a small portion with a high price compared to other restaurants in the same class. The place is not clean at all. It was disgusting. It reminds me low level restaurants. It is small and not enough seats to go there as a family."}
{"text":"The food is incredible. They are open every single day. I honestly don't know how they work that hard. I'm a regular here now and I've never been disappointed with the food."}
{"text":"One of my go to places for North Indian / Pakistani.   The Lunch special is always of good quality and value.  The Naan's are fresh and excellent.
A nice dish by itself is the Butter Prawns."}
{"text":"I moved away from Calgary and I still crave this place like crazy and make sure to go every time I visit.
The food is just as good as the pricier Desi restaurants, but way better value. There is also a certain \"home cooked\" quality to the food that is amazing, and hard to find.
We LOVE the pakoras, fish curry, daal, pretty much anything with paneer in it, and the baingan bhartha. 
The owners are always there and are real sweethearts too.
Miss you Spice Hut. Please never close."}
{"text":"Can't rave enough about this hole in the wall joint. The place has a fresh and authentic menu and cooked to order. The bread is made fresh, hearty portion sizes, and great lunch specials. It tastes just like food we had in Iraq and we will def be back!"}
{"text":"Pakistani food, reasonable price and the owner is always there so you know you will get consistent food.

Been going there for years and the only time I'm disappointed is when they run out of something."}
{"text":"Like so many places, I've been meaning to stop in here for like forever. Then a friend said to me....it's so good you have to try it. As always I'm up for that kind of challenge.

So the day came and I ordered some takeout because that's want I wanted for lunch one busy day. The minute I walked in to pick it up, the place smelled so good. My order consisted of rice, butter chicken, pakoras and naan. Can I just say there was enough food to feed a family of four. Outstanding.

Everything was very flavourful, tasty with so much food leftover. The Naan was warm, chewy and just amazing.

The guys working there were very friendly as well and I like friendly. Definitely coming back to this little gem. Love to support local."}
{"text":"3.5* (minus 1/2 star only cuz I get thirsty afterwards....)

Lunch special $7.95. (about a 10 min preparation time)
includes:  pakora, butter chicken, fresh made naan, safron rice, and some veggie thingy.

Very tasty!
and their kabobs look delicious as well. :)"}
{"text":"I use to go out for lunch all the time but lately I haven't gone out for lunch because I'm trying to be more 'healthy' and I bring my own lunches to work.  I work in the NE so lunch options are normally limited to fast food joints as one hour lunch just doesn't seem long enough.  Even though I don't eat out that often, I still search Yelp! because I enjoy reading review and trying new places.

Indian food.  That is what I have been craving for a long time.  I could be flakey when people ask me to go out for lunch because I'd rather go to the gym but this time I chose a restaurant and set a date so I know I wouldn't flake out.  
Spice hut is located in a strip mall area, semi hidden, right across from the KFC in the Hunterhorn shopping area NE.  It was around 11:45am on a Wednesday afternoon when we arrived.  Before entering, I pause and said \"wow this place does look pretty ghetto...it must be amazing then!\" because most hole in the walls are...at least for me!  Surprisingly, it wasn't busy at all!  There were only two other people dining at this hour.  Spice hut is a pretty small restaurant with only 7 tables - 2x4 tops, 2x6 tops and 3x2 tops and a visible kitchen area.  From reading the review, we immediately knew what we wanted but still glanced at the menu.  The menu doesn't have the lunch special in it but there is a poster on the window outside as well as a small poster inside that promotes the $7.95 lunch special.  The lunch special includes: butter chicken, curried veggies, miz vegi pakoras, vegetable samosa, rice and a piece of naan bread.  It also came with two sauces: a medium hot sauce and a sweet yogurt sauce.  For drinks, we ordered waters to which we received a jug of water and plastic cups (a little ghetto ;)).  I had to order a mango lassi which is a traditional indian beverage which is normally made from yogurt, water and mango pulp.  It's a perfect pairing for spicy indian food - it helps cool your tongue and it's pretty tasty.

Our food came out pretty fast and I got super giddy as per usual.  Of course I had to snap 100 pics before I dug in.  I went for a mixture of the butter chicken sauce and rice ...bliiiiissss! It was exactly what I wanted.  It was tasty, the butter chicken wasn't anything AMAZING but it was good.  The butter chicken was a mild spice which was nice for me (I don't like toooo spicy).  While I was eating, I could see them preparing some naan so I asked the guys if they wanted to share an order of garlic naan..but before they could answer, I had already gone up to the front and ordered it :) hehe.  It didn't take long for them to prepare garlic naan which came in four pieces. The pakora is a deep fried vegetable snack, there are two pieces and they have a nice chewy crunch and a slight onion flavor, yummy.  The vegetarian samosa was crunchy with a mash potato texture inside.  Overall everything was really tasty, Steven and Parker literally wiped their plates clean.  You definitely get a bang for your buck with this lunch special.

Okay, so now you know my secret.....$7.95 for *see photo* all of that delicious food?  It's FANTASTIC! You definitely get your money's worth here.  Go...now!!"}
{"text":"Great indian food!  I recommend this place for great indian eats on a budget!  You can eat in however it is a very small seating area and the ambiance is totally lacking.  The food and flavor and spice totally makes up for it.  I recommend this place to order some take out and enjoy at home if your looking for any ambiance.   The naan bread is the best Ive had..cook freash to order and huge portion!  The staff are very friendly and the food come out very quickly.  I recomment the chicken tikka masala if your looking for some good hot spice and the butter shrimp for a twist on butter chicken for a nice creamy tomoato sauce.  I would definatly go back, but I'd take out and enjoy at home next time."}
{"text":"I finally stopped in last week because I've driven past Spice Hut for over 3yrs and never tried it out.  The lunch special is advertised in-house only, which is what I ordered.  As previously mentioned, it's Butter Chicken, rice, Pakora, curried mixed veggies, a veggie Samosa and Nan for less than $9 taxes in.  I ordered it to go and barely made it home without eating it in the car.  Oh, the tantalizing smells!  Everything was flavorful and I have no complaints with the exception of the Samosa.  It seemed slightly underdone and doughy.  The meal was plenty enough for lunch and I only ate 3/4 of it because I was full.  They actually serve fish and chips here as well.  

Spice Hut is a small place that seats less than 30 but was about 1/4 full in the early afternoon.  Service was very friendly.  I don't know that I'd call it a \"hole in the wall\" because I relate that to very dumpy places, which this is not.  It's just plainly decorated with simple furnishings.  

I would order from here again and hope the samosas are better the next time.

Review 8 for Yelp's 30 Day Challenge - Nov 2012"}
{"text":"We ordered the butter chicken and garlic naan.
It was good. Not too spicy.  The naan were big n soft.

We wanted to order samosas but it would have taken 10 minutes to make. I suppose that's a good thing though, they would be fresh. We declined at this time due to time constraints.

I would recommend this place"}
{"text":"Ordered take our from here - chicken Korma and garlic naan. The Korma was a bit spicier than I expected but the chicken was tender and the portion size generous for the peice. The naan was by far my favourite - perfect and hot with work crisp bubbles. Would definitely order again!"}
