{"text":"Been a regular but customer service has changed. Long wait time for mac and cheese and when I went to pick it up and the gentleman says \" thanks\" in a tone as if I was disturbing him and I just simply looked in the box because I almost couldn't see if anything was even in there and as I'm looking he goes \" thanks\" again. Used to love this place but I just can't anymore."}
{"text":"It was good but not great I was expecting a lil more I guess.. Different than your average hot dog but yet and still it's a average hot dog, If that makes any sense.."}
{"text":"I've been to this location twice in the last month. Both times out of regular and beef dogs. Staffer today says she had no idea why as she rarely works here. She seems more interested in checking her phone than working. And if dead fish/zero energy were a description it would fit her personality. Losing interest in this place FAST."}
{"text":"If, when, how, the, what the! 

Who the heck. (Dramatic pause) 

Came up with this flavor driven tastebud amusement park for My belly!!!! 

Any way you try it. Any thing you place on it.  Your not going to regret it. Well if you eat too many in one sitting you might .,, uh yea just trust me on that. 

Great service. Friendly staff. Always smiling and working hard. They love to help you with fun pairings and recommendations! 

They have all kinds of dogs. 

(In slow mo) 
they have Chicken dogs, Beef dogs, Pork dogs, Veggie dogs, Shriners dogs, boiled shrimp wait not that last one..    
They use Naan bread instead of buns (freakn amazing). Picasso had a brush they got NAAN!!! 

I've tried them all. Loved them all and lived to share my love with the world through means of verbal and social communication. 

How dare you not go here... You should be ashamed... Bad doggie! 

And I'm out!!!"}
{"text":"We spent $25 for a couple of bites of food. Should have known better; they don't actually have a kitchen so they can't do much there. We got chili dogs. The bread is different. Hot dog I had to cut with a knife. Costco hot dog so much better and cheaper"}
{"text":"Really disappointed, the hours are listed until 8pm on both Yelp and their website. We showed up at 645 and they were closed. Absolutely ridiculous.  Normally I love short leash, best dogs in town, but this was a big let down."}
{"text":"Very creative with they're dishes. I chose Big Mac daddy. 
With sausage. Loaded with all the toppings you want. 
It was A difficult decision. Everything looked so good. 
Hotdog stand reminded me of Poland. 
So very cool.  
Highly recommended. Everything is good."}
{"text":"Horrible experience over UberEATS!! I have given this locations so many tries, and I kept trying simply because this Biltmore location is the only of the two that are available for delivery to my address. Every time I try to order, this place either cancels my order or it simply times out as l have placed my order waiting on the status to change to restaurant in preparing your order. This last time I called in after getting my order canceled for the 4th and LAST Time to have Madison from the Biltmore location tell me it was cancelled due to them running out of Arugula for the side salad order. Like they could call and ask if we could take some alternative like other greens or something to accommodate?? Instead she told me to just select over UberEATS the Downtown location, but guess what, I totally would, but Uber does not show that location to me as an option."}
{"text":"The food is great, when they're open... I have gone to the Biltmore Fashion Park location four times now, well before their closing time, and they have been closed. The listed hours are until 8pm and I have gone between 5 and 6pm and they were already closed.This is really unacceptable. I wish they would stay true to their listed hours because the hotdogs are delicious."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a quick, delicious and affordable bite, check this place out. They have beef, chicken, and vegetarian hotdogs which I appreciate. I had the organic chicken hotdog, \"aiko\" style meaning the hotdog is dressed with mango chutney and spicy mayo. They use naan bread instead of a hotdog bun which surprisingly made a tasty vehicle for all the flavors. The staff were also very friendly and welcoming. 

Will come back to try the other varieties."}
{"text":"I like this place. Its small and little table space but the Dogs are great!

A little pricey but I like it.  Can not go often because of the price.  

The Donuts are great also!! try one!

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Nothing special and pricey for what you get.

Ordered my daughter corn dogs.  Menu says two, but they hadn't bothered to change the sign...and the manager didn't bother to apologize.

Seriously, all it takes is a piece of white paper scissors and tape to change the menu board.

Their corn dog is half the size of \"everyday corn dog\" and twice the price.... considering its half the size it works out to 4 times the price.

Do not understand what the fuss is about.  Have had people recommend the central Phoenix location."}
{"text":"Best hot dog I can ever remember having.  Had the devil dog and loved it!
The flavors went so well together.  Some sweetness from the onions and sriracha.  A little heat from the jalapenos and beer hot.  And some really good bread.  

It was a really good hot dog, but for 8 bucks it would be nice to get some chips with the dog.  SLD is so close to a 5 star review.  

I would come back again and recommend to others.

So right next to Forge there is a small doorway that looks like you are going into Forge but your not.  Follow it to the end.  If you are coming from the southside the door looks like it is only for a juice bar but its not.  Go in and get a hot dog.  This place needs to do a better job and marking the doorways or something."}
{"text":"Tried the beef dog since that's what everyone recommends for first time. It was pretty good but NOT worth $8.67, period. I honestly don't know where that price comes from and how it's justified."}
{"text":"I went in last night about 845 , wasn't greeted . This girl was sweeping and she said they were closed . It was 846 at this point . The door and google times stated they closed at 9 . What's going on here !? Unhappy employees ? Means unhappy service !"}
{"text":"I swooped by SL (Short Leash) after a quick visit to the Apple Store here at the Biltmore.  I personally was not all too familiar with SL's early loyal following in the food truck scene here in Phoenix.  

All of their wieners are wrapped in naan \"buns\" and I was highly recommended the Bear or the Aiko. I went with the Aiko with a steamed all beef dog.  A little sweet and a little heat with the combo of mango chutney/jalape√±o and slight bit of mayo.  Almost tasted like tangy kewpie mayo.  I'm surprised there isn't a weiner with something curryish like a curry sauce or curry ketchup on the menu.  Duh!! c'mon naan + curry go together like PB & J.  Lets make it happen SL!  

The mac & cheese on the other hand was average from the half that I shared.  I personally wouldn't get this side again.  But would I come back again and again and again for a creative dog?!  Hell yea I would!!!  I still need to prepare myself mentally for what's in store with these rollover donuts at their other location on Roosevelt.  

4 stars overall.  I'm a big of any business that focuses on product quality and creative menu items.  I'm on board..I totally get it!  Nuttin but the SL dog in me...Bow wow wow yippie yo yippie yay!"}
{"text":"Done with short leash.

This place was great and has simply fell off. About a  year and a half ago their service and quality of drink/food changed. Especially their bloody Mary's ( think those are back too 100 though) 

Nevertheless, one of the worst hires you made was the larger girl who also worked at Third Space on grand...(bad their too lol) Anyways, she started the crap service for us. Took a long break and came back to more of the same. 

Really disappointing because I would rave about the place."}
{"text":"We loved this local favorite! Really fun atmosphere - we played foosball and uno while we waited. The freshly made brioche doughnuts are just incredible. A must try if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"These dogs are great. Now $6.50 is indeed way too much to pay for a regular dog, even for the best, one from Flo's on Route One in Cape Neddick, Maine. 
But, you really can't call the Short Leash hot dogs \"regular.\"
From the \"dog\" itself to the bread (a Nan-style, good sized pita bread) to the delicious and unusual toppings, this is a special meal as many Yelpers have reported.
The help has experience with people wandering into this place, just one of many stalls and shops in this Union mini-mall area. Many people are attracted to the wall of cool photos of dogs! The gals behind the counter were quick to nicely explain the menu--and just as quick I was chowing down on an Oliver, with sauerkraut, Swiss cheese and 1000 island dressing.
I liked it. 
But, oh how I wish it was July and I was back at Flo's--even if Gail was cranky because someone was holding the screen door open."}
{"text":"I think that, maybe, if I hadn't head so much about Short Leash before going, I would've been less disappointed.

First of all, the hot dogs are served on naan, not buns.  The naan isn't great naan, and it's a naan-standard hot dog bun for a reason - sometimes traditions are good.

I tried the Bear - PBJ, bacon, cheese, bbq sauce, and Crackerjacks - I love the PBJ burgers at Rehab and Slater's, so I had high hopes for this dog...sadly, most of the flavor was BBQ sauce, and a little bacon.  Couldn't really taste the PBJ.  I asked about the Crackerjacks when ordering, and was assured I wouldn't even taste them...that was accurate...so, what's the point of having them on the dog?

The naan also left some sort of coating on my fingers that I couldn't get off with the napkin.  Since their a 'truck' in the plaza, there's no bathroom handy, so that was annoying.  

Somebody in our group ordered the fried pickles...they were...odd.

They do have a GREAT selection of soft drinks - I tried a cream soda I hadn't had before that was pretty good.

Give it a try if you're in the area and see if it floats your goat.  As for me, not my scene..."}
{"text":"\"For Naan Believers Only\" Short Leash Dogs has made me a naan believer!!

You pick your 'wiener' (all their hotdogs are natural/ gluten & nitrate free):  regular, all beef, bratwurst, chicken, spicy beer hot & vegetarian. 

Willie was very friendly & informative then gave great suggestions for my choice of Spicy Beer Hot 'wiener'.  He made me feel at ease to be adventurous!  

So I decided on the award winning 'BEAR' (peanut butter, smoked Gouda, bacon, BBQ sauce + cracker jacks) w/ Spicy Beer Hot 'wiener' on naan bread of course.  

Oh my!  It was delish!  And soooo filling!  Nice blend of ingredients where I tasted each flavor but it melded well without competing. Thank you Richard for making it tasty & perfectly cooked.  Great staff!!!

Also, tried the watermelon lemonade by Hubert's-nice. They have a nice assortment of different varieties of drinks to choose from. 

There are a couple of tables; but if full, than I chose to sit at the fountain in the courtyard near Santa in his regal white coat & enjoyed our beautiful weather.

PS: in middle courtyard near Saks & Williams Sonoma."}
{"text":"Decided to check-out this location while staying at the Arizona Biltmore.  I ordered an Oliver with sauerkraut, cheese and thousand island dressing with an all beef dog on naan...so ridiculously tasty!  I also ordered a side of coleslaw, but it was nothing special...stick to the amazing hot dogs when visiting this cute little location in the Biltmore shops!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place! Staff is always super friendly, and my chosen meal is always cooked perfectly. Very eclectic and diverse menu with options to build your own unique creation as well. Saddle on up to the counter for some yummy grub and good conversation with the staff. Try their spicy brat with chipotle cream cheese and diced bacon. Their potato salad is top notch, too. Not too happy that they don't have Rollover Donuts offered for dessert any more, though...bring them back!"}
{"text":"I just paid $18 for two hot dogs. I get the same thing at every golf course in town for $8. Everything was a la cart so I imagine that if we got a drink and chips it would be $40. 

Never again."}
{"text":"I was super hungry and decided to come here because I love the one downtown. The service was prompt and my hotdog was what I expected, if a little worse than the original. I was so disappointed when I got the chips and they weren't made on site.

I was there alone, sitting at the bar and after I placed my order the two employees played on their phones the entire time! At least attempt some conversation. This one also did not have alcohol."}
{"text":"After spending about 10 minutes trying to find the place, we successfully found it inside of a little walkway next to Forge. I had the organic chicken Moki with no tomatoes, it was delicious!  They also use naan bread instead of hotdog buns, which makes it a little interesting to eat, but the softness of the naan goes really well with the dog. They also have veggie dogs too! 

The service was excellent and food was delivered with speed and garnish with a sweet pickle on top. The classic Mexican coke makes an great refreshing addition to a hot Arizona day."}
{"text":"Great food, tons of options, cute location. We have a place like this where I'm from in ny called dog town and this place it just as good!

The staff was super friendly and its was a nice sunny day to enjoy a warm treat! If they don't ask to validate your parking just go next door to the crepe place and tell them you went there and they will validate it for you :)"}
{"text":"Same tasty food, adorable atmosphere, but I think the server was a little overwhelmed.

We ordered drinks, a salad and two veggie dogs.  The girl who took or order was really nice, but she seemed to be the only one there on Saturday night, aside from the cook.  She forgot the drinks until we got our hot dogs (and we reminded her), and the salad came well after the dogs.  It took a little while to get waters, as well.  

Same tasty food as the brick n mortar and the food trucks.  The cafe itself is really cute, but the nice girl at the counter could definitely use some help!"}
{"text":"The decor of this place is what originally reeled me in because I love dogs :)
Food was very good ! I ordered a vegetarian Oliver and my boyfriend ordered the bratwurst stuffed pretzel with potato salad. Everything was delicious! The pickle on the side was so good and they make them in house.
The worker was wonderful too ! Very helpful with the menu items and very personable. He talked to us our entire time dining at Short Leash."}
{"text":"I start this by saying yeah yeah yeah I know I just overpaid for this hot dog ($9), but (and it's a big BUT;) I had to give this place a try and I'm very glad I did!

No other place has all these different and imaginative offerings for hotdogs all in one place. Today I had the Cubano which comes with a smattering of pulled pork, cheese, mustard and spicy sweet pickles. I subbed the spicy dog for its less spicy but just as snappy cousin, the all beef dog.

If I was less hungry I would have taken 1/2 of it home with me."}
{"text":"So maybe i'll catch a lot of flack because of my low star review for such a popular eatery, but I was not at all impressed with the food hype surrounding this place.

at first i was super excited to see the veggie dog option and the multitude of toppings you can get on your hot dog. it sounded like a savory heaven! and i do mean everything! any kind of vegetable and/or cheese and/or traditional topping and even some not so traditional toppings. they serve salads and alcohol as well. 

service was super friendly and quick, so no complaints there. 

but it was just a veggie hot dog. like the kind i can buy in a pack at sprouts. the flavor came from the toppings so essentially i was eating a salad on top of a veggie dog. and although i'm not a hot dog fan, i especially don't care for hot dog buns. short leash replaced the bun with a giant pita bread. it's so much bread! you get full from the huge pita, not the filling itself. 

i was mostly disappointed because we tried some of their offerings at the Yelp Downtown event and were very impressed with what they had (fried green tomato!). maybe they have that at their brick and mortar store or the food truck but not at the pop up location. and 6.50 for a veggie dog just seems a bit too much."}
{"text":"Short Leash - what's not to love? I've always been happy with the combos here, and we love the use of the flatbread instead of a bun. I do kind of feel like it is a little hit or miss... or perhaps the quality has changed a little? Not sure, but it's a good tasty little bite if you are in the area and can't make it downtown to their other location!"}
{"text":"Sooooo good. We have been going to them for years. The owner is usually there and the staff is always friendly and helpful. It is not traditional hot dogs you get a naan bread instead but even the pickiest of eaters enjoy it. The loaded fries are my favorite. I highly recommend them quality , friendly, and delicious."}
{"text":"The food is decent and I love the atmosphere of the restaurant. Wish the employees were a little friendlier when asking for suggestions on what to order (the answer \"I don't know, whatever you like I guess.\"). Doughnuts are delicious and their cheese curds are great too!"}
{"text":"Brad & Kat are at it again!  And they're back in my hood!  They have a new location at the Union at Biltmore right next to Stingray.  Check it out, they dogs are the best in Arizona!"}
{"text":"I have heard about Short Leash Hot Dogs for a while and finally got to stop in while shopping at the Biltmore. This is their walk up location located inside the courtyard of Biltmore Fashion Park. They have another location on Roosevelt Street downtown Phoenix. 

Impressive menu with many options. I am pretty traditional so I opted for the Chicago dog, but already picked out what I was going to order next time. I was so excited!  

I guess I should have done my homework because I was a little disappointed. The hotdog was served on a pita bread. I know I know, I should have looked at more of the Yelpers photos ahead of time, but I took a shot in the dark. 

The pita bread just didn't work for the Chicago dog. It made it difficult to eat and was super messy! The flavors were good, just like a Chicago dog, just too messy. 

Honestly, I'll give Short Lease another try sometime. I just wanted to share my experience tonight."}
{"text":"This was my first time at short leash, We were very excited to try them! Who doesn't love a good hot dog anyway?!?!? We placed our order and unfortunately they were out of pretzel dogs so we ordered something else off the menu. I ordered the moki dog, a side Mac n cheese and fried pickles. Our order came in a timely manner and everything looked very good! The \"moki\" was very tasty, everything on it was very fresh. I was quite pleased. Until... We discovered a large hair embedded into our fried pickles  I went up to the counter with the fried pickles and notified them about the hair that was in my food, the young lady at the counter was very apologetic, however the cook tried to tell me it was my hair in the food because no one that worked there had that color hair.. ummm no!!  I didn't come into your kitchen and bread and fry my pickles and leave a hair behind.. they offered nothing but an apology and didn't even offer to give me a new order of pickles. So, I have to say I didn't have the best experience at Short Leash Hot Dogs, and probably wouldn't return."}
{"text":"I was so excited to see Short Leash's little satellite stand. I kept missing their truck at events but always wanted to give their spin on the hot dog a try. I posted the menu so you can get a look at all the crazy options. Great quality meat and super service topped with whatever floats your boat. Price not too bad either. Love the fresh naan bread. Will be back to try another flavor soon!"}
{"text":"I love Short Leash and was glad to hear they opened up a permanent shop inside The Union. The only downside is no fried pickles! For whatever reason, this location does not have fried pickles. To make up for no fried pickles, they do have salads and donuts. Additionally, all the hotdogs you know and love are on the menu and you can build your own. I love building my own - hot beer brat, bacon, Gouda, caramelized onions, saut√©ed mushrooms, and spicy mustard. Yum! This is my go-to favorite and my husband loves it too.

Depending on where you enter The Union, the shop could be easy to miss because the signage is rather small. The inside of the shop is on the smaller side as well, but that doesn't stop the big flavors. Inside, there is seating along a bar top, where you can watch your hotdog being made or there is a single table outside the eatery. The walls are covered in photos of dogs and the special hotdog creation inspired by the dog. The place is cute and modern with a white countertop and concrete walls.

Overall, it's a great place to grab a delicious and unique hot dog. If I can't catch the food truck or make it downtown, this is a great spot to help curb my cravings!"}
{"text":"The best hands down fried pickles EVER! Hotdogs are AMAZING! And the doughnuts DELICIOUS. A must try place."}
{"text":"Our server was great and the food came out fast, but I just don't think I'm the kind of girl who likes a hot dog on naan bread. Hot dog was good, ingredients were fresh, but I don't think I'll come back due to my own preferences."}
{"text":"I haven't been too the food truck or downtown location.  I have been here twice and I do not know what the big deal is.....I will have to try the dwntn location.  Not impressed w this at all."}
{"text":"This is the Short Leash in the Union at the Biltmore. I love this location because it really is the perfect place to grab an early 11 o'clock lunch and a dirty chai latte from Royal next door. Plus once you are done you can pop over to MAC and see what's new. I always do :) 

I've run into Brad a few times here and he's his usual, friendly, chipper self. There is nothing better than service with a smile!"}
{"text":"Craved a good beef hot dog came here and the hot dog was blan the chilly tasted like its been in a pot to long and the fried pickles were sweet and i wasnt told that they would be. Cool concept that the bun is a tortilla i liked that and the people working were nice but i wouldnt come here if your craving a hotdog. Only think i enjoyed was the tejava tea that came in a bottle."}
{"text":"Really good hotdogs in a great location. Had a slaw dog and fried pickles. A really good meal. Go get some!!"}
{"text":"The sunny hotdog is a very delicious and unique sandwich that is like no other hotdog I've ever tried.

The naan bread with arugula and goat cheese coupled with prosciutto and a chicken dog is a very good combination."}
{"text":"I just don't feel 5 stars are enough.....here's why!

The staff took time to explain the amazing combinations and didn't hesitate to explore some recommendations.. BONUS

Today I tried the award winning BEAR combination with an all beef dog. I was drooling like a dog after the first bite

They have a whopping 10 signature dogs and 7 premium dogs. With sides and bottled soda pop to top off your dog. 

I can't express in enough words how faithful of a customer I will be at this location. I was sold after the first bite! The combinations may seem a bit strange to your hearing however I encourage you to put it aside and indulge. 

You will NOT be sorry! Awesome"}
{"text":"Was craving a \"Hot Dog\", as stated in the business name itself so decided to give them a try. Disappointed to find out they are not hot dogs, but some kind of pita bread wrap, dafuq?! Ordered the Moki, was completely smothered in beans and cheese, really messy; I couldn't eat it. I went to ask for a regular bun, they don't have any. I feel that it was partially my fault for not knowing that a hotdog place does not sell hot dogs. Next time I'm craving a pita wrap I'll just go to Pita Jungle."}
{"text":"Upon walking up to the dog stand I was greeted by super fun and friendly employees.  The hot dog was made quick and really special.  I sat outside in the courtyard and really enjoyed my experience.  It is a little expensive for a hot dog but my experience was a good one."}
{"text":"Short leash naked dogs are my favorite. So tasty. I also love the fried green tomato salad. I really appreciate how consistently delicious everything is. I hadn't been in months and it was as good as I remembered. I introduced my roommate who is a transplant from the UK and he agreed that it was amazing. I love sharing my favorite gems with new people. Thanks for always being awesome!"}
{"text":"Service is really good and in the colorful Roosevelt Row District. I gave 4 stars and not 5 because to be honest, this place didn't knock my socks off. I also really really like their menu, concept, and atmosphere. This is a great spot for your lunch break! I had the Mac daddy that has a hotdog, chili, and Mac n cheese along with the German potato salad that was surprisingly more stand outish than the hot dog!"}
{"text":"They stopped selling kids dogs to adults although there is no age listed on the menu. I work in the mall and they pick and choose who can buy a kids dog. My coworker was able to buy one but I wasn't. They need to make it consistent, and not pick and choose who they allow to purchase a kids dog. I just watched them loose out on $15 because three other adults wanted a simple hotdog. $8 for a hotdog with ketchup & mustard is ridiculous. I don't see an issue with selling a \"simple\" \"naked\" hotdog for $5 dollars. 

Fried pickles are bomb tho."}
{"text":"I am so sad to see that short leash will only be temporarily in this location! The service is great and the food is even better. I do not eat beef or pork but their chicken and veggie dog are the best I've had! I would recommended one of those with the sunny option, sans the prosciutto. I hope they will consider staying longer!!"}
{"text":"I'll start with saying I've been to the location on Roosevelt and the service and quality was great, even on a packed night (mind you this was 3 plus years ago).
Fast forward to now- 
Tried their Biltmore location 4/25/18 during the lunch hour, so say around noon. The service was horrible. The cashier/girl taking the order could not have acted any more rude and annoyed with her job. Maybe she was having a bad day, but it was effecting customers. 
We ordered the Sunny and the Millie, and the Mac n cheese hot dog dish for our kiddo. Would not have tipped had the lowest selection not been 15%. There was no \"no tip\" option. 
Overall lackluster flavor on the wieners. They were scalding hot, and honestly on the Sunny, it tasted better when I decided to forego the wiener and just eat the toppings and naan. 
Husband wasn't impressed with his Millie either. Same complaint on the wiener. 
The kiddo is 1 and half so his comments don't mean much since he eats one thing one day, and won't another.  
For the most part, it was the horrible service that bothered me the most. The cherry on it all was listening to an exchange between the same employee and another customer that called her out on the piss poor attitude. 
Not sure I'll try again given the prices and what you're getting for it. It would be nice if they had a better drink selection as well. 
Hope the employee has a better day or finds a job she likes better. #notworking"}
{"text":"Just moved to Melrose and was excited to try this new restaurant via √ºbereats. I love gourmet hot dogs and this place looked super yummy!
We ordered the Lady and the Bear. The Lady was my favorite! Fried pickles and chipotle cream cheese somehow made utter, delicious yummy sense! The Bear I was slightly disappointed in, but it may have been because I opted for the meat version. It was definitely good but adding chicken may have affected the combination of flavors; I emphasize, the combo surprisingly still worked! Who would have thought peanut butter, cracker jacks, gouda, and bbq sauce would have made a winning combination?! This is why I applaud Short Leash! They took an old time American favorite and dressed it up to the nines! Not only were they experimental with their toppings but the Naan bread worked perfectly and I loved getting to choose Brats instead of the traditional hot dogs. If you are a more conservative eater I recommend eating somewhere else; if you're like me and like to eat new things, eat here. 
Keep experimenting with flavors and I will keep eating whatever you come up with!"}
{"text":"Great hotdogs served creatively, this is a great place for a quick lunch, not too expensive, when hitting The Biltmore. Pleasant staff and the nearby shops make this a really good place they make their own donuts, which look delicious. While they don't offer coffee, there is a good cup available at the end of the passageway."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to have a quick lunch while shopping at Biltmore. We were craving hot dogs and decided to give this place a try. Not impressed at all with the hotdogs and naan bread, in fact I took a bite and left it there. It was smothered in thousand island sauce and very messy that It just killed my appetite.My husband's hot dog was smothered in beans and cheese. We didn't eat them. Not sure what the hype with this place is but very disappointed. Will not return."}
{"text":"A great hot dog you can't eat. Perhaps I should say super freaking difficult to eat. Especially the way they present the food.  I asked for the Pretzel Dog with Sauerkraut and light mustard. The person taking my order said they put the mustard on the side. I said, great. When I got my order there was mustard spread all both outside portions of the bun making it impossible to pick up and eat. Plus they give you about a teaspoon of sauerkraut on the thing. To add insult to injury they had you a shitty plastic fork and knife to eat it with. Neither works at all well for cutting the pretzel bread. Hey, some of us are from New York and like to pick up and eat a hot dog with our hands. In the end I had to eat it like a 5-year. Hot dog first, plain. Then rip apart the bread and get mustard all over the place. Be careful when ordering here. Or bring a metal knife and fork and a lobster bib."}
{"text":"This was a cool little spot we just happened to walk by and decided to get a bite. The food was awesome and the staff were super friendly and informative. Well definitely stop by again."}
{"text":"Just had my 1st hotdog here it's unlike any other hotdog I ever tried. It was really delicious I enjoy the BBQ taste and how the cracker jacks inside added to the flavoring. I would definitely come back to try what other hotdogs they have."}
{"text":"I love this place! It's the perfect twist on a great hot dog!!!! The dogs are served on naan bread and there are unique combinations of toppings.... my favorite is the IgbyAlso, their fried pickles are out of this world. Another taste sensation that is super yummy is their mac n cheese! I work at the Biltmore so super convenient (too convenient Ha!) for me!"}
{"text":"Staff was friendly, food was good but I'm upset that I waited 25-30 minutes for a hot dog!! And definitely a bit overpriced."}
