{"text":"I have been there many times of the last few years. I LOVE their garlic naan bread! I used to love their Chicken Korma, but over the last few months they have changed the recipe or use a commerical sauce. It is thinner and yellower than it used to be, and just isnt as good.  I will go back and try another dish, but miss my favorite korma! I was there last week and a young lady was our server. She was very attentive!"}
{"text":"Poulet tika masala délicieux. Comme la plupart des restaurants indiens, très abordable le midi mais dispendieux le soir. Les portions sont toutefois généreuses. A recommander pour les amateurs."}
{"text":"Indian... the new Chinese? Perhaps my Left Coast upbringing has made me a little narrow-minded, but when I think mid-west cuisine, it doesn't usually conjure up the variety I find in California. So when I was in Cuyahoga Falls (where!?) near Akron, Ohio (I spent a couple of weeks there for a project), I was surprised to find a pretty good Indian restaurant nearby. The prices aren't too bad and the staff is friendly. If you're looking for an Indian fix and you're in the area, I recommend this spot."}
{"text":"This place is still the best... if anything theyve changed for the better, whichis hardly noticeable beacuse they've always been outstanding... the best staff in town and the atmosphere can not be beat. They love when you enjoy their cooking and treat every dish like its a special. 5 stars all around"}
{"text":"This place is gross! Just one look at the dirty restrooms will make not want to eat there. If they let public restrooms get this gross I can only image how gross it is where you can't see !"}
{"text":"Really like this place was concerned with the mixed reviews.  clean white tablecloths lovely lunch buffet for only 799 six different vegetarian offerings and four meat offerings was very very good"}
{"text":"Nourriture fraiche et de bonne qualité. Le service est excellent; très attentif. Ils ont très bien géré notre groupe de 13 personnes. Une belle surprise à La Prairie! Delicious! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Indian food is by far my favorite and honestly getting good Indian food usually means learning to prepare it yourself. Not the case with Raj! This place has some of the best Indian sauces and dishes I have ever tasted. I love their food so much that when I was pregnant with my first child it was all I craved! (Mostly at breakfast time so I purchased a meal the night before and found that even microwaves couldn't remove the amazing flavors!"}
{"text":"The worst food experience in our life. We just ordered chicken masala and chicken korma, lamb beryani. All of them were so bad to the point we couldn't eat it more than one spoon. The kitchen is so gross. We been told from the manager that she knew we are gonna complain about the food. What kind of a manger is that. Telling us \" we don't a drama here, just pay and leave\" wow that was the rudest female I ever met. Really don't waste your time giving them a try. Worse Indian Resturant."}
{"text":"Did the lunch buffet today. The food was authentic and generally okay although some of the dishes were not sufficiently heated. The ambiance of this place leaves a lot to be desired. The carpet is worn and the tile floor area was rather dirty as were the walls. I will keep looking for an Indian place that I will want to go back to."}
{"text":"Place recently closed.  Sign now shows \"Everest Nepali - Indian\", will check it out when it re-opens."}
{"text":"The food here is exceptionally delicious, and the service is great.  When I am in the area, I look forward to the lunch buffet with its great variety of dishes (lots of vegetarian options, too)."}
{"text":"I agree with the previous poster who said this place is slipping.  I've been going here since it opened for the lunch buffet and was never too disappointed; sometimes the meat options were a bit scarce but that didn't bother me.  What did bother me was the take-out I ordered a couple of weeks ago.  They had the nerve to try to pass off regular \"Uncle Ben's\" type white rice as Basmati.  This was such a disappointment. I am thinking about breaking up with Raj for good after this stunt!"}
{"text":"This place has THE worst business ethic I've ever seen. We arrived an hour and some change before closing and were told to go away because they wanted to close early. When we pointed out their sign said 10pm closing they said oh well. Horrible business ethic"}
{"text":"Oh boy. Here we go.  I am a huge fan of the Saffron Patch, I will say this now.  Their buffet is outstanding. I have yet to eat at any better buffet of any variety. They are but 10 minutes from the Raj Mahal, and I won't give up eating there any time soon.  However.  The Raj Mahal blew my expectations out of the water. I have eaten here 4 times now, once at the buffet and 3 times through carry-out. The buffet is the one thing holding this place back from 5 stars. Yes, the buffet is super cheap. It is every day at the same time, even weekends, and their website offers coupons to get a dollar off the buffet price, bringing down to like 6.50. Pretty cool.  Their buffet was kinda sad, however. The building is tiny and cramped and you have to sit uncomfortably close to other patrons. The wait staff is very, very nice, almost on the verge of being human doormats(which I have seen being taken advantage of by some less than stellar patrons. For shame!), but it does not make up for the fact that the food offered in the buffet is made with less effort than what they serve for carry-out. I've never been one to take food from a buffet I didn't intend to completely eat, as I know my tastes pretty well, but I was saddened. I actually passed on Naan. Yeah, I don't know how that happens either. It was just...sad. You offer Palek Paneer by the bucket you say? I must be in heaven.  Not so much. Le sigh.  But get this food for take-out and it's like an entirely different restaurant. I can't even explain it. First off, they have Bhature, which is a puffed bread ball that is so very tasty. So good, and so bad for you. for our dinner, I took home Kadai Beef, which was spiced at \"Medium\" and was perfect for me. The tomato flavor was light and didn't overpower the onion or peppers in the sauce. Oh man, my mouth is watering right now. My girlfriend got the Pepper Beef, which also was amazing. I don't know if there is a different cook in the evening or if they have different quality requirements, but wow. The flavor was intense and savory.   The meals through take-out are pretty inexpensive. I think we spent 18 last time for a ton of food. I mean, my one dish made three meals. I happily ate it for three meals in a row, too.   Yes, eat here for take-out, and yes, skip the buffet. You won't be upset following this little rule.  Also, have a heart and tip carry-out. Those guys make nothing."}
{"text":"Cold buffet! I couldn't believe that the food was lukewarm at best. I started out with the veg dishes, and then wasn't brave enough to try the chicken dishes for fear of salmonella. Yikes! I'll order off the menu if I ever go back. Definitely better options for Indian, even in Akron."}
{"text":"We discovered this little Indian restaurant back in early 2013 when my sister-in-law moved into Northwest Akron.    We have only eaten there for dinner (no buffet meals), and have made it somewhat of a regular place we visit once a month.  Have tried the vegetarian Samosas, the buttery-garlic Naan, the Shrimp Jalfrezi, the sizzling chicken dishes and a few others.  All have been delicious.  My brother-in-law's mother is quite well-travelled, and when she came in from out of town, we took her to Raj Mahal for dinner.  She enjoyed the food immensely and now makes a point to visit it everytime she is in town.    Dinnertime has never been crowded, so we have gotten seated right away.  I've tried Saffron Patch (in the valley) and Cafe Tandoor in Cleveland Heights, but I keep coming back  to Raj Mahal to satisfy my cravings for Indian food.   Don't let the outside appearance scare you off.  It's an authentic little ethnic restaurant and the food is delicious!   As of September 2014, they had cleaned up the place with a fresh coat of paint, new menus and nice tablecloths."}
{"text":"I visited for the lunch buffet today after reading the good reviews on Yelp to satisfy my Indian craving. I eat Indian food alot and frequent lunch buffets. This was easily the absolute worst I've ever been to.  Maybe I went on an off day because these other reviews are positive, or maybe I'm just used to spicier/more flavorful foods in other areas (I live near DC), but these dishes had absolutely no taste whatsoever. NOTHING had any spice and everything seemed watered down. Also, we showed up at the buffet 15 minutes after it opened, and dishes were cold!! That is unacceptable.  The vegetarian options were edible (though severely lacking flavor). However, the chicken curry option had an extremely off taste, and was actually repulsive to the point of having to spit it out. The curried meatballs were clearly mealy, out-of-a-package frozen variety, and the tandoori chicken was straight up cold.  It was nice that the buffet included drinks (mango lassi and chai), however it hardly made up for the food.  Note: I do want to mention that one woman dining had ordered chicken tikka masala (I'm guessing) instead of having the buffet, which looked and smelled really good."}
{"text":"Food was good and liked that we could bring our own booze. Wish they would clean the blinds though. Still love saffron patch better"}
{"text":"Best Indian food ever? No, not really. But all the usual done well and a good selection of southern indian veg - samosa, masala dosa, etc. Great selection of pickles and sides and all you can eat nan. (Hate it when they portion it out)  I also like the big thing of chai and mango lassi available, All in all, more than what I expected for Indian food in the area. From the other reviews it looks like they vary the buffet. Grateful this place is here and will definitely go again when the mood strikes."}
{"text":"Very flavorful,  great price, and always friendly. The vegetable pakora appetizer is especially good."}
{"text":"Was really happy when I found Raj Mahal some years ago -- can't feel at home without a go-to Indian place. And IIRC it used to be pretty good. Or at least I think I liked it the first time I went. Then the second time, the lamb was chewy. Then tried the buffet, and it seemed ok, but the next time I had it was disappointed. Is there a pattern emerging here?...  Perhaps the fairest way to put this is that RM seems to be consistently inconsistent over the years. I don't know if they've changed up their kitchen staff, or if they have a new owner or what -- but it's definitely NOT a go-to Indian place for me. There have been times that I've gone and been pleased with the meals I've shared with friends and family -- but unfortunately I've had just as many mediocre meals here than good ones. The buffet is generally disappointing, as many others have noted.  So, if you're really dying for Indian, and you're in the area, and it's open, I guess you could try it. Because it's here. Just don't have too high expectations, and you'll be fine. And you might catch them on a good cooking night and think I'm nuts -- good luck with it!"}
{"text":"Food is absolutely bad. We went for lunch buffet and were served with left overs . Will not recommend this to anyone."}
{"text":"Great place, been here about 5 times and every time I go back, I remember how much I enjoy it!  Friendly staff, great food and its a bring your own wine.  Place is usually not too full, my only gripe is that it is a bit on the expensive side...menu for 2 is actually good enough for 3 adults."}
{"text":"I love to come in during their buffet hours and eat plate after plate if the chicken masala on rice. It's a little hole in the wall place, the atmosphere may be a little off point for some people, but it's one if my favorite places to make an early trip out to.   I definitely recommend trying to go in during the buffet hours for your first time. The price is cheaper and you can get a taste for what you like and don't like."}
{"text":"On aime tellement ce petit Resto . Leur agneau korma et poulet au beurre sont délicieux. Serveurs sympathiques Gagnerait à mettre un menu à emporter plus abordable et différent du menu régulier"}
{"text":"I am unable to determine if the current name is \"taste of india\" or if that is the previous name - both signs are shining together.  On the odd chance that the waitress heard my 4 year old daughter farting almost continuously the entire time we were here, the service is explainable. We had to wait an unusual amount of time for our appetizer and drinks which followed it. I kind of felt like they were avoiding the dining room or maybe could see from afar that I was suffocating.  The food was overly greasy, as though the fryer were running at half the required temperature, just like the dining room (61ish degrees. Kelvin.). It was good though. The veg biryani that my wife invariably orders all 250 times we have gotten Indian food was rather unique - totally lacking any cardamom, no smoky or spicy seasoning we have come to expect. It was more of a sweet and spicy recipe that had a great deal of large squash and mushrooms, kind of like a hibachi biryani. I preferred this recipe, wife preferred the other 249 varieties.  I ordered my eggplant \"hot and spicy\". I believe they took this to be an arithmetic sum, and did both hot... and spicy. Typically I wait until after my meal comes back out to write about it, as it gives me time to reflect and refine my opinion. However in this case I may not survive to tell the story, so I am writing it in the parking lot along with my will.  For the money, I was less than satisfied, but not disappointed. Will probably not return."}
{"text":"Serviceable Indian food. There is a better one a little south called Bombay Sitar, but not a bad option when in a pinch"}
{"text":"This is the only Indian place I will go to in the area.  It is very authentic and  the dishes are amazing!  I've only had the vegetarian dishes, but all have been delicious.  My absolute favorite is Malai Kofta.  But I've also enjoyed Aloo Gobi, Palak Paneer, Mattar Paneer, and Paneer Akbari.  The appetizers are great as well.  My favorite is Spinach Ghota (Pakora).  The atmosphere is not fancy or anything but the food definitely makes up for anything the atmosphere is lacking.  The services is always quick and the employees are polite.    Great for take out as well!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at my fair share of Indian buffets. This one stands out to me for three reasons:  1. Self-serve chai and mango lassi. \"What? You want mango lassi, you say? It is part of the buffet, drink as much as you want.\" Trust me, I will. The chai is the average fair, nothing special (barely anywhere has good chai though). If only every Indian buffet included bottomless mango lassi. One can dream...  2. Options. I noticed that there were slightly more dishes available in the buffet than I am used to, and they favored the vegetarian. Awesome for me (a vegetarian), and everyone really.  3. Thick rice pudding. I have never had rice pudding that had such a density of rice in it. I'm a fan. It was the slightest bit sweeter than the typical, and so was the lassi for that matter. If you have never had rice pudding at the end of your meal, stop cheating yourself!  The food was on par with pretty much every other Indian buffet. Keep in mind that I am only reviewing the buffet. I have noticed in the reviews that people seem to be harping on the decor and low spiciness. Very few Indian restaurants have exceptional decor, and the buffets almost always aren't spicy. This is the norm, and IMO, not something to harp on. If you want spicy Indian food, go to dinner, where you can have it tailored to your particulars, not the buffet.  One real complaint: the heating source keeping the naan warm was turned up too high or something, because all the naan was dry and brittle. What a travesty! They did have some oily, frybread naan, which I thought was okay, but my friend didn't enjoy. It is something I have never seen before.  If someone called me up right now and asked me if I wanted to go to Raj Mahal and grab some buffet, I wouldn't have to think about it, I would say yes. Of course, I don't think I've ever turned down an Indian buffet in my life."}
{"text":"Ok, so this is an updated review of the Raj Mahal. If you're interested in my older, more detailed review (I know you're not), it is here: http://www.yelp.com/biz/raj-mahal-cuyahoga-falls#hrid:2jTw8ws6pl82x4apPCy5KA  Anyway, I'll keep this brief. I used to love the crap out of Raj Mahal. A few years ago, my friend and would get takeout or dine in quite often. After my friend moved away about a year ago, I didn't go there very often. Sometime over the past year, they've noticeably gone down in quality. I've eaten there three times over the past year, most recently just a week ago. My friend was actually in town and we decided to go. Well, he confirmed what I suspected the last couple times I had gone there; it's just not the same anymore. We got the kadai chicken per usual, and it tasted like it was seasoned from a box, which didn't always seem to be the case. The price at Raj Mahal is still pretty good, since it's pretty inexpensive. The food isn't bad, it's just not nearly as good as it used to be. If you want cheap Indian food, Raj Mahal is a fine choice. If you want really tasty Indian food, maybe look elsewhere.  Oh, but they're still BYOB, so that gets bonus points.  Overall 3/5"}
{"text":"Don't let the condition of the building (interior and exterior) scare you away. This place is FANTASTIC! The food is amazing and their weekend buffet is incredibly good with lots of vegetarian options.   Sure, the place could use a deep cleaning and a few ceiling tiles could use replacing, but it's no different than that crappy little hole in the wall dive bar that you go to.   Raj Mahal has a certain type of charm that not everyone appreciates, I get that. Service had always been warm and friendly, food is excellent, and prices are super good!"}
{"text":"With lack of Indian choices in the area, I'd say it's safe to give Raj Mahal a 4. The same woman has served me almost every time I have eaten here. One time their card machine wasn't working and she told me I could just pay next time I came in! She is very kind and reviews the entire lunch buffet with me whenever I go. At $7.99 who can beat a variety of veg options during your lunch break? I love the chai tea and naan, too."}
{"text":"I would have loved to give 5 stars because the food is amazing, but the building needs a makeover. It's rundown and needs a good cleaning. Thr food though is amazing so I do like to go."}
{"text":"My family have always been fans of Indian food, but have struggled to find an authentic Indian location in NE Ohio ever since moving here from Europe. This place however is as good as it gets! The servers are very knowledgable of the full menu, which is large, and are great at explaining and suggesting options. Our food was served in a timely manner and every bite had flavor and was delicious. I had the matar paneer, my favorite Indian dish, and this was possibly the best version I have had. I can not forget to praise them on the Naan breads as well. As any lover of Indian food will know, you can not have an Indian meal with out treating your self to a naan, and at this location, I had to treat my self to TWO because they were that delicious.   I highly recommend this spot if you want authentic Indian food. The location and outside can be misleading, but trust me, the food is top notch."}
{"text":"I had to contribute a review to this because I completely disagree with the bad review below! I love Raj Mahal. Living in Philadelphia I have access to a lot of really great ethnic food, but honestly, outside of New York's Curry Hill, this is the best Indian food I have had. Their lunch buffet is on point, with the standard tandoori chicken, chicken makhani, fresh and buttery naan, excellent saffron rice (a surprisingly hard thing to get right!) and aloo gobi. Their gulab jamuns are excellent as is their rice pudding- and they are literally the only Indian restaurant outside of London where I have been able to get jelabi. I can't get those in Philly- not even in New York! Their menu items are great too- especially the chicken vindaloo. Yum.  The ambiance of the place is something I really love about it. It's a legit ethnic restaurant in Akron, OH. They have fun Indian decorations, and it is neat and clean if a bit sparse. The bathroom is questionable and it can get chilly if you are sitting near the windows in the winter, but it's really a cool place to go. Oh and they have a shop next door, which makes going to lunch or dinner a little more of an outing. This place is great- I really hope that people keep going because it is one of my favorite places in the Akron area."}
{"text":"I love Indian food. It's delicious and filling and so vegetarian friendly. Unfortunately, good Indian food is kind of hard to come by in small town Mid-Western America. I'd driven by Raj Mahal hundreds, if not thousands of times over the years and never stopped because it looked kinda dingy and rundown. A friend of mine told me that he dined there often and that even though it looked kind of run down the food was amazing and even better than Saffron Patch, a restaurant that I love. Usually my friend has pretty good taste, so I figured I'd give it a shot. When I walked in the first thing I noticed was the smell. It smelled like sour turds sprinkled with curry. I was pretty horrified, but thought maybe it would get better. It didn't. I almost walked out, but my date said he wanted to stick it out. We were seated at a table which was coated in a sticky film. There was a dead gnat stuck in the film. The water tasted kind of off. We ordered the Assorted Vegetable Appetizer. The veggie samosa's we're pretty good and everything else was edible, but not amazing. I ordered the vegetable curry and my date ordered meat masala. My curry was some of the worst that I've ever had. Flavorless and nothing about it tasted fresh. My date found a hair in his masala. We also had the pure delight of having flies and gnats buzz around us the entire meal. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"I want to give three stars because the place looks like it could use a deep clean and a little updating but I have to give four because the food was so good!   Our waiter brought us water right away. No ice in the water, what's up with that? He also didn't ask if we wanted anything other than water to drink.   We ordered the mixed naan plate. It came with eight half piece of naan. Some were plain with herbs and garlic. Some were stuffed with potatoes and peas and herbs. They were all yummy.   For my entree, I forget what it's called but it's chicken in a cashew sauce with golden raisins and spices. It was so good! I loved it! Honestly, I could care less about the chicken part. The sauce was just wonderful! I put it over the rice and scooped it up with pieces of naan and it was so delicious. You know when you're a kid and your mom makes some kind of meat in some kind of sauce and ladles it over rice and it's warm and comforting? It was just like that. It's like a hug for your stomach.  Overall, pretty good experience. I'm not sure the prices match the quality of the food. My bill alone came to $17 before tip."}
{"text":"Had a n urge for Indian food and since its close to home decided to take something to go. The restaurant's decor is nice but more importantly it was clean. No wet mouldy tiles on the ceiling from a flood that was never fixed like most places. Took a naan bread and aloo gobi. Bread was amazing and the aloo was good. I was hoping for a little more spice. I'll definitely be back and update the review when I try more dishes."}
{"text":"Just went there with some friends for the Sunday buffet. They have changed the layout of the restaurant and committed to a buffet more than twice the size than what they had in the past. They even had mango lassi and chai tea fill-up posts. Very pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Raj Mahal multiple times over the years and it is absolutely my favorite restaurant. The buffet is a great price and you really get your moneys worth. The staff are so nice and one of the waiters is hilarious. For dinner/carry out I try and get something different each time cause there's so many choices, but my favorite meal is chicken makhani, rice and naan. Definitely gonna get some more food soon!"}
{"text":"With no menu to be found online I decided to just call and ask for some more general indian food as well as whatever they recommended to go with it. Fifteen minutes, she told me.  Fifteen minute was perfect. I was hungry and some indian food sounded great. She put me down for Chicken Masala (with jeera rice) and Naan. Later I would find out for the great price of about $13.  Upon arrival, maybe 10 or 15 minutes later, I realized the entire place was empty. Now I am scratching my head \"why?!?!\" as the food was delicious! Perhaps just not enough people in the area like indian food.  Now I have a paper menu and perhaps I can be more daring than just Chicken Masala."}
{"text":"Next to Juniper Junction, the Raj Mahal is my go-to second choice. The place is pretty unclean looking, though the owners have down some decent renovations over the years to spruce things up, but expect the occasional leaky ceiling and some dirty walls. The buffet is fantastic and the dishes are generally very authentic."}
{"text":"Mon mari et moi adorons cet endroit. Nous y sommes allé au moins une dizaine de fois. Leur menu midi est particulièrement abordable et la soupe en entrée est vraiment délicieuse. Leur pain Nan est parfait, le service personnalisé et les plats toujours excellents. Ah oui, on y va souvent avec notre plus jeune et elle est toujours très bien accueillie."}
{"text":"Always up for a culinary adventure, hubby and I found this non-descript restaurant on the corner end of a strip mall.  It looked sketchy from the outside, and lacked ambiance on the inside, but the familiar smell of Indian spices kept our feet planted.  We both dined on tandoori specials (hubby had the raj mahal and I had the fish), and were a little disappointed the dishes weren't exactly as the menu pictures and descriptions suggested, but were still pleased with the flavors.  The naan was a bit on the dense side and, for some reason, was brought out towards the end of our meal.    Overall, a nice experience.  Nothing special, but certainly worth the drive when coupled with a movie at the independent theatre nearby.  We saw the new Philip Seymour Hoffman movie and were delighted when our evening ended with a rainstorm.  We'll be back for the buffet."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for Raj Mahal, but I got sick after eating the buffet. At least it was tasty?"}
{"text":"It's great to have nice Indian food in La Prairie. The staff is very nice and helpful. I have always done take-out as a sit down service might be a little long with a 2yr old. But the food is always fresh and they are open to substitutions if you wish.    Weekday lunch specials are available also."}
{"text":"The food is great and so is the price especially for lunch buffet. More option for buffet than other Indian restaurants I have been to. Not to mention that items on the buffet are changed constantly with exception of some signature dishes. The flavor remains consistent and always tasty every time I visit.  There is not much ambiance beside Indian music being played but the reason to go there is the food. Possibly the best Indian restaurant in NE Ohio. Recommendation: Chicken Masala, Aloo Gobi, Lamb Curry."}
{"text":"It has been many months since my partner and I have been here for dinner. We had a craving for a good briyani and this place had the best in town the last we knew. Unfortunately, this is no longer true.  I ordered the lamb briyani and my partner ordered the seafood briyani. Both our rice dishes were soggy, and bland. It did have a good amount of meat and seafood but little else besides the rice. We were very disappointed.   The service was also quite lacking. We weren't attended to in a timely manner and while the staff was friendly, the server we had appeared to be amateurish and not professional.  It's time to find another Indian restaurant for dinner."}
{"text":"Used to be better. The food is reasonable and tasty. The service is fine but not exceptional"}
{"text":"Visited the lunch buffet today after meaning to go here for some time now. The reviews I've read were mixed but I generally feel like the good reviews they have were enough for me to venture over from Kent, as this whole area is a wasteland filled with a tragic lack of Indian food. And I can't explain to you how disappointed I was that I wasted 20 dollars for myself and my boyfriend to eat here.  The rice was straight up crunchy and oily. The vegetarian curry was edible and the chicken tikka only vaguely resembled some kind of meat product in a tasteless orange soup. Sadly, I could have definitely made better Indian food at my home for a much better price. I couldn't tell if the green stuff was meant to be mint chutney, the chai tasted like diluted skim milk with a distant echo of chai flavor and honestly, the only decent thing I ate was one piece of naan bread....which was cold and burnt. In the end, I felt so sad to sign away 20 hard earned dollars when I could've at least gone to Jaipur Junction for dry chicken or Saffron Patch for more money than I make in a day.  I want to go back to Columbus."}
{"text":"Looks raggedy on the outside but looks are deceiving!  Food is awesome and you get alot for your money!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  The food is amazing and the service is impeccable.  I sometimes order  TAKE OUT and they prepare everything quite quickly!!! I'm satisfied every time, you could tell it's a family run business because they take everything to ."}
{"text":"Good food. Good service. It wasn't busy on a Saturday night, which is a little concerning. More people should check it out. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"I love Indian food, and this place is the best. Skip the expensive place close by this is the real deal.   I have had a variety of things off the menu here, and been for the lunch buffet. Everything has always been excellent. It is a small place and seems to be family run, the wait staff isn;t professionals but they are always good and attentive. My one complaint would be that I think they take their spice levels down a little too much for my taste. I think like a lot of other ethnic food places they are afraid of making it too hot for us Americans who seem to love bland food. Not me, BRING THE HEAT!"}
{"text":"I love this place. Sure it isn't the prettiest environment, but your table is clean, utensils are clean, service is excellent, prices are affordable and the food is ADDICTING. Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"Indian cuisine in La Prairie? What year are we? Is this a dream? Quite the contrary, this is real. Raj Mahal has an extensive menu that covers many popular Indian dishes and will certainly satisfy any taste bud.   With a finer feel than your average Indian restaurant, this place is run by overly friendly staffs that will never let your glass of water go empty. My biryani was among the best I've ever had. They certainly know how to hit the spice rack. I know that many people might be turned off by the strong smell of Indian restaurants but trust me, the food is worth it.   Raj Mahal is a little more expensive than your typical Indian place but the quality is up there and it's certainly a nice addition to La Prairie. Next time you're hungry, I'd recommend trying Raj Mahal instead of going for pizza or poutine from La Belle Province."}
{"text":"We have eaten here dozens of times over the past 8 years. They serve serviceable food. I know that's not what you want to hear if you're e chef, but its good enough. And it's cheap for Indian food.   That said, the menu can be hit or miss. Some items are amazing, some are fair, but nothing has ever been even close to bad.  If you want really good and more expensive Indian, dive 5 minutes down the road to the Saffron Patch."}
{"text":"Nope. Never eating here again. This restaurant is in a very run down plaza and no attention has been paid to the inside of the dining room. The ceiling tiles are all random, look like they are about to fall on your head, and seem to have been painted multiple times to hide caked on dirt. The carpet is sticky and torn. If the table didn't have a seemingly clean tablecloth on it I would have walked right out. The food was acceptable, but nothing spectacular. The service  was downright awful. It took begging and ten minutes to get water refills. Total time from ordering to food was over 40 minutes, which is insane for a restaurant with 3 tables seated. There are several other local choices for indian food. Every single one of them is better in every regard. This place is a dump. If the kitchen is as clean as the dining room I am surprised I did not get sick."}
