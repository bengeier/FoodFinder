{"text":"What a great discovery!  From grilled garlic bread and caprese salad, to porcini pasta and tiramisu,  everything was prepared  and presented with loving care.  I appreciated the homemade pasta and the moderate prices.  A hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I was with a group from New York and this place was the best we had in our entire stay.  The food is excellent, all of the pasta was very good, with the tortellini Gorgonzola and the Veal Milanese (though that may have been a special) really standing out.  The husband and wife who run it are as warm and nice as could be.  & FYI prices are also very reasonable."}
{"text":"Matterello is super cute, four stars just edging so so close to five. We had just a few minor complaints... but let's start with the good!

Located it Little Italy right on Saint-Denis, it was easy to find and more importantly, easy to get a day of reservation on a Saturday night. This place appears to be run by a couple and one or more of their teenage/adult children, which I found incredibly charming. Fair warning, the menu is not in English but rather a mix of Italian (dish names) and French (descriptions). No fear though, the owner will happily explain everything to you and answer your million translation questions. 

We started with the arugula and Parmesan salad which came with delicious halved heirloom grape tomatoes and dressed with olive oil and balsamic. Such a light and refreshing start to the meal. Next they brought the house bread - lightly brushed with olive oil and grilled. Loved it! Bread can so often be an after thought but you can tell it wasn't here. 

On to entrees - I chose the carbonara because it's an all time fav. The pasta (all made in house) was perfectly cooked to al dente which is the only
way pasta should be cooked. The pancetta and pram flavor permeated throughout - my only small gripe is the sauce was very thick - it needed about a ladle full of pasta water to thin it out and make it a touch creamier (rather than thick and sticky). Boyfriend had the Porcini pasta (mushrooms, olive oil, garlic) and he had no complaints. 

All of their desserts are made in house - tiramisu, creme brûlée, and cannoli. We opted for the creme brûlée, and in comes our second area of improvement. The flavor was spot on but the custard wasn't cold enough when the sugar was torched, so it separated a little under the heat. The sugar was also just a touch too done. 

All in all - we would definitely come back if in Montreal again. Just a few small tweaks will take this place from great to amazing!"}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure why this restaurant has such a high rating. My experience there was anything but memorable. Their pasta dishes are fairly basic as is the set up of the restaurant in terms of decor. I went in expecting really interesting dishes and left underwhelmed. Don't get me wrong, the food isn't bad. It just wasn't exceptional or worth the visit. Considering how close it is to little Italy, I would recommend going to other pasta restaurants before this one."}
{"text":"Recently went to have supper with a group of friends at this newly opened restaurant located close to Little Italy and really enjoyed it!  The ambiance is very cozy and modern eith it's open kitchen concept. Good for groups. Service was super warm and friendly and very welcoming. We sampled a few entrees and loved the calamari, fish croquettes and tomato and boccacini. Very tasty and fresh! Matterello's speciality dishes are home made pasta dishes...we totally loved all the different pasta dished from the mushroom pasta to the seafood pasta...all tasted amazing and so fresh.  Would definitely recommend trying this resto!  Great for all occasions"}
{"text":"Absolutely stellar food and hospitality by the people who work there. Great for big groups."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  It is a family run place with emphasis on service .  The salads were exquisite and fresh, the dressing sublime.  The pasta entres were a carnival of flavors.  The pasta is gone made and it shows.  This is a unique find.  Pasqualino, the proprietor chef is an artist.  The service is genuine and super friendly.  Find this place and go."}
