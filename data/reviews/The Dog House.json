{"text":"This place is one of Bedford's hidden secrets.  If you want a motherf***** stacked dog, and I mean when I say MOTHERF***** stacked, this is the place.  Cheap as f*** too.  Show some love and go to the Dog House.   You'll be a fan of \"Doggie Style\" in no time.  ;-)"}
{"text":"Great chilli cheese dogs. Quick and affordable. No seating inside. Take out only unless you want to sit outside at picnic table. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I have to agree with the other reviews and add another \"GO THERE\" to the list.  Keep your eyes open when driving there, if you blink, you might miss it.  I got the meal deal too with my 1/2# dog with just my toppings.  Its fast, cheap and delicious!"}
{"text":"The Ruben dog is awesome!!! This is my favorite lunch spot!"}
{"text":"Sweet potato fries are good depending on who's there and the veggie dog is great!"}
{"text":"First time going today. After reading the reviews I decided to go check the out. Very tiny. Staff friendly. I got a chili dog. It was ok. Nothing special, but ok. Chili was a little bland. Prices good."}
{"text":"Best sandwich shop in town, great prices, fast and friendly service, puts the fast food places to shame.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot if you get there before the line is outside. I've had about 5 or 6 hotdogs and a few of their subs and a wrap. All of them are delicious and plenty more than filling. Great quality. Definitely recommend a Bahama mamma in place of you hotdog whenever they have them in stock. It cost a little more(bit much) and is amazing. I try to stop in once a week. Very friendly people with the eight price for the eats."}
{"text":"Their food might be good, I don't know. I walked in one night around 6:30 and got in line behind about four or five other customers. After a few minutes, the guy behind the counter looks up at me and tells me they're closed. When do they close, I ask. Fifteen minutes ago, he says. Nevermind that according to their sign they stay open until 8, he's already serving four other people, and assembling a hot dog doesn't exactly take that long. Maybe he got a booty call and had to close up early. I complied and left, never to return."}
{"text":"what can i say! homemade everything and 1995 prices! a must go to. large portions and incredibly nice staff!"}
{"text":"Like my friend Joyce P., I'm also a huge fan of the dog house! I've been there a couple times for a chili-and-cheese (nacho or cheddar) dawg. I might branch out next time- they offer quite a variety of dogs! I also love the cheese fries. There's really nowhere to sit inside, but the place is painted the colors of ketchup and mustard and covered with cute pictures, so it gives a nice, nostalgic feeling. Extra points - they actually sell MYSTIC (the juice drink)- who remembers Mystic!?"}
{"text":"If you're looking for cheap local eats, The Dog House should be at the top of your list. Service was excellent!"}
{"text":"I get so excited about hot dogs!! A friend and I were planning on going here together for a long time and things just kept getting in the way of our plans, but we finally made it a couple of weeks ago. It was one of those strangely hot fall days, so we sat outside and watched the Coventry traffic (which can be really entertaining and a little terrifying at 3pm).  I went with a Chicago dog since I'd been craving one (and, yes, I know there will be no Chicago dog like a Chicago dog from Chicago--DUH) and it was pretty impressive for a tiny little hot dog shop in Coventry. I was pleasantly surprised. I was also disappointed that I wasn't any hungrier so that I could stuff myself with more juicy hot dog goodness, but oh well. It's not like I live far...  The man behind the counter was pleasant and jovial--he even joked with us a bit when we expressed how overwhelmed we were with excitement and choices. This is obviously a run in and out with your food kind of place unless you want to sit outside. The interior is small and cramped and reminds me of the concession stand I worked for pee wee baseball games when I was 15; it's not somewhere I'd get excited to go sit down and eat at, but more of an \"eat as you walk coventry\" treat.  ps the prices are pretty standard for hot dogs and hot dogs piled high with crazy toppings."}
{"text":"Good dogs. Owner lied and said he served Vienna hot dogs. He don't. But the dog he serves is a good dog. It still makes a good Chicago style dog."}
{"text":"I love this place. It is ideal for a quick bite. The guy who cooks and also serves here is awesome. They have veggie dog, which is my first hot dog and I would not mind having many more of these whenever I feel like eating a hot dog.   The location is ideal for a evening snack. I would not recommend this place for a dinner but good to grab a quick bite on the go."}
{"text":"Little non descript place blink and you will miss it. Good hot dogs, good salads, good corned beef. All in all its a cheap great meal for lunch. Line can be out the door. 3 people cannot fit in here. No parking. But does not matter. If your by here. Go get a hot dog."}
{"text":"Great little place great prices its been here for Years, great hot dogs you can't beat this place"}
{"text":"I love this little hole in the wall place near Coventry Village. The Dog House serves up variations on a hot dog. I had the \"Atlanta\" -- so delicious. The corn dogs aren't bad either. It's great to go on a breezy summer day and sit outside with a dog house hot dog!"}
{"text":"It is what is and it is good at it. Owner/preparer of the dogs is friendly and patient. The menu is actually quite huge as far as the different types of toppings so you can pretty much get anything you want."}
{"text":"Looks like a dive from outside, but food is outstanding.  Not just good hot dogs, this is the only place my  mother in law will get a cornbeef. Try their Chef Salad, it's enormous, enough to feed 4 people. The only place I'll get a salad from."}
{"text":"I was starved one day after work while visiting my boyfriend at his job. Pulled out my phone and clicked straight one yelp. I read the reviews and decided to try it out. I know the reviews said it was a whole in the wall but wow I was really surprised at how it looked. I almost left but I was in a hurry so I pushed my luck. Went in and boy was it small but that hot dog had BIG flavor. For $3.75 with chips and a drink you can't help but try it out. I'm glad I did. The couple that own the place  are super sweet as well."}
{"text":"Surprised that such a hole in the wall could produce such a delicious hot dog! I opted for the whole meal deal package and paid a whopping $3.75. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"They have Chicago-style Italian Beef Sandwiches and make Chicago-style hot dogs that are tastier than most of the dogs you can get in the windy city. These are the only two items I've tried from their menu and that's not going to change anytime soon!"}
{"text":"I always pass this place on my way to work, so I decided to stop in one day. When I first walked in, an unusual pungent smell took over my nose; still not sure why it smells that way. I wanted to turn around then but the reviews were so good, I decided to still order. I asked for a polish sausage but was given a kielbasa; no biggie. Paid for my food and also bought a brownie. The person at the counter said they're baked fresh every Sunday, and these were part of that batch. Sunday was 5 days ago. I think a week is too long to have brownies sitting in a warm restaurant. The place wasn't very sanitary; extremely small, but could still be clean. Rather grimey.  Those few things weren't the worst part, though. There was a wing of some type of insect in my sandwich. Not sure what it is, maybe a moth or something. I did not finish my food, and won't be back. The cleanliness wasn't up to standard and I shouldn't have bug remnants in my food."}
{"text":"The Dog House is a small shack located along Broadway Ave in downtown Bedford. If Guy Fieri had a say, this place would be categorized as a dive in every sense of the imagination.  The inside of this hot dog emporium resembles a closet more so than a take-out restaurant. At most, four, maybe five grown men can fit comfortably inside all at once. While there is one small two-top, most people order their food to-go. There's also a picnic table just outside for the claustrophobic.   The menu is surprising and somewhat extensive for the size of the place. Hot dogs of every variety, Italian sausage, kielbasi, polish boys, corned beef sandwiches, soups, salads, wraps, subs and sides galore. The prices are recession friendly. 150 pennies will get you a hot dog. For 75 more cents, it will get you a soda.   I chose the traditional Chicago Dog which consisted of a water simmered all-beef dog topped with yellow mustard, diced onion, sweet relish, a dill pickle spear, tomato wedges, jalape√±os and sprinkled with celery salt. The verdict? Mighty tasty. My only complaint was that the bun didn't seem sufficient enough to hold all the toppings. It became soggy by the time I was half way through.   For the quality and love displayed at The Dog House, one would be hard pressed to find such value anywhere else.  At the same time, you're also patronizing a locally run establishment run by real residents of the community. It also beats the boring frozen prepared crap that some pimply-faced pubescent teen would make you at the local TJ McFunster's."}
{"text":"When you drive past this place the first thing you think is... Is this place this big??? Could fit about 3 customers but that does not take away from the chili dogs I ordered. I was ok with eating them in my car, because there is no sitting inside. The chili was absolutely awesome! The hotdogs they say are custom ordered, which they are a good hotdog. For two chili dogs it only ran me $4.50, which I'm stuffed. For the value and quality you would be a fool not to get some food here. If you don't like hotdogs they do have sandwiches that sounds and looked good!"}
{"text":"The lady refuses to grill any onion to make a Maxwell St Polish properly. Blasphemy. I want mine like the Chicago Maxwell St Polish poster she has hanging on the wall, not it's half assed Cleveland raw onion cousin."}
{"text":"Awesome food at a good price! Support local businesses!!! If you like extremely hot, try the habanero hot sauce on a dog. I tried it today and it's awesome hot!!"}
{"text":"If you're in Bedford Ohio and you want an AMAZING Hot Dog, Polish Boy or sandwich then you have to try The Dog House!  PERIOD!  Prices are cheap!  You will be surprised at what you can get for $5 but most items are within $5-$10 range and I have to say the hardest part with The Dog House is deciding from their VAST menu!  I LOVED THE TACO DOG!  Their daily special is decent too; Choice of a few different styled hot dogs, drink, chips and pickle for around $5!  AMAZING!  Honestly, get one of these specials before you head down to an Indians game and you will save some money!  If there were any issues that I had to point out to first time customers is that it is a SMALL business.  Parking is scarce.  There are 2-3 parking spots next to The Dog House then you will have to park on Broadway and that can be dangerous!  With that said, the only other issue with parking is that if you have trouble finding a place to park then there will be a \"Chipotle like\" wait.  The inside is tiny as there are a few seats to sit if there is a wait for your food.  The inside can seriously hold, maybe 5 people before the line is outside.  But PLEASE, do NOT let any of this dissuade you.  I just want you to be prepared for parking and a possible wait but it is DEFINITELY worth the wait!  Yes, I would wait outside for one these hot dogs ESPECIALLY for their daily combo!  Great little place and enough here to make a good day GREAT!  There is even a red picnic table outside if you just want to sit down.  I am so glad I live close so I can walk there if I wanted (burn off some calories too!).  I can absolutely say that I look forward to stopping here again!  Also, they have a points card now!  You buy so many hot dogs, you can earn to get a free one!  Who doesn't love a FREE hot dog!  Try The Dog House and see for yourself."}
{"text":"It was a hot and humid summer day.  We saw people on Coventry walking with swirls of orange on a cone...ice cream cone!  Process of elimination deduced it was from The Dog House.  They have vanilla and orange flavors; cost of delicious-ness piled high $1.50.  (Sorry, if you were expecting a review for the hot dogs.)"}
{"text":"Just a Must Go.. Old world style, hole in the wall great eats. One of the few places you will crave. Best part is you will quickly know they put their heart in soul into this family business. Specially made sausage and dogs from local butchers, homemade chili, and a laid back \"get what you want\" atmosphere. Awesome!"}
