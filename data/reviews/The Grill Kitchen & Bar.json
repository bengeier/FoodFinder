{"text":"Every place has those nights where one staff can't get it together. We had that last night a lot of mistakes and wait... But once the managers picked up on it they went in to full speed to salvage the dinner. Mistakes happen and these guys did everything they could and was greatly appreciated. 

Food: Saturday night they have prime rib.. Excellent and one of the biggest cuts I have ever gotten. 

The wedge salad here is awesome.. Unfortunately this time this was one of the errors as it came out after the prime rib. So we will return later this week to eat that!"}
{"text":"The Grill has a complete menu, from burgers to complete dinners. I had the Pork Shank, and it was great. Our server was very good with excellent knowledge of the menu. The Mac & Cheese was wonderful."}
{"text":"We have eaten at the Grill and its bar, which shares some of the menu, three times in the past few months.  Each time the service was excellent, attentive without being intrusive.  The food was always well prepared and well presented.  Each dish was excellent and the portion sizes were ample.

I thought the prices were very reasonable.  On our last visit we learned that the bar portion of the restaurant even does take out.  Just call ahead with your order.  The bar is called \"Bogey's.\""}
{"text":"We were resort guests with a group from my husbands company and planned to eat on the patio at The Grill our last night here. Bad decision! We called earlier and left a message to make reservations, no one ever called us back. So we showed up at 6. Barely anyone was there, yet they told us the patio was booked and we could not sit outside since we didn't have a reservation. However as we sat at our table inside, we heard multiple people come in and say they had no reservations and were seated on the patio immediately. Not only was this experience super disappointing, but so was the food. Bland. Our waiter only came back once when we were finished with our food. We would never go back here."}
{"text":"May I say that the GRILL is wonderful.  We had dinner there tonight; and Taylor was our waiter, he gave us great service, was very attentive and explained the entrees well. The chefs prepared our meal perfectly; the halibut I had was crispy crunchy on top; a buttery finish and the tender perfect flake of the fish beneath was hot when served; and melted perfectly into the puree with sautéed fennel and artichoke hearts and sundried tomatoes. It was perfection. my husband had the roasted chicken; and he asked for the sautéed potatoes instead of kale; which made the dish outstanding. It was on a great smear of delicious grits and grapes as a side feature. The star was my appetizer shrimp cocktail.....hard to do it justice but it had the most meaty and delectable huge fresh shrimp in a flat-out EXCELLENT cocktail sauce; shaved radish and fennel and watercress, and so darn good I know I will crave it for breakfast.  Beautiful setting, clean glasses and silver (very important to us) and just a great experience. They really care to serve good food; attractive but temperature perfect; with panache!"}
{"text":"Good food, however it gets expensive real fast.  The half chicken was great.  The staff will bend over backwards to get your order correct."}
{"text":"We ate here all five nights we stayed at the resort, because at the end of an amazing day why ruin a good thing. The apple salad, the salmon, scallops, are all memorable bests. Great wine to accompany. Also the staff is attentive , friendly, and honest."}
{"text":"It would be hard to find a better view, but it would definitely  not be hard to find a better selection an anywhere else. The lunch menu is so limited is almost upsetting. Nobody wants to see the majestic mountains with a sandwich. They should do better! I ended up ordering a bowl of Onion soup, but I got the portion of a cup. Big bowl... Small content. The patio is amazing, the views are stunning, but more work is needed."}
{"text":"We stopped in for a glass of wine on the amazing deck Friday night during our stay.  The deck has a fantastic view of the golf course and has plenty of cover to keep cool even when the temperatures are warm.  Nice wine list and a super fun bartender too to keep us entertained!"}
{"text":"The surrounding atmosphere is absolutely BREATHING. The Boulders has to be one of the very top resorts in the metro Phoenix area for atmosphere. The Grill at the Boulder's Resort is a casual American/Style restaurant that overlooks the golf course. On our visit they were only using the bar area so our view was a golf shop.

My review is only for lunch based on one lunch time visit.

Without boring you with all the details of the sandwich platters we had I can summarize that both sandwiches really were good. Both were made of nicely seasoned prepared in house meats and both were served on quality fresh breads. 

At this point we are at four stars for the sandwiches. A few knit-picky things can be added but are not important at all. We just need to say the sandwiches themselves are solid and solid equals four stars. Blow me away with something and that's five stars.

I felt the need to remove a star for the fries that come with the sandwiches. The fries were hot and fresh but were very similar in taste and texture to fast food fries. I go out often and have dined in many places. So when a sandwich is in the $15.00 price range I have an expectation of what the side might be like. House made chips or better fries with a house made pickle certainly would elevate the platter and help to match to platter to the wonderful amazing Boulder's Resort.

Service was friendly and efficient.

The Grill at the Boulders participates in the Scottsdale Preferred so if you have that card you can get one meal for free.

3.5 stars"}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast and sat near the fireplace in the bar. I ordered the Eggs Benedict and coffee. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the hollandaise  sauce was very good- they even give you plenty to eat with the potatoes too. The Boulders Grill also has Stevia in the sugar dish- it's the first restaurant I have been to that offers Stevia an all natural sugar that is healthier than equal or sweet n low. I always carry my own so that was a highlight during my breakfast. The waitress was very attentive and friendly. I enjoyed my breakfast here."}
{"text":"Limited menu.  We were seated next to a large, noisy group, even though there were plenty of open tables.  My entree, steak frites, was fine, but my wife's kale salad with ahi tuna was absolutely awful.  Service was mediocre.  We like Palo Verde at the Boulders, would recommend going there but definitely not the Grill."}
{"text":"I've been here in the past and will not be returning. On my last recent visit I could see the menu had become very limited, service was incredibly slow (perhaps they are understaffed), and the worst part was the overpriced average food at best. Management doesn't seem to care most times as they were not to be seen. Most servers/bartenders seemed untrained and I even witnessed a server who was unable to open a bottle of wine for their guest. Personally, I will never visit this place again and the service was atrocious. If there was a zero star option I would pick that. The fall off of service from Waldorf Astoria to Columbia Sussex seems to have a very negative impact on the resort service and staff."}
{"text":"Truly one of the worst dining experiences we have had since we moved to Arizona 2005 .First of all it took 30 minutes to get cocktails and the place was not busy.  When they did arrive we were informed that they had run out of sparkling wine.  At a Waldorf Astoria ?  The waitress had an attitude was unkept and looked like she just fell out of bed.  The food was average and the portions small. I noticed from the moment we walked in,and during dinner that plates were being sent back to the cook who also seems to have an attitude.  Another interesting observation was that the waiters seemed obsessed with removing plates and glasses, as if they were going to be stolen.  And finally the decor the dump needs a make over.  Nothing about the decor is desert south west the over lights and sconce are awful.  Basically it's a management problem based on corporate apathy.  I give the place one star reluctantly."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try a casual dinner at the grill tonight. It is located at the Boulders with views of the golf course. Beautiful setting. We shared a kale and strawberry salad. Very tasty. My entree was the evening's special short ribs served over mashed potatoes with grilled asparagus and carrots. Very tender and delicious. My wife had the Friday catch of the day, Scottish salmon on a plank with asparagus and a corn casserole. Again, very flavorful. We shared a gelato for dessert. The dinner was very enjoyable. The dining room is cozy and quietly elegant. Denise was our server. She was exceptional! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"One Massive Disappointment. First of all, you must be at least 75 years of age to enter. 

Then, don't expect anything on the menu to actually look appetizing. It's difficult enough to get to and if you want to actually find a place for lunch you basically have to walk through a golf pro shop.

I can't understand how this place has 4 stars. I sat down for some lunch and these sweaty old guys came over and sat in the chairs right across from my table and began removing their shoes and placing their feet on the table. The food and menu selection was incredibly disappointing, and all the tables were dirty.

The Boulder's may be in a beautiful location, but clearly there is no respect for the location they have because the perfection of the surroundings is clearly not reflected within this \"restaurant\". Kind of nice interior decor but actually looks kind of run down if you get a close enough look.

Awful."}
{"text":"This review is way over due.  Our family went for Thanksgiving dinner last November, a little delayed in a review like I mentioned. My mother in law insisted on going there since we did for years.
It was a disaster....the turkey dinner was like a TV dinner, it was a rolled turkey which was difficult to cut with a knife. I had Sea-bass, which was a size of a plum and like fried.  The filets of beef were very small but excellent.
Service was ok .
I did not want to embarrass my mother in law  and complain at the time, but my husband suggested I call the manager the following day . Spoke to Clayton the manager and he really didn't seem interested in what I had to say.  
Bottom line, not going back and spending $700 for five adults and two children for a terrible dinner."}
{"text":"We are very disappointed with this restaurant. The setting is gorgeous but the food is was 
Insulting. We took our family Christmas Day and it was embarrassing. It caused everyone to have a terrible time. 
The Salad we ordered was thrown on plate with no dressing and had none of the ingredients that were on the menu. The tuna melt was mushy and tasteless. The forbidden rice bowl was some kind of joke for $22.00.  The French dip was like a fast food version of the sandwich with a very  small amount of beef on bread.
They need to get their act together and improve their food and presentation, using fresh ingredients and actually serve what is described on their menu. 
My suggestion is to play your round of golf and leave the property for your meal."}
{"text":"Went to lunch there today at Bogey's Grill at the Boulders. Walked in and were greeted by a server that looked irritated that we came in.  I was not too hungry so I ordered the spicy shrimp, and my husband had the cobb salad.  His was very good, no problem.  When the server set my plate down, there was a whopping FOUR small shrimp. Wow! For $14.00, I guess I expected more. I won't be going there if I'm hungry!"}
