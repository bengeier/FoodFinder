{"text":"Love this place - been going here for years! Many creative dishes such as the bagela and mish-mash. All of such are freaking delicious. If you haven't been to this Montreal institution make it a tip priority. NOW!"}
{"text":"Excellent greasy spoon, I can see why this place has so many faithful regulars. The service is as outstanding as the food, cooked exactly how you want it just like food cooked at home would be. Every time I go I feel so welcomed, it's like visiting my grandparent's for breakfast."}
{"text":"amazing -an institution in Montreal - !!! went over there and had the ultimate experience for breakfast  the mish mash has eggs and anything else you can think of in this omelet  any one that is hungry and wants to hang out at a neighborhood breakfast joint  trust me this is the best"}
{"text":"Amazing and original. Try the Mishmash!  The staff are really friendly, the seating is limited, but plop yourself down, and don't forget to pass the milk!"}
{"text":"if you ever need to feel like you're at your grandma's for brunch, come here.  the nice old ladies serve up decent , filling, satisfying grub that cures any type of hangover or heartbreak, whatever you suffer from.   free refills of strong black coffee, good conversations with anyone and everyone there, and homebaked cookies on the house. if you're not already stuffed.    must-go."}
{"text":"Second time I go--in just two weeks. I'm sold. Really simple food but also really cheap and tasty. Go early (like 8am) on a sunny Saturday morning and sit outside to enjoy the weather before too many customers start lining up."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype and folklore around this place.  Normally, I love whole-in-the-wall greasy spoons, and this place certainly looks the part. The only problem is that food kind of sucks.  There is nothing exceptional about their greasy spoon breakfasts. Everything is rushed together, and regardless of what you order, your plate is nothing more than a blend of browns and yellows.  That, and the staff behind the counter handle money and your food at the same time. So that kind of grossed me out."}
{"text":"\"I'm the best!\" Yells the man behind the counter as he flips absurd amounts of meat and potatoes and eggs. And it's true. he is the best . The mish mash. the grilled breakfast with three easy over eggs and four kinds of meat and those delightful potatoes. Oh my goodness. It was delicious. I came with my family, and everyone left with a huge smile on their face. the coffee was tasty, the sourdough toast was scrumptious....couldn't have been happier with our meal. drove to Montreal from California and this was one of the best meals we had along the way. It's a very scenic restaurant with a great feeling. I wish i had gone to school at McGill so I could get drunk and have cosmos for breakfast the next day. Wow. Cosmos gave me memories that I will keep for a long time and a standard by which to compare all other breakfasts. I love you."}
{"text":"La quintessence du Mish Mash les autres ne sont que de pâle copie.  Le Mish Mash est une omelette 3 ufs mélangé avec énergie à la quel on incorpore: légumes (oignons, tomate, poivron), viande (bacon, jambon,salami et bologne) et \"fromage jaune\"!  ATTENTION plus de 2000 calories avec les patates \"rissolées\", toast et la confiture. Meilleur rapport colestérol / $ de MTL garantie.  À chaque bouché j'ai l'impression de sentir mes artères se bloquer. Le Cosmos offre un choix de 6 pains allant du pain blanc au pain russe noir. Tous ce plaisir pour seulement 9$ taxe incluse. Le menu offre aussi des déjeuners clasiques, sandwich déjeuner (un autre clasique le Création), BLT, hamburger (aussi offert en version déjeuner avec un uf dessus), hamburger steak... mais pas de poutines...  ils n'ont pas de friteuse... une chance :) car il n'y a pas d'hopital dans le coin.     J'y retourne pour le Mish Mash et les hamburgers bien gras. Pour digèrer une marche rapide d'une heure m'est nécessaire.  C'est un endroit incroyable et unique tenu par des gens sympatiques et expressifs. Mais vu la teneur élevé en colestérol la modération à bien meilleur goût :))              Pour ceux que ça intéresse !! Le fondateur du restaurant Tony Koulakis est le personnage principal du documentaire  \"Man of Grease\" (2000 , 50m). Il est maintenant disponible en DVD.  Le réalisateur Ezra Soiferman après nous avoir présenté Tony, son entourage, son resto et quelques habitués; accompagne Tony lors  d'un voyage en Crète (ou il est né) à l'aube de sa refaite. Ses premières véritable vacances depuis  qu'il a ouverte le Cosmos en 1967. Si vous avez la chance ne manquez pas se documentaire très divertissant, Tony est tout qu'un personnage.... Il y a une bande annonce sur Vimeo :))  vimeo.com/29917451"}
{"text":"Quelle aventure le Cosmos Snack Bar! À la recommandation générale via Talk, je me suis rendue avec une amie au Cosmos sans lire les commentaires de Yelp. Je tenais juste à m'imprégner de l'expérience sans aucune influence. Et bien, cet endroit mythique de NDG est assez petit, à la bonne franquette, on est quasiment comme à la maison. J'ai choisi un mismatch, un petit, avec un pain Challah. Super bon! Mais vive les calories! La serveuse était assez direct et avait un bon franc parlé, je présume que cela devait faire parti du \"show\". Je crois qu'on est arrivées à 11h30 au bon moment pour éviter une petite foule.  Pour une entrée en matière de visite du Quartier NDG, c'est assez brut! Mais cela m'a plue. Par contre, il pourrait au moins nettoyer les tables, j'avais les avant-bras englués de confiture et de graisse sur le comptoir. Ça parcontre c'est pas super top. L'aventure NDG continue. À suivre!"}
{"text":"What a hidden jewel ! The service was friendly to us tourists, the locals chatted us up and the food was fantastic! The hash browns did not disappoint! A very small peek into the local flair of Montreal!"}
{"text":"This place has been around since the last millennium so there's nothing I can write here that hasn't been written before; but write I will, to add to the chorus of fan's voices. What you can get at Cosmo's is the type of breakfast that only your hungover roommate could conjure. Imagine a plate of protein, carbs, and just the right amount of grease served by the kindest and unjudgiest crew of two mother-figures. Now, shoulder to shoulder with any number of down-home characters dig in to the most unpretentious breakfast you're likely to ever have. This breakfast is so solid and satisfying that you leave the counter ready to face an intense day of mountain-climbing, or brick-laying, or deer-hunting. But first; time for a nap. I had the \"Small Mish, no onions\", bottomless coffee and childhood-summoning white toast with margarine as my second breakfast and my satisfied grin and I are ready to coast into the weekend. Five stars; not because they serve Michelin Star breakfasts, but for the anachronistic goodness and unexpected camaraderie of the place. Go. Meet your neighbours. Break some bread with them. Enjoy!  Oh, and if you're really lucky or nice you might get some Bowmore Marmalade for your toast like one guy I saw or you might even get offered a post breakfast homemade cookie."}
{"text":"We were visiting montreal from vancouver and my friend did some digging up on reddit and found that this was a local favourite. Its a small room and we sat at the bar for some food. found some great english speaking people we could chit chat with.  Great food, great service and a great experience!  would go again"}
{"text":"If you are in montreal and want to try an old school breakfast diner  than this is the place to visit."}
{"text":"Simple, pero muy delicioso.  El sándwich con tocino, huevo, salami y queso, una verdadera delicia."}
{"text":"I love these kinds of breakfasts places, and I'm glad to see this one is still around. When we walked in the locals eating knew right away we were first timers. The cook/waitress/hostess asked us what we wanted with a smile on her face.  This no-frills place has limited seating but the food is amazing. The best hash browns I've ever had in my life and it was so cheap, I was amazed. Go here for a quick breakfast but if you get a seat at the counter stay for some lovely conversation with the employees. They put a smile on my face and made my tummy very happy."}
{"text":"Be prepared to step back in time when you walk into the Cosmos diner. There are eight stools surrounding the grill. Unless you visit during warmer times when the patio tables are set up, these precious stools are your only tickets to an amazing experience!   Their menu is small, but packs a punch. You can choose eggs any style and of course bacon, sausage or ham, toast, and the best home fries in Montreal.   Try their signature \"Mish Mash\" a collection of eggs, potatoes, red peppers, pepperoni bacon, sausage, ham, salami, tomato, onion, and cheese. It's a Montreal legend. They have also been featured in a documentary called \"Man of Grease\".   Depending on how early you arrive, expect a line-up of locals waiting for one of the eight seats. Fortunately the service is fast and super-friendly.   What made the experience next level, were the people we met. We were from Toronto and everyone there were lifelong Montrealers, but on this day, it didn't matter.  The conversation was fun and unforgettable!"}
{"text":"Cosmos is what it is ! and that will never change, besides, who in their right mind would ever want such a dastardly thing ever to occur on this earth. Yes, ladies and gentleman of the jury, Cosmos is an unchanging vegetarian-friendly Montréal institution. Situated in the leafy westside down-home and salt-of-the-earth West-of-the-Main borough of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce (in N.-D.-G. we call it NDG, No Damn Good, D.G. or the simple classic -- The Deeg) this is where hyphenations got their big break in the 1960s! Once upon a time during an unseasonably warm November all the way back in Nineteen-Seventy-something ...  some strange Greek gentleman called Tony with a penchant for flicking cigarette ash into eggs on a griddle opened up a hole-in-the-wall and the rest, as they say, is history. Yes, indeed, the late and great Tony (R.I.P.) is, was and forever will be -- the man of grease as the eponymous documentary film succinctly depicts. Cosmos has, since time immemorial, been a godsend haven and sanctuary to those hungry, huddled and hungover masses. Cosmos has been a place where anybody is somebody and you're always welcomed even if you're a tad short or light in the pocket. Yes, folks, Cosmos is, indeed, the great equaliser! It doesn't matter if you're racing down the mountain from your lofty abode in Upper Westmount like a bat out of hell in your suped-up Rolls-Royce or if you're walking up the hill from below the wrong side of the tracks in Saint-Henri with your shopping cart and German Shepard in tow; you're both equally held in the same esteem (or lack thereof when it's busy) here and it's first come, first served. It doesn't matter if you come from all the way in the middle of Timbuktu on the West Island (wherever that happens to be) or if you call Hochelaga-Maisonneuve home -- at Cosmos if you're here then damn straight you're maître chez nous too! You'll here that sizzle of that griddle all the same, you'll smell the strange and exotic incense that is the intoxicating grease smoke, you'll hear a strange and delirious man repeatedly reassuring himself with the Cosmos mantra that, yes, he is indeed -- the best. \"I'm the best; I'm the best.\" It actually becomes true if you say it enough times; for reals. It's true too -- he is the best -- and you are too, fo'sho! Take a stool, sit down, set up shoppe, let someone pour you a cuppa Giuseppe, read Le Devoir or The Gazette and relax. You order yourself a beautiful veggie Creation or a vegetarian omelette or a veggie Mish-mash with Black Russian or Challah toast, side of potatoes and a poached egg and you really will be the best. On a side note: I'm a born and bred dyed-in-the-wool-blue-blooded-as-the-Saint-Laurent Québécois so therefore as a casual dairy industry protectionist and as someone with taste and also as a fellow with working taste buds -- I'm not the biggest fan of margarine (yes, I can believe it's not butter and in fact I didn't believe it was butter for a God damned second) so I like to BYOB -- bring my own butter, that is. Yes, as crazy crazy hardcore insane as this craziness may sound, I do, in fact, bring my own butter and it is well worth it to portage that stick of golden butter in your pocket and smuggle it into Cosmos. Hand it discretely to your gracious host and taste the difference it makes. Yes, with real butter being used to make your Cosmos breakfast even more authentic, you really are the best and you really can taste the rainbow. Much love. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been going there about 38 years.  Great funky all day breakfast.  Nick and his sister Nicky."}
{"text":"Coming here is like making an appearance in someone else's tv show. It's got it's own cast of regulars and a way of life. You either \"get it\" or you'll wonder how you made your way here."}
{"text":"Stumbling out of the afterparty and need bacon & eggs?   Time for a greasy spoon breakfast, but not every place will qualify as a greasy spoon.    Hang on to your hangover, walk into Cosmos and take stock.....  Overcrowded?    Check. Kind of grimy?   Check. As you walk in, can you hear everyone's arteries hardening from all the grease?   Check. Does everyone seem to know each other?    Check. Family working behind the counter and grill?    Check. Do the seats look like they've been through a zombie invasion?   Check.  Ok, this place is perfect. No matter what you order, your breakfast will be inexpensive, comprised of at least 4,000 calories and will make you really, really happy. The mishmash and the potatoes are stuff of legend, so is the Creation breakfast sandwich.    If you can't decide or your eyes are too blurry to read the menu, just order whatever the person next to you has - it's honest, greasy, amazing food. Your stomach will be bursting when you leave, but on the upside.....your hangover will be gone  :-)"}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town... and maybe the best I ever had.  This place comes highly recommended if you have a healthy appetite... not if you're trying to lead a healthy lifestyle.  I was lucky to have a friend who owned a car when I went to school in Montreal and we would come here at least once a month.  The place is tiny and you smelled like it as you left but the breakfast was the delicious. I tried many of the items on the menu on their own and they are known for their creation (which I probably ordered the most). If you're a first timer, a bit greedy and want to try many of the menu items, who can go for the mishmash which is a bit of everything on the menu. Interesting fact... the mishmash is extra delicious when consumed later as a leftover - I think due to the time given for the grease to marinate.  I can tell you more about their delicious home fries and extensive selection of breads but I'd rather you go and try it yourself... if your diet will allow."}
{"text":"This is the ultimate greasy spoon indeed. Came here on recommendation from some old friends in Montreal and they did not disappoint!  It's literally a greasy spoon diner/cafe, so if you're expecting anything else or an experience beyond that, you're going to be heavily disappointed.  Prices are great and the food really hits the spot. Probably even more so if you come here the morning after a night of heavy drinking.  It's tiny so getting a seat can be difficult, but they move fast so you don't have to wait long if it's a full house.  Service is direct (some might find it blunt) but it is friendly.  Food is delicious and the overall vibe is just perfect for grabbing some coffee and a delicious omelette to get the day started."}
{"text":"Good small place, French toasts are tasty, the mish mash is delicious, owner is very kind, price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Friendly, fast (when I was there) and decent greasy spoon.  Love the ladies cooking up breakfast on weekday mornings!"}
{"text":"Just a forewarning if you are interested in coming here: If you don't have a particular craving for greasy, stick-to-your-ribs breakfast fare that would be something that only your grandma would allow you to eat (and some more), then don't come to this spot. Cosmos is a Montréal institution that is notorious for foods akin to that description, but the potential heart attack that one may get as a result of consuming them is definitely worth it. Combined with the genuine friendliness of the people working behind the counter and loyal customers who go there nearly every morning, it really does feel like the ideal Americana-style suburban neighborhood diner where everyone knows your face and are willing to strike up conversations on a whim.  After taking a stool at the counter, I ordered a mish mash which came with fried potatoes and a choice of bread (out of ??? types - I chose challah). It's basically a behemoth six egg omelet that comes with cheddar cheese, sausage, ham, tomatoes, and a bunch of other things that I forgot. You can see them cooking everything (minus the bread) with lots of grease on the grill - which could be either a plus or a minus depending on whether the satisfaction of knowing how your food is made can override the impending artery-busting doom. They offer you complimentary coffee to go along with it, which surprisingly didn't taste that bad (?) or maybe it was just the atmosphere and the fact that I was starving.  In the simplest of terms, the omelet tasted extremely comforting and was very filling; they definitely do not take it slow on the meat and whatnot. Overall, it was very balanced and the idea of putting all of these different breakfast-like foods together made it very delicious in a non-pretentious way. The potatoes were perfectly crisp and fit the stereotypical image of what foreigners presume Americans to eat, which also reminded me a lot of home and the diners I used to go to on the occasional and rare weekend brunch. The bread was just that - toasted and buttered and served just like how your normal breakfast places serve it. After downing everything, I was offered a free peanut butter chocolate chip cookie - a perfect way to end an extremely fulfilling meal.  Go to Cosmos if you want home-cooked diner breakfast food that is very cheap and will fill your stomach up as well as for the friendly people. If you live in the NDG area, it's definitely a place that you could go to often and where you'll be treated like family."}
{"text":"Cant believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. Born and raised in Montreal this was always the go to breakfast spot if you were in need of a good stick to the ribs breakfast. This greecey spoon is the home of the famous MishMash, Creation and marvelous hashbrowns."}
{"text":"The ultimate expression of the \"hangover food\" genre, as that appeared to be the motive of most of the people who came in while I was downing the best breakfast ever. You can't be afraid to talk to the nice ladies behind the counter, and because there are only a few stools and they're all crammed together at the counter, you are pretty much guaranteed to make friends if you allow yourself to engage in the constant smack-talking. I must have tipped these guys like 30% in the end just because I got such a kick out of them. I can't speak on the quality of the signature MishMash, but the big meat-and-eggs-and-toast-etc. platter I ordered was impeccable, and I credit it for the success of the 18-hour study marathon that followed. I'm coming back as much as I can afford to."}
{"text":"This place takes the name greasy spoon to heart. I could literally feel my arteries clogging after eating a small mish mosh. It was all pretty burnt and unbelievably oily... it still pains me a full 24 hours after ingestion. However the cook is a zany dude and they give you free coffee. Overall it's not bad, I just would get much, much less food the next time."}
{"text":"I have been one of those: so hungover you crave the dim greasy breakfast bar, the cynical banter, the mad pile of grease that you don't ask questions about, you just eat and let it do it's thing to you, have it's way with you, cure what ails you. Not for everyone, but definitely for me on days like these."}
{"text":"Cosmo's is a tasty and cheap breakfast, but damn does it take long. I love going to cosmos for a greasy breakfast but it's tiring to have to set aside 2 hours because I don't know how long it will take for me to get my food. If you're thinking quick breakfast, you're at the wrong place. Once the food is at your table, you're set, but getting it in front of you can be an issue..."}
{"text":"Hole in the wall with big portions of good greasy breakfast food for fairly cheap price.  The food really hits the spot as a post drinking morning hangover cure.  I recommend the MishMash omlette, which apparently is famous around here.  Warning: it can get super crowded, and seating is pretty limited."}
{"text":"The absolute best breakfast in town. I ate here almost every Saturday for about 8+ years, starting in High School and Continuing to whenever I am back in town. This review will not even begin to give them the praise they deserve, and I could spend hours on all the Cosmo related stories.  Little Background: Cosmo was started over 35 years ago by Tony Koulakis. The restaurant is literally a hole in the wall with 11 stools jammed around a tiny counter. The restaurant has been almost 100% run, with Tony and his children behind the counter, with the occasional cousin or relative stepping in.  In the summer they take over the front of the restaurant and have 3-4 tables, which are always packed.  They even made a documentary called \"Man of Grease\" that was quite popular in Montreal. This is one of the few restaurants I can proudly  claim to have eaten at multiple times in the same day. The walls are covered with bills from all over the world, and sketches and cartoons of those that work and have worked there.  The food is mostly breakfast, with huge portions and signature dishes:  - The \"Creation\" Sandwich, a bacon, egg, salami lettuce, tomato and cheese monstrosity - The \"MishMash\" omelet. Bacon, eggs, ham, sausage, salami, tomatoes, onions and cheese all fried in butter - 1800 Calories as per chemical analysis. - The \"Good Morning' Burger: A hamburger with a fried egg on top  I have eaten here at one point or another with every single one of my friends, and is as part of my memories of Montreal as the Montreal Canadiens hockey team. I can go back any time and Nicky, Tony's daughter will always remember us.  Memories:  - It used to be a smoking restaurant, so 4 stools were designated \"non-smoking stools\" lol - Tony used to smoke while cooking - Prices were pretty variable and Tony would round stuff up or down randomly - Customers can be expected to run across the street for fresh milk - Taking up ALL the stools with just friends  Do yourself a favor and check it out, but try going during the week if you want to avoid the weekend madness!"}
{"text":"This has become by far my favorite breakfast place in Montreal. Pop in when it's not busy. Order a creation sandwich, they're so yummy and light.   At first I felt this place was a bit standoffish but after visiting the vibe from the staff/people is so welcoming and just feels lovely. Especially when hungover and anxious and tired etc haha..   But make sure to go on a day when it's empty. Then you get the attention and love. Weekends is a bit nuts and chaotic."}
{"text":"Cosmos is one of NDG's most famous restaurants and it is known for being one of the best greasy spoons in the area.  Located at 5843 Sherbrooke O, it is right down my street however, it took me five years to FINALLY see why it is such a popular spot.  It is a very small space which seats about 11 people.  I was lucky to have my friend save me a spot because about five minutes after I got there, all of the seats were taken and people were standing in a line that went out of the building.  You can also sit at the few tables they have set up outside.  The Creation My friend and I both got \"The Creation\" sandwich which consists of an egg, salami, lettuce, tomato and cheese.  It was absolutely delicious.  Cosmos has any type of bread you would like- The Globe and Mail stated \" [Cosmos] offered 15 types of bread. It was once estimated that Mr. Koulakis went through 25 loaves of rye, kimmel and black Russian bread a day, and fried 20 dozen eggs and 25 pounds of bacon every day, too.\"  The service is VERY fast.  The Creation also comes with a side of hash brown potatoes which are equally as delicious.  When I first saw the Creation, I thought it was small and that it was impossible for me to be full from just one but I was wrong.  I was happily surprised at how satisfied I felt.  Cosmos is also known for their \"MishMash\" omelette which is bacon, four eggs, ham, sausage, salami, tomatoes, onions and cheese, all fried in margarine.  I will definitely be going back to try it.  Cosmos is so well known, that Ezra Soiferman did a documentary on the late Tony Koulakis called \"Man of Grease\".  To watch the trailer, please watch it on Vimeo.   The famous Epic Meal Time guys even stopped by Cosmos to make a burger!  Watch the video on youtube or read The Gazette's article.  June 22 of this year will mark the two year anniversary of Tony's death. The events surrounding his homicide made numerous headlines along with questions about whether or not the restaurant would ever reopen.  However, there was no way his family members would allow the restaurant to close after Tony dedicated over 30 years of his life to the business.   I wish I had gone to Cosmos when Tony was still around- he seemed like a very happy, friendly and passionate person.  According to The Globe and Mail, \"Meantime, neighbourhood homeless people, or those just down and out, were often treated to free meals, or were told to come back later. At the end of each day, leftovers were handed out, given to food banks or dumped on the forest floor near his cottage for the animals. \"He used to say to me it was a sin to throw away food,\" Mr. DiMonte said.\"    I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone in the NDG area.  One customer stated on the resto's official Facebook Page \"Greatest breakfast food ever. I drive 10hrs 3x a year for it.\" -Mike Paddon  It is open from 7AM- 5PM every day.  To contact them, call (514) 486-3814."}
{"text":"An 11 seat diner, luckily I and my guests arrived when we did because latecomers will stand around and wait for a seat. Chef/owner is fun to watch while you sip on constantly refilled coffee. I had the Creation which is a breakfast sandwich, and chef will get back to you on bread options when he's about to toast it. Had egg bread. Chef and younger girl who came in to sue chef bickered back and forth whilst they multi-tasked on everyone's orders. Lots of regulars. THE greasy spoon. Definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Cosmo's is an institution here in Montreal yet despite being a lifelong Montrealer I only recently tried this famous restaurant.  It has been around about 40 years and is known for its cheap, greasy breakfasts.  It is really tiny, seating only 11 people and everyone sits at the counter so it is best if you come with one other person max.  The atmosphere is that of your friendly, neighbourhood greasy spoon and it has loads of character to it.  Everyone is packed in at the counter and it is quite common for everyone to end up talking to each other at some point or another.  This ambiance was what I liked most about Cosmos.  It makes it feel so welcoming and just a nice place to sit and enjoy a meal.  It seems like they also get quite a few regulars here because the staff seemed to know some of the customers by name.  The menu is what you would expect from a greasy spoon (bacon and eggs, sandwiches, burgers, etc).  They are famous for the Mish Mash, which is a special omelet containing eggs, ham, bacon, salami, tomato, onions and cheese, and the Creation. I decided on the Bagellah for $8.  This creation consisted of eggs, bacon and cheese served on top of a Montreal-style bagel.  This was excellent and the bacon was really crispy.  It was served with a generous portion of hash browns which were awesome and well-seasoned.  The price was also very reasonable and included coffee.  At one point the waitress also offered everyone in the restaurant homemade peanut butter and chocolate chip cookies on the house.  This was really appreciated and they were very good!  Any Montrealer should definitely hit up Cosmos when they get the chance.  It is easy to see why it has become such an institution here.  The unique atmosphere and cheap, greasy food make for an excellent experience."}
{"text":"This was the first place I went to when I landed in Montreal on Monday. Lots of street parking nearby.  Now down to the food, I ordered their famous mish mash and Nick the owner made it, it is a mix of bacon, salami, ham sausages, cheese, peppers and onions with a side of homefries and toast. All I can say it is delicious! Very greasy, but hey its a greasy spoon so its expected. Coffee and tea was included. Portions were huge and after eating at cosmos I didn't have to eat until dinner time.   The Atmosphere was great, the owner will talk to you about anything, and sometimes the conversation would turn from sports to a tale of a missing wild animal.  Overall I would definitely come back again and try their other items like the \"Creation\""}
{"text":"THE classic Montreal greasy spoon.  Highlights include the Mish-Mash, an ungodly combination of eggs, potatoes, cheese, and charcuterie of all kinds that's become a true Montreal icon (often imitated, never matched), and the Creation, which is my pick for the very best breakfast sandwich in town (there's not much competition in this department, but with eggs, bacon, fried bologna, lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise all wrapped up into one package, this sandwich is a keeper).  Also:  the best counter banter/repartee in Montreal."}
{"text":"Best way to describe it is comfort food. From the creation and taters to the mishmash and let's not forget the burgers. The service is extremely entertaining and very friendly. Tony did a great job and  sure he's proud to know Nick is holding Down the fort."}
{"text":"Great place. Fast serving, yummy food. Good atmosphere. Good value."}
{"text":"I grew up near this place. The food was never great but we went in because there was a pile of comics on the end of the counter for kids to read because the NDG Paperback was next store. From what I remember 30Yrs ago was that they made their living fronting all the residents of halfway houses (  A big N.D.G. industry ) meals until their welfare checks arrived. At some point in the 80's some of my  'Rich'  friends from Hampstead & Cote-St-Luc decided it was a cool place to slum it on Sundays for Brunch and the place has been going like gangbusters ever since. WTF!?!"}
{"text":"The best mish mash in the world and maybe even the galaxy. Ask for the potatoes to be cooked crispy on grill and add peanut butter on the side and heaven is on your plate."}
{"text":"Really small old place with nice burgers etc , informal and gentle service. Just a few spots in winter to sit down but a little terrasse in summer."}
{"text":"Chaotic, not very clean and food mediocre. Not as great as the 'hype', maybe it used to be a great place that everyone seems to remember but not worth it now."}
