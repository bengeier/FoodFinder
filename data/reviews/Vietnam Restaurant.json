{"text":"I work nearby, and occasionally come here with coworkers or order takeout. I tend to stick to the vegetarian dishes, which are well priced and filling. I had the meat dishes on several occasions and they are good quality as well. I do find some of the dishes to be on the greasy side, but the pho is excellent. And so is the vietnamese coffee."}
{"text":"This place is a true dive. One of those where you only know it's there, if you know it's there - classic hidden gem. Even their outdoor signage is minimal. The bottom floor is also an abandoned space so I wouldn't be surprised if people had no idea this place even existed.

Anyways, the food here is always super delicious and I have yet to be let down. I usually get the beef satay pho or combo vermicelli plate with spring rolls, and BBQ beef, chicken, and shrimp. I usually struggle in picking. I love a good soup but the BBQ flavour of the meats is great.

The owner is also a super friendly guy. He's always up for making conversation, and is very accommodating if you have any issues; which I never do, but once a friend's soup was too spicy because he's an amateur. Compare this to Lotus which has super good visibility, but hit or miss food and awful service.

Definitely recommend this place. There's also plenty of space and have never had to wait for a table, which is probably because people don't know it's there."}
{"text":"Excellent food, service, and atmosphere. Every time we walk in for lunch we are warmly greeted with tea and water as we look over the menu. The Pho has an authentic tasting seasoned broth with the perfect amount of spice. We always leave smiling, with full bellies having been very satisfied with the meal."}
{"text":"This little Vietnamese restaurant is tucked away in an aging building near the Stampede grounds. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but you'll find a bright and spacious interior with plenty of tables and traditional Vietnamese restaurant decor. The food here is good, but what really keeps me coming back here is the service. 

When you arrive, you are met by a dapper, aging gentleman who will show you to your table, appearing again within the minute with a pot full of warm green tea and glasses of fresh ice water. How's that for a great start, tea and water without having to ask!  

The service is quick - which is pretty consistent among Vietnamese restaurants. They offer a wide selection of very reasonably-priced choices, sure to please even the pickiest of customers. There are plenty of tables so it is almost always possible to be seated right away. 

I definitely recommend a visit to Vietnam!

{"text":"I came here on the way to the Calgary vs. Jets game. The first thing I noticed was that we were seated immediately. The second thing I noticed was the slightly too high volume of music. Now, I love cultural diversity, and the Vietnamese music they had on was quite touching and unique to listen to, but when I find myself unable to concentrate on my family's shallow conversation, there's a problem. When my wonton soup arrived, I noticed the bowl was barely half full, and everyone had a lot more food than I did. My soup was bland, not much flavour, but it was acceptable. I suppose that's a tradeoff for the INCREDIBLY fast service (less than 5 minutes for food). In the end, this was an interesting choice, and the food was food. Nothing better, nothing more. If you have better places to go, choose them, but consider this restaurant as a backup."}
{"text":"This is my least favourite Vietnamese food in Calgary so far, and Vietnamese has been one of my main food groups in the few months that I've been here.

My friend and I walked over to get some takeaway on a lazy weekday afternoon, and neither of us enjoyed the food. I had one of their chicken vermicelli dishes and I only got about 1/3 of the way through and ended up throwing the rest away (which is very unlike me!), mostly because the chicken wasn't very good quality. The spring rolls that came with it were fine.. but they are also pretty hard to get wrong."}
{"text":"Much improved! 

I wrote a review several years ago after ordering take out. While taking the elevator to my place, a man who identified himself as the owner was looking at condos and asked my option of the building, Given he was so nice, I decided to give Vietnam a second chance. Since my first visit, Vietnam has evolved into a mature and reliable Pho for the Victoria Park area. I've tried a ton of dishes and all were fresh, hot and tasty! Vietnam beats out the other Pho joints in the area and I'd recommend for a quick and reliable bite.

Unless you're going to a game and don't mind the atmosphere, take out is my recommendation!"}
{"text":"Really nice service.  Food comes out quick.  Plenty of good items to choose from

{"text":"We happened across this place only because we wanted Vietnamese & it was downtown with available parking.  

It doesn't look like much from outside, but when you get inside it is surprisingly bright  and the tables aren't too close together as with many Vietnamese 'lunch' restaurants.  I know most don't frequent these similar establishments for their ambient restaurants, but I don't like bumping elbows with the stranger at the next table as I eat. 

I was happy to see the tea was included as we were seated.  We only had shrimp rolls and charbroiled chicken and pork w/ vermicelli, but our food came quickly - rolls first then noodles soon after.  The portions were generous and we were outta there with full bellies in less than 40 minutes!"}
{"text":"The quality has swung back and forth here over the past fifteen years, and it was better way back then, but I still enjoy it.  The vermicelli w/ spring rolls dish, mixed with that orange sauce that comes with it, can be crazy delicious.  But if someone gives this place a 3 instead of a 4, I understand. It's not going to blow you away, I have just had a lot of good times here.

Sometimes the service is great and sometimes not so much.  The best is when you get the kind man who sets down your pop can and glass and then spends a moment aligning them.

Fun fact: This place used to be connected by a covered walkway to the house across the parking lot and that added to the awesomeness, but that got torn down."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time Tuesday 9/16.  Ordered the fried pot stickers and pork spring rolls to start.  Pot stickers and plum sauce were awesome. Rolls were alright. Main course was beef and beef ball soup for me. Very good and a lot of food. My colleague had the pork trifecta and it was also good. Would definitely be back - especially for the personable, funny and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Grossest grey coloured ginger beef I've ever seen. The spring rolls had dirty sprouts inside. I'll try to attach the picture. I was starving but after waiting for its delivery I threw it out. I tried it even though it looked repulsive. It tasted just how it looks."}
{"text":"The Vietnam Restaurant is a small, but spacious spot right on the edge of the Stampede grounds. I have no idea how long this has existed, but I do know why it is still here. 

This is a classic example of a Vietnamese quality spot. The decor is old and dated, advertising poor and the location is left to be desired. This is the key ingredients in making the perfect noodle bowl! The vermicelli is a bucket list meal to eat in Calgary, and their prices are more than reasonable!

There is ample parking from the 12 avenue entrance and u will definitely be a regular here during stampede week when I have had my fill of need on a bun and footlong corn dogs."}
{"text":"Consistent and good value, Vietnam Restaurant has kept me coming back for years and years! The food is fairly simple and always good, though it's nothing spectacular that would send it to 5 stars.  The atmosphere is a bit run down, though meticulously kept. The service, however, is outstanding! 

The staff are always friendly, professional, and highly efficient. It's easy to have a quick, affordable meal here of you're on a tight timeline. This includes lunch time. 

This is one of my spots for a comfort-food meal."}
{"text":"The pho's doesn't stand out in quality.  Server spilled hot soup on me and wasn't apologetic at all, instead cracked a macho joke."}
{"text":"I like this restaurant especially the Curry Chicken soup and the spring rolls.  They changed ownership lately but the food is still good."}
