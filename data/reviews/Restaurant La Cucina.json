{"text":"thought it would be good to have a nice dinner here in the outside patio and i havent had italian in a long time.

overall: mediocre tasting experience, but nice outdoor atmosphere.

the caprese salad was slapped together.
slices of tomato, very small piece of mozzarella and basil. 
wasn't seasoned right.
meek. very eh.

i ordered the veal pasta, which turned out to be pretty good. i typically don't eat veal, but this dish was decent and it prevented me to give this place a 2.5 stars.

i just couldnt believe how you can mess up a caprese salad and make it so blah.
