{"text":"Decided to try this place out finally (Friday 5/12/17) and was disappointed... Came here for some drinks and to play a little. Not too many people inside which was nice for a Friday night, we were able to get 2 machines next to each other. The inside was nice and had a good feel too it. I would live to try the food but I don't think I'll be coming back. The bartender gave us no attention at all. I waited almost 15 minutes to get my second beer, And I was playing too! Once we decided to cash out we were still charged for all of our drinks (2 beers and 1 cocktail) we both were playing too. We also noticed another couple come in and sit at a table and nobody walked up and helped them at all for at least 10-15 minutes. Pretty much the service here is horrible. I'm a bartender and my wife is a waitress so I understand how it is sometimes but when it's not busy there is no reason why anyone should be waiting for a beer especially when we are there to spend money"}
{"text":"All the bars in town, I will never return here.  First time I finally win some money and I don't have to insert mitre than 20.00. And I get a bill for my 4 of 5 beers because I didn't loose.  To many bars in town I can give my business to.  Shame on you PTs.  I will not be back and will spread the word.  I also was denied card of the day. I was told they don't have.  Found out I was lied to. And the reason I won was 3. 4 of a kinds."}
{"text":"This is definitely not a gaming bar.  My husband and I played more than enough to have our drinks comped at ANY other place in town. But they still charge us for our drinks.  When we discussed this with the manger, Stephanie. She changed the story multiples time with excuses of why we where being charged, including she couldn't see our play. She reluctantly agreed to take one beer off and when she came back with our check it was still on there.  Stephanie's policy is clearly that the customer is always wrong. Beautiful bar, terrible customer service."}
{"text":"great food ,drinks, samantha was an excellent waitress great personality ,one of the best dining experiences ive had while living here and ive had some real bad ones.i would recomend this place to everyone ..enjoy it.."}
{"text":"Horrible service. Went there yesterday for Super Bowl with my husband. Breanna was our server. As often as we go there, this was the worst service. She checked on us once throughout the entire game. We had to flag her down each time we needed anything. We ordered a total of 8 drinks, which 2 were from initial order, remainder were from us flagging her down. Will refuse to have her as our server again."}
{"text":"Just left this place.  Horrible service: the bartender that's on duty right now is the worst I've ever encountered. What a tool bag! This place was the spot my friend and I usually go to. Service is pretty good. So I took my mom here.  We walked in. No one greeted us. So we chose a table.  Sat there for ten minutes... NOTHING.  I finally walked up to the bartender, and asked if the area we sat at was open. This douche bag then replies with.. \" uh no, there's no server and handed me two menus\" ... If that was the case, he should have said, hey ladies that area is closed.   If I didn't walk up to him and asked him, we would have just sat there..  So thank you Douchebag for ruining our visit. Worst service ever! Tall, white, male, bald."}
{"text":"Awesome looking place! Stopped in for breakfast the other day and was amazed at the price and food. Waiters were super friendly and accommodating. Really clean and chill"}
{"text":"This is the most beautiful PT's in town. Food is great, bar has great selection of drinks but the staff are slow and inattentive. They are often going missing in the back of the house for extended periods of time. I've even seen people pour their own drinks!!"}
{"text":"Very bad experience...  As we walked in I noticed how empty the place was, you would think they'd be happy to see some customers.... nope! The 2 bartenders and 2 waitresses were  just  too busy talking to each other to even notice us. After a few minutes, I had to ask at the bar if they were even serving anyone.  I was told to sit anywhere and one of the waitresses will get us some menus, so we did. I know the waitress saw me asking at the bar, so she knew we were there.   We sat down patiently and waited for a good 10 minutes,  we were able to see the 2 waitress chatting to each other at the service station very happy.  So we decided that it wasn't worth ruining our night with the horrible service we knew was coming. so we did the smart thing, we went  to a more professional place. it worked cause we ended up having a great time, and a wonderful service ."}
{"text":"Great food, great drinks, great service. Cheap football specials too. If coming in the day, would recommend sitting at a table instead of the bar. Quicker service and a better view of the tvs"}
{"text":"Went in Saturday morning at 7am July 16th Chris was our bartender. He was very informative about the specials and happy hours even suggesting yummy breakfast cocktails. I can't believe how amazing this place looks after the remodel. Breakfast was good and I even won a little money. This is will be my Saturday morning spot!"}
{"text":"Walked in and sat down in I guess the \"VIP\" room which was wide open. After about 5 minutes a waitress came in and took our order. Brought menus and beer that was cold  we asked if they could possibly change the channel she came back and told us the manager said we could not sit in that room. So we moved to the bar and then waited about 10 minutes b4 we asked if anyone was working. Needless to say there was 3 or 4 people behind the bar with about 3 people in the bar the bartender said in a pissy tone yes I will be right there. Ordered a couple fireball shots and they were luke warm. Talked with the manager and she didn't really seem to care much. She then right in front of us asked the bartender what happened and they talked for a minute and then chilled a shot. The female manager has no idea what the Vip room is for or how it works. Do not recommend coming here for any reason."}
{"text":"What great service tonight with the bartenders !!!! Thank You PT's for having real Bartenders tonight for Thursday night football !!!!!!"}
{"text":"I just don't understand how I can spend $250+ playing poker and they wouldn't comp a $10 sandwich - they did however \"take care of the Iced Tea\"  - really??? The bartender was okay and food was okay - but won't go back.  I prefer places where my hard earned money is appreciated - I'm not expecting a lot but this was just wrong."}
{"text":"Sarah, Sarafina and Sam are the best! We get the best service when they are taking care of the place! Sarah always makes sure we have what we need and has exceptional customer service."}
{"text":"Yup, as reviews say. Service was terrible. Got here a little after 5 on a Saturday night...one bartender for the whole joint. Packed bar seats and restaurant half full. No bueno. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Spencer is the best!! He knows exactly what I want when I walk in the door. I always bring new people to the bar and treats them like they've been coming in forever. Foods great, drinks are great and so is the staff :) the PTs on Maryland is the spot to be"}
{"text":"My time at pts was very pleasurable. My host Claudia was very, professional and has a very good attitude and moves fast and efficient. I will be back with my friends. Thank you for a wonderful time."}
{"text":"Amazing service !!!!! Dave and Mia are the best bartenders in Vegas!! Everything else is a second thought when the service is excellent."}
{"text":"This pts is now one of my ATF locations. Obviously they got a real cook or should say more like a chief back there the food has never been better here point blank. Yesterday we went in drinks and pizza etc and the best pizza came out I've had in years not kidding my friends food was a 5 star restaurant dish. Pleasantly surprised here(not regular pts food of normmal, was better) I asked who? they said Scott so I gave waitress a 20 to give him. I highly respect ones who cook my food good! Other staff your typical bar staff. This pts offers a bigger environment with a outside patio seating to eat and spacious unlike most that are smaller. Definitely be back to this one and order if the new guy's working."}
{"text":"We went last night for a friend's going away party, we had a party of 25, as soon as we arrived the servers looked really mad that we had a large party, our server Monica was not very nice and she'd forget our drinks so we would go to the bar and order one and then she'd come over and yell at us for what she called \"double ordering\" while the food and beverages were adequate they have horrible customer service, we wont be returning anytime soon."}
{"text":"This place constantly demonstrates my biggest pet peeve which is having to listen to employees talk trash about fellow coworkers or complain about how much they don't like their job.  I hear enough of that where I work, I don't want to listen to it loudly being bantered at the bar by the bartender on duty and the one that is now off duty.  Waitresses there seem miserable and are either out for a smoke or head down in the phone."}
{"text":"My coworkers and I come here at least once a week. The service is usually pretty good but the atmosphere is what keeps us coming back!"}
{"text":"Ok not that I complain but ordered fajitas and they were cold as ice asked nice about getting warm food. So they were taken back and brought back warmish microwave sucked other then that the place is ok. The waitress said we used to bring em out sizzling but people complained so we don't do that any more Hmmm so bring me cold(same) food and  tell me there it's sizzling"}
{"text":"It's a nice local place with friendly staff and good food."}
{"text":"Great neighbor joint to hangout in. They are starting to add a game room on now. Shuffleboard and a pooltable so far."}
{"text":"Came in on a Thursday night with some co-workers. The venue has a cool vibe & I liked it. Unfortunately that's where it all ended. Service was horridly slow. We had a table of 5 people & she was never attentive to our table. I had given the server my credit card to close out my bill & it seriously took over 15 minutes for her to bring it back to me. I had to hunt her down. Should not have to hunt down the server for my credit card. Another co-worker had to go to the bar to pay their bill since the server was MIA even after he asked for his bill. He waited for 10-12 minutes but finally went to the bar to pay as he had to leave. I may try it for lunch to see if it's any faster but doubtful I'd go back for a time after 5pm."}
{"text":"Service sucks but the place is very cute and cozy. Love the decor! We ordered wings, extra crispy, fries and a beer. Sat at the bar and not even 5 people including us in the place and bartender (young with long dark curly hair) was nowhere to be seen. We had to track her down and ask for water. We ordered spicy wings! Why no water??? Then we had to track her down for napkins. Then yet again for a second refill of water. Then last time for another beer refill. Quiet dark atmosphere to relax and grab a beer though. We played and lost $40 in the machine. No comps for drinks either:( Our lunch cost us $75."}
{"text":"First time here, great experience. The bartending staff is really nice. Thanks Stephanie and Tiffany. Great suggestions on the menu for dinner. The \"ranch\" pizza was amazing! I'd come back here anytime and the atmosphere is really great, very warm and open with very little cigarette smoke eventhough there were smokers. The American flag mural that takes up a whole wall is impressive and very patriotic. LOVE THAT! I can't wait till a few cooler evenings come around in the fall to sit outside because the outside dinning area is very well laid  out and inviting."}
{"text":"This used to be a GREAT place when it was Roadrunner!! After work on a Saturday night I  wanted to chill with my boyfriend. We came here because it's our neighborhood pub. And for the mini bowling and happy hour. So when we got there we realized that they got rid of the little bowling lanes in the back:(!! Bummer! Ok so on to happy hour...We sat down at the bar machines and I put in $40 and started playing blackjack. We ordered 10pc wings a vodka press and a beer. Service was really slow but not terrible. The place probably had 25 ppl and there was only 1 bartender (we're in the industry so we're understanding and patient;-) When we got our bill it was $27 though?! We didn't get an itemized receipt so I'm not sure if we even got the correct bill?! I mean we only got 10pc wings, a vodka press and a beer. It was happy hour AND I was gambling!!!! I never pay for drinks when I'm at a bar gambling! So let's say I didn't get my drinks comped for gambling...happy hour prices alone must be a shitty deal if that's what it cost to drink there. We didn't want to wait for the bartender to explain the bill because like I said service was slow. Oh well, never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, cant believe it was the cantina....Unfortunately, the service gets the 1 star. Empty bottles and empty glasses means, we may want another drink. Why did it take so long to be acknowledged? Even after i cashed out my ticket...."}
{"text":"I've been to this PTs multiple times and every time I am not disappointed. Granted, it is just a local pts, but it's huge, nicely decorated, has a fire pit and outdoor seating area, tons of booths and tables with the most comfortable chairs I've ever sat in. It used to be a roadrunner, so it's different than most other pts, much bigger and nicer. The food selection is great if your looking for bar food! The only downfall is the service. It's hit or miss, sometimes the bartenders are friendly, sometimes not. It seems every time I go in theres a new bartender. Other than that, it's a great local place to chill after work and have a nice cold beer.  *Update* the last few times I've come here this year especially the service has been pretty terrible. Still come here since it's close to home and has good happy hour, but it's in serious need of some new waitresses that come to your table more than once an hour."}
{"text":"My wife and I come for breakfast about once a week. We are fortunate to have Kelsey as our server. The food is good and discounted before 10am. However, it's the great service that Kelsey provides that keeps us coming back no mater the cost. PT's is lucky to have you!"}
{"text":"These guys will make anything for you even if it's not on the menu. They actually made me a great steak sandwich, didn't even flinch about just hooked it up! Really great bartenders and waitresses."}
{"text":"Tina is the absolute best! Superb customer service every time. During the holidays you encounter a lot of Scrooge's but I always feel welcome when I come here. Thank you guys for being awesome!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible, ever since Elliot left this is a bad place. The manager upcharges you to pay for her friends. She isn't a bar tender at all. Nothing to look at and bad service. Horrible"}
{"text":"Dear Manager:  why are you ALWAYS understaffed?  I've been here 4x in the last month and each and every time it has been severely understaffed. And I mean on Weekends during football  games!!!  Today there are 40 customers  here ( I counted)  - yet only one food server  and two bartenders. Yesterday, Saturday, there was only the bartender to take care of everything.  .. Food/bar/bussing.  !!   It's complete nonsense.   Food is average- typical PTs. And the one server today is great ( thank God) .. But I have to give it 2 stars for poor management.    Beautiful building +comfy chairs= 2 stars."}
{"text":"Here is your standard Vegas chain bar with the table top gambling and the generic beer on tap.   They play great music, have comfortable chairs and booths if the bar isn't your place and it's clean.  A friend and I met there for a beer and my friend went to the bar and ordered. Instead of being given a choice of beer sizes they filled up the biggest glass they had and put it down before we could object. It would have been nice to have a choice, but not that big of a thing since we didn't mind.   There is also very little service if you don't sit at the bar. We got checked on once in the hour and a half we were there. I guess with that huge beer they figured we wouldn't need anything for awhile.  The really, really negative is that the bathrooms are total rest stop quality. They are filthy, (classy) people have written all over the walls, toilet paper and paper towels everywhere. It's just gross. I would highly recommend you avoid those if you go here.   It's not someplace I would go back to again, but I can see the appeal. I think."}
{"text":"Breakfast was good. Hash browns are crispy, bacon too, everything I expected for the price. Fairly empty at the time I went (11am), good place for a quick meal, and it had good service too. Would recommend. :)"}
{"text":"This is a nice PT's. It's got a long bar with TVs and gaming. Bartenders are generally attentive enough. Seating it somewhat limited though as the removed their dining area to make room for two billiard tables. So there's some big chairs and small tables in the bar area, along with a couple of small booths. But that's about it. There is a party room. And there's also some seating outside on the patio when the weather is nice. This is definitely one of the larger PT's locations. The servers are total hit or miss. Sometimes their great and totally attentive. Other times, you have to flag them down every time and there's lots of errors. This is probably my fav PT's to eat at. I love their Southwestern BLT and sweet potato fries. Hint: Get a side of honey mustard to dip the fries in. Overall, this is my 2nd fav PT's around town."}
{"text":"I live in the area and frequent here when I have time.  Food- Comparable to yard house and the timing is exceptional.   Service- Maddie is the go to for conversation her personality and capability to converse with all walks of life is unmatched.  Kristina- Has a feisty attitude, sexy, and really fun to talk to.  Sundays are the best!!!!!"}
{"text":"We come to this place fairly often because it's near home. So inconsistent!!! We've had great service and horrible service. Depends on who is working. Today was the second time we have had to leave because we were ignored upon arriving. A waitress who practically grunted when we asked her if anyone was sitting at the table we walked up to. I get it's Sunday and football games are on but holy crap. Say hello, or I'll be right back to take your order. Nope. She had more important things like replacing ash trays than checking to see if we wanted anything. After almost 20 minutes of being ignored (maybe 3-4 other tables at most occupied) we left.  Took our business down the street to Twin Peaks."}
{"text":"Bonless wings are my favorite here. Many different options w flavors. Great atmosphere good drinks and great happy hour"}
{"text":"Yesterday evening I hosted a going away party for my boyfriend. First off, I had reserved the outdoor patio for Saturday evening. Friday afternoon, we got a message informing us he would have to leave a day early. I went into straight panic and thought I would have to cancel the whole party. I reached out to David, the general manager and he was extremely kind, understanding and flexible. He had no problems with me moving the party same day and offering me the space. I was so relieved. When we got to the venue, just my luck, it was raining. They have cutest outdoor patio where the party was supposed to take place. The server came out to inform us that we still have that spot if we would like but they also set up the banquet room inside for our use. How perfect was that?? They totally went above and beyond to anticipate my needs. We went inside and Brittany and dezerae were our servers and they were EXCELLENT. To sum up the evening, everything went flawlessly, the food was awesome, service was top notch and my boyfriend had the best time with his friends.   Thank you pts for everything. Can't wait to host my next party there"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service by a bartender named Steve. When I first came in and gave my order he was extremely rude. Then when I walked up to ask to close out my tab he rolled his eyes and ignored me, so I stood there waiting to see if he was going to say anything eventually and never did so I walked away and told a friend of mine at our table that he needed to ask to close out the tab because the bartender obviously isn't listening to me, and then I heard 'maybe you need to shut your mouth' from Steve. So I will never be coming back."}
{"text":"Great service  Was waited on as soon as we sat down  Great food  Food came out very quick  At a very fair price  Try this place  Thank you Mo !"}
{"text":"Whaaaat?!! Is this really a P.T's? I initially questioned if a sports Bar really deserved a 5 star rating, I mean it's not a gourmet restaurant or anything but... It kinda is! The food was unique, flavorful, daring and oh-so-delicious. The artwork is AMAZING (who is this talent?!?). The decor is gorgeous (who is the Interior Designer?). Drinks are tasty- maybe a larger \"fun cocktails\" menu would be nice... ?? We've dined here twice now, once with a party of 5, the 2nd time with a party of about 12. Both times were excellent & there seemed to be a collective agreement of genuine awe & surprise at this new outstanding gem. EVERY item we got was Soooo good & gourmet, not in the weird Napa food kinda way but in the \"How did they make French-fry's this AMAZING\" kinda way. When I went with the large group to watch the game (TV's everywhere, yet still a classy joint), we ordered a ton of appetizers. Everything was unbelievably yummy down to the cole slaw on the chicken wings plate. The pizza was fantastic! We're going back tonight (two night in a row) because my Husband was so impressed with the BBQ chicken pizza our table ordered that he wants to go back to try another pizza made his way.  Even though they just opened, this place has been busy both times I've been, all-tables-full kinda busy, it seems word has spread quickly that this place is outstanding!!"}
{"text":"It's Monday at 9am and they are not open for breakfast like their sign says. \"Daily 6-10am\""}
{"text":"Currently sitting in an understaffed PT's and I can't say the experience has been great. If you are understaffed and your waitress is busy with a big party, why can I not order at the bar? I had planned on staying for a beer or two and then taking off but since your waitress is super busy I'm pretty sure I will be here for several hours and thirsty! I'm not talking thirsty for a hot babe I've just seen, I'm talking thirst for a beverage that would make a Mormon blush!! So please understand that it is a Saturday and people would like to get served quickly. Get it together PT's your server deserves better than a one night stand that doesn't get you off!!"}
{"text":"Poor service and flat beer. There are so many better places in town. When we reported our complaints to the manager, she was just as rude as our waitress. We couldn't wait to get out of there."}
{"text":"One of my favorite local bars to go to Sergio is the bartender and he has great customer service he knows how to accommodate drunk drunk people ....I would not really recommend this on a Saturday night there is not a lot of people but the bartenders are super cool and you can get a lot of drinks and hire to going to your main party spot"}
{"text":"What the hell happened to this place?  They are in serious need of new management.  If that chick wandering around in the Bronco's jersey is the manager she needs to be fired.  I gather she was by the way she was roaming the table area - not that she introduced herself, or asked if we needed anything - but she found plenty of time to hang around the bar fondling the hairline of some guy.  I ordered the pretzel appetizer and they were clearly old - they had those weird \"wrinkles\" on them that tells you they have been sitting around, or were heated/reheated before they were served to me.  Then I ordered a plain burger - I got a burger with everything but the sauce because \"that's plain\" according to our waitress.  No, plain is meat/bun; its pretty fucking simple really - and if you weren't sure what I meant you should have asked.   I pushed the untouched burger to the end of the table and saw her walk by and look at it on her way to deliver drinks to another table.  I'm not an asshole - I'll wait till she delivers the drinks to talk to her - but then on her way back she refused to look at our table - even when I called \"MISS!\" really loudly (since she didn't bother to tell us her name).  My friend asked for a glass of water when we sat down - 2 hours later she never received it.  I asked for a glass of water after my meal was corrected and Waitress of the Year took my Sprite glass and filled it with water - while there was still Sprite in it.  Nothing I love more than a sticky glass of watersprite.   I used to like to go here after catching a movie at Colonnade but looks like I'm going to have to go someplace else or pick a different theater.  Step up your game PT's."}
{"text":"The manager at this location is a sexist pig.   Not only did he berate a waitress for wearing a jacket, when she came inside from 48 degree weather, he also told a brand new waitress on her first day \"LOSE THE JACKET\"   I'm contemplating going back and knocking his teeth out"}
{"text":"My party and I received good service at the new PT Ranch lately. The nachos were great. Come in during happy hour for extra savings. Claudia our server was very friendly and gave us great service. Nice fireplace there, with extra room for parties, and great patio for outside dining."}
{"text":"My husband and I frequent this pub and enjoy the quiet atmosphere. The place is clean, the patrons are friendly. It is very comfortable as the large overstuffed chairs make you feel at home. We have never had a rude wait staff, in fact, they are very friendly. The food is typical pub food but my husband loves the chicken wings. The prices are reasonable and it is a good place to spend the evening."}
{"text":"Not sure if it's just this particular location but it was just okay. We came in around 3:30 so the bar definitely wasn't too busy. We sat there a bit before anyone came over to take our drink order. Once we got our first drinks, we didn't see the waitress again. Someone else ended up coming over to ask us if we wanted another round much later and only after she probably saw us looking around for someone. The drinks were pretty weak (at least what I had -- malibu bay breeze); even after 2 I was still completely sober. Oh yeah, and the second drink wasn't even what I ordered so for all I know, it was only cranberry juice, no alcohol. I wasn't really feeling this place so didn't complain; just drank it and left.   Also, I found it odd that none of the staff asked if we wanted to order food... We weren't really planning to but I would have liked an appetizer or something. I kept expecting to get a menu and one never came. Not sure if it's just an off day for the staff or if it's always like this. Maybe it's better at night? *shrug*"}
{"text":"last year or so this place went down hill IMO. They got rid of half the staff and made a lot of changes but turned it into a wanna be tourist bar not a local bar. Too bad cause it is the closest to my house. It's a shame cause it used to be my go to place. Music selection is very bad and despite many people asking for jukebox selection they never change. Classic rock and dead atmosphere no vibe left. Focusing on gaming players at 2 am is not good for younger and more vibrant crowds. No one wants  to listen to Steve Miller and and Elton John all night after working  at hip night club or bar after work. If your in the area try Remedy's St Rose area it's worth it trust me."}
{"text":"Happy hour was kind of gimmicky. Drinks were half off, but they didn't ring up correctly. There are only 3 food options for happy hour and a $7 burger is not exactly a \"special\" in my opinion.  The pool tables and darts were wide open and available for use. This was good."}
{"text":"I have come here several times with small groups of friends and for birthday parties. It is clean and has a nice atmosphere. Unfortunately the service is awful. The last time we went, we ordered a pizza after 40 min we asked about it and the waitress said it got burnt. After more time passed we gave up and canceled the order. The kitchen has had issues everything we have gone. I hope that hey can improve this because it is a nice bar, with outside seating and pool table."}
{"text":"I went here COMPLETELY unaware that it was a Chicago Bears bar. Regardless, I came to meet a friend and watch the Texans/Patriots game. On a dozen large TVs, only the Bears game was being broadcast. So, I flagged down a waitress and asked about my game and she pointed out a small television up in the rafters that had my game playing. Annoying, but, I grabbed a barstool on that side of the bar area, ordered an iced tea and hunkered down. Cue the ending of the National Anthem and that ONE television gets changed to the Eagles/Giants game on a customer request. I flagged down another waitress and asked that it be changed back.  A manager actually had to be called over and they deliberated for a good few solid moments before they pointed to the only other small television located in the rafters on the OTHER side of the bar where they would turn on my game.  The other side of the bar that had no seating left.  So, I asked the waitress how much I owed for the iced tea that I hadn't even touched so I could just leave.  This would have been the key moment where they notice that there's a non-alcoholic drink still in the same place where they placed it for me and just waved me off with a smile.  Nope.  Instead I got a shrug and...\"I don't know.  Three dollars?\"  I placed a five dollar bill down on the bar and immediately left.  I come to this location fairly often outside of football events, which is why I thought it would be a good place to view my game.  Not only was I seriously wrong, but I won't be back AT ALL.  They've lost a repeat customer.  At the end of the day, this is still a PTs and has the customer service to back up the name."}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed by this place. I used to come here when it was SuperMex and so I wanted to give it a try. It was incredibly quiet and the food was just bad.. I'm sure it needs some time to get a better local crowd and I will give it another go, but just not yet..."}
{"text":"The service at the place is terrible! My friends and I sat at a booth, and the waitress refused to acknowledge us for 20min. It was 1:45 by this point and happy hour was about to end so my boyfriend walked up to her to order our drinks and handed her my card so she could close the tab. She walked over 10min later and says that she had a big order to put in before ours so she couldn't put ours in before happy hour ended (if she would've acknowledged us on time, we would've had our drinks submitted on time). We understand even though we were a little frustrated. 40 min later and still no drinks. I walk up to the bar and the bartender was more than accommodating.  He comped my drinks and I hate to speak negatively because he handled the situation very well. But come to find out the server lost my card so she had to go find that for me too. Her name was Steph. My friends needed their tab split as well and she gave them attitude about it. If you go to this place, sit at the bar or expect to be neglected. This was the worst service my friends and I have ever experienced. This was my first and last time at this place."}
{"text":"Had two bad experiences here with waitresses taking way too long with my drinks. The last visit I counted 38 minutes before I decided to grab the check at the bar. Seating is great and there's a lot of space for an event but if you want your drinks order at the bar. Seems like they're focusing on their food menu more than anything else. 3 stars only because before all the advertising this was an awesome hangout where the drinks were coming. No one should be left thirsty. No one!"}
{"text":"I like this PTs. Probably because it doesn't look like a PTs. There's a ton of space, pool tables, oversized chairs, and a fire pit. Yes they could use some more activities for the space, like shuffleboard or corn hole like parkway tavern but I don't go here often enough to care. It is a good location because it's off the freeway so it's easy to meet up with friends. Happy hour is from 5-7 and 12-2. Recently my boyfriend and I stopped in before a movie so it was perfect for happy hour and some food. We ordered tall beers, he had the buffalo chicken sliders, and I had the bikini wrap. It took just a little longer than expected so we had to eat fast. However, the food was great. The bikini wrap is definitely not a health food but it's hearty, with ranch avocado chicken tomatoes and lettuce. The buffalo chicken sliders were even better. Huge pieces of chicken with a spicy buffalo sauce. The best part of the meal of course is the tots. They're super crispy. I also love how the servers always bring out ranch even if you don't ask for it. I assume they get asked many times for ranch after the food is delivered so they're one step ahead. Yes this is a PTs but I do recommend just trying it out. The casual environment really puts it above the rest even if it doesn't offer that much more."}
{"text":"Went for Sunday morning breakfast, what a treat!!!  Samantha was our server and did everything she could ensure our dining experience was awesome.   We requested a special order and she brought the chef out for full clarification!   Great food, reasonable price and royal service!!!"}
{"text":"Best PT's I've been to in town!  Like the other PT's, this location serves up the same drinks and food as the other bars. Happy hour, pizza, and pretty decent draft selection all like the other spots. However, what sets this place apart is the tavern itself.  This place used to be a Roadrunner but recently got bought out. As a result, this place is unlike any other other PT's in town. The tavern is HUGE, nice large patio with fire pits as you enter in, plenty of dinning and bar space and a bowling alley! The bowling alley is nice feature unique to this location, I call it Flintstones bowling as you use a small bowling ball to knock down pins attached to ropes. There are 2 lanes and it adds a nice touch to the place. There is a nice western feel to this PT's, alot of cow hides and cowboy decor around the place.  This probably the cleanest PT's in town, no dirty carpet or cigarette stench. Food/drink wise its the same as the other bars, so if your on the south side, this the PT's you need czech out."}
{"text":"Gross and the service was horrible. This place is only good for beer and stomach pain."}
{"text":"Every single time I have ever came here, the bartenders don't say hi or even respond to you for about 30 minutes. They are always talking to each other, laughing, making jokes. It's pretty rude to ignore your customers. 7 months ago, when I was pregnant, I came in to eat. I ordered my food and a water and had already been waiting about 15 minutes for my food. Until the bartender comes up to me and cards me. That's fine, because I'm of age. By birthday was the day before and my I'D had expired. They made me leave, AFTER ordering, when I was clearly pregnant. She wouldn't even sell me my food to go. She told me she would loose her job."}
{"text":"Recently brought a home close by and have been looking for a local sport bar for a favorite go to spot. I've been driving by this PT's Ranch for for a few months, finally stop in. This bar is very nice and unassuming, when first walking in I was amazed how nice the interior is. i would have never guessed it by the way it looks from the outside which is extremely plain.   Walked in sat down and was served right away by Mary who is absolutely awesome, frankly Mary is why we came back the second time because she is so nice and friendly. Each time back Mary have been amazing and has become a friend, it's really nice to have a bar with people working there that you can call friends.   The is also really good, however the quality of the drinks depend on the bartender. The blonde bartender makes the weakest drinks almost to the point of wondering if there is any alcohol in them.  Went in today around 3:00 PM and had 2 really good Tito's vodka and tonic's. Then the blonde chick showed up for work and took over bartending. Sent the first drink she made back because it didn't taste anything like the first two I just had, I thought it was made with soda instead of tonic. The drink came back tasting like there was virtually no alcohol in it. The plan was to sit there and watch the whole Las Vegas Golden Knights hockey game. After observing how this blonde bartender was treating everybody at the bar we decided to leave.   Honestly if it wasn't for Mary we would probably never go back again. 4 drinks 2 orders of wings over 70 bucks. Thats to much money for bad drinks. Mary on the other hand is priceless!   The blonde with the attitude needs to be fixed.  Then this is a 5 star  bar!"}
{"text":"Kristyne is amazing! Best bartender in town, and it doesn't hurt that she's smoking hot.  This place has a great staff all around, Kristyne and Glen in particular."}
{"text":"Not happy at all with the service.  We are not big gamblers but we do like to get out from time to time.  We spent 40$ each and was still chargeda tab for 20$ and the guy couldn't explain why.Mir did he bother to tell us we had a tab until after the fact. We seen several people who were bout playing with No tab.   No  more visits there. We will stick to gisupees where thou are treating line family"}
{"text":"I have been looking for a decent place to stop and have a leisurely lunch. PT's Ranch was nice, it's was clean and the food was tasty. The waitstaff was nice and everything came out as ordered and timely. I was looking at the reviews and saw that most 1 or 2 star ratings were people not happy with the staff. What I can tell you is that the staff were huddled in the corner being foul mouthed gals and talking poorly about other staff, their schedule and customers. We could hear everything and we weren't that close to them."}
{"text":"Like any PT's that I have been to Blah and average. I had some food and gaming comps here and just didn't care for it.  The scene was good. The service was below average border lining bad. The food well, below average vegas bar food. The prices are very good, but whats a price when the service and the food isn't that great."}
{"text":"Needed a late night bite and after driving past this place daily I decided it was finally time to come in! My friend and I came at around 12am and it was moderately slow. The decor is super cute and it doesn't look like a typical run of the mill bar. It's super clean, everything is brand new, and the overall atmosphere is very cute. I loved the fire place and the wood panel walls. It wasnt the usual dark, smokey, and typical local bar feel. I liked it. The bartender greeted us right away and took care of us throughout our meal. We got the Cesar salad, pretzel bites, and wings. Can't say much for the salad because I didn't eat it but it looked good. The pretzel bites were terrible. The cheese tasted like it came out of a frozen packet and the pretzel bites themselves were obviously heated in a microwave. Disgusting. But let me tell you, we got the medium wings and they were INCREDIBLE! The wings were so so so good and so were the fries it came with. I will absolutely come back for the wings alone. Overall a pretty good experience minus the pretzel bites. Will definitely come back and would recommend."}
{"text":"Place is nice, there is plenty of staff and it's not too busy and still I've waited 20 minutes for a bartender. We've called one over twice and they seemed to have forgotten about us. I just want to pay and leave. Sucks because I planned on staying here to gamble, drink and eat. I'm not sure if I'll be back"}
{"text":"There are so many different types of PT's around here, it's getting hard to distinguish between them all! This is the 'ranch' version. What's the difference you ask? A huge fireplace.  For me, except for some of the divey PTs Pubs I've been to, this particular location is pretty nice, new and clean - except for the mens room. Not sure if someone took the gnarliest dump ever or they have plumbing problems, I think the latter... It stunk every time I went in. We struck up a convo with one of the bartenders, she was telling us how the PTs brand is expanding and this was a newer concept...hmmmm. Anyway, the drinks are always good and the food is pretty good to. Typical PTs style happy hour 5-7pm or 12a-2a. During football season, they have food and drink specials 10a-10p. Very generous and that puts this on my list of cheap eats and cheap drinks.  During our last visit, we had the beef sliders (very good), the chicken nuggets (excellent) and the pizza rolls (not so good). One day I'll man up and try their hangover tots: tater tots, crumbled breakfast sausage, country gravy topped with an egg. A real widow maker there! Also, I love their home brew cream ale, very tasty."}
{"text":"Just went for dinner!!  Service by Samantha was spot on...she is super friendly and fast!!  We started with some cocktails including a long beach iced tea for me.  Stephanie makes a killer cocktail!!  Not too sweet or too strong and we had that plus a beer in a matter of minutes.  Had rib tips and a club sandwich.  The tots with the club sandwich were perfect not too crispy . The sauce on the rib tips was awesome and the sides were all really good!!  They actually have sound on for the games which we love!!  We are totally going to be back"}
{"text":"I live right by this place so often I come to this place for draft beer and some night food like nachos and wings.   Great food and great atmosphere."}
{"text":"I made the mistake of not checking the Yelp score for this establishment before heading in for a mid day 4th of July meal. After a much too long wait for our food I immediately sent my overbooked and unappealing egg dish back. The menu lacks any creativity. My advice  Stay away."}
{"text":"I have been coming to pt's for  4 years and have Always gotton excellent service from Tina who has been here just about as long as I have been coming. Always friendly and fun to be around.  Always quick service.  Ask for Tina when you need a server."}
{"text":"I went to PT's Ranch for a viewing party of an episode of Food Network's \"Chopped\" which had our local chef, John Church, as one of the contestants.  The event was held in an area that can be booked for private gatherings.  This PTs used to be a Mexican restaurant that renamed itself and then went out of business.  The room was large enough to hold approximately 60 people.  All of the TVs were set to the Food Network.  As you came in the door, PTs had set up a buffet of hummus and pita, wings of different spiciness, sliders, chicken and waffles, and some other goodies.  The food was very good.  Based on my experience this evening, I'd return to try something off the menu.  There is no enclosed area for non-smokers or the other way around.  The staff was very pleasant in getting drinks and it was a fun night.  And, Chef Church was the winner of \"Chopped\" and it made the night for us all!"}
{"text":"Planned my husband's 50th birthday party with Stephanie, who was so helpful and amazing!  Bobby the manager was great and greeted us after we arrived.  We had two servers (Sylvia and Alec) for our party of 40.  We started at 6 and ended around 10.  Everyone had a wonderful time.  Food was great, drinks were always full, and the little extras made it a memorable evening.  Thank you so much for helping my husband have a happy birthday!"}
{"text":"Love this new rustic Americana PT's ranch. I think this place being a PT's will be the first business that has stuck and succeeded for this building.  I'm happiest to see my bartender Chris Clay is back with the company!"}
{"text":"A friend and I like to stop in here after work. I love the ridiculous decor with the high back bright colored chairs amongst the longhorns and fake cow hide booths. The food is the same as most other PT'S I've been to. I usually get the boneless bucket with twister fries. The bourbon flavor is my go to however I sometimes change it up with Asian bbq or maple hot. I also recommend the bikini wrap if you're looking for a lighter fare.  This place has a beautiful outdoor patio with a fire pit. I'd give it another star but some ares seem a little run down. The one time I asked for cheese sauce with my fries, it seemed as though it was from the bottom of the can and had been sitting all day. Other than those minor things, this is always a go to after work. Proximity to 215 doesn't hurt either! :)"}
{"text":"Did I really just pay $10 for prepackaged squuezed from a bag Guacamole and crappy salsa? Same on u Pts"}
{"text":"Sighs i was very very very disappointed with my experience at PTS Ranch. Not only did our waitress treat us like second hand citizen, she was completely unavailable during our visit. I would even go as far to say that she didn't even care to wait on us based on her attitude the few times she did come to our table. As if thst wasn't enough We waited almost an hour for our food which ended up being below average. It was the absolute worst experience and I will never return."}
{"text":"They've recently changed their Happy Hour and it's definitely a downgrade. It used to be half off most drafts and five dollars for select apps like boneless wings, basket of fries/tots, and a few others. A pretty decent deal, especially with half-price Lagunitas IPAs, Blue Moons, etc. Our crew had been going weekly for months.   However: two weeks ago the HH appetizer offerings changed, so we tried the five dollar fried pickles. A tiny paper fry basket arrived with perhaps 15 pickle chips in it (as opposed to the large plastic basket that used to hold the fried HH goodies). Wow, a really poor value.  Then last week after our second round of Lagunitas IPA tankards is delivered our server casually mentions Hey, you guys know these aren't on HH anymore, right? Uh, no, HH goes until 7:00. No, she says, they aren't ever on HH, only domestic drafts, not \"craft\" beers. OUCH, it would have been nice to know that before we ordered four $8+ beers thinking they were half that price!  So between the low-value appetizer \"specials\" and the cutback to water...er, domestic drafts, we're finding other HH options. Four stars because its a nice place with good TVs, but have to go with only two stars because of the major weakening of Happy Hour."}
{"text":"The \"beef\" patties on my sliders were cold when I got my order but my onion rings were hot, straight out of the fryer. My husband liked his burger, he didn't have the same issue as I did. Another reason for the 2 stars is because we waited over 30 min for our order and the place wasn't even packed."}
{"text":"Ok so I usually like PT's but here it goes, I was there for breakfast and was the only one there, I waited for the waitress only to see here over by the bar talking to the bartender, both of whom were smoking, really? Anyhow after my food got there it was not as good as the Sierra Gold on Jones (owned by the same people). But still half off breakfast before 10AM so I am not really complaining, but I kinda am.  Live it up you are in Las Vegas for cryin' out loud!"}
{"text":"This is our second visit here and enjoy the cold beers and appetizers. ...at this time we were at bar and Stephanie bartender she was amazing ,nice  smile and friendly thanks for a great service we most definitely host our company party here very soon and we will highly recommend our friends send Neighbor to come over for a cold drinks"}
{"text":"Really pleasant surprise walking into this place did not expect the decor and ambiance to be so legit! You walk in and will instantly see the three fire pits the have I  the large outdoor patio area very nice set up to chat and enjoy a chilly evening. Further inside the bar is a large pool area with two table that are I  good condition. And all the way to the back is the main bar again very large and spacious loved that there was plenty of elbow room all over this bar. Waitresses and bar staff were very friendly and drinks were priced just right. And let's be honest the staff is very easy on the eyes in this establishment loved it I will definitely be putting this place on my short list for going out to have my evening whiskey and chill moments."}
{"text":"Worst service ever! Sat at a table, the server looked right at us and walked away. It wasn't packed! She was rude! My friends and I like be going to PT's but never going back to this one!"}
{"text":"A group of friends and I recently came here to do our nfl fantasy draft. If you've been to the PWY on Flamingo and 215 then this set up will look very familiar to you. They both were previously Road Runners, the only difference is PKWY did a bit more renovated compared to this PTs. Either way it looks a bit nicer than a standard PTs location, it has a giant pool table, nice outdoor patio and lots of cow theme going on.   As for food we shared quite a few things as a group. To start we had the chips, guac & salsa (4/5). They were very basic, but tasty. A pepperoni pizza (4/5) which was 50% off during their happy hour. We also had a chicken bucket, fries, and mac n cheese bites. These were all about a 2/5 for me, nothing too special. I also had the PTs hefeweizen which was actually really good, it had a similar flavor to Blue Moon.  Overall it was just an alright bar with sub par & extremely slow service. If I had a choice of going to BAR or PKWY I'd probably chose those over this place."}
{"text":"Gilroy pizza is a garlic cheesy pizza topped with sausage, pepperoni, tomato add red pepper and jalapeño for spice.  Happy hour you get a 16\" pizza half price. Regularly $17.99.  Steal!!! Plus along with Happy Hour, any alcohol, I mean any is half off.  Round of shots please!    They also have a monthly menu so don't forget to check that out.  Sweet potato curly fries however were far from curly though.  its ok, no biggie. Tonight they had a special promotion for a sample of some cinnamon tequila, not for me, but who ain't down for some free liquor.    I must say this is the cleanest PTs I've been too.  It doesn't stink of old carpet.  Nicely decorated with plenty of room to just chill with your group.  Pool tables, a jukebox, TVs to watch the game and our waitress was awesome!"}
{"text":"Second review for this place. This time we had drinks at the bar and ordered some garlic parmasian fries and they were actually very good. I will continue to order them in the future. The bartender wasn't very personable but i guess what can you ask for when coming to a chain bar."}
{"text":"We like the food here and the 1/2 price pizza deal from 5-7 can't be beat but unfortunately our trips have been less and less frequent. Service has always been great but we can't take the smoking. Even if they would make the booths non smoking it would be something."}
{"text":"Me and a friend came here around 3pm on a Thursday. The place was very empty and we could see the bartenders and servers huddled at side station talking. The bartender we had was pretty short and cold, not welcoming at all. She took our drink order and we told her we would like menus. After about 10 minutes we had to flag her down because we had been ready to order. I ordered an appetizer which she brought out at the same time as my entree. We had a couple more drinks and had to flag her down to get them. Then when we get our bill she didn't even comp the beer my friend drank after gambling over 20 dollars. Over all it was extremely bad service and very unwelcoming environment. We will never go back!!"}
{"text":"Drinks are great.....service and attitude, not so much.  I'm used to awesome service at my local Sierra Gold on Buffalo NW vegas   The server and bartender at this location seemed cold and even rude, so we left sooner than we expected.  Was hoping for a better experience."}
{"text":"Hey! Pts management your bartender is so slooooooooooooow and too busy smoking ciggies to serve her guests... Sucks because y'all have good beer, good food and I live right down the road."}
{"text":"This place has an Average bar/pub scene. Good for an after work happy hour for 50% off drinks and a few options for happy hour snacks. Variety of beers and full bar. Would be a good place to watch a game, too. I didn't have food, but drinks and service were good."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a drink one night. The atmosphere was good. It was decorated pretty cute & they had fire pits to sit next to outside. They had live music the night we went in there.. Which is always a plus. They also had late night happy hour specials :-)"}
{"text":"Hate to say anything bad about my favorite PT's but  I just called with a question and the woman was quite rude and not very helpful. Must be a morning waitress/bartender because her name was not familiar when she answered the phone. I suppose I'll call back and ask a manager another time. Bummer!"}
{"text":"Music selection is terrible! Servers and bartenders are nice. Always kind of slow so not a very good atmosphere."}
{"text":"I was looking for a quick casual spot to try. I hear that their happy hour was awesome but I didn't make it in time. I didn't want anything too heavy like their breaded chicken tenders or regular chicken tenders. I decided to try their wings. The chicken wings and fries were decent. I like my buffalo wings crispy and this place did that. I prefer them not to be too breaded and that's what I got. The server was nice.  I would probably just order to-go next time just because I would only go for a quick-bite. Nothing too remarkable  here."}
{"text":"This place sucks. The Staff is incompetent,and rude.I saw the Waitress and the Bartender trying to figure out an Order by doing a taste test. The Price is high,and the Food is suspect.Never again for PT's.There is a reason this joint is always empty.I just gave part of it."}
{"text":"Great happy hour and pizza!  The waiter said they couldn't give me a tall glass for my drink and didn't bring water until I asked even though I said I wanted a tall glass so I don't get drunk, but we enjoyed it here!"}
{"text":"The service is meh. I think the chef doesnt know how to cook, when you ask for a burger cooked medium it should have some pink, makes me think all their meat is frozen, they run out of stuff, and I don't know why their regular french fries have sugar on them, It's gross."}
{"text":"What a great place to stop by and have breakfast, lunch or dinner..  they have great food, great tv's, hot bartenders and a good amount of gaming.    We've come here for a few football games and have really enjoyed our time spent here."}
{"text":"This is a nice local place. Clean with friendly staff. They have my grapefruit beer along with so many other choices. They have indoor and outdoor seating, which will be nice as it's turning to fall."}
{"text":"I've had multiple problems at this PTs. I've been charged for top shelf whiskey when I ordered a \"whiskey and coke.\" Was told I didn't specify my whiskey so I got what he gave me, yet at every other bar you order that and you get well or they ask you to clarify what it is you want. Not my only problem but the last straw for me. The zookie is good though."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick beer since my brother's plane was delayed an hour . . . and was pleasantly surprised . . . even though I was an out-of-towner, and everyone there appeared to just have gotten off work . . . I was treated like a local.  The bartender was attentive and kept track of my needs . . . even taking time to strike up a conversation.  The beer was super cold . . . super big . . . and cheap.  Good thing I had to go and get my brother . . . otherwise this could have been a really bad night . . . because those beers were going down way to easy.  Definitely on my shall return list . . . just that . . . next time I will spend a little more time here."}
{"text":"Definitely one of the cleanest pts but that's obvious as it's only been open since the summer. I just left the place and literally the worst time spent at a bar. And I enjoy going around town tryin different dive bars fancy bars casino bars whatever.our bartender, Stephanie, absolutely terrible. She sounds sweet at first takes awhile with the drinks. I asked what the comped drinks were and ordered one my friend as well. Then we ask for menus we were waiting to order far too long. Wasn't a busy time at all. Anyways after ordering our food she never asked if we needed water or a drink. Finally after finishing our nachos which I must admit were pretty tasty. I asked if we could have the check and a water. She comes back without my water hands the check and says your 2 tequilas are on there because you didn't play enough. Every local knows every bar in town u get comped drinks for $20 play on max or $1 hands. Well I put in $30 lose win lose win of course went down to $1 then last hand won $25 and cashed out. I explained that to her and she says well no the machine says u didn't even play $20. Free goin back and forth I asked if I could just speak to the manager about this. Of course she hits me with the I am the manager. OMG!! Seriously she's a manager and cares nothing about customer satisfaction. I'm positive she has lost that pts plenty of business. I've heard about her but first time getting her. Terrible!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, had the burger and tots, wife had the cajun chicken sandwich with fries.  The service was marginal, having to ask for refills on tea and having to get the attention of the server to ask her for our check.   I go to a lot of PT pubs and this one is probably the worst service pub in the valley."}
{"text":"My buddy and I like to get breakfast here a couple times a week. Jason Learnard always not only takes  amazing care of us, but he knows our order and has our coffee on our table when we walk in. All the staff at this PT's are wonderful, but Jason is the best!"}
{"text":"Late Sunday morning was HUNGRY, not looking for lunch, but really craving breakfast.  Came across PT's Ranch not far off 215 and Eastern.  Parked out back and walked up the side ... half expected loud, smokey, dirty gambling joint.  NOPE ... Could not have been more wrong!  Although darker than most eating establishment still plenty of light to read menu comfortably.  BIG bright TV screens ... all sports ... good variety ... not just football.  Mixed clientele with smokers in the group but you could smell the smoke!  Server was perfect; there when I needed her and gone when I didn't.  Had the chicken fried steak that was actually STEAK ... not like that Pub all overtown the serves Pork as steak (check their menu it's printed there clear as day). Meal at PT's Ranch was great ... even came with one pancake (little up charge but worth it).  Hit this establishment up ... It gets 5 big stars from me.  Oh ... if I'm posting pictures that means its special for sure."}
{"text":"I ordered 2 moose drool beers on happy hour which is from 5 to 7. Apparently they changed their happy hour from all drinks to certain drinks. I got billed $15.00 . Waitress said ohh that's not on happy hour anymore. But she knew it wasn't when I ordered it since I told her to let me know when it was last call for happy hour. Manager wouldn't change the price even though I used to e here all the time and ordered that specific beer. Smh."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of 6, we were just off a Vegas knights hockey high, excited to eat some good grub and have a good time. Let's get the bad right out of the way, our server Tina quickly killed the mood for us. She argued with us 3 times, gave an attitude, took over 15 minutes to take our order and it took over 30 minutes for us to get out food. Normally I would understand seeing as a bar is usually packed and the kitchen can get backed up, but that was not the case as the bar was not crowded at all. Her customer service was not up to standard and seeing as u work in a bar that is a pretty important thing to make sure is on point. She argued that we did not order our drinks which we did, gave attitude over splitting checks and proceeded to give  attitude about it. Her over all attitude really ruined what was a great evening for us and I don't usually rant like this but she really put us in a sour mood. The food was amazing great food can't complain about that, took a little bit to get but well worth the meal. Prob won't come back anytime soon but I hope she improves the attitude."}
{"text":"Cool bar but the service is AWFUL! It really is too bad that the service is so consistently horrible because this bar is very cool otherwise. The decor and vibe are great and the outdoor seating/firepits are lovely (hence the 2 stars not just 1). We have gone here SEVERAL times trying to give it another chance but it's just not worth it. The service downright sucks, every single time. Our food is always a disappointment and is often incorrect, and it's a struggle to get a drink. One time we waited 20 minutes outside, the girl walked past us no less than 4 times before we finally gave up and went to the bar and waited another 10 minutes for that bartender to serve us a drink. We took our drinks back out to the patio only to be chastised by the outside server telling us we were supposed to order from her with a very nasty attitude. The servers are rude but I honestly don't blame them completely, I blame management because they consistently seem completely overworked and understaffed. Unfortunately we do not go here anymore even though it had the potential to be our local hang. We have tried this PT's no less than 8 times (possibly more) and have NEVER had a good experience there with the service or the food. I'm pretty flexible and forgiving but this place really needs an overhaul with their management/staff. You've been warned. We just stick to the PT's on Maryland/Silverado Ranch which is nearby, they are consistently friendly, quick to serve you and the food is good."}
{"text":"As long as you don't have Stephanie as your Server!  She profiles you."}
{"text":"We went here last week and the service was beyond horrible. If you don't sit at the bar don't expect to be served. I could have easily left without paying my $4 bill (seriously only 1 drink) no one would have noticed! Instead I had my husband go to the bar to pay the bill since no one retuned to check on us. Complete joke and ruined the first hour of our 2 hour date night."}
{"text":"I had the best experience at this location...and it's all because the amazing waitress Kelsey!!! She is Soo kind and made my experience at PTs awesome...best PTs location I've been too!!!"}
{"text":"I realize we are here during a playoff hockey game, but we sat at our table for 35 minutes with the waitress coming by once to tell us she would be back to take our order but never came back. We moved up to the bar, and sat there for another 10 more minutes before waving down the bartender (who was friendly when he came over). Overall, the service is pretty bad, maybe it's the manager who didn't schedule properly; but this being my first time coming here I can't say I will ever come back."}
{"text":"located just across from IKEA, I stopped into this bar to see what it's all about since I drive by it each and every day to work.  It was Friday night about 8pm. Parking was easy and not overly crowded but there is plenty of parking. As I walked in I noticed they had an outdoor patio area but was closed because it was colder outside. As I walked in you quickly notice the many TV Screens around the bar and plenty of bar top, bench seating areas. There is an active Fireplace that separates two rooms which on room is now catering but soon to be converted to pool tables and pinball machines they say.  The main bar hosts many poker machines as in most bars around Vegas neighborhoods but also the bar has great lighting and feels welcoming.   The bartenders were quick for service and welcome you to have a seat.  Ordered beers and burgers and simply was on point.  Not too smoky as well even though some people were smoking in the bar area.  I particularly like the many TV's visible from just about any sitting location as well as they had big booths for larger parties.  I'm glad I stopped in as this will certainly be a return to place!  thanks."}
{"text":"Just met the new bartender at PTs Ranch on Pebble & Eastern.  Her name is Claudia, and I would definitely come back & have a drink or meal when she is working.  Being from the Midwest, I love when a bartender/server interacts with the guests.  I actually asked if she was from the Midwest and was shocked when she said she wasn't.  Great personality, great vibe & awesome service!  Thanks Claudia!"}
{"text":"I came here having bad service from Stephanie at the bar about 2 weeks ago. I was so upset the couple on both sides of me were upset with her service too! We waited 13 minutes to get our 1st drink and that was after we started timing. I was so upset we didn't even eat dinner we left and went to another bar and had great service down the street.  If you come here avoid her service. It's not the 1st time I've seen her. She was at Buffalo and 215 PTs and she was no better there either.  When I wanted to complain about her service I was shocked that she was manager! Horrific! Seriously. NOPE! This use to be my favorite spot to come when it was Jalisco's and Super Mex! I recommend everyone to go to the Buffalo PTs. Way better service!"}
{"text":"This place is super HIP looking, and not really the \"RANCH\" vibe I was expecting. Maybe I expected some cowboy murals on the wall, an electric bull, and a barn door, kinda like Saddle Ranch in Hollywood.   There are no pool tables or games you can play here, but it's a nice, posh place to stop by, especially with their HH deals.   I'm a consistent fan of their chicken strips (buffalo sauce hot) with the tater tots. The pizza, not so much."}
{"text":"Usually a good time we usually sit a the bar with Rob..... Table service was a bad choice. Over view of the experience. 12 ppl in the place.....Undercooked pizza, no extra plates ,no silver wear, no napkins, wrong burger, unfilled drinks,  dressing on salad when asked for on side. Regulars come often  Rob will only come when he is working."}
{"text":"Pt's Ranch you nailed it!  Kind hospitality is here!  Ask for Paul he is down to earth and efficient!  The manager Bobby rocks as always and the new server from Hawaii is a sweet heart! The decor is rustic and current but, most of all comfortable! They just put in a new pool table, besides gaming,  there are more new games to come like shuffle board. Great food! Yay for spring valley this could be your new \"CHEERS\"!"}
