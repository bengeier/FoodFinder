{"text":"Had early lunch there for a birthday back in January. It wasn't too busy which was nice because we had 2 little ones with us. The food was tasty - the size of the shrimp is huge. Do not go there if you have a dairy allergy because there's butter in almost all of their sauces. Ordering something without butter was a challenge since you order through ipads. The server we had wasn't the most pleasant and seemed really annoyed that we were trying to order something without butter for our daughter that is allergic to dairy. Definitely messy but I guess that's part of the experience. I'd recommend people try it out for something different but I don't see myself going back there anytime soon."}
{"text":"If you love seafood, this is a must try. I was excited yet apprehensive about the whole \"eating from a plastic bag\" experience, but the plastic gloves, LA boil bib and shell cracker made it a not so messy experience. Ordering from the Ipad was easy, similar to some other AYCE sushi joints. Shared the Dungeness crab with LA Boil sauce. That sauce is DELICIOUS! Just the right amount of garlic and cajun to make you clean out the bag. As there's typically not much meat in the crab, despite ordering the $36 dungeness, we got the seafood bag, which had a combo of sausage, shrimps, and mussels. If you shrimps with a head and tail make you squirmish, that order might not be the best choice. The LA boil sauce tasted even better in this bag because of the amazing flavours of the seafood combo. The seafood rice was pretty good to share and we had leftovers. The server advised us that the salad table was complimentary with our meal. Not sure if that was still part of the opening special. YMMV. Got a 10% discount, available until March 15, 2017 because of the grand opening. Will definitely go there again but not before a cholesterol check up."}
{"text":"If you ask me where am I right now,I will tell you,I am in the L.A BOIL SEAFOOD!Yes,I and my friends come back again and we want to celebrate the birthday here!That will be a nice day!"}
{"text":"The food is disgusting here.  We tried few different things on the menu, however they all tasted terrible.  Their speciality sauce is also bad and smells horrible."}
{"text":"Got the snow crab with the LA mix seasoning...  Ate at night, woke up at 2 am, and got violently ill."}
{"text":"Didn't feel like eating seafood so I ordered chicken slices in L.A. boil sauce.  I ordered mine with corn and zucchini slices.  It was quite tasty and had enough heat for me.  Base price for the seafood or chicken slice and every add on had a charge such as corn, mushrooms, vegetables etc. It came with all you can eat salad. The greens were fresh but not a lot of choices. Salad table had lettuce, mango slices, peach slices, pickles, croutons and parmesan cheese. Oh and only 1 type of dressing.  Server was really nice and friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Not my first visit to this style of food but my friends and I got food poisoning.. loved it."}
{"text":"Had the seafood combo with Mussels, Shrimps, Calms and Baby Calms and Saugage was really good.  Will go back for sure.   The mussels were done well as well as as the calms.  The shrimp was cooked well but the shell was a little difficult to remove. The Saugage was cooked well too.  Service was nice."}
{"text":"This is our go to spot for seafood boil in Mississauga! My sister and I have frequented this restaurant several times. We're unsure why this place is never busy even on a Friday night.  We are seafood lovers so we typically choose the AYCE option. It's worth it as we go through at least four bags of just clams. For $30 you get unlimited mussels, clams, crawfish, and shrimp. The most recent time they were limited on crawfish so they limited it to one per table. We started off with some miso soup and Cajun fries. During our stay we ordered at least three bags of each ayce seafood. I also like the add on sausage.  Service is fast and friendly. There weren't many tables occupied so service was good throughout our stay. I hope they don't close this location like the west location.  Will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"We went with the AYCE for a Saturday lunch. The food was good and hot and came out fast. Personally, I liked the Captain's Boil sauce better because the seasonings are more well-dissolved. The service was \"meh..\" but the waitresses' attitude was awful throughout the meal. What really bothers me is that they ask a kid for ID to prove that he is 12 yrs old. And in the end, we paid full adult fee for everyone. The waitress said \"don't worry, we'll skip the $10 tip for you\" (??). So I assume the tip is MANDATORY of $10?? although the service was disappointing."}
{"text":"After trying out LA Boil it was time to try out one  of their main competitor's. It was a SOFT taste test - take out only - i just wanted to try their flavour, so i just ordered mussels and corn in the LA boil mix spices mild hot sauce. I called made the ordered and they told me to come by in 5 to 10 mins and it will cost this amount of money with 10 percent discount DOPE.  Hanged back for 5 mins at the crib just enough time to change to my street gear and get going. Got to the place and fitting its beside an aquarium store LoL 4 reals yall probably working hand and hand??? Just joking but if they where tell ya wouldn't be surprised. Waiting at the front until a server came by and told him i am here for take out pick up and BOOYAH!!!! food was ready i was like say Waaaaa hella fast anyways paid the dude and got on my way and as i left took a flyer. Brought it home and ate it with steam rice and i was like VERY nice in steam rice!!! i feel Capt Boil spice is similar and a bit better.  JUST A BIT not a lot.  A bit....With that said as i was looking at the flyer they have combos and deals and it actually intrigues me to come back and try everything because of these saucy deals. With that said, imma give them a 4 star and definitley CREW UP with 3 other ppl and try their meal for 4 ppl for $80.  Hopefully we will all be satisfied. Stay tune for my follow up on this place again."}
{"text":"Probably prefer this location over the other location near Winston Churchill.   I'm a regular at L.A boil as I love their seafood boils. This location feels cleaner and is better designed than the other one. There's a sink in the dining area that allows customers to access to wash their hands rather than go to the washroom. Easier to access with messy hands.   The food here is delicious. Every visit my shrimps are always fresh. The shell was not difficult to peel and the shrimp didn't stick to them. The flavour is delicious. They always get the flavour on point. The shrimps are drained properly when compared to the other location. So the flavour is strong with every shrimp. The other location, the sauce is always diluted because of the shrimps being not drained properly. However, this location does it right.   I pretty much only get the shrimps, chicken and fries here. The chicken goes well with the sauce. Their fries are absolutely delicious. It's my favourite place to get fries. They taste great with the sauce too.  I dip them in the la boil sauce.   They also have a free salad bar here for their customers. It's all you can eat.   As for service, the service is great most of the time. Except that one time the server mixed up all our sauces and didn't do anything about it...  Overall, nice place to go for seafood. Would definitely recommended this location over the other. I also prefer this place over captain boil because their sauce tastes better."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious and the servers are very attentive. The only reason for not getting a five star review is the atmosphere seems a bit \" fast foodish\" and the ladies bathroom was a real mess.  Now we went there when it first opened so there are bound to be kinks. Will give them the benefit of the doubt and try it again since the food is great and the prices are reasonable"}
{"text":"Came on a weekday when it was not busy so the service was quite good.   This is the only AYCE seafood place that does have crawfish as a part of the selection. I was very pleased with that. On top of the seafood selection, there are also options for kitchen foods that include some dimsum dishes. Got pleased again looking at the iPad menu. Food was generally good at a reasonable price range. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Service was good.  Food was messy but flavorful and quite filling.  It came pretty quickly.    I got the shrimp with LA Boil sauce with corn and sausage.  Friend got the fresh crawfish with garlic butter sauce with corn and potatoes.  Both sauces were good but if you like spicy then LA Boil is the way to go although it may feel overly oily.  The corn tasted great in both sauces, very sweet.  The shrimp was definitely better bang for the buck.  The crawfish were kind of small and barely any meat.  Two/three crawfish equated to one shrimp in terms of meat.  Overall decent experience and would consider coming back to try out their other flavors."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place to eat seafood, love the flavour, the salad bar , the atmosphere , everything , I even  take away the leftover sauce from the restaurant to use it to prepare my own shrimp on the next day :)"}
