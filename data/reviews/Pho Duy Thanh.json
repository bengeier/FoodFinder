{"text":"One of my favourite Vietnamese places in the NW. Always good food no matter what you order, always quick, and always friendly service. My spouse and I love the salt and pepper squid. No complaints!"}
{"text":"I wasn't expecting much from this place, but it left me with a good feeling! My colleagues and I were visiting James Fowler High School, so we decided to walk across the street to see what was it in strip mall. The only thing that looked remotely appealing was a little Vietnamese place. For the most part, all vietnamese noodle houses are the same, offering the same menu items with the same mediocre quality.  We needed food FAST. Like 30 minutes fast. The three of us ordered the lemongrass chicken with rice vermicelli, the satay chicken sub, salad rolls, and the deep fried chicken wings.  The food came out quickly, and we were out of there in less than 30 minutes. The food was fresh. My chicken wings were AMAZING. It reminds me of how my uncle double deep-fries his chicken wings. They came out sooo crispy. Super oily, but very crispy. It must have been the kind of batter or something that they used. According to my colleagues, their food was very good too.  What stood out was the cleanliness. The kitchen was visible from where we were sitting and everything was neat and tidy. The fridge looked clean and organized too. We were impressed, especially because high school students come here during lunch. I remember the Dairy Queen by my high school, and it was literally a dump. This place was clean, bright, and inviting! Very refreshing!  24/30"}

{"text":"To be honest, I've had both better and worse.   While I commend them on their fresh ingredients, I believe that at some point I heard a microwave alarm go. If I wanted microwaved food I could have stayed at home.  But I will agree with the other Yelpers, it was fast and it was hot. The front was clean and from what I could see, so was the kitchen.   An added bonus is being able to pick up the wifi (password protected) from the sports bar next door. The free parking in front usually has a spot available and the people are friendly.   Nothing really stood out as being spectacular, but the important parts (clean, fast, inexpensive) were well executed."}
{"text":"Great pho! We have takeout here once a week. Soup is a nice large portion. Only negative thing is they give out very small portions of hot sauce."}
{"text":"Was passing by and spotted this little Vietnamese restaurant on 4th Street and 40th Avenue NW, opposite James Fowler High School.  Ordered takeout.  No. 19 - Stir Fried Lemongrass Beef & Spring rolls on Rice Vermicelli - very tasty and fragrant beef.  Spring rolls are made with taro, I'm sure of it!  It tastes so good!  No. 27 - Rare Sliced Beef, Tendon Beef Noodle Soup - broth is very clear and a nice sweetness.    No. 41 - Special Fired Rice (Shrimp, Diced Vegetables, Chinese Susage & Fish Egg) - Quite good.  Fish Egg is Tobiko and the rice turns orange.    Very clean restaurant.  Free parking in front of the restaurant."}
