{"text":"Fantastic restaurant to go to for a classy romantic or family oriented dinner. The food itself is based around the concept of everything local everything fresh. I ordered the polenta fries, which are to die for, and a pizza, which was very authentic in terms of the way it was prepared. The service is phenomenal and the owner was very friendly. If you get a chance to go to this place don't hesitate."}
{"text":"Didn't write up review for this restaurant when it first open till now.   It is a new restaurant by then.  There is not even a menu available.  Everything is either written on the huge black board stretched across the top of the restaurant or recited by the waitress.  The owner seems to know most of his customers.  Most of the patrons are families.

The pizza is very good.  Thin Italian style with not too much cheese and sauce, just the right amount."}
{"text":"I came here for the \"soft opening\", and walked away with one of the worst and most hilarious restaurant experiences of my life.

The most glaring errors came from the server (and, I assume, the management), so I'll start there. I was ready to excuse the lack of a physical menu (this being a soft opening), and the fact that no one paid us any mind for 5 minutes of standing and waiting for a table, despite the fact that the restaurant was barely a quarter full.

The waitress came by 10 minutes after taking our order to say \"what are you waiting on again?\" We repeated our entire order to her, but this did not prevent her from forgetting my main course, which arrived 15 minutes after everyone else had finished eating.

Two salads were brought out without cutlery. I asked the waitress for cutlery, but she neglected to bring it until 10 minutes later, by which point my hungry dining companions had picked at most of their salads with their hands. The waitress simply shrugged. The rest of the food was brought out at irregular, widely spaced intervals. She didn't take any dirty plates off the table until the end of the meal, even placing a fresh entree plate directly on top of a dirty appetizer plate.

We ordered seasonal vegetables as a side to our mains, and were presented with what we were told was mashed potatoes. After asking the visibly confused waitress about the mistake, she arrived a long while later to announce that these were, in fact, the seasonal vegetables, and what she thought was mashed potatoes was actually a parsnip cauliflower mash. You would think that with such a limited selection of food, the staff would be trained in the content of each dish. 

Three couples around us left without ordering, likely frustrated by the ridiculously slow service.

The food was barely average. The salads were the best part of the meal. The roast chicken was without sauce, with lots of dry, nearly inedible white meat. The seared tuna arrived completely cold, and without the slightest bit of flavour. The pizza was a bright spot- quite good, but with one important mistake: my vegetarian sister had a large piece of chicken on her \"vegetarian pizza\". We did not stick around for dessert.

The bill for four was over $100- completely ridiculous for the embarrassingly incompetent service, and barely passable food. To top it all off, the waitress announced at the end of the meal that the credit and debit machine was broken, so they were only taking cash. Considering I came here on a holiday when banks are closed, this is information I would have liked to know at the beginning of my meal. I had to commission a relative to come and bring cash.

This is not the way to open a restaurant, soft or not. I will never return to this place, and recommend that you save your time and money by avoiding this restaurant."}
