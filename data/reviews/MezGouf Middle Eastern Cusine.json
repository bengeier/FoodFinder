{"text":"We went to this restaurant last night hoping to eat real delicious food. apart from the good service, the food was appalling. The humus tastes different from the usual middle eastern Humus, the salads looked old. The grill tastes a bit like packaged kebak that you buy from costco and not fresh at all. The fish came with red meat and really we could not touch it after the first bite. The nylon sheet covering the table are stained by old food on the sides and was not cleaned thoroughly.  Never again"}
{"text":"Mezgouf fish takes one hour to be grilled but worth the wait. Best I ever had.  4 stars not 5 for the Fatoosh, no tomatoes and oily."}
{"text":"We ordered the baba ghanoush, vegetarian mezgouf plate, and fattoush to start while we waited for our fish to cook. It takes about an hour for a 7-pound fish to be prepared and you get to choose your own from the lot in the water display; it came with two sides of rice, bowl of bamya, pickled veggies, onion, and mango salsa. Our server made a good recommendation for the size we needed (4people) and was consistent with her service. All in all, it was a good experience. One star taken away because the fish was undercooked and was the least satisfying thing we had. I will definitely be back, but maybe try something different."}
{"text":"Overpriced and average food. They load your plate with more veg and rice, and only a small portion of meat. No wow factor unfortunately. Sad but true, I felt my money was wasted."}
{"text":"While waiting for my winter tires to be installed next door, I decided to drop into MezGouf. It's was about 1pm and this large, upscale looking restaurant was empty. Not having the nerve to turnaround and walk  out, I took a seat at a large booth and was greeted by my server.  I took a look over the menu which didn't offer a separate lunch listing, I settled for the Iraqi style kebab platter. The server explained all the portions were relatively large and came with a choice of two sides, including their freshly made persian style naan bread. Note that the place does not serve alcohol and has yet to decide if it will given their client base is Muslim and many may not drink alcohol, I hope they offer alcohol as it would definitely  compliment many of their dishes including their featured fish dishes which I will try on a future visit.  My kebabs came out on a large platter with rice, salad, roasted onions and tomatoes. The flavors were awesome and well made!! I'm glad I didn't turnaround!  The server forgot my naan bread and after she apologized and insisted on bringing it so I could take it home, I had no room to eat and declined.  This place must be really busy for dinner, or at least I hope so given it's great interior decor and cleanliness. I wish them well because the whole roasted fish pictures displayed on their main monitors having me craving to come back!"}
{"text":"Very delicious Mazgouf, Kabab, tea and Iraqi bread .  The service was perfect too. Definitely recommend it and we will visit again."}
{"text":"This is a new Iranian Restaurant that recently opened. Our server says they'll be open 3 weeks as of August 5, 2017.   The restaurant decor is very impressive. It's clean, well maintained & clearly the owner (Mayada Anjelica) takes pride in her restaurant. The service was a bit amateurish as could be expected with such a new restaurant so that's a pass for his visit.   As for the food...it was delicious! The Tabouli was Fabio! I ordered the \"Mazgouf Signature Sandwich\". It was a creamy chicken filled Iranian Flat Bread that had peppers, onion, with Chicken & mushrooms. The French fries were only mediocre, however.   I'd definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Tasteless & Wayyy overpriced! I tried MezGrouf yesterday for the first time, and the last time! I have tried tens of restaurants in the Iraqi cuisine category, and this ranks somewhere at the very bottom if not the very last spot! The menu lacks so many essential food items in that category, with half the stuff already unavailable for a reason or another. half of the fish selections isn't available (fish is this restaurant main dish and feature item), with some items require an hour of cooking time, and no one tells you this until you're about to order your main. We all had to change our initial order that we had in mind, for either being out of that item, or taking a long time to cook! service is like from the 1990s...the setup/layout and atmosphere of the restaurant is very out-dated, cheap furniture and decorations. Even the music they were playing were literally Arabic albums from the 1980s and 90s! ending with the Value, this restaurant is extremely overpriced. the restaurant is extremely casual, food quality is below average, no alcohol, and it came up to $50 a person after tax and gratiutiy! that's how much you'd end up being at a high-end restaurant at times! we were four people, and our bill came up to $200, no alcohol, and no fish (main) which tend to be even more expensive/by weight!  A table next to us were freaking out when they received the bill, two guys got a bill of $168, and they were getting loud about it!  I will certainly stay away from this place, and not returning back. what a waste of a Sunday afternoon!"}
{"text":"Food is home made and good, enjoy falafel, fish and lamb, but service is awful , slow and one person is served at the time, we were 4 , waitress did not clean tables and it was a Tuesday only 3 tables in restaurant"}
{"text":"Stopped by for lunch today,ordered a falafel sandwich with salad..lovely interior space. Prompt and friendly service and order was delish!..house made pita,fresh crunchy veg and excellent falafel..will definitely return and recommend!"}
