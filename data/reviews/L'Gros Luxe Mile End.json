{"text":"Butternut squash soup is quite memorable and soothing. BBQ mushroom tacos were just the right size for a light lunch (dont expect a generous portion, they're dainty). It was our waiters first day and we sat there very thirsty for at least 10 mins before we got water. But he was sweet and accomodating when he did get around to us. My 18 year old daughter says this place is \"so hipster it hurts\", which I think is a compliment."}
{"text":"Première expérience à ce resto.  Brunch excellent.  Bonne portion et original.  Carte de drink a essayer.  Service très courtois et efficace.  Prix vraiment très bon.  Resto a refaire"}
{"text":"Yelp's description for a 3/5 star rating is perfectly appropriate here, \"A-OK\". Service is fine, food's alright but boring, and even at 6$-7$ it's over priced for the portion size. I was in the mood for some veggies so I got the Veggie Burger (super dry) and a Beet Salad (pretty good with nice big chunks of beets). Fries were meh. 26oz house beer was solid at 6$. My friend didn't make much of his tacos or sliders, but enjoyed his cocktail. The place gets busy so we waited 30 minutes, went for a coffee nearby. It's cool that they take your phone number and call you when your table's ready, but it's not worth the wait. Maybe a good place to grab a drink and get some snacks, but not ideal if dinner is the main priority."}
{"text":"Je suis définitivement en Amour ! Enfin une place ou le service est impeccable (pro et cool à la fois, souriant, rapide bref quasi parfait). La bouffe est vraiment pas chère : j'ai pris le hamburger maison pour 6 $, très honnête au niveau de la quantité, bon, bien présenté (pas de la grande gastronomie mais on s'entend qu'à ce tarif, c'est plus que bien). Les boissons sont aussi très abordables en terme de prix, variées et bien servies (mention spéciale pour la sangria blanche qui est délicieuse). Cela faisait longtemps que je n'avais pas trouvé un endroit ou l'on peut boire un verre en grignotant des plats sympas dans un ambiance très agréable sans dépenser un demi-mois de salaire bref à tester retester sans aucune modération, par contre, l'endroit ne désemplit pas donc il vaut mieux arriver tôt"}
{"text":"Love the food , they have a great selection for vegetarians. The drinks are very good . The breakfast poutine is amazing as well as the grilled cheese poutine . Good atmosphere and friendly service."}
{"text":"Firstly, the other L'Gros Luxe on St Andre is much better than this one but I've only been to that one once so I'm not the best judge.   This one, on the other hand, is on the corner of my street, so I have attempted learning to like it about 5-6 times and each time I come out angry and disappointed. I think they started off as a schtick- trying to get people to come in with cheap beers and cheap meals and then hoping to keep them as patrons. It pops up now (assuming after a few hefty fines) that they only have a liquor license if you order a full meal, but caesar-meals (the drink not salad) are their specialty, but you now need to order another meal to be able to even have your meal-drink. They label themselves as a \"bar\". And... They open at 4pm (not even for lunch) and close whenever they want (9-10pm often). Ok- so the menu. I heard that everything is under 5$ and that's what the whole city was talking about when L'Gros Luxe first opened. But, wait. Menu was under 5$ for the first while. Now it's super expensive!!! Like 6$ for a crappy, chewy, small burger. You want cheese on it? 2$. You want a side? Fries or salad? Add 2 more bucks. So now you have a bad caliber burger for 10$. Why not add a 20$ caesar to that? ...Cause it comes with another, even smaller crappy burger. All the portions are small and nothing is cheap and the quality isn't good at all.  Their fried pickles are fantastic and that's why they get 2 stars.  The staff is also all very friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"4 stars for the quality / price ratio but probably more of a 3 stars if just judging the food.  Came here for brunch and I have to say it's one of the cheapest brunch I had in town (finally potatoes priced right ;)). The vibe is great and the price is right. The food is ok, sans plus.

{"text":"Great food. Good ambiance and the service is quick and efficient. Tried the tacos shrimp and pulled pork and both were awesome. They also have Amazing cocktails, try the Napoleons mojito its a must and they have a great deal on local beer 26oz for cheap,   The name says it all L'Gros Luxe is the luxury big time."}
{"text":"We came here based on reviews we saw online.  At first the service was good, and the food was on par with the price. However when we paid our bill, our server who only came to our table twice over 2 hours essentiantially told us our tip wasn't enough and refused to let us leave until we gave him more money. Extremely disappointed in the outcome of the evening and the unprofessionalism from the server tonight. The service was definitely lacking.. there weren't many tables that evening so there was no reason for the poor service. Will NOT be returning to this establishment again."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places to eat and/or have a drink. The staff is awesome.   I recommend this place to so many people and rave about eating avocado fries everywhere I go. I was sad to hear they took them off the menu though... :("}
{"text":"This is the place that I go to in the area when my friends and I can't come to a decision on where to go.  It has something for everyone, especially in the way of drinks.  The cocktails are unique and delightful. I think the food is decently-priced for what you get and has always been tasty. For this reason, L'Gros Luxe is one of my staples. One drawback for bringing groups of people here is that it's quite noisy -- I have literally yelled at my friends over drinks here. This could be handy for dates, though, because it requires you to lean in to hear what your partner is trying to say to you, which can feel strangely intimate. I am a big fan of the tacos and the Mr. Miyagi caesar.  I get them every time."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere...food is good and creative from what I could tell from the dish I ordered. Staff are friendly. Not a 5 star place or experience but quite good."}
{"text":"I most definitely recommend this place.  Everything we had was really good and the service was just right. I had to try the L'Gros ceasar and was worth every sip and bight.   Low prices, good food, good service."}
{"text":"Best place I've been in Montreal so far! Very reasonably priced especially considering how nice the atmosphere is. I went here on a Sunday night and got a grilled cheese with poutine, which was delicious. My girlfriend got poutine with pulled pork and loved it. We also shared a pitcher of sangria, and the total came out to be $44."}
{"text":"belle soirée passée dans ce Resto bonne bouffe belle ambiance les cocktails sont vraiment bon et le service super ! J'y retourne c'est sur"}
{"text":"This place was lovely with wonderful plants and vintage decoration. It was a bit packed and the waiters were a bit all over the place, but we managed to get a table. The food options were pretty good, especially since there was a grilled cheese poutine! (Pretty tasty, I'm telling you.) Lots of vegeterian options too, which is a big plus.   It's not pricey so you can spend a bit more and get some delicious dessert (or drinks)!"}
{"text":"CBC article out today shows that management makes employees arrive on time but does not allow them to start their shift until management feels like it. Employees were robbed of up to an hour and half a shift. Disgusting and illegal! I will never go there again and I hope that whoever reads this will never give them their business as well. The article states that it is a chain wide policy.  http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/gros-luxe-restaurants-not-paying-employees-1.4553833"}
{"text":"Après une longue délibération sur le resto qu'on devait essayer, L'gros Luxe a été notre choix! On ne s'est vraiment pas trompé!  L'ambiance du resto feutrée et la déco nous a tout de suite charmé.  Nous avons été placés au bar et à part des bancs pas super confortables, c'est un bon endroit pour jaser avec le sympathique barman si jamais vous voulez y aller seul ou à deux!   Une soirée au resto commence toujours avec un bon drink. Le choix est impressionnant, mais nous avons choisi le Orange St-Viateur et le Bloddy Ceasar Billy le Kid (ne le prenez pas au gin, c'est un peu spécial comme goût). Les deux cocktails étaient très bons.  Pour le repas, j'ai choisi le grilled cheese à la poutine... ok ça sonne bizarre, mais c'était délicieux :) et mon amie a pris le sandwich poulet au beurre, bon, mais il n'était pas assez relevé à son goût.  Avec une deuxième ronde de cocktails, nous avons essayé le mango monkey et jusqu'à date c'est mon drink préféré là-bas. Il fallait évidemment essayer un dessert! Sous les conseils du barman, nous avons pris la pâte à biscuits frite (insérer un petit cri de joie tellement c'était bon).   Les prix sont vraiment raisonnables et les plats sont originaux.  Bref, j'ai adoré mon expérience au L'gros luxe :)"}
{"text":"Finally this past weekend, I had the chance to try the very well known L'Gros Luxe. I completely understand why it maintains such good reputation.  I truly do not have a single complaint.   Their food is casual, yet original and loaded with flavour. My pizza with sweet cherry tomatoes, goat cheese a fried egg and arugula was outstanding!!!!  Our food arrived within 10 minutes since we placed our order. It arrived hot, and perfectly presented.   Our waiter was very kind and polite.   Overall this is a wonderful place loaded with charm and originality. It has a old fashioned decor, done perfectly throughout the restaurant.   I will no doubt be returning here again and, again.   A little side note.. I did not give it 5 stars, simply and only because parking anywhere near the restaurant is difficult. So I would suggest you go by bus/metro(Subway) Try to avoid going there by car."}
{"text":"Super service, prix très abordables et plats/boissons de qualité (testez leur mojito!).  Par contre prévoyez de venir à l'ouverture ou après 21h. Entre les deux il faudra patienter looongtemps."}
{"text":"Intimate dinning environment with care put into every dish."}
{"text":"The chicken and French toast was amazing. The meal was a good portion and the music and atmosphere was friendly and refreshing. The prices are an added bonus."}
{"text":"It's fun to head over to L'Gros Luxe when you know you're in the mood for a coupla drinks and then some food and then moar drinks and then a desert. You know you'll be there for an hour or two but you're not feeling too rushed about it. It can get packed in a bit deep on occasion and if you have tinnitus (as I do), it's hard to hear everyone, but everything's pretty darn yum especially if you're in the mood for a grilled cheese sandwich and some bloody marys."}
{"text":"Le lieu est chouette, la nourriture est bonne, les cocktails sont tops et les prix raisonnable ! Il y a plusieurs options végétariennes !  Un bonne endroit pour sortir entre amis ou à 2 ! A essayer !   The place is great, the food is good, the cocktails are great and the price are reasonnable ! You can find few vegetarian options ! A nice place to go out with friends or in couple ! You should try it."}
{"text":"I was so looking forward to trying this place and I was not disappointed!  The bartenders were so nice and the service was fantastic.  I got sangria (yum) and my husband got a L'Gros Caesar (we were impressed).  We also got some pork sliders  which were also delicious.  We left full and happy!"}
{"text":"More of a simple menu, but done pretty well, great prices too! Portions depend on what you order, but order the right combination and you can leave with a full stomach and wallet at the same time. Also the ambiance and service were pretty good too."}
{"text":"We love it here. Yup, nuff said.   Fried pickles, L'Gros Luxe Poutine, Fish Tacos = happiness.  Great variety of cocktails + Draft Beers.  Fauna: from students, to couples, to guys that the only thing that they picked - up the last year(s) was a cold and try to get attention by being super loud. Get a grip dudes can't attract the ladies this way.  Of course we shall be back. We love it here!!"}
{"text":"Seriously best quick and amazing restaurant I've been to in a long time. My girlfriend had a meal and 2 drinks, I had a drink and 2 meals! The bill came out to 60$ with tip and tax which is super affordable. The Mac & Cheese was fantastic (9$), the burger was great too (8$), and my Bloody Caesar rocked."}
{"text":"Had to wait 40 mins after we had been told it would be about a 20 minute wait. But had the experience been worth it that would not have been a problem.  The good: Look: the place looks very good and welcoming. The staff are all trendy and so is the clientele.  Cocktails: ordered the Billy le Kid- amazing! Seriously worth 11$ and one of the best cocktails we've had in Montreal. But we also ordered the pickle... which was not so good, as it was lacking pickle.  Now for the bad: Service: service is very \"when and if we show up you must be ready to order, and good luck getting a water refill\"... Also feels rushed. We were seated at a table in the middle of the restaurant, where all the wait staff were passing, but we had to ask each and every time we wanted more water. Plus they kept hitting our jackets as they walked by. We actually ended up sliding our table out of the way.  Ambiance: it is way way too loud for a dinner type place. If this place wants to be a bar it should decide to be so, but right now it feels like its not sure whether its a bistro or a bar, and the loud drunk clients kind of ruin your dinner conversation.  Food: Honestly, had we not found a long blond hair in our deep fried pickles, the food would have been really good, and the place probably would have gotten 3 stars. But when you're paying 60$+ for a meal, you really expect better hygiene standards for the food. - The veggie burger was quite good, as were the onion rings - The poutine grilled cheese, was literally just poutine slabbed between two toasts.. Could have benefited from extra cheese.  All and all, will not be going back... 60$+ seems like a bit of a rip off.. and it's too bad because we really really wanted to like this place.   It has potential, it could be a five star bar, or a five star place for dinner, but because it's trying to be both... and is offering long blond hairs as unwanted garnish, it's a two-star disappointment...."}
{"text":"Plus gros que celui du plateau et aussi bon. Service rapide et confort food pas cher. Par contre, attendez-vous à attendre longtemps...On était 2 dimanche soir vers 8h et on a dû attendre 30 minutes :( Mais bon, ça vaut l'attente :)"}
{"text":"Endroit très sympa, cosy, ambiance chaleureuse et service toujours souriant et agréable! Large choix de bouffe et d'alcool aux prix très raisonnables. Les nachos sont super bonnes, les tacos aussi parait il, et les pichets de sangria pas pires non plus! (et pour 6$ de plus, tu peux doubler l'alcool dans ton pichet, ça vaut la peine!) C'est bien de s'informer des spéciaux car il y a des 5@7 en semaine et un spécial le dimanche soir par exemple. Belle place à découvrir si vous ne connaissez pas déjà!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for something casual and reliable lgros luxe is a great place to try. Their menu has a wide variety of items, including vegetarian options, that please most people. Their tacos are solid and I also love their starters. But be warned: not too many \"light\" options. Many dishes tend to be fried. They also have a fun cocktail menu which includes their famous Caesars which are a meal on their own!"}
{"text":"The music is awesome, the food is delicious and affordable. Go if you can! They don't take reservations. So first come first serve. I ordered the grilled cheese poutine. Sooooo gooooood."}
{"text":"One word : Busy! It was thursday around 7pm and already very loud and packed and dark in there. We managed to get two stools at the bar, less intimacy but you get the barman's barman-ing skills as a show while you wait and eat. Plus, the place is so loud and tables so close to each other, I don't think you get much intimacy anyway! Great cocktail and beer options and the menu is original while still pushing your comfort food buttons. We had the duck tacos and the naan-dog, both were tasty and filling and the price was quite good (each 9$ - served with fries) So sure, it's not the place to go when you want to be asocial and eat in a quiet and relaxed atmosphere but once in a while we all need a little bit of l'gros luxe!"}
{"text":"Great selection of fun comfort food type dishes at great prices with classy pub atmosphere. 20-something crowd but friendly to all ages. Lots of tasty vegetarian options. Great cocktail menu and good micro-brewery beers. Service is pub-grade but friendly. At these prices, this place is a no brainer for fun food and bevvies."}
{"text":"Great service from the staff. The Mac and cheese with Alfredo sauce and Italian sausages is a killer.   The Spicy Buffalo Fried Chicken Burger was tender but missed a bit of spiciness.   Overall I give it a 4 star."}
{"text":"My girl and I religiously went to gros luxe until a year ago. Stopped going after a brunch mishap at their notre dame location and expired avocado. Seems the more restos they open, the worse the quality of food, specially the burger, used to be fantastic, now dry bun, dry meat, etc. Tried again last night and again, dry everything, barely any taste, sad, smaller burger, bigger bun. Long gone is the food that the St.andre local became quickly famous for, thanks for the memories"}
{"text":"Bon restau, bonne ambiance jeune et cool! Manque un peu d'originalité sur les déjeuners. Cocktails au top!"}
{"text":"Id say more style than substance. This isn't really my thing as I don't find it's \"real\" food. Everything tastes frozen or from a packet. It's got a fun vibe and the cocktails are good (Caesars). I'd go with a large group who wanted a snack and a bite to have with drinks rather than a gastronomic experience. Maybe like a work leaving party/ birthday thing. Very meh."}
{"text":"I came to L'Gros Luxe without knowing what to expect (reviews are mixed)... this is what my experience felt like:  Pros :  - L'Gros Club Sandwich was really good. Lots of authentic white meat chicken with fresh ingredients. Solid sandwich. This however was my 2nd choice as I first opted for the chicken bahn mi but they were out of baguettes? Anyways, I upgraded my side of fries to onion rings. They were very tasty and done right.  Not-Pros :  - As mentioned above, out of baguettes!  - The potion size of my onion rings were pretty economical. They were under the rim of the onion ring bowl.... I did not find the price tag economical however. So please.... beef up your side portions please. This is important.  - I had the ice cream with cookie dough for dessert. Sadly the cookie dough wasn't warm enough to give you that sexy hot and cold dessert excitement everyone craves each and every day of their lives. Simply put, it was ice cream with less cold cookie dough. It did take a significant amount of time for our dessert to be given to us... so maybe it was sitting on a counter for awhile? Either way, it was OK but the plate missed its mark.  - We opted for the Bourbon lemonade and it was mediocre. Not terrible per say but definitely not the best I've had. Wouldn't opt for it again if I'd go back.  - Service was friendly but very busy. Our dining experience dragged on as we waited and waited. They could have used an extra hand or two to get the tables going.  Overall it was ok but I don't find myself coming here again any time soon."}
{"text":"Es ist kein Restaurant, keine reine Bar und irgendwie auch kein Café. Die Frage bleibt was ist es denn nun?   Da der Laden gut besucht ist und die Atmosphäre irgendwie ansprechend wirkte kehrten wir zum Abendessen im L'Gros Luxe ein.   Dir Karte war sehr übersichtlich und die Preise erstaunlich günstig. Es gab drei Salate zur Auswahl, ein paar unterschiedliche Burger und verschiedene Taco Chips sowie vier Hauptgerichte. Wir entschieden uns für einen Salat mit Melone, Feta Käse, Gurken und Tomaten und für einen einfachen Burger mit Salat.  Als mein Salat serviert wurde war mir klar warum dieser nur 7 Dollar kostete. Ich bin kein großer Esser aber nach drei Gabeln voll war der Teller leer und der Hunger blieb.  Es dauerte dann ca. eine halbe Stunde nachdem ich meine drei Gabeln von dem durchaus köstlichen Salat gegessen hatte, bis meine Begleitung den Burger serviert bekam.  Fazit: Kein Speiselokal! Die Punkte gibt es für den freundlichen Service, die Atmosphäre und die sehr schmackhaften drei Gabeln voll Salat. :-)"}
{"text":"Ordered the porc burgers and onion rings. Both were really delicious (the pulled porc burgers were better than the pulled porc tacos, which I had the time before). Also got the mango cocktail and the st Patrick's day shot special, and both were also really nice. Service was good too."}
{"text":"Food Is excellent. You must get a bloody  Caesar. They allow you to add on entrées on top of the drink!  Hard to describe, but very cool.  A nice upbeat atmosphere and dynamic service.   I had the club, which was excellent. The spinach salad and fries were also very good.   The service is a little bit slow, and the staff is overwhelmed if you come on a busy night, but it is not slow enough to make it a serious issue."}
{"text":"Just fantastic. I'm from the South in the USA so I can really appreciate some BBQ pulled pork. They REALLY deliver. With tater tots and egg and a generous helping of the slow cooked pork. The mushroom variation is just as good, in fact.  The Caesar menu is a real treat too!  Some of the best food I've had on my visit!"}
{"text":"What more can be said about good poutine. Great meal, excellent service with an awesome soundtrack! Friendly and very helpful staff. Recommendations were spot on and food was amazing! Definitely stop in."}
{"text":"Nice to have another option in the area, and a fun one at that with the crazy layered Ceasars and the weirdly, surprisingly delicious deep fried avocado. The room is warm and cozy and almost disturbingly trendy, and nicely laid out in two smaller rooms for additional intimacy. The bartender makes a tasty hot Jameson chocolate if you're looking for something sweet and cozy. A weird fit for the Mile End but I'll go with a-ok."}
{"text":"YUM!  Great brunch restaurant in Le Plateau.  I came here on a Saturday morning with my friend who lives in Montreal.  I'm an American and an Anglophone, so I was very appreciative when they offered me an English menu.  I ordered a cappuccino and my friend ordered a non-alcoholic ginger beer to calm his stomach from the night before (haha).  Both were excellent.  For brunch, my friend ordered the Classic with smoked salmon.  The Classic includes 2 eggs, toast, breakfast potatoes, and fruit for 7.  You may add meat to your breakfast for 2-3.  That's a great deal!   I ordered the Benedict Poutine with sausage, but I received (and was charged for) the steak.  My Francophone friend confirmed that my French was correct when I ordered sausage and not steak, but honestly this error really worked out in my favor because the steak was DELICIOUS.  It was absolutely fantastic.  I have no regrets.  I felt no need to tell my server about the mishap.  My favorite part about this restaurant (other than the scrumptious steak) was the charming outdoor garden.  I loved eating outside.  The atmosphere was quiet and relaxing.  There were very few guests for a Saturday morning.  It was very peaceful.  I most definitely recommend eating here!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant, was lucky to find free parking on avenue de lesplanade near, took nacho tater tot was really great and portion was very generous. The fried dough for dessert is very good too. A good place to come with friends ans share some food. Staff very friendly!"}
{"text":"I went with a friend shortly after they opened to test it out. We were both pretty disappointed in the food. The fried avocado was too much (like fried butter! sounds amazing, but was too heavy) and our beet salad contained very little actual beet. It all tasted good, but nothing that would bring us back. We both ordered wine, which seemed to confound our server a little. To be fair, this seems like more of a cocktail place than a wine place. The wine list was very short. All of the staff were super friendly, but seemed inexperienced. The very nice busboy spilled water all over us and knocked our cutlery to the floor, and was very apologetic, but failed to reappear. Nice staff, but lacked in service."}
{"text":"I'm going to keep this short and sweet. The service here is the killer. The food isn't bad, nice options . The service is horrible. Period"}
{"text":"Not expensive and quality food. However, it was really crowded (for a Sunday night) which made the service pretty slow and the waiter looked a bit exhausted. I had the pulled pork tacos... Yummy! Most dishes are in small portions so it is made for different types of appetite. I would recommend for people who are not in a rush, slightly hungry and who want to spend time in a restaurant with busy but trendy ambiance."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed l'gros luxe. The prices were more than fair for the fresh&delicious food and great drinks. When I went they did not accept reservations so there was a bit of a wait but it wasn't too long. They have a great selection of Bloody Caesars and you can even order them accompanied by appetizers such as sliders, onion rings or egg rolls as their garnish! Their menu offers a variety of options from healthy to junk food so you will be able to accommodate different tastes if going there as a group. My personal favourite splurge there is the poutine grilled cheese , yes you read that correctly , POUTINE GRILLED CHEESE! And it's every bit as delicious as it sounds :) it's a must try. The service was very warm and friendly and the decor was laid back and comfortable but still with a fun energetic vibe."}
{"text":"Great restaurant at an even greater price. I've been coming here for years and the service is always good. Fun decor and atmosphere.  I'm a creature of habit so I basically get a few dishes and rotate each time I come. The grilled cheeses are good and the side salad it comes with is delicious. The chicken burger is also delicious. My absolute favourite dish is the general tao chicken wings, which are incredible. The drinks are excellent and it's a wonderful place for a date or night out with friends. The only thing that I would say the restaurant is lacking is space. The tables are really close together and there is usually a wait near dinner time (they don't take reservations) Otherwise, I love going here and I really recommend."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great ambiance... Will come back when I'm in town again.  We ate here for brunch and I'm glad that we did... The potions were average size, I'm bigger and prefer bigger portions but other than that I like the feel and the food and service was great."}
{"text":"J'avais le goût d'attendre un peu avant de donner mon avis sur L'Gros Luxe. D'attendre que la folie de la nouveauté passe. Voir ce qu'il est resterait. Après plusieurs essais, soirées, brunch et café, je suis fin prête à donner mon avis !  Le concept est vraiment super : on en a pour notre argent, il y a quand même du choix et pas mal de bonnes surprises (+1000 aux frites d'avocat, MIAM !). Je préfère mille fois le local sur Bernard que celui du plateau : plus de gueule, plus typique. Et le service est vraiment cool quand on voit le monde qu'il y a à chaque fois !  Par contre bof pour le brunch... Le végé est super bon, mais très souvent on a encore faim après notre plat. Bonne idée pour faire consommer la clientèle mais avoir faim après son brunch, c'est vraiment dommage. Puis certains plats sont vraiment limités (le brunch traditionnel : ajouter un morceau de bacon ou des beans n'appauvrirait pas le plat, loin de là !). Le seul avantage d'aller bruncher au Gros Luxe c'est que pour une fois, on peut s'entendre parler.   Bref, j'adore les nouveaux concepts, mais les endroits à la mode peuvent aussi vite s'essouffler. A bon entendeur !"}
{"text":"D'abord, la place. Superbe ! Ok c'est faussement \"chic mais super grave à la cool\". On s'en fout là, c'est super joli ! Ensuite, le service. Top. On prend le temps de t'expliquer les cocktails. On te presse pas (ou pas trop, c'est subtil). Sont cools et beaux ici ! Pour boire, il faut manger. A que cela ne tienne, carte avec choix et pour pas cher, et puis c'est bon ! Miam miam la salade thaie, les burgers, les tacos... Pour 6dollars, on fait pas se gêner !  Et les cocktails... Liste extensive. Originaux. Petits. Un peu chers. On peut pas être parfait de toute façon ;)"}
{"text":"Beautiful restaurant, great cocktails. The service was great. The food however, felt a bit short, hence my 3 stars. It wasn't bad, but it felt a bit ordinary.  I had the special grill cheese with fries, and my girlfriend took the club sandwich. I think the fries is probably one of the item that would be worth big time to be improved. They tasted like run-of-the-mill frozen fries.  It is, however, a pretty good value for its price. I wouldn't mind going back if my friends asked, but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"I love the vibe of this place. The menu is small but has all the right comfort food with a clever twist. Oh, did I  mention that it's very affordable. Yes, finally a hip place that doesn't over charge for everything. I loved the grill cheese with pulled pork (special ordered) the fish tacos, and the poutine with sweet patatoes. ..mmmm delish. We've dinned here a couple of times and sampled some of the clever drinks they cook up. Ask he waiter to reccomend something and dive right in. Last visit we were 3, ordered dinner and a pitcher of burbon lemonade for under 20$ per person."}
{"text":"Superb neighborhood cocktail bar with friendly servers, awesome ambience, best poutine we ha had in Montreal."}
{"text":"The breakfast poutine and Caesar are amazing! How do they get such great flavor from a vegetable gravy?!"}
{"text":"When looking for breakfast, it's the core elements that matter: good food, cheap prices (actually shocking for chain breakfast places in the city), fast and friendly service, and bottles of Valentina at every table. L'Gros Luxe nails them all. Sure the decor is all upcycled hipster aspirations trying way too hard, but it's a surefire Sunday morning success."}
{"text":"$25 mimosa pitchers and brunch plates under ten bucks? Um. Yes please.  My partner and I both ordered the fried chicken- it was great and the perfect portion size. Pro tip: get a side of tater tots. It's not formally on the menu as a side but they do it.  The staff were very jolly and relatively attentive despite being rather busy. I could however see that other folks in the resto were not getting the prompt service they wanted. The waiters joking demeanor with us could also be attributed to the fact that it was noon and we were already throwing back mimosas like we were in on some impending global bubbly and OJ shortage.  I'll just say it: the hipster decor is over-done in a way that only made me laugh, but hell, I'll deal with it if the drink and food are gonna stay this delicious and this affordable."}
