{"text":"Amazing fondue! A great place to go with a group of friends for an evening out or to celebrate an occasion. The three-course taster menu, with cheese fondue, fondue chinoise, and a dessert course of chocolate fondue, is to die for. Bring a big appetite!

Service isn't particularly speedy, and the interior decor could use a bit of a refresher. That's the reason why I didn't give this place five stars. However, it would merit them on the food alone."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, my first ever Yelp review is in response to perhaps the worst dining experience I have ever had; which is saying something, considering I've probably averaged 200+ restaurant meals per year over the past 11 years. 

If this review was about the food, I'd have given it 3 stars - not great, not terrible. We had originally gone to this neighborhood to have some poutine at a neighboring establishment, but there was a significant outdoor wait in -20 Celsius weather, so we came here.  Perhaps the wait would have been a more comfortable experience.  

My wife and I both ordered the \"Chinese\" style fondue - hers with chicken, mine with thinly sliced beef.  The sauces they gave us were just OK.  The cooking is up to you, the consumer, so you need to be careful or you may over or under cook your food.  The cooking broth was nicely spiced.  

But the \"service\" we received was poor, bordering on hostile. I think the waitress was annoyed that we didn't order alcoholic drinks or upgrade to the \"feast\" option with our meal. After ordering, my wife asked our waitress for a water refill and then waited about 7-10 minutes before we saw her again.  We continued to wait for our food without our her checking in on us, until we flagged her down so that we could each get a refill of water.....we waited again for the food and the water (probably another 10 minutes) and I repeatedly made eye contact with this waitress, hoping she would at least bring us the water.  But she ignored us, while she tended to other customers....mind you, the water was sitting on a table 7 feet away, but it would be rude/inappropriate to fetch our own water, so we didn't. 

When she finally served us our water and the meat (but not the cooking broth) portion of the meal she was extremely curt when I asked if she knew when the broth would arrive.  

Anyway, eventually the broth did arrive and we had an OK meal, but by that point our dinner had been pretty much spoiled.  We would have ordered two portions of their probably delicious, but overpriced ($10) chocolate fondue and given her a nice tip had our experience been different. Throughout this ordeal, my wife and I were completely polite and did not say anything cross to our waitress, so I seriously don't get why we were treated the way we were being treated.

Alas, we asked for our check and got a somewhat hostile explanation that we couldn't put a gratuity on our credit card.  It's just as well, because it made it easier to leave her a $1 cash tip that was probably $1 too much, and a note about the hostile service."}
{"text":"We came with friends from out of town who wanted to try proper fondue. 
First off, the service was a miss. There's one lady trying to take care of literally all the tables. The only help was another hostess who ended up screaming at my 1 year old for making too much noise. She's lucky I didn't pull her to the side to tell her off!!!!
Secondly, the fondue was delicious but the bread was old and the fruit that accompanied the chocolate fondue was a joke (1 banana and little bits of other fruits).
Thirdly, the deco was also pretty poor."}
{"text":"Couldn't even rate the food because we were turned away with our group of 11 people. The hostess/waitress said she was only one person working on a Monday evening so she cannot take us. She's not able to handle it. This is the second time in Montreal we were turned away with a group of 11 people."}
{"text":"We made reservations for this place and when we got there, our table wasn't ready. We had to wait 10mins for our table. Once we were seated, we waited for 30mins and nobody served us even after repeatedly asking for service!! We walked out. Also the place looked a little dirty."}
{"text":"great little French style place. We got cheese and chocolate fondue. My advise - get only one order of each, it's a lot of cheese and chocolate to share. Very nice and romantic."}
{"text":"Le serveur était sympatique. Bel ambiance. Nous avons tres bien mangé!"}
{"text":"I would rate it 0 stars if that was an option for the following:
situation a- the service was awful. we were made fun of and ignored when we had questions about the menu. 
situation b- we weren't looking for a big meal and just wanted a bunch of appetizers. however, it's not an option. you have to order a $25+ meal to stay. 
situation c- if you share a meal with someone you have to pay $9 for just sharing + how much the meal is. 
situation d- my friend knocked over a painting but it was quite funny. 
situation e- we walked out and waited in line for poutine."}
{"text":"We picked this restaurant based off reviews and were extremely disappointed. Food was mediocre but the service and experience that follows is why I will not be returning. 

At one point they brought out another pot of fondue and set it on the table along with bread and olives which we began to eat... 60 seconds later the waiter came back laughed, apologized, and said that wasn't meant for us then walked three steps before giving it to another table!! The other waitress then came out and keeled over laughing. We had already begun to eat the fondue!! 

For context, we ordered the entre/appetizer two-person size and a raclette and shared with 3. We were just discussing whether to get more when the 'second pot' came out so we erroneously thought that maybe the portions were large and they served each separately. In hindsight it was a bad assumption but we received the same dish and there's no reference point for portion size. 

Aside from taking food away somewhat rudely, giving it to someone else was extremely gross and the fact that they laughed openly is rather indicative of their general standards."}
{"text":"Food is simply fabulous as is the service. Everything was super fresh and of the finest quality.

I was given a Groupon coupon. Groupon messed up and did not print the promotional menu with the offer. When I arrived I'd already decided what I wanted to try off the regular menu. Upon being seated found the set menu; I immediately brought to the server's attention that the coupon did not state a preset menu. He explained how they'd provided the menu and it was Groupon's error but he would do his utmost to accommodate me & he did. We ended up half off the preset and regular menu.

We spent a comfortable and leisurely 2.5 hours to eat our meal and were thoroughly impressed. Everything was delicious and the amount of food was more than sufficient. The service was attentive without being sticky.

We left a 20% tip and vowed we'd return.

A bit pricey."}
{"text":"I tried the wild game fondue. It had guinea fowl, bison, kangaroo and wapiti. It apparently changes from time to time. Guinea fowl doesn't taste too different from chicken. Kangaroo was definitely different and I can't compare it to anything I've had before. Most of the raw meats were plain except for one which had some peppercorn seasoning. Cooking it in the fondue was pretty straight-forward and didn't take long. The Chinese style soup broth was tame and unremarkable. The dipping sauces were the opposite, distinct with a nice variety. There is a fair amount of space in the restaurant. It maybe deserves a bit more than a 3 star rating although I'm not sure I'd come here for only more common meats. The game meat is not cheap but worth a try. Also had an ice cream sundae, nothing special but fine."}
{"text":"Very fun experience. It was our family's first time dining at a fondue restaurant. We were very pleased with our experience and the service was great! The price for the cheese fondue was more pricy than we would've expected. The melted cheese raclette was 20$ and the sampling chinoise was 23$ (only a 3$ difference for an entree compared to a cheese appetizer). If you're looking to save a few bucks, then it would be best to skip the cheese fondue and go straight for the entree options. The gimlet cocktail was very nice and refreshing. The chocolate fondue with fresh fruits was very tasty and a perfect way to end our meal."}
{"text":"Le service est excellent, courtois

Un peu (beaucoup) cher pour les plats. J'aurais aimé être plus impressionnée par mon assiette"}
{"text":"Une bonne adresse pour se faire une fondue sucrée ou salée, en couple ou entre amis.
Les fondues sont vraiment excellentes
Les prix sont ok, un tout petit peu chers je dirai
On peut y réserver une grande table pour célébrer un événement
Super l'hiver pour se réchauffer!
Pas mal pour sortir autour aussi, car bien situé sur le Plateau"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining here on the weekend and it was great!  The service was a bit slow but the food was excellent.  I would definitely recommend!

If you are driving, make sure you leave yourself lots of time to find parking.  Nearly every street around there is permit only, but the restaurant will help you find a spot if you can't find one on your own."}
{"text":"Excellent! We ordered \"the feast\" which included cheese fondue, salad, main course and chocolate fondue. Prices about $40/per person (for the feast).  Recommend a reservation for a large party. Overall, we were really happy with the experience and our meal."}
{"text":"We happened upon this cozy , quiet place during a night when the temp was about 10 degrees Fahrenheit. We were going to try a place across the street that was Portuguese but the line was out the door- people crazy enough to stand outside- we said \"no way: to that and the place across the street famous for its poutine with a line of what looked like millennials out the door  and saw the sign for La Fonderie.  Given the cold we dashed across the street and were warmly welcomed. The staff was cordial and attentive. We did appetizer and the basic fondue and it was delicious and satisfying. A great find."}
{"text":"Très ordinaire pour le prix. Pas mauvais du tout mais rien de special. ATTENTION AUX ALLERGIES, la fondue au chocolat contient des noix et ce n'est pas indiqué sur le menu. Nous avons evité la catastrophe de justesse meme si nous avions deja mentionné l'allergie en debut de repas!!!"}
{"text":"This was fabulous, plain and simple. Get the Wild Game fondue... ours had kangaroo. You read that right, KANGAROO. 

We split two different fondue dishes since I had never had fondue before and we couldn't decide which to get. It was more food than I've ever had in one sitting and I regret nothing of my gluttony! 

Absolutely order the \"feast\", the English menu writeup doesn't do it justice. You get: cheese fondue + bread (amazing), garlic toast, a salad, \"all you can eat\" roasted potatoes and dipping sauces, your fondue dinner, and a dessert which is any dessert on the menu or chocolate fondue.

We got two of the pre fixe options- the Fondue de La Fonderie, which is 3 or 4 pieces of everything, and the Wild Game dish, and just split it all between two of us. The meats were great, everything was delicious. The Wild Game was the best, it came with bison, guinea fowl, and.... KANGAROO!  Folks, we had kangaroo fondue! And yes, it was outstanding! I thought for sure they would skimp on the kangaroo because it's probably expensive, but that was actually the meat with the biggest portion on that dish. Fond-aroo is pretty awesome. 

This is a fun dinner for a big group or even just a date for two. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The cheese fondu was delectable.    First time trying Nguyen cheese fondue with tomato and garlic.   The chocolate fondue sides were very tasty."}
{"text":"I would totally come back here to try the three course fondue extravaganza, I missed out on the cheese and chocolate courses this time and I still regret it. They also do raclette, which if you haven't had you absolutely should try here while in town, but if you live in Montreal you probably have a raclette plate at home and can do epic feasts for less without taking off your house pants. 

The \"Chinese style\" broth fondue was tasty but the broth could have been much more flavourful. I tried the first-timer melange of meats and seafood, which is a great way to go if you feel like a bit of everything, but the filet mignon and the salmon were the definite highlights. 

Service was friendly, not rushed but timely, the decor is warm and the art not bad at all. The tables are nicely spaced, and the lighting and colouring is warm and yellowy, and reminiscent of cheese. Ideal."}
{"text":"Premièrement, je dois dire que j'ai toujours eu un biais envers les restaurants à fondue, ils n'accotent jamais mes attentes comparées à la version maison. Dans le cas de La Fonderie, malheureusement, ce fut le cas. 

J'avais un forfait cadeau, donc je ne suis pas certains des prix. Le prix du vin n'était pas bon marché, mais dans les normes. Le bouillon était bon et de bonne qualité, des pommes de terre frites et 5 sauces étaient offertes, je crois à volonté. La quantité de viande offerte était suffisante, mais pour de la fondue je m'attardais à de l'excès. Donc suffisamment satisfait de la fondue chinoise comme telle.

Par contre, vraiment déçue de la fondue au chocolat offerte en dessert. Le chocolat avait le goût d'un chocolat périmé ou vraiment de piètre qualité.  

Je crois que l'expérience en vaut le coup si vous voulez de la fondue sans les tracas. Je me laisserais peut-être tenter une autre fois pour la fondue au fromage."}
{"text":"I just love fondue. I come here when its ALL YOU CAN EAT for one price. You can actually spend hours at this place talking, eating. Its lots of fun. Don't come here with older generation people since some do not enjoying cooking their own food at a restaurant. I had a horrible experience with that. Note that if you are really hungry, this is not the place for you. It takes time for the food to cook, and before your satisfied you will be at McDonalds getting a meal.

The staff is friendly, and the restaurant is clean. Make reservations just in case they have lots of people enjoying there fondue dinner."}
{"text":"It's pricey, even though I went on a Tuango deal, but so far it's the most delicious fondue Ive had in the city. 

Definitely a great fondue-for-two for people in relationships. I dont know about eating lots of cheese on a first date though, so Im referring to seasoned lovers lol.

The chocolate dessert fondue is romantic for all levels of intimacy though!"}
{"text":"Great fondue!  Quality meat (try the wild game), rich chocolate and delicious cheese.  Way better than anything in the states."}
{"text":"I wrote a review about this place 4 months ago but deleted my account .. I gave this place a 5 star previously .. And then I decided to re-visit it yesterday (on a Sunday)! Unfortunately this time was not what I expected.. Extremely disappointed.. I'm stuck giving it a 2.5 .. But there's no .5 stars.. 
The Atmosphere this time was ultra dead.. And maybe Ill try to explain why! 

Ok the BIG BUMMER... They changed the menu! The menu use to include the huge festin where everything was included (choice of soup or salad/ cheese fondu/choice of Chinese or bourgonne oil meat fondue/ and desert chocolate fondue) and you could even share the portions with everyone on the table. Now they eliminated this concept that they were known for.. Now you got to order everything separately which was really dreadful.. We ordered meli melo ( came with beef, chicken, scampi and scallops but we weren't able to order the bourginione oil fondue because we would have to order everything seperately-.- what the hell??? We had to choose the Chinese broth.. And I already had that last time and didn't like it. The desert was not included so we passed that one up. Food was not great this time.
I ordered a piña colada but i felt like I was drinking pure Rum!! Yuck it was way too strong and asked to have it re-made but it still was very very strong! Not impressed at all.

The service was a disaster but it was not the lady's fault! She was super sweet and caring it was her first day and she took forever to get our bread for the cheese fondue .. Grrr she brought our salad at the same time as the meats .. Which is a big no no.. She kept coming back to ask us what we ordered because she was super confused. 
She dropped an entire bread bowl on the floor in front of us.. No wonder they are charging us extra for everything they keep losing money with her wasting all the food on the floor.
Service was very slow and unprofessional.

Overall, this was a big disappointment ! I am never coming back unfortunately."}
{"text":"Not bad. Nothing horrendously special but still a good time. The meat was very fresh and tasty, the steamboat broth was rather plain and didn't transfer to the meat much, but the sauce plate was fun and tasty.

It is a long meal, however, so make sure you have plenty of time and are in no rush!

It was a nice experience but nothing made me think \"oh yeah\""}
{"text":"If you're a fan of fondue, this is a great place to visit. As someone who never really has tried genuine fondue at a restaurant it was certainly an entertaining meal.

La Fonderie is compact resto, so space can be precious but it's pretty decor makes up for it... so ultimately they've managed to to create an intimate environment that are great for dates as well as group outings. At the end of the meal, I'd definitely lean more on the group thing.

Their menu was a bit difficult to fully comprehend so we asked the waiter for our options, he expertly and very nicely given us some great options. He probably gets this A LOT. I ultimately went with their \"Maitre-Boucher\" \"Feast meal\" which consisted of a :

1. Entrée of Swiss Cheese Fondue
2. House or Caesar Salad with their Famous Toasted Garlic Bread (I went with Caesar!)
3. Chinese or Bourguignonne Fondue of your Choice (I went with Chinese! With Filet Mignon of Beef, Chicken Breast, Filet of Porc and Marinated Lamb!)
4. Choice of Dessert or Dessert-Coffee (I went with their Fruits!)
5. Regular Coffee or Tea or Herb Tea (I went with Regular Coffee!)

The Swiss cheese fondue was very good, the bread that came it was addicting to say the least. I'm glad to report that no cheese remained and we had to push away those evil bread bites as far from us as possible.

The Caesar salad was only OK, the salad was alright but the dressing was flavorless and watery. The Garlic Bread was ONCE AGAIN there to entice me. WHY MUST YOU TASTE SO GOOD BREAD?  WHY?! SHOO!

The meat was served in 2 beautiful platters with a nice variety of sauces that you can dip them in. I really liked this experience but as we ate it seemed to drag on. This might be more enjoyable with a group of people who can chat profusely while the meat cooks slowly in the bouillon/fondue. The meats were fresh, looked great and tasted amazing. The variety of sauces were good and refills were easy to get.

My fondue dessert consisted of a few fruits like bananas, pineapples, strawberries and the such in a small pot of delicious chocolate. I believe I found a new love of bananas in hot chocolate. OH MAMA!

The regular coffee was upgrade to a cappuccino and it was good.

Our waiter was friendly and very attentive to us, I believe when we told him we were on a date night while our daughter was back home being babysat he went out of his way to be very accommodating. Nothing but praise here folks!

The price-tag is pretty expensive, so this may not be something I'd do very often unless it's for a special event. I'd recommend to try this place at least once.

A few bad notes. We waited 15 minutes when we came in, we had reservations but no one was manning the hostess desk. So our table sat unattended all this time. Oh and another note, the parking was difficult to find say the least. I had to make a spot with my SUV at the far end of the parking lot."}
{"text":"Been going to this fondue restaurant for years and years. Every time we visit Montreal, easily a dozen times in 20 years. 

I'd normally rate this restaurant a 5, but with the retirement of the owner, it may have slipped a tiny, tiny bit. Bound to happen, though on our visit the 4 stars could have easily been a 5, just the familiar face was gone. 

Normal fondue, nicely prepared -- from the cheese to the Caesar salad to the beef and chicken fondue in sesame oil to the chocolate fondue to close things out. Real good. 

In general, I've never known fondue not to be a tad pricey, this place not unlike the others. But tucked on Rachel, I've always found it to be worth every penny."}
{"text":"Service was lacking but quantity and quality of food was perfect.  Very much a mid range resto with a good mix of food!"}
{"text":"Super bonne première expérience! J'y suis allée grâce à la soirée organisée par Érik M, et j'étais vraiment contente de faire la découverte d'un bon resto à fondue. Je trouve que c'est souvent meilleure de faire une fondue à la maison, mais pour se sauver du trouble d'organiser le tout et de faire la vaisselle ça en vaut vraiment la peine. J'ai pris l'assiette de \"La Première\" qui a un peu de tout et c'est une bonne idée pour voir ce que l'on aime le plus, ou quand on a de la difficulté à faire un choix. Quoi? Moi? Pas capable de choisir?  ;) Le service est super chaleureux et notre serveur était bien attentif. C'est un bon resto pour un rendez-vous à deux, un souper de famille ou une sortie relaxe entre amis."}
