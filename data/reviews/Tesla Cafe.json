{"text":"Overpriced food and bad service! Will NOT go back to this (very white) hipster joint!"}
{"text":"All I can say is wow, the food is outstanding for the price point, good sized portions and a lot of thought went into the creation of the flavours.  I have had the braised rib poutine, the pork belly sandwich and the fried chicken sandwich so far and have been blown away by the quality.  They have a great selection of local craft beers and even some imports (if you're into that type of thing!).  The backyard patio is so nice and cozy with little candles on the tables, and inside it's gonna be great when the weather gets colder as it's all wooden saloon style (it actually has saloon doors!).  This one will become a Koreatown favourite in time, get there before you have to wait for a table :-)"}
{"text":"I was on my way to somewhere else in The Annex when I spotted this place just off Bloor St., and being a bit of a science geek I had to check it out. Boy, am I glad I did, because this place is a gem. They have a small, but excellent, choice of craft beers on tap. The menu isn't extensive either but it all looks interesting. I had the Pork Belly BLT, because I cannot say no to pork belly, and my partner had the hamburger. Both were excellent. The hamburger was cooked to order, which thrilled my partner (who doesn't like well done) to no end. The tiny deep fried pickles on top were also a real treat. My sandwich was juicy and perfectly salty, and the french fries were wonderful. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"I was in Toronto visiting and heard about this great new pub/restaurant on Euclid. Had dinner there with a friend last Tuesday.  We ate inside as the patio was full.  Not surprising as the patio is really inviting - clean, lovely greenery and private.  Inside was quiet with comfortable seating at gorgeous wooden tables.  The food and service was terrific.  We had the calamari with a beet salad and brussel sprout salad to start.  Amazing!!!  Then my friend ordered the pork belly BLAT and I had the Cobb burger.  Both were incredible.  The best food I have had in a long time.  Kudos to the chef!  The bartender, owner and server were helpful, knowledgeable and friendly.  Will definitely return on my next visit to Toronto.  Recommend highly."}
{"text":"This place is great! Delicious hamburger, great service and really relaxed atmosphere. Love the back patio too!"}
{"text":"Tesla Cafe...7 people had dinner excellent, thoughtful preparation of food by the chef. We had calamari with Chinese  5 spice powder, fried pickles, the best Cobb burger ever with just the right amount of blue cheese, superb Brussels sprout/ bacon salad, an extremely tasty veggie burger , roasted beet salad and grilled cheese made especially for our 3 year old companion. Superb ambience, excellent dark and stormies made with a specially brewed local ginger beer. The bartender/ server is extremely knowledgeable about the food/ drink. They have been opened 2.5 weeks go before you won't be able to get a seat."}
{"text":"Cute new pub, great back patio and friendly staff. Menu is traditional and great local breweries on tap."}
{"text":"I've been to Tesla four times now, and I've enjoyed my visit each time. The food is well-made and good value, and the drink selection is excellent. The staff are welcoming and endearing. Will be coming back many times in the future!"}
{"text":"Excellent service - waiters are very friendly and hospitable. The ambiance and space is quaint with a great patio at the back. Food and drink are reasonably priced. A must try is their Brussels sprouts!"}
{"text":"Very nice place, great food (I had the pork belly BLAT), good beer, fair prices, friendly and welcoming staff. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Wow, I'm so glad I stumbled upon this gem in the Annex. We saw a sign on bloor, good thing they had one out or we would have never even noticed it.   I've been here twice so far, and everything has been amazing. I really love chick peas --and in love with their house roasted chick peas they give you when you sit down.   They're burgers are sooo good. Like, scrumptiously delicious. Super fat and moist on the inside. My just regular burger came with these little deep fried pickles! What a great touch!   Second time I came I had the short rib poutine. The red wine gravy was incredible. I wasn't expecting it to come with so much meat but was greatly impressed. I think it could be in a large bowl rather than a plate though.   My partner had the fried chicken sandwich and he really enjoyed it. It was quite spicy and super moist inside.   My mouth is watering right now, be right back, going to Tesla."}
