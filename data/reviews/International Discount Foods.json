{"text":"Just bought one of their pastries that was labelled chicken and as I was eating it not only did it taste like shit but there was mould growing all over the fucking thing!!! I'm so disgusted! I went back to show the cashier and she was very apologetic and tried to give me my $2 back. I told her I don't care about the $2, how is $2 going to undo the mould in my stomach? 
So gross, please avoid this horrible place!"}
{"text":"Stopped into the IDF today for a look around. To my pleasure this international food store had an awesome selection of foods from Russia, Germany, Switzerland, Romania, Israel and other locations. They had fresh baked breads, lavash and pita as well as baked goods from cakes to nut rolls. 

In the back they had a deli with fresh meats, fish and the largest pre cooked deli options I've seen. They had salads, eggplant, veggies to the cooked meat from chicken in various styles from baked, breaded and stuffed to fish and pork. 

I tried their cauliflower and peppers which were to die for. They were cooked perfectly and didn't have a bland taste that some frozen cauliflower has. I also opted for their potatoes and mushrooms with onions. Perfectly boiled with a nice buttery taste without being overly greasy.

The carrot salad with raisins was the best I've had. Oh, and I can't forget the eggplant with peppers which was also cooked perfectly. 

My favorite surprise was the stuffed cabbage rolls. This was full of ground chicken, rice and carrots. No thick tomato sauce some places give you but a nice mild thin sauce that flavored the cabbage. It was cooked perfectly and was a pleasure for my taste buds. 

Anyone in the mood for great food, a wonderful baked good or an adventure down the aisle to try a little something of an international taste IDF is the place to go. I'll sure be back."}

To begin with, there is  the greatest selection of smoked fish I have been this side of New York. They are all there, mostly unknown to be, but looking delicious. They also feature a great delicatessen counter with many head cheeses and more 'serious' cold cuts, from cold climates.

The also have a great assortment of imported sweets, and in November they bring in a great and inexpensive chocolate dipped marzipan loaf. I have it on good authority that for under $ 2.00, this is the best marzipan loaf you can buy comrade.

They also feature a full selection of canned fish. I was lucky enough, one time, to buy fish balls in tomato sauce, which the Ukrainian part of the family just loved. But unfortunately most of the labels are in Cyrillic and that makes it difficult to divine what the wondrous package contain. There is one item that was clearly marked that I bought and neither I nor the dog could consume: sprat pate. This would have made the worse cat food taste great. It is made of the odd bits of smoked sprats (a kind of sardine), that have been mashed together to a grey gooey consistency. 

I did buy 1l. of nectar (on spec), and it turned out to be plum nectar and was really tasty. They have a great great line up of imported jams, jellies and cookies. In most cases you have to go by colour and the drawing on the label.

For those of you really nostalgic about the old country they have a large selection of health and beauty aids (shampoos, soaps, lotions, creams, etc.). When you couple that with a great selection of Russian and Baltic teas, you have a winning combination.

Come stroll the aisles, close your eyes, and imagine yourself at GUM. No this it better!"}
