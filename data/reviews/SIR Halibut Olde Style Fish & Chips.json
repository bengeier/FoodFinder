{"text":"Food was good. Fast service. Mostly a fish and hip place. Would go back for fries and birch beer!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is an Angus Landmark. Many Restaurants have come and gone-this one stands the test of time. Food is good. Down home type of food which is what people are looking for in small towns. Fries are freshly cut, gigantic portions. Best in their class. Fish is equally as good. Owner always has chocolate treats and other goodies to hand out. Don't leave Angus without eating at this place."}
{"text":"Food has potential....but the place felt uncomfortable and needs some help!  The place would be ideal for take out...to dine in you're surrounded by some neat crap and novelty decro...but too many \"Don't Touch!\" signs around with a awkward fireplace in the middle and business work table and printer out in the open you feel like you're someone's wacked out living room than a place to enjoy a meal.  They could take a lesson from Danny's in Barrie.  That place has boring or no decro at all and lineups out the door to get in.  Why?  Because they focus on great food and customer service."}
{"text":"Classic, clean,  fish and chips place. Good portions, fresh fish and fries, and good classic gravy for poutine. Also sells donairs and a neat donair spring roll.   And of course friendly staff."}
{"text":"Apparently, I have been missing out on this place for far too long..  THEY HAVE DONAIRS! Yes, you heard me right, my east coast peeps, there is donairs here!  They are also right across from Ravi's and I have never ever noticed them, or their sign that says there is Donairs, LOL  Thankfully I met someone who lives here and mentioned this place to me, if there is a donair out there, I will find out and I will put you in my belly! :P  I will at some point try their fish and chips too!!"}
{"text":"I wouldn't be surprised if I'm the only American that has eaten here haha.  I was visiting the area for work and my friend and I decided to try this place since they were advertising \"Newfie Fries\".  What in the world are those?    Inside, the place is decorated with coastal and underwater scenes.  We asked the lady what Newfie Fries were and she kind of laughed but let us know they were fries covered with gravy, cheese, and hamburger meat.  We got it loaded, and they were good!  We each got a large piece of breaded halibut as well.  Fish was fried a nice golden-brown.  Simple stuff but good!    Good service and you can tell the locals like it.  I'd reccomend it!"}
