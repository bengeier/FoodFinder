{"text":"There are some amazing things on the menu and service is pretty fast. If you like a thicker curry, then this curry isn't for you - it wasn't really my taste - a little thin so when mixing it with rice it got bland. I love the mango salad, the coconut wrap dish (blanking on the name) and the deep fried crab puffs."}
{"text":"Today was my first visit and I was extremely impressed. This Laotian food is as good as it gets. We ordered Chicken Laap, Souk Gai and Crab Randoon. The freshness of all three dishes was something that stood out to me. Not only were they packed full of flavour, but they also felt quite healthy as they were chock-full of herbs and vegetables and were light tasting and not at all heavy. The stand out dish was definitely the Souk Gai - definitely something to order when you're feeling under the weather and sooth your soul (and tummy). 

From the friendly welcome to the amazing cooking, my initial sense is that you can't go wrong here. After seeing many other dishes come out of the kitchen, I can't wait to work my way through the menu over the coming weeks. This is definitely my new go-to place."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is lovely. Every morsel is fragrant and delicious. Kudos to the chef!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Lao Thai location in Winnipeg and it is outstanding. The souk gai (extra spicy) gets me over my colds every time. I crave it daily, but couldn't get it since I moved to Toronto. Can't wait for this to open!!"}
{"text":"My co-worker just took me here for lunch and I loved it! 
The owner is very friendly, welcoming and outgoing and its obvious that she is aware that not only good food, but good customer service keeps people coming back. 

That being said, the food really is so delicious that I will definitely come back AND I'll bring my fiance who is constantly trying to find the most authentic Thai food. 

I had the Gang Phet (red curry) w/ Tofu. It was a very considerable serving, packed with flavour, and every sip of the curry was full flavoured with the perfect amount of spice and heat. The curry is thinner than your average Thai curry in Toronto, but that's why I loved it! I could have eaten my bowl of curry as a soup and would have loved every minute of it had I not gotten so full. I'm looking forward to my leftovers. 

One of the best things about this restaurant for me, was that the cook does not put any dairy in the curry. Unfortunately, at other Thai restaurants in Toronto such as Sukho Thai or Pai, the cooks won't do certain recipes dairy free, which is actually not authentic in the least, even though those restaurants are claiming to be. 

Loved it. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Lao Thai is the new hot spot on West Queen West. The portion sizes are amazing for what you pay. The owner is very friendly and she operates the restaurant with her mom. Both of them are Laotian so you know the food you are getting is authentic!

We ordered the Kao Peik Sen and the Beef Laap. The Kao Peik Sen soup was awesome, the noodles tasted really fresh, the broth was awesome, and the spice was great - this is a go-to food if you are hungover or sick. The beef laap portion was HUGE, very unique flavour and taste, tasted like how my mom would make it (my mom is Laotian)! Only thing I wish was that they gave us sticky rice instead of normal jasmine rice.

Will definitely be back to try the other items on the menu. The green curry looks delicious."}
{"text":"We had been eyeing this place since the sign went up as there is no thai/lao place, let alone Asian restaurants in the area. We started with the papaya salad, which was tasty, though the peanuts did not taste fresh to me. Next was the stuffed crab. Although it was crispy and delicious, we could not really taste the crab. For our mains, we had the souk gai and lao pad Thai. The souk gai was amazing especially for a cold rainy day. The broth was flavourful and quite spicy from the ginger, the chicken was very tender. The lao pad Thai was excellent as well. It was not too salty or sweet and the portion was generous. Although we asked for spicy, it was not spicy at all. The place appears to be family run and the service was very friendly and attentive. We will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu. It's a great new place in the area and quite reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised by this neighbourhood restaurant. Walked in thinking this to be just another Thai restaurant. Turned out to be my first exposure to Laotian food. If only I had known!

Wife and I had Pad Thai and Kao Peik Sen. The Paid Thai had a very mild but fragrant flavour, very different from the common bold-flavoured version as others have mentioned. It noticeably had no sweet-and-sour ketchup taste and less prominent \"wok qi\". In addition, there was a good layer of thin but tasty sauce that covered the bottom of the dish. As a result, the noodle went in the mouth with a lot of juice. The taste was delightful and easy-going (you can opt for more spiciness apparently), great for the summer. There was also a generous amount of cilantro and green onion bits in the dish, which made two northern Chinese very happy.

The Kao Peik Sen was a hearty soup. The noodle in this soup were thick and stumpy, very chewy with a lot of rice flavour. Tasted like it's hand-made. I imagine this would make a wonderful winter comfort dish.

Overall, great food quality for the price. Very friendly staff. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Fantastic food, excellent service. Very friendly and accommodating. The spicy coconut rice salad was exceptional, and they went to some pains to make sure it was as spicy as I like it."}
{"text":"the food is fantastic here and always prepared and ready on time when i order their food off of ritual. The flavours are refreshing and generous portions for great prices, don't change ever please!"}
{"text":"Had the Pad Thai here, it was soggy and very over cooked.  The flavour was bland.

I know it's hard, but If you're a brand new Thai restaurant in Toronto you need to compete with Khoa san road, Nana, and Pai.

Nice service, seems like good people, but I'm here for the food. Hope they can turn things around."}
{"text":"The fried chicken with rice is my favourite dish to get, but everything I've tried here had been delicious! Their homemade chili oil is also amazing."}
{"text":"Delicious! Took a chance since it's relatively new with few reviews... but was pleasantly surprised. Clean, friendly decor, nice ambience, and great staff. Food was fantastic. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Went here 3 times during week long stay in Toronto. Food is so fresh and made custom to order. Very accommodating to vegans. Salad rolls are the best I've ever had. Service couldn't be any nicer - lovely family run restaurant. Can't recommend enough."}
{"text":"I love this place and it's staff!!! 
Everything on the menu is amazing.
You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"You won't be disappointed. Nicest people too. They have free candies for their customers. Incredible soups and Lao style dishes!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I are visiting from Vancouver. Our girls live nearby. We were looking for some Asian restaurants for a change of dining out.

The restaurant is nice and cozy. The host was very friendly. We had the Lao Pad Thai with shrimps and curry chicken. We asked for medium heat. Both were very good. We could not finish the curry and asked for take out with additional rice.

We are very pleased with our choice of restaurant for lunch and will visit again."}
{"text":"This is a great change of pace from the \"standard\" Thai restaurants around the area.   The Pad Thai noodles, for example come in a very tasty gravy/sauce that I've never had elsewhere.
 
The chicken noodle soup and the chicken wonton soup are both excellent and the portions were generous.  I also really enjoyed the coconut rice salad lettuce wraps.

The service is very fast and friendly.  I look forward to visiting in the future and trying more dishes."}
{"text":"I ordered from this restaurant. If you want great Thai food I would suggest Sukho Thai right up the street at Dundas and Gladstone or head more east around Adelaide and John and try Pai. I ordered pad Thai from this restaurant and it was not cooked properly, and also so spicy that it was inedible. I selected spice level 3. I am South Asian and can handle A LOT of spice. When I complained through Ritual the Restaurant sent me a nasty message making it seem like its my fault for selecting level 3 out of 5. I am South Asian, have had spicy food since I was a kid. I hope they can learn better communication skills in the future. If someone complains about the food take it seriously and try and make things better rather than become defensive. If you want customers to come back you should be willing to take feedback otherwise you are in the wrong business.

This restaurant commented below stating a 2 is a medium. Please fix your own descriptions on ritual. It clearly says Level 1- no spice, level 2 - little spicy Level 3 spicy level 4 foreigner spicy level 5 thai spicy. Not sure what you are getting at. Most people would see a 3/5 as one step up from a little spicy according to your own description. Again I am South Asian and know spicy food. I eat it every day. I am not sure why you continue to stand by your word. Most restaurants would just say maybe we made an error we will make it better. This was your own response:
The restaurant has followed up with us and would like us to pass a message along:

\"Thanks for the feedback. As mentioned on the pad thai description it is Lao-style, and not dry like some other places. As for spicy, a level three is quite spicy, most people usually takes a level 1 or 2. A medium spice is 2. Spice level 3 is quite spicy, when people ask for spicy I say 3. If they ask for medium it's a 2. 4/5 spice level is beyond and for those who can take spice spice. I am sorry but if you mentioned spice level 3 that's the spice level you got. Based on my reviews it says that our spice level is very high.\"

In your response you state that a medium spice is 2 yet your own description in Ritual states a 2 is little spicy. Please correct your own descriptions before you write such defensive emails to your own customer. You also never apologized you actually simply said I am sorry but you are wrong to your own customer. Please learn basic customer service skills and correct your own descriptions."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. The pad Thai and salad rolls were amazing and very unique. Huge portion sizes, good prices, and the owners are adorable!

Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Never had lao food before this but this place is awesome! First of all you can customize the spiciness! 1-5 with 5 being the spiciest - lao/thai spicy scale. I usually eat spicy food but a 3 was perfectly spicy for me. Service was a bit slow with just one server but it was understandable.

We got lao style papaya salad which was a bit different than the thai one (no raw beans and a bit less fish saucy taste to it). The shrimp pad thai was VERY flavorful. I would definitely get this again when I go here, good portion and good price. We also got some noodle soup (forgot the name of it, but it had big strand of noodle), which was a bit bland and soggy.

Overall good experience!"}
{"text":"We ordered the green curry and the red curry at spice level 5 since we love our food hot. It was amazing . The Laotian chef was amazing and very friendly. She really enquired about our experience many times . Both the owners were very welcoming . 
Now back to the food, it was out of this world and I would recommend anyone who loves trying new cuisines to give this one a try. it won't disappoint you. 

We will definitely be back again"}
{"text":"This one is definitely overrated as far as the food is concerned, price is ok and service is excellent...
Not what I consider authentic but it's tasty and the environment is welcoming."}
{"text":"The WOW dish here is the Souk Gai, a quite simple soup with a powerful, clear ginger broth. Supremely addictive, and gets better with each spoonful. It had a lot of chicken in it (these were really tender thigh pieces), green onions and tons of ginger shavings. It's served with rice on the side or to add to the soup. We shared this since we both wanted to try it, but I'm eager to come back and slurp this up all by myself, especially on a cold day.

We were super hungry and wanted to try more things since it's a brand new place in the neighborhood, so opted for the Gang Keo, which is green curry (we chose chicken) and the Pad Thai (we chose shrimp). The thing that struck us with both dishes was how everything tasted very healthfully prepared, distinctly NOT overly greasy or salty. The curry sauce was coconutty, but wasn't quite as thick and satiating as other green curries I've had. There was a mega-dose of veggies in the curry, huge pieces of broccoli and cauliflower, not overcooked. I would choose a different meat next time, as this had white chicken pieces, which were a bit dry for my taste. (In contrast to the chicken in the Souk Gai).

The Pad Thai was very saucy, which I liked a lot, and the shrimp were large and done right (not overcooked or rubbery). A small drawback here was that it wasn't spicy at all. We were asked (warned?) about the spiciness of the Souk Gai when we ordered (we said we liked spicy), but we weren't asked about the spiciness of the other dishes we chose, so we didn't know we should ask for spice in each of them. (Other customers came in to order take-out at the counter while we were there and they were asked how spicy they wanted their Pad Thai.)

This seems to be a family-run restaurant and the service was super friendly and welcoming, and laid back. Comfortable chairs, too. We couldn't finish everything so we got it packed up to go and were offered a top-up of rice to take home, which was a kind touch. The leftovers the next day were great!

Glad to have Lao Thai in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Hidden Gem!! This restaurant is truly authentic home cooked taste of Laos food. We are so happy to have found a spot for Laos food aside from our friends parties where they preorder catering from Laos aunties. We also tried Kao peik sen a soup dish with thick jelly noodles. Loved it! Definitely adding to my fav places in T.dot."}
{"text":"Been here three times in the past two weeks. Really like their Pad Thai, the portion is probably enough for two meals. Thai iced tea was bit on the sweet side, but still really good and comparable to ones from Sukho Thai or Khao San Road."}
{"text":"I have walked by this quaint little restaurant many times but never got a chance to try it. The restaurant itself is very small and has about 6 tables, each seating up to 4 customers. We got a cute little corner booth. I believe the restaurant is family owned so there was only one waiter taking all the orders, bringing out the food and drinks and refilling our water. Although there was only one, he was efficient and very fast.

We ordered the Chicken Souk Gai, Beef Pad Thai, and the Chicken Red Curry. Let me just start of by saying that the portions are GENEROUS! Especially for the price range. It is very affordable and you will definitely feel like you ate a feast leaving this restaurant.

The Chicken Souk Gai is a laotian style spicy garlic ginger chicken soup. It is absolutely delicious and perfect for the winter because it just warms you right up. Let me just say for those who don't like ginger, don't worry because the flavoring isn't too strong, in fact it was just the right amount. The pad thai was so good, we were about to order a second plate but realized we definitely would've over eaten. The Red curry is standard red curry, so it wasn't the star of the meal.

I would definitely go back and try all the other items!!"}
{"text":"When I found out a new Thai place opened near my hood I had to go try. We ordered Green and Red curry with rice. It was fairly cheap and they come in big portions which is always a plus but they were too watered down for my liking. Having said that, it tasted really good, can't complain. Plus, their service was on point, they even gave free extra rice to take home with my leftover curry. Definitely going back considering price point and convenience. 
Adios amigos"}
{"text":"Portions are generous and the service and food is really damn good. Would recommend the rice with coconut, peanuts served with the lettuce to make lettuce wraps. It's been a while since I've had a dish that has blown me away like that. 

A++++ would come back in a heartbeat!"}
{"text":"This is a tiny casual spot right in the same building as Metro on the corner of Queen and Gladstone.  It is quite easy to miss but it is right behind RBC.

I visited for lunch based on pretty good yelp reviews.  I wanted to check it out for myself.  We were greeted by Liz, the friendly owner/chef/server.  Yes this is a family ran spot with just her and her mom.  The place is tiny with just about 20 seats.  She seated us right away.  Upon 1st look of the menu, you would know this is not a typical Thai restaurant as it fused with Laotian style of cooking.  It is a very small menu.  The prices might seem a bit high for lunch for such a tiny spot but it is par with the thai restaurants in the area.

Food:  We ordered red curry chicken and green curry beef.  Each were $12.50.  Liz brought family style rice in a large bowl and the 2 large bowls of curries.  Now, at first I was a bit verwhelmed, thinking we may have ordered too much for lunch.  However, what would've been a heavier dish is more watery.  She called it a soup.  Both were light dishes filled with vegetables and some meat, not too much meat mostly veggies.  The heat of the dishes are rated 1-5 with 5 being the hottest and I opted for 3 for my green curry.  It was quite hot but not enough to put one off.

Service:  the service here is excellent.  I noticed the extra things that makes the service stand out.  The owner upon bringing our meals offered \"if you need more rice let me know and I'll top of up.  You can't have too much rice with this soup.\"  I notice her bring a fresh spring roll to a couple beside us on the house because based on their conversation the couple were regulars.  The owner was very proud of their restaurant and their food that she was a walking advertisement.  She checked in us often but not too much.  When we finished she offered not just to pack our leftovers but also gave us more rice for \"lunch\" the next day.

The topper here is she asked us what we thought of the restaurant overall from the food to the sign outside.  She's only been open for 5mths.  Already with regulars, plenty of them picked up take out.  The sign I told her was difficult to see.  We got lost looking for it.  The sign blended with the vlank signs for the unleased places next door.

This is worth a try and definitely many lunch breaks."}
{"text":"4.5/5.

I've only ordered takeout so far, but the Gang Phet with chicken and Gang Keo with shrimp that I've had were both robust and full of natural flavors. Another bonus is that you're essentially getting two dinner-size portions for the price of one--or at least one dinner and one lunch. The lady behind the counter (presumably the owner) was kind enough to redo my order free of charge even though it was my fault for punching in the wrong item via their online system. 

I'm very glad this joint is in my neighborhood!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant last minute and they treated us like family. I had the shrimp Pad Thai. It was very good. Tried their spice from their rated as 3 out of 5. 3 was still very spicy but not unbearable. Nice little whole in wall. Ambience needs to be updated. Service was great. Would go again."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, the food from this place is a dip into paradise.  

Seriously, this is the best South East Asian food we have ever had in NA or Europe.  

This is a casual sit in restaurant but we have only had take out so cannot comment on atmosphere. 

What we can comment on though is the absolute perfection of of their food.   It is just soooooooo good. The Souk Gai has so many levels of complexity.  If you like spicy and high quality food made with love, eat here as soon as possible 

Soooo good"}
{"text":"The Pad Thai was amazing!!! (Had the shrimp) As simple as pad thai is I was blown away by the taste. I had a gig and I ran out to get some take out and stumbled upon this lovely restaurant. 

I believe since the restaurant is a Lao-Thai fusion their take on this dish is a little different. This had a sweeter taste with so much flavour. Their spice range goes from 1-5 and I choose 3. This was perfect for someone like me that enjoys the burn in your sinuses lol (still super spicy flavour wise as well). If you prefer a milder spice I recommended you choose 1! They also gave me their home made chili oil to try (also amazing)

Honestly was so impressed by their pad thai that I'm willing to travel all the way back down Queen West just to have it again."}
{"text":"The Laotian / Thai fusion was a nice change of pace. I found this place through Yelp and I placed my order according the below reviews (3 people):

Papaya salad - a cool dish of papaya with tomatoes and chilies in fish sauce
Kao soy - rice noodle soup in lao-style pork tomato base sauce. Traditional taste
Laap (beef) - with rice, bean sprouts, onion, cilantro and chilies. Traditional taste

All good dishes, healthy portions and at a very reasonable price...

We went with the medium \"Canadian\" level and it was plenty spicy, so beware... :)"}
{"text":"The service is great! Which brings it up to two stars. The food has always been mediocre, was really hoping to have a gem nearby my apartment that was easy to pick up an take home. Not a place to come and sit down, might as well be a take out only, which is fine, if the food is good. I've only had the curry and pad Thai, curry was watery and not enough flavour. The pad Thai was almost a slime texture, to bad I would love if this place was better."}
{"text":"It took 40 minutes for our order to come and there's absolutely nobody in the restaurant. 

The washroom smell just radiates through the store. It was so strong it felt revolting. I almost lost my appetite to eat. 

Server was nice but really didn't know how to handle customers. Gave our order to another table and gave it to us after.  

Food was good, way too spicy for me.  I would only go again if it was take out only.

One star is due to the washroom smell.  Add one star for the food."}
{"text":"After researching on Yelp for a place to eat, we decided to try this place out. I use to work in a Thai restaurant that mainly served Thai food but owned by Laos people the familiarity of Laos food is a given. We ordered the Crab Ragoons, Beef Laap(my fav Laos dish), Kao Soy, and Kua Pho. All dishes were tasty and generous portioned. To be specific of my favourite Laos dish - Laap I was a bit surprised the Laap did not come with sticky rice and lettuce. Although I did ask for lettuce in addition. The crab ragoons were good with a sweet sauce that merrier the taste of the deep fried crab filling. Both the Kao Soy and Kua Pho were tasty and spicy with the fresh noodles. The eat in space was compact and clean. Overall, great to see Laos restaurants emerging in Toronto."}
{"text":"Lao Thai Restaurant was an excellent place to grab lunch on a Saturday. There was more than enough room for guests. Service was super friendly and attentive to anything we needed.

To start, we order the papaya salad and nam kao. Papaya salad was amazing. We got the level 2 spicy which was not too bad, could have got the level 3 and had no issues. The nam kao was definitely the favorite at our table. The dish was super fresh with the crunchy texture along with the soft texture of the rice. We needed more lettuce to eat with it which we had no problem getting. You definitely get great portions of food for the prices here. In addition, we ordered the souk gai and gang geo. Both were great and served with rice. We ordered so much that we ended up having enough leftovers for later.

Will be back to this place for the great service and delicious food. Tip: If you want sticky rice, ask a day in advance and they said they have no problems accommodating!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars... we paid for the extra topping of shrimp and it was forgotten.  Otherwise it could be a 4 stars

We ordered through Ritual and seeing the many positives, I was hoping it would be a good one.  The app itself is quite easy and the timing only took 20 minutes at most for us from moment of order to pick up time.  

I will say finding parking is not always the easiest as FreshCo is right across the street.  The restaurant itself is quite small but clean and minimalist in decor.  When you walk in, you clearly smell the spices.  Everything was ready the moment we stepped in... and pick up was easy.  With everything packed nice and neat, we were ready to go with our green curry with shrimp & chicken with 2 order of Laotian coffee.

Green Curry - I will agree that the portion seemed quite generous.  After eating at Sabai Sabai and Pai, it seemed like the same price point but at least 30% more curry and vegetables.  I 200% appreciate they had nice big green vegetables in there.  Just very good on that.  The heat was spicy (level 3) and you can definitely feel it linger on the tongue.  Very good flavour overall and even good the next day with the left overs.  The only thing that made this less than stellar was that they forgot the shrimp we paid for ... so only a 3.5/5

Laotian coffee - For starters... its cold.  LOL didnt realize that but it tastes like a very flavourful and sweet coffee.  It almost feels like there's an added fruit berry note to it.  This would be amazing during the summer heat any time. 4/5

Overall, I'd be willing to come back to give it a shot if I'm in the area but I'm hoping the slip up was a one time deal and not a regular thing."}
{"text":"This place is great. My Fiancee, our friends, and I were in Toronto last weekend for Caribana, and we stopped by this place. The food was good, the owner and son were really nice and helpful with stuff. We tried the Shrimp Rolls, Cilantro Shrimp, Pad Thai and Fried Chicken Fried Rice. They were all delicious. The Pad Thai come in spice levels of 0-5. We got it at a level 3 and it was pretty spicy. All in all, it hit the spot. I will come back next time I am in Toronto."}
{"text":"Pad Thai is great, best I've ever had. All Dishes are made fresh single serving for you, so modifications aren't an issue. Spicy is actually still spicy here, it is not dialed back at all.

Service is friendly, prompt, and ensures you're taken care of. Reasonable cost considering the size of portions.

Great for small group eating in and take out."}
{"text":"Great value! Portions are very large and service is extremely friendly - you can tell it's a family-owned place. 

Had the spicy pad Thai - so flavourful and quite spicy (even if you ask for a 1 on the spice scale). The fresh rolls were good but could benefit from some fresh basil inside to up the flavour factor."}
{"text":"I just stumbled on this new mom and daughter Laotian resto and it's easily my new favorite spot! I just had their homemade chicken noodle soup- as in hand made and hand cut noodles and the levels of flavour are incredible! The noodles are a perfect silky but not too soft texture- and the broth is so delicate and nuanced. Really great and super affordable! I can't wait to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! The food is amazing and the service is even better. This is my neighborhood joint. They cater to my need for fire hot food, asking each and every time if theyve satiated it enough. Tweaking everything until its perfect for me. My husband has numerous food allergies that they've memorized and have NEVER made us feel inconvenienced by them. If youre looking for wonderful Laotian/Thai food in the Queen west area, look no further. You have arrived!"}
{"text":"This is an average restaurant with good food. We ordered the red curry, pad Thai, and stuffed crab. The crab was my favorite, I loved the wonton wrap and the sauce that was sweet yet tangy that came with it. The pad thai was interesting, I think it was the glass noodles that threw me off because I'm used to rice noodles. It was tasty but not my favorite. The red curry was really good but just average. Would have liked more chicken in the curry. There were people eating in the restaurant but I would recommend take out since it is a small and place that doesn't really have an ambience, which is okay, but I wouldn't eat there. The people who run it though are really nice and if you want an easy takeout meal - this is a good opt"}
{"text":"This was the best pad Thai I have ever had 
Service is greAt.  
I can't wait to come back and have green curry."}
{"text":"This was my second time here. My first time I ordered the Tom Yum, which was absolutely delicious, so I was excited to try this place again.

Today, I got the Pad Thai. Sadly, I have to stay away from spice now as my digestive system no longer seems to like it, so when I asked about the spice level (on the menu it says that it is spicy), I was told that they used to make it with the spice mixed in, but now put it on top instead. To that, I was relieved, as I really wanted to try the Pad Thai, so I ordered it with no spice. 

You can definitely tell that it's made freshly with fresh ingredients, which is always welcome. I liked the sauciness of it, but wish the noodles weren't quite as soft. That's personal preference, though.

I'm not too familiar with the unique qualities of Laotian food compared to Thai, but you can tell the flavours in this Pad Thai were different from the Thai equivalent. It was good, but not my favourite Pad Thai that I've ever had.

You definitely get value for your money as the portion sizes are generous. I got two meals out of the Pad Thai. 

I had positive experiences both times with the staff, as they are quite friendly. They definitely have that family business charm, and you can tell they care about their customers' experience. 

I'm super happy this place is in my neighbourhood and I look forward to trying more dishes. Next up is the green curry!"}
