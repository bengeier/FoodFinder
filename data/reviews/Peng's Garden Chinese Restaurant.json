{"text":"One of the best Chinese restaurants I've been to around GTA, and I've tried Chinese restaurants all over - Markham, Richmond hill, north york, Scarborough, toronto downtown.  I've been getting takeout from here for years, and everything I've tried had been excellent. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Definitely a five star.   food is not oily, portions are good, definitely have to get the beef with black bean sauce and the chicken ball is 90% chicken and 10% batter which is usually the other way around with most other joints."}
{"text":"We've never eaten in the restaurant but get takeout here all the time. Best Chinese in the area, hands down. Service is always fast and friendly.  I wish they served dim sum..."}
{"text":"My cousin owns a Chinese restaurant so I know what good Chinese food taste like. I tried the Cantonese chow mein at Pengs and it instantly reminded me of my cousins Chinese restaurant. The noodles were crispy, vegetables were fresh, and had plenty of chicken. The price is good for what you get. Service is decent. I'll probably come back!"}
