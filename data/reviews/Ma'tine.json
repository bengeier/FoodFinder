{"text":"Cadre sympathique et service qui plait. Le menu est original et tentant. Il est cependant possible d'attendre 45 minutes après la commande avant que l'assiette arrive. La réalisation du menu est très correcte mais on aurait aimé un peu plus de finesse. Le demi poulet est raccourci en un généreux tiers, avec une présentation style soupe asiatique mais qui manque de structure."}
{"text":"Nourriture extra mais pas beaucoup d'oeufs pour un brunch. Et 1h30 d'attente c'est excessif."}
{"text":"A la lecture des avis on s'est dit que ça valait le coup de tester ce petit resto, mais déception pour ma part. Vraiment pas beaucoup de choix.. et excessivement cher comparé à la quantité de nourriture servie. Heureusement que c'était bon. Aussi pour le prix ils pourraient donner une petite entrée ne serai ce que du pain et du beurre ou quelque chose à grignoter... 2 plats et un jus pas loin de 50$ pour 2... Aussi dès que tu a fini de manger on te propose autre chose puis directement la facture, on s'est un peu senti poussez vers la sortie.. 
Je n'y retournerai plus !"}
{"text":"Food: Honestly I was a little disappointed, due to the hype I had really high expectations for it to be PERFECT~ The menu is composed of original items and everything tasted amazing. The bacon slab is fork-tender and melt in your mouth, the boudin came as a \"brick\", was soft and flavorful, and the cod croquettes was fried to perfection and the coconut sauce was rich but not overwhelming. However everything was super salty and my cappuccino was EXTRA sour! even with additional milk it still left an acidic after taste... T.T

Service: Very attentive, our waiter clarified all our questions about the menu and was very proactive at asking if we had any needs~

Value: Mid-High end for brunch in MTL

Ambiance: Great ambiance, big window to let in tons of sunlight, but seats are a little crammed together and nowhere to hang big winter coats~"}
{"text":"The owners had a small restaurant called La Famille up in Outremont and decided to close shop and open in Ville-Marie/Gay Village. This was a great decision on their part. The ambiance is laid-back and casual. The pastries are made fresh every morning and you get to see what they have to offer at their pastry counter right at the entrance.
We had brunch on the patio, it was a saturday morning at about 10am and the patio was half-full. By 11am the patio was full however the seating is arranged in a way to give you enough breathing space where you can have a good conversation without having to raise your voice. The staff was very welcoming, friendly and polite.The prices we're reflective of the ingredients they used. Since the menu changes every week, you can expect good, fresh, quality dining every time. I will be going back many more times in the future."}
{"text":"Ma'tine is a unique place in Montreal : rarely can you find great food, fun wines, homemade pastries and awesome coffee all in one place! The menu changes constantly and you can never be bored. The staff is friendly and efficient. And nowhere else can you get such a great brunch in the middle of the week! 

Be careful, as their brunch is only served until 11am on weekdays. But it's the best time to go, since there isn't a line up like Saturday. And if you get there too late, just stay for lunch :)

Thanks to all the staff at Ma'tine for the great times. Looking forward to coming again soon!"}
{"text":"i had the poudine and my friend has the onion soup, they were really good, really tasty a bit over priced but worth the visit. the service is slow but really friendly"}
{"text":"We arrived and were seated quickly. The waitress started out giving us a list of what was no longer available... hint... the best dishes on the menu, of course. Between waiting to order, ordering and finally getting served took about an hour, we know this because we had to refill the parking meter. The pastries were lovely, though too much chocolate for me, personally. The blood sausage (boudin noire) dish was tasty but difficult to eat with the hard top they had put on it.

I haven't gone out for brunch in years, so this was supposed to be a special treat for us. Maybe it was our error, when they told us the list of what wasn't available anymore, maybe we should have bolted and gone elsewhere."}
{"text":"Une des top 3 places de brunch pour l'originalité et la qualité a Montreal. Vous ne serez jamais déçus par les plats composés de boudin, leur spécialité. Un bon choix pour les plus aventureux vous aurez assurément un plat hors de l'ordinaire qui saura vous satisfaire. Et en plus d'offrir un menu de qualité  les serveurs sont courtois et sympas. Un 5/5 pleinement mérité."}
{"text":"I had a wonderful brunch experience at Ma'Tine. I arrived around 12, as there was no line up I was quickly seated at the bar. The restaurant is decorated with taste, I particularly liked their lightning. The service was great, they were very attentive and provided me with adequate suggestions. Also, the dishes were served very quickly which is a huge plus for me. I ordered their Boudin façon salade César which is composed of grilled crisp lettuce, bacon bits, poached egg, parmesan, anchovies, walnuts and of course black pudding. The taste was a-ma-zing! I also ordered their cucumber and mint lemonade which was very refreshing... i honestly loved it. I would recommend this place for numerous reasons, the atmosphere, the service and mainly the food!"}
{"text":"Looking for a Saturday brunch and my friend recommended this place. Walking in, you can see the hipster vibe instantly. Being greeted by a less than enthusiastic hostess / possibly waiter wasn't overly pleasant but the waiter made up for this indiscretion. Friendly and very helpful, we ordered a bottle of wine and was happy with the cheapest white they offered.

For the meal we ordered the steak and eggs option as well as the poached egg on a flavourful bread with a wonderful apricot jam playing on the sweet and savoury. Going back to the steak and eggs, wonderful braised beef with potatoes underneath. It was wonderful. 

On the menu, a chocolate bread pudding called out so we ordered that to finish. It was absolutely delicious. 

Without question, the meal was satisfying but not cheap by any means but for a wonderful brunch I didn't mind the price.

I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Oh, Ma'tine. 
Merci aux deux frères et Sophie d'avoir réouvert un resto après La Famille. 
J'ai mangé tellement de choses là bas que je ne pourrais nommer des plats. Tout était délicieux par contre. Les jus frais et la limonade sont hors de ce monde. Service courtois et attentionné. Oui, il y a des guêpes sur la terrace en été mais come on! Ils font tout pousser eux même, toutes les herbes et plantes, vous pouvez les retrouver dans votre assiette. Je les pardonnes. 
Si vous cherchez un dejeuner classique, n'allez pas la. Ici c'est seulement un endroit ou surprendre vos pupilles gustatives et faire plaisir à vos yeux. 
Les combinaisons de saveurs sont du jamais vu. Je n'y suis pas retournée depuis cet été faute d'habiter en Californie mais c'est le premier endroit sur ma liste des commerces à visiter à mon retour."}
{"text":"This was my last restaurant to try in Montreal and it was amazing! My friend got a veal brunch dish and that's something I will never forget in next few weeks. The outdoor seating was much nicer than the inside until bee's started attacking us while we eat. Besides that I would highly recommend this place to go"}
{"text":"We had the blood pudding, Jerusalem artichoke, tahini, brioche, sunny side up egg and braised bacon slab, romano bean ragout, spicy sweet potatoes, poached egg. Both were devious. My preference would be the bacon because it melts in your mouth. Service was pleasant and sweet. Our waiter was very patience with us and explaining everything to us in English. We are from Toronto and don't speak french. I will be returning there again. The menu changes daily."}
{"text":"Dès le moment où j'ai poussé la porte du Ma'tine pour la première fois, j'ai senti que ma vie allait changer. Fini, les moments de questionnements interminables lorsque je me cherche un endroit où relaxer avec un bon repas, fini les longues routes jusqu'au Sweet Lee's pour me gâter d'une bonne pâtisserie, fini les mauvaises surprises, les déceptions qu'amènent une assiette sans goût alors qu'on avait tellement hâte de gâter nos papilles! Le Ma'tine, c'est l'endroit qui fait en sorte que tous les autres restaurants ont perdus leur couleurs; T'as plus envie d'aller nulle part ailleurs, un vrai havre de bonne bouffe et d'amour.

La perfection du Ma'tine, ça commence par les sourires du personnel, et ce, peu importe le moment de la journée. Qu'on soit dans le rush du diner, au milieu d'un après-midi tranquille ou à une heure où la cuisine est malheureusement fermée, les employés t'accueilleront chaleureusement. Une fois assis, on se laisse envoûter par le décors rustique, les ampoules suspendues au plafond, le menu à l'ardoise et la sublime terrasse. Parlant du menu, très abordable, simplet sur papier mais changeant au gré des jours, une simple description des spéciaux du jour nous permet de comprendre que la fraicheur se retrouve sur tous les éléments de la carte. Autant pour les gros et les petits appétits, les choix vont de la salade de tomates ancestrales jusqu'à un plat de poisson du jour, en passant par un sandwich gourmand et une salade repas, toujours avec une touche d'originalité à faire fondre même les plus capricieux.

Pour les plats que j'ai goûté, je ne vous mettrai pas l'eau à la bouche inutilement puisqu'ils ne seront sûrement plus au menu lors de votre visite, ayant laissé leur place pour d'autres assiettes encore plus appétissantes. Par contre, je peux tout de même glisser un mot sur la limonade au concombre, qui se dévoile dans un équilibre parfait d'acidité et d'un doux sucré. Je n'ai entendu que des bons mots au sujet de leurs café, ce sera à essayer lors d'une prochaine visite!

Finalement, il est impossible de terminer notre visite sans se prendre une pâtisserie. Ne passez pas à côté des meilleurs muffins de Montréal, et je dis ça en connaissance de cause! Ananas rôtis, framboises, arachides caramélisés? Pommes, figues et mélange de noix? Puis encore, je ne vous ai pas parlé de leurs cannelés, leur brownie, oh et les croissants... 

Ma'tine, je t'aime."}
{"text":"Extremely creative with their food. Presentation is gorgeous and so is the interior. The service pretty slow, definitely would love to have things come out sooner (took over 30mins). Menu is continuously changing which makes going extremely exciting! Will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"We got there around 11 am and the restaurant was packed! It took us a little while to be seated (almost 30 minutes). The waiter asked us if we mind sharing the table, which we didn't (or else it would've taken us more time!) The location is very accessible (1 min away from Beaudry metro station). They offer pastries but I didn't get any since I was pretty full from what I ordered.

I got their \"Heirloom tomatoes, peaches, galangal, clams, fresh cheese\" and I really liked it although there was no meat! (I'm a meat-lover) They gave a lot of clams (I thought they would give 3 or 4 clams like the other places, but I got a bunch of clams, which made me reallllllly happy because I love clams!) The clams were really fresh, well seasoned/marinated and quite big. The tomatoes and peaches were fresh and sweet! Plus, they blended well with their \"sauce/purée\"! I don't normally like cheese but their fresh cheese was really good, especially with their sauce/purée! This dish was overall sweet but I really liked it! It wasn't overcooked and my friend liked it as well. My friend's chicken liver was delicious as well (it went well with their Caesar sauce!) My other friend ordered their \"Green peas, colourful radishes, plums, vanilla and lemon vinaigrette, poached egg\". I didn't try this one but my friend find that there were way too many radishes in the bowl and she didn't finish it...

The reason why I didn't give a 5-star is because we waited for a very very long time before we got our dishes.. We were starving by then.. They have a pretty slow service I find.. But I guess good food is worth the wait!

P.S: They have an English menu now (I heard they only had French menus before) and the good thing about Ma'tine is they change menu every week and use what is fresh on the market, so you always get fresh ingredients! The waiter also explained the menu clearly to us!

P.P.S: Get there early or else it would take a \"little\" while for you to get seated! Or a \"little\" while to get what you order!"}
{"text":"Ma'tine is an industrial-chic restaurant that offers great breakfast and brunch options, in addition to drinks and pastries.  The hubs and I came here for an early brunch, and we were seated right away.  I loved how the chef on-site, Jeremy, grows and makes everything on the premise, including the bread and the preserves.  Our server, Patrick, was unbelievably kind and friendly and made some great suggestions.  We had some grilled buttered bread, that had a lovely crusty exterior, and the choice of jams/spreads (we picked a whipped butter with lemon zest (absolutely delicious!), apple preserve (a lovely pink color), peanut butter, and clementine (my absolute favorite - this was super delicious as it had the right amount of sweetness and citrus-notes for the buttered bread).  We also shared one of their most popular brunch dishes, which was a croissant sandwich that contained sausage, pickled red onions, scallions, a fried egg, and bacon marmalade, with a side of dressed Caesar spinach salad - I wasn't really much of a fan of the sausage nor the bacon marmalade spread, but if it was just with the egg and the scallions, I think it would have been better.  The spinach salad was super delicious, with a tangy zip from the dressing and generously-sliced provolone shavings.  The place itself was cute, hipster-ish, and had some cool decor.  I'd love to come back and try out their other savory/lunch dishes the next time!

+grilled bread with homemade spreads/preserves

{"text":"Ma'tine, tu auras été mon aventure d'un soir.
Je t'ai connu durant un brunch le dernier jour que tu restais en ville.
Coup de foudre immédiat même si j'ai attendu avant de te parler.
J'ai des minces regrets à ne t'avoir jamais abordé avant mais comme on dit \"mieux vaut tard que jamais\"
Au final on s'est quitté, le cur léger et lourd à la fois
Je garderais un bon souvenir de toi et peut être que nous nous retrouverons dans un autre contexte. Les retrouvailles ne seront que plus belles :)
Vu la qualité de notre rencontre je n'hésiterais pas à te retrouver même si je dois traverser la ville.
Ma'tine, longue vie à ton souvenir et à notre magnifique première rencontre où tu as été parfaite ...."}
{"text":"One of the interesting parts of travelling for work is eating out in some great restaurants. One of the down sides is the table by yourself. At Ma'tine, as with an increasing number of the best places I have eaten, they solve this problem by having fabulously friendly staff and seats at the counter. The aforementioned staff, who even after a single meal feel like friends, were more than happy to plug the gaps in my rather inadequate grasp of the French language and translate the menu items. I eventually settled on grilled melon, spicy sausage and brioche with peanut cream accompanied by a latte and a glass of fresh green juice. 

On its arrival, the dish looked spectacular. Slices of grilled honeydew melon, two pieces of toasted brioche and sufficient spiced sausage to bring together the sweet fruit and buttery brioche. The undocumented salad leaves atop the entire plate were an essential element of the meal that augmented the other ingredients whose sweetness and spiciness were all vying for attention. You could tell that the chef had really thought about how the dish was constructed when you came across the slithers of pickled red onion concealed within the salad. You didn't think that you needed them, but once you had a mouthful with them, there was no going back. 

The food didn't last nearly long enough, but I did manage a second latte and a few glasses of water provided attentive staff. I can't believe how much people who bring me food can increase my dining experience. These people could have fed me cardboard and it would have been a pleasure. On paying, the lady who had assisted me with the menu commented that I was obviously from out of town, and I said that I was travelling from Perth. She asked how I had found the coffee as Australian coffee was one of their great influences. If only Perth would provide me with food as exciting as the one I had just eaten, then I would give up travelling and stay at home. 

Incidentally, the coffee was an inspirational recreation of a creamy Melbournian latte. Maybe a few degrees too warm, but I simply don't care."}
{"text":"Ma'tine is my go-to for brunch in Montreal and NOT just on the weekend. There's no shortage of options in the Plateau and Mile End but I loved finding this right in the village. 

I love a nice bottle of wine and seeing the menu change every time I arrive. Good for yourself or bring a crew of 10! (Give them a call first.) I have to say, during the week - this is my \"secret spot.\" I also love that a foodie friend or two will suggest Ma'tine, and are always pleased.

Ma' Tine is a mix of café and bakery with lots and lots of baked goods. With the outside terrace, enjoy your brunch with fresh air too! The indoor ambience is great as well, I never feel crowded or like I'm shouting. 

Sample of pricing:
Toast and jam $5
Granola $8
Strawberry and figs $8
Poached peaches $9
Mille Feuille $9
Baked goods $2.50-$4.75
Anchovies and eggs $10
Tomato, peaches, gazpacho $11

For a bottle of wine for two, fries, two main courses, I can typically spend $100 including generous tip. Why do I say this? The staff is FABULOUSLY known for being friendly and fast. That said, I have never ever ever felt rushed. GO! It's a rave."}
{"text":"The one star rating is for the service. We asked for a table of two, the hostess mentioned that the wait shouldn't be long as a group was leaving soon. However, we ended up waiting 30 minutes+ for a table. The sad part is that I watched 3-4 groups get seated before us. Our table was cleaned and ready for us to be seated for 15 minutes however our waitress \"forgot\" to seat us. She saw us patiently waiting and somehow did not realize that we were still waiting. 

We ordered an expresso and it took about another  10 minutes for it to come. Being on vacation, we wasted nearly an hour of our valuable time. Do not come back. 

P.S. Expresso was sour."}
{"text":"So creative and delicious! They change the menu every week. Every single thing is delicious. Yes the prices are a little higher than the average brunch but it is absolutely worth it. 
The service was impeccable and the decor is simple and cute."}
{"text":"So good that we brunched here twice during our week long stay. It also helped that it was a few blocks away from the apartment we rented and walking in the cold was not an option. Try their dishes with eggs, have a savory soup, and delicious coffee. Enjoy the lovely setting, then grab a pastry on the way out. 

My french is really bad, but thankfully they had an english menu the first time and the second time the waitress was kind enough to walk through their selection on the board."}
{"text":"OK, here it is : BEST BRUNCH IN TOWN. And trust me, I've tried A LOT of brunches in Montreal.

Ma'tine is the kind of place you want to spend the entire day. The friendly staff welcomes you in a bright and spacious restaurant for weekday lunches and week-end brunches.

Until the terrace officially opens you can choose to sit in the sun by the window or to meet new friends at the large table in the back. 

I absolutely love how the menu changes daily, with new components and surprising combinations. Whether you like sweet or savory brunch, you've got options. Be sure to give one of the daily juices a try - they will not let you down. 

Ma'tine is absolutely worth a visit."}
{"text":"My roommate and I were lucky enough to score Easter Sunday brunch reservations at Ma'tine. The woody and homey feel of the decor was a perfect start to our early brunch. Our Americanos came with tiny pots of steamed milk on the side -- A nice little touch. To eat, we shared two plates: 

1. Braised lamb with parsnips, arugula salad and a fried egg
2. Saucisse Morteau with a thick piece of bacon, sweet potato and a fried egg

The lamb was incredibly tender, though we both agreed that the plate itself could have almost been a lunch or dinner option. The saucisse morteau, on the other hand, was the perfect, upgraded, classier version of your classic eggs with bacon and sausage -- Highly recommended. 

At the end of our meal, we were asked to pay our bill at the front of the restaurant where there was a WIDE assortment of baked goods (danishes, croissants, brownies, small cakes etc.). I'd definitely recommend Ma'tine for brunch, especially if they are willing to take reservations on normal days!"}
{"text":"Ayant entendu parler de cette place dans les différents blogs/magazines, j'ai essayé. Donc effectivement, si vous voulez un déjeuner gastronomique classe (*exit les 2 oeufs/bacon*) c'est l'endroit. La salade de betteraves (11$) était bonne mais pas assez consistante pour moi, j'ai du prendre un croissant pour combler ma faim avant de partir. Mon latté était très bon. Le boudin/brioche (16$) était vraiment exquis également. Ils ont un comptoir avec viennoiseries (croissants/muffins/...) à la sortie. Leur terrasse était envahie de guêpes mais le service était rapide & courtois."}
{"text":"Nice place for breakfast. We sat at the bar and the place is pretty chill. They change the menu daily and use fresh local ingredients. The milk in my latte was from a cow on the south shore. I had the tartare de truite saumonnee with fennel, and a sunny side up egg on top. Was delish, but way too much fennel for my liking."}
{"text":"Blame the foodie journalists from Lapress for this 2 star review. It's just not as good as they described. No free coffee refill is fine when they know how to actually make good coffee, but not only it was so-so, it was so SLOW! 20min wait for an espresso and 45min wait for the food. After finishing the plate in 20min cuz we were so hungry, they can't wait to throw us out of the restaurant considering other waiting guests. However, if they were not that slow, we would have freed the table 1 hour before! Food was great but i've seen better (take your 2 min walk and try O'thym)!"}
{"text":"From brothers Jérémy and Maxime Daniel-Six, the same chefs who created the micro-resto sensation La Famille (http://www.yelp.com/biz/la-famille-montréal), comes the best new spot in town to expand your palate through their creativity and beautifully crafted foods and drinks.

The important stuff: the food, fresh juices and desserts are still amazing as ever. Not only is the food beautiful to look at, but it is extremely flavorful and they combine ingredients in a way that continues to push the boundaries (in a good way) of classic French cuisine.

They now have a much larger restaurant with a huge open café area, a desserts/pastries area at the front near the cashier, ample seating for all, and a beautiful, huge terrace/garden in the back where they grow all of their own fresh herbs to cook with.

The wait staff is fast and friendly and overall we had a wonderful experience.

I would highly recommend this resto to all who are looking to break their routine of the normal Montréal food experience and get something your stomach and palate will thank you for."}
