{"text":"Walked in at 1:00 on a Monday and waited 2 minutes in the deserted restaurant. No customers and apparently no workers. I could hear a loud TV playing in the kitchen, but there didn't seem to be anyone home. Or maybe it was a great show? Anyway, being new to the area, I guess I won't be trying Alfonso's after all."}
{"text":"Nice family run joint. Not super formal but I like that. The food is great and the service is good. The have never gotten my order wrong. Try the Chilaquiles with carne asada and egg!"}
{"text":"Shazam! What a find. Way above average Mexican hole in the wall food. Very clean place and the food was definitely made with pride."}
{"text":"Great salsa bar and grilled chicken burrito.  Green chile salsa is bomb.  Nice and quiet and fast.  Great for lunch."}
{"text":"I was chillin at my job as a male stripper when i started sneakin through Uber eats to find some grub. I was in the mood for some Mehekano (Meh-He-Kahno) and came across Alfonso's. Seriously, only a brainless rump skull would not eat here whenever they had the chance. Cheap, big portions and just an all around delight. Seriously, go here and get that Choncho burrito and some rolled tacos. You can thank me later."}
{"text":"I met a friend of mine here nearby from Bookman's and it was delicious and very fast! Sit down or take out. I don't come to Phoenix a lot but I wanted some Mexican food. I had a lunch special of enchilada (chicken) and rice and beans, and I added some salsa from the bar which turned my face beet red. Flavorful too! I enjoyed the enchiladas (2) and they were cheesy and good. My friend had a cheese quesadilla which looked plentiful and I would like to get that next time, too!"}
{"text":"PROS: Friendly staff. Good service. Food comes out quick. Clean inside. Food has good flavor.  CONS: Salt.Salt.Salt. For some reason all the dishes I've ordered here are over salted."}
{"text":"Seriously the best little Mexican restaurant I've been to in a while! The Carne Asada is AMAZING! It's real meat , not that nasty fatty meat fili b's has !! We came in at 7:50 pm tonight , right before closing and they were so delightful ! The food was super hot and fresh , even though we were the last to be served for the day ! I got the Chile Verde burrito tonight and my boyfriend got the Carne Asada! They were both so delicious. Their rice and beans are so good, too! I can't wait to try a chimichanga and the chilaquiles! We will be coming back many more times !"}
{"text":"My co- workers and I have been here a few times. Food portions are huge and cheaply priced. Food is great and always cooked to order.  Service is fast. There Alfonso Burrito is my favorite it is a must share item with a few people or just have  left overs."}
{"text":"Best carne asada fries from any fast Mexican food joint! Hands down. Been to phx, Glendale, Mesa, north Phoenix, south, and these are my top ones!"}
{"text":"This little spot that's in an old Mesa plaza is a gem! Their food is always amazing! Super big portions, cheap prices, and it's delicious! Not even in the same category as filibertos or julioberto or any of the betos Mexican fast food spots. Alfonso's is definitely my recommendations when you're looking for good Mexican fast food! They also have a salsa bar which is always a plus in my opinion!"}
{"text":"All of these reviews are not for Senor Vaquero and need to be removed. Senor Vaquero has only been open at this location for a couple weeks. Somebody at Yelp needs to be doing their job better."}
