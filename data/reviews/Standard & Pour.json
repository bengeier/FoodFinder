{"text":"I came here last year and the food was great and the service was good. However, I was here yesterday and found that they changed the menu format from tapas to \"more traditional fare\". The food was not very good, especially given the price. The cheaubriand is mediocre at best. The linguini was spicy, but not in good way.
To be fair, the waitress offered us good service. But the waiter ignored our requests as if we were transparent (I guess the tips go to specific waitperson, but he shouldn't be a jerk nonetheless).

The bottom line - no reason to ever go there again. Many choices available in Henderson/Vegas. Good luck to them."}
{"text":"Pure excellence. Every flavor was spot on. We tried a bunch of plates and weren't disappointed by one! Good bar selection and wine list. The service was also excellent. I mentioned I'm gluten free and the server told us my options AND told the kitchen. Then the chef came out to assure me he was aware. Now that is service! This area needs a food option like this. The view is very nice as well if you look above the parking lot. Bring a sweater because it's chilly in there."}
{"text":"Went to Easter brunch they now serve brunch every Sunday).

Great service, good food, awesome bloody mary bar."}
{"text":"Wonderful food and delicious drinks. Superior service. The whole shopping center lot is very close together so if you want to avoid the *free* Valet you can always park somewhere close by. 

Happy hour- I'm a little cheap when it comes to food and drinks but the happy hour was wonderful. Regular portions for half the price!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, fun date night or group get together. Love the mac and cheese and house ouch to drink!"}
{"text":"Definitely an unique spot in the middle of Henderson!

Tried about a third of the menu. I secretly hate myself for loving the port wine mac n cheese so much. Must try the Kim Chi Tacos, Snail Wellington, and Wine & Cheese dessert.

(Don't be afraid to order seconds. We did!)

Our dinner was spent at a very special table. If you can grab a seat there, do so!"}
{"text":"Boyfriend and I was looking for a place to eat and we found this restaurant on a top restaurant place to visit article so we thought we give it a try.  

When we arrived. The place wasn't that busy but we decided to stay and give it a try.  They have a nice dining area and bar but the lounge  is what caught my eye.  They have indoor and outdoor lounge are and we chose indoors.  

After being seated we were approached by our waitress Nichole whi was very attentive throughout the night.  She answered all our questions and explain they are like a tapas restaurant but with them you actually get more food.

We ordered  a bottle  from the wine list which was very well priced. We decided on 3 different dishes for dinner as we sipped our wine. Salt & pepper fries were good  and the 3 different sauces made them great! Calamari  which was very good too.  Cook perfectly.  Lastly, our favorite dish was spicy shrimp  which came in a red curry sauce  and coconut milk.- Extremely  delicious.  

Only negative was they offered us more bread with the spicy shrimp. We accepted  and it we were.charged extra bread on our ticket.  Enjoyed ambiance, we relaxed and wasn't pressured to leave.  

Looking to plan girls dinner for my birthday there!  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Loved the spicy shrimp and calamari! It's difficult for so many places to accomplish this while providing a tender product.  I brought some VIP clients in at happy hour. We had excellent service! The specialty cocktails were out out of this world. The food and service were excellent! My clients were thrilled. Thank you to the bartenders and waitstaff! But favorite, by far, is the chateaubriand!"}
{"text":"Met some friends here for happy hour in the lounge one evening. Great little spot and the food was excellent! Highly recommend the beef sliders and the mac and cheese. It's upstairs over a different bar so it can be a little hard to find."}
{"text":"Came on opening night and couldn't be more impressed. The meatballs were covered in a whipped ricotta that was mouth watering and the lost bread was cooked perfectly, tender and tasted like thanksgiving. 
The service was friendly but not intrusive and I will be back soon. Great place for large parties and family style dinner."}
{"text":"Great service.  Cute, fun spot for date night or with friends.  Recommend the spicy shrimp, the sauce is amazing!  Coming back for brunch to try their Sunday funday ($24 bottomless bloody Mary's, mimosas, and PBR)."}
{"text":"This was our first time here and we are blown away by the experience! Everything from the food to the service was amazing. Our server, Christine, was knowledgable and super nice. We came unknowingly but the food, service and ambiance completely exceeded our expectations. 
Everyone from the server assistants to the waiters, to the managers were informative and attentive, which was refreshing. 

The food we're small bites to be shared and it was more than enough for the table. Something for everyone! Can't wait till we come back!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour. Would order the tacos again but pass on the blue cheese date dip.  Sat at the bar and bartender and servers were attentive and friendly. Decent crowd for a Wednesday night. Looking forward to going back and trying brunch on the weekend."}
{"text":"What a great find this place is!! The atmosphere is really cool. We loved it because it was so different than places you experience on the strip. The service here is beyond amazing and the owner is extremely friendly and personable. Happy hour menu is also awesome. We will definitely be coming back here next time we visit."}
{"text":"This place was amazing! Loved the ambiance and the food was incredible. We had the mac and cheese (amazing), the turkey meatballs, green beans, date and blue cheese jam and the calamari. Plates are slightly larger than tapas and we'll worth every bite. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Had the \"Sunday Funday\"...awesome!  Also the polenta and eggs was fantastic.  The Bloody Mary bar had tons of options and our server Christine was very attentive."}
{"text":"Great bar and restaurant. Went there after golfing today and was perfect. Staff and food was great."}
{"text":"The location is beautiful but what makes this restaurant special is the people, the ambiance and the excellent menu. The interior design is warm and stylish, Chelsea and Ed lead a talented crew who will make you feel welcome.

The menu is amazing. My favorites are the Spicy Shrimp and the Kimchi Tacos but everything I have tried is fantastic!

My new treat is Rye Me a River, one of their craft cocktails. 

Cannot wait to come back!"}
{"text":"The carrot risotto changed my life. It was delicious and very rich. While they are \"tapas\" the portions are quite large. 

Our only complaint is that the Yelp coupon doesn't specify that only certain beers/wines qualify. My boyfriend ordered a beer that was the same price as the \"free\" one, and our server refused to remedy the situation.  If we would've been taken care of, definitely would've been 5 stars."}
{"text":"The food presentation is amazing and everything tastes so good. Love coming to a restaurant where you can drink and enjoy lots of smaller dishes and walk away so satisfied! This is a place you need to put on your list as a must try restaurant. I traveled at commute hour to try it from downtown Summerlin and it only took me 30 minutes, the strip takes that long. Simon Hospitality Group did an amazing job!

This is my second visit and let me tell you, it's worth the trip from Summerlin!!! Beautiful and delicious food                   This morning we had breakfast at the restaurant and the food was amazing, the polenta was out of this world and do we're the muffins, eggs were perfect, you don't know what your missing until you've had the bloody Mary's, it's a must have breakfast, five stars all the way!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and was really hoping for a local hang out to meet friends and clients with good food and a cool atmosphere. I was disapointed both times. The food is expensive and not great. The atmosphere is okay. The views are not bad if you are seated in the right spot. There is a nice outdoor/patio type area which is a great place to hang out with a group. The really bad part is I have tried twice to get a decent Old Fashioned and both times was served something that was more of a manhattan and served in the wrong glass. To be fair it seems to be more of a wine scene type spot so maybe that is why they didn't know how to make an Old Fasioned."}
{"text":"We tried several items on the menu. All were good, but my favorites were the Salt & Pepper Fries (and smoked ketchup dipping sauce), the Mini Cheeseburger sliders, the Meatballs and the Lost Bread. The service was top notch and the surroundings, as well.  Don't miss this place!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service and accommodation! Chelsea and Megan were on point and really took care of our group of 10. 

It's rare to feel compelled to leave a positive review, but the service was so good I just had to. Kudos to the team. 

Drinks were fantastic as well. Thanks for everything!"}
{"text":"I've been twice, and the food is delicious and the service has been great.  It gets pricey - my friend and I had three small dishes (one of which was french fries!) and I had one glass of wine and with tip it was over $50.  One of our dishes was the crab \"fondue\" (more like a dip)...it came with four small pieces of bread with which to scoop up the dip.  When the bread was gone our server said she could provide more bread... for $2.00.  Not happy about being \"nickel and dimed\" after spending $14 for a dip.  Most restaurants offer a complimentary basket of bread WAY larger than the four skimpy pieces of bread that come with the dip.  So, I know it sounds picky but the devil IS in the details. Little things like that can have a big impact."}
{"text":"First time to S&P, have been to Carson Kitchen most every time we visit LV.  We very much enjoyed the polenta, bacon & eggs -and the tenders and waffles (cheddar and jalapeño waffle). Both delicious along with Sunday Funda bottomless Bloody Mary or Mimosa options.  Keep it going!  Love it and will tell friends visiting!"}
{"text":"Love the view from this restaurant- they serve small plates. The Italian salad had a nice peppery flavor; the red curry shrimp was simply amazing and the steak was perfectly done - Med. Rare with a wonderful juniper berry dipping sauce. Service was exceptional and the lounge was very comfortable for a before-dinner cocktail."}
{"text":"Great cocktail bar great food I love that the bartenders are extremely clean, quick and attentive. Funny footnote I wanted a manly drink so I ordered a cocktail with gin when it got to me the delicious cocktail had an orchid in it, but the cleverly named gin city is feminine and phenomenal. Guys it completes you and ladies it compliments you."}
{"text":"The ambience is nice, view of the valley is great. Friendly staff, great food. The spicy shrimp was the favorite. Definitely returning soon."}
{"text":"Megan was a great bar tender and the spicy shrimp were perfect. Great \"pop\" when biting in and the sauce was fantastic."}
{"text":"My wife and I had a reservation for 6 PM on a Friday evening and they seated us right away. They have a number of areas that they serve and we were in the \"main\" open area. It was LOUD. We could barely hear each other across the table. 
We had the spinach artichoke appraiser. It came with four bread baguettes and our wait told us that since they were cooked that we could order more bread baguettes for $2. The spinach dip seemed spicier that most spinach dip I've had.
I had a beer and they had a selection total of only eight beers. They were mostly names I've never heard of. I let my server know I like Blue Moon and she suggested \"Bad Beat;\" it was no Blue Moon. 
I ordered the Pork Chop and a side of Grilled Broccolini. I thought it was a fancy name for a fancy preparation of broccoli. I was wrong. It was nothing like broccoli. I found out later that it was a cross between broccoli plant and asparagus. I hate asparagus - the manager nicely  took it back and took it off our check.
The pork chop came with a dish of apple butter. The apple butter was also spicy. The pork chop was very good and cooked well. 
With so many GREAT places to eat in Las Vegas, I doubt that we will be back."}
{"text":"I've been looking for a spot like this... truly a triple threat. Delivers on the 3 things that matter most: food, drinks, ambiance.  Every dish my date and I had we really enjoyed--it had unique flavors that married well together. The drinks were well contrived and served. And the ambiance was relaxed yet classy--works both for a stylish date night, as well as a casual get together for drinks with friends. Combine that with a reasonable to moderate price tag and a convenient location, it can't be beat."}
{"text":"Came here to celebrate an early bday dinner with my husband and 2 boys, and was very excited as this is in my neighborhood. Needless to say by the star I gave I was disappointed. 
   We arrive on a Friday night 7pm seemed to be steadily busy which is nice to see. We were greeted by a hostess and asked if we had reservations, we did not but still promptly seated which we appreciated. 
   The waitress came by to greet and tell us how the food is served in smaller portions almost tapas style. I already knew this as I do research on most of the restaurant's I visit prior. We ordered drinks nothing special lemonade, Sprite, waters, and something to start the kids off with mini burgers and salt and pepper fries. As the waitress dropped off drinks I made sure to order more food right since I have a 2 year old I try to get all my food in as soon as I can. We ordered the meatballs, calamari, and chicken thighs. This was good enough to start as I was still debating on a few more dishes and cocktail or wine. 
    The fries and mini burgers arrived timely and were pretty decent I mean for sliders and fries I've had better but it was a kid friendly dish so it was ok. This is where there was a turn of events. We waited after our our first round of food 10, 15, 20, minutes passed watching food being sent to all other tables around us. My husband even recognized 2 former colleagues of his so we know how long they had been sitting there. After 25 minutes of waiting we get the attention of our waitress to notify her we still hadn't received any other dishes. We saw her speak to the expediter and he seemed to not give a crap what she had to say because she then seemed to tell a manager of sorts who spoke to him and we soon received the meatballs and calamari, still no chicken thighs.
   The meatballs came and were served in a tomato sauce with \"Sunday\" gravy and were mildly warm and hard and dry. Calamari was served with peppers which were not spicy at all to disagree with the description given when they were dropped off and were soggy and rubbery. 
   At this point my little guy was over it my husband took him for a walk and still no chicken thighs which assisted my decision to not order anymore food ask for the check and let the waitress know I never got the food to my original order. Waitress proceeded to notify a different manager who then approached our table and introduce herself as the assistant GM. She apologized for the kinks in their system as they are a new restaurant and offered to take the chicken thighs off my bill since I never received them. Like I would ever pay for any item I never got! Overall 2 stars and sorry to say the food and kitchen staff is to blame as the table service wasn't the best but definitely not the worst I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Thankfully this is no longer Firefly, but I really missed the view & location so was totally excited when S&P opened!  Very friendly host, Megan the bartender was so personable, fun & had us try an orange, carrot concoction as she was experimenting.  I love that!  Frank was super awesome as well, totally knows his food & chef's wow!  5 stars from the start & now let's talk Happy Hour.

Aluxa C & Stephan joined me for HH $5-8, plus a free house red, white, Rose or beer for checking in.  I had both the Rose & a Cab which were good.  I also tried 'Chivalry Isn't Dead' lol love the name, which was a smooth honey w/ bourbon poured over an ice ball, yum!  I am a Kentucky Derby kind of woman & good critic of drinks like this, highly recommend it.  As Megan so eloquently put it, it was 'spirit forward.'  Good laughs girl! She's a mixologist I'm sure!  

Food wise, Beet Salad w/ this wonderful purée & goat cheese!  Ahh one of the top 3 in Vegas.  The Spicy Shrimp w/ this absolutely beautiful garlic bread that I wanted to use for the slider bread!  I mean so tasty.  The cute sliders w/ a Crisp waffle fry layered on top of the burger was great.  I just need it all on that garlic bread.  Mmm!  

Overall, I cannot wait to go back!  Next time, I am bringing more friends cause I cannot wait to try so much more!"}
{"text":"We went for their first brunch service -Mary's muffins and mimosas such a great restaurant-beautiful view, amazing decor and the food was delicious with a great price point. We brought our kids and they loved the complimentary zucchini muffins before the food came out -hurray for veggies they will eat 
The Bloody Mary bar was beautiful and the bottomless mimosas were done right with a bottle of champagne and carafe of ok at the table so you didn't have to wait to Order each Time 
I definitely recommend making reservations as this place was packed and very popular for good reason. The music gave a great party vibe to brunch too"}
{"text":"Two of us went to Standard Pour on Sept. 8th.  I had the meatballs which were very good, shared the tongue and cheek appetizer, also tasty and I tasted my friend's  salt & pepper fries.  My only complaint is that this restaurant in Anthem is expensive and I feel the portions are fairly small.  There were 5 meatballs  and were a little smaller than a golf ball for $14.00.  The Tongue and cheek consisted of 5 narrow rolled crepes and cost $22.00.  The fries were pretty generous but cost $10.00.

I ordered a Cosmo martini and it was just a medium size glass and I was charged $14.00.  Their specialty drinks are mostly $12.00 and are in a small martini or regular glass and not filled to the top.  We did not have wine so I can't comment on that.

They do not have a Happy Hour but they said they are working on it.  I would possibly return if they have a Happy Hour unless they cut the portion size even more.  There are just better places that also have good quality appetizers for far less money and larger portions.  The food was very good, but I only had meatballs and shared the Tongue and Cheek app. and had one Cosmo and I paid around $45.00 incl. tip and was by no means full.  

Many people from Sun City Anthem would go there but I doubt they will come back when they see what they end up paying."}
{"text":"HOORAY! finally a \"GOOD\" new restaurant in Henderson near Anthem!!!!!

   Visited the S & P on Friday night and was sooo pleasantly happy this will be a main stay for us ~ We really enjoy their sister restaurant in Downtown Las Vegas named Carson's Kitchen. So we are excited to have a spin off so close by!!!!

    Pleasantly designed with 3 sections, a lounge area, dining area & an outside patio area. Actually 4 if you count the seating at the bar..... Not over dressed just comfy & inviting. S & P features the basic cocktails PLUS craft cocktails too ~ I enjoyed the \"Listen Linda\" very refreshing and lite.

   Food is served \"Tapas\" style which is isn't exactly new in the restaurant biz, however S & P does it with a nice twist  calling it a \"Social\" menu ~ we started with the Gravlax! served very enticing with farmers cheese, orange caviar (probably whitefish caviar) dill, finely chopped red onion, capers and pumpernickel toast points, also needed to request additional pumpernickel as the gravlax is a generous portion. I am not a huge fan of smoked salmon or gravlax. I did try this and has a really nice texture & taste certainly glad I tried it! 
     Next were the meatballs.... more my style 5 to an order, and served in a modern bowl with Sunday Gravy which is a red marinara type sauce and topped with white cream sauce accent. Pretty to look at & DEEELISH to EAT! Cooked perfectly with a bit of a crunch on the outside and moist on the inside. I predict this will be a BIG seller ~
     Into every meal should be some type of potato.....the Salt & Pepper Fries baby! served with 3 dipping choices, homemade roasted tomato ketchup, a horseradish mustard and a basil mayo. YUMMY!!!
      AND YES! you must have a vegetable with dinner so the \"3 BEAN\" is a perfect answer for this. Assorted green & yellow string beans in an Asiany, soy & garlic sauce, making my mouth water just talking about it. Served al dente, (not over cooked, like my Mom cooked 'em!) really, really nice & flavorful.
    The SURPRISE selection was the Date & Bleu Cheese Jam. DEVINE DELICIOUSNESS on a toasted buttered almond baguette. Sweet with a slight kick of heat, just soooo GOOD! had to request more baguette as the jam is served in a plentiful sized dish.
     Our final selection was the Carrot Risotto. I LUV risotto so this was a no brainer for us! It is carrot so don't be put off by the color ~ very good, with black truffle, artichoke heart & aged pecorino ~ albeit a tad salty for our tastes. I would definitely order again, as we did mention to the manager the salt and she was appreciative for the feedback.
   Desserts are a plenty at Standard & Pour ~ we ordered 2! the Wine & Cheese Sundae which has cheesecake blonde, merlot ice cream with brandied cherries. & the Lost Bread both were EXCELLANT!!! is like a cinnamon roll in a bread pudding format with maple icing. This is a HUGE portion so one for the table is quite ample~ Honestly I could have eaten the entire slice, in my former life! JUST DEVINE SWEETNESS and a nice finish for our meal with friends.
    
  The reason for the 4 and not 5 stars, a few missteps. This is a new gastropub restaurant only open for 3 days so they are working out a few kinks, which is to be expected. As an example, we found the back ground music a little loud as the restaurant filled up it became quite noisy with everyone talking over it, remembering to bring serving spoons with each course, asking if anyone would like water, a beer glass needed to be refreshed.  All the hosts & servers were very pleasant, the manager & the chef both came by our table, the manager a couple times~ She did send out a complimentary Whole Cooked Romanesco ~ a very nice touch & probably something we would have never ordered. Tasted good with capers, red onion, golden raisins & fine herbs. ~ 
   Be sure to stop in, you will be happy to find the HOTTEST new destination in Henderson. Standard & Pour is open daily starting @ 4pm they take reservations, offer Take Out, valet & FREE Parking & Wi-Fi."}
{"text":"The people behind this restaurant know food. From the Snail Wellington to the Merlot Ice Cream on the Wine & Cheese Dessert, I was impressed with every dish I tried. Nicole was our server and she did a great job of explaining the dishes we had questions about. Don't let any of the dish names scare you off from trying them. The dish I was like \" Oh Hell No!!!\" about was the Snail Wellington and it turned out to be my favorite. From the staff to the food this place is the shiznit! I can't wait to go back and leave just as full as I did this time."}
{"text":"Great deals for bottomless options for Sunday brunch. Had the tenders and waffles which were also great. Bloody Mary bar let you spice up your drink however you wanted."}
{"text":"I was recommended S&P by a friend when my wife and I went house hunting in Las Vegas this past weekend. Were they ever right on the money. 

S&P is an elegant, modern restaurant, bar and hangout space (nearly 40% of the space seems filled with plush couches and chairs), with a fabulous view of the Strip off in the distance. It'd be a great place to just hang out from opening until close, chatting with friends and locals, enjoying shared apps, and downing refreshing cocktails.

The hosts, managers and servers are friendly, cheerful and professional. 

Not craving a huge meal, we elected to dine on small shared items at the bar.  Megan, our bartender,  led my wife and me through a culinary delight (\"You MUST try the spicy shrimp appetizer!\"- semi-direct quote) and suggested a few cocktails of *her* *own* *invention* to pair with the dishes; the true sign of a dedicated professional. Megan also pours an excellent Bulliet rye Manhattan!

It has been years since I've had a good steak tartare, and I was pleased with the results. Surprisingly, one of my favorites of the night was the chopped Italian salad, featuring cured salame and three types of cheeses. I could dine on it once a week. 

I was also glad to see pepperoncinis adorning the calamari; a flavor combo I haven't had the pleasure of experiencing since my days of living in Savannah, Ga. Great choice, S&P!!!!

All-in-all, the future looks bright for Standard & Pour. The view at night is stunning and nearly all-encompassing, the decor is comfortable, the chefs are on their game, and the staff are friendly will even make a first time diner feel like one of the regulars. 

A big thanks once more to our bartender/server Megan and server Crystal for taking our evening a step beyond. We will be back, once we're living in Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Awesome new bar in Henderson I love the fact that there is no smoke or slot machines here!! Great great food and drink specials! We found our new favorite hangout :)"}
{"text":"Pure quality. S&P checks all the boxes: an exquisite, comfortable dining room, friendly & personal service, a stunning view of the Strip & Las Vegas Valley, a fantastic craft cocktail list, and food that will blow you away with overwhelming creativity and flavor. All of the dishes are designed for sharing, so we had fun tasting several items on the menu: Spicy Shrimp, Crispy Oysters, Carrot Risotto, and Ribeye Cap were all phenomenal, and choosing a favorite is nearly impossible. And if that wasn't enough, the Lost Bread dessert was the perfect sweet touch to end the evening. Prices are extremely reasonable, especially considering the quality and detail that goes into each dish.

If you are in search of a great meal in Henderson, look no further. S&P has raised the bar to a whole new level."}
{"text":"Gorgeous restaurant, great food, amazing service! I loved the spicy shrimp, the three bean salad and the panacotta. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Happy Hour at Standard and Pour was tasty and fun as we explored both the happy hour and full menu. Isn't it funny how sometimes the simple things can be the most enjoyable? Standard and Pour's Salt and Pepper Fries served with three dipping sauces (basil aoli, horseradish mustard, and smokey ketsup). I prefer my fries cooked just a bit more, but I can't complain because they were so addicting we ordered it three times! Good thing it was on the Happy Hour menu at $5/per!

The Date & Bleu Cheese Jam served with bacon bread (yeah, you heard me. Bacon. Bread.) was sweet, and you can order extra bread if needed for a couple of bucks. The sliders were good, just not memorable compared to the other dishes, like the Spicy Shrimp. Yes, it's spicy and oh-so-good with a hint of coconut flavor. The Spicy Shrimp is served with a couple pieces of toast - perfect for sopping up the flavorful sauce.

As for drinks - we went straight to ordering off the full menu when we saw the delectable descriptions of their crafty cocktails:

Man Candy includes peach vodka and moscato and is fresh and fruity. Then there's Listen Linda with tequila, fresh lime, pink peppercorns, and pineapple (so good!). I was surprised how much I liked my stepdaughter's First Date of grapefruit vodka, fresh lime, and atomized mezcal - I thought it would be too bitter but instead it was smooth and refreshing. The Red Cherry Sangria is on the Happy Hour menu and is sooo easy to sip, as is the House Punch. Thanks to Victoria for a pleasant 1st-time experience!

Here's a tip: check in on Yelp for a free glass of wine or beer.

Stems up!"}
{"text":"Yummy food with great views! Krystal was awesome and helpful!"}
{"text":"What a place!  The food, the service, and the staff were all amazing. It was so hard to pick our favorite dish because everything was so good. The GM treated us so good. He stopped by the table and made perfect recommendations.  The drinks were also so good. The play on an old fashion - just wow. Then to top it off you have an amazing view of the strip. Take a little extra time and go off the strip and eat here. You will not be disappointed.  I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"A great choice for Sunday Brunch!

Located on the second level facing Eastern, I spotted Standard and Pour easily.  I had arrived pretty early as they were about to open so parking was open.  Upon leaving I noticed it was quite packed so it seems it could get a bit tricky.   The dining area is quite welcoming.  The main dining room is on the right with a smaller comfy lounge area on the left.  

Service here is very attentive.  Our waitress had an eye on our table at all times.  When our food was ready it was immediately brought out so it was fresh and ready to eat.  

Lauren, an excellent foodie, is a favorite to dine with as we love to split multiple items.  Splitting is key here since we order an abundance of food.  Aside from the mini muffin basket they bring to the table, we ordered the Real Big Muffin.  This is the perfect description since it's as big as our heads.  Almond, blueberry and lemon flavor indulge every bite.  The name is fitting and you'll probably have to take some home.  It was scrumptious! 

Also on our order was the Garden Chopped Salad, Patty Melt and Muffins & Gravy.  The Muffins & Gravy won the top prize for me.  The corn muffin had a great habanero kick.  Of course the chorizo gravy just enhanced it.  I would recommend this dish for ones that like a little spice. 

The salad and party Melt were good but nothing over the top.  I wish the sandwich had more caramelized onion as I don't remember many on the sandwich.  
The Chopped Garden salad was good as well giving me a good balance of greens to my meal. 

The menu is fun and eclectic.  It's definitely on my recommendation list."}
{"text":"For years, this location seemed to be jinxed. Each restaurant that opened here met an early demise. However, I think Standard and Pour is set to break the trend. We came here with friends for HH, sitting in the lounge just after sundown. The view of the city lights is spectacular.
Krystal, our server, was by almost immediately with a welcoming smile and to explain the HH offerings. Beers for $5 was a nice way to start. For food, we started with the french fries with 3 dipping sauces - a seasoned ketchup, a spicy mustard, and a third mayonnaise based sauce. Each very yummy. Next we got Caesar salad, mini-burgers, meatball sliders, kimchi tacos, and spicy shrimp. While each was very good, the spicy shrimp was outstanding (beware - may be a bit too hot for the Gringo palate!!) And to make matters even better, a Yelp check in got me my beer for free!
A very nice addition to the neighborhood.
I will be back.

Having had the good experience with HH, we wanted to try S&P for dinner. While the view from the dining room is theoretically the same as from the bar area, the table set up is such that unless you are a party of 2 sitting by the window, the tables in the dining room minimize the access to the view. That is a shame. Service in the dining room was inattentive at best (except for the wine steward). And the food was just OK, certainly not \"celebrity chef\" quality.
Bottom line - I will go back for a happy hour, but no repeat for dinner."}
{"text":"Chef John Courtney and Cory Harwell have a tremendous hit on their hands! What an amazing experience. Run, don't walk!"}
{"text":"They have done a great job with the decor makeover from when Firefly was in that location.  The view is fantastic.  The ambience is fabulous.  The food is delicious.  I love, love, love their sliders. And, they do cool drink presentations in the lounge. All in all, a fun place to relax and have fun."}
{"text":"I really really wanted to like this place. Second time here and I will not come back. 

If you are coming here for the food, turnaround.

If you were coming here for the atmosphere with your friends and family, this is definitely your spot.

For brunch- Go to Craft kitchen down the street OR Born and Raised. 

The place and atmosphere I absolutely love. 

Food is overrated.  

Zucchini muffins were dry and have too much cinnamon. Got the steak and eggs. Steak was chewy and bland with zero flavor. Pretty much the worst steak I have ever eaten. My daughter got the breakfast sandwich. She hated it and said the Aoli tasted like grass. 

$%&@  was our server. She was also my server when I had dinner once before. She is nice, but always seemed rushed. Today I specifically had one request to not have salt on the rim of my bloody Mary. Because she's a talker and not a listener, of course, it came out with salt. She didn't bother to bring a steak knife for my steak. Forgot the jam for my toast. Had to get up and asked multiple times for things she forgot.

Wasn't relaxing or enjoyable.

This place is way overrated.

If you're looking to see outside while you dine. The windows are completely fogged up so it's like you're in a box."}
{"text":"So yummy! The food was great! Tried about 6 dishes, good.  I thought 2 of the dishes the chic thighs & fries were a touch overly salted but definitely still tasty. The shrimp was spicy, flavorful good spicy, it's just a heads up to those that aren't into spice. Side perks: lots of non alcoholic beverages to choose from yay for coconut water!"}
{"text":"I was expecting it to be a little more dressy to be honest. The restaurant is in a strip mall upstairs and the view is nothing exciting. The food was pretty good. Our server did not ask if my salad was going to be a meal or app, so my meal came out 15 mins earlier than my guest. I wish she would have asked! I did love my drink, the man candy. It was so yummy! I thought my salad was pretty good. I got the chopped Italian but I wish it didn't have cabbage...my guest got the strip steak which I really enjoyed. It was severely under cooked but i still enjoyed it! I will probably be back for happy hour but don't plan on coming back for a \"fancy\" dinner."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed happy hour; great food, drinks and ambience. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came here for happy hour around 6pm, there were a few people at the bar but other than it was pretty slow. We were seated and ask for drinks immediately, we then ordered and around 6:30 they got busy! People started coming in and it was clear that they were understaffed! After our food was served we did not see our waitress for a long while but we could see that she was just busy with so many other tables! We waited a good 20 minutes after finishing our food for her to bring us the check. Not a big deal since it was HH and we were chatting and enjoying the view. 

The HH menu was ok, definitely had better for around the same price range. I really liked the mac and cheese bites, and the beet cups were also pretty good, the rest of the item were mediocre. The wings were the worst!! So extremely salty and flavorless, tasted like they were dipped in salt and fried. 

Overall good service when the waitress was not slammed, food was hit and miss. It was our first time here for HH, most likely won't be coming back for HH."}
{"text":"I'm a bigger fan of Carson Kitchen than I am of S&P. The dishes here sound great and most of them looked pretty good, but I was underwhelmed when it came time to taste what we ordered. The location is great, with amazing views and a date-night sophistication and service to match, but I can't eat the ambiance.

We started with the dish my guy was most excited for, the crispy oysters, which were beautiful!... but flavor-wise, they didn't have much going on and they were oddly served fried yet cold. We didn't even want to finish the dish after trying it. 
Disappointed, we moved on to the carrot risotto: the sweetness of the carrots offset by the salty pecorino was lovely, but my dining companion felt the dish itself was undercooked.
Then we had the venison tartare, which was only mildly gamey but I did not care at all for the sweeter flavor accents found in the cherry mostarda. The tongue and cheek agnolotti was richness on richness with little flavor aside from the sauce it was drowning in. Again, the fresh pasta looked beautiful but the filling was an unremarkable mush. It has since been removed from the menu.
The wine and cheese sundae dessert was almost a hit, with a great juxtaposition of merlot ice cream and a thick cheesecake blondie, but this was another dish marred by cherries- this time in brandied form. Again, we ate around them.

I'll be back to try their HH, but I'm not rushing to do so. The menu has enough variety that I'm sure there are other things I'll enjoy but again, I prefer Carson Kitchen- I can pretty much throw a dart and be pleased with anything I order there and I was expecting S&P to be a step above. In all regard except for flavor, it was. 

Note there's valet. It's not mandatory, but if you opt to park yourself available spots are limited and you'll be gifted a look that clearly suggests you should dine elsewhere. Maybe I should have expected that in Anthem, but I'm not a fan of people being in my car, and I'd prefer to spend more of my money on food."}
{"text":"This new spot in the location of what used to be Firefly. Parking can be tight, but it's worth it. And the view of Strip is great.

It's all small plates of fancied up American food. Tip: The happy hour deals are awesome! So opt to sit in the bar or lounge area and enjoy your cost-savings. I really appreciated that the happy hour food was full portion, not partial like you find at some other places.

We were super hungry, so we went a bit crazy. We had sliders, mac 'n' cheese, date and blue cheese jam, kimchi tacos, and fries with a trio of dipping sauces. Everything was very yum. The mac 'n' cheese and jam were the standouts, though.

They also have good drink happy hour deals - cocktails, beer, and wine. The cocktails were unique and tasty. Tip: Check-in on Yelp and get a free glass of wine or beer.

The ambiance and decor are pleasant and modern. It's a good place to chill and enjoy great drinks and food.

The only thing keeping this place from 5 stars for me is the service. Perhaps it's because we were in the lounge area (as opposed to the dining area) or perhaps they were understaffed on the night we went. But whatever the reason, the service was spotty. We had to always flag down someone if we needed something.

All in all, I will definitely be coming back here, especially for happy hour."}
{"text":"The most amazing food. Chef John Courtney has outdone himself! Mac and cheese, kimchi tacos, and the view are so fantastic!"}
{"text":"Brunch is Amazing!!! I love the muffins and gravy, the big ass muffin is delicious too! My fiancé got the steak and eggs and that was so good too!! I recommend the Bloody Mary bar, it's great! Service is fantastic and the music is great!!!"}
{"text":"I've now been here twice. Both times we've ordered from the \"happy hour menu.\"  Both times, we've been more than impressed.  

Tonight we sat at the bar.  Service is super friendly and efficient. The menu is small, but all items are amazing, well thought out, great ingredients and A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!

Check in with Yelp and get the first beer or wine in the house. Nice touch!

They're 1/2 mile from our house.  We are sold."}
{"text":"Great location, beautiful decor!  Servers were not friendly and did not smile with any customers.  We ordered several dishes. We were told they would come out separately which was great for visiting and sipping. Salt and pepper fries were hot and tasty and a great start.  Everything after that was room temp and uneventful!!! Presentation was blah!!!  Calamari greasy and cold!  Every thing else was lacking creativity and taste!  It was like a amateur was trying to cook professional dishes!  Merlot ice cream tasty but was on a hard, dry brownie.   Sorry!  Save your $$$ !!!!"}
{"text":"Hidden in a strip mall, this gem is definitely an awesome find in Henderson. We came here twice, once for dinner and another for brunch (which just started 1/2017). The dinner service is a small plate concept, whereas the brunch is mostly individual plates
-----------
Dinner: Great service & amazing bar menu
Carrot Risotto: could not taste the black truffle but had tons of carrot flavor. We got a second one because we enjoyed the first so much.

Kimchi Taco: Tender and flavorful steak

Date & Bleu cheese jam: delicious spread for bread. we asked for more bread in addition to the few that they gave us

Venison Tartare: Not a big fan of tartare in general, but this one was really creamy and delicious with the toast

Roasted Beet salad: Pretty good, but not super memorable

Mini burgers: Sliders with juicy patties, great for sharing

Snail Wellington: My favorite dish of the night. Must order if you like escargot

Wine & Cheese sundae: not my favorite dessert. interesting concept with merlot ice cream, but I probably wont get again

Lost bread: HUGE portion of bread, and definitely way too much food since we were full already.

Fruit loop panna cotta: not what I was expecting and no fruit loops here! Great blend of flavors with the raspberry gummy and panna cotta

-------------------------
Brunch: Great service. Multiple options for bottomless mimosas/bloody marys, with a bloody mary bar to add anything you'd like

Steak & Eggs: NY strip was cooked to medium rare and topped with eggs as you choose. Comes with toast. Pretty standard

Real Big Muffin: No joke, this muffin is REAL BIG. This was enough to feed all of 5 of us and not order anything else, but of course we took the rest home. The crumble topping was amazing, and the lemon blueberry almond cake was really moist and tasty

Patty Melt: Probably my favorite entrée at brunch. Really good flavor and a little spicy if you can handle some heat

Tenders & Waffle: Totally overcooked chicken tenders (burnt) and waffles with way too much jalapeno. I think we got a bad batch, and I'm sure that its usually better than what we had."}
{"text":"Wow, this place was even better than I expected.  Great service and everything we ordered was interesting and expertly prepared.  Will be back often now."}
{"text":"This place is what Henderson has needed!! The food, the drink, the decor and the views!! We started with the Garden Tomato appetizer and Salt & Pepper fries. The First Date cocktail has just enough sweet tart to satisfy! Then Calamari and Snail Wellington with Tongue & Cheek Agnolotti for the main meal. Friday nights get a reservation the place is packed!!"}
{"text":"We tried them out for brunch on a Sunday around 11am. 

At first it seemed like they wouldn't have a regular table for us without a reservation, but then they seated us at a regular table anyway. So that was nice. Otherwise, they had mentioned we would be welcome to sit at the bar or some lower lounge-ier seating (which we felt wouldn't be very comfortable for eating).

The general decor is comfortable. The view, if you get a table by the windows, is quite nice. The service felt odd. Overall, nothing overtly wrong, just a general feeling that the servers would rather you or they be someplace else.

Basically, the food is acceptably good (not particularly great), but the service turned us off enough that we don't feel a desire to return. But you can probably have an okay experience here if you were to give it a try."}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic! We were met at the door by the manager Ed and seated promptly. We made a reservation on Open Table and got to pick our preferred seat in the restaurant. We were very surprised with the Caesar salad, it's one of the best I've ever had. There's some pepper thing going on in there that I can't discern but it's amazing. Next we had the kimchi tacos which were divine and also the Snails Wellington, what a great idea and even better execution. The spicy shrimp was amazing, almost too spicy for my wife, but I'll have it again for sure. The oysters were also fantastic. Will probably make this place our new home, it's that good. Do yourself a favor and go! Ask for Nicole as your server, she really cares about your experience, genuinely. It was quite refreshing to have a server as honest and caring as her."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to checking this place out for a while.  Unfortunately, it did not live up to my expectations.  The food seemed cheap and low quality for the price that I was paying. The tuna on the tartar was mealy.  I have had better sliders at a gaming bar.  The best thing was the Italian chopped salad. Also, no toilet paper in the bathroom and service was mediocre."}
{"text":"great food but surprised that we were charged 2 bucks 4 extra bread.  Twice we were offered this ( we said yes the 2nd time).  We were not told there would be a charge nor is this mentioned on the menu.  2 bucks is not a big deal but the way this was done has cost them 2 loose my business and that of my friends as well."}
{"text":"Excellent, excellent, excellent. I go to Vegas a lot for work, and that will increase in the future. I will go to dinner here as much as I can, because it's amazing food for a great price in the area. Forget the fancy places on the Strip that ream you with their prices ($18 for one scallop? Really?!). It's worth the short drive/Uber to this restaurant to get a great meal. My wife and I recently attended at the recommendation of an Uber driver, and we loved it. We both ordered steaks and then split a salad plus an appetizer. Throw in four drinks, and the bill was less than $80 before tip. The steaks were perfect, and the rub seasoning was amazing. The caesar dressing was simply divine, and the spinach dip was HOT in a good way (if you like it spicy). The service was superb, and the ambience was really enjoyable, too. We had a window table, and it afforded us a nice view of the Strip. That was a nice bonus. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Stunning display of well thought out dishes, a bit genre bending but each item really stood its ground from a flavor & value standpoint. We had about 3/4s of the menu and it's hard to pick a standout but the calamari, curried shrimp & wings and must have items for sure. That being said you can't really go wrong,try them all. Cocktails were ingenious and really well executed, looking forward to coming back and trying the rest. 
Thank you!"}
{"text":"We went for Sunday brunch and we will be back for more! We ordered the Bacon & Egg Polenta, and the Muffins & Gravy. I was worried the Muffins & Gravy habanero corn bread muffin would be overwhelmingly spicy, but I was surprised at how much I loved it. They found the perfect balance of sweet and spicy. The chorizo red eye gravy on top was fantastic. The Bacon and Egg Polenta was epic. The hunks of bacon and the creamy polenta bites were perfect together. I will be back to get it again."}
{"text":"Finally feeling adventurous enough to try something new to eat. So I'm at the Standard & Pour for happy hour today. I love this place! Figured I would since it's the same chef from Carson's Kitchen downtown. The service was very friendly from my waitress and the hostess. Ate in the lounge which is super comfy with a great view from the second floor. The Mac and cheese bites are divine!! The meatballs are pretty as a picture and taste just as good, packed with lots of flavor. Not a lot of food for the price, more of a nice date night dinner place, but I'll definitely be back. Helps that it's so close to me in anthem, on eastern just before Anthem starts. Also got a free glass of wine for checking in on yelp!!!"}
{"text":"We came here for Happy Hour. My girls and I had wine, sangria and another drink off the Haopy Hour menu. The MAC & cheese were delicious. We ordered a few of these. One of the servers gave us an order of Kimchi tacos on the house. That was soooooo good! If I didn't fill myself up with trying other things my friends ordered and the yummy Mac and cheese, I would have ordered another round of kimchi tacos."}
{"text":"Absolutely spectacular. The location is stunning. The food fabulous & service was best of all"}
{"text":"Thank you Standard and Pour for a great night. You didn't disappoint. The Anthem communities have been starved for a restaurant where you can receive quality service, experience a beautiful dining/bar space, enjoy artisanal cocktails and eat food that isn't \"Run of the Mill\", like so many restaurants in the area. The space has been updated, expanded and feels good. Loved the various options on the cocktail menu and landed on a Listen Linda, damn good. The food menu being creative and didn't disappoint. From the hostesses at the front door, our server (Chase), assistant general manager and bus staff the evening was a winner. I'm looking forward to my next visit. Standouts on the food menu were the carrot risotto and black cod, though the entire menu looks delicious."}
{"text":"OMG delicious... 
Must haves 
Calamari. Snow Crab Fondue ( more like a snow crab dip) so worth it delicious!!!! Spicy shrimp was great and the mac n cheese!!! Cocktails were delicious as well!!! Need to go back for Happy Hour"}
{"text":"We checked this out the first week of opening! We walked in and were told we would be seated in about 15 minutes. So we went and sat at the bar. Unfortunately we had a bartender who thought very highly of himself. We ordered two traditional drinks, by the way he made them, you would have thought he was baking a cake from scratch, along with an attitude. 
We were seated for dinner and tried several items. The oysters, which were outstanding. The sliders, which were ok, and a salad that was that was so bad, I can't remember much about it, but that I didn't like the taste. 
Along with the all about me bartender, the server was ok. She may have been still learning the menu. Didn't really recommend anything. 
The atmosphere is nice, however the dim lights make it hard to read the menu. Overall I liked it. Not sure if in an area of families and retirees that a demographic of 20 to 30 somethings will venture out to Henderson to give it a try and keep it going."}
{"text":"Great to see this neighborhood location open again and with a new hip restaurant. They have a very nice and simple menu with items listed as Vegetable, Fish, Meat. Servings are tapas style but a little bit larger than traditional tapas. A decent wine menu, nice cocktail bar and seating outdoors on the balcony (great view of the city) and inside make this a nice place to socialize with friends or have a quick bite. We had Tuna Tartare, Salt & Pepper Fries and Wine & Cheese Sundae! Just, WOW! The chef and staff are all attentive and friendly. We look forward to future visits."}
{"text":"The food was really good here a little pricey but for the quality worth it.  Spicey shrimp and charred beans are amazing!  They do charge extra for bread which I think is crazy!  Overall satisfied with my visit"}
{"text":"Service was excellent! Decor was great! Spicy shrimp appetizer was amazing. Calamari was good. Prices where a bit high, but they do offer a happy hour everyday. We came for dinner so we chose not to do hh. The Icelandic cod was great. Cocktails are good and not too sweet."}
{"text":"The restaurants appearance is great, the food is good, but... the portions are so tiny and the prices are crazy expensive. For a neighborhood location, this place COULD be great. Too bad."}
{"text":"Can't beat their happy hour!  The shrimp is a must try.  It reminds me of good ole New Orleans!  Get two orders of the mac n cheese!  The date and blue cheese jam was excellent, but the last time I ordered it, it didn't have enough blue cheese which made it a bit tart.  Service was always attentive - they definitely knew when I wanted another glass of wine!  Seating is a bit uncomfortable on the booths... it's a little hard to digest good food and drinks when you're hunched over the low cocktail tables."}
{"text":"Great food, amazing atmosphere, and friendly staff; however, was left with a sour taste when I was silently charged $18 in total for carbonated water refills. Otherwise, good stuff."}
{"text":"I'm so glad we are finally getting decent restaurants out in Anthem. The food is superb. Bacon jam is the awesome. The view is killer. Only complaint is it can get rather noisy in the main room."}
{"text":"Henderson represent! 

Why is this place so great? 

A) It's across the street from my house
B) The Food! Meatball Sliders, King Crab Fondue. 
C) The service was incredibly attentive and fast 
D) The View! I can see Sunrise Mtn. from here!

I finally was in town long enough to enjoy an afternoon cocktail and Standard and Pour's happy hour is on point. First off, happy hour is offered every day from 4 pm - 7 pm and all the food on it starts at five dollars. Mac n' Cheese, Seafood Ceviche, King Crab Fondue, Meatball Sliders, Calamari, S&P Fries and the list goes on! They also have a full menu inspired by the late Kerry Simon, so you know everything will be amazing and flavorful. 

We went with the S&P fries, Meatball Sliders and the King Crab Fondue and a few cocktails. The Meatballs Sliders very good, the meatball was juicy with a slight spice. These came covered in marinara sauce and cheese, but the bread was just a tad too thick. The meatball sliders were the perfect compliment to the S&P fries, which came with three dipping sauces all were good, but the pesto dipping sauce was drinkable. I dunked a slider or two in this green puddle of Exorcist-like goo, nummers!

The King Crab Fondue came with spinach, artichoke and hearty, gooey cheese blend. This dish was more of a hot dip than a fondue, but nonetheless, it was delicious. Creamy, cheesy with a slight taste of king crab and not to seafoody at all. Normally, I hate artichokes, but this savory stuff was an addictingly fun snack food. 

I washed it all down with a whiskey-based cocktail, \"Rye Me a River.\" This drink was fantastic, insane flavor, not too sweet and totally worth ordering twice. Rye whiskey with Port, egg white and lemon, this combination frothed up with egg white was perfect with the lemon mellowing out the sweetness of the Port. This drink is a must order. 

I really enjoyed Standard & Pour, and this spot will become a \"standard\" happy hour mainstay."}
{"text":"Everyone who knows me knows I love finding new places that have a cool cocktail menu and bomb food is definitely a plus! Came across this place while searching around Eastern and what do you know saw some yelp friends give good reviews so why not try for myself :)

Major plus right away if that they have a food and drink happy hour everyday from 4pm-7pm. Yup that's right, EVERYDAY! And everything is either $5 or $8. Score! Plus all of their specialty cocktails are $12. Makes me happy seeing everything with the same price lol.. As for vibe and \"hippness\", there's a lot of marble, velvet, and wood. Colors are also on the warmer sexy hues of dark browns, greys, black and purples. Also, for all the ladies, yes they are located on the second floor but there is an elevator leading directly up into the restaurant (kinda like the elevator leading from the parking garage in Fashion Show up to Maggianno's and Capital Grille) so don't be scared to bust out those stilettos! So onto the important stuff, taste!

Mini Burgers $8 HH: Fontina, Tomato Relish, Waffle Fry. Pretty juicy prepared medrare and the relish gave it a nice kick! Fontina was also nicely melted. 
Kimchi Tacos $8 HH: Kalbi Flank Steak, Asian Pear Slaw. Really liked the freshness of the slaw and the Kalbi wasn't too sweet like in some places. 
Mac & Cheese $5 HH: Cheddar, Havarti, Fontina, Port Wine. Creamy and a great deal for $5.

White Peach Sangria $8 HH: Could really taste the peach and there was nice sweetness from the elderflower liqueur. 
Rye Me A River $12: Mr. Kitty was super happy with this one, he said it reminded him of a mix between a classic whiskey sour and clover club. 
Swipe Right $12: This sounds weird but I mean it a good way, like drinking the liquid form of pesto lmao
Gin City $12: Refreshing, sweet, & very floral. All my favorites in a drink :)

All in all I really liked this place especially since it's closer to my side of town. Great place to hang out since they have a larger lounge area and an outdoor patio with city view as well. As for all the talk about the valet, this spot is still located in a shopping center so just don't park right in front of it. Park to the side like I did in front of the nail salon or tutoring place. Boom problem solved. I'll definitely be back, probably bring a couple friends as well :)"}
{"text":"Awesome food, tapas-like. I have tried nearly everything on the menu and was impressed with it all. Only negative is the menu is a little small, not much rotation of different items . It Could benefit by having weekly specials."}
{"text":"Happy hour used to be great. Changed menu so now instead of getting a normal sized appetizer they shrunk everything to a 2-3 bite, tiny portion. Management should go to Mortons or Flemings for happy hour to see what their successful  competition is doing for happy hour. On a positive note, the staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"While visiting Vegas, it is easy to get swept up in all the glitz and glamour of the Las Vegas Strip, but don't let that stop you from exploring other food destinations outside the neon lights. S&P is located on a second floor of an unassuming plaza. It has a lot of open space, a few separate areas to dine and lounge. I decided to sit at the bar and enjoy the semi-inebriated chatter of other patrons. 

For my drink, I chose the \"I Believe\" made with Wild Turkey 101 Bourbon, Elderflower Liqueur, and Pineapple Gomme. At first sip the drink was quite perfect, but as I kept sipping it throughout the night, it kept getting a lot more sweeter. At the end, I couldn't really finish it. 

I decided to try some of the more adventurous dishes on the menu starting with the Snail Wellington. Little puff pastry wrapped escargot with garlic and parsley. You could pretty much serve me a bucket of these and I would be very, very happy. This was followed by the Venison Tartare with cherry mostarda, quail egg yolk, and a sprinkle of white chocolate. The meat itself was well cut, albeit having a few pieces still connected, but the flavor was getting muddled by the sweetness of the mostarda and white chocolate. The dish needed a lot more salt and black pepper. For the last dish, I hesitantly ordered the Carrot Risotto which came highly recommended by the barwoman. The rice was very well cooked, but the overall dish was nothing but sweetness. It lacked any sort of balance and seemed incredibly one note. The artichoke hearts on the dish were canned and so were the pieces of black truffle. I made that very clear by only having two bites of it and setting aside the rest as well as mentioning it to her when asked if I enjoyed it. Even getting a confirmation of all the canned items.  

When the check came, I was a little surprised to still see the risotto on the bill, but decided that it wasn't worth a conversation. Although I'm sure there are plenty of other establishments that wouldn't even dare to charge for it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in all of Henderson! Do yourself a favor and join them for dinner!"}
{"text":"Standard and Pour is very modern and upscale! The food is amazing and service is superb. Few of my favorites you have to try! 
Salt and pepper fries: I'm not sure what they put on them but they are the best type of fries I've ever tasted!
Smoked romenesco is to die for something so unique but so good. I do not like oysters but the crispy oysters was the best dish of the night. 
This is one of the most modern and lively restaurants I've been to in Las Vegas, best part about it is that they are off the strip and close to work!
If you haven't tried it out yet, you should check it out such a great place!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing. I read great reviews on social media and yelp. We drove all the way from Summerlin to try this place out. They didn't have 3 menu items. The food we got wasn't that great. The only thing decent was the calamari. The Moscow mules were decent, but no copper mug."}
{"text":"Wonderful experience from beginning to end! We will definitely go back and bring our family and friends!! The salt and pepper fries were a great start, the Ribeye Cap was a very tender and flavorful piece of steak and the meatballs were great!! Dessert was a must! The Lost Bread and the Wine and Cheese Sundae were the perfect end to our meal! Service was wonderful! Both managers came over to us, and the server, Preston, was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive! Looking forward to our next visit!!"}
{"text":"First time trying this place 3 weeks ago. I like it. I reside here and another state. They have good food n drinks. Small tapas style sharing"}
{"text":"In downtown Las Vegas there is an explosion of fine dining and good food establishments where you can get small plate food in a great atmosphere. Standard and Pour is a fine downtown restaurant in Henderson. The food was amazing..recommend the sliders and the meatballs. Also Ed, the general manager was very professional and made our party feel extremely welcome. The view of the city is also amazing. Service was great! They are also starting a brunch service sometime soon that the wife and I will check out. Will for sure be back and love this little gem of a fine eatery so close to our house!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my wife tonight.  I had High expectations after reading other yelp reviews and seeing some of the pictures.  To be honest, I was very disappointed.

Apparently they recently changed the menu, and it just didn't look very exciting.

We ended up picking a few things to try.

The meatball appetizers.  Frankly, The worst meatballs I think I've ever had. I have had better frozen bagged meatballs from Costco. These meatballs were really small and way overcooked, so they dried out very easily. Just seem like a rookie chef mistake. Also the menu said that it was housemade ricotta cheese.  It was more like a ricotta foam which lacked all of the great things about ricotta. No creaminess, no substance.  Just a badly conceived idea and even worse execution.

The Curry coconut spicy shrimp.  Good, but not great. They served it with bread that was toasted, but it just needed something. Maybe a garlic bread with some salt and/or butter would've added some more flavor.  The shrimp were cooked fine and the sauce was just the right amount of heat. So I would give this a 3 1/2 out of 5.

The cocktail, I bought a peach cocktail. I don't remember the name. It was just too intense with some background aftertaste, that I couldn't appreciate it. It didn't have any flavor of peach in my opinion. Fortunately, the waitress was nice enough to take this off the bill.

The chateaubriand.  I have had chateaubriand many places and love it.  This just seem to be butchered. No pun intended. It was not at all tender, and frankly was flavorless. I don't know if they forgot to season it, but it really lacked any flavor. I ate about two small bites and left the rest.  And, it was way too overpriced for such a poor piece of meat.

The Mac n cheese.  - this was the best mac & cheese I've ever had. Seriously.  If it wasn't for the mac & cheese I would've probably given at least one star if not two less.  This had the right combination of cheeses, the right texture, very creamy, and the port reduction and breadcrumbs on top, made it.  I actually ordered one of these to go, because it was so good.

Bottom line between the mac & cheese and the service of the waitress, I gave them an extra star.  But... I still don't know if I could ever go back.  In fact, I bought the extra mac & cheese, because I suspect I probably won't go back.  Sorry, not sorry.

Really had high hopes,  wish it was much better.

Over-cooked meatballs????  Seriously??"}
{"text":"Great food and drinks!!!! It's a grown up bar. Megan the bartender....is a real bar tender that likes to talk to the patrons. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Totally love everything we tried, service was amazing 
Loved the beat salad and my husband loved the tuna tartare and the salmon."}
{"text":"Meal #2 at Standard & Pour was just as good.  This time I went for brunch and had a nice meal for 2 with 2 bottomless mimosas for $60 - insane deal for Vegas.  Exquisite indoor area and good service made the meal great.

We had the chicken and waffles and the bacon and egg polenta, accompanied with orange, pineapple (awesome!) and cranberry mimosas.  The mimosas were freshly squeezed and the cool part was they actually give you the champagne bottle so you can pour as much as you want.  The dishes were fantastic.  The jalapeno waffles were somehow spicy yet burnt to perfection and the bacon egg polenta was a great dish with the polenta in a hash brown/potato that gushed open with each bite.  Accompany the meal with a few complementary muffins to begin and fresh sourdough toast, and the meal was great.

The only negative aspect of the meal was that they had a strict 3pm cutoff fo serving more champagne.  This would be fine, but we were done with our previous champagne by 1:45pm and never were offered a refill.  We left at 3:30pm and saw plenty of bottles still out on tables so that as a little unfortunate.  Next time we come, we'll be sure to come a little earlier to experience full bottomless meal.  Otherwise, I was very pleased.  We did not make a reservation and arrived at 1pm and were seated immediately so no worries with wait time."}
{"text":"I was recently in Vegas staying at M Resort for a meeting.  A group of us were looking to get off property, checked yelp, and Standard & Pour popped up with strong reviews.  In short, outstanding!  The service was spot on, a well rounded and tasty craft cocktail menu, and the food was out of this world.   Some very interesting dishes as well.  There were 4 of us and we ordered a potpourri of dishes.  While the the carrot rissotto and chicken thighs definitely ranked as favorites, I will return specifically to order the venison tar tar again; simply delicious!

Price Point: moderate by US standards and cheap by Vegas standards.  For a full-service restaurant with top drinks and nice ambiance, the total bill was $162, and we all ate and drank well."}
{"text":"Chad and his staff went the extra mile to make our dinner very enjoyable.  The food, Las Vegas Restaurant Week fare, was spectacular and prepared and presented promptly and piping hot.  Kudos!  We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been to a restaurant that deserves a 4 star . I read the review and decide to drive in 45 minutes in traffic to try this place. I was concern when I sat down , the restaurant was  a little shaky . Lol you'll find out why if you visit ...The atmosphere is beautiful . The menu is simple with some unique dishes. I didn't expect much , but to my surprise the execution of each dish was very delicious . The flavor was perfect , comparable to my dinners at the Strip . My waitress Christine was helping and friendly . My overall experience was excellent."}
{"text":"Incredible restaurant! The food was very tasty and I really loved the Zinfandel was one of the best I've ever tried. The service was fast and very friendly. They went out of their way to make our meal enjoyable. Would definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"There was a lot to like about S&P after my visit back in early September. The cocktails Gin City ($12) and Handsome Dan ($12) were great. The former being less sweet than the latter. The date and bleu cheese jam ($12) is a must-order. Part savory, part sweet, but all delicious, the jam is topped with bleu cheese and almonds and comes with bacon ciabatta to spread it on. The whole smoked romanesco ($12) is a beautiful dish that is equally bold in flavor with capers, red onions, and golden raisins surrounding the alien-looking broccoli. Another dish I enjoyed was the snail Wellington ($14). The meaty nuggets of snail covered in mushrooms and pastry were rich in garlic. The venison tartare ($18) was a nice riff on a classic with hints of tartness from a cherry mostrada. For dessert, the Fruit Loop panna cotta ($8) was so good we should have gotten two.

On the other hand, there were some missteps, too. The crispy oysters ($18) were bad. There was a strong fishy aftertaste that no one at our table enjoyed. The sauce in the tongue and cheek agnolotti ($22) was too rich and overpowering. A few drizzles of that red wine demi glace and peppercorn sauce over the pasta would have been enough. But, to have the pasta swimming in a soup of it was not good. The spicy shrimp ($20) was ok. There was nothing really wrong with it, although some might prefer a curry with more spice, but it was a decent enough dish. Finally, there was the wine and cheese sundae ($8). This thing should have never left the kitchen. The blondie that formed the base of the dish was hard as a rock, requiring a fork and spoon to slowly chip away at it. After complaining to the server about the oysters, I didn't feel like complaining again.

There's no doubt this restaurant has the potential to be great. The passion behind this project already sets it apart from just about everything else in Henderson. With some time and adjustments Standard & Pour can be special."}
{"text":"Ridiculously overpriced. Dropped by before a show and ended up paying ~$50 for two tiny appetizers and a drink. Spinach dip came with 4 small pieces of bread and the waitress said it'd be $2 more for an extra two pieces. Not worth the price."}
{"text":"The restaurant used to be Firefly. It's located on the upper floor with panoramic view of the Las Vegas Strip, and feature indoor and outdoor seating, bar and open kitchen.

Servings are tapas style but a little bit larger than traditional tapas. They have a decent wine menu and good cocktails.

It is so nice to know happy hour is offered every day from 4 pm - 7 pm. The HH is only available in the lounge area. All the food on it starts at five dollars. There's Mac n' Cheese, Calamari, Seafood Ceviche, King Crab Fondue, Meatball Sliders, S&P Fries and many more. We also ordered several items of the menu. Some of the items we had were Snail Wellington, Tuna Tartare, Seafood Ceviche, King Crab Fondue, Crispy Oysters and Meatball Sliders.

The presentation were pretty and the prices were very reasonable and the quality were outstanding."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here for date night on a Friday--I would recommend making a reservation. Really glad we decided to try this place--it was delicious! We started with the salt and pepper fries, which sound plain but were delish! Then we had the calamari, which was flash fried and tossed in pesto--prob some of the best calamari I've had! Next we had the steak tacos with Asian pear slaw; they were good but the calamari was my fav. We ended our meal with the lost bread and o. m. g! This dessert was amazing! Cinnamon bread with a syrup drizzle and candies pecans--yum! The server was very knowledgeable and helpful. We will definitely be back, and we would come back more frequently if it wasn't a little pricey. I'll have to check out their happy hour specials!"}
{"text":"A friend and I did a mommy brunch (no kids allowed) and it was definitely rewarding! We decided to do the \"Sunday Funday\" which meant we could do bottomless bloody Mary's, mimosas, and PBR, and go back and forth if we choose to...best decision of the day! Preston was our server, he is great and switched out our glassware when we wanted to switch it up! The chefs came and checked on us, very personal, and made us feel like at home. We shared the ricotta toast, yogurt &granola, breakfast sandwich, and also decided to take good home it was so good! I live In Summerlin and this place is well worth the drive...even in the rain!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing! Portions were small but the atmosphere was great. I would consider this a 3$ to me so keep all that in mind. I would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service (Ask for Shannon). Great view. The happy hour is as good as it gets. You need to try this place."}
{"text":"Loved our first time going to this place. I took my girlfriend Katrina out for Mother's Day brunch and truly enjoyed our time there. Rico, the server was excellent and very accommodating. He general manager was also very pleasant and sat us. She explained to us the menu and what's the restaurant is all about. Amazing food and can't wait to try lunch, dinner, and happy hour. We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This review is for S&P's Sunday Brunch. This is my #1 favorite brunch so far! They offer bottomless mimosas ($14), but they give guests the entire champagne bottle with carafes of orange, pineapple, and cranberry juices. This is the only place I know of that actually gives customers the entire bottle of champagne! I'm always weary when restaurants have bottomless mimosas with mostly juice than champagne. My friend and I drank 2 bottles of champagne and that was well with $14 for each of us. I ordered the egg polenta and the flavor and presentation was great! My friend also liked his breakfast sandwich. I will definitely be here every Sunday!"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh this place was fabulous. We had the spinach dip and meatball appetizers. Best spinach dip I've ever had. Meatballs were the second best meatballs I've ever had. We also had the french fries that came with pesto aoli,...yum! Also order the Chateaubriand, it was fine.i didn't love it as much as I loved the other food.  The staff here is very attentive and friendly. We were here early so we  didn't  observe the view but I'm willing to bet it gets a killer ciew after sunset. Oh, I almost forgot we also ordered dessert. The lost bread!! We're actually still eating it as I type this...yummmm"}
{"text":"We have been wanting to try this place for a long time.  We live near by but have not made it over until last night.  I also follow them on Instagram, and the food looked really good.  My wife and I decided to go for dinner.  

First of all, the first impression when you walk in is odd.  It just has a confusing layout and not a clear style/theme.  It is not clear what area is the bar and what area is the restaurant.  After getting seated, we order a couple drinks.  The wife had a glass of wine and I ordered one of their signature cocktails.  The cocktail was good but nothing special.  

We ordered a caesar salad, burrata cheese and tomato salad, the cod dish (which we saw on IG), and the stuffed shells.  The salads were very average, nothing special about them really. The stuffed shells were very good and tasty.  The cod was a disappointment.  First, the presentation was not like it was on IG.  The worst part was that it had way too much pepper on it.  You could literally see all the pepper.  Cod is a very mild fish, so the pepper way over powered the fish.  We ate it, but we should have sent it back.   For desert, we ordered the chocolate mouse.  It was more of a mouse cake and it should be listed as such.  The waitress was nice and attentive, but she did not explain the dishes to us in a super clear way when we asked her about them.  The manager, I think he was the manager, did come over and give us some information on some bourbons I had asked about.  They have a nice bourbon and whiskey from Montana that is called Whistling Andy, and it was tasty.  

All and all, this place seems to have potential.  I think they need to figure out what they want to be.  They need to maybe focus on producing good food and drink and not try so hard to be hip.  Also, they need to make it a little warmer and cozy feeling.  The furniture and decor is okay as it is trying to be modern, but it has somewhat of a stiff feel to it.  I think that it will do better in this area if they make it more comfy, with cushy chairs and more booths.  Also, they maybe should do something to break up the giant open room a little bit, and maybe separate the bar and the dining area is someway.  Just a thought."}
{"text":"Never gave a bad review but this place was not the best smallest portions ive ever seen for bar bites... i just wish they would step it up."}
{"text":"I was here a few days after Standard & Pour opened.  I joined two friends in returning to try items on the menu we didn't have the first time.

We ordered:

Crispy oysters
Endive and date salad
Date and bleu cheese jam spread
Spicy shrimp
Three beans
Mini burgers
Whole smoked romanesco
Meatball sliders
Kimchi tacos
Ribeye cap
Fruit loop panna cotta
Lost bread

The crispy oysters and the date and bleu cheese jam were repeats and just as good as the first time.  Some of the new items we tried that were amazing were the three beans, spicy shrimp, and whole smoked romanesco.  I had never seen a romanesco in a store but I was blown away by the great flavor with the red onions, capers, raisins, and herbs.  The smoking gives it a fantastic flavor.  The spicy shrimp lived up to their name and I could have eaten the entire serving myself.  Finally, the three beans with a house XO, fish sauce, and garlic.  The beans were crisp, spicy, and very tasty.

For dessert, the fruit loop panna cotta was not available the first go round.  This time it was and it's quite good and what a take on a cereal.  The lost bread--pain perdu--was better than the first time around.  The cinnamon flavor comes from being made from cinnamon rolls and the bread was moist throughout.

Standard & Pour has an extensive enough menu so there are choices for almost any type of eater.  For the more inquisitive, try the romanesco, the beans, and the date and bleu cheese jam spread.  You won't regret it."}
{"text":"What a great find..sorry it took this long to finally come here.  Small plates, great bold flavor combinations made it hard to choose what to share..and what to pull close  and guard with your life...definitely  will be back...Henderson finally has a quality place to come to!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty stoked that this area of Henderson is gaining quality restaurants worth a night out. 
S&P (love the clever name) also has a cool cocktail menu and a great \"lounge\" feel. 
Our bartender/server seemed to be in a grumpy mood, but overall the service was good.
We tried several things on the happy hour menu like mac & cheese, kim chi tacos, spicy coconut shrimp, and the bacon jam thingy. We enjoyed them all.
I really like the ambiance of the place - pretty hip and with an amazing upstairs patio. Great view from on top of the hill...seriously, why don't more places have upstairs patios???
Overall: I won't take the fam to S&P because the regular prices are kinda high, but I think it's great for date night to sit at the bar and get a couple things for happy hour. We'll be back."}
{"text":"The food was excellent! There was an issue with drinks, but the general manager did the right thing and took the drink off the bill.
This place has quickly become my favorite restaurant. Went twice in 1 week. Some favorites are kimchi tacos amazing and venison tartare.  But everything was delicious. Love the fact that if something comes with 3 you can add one for a few dollars.
Management knows that their business is primarily Anthem and Henderson clients and go out of their way to accommodate you so you comeback.
Great addition to the area!"}
{"text":"Visited: Saturday early evening at 5 pm

Service: 3.0/5.0  I was sitting outside with a group of friends getting together for some drinks.  Our server was friendly, but at the beginning we had to search for her to get our drinks. As the evening progressed and more patrons came in, we saw her more frequently.  I think they might be a little understaffed but everyone I came across was very friendly.

Food & Drink: 3.5/5.0 Ordered some meatballs and sliders from the Happy Hour Menu.  The food was good, no complaints at all.  The meatballs were on the smaller side.  The drinks were fine and the drinks offered for happy hour offered great value.  I stuck with the well vodka and had no issues.  

Value: 4.0/5.0 As I mentioned, I was here during happy hour so the pricing for the quality of food and drink was great.

Ambiance: 4.0/5.0 The view of the city is really nice and the setup of tables and lounge seating is nice.  When it gets busy, find a place to sit gets challenging as people like to stay for long periods of time to relax and drink.  

Summary: 3.5/5.0 I want to rate them at 4 stars but after 3 visits, I seem to run into the same challenge of having to find my my server for a drink if I'm not at the bar.  Mind you, I've only been here during happy hour so it might be a different experience during regular hours.  This is not going to stop me from coming back as I do live on this side of town but I know they can do better."}
{"text":"The server Nicole is a bad mama jama. She could serve me a whiskey near any day nadamean"}
{"text":"Service, food, THE VIEW, everything is spot on.   Wish this restaurant was in Bay Area!   EVERY dish I tried was incredible!   Love the super attentive staff and flavors in every dish!   Anthem has a winner!"}
{"text":"Love the location, views and decor. Great HH prices. The Date & Bleu Cheese Jam though... Not what I had hoped for as the first food I've had here...More than anything else it tasted like Sloppy Joe's, but not good homemade Sloppy Joes...More like Manwich out of a can..."}
{"text":"What a gem overlooking the Las Vegas valley. Standard and Pour was once Firefly way back and sits on the second story at the top of Eastern Avenue on towards the way to Anthem. 
On date night the husband suggested we try it and I'm so glad we did. Pleasantly surprised by the clean and modern interior, dark walls and green soft velvet booths juxtaposed black wooden chairs and tables, a sleek full bar sits over towards the kitchen, and not too far from an outdoor patio area. 
Promptly seated and our server Preston quickly attended to our cocktails needs, he also answered a couple questions about the menu, V for veggies, F for fish seafood, M for meat (chicken, beef, pork).  
Items ordered: 
Caesar salad (good), beet salad (amazing!!!!), chicken wings in a gorgeous, sticky garlic sauce (delicious!), spicy shrimp plate (so yum!!!), salt-n-pepper fries with 3 mouthwatering dipping sauces (yes please!!) , salmon filet on steamed kale (delicate and toothsome). We were stuffed so we didn't order dessert although looking briefly at the menu it appears there's some goodies on there. 
All in all our meal was awesome and I will definitely be returning. 
Service was excellent, our server Preston was friendly and attentive. The manager came over too to check on us and chatted for a minute, very nice guy. 
For date night or in a group setting, Standard and Pour is a great place in Henderson to grab some good quality chow. 
Total bill minus tip was $99. 
Look forward to returning again soon."}
{"text":"\"The service was Standard and the food was Poor.\"
That was our 11 year old son's quote and the rest of the family agreed.  We went for Mother's Day brunch. We called ahead and they were not excepting reservations but recommended we show up between 1:30 and 2. We were seated right away. Our waiter was very friendly but very busy. They ran out of 1/2 of the menu items. The food we ordered was over cooked, undercooked or way too salty. The price fits the area of town but the food quality did not. The best part of our experience was the decor. The manager did the right thing. She tried to make us happy by removing half of our meals from the bill. She also gave me her card and offered to buy my wife and I dinner at another time. She is the reason I gave 3 stars instead of one."}
{"text":"Went for Happy Hour, it was a Thursday night & nobody in sight. Sat at the bar which faces the opposite direction of the view, brilliant! Altogether it's a strange set up as you have to go up stairs or an elevator to get to it, this is in a strip mall mind you, so it's yea strange. We had the happy hour chardonnay, it's ok, didn't order food as there wasn't anything to tempting on the menu, so skipped that part. Now for the good part, drum roll please.........

All of a sudden the manager came over & asked us to move to the end of the bar wtf??!!! we are sitting at the friggin bar, there was a party who wanted to sit together at the bar so we needed to accommodate them... what did Elvis just come back from the dead and needed a place at the bar for him and his entourage? Rude and Ridiculous, thankfully we were just leaving and guess what? that's right folks we NEVER went back"}
{"text":"S&P is the place to be if you're down in Henderson and when you're not in henderson it's well worth the trip. Can't beat the view. I absolutely recommend the calamari, spicy shrimp, meatballs and the wine and cheese sundae is TOTAL MUST! Can't wait to try the new brunch menu! Oh and Nicole is probably the best server I have ever had, ever. So basically just get your behind down there."}
{"text":"My husband and I went there last week for dinner. I was not impressed whatsoever. We ordered the chose two items, it also comes with dessert and either a glass of wine or a beer, for $35, each. First of all, they wouldn't let one of us substitute our glass of wine for a soda. Really? \"Yes, really!\" Stated the mediocre waitress we had. The calamari was tasty, but over cooked. The Caesar salad was good, dressing was good, but nothing exciting. The Angus Steak strips came out on the cold side whereas the shrimp came out overly hot. The dessert was supposed to be an apple, pecan cake, but was more like bread pudding. 
At the end, I had to argue with our waitress about why she over charged us. I had to literally say her her, \"I need you to stop and listen to me for a second\" Only then, she stopped, looked and realized that she did, in fact, over charge me. 
I'm typically not one to complain, but when you pay as much as we did, for what should be a great experience, to be highly disappointed, I have to share what happened in hopes it doesn't happen again to someone else. We won't be returning anytime soon, and wold not make this place a recommendation to friends."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, spacious. Excellent food but way too pricey for what you get. We got five plates and three non alcoholic drinks and it was $100 including tip. 

Our server was not particularly authentic or sincere, I would say not personable, and she kept reorganizing our table top, which made me crazy. 

They need to stop selling pre bottled drinks for a huge mark up and have a happy hour."}
{"text":"Just went there for drinks and appetizers! Truly unimpressed! The food was imaginative but not tasty! Had the Kimchi tacos, the calamari and mini burgers. Had five drinks and the bill was $130. Walked away hungry and didn't feel like the drinks measured up! Hank's at Green Valley Ranch - much better good  happy hour and better quality drinks!  The best thing about this place is the valet parking and very attentive staff! Need a better bartender. Don't waste your time or money!"}
{"text":"Happy hour is only in the bar area. Not knowing that, we were seated in the dining room and we did not receive happy hour prices. 3 people, 3 plates and one drink each for a total bill of $86. NO WAY worth it!!! We left hungry. Will NEVER go back. BTW where is the \"view\"?"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service....  loved the mac n cheese, Currie shrimp date and blue cheese jam with bread all excellent as was the calamari and steak,   My favorite desert?  Definitely the saffron rice pudding..... most excellent..."}
{"text":"Stunning view, top notch customer service and fantastic food and drink selections. Our group of seven enjoyed every plate, even the pickiest eaters among us. Dessert selection was superb my favorite being the panna cotta."}
{"text":"Holy moly. Service and food were amazing!



Hey person reading this - 

If Manny is your waiter, you're in good hands. Here's my recommendations: the snail, the tartare, and the Mac n cheese.

That's all I had but bomb."}
{"text":"I'm sooo sad. What happened to S&P? Used to be our fav happy hour spot. Bummer that it's closed!"}
{"text":"Food - Appetizers were very good!  We ordered the beef tartare, artichoke dip, and calamari - all were fantastic.  Entrees were solid - we had a variety of meals across the table.  My filet was perfect on the inside - medium rare - but just a tad bit charred on the outside.  Also, my side of Mac & Cheese was a little charred on the top, but still tasted amazing.  The rest of the meals and sides were all PERFECTLY prepared and tasty.  

Location - The interior is very modern and clean.  They really did a great job with the space!  The views are very nice too!  The exterior leaves a bit to be desired.  Our Uber driver was lost trying to find the entrance.  When you walk up to the building, you need to go upstairs - wayfaring signage is an issue and we mistakenly walked into the pub/casino downstairs.  

Staff - The staff were all very friendly and attentive - the cooks even smiled and waved as we all walked in!  The server, Nicole, was fantastic.  Drinks were a little slow to come out, but we had a bigger group, so that was totally understandable.  The busboy was a little grabby - reaching across guests' plates to grab dirty glasses and dishes, or to refill waters.  

Drinks - Everyone who ordered a cocktail was impressed - they have some REALLY GREAT cocktails!  The wine and beer selection was solid and tasty!"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times for Happy Hour and really like the food so we decided to try the Sunday Brunch.

They have a small but decent selection of food to choose from along with bottomless brunch drinks.  For the Bloody Mary's they have a Buffett style of condiments for your Bloody Mary which is pretty cool, they bring you the drink and you go get whatever you want to dress it up.

Our server, I give him a rating of Fair performance at best.  I asked for a Bloody Maria, (tequila instead of vodka), I made it VERY CLEAR I do not drink Vodka and would like a Bloody Maria with tequila, you think he listened???  Nope I was served a regular Bloody Mary made with Vodka???

They brought some what they say are complimentary from the chef mini muffins, of course they had cinnamon (why not after all), unfortunately I can't have cinnamon.  Then I was told they cannot make French Toast without cinnamon, so I had to order something else.  I got the chicken & waffles which were better then other places I've tried but were just ok.  The seasoning used was bland and the chicken very dry.  The waffles were not bad, they had jalapeños in them but were not spicy at all.  My wife had the eggs & polenta, she was not impressed, again it was ok at best.

Back to the Bloody Mary, for some reason my wife did not like hers and did not drink it at all.  The manager I believe he was came by just to say hi and see how things were going?  My wife told him she did not like the drink and could not drink it.  His response?  I'm sorry, I guess I'll have to drink it.  I hope he enjoyed the $20 drink we paid for because they never took it off our bill and never offered her something else.

They try hard and the food is not bad however, it's not about the customer here but the bottom dollar (it appears).  Most places would have removed that drink from our bill immediately, however instead they charged us the bottomless price for the drink $20 instead of just one drink by the glass???  Even that would have been acceptable.

We were not impressed with the brunch and probably will not go back for it again.  Happy Hour is a maybe at best, but I tend to shy away from places that don't take allergies seriously."}
{"text":"Amazing Brunch!!!!!!  The people of Henderson must support this amazing restaurant.  The food is original and beautifully prepared.  Go, run, fast!"}
{"text":"Some friends and I came here Thursday around 6 pm to catch their happy hour. The place was pretty dead which kinda surprised me, but hey at least there was plenty of open seats. It's located on the second floor with a great view of the city and has a nice, classy vibe to it.

As far as food goes I had the green Caesar salad along with the deviled eggs. I really loved the salad, a great balance of dressing vs toppings and a very crisp, fresh taste. I thought the deviled eggs were very good as well. They were definitely not your traditional style, topped with roe and a teriyaki type sauce. 

Can't forget the red sangria either! So good! I would definitely come back here again!"}
{"text":"We had four in our group which is great because we wanted to try so much! We had Mac and cheese, steak,mini burgers, calamari, fries, crab dip, and spicy shrimp. Loved it all. The only negatives would be the fries are nothing special and under cooked and they need to serve more bread with the crab dip. Service was great and food came out spaced good. We will be back. We want to try the brunch."}
{"text":"We went there this past Tuesday,, our first time,  for happy hour and some Tapas.
Sat at the bar and enjoyed three each. Food was hit and miss...Drinks were excellent and 
our service from the bartender was great. Very pleasant. 
My only negative comment was that their martini glasses are small....about have the size of
Hank's at GVR.   Don't know if  we will return...maybe but not sure....

{"text":"Went here for brunch with a few friends in early February 2017 after hearing alot about it.  When we were seated in a table in the dining room we immediately felt a slight vibration.  Almost like a large idoling truck was parked directly below us.  We tried to ignore this for a few minutes but could not.  We were moved to a booth which was a lot better.  Later in the meal I was told that a certain air machine in the kitchen was responsible for making the floor shake the way it did.  Unless this machine was delivered today or yesterday I am still having a tough time understanding how this vibration was not fixed IMMEDIATELY.  It is very very distracting and annoying.

 Moving on... the food was very good.  Beer and whiskey pancakes, jalapeno chicken fingers with waffles, steak and eggs.. make your own bottomless bloody mary bar.  Brief review i know, but i would go back.  5 stars if not for the vibrating floor."}
{"text":"Excellent happy hour. Drink specials are fantastic. Service was great! 
Sadly, the food was average. The breads tasted as if basted with lard. Yuck! It saved me from wanting to eat them. The hamburger sliders would have been perfect except the bread. The macaroni and cheese was tasty but missed the remarkable unique zing. The shrimp were tasty but not as expected. The gig jam had a basic concept but also tasted lardy. 
As a connoisseur of Kerri Simon's cooking, I was a bit disappointed in the execution of dishes. I wouldn't mind hanging out with friends for happy hour, but dinner is a no go for me."}
{"text":"Fantastic new addition to Las Vegas.  It's a little far from the strip but any local will tell you there is more to Vegas than that.

The happy hour was pretty fantastic.  Great prices but only at the bar.

The least favorite things:
Snail Wellington just wasn't that good.
Sliders weren't that special.
Merlot ice cream - it was interesting but really not my thing

Really good:
Carrot risotto.  Yum!  
Charred beans.. delicious!  I swear I am not a vegetarian.
Kimchi tacos:  Pretty good.. not too much kimchi so it works for less adventurous peeps

Okay:
Green Caesar Salad - Standard salad but the best part was the anchovies
Date and bacon bleu cheese jam - I don't really like things that are that sweet.  The other people in my party really liked it."}
{"text":"My friend got married and held her reception here the food is great! The staff is wonderful! Drinks are well thought out and everyone had a great time!"}
{"text":"We decided to come here for the first time to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary. With a 15 month old, getting out just the two of us isn't always easy. Absolutely everything we ate/drank was exquisite, and the staff as as friendly as can be. We were treated like old friends by everyone making us feel very welcome. The team also made great suggestions!  

We plan to come back as often as we can and to recommend this great place to all our family and friends."}
{"text":"My Husband and I came here for our Anniversary and absolutely loved EVERYTHING! Our server, Manny, was really wonderful, attentive and informative. We had a few different dishes and it was all excellent! I am in the food business and it takes a lot to impress me. I love all food but to REALLY LOVE it, very rare.

Drinks:  I Believe (very strong) and Raspberry Beret (I expected a lot of sweetness like lots of Vegas drinks and I was pleasantly surprised and how perfect it was.

V:  Salt & Pepper Fries, Garden Tomato and Mac & Cheese. All were yummy but that Mac & Cheese. WOW!! That was my favorite.

F:  Black Bass - really good flavor, like bass always has, but has to be cooked right and they did it right.

M:  Date & Bleu Cheese Jam and Ribeye Cap. Both a MUST have! That Date & Bleu Cheese Jam was husband's favorite of the night.

Dessert:  Lost Bread - Absolute decadence. Very large portion so we had to take it home. 

Will be back to check out other items!!"}
{"text":"Restaurant management please read updated comment below my original comment....

The food itself was excellent, hands down. I'm not one to ever be bothered about paying top dollar for good food, but the food here is very overpriced. Our group usually ends up paying a couple hundred bucks when we go have dinner and drinks, but we didn't think the couple hundred bucks we paid here was a fair price. So as good as it was, we won't be going back. There's also the fact that they force you to valet park if you want to park at all, which to me was a little ridiculous considering how small the parking lot is. 

Update in response to restaurant comment:

Thanks so much for letting me know about Happy Hour- we can definitely try it, and if the prices are more reasonable for what you get, I'll definitely change my rating. Regarding the valet parking, I notice that you indicate it's complimentary. Well, most valet parking is \"complimentary\" in Vegas, but most people are compelled to tip the valets, because that's what you do. So it really isn't free, because most Vegas locals know to tip. It's nice that you have valet available, but rather than eliminating all of the closer spots by reserving those for valet, why not reserve spots in the farther areas? Then i think that your patrons would find that more believable and helpful- I've read your reviews, and the complaint about your valet is recurrent. Maybe you've changed it since I've been there, though."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time last night.  The staff was incredibly friendly and welcoming.  We tried several different items and shared everything.  The food was amazing!   The flavor and crispness of the wings was delicious, the fig and bleu jam was very flavorful.  Also tried the kimchi tacos and I highly recommend those too along with the salt & pepper fries...all three dipping sauces were great!   Don't forget to try the cocktails too!   Dessert was Lost Bread and if you like cinnamon you'll love it!   Highly recommend trying this place out.  It's a bit far of a drive but the view of the strip is great!"}
{"text":"We came last Sunday because I knew they had unlimited mimosas and bloody marys. The unlimited I believe was $25 dollars which was a great price. The environment is very nice with a beautiful view. We had great service and wait staff. I was a little disappointed that on Sunday's the menu is very limited. I will come again to try their dinner and I hear their happy hour is great. The quality of the champagne was great, two of us had four bottles and I felt great afterwards and they give you the choice of mixers, Oj, cranberry juice, and pineapple juice.

We had the whiskey beer and pancakes which I thought would be unique but it was average. The serving size was plentiful for two people to share. We were given complimentary zucchini muffins which tasted amazing. Their bloody mary bar had more than anything you could ever imagine you wanted and was very well thought of. (I am not a bloody mary fan but I may consider it in the future because of the wide selection of add ins). I also had the steak and eggs (i apologize if the name is incorrect.) I ordered the steak medium rare however, it was a little more towards medium-well. I did not complain, so that might have been my own problem. It was very tasty and flavorful. The staff is great and all of them were very attentive even if that was not their area.  We had other friends join us after and multiple servers and the hosts offered to move us when our friends had arrived. We sat outside afterward and the chairs were very comfortable and we ordered more food. Prices, food and service were great. I am looking forward to their happy hour and dinner."}
{"text":"This place is lovely! When I visit my in laws jn Henderson, my husband and I like to eat and have a drink nearby. This location has had at least one other restaurant, and I really think S&P is here to stay! The service was excellent, all of the food was delicious, and the drinks are fantastic. My favorite is the Rye Me a River. Can't wait to have another."}
{"text":"Really really good. We split the chopped salad, burger, and cod. All was delish especially the cod. We tried the wine and cheese dessert, little too much for our palates but kudos for the creativity.
Brooke out server was fantastic.
We will be back"}
{"text":"I have been to this restaurant 3 times, and each time, the service is wonderful, and so is the food. I've tried just about everything on the menu, the calamari is perfectly cooked, and tart. Our steaks were perfectly cooked at medium rare. The only reason I am not giving a 5 is that some dishes are different depending on the cook. Not most, but very specific ones. 

I will return, especially to try the brunch!"}
{"text":"We came here two times and have had the same opinion--the food is not worth the money (especially for an off the strip tapa-style restaurant).

Food issues: 

*First experience: the fry dish was inedible (the fries were drenched in lemon...even though they were supposed to be salt and pepper fries).

*Second experience: we ordered the crab fondue (14 dollar plate) and it was served to us cold.   Our wine pours also weren't even a full glass of wine.

So....why the valet ?  It just makes the experience ridiculous and irritating.  This place does not need a valet.  

Other than those issues, the atmosphere is okay and the wait staff did a good job."}
{"text":"The bartender is super nice.

 We probably won't stay long because it doesn't feel like the air is on."}
{"text":"Cool spot tucked away in Henderson. Good food and drinks, relaxed atmosphere. Great for date night or small social dinner."}
{"text":"From the mind that created Carson Kitchen comes Standard & Pour.  A fitting, final tribute the legacy of the late chef Kerry Simon.  Very good and IMHO clearly defines the culinary style of Vegas cuisine.

Similar but not the same.  There are enough differences between this and its sister restaurant to make both destination worthy.  In general solid, fresh ingredients treated to tease their natural flavors with some combinations making you cringe (white chocolate and raw venison).  Surprisingly, most of it works.

Tip:  Order many dishes and share.

Top props to the Venison Tartare.  Very well chilled, creamy from the raw quail egg, naturally pairs with the cherry mostrada and surprisingly with white chocolate.  The hint of coco butter punches up the mineral, gamey flavor of the venison.  Spoon some on a crostini, oh heck, just shovel it in your mouth.  Very good.

Excellent mac and cheese.  Cheesy in all the right ways.  Fontina and harvati provide the mild cheesy flavor, cheddar, the finish, port wine, the perfect nuttiness.  More cheese?  The snow crab fondue with artichoke hearts, spinach, and parm, all mixed together and warmed to a gooey spread, great on charred baguettes.  

A little healthier, the whole smoked romanesco (Roman cauliflower).  The gentle sweet bitterness of roasted cauliflower and the green vegetal flavor of broccoli blend perfectly with the briny capers, sweet rasins, and red onions.  Cut it up, make a mess and enjoy.  Good eats.

While correct, not everything wows.  The kimchi taco with grilled, soy marinated flank steak topped with asian pear slaw and kimchi on a charred scallion pancake lacks vibrancy.  Perhaps more acidity.  The snail wellington (escargot with prosciutto, mushroom duxelle, parm, in puff pastry on a garlic cream sauce) a tasty but not memorable bite.  The wine poached flavor of the escargot is lost amidst too many flavors and excessive pastry wrapping.  Finally the spicy shrimp, OK but the flavors are muddy and the sweetness of the shrimp is lost in the sambal red curry.

Great off Strip service.  Friendly and relatively efficient.

Nice cocktail program.  Reasonable off Strip pricing.

All told, well done."}
{"text":"Hello and welcome to Standard & Pour. We decided to take part of the Valentines Prix Fix menu and try Standard & Pour for the first time. Parking is tight here so I am glad we brought the smaller car. The restaurant is located upstairs above another bar and is quite quaint. There is a lounge to the left as you enter and the bar is toward the back adjacent to the kitchen. There was not a big hostess table so you enter right into the restaurant seating area. The seating is set up well and there is a large table for a big party in the center made from what appears to be a pine tree. 

We made reservations, and were seated immediately. We were placed in back in a small dining area that at first was quite chilly. Josie had to wear a jacket for dinner at first. It did warm up a bit as the meal went on.  We ordered drinks, Free wine or Beer with Yelp app.  Josie ordered a wine Pinot Noir and I ordered a Stella Rosa beer. The drinks were brought out in an adequate amount of time and the menu was explained to us. It was explained wrong on how to order so we asked for menus again to be able to get order in correctly. 

For first course we had off the Prix Fix menu the Calamarii. added a beat salad as extra off menu item. I am not normally a beet person, this salad was good it had nuts and Feta cheese and a beet puree. All the ingredients taken in a single bite made for great flavor. I like that the beets were chilled and not warm and mushy. The Calamari in Pesto sauce with pepercini's fresno chilis. The Calamari was a bit salty so I would have liked some more of the Chili's heat to offset the bitter of the salt. 

Second course, Baked Rigatoni Bolognese, bechamel, crispy basil. We ordered this to share as we did not want to get too full if our main course was also filling. Dish came in a small pot with melted Bechemel and cheese over rigatoni and a meat sauce. This was really good melt in your mouth. Had a nice spice from the Italian Sausage. Was not too filling and just the right size for us. 

Third course. This is were they earn their three stars. By now my beer is getting low and my water nearly empty and they have not been refilled. Josie ordered the True North Salmon on Creamy kale. I ordered NY Strip Oscar Style crab hollandaise, asparagus. My drink is still not refreshed yet....not happy. Josie's Salmon arrives. Crispy skin side up, Perfectly cooked and pulls apart flaking nicely. Skin is perfectly crisp. 

So you're probably wondering how was the steak. So was I. No explanation justt sat her food down and walked away. five minutes later I was told it would be a few more minutes on the steak. I asked if it was normal practice to bring out the food separate, as some restaurants are want to do due to plating style. They said that is not normal. I requested mid rare which should take less time than a crispy skin Salmon. At nine minutes my food finally arrived. As a good gesture they offered to refresh my Beer on the house. (finally a drink refreshed) and since my water glass was empty they filled it also. So I cut into the steak and it's Under. Not Blue mind you but under to being rare. I little cold toward the middle. They offered to refire it, but since my wife was already done eating, I accepted the rare offering. The sauce and asparagus were done nicely. Asparagus not overly cooked and a crisp bite still to it. Flavor on the steak was fine but I believe if properly cooked it would have been better. 

The pass looked quite busy and even a bit in the weeds when I passed by there. Even a few other people were complaining about the timing of the meal. Our waitress Christine did a fine job, however was not attentive to the beverages at our table. She made a comment about new staff in kitchen, but I did not follow it further.

Final Course, Desert. The Prix Fix meal came with a Chocolate Mouse with Rasberry Coulis. We ordered off menu for the Fruit loop Panna Cota. with orange sorbet and rasberry gummi, hazelnut. I am at this point probably being overly critical at this point, after my steak incident. In my experience Mouse is silky and smooth this was somewhat hard and clunky and the Panna Cota while flavorful seemed more like a pudding than a set Panna Cota. Neither deserts met my expectations.

Thank you for dining at Standard & Poor. Overall the meal was good. We will try it again someday, perhaps for their brunch. It was a special occasion so maybe they were not prepared for the abundance of guests. However it being a Simon Group restaurant my expectations were high. I recommend you try it. Don't let the few things I experienced keep you from a good meal."}
{"text":"Went here for happy hour, small plates, very trendy. Happy hour requires you to sit at the bar or in the lounge at the small couches and circular tables; it was a little awkward but ok. Service was pretty great, food came out fast also.
We had the date jam with blue cheese and it was dynamite. The korean kimchi tacos were great, and the spicy shrimp dish had a lot of flavor. For dessert we had the lost bread. It was super heavy and only had one flavor note in my opinion (it was a little hyped up by the server) and left me a little disappointed. Overall though the food was good and so was the service, decent modern tapas. Final score : 3.5/5"}
{"text":"Awesome service and great happy hour. Staff was very engaging. Recommended for great date spot or just causal dining and drinks!"}
{"text":"They added brunch!!!  Warm,Zucchini muffins hit the table as you order, compliments of the restaurant. Lots of unique options, cornbread muffins with red eye gravy, egg white frittata, Real Big Muffin; its 2#!  Then bottomless bloody Mary's, mimosas, and PBR for 20$. That's a great bargain for this side of town. Can't wait to come back next Sunday!!!!"}
{"text":"When Cory Harwell and Simon Hospitality first suggested that they'd be taking over the old Firefly Space in Henderson the optimist said \"Awesome, look what they did with an derelict building in DTLV,\" while the skeptic thought \"...but its Henderson,\" and revisiting the restaurant nearly eight months since opening it turns out that the result lies somewhere in between, the menu from Cory and Chef John Courtney still undoubtedly the best in miles though the days of Venison , Kimchi Tacos and Devil's on Horseback Jam are long in the past.

Continuously a challenging area for restaurateurs outside the brunch sector, nearby CRAFTkitchen still doing great daytime business and now venturing into a Friday Happy Hour whose fate will be decided by the people of Henderson, Standard & Pour in its current format sees the brains behind Carson Kitchen slinging modern Steakhouse in a way comparable to Andiron in Downtown Summerlin or Tivoli's Echo & Rig, the beautiful dining room with a big lounge still headed up by Ed Tracy and a team that is friendly, professional and efficient.

Acknowledging that Sin City does not lack for Steakhouse fare, but also bearing in mind the fact that so many locals are unwilling to visit or cross The Strip, dinner at Standard & Pour is still best started by one of the restaurant's signature cocktails, both the Southern Belle and Pretty Ricky Spirit-forward and balanced with the former one of those deceptive sorts that goes down easy and could lead lightweights ordering more than one into trouble quick.

Now featuring a creative menu of Bar Bites at a great bargain, the $5 Deviled Eggs with Flying Fish Roe and a zap of Sriracha offered as a quartet that won't be found anywhere near Las Vegas Boulevard for less than a Hamilton, a look at four lighter plates offered as Starters included roasted and grilled Beets served cold with a tinge of Mustard and whipped Mascarpone Cream while the Tomato & Burrata left two mid-Westerners who are still in the throes of chilly weather envious of the sort of produce those closer to California take for granted, the Spicy Shrimp in Red Curry still one of the best items offered on S&P's Menu thanks to the warm heat and pump Crustaceans though the Steak Tartare is also well suited for most palates as the finely chopped Beef is brightened by chopped Onions and a good spice blend plus crispy Shallots and lightly applied Capers.

Having frequently said that a kitchen can be gauged by the quality of its Chicken, a 'boring' dish to some that speaks volumes about how much the kitchen actually cares when it is made memorable, those looking for a good roast Bird on this side of the Strip are well advised to check out Cortney and Harwell's Breast, Thigh and Wing served with crisp Skin atop Black Rice Pilaf in savory Chicken Jus while the simple bone-in Pork Chop is also perfectly prepared and cooked through while still remaining juicy despite its thickness, the extra-thick Burger cooked medium-rare honestly better than Carson Kitchen's \"Butter Burger\" thanks to the Caramelized Onions tucked under Cheddar on a light bun with the faint aromatics of Mustard.

Offering good Fries that act as a crispy delivery mechanism for Smoked Ketchup and long spears of Broccolini that are grilled with just a bit of acid and heat, one would be hard-pressed to name anywhere in Las Vegas offering the deal provided by Standard & Pour's $32 Chateaubriand that rings in at 18oz with great tenderness and a sidecar of housemade Steak Sauce, those looking for lighter fare perhaps better suited to a big bowl of Tomato Soup made creamy with Mascarpone or the Italian Chopped Salad with Salami that is served both sliced and fried - a great one-two punch with the scalding-hot casserole of Stuffed Shells with a golden Cheese Crust overlying sautéed Spinach, Spices and whipped Ricotta.

Celebrating one guest's birthday with a Carrot Cake provided by CRAFTkitchen, but certainly not one to shy away from Standard & Pour's own sweet creations including Chef Harwell's Wine & Cheese Sundae that remains as good as or better than any Ice Cream-based creation offered in any of the major Casinos, Chef Courtney's \"Strawberry Short Shake\" riffs on the summertime classic by way of a stick-a-straw-up-straight Milkshake spiked with Strawberry Liqueur and the center of Brunch's \"Real Big Muffin\" while the 'Lost Bread' is still a sharable crowd-pleaser with the Custard-soaked Cinnamon Roll both topped and filled with Maple Icing and Candied Pecans adding a bit of texture.

Still the Best choice for dinner in Henderson by a significant degree."}
{"text":"Service was very good, decor nice and place well appointed. Great view of the strip. Nice lounge area. We had no trouble with parking at all plenty of spots. My wife and I were here on a Friday night around 7pm. No crowd at all, were seated right away. 

All that being said, the food was alright. The tartare wasn't that good. It was there take on traditional steak tartare and it missed the mark. The mac and cheese was just as it would be at any of these types of small plate tapas style places it was good but nothing out of the ordinary. The French fries were awesome. The two dipping sauces were delicious; spicy ketchup and basil mayo. The artichoke dip was great. Everything was fixed up and it was gooey and incredible. I hate the watery artichoke dips with huge chunks of artichoke in them. This one was much different and I loved how they did it here. 

So, 3 stars because the place was good. Service was good, food was pretty good."}
{"text":"the spicy shrimp and the listen linda cocktail saved my life. very unique menu. 
nicole is an amazing and attentive server who was very knowledgeable about the menu. 
loved the vibes and the ambiance! another great kerry simon restaurant. 
finally something hip and cool in henderson!"}
{"text":"Great place!!!  This has been a steak house, a tapas place and now a really cool and slightly edgy restaurant and bar in walking distance from home...the food was great, the view is amazing and the people were very friendly!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, drink and atmosphere. We had a great time. Must try the Tuna Tartare, Meatballs and Banana Bread Pudding!"}
{"text":"Came here for the first time on Valentine's Day. We had the salt and pepper fries as an appetizer. Loved the three dipping sauces they came with. My husband had the sliders and calamari for his meal and loved them both. I started out with the beet salad which was the best beet salad I've ever had. Followed that with the carrot risotto which was very good and so unique. We had the fruit loop panacotta for dessert which was also delicious. 
Our server was excellent as well, I just wish I could remember his name. I can't wait to come back and try the Bloody Mary bar and Sunday brunch. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on a Friday night around 6p. The lounge appeared to be busy with a lot of people in scrubs (all the single ladies?!). And the restaurant appeared \"busy\" enough that the staff wasn't just hanging out in the back.

If you've been to the old firefly, this is in its space. I loved the dark decor with florals on the wall, with a second story view of the strip. 

The food was OK. We ordered a few different things to share to kind of get a taste of their menu. We got the spinach and artichoke dip, which my husband liked because it was chunky and not like the kind you'd get at Cheesecake Factory. It seemed like it was fresh products, although it lacked taste. They also had a beef tartar, it was like room temp. Ew. And again, lacked taste. The fries...my husband raved about, it wasn't anything special. The Cesar salad was also ok, but again, it lacked. I was expecting something spectacular based on reviews--but honestly, I don't think I would come back to eat here. My husband and I are considering doing our baby shower here, not for food, but more for ambiance and location."}
{"text":"Omg, this place is amazing! Staff is very knowledgeable and open to explaining menu items. Oscar was our bartender, and he was absolutely perfect. The food was phenomenal, and our drinks were flawless! We will be regulars here...great place, try it. Just don't take our table when you do.."}
{"text":"This is place is so great!!! My friend & I have been going here for several weeks trying everything on the menu. Every dish has been on point! Service is fantastic too! The Assistant GM Chelsea Anderson is so nice and personable!"}
{"text":"The Real Housewives of Anthem were definitely in full force on a recent Saturday evening and who could blame them?  With the nice décor, cool bar and tasty cocktail list, coming in with blow out and a fresh manicure for a glass or 3 of \"Man Candy\" (actual name of cocktail, not from an actual cock) makes for a solid call.

I like the concept, but there were enough items that didn't shine.  It's a little unfair comparing this to Simon's Carson Kitchen, but with both being equidistant from home, the downtown counterpart is a clear notch above.  It wasn't like dinner was a total loss as there were a couple of quality items. 

Loved:

Whole Smoked Romanesco: It may look like something from outer space or a gremlin's head, but it was fantastic.  This love child of broccoli and cauliflower topped with the zesty capers, raisins and red onion made for an amazing vegetable dish. 

Date & Bleu Cheese Jam: The sweet and tart dates combined with buttered almond spread over delicious bacon bread tasted like a luxurious peanut butter and jelly sandwich that I could chow on all day long.  I enjoyed the subtlety of the bleu cheese which added a nice little twist to all the other flavors going on.  More bread was ordered to finish and it was the best thing we ate.

Didn't love:

Spicy Shrimp: $20 for 8 pieces of shrimp in a below average Thai curry.  The bread was a waste.  This doesn't belong on the menu.

Crispy Oysters:  I love raw oysters.  I even like deep fried oysters.  But breaded, fried and then served cold?  Absolutely not.  Sure, it looks pretty in pictures, but the texture and taste were not desirable.  We even debated whether to finish the last two on the plate, but the principle of paying and thinking about all those starving children in Africa cajoled us into seeing it through.  Give it to me raw.

Tongue & Cheek Agnolotti:  It was surprising just how much peppercorn sauce the relatively good pasta was drowning in and the rich-on-rich flavor did not jive with me.  Photos I saw online had much less.  What happened?  It could have been a stand out!

Snails Wellington: Bardot does it better.

Mandatory valet:  Bullshit.  Last I checked, this was Henderson and NOT West Hollywood.  I have to tip a kid to drive my car less than 50 yards away?  Fuck that.

2.723231309099 stars if you're sober and 3.0993246 stars after a couple of their cocktails."}
{"text":"The environment, view and location are great, but the food lacks flavor and although the menu was intended to be tapas, the dishes ultimately fall flat. My friend and I ordered the date & bleu cheese jam, meatball sliders, salt & pepper fries, snow crab fondue and roasted beet salad. The only memorable item was the snow crab fondue which was too salty. We ordered the saffron rice pudding for dessert and the rice was not cooked properly, plus the cinnamon was overpowering."}
{"text":"Great! 

Great food, ambiance, cocktails and service!

Oh, and try the merlot ice cream!"}
{"text":"another great restaurant yet again, miles away but totally worth it. i never really heard anything about this restaurant so I was excited to go in blindsided without any other opinions in mind. 
quick, cozy open floor plan restaurant with views of the kitchen. i love seeing all the action.
this restaurant offers great small plates to share amongst everyone at the table. if you have ever been to carsons kitchen downtown, it's the same chef in which he offers consistency through his dishes. my personal favorites included the carrot risotto, the ahi tuna & the rib cap! 
just as any new establishment comes some tweaks. service was good and attentive during the beginning all the way up to our order being placed. chef came around which always wins me over. however it rapidly declined. our server was no where in site when we needed something and no where to be found when all dishes were cleared from our table. it's as if he had no sense of awareness as the table looked aimlessly for him. there is room for improvement in the service area, which is really everywhere. but it's not enough to keep me away just yet."}
{"text":"I've been here twice since it opened because it already has become one of my favorite restaurants in Henderson. The service and food are both excellent. Atmosphere is warm and cozy with an incredible view of the city and they play good music too. I've had just about everything on the menu and it has all been stellar. Standard & Pour is exactly what the Anthem/Seven Hills area needed."}
{"text":"The best. 

We had the fries, calamari, carrot  risotto, snail wellington, spicy shrimp, tuna tar tar, kimchi tacos  and two desserts... EVERYTHING was the best I've ever had. Remarkable!!!! I'll be back...SOON!!!!

Pricing is fair for the food and drinks. Atmosphere is nice. Could use some music. Tonight was opening. So I am sure it will only get better. This place will be a hit!!!

Parking....they have valet set up. Smart move-in you know this parking lot spots can be hard to find. Well not any more."}
{"text":"My first visit here was a few months ago when S&P first opened.  It was girls' night out with my loves, Debbie N. and Sandy K.  We don't have a chance to get together at the same time very often with our varying schedules, so when we do, it's always quality time.  None of us had been here so it was a first for everyone. 

We shared:
Mac & Cheese:  cheddar, fontina, havarti, port wine
Whole Smoked Romanescu:  caper, red onion, golden raisin, fine herbs
Carrot Risotto: black truffle, artichoke heart, aged pecorino
Date & Bleu Cheese Jam:  buttered almond, bacon bread
Scallop Crudo:  ruby red grapefruit, avocado, bagna cauda
Spicy Shrimp:  red curry, sambal, coconut milk
Chicken Thighs:  pearl onion, mustard jus
Wine & Cheese Sundae:  cheesecake blondie, merlot ice cream, brandied cherry
Lost Bread: cinnamon roll, maple icing, toasted pecan

This is definitely a good choice when you have a group of people so you can try a variety of dishes as we did.  My favorites from that dinner were the risotto, the bleu cheese jam, mac & cheese, and the Lost Bread cinnamon roll.  The mac and cheese here is one of the best versions I've had in a long time, creamy not runny.  The bleu cheese jam with the bread is also fabulous and I think I ate half of this dish. 
Service was excellent throughout and there's a great view of the valley from the patio.  Bookmark S&P as a great destination to get social and share social plates with your favorite people."}
{"text":"My husband and I came in here for happy hour. We decided to sit at the bar. The Decor was very nice. There's a comfortable lounge side and the other side with tables. We we're glad that we sat at the bar.  the bartender Rico was very engaging knowledgeable and professional. 

We tried four of the happy hour menu items. My favorite of which I didn't think I would like was the kimchi tacos. Had the date Blue cheese jam which I highly recommend, the Mac & cheese pretty good and lastly the Greek Caesar salad.  that one wasn't my favorite so probably won't order it again. I just think I don't really care for the Greek goddess dressing that they add in but my husband liked it. 

We really enjoyed the craft cocktail making experience from our bartender and we definitely plan  to come back when they do their Sunday brunch."}
{"text":"Very nice atmosphere, meal and service.   All food we as very good,and might have considered 5 stars, except two of the dishest that looked the best, they were out of, at 8pm on Friday!  I can give them a little slack on this, as brand new.

We look forward to going back."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! My friends and I went here and ordered almost every item on the menu. From seafood to meats. The food is amazing as well as the views. We also had some of their cocktails as well. The staff are stylishly dressed and provided great guest service. I'd definitely come back to this place."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time today! My girlfriend has been hearing good things about this place. Obviously for a Sunday it was a packed house! Showed up with no reso and definitely waited 25 minutes. 

She had the steak and eggs.. good medium rare. 

I had deep fried polenta sous vide bacon and a poached egg I loved it def needs some hot sauce or acid in general.

We will definitely be back soon!!

Thank you!!"}
{"text":"I can't possibly express how delicious the food is at Standard & Pour. There is an outside area with a fire pit and couches, a lounge type area inside, bar, and seating area. I sat at the bar because I was starving and didn't want to wait for a table. The girls at the bar were so nice and super helpful. They explained the menu, how many dishes they recommend for each person, and their favorite drinks. The service was so great at the bar that it made me not want to leave!
For drinks, I ordered the Man Candy, which was absolutely incredible! It wasn't as sweet as you may think. It was so flavorful and came with a peach foam on top. It was such a unique and delicious drink. I HIGHLY recommend if you like peach/citrus flavor. 
Now on to the food! The plates are meant for sharing. There were three of us and we ordered 6 plates and dessert. It was the perfect amount of food. 
We ordered the Gravlax, Tuna Tartare, Mac & Cheese, Three Beans, Meatballs, Tongue & Cheek Agnolotti, and the Lost Bread for dessert!
Literally everything was incredible. Each dish was packed with flavor and I can't express enough how amazing it all was.
The Gravlax was balanced perfectly and the farm cheese was to die for. The Tuna Tartare was perfection, Mac & Cheese had a hint of wine flavor, the Three Beans was a spice explosion (in the best possible way), Meatballs were perfectly cooked, Tongue & Cheek was creamy goodness, and the Lost Bread (a cinnamon roll type bread pudding) was a freaking party in my mouth. 
This is the best place I have been to in forever. There is also a check-in offer where you get a free glass of wine or beer if you check-in on Yelp!
Do yourself a favor and go to Standard & Pour!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my most favourite restaurants in town. It's such a shame it's closed. We went here often. The shrimp was delicious!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this new restaurant a try and I'm so glad I did! Nicole took care of my group and gave amazing recommendations, if you go try the Gin City it's amazing! Overall I love the vibe of the place and the music was so chill. This place gives me a cool low key LA lounge feel. 5 stars."}
{"text":"We went for Valentine's Day! Perfect location! Had a great table for two next to the window!  Staff was even able to help with a special request! Great place! Food was fantastic!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this gastropub! The food is probably the best in Henderson. The staff remembers your name, and treats you like a friend. And for cocktails - what a great place to gather with friends!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that the staff was very friendly and sweet.....but everything else was bad! 
First we waited 10 min at host stand before we were even approached or acknowledged.  Then we were seated and waited over 10 min before i had to ask if we had a server.  Manager finally took our drink orders.  5 min later, waiter greets us asks for our drink order. No idea they were already taken.  Takes our order...15 min later no drinks.  Now here comes our food...no drinks.  Ask manager(different one) about our drinks finally get them.  Then my dates  food order was wrong!!
Send it back takes longer the 2nd around to get our replacement!! 
This place is very nice great view but there is absolutely no communication between the staff. Food was ok but not worth the frustration. Was looking forward to a nice Sunday brunch and got a frustrating afternoon."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch! $20 for bottomless bloodies and mimosas... ordered their chicken and waffles. Super tasty! Would recommend"}
{"text":"Standard & Pour is definitely not your \"standard\" bar/pub! 

This place has a really great feel and equally great food :) Located in an upstairs level in a strip mall right on Eastern, this place has an excellent view of the LV valley and nice big windows.  They have a nice balcony/outside bar area for those who are looking for that scene, plus a nice dimly lit restaurant. We came here as a party of 3 on a quiet Thurs night for dinner. Their menu is not extensive, but there is definitely something for everyone. I ordered the Spicy Shrimp & a side of Broccolini, and others in my party ordered the Roasted Chicken and the Icelandic Cod. The Shrimp came in a creamy spicy tomato-coconut sauce and 2 slices of bread. It was excellent with great flavor! The Broccolini was huge, and grilled just tender.  The Cod, however, was the highlight! A bit pricy at $22 for a small portion of fish, but it was cooked perfectly with flaky white meat and gentle flavors that made me have some order envy... haha!

Service was super friendly and the waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu. 

Overall, would definitely recommend this place if you're out in Henderson. It was above my expectations for sure!

My only complaint would be that the music is a touch too loud, and they like their techno-pop a little too much :P They could also use some flashlights to help read the menu since the mood lighting was dim."}
{"text":"I visited Standard & Pour a short while after they opened and was blown away by the excellent food and drink menu they have to offer.

We tried a number of dishes and all were creative and delicious. The desserts were especially intriguing. As someone who doesn't like overly sweet desserts, these were perfect for me. The play on wine & cheese and the saffron rice pudding were my two favorites. 

There were plenty more stars of the menu but every dish is a winner, so you can't go wrong. 

The restaurant is adorable and overlooks the strip from its perch above Henderson. Great place to enjoy some cocktails and have a nice evening out in the suburbs."}

{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for awhile and finally got to dine in on Mother's Day. It's a good thing we called since they were limited on walk ins. The hostess was really friendly and gave me a carnation for being a mom. I thought that was really sweet! The server was really informative, funny, and attentive! Blame it on the bottomless mimosas for forgetting his name, which in fact, are mixed in pineapple juice, cranberry juice, and orange juice. It was really yummy every way we tried it, since we kept mixing our juices. The food? AMAZING! They offer complimentary muffins during brunch and it had zucchini in it. OMG, it was so delicious! You're gonna have to actually go there and try it to take my word for it. We ordered the muffins & gravy and the Elvis French Toast. Both entrees were scrumptious but I thought the french toast had a little too much peanut butter. The muffins & gravy though? WOW! I loved everything about it and honestly, I didn't think I'd like it when we agreed to order it. The place? CUUUUUUUUUTE! My sister recommended I'd have my wedding there (LOL) since the interior decor was to our liking. Overall, I'd come back for more! Thank you Standard & Pour."}
