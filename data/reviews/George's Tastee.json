{"text":"Great Taste! best oxtail in the area, but is pricey, not so sure it's worth it, since the portions are kinda small for me."}
{"text":"This is the first time that I've been to any George's Tastee patties. We ordered 3 different patties wt coco buns and the jerk chicken. To be quite honest,  it wasn't fresh and tasteful. The patties are not very flavorful.  The jerk chicken came with rice and beans,  which the rice was cooked with way too much water. If you want really good authentic Jamaican/Caribbean food, definitely go to \"Jerk Chicken\" on Hwy 7."}
{"text":"I've eaten boxes and boxes and boxes of patties from George's. This location is way more convenient for me than the Denison location and the patties are on par. I like the spicy version and the chicken curry version but YMMV depending on what you like. The pastry is outstanding even after microwaving from frozen. 
The Goat Curry has been my lunch standby at the Denison location for years and it is equally good here but the takeout amount is significantly smaller than the dine in quantity at Denison. There is no dine in option here so it is what it is and convenience wins. The Goat Curry is not always available at this location and the Jerk Chicken is the fall back position. I'll be back."}
{"text":"For $1.50, a patty here is a pretty cheap snack.  
It's not bad tasting, but I have had better. The patty I got barely had any filling, and I got extra spicy but could not really taste it at all. 
If I lived nearby, I might come here once in awhile when hungry, but I wouldn't go out of my way for these patties or get them in bulk."}
{"text":"Goodness this place was a great fast find yesterday when I was taking meetings in the more under developed north east of Markham. I've had this spot bookmarked for quite some time but only realised yesterday where it was

It's not a huge retail spot with maybe only a few stools for dining in, but with the convenience of their food, and efforts made towards selling frozen bulk patties, they don't need much seating. 

The patties are available in chicken or beef and in varying levels of spice from regular to spicy to XTRA spicy (which isn't that hot tbh). In addition to the patties they also have a sizeable hot table with traditional west Indian/Jamaican eats like jerk chicken/pork, oxtail, rice and beans etc. 

Prices are beyond reasonable with two patties coming to less than $3. So cheap that to pay debit I had to buy a dessert and a large beverage just to get to their $5 minimum for debit. 

I'm sure the hot table eats are great, but the patties are where it's at really. Baked to a warm flakey finish on the outside and a hot flavourful centre. 

Great quick on the go option if you're near the Markham Fair grounds and looking for something other than Tim Horton's or Wendy's. Erryting be irie at Georges! 

Eatcrest out."}
{"text":"I always want to come here but they closes at 6 pm everyday and when I got there they are already closed.  So I made a apecial effort to get there this afternoon and it was worth it.  I got the regular spicy Patty with Coco-bread and it was the perfect spiciness and crispiness  The place itself was dead; we were the only people there and their was only 1 kid that was employed there.  He was just sitting there the whole time and it felt awkward as you can literally hear a pin drop.  They should def play some music or at least turn on the radio.  I been to the old location at the denison location and it is just as good here.  Good place for a quick snack, only if they close later as I don't get off work till 6 everyday.  The jerk chicken looked good as well and will be trying that next time for sure.  Patty cost $1.10, Patty cocobread $1.75.  They also have patty combo - 2 patties and pop for $2.75.  Jerk Chicken dinner is $6.99 and Jerk pork on cocbread - $3.75."}
{"text":"They are yummy... The spicy version is not very spicy. I pick up a box every now and then. Just heat them in the toaster."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. Solid Beef patty and jerk pork with rice and peas. Mutton is also good. Nothing amazing but definitely worth checking out. 

Cash or Debit only."}
{"text":"A convenient location in central Markham neighborhood.  Good to walk in and take out no seating for eating. Well spent for a cheap and quickie eater.  Specializing beef, veg patties and jerky meats.  
One star for service fast and adequate
one star for food quality
One star for price 
Lost one star ~ no seating or table for dine in
Lost one star ~ selective available items depends on what they have"}
{"text":"I agree - alot of those reviews left two years ago were accurate.  I dont know if its new ownership - but visited today and it sucks now.   The prices went up, the portions went down.  The jerk chicken was dry and i had to twist her arm to add more gravy which was thick as tar anyways.  The curry goat was OK.  But i wanted what they used to offer a jerk chicken/goat combo - they dont do that now if i wanted that i had to pay $16.95 for goat (ridiculous price for the small portion of meat & packed full container of rice). The patties didnt taste fresh, were dry and nothing special.  For $50 for 3 \"large\" meals which are standard round plastic  take out containers (used to be around $10 for a large foam tray filled & lots of gravy)    Pretty disappointed probably wont be back again."}
{"text":"I don't know what some of these people are talking about. Expecting too much from a small place. I got a bowl of the jerk pork meal and I thoroughly enjoyed it. This was also my second visit and it's exactly how it was the first time I got it. Delicious. They were very generous with the amount of pork. What more can you ask for? The gravy actually tastes decent and you can even ask for more or little gravy as you like. It's a filling meal for $10. What can I say"}
{"text":"I think this place is one of the freshest Carribean establishments I've been to.  I've had their jerk chicken and jerk pork.  Both have a decent kick to it, but not too spicy either.  

What I really like about this place is that the jerk chicken is separate from the gravy, so the chicken and/or pork never gets too soggy.  Prices are reasonable as well, anywhere between 6-9 dollars for a meal."}
{"text":"The best patties in town !! Love the spicy one yummm. Also love the ox tail dinner- generous size and very saucy and flavourful. Family run restaurant-very friendly. You can also pick up frozen patties for next time!"}
{"text":"How did I not know about this place!?!? The patties are the best I've had. I usually drive down to graces patty at 27 and Albion but never again. This will be my go to for patties. A dozen patties costs under $9. You can choose from beef-regular,spicy or extra spicy. There's also chicken and vegetable. There's also other west Indian dishes to choose from but I stick to the patties. They're closed on Sundays."}
{"text":"I've come here religiously over four years just for the patties. There's just something about them that tastes SO good. An inexpensive, flaky pastry that satisfies your patty craving - what more could you ask for? I've bought them fresh and I've bought them frozen, both taste amazing. If you've only ever had frozen store bought patties, you're missing out."}
{"text":"Good tasting patties. Good for snack. Easy to prepare. I usually buy boxes in frozen packaging. I have tried their jerk chicken meals and they taste good. No seats here so you need to order take out."}
{"text":"Love this place. Ever since I got back from Montego Bay last month have been frequenting this place once a week for their beef patties and jerk meats. It may not be the exact same thing in Jamaica but it comes very close!  They also have frozen beef patties in the dozens to bring home for the long run that are as fresh as the moment they're made!  The place smells and reminds me of Jamaica, another plus! Cash or debit only.

Go here for your Jamaican fix! Ya mon!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for a few weeks now that I work in the area, today the server helped me to a hot sauce that they have at the restaurant, made in house, and I am talking about no bull hot sauce. Man the jerk chicken is consistently great, patties are always fresh. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place came recommended by my friend, whose dad is Jamaican and makes curry goat and oxtails at home... 

We ordered take-out pretty early in the evening because they close soon after the office parks close for the day (6 or 7pm). He had the curry goat (which looked and smelled great but I didn't taste) and I had the oxtail. It came in brown gravy over white rice and peas. If you know oxtail, you know there isn't a whole lotta meat on the bone. That being said, my only real complaint is portion size. The meat-to-rice ratio could be better. Also, the sauce could've had a little more flavor. It was definitely good though. I'd go back. For the record, my friend enjoyed the curry goat. He said it wasn't as good as his father's, but then I wasn't surprised!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Tastee many times but only a few times at this location. I met some friends there for an early lunch but I guess we got there a little too early. Not all the cooked food was ready, just the jerk chicken and jerk pork. Two of us opted to wait for the oxtail and curry mutton, while our third friend chose the jerk pork. He was either very starved or it was very good because he attacked it! He said it was very good.

After a short wait, my friend got his oxtail and I got my curry mutton, both with rice and peas. They use pigeon peas instead of the more popular red kidney beans. I prefer this version. The flavour was good, consistent with previous visits and their other locations. All the portions were very generous!

Service-wise, it's cafeteria style. You order, pick up, and pay at the counter and then find a table. The staff clear the tables when you're done and they do it fairly efficiently. There was a steady flow of diners and takeout customers while we were there, with Jamaican patties being a very popular, quick, and inexpensive item."}
{"text":"The rating is based solely on the patties. I got the extra spicy beef and they were delicious. Crispy shell, good amount of filling and spicy but not overbearing. You can't go wrong with the patty combo - 2 patties and a pop for $3. My mouth is watering just thinking about it now."}
{"text":"I came here on a Friday evening and it was dead (though I believe it usually is).. there was the occasional customer coming in to pick up a box of patties.

We ordered jerk chicken and a spicy beef patty, came to ~$10, sure, reasonable. The jerk chicken was put in a take-out container and bagged up for us; we were never asked whether we were dining in or taking out (they had metal utensils available, so I'm sure they offer that option).

The food as 'meh' at best, the patty was decent, as it is the same one you can find in places such as the Union Station convenience store in the Bay Concourse. The jerk chicken was a very small portion, very stingy on the beans and rice.

This restaurant is quite large and offers a lot of spacing."}
{"text":"Ordered some jerk pork and chicken. Pretty standard affair. The employee was kind enough to add some jerk sauce on top, but it was very thick... like a gravy! That caught me by surprise. The rice and beans, while decent, were not worth the 4$ per container. The chicken itself was pretty good! Big, meaty, flavourful pieces. The jerk pork... hit or miss. Some pieces were a bit dry, but I guess it can't be helped when making jerk pork!

I recommend going next door to Babu if you want to get more for your money, but if caribbean food is what you want, you'll be hard pressed to find another option within your travel radius. Patties here... haven't tried for some time! I remember they were OK."}
{"text":"Delicious patty!!  Disappointed in the hours.  Open mon to sat 10am to six. 
Gd place only for quick snack. best patties ever!! nom nom nom"}
{"text":"I stumbled across this last a year ago, we were just in the area and wanted a snack. We were going to go for pizza pizza however saw the word patties and definitely wanted to try. Obviously a year later we enjoy going to this spot. 

The patties are the only thing we get at this spot. They are always nice and flaky yet not too much dough always just right. The usual order for us is, me: regular spicy and coco bun + drink (grapefruit soda) him:  2 regular spicy patties and a coke (and then he ALMOST ALWAYS walks back in and gets another 2) 

The customer service here is great. They great you as soon as you come through the door and they don't rush you when you order. For the North-East end this is a great spot to go and get some snacks!"}
{"text":"I was served the bottom of the pan of ox tail. Bones and sauce. Not worth going to for lunch."}
{"text":"The patties are exactly what I wanted so no complaints but nothing to brag over.
Filling = decent. Crust & shell = flaky & substantial."}
{"text":"ordered jerk pork with rice and peas. also had a beef patty.

beef patty was good. very rich.

jerk pork wasn't as savoury as i expected. woul get the mutton next time, that looked bomb."}
{"text":"When reheated overnight leftover from George's Tastee tasted as good as when I ate it fresh!! 

Jerk Pork has a nice proportion of fat and lean meat.. though not the most healthy selections.. but that gives me a sense of guilty pleasure when I feel all the fatty meat in my mouth... 

Jerk Chicken is a little boring by comparison.. But good dark meat.. still nice and moist.... 

Now what should I do next time when I order? Pork Fat? or Chicken Lean? 

The rice too are cooked with good texture.. fluffy... chewy and soft at the same time,,, and drowned in gravy! 

2nd meal is 50% off.. so maybe I just get both each from now on? 

No seatings at all... definitely a take out joint! And they also serves burgers and fries till 3 pm for the lunch crowds!"}
{"text":"Nom Nom Nom..

Yes me stuffing my face with Jerk Chicken with Rice and Peas ($6.99)

Oh how awesome is it??!! The Jerk Chicken here is one of the best I ate as of now in TO! It is that good!! And since I got the dark meat part, it was so moist, fall of the bone tender and the spicy is perfect!! And I guess the gravy helps to make the chicken extra tasty!!

Kola Champagne ($1.15) 
I don't usually drink pop...but hmmm it just feels like something lacking without a cool Caribbean drink.. The cooler has tons of Grace Branded pop... Coconut Water from Thailand. Help yourself with the drinks from the cooler!

Extra Spicy Beef Patties ($1.75)
Not too spicy... but it is good enough to have enough flavour to make it tasty! Flaky shell goes well with the spicy beef... Nom Nom Nom

Now I am eating all these Jamaican food, daydreaming of being somewhere warm... until I walked out of Tastee back to -13C and back to reality!

They accepts cash or debit (over $5) only!

PS they have buy one and get 2nd meal for half price, so bring your good friends along and he/she will thanks you!!"}
{"text":"Service:
It's a one man show. The gentleman serving me was the cashier, cook, and server.

Ambiance:
Went during Friday night at prime dinner time and the shop was empty. This already tells you a lot. It's almost like a fast food style joint, where you order and find your own seat. 

Food:
I tried two items from the menu, the patty and jerk chicken dinner. I have to say it's the worst patty and jerk chicken I ever had in Toronto. Despite the fact I had both in Jamaica, the quality is below par in Toronto standard. The patty was dry and hard, and the meat was tasteless. The jerk chicken dinner tasted like Uncle Ben rice with powdered gravy on it. The chicken was also really dry and I couldn't really taste the jerk spice."}
{"text":"This location is much more convenient for me. Hubby and I usually get patties and coco buns from here for lunch or afternoon snack. Reliably good quality beef patties. We haven't yet tried other items they have here. 
Overall, will be back again for more beef patties"}
{"text":"Great combos and patties.  Not sure if it's authentic but taste pretty good and don't need to travel too far to downtown!"}
{"text":"Not the best looking cake but the taste definitely makes up for what it lacks for in presentation. Tiramisu was soft and moist, with a hint of coffee flavour and not overly sweet. Also enjoy a jerk pork sandwich while picking up a cake. Definitely taste the jerk spice but not as spicy as others."}
{"text":"OK...I don't want to start the whole...\"THE BEST PATTIES IN TOWN\" debate.
It's been hacked, hashed, and totally worn out.
I've had Non Nisa, Allen's, Randy's, Warden Station, Patty King, Pattyman, Island Foods,... and more.  I keep going back to Tastee's because they are good and conveniently located.
They have their standard patty, extra spicy, chicken, and even veg.  This is not their only offering.  They have jerk chicken, pork, and other Jamaican goodies.
Great lunch spot for dine in and takeout."}
