{"text":"Attended a wedding here last night...the food was terrible. 200 guests, I spoke to at least 50 guests who felt the same way. How a company of this size could produce this quality of meal is beyond me. Absolutely unacceptable. ...2 times I've been here and both huge disappointments. Meat came out cold, pasta overcooked with tomatoe sauce that tasted like it came out of a Heinz can. Coming from an Italian upbringing,  this was an embarrassment to my culture. I would absolutely never recommend the place to anyone!!!! And we won't even talk about one of the ladies (Lin) serving at the bar treating guests at the bar quite rudely. Harassing guests in the dining room for I'D and taking drinks away from the table insuiating they were underage drinkers was a joke. What a S..T show this was!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This morning my family and I attended the Sunday Brunch at the Manor by Peter and Paul's. I truly love coming here as the drive up to Kettleby is beautiful and the grounds are so well manicured you truly feel like a somebody when you  pull up. 

The main hall you walk into for brunch is massive and overlooks the large man made pond on the grounds and the golf course. Wide windows let in not only the scenery BUT also the days sunlight. 

Prepare yourself when you walk in however because the buffet is truly something to behold  What a spread! 

1. Antipasto table with an array of grilled veggies, sea food, salads, cold cuts, cheeses and more

2. Breakfast table with freshly made mini Belgian waffles, pancakes, an French toast. Also has all your traditional breakfast staples in  abundance (bacon, sausage, hash browns) but the x factor here is the made to order omelet bar. 

3. Meat table had a pulled pork baked pie, roast beef carving station, tandoori chicken, rice, roast potato and a made to order pasta station. 

4. Last but not least is the famous dessert table which you first hit up for some freshly squeezed Orange juice upon arrival. After your meal (or mid way through of that's how you roll) there is a selection and pastries, cookies, cakes and pies that would send even a healthy person into a diabetic coma. Not being a huge dessert person I tend to lean towards the milk chocolate foundation and fresh fruit. Wonderful!

Food, scenery and sophisticated ambiance aside my favorite part of brunch is the roaming accordion player who moves from table to table playing a seemingly limitless selection of tunes to ear or by memory. He's a sweet old gent who has a twinkle in his eye and and a warm smile and with a wink makes you feel like family. 

For $29.99 a person i am more than Happy to make this place my 100th Yelp Review. Well deserved and highly recommend it as one of best hidden brunch spots in the GTA or other."}
{"text":"This place is a standard, cookie cutter banquet hall for weddings.  It's pretty, but it's also over an hour outside Toronto, and most of your guests, unless you are all from Newmarket, will have to travel far to get there.  The nearest hotel is a thirty minute cab ride, so options for that are pretty limited as well.

I thought staff here were great, the bartender (only one at a time, but rotated who it was behind bar) was always fast and friendly.  Some logistics of the food on the table; the salad was served family style but only was given to one half of the table, so the other half never saw it.  It would have been nice to have a menu on the table so we knew what we were eating.  This could be a comment on the venue, or the couple, not sure.  Coat check was on a different floor than the room we were in, so that was a bit unhelpful if you wanted to grab something from your coat.  
I don't like when the bar is outside the room with the dance floor, either, I think it breaks the party up and makes people less likely to dance.

Food was edible, but nothing special.  If you're looking for a pretty standard wedding venue, this might be a good choice.  I think location really docks a lot of points from me."}
{"text":"This was a beautiful spot for a wedding: pond, gazebo, waterfall... just really nice.

The wedding was outdoors and the reception was inside. One of the bartenders was the friendliest, most excitable person I'd ever met. He was fantastic, quick and made a ton of jokes.

The space inside was also quite nice. Our only issue was that we were right at the door to the kitchen and we could hear everyone inside talking, to the point where it was hard to listen to the speeches. At one point, a guy yelled \"EVERYONE, SHUTUP!\" which worked for about 2 minutes.

Food was average and service was fine."}
{"text":"Great spot for a wedding! There were multiple events going on at the same time, but we had no idea due to the sound proofing. It was not until we left that we saw the other group. Beautiful venue with friendly staff!"}
{"text":"The outside looks very nice and the banquet hall is freshly renovated.But omg how can people be so disorganized? They can't tell you their price (initially they said 85 per person, but when we came to our appointment they said the minimum price is around 115 per person), they can't communicate the time you have to be there, leaving only 15 minutes for your appointment..this is how they treat their potential customers?"}
{"text":"Came here for a fundraiser and really liked the venue. Great views outside the windows of the banquet hall with excellent staff.
Food want too over the top but still had excellent presentation.
All in all seems like a great venue for big parties and weddings."}
{"text":"My whole family went here for a big Sunday brunch celebration on Mother's Day and we had a great experience. There was a wonderful spread with many stations of  food being prepared fresh in front of you. For $40 each there was lots to eat: Seafood, pastas, salmon and prime rib, antipasto, fresh waffles and omelettes, and a room filled with delicious desserts. I think The Manor did a great job of staggering the start time of guests so there wasn't a big rush all at once. That being said, it was nice being part of the first group in and getting first dibs on everything! The only disappointing thing about the food was that after I discovered something I loved, such as the vegetable lasagna, and decided I needed one more taste of it, when I got to it a new dish had been put out and it was not nearly as yummy as the first. It tasted like it was made completely differently and lacked the quality of the first one. Besides this detail, we were all very happy with the variety that was offered and we really enjoyed trying a little bit of everything - or maybe a lot of everything. Too much actually. All the staff were very friendly and they all made a point to wish us all a happy Mother's Day - something it seemed they were all instructed to do. A nice little included extra was a photographer taking pictures of the guests and their families and all the mothers received a copy to take home. This was a nice memory to have of the day and something I could tell everyone loved. 
Overall, the Manor put on a fabulous brunch with beautiful scenery and welcoming atmosphere. I think we will be doing this again next year!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times for weddings and large family get-togethers and special occasions, and though renovated, it doesn't seem like it's changed very much in terms of decor over the last couple of decades.

I was here most recently in the fall for my cousin's wedding reception of 250-300 people. One of the areas downstairs was reserved, the banquet hall for the dinner, dancing, speeches, etc., with doors that lead to the outdoor terrace/patio area for photos, the cocktail hour, and appetizers prior to dinner.

There was an oyster bar and vodka shot station set up outside, as well as the open bar, appetizers were passed around, and later at night, this was an area for those who needed fresh air, smokers, and a midnight live BBQ and crab legs.

For dinner, there was an appetizer, choice of meat or vegetarian main course, and dessert, plus water and wine at the table, the wedding cake, fruit, and late-night specialty coffees and more desserts, with live cannoli preparation. I found the chicken breast really dry, my steak overcooked to medium-well/well and wine reduction was too salty, and the crème brûlée was cold, but much of this is to be expected with the volume they had to prepare within a short time frame, and often typical of wedding reception food. I was stuffed either way with everything else that was served, so no real complaints here.

Tons of guests, tons of food, and service was quick and accommodating. The dancefloor seemed quite small, considering the size of the hall, but again, there were so many people, and most of us were the dancing type :) Overall a great night!"}
{"text":"Had brunch last Sunday and the quality of the food was pretty good.  Only downfall was the selection was very small compare to their competitors.  Therefore the value of the brunch is not worth it.  The ambiance is amazing."}
{"text":"Truthfully, this was just another banquet hall style place for me. I went for a wedding last night and I thought the food was of very good quality. The filet mignon was properly cooked and the stuffed chicken was delicious. 

It wasnt really any different than any other golf course based event place"}
{"text":"I attended a wedding at the Manor, realizing later that I had my prom there as well. The venue is quite large. The outside is very picturesque with a large pond, gazebo, and waterfall. It is well suited for a summer wedding. The reception is held inside, where they have a number of fairly large banquet halls comfortably seating a few hundred guests. The staff are attentive and professional. 

The dance floor in the banquet hall seemed a little too small. By my guess, it could accommodate only 20% of the guest. This left me confined to a limited area always being careful not to step on people's feet. Another pet peeve was the noise from events in neighboring halls coming through to ours during the quiet moments like during speeches."}
{"text":"We went here for a wedding reception and the place is very nice.   Beautiful pond, nice fountains overall great place.   The food that we had was ok, eggs, waffles, beef, chicken were ok.   The halls are very large, good service.    I wish there was an elevator as walking up the stairs in high heels was hard but the views made up for it."}
