{"text":"So first of all I must say that I would actually give this a 4.5 star rating if that was an option but since it is not I have to give it five because it is certainly better than a 4.  
For sometime now I have been craving a good deli close by because I love a good hot sandwich.  So I finally decided to come here to Yelp to see if there were any around and to my delight Greenfield's Deli was only a little more than a mile from my work.  Anyway, I checked out the menu and thought it looked good so I decided I would give it a try.  
My biggest concern when it come to delis is the amount of stuff inside the sandwich.  It is always a disappointment when your meal is mostly bread accented by some sandwich filling.  I really just want the bread to be the tool that holds the insides together and adds a little bit of crunch and taste on my hot sandwiches and that is what I got.  I ordered a hot pastrami sandwich which is essentially a reuben (my all-time favorite).  I get it on sourdough since I don't like rye.  After I ordered and paid I realized there was an option to get a side and a drink for only a $1.50 more so I asked if I could add that and they said \"no problem\".  She rang me up for the difference and I got a bottle of diet soda (they have fountain drinks and a bunch of bottled options) and a broccoli salad (they have several chip options or homemade sides).  The salad was awesome and the sandwich was very good with lots of Pastrami.  Where I would subtract the half star would just be because the pastrami wasn't as flavorful as a lot of other pastrami I have had and the sourdough bread wasn't as \"sourgdoughy\" as I would have liked (although the lady did tell me that about the bread when I was ordering).  All and all I love this place.  I usually don't spend this much money for lunch so I won't be back very often but when I'm craving a good sandwich this will be my go-to spot."}
{"text":"Delish! Big portions for a great price. The pasta salad is amazing and everyone was very nice. Clean place and again the sandwiches are huge. Plenty left over for next day!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had different experiences... I REALLY enjoyed my French dip sandwich (A+) but my husband only gave his turkey sandwich a C..."}
{"text":"I eat at this deli about 2-3 times per month now.  Portions are large!  I get a sandwich, soup, and a self serve drink for about $10 and I take half the sandwich for later it is a lot of food.  I think the BLT is the best but the roast beef and cheese is excellent with the horseradish mayo.  Their macaroni salad is wonderful...

They are very polite especially 'Sharon'.  They seem to do a lot of takeout and pickup orders so they must be popular.  I don't eat desserts but they look homemade and sinful."}
{"text":"I had the Country Club on Wheat. The sandwich was packed with fresh ingredients and a lot of flavor. I would eat here again. Friendly staff too."}
{"text":"Omg ate here today and it was delicious!!! Beautiful place, great employees and awesome prices! I will be a return buyer!!"}
{"text":"We wanted to find a local deli instead of a chain. This place serves Boars Head meat and is clean. However, its not anything special. We both got the italian cold cut, macaroni salad and potato salad. The macaroni salad is good, the potato salad is the same kind you get at the store, and we both didnt care for the sandwich. Jersey Mikes or Firehouse would have been better."}
{"text":"All Boar's Head Meats !!! First time in, had the Italian on Sub Roll and was EXCELLENT !! They also have Soups, I sampled the Turkey Corn Chowed and could have had that alone as my lunch. VERY GOOD FOOD !"}
{"text":"Great food! I love the BLT sandwich with crispy bacon adding avacado! My husband likes the roast beef sandwich adding creamy horseradish and a side of au jus.  The turkey and Italian sub are fantastic. Service is very friendly and welcoming! Unfortunately they close for the summer! Would like  to know when they open up again."}
{"text":"Pretty good.  I'm on an Italian Sub kick right now so I gave this spot a try.  It's in a pretty accesible area with good parking.  The inside is small but accomodating and there are a few patio tables outside.   

The sandwich and potato salad were solid.  The ingregidents were fresh and the portions were huge.  The only thing that left a little to be desired was the bread.  Great bread makes a great sandwich in my opinion.  I'd go back and probably take something to go."}
{"text":"It was pretty good in the morning had French Dip, would come here again only in the afternoon, it was a good sandwich and well made..."}
{"text":"Huge sandwiches that taste delicious and fresh every time!!! Love their country club!! I get it everytime because it's just so good!"}
{"text":"This is not a deli. It's an office with a kitchen attached. It took 20 minutes to make 1 sandwich and there was no one ahead of us. The people before us had their food delivered 30 seconds after we placed our order. The $10 sandwich was average and not worth $10. The pickle was GREAT!"}
{"text":"The Reuben i got was nothing special. I think I've had better at Arby's. The macaroni salad was absolutely delicious. Couldn't tell if the cookie I got was peanut butter or a sugar cookie. Either way it was very stale and crumbly most of it ended up in my beard."}
{"text":"Yummerz!  Fresh & delicious food.  The sandwiches are huge.  You could split a sandwich between two ppl and be satisfied.  The Country Club, Pastrami and Turkey Avocado sandwiches were ordered.  All were very good.  We also ordered potato salad and the peach cobbler.  The cobbler was good, but not what I am accustomed to.  Rather than a pastry like crust, it was more like a bread pudding or mushy cake on top.  Still good though.

I would def. come back again.  They offer the type of sandwiches and sides I think of when I hear \"Deli\"."}
{"text":"I like a good Italian sandwich and was looking forward to trying this Deli since it serves Boar's Head. With that said, the cost of the sandwich was a little too much for what I got. There was more bread than meat and veggies. I highly recommend ordering it on anything but the roll."}
{"text":"Loved the food, very fresh, good portion size, very clean, outdoor & indoor tables...price was good! I like this place & will be back again!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try a new sandwich place. Wow, was i disappointed!  Ordered oven roasted chicken salad on sub roll. What a huge fail. Bread was rock hard and stale on one side--no way they didn't notice when cutting it!  Then the chicken salad or lack thereof. Decent flavor from the little I had after pulling it off the roll. Nothing like the pictures or reviews. Embarrassing that they would serve something like this and charge me $8!! Rip.."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. The Husband and my father in law are always in search of an amazing sandwich. I found myself hungry and in front of Greenfield Deli while on my way to the neighboring Walgreens. I'm usually not a sandwich type of girl, but something called me in here today, and boy am I glad!

The woman running the counter was extremely friendly and helpful when I mentioned it was my first visit and I was a vegetarian. She even went into the back to find a delicious, fresh red bell pepper to add and diced it up right then and there! The other woman who was creating the sandwich was also super kind, and went through the trouble of answering my every question of sauces they had to offer. I'm kind of condiment crazy. It's a thing. 



Anyway, stop here the next time you want a sandwich with a smile and solid, genuine, kind service. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Terrible deli, if you can call it that. Took forever, got my order wrong, sub par food. I won't be going back. The workers there shouldn't be trusted around food. Contemplated not eating the sandwich."}
