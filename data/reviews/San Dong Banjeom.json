{"text":"I didn't even know Chinese Korean cuisine was a thing until I came here.

It's largely noodle and rice dishes with heavy Korean emphasis and a Chinese spin. The meat dishes are eerily similar to white-washed Chinese dishes like Ginger Beef and Sweet and Sour pork.

They're not very generous on choice ingredients. Also service is subpar but that's to be expected from a Korean staff with broken English and 95% of its patrons being Korean families.

Needless to say, it's all quite authentic in that regard"}
{"text":"First time here. Drive by on Sunday and saw line up at front door at 2.15 pm and decide to give a try. Nice fusion restaurant of Korean and chinese.  I would prefer mild spicy seafood noodle soup and their sweet and sour pork. Both are excellent. Yes, will recommend this to my friend."}
{"text":"I've heard about how delicious Jajangmyeon is and I was very eager to try it. I searched online and I was surprised to see how close the restaurant was from my location. I must say, it was an absolute delightful dish! I will be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of San Dong Ban Jeom.  San Dong (I think using all 4 syllables each time I refer to this place is excessive) has some pretty yummy and inexpensive Korean-style Chinese food that is unmatched (because of a lack of competition) in Calgary. 

However, I realize that not everyone is gonna like this place (as evident by several other reviews). Basically you've got to come here and NOT expect it to have Korean BBQ. Also don't expect Bibimbap.  And don't expect tofu stews.  Because that is NOT what San Dong (the place is totally Sans Dong, and Dong-free) is all about.  

This place is about black bean noodles, cold noodles, and the sweet n sour pork/chicken.  The Jap Chae ain't that great but everything else....you're not going to find better Korean-style Chinese food in Calgary.  Unless your mom is Korean-Chinese, in which case you won't need to come here because your mom will be too disappointed in you to let you come here."}
{"text":"5 stars based completely on their mild spicy seafood white soup.  Noodles were perfect and the flavors were bang on.  Could've been better selection for seafood (not just a lot of squid).   I was very sick that day and the soup actually made me feel so much better.  That's what soul food should do and this place does it right.  Going back tomorrow with more foodie friends.  I eat a lot of Korean food and this one is definitely worth bringing my friends to."}
{"text":"Wow! That was a good meal!!! Best Korean food we ever had!

We've been to a lot of Korean restaurants in Vancouver since we love Korean food as you can probably see in my profile that most of reviews and check ins are Korean restaurants. Since this place is only 3 minutes from our AirBnB, we decided to go here because it's close and I saw on the pictures that they have Kang poong gi. 

We ordered the half soup and half black bean noodles and Kang poong gi (#34). And it was gooood! The chicken is not too spicy and just had the right taste to it but probably just too much sauce. If you're having the chicken to go and want it still crispy when you get home, try having the sauce on the side or just asked not to put too much sauce on it. The half and half is a pretty good combo and deal. It's nice to get to try both especially if this your 1st time having Korean food.

If we're from around here, we'll most likely be here all the time!!!"}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended by many people that I know a few are Korean. This is a authentic Korean Resturant. 
Mostly noodles and rice dishes. I miss the mix rice bow that other places offer but this place has selections that other restaurants don't offer. 
This time I ordered all vegetarian dishes and I am not a 100% vegetarian so that puts a damper of the taste. That's why I give 3 stars for their vegetarian dishes. As I had much tastier vegetarian foods. 
But other all experience was very good. 
I will come back and try them for other foods. 
Price is reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Really good Korean Chinese style black bean noodle. Being Chinese myself, I like the original Chinese style black bean paste noodle. My Korean roommate used to take me here all the time. This is also the Korean restaurant I missed the most in Calgary."}
{"text":"Pretty good hole in the wall place for surpassingly different take on Asian noodles.
Never heard of black bean sauce noodles but they were pretty tasty.  We had half black bean half spicy seafood noodle and they were both tasty.  Spicy = pretty hot!
Also had deep fried pork deer and sour.  Sounds very Western but it was done very well.  
Large portions plus nice service.   Will need t explore more items on their menu."}
{"text":"Came here with my friends; it was so good. I'm addicted to the black bean noodles and this is by far my favourite in Calgary! The service here was quick and luckily my BFF is Korean and she did all the ordering for us. 

We got the black bean noodle with extra onion.....amazing. My friend got the black bean noodle with seafood she said there wasn't much seafood but taste really good still. We also ordered the mild beef soup but it was only okay. 

I definitely will be returning to try there other black bean dishes!"}
{"text":"This restaurant offers authentic Korean-Chinese dishes. 
People who looks for traditional Korean food, this is not the place (it is rather a Chinese style restaurant with Korean mix).
I ordered black bean sauce noodles (Jajangmyeon) and Korean style sweet and sour pork (Tangsuyuk). Both of them are delicious (quantity a bit small compares to what I used to get from Los Angeles or Seattle). 
If you are coming from South Korea or big cities where you can easily get Korean Chinese dishes, this restaurant dishes may taste like an average.
However, this restaurant might be the best Korean Chinese restaurant in this town.
Their service is average.
They provide free parking but limited during busy hours.
They tend to get busy during weekends."}
{"text":"Just happened to see this place driving and thought why not. 

It's in a little strip mall shared with a convenience store so parking was a bit of a challenge with \"15 minute\" signs everywhere. 

At first we thought it might be a dive. A bit dated inside. But there were a fair amount of people eating and it was quick to be seated and the staff were friendly. The menu was hard to decide from and we asked for their recommendation. Ended up with deep fried pork & peppers with a side of rice, side of noodles and added in their deep fried dumplings. 

Now this is the second time I've had Korean food and both were delicious. Most are sharing dishes. The price for two people to eat without drinks being under $30 bucks is pretty amazing and you leave happy. The dish was great and had just the right amount of spice for me. 

I thought it was odd they dropped scissors off with the chop sticks and plates (You'll need them to cut the noodles) I highly recommend the dish we had and if you like Korean or want to try it, this place is great."}
{"text":"Although I do not eat spicy food, I really like the half & half - black bean noodles & spicy seafood noodle soup. The black bean sauce is sweet so it balances the spiciness of the soup. The texture of the noodle is very chewy, I love it.

The price is very reasonable and always have tables, no need to line up.


The service is okay, sometimes is good but there's one time my husband and I were not happy about what the chef did. What happened is we ordered tofu & shrimp on rice;  few bites after it came, we realized there was no shrimps but pork. We asked the waitress, then she talked to the chef (we could so see the chef in the kitchen from our table). The answer we got was \"Yes the chef changed it\", no apology, and the chef expression was like \"so what\"; and we got charged the same price (shrimp is always more expensive then pork!)."}
{"text":"Solid 4/5 in my books. Not the typical Korean you see around which normally involves bbq and hot pot. Mostly noodle/rice dishes as well as meat dishes. Quiet and not crowded when we went... everyone else there was Korean so I took this as a good sign! At first I thought it was pricy, but once I saw the portions  I felt much better about it!

We had the tray of noodles with red pepper and seafood as well as the fried chicken with spicy soy sauce. The noodles weren't overly spicy for me and had a good chew to them. The seafood consisted mainly of shrimp and squid and the sauce I thought could use a touch more depth of flavour. The chicken tasted soooo good! If it could have stayed a bit crisper for longer that would have been perfect! 

I'll definitely be back to try the jajangmyeon!"}
