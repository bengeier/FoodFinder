{"text":"Bad sushi: tons of rice, cheap cuts of fish, and sloppy preparation...yes, it's an all-you-can-eat place, but it doesn't even meet that basic, minimum standard.  Amazingly bad service: with three waiters/waitresses and few other people in the restaurant, I literally had to wave multiple times to get their attention...10% gratuity is automatically added, and I can see why.  Bad sushi + amazingly bad service = bad"}
{"text":"Scratching my head with the bad review someone gave.  Naha sushi is not the best, but it's way above average for this area, and it's a ayce.  They also have the beef stilled around asparagus, my favorite.  Their selection of noodles is also quite refreshing, even if each order comes in tiny tiny bowls that are served in the tasting menu.  There's apparemtly no limit to how many items you want to order as long as you eat them all.  Their tempura is much better than that big buffet down by west beaver creek and highway 7.   There are a few good sushi restaurants in GTA, but as far as ayce goes.  The selection is pretty decent.   The decor though, makes it feel like a place where high school kids hang out, so not a place to bring a date you want to impress, but for a quick lunch, it is more than adequate."}
{"text":"I used to come here with friends a couple years ago and just passed by today when going to TD. Was lunch time so I thought I'd drop by and see how they were doing.  Bought a take out bento for $10 and 8 pc salmon sashimi for $5 and was not disappointed. Portions were what I expected and both the raw and the cooked portions were quite fresh. The restaurant is clean with modern decor and a nice relaxing atmosphere. Staff are attentive and food was prepared decently quick. They even gave us cups of water while we were deciding what to order. Only con was they gave me ginger wasabi and tempura sauce but forgot the soy sauce."}
{"text":"This is my Go-To Sushi restaurant in the area. Have tried almost all of the sushi restaurants in the Woodbridge area, and none of them beat Naha!  The food is always consistent in quality and taste, whether you are eating in for All-You-Can-Eat or Take out.  The have a large variety of food on their menu and have all kinds of non-fish options. I am always impressed with their sashimi servings as the fish always tastes fresh and the pieces are thick and quite large.   They offer a discount if you pay in cash.  The only complaint I have is that (like every AYCE sushi joint I've been to) they often forget to bring orders. Sometimes, even when ordering it again. The wait staff is sometimes friendly, but other times it's hard to get their attention or they ignore you.  It is also disappointing that they removed Unagi from the menu and no longer serve it.  Overall, still my favourite of the many sushi options we have here in Woodbridge. I often recommend this place to family and friends."}
{"text":"This place is like any other all-you-can-eat sushi restaurant with the exception of bacon-wrapped asparagus on the menu. The staff are attentive and the food is okay. They didn't forget anything on our order, which is always nice but overall, come here only when you're starving, otherwise only one word comes to mind: mediocre."}
{"text":"Good sushi. Clean. Very good selection of noodles, soups, teriyaki as well as all the regular sushi. The special rolls like dragon rolls or sashimi costs extra. Special cash price for lunch. The only negative is the servers sometimes have attitude. My friends and I have been chased after short changing them 90 cents for not leaving there undeserved previously added to the bill 15% tip."}
{"text":"I must say, it's your money worth. Not like any other all you can eat sushi, the staff here is on their feet. They are there when you need them, they don't take hours to bring you the food. Most importantly they not forget anything you ordered, which was a first to me.   Flavour wise.. Above average. Could be a lot worst for its price. I do recommend to try berthing except the sushi pizza and their deep fried roll. It can get unpleasant. Other than those two, everything is a go!   Place is always clean, staff are friendly, food is good, this is my o o spot or all you can eat sushi.   Enjoy"}
{"text":"From time to time you get to visit places and then jokingly think to yourself, I guess this is the last time they'll see me, do I even have to give a tip. Well this was one of those places. Average at best and nothing stands out. But I'd be lying to say it was not memorable.   I ordered fried rice and some fried spicy chicken because I always order a bit of everything. They came with a plate of fried rice and a large serving of the chicken, a rip-off of a sort I've never experienced anywhere else. And this wasn't just a small plate, its one of those servings you get when you order from a Chinese food court. I had to finish it and barely had any space for anything after. I drive by this place everyday and that memory still haunts me when I see their sign.  Me being the first reviewer does not surprise me at all."}
{"text":"Fam & I visited the restaurant back in Oct 2009 and to this date, I still haven't seen other restaurants quite like this one that offers AYCE (all you can eat) \"Salmon Sashimi\" along with whatever is on the menu, specially in the Bay Area.  I am so glad to have family with GREAT palate living in Toronto, Canada with \"VIP\" stat @ Naha Sushi, to boot!!"}
{"text":"If I could give them 1 star, I would. Everytime I ask for squid sashimi, it's always thinly  stripped slices. You call that sashimi?! The salmon sashimi isn't always fresh. I've complained to them about it twice, but everytime they bring me back a 'fresh' platter, barely anything has been done about it. They'd give me half fresh, and half the same as before. When I complain to them about it again, they'd talk trash about me in Mandarin. Little did they know that I can understand them quite well."}
{"text":"You can't go wrong with all you can eat sushi for $11.  I can eat just as much at lunch time than I can at dinner, so I always like to do all-you-can eat lunches since it's less expensive, plus you have the rest of the day to burn it all off.   The service was quick on the first order, and a little bit slower on the second, since there were more people in the restaurant at that point.    The food quality is good as well.    The only reason I'm not giving this place 5/5 is that there is not a whole lot of selection, compared to some other japanese buffets."}
