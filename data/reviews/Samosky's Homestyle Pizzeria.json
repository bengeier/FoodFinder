{"text":"This is an excellent neighborhood pizza joint that has grown on me.  The Philly Steak Pizza is unique and outstanding.  This is a must-have for your first visit.  The Open BBQ Pit Pizza was a nice compromise on a particular night (I wanted barbecue and my wife wanted pizza).  I made the mistake of ordering a large in order to have leftovers and that was way too much.  It is a very generous and hardy pizza!  A medium is the equivalent of a large at other pizza joints.  My new favorite pie here is the Meatball in Hog Heaven.  Their meatballs are outstanding!  Another super-hardy pizza and is one I will definitely get again.  Their wings are decent, but leave something to be desired for carry-out orders.  They ended up slimy. Stick with pizza...   As for dessert, the key lime pie was very good, but there is also a full-service ice cream counter serving Hersey's ice creams."}
{"text":"Loved the calamari but other food was hit and miss.  Second time which will be the last time was when my husband ordered the Mild chicken wings.  When they were brought to the table I asked him if he had ordered buffalo wings as I could smell the heat in the sauce .  He said no that he had ordered mild.  He hadn't tasted them yet,  When he did taste one he had to put it down.  He flagged the waitress and told her they were not mild and she stated that it was and that their mild was spicy.  No offer to exchange for something else.  Who would expect mild to be spicy??  Another waitress came by for refill and she asked how things were and he said again the chicken was spicier then expected and she said she could tell by the smell that they were hot  and again he mentioned that he had ordered the mild and they were not what he expected.  She politely smiled and walked away.  We ate the other items and he asked for a box to take the wings home as he hates waste.  It was at this time that the original waitress offers  ranch dressing for him to cut the heat and eat them there AFTER we've eaten everything else and are asking for the check as shes dropping off the box.  Not what I would call an honest effort to be helpful because it only came at the time for him to tip.   Completely disappointed with the whole experience.  FYI, I tried the wing and it was  similar to the Buffalo wing sauce, Frank's."}
{"text":"Avoid this place on weekends, at least. I went on a Saturday, early afternoon. It was bedlam. I was seated promptly. I was totally ignored from then on. The waitresses carefully looked the other way as they brushed past my table. I was dressed at least as well as other diners. Tables for two or more were being thrown their food. After waiting for 15 minutes, I graciously left. The servers and host weren't around to notice.   Such treatment deserves documentation and no return back. I don't return to restaurants that ignore me. That list is very short: one."}
{"text":"When you live in the boonies, you are happy to have a decent local pizzeria.  If you are looking for a good simple topping pizza you will not be disappointing.  The topings were just right and the crust was perfect.  If, on the other hand, you get one of their specialty pizzas, ask for a longer bake. The specialty pizzas always come out doughy and unappealing.  The service is so-so, but out here you get what you get."}
{"text":"The service is mediocre but what can you expect from a small town pizzeria? The pizza is some of the best pizza I've had & I have had a lot all over the country. I like the selection of pastry's and ice cream. The only downside to this \"restraunt\" is that when you purchase an ice cream cone, or basically anything that has ice cream. They inform you that you can only consume it outdoors, which by all means is okay if it is seventy degrees out. But for most of the past three weeks its been almost a hundred out. I would'nt even be able to eat it before it had melted. CHANGE YOUR POLICY ALREADY. I'm not the only one who has complained. A lot has changed since they moved from the old location to the new one. The welcoming, small town feel is gone. The newer employees are more abrasive than the previous ones. Since I live up the road I will always remain a customer, but I wish some things could change for the better."}
{"text":"My go to pizza place since they opened, here in my hometown  which has been quite some years! Nothing on the menu has ever been disappointing, service is always quick & painless if I may add."}
{"text":"I highly recommend the Philly Cheese Steak pizza, it is better than many actual cheese steaks sandwiches I have had through the years."}
{"text":"Wow!  This pizza is so amazing. We ordered a phillychesse steak pizza and a calzone. Everything was perfect.  Every time we eat here it's consistent...delicious.  And their key lime pie is phenomenal. If you have never been here, try it.  You will be back."}
{"text":"I walked in to pick up my takeout and there were about 5 girls standing behind the counter and they all just watched me stand at the register waiting for one of them to help me as they quickly finished texting. There's a sign on the register that tells the customers to stay off of their phones but maybe they should have one for their employees! When I told the girl what I'm here to pick up she looked at me like a deer in headlights, mumbled my total and after she checked me out she just walked away without saying anything!! After standing there for 15 minutes, clueless, finally someone came out with my pizza. Pizza was decent, the employees attitudes made it taste worse though"}
{"text":"I recently moved to Brunswick and had a friend ask me if I had tried Samoskys yet.  Today I had that opportunity, and it was a great experience! My friend and I chose to sit outside, as it was a beautiful day. The outdoor area is covered and has lots of ceiling fans. The menu is extensive. There were at least 5 things I was debating between. Our server was very nice and friendly. I ended up going with a calzone and was somewhat apprehensive because the usual place I get calzones from is hard to beat. I was impressed! The dough was light and had some sort of yummy garlic butter on top. The small size was more than enough. I never do leftovers, but still ended up with two pieces after I got full.  The other thing I can't get over was the price! Everything was extremely reasonable. They appeared to have a nice salad bar that I would like to try next time. I will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"My first time visiting today! I had their famed Spinachi Pizza which took 1st place in 2013 at a competition in Vegas. It's a white pizza so no tomato sauce obviously. It's garlic butter, sausage, spinach, asiago and feta cheese, and then the real uniqueness kicks in...cranberries and sunflower seeds. I'll say this, who would've thought cranberries and garlic would be a match made in heaven?? It's great! While the pizza could spare some more sunflower seeds, the only thing holding this back from five stars was the crust. While it was buttery, it was a little doughy for me. I like a pizza crust with more crunch and less chewy.  I don't want to feel like I'm just eating bread with toppings. Either way, the Spinachi is a winner in my book and I would certainly like to revisit Somosky's for another go at this uncommonly good concoction."}
{"text":"The fish fry was awesome. Light flakey buttery fish was so delicious. The pierogi were great tasting too. Wish they would save the coleslaw! Not good! Son had the pulled pork which was equally delicious !"}
{"text":"Great pizza. But skip the fish tacos and pierogies...over priced. Taco shells were cold, should be grilled or even just warmed. Guacomole sauce was light. For the price, should have been chunky. Three small chewey pierogies for 4 bucks. Preposterous. fish they use is called Bassa and it's good. But get it to go and do your sides at home. I will be back for pizza only."}
{"text":"Let me explain if you have ever had pizza here when they first opened in valley city it was amazing. The pizza now leaves a bad after taste I do not know what they are doing different but it's not working. The chefs or chef has served me and my mother rotten food two times so far, by that I mean rotten fries that  were cut from a rotting potato and deep fried and served to us. And yes my mom puked. Since this seems to be a thing there I thought I would let you guys know!"}
{"text":"Friendly younger staff who seem to hustle.. We got there around five pm and it was just picking up we had about a 25 minute wait which is what we were quoted. Had the half sheet philly cheese steak pizza and must say that it is a solid pizza for the money. Cheesy meaty and delicous. Saw many other pizzas all looking better than the next can't wait to go back for the meatball pizza! All in all this might be a top 5 pizza for me. Also much of the other food that came out looked good to."}
{"text":"My husband has been talking about wanting to go to this place for several years. We live about an hour away. We actually had a day off yesterday so we drove up to try it out. We sat outside on the porch which is really nice. We had a table of five and we each ordered something different. We had the Philly cheese pizza, chicken pot pie pizza, spinache pizza, a supreme pizza and calzones. We also got some cheesy bread and onion rings for an appetizer. It was nice because we each got a small pizza and then try to each other's. They were all amazing! Philly cheese was probably my favorite. A couple people at our table got a berry cobbler also and that was sooooo yummy! Took a while for our food to come out but they were busy so it's understandable. We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with their Philly beef steak pizza and chicken pot pie pizza. They used to have Philly beef steak egg rolls that were amazjng. Wish they would bring those back. Always great service. We never leave without buying some polish pastries.   Yummy!"}
{"text":"Great food! Great staff! Very well known place in a small community. Award winning pizza!! If you are ever in the area stop out and try it out. There will be a wait time Friday/Saturday... Still worth the wait"}
{"text":"Samosky's is known for their pizza, and I agree it is probably the best in Medina County. But I'd heard their burgers were also worthy. So, along with a couple of friends, I decided to see where I would rank them.  The menu lists 11 different burgers, so pizza is obviously not the only thing on their mind. Burgers are half-pound Black Angus and come with a choice of fries. I selected the Black and Blue, blackened with Cajun spices and covered in crumbled blue cheese for $9.99. The waitress said all burgers come well done. They also offer a veggie-burger option.  The house-made bun was large, but lacked being toasted. The burger filled the bun and more. Toasting the bun would have helped it stand up through the meal. The burger was good, but as the menu describes it as being a blackened burger it should be just that: blackened. Sear the meat! Then cook it. I suspect the burgers are oven cooked, which is why they all come out well done. That's not a problem. If the meat was seared first, establishing a delicious caramelized flavor, then baked, it would probably earn a five-star rating. As it is I can only give it three. It was good but it can be so much better.  The beer-battered steak fries were O.K., nothing special. If given a chance again I would have ordered the optional onion rings. I've seen them before and I've tasted them before and they are something to experience. Trust me on this.  I highly recommend that on the way out grab a cookie or other baked good to snack on later."}
{"text":"Get the philly cheese steak pizza. It's the greatest! Open salad bar. Not open late,  or on Sundays!"}
{"text":"Well, this place gets a lot of word of mouth business for sure. Its a nice little, slightly crowded at times place. The pizza is pretty good when you get normal toppings. BUT, if you love cheese steak then you have to get the Philly pizza. OMG .So good.  I wish I could eat it every day. But I keep it to a rare treat so I don't have a heart attack. :) great Hershey's ice cream hand scooped to."}
{"text":"This place is awesome, the Philly cheesesteak pizza is bomb, if it's a nice day out sit on the front porch and watch all the old cars and motorcycles goodbye, Great service and reasonable prices"}
{"text":"We have been there a few times.. the place is always packed, usually a long wait. But the food is so good. All fresh made. Make sure to get there an hr before you want to eat, it soooo worth the wait though. The bakery is delicious all fresh made. We always grab something sweet for later, the kids meals come with a free cookie."}
{"text":"This place is always good. Good salad bar. Good pizza. Good deserts after the meal in the bakery/ ice cream area. It's mostly award wining pizza on the menu. Spinachi is a great pizza. Not really pizza but it is so good if you want a departure from the ordinary. The crust on all the pizza is fluffy and really good. I think their dough proofs for two days from what we were told by the server.   Especially love the soups they have here with the salad bar. Seems like scratch made stuff. And they are all good."}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks ago (with co-workers) for some appetizers and 'za.  What a great surprise!  We started off by splitting an order of stuffed egg-rolls.  These babies had gooey mac-n-cheese and bacon inside, served with a creamy dipping sauce.  Mmmmm...they were good...  For our pizza we chose a more traditional pie and then a Philly Cheese-steak version (which they are supposedly known for).  So Glad we did!  The traditional pizza was good, but the Philly was totally rock-star and (if blindfolded) you'd be hard pressed to tell the flavor apart from the real thing.  The meal was great, service prompt and attentive and the prices reasonable.  We will be back."}
{"text":"When I say Valley City the last thing you'd think if is a great pizza parlor. Well, Samosky's is just that and more. A wonderful bakery, and has Hershey's Ice Cream. The family started out years ago in my old stomping grounds, Cleveland's Slavic Village. They also have a bakery in Parma Hts.      But, this gem in Medina county is someplace that you've gotta try. The pizza has won several pizza bake offs, and they have a full menu. Burgers, Ribs, wings, chicken sandwiches and so much more. They have a great kids meal which consists of a personal pizza, drink, and ice cream. Always a winner with my picky 9 year old! They have a nice patio toward the front and a huge parking lot on the side. I have to say that their new pulled pork egg rolls are AMAZING!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am surprised at all the fabulous reviews. We had never tried it before so we ordered a plain cheese (asked for extra sauce) and a specialty with sausage, spinach, cranberries, feta cheese (the spinachi--I think the site said it was an award winner).  First, the good point:  The CRUST is WONDERFUL. If they could sell dough to go, I would go buy some and put my own toppings on it and be happy. Now, for the rest:  The tomato sauce on the plain cheese pizza was boring, bland, almost institutional, and if they actually put on extra, then I would have to assume that normally there is not enough. The spinachi had \"garlic butter\" under the toppings. I misread the description and assumed there was some kind of sauce under the toppings. It needed something else because the feta, which I had worried would overwhelm the pizza, was hard to detect.  Perhaps it is better when you go there and eat in the restaurant.  Anyway, I am not planning a return visit at this juncture."}
{"text":"Clean Very friendly Staff. We live 10 minutes away we take the whole family. The pizza was very good, my daughter always orders the Philly cheesesteak pizza from here."}
{"text":"There was something terribly off with the pulled pork. Two of us at the table ordered different variations of the pulled pork.  I tasted it and said its horrible, the other girl tasted it, spat it out and gagged.  We told the waitress how bad it was and she took the plates.  We each had only one bite from the plate.  We both did eat our 7 steak fries.  The manager then came to the table and was right away nasty to us.  \"It hurts me that you said something is wrong with the pork\" she said.  Then went on and on how its her son's restaurant and how it hurts her for us to say something bad about the food.  I then asked if she had tasted the meat, she replied no. I said sometime meat does go bad and maybe that was just a bad piece.  I just wanted to let them know, since EVERYONE at the table thought the meat was spoiled or off.  The \"manager\" then said they inspect their meat by \"smelling it\".  Then just walked away.  The waitress then brought our checks.  The restaurant still charged us for the meals. They said since we did have a bit of the meat and ate the whole SEVEN fries they gave us that they had to charge us.  We weren't going to argue with the crazy lady again who \"hurts\" so we waited another 20 minutes for the waitress to take our payments. The waitress are very friendly, but extremely slow.  My water was never refilled and the one time that she asked we were waiting to pay.   The pizza I was told was good.  After tasting the bad meat, nothing tasted right so when I had one bite of pizza, it wasn't that great.  A friend said the pizza was great here, so we stopped.  She always gets the take-out and had never eaten inside either. If you want to try this place, get it to go and stick with the pizza."}
{"text":"Giving this place a 1 because I feel it should have a lower average rating.  We happened to be in Brecksville and found this place on Yelp.  Was encouraged by the 4 star rating and how people raved about the pizza.  Ordered the Supreme pizza and waited 20 minutes, so I assumed they were making the pizza from scratch.  I don't think that was true.  The pizza crust had the consistency of a soft pretzel.  There was a chemical taste to the rim of the crust that I think was a butter and garlic flavored oil that was brushed on it.  Cheese wasn't fully melted, and the whole pizza was lukewarm.  It was as if the crust was made ahead of time and the kitchen just put toppings on it and put the whole thing under a broiler.  Maybe there aren't that many restaurants in this area so people have low expectations?   Worst pizza I have ever had , I would compare it to something you would get out of a vending machine...I was actually nauseous as I walked out of the restaurant.  Sorry guys."}
{"text":"We went here for the first time last night and happened to stumble on it. The service was ok, considering how busy it was. We didn't have any silverware or napkins on the table (a no-no when you're dining with children) but other than that, we had no issues.   We ordered two pizzas and highly recommend the Philly Cheesesteak pizza. It was delicious. Good for groups and it didn't feel crowded at all. The bakery items looked delicious but we didn't get the chance to order any of them. I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"had dinner at Samosky's last night and just like before, the pizza was amazing. in fact, i think i like it better cold the next day.  Danielle had the Mad Cow's Revenge (Boneless Skinless Chicken Breast Grilled To  Perfection And Smothered In Bourbon Sauce, Covered With Bacon And Provolone Cheese) w/ fries and bbq baked beans. The beans were very good. This is definitely going to on the short list of nearby places we can go to for quick dinner."}
{"text":"WOW the best pizza I've ever hadfriends have told me about it and kinda blew it off ....however went today for lunch got there as soon as they opened (typically when any place first opens the doors there not ready to go)Samoskys  on the other hand was ready all the girls were friendly helpful and well prepared to start there daywe've been in the business for years not easy to please we're sometimes picky nothing to complain about all great"}
{"text":"Not bad. From word of mouth I've heard it's gone downhill from what it used to be. Pretty average taste and prices to me. Good for locals but wouldn't travel for."}
{"text":"Been here before and Love the pizza. Came tonight with son. The hostess who sat us gave an adult menu for my 3 year old son. I had to go up and get a kids menu. Disappointed in the kids menu  ended up splitting a pasta meal with him."}
{"text":"Wednesday night...packed...wasn't expecting that. Anyhow...we only waited about 5 mins for a table which was good. When we were seated we waited another 10 mins for a waitress to approach us. No Bueno...packed or not. We have been here before and we knew what we wanted so we placed our order right then. We ordered a large Philly Cheesesteak pizza and I added on the soup and salad bar for $2.99 more. Seems like a good value until you see the salad bar...they only offer a bagged iceberg blend and basic toppings. The actual bar was dirty and I'm pretty sure there were some health code violations. The dressings were warm...no one bothered to fill the holding tub with ice. Furthermore, how do you not have bleu cheese dressing? Anyway...the highlight of the night arrived shortly after...if this pizza wasn't so damn delicious I would be rating two stars because everything else was pretty bad. The pizza was cut...but not cut all the way through. We had to send it back to be re-cut because they only have butter knives in the dining room. Even still...it was delicious. Will probably only do takeout from now on though."}
{"text":"They have good pizza made to order.  Nice local restaurant.  Easy to find.  Friendly staff. Get there early  The place filled up very quickly.  The was a line out the door when leaving.  Very popular on a Saturday.  Try the smokehouse trio.  Calamari is excellent.  The have a good Cesar salad.  The salad bar they offer is very limited."}
{"text":"Reputation for award winning pizza. Philly cheesesteak is my Fave. Nice salad bar very inexpensive. We got veggie pie this time ..almost too many veggies. Could use more sauce. Great patio! Place was packed. Nice bakery & ice cream stand too! Prices are reasonable w/ some pies a bit high. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Delicious. We went with the two award winning pizzas: Philly cheesesteak and heartacado. Pizzas and crust  were perfect. I think my only change for next time is no guacamole on the heartacado. Hubby is looking forward to trying Hawaiian pizza next time."}
{"text":"Was out driving on a nice sunny day, drove by and decided to stop and try it.  Best decision I made, good food and service was great, as was the waitress"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've ever had. We live in Brunswick, which has like 30 pizza shops, and we'd often drive the 15-20 minutes to come out here to get this. Not too often, because it's expensive, but worth it for a special treat.  The Philly cheese steak really lives up to its award-winning hype. I have always wanted to try the Heartacado pizza, and also the Buffalo Chicken (since Buffalo Chicken is my middle name) but I can never convince anyone else that I'm with to get one of these :(. Maybe some day. Anyway, even a plain ol' pepperoni is still really good."}
{"text":"Service wasn't great, but it wasn't the worst I've ever had. A lot of the staff made us feel like an inconvenience. The onion rings had a weird soggy texture as soon as they came out to us. I would never order the calamari again either. It was awful. I've never had it like that. The pizza was pretty good. I thought the crust was probably one of the best I've ever had. Except I went to heat up the left over pizza the next day and it was so awful I took one bite and had to throw it away. I don't know what happened. The pizza definitely does not carry over well. We'll probably be back, but we'll stick to just getting a pizza and we probably won't bring any left overs home."}
{"text":"I ordered a Hawaiian Pizza that I thought would be half way decent. It had pieces of lunchmeat ham, & pineapple on it. This is not my idea of a good Hawaiian Pizza. A good Hawaiian Pizza is supposed to have cinnamon, almonds, good tomato sauce, pineapple chunks & a good crust. I do not know how they ever won the awards that they did 3 years in a row. They must have had somebody paid off to do this because their other pizzas tasted just as bad. I wouldn't order their CLAM CHOWDER ON FRIDAYS EITHER. The soup is SALTY, NO CLAMS, not your regular Clam Chowder. The cans of soup from Campbells taste better then this soup ever did. Don''t waste your time or effort on getting a pizza from this place, they are very cheap on giving you good quality food for the price that they charge you."}
{"text":"We found this place by accident and I'm sorry we don't live closer! We 've been there twice now and the service has been warm, friendly and prompt. The pizza is every bit as good as others have said, but the BBQ is outstanding! The brisket was smoky, juicy and delicious and the ribs were just as good. I'm not a fan of beans as a rule but theirs had me finishing them off. It didn't hurt that their slaw is just like my mom's. When the porch is open, it's a great place to sit. That's my one complaint. The porch wasn't open on a beautiful fall afternoon. Oh yeah, they've got a nice selection of beers to go with that BBQ. As a footnote, who puts almonds and cinnamon on hawaiian pizza? Anyway, even though Samosky's has really good pizza with great crust, if that's all you have there, you're missing some fine eating experiences. Try the egg rolls (very unusual). Eat a sandwich or burger. You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza I have ever had! The Philly cheesesteak was fantastic! The veggies all fresh sliced and the dough is freshly made! Would drive two states to have this again! Great service great food! Try the specialty pizzas! The spinachi sounds strange but it was sublime! I ordered medium and smalls... always seems to be a better crust to topping ratio... the kind of pizza I dream about and when I do I drool!"}
{"text":"Great pizza for a small town! I would def check this place out. Their specialty pizzas are award winning and rival Chicago!"}
{"text":"we went for pizza and salad bar this past weekend. Reasonable prices. Pizza was good with enough sauce and ingredients. Salad bar could use a little help though. Not too many ingredients, and not maintained. Looked dirty"}
{"text":"Very disappointed in their carry out service. Ordered a 6\" meatball sub. Waited over 30 minutes while I listened to the counter girls bash their bosses. Not a real good way to project your employer. If it takes 30 minutes for a small sub then I'll be taking my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Located in frog jump central samoskys is a interesting mix of pizza and bakery.  The pizza menu is good with nice list of toppings.  We opted for the hawaiian with loads of pineapple, however it tasted canned.  Pizza had very light sauce and for hawaiian was really good.  But the star of the meal was the calzone!  You may be told they just fold over the crust, but this can not be!  the crust was very light more thin bread and washed with butter.  The extra sauce for dipping was all gone half way thru,  order extra you will use it.  The friday crowd at 7 pm wasn't very big, and the wait staff is not rushing you thru your meal."}
{"text":"Have visited Samosky's about three times and have never had a bad experience.  Their cheesy bread is amazing, pizza is awesome and the service is always great."}
{"text":"Everything was on par, decent little salad bar. Pizza was okay, got the supreme. Nice atmosphere and good service. Nice place in Valley City."}
{"text":"We had a very large part of it out on the patio of this awesome little pizza joint. It's situated right in the bucolic downtown area and the building is got a great view of this little one street light town. We had a large party of about 20 people and our server, Ashley, happens to be one of the owners. We lucked out because she was an awesome server. Well I can't go into detail about the multitude and different pizzas that we ordered I can assure you that every Pizza that we got was different, tasty, the toppings were fresh and the pieces were unique. We learned that Jason, one of the other owners, just came back from Italy and won a worldwide Pizza competition of some sort. There's plenty of parking on site the restaurant is clean and well lit. They also have a salad bar where those of us who are trying but failing to watch our weight can justify eating a piece of pizza or two but I know I'm down on the side with salad bar. If you're ever in this area of town please give this Homestyle Pizza Joint a try as you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"By far the best pizza!  Their Philly cheesesteak pizza is amazing!!  The food is always hot and fresh when served and the staff is always really friendly.  My husband is allergic to MSG and can't eat at many places, but because everything is made from scratch with quality ingredients, he can eat here too  and loves it just as much!  Every time family comes to town we visit Samosky's with them and usually fight over leftovers:) Great place!"}
{"text":"Don't bother. santos or Barbarinos is 10 times better.  We saw the interview on channel 3 last night and decided to try it. It was just ok.  Not worth the drive.  The pastry looked good though!"}
{"text":"I'd like to thank my fellow Yelper's for recommending this place. We had a craving for pizza so we drove 45 minutes each way to pick up some pies and I'll have to say there are no regrets. The pizza party at my house contained the following:  *The Spinachi - Garlic butter sauce, sausage, spinach, sunflower seeds, cranberries, feta and asiago cheese. The garlic butter sauce really upped the tastiness of the crust. The cranberries added a nice sweetness and the sunflower seeds were a pleasant little crunch. All of the ingredients worked well in this pizza.  *Philly Cheese Steak - My favorite! Alfredo sauce, swiss-american cheese, philly steak meat, onions, green peppers (left off the mushrooms). Such a tasty pizza! No wonder they won an award for it.  *Supreme Pizza - Pretty standard toppings and taste. The crust was not as tasty as the specialty pizza's and I think it could have used a little more red sauce. A decent pizza, but no wow factor.   The pizzas are on the fluffier side with a thick crust. Overall I prefer the specials over the regular pies and at $9.99 for a small, these pizzas are very affordable. If I was passing through Valley City I would definitely get pizzas from here again! My only little disappointment was that I tried to inquire more about the pizzas (ex are the ingredients local) from the young staff and they had absolutely no idea."}
{"text":"We ordered a philly cheese steak pizza and it's  the best pizza we ever had in a long time. it is very very good pizza. The place is very clean the service is very good. We will be back."}
{"text":"Came here based on other Yelper reviews. Pleasantly surprised. Not sure what to expect in such a small town as Valley City but food was good and service was excellent. The atmosphere is casual and feels like country. Pics of hunters and their game on the wall.  My family and I tried the calamari app. It was really good and different. Comes in large strips of breaded calamari instead of small rings. I tried the recommended award winning Philly Steak pizza.  It was good. Not the best but really good.  The crust does come lightly cooked/doughy, as mentioned by other reviews, but I like that. If you don't you may want to ask them to cook longer. Ribs and Mac n Cheese were good too. Didn't try anything from bakery or ice cream bar."}
{"text":"Holy calzones!  I've heard rumors that this Valley City pizzeria is worth its weight in marinara, and I remember eating at the tiny location they used to have.. but wow!.. what a difference square footage makes!  Homey, warm and friendly are all words I would use to describe Samosky's.  And man, their pizza is good!  The menu offers an extensive list of options (including a salad bar), so everyone will be happy.  We came here on a double date last week and closed out the place.  Our server was kind and patient and kept refilling our decaf.  Family owned and operated."}
{"text":"First time there last night. I was really looking forward to going but it was also 35 miles away! The salad bar and the soup where great! The pizza was no where close to what I expected. I cannot believe this pizza won best pizza. I was totally disappointed. Fred"}
{"text":"My family drove from Florida just to try the food and it was amazing.  The owner and his family are awesome and very friendly.  The service was awesone and food unbelievably delicious!  Just wish they delivered to Florida"}
{"text":"I've been going here for years, even when they were in the old building when I was a kid. The philly-cheesesteak is still the staple, but if that's not your taste than go for the calzone or standard pizza. Sure the pizzas are maybe a tad pricier than Papa J's, but this isn't an issue unless you go the Samosky's every weekend. The bakery is above average as well."}
{"text":"Very delicious pizza! We love the cheesy bread and salads as well. Samoskys has an excellent patio and the baked goods and ice cream are to die for. I recently had the chicken pot pie pizza and it was so delicious- I just wish it had been served warmer."}
{"text":"This is by far the best pizza my wife and I have ever had. And we really like pizza. To find pizza this good in tiny Valley City is amazing. Whenever we are in the Cleveland area, we want to stop in, no matter how far out of the way it is.   Last time we were there, we got the Buffalo Chicken Pizza. The toppings and sauce were good, but it was the crust that makes this pizza. The combination of a crisp outside and a chewy inside is what all crusts should try to be. We have tried a couple of their other pizzas, with the same results.   The restaurant has a nice neighborhood atmosphere and the service is good for a neighborhood pizza place. If you are looking for fancy, you can go somewhere else, but you certainly won't find better pizza there."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. I like the Philly cheese steak. The restaurant is very clean. Would love to go there for lunch more often, but they don't offer wifi. I'd give it another star if they did that. It's part of being a modern business."}
{"text":"I've lived in Northeast Ohio for three years and one thing I've struggled to find is great pizza.  I've tried a lot of pizza places and while some are very good, none of them are great.  That is until now!  I read about Samosky's from other Yelpers because it's pretty close to my house.  Always in search of good pizza, I decided to give it a try.   This pizza is OUTSTANDING! The crust is perfect: crispy but soft, thin but not flakey and very tasty.  The toppings are huge and taste amazing.  There was a great balance between sauce and cheese and the most amazing part:  it wasn't a greasy, sloppy mess and it wasn't a dry strip of cardboard.    We also tried their BBQ Pulled Pork egg rolls because...well, I've never heard of that before so I couldn't resist.  Wow.  The crust was just a little bit on the dry side but it didn't really matter.  The pulled pork was awesome! (Another thing missing in NE Ohio is BBQ but that's for another review) The pork was juicy and packed full of flavor.  The BBQ sauce that came with it was pretty good too; a nice sweet sauce with just a tiny bit of kick in it.  This review is getting long but I have to mention the cheesy bread.  I'm not usually impressed with cheesy bread from a pizza joint but this stuff was pretty good. The bread had a great garlic flavor and the cheese was piled up all over it.  I definitely don't regret adding it to my order and look forward to having it again.  The worst part about all of this? I wasted three years of my life living in NE Ohio before finding out about Samosky's! Do not make the same mistake: stop reading Yelp reviews and go to Samosky's right now!"}
{"text":"Came here for the great reviews and lots of recommendations. The pizza was not what it was hyped to be. The sauce is very tomato flavored and acidic. The cheese is definitely from a bag and not fresh. The crust is good with a butter garlic spread.   It is a friendly atmosphere and good for a family. Price was decent and worth the salad bar."}
{"text":"Pizza is good.   The management is lax. Some of the wait staff do not know how to deal with the public.   If you order the soup/salad bar, be sure that you ask them again for the soup (if they forget to bring it to you) or you will visit the salad bar then get a bill for the full soup/salad bar and a lecture on you \"cannot take any soup to go\" if you remind them that it was not brought to you.  It was not my fault that the waitress forgot.  Samosky's should drop the soup/salad bar (but you MUST ASK for the soup) and just let people order the soup a la carte.  I concede that this is a small thing, but can ruin your experience when the waitress and manager act like you are doing something wrong when you complain about paying for something that was never brought to you."}
{"text":"When I ask a local where to eat I am rarely disappointed, We were told that Samosky's has won awards all over the world so it must be worth a try.      When we arrived around 6pm on a Saturday night I was not surprised to see the very large parking lot filled.  We were told the wait would be about 30 minutes and that is about what it was.   We started with the Caprese Salad. The salad large enough for my wife and I to share. Large slices of fresh Mozzarella layered between fresh basil and firm and fresh tomatoes, with a light drizzle of balsamic vinegar. It was very fresh tasting and a great way to start out meal.      Since we were only here for one night was decided to share a medium pizza and a rack of ribs.  The pizza had a really nice crust, somewhere between a thick and crispy crust.  It was cooked really well and held up to the ample supply of toppings.  I really enjoyed the taste of the sauce, I would love to go back for another pie again.     The ribs were a St. Louis Style Rib. The menu says that they were smoked for seven hours and you could every bit of that wonderful smoke. They were tender but not falling apart. There was a sauce on the ribs but it was pretty light so that was good.  The only down side was the frozen factory fries that the ribs were sitting on.  The Virginia vinegar based coleslaw had a delightful tang and just the right amount of spiciness.     The beer selection was not huge, but they had a couple Great Lakes brews that I had not tried before.      With that amount of food we had enough left over for lunch the next day and room for a cookie on the way out."}
{"text":"I am indeed a fan of this restaurant. I do wish they had delivery but it's only a 10min drive up the road so I suppose I'm not too lazy for that.  The pizza itself is only mildly greasy and very good. I've always preferred a regular, boring cheese pizza but I have gone for a specialty from time to time. The BBQ pit pizza was good. The BBQ sauce had a nice flavor but the onions on it were HUGE. Now, I love onions and garlic like you wouldn't believe, but they were in petals the size of my hand. My hands may be tiny, but that's not the point. Onions should be in quarter inch slivers or diced on pizza. Moving on from onions, the garlic cheesy bread was just that...garlic and cheesy goodness. I ate waaaay too many for my own good. Totally worth it!   All in all, I'm a big fan. I do however prefer the normal pizza as oppose to the specialties since, I have found, specialty pie just doesn't cure the taste for pizza. It can only be cured by red sauce, cheese, and pepperoni or sausage. If I'm ever really in the mood for a Philly cheese steak, I'll test out their award winner and see if it takes the edge off that craving."}
{"text":"We love samoskys. While they are out of the way for me, they are always worth the drive. We fell in love years ago with the philly cheesesteak pizza, but have now tried many others and love them all.  Consistent food brings us back anytime we have time to make the drive or are in the area. The staff is always friendly and accommodating.   Seating waits can be long on weekend nights so plan ahead. Love their homemade soups and they have a great salad bar when you dine in.  An homage to the original samoskys in Slavic Village  is the bakery display in the front which always has tempting tasty treats. Worth the drive."}
{"text":"Good pie - my daughter loves this place. Tough to get during peak hours but when you are this good it happens."}
{"text":"This place was really good. We ordered the Inverno which had lots of fall veggies, it was delicious!! The place is pretty large, plenty of room. I heard about the awards they've won, and my aunt and uncle raved about it. They drive 20 min to pick it up, lol. It is in a small town, but I'd say worth the drive if you are close by. They have a salad bar there, not sure if it is only at lunchtime. The staff was really friendly and nice and helpful. It was not too expensive, either. Try it, you will love it!"}
{"text":"Food and pizza are good,catsup,and mustard are free and if you like hot sauce like Tabasco they don't have any,they have their own, but you have to PAY for it. That's not a well run restaurant in my opinion."}
{"text":"Over all Samosky's pizza is to this day is some of the best I have had. Don't waste your time with the salads, but they do have a few other things on the menu that are worth while like the egg rolls. When dining in be noted that the flow of this restaurant is lacking and sometimes people seem confused as to where to stand when picking up take out, waiting to be seated, and purchasing ice cream. All in all however the pizza is well worth it and the management is very kind."}
{"text":"I had the chicken pot pie pizza it was good to go.. if you get a chance check this place out. I will be back."}
{"text":"The food here is always outstanding! My absolute favorite part is the salad bar. Hands down there is no salad bar as good as this one anywhere!!! I highly recommend the Philly cheesesteak pizza and the BBQ pit pizza! Only wish there facility was bigger so the line isn't an hour every Friday/Saturday night !"}
{"text":"We placed an order for carryout from Samosky's the other night and as a first time patron, I have some mixed reviews. We tried the spinachi pizza and it looked outstanding. The flavors were good but it was a little dry so could definitely benefit from more of the garlic butter sauce. Also, the sausage seemed a little over seasoned. We also tried the pulled pork egg rolls. They were just good as well. I have no idea if the bbq sauce was made from scratch but it was very tasty. I would think that the egg rolls would retain more crispness if they weren't packaged in a plastic container, as that locked in too much moisture. I would have liked to be a little more impressed but can safely say we will definitely be trying more of the menu items for comparison. The inside of Samosky's is a bit unclear as to where to be for what since the register, pick up, bakery section and ice cream all seem to be at the same place.  I will need to experience a little more from Samosky's for sure."}
{"text":"Went here tonight w/my kids for the first time. We only had pepperoni pizza but it was great! Definitely bringing the hubbie and heading back again soon."}
{"text":"Best pizza I have ever had. We also got the macaroni and cheese with bacon egg rolls Delicious!  Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Love this place but very concerned with this data:  Samosky's Homestyle Pizzeria, Valley City \"Samosky's Homestyle Pizzeria, 6738 Center Road, had 30 food inspection violations during the inspection year from March 1, 2016, through Feb. 28, 2017, according to Ohio Department of Health records.

{"text":"I ordered a pizza and a sample platter tonight almost 2.5 hours in advance. Upon arrival my pizza was not done, and once I did receive it it was cold and she sample plater was so poorly prepared that I couldn't tell a \"cheese stick\" from an onion ring. While waiting for my pizza I was able to witness SEVERAL inappropriate exchanges between the owner and her employees. For example, going through the register telling the nearby staff they need to pay for their meals then calling a specific employee out by name because she didn't pay although she was no where nearby. She also hastily asked another worker how a salad was prepared then embarrassed him in front of the customer because he didn't realize they were out of the ingredients required to make the salad, told him to tell the customer and then stood behind over his shoulder him as he apologized to the customer that they could not make his salad, then proceeded to interrupt him anyways. The entire staff seemed tense when she was around and her attitude is a CLEAR indication of why.    All in all, despite it being cold, the food was good but the display of customer service from the owner completely turned me off and makes me not want to give them my business."}
{"text":"I wanted to give Samosky's another chance.  After a hard day installing a water heater we headed out for dinner and ordered another large Supreme Pizza.  This time we asked for it \"more well done\"  It came out a reasonable amount browner, and the previous gum line was almost totally gone.  I enjoyed the balance of the toppings, and I have to rate the sausage excellent!  I think the extra heat in the oven enhanced the sauce profile also.  This is a very good pie, no doubt about it.  Next time, I am going to try to get it \"more well done plus a bit more\"  That should put it perfect!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been hearing good things about samosky's for at least a year. Today we finally tried it!  We had the Philly cheesesteak and spinachi - both absolutely delicious.  Well worth the drive from Macedonia!  We will definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"First off, I am a believer that there is no such thing as bad pizza. But given the choice, locally owned pizza shops that serve up a delicious slice hold a special place in my heart.  They are almost always better than the regional and national chains.  I happened on Samosky's a few years ago completely by accident and decided to give it a try.  I started with a small cheese pizza and got their specialty Philly Cheesesteak pizza.  The cheese pizza was just a taste experiment to compare to the competition.  The slightly doughy crust was delicious, the sauce tasty (without being overpowering) and the cheese delightfully gooey (without being overdone and becoming a choking hazard).  The combination of the three resulted in a perfectly balanced pizza.  The Philly Cheesesteak pizza caught my eye since it was advertised as a #1 award winning pizza at the American Pizza Championship.  The combination of a Philly cheesesteak, red onion, green pepper, and alfredo sauce cooked to perfection on Samosky's delicious crust is amazing.  I was never a fan of the specialty pizza until this one.  Absolutely top notch and refreshingly different.  Since my first visit, they moved down and across the street to a beautiful renovated building.  There is ample seating inside, with the an outdoor patio for those nicer days.  The front counter has a wide array of baked goods to choose from as well as ice cream.    A word of caution, they get very busy on Friday and Saturday nights (closed Sundays).  Expect to wait for a table.  Or just grab it to go and enjoy a slice of pizza heaven at home."}
{"text":"Wish I could give it -5 stars. Service was ridiculous. None of the girls knew what they were doing. Service was slow, and the waitress could not even get simple drink orders right. The pizza however is very good. Wish the management could get it togather. Servers need  some kind of training. Mine Did not know what was even on the menu. Spoke with the manager who was rude and very inappropriate. She looked young, but still I expect some level of professionalism."}
{"text":"One of the very few last pizza parlors around, friendly, country style atmosphere, good selection of craft beer which is important to me. The wait time is long typically on a Friday night so you want to get there pretty early because they don't do reservations. The food is served very hot & fresh and the pizza is delicious, the Philly cheesesteak is just amazing! It's pricey but you're paying for the fact that you're out to eat in a restaurant it's not your typical call in for delivery style pizza. They also offer bakery & ice cream for those late night dessert cravings or hot Summer nights. They also have a very deep menu including much more than pizza also the salad bar is a nice size and it's only $2.99."}
{"text":"This is definitely my favorite pizza place. I may be a little biased because I grew up in Valley City, but they have the awards to prove it! I highly recommend the Meat Lovers Pizza or the Philly Cheese Steak! Trust me, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. The pizza is great and much more affordable than it is anywhere. If you are ever in the frog jump capital of the world, be sure to stop by for a slice of pie at this valley city favorite.  They usually have great specials throughout the week so be sure to ask about them when you call."}
{"text":"One word.  Desserts!  This place does have great good and great pizza, but the desserts are out of this world!  Make sure to stop by the bakery display case and take something home!  I recommend the Buckeye Bar."}
