{"text":"Yuck - nice sized, funny tasting rolls, weird soup and diner like seating.  Definitely a westernized version of a Vietnamese restaurant.  Very busy with locals.  Wish I would have went to the Chinese restaurant at the end of the strip mall."}
{"text":"Always hot fresh flavourful food. The decor is tired and drab but the seating is comfortable and the service is friendly and efficient. I've eaten their 100 times and the food is very consistent. I always have the \"C\" 2 skewers one of beef and one of chicken. Comes with starter soup, imperial roll and choice of vermicelli or rice. You can also bring your own wine!!!!"}
