{"text":"Saw a dog in the backyard near the smoker and in the kitchen area and right away stopped eating my food . Food quality is bad and servers seemed to be drinking on the job and messed up my order. Not recommend"}
{"text":"Tried this lively restaurant and were sadly disappointed. The menu and specials board drew us in and the waitress seemed nice but when we showed her a yelp deal for $5off ribs, she had no clue, she said she would ask her boss but then didn't tell us until later when we were eating that the deal was so old and that they were not honouring it even though it is still on yelp. Shouldn't they honour it and then take it down? .The patio seemed cozy and nice and had couples, friends and even young family but the crowd started changing to noisy groups of people which would have been ok but they would get up and down and talk to other tables and were just really loud and obnoxious. The food was alright, not the best so probably wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"Great BBQ. Great atmosphere.  Renovations are great.  Super friendly staff.  Did I mention great BBQ?!"}
{"text":"The food was actually decent in quality but ordered their delivery and it took nearly two hours to arrive. Was ice cold. Wings were good, but for $14, there was only six in the order. SIX! Huge rip-off, won't be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"It saddens me to see so many bad reviews on here! I come here very often to eat and have never had a bad meal or experience. Pastas, pulled pork, calimari, and baked brie (to name a few) are all super yummy and the portions are massive for the price. Definitely worth trying if you're in the beach, I'd say best \"bar\" food on queen right now!"}
{"text":"I found the food very tasteless and the meat dry as a wood chip. It's a small establishment, unless it's summer and you get to sit outside, and rather musky smelling. I also didn't like the way the manager was acting towards the waitresses. But I did give it one star."}
{"text":"I usually come here with friends. It is a 2 floor sports bar which contains fooseball or pool. They have a large selection on the menu and I would have to say their daily meals are large portions and good enough to take home. They have a couple of tvs and serve beer. I think is a fun place if you just want to kick it and hang with a couple friends. It's a great area to be in especially when you're exploring around during nice weathers."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery twice. It's a bit expensive but servings are generous so you get your money's worth. The farfalle is delicious. I normally hate sundried tomatoes but they're bomb. Reminds me of the only good dish at Cheesecake Factory, Cajun chicken with bow tie pasta, that they took off the menu years ago so I haven't gone back.  The ribs were good and my toddler love them. Forgot what else I had the last time but i think one thing was poutine and it was really good.  Cobb salad is fire."}
{"text":"Pub food prices for massive portions of BBQ seems like a golden recipe.  Overall, the quality of the BBQ was alright.  Nothing memorable or worth coming back for (except if I have a serious craving for BBQ and can't find anything else).  The brisket was tasty but there was something missing.  I couldn't quite put my finger on it.  Everyone at the table seemed to enjoy their food, but it didn't appear anyone was wowed by it.  The best surprise was the fries under the brisket that had brisket fat dripping on them.  Required excessive self-control not to gorge on those.  If I was in a mood to go all out, the brisket poutine on the menu was also extremely tempting, but I've heard other places in TO do that too, so I might give one of those a shot."}
{"text":"You have good portion sizes here and good pub grub, definitely more of a place you go to for drink deals because they have everyday specials. It is better to go in summertime because they have a big front patio but in winter they have a nice lounge on second floor. Not a good spot for wine drinkers but for mixed drinks and beers it's one of the gems of the beaches. I go there a ton with my bf and sometimes they do mess up our order but when they do they gave us our meal for free which was great and the meal was still great so no complaints here!"}
{"text":"Regardless of what you order you will be impressed with the food and drinks at Breakwall. My favourite meals are the Farfalle pasta, Breakwall Cobb salad, pulled pork quesadilla and the mussels. The meals are served with fresh cut fries and/ or a fresh salad with amazing homemade dressings. The place is clean and has a great patio for their extensive list of blended cocktails- all of which come with fresh fruit. I would thoroughly recommend Breakwall to anyone looking for a great meal, a cold bevy or both. Make sure to check out their daily specials board because they always have hot deals."}
{"text":"Have eaten here many times and only once was I a bit disappointed with a BBQ meat dish being a bit dry, but otherwise the ribs and chicken are very good. The salads in particular are wonderful - huge portions and very tasty. My husband enjoys the sandwiches and pasta. Kids menu is great, and again very good sized portions. Sometimes the food takes a while but in general we are very happy with this place. Definitely the best pub food in the Beach."}
{"text":"I must have come on a bad weekend afternoon because the service was off and the brisket sandwich left a lot to be desired. Why did I order something I cook at home. Which I cook much better than what I paid for here!  I ordered roasted potatoes and house salad to accompany the sandwich and a Mill street beer. A while back later, the server returned to tell me they didn't have that beer. I asked her what do you recommend that's similar. She told me she didn't know about beer. Great. Neither do I! A better answer would have been, let me inquire with the bartender and I'll get back to you.   A while back later, she returned to tell me they didn't have roasted potatoes! What a comedy of errors!  Oh, and I can't fault her for not checking with the bartender because she was working the bar too!.  I do have a yelp check-in offer so I guess that means I am destined to return."}
{"text":"Holy meat coma!  3 of us sat down for the big platter.  Heavy on the pulled pork, light on the ribs.  Just right on the brisket.  The grilled veggies side look but i didn't really stray from the fatty yummy meat.  Good lord tasty."}
{"text":"They didn't accepted the coupon from Yelp. The waitress said that this was like 3 years old and would not accept the $5 off my ribs. Also they charged extra for another BBQ sauce... who does that on a BBQ place?!?  Terrible experience."}
{"text":"What caught my eye was the really the large fake palm tree out front. On a nice summer day, the front patio is the perfect place to people watch as you cool off with a drink (there were some interesting patrons from the neighborhood). They have the usual pub food and beer options, so no surprises from the menu. I had a wrap which was a great lunch option, especially with a pitcher of beer to wash it down with. Even though it was a busy weekend, the service was obviously working hard to keep up and our server she was friendly when she was with us. A good choice when in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Went there for a late night meal and was shocked at how good the ribs were.  They were smoked to perfection and finished off perfectly.  Coleslaw was fresh and crunchy and the beans were really good.  All in all, a fantastic meal for a great price.  Shane the owner was super friendly and explained his technique.  I will be back earlier to experience more of the menu."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. It's our go-to restaurant for weekly Friday lunches. I'm especially fond of the Mussels Fridays. The menu offers tomato or cream options. I always request the ros√© sauce, for the best of both worlds. Their fries, whether regular or sweet potato are fresh cut, crisp and hot. Delish!  A group of 6 ate dinner here this past Friday evening. Good thing we had made a reservation as the place was hopping. Our party tried various dishes such as mussels, brisket sandwich and pulled pork. All were declared as delicious.   That evening's dessert was a chocolate lava cake with ice cream. Wow! Service was friendly and efficient as always!   Our out of town guests were most impressed and we were delighted as usual."}
{"text":"A fairly chill hangout spot in the beaches area. Food rating varies depending on what you order and how busy their kitchen is. The one time I was there, service was so slow. Prices aren't cheap but not going to break your piggy bank either. Mojito was solid $6 and strong but portion was small. Their pulled pork nacho is enough to share with 5 and was really tasty. Ribs are hit and miss with a lot of smoke flavour. Food portions are huge so be hungry!"}
{"text":"I can see how this place would be hit and miss. We had great service though. Our server told us to stick with the BBQ items because that's their specialty- so we did.  Pulled pork sandwich was great! I planned to only eat half but couldn't stop. Good meat to bun ratio, also great bun choice. Good fries. On the menu I thought it said all BBQ items come with coleslaw and fries, so when it came with mixed greens topped with mango, blueberries, strawberries and loaded with a sweet dressing I was disappointed. Im really not a \"fruit in my salad\" type of person though. Also they didn't serve with hot sauce.  I'd say steer clear of the salads but I'd be happy to eat that pulled pork again!  Nachos were also good. My friends got the farfalle and said it was tasty."}
