{"text":"Never met a fry I did not like.........until now. Ordered the fries with cheese and bacon. Old limp cold fries with cheese wiz and bacon bits. Not to mention the stiff price of $7. 

The boneless wings were obviously pre-frozen. Sauce was very very light. No real passion for food at this place. Bland. Obviously lazy food prep as they did not even make sure the boneless wings were properly tossed so that sauce had even coverage. Took them outbid the fryer, placed in a basket and dumped a little sauce on them, and served. No pride or passion for what they are serving."}
{"text":"The food tasted good, but the price went up and the size of the wings are tiny!! They remind me of pigeon wings. The service was ok. It did take a long time to get the tiny pigeon wings. 
 I wouldn't recommend this place until the wings return to the normal.size"}
{"text":"Before I get into this review, I will say that I have been to the Wing Warehouse in Cuyahoga Falls many times and never had a bad experience.  The Broadview Heights location is just not on the same level as the one in Cuyahoga Falls.

The wait staff was okay, nothing spectacular.  After a friend had spilled her drink, the waitress had noticed and went to get a rag to clean it up.  Took over 20 minutes for her to come back to the table and did not have a rag in hand.  Probably just forgot, honest mistake.

Food took longer than expected, but there was also a large party there as well, so I do not fault the kitchen for that.  The food was okay, but as I mentioned earlier, the Cuyahoga Falls location does a much better job.

Overall, it is not a bad place to go to get wings.  I just had a higher expectation based on previous experiences at their other restaurant."}
{"text":"This is an example of a great spot with bad management. When it was bw3's, this place was bumping but not the case anymore. For some reason nobody ever knows how to work the TVs.. The service is terrible, with seemingly 2 people ever working. All the employees seem like they really don't care and have that \"I'll get to it when I get to you it attitude\". 

Fortunately the food still is good, so you have to decide if the food is worth the bad service and being ignored."}
{"text":"As an update we gave WW another chance and it was enjoyable. Food was tasty and well prepared.
The water which was such an issue tasted like water.

We will give them more business if this keeps up next time.
Great job WW in getting what looks to be a new staff and management team, they are doing a nice job."}
{"text":"The name of this establishment is \"Wing warehouse\" that leads me to my first question..... Why do their wings suck so freaking bad? They are the epitome of irony. I've given this place more than one chance to impress me an it has failed everytime. The wings taste plain. There is a few bartenders here that are nice and the drinks are cheap so thats the only reason to ever come. Sad to say they have some new bartenders here that suck. Over all this place is the bottom of the barrell. If you want good wings do your self a favor and go to the winking lizard right in Macedonia"}
{"text":"Went there over the weekend the band was great and the service was great had a really great time!!  The drinks were inexpensive and the food was reasonably priced.  I would definitely go there again!!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible! We were the only people here for lunch and waited 45 minutes to eat rubber chicken. I will never come back.."}
{"text":"This food is absolutely horrible, it was cold and took forever to receive it. The waitress could care less. Do not go here!!"}
{"text":"This place is really comfortable.  It is not flashy like a chain, but it is friendly and has good food. On wing night, you can still get them the way you, the customer, wants them - unlike BW3. 

The only complaint is the bartenders talk too much. They talk to each other and customers. Not just to be friendly...they camp out and ignore the other customers.  One waitress apologized so many times for forgetting stuff, it was embarrassing. She even said she talks too much.  

Other than that, very nice place."}
{"text":"We went to wing warehouse in Broadview Heights to watch the football game. All of the tables were reserved, except for three back in the corner which we had to take. Our waitress was also the bartender, so you know how well that worked out. We got there early before the crowd had arrived, and it still took 45 minutes to get our order. And that was after we went to the kitchen and asked if our order was ready yet. When it did finally come, it was cold. You could tell the wings had been sitting for a while. The waitress /bartender only came back once to check on us. After asking twice for our check and not getting it, we finally went to the cashier to pay our bill, and, after explaining we hadn't gotten it, the cashier said we couldn't pay here we'd have to go back to the bar. We then talked to the manager about our complaints and she offered us a gift certificate,  which we declined. We will NEVER go back there."}
{"text":"Worst food and service in the Cleveland area.  It was like going to Dicks in the flats... But the staff genuinely meant to be difficult/nasty.  I ordered a grilled chicken dish with baked potato, the baked potato had been over microwaved and was hard as hell.  Took 45 mins to get our food way too long.  Lastly one of the servers boyfriends came by us and made us feel totally uncomfortable as she egged him on.  If restaurants could get razzie awards, I would nominate this one.  Hope it closes soon!"}
{"text":"I've been to other Wing Warehouse locations and thought this would be the same. Wrong. The water tastes funny (not sure how because I live in the area and never had an issue,) the food was really salty and just tasted \"off.\" I couldn't put my finger on what the issue was exactly, but I definitely couldn't finish my meal. I went at lunch time and there was only one other person there besides my husband and myself. If you want wings, find another location."}
{"text":"Very large selection of sandwiches, hotdogs and appetizers. The prices are fair and the portions are large.  I usually get the order to go because it is a sports bar and I got kids."}
{"text":"Sunday Funday.............

Well I gave this place another shot.......It really surprises me how few people are here all the time..  That is the first hint.  Only time this place is packed is on Band night.

As for the food I tried the New Yorker........Actually a pretty good sandwich and I was happy.......A few beers and a good sandwich maybe 20 people in the bar it was a good Sunday.........Not my favorite hang out but it so could be with some improvements.

I am still a huge fan of the Mojave Ranch Sauce but this place just isn't the same......."}
{"text":"We came here on a Sunday, and even though it was Browns game day, there were only two servers working the entire dining room. We always give the benefit of the doubt when it comes to food service, since my husband and I both have experience working in food service, but our experience here today was atrocious. We were never asked about refills on our soft drinks, we were never once checked on after our food came (mine was missing a sauce side), the server accidentally stuck her finger in my water without replacing it, and we had to get up from our table TWICE and ask for our check. The second time, I was ignored when I went up to the bar. The food was average, but the service was horrible. This was not our first time there, but it was our last."}
{"text":"Terrible service! Food was just okay, but if I could rate the service negative, I would. The manager and server were both terrible! I will never give there again, even if it were my birthday like tonight was..."}
{"text":"After a long bike ride, we decided to stop into Wing Warehouse for some food.  We sat in the back patio area. Nobody was out there and we didn't even know if they were open.  After about 5 minutes, one of us went inside to grab a server. After 3 confused employees popped out awkwardly to check on us, our server finally came.  She took our drink orders and said she would be back in a few for the food orders.  20 minutes later, we ordered our food.  We also ordered pitchers of drinks since ours were all empty. After nearly 45 minutes of thinking they forgot about us our food came out.  All of the food was cold, and the server did not bring any more drinks, but she said she'd run right in for them.  Another 20 minutes later, we actually went inside to get our own drinks, which still didn't come because they \"thought we were joking.\"  Pretty rough experience, but the worst part is 16 hours later I am incredibly sick with horrible stomach pains, plus more...  I'm sure you can imagine the rest.  I'd rather risk dying on the hour ride home from not eating all day than eat here again. Very disappointing service."}
{"text":"Hey! I recently just moved away from this place and miss it terribly! Great people and great service! The food and drinks are a bit pricey but it is worth it for the atmosphere! All the bartenders are extremley friendly but if i had to recommend two it would be Brittany (B) and Zoey!! Food kicks butt!"}
{"text":"I waited 20 minutes for a BUD LIGHT! which mind you is not a difficult beer to get! Than waited another 30 minutes for a menu when i asked if i could get a menu i was told \" dont be so impatient we have things going on\" where were 4 old man in the bar two of which were about to fight!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are regulars there, we go there, to this location, at least once a week. Some waitresses even recognize us. But, we went there today, and weren't even acknowledged by the wait staff when we walked in. We seated ourselves as we usually do, and we sat in the same section as usual as well, and waited patiently for our drink order to be taken. After three waiters/ waitresses attended the tables around us while not even acknowledging that we were at a close by table and ten minutes had gone by without even being greeted, acknowledged, or having our drink orders taken we left the restaurant. We then decided to try a different location because the fifty cent wings still sounded good. We ended up going to the Cuyahoga Falls location on Wyoga (forgive my spelling) Lake Rd. There we were waited on nearly immediately after we were seated. The wait staff was very nice, considerate, checked on us very often, and the food was delicious. Even better than the food we usually receive at the other location. I would definately recommend this location over the other without a doubt. Their wait staff was great and the food was awesome. Two thumbs up for the Cuyahoga Falls location!"}
{"text":"Don't mean to pile on but really you work hard for your money,  why spend it somewhere that doesn't work hard for you.   I'm not a clean freak at all but this place really needs a thorough cleaning...I can't imagine how dirty the areas we can't see are.   Service,  our gal was pleasant enough but it shouldn't take 45 minutes to get some wings when the place isn't that crowded.  And then not to return once to see if you need anything and you have to track her down to get the check....In conclusion there is really is no compelling reason to spend your $$ or time here when there are so many other better options available."}
{"text":"Ok, the wings are Meh.  But the atmosphere is a lot of fun.  Good burgers. Awesome specials.  Can't beat the drink special on Thursday night.  $1 beers til 9!!!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place. I really do. Been here 3 times since it opened and it's the same every time. 

Slow service, slow food prep times and marginal food. 
When I got here tonight there was 8, count em 8, people in the restaurant. (including people just drinking at the bar)  It took 20 minutes to get a kids hotdog and applesauce. 

My burger came out 30 seconds after the hotdog (which I said could come out when it was ready). The Cajun burger was so salty I could barely finish it. 

There are 3,300 restaurants within a 15 mile radius of this place. How many opportunities should a restaurant get/deserve with a saturation like this?"}
{"text":"We live right around the corner and we love it here. The food is always good and the people are nice. What else can you ask for?!?"}
{"text":"By far one of the worst experiences I have ever had. If I could give a lower rank I would Wings were terrible over cooked Ruben was sooo greasy, never received my onion rings. The fries were over cooked. My son had hair in his salad and the couldn't replace the salad because the ran out of \"salad stuff\". Absolutely the worst! Stay away! Finds somewhere else to eat."}
{"text":"If you are craving wings for lunch, there's nothing wrong with this place. The wings were pretty good, I ordered the medium but they ended up not having much of a kick to them so I got a side of their hot sauce and it made them pretty yummy. I liked how they are naked and not breaded. Not the BEST wings I have ever had, but they pass the test. That being said, we were the ONLY table in there the entire time we ate, which made it pretty creepy and dull. I looked over and saw a huge mess of crumbs on one of the nearby tables and the place just was not very clean AT ALL. For not having any customers, there was just no excuse to not be sparking clean. All the curtains were down too which made it unnecessarily dark. Mediocre."}
{"text":"This place is great. Very relaxed, inexpensive drinks and food, awesome beer selection, and a very experienced and personable staff makes this a regular stop for me. The wings are awesome, and the sauce selection is huge, not to mention, tasty. And in reference to the prior review, you always seat yourself at this restaurant- it's very obviously casual and from the moment you walk in, you know you don't wait to be sat. Also, it's a bar, so people will be drinking a lot on the weekend. Duh. LoL.  

In the end, what keeps me coming back is the staff! My favorite bartenders ever!"}
{"text":"My friends and I paid our first visit to Wing Warehouse a couple weeks ago. The 40cent wings deal is what incited the urge to take this trip. 
Wing Warehouse is located in the Fishcreek plaza, near Stow.

Pros:The food is reasonable priced ($0.40 Wings on Wednesdays, cant beat that!)
I have only had the wings and the flavours are not only unique but give you a feel that there is something for almost everyone.
Close competition to Buffalo Wild Wings for sure.

Cons: The service isn't the best. It takes forever for the food to come out. Asked one of the servers how a particular flavour of wings would taste and all they could respond to us what with \"I have never tried that before.\" for atleast 5 different flavors. 

Will I go there again?? For $0.40 wings...YES!"}
{"text":"The food here is usually extremely good, however it can be a hit or miss with what you order sometimes. 

Only problem is that when ordering carry out the order ALWAYS is wrong. I've placed at least a dozen carry out orders and it's ranged from forgetting an entire appetizer to something smaller like dip for chips.

Can't complain with the food, just recommend checking your order before walking out with carry out."}
{"text":"I have gone to this restaurant 3 times in the last few months.  The service is soooo bad.  You have to get your own napkins, flag someone down for another beer, ask them bring the ranch for the wings that you specifically asked for when ordering, and NO ONE will clean off your table when your done eating AND We had to walk up to the bar for the check!   I mean come on!!!   It's a beautiful location, great atmosphere BUT THE SERVICE IS DESPICABLE!   I wish I could buy it.  I'd definitely turn that place into a gold mine!"}
{"text":"The food is wonderful!!! BUT anything that is not from bottle or draft barely has any alcohol in it. On 3 different occasions this happened to me. I even ordered an extra shot to add to my drink and it's the smallest shot i ever paid for...."}
{"text":"The food is good and the layout is nice with all the TVs for sports fans.  I like that they have a pool and darts area, but it was bit crowded if both are going on at once.  The service here is the worst.  The people who work there are pretty clearly uninterested in serving you and they don't hide it.  I will never be back."}
{"text":"I paided with my visa giftcard and then they charged me the wrong amount so I had to pay again and the lady said I woujd get the money back on my card, then later on I went to chipotle and paid and they said I only had 2$ left on it when I should have had 15$, very unpleasant place and the service is horrible and they have average food, woujd not recommend"}
{"text":"The food here is GREAT. But the service is TERRIBLE. It is always empty, but it still takes half an hour to even order. They're lucky the food is so good because sometimes the service is so bad I want to leave."}
{"text":"I am a wing fanatic. This place can cook some wings! Ordered some with the Cajun dry rub. Stunning quality, cooked crispy and dusted with a really spicy Cajun concoction. Wings need just the right amount of crispness. They should never be watery, greasy, or rubbery. These people know what they are doing. Would have been a perfect score had they come out a little faster. 

The place by the way is huuuge! Looked more like an event center. They must be doing well to heat the place up in winter. Nice location close to the casino, easy to get to and great parking."}
{"text":"I tried the honey garlic butter, garlic Parmesan, teriyaki, and barbecue hot wings. They all were quite delicious and I was very pleased, but both of the garlic varieties were especially PHENOMENAL. The honey garlic butter was something unusual that turned out to be genius. I also ordered the sweet potato fries and got them with a spicy ranch type sauce because I like that combo best. The seasoning on the fries complimented the flavors of the sweet potato so well I think I forgot to breath and inhaled them all."}
{"text":"There's a part of me that finds humor and appreciation in the terribly bad things in life. I get kicks out of seeing horrible movies (The Room and Troll 2). I think there's a place in the world for avant-garde music and modern art. If nothing more than to shake the seriousness from everyday life. I think a sense of humor is important part of survival in this world. Too many people are too tightly wound these days. Too many people demand perfection from every aspect of life and lose sight as to what is really important: having fun and sometimes, just getting by to live another day.  

It is with that sentiment that I find appreciation in the train wreck that is, The Wing Warehouse. 

This bar is located in a baron strip mall along Northfield Road, which by the way is one of the ugliest strips of 2 mile land that I've ever seen outside of some of the most rundown/hillbilly areas of Stark County. The location is a foreshadowing of the bar itself. Wing Warehouse is basically a low-rent, Section 8 version of a Buffalo Wild Wings. 

Its recession friendly prices, proximity to multiple sleazy motels and the ever diminishing racetrack/casino attract a different sort of clientele; scoundrels, day time drunks, gabling degenerates and lost souls. For $5, you can get a 24oz domestic along with a gigantic burger and side of fries.  That my friends is value. 

The bar itself is the oddest shape I've ever seen and whoever designed it must've been on acid. Most bars are designed in the shape of a horseshoe, semi-circle or even in a straight line. Not the Wing Warehouse. It's a multi-leveled, multi-sided bar. Think of a concave polygon figure. It's as if a 3 year old was the architect who was given a crayon and his scribble was the blueprint to the bar. While the bar is absolutely humongous, there's no more than 3 seats directly next to each other. It's a very odd design. 

This isn't a place to order a mixed drink. If you do, you'll probably be called a fag. (I'm not kidding). Order a beer. Or a shot of straight liquor. Or both. There are at least 30 drafts to chose from. 28 of them are domestics. 25 of them are Miller or Bud products. 5 Bud Light taps and 5 Miller Light taps. Nothing fancy here. It's a place to drink copious amounts of booze and get your buzz on in the least expensive way possible. 

The jukebox plays the most God awful new age mainstream depressing country music that you could imagine. Every song has the same lyrics about either breaking up with your girl or your favorite pick-em-up truck finally kicking the bucket. Both apparently are hell. After a few drinks I want to blow my brains out. It's that f*n depressing. 

As for the help, I actually dig the daytime bartender. She's a 30 something year-old divorcée who takes no shit from any of the rude, vulgar and chauvinistic pigs that enter that bar. I give her a lot of credit. She takes a lot of shit, but she gives it right back. She's one tough broad and I like that about her. 

As terrible as Wing Warehouse is, overall, I don't mind it. It's an absolute train wreck of a place, but maybe that's what makes it fun and interesting? Or maybe I just feel bad for it? Either way, I always enjoy myself here."}
{"text":"My family and I came to eat here one day and we waited 5 min and no one sat us. So we decided to seat ourselves and waited another 10 min and no one came. They were no busy either. Maybe 5 other patrons sitting around. Anyway I ordered on the phone and then quickly got my order. Wings are amazing. However I wouldn't suggest going on a weekend as its busy and full of drunks"}
{"text":"There is definitely a sports bar here, but there is also a family-friendly side with booths where you can enjoy your meal without feeling like you are sitting in a bar. The service was great and the wings were as expected, a good place to get some wings and beer."}
{"text":"The establishment now known as Dax's. Seriously, this place needs to get their shit together. You walk in at it smells like sewer gas. We requested from the bartenders quarters at the bar and they were out of them. It took 10 minutes for us to get out beer order while sitting at the table. 

We ordered Mozzarella sticks and they only had three left. We are sitting here for 15 minutes and our food still has not hit our table. The cook in the back kitchen has a beard and it is not covered. I hope that there is no hair in my food if it ever comes out. 

Jon Taffer from Bar Rescue needs to make a visit to this place very soon. I can understand if your bar is packed with people, but the bar is 50 percent packed. Total failure in management!!"}
{"text":"I have been at this establishment twice in the last month to see the band Custard Pie. I dine out on a very frequent basis. Here are some of my observations. There is zero eye contact from the bartenders. Zero! I should not have to wave to order a drink. Focus on customer service! It costs zero money. 

One of the bartenders slipped on the floor and fell hard and hit her head. I did not see a supervisor or manager check on the employee. I asked her if she was okay and if she required medical attention. She said no. Where are the walk off mats behind the bar? The safety and security of your associates should be a very important factor. Someone finally brought one walk off may to the bar and they place a cardboard box on the floor. 

The floors on the side hallways are slippery as well. Someone needs to address what floor cleaner is being utilized on the floors and behind the bar. 

I orders wings on my last two visits. It took 30 and the second time 40 minutes to receive my order. I did not see many food orders coming out to the dining room. Who is managing the kitchen operations. It shouldn't take that long to fry and sauce wings. 

A kitchen associate came out to the bar to empty the trash. However, he did not pick up the garbage that didn't make it into the trash can. Why didn't he or the bartenders pick up the garbage. Please see the pictures. The reason is that they don't take pride in their job or the establishment. Someone needs to come in and clean up this restaurant. Managment and ownership needs to address these issues ASAP!"}
{"text":"Eight Pepper Burger and fries were good, hot, well presented. Service is slow but reasonably friendly. Plenty of TVs for sports, some HD, some old CRTs. Decent beer selection and specials, but I found the glass smaller than expected. Smooth out the pace of service would be my main suggestion. Sort of surprised it didn't improve since my last visit in 2012."}
{"text":"This Wing Warehouse is the old B Dub's right off Wallings, and when you walk in you can immediately tell because it's the same set up and decor that used to adorn the joint. 

I went with my co-workers for lunch and after reading the reviews of this and other Wing Warehouse locations I was really hesitant. I got the side salad and an order of dry rub Caribbean Jerk wings. The salad was comparable to a pizza joint salad so nothing special there, but the wings were pretty darn good. There are better wing joints much closer to my house and I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to go here, so I can't say I'll return any time soon - but all in all not bad.

One thing I will say is that this place is DIRTY. The tables are dirty, the ground visibly has crumbs and debris all over it. We went shortly after opening, and were the only table there the entire time so this was pretty unacceptable."}
{"text":"Service was slow, wings dry and the waitress never came back to ask me if I want another drink or clear the table.  Haven't seen the check I could walk out but I won't.  Oh and the ladies bathroom is so disgusting I would rather go in the woods"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised how nice a place such as a casual wings diner is! They had Angry Orchard cider on tap, boneless wings and fried banana peppers-never seen them before~ Was so yummy and a nice bartender served us. Chitchatted a bit and was clean and quiet place to enjoy the weekend. My sister and I might stop in next summer if she feels a craving for wings :)"}
{"text":"I know some of the reviews aren't the greatest on here, but I've never really had a bad experience. I've stuck with just beer and wings, and always come away happy. 

I personally think the wings are the best around. They're large, and a little extra crispy, which is the way I prefer them. I'm no fan of rubbery wings, and. I've never experienced that here. They have so many good flavors to choose from too. My favorites are Wet-N-Wild and Caribbean Mama Cajun. 

Our service has always been perfectly fine. I usually get the one dude that works there a lot, and he's always great."}
{"text":"Only one waitress working the entire restaurant. Pulled pork came out lukewarm and had a weird texture. Fries were good."}
{"text":"Wings are so so.
Plus the service is extremly slow.
On a slow day - 8 people were there, it took 1-1/2 hrs to get one order of 12 wings.
I was not happy."}
{"text":"This place stinks. Waited a long time for drinks and food. Bartender was more interested about talking to his friend then giving us any kind of sevice. Had to beg for refills.

Do yourself a favor and avoid this place."}
{"text":"This place is making me dizzy. However, they deserve the additional two stars as the the last few times we've been it's MUCH better. 

Roll of the dice people, roll of the dice..."}
{"text":"This Wing Warehouse is a former BW-3's with the same decor, but without the customers.   Service was extremely slow since they only had one server, one bartender, and one noticeable cook.  We arrived at 7 p.m. on a Monday night, but didn't get out until 8:30 and all we had were one appetizer (nachos and cheese, served cold) and our dinners.  We waited endlessly for drink or beer refills, and my side dish of french fries arrived a good ten minutes after our dinners came out.  

I felt sorry for the one server who waited on every table and never got a break.  The bartender, on the other hand, had plenty of time to continuously read his phone and watch the baseball game most of the time we were there.  Het poured my beer and I watched it sit at the server station for at least ten minutes until the server remembered it."}
{"text":"This place should shut down! We went to watch the nba final game and all but one projector was out. The waiter told us they cost $1000 to fix so there were no plans to do so. 
Our waiters eyes were bloodshot and she kept disappearing. Food piled up on tables and could barely get her to come from the back to pay our bill. 
The food is just bad. Fries are soggy and they must use cheez wiz to top them. Wings are not fresh and sauce is bland. It I almost as if they can not afford to be open. We should have known better because the parking lot is never full. Even during finals week not even half the tables are full. I will never go here again. Do yourself a favor, and skip this place."}
{"text":"Service is extremely slow!! Like painfully slow. Food is mediocre at best. I don't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Stopped in to Wing Warehouse in Broadview Heights the other night for some drinks and laughs with friends and family.  When we walked in, the Kentucky vs Wisconsin mens' NCAA basketball game was on.  I figured the place would be packed, but it wasn't.  In fact, it was nearly empty.  That was not a good omen.

So we grabbed a table and ordered some drinks.  The waitress took a little while to take the order, but the drinks were served pretty quickly.  Eventually, we ordered some wings and appetizers.  A little while later, most of the wings were delivered, with the exception of mine.  I ordered 6 BBQ wings and 6 spicy wings, but the waitress only brought me 3 BBQ wings and 3 spicy wings.  She said the others would be out shortly.  That was one of the weirdest interactions I've ever had.  I had to keep myself from laughing.  The wings were tasty, plump, and hot.  I really liked them.  10 minutes later my other 6 wings were delivered and we quickly made them disappear.  The waitress was nice, but always in a hurry to leave our table before a) getting all the drinks refilled, and b) asking if we wanted anything else.  She would quietly ask one person, do you need anything and then she would quickly walk away without asking the others.  So we had to kind of chase her and get her attention for the rest at the table.

The service could use some touching up.  There are so many restaurants hitting it out of the park these days that I do not need to waste time at places that just don't try hard...like this place."}
{"text":"Awful, tasteless, horrible!!! If there's an open space in the English dictionary for disgusting then this restaurant would be the picture next t that word. I got their potato pierogies  & you could tell that the potato inside was made of instant mashed potatoes and not fresh, just had that awful frozen taste that freezer foods often do. And the \"fresh\" cut french fries were also frozen, I didn't even eat them just pitched them in the trash- probably where they came from in the first place. 
My fiance got their spinach dip which I sampled & it was equally as disturbing. Like someone opened a bag of spinach leaves & dumped mayo on it. There leaves were just that- leaves, not chopped or blended into smaller pieces; just giant leaves in snot looking sauce. 

NEVER AGAIN!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This  my favorite wing warehouse. Great service every time I visit. Friendly and makes you feel at home as soon as you walk in.

The $5.00 lunch specials are the best in the area. 

Just ask yvonne what she recommends. She will take great care of you."}
{"text":"The restaurant was dirty, floor sticky and smelled like a Chuck e Cheese. There were no tables (Cavs game was on) but once we did get a table, it was a very uncomfortable seat. 
THe food (which was chicken wings, by the way) was not good. It wasn't terrible,  but it was desperately lacking flavor and was not prepared with any skill at all. May as well have been frozen, reheated food. 
Our server was confused, overwhelmed and couldn't focus long enough to listen. 
It was a pretty bad experience and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Its an ok place to have a drink and chill but its never my first choice they need to up date their menu and down size it a bit. Also they need to cater to and older clientel and not just kids, its kind of weird seeing little kids running around when you're having a drink."}
{"text":"Went last night for dinner.  Comfortable atmosphere, decent bar food and a large selection of draft beer.  And the waitress was quick with service and friendly.  A good place to go on the cheap."}
{"text":"in the mood for wings. our waitress brought over menus and said 2 weeks old a lot of new items and said the blue cheese is homemade.  also said the beer..domestic is $1.00  what??? My Husband ordered wings and requested crispy she said they Cook fresh would be 20 min and he said that's fine.  then I ordered a small salad and was enough for both of us and ordered Mac n Cheese. when brought that out the pasta was cold and thought if mixed it would be warm  nope. told the waitress and she appologize and would correct and .. the cook came out and apologized and gave whole new dinner and brought out a crystallized waffle and ice cream treat with chocolate sauce and homemade whipped cream.
