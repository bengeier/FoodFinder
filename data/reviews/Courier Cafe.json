{"text":"This is a diner; if you expect more, also expect to be disappointed. Spanish chorizo omelette was light and flavorful but drowned in terrible tostidos salsa. Sourdough bread has really good flavor but had some fake butter slop on it that tasted like buttered popcorn jelly bellies. Biscuits and chunky sausage gravy were very good.  Very friendly service from my experience.  Not really a destination... Perhaps a good motto for c-u in general?"}
{"text":"As an Urbana native I grew up going to this place. I have always been satisfied and often recommend this to anyone new to the area. I really suggest going here and getting any number of the dishes as they are all great. The salad bar has a wide range of options which makes it one of the best in town. Leave room for dessert! The Misprint is definitely worth it."}
{"text":"I sincerely believe that Courier Cafe can only do sandwiches and shakes well. A few weeks ago, I went to Courier Cafe and ordered fish. What I got in return was the bland little sad looking piece of fish about the size of a playing card. It was cod. It was flavorless. It was served with thin slices of lemon on top of it. It served no purposes other than to falsely suggest there would be some lemon-y taste. Also on the plate were three slices of cucumber and a slice of tomato. Not sure why. Perhaps it was there so that I could rate which item was the most bland on the plate. I have been to courier cafe a few times, and I've always ordered some sort of burger or sandwich. They always came out as expected for a sandwich. It tasted good and it was filling. This on the other hand, left me disappointed as I compared the value and price of my meal against my friend who ordered a sandwich that costed less. I left the restaurant hungry and actually went to another nearby restaurant to eat again."}
{"text":"Quite good, but somewhat overrated.  Try their sweet potato fries, they're the best."}
{"text":"Like the environment here. But the waiting time for food is too long, around 25 mins waiting. Desert dippers taste good. We also ordered French toast and corned beef hash, which are not bad. But I hope the French toast slices can be thicker and softer. Overall 3.8/5."}
{"text":"First class breakfast served in an interesting and inviting atmosphere.  Ensconsed in an old building in downtown Urbana, Courrier Cafe is definitely a cut above the typical restaurants in U of I's hometown.  We were pleasantly surprised.  My wife had the 'Ham and Scram' and a side of pumpkin pancakes that were on special.  The eggs were well cooked and the ham was really tasty.  It had the right hint of smokines which I thought was particularly pleasant.  I had the Spanish omlette which, as usually happens in gringo joints, was billed as 'hot' by our waitress.  It was merely low-medium.  Generous shots of hot sauce kicked my dish up to the real heat level for me.  Delicious coffee and really nice bread that made excellent toast was also provided.  Attentive service (but the restaurant only had ten patrons when we were there - right at opening) so it may not be representative.  Not worth a special trip to Champaign-Urbana, but if you are in town or even passing by, a slight detour to patronize it is worth it."}
{"text":"Worst meal I have EVER eaten out! My daughter and I were at Couier cafe for dinner. We dont eat burgers and wanted something healthy (I couldnt find anything healthy on the menu) and the waitress said the grilled salmon was good so we tried it. It came with soup which was supposed to be a chipolte soup but was water with some beans thrown on top. It was splashed all over the dishes and looked like poop. Tasted worse. The salmon was unedible, the sweet pototato was so microwaved it was like baby food and also unedible. The waitress saw our plates were hardly touched yet never inquired as to how it was. When I went to pay (30.00) the person at the register asked how it was and I told him, yet still had to pay!! This restaurant looks and feels VERY dirty-they really need to replace the filthy rug. I would never go back to this place and do not recommend it if you want good, healthy food in a clean environment."}
{"text":"Courier cafe is the cutest little place in the heart of downtown Urbana. I've visited more than 6-7 times over the last 3 years, and I've not had a single negative experience. Their malts/milkshakes/phosphates are delicious. Service is great, staff provides very good recommendations if you're unsure about what you want. I've got the veggie dogwood sandwich which is my favourite. I've also got the blackbean burger and the quesadilla a couple times which weren't bad, but they definitely have better items on the menu."}
{"text":"The decor was old fashioned and dirty feeling. Even some fresh painted walls would help the overall feel.   We wanted to eat lunch but arrived at 1130 and had to order breakfast.  I ordered the Spanish Omelette, my husband ordered the Courier Breakfast and our kids got pancakes. None of us really enjoyed our meals. Both my husband and my glasses had cracks in them and were leaking all over the table.   We would not return."}
{"text":"The Dagwood & mocha milkshakes are a couple of our favorites at Courier. Be forewarned, the Dagwood is huge (we split it)! They'll split your milkshake, too & its still a big portion. They're open late, so its a nice dessert spot."}
{"text":"Can't believe this is owned by the same owners as silvercreek because courier is so much better. Great service. Good burgers. Awesome milkshakes."}
{"text":"Corn Beef & Pastrami with fries were gooooood good.  They serve Green River soda. This place knows what's up.  I'm not much of a deserts guy, but you have to get their banana split. Huge serving. Great vanilla taste."}
{"text":"Between the Courier and Silvercreek, which have the same owners, they have the best breakfast and brunch respectively in Champaign-Urbana.  The Courier is more comfy and affordable, and every bit as good.  Their lunch and dinner offererings are equally excellent.  The burgers and fried chicken are very good.  They are also famous for their pancakes and their shakes.  Really, really good.  As a resident of CU, it is a fact that if you want a taste of the best, you have to eat at the Courier."}
{"text":"We love the Courier! My family eats there more than we eat at home.  The staff is wonderful, the food is great - I highly recommend the Rueben sandwich.  The best in the state!"}
{"text":"Great ice cream--large amount, delicious and cheap! Spend about 4 bucks and you can enjoy a wonderful dessert. The foods there are traditional American foods: burgers, sandwiches..."}
{"text":"Came to Courier Cafe for brunch with some friends; this is a great place for small group of people to have a lazy weekend meal. Fortunately, we arrived early enough not to have to wait for a table, because this place got crowded really quickly. (For good reason!)   I had a courier burger (burger with bacon) with fries and coleslaw. I really appreciate how they put the burger toppings on the side of the plate, because it lets you assemble the burger however you want to, and makes the dish more presentable. The burger came out very neat and clean; I didn't have to deal with a sauce-filled, drippy mess, like some other places. It was all very appetizing, though nothing to write home about. I would avoid the coleslaw, however, which was disastrously drenched in mayonnaise, and after a few bites, I just set it to the side untouched.   I totally dig the antique-style decor in this restaurant. This is one of Urbana's landmark establishments; if you're looking for a place to enjoy a cozy meal with friends, definitely make a trip over here."}
{"text":"Classic diner with lots of menu items to choose from, including breakfast, lunch,  and burgers, a by the pound salad bar, ice cream & phosphates. Antiques from when it was a newspaper give it a classic old feel.  Good service and good prices!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of the Courier. I've always had great service. Unfortunately, today I was very disappointed.  After being seated, we were ignored for nearly fifteen minutes. After we saw another table that arrived after us get service within a minute of sitting down, we left. It was very frustrating. The busboy placed waters on our table and left us waiting. We were passed by multiple times without one server asking us anything. Ironically after we left, the hostess thanked us for our business and was completely oblivious of the fact that we had only arrived 15 minutes before."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, decent lunch. Try the Buenos Dios burrito."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Flavored coffee, almond French toast and biscuits and gravy are all winners."}
{"text":"The restaurant ambiance is very nice, especially when it isn't packed to the gills and you can sit in their booth.  Very standard menu of old traditional American diner standbys, with a nice salad bar.  I would often do the soup and salad thing here.  Of special note, the milkshakes are great, probably the best in town.  That said, I must admit that the food isn't top notch and I am sometimes disappointed by their burgers, sandwiches, etc."}
{"text":"Courier Cafe is a long time favorite place of mine to go in the Champaign-Urbana area.  The atmosphere can't be beat, the hometown old-fashioned feel is very warm and welcoming.  I love the look of it from the street with the lights framing the windows.  The food has always been decent.  The Dagwood is especially good and the milkshakes are yummy.  The salad bar offers a nice selection as well.  Definitely beats all the \"chain\" restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Both times I went my stomach hurt really bad afterwards. It IS just me, so I guess it isn't fair. But the taste of the food could be better. GO if you haven't gone yet. It might be your favorite place but it isn't mine."}
{"text":"My girlfriend is totally in love with Courier so we go whenever we can. Only had one problem ever, and they went so far above and beyond to take care of it. Always a pleasant visit."}
{"text":"Ok, the food's better than edible.  It's good, mostly.  The service, though, has always been indifferent...if not leaning to rude.  However, I'll probably go back again when I'm in Urbana and hungry.  But I've lowered my expectations!"}
{"text":"Ok I am biased.  A C-U native, I sat at The Courier for the first time as a baby in one of their wooden highchairs. This place is more than a restaurant to me.   But, try their black bean burgers (!), expansive salad bar, or one of their hand-dipped milkshakes. Or meet your friends for breakfast/brunch. Doubtful you'll regret it.   This place is full of history, memories and home."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in Urbana. Everyone is always so nice, food is reasonably priced, biscuits and dynamite, and the overall atmosphere is relaxing. Definitely coming back again and again."}
{"text":"I'd really been looking forward to going here. I'd passed it several times and was just looking for an occasion. Sunday morning brunch after V-day with the boy seemed like a good option. It was pretty hoppin and the inside was just what I expected it to be: very cute and eclectic, smattered with antiques (but not in the Cracker Barrel way.. in the authentic way), and cozy. Because the menus on the website don't say when breakfast ends and lunch begins, we weren't sure if we would have the option of choosing from either menu. We got there at around 11:35, and the hostess gave us menus with just breakfast. The menus are large, so if you take a while to decide (especially during brunch time...) be careful. Our waitress stopped by once immediately after we were seated to get our drink orders, and once about five minutes later. We told her we needed a few minutes. She came back shortly after and snapped at us, saying that they were only serving breakfast for 5 more minutes so we needed to order then. This was at around 11:45. I understand wanting to expedite things, but if the switch was happening at 11:50 shortly after we arrived, I think we should have been told by the waitress or the hostess that lunch was about to start (after we had been seated I saw people ahead of us getting salads and soups, but no lunch option was given to us). Anyway, he got the breakfast burrito and I got the breakfast sandwich. His was very good and enormous! The salsa verde was perfect.. I didn't even know I liked salsa on eggs. I think I just misordered in my haste. The croissant was not from their bakery.. it had the \"I came out of a cellophane wrapped plastic container from Sam's\" taste, but it was large.. just not a real croissant. The eggs were another problem: they were a consistent yellow color and had rounded borders. Not real scrambled eggs.. or maybe real but reconstituted. The bacon was tasty, the hashbrowns mushy. Not worth $7. He gave me half of his burrito in exchange for half of mine. I greatly benefited from the unfair trade!  I really want to like this place, so I'll try it again in the next few weeks! Hopefully I'll get a smiley waitress.  FYI: prices are a little higher than those listed on the online menu (but only about 50-60 cents)."}
{"text":"I came down to the Courier when I was down running a 10K at U of I. I'll start by saying everything about this restaurant was absolutely fantastic.   Location: Easy to find with an attached parking lot.   Atmosphere: Very organized and adorable. This place has a lot of history to it and they document all of their historical trinkets in the restaurant on the back of their menu so you can have a sort of scavenger hunt while waiting for your food.   Staff: Friendly, easy to talk to, willing to help and explain. Service was extremely quick.   Food: fantastic breakfast foods. They bake all their bread products fresh and we ended up buying a loaf of the German rye to take home. The jams were also fantastic! I also got a strawberry phosphate which was quite the experience.   Overall, please stop here. Great food, good prices."}
{"text":"Delicious amazing eclectic food choices. A favorite for me and my boyfriend (and a million other people because the place is always crowded, though there is never a long wait for a table).  I wish more people went to this place because I think it really needs to be supported more by university kids."}
{"text":"I've been here many times through the years. The quality is fantastic. The salad bar by weight is a great concept for the finicky eater...especially my kids."}
{"text":"Have been here twice for breakfast. First time by myself was  positive, good value breakfast, nothing went wrong. Second time was with my fiancée, and we waited over an hour for our food to arrive. After repeatedly trying and failing to make eye contact with the waitress while she generally chatted with her coworkers, I asked her to check on the kitchen. She came back with the food within less than two minutes, saying luckily the food just came out. But everything was cold, which is proof to me that she simply forgot about it. This service is unacceptable, and would warrant a 1 star rating if not for the first time. There probably won't be a third though."}
{"text":"This is the best place for milkshakes in the area. If you're lucky they will give you your glass plus the extra.  If you are getting an appetizer, get the skinny dippers (loaded potatoes).  I've tried several sandwiches and wraps and I've always left satisfied."}
{"text":"I love this place's decor, sometimes I just go for the atmosphere.  I used to get the burgers here, they're ok, better than any others I can find in Urbana.  I think the star of the show is the milkshakes though.  Pretty cheap considering how much better it is than Green St options, so if you have a car I would check it out."}
{"text":"I've eaten here occasionally in the time that I've lived in the area (my whole life), and it's never very memorable (the food, that is).   The building itself is really cool looking inside, but the food is just okay... in fact, I know I'd prefer cooking at home to overpaying here.   Also, the waitress I had the other day was really rude. Might be a good place for an awkward first date."}
{"text":"I love Courier Cafe's salad bar-it has absolutely everything you could ever put on a salad.  Salad bars aren't as popular or common as they were 30 years ago, but I am still a fan.  I've tried other things on their menu and enjoyed them-the desserts are excellent.  I like the Victorian decor, too."}
{"text":"The Courier has been our go-to place for a quick  breakfast, lunch, dinner, or just for phosphates and ice cream in Downtown Urbana. I love the decor and the quiet, subdued atmosphere. The staff is generally great and accommodating."}
{"text":"We have always enjoyed Courier and have been dining here more and more recently. The staff are friendly and service is always great. For lunch and dinner, we usually have sandwiches -- the Carolina Reuben is incredible, and the food is very reasonably priced. The salad bar is always a hit -- a great inexpensive way to get some extra veggies.  For dessert, you can't go wrong with a milkshake, a sundae (Misprint with hot fudge!) or a slice of pie (cherry pie à la mode!). Courier is an Urbana tradition for a good reason, and has never disappointed."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple time both times having a burger and a shake. The burgers are your middle of the road standard burger, the meat is not that tasty, Under seasoned and too much bun. It does come with a nice big pickle spear and a moderate amount of fries (for extra). Where Courier Cafe does stand out is in their shakes. They are excellent, I've tasted the Vanilla, Coffee and the banana (Which I highly recommend). The service was pretty good and the atmosphere is pretty neat as long as you get seating in the front room."}
{"text":"I've been going to the Courier Cafe for years!  Since it first opened in the old Courier Newspaper building.  Such a treasure - both for the history it represents - and the great food and service!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best hidden gems in Urbana! Located in downtown Urbana, Courier Cafe has an old classical cafe feel and decoration. I don't know to describe to be Old Victorian but it is old school for sure. The seats are all wood, wooden floors, dim lighting, classic wooden benches, and there is even an old school cash register. Definitely a blast in the past to the early 20th century. Very classy and clean place that had a warm, home feeling.  The food? What can I say. AMAZING. It is just simple, American, home-cooking! I have had just about everything from the awesome burgers (which come in a ton of different ways), steak sandwich, soups, deep fried shrimp, most of the pies, and the sundaes. Best of all, it's all fairly cheap!  The service was also awesome! I went here with a large party of nearly 20 people and I went here with just 3. Both times the service was amazing. There is this elderly guy there with glasses and he is just very nice, funny, and personable to us every time.  I have made this a regular place for me to go when I am in the Urbana-Champaign area."}
{"text":"I really like their fish tacos, man those things are tasty! Their salad bar is amazing too, yo they know how to run a salad bar (for an affordable price). Burgers are also good.   Also them milkshakes? Aw yiss yiss. Not only do they serve it in a bigass glass, they also bring out the leftover so you can feed yourself AND your friend who's too cheap to splurge on a milkshake! Awesome!    Servers are hella nice. Nice vibe. Great place."}
{"text":"We thought we would find this as the Sunday late breakfast/brunch restaurant.  But, it turns out that they stopped serving eggs, pancakes and French toast at 11:30.  So even though we were disappointed with our menu we were not disappointed with the meal.   Price are pretty cheap, sandwiches are fairly big and the decor at the old newspaper offices was cute.   Don't miss the enormous cookies at the register."}
{"text":"I come to Courier Cafe pretty regularly.  Their burger options are a good bargain.  I've always enjoyed their shakes- especially the strawberry or peanut butter.  I prefer to get the specials because I go there so often.  I had a delicious fish fillet sandwich with a HUGE fillet.  Then I got it again, and it was pretty small.  I noticed that sometimes the food isn't very consistent.    The one thing that might surprise you is that their salad bar is AMAZING.  I get a huge salad with everything on it.  Like a pound of salad for $5.00.  Leaves are pretty light, so a pound a salad is prettty huge."}
{"text":"The food is alright. Everything I've had has been decent, and they have a pretty good variety of sandwiches.  What I really don't like, is that after waiting half an hour in the weekend-breakfast-rush, you finally get seated and are and offered two types of coffee: 'regular' coffee so weak and watery that you could reproduce it by pouring hot water into a coffee-stained pitcher, or hazelnut-vanilla-strawberry-mint-kiwi flavored 'coffee'. And they act so genuinely proud of themselves as they offer it to you. Its a marvel of human nature."}
{"text":"YUM, we would trek it off campus to go here, it's the best place off campus for burgers and shakes.  The shakes are huge and they give you the silver cup too so it's like 2 shakes for the price of one!  Service was always really good, un-pretentious atmosphere."}
{"text":"Dinner at the Courier Cafe was excellent! Everyone that I was with said that their meal was fantastic. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very rustic. The only complaint is that they are not prepared for groups larger than four. We had six, so we were seated a bit awkwardly at two adjoining tables - one square, the other circular. The food and the atmosphere, however, are enough to give this establishment a 4."}
{"text":"Good breakfast joint right in downtown Urbana."}
{"text":"I joined Heather T for breakfast, and she's right. My cholesterol goes up just thinking about that menu. The corn beef hash had a pound of salt in it, the bacon was drippy, and the sausage links were about the size of a bratwurst. It was great. I'd go back in a second.  The restaurant is of the \"encased in time\" style of decor. The old wood booths are awesome, and the place is filled with antiques. The fact that the menu details the history of those antiques is a nice touch."}
{"text":"Hands down one of my favorite places in CU.  The prices are very fair, the food is good, they offer a nice variety and the atmosphere is fantastic.  The shakes are well worth every last one of the million or so calories they contain.  Minus one star because they don't handle carry out very well.  I've never had an order get mixed up when eating in, but there's about a 30% chance of a screw-up when getting carry out.  To the credit of the manager, when I brought this to his attention he was really apologetic, personally verified that my order was correct, and gave me my next meal on the house.  So they get the star back =)."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast with a friend.  The food was decent, and I don't recall feeling like I paid a lot for it (that's a good thing right?).  Just a bit far from campus if you are a student."}
{"text":"Delicious! It's tucked away and amazing. They always give you more than enough to eat. The atmosphere is so quaint. I love the Misprint for desert. My favorite sandwich is definitely the Club."}
{"text":"This is a very delightful cafe and has served as a huge contribution to our community for years! I love the preserved tin ceiling that is above our heads while we dine. I also like the history behind the building itself and that this beautiful building is being preserved while used for a cafe. One of my other favorite architectural features of it is the steps after you walk through the doors. They are just lovely! The food that they serve is very delicious and also very health conscious for the most part. With the exception of some special treats like ice cream sundaes that look out of this world! One of their signature classics has always been the salad bar that they sell by the ounce. It is incredibly fresh. They have a garden on the property and include items grown in it on their salad bar and menu! You can not get much fresher or closer to were your food is growing than a few feet from the restaurant! My only regret is I didn't get to try any of the lovely fresh strawberries they were growing!"}
{"text":"This was a favorite of my family's growing up. It's pretty solid, the atmosphere is neat & the decorations are really fun to look at. The airplane on the ceiling has been there forever! Skimpy servings sometimes. Salad bar and green rivers are popular."}
{"text":"The Courier mystifies me.  It's always packed. People say they love the food. They think the building is charming. But the decor seems more tired and limp than it does charming and authentic, and the place is very loud, and kind of dirty.  The menu looks like it has appetizing, if plain, selections, but the food doesn't taste like anything and there's so much of it on the plate that after a while you begin to feel as though you are in a fight to the death with it.  I've heard people say that it's diner food, but it tastes more like reheated frozen dinners. It looks like food, and sometimes it smells like food, but inexplicably, it doesn't taste like food.   The service is serviceable. The bathrooms are appalling.  The salad bar is puzzling.  The four times I've been there, I've found it rather difficult to get cashed out.  After which, I've been surprised at how much cash I've just spent."}
{"text":"Ate lunch at Courier Cafe today. I had not been here for quite some time.  We had a short wait to get seated, which was understandable since we came just after noon.  I would probably prefer to come for breakfast, but that wasn't in the cards today.  The service was very good. Our waitress was polite, food came in a reasonable time, and drinks were refilled regularly. We were also brought our check in a speedy manner, which I always like.  Food: I had a buffalo chicken wrap, my wife had a hamburger and my son had a reuben sandwich and fries. All the food was very good.  The only negative is the scrum at the front door/register when you are on the waiting list or paying your bill. Of course, part of the charm of Courier is the old time feeling the place gives, and a large waiting room would probably detract from that.  Next trip: breakfast!"}
{"text":"I went to the Courier Cafe for a late dinner, and I left satisfied. Its more expensive than most restaurants in campustown, but the food is worth it. I ordered a burger, and it was very filling. All my friends were pleasantly surprised too. My vegetarian friends tell me that the vegetarian selection is good as well.   I'd recommend getting one of their hand dipped shakes. You may get sticker shock upon first seeing the price, but it is worth the money."}
{"text":"If you go to the Courier restaurant you go there because you want some character and you are tired of all of the chain restaurants.  We stopped there for breakfast and had a solid dinner style basic breakfast.  You won't get world class originality and a spotless place but you will get tons of character and food done well.   Our waitress was fine, the coffee was great, and my French toast was what French toast should be.  Nothing special just all of the basics done well.  The building is fun to explore as you see all of the old school features that make this place really interesting.  If this restaurant was in my town you can guarantee I would be there weekly just to ensure a place like this stays in business."}
{"text":"I've eaten at a lot of great places in my absence, so prepare for a string of gushing reviews.  Despite being extremely busy on a home-game day, our group of 4 was able to score outdoor seating pretty much right away.  Our waitress was nice, and as attentive as she could be for having to wait on 10 tables at once.  You could tell the cafe was going for more of an old school thing with it's antique register, wooden... everything, menu items, etc.  For brunch on such a gorgeous, late summer day, my friends and I knew we HAD to sit outside.  I can definitely see myself coming back to relax with a newspaper/book and a sandwich.  Plus, I hear their milkshakes are pretty good so I guess I'll have to try that out as well!  Did I mention their portions here are pretty much huge?  My friend and I split their Dagwood, and Desert Dippers (healthy, right?) and were STUFFED afterwords.  The quality of the food itself wasn't anything special, but it still hits the spot when you haven't had anything to eat all day (like us).  I'll be back here for sure."}
{"text":"Cozy seating area. Phenomenal salad bar. Burgers were alright, nothing extraordinary.  Do try the brownie special.. Its amazing!!"}
{"text":"Love the look and feel of the place but I've eaten better food. Came here for breakfast and it was alright, nothing great. The service here was fantastic."}
{"text":"Me and my brother went here, we ordered the Dagwood (big sandwich) and southern fried chicken. Simple american food , the sandwich was filling and interesting, the chicken was simple , missing flavors  Too much workers , it takes time for the food to to it! Ordered brownies special was very good!!  Nice place! Decorated good!"}
{"text":"Worst dinning experience ever. Slow service, horrible management, food was alright at best. Wouldn't serve us alcohol which I get. But lies to us about not having it after we called before and asked if they did. Then brought out a screwdriver for the people at the table behind us. Waited 45 minutes for our food and it wasn't even busy. Won't ever go here again."}
{"text":"We went there last night to celebrate our friends getting married. I ordered the salmon and it was extremely overdone, my sweet potato I ordered was so underdone I had to scrape the middle with a fork just to eat the very middle. It was only 6:45 and they were already out of baked potatoes for the rest of us in our party so they had to have fries. The only thing I can say that was very good was the cream of mushroom soup. I should have sent my dinner back and just had another bowl of soup. I will never go here for dinner again. Breakfast is the only thing I think they can do very well."}
{"text":"When I arrived in \"Chambana\" (just kidding, that's not a fucking word) my freshman year I was saddened by the lack of Diners, Drive-ins, and/or dives.  But - tucked away inconspicuously on a side street of Downtown Urbana is the Courier Cafe, an amazing little place that you'll want to come back to for every meal. The other reviewers have summated the greatness of this place pretty well, so I'll just add in how great the prices are. I had a rib-eye steak sandwich, iced tea, and a mocha milkshake for about $13. I could not eat another bite the rest of that Saturday Night, phenomenal. The ambiance is also great, the building feels very \"homey\" with all the wood paneling and old-school wallpaper.  SO,go, eat, and drink milkshakes: for places such as the Courier are getting harder and harder to find!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience here. Very friendly, helpful staff; nice kids' menu, lots of flavorful vegetarian selections; and amazing ice cream! We will certainly be back often."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast, and we got seated for two right away. The waitress was super nice. The food- I have to say was just average. Maybe I had talked it up in my head too much. I had been craving french toast all week, and this Sunday breakfast was supposed to satisfy that craving- and it did not do it. I ordered the almond french toast with cinnamon raisin bread as suggested from our waitress. I had a side of the sweet maple links (eh) and hash browns. And it was just, average. I could have been eating at Denny's or any other diner.   The ambiance is TOTALLY cute though. I would definitely be willing to try breakfast here again- maybe the pancakes are better?"}
{"text":"if you're a vegetarian, this place is super friendly.  breakfast offers tofu scramble instead of eggs, and vegetarian breakfast \"sausage\".  it's nice to have options instead of just having pancakes... again.    there is a nice salad bar, but to be honest, the quality of that is hit or miss.  sometimes it's really fresh and all the salads look like they have just been prepped, but sometimes, and it seems like it's been more often, the salad bar looks sad.  i actually got a scoop of slimy carrots the last time.  it was way gross, and it wasn't something i noticed until i had plopped the big scoop on my plate, thus ruining the rest of my salad.  they allowed me to take a new plate, and start again, but it was pretty gross.  if you like alternative proteins like beans and tofu, there is plenty on the bar.  however, the beans are just dumped from can to salad bar, and are full of that gelatinous goo that the beans float around in in the can. (you know... the stuff you usually rinse off thoroughly.)  the service is generally fantastic.  a lot of their wait staff is attentive and friendly, especially in the morning.  there are some night staff that seem to forget you exist, but for the most part, it's decent service.    all in all, if your vegetarian or vegan, there are options, which is difficult to find for a sit down meal in this town and don't feel like having sushi or lo mein.  i would give it 4/5 but just because the quality of some things ... like service and salad bar... is hit or miss."}
{"text":"Totally recommend this place!  They have some of the amazing hamburgers in Downtown Urbana. And the salad bar is awesome too!! Although I haven't tried the desserts, they look delicious too. It is a very comfortable place and has such good ambiance. You get the vintage feeling sitting in the dining area. The downside would be slow service offered here."}
{"text":"On man. BEST. PANCAKES. EVER. This has turned into a Sunday morning tradition. The service has always been really great (with one exception, but maybe he was having an off day). Everyone is usually really friendly and attentive. The Cake and Egger is my breakfast choice but I bet it's all good. I've only eaten lunch here once. I got the salad bar and the black bean burger. The black bean burger while not terrible, just wasn't for me. It was really bloated and mushy which made it difficult to eat. I had to just eat it with a fork. I'm used to something a little more dense and solid like a burger would be. The salad bar was delicious. REALLY great selection and everything was fresh. My one complaint would be that I'm 5 ft 6in, which is not really that short, and it was really difficult to reach toppings and their \"sneeze guard/window\" apparatus is really awkward. But it's worth the hassle. You go up and get your salad, they weigh it and you give the ticket to the sever. I got a very large salad for about $5.  Love this place. Great ambience, great food."}
{"text":"This place is an old standby, esp. with alums and old-timers.  Once upon a time, say around 20 years ago, there really weren't many places in town to eat that weren't fast food and weren't high end.  Courier bridged this gap, in a nice space.  In the meantime, MANY fine restaurants at all price points of come along, and the Courier has more or less stayed the same.  That is to say, good, but not great food, spotty service sometimes depending on the crowds, and often long waits."}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice and both times I was rather disappointed. Overall, the food is bland and greasy. The eggs always make my stomach churn for the rest of the day as well. Not a fan."}
{"text":"The food is great. The atmosphere is very comforting. The wait staff is always friendly.  Be sure to try the Bennet Burger (it's not on the menu anymore, but they can still make it)."}
{"text":"The owner is extremely nice and generous to the community! This place is extremely affordable and fun. I love that it has so many vegetarian options because I often only get one choice at many places. I really love the grilled Swiss and pesto sandwich on sourdough. Also, the milkshakes are tasty."}
{"text":"I guess there is no way to give 3.5 stars. This is my second review of this place. Woke up early enough for breakfast here which was good. Had the Cake and Egger which was 2 buckwheat pancakes with scrambled eggs and sausage patties. My only complain is that from the time I place the order till I got the food just took very long. At a minimum it should take 10 no more than 15 minutes to get the food. Actual time was about a little more than 25 minutes. IMHO it shouldn't have taken very long to get the food to the table so that needs improvement. Everything else, no complaints at all."}
{"text":"I went to Courier Cafe today with Mr. Boyfriend and two of our friends. Overall, we had a good experience. Pros: -Service: The cafe was fairly busy, but we were seated right away, and we all had water glasses within a couple minutes. Our waitress was friendly, attentive, and very patient. If I could rate service separately, it would be a 5-star rating. -Decor: I like it! The theme seems to be old-timey newspaper, which is pretty cool.  -Milkshake. Mr. Boyfriend and I got a peanut butter to split, and our friends got butterscotch. Awesome. -The \"Skinny Dippers,\" crispy, fried potato skins covered with cheese, bacon, sour cream and chives. These will make a person anything but skinny. We got a half-order to split, and ended up with approximately a bazillion potato skins. Wow. -Food in general: pretty good!  -Menu: Quaintly themed, with desserts named after newspaper stuff (\"Headliner,\" \"Misprint,\" \"Cub Reporter,\" etc...). Standard American fare, sandwiches, burgers, etc.  Cons, Almost-Cons, Slight Issues: -Price: It wasn't terribly overpriced for being right in downtown Urbana. I'm willing to pay $5.75 for a BLT. I just want the BLT to be a great BLT. The BLT was a good BLT, but it was a $4 BLT. Tiny slice of tomato, lots of lettuce, some decent bacon, on basic slices of wheat bread. The skins were $4.95, and these are SO worth it to split with a group, because of how good they are and how many we received. Milkshake was $3.75, I believe. Altogether, Mr. Boyfriend spent around $30 before tip for the two of us.  -Timing: We arrived at 12:10, ordered by 12:15, and were served at 12:45. I had to be back at work by 1, so I had hoped the food would come out more quickly. This isn't a terrible wait, and like I said, the restaurant was doing good business. Still, I had ten minutes to eat, but 30 to talk. I would rather have 30 minutes to savor those potato skins, and ten minutes to talk to the jerks I call friends, but you can't always get what you want."}
{"text":"Great place.  I breakfast here several times a week.  Staff is friendly and efficient.  My favorite waitress takes good care of me and took the time to get to know me and what I order.  The flavored coffee of the day is always quite good.  I tend to have the same thing each time because I like it but I have tried just about everything on the menu and it is always good.  The menu is not as large as some breakfast spots but there is enough variety for everyone to find something.  The corned beef breakfast, the cakes and eggs with buckwheats, and the Spanish omelet are particular favorites.  NOTE: Courier does NOT serve breakfast all day.  Weekdays, breakfast is served until 11 AM and weekends it is served until 11:45 AM.  Note: Their Web page says \"The dining area is quiet and peaceful\".  Well, I went there for dinner for the first time and my \"quiet and peaceful\" meal was, instead, a cacophony of unwelcomed concertina music.  Seriously? Who does that?  Sorry, Courier, but you struck out with that intrusion."}
{"text":"A place of childhood dreams. The bread and potato wedges are very memorable. Go for the peanut butter milkshakes too!"}
{"text":"Here on Yelp it says the place takes reservations. When my friend called a day ahead, she was informed that she would have to reserve a table the day we would sit down for brunch. When she called again the following morning, her name was added to a list as opposed to having a table reserved; no distinction over the phone the second time was made regarding a reservation vs name holding; we waited about an hour after we were first told it would be a 30-40 minute wait for a table.   We came during UIUC's Moms weekend so I'm giving the benefit of the doubt, not deducting a star, but under pressure this place seems frazzled: only one hostess, few waiters, and sides of juice or hash browns that only appeared upon politely reminding a passing staff member.  As a vegan I decided on a light and simple breakfast, substituting the egg for tofu that had turmeric thrown on seemingly for color but not taste. Perhaps next time, lunch on a quiet weekend will fare better. I'm not giving up on Courier Café just yet."}
{"text":"I love this quant little place. I have to stop for breakfast every time I am in town. The Spanish Omelette is one of the best omelettes I have ever had. Very good flavor. The service is always good when in there. The waitress I had today was very prompt. She kept my ice tea full. That is not an easy task I go through it quick. I strongly recommend this place if you are looking for a nice freindly place to eat."}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews on Yelp, I had fairly expectations when I went to Courier Cafe. I went for dinner on a week night, and the place was almost completely empty. The food is American: sandwiches, burgers, soups, salads, and also more serious entrees. I was going to go for the salmon, but my waitress talked me out of it, so I ended up getting the pork chops, which came with soup. The soup was black bean soup: it was actually quite tasty, and the portion was huge (I expected just a small bowl, since it was supposed to be a side). I was almost full after finishing the soup and when the pork chops arrived, and that was a good thing because I was not too impressed by them... grilled pork chops lathered in bbq sauce, really nothing too exceptional, and the little side of salad that came with it didn't even have any dressing. So... the portion were huge, it was pretty cheap (I think I ended up paying under $15 including a soda), but the food did not impress me much. The service however was pretty friendly.   I tried going again for brunch on a Sunday morning, but gave up when I saw the line... I guess it gets quite crowded on the weekend, which is generally a good sign, so I'll have to give it another try for brunch."}
{"text":"Nicely located trendy cafe that needs a little help with menu.   The location is great. The building is historical and also maintained nicely to give that historical location dining feel. We went there for brunch on sunday to avoid longer lines at the original pancake house! The lines are long here as well, just an FYI. We had to wait about 20 minutes. They have a limited menu. Our server was so busy, he barely paid attention to our order.   Food was mediocre at best. Home fries were burnt. Eggs were freshly made and nice. Orange juice is not fresh. They serve tea bags in a pot which is less than ideal, I always want loose leaf tea for the pot. IMHO, if you are going to the trouble of making a kettle pot for hot water for tea at least give loose leaves to brew!!   With a little help, this place can be a must visit breakfast place in town!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I, being the old grammas we are, decided to have dinner at 4:50 pm....because we had been studying for a while and had super-munchies. I think one of the most appealing aspects of this restaurant is its warm inviting feel; it brings to mind a quaint country hotel.  I like the dim lights, I like the booth-ed seats, and I like the salad bar set-up. The normal tables with pull-out seats however, were awkwardly arranged- the tables are kind of haphazardly mushed closed together.  Even the waitresses had trouble getting around the seats, I was asked about 3 times to move so the waitress could squeeze her way behind my seat to get to a big table of 5.  I ended up ordering the Banker's Burger @ about $ 5.00(1/3 patty, swiss, mushroom, tomato on a toasty bun)and sweet potato fries for additional dollar.  Thank goodness the burger was delicious, because despite my friend and I getting there so early, it took almost a half hour for our food to come. The patty was done just perfectly,  and sat happily in my tummy.  The sweet potato fries I wasn't too fond of though; they were more chips than fries.  Some of them were rather brown and burnt- the more orange coloured ones were really good, the crispier burnt ones left a very strong taste of charcoal in my mouth.   But overall, I would come again. The servers were slow, but very friendly.  And really, the price I paid for a whole VERY filling meal (about $7.50) was extraordinarily within my budget. =]"}
{"text":"Well, I've always liked the decor, and the food has been okay, maybe too greasy for my taste, but the last 3 times that I've been here the service has been so bad that I've complained to the cashier and left no tip (which is really extreme for me).  It's always been so popular that I tried to give them a second and third chance, but I will not be going back, ever.  Fortunately their other restaurant, the Silvercreek, is much better on all counts.  Must have different management."}
{"text":"Great almond french toast, decent coffee, but the place could use some sprucing up."}
{"text":"On a sidestreet in downtown Urbana a hidden gem sits, tucked away By word of mouth, all locals know about Courier Cafe  The moment you walk through the door you're filled with small-town cheer The atmosphere is \"mom & pops\" No wonder they've been here for years  Gigantic cookies as big as your head pastries and muffins are on display Next to their vintage cash register Beneath the glass counter where you pay  Their menu is full of sundaes and shakes ordered by children & adults alike They've got burgers, sandwiches and wraps I haven't found something I didn't like  By the way, for just 95 cents you can pick a side with your meal Seasoned wedge fries or sweet potato chips But the dill potato salad's my ideal  If you come, do so for brunch Or breakfast, lunch or dinner At any time of the day, just be prepared That you won't leave here feeling thinner  Which leads me to a related topic Their hot fudge will make you swoon! \"Would you like some ice cream with that fudge?\" Nah, the fudge itself- plus me and a spoon.  As a student, I had a morning ritual: Fresh coffee and a pastry. The croissant-crust with raspberry preserves Man, it's been years since I've had one lately...  So, five stars are for nostalgia and five stars are for the food Hopefully proof enough, that this place is the bomb: Using poetry to capture the mood  This place has made its mark It's a beloved Urbana spot of mine Every time I come back to campus This is hands-down where I'll dine"}
{"text":"Five stars for the ice cream.  Hands down.  No questions asked.  Do not even think about Steak and Shake. You must come here for their homemade ice cream that they use for delicious shakes and the highly recommended sundaes (see picture).  As for the regular food, 3 stars in quality, 2 stars for how I wish fries came with my meal.  I had the turkey croissant, which was good but gave me a vibe of how I could have made it at home.  I do not like how fries are not automatically included with sandwiches (see picture).  However, my boyfriend seemed to really enjoy his Southern Fried Chicken.  The Skinny Dippers were to die for, literally, there's sour cream, bacon and cheese on them!  The ambiance is great and classic.  They have an ample number of wooden booths and a beautiful copper ceiling.  The menu looks like it came from a printing press used to advertise the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, for which I believe they have pictures of on the walls.  I would recommend Courier Café as great place to top off a dinner date meal, take your family, or catch up with friends.  During nice weather they have outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Food is consistently good, but I find myself going there less and less because of the lack of anyplace to wait if there's not a table immediately available (and there usually isn't).  You can either stand in the doorway, blocking everyone coming in and out or stand directly on top of the people who are unfortunate enough to get the table right by the window.  I wish they would realize no one wants to get stuck sitting there (four parties, including us, turned it down yesterday while we were there.) and make that into a small waiting area."}
{"text":"One of my favorites! Turkey stack is the best turkey sandwich you will ever have. The creamy chicken noodle soup is amazing. Get the skinny dippers instead of fries. Service is always good."}
{"text":"Usually pretty consistent. We do not stray from the Ruben and Fries or Corned Beef Hash. Service depends on student presence; no students in town and service is great...  Beats the disgusting Merry Ann's that the kids hold so dear."}
{"text":"Growing up in Urbana, I used to love this place. I'm not usually a milkshake drinker, but this is the only place where I've ever enjoyed a milkshake - I don't get the sickly sweet aftertaste that I get with other restaurants' milkshakes. Also, Skinny Dippers are delicious! They're essentially skinnier potato skins so they're more crispy.  The reason for the 3 star review is for service. (Although don't worry, we still tipped the waitress very well.) I stopped by today and we had a 15 minute delay after being seated before someone took our order. We were asked if we wanted our drinks and skinny dippers before our meal, which we said yes to, but they didn't arrive until our burgers were done.  We started to wonder if they had just forgotten about us since other people seated after us got their drinks/food before we did.  I used to enjoy the burgers here - they're not terribly fancy, but the buns would be nice and fluffy and the patties tender. However, today mine arrived so dry to the point where I actually didn't eat it and came with a different type of cheese than requested. Also, no one stopped by to ask us for refills on our waters (empty).   Overall, although I still enjoy the decor and milkshakes, today's experience made me wish I had gone somewhere else to eat. Last time I came here (last year), I also had a lukewarm experience so I'm starting to wonder if the service has just gone down over the years. Today I had introduced someone to it since I raved about it in the past, and he wasn't that impressed either.   I hope the Courier will improve again, because it is definitely a staple of downtown Urbana."}
{"text":"I've been here numerous times, and the food is always really good. The milkshakes are especially delicious."}
{"text":"Great character. Local place with great charm. Burgers are good. I had blue cheese and mushroom burger. It was great."}
{"text":"I will just start by saying that I am EXTREMELY picky about my biscuits and gravy. Very rarely do I find one that I would order a full plate of because I can always make it way better at home. Here I had a mini order of the biscuits and gravy with my meal. I was pretty impressed. The gravy actually tasted like sausage gravy. The base could have been cooked a bit longer, as the flour flavor lingered a bit but the overall flavor was what I expect in a good sausage gravy. The rest of my meal was great. My eggs were cooked well, toast was great. Overall, the experience was great."}
{"text":"In Urbana  we were just looking for a good American restaurant with home cooking.We found that at the courier cafe.We went on a Saturday night and waited quite awhile to get waited on as our waitress was swamped.There menu was full of a lot of homemade dishes and we were looking forward to eating here.I had the turkey noodle soup and it was excellent and in a big bowl.We also got the potato skins and I highly recommend getting these, as they were loaded with bacon & cheese. My honey had the vegetarian chili and she really enjoyed that. I also ordered the southern fried chicken and that was real good.I have heard from a friend that there milkshakes are made old fashion in the metal cups and they even bring you out the cup which is nice.We got a slice of chocolate cream pie which was real rich and just right.We also got some homemade cheesecake and that was very tasty and rich.This place was packed and from being out of town it must be a popular place to eat.I can totally understand how this place got great reviews and we will come again.Although the service was slow we still enjoyed are evening at the courier cafe.On 6/2012 we went here for breakfast and it was delicious & hot da spot.Its def. a local eatery that should be visited when in Urbana,il."}
{"text":"Great burgers at the courier. This is a place my parents hung out at when my dad was going to Illinois. Good milkshakes an great pulled pork the first time I went there. Love the old register gives it a bit ambience"}
{"text":"Love this place, super delicious breakfast after an all nighter. Had the feta cheese omelette with wheat toast and the apple french toast (something like that). So good, mouth-wateringly good. Only reason I take off a star is because the server was a bit frantic and rude at first, but was relatively decent after our drinks. There was also an annoying group of high-schoolers there who reserved 30 spots...yeah....Nice atmosphere. Very antique/ vintage feel. Drinks are old-timey as well. They offer phosphates. Friend got a German chocolate cake coffee. Smelled exactly like it. Recommend this as an Urbana-must."}
{"text":"We have been coming into the Courier Cafe for years,  and despite the very tasty \"home-cooked\" feel the meals at Courier Cafe have,  service has steadily deteriorated. It has never been so bad. The only reason why we placed 2 stars is because of the food.  -(Money-saving Mystery Butter blend) On numerous occasions when we dined here, we had a very hard time getting an order in. When ordering a plate, the waitress was cold and stern. We asked her to bring plain butter rather than their money-saving \"mystery butter blend\", and she was making a face and saying \"Oh I'm not sure I can do that\", despite the fact that they have pure butter at hand. She was selective about who she served and was overall rude.  -(Kicking customers out the door) Then Chuck, the manager, and his waitress came up to our table well before closing hour and started moaning about how he is closing soon and was trying to kick us out in advance!  -(Ignoring customers) The last time we came here, we sat outside as the waitress Nicole was serving someone else. Although we said \"hi\", *she blatantly ignored us* and we had to walk into the restaurant and talk to the manager JUST TO PLACE OUR ORDER. It was so bad. We watched the manager baby-sit the waitress as he told her \"you have customers waiting for you, Nicole.\"  But she had seen us before and consciously ignored us.  A few minutes after we came back out to dine outside, Nicole (the waitress) walked towards us and gave us a very phony smile.   -(Insolent manager) On this other occasion, Chuck (The Manager) was chatting with us after dinner and he called my friend a \"Liar\" simply because he was trying to get him to guess where we were from. He also called us \"Disingenuous\" for the same reason.  -(Summary) Overall, The Courier Cafe has great food, but due to a grumpy and harassing Manager, and rude waitresses who need to be *told* that they have tables waiting for them, we are strongly considering never dining there again."}
{"text":"I have eaten at the Courier several times. Each time is just as good or better than the last time. They offer quite a variety of foods for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and their desserts. Definitely worth visiting your next time in Urbana."}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite family spot. Good and service always amazing. Best salad bar in town!"}
{"text":"I come to champagne all the time and this is my 2nd time here. Homemade bread, friendly staff, great coffee ! Can't ask for much more!! And my ham tastes like it's been made over an open fire, delicious"}
{"text":"If Ii were to get one chance at ordering a coffee or a chocolate milkshake, I would order it from Courier Cafe. Even though it's an old fashioned kind of spot; as in, old carpet, old(er) waitresses who may or may not be friendly, and old silverware. But there's nothing like a good old fashioned milkshake that's too think to get through a straw, and comes with the overflow in the metal mixing cup. Even on a cold winter day, I'll make my way over to the Courier Cafe. Any self-respecting milkshake connoisseur might do the same."}
{"text":"This is an update to my full review below.    I have been chided by yelp message -- probably from the owner or his friend -- that it is OK to call a tortilla dish \"rarebit.\"  My feeling is that if you were going for a zany take on rarebit that an insider would get, no luck. I moved here from Britain. When I saw the tortilla labeled \"rarebit\" my reaction was: This place doesn't know what they are doing. Admittedly, the item on the menu labeled \"spanish\" is far weirder."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town! I really can't complain about anything related to their breakfasts - amazing buckwheat pancakes, burritos, omelets, and the almond french toast is to die for. Their lunch and dinner menu is just ok, which is why I gave it 4 stars. I will be sticking to breakfast in the future!"}
{"text":"I only give a review of a place if they're really bad or really good. Not that my opinion matters right? But this place was incredible. Hands down a must visit if you're in Illinois. Lots of history and the best food I've had at a restaurant in a very, very long time. Everything they make is from scratch, and the staff were impeccable. My mother enjoyed it just as much as I did. A five star hidden gem of the Midwest. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Best salad bar I've ever had......great prices....great soup!!!!  My favorite place to eat lunch! Must go if you've never been. Long lines out the door during peak times..so plan accordingly!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and great food! Love this place, always a favorite experience when visiting the area. I understand they close every year for 1 week for deep cleaning and general sprucing up (I make sure I don't visit the week after Christmas as to miss eating there.) Every restaurant should do this. I would always recommend The Courier Cafe!"}
{"text":"What a lovely place to grab a leisurely, hearty breakfast or brunch. While yes the place is technically a diner, it's really the only one I've ever seen that could be said to offer some historical interest as well; as the back of the menu describes in detail, the place used to be the home of the Courier Newspaper. Much of the decor hanging on the walls has some historical significance, which was so cool! Perfect place to bring an out-of-towner.  The food was really delicious. I ordered a Spanish omelette, which was HUGE and came with potatoes and a choice of homemade bread (I chose sourdough bread). The potatoes came diced, and were fried slightly soft--almost like very very tender McDonalds hashbrowns. Not my preferred breakfast potato style, but I'll take it!! The omelette was my favorite part--stuffed with fresh jalapenos, onions, chorizo, and Chihuaha cheese. And so cheap, too! 8-ish bucks for a very generous meal.  But the best part of the meal: the truly great service (particularly in contrast to the brunch experience I had had just the day before elsewhere, in Champaign). I don't remember her name, but our waitress just beamed amiable Midwest charm, and was very competent about getting us refills and keeping us apprised of the status of our dishes when there was a bit of a wait to get our food. My friend who brought us to this place has stories of how this same waitress would bring her hot tea with lemon when she was feeling ill.  I believe it. And I'd gladly come back next time."}
{"text":"Alright, Courier.  We meet again.  I've gone a few more times and your staff has upped its game, even the older gentleman in the front is a LOT nicer.  I've come here 2-3 times late on a Saturday night just to read, and they don't give me a hard time and keep the coffee coming.  And yes, it is all about those shakes.  No, seriously.  It is.  They're delicious, and you can combine flavors.  Sometimes I leave my house to go for the 20 minute walk for a milkshake.  It brings this boy to the cafe."}
{"text":"Went here for a date and we ordered fish tacos and the deep fried shrimp. The fish tacos we're unappetizing. My date could not even finished one, and she's usually not picky. The fish was fried, had no taste, and was spongy. They also smothered the tacos with some creamy sauce. The shrimp was okay but not not good enough so that I would get it again. I've heard good things about their shakes though"}
{"text":"Like nifty c., I just do not understand the love. I've perhaps gone once for breakfast, and then two years later, once for lunch, and absolutely nothing I ate inspired me to return. In fact, I can't even remember what I've had there, it was so unmemorable. I'm guessing that I had at least the hash browns, because I am always in search of perfect hash browns, but I can make much better from freshly grated potatoes at home without the sinking feeling of disappointment to accompany them."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, something for everyone. Also very kid friendly. Lots of vegetarian options, and something for every taste. A piece of old town urbana."}
{"text":"It was delicious. I wish I would have gotten a booth though. I was quite envious of others with a booth I'll have to take a friend next time. I love how close it is to my barber shop. I however do not appreciate that it serves beverage alcohol."}
{"text":"Good.  Even very good.  But not quite great.  The hamburgers are good.  Most sandwiches are good.  The sweet potato fries are the highlight of the menu.  A very solid cafe.  Desserts look mostly homemade (in a good way).  Ice cream choices, sundaes and shakes, are good and the portions are quite large.  The ambience is classic and quaint.  I can't really put my finger on what is holding Courier from being excellent, except that it's the little things that aren't quite perfect.  For example, getting a seat in the first quadrant of the cafe on a winter day can be quite drafty, even chilly, as patrons enter and exit.  It can be a little noisy at times, probably because of the hardwood floors and tin ceilings.  And the booths have weird proportions.  Seats too close to tables and tables too high.  All these things add charm, but can make it uncomfortable also.  Overall, worth a visit, but not quite living up to its potential."}
{"text":"Being going here for years. Good food...I think it's a little $$ for the money. Just don't like paying that much for average stuff. Got a good vibe here...everyone friendly, atmosphere is pure \" The Daily Planet starring Superman\" type. The cakes for breakfast are good intro piece if ya wanna visit. Take a 1965 calendar with you and you'll feel right at home."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast menu, it is a favorite of ours for that. Lunch and onward is more average. I recommend the charritos or the milkshakes."}
{"text":"My first visit to Courier this century. While we were regulars when we lived in Urbana in the 80's and 90's, we stopped going once we moved out of town. The first thing to mention in this review is that it has not changed one bit. And that is not a bad thing. Everything except the parking was exactly as we remembered. Parking has improved! They now have free parking adjacent the building.  But the antiques decorating the diner, the menu, even the wallpaper are the same.   Courier has good, diner style but high quality food. And, as I said, the menu has not changed, so don't go looking for the latest food trend here. It is pancakes, omelets, eggs, wraps, etc., for breakfast (which I think is served all day), and hamburgers, sandwiches, steaks, fish, chicken, salads, etc. for lunch and dinner. Some dinner items, such as trout, are not available until evening hours.   OK, so the food is basic, but it is excellent, and it has Courier's unique twist. When I was in my decade long vegetarian phase the \"veggie dagwood\" was a go-to lunch favorite. It was huge. Often we took half home.  The Courier uses fresh and excellent quality fruits, vegetables, and meats. (I don't know if they are sourced locally or not.)   For dinner last night I had the grilled pork tenderloin with a baked sweet potato and a trip to the salad bar. My wife had the Trout Courier, also with a sweet potato and salad bar. Service was quick, attentive, and the waitress very helpful and cheerful. She seemed like she was happy to be there. The salad bar, as others have mentioned, is terrific. Lots of choices and everything fresh. In addition to the usual, it includes things liked chopped salami, marinated tofu, spicy black beans, pasta salads, tuna salad and chunk tuna, etc. It has mung beans, several kinds of mushrooms, several kinds of slaws, and numerous dressing choices. It also comes with a piece of bread or a roll.  If it is not a part of your dinner, you pay for the salads by the pound (ounce, actually). The only complaint comes from my wife, who found the things at the top of the bar a bit hard to reach. But, there is someone there to help you if need be.   The bread was a whole grain, kind of nutty tasting bread that was warm and delicious.  Our meal came just as we were finishing the salads. The pork tenderloin was grilled with prominent grill marks for those who care. There were three pieces about four inches in diameter and about 1/3 inch thick.  The tenderloin had barbeque sauce squeezed onto it out of a squeeze bottle in a zig-zag pattern. The sauce was a citrusy bourbon sauce of some kind.  It was plenty to eat. and more importantly, it was perfectly done. Still moist and tasty, but done through and through the way most people prefer pork. My wife's trout was a whole trout, debobed and butterflied, roasted and topped with light  butter and lemon sauce. It also came with a lemon wedge or two. We've always liked the trout there!  The baked sweet potatoes were huge! Probably a pound each. They came with butter, sour cream, and brown sugar, but ours were so good that neither of us used those condiments. They were so well done and moist that you could eat them with a spoon once you cut them open. It was almost like mashed sweet potato inside a skin. If you prefer your sweet potato harder, this may not be the right choice, but we thought they were delicious.  For desert my wife had what she always had in the past, the misprint sundae (\"so cheap you'll think it's a misprint\"}. It is a good, and good sized sundae of vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate topping. Both the ice cream and the chocolate are high quality. And we have a sentimental attachment to it: the misprint sundae was the first ice cream our daughter ever had when she was young.   The restaurant is good for families, even families with babies. It can be noisy, so perhaps not sleeping babies. But they always were kind to our kids and, from what we saw, continue to welcome patrons bringing even young kids. There are plenty of kid friendly items on the menu. The same goes for vegetarian friendly items. But that doesn't mean the steak lover won't be happy either. And they have a large choice of burgers for that crowd as well.  All in all we were very happy to return. Between the food, the décor, and our memories, it was a great visit.  I especially recommend Courier to former students returning to town after many years as it will put to rest your disappointment at how much town has changed."}
{"text":"Ambiance 5/5: Definitely a historical diner feel. The designers decorated the restaurant with many pieces of historical memorabilia: old cash registers, old clocks, and newspaper clippings. There is also a beautiful mural in the parking lot.  Food 4/5: I got the \"famous\" Courier Reuben and a lemon-lime phosphate soda. The bread was crisp and Swiss cheese warm and gooey. The beef was a bit dry, but nothing that couldn't be fixed by the tangy dressing that came with it. The phosphate was sweet and delicious, especially the nice layer of whipped cream on top :)  Service 4/5: No wait for seating and about a 20 minute wait for food (though we did come at an off-hour: around 2:00 PM on a Sunday)."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch spot!   Stopped by just before noon on a Friday and was able to get in right away.   The ambiance is great - casual and historic...not at all stuffy given its location in an historic building.  Had a corned beef on rye along with bowl of soup.  The sandwich was well piled but not overly so.  The chosen chili soup was huge - also very creamy which is different than I make it but was excellent!  Service was friendly and fast."}
{"text":"tried breakfast, and it gets an extra star. It's worth the wait for breakfast - pancakes are good."}
{"text":"Adorable place! Historic building oozing with charm. Food was good and service was great! Full menu including vegan options. Win!"}
{"text":"Some things never change. The Courier Cafe is one of them.  I lived down here in C-U about 6 years ago and just moved back down here about a month ago. One of my friends suggested that we get a bite to eat here before checking out a play at the Station Theatre. I said sure, why not , haven't been there in ages.  Anyway, the service was great. The pay as you go salad bar was reasonably priced and well stocked. I ordered a quesadilla which was good but not great and my friend had a buffalo chicken wrap that was also good but not great. There was nothing wrong with the food or service but besides the cute ambience there's nothing special about this place. I hear the milkshakes are amazing though."}
{"text":"This cafe was open late which was much appreciated! The staff was friendly and new the menu well. Both my co worker and I ordered items that the server suggested, and they were both delicious! Great amount of food for the affordable price tag. The building it is in, is old and has a lot of character. It was my first trip to the area so I liked the location and the character this place had."}
{"text":"Was back home for a week, recently, and had to stop in to one of my all-time favs, Courier Cafe!   Have been on a super-awesome-diet for a bit, now, though, so instead of my usual (the bacon cheeseburger (and even _I_ can't believe I found the strength not to order that one!!)), I decided upon a healthier option-- the trout with a visit to the salad bar.  Disappointment, upon disappointment for this poor meal.    The trout was cooked in what was supposed to be a lemon-like sauce.  Now, normally, if I've had trout, it's either cooked crispy in the skin, or filleted out of the skin, and cooked in the sauce.  Not for this unfortunate creature.  What I got was a piece of trout cooked in the skin, but steeped in the sauce, so much so that the skin had become rubbery and chewy.  The \"lemon\" flavor was so absent, that all I was left with was an incredibly FISHY piece of fish (which is never really a plus for me), in a gelatinous, plasticy skin.    I did my best with it, but it was a disappointment.  I have to expect that Courier has cooked harder dishes (with Silvercreek in the family!!), so... I don't think it was out of the realm to imagine they'd do a good piece of fish!   The rest of the table was pretty happy, though.    My trip to the salad bar was less disappointing, but wilted lettuce, and the inability to get to the items I wanted on the bar (most of the healthy options are waaaaaaay toooooo farrrrr in the back, and grossly out of reach from the average grabber) made the salad blucky, too!    FLERB."}
{"text":"I lived in Champaign twice within a decade for graduate school at UIUC. Without a doubt, I considered the Courier a go-to spot. It was great for weekend meals in an unstuffy environment with friends as well as for family gettogethers. Thanks for the memories, Courier. If you're looking for a good salad bar, this is the spot."}
{"text":"Had the quesadilla and it was good. Loved the old school atmosphere to the place! Also had the fizzy phosphate drink which was quite unique :)"}
{"text":"I came here yesterday for lunch with my brother. He got coffee and I got hot chocolate. Both came out quickly and tasted good. I got the turkey club sandwich and I added sprouts (which was an additional 75 cents? I thought that was just a tad too much) and the subtotal for my sandwich was then $8. I can't complain though because I saved the other half of the sandwich for dinner since the portions were pretty big. My brother went to the salad bar and it's only 32 cents per ounce, so his whole plate was less than $5! That was pretty awesome."}
{"text":"The food was great... At least what we got of our order. The waitress was sooooo extremely terrible it ruined the entire meal. She took our drink orders and never brought our drinks. I had to ask another waitress if she could get them. Ours never noticed and didn't even ask or bring refills. Our food came out, awesome let's eat! Oh wait no condiments, she leave and forgets until we hear someone ask her if she is checking on her table. She come over and asked how everything was. Well we are still waiting on condiments. She runs off to get them and brings back the wrong mustard and forgets the mayo. Did I mention I'm still waiting on my milkshake..... Oh look here's the bill and I have no milkshake. Oh look she did charge me for it as well as an extra burger and fries and a salad that we had but she mixed up the ticket with the other couple we had dinner with. It was just an awful meal because our server couldn't do anything. But we did leave a tip... To the other waitress who brought us drinks and refills even though we were not her table."}
{"text":"Our whole family loves Courier Cafe. We've been coming here for 14 years and have never had a bad meal.  Breakfast? Outstanding. Great eggs, pancakes and out of this world jam. Lunch? Burgers that fill you up, soup that makes me want to come back. Dinner? Great specials, comfort meals that say relax, you're at home. Late night snacks? You bet. Ice cream and pie that satisfy whether the Illini have won or not.  Friendly service, honest ingredients all add up to a fabulous restaurant.   But don't come here, it's hard enough to get a table now."}
{"text":"Great service and food.   I love coming here for breakfast. Even if it is crowded it usually doesn't take long. They have awesome egg dishes and a really yummy cinnamon roll as well. They keep your coffee cup full but it isn't a very strong brew.   They also have great dishes for other meals as well. Of special note is their salad bar, which is very affordable (you pay by the ounce) and boasts a wide selection."}
{"text":"I was really not that impressed with the food. I had a burger and it was ok. I ordered the sweet potatoe fries thinking they were fries but they are actually chips. I don't think I would go there again for the food."}
{"text":"Courier Cafe is a no-frills, simple food at decent prices kind of place.   Service was sweet (+1 star), and there seemed to be a lot of elderly regulars hanging out, which made the waitresses have zero urgency. I definitely would have preferred something at a quicker pace, but that's because we had plans afterwards. Come here when you're at more of a leisurely pace.   I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki sandwich and asked for advice on bread choice. She said she loved Multigrain so I went with it! I regret not taking a picture, but it was simply two pieces of bread, slightly toasted, with a piece of grilled chicken on top. No lettuce, tomatoes, pickle, cheese, mayo, NADA. I used the thousand island dressing from my boyfriend's sandwich and ketchup (yes, desperate times call for desperate measures) to flavor my sandwich. Fries- aka potato wedges- were $1 (+1 star because I LOVE potato wedges). My boyfriend and I split them, but the portion was small and I should have just gotten my own.  The milkshakes though- THE BOMB DOT COM. We ordered a chocolate milkshake and it was thick and luscious (+1 star). Better than other milkshakes I've had at an ice cream shoppe that specializes in them!   Would I come back to Courier Cafe? ABSOLUTELY for their milkshakes; I would skip lunch next time though!"}
{"text":"Courier Cafe is THE place to eat in downtown Urbana for American food. I also LOVE the decor. Walking in you feel like you've stepped back in time to the early 1900's. They even have antiques on display from the original newspaper press! I especially love the antique brass register and old-style crane gumball machine!  Their menu has the traditional options like burgers, sandwiches, and dinner plates, but they also have a lot of vegetarian options and 1900's-style drinks and entrees. The phosphate is super good and so are the potato skins! And if you're a fan of salad bars you're in luck- Courier's is both cheap and delicious with a lot of unique toppings to choose from. Your salad even comes with warm bread and butter!  The service at Courier has always been great, the wait never long, and the atmosphere is certainly enjoyable. I highly recommend Courier Cafe to anyone looking for an American dining experience!"}
{"text":"really great place for simple brunch or lunch! I love the famous rueben sandwiches!"}
{"text":"One of my absolute favorites in CU, Courier Cafe is the best place to relax and get some delicious American food. Old fashioned soda fountain favorites like phosphates and malt shakes make this place unique, but nearly everything is good. Sandwiches are on fresh bread,  and burgers are thick and hearty. There are a lot of vegetarian options- my favorite is the pesto grilled swiss on sourdough. I also love the ham melt on a fresh croissant. For dessert I recommend sharing a headliner, a monstrously delicious sundae drenched in hot fudge.  For the quality of food you get, this place is actually a bargain. I'd prefer it over most of CU's \"fine dining\" establishments any day. Service can be slightly slow, but overall this is one of my favorite places to enjoy after a difficult test or a arduous paper-writing spree."}
{"text":"We tried Courier Cafe on the recommendation of a friend, and were happy we did. This is a delightful little restaurant, done up in turn of the century decor, with fun antiques and pieces from that time period. We were in for breakfast this morning...I was told to go early or wait, and I'm glad we arrived before 8 am, as there was a line when we left an hour later. Service here is cheerful, friendly and professional, and both the hostess and waitress greeted us when we entered. We skipped the homemade pastries and muffins, as they're not on the diet right now, but they looked great. I had an omelet with spinach, mushrooms and cheddar and it was very good, with very fresh veggies. The hash browns they serve are delicious...crispy without and fluffy within. They make their own bread and I tried the cinnamon toast, which was a white bread that my baker husband says was brioche dough, and made for some great toast. He tried the oatmeal with fresh berries and walnuts, which was made with whole oats. The regular size is a very good sized serving of oats...you can get a half order if you're appetite is smaller. I asked of they use real butter...I'll order my toast dry before I'll eat margarine...and she assured me they do, which I greatly appreciate. Two thumbs way up for this delish breakfast. I'll be back for lunch."}
{"text":"I realize that everyone has an off day and today MUST have been the day for Courier Café. My wife and I have been eating here for almost a decade and could never remember a bad experience.  Here is a question for the readers of this review... Have you ever tried to eat a baked potato with mayo instead of sour cream? Sounds disgusting don't it? How you can mistake mayo for sour cream, I do not know. Needless to say the baked potato never got ate.  Wasn't going to say anything and mark it up to just an off day and just remember not to order a baked potato from here again. I like the fries better anyway.  But as I was getting ready to pay, the cashier asked if everything was okay. I remarked about the baked potato with mayo thinking I would not have to pay for something that I did not eat. The cashier said that it was more than likely a honest mistake and charged me the full amount. Needless to say, It will be awhile until my wife and I go back. Even then, we probably will only order what we know won't get screwed up."}
{"text":"once you stop going to merry ann's or ihop and get all sophisticated with your hangover breakfast joints, courier cafe will be your place!"}
{"text":"very standard. could be improved a lot more. had the beef dip and rueben, both were very dry meats. deli meat im sure from  hormel then sliced in house. it is very cheap to eat here tho"}
{"text":"This place is hit and miss.  I've come here with my husband several times and have had decent food.... and the service is ok. I would recommend breakfast over any other meal..... their burgers are pretty dry and the sandwiches are boring.  But when I come here by myself, the waitresses are pretty rude as well as the hostess.  I came here yesterday, and there were two tables that were full.   The hostess made me wait while she tallied up a stack of paperwork --- didn't seem to bother her that I'm 5 months pregnant and would've been more comfortable seated.  After I was seated, it took the waitress 5 minutes to come over and get my order.  No hellos or how are yous..... just \"what do you want?\"  By that point, other patrons had come in and she seemed perky and friendly with them.  My food came out fairly fast, but my burger was underseasoned and overcooked.  At that point I just wanted to get out.  So I had to flag my now-chatty waitress who was paying attention to every other table and asked for my check, which she just slammed down on my table.   I didn't even bother leaving a tip nor will I ever return again."}
{"text":"Second visit.  Is enjoyable I think due to the unique menu and the ambiance of the old newspaper office. Rueben and onion rings are good. Wife had the turkey club and both shared the potato skins appetizer.  All good and will go back as there appears many more items to try!!"}
{"text":"a c-u tradidtion since 1980....  housed in the now defunct urbana courier newspaper building, the courier cafe is a unique experience, if you've never been there....quaint brick building with a corner entrance - less than a mile from the U of I in downtown urbana.  check out things like their awesome salad bar, green river phosphate (other flavors, too!), char-broiled burgers, or breakfast items like almond french toast. great, thick slices of bacon. good coffee. the dagwood sandwich - or the veggie dagwood if you prefer...  for brunch today, i had their basic breakfast plus oj & coffee...and nicked a piece of almond french toast off the plate next to mine...ha-ha! (thanks, jane!)  5 of us met there. we all used to work together - 4 RN's & 1 activity therapist. had a blast reminiscing about the old Mercy Hospital where we all worked - now Provena. (progress in motion....???)  whatever...the courier rocks!"}
{"text":"Got to the Courier Cafe at 10:50 wanting b-fast. When waitress finally arrived she handed us lunch menus. After inquiring about b-fast, which ended at 11:00, availability she had to go and check. She returned to tell us biscuit and gravy was all that was available. We passed on  what I could only assume was the leftovers hanging around in the kitchen.  It is their restaurant and they can run it any way they want, but customer service is not a top priority for these people."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, beautiful atmosphere, well run, very reasonable prices, high qualify spices, and FRESH BAKED BREAD AND PASTRIES and they have dinner, the trout is amazing.   I wish the restrooms were gender neutral, as the place is always packed and going to use the restroom would go faster.  there are four steps in, old building not good for wheel chairs etc. This is a locally owned business, that supports local providers when possible, try and use cash as credit/debit companies charge them."}
{"text":"A nice place with a non-campus vibe for the U of I students. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Ah, the memories of entering the Courier Cafe, way back in my last year in Urbana, when a friend had a flat down the street. It was a splurge for me then, though I'm sure that the prices were as low as they are today.   Now, it was time to bring my niece here, the night before she registered for her classes and we took a tour of my old abode, Allen Hall, which is now her casa for the next year.  And I guess it was our lucky day: I tried the coin-op crane and scooped up a prize, she got to chew the gummy fruits of my lucky labor.   I had the quesadilla, which was large and tasty. Don't expect it to have the authenticity of México; I wouldn't expect it to in a place so resplendent in Americana. But the American adaptation was a treat.  Near a campus that has changed from mom & pop restaurants, it's very much worth the trek to get some home-style cooking in a historic, small business."}
{"text":"By far the best place for breakfast in CU, and their coffee is always top notch. I've never had any qualms with the service, and never waited for over 5 minutes for a seat. Everyone's super friendly and I always leave in a great mood."}
{"text":"This place is very good.  I like going for breakfast and lunch.  The best thing is their potato skins, which arent all that good for you, but the taste makes up for that really fast."}
{"text":"The Courier Cafe is an easy place to just drop by for brunch, but it isn't anything that terribly impressive. The decor is awesome, and while I love the feel, it gets too crowded and loud to just relax. Do not come here to nurse a hangover, but do come for a good some above average breakfast plates.  The malts are pretty decent, but that's probably because its hard to get a malt anywhere nowadays. The coffee is fine as well, but it may take awhile to get a refill depending on the time of day. The staff seem nice enough and willing to accommodate, but sometimes it just seems like they can't see you because of the business. It's a diner set in a cafe.  The location is fantastic. Parking is always easily accessible across the street. I haven't really had to wait in line before, but I've definitely seen it happen before. This place is popular, and while I try not to sound too hipster, this place was better before. Drop by on a weekday and avoid the weekends for a better experience or just come by if you want something better than your girlfriends cooking."}
{"text":"This place is so good everytime I visit. The wait is usually about 15-20 minutes but well worth it. They always have a coffee of the day and it's always AMAZING  I got the courier breakfast and it was very good. The hash browns are cooked to perfection and you get huge sausage links with it. I also got wheat toast with it and over easy eggs and all of it was delish.  The service there is also good and the wait staff are always happy to serve you and in a good mood. They are super quick on coffee and water refills which made for a great breakfast.  Overall it is definitely worth checking out, the decor in the place is fabulous and it has a very homey vibe. If you're in the Champaign-Urbana area it's a good place to go!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch and it was pretty good. The atmosphere was quaint and the service was fast. My ribeye sandwich was solid, but a little bland. Overall it was a good experience but nothing special"}
{"text":"My sister recently moved to Champaign-Urbana for grad school, and being that I was in Bloomington-Normal this past weekend, I couldn't NOT go down to C-U for a visit.  I asked her to investigate some places we could get brunch, and she found Courier Cafe.  She said one of her girlfriends said it was really good.  So, we got there and put our name in.  The restaurant is small, but homey, lots of antiques, reminded me of being at my grandma's old house.  We waited for maybe 20 minutes for a table.  When we sat, we were given lunch menus.  When I inquired as to if they were still serving breakfast, one person said \"I don't know, let me check,\" one said \"no\" and the hostess came over and explained that we would've had to have been there by 11:45 to get on the \"breakfast waiting list.\"  It would've been nice if someone explained this to us when we got there, because 2 of the 3 of us REALLY wanted breakfast, and came to find it unavailable.  I was really disappointed.  I love breakfast.  I almost cried, legitimately.  I digress.  There were plenty of tasty looking things on the menu, and I liked that all of their breads are made in-house.  Everyone enjoyed what they had.  My sister had the turkey croissant, and my boyfriend had the turkey club with a cup of chili.  I had the Courier burger, which came with thick sliced bacon and cheddar cheese.  I could tell right away this burger was going to be delicious.  It was cooked on a flat-top griddle, which imparts such good flavor.  The patty was perfectly seasoned, and the cheese and bacon were just right. I didn't add ANY condiments or garnishes to the burger, just ate it as is.  The bun was a perfect brioche-y, eggy delight.  Lunch for three came to $33.00.  I will certainly return the next time I am in Champaign, and try to get there early enough for breakfast."}
{"text":"I picked this place because I thought it would be good for a group setting. The people I traveled with had different dietary restrictions and I like to make sure I can cater to them all. This place worked, but the food was standard. I definitely wasn't expecting mind blowing food, but when it comes to a cafe I'd like the food to be comforting.   My burger reminded me of a day at the park where you buy frozen burger patties from Costco and throw em on the grill. Where's In-and-Out when I need them? They also wouldn't cook my french fries extra crispy for some reason which was also another negative. The highlight was probably the hot fudge sundae but as a reminder, unless you like eating dessert as dinner, share that sucker with someone.   I'd go here again if I wanted something super casual and laid back. But since I usually travel here with a band wagon of people, I'll have to take them elsewhere."}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, though nothing to rave about. My main beef is that, despite having 'cafe' in its name, this place serves no espresso drinks, which would be forgivable except that they serve terrible brewed coffee."}
{"text":"Cute place for brunch. Pretty old fashioned if you like that kind of ambiance but the place gets a bit loud. Parking was very accessible. Lots of things to choose from on the menu but nothing special. Food is very heavy and rich so plan on having leftovers."}
{"text":"Found this gem while visiting in Illinois.  Historical building (first building in downtown Urbana), was a newspaper center in 1867, so beautiful decor!  Lots of wood paneling on ceilings and walls.     Best blueberry pancakes I've ever had!  I meant to just have a bite but I ended up devouring the whole thing!  Egg white smoked turkey scramble was tasty and light, and biscuits and gravy were the best I've had since Tennessee.      Good service too!  Great place!"}
{"text":"3 Things stand out to me at Courier Cafe:  Ribeye Sandwich- Amazingly delicious / juicy ribeye sandwich, must recommend Make your own Burger- My friend decided to make is own burger, ordered bacon, and bacon, and extra bacon. He got 6 things of bacon for the price of \"make your own burger\" Shakes- Very solid shakes, extremely delicious but didn't seem too sugary"}
{"text":"The Courier Cafe offers a great old-time diner feel. My favorite thing about this place, and the main reason I go, is the pay-by-weight salad bar. It's a great way to get a cheap, fast, and filling lunch. The cookies are also fantastic however, anything with that much butter usually does :)"}
{"text":"One of the nice places to eat in Chambana where the prices are reasonable and the food is plain yummy!  Not a franchise - yeaaaahhhhh!  The atmosphere has a lot of character with stained glass and other antiques (some of the stories about the antiques are on the menu - very interesting).  My three kids and I all enjoyed our meals.  The hamburgers are excellent as are the shakes. Oh yes, the kids also loved the cookies in the front case were great on-the-road treats!"}
{"text":"Food-wise I don't recall it being especially different than your other nicer American food restaurants in town. So they have your standard selection of sandwiches, salads, and the like. What probably makes this place stand out is its charming location and interiors, all of which feel \"historic.\" A nice place for dates and groups."}
{"text":"I've been in town for a year and I can't believe that I have never 1) been here before; and 2) heard of this place before.  In the past year I have eaten at most non-chain restaurants in town (no exaggeration) and every restaurant that gets rave reviews.  I was looking for a different place to try and of course turned to Yelp.  After searching around I decided to drive over to Urbana and try the Courier Cafe.  I'm not one judges a place on decor.  I rate solely on food and service.  I'm not a snob and would rather eat great food at a hole in the wall than eat sub-par food at a place with extravagant and/or trendy decor.  I only mention this, because some reviewers mentioned the decor as part of the reason they gave this place low ratings.  It is obvious when you walk in that they want the decor to fit the age of the building.  It was lowly lit and had decor that matched their intent.  Again, none of that mattered to me.  On to the food and service.  I ordered the pork tenderloin with a pineapple bourbon glaze.  It came with a salad bar, potato, and a roll.  I started with the salad bar.  It was a well maintained and stocked salad bar.  The girl behind the salad bar was constantly keeping it clean and filling it.  The item I enjoyed the most from the salad bar was the raspberry vinaigrette.  It is likely that it comes from a jar, but if they made it kudos to them.  I had a sweet potato and it was like any other sweet potato.    The entree, the pork tenderloin with the pineapple bourbon glaze was absolutely amazing.  The tenderloin was actually two whole pieces of tenderloin that were perfectly charred.  The glaze was a perfect sweet that balanced well with the tenderloin.  I only ate one of the tenderloins, because I wanted to save room for a milkshake.  I ordered the hot fudge milkshake.  As others have already noted they do make the best milkshake in town and they rival the best milkshake you've had anywhere.    We move onto the service.  My waitress was absolutely amazing.  She was spot on with the recommendations she gave me.  She was quick and attentive when it came to filling my water.  To top it all off she gave me the excess milkshake, which amounted to 2/3 of an additional shake.  Of course she was tipped well for her service.    Finally, the value.  This place is an absolute value.  My meal with the shake came out to $17.  The burgers and sandwiches are priced from $4.25-$7.50 and the entrees are priced from around $10-$16 and come with plenty of food.  You'd pay 30-50 percent more for similar items in town.  They really could raise their food prices and would certainly be within reason in doing so.  Where does this place rank in regards to the best places in Champaign/Urbana?  I would put it up there with my favorite place Black Dog.  It is obviously different food and a different overall experience so it would be unfair to say that it is better or worse than Black Dog, but I can say that it is comparable in regards to having good food and good service."}
{"text":"A must visit if in town. Has old charm and delicious food options. Milkshakes are really thick and well made. Veg burger is also really good. Can never get tired of this place!"}
{"text":"Went here over homecoming weekend with my brother, thanks to reviews from Yelp. A big breakfast is always a good way to kick off a day.  I picked up a Denver Omelette with hash browns -- as much as I wanted to try the Spanish Omelette with chorizo, something about tequila in my eggs didn't really sound quite right. It was good. The omelettes here aren't mile-high and fluffy; they're more traditional omelettes, but still made with fresh ingredients.  The hash browns were pretty good. Both maybe could have used a little more seasoning, but I was satisfied with both items.  Now, the almond french toast -- if you like your french toast sweet, this is the item for you. The batter was spiked with serious amount of almond extract, and once you pour maple syrup over it... watch out! Still, it was very good.   What few sips I had of the New York Egg Cream were also quite good. The chocolate flavor was pretty good (perhaps not as dark as I prefer, but... I have no idea what a New York Egg Cream is supposed to taste like) and also very sweet.  For a basic breakfast, I wasn't blown away, but I would definitely go back to Courier Cafe for a good breakfast the next time I visit Urbana."}
{"text":"Courier Cafe is one of my favorite places in Urbana! They have the best ice cream sundae in town.. THE MISPRINT.. Its small and the perfect size for desert--(And its under $4) I feel this is a great date place or conversation place because you could just order shakes and nothing else and stay for hours without being rushed out by wait staff.  They also have incredible shakes, and rueben sandwiches."}
{"text":"Our waitress was very friendly and on her game with refills (a big deal to me, I drink a LOT of tea when I eat)  But the food was not good.  I ordered biscuits & gravy - one of my favorite breakfast items EVER, only to be extremely disappointed that yellow turkey gravy was being used, instead of traditional white pepper gravy.  This was the only time I've ever experienced such a substitution of gravy in such a staple breakfast dish, and it just tasted awful.  I noticed that the menu made no mention of such a deviation from the norm, so when I questioned an employee who was walking by (apparently some sort of manager?) her response was simply \"That's what real biscuits & gravy is\".  I suppose Courier Cafe is the only restaurant in the entire country that thinks this?  Who knows.  I've never seen anyone make it this way before, which isn't a big deal, but the persons attitude that I spoke to was very condescending and rude.  This place would have scored lower based on that alone, but they earned a extra star because our waitress was so amazing."}
{"text":"Their cheese quesadilla is to die for! Yumm, can't wait to go back again. Great atmosphere and service"}
{"text":"If you are in Champaign or Urbana, go to the Courier Cafe for breakfast/brunch. It was delicious and delightful. Their homemade breads were so satisfying. All of the breakfast dishes were standard but just had that home cooked feeling. I would eat their regularly if I lived there. Try the biscuits and gravy and try the sourdough bread."}
{"text":"i've had decidedly mixed experiences at courier.  my first time included being too loud and being rudely, but passive aggressively kicked out.  its a complication situation to get into, but i believe my good friend t.j. explains it all in his first review.  in any case, courier is a good place to go if you want to feel like your in a neighborhood place that is so established that sometimes the service might suck. and sometimes the food might suck. even the coffee might suck.  to couriers credit, when the food and drink doesnt suck its delicious.  but they have KILLER thick lovely milkshakes, and absolutely delicious chorizo topped potato skins always.  everything else is a hit or miss, but doesn't that just make the dining experience so much more fun?   ok, i might be stretching it a little but i do love courier because i think at this point, i could not live without a little chocolate malt goodness in my life every once in a while.  what can i say? i'm hooked."}
{"text":"The very first restaurant I ever ate at in Champagne-Urbana.  Dug it 26 years ago when I was a young naive (about to be) U of I student.  Dug it tonight as a dad when I returned with the two kids, wife and their friend.  It took 26 years to finally see the kids menu and it was incredible.  Not sure if the menu or price has changed in those 26 year.  Everything is great about the place, great serving sizes, great ambiance and vibe, friendly staff, maybe best salad bar in CU and great deserts.  For the $4.50/kid item I was happy to see how great the entree size and quality was.  Was shocked to see the desert was a whole sundae (not just a scope of ice cream) OR a HUGE cookie (HUGE for my standards).  If you are in CU, definitely worth a stop.  The downtown Champaign area seems to have become the \"cool\" place to have dinner, maybe a good thing as it may be keeping the crowds (and wait) down."}
{"text":"We were in town on business Friday and I wanted to try Courier Cafe after reading the Yelp reviews. Breakfast is my favorite meal to eat out and this spot did not disappoint! The service was a little slow to start, but after our order was taken, the food was delivered quickly and perfectly prepared. I ordered scrambled eggs with cheese, bacon, and whole grain bread toast. OMG, the bread was to die for! Husband ordered basted eggs, bacon, and rye toast. We considered the hash browns -- they smelled wonderful in the kitchen -- but are trying to watch our waistlines, so passed on potatoes this trip. They were working on setting up the lunch salad bar (it was about 10:30 when we got there) and it looked fresh and delicious. I'm looking forward to being in Champaign again so we can eat at Courier Cafe for lunch."}
{"text":"Lots of comfort food at this local favorite.  The food, unfortunately, is not as good as it used to be and they crowd a few too many tables in the dining room.  It's almost a three-star, but since they've taken such good care of me all these years, and the service is good, it's still a winner in my book.  Shakes, burgers, and sandwiches, and a nice little salad bar.  The breakfast, however, is the reason to come.  It used to be the Courier newspaper, so there are historic artifacts from the old days."}
{"text":"Love this place. Such a unique restaurant in C-U. Great food, feels like the quintessential small-town staple restaurant with a lot of charm and history. Milkshakes are amazing, you can get a huge salad for $5 at the pay-by-the-weight salad bar, and breakfast is a huge diverse menu. Great place to take friends and family."}
{"text":"To be blunt, I'm baffled at the amount of love the burgers here received on Yelp.  Really just not that good.  The meat was dry and overcooked, the toppings were boring and it was pretty small.  The only reason this place received 3 stars from me was the OUTSTANDING soup!  The roasted corn and poblano chowder was absolutely delicious.  I wanted to stop by the nearest U of I frat house and borrow a beer bong to take down a vat of this soup--yea, it was that good!  Overall, the Courier Cafe just feels kind of old (kind of like the burgers taste), but, do yourself a favor and order a giant bowl of that soup!"}
{"text":"The key word here is: inconsistent. There have been times when the food has been quite tasty, and at times just dreadful. Most of the time, I've been dissapointed. Once I got the wrong sandwich. But it was similar enough to the one that I ordered that the waitress didn't believe me. The pancakes are risky... Mostly undercooked or burnt, sometimes plates and silverware not washed well. The last time I went, my friend found a dead fly in her salad. Yuck! I told her to complain to the waiter, but she was too nice and didn't say anything. Needless to say, I'm pretty hesistant to go back. The ruben sandwiches are good. At least the times I've had them. But the cookies look very stale.  This place is a real hit-or-miss, but the food is certainly not remarkable."}
{"text":"Very rarely do I find a place this great in central Illinois. The courier is a cozy throwback of a place with a warm decor and a menu full of comfort food. Our waiter was very friendly and the bill was super affordable. I had a blt on toasted wheat with dill potato salad. It was simple and phenomenal. Additionally the courier offers a wide array of milkshakes and ice creams. I ordered a cherry cola phosphate and it was sweet and delicious. I'm giving them 5 stars despite the fact that the boy working the front was a little standoffish it's okay he's probably in highschool I'm sure he will learn manners as he grows. I will surely return to this wonderful establishment."}
{"text":"Hands down the best milkshakes in Chambana. I love that they still have phosphates, and that they will mix milkshake flavors to your liking. This restaurant has been a go-to for me for the last four years in this town. All their burgers are a sure fire thing. Make sure you get em with a side of sweet potato chips. The service here has always been superb, and if you make it early enough for the breakfast menu, lucky you it's phenomenal."}
{"text":"The other night, my girlfriend and I went out to the Courier Cafe in downtown Urbana. Having been there before, I knew that it was a good place to go for a relatively cheap meal (which is why I capitulated rather quickly). Courier Cafe is one of the older restaurants in downtown Urbana, having been open since 1980. As such, it has outlasted many other downtown Urbana businesses, and enshrined their memory in the names of its burgers.  Speaking of burgers, they are the primary reason I go to the Courier Cafe. Burgers are around $5-6, and are 1/3 of a pound. The burgers also tend to be higher quality than the standard pub fare, considering people go there for food, instead of ordering a burger as an afterthought.  On this night I opted for the Darcy's burger, which is a burger with mushrooms and bleu cheese. The burger comes on a plate with all of the other assorted toppings, including onions, tomatoes, lettuce, and pickles, off to the side, so you can add them to taste. The burger comes well done unless you specify otherwise. The meat itself is relatively juicy for being a grilled burger, and the bun tastes more like it came from a genuine bakery, instead of a store-brand 8 pack of buns, which often ends up being the case in burger restaurants.  Another thing Courier is known for is its old-style sweet drinks, such as its phosphates and New York egg creme drinks. These are sugary soda-type drinks with flavored syrup, with the egg creme being a phosphate with an egg cracked into it and creme added. Courier also has a variety of ice cream desserts.  Courier's wine and beer menu is not very extensive, but they have had Rogue Dead Guy on draft for $4 the last few times I have gone, which is cheaper than most bars in the area. In addition, their bottled beers are relatively cheap, and the wine by the glass is inexpensive as well. Though the menu is not extensive, there is a good enough variety to please most individuals.  For two people with burgers, drinks, and one order of fries, the total bill ended up being $18.84. This is much lower than one would pay for an equivalent meal anywhere else, even a place like Murphy's (which has a similar food menu, though lower quality food). Courier is a perfect spot for a cheap date, where your date won't know you're being cheap unless you let her see the check."}
{"text":"Good salad bar. The rest of the menu is just OK. Rouben and the courier burger are among their best."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, love their french toast for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Really great for milkshakes/desserts and open late, which is a huge plus! Very cozy dining atmosphere with a lot of traditional American favorites for comfort food. The Reuben sandwich is pretty decent and leaves you with leftovers. Maral is such a friendly, attentive server and pays great attention to detail!"}
{"text":"I usually come here for the salad bar, but when it comes down to it, the quality is mediocre at best.  The regular sandwich and entree items are better but also not incredible.  The staff can be rude and noisy if you have the misfortune of sitting near the salad bar area.  If you're looking for something inexpensive and fast, this is a great choice.  Otherwise, eh."}
{"text":"I got the beer battered catfish and the brownie special. Catfish was very very good. Just be warned that it is very hot in temperature. I burned my lip biting into it.   The brownie special was amazing! Perfectly soft and warm on the inside and crispy on the outside."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the place every time I go! Food is great and place is interesting. I never get tired of looking at their menu! And the ice cream desserts are must have."}
{"text":"I dragged my asian wife here saying she had to try it, and she said, \"Why?  Why?\" and when she saw the menu, she was horrified because the food is essentially, country cooking, burgers, sandwiches.  However, it's the healthiest and freshest and best-tasting venue of its type in the history of CU, and they continue the tradition of Bubby & Zadies by offering a salad bar with amazing offerings.  She was amazed and wanted to come back.  Then, I dragged my 81-year old mom to the place, and she was aching and complaining about the steps and getting there, but she left with a HUGE grin on her face and she had a wonderful time!  Best shakes in CU, bar none.  Best ice cream deserts in CU, bar none.  One of the top-3 venues in CU, the old Courier newspaper offices with plaster-decorated ceilings, tallback wooden booths, and a 1910 feel to it.  Very friendly waittresses !!  The only place I can think of that competes with it in terms of a Venue is a cafe near the old train station, but I think that closed 2 decades ago ...  This is a popular late-night place to go after Contra Dancing in Crystal Lake Park, or even dancing at the Regent ballroom.  The food is priced very reasonably and this is one of the few places in CU that is a candidate as a great \"hangout\" ~ a place where you can come all the time, and get to know the staff.  DO NOT MISS VISITING THE COURIER CAFE !!!"}
{"text":"Dessert.  Do it.  I hear breakfast is pretty awesome as well.  Decor is cool, neat vibe, old historical building.  When I was a kid we had Farrell's (no longer) in the Bay Area for our sweet treats and for whatever reason the sundae I had reminded me of that.  Points for nostalgia!"}
{"text":"I've been to the Courier frequently and without bias, I can say it is perhaps one of my favorite places to dine in all of Champaign-Urbana. Small, local, with plenty of great options for food. Whether it's the Banker's Burger, a Red Hot News sundae, a green river phosphate, any of their vegetarian dishes, or even just the sweet potato chips, the food is delicious and perfect each time, all for a great low price and friendly service. I've never been ignored and always seem to have a full glass of water without even knowing they swung by.  The one thing that keeps Courier from being a super 5-star is if you're seated at anything other than a booth, it seems like you're one inch away from being knocked about by any of the staff or other patrons. Don't come if you have more than four people, it'll be next to impossible to keep you all together. However, I think Courier's still a great cozy place to get your grub on."}
{"text":"I'd pass if I were you.  This 4-star bullshit is a reflection of Urbana's high tolerance for mediocrity.  The sandwiches look like something a kindergartener would get at a daycare center with a side of fruit cocktail. Wonderbread with an anorexic serving of meat and a pickle spear for $8 or more.  We had to get up and walk around to find an employee who would take our money. The couple next to us got up and left because nobody would take their order.  Inexcusably bad service, inexplicably bad food. Come on, Urbana, for once, accept the fact that some businesses are meant to die. In case you don't get out much, the Courier Cafe is terrible. They are operating as if they have no competition.  Suffering through a shit sandwich and bad service is a stupid way of supporting local business. Unless you're into self-punishment and leather and... you know, in that case, join the priesthood."}
{"text":"Good food.  Cool, historic building and decor.  I had a BLT (my standard fare when traveling) and the bacon was outstanding.    It was busy the day we were here. Lots of townies, I could tell, so I know this place is a staple of Champaign.   For me, this is a 'can't miss' diner."}
{"text":"We just tried Courier Cafe today for lunch and it was great! I had the Banker Burger and my boyfriend had a beef quesadilla - both were exceptional, homemade quality. Their potato salad is killer!  Our waitress and hostess were also very pleasant. We will definitely be back! :)"}
{"text":"Oh Courier is so fun! It's got that vintage feel to it. The owners obviously care about the quality of their ingredients. The bread is freshly made each day at their bakery down the road. The servings aren't huge, but that's never why I went there anyway! It's quality food at cafe prices. Be sure to ask what soups they are serving when you visit, I've never been let down."}
{"text":"Standard Diner-y fare. Salad bar, burgers, sandwhiches. Food is just OK. Never terrible but never was great either. Love the milkshakes here."}
{"text":"It's ALL about the peanut butter and chocolate milkshake.  I usually get the reuben sandwich or an omelet, but it's really the milkshake that keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"Dear Courier Cafe,  I know you're a fabulous place -- cozy, sweet, with your antique accents, old-timey cash register and high, wooden booths.  I know you have friendly and skilled servers that have been happily working there for years who ask if you want separate checks before you even order.  I know your food is delicious and eclectic with your amazing, packed salad bar and uniquely named menu items like the Monkey Stuff sandwich with bananas, peanut butter, shredded coconut and honey; or your Rancheros Rarebit, the over-stuffed breakfast burrito doused in red sauce; or even simply, the Paperboy, Courier or Morning Edition breakfasts of eggs, toast, hash browns and choices of meats and fixin's.   You carry baked goods like powdered-sugar-topped brownies, gigantic cookies and breads such as the \"Bubby Bun\" -- I know this.  I know that you can make me a super sundae loaded with nuts and fruity goodies, or a Green River Phosphate with whipped cream foaming over the side of my frosty mug.  I know that you have a different flavored coffee offered every day of the week in addition to your regular and decaf, and I know that you sell bags of each flavor so that we may enjoy them at home any time we want.  I know all of these things....  So, why is it that every time I think of you and your wonderful establishment (you won't be leaving us any time soon, I am sure), the one thing that comes to mind again and again...  ...is your hand-dipped, peanut butter shake.  Sometimes I wonder if I should have malt or chocolate added to compliment the peanut butter, but I always go back to just plain peanut butter.  I don't even care if you forget the whipped cream (although, you never do).  Just give me the peanut butter blended smoothly into the vanilla ice cream, in a frosty mug or a foam to-go cup and I am elated.  I will wait and wait how ever long it takes (because I know people line up to partake of your fabulous fare) just to take that first, satisfying sip  and slip   into a frosty bit of heaven.  And thank you, thank you for always making a little too much so that you have to bring out the metal shaker with the extra shake bits for sharing with my friends.  Because you know it's very difficult to want to share this with anyone.  There is one more thing I know.  I will always be back to visit you every time I'm in town.  Because I do.  Thank you, Courier Cafe.  Love, Clarissa J."}
{"text":"If you aren't from around the area, this is the place to be. Many locals end up going here because of how homey and antique the place feels ( in a good way). If you observe throughout the location there are various antiques that take you back to a golden era you might say. If you enjoy admiring architecture you might want to stop by and check the place out! And if you decide to stay and sit down to eat, you won't be disappointed !  They have an extensive menu of breakfast foods and you are able to add a side for just a little bit more. The food itself was stupendous. There was a bit of a wait time since it was packed, but it was all worth the wait since the food was freshly made ! It tasted very delicious and was very well worth the money. If you see the German chocolate coffee on the menu and get it, don't be too surprised if the taste is more like regular coffee. Other than this everything was very positive. Our waitress was very attentive to our table and kept checking up on us.  If you are in a little bit of a hassle to leave just be conscious that the location is very tight in parking. This causes for a bit of delay and a bit of frustration once you are trying to leave. Other than these two negative points everything was pretty great. A very charming location which I hope to visit on the next time I'm around Urbana"}
{"text":"This place is interesting - its too fancy and historical to really be called a diner (in the normal sense). I came here for the first time, being hosted by a long time town resident.  You walk in to an absolute historical feel with historical reads and artifacts everywhere and a good sense of that small town charm.  My favorite items were the hand dipped Milk Shakes - more than just the origianals, but all sorts of mid-westerny cream soda flavors. I ordered Peanut flavored.  Everything from the soups to the sandwitchs were hearty and delicious and warmed you up (especially in this frigid weather) for my next mid western adventure..."}
{"text":"The Courier Cafe has long been a great place to get delicious and well prepared food in Urbana. The decor has literally not changed in decades, and suits it well.  For this visit, the wife and I ate small. She had a quesadilla with sweet potato fries (chips, actually) and I had the potato skins along with a ham and cheese.  Funny thing about their sandwiches. The inside is warm, but the bread is soft, not toasted. That was strange. The potato skins have changed, and I think this must depend on who is cooking. I didn't like these as much as the old ones. The old version was literally potato \"boats\". The new version are more like fries. I was told the quesadilla was only fair, not great. I ordered the phosphate as always, and it was a little bland.  Maybe they need to up the quality of their food again. I wouldn't rush to go back as I always have."}
{"text":"My god.    I was expecting a good breakfast.  Pretty good, even.  But I am a breakfast aficionado.  Breakfast is something I take very seriously.  And I am not lenient in my judgments of breakfast foods.  That said: My god.  And furthermore: Holy bejesus.  Their corned beef hash was otherworldly.  It is, without question, the most perfect and wonderful corned beef hash I have ever eaten.  It was bumped beyond that by the addition of sauteed mushrooms.  This was served with eggs (sunny side up--the only kind to eat with hash), rye toast, and hashbrowns.  For $7.25, that is a metric ton of food.  I'm still kind of full, and it's been nearly 8 hours.  My dining companions had french toast and pancakes with meat sides (FYI, a 'full plate' of sausage links amount to two full-sized brats), and they were delicious.  Not as delicious as the corned beef hash, but good, nonetheless.  I anxiously await my next visit."}
{"text":"The Courier Cafe is a cute little local joint. The food is honestly just okay, and the pie is always served cold, which was sort of a turn off for me. They serve local Columbia Street Coffee - a plus in my eyes. Everyone raves about the salad bar but I was just not impressed - it's more quantity than quality. If you're vegetarian, plan on eating a bean burger, veggie Dagwood sandwich (which is MASSIVE), or the salad bar. On the upside, they have old school cherry syrup for your soda, which is a fabulous treat."}
{"text":"I have to agree that the milkshakes are wonderful. I love a mocha one. The 8 after 8 is a great deal.  But....I have been with a group of people and met with an unfriendly reception when we wanted to eat at the Courier. The manager (I assume) acted as though he couldn't care less if he got our business or not. So...we went to a place nearby - and enjoyed ourselves.  The wait staff is friendly, however."}
{"text":"You have to try their milkshake hands down. Their vanilla milkshake is ridiculously good. I also got the beef stack and that is pretty good too. Decent price and good vibe. Highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Kind of disappointed with this meal. I visited for the weekend after almost 10 years away from campus. We stayed nearby, and grabbed breakfast here on Saturday morning.   Service was great. Attentive without being intrusive. But the food was super greasy. My dining companion ordered sausage patties that were just swimming in grease on the plate.   I had a ham and cheese omelette which turned out fine, but it was also pretty greasy. They also put the cheese on top which was weird (instead of inside the omelette).   Overall, not terrible but not great. I went for the nostalgia, and it wasn't as good as I remembered."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast options, friendly staff, quick service, wish the coffee can be stronger though"}
{"text":"Came with the bf for Saturday brunch...and if you're wondering where a good place to go for a date brunch, then please come here. Only tried the Hash and the Pumpkin Pancakes, but they were both heavenly. Get the Hash (not sure what the actual name is but it's a hash!) with sunny side up eggs so you can mix the eggy yolk in with the hash browns and meat. The pumpkin pancakes have that distinct pumpkin flavor which actually surprised me - was a little too doughy and not fluffy enough imo, but the hash made up for it. Next time I'm coming here, I think I'll just share a hash with the bf (the quantity of the hash was enough for two people!)."}
{"text":"First impression was terrible when you walk in the restaurant smells horrible. We were sat at the back by the kitchen and salad bar. The area was very congested, way too much foot traffic in that area. I wouldn't have tables back in that area we sat and listened to gripping, employees arguing, and personal conversation among the staff. We order a turkey club sandwich and a chicken salad sandwich which took 20 mins to get. Then I waited another 10 mins for my french fries. The food was average and the price was decent."}
{"text":"Courier has really darn good breakfast food.  My friend got the almond french toast.  It was light and delectable.  Especially good if you use orange marmalade instead of the syrup.  Try it!  I was really craving just your basic diner breakfast- eggs, bacon, hash browns, and toast.  Everything was right on.  I devoured almost all the food and that's pretty rare for me.  The hash browns were a particular stand out.  Crispy on the outside and almost creamy-soft within.  Yum.  They bake all the bread in-house and my toast was delish.  There's a case full of bakery-style treats, not sure if those were baked in house as well.  Eggs, bacon, and toast were all pretty good as well.  I was not disappointed with anything.  I've yet to try the phosphates or milkshakes.  Combining flavors for a choc/peanut butter shake has been on my mind lately, tho...  My four stars are for breakfast only; the three star holds for lunch/dinner."}
{"text":"Everything was perfect; the ambiance, the building; the food, the service. We had the pesto pitas and veggie dippers and apple pie and cookies and green phosphate; keeping it meatless!"}
{"text":"Courier Cafe is delicious.  We visited for the first time on Monday evening because we had some out-of-town family stop by for a visit.   We knew my grandma-in-law would really like Courier (based on pictures and previous reviews), but we enjoyed the food just as much.  Each of us ordered some kind of sandwich: tuna melt for me, BLT for my husband, chicken salad and turkey club for our guests. I added the fries as a side and enjoyed them, by the homemade sweet potato chips were probably the best I've ever eaten.   We all had leftovers.  My husband was excited that Courier has local beers on tap that rotate regularly.  Grandma tried the brown sugar cheesecake for dessert and said it was very good. I bought some of the huge cookies in the display case near the cash register to take home for later. The best $2.25 you'll spend this week if you swing by for a cookie.   We had great customer service. Food is very reasonably priced.   We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I have been here for only three times during the past two years of my stay at Urbana but all being in just past two months and I totally repent for not exploring this place earlier! I now even have a buddy who loves this place as much as I do and I am sure we are gonna visit more often here!  This time we ordered veggie burgers (the garden salad and the black bean each) and a side order of Veggie dippers. The veggie dippers were amazing! I really like the sweet potato fries here and when combined with other veggies, it truely adds to the taste!  I heard their milk shakes are awesome.. something to look forward to for the next visit!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time this past weekend (lunch).  All the local restaurants were VERY busy because of U of I graduation.  We were seated in the back near the kitchen which wasn't great, but I think we were very lucky to get a table at all.  Well first of all the salad bar was fantastic, lots of unique items and dressings and the attendant was VERY helpful.  Then our entrees were great too - I had the special (mahi-mahi tacos) and they were very fresh, flavorful and light.  My husband had salad bar and a reuben sandwich and he was very happy with them.  Service was very good too, even though they were extremely busy.  Hit a home run with this one - we'll be back!"}
{"text":"So far my lady and I have only been here for Ice Cream, but we will be returning for other meals.  As far as the Ice Cream goes, the best I've had in years!  The closest thing to a \"proper\" Ice Cream Parlor that I know of in the area."}
{"text":"Dippers + milkshakes is the way to go when dining at Courier. The dippers are fried potato skins and come with either bacon/cheddar(Skinny Dippers), chorizo/jalapeños/Chihuahua cheese (Desert Dippers), or veggies/cheddar (Veggie Dippers) and all come with sour cream and chives. Somehow, these are only $6-7 and are easily a full meal. The milkshakes are also exceptional and one of the best you'll find in the area. I love that they grow their own produce daily and incorporate it into the salad bar.  I've been somewhat underwhelmed by some of the other meals I've ordered, both at breakfast (omelets) and dinner (sandwiches) but the items mentioned above now keep me coming back."}
{"text":"Great place for a weekend brunch and good when parents come to visit too. Definitely gets really busy on the weekends. But good for families"}
{"text":"Top notch food and service.  Try the skinny dippers!  We stopped here on a road trip for lunch and will hit it again on the way back !"}
{"text":"The quality and the price point can not be beat!  The boths are comfortable decorated with antique pullman car lights, stained glass windows. From burgers to trout, and a salad bar with special items and fresh spices!"}
{"text":"Went here for a late dinner in the middle of the week.  Great historic atmosphere.  Good food, good portions, and the servers were very attentive."}
{"text":"DO NOT go here if you are looking for some \"chrome and glass-ubermodern-quail egg topped with scallion serving-trying too hard to be trendy\"cafe.   DO go here if you are looking for decent Midwestern breakfast, served in a cozy(albeit kitschy) venue for a decent price.   \"Woo\" for:  1) Yummy biscuits that are an option instead of toast 2) Tasty-sounding pancake options (including the special that day-- pumpkin) 3) A place that I can get an old fashioned chocolate soda(Hellllooooo)  \"Boo\" for:  1) A waitress who mistook my coffee order(I got regular instead of the cinnamon almond, which was the special) 2) A waitress who slops coffee all over the table when setting down our mugs, and then never cleans it up, but clearly eyeballs the running liquid several times when passing by 3) Regular coffee that was so weak it looked like broth when I added a dollop of cream 4) Cold hash browns(not that I had room to eat them anyway)  I was assured that the service is usually much better--and more friendly. I guess they were caught off guard with the rush of Dad's Weekend? Menu options were enticing, so I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Pretty good mom and pop type restaurant, especially for CU. Our favorites were the thick cut bacon and the old school salad bar. The restaurant itself is a little worn, but that adds to it's charm in my opinion"}
{"text":"I've been told by many friends to take a visit to the courier cafe. So with much pressure, I gave in.  What was I thinking? Even today I still am not quite sure.   I was really hungry and had been looking for something to satiate my lunch needs. I decided on the quesedillas and my bf ordered the pesto veggie pita.  Let me say that neither was really that good, especially the pesto pita.  The presentations of the food left something to be desired.   The one thing that was tasty on the menu was the chocolate peanut butter shake. Not sure if a shake really has the ability to bring me back to a restaurant, and in this case it doesn't.  The shake is what is bringing my review from 1 star to 2. The whole place is totally overrated and looks so unkempt."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere. An awesome place for getting into a great conversation with someone. The shake is very customizable, u can mix different flavors, you will find your favorite after some good digging and experimentation."}
{"text":"This was found by my son using yelp and our location. We loved the mural outside, the decor, menu with the history and info about the antiques. The food was delicious, fresh and hot coffee was great. We even bought some baked goods to take home. I ordered \"The Courier\" breakfast and my hubby had A small order- one biscuit and gravy and sausage patties. Topped off with cranberry juice and apple juice. Excellent breakfast. We were travelling on Hwy. 74 West and indeed it was a great place for breakfast."}
{"text":"We routinely go to the courier on Thursday nights and greatly enjoy the salad bar, chicken, beef chili, and milkshakes.  Not to mention the cookies.  Or any of the sandwiches.  Pretty much everything come to think of it.  The staff couldn't be much more friendly.  This should be a destination dining experience.  The interior of the old Courier newspaper is quaint and fun.  Nothing bad happening here."}
{"text":"Delicious food!  I haven't been here for a few years.  I remember the potato skins and the milkshakes.  Ummm, yummy milkshakes!  The burgers are pretty good too.    So...the reason for the 3 stars instead of 4 is that I worked here a few years back.  I worked at the salad bar area (pretty good salad bar, too).  When I was working, I did see a few roaches.  I must say that since working there, I haven't really eaten at this place.  Roaches are gross!  I really hope they've fixed this problem since then because their food is pretty good."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast/brunch place in this area. It has a private parking lot where there is a wall of art for the cafe lol lol. The food was very good! I love the hash brown the most, very tasty. Also the pastries were also delicious and fresh. Moreover the prices are very reasonable (cheap!). I will definitely come back again if I have the chance!"}
{"text":"Stumbled across this place thinking that it was just a coffee shop and was even more pleasantly surprised that it was more of a diner. Everything was homemade and delicious. We shared walnut banana pancakes, biscuits with sausage gravy, and eggs w/hash browns.  Everything was stellar! The pancakes were probably the best I've ever had! Would definitely come back here if I were in the area (though, I probably won't be, since I was just in town for a wedding). Man, I wish there was a place like this near me!"}
{"text":"You here a lot of great things about this place and I think that was the issue for me, I had pretty high expectations.  Don't get me wrong, we liked our experience, the food was tasty and made to order, and the service was solid. We went for a late lunch, so the atmosphere was dead and seeing  the older restaurant left nothing to the imagination. But there was nothing GREAT about this place...in the same light, there was nothing bad either.  It's worth to check it out and I will be back to give it another shot."}
{"text":"I used to be obsessed with this place, great food and service. The past few months, it's been the complete opposite. Food is horrible, and the service is even worse."}
{"text":"Excellent place for breakfast and dinner. Absolutely love their coffee.   They have always been prompt with their service despite how busy they get.   Recommendations: any omelette, paperboy breakfast, and their burgers.   Salad bar is also a great choice for lunch. Highly recommend all of their soups too!"}
{"text":"A great place to grab breakfast. I've had lunch there too, but their breakfast is the best in downtown Urbana. I would recommend them to anyone as they have something for everyone."}
{"text":"I am quite disappointing since I expect it to be a four star restaurant. The milkshake here is pretty yummy. But the salmon fillet here is overcooked. The fish is dry and burn and just hard as stone. More consideration before coming will be my suggestion."}
{"text":"Great atmoshere, restored newspaper printing facility from early 1900's. Expect a short wait, but well worth it. Wonderful menu and food quality. Fresh baked goods. Nice meal."}
{"text":"Courier Cafe milkshakes are the BEST IN THE WORLD.  Seriously...their milkshakes are to die for. It's awesome because they'll give you one glass, plus a metal cup of the stuff that didn't fit in the glass. Perfect for sharing...or for splurging. Every single milkshake I've had here has been thick, creamy, and full of hand-dipped goodness.  One of my favorites: peanut butter and fudge.  In terms of food, their salad bar is always a good choice (fresh and lots of variety), and I really like their chicken pesto pita. Whatever you order, though, make sure you get a milkshake!"}
{"text":"Stopped by driving through and had a burger which was great - very well seasoned and came with four large crispy pieces of bacon.   I added a sweet potato and they brought me two because they thought they were a little small (I didn't think they were small so it was a nice surprise).   The sweet potato chips and onion rings were a hit at our table too.   They have a pay by the ounce salad bar too which ended up very cheap because they don't weigh your salad dressing or bread.  Kids loved the milkshakes too!"}
{"text":"This place is a cute little restaurant with very incredible food. I had a bacon cheeseburger, my friend had a steak sandwich. We each got milkshakes that were amazing! I had mint chocolate and he had chocolate. The service was excellent. Connie was our server and I appreciate her so much! She was attentive and hotel when choosing what to order. Very good service and food, clean restaurant. Going back soon."}
{"text":"Delicious sandwiches, burgers, and soups plus a retro salad bar with the best ranch dressing in town. Breakfast and dessert are also delicious."}
{"text":"They have the best salad in town  cut fresh all the things that go in a salad nice and fresh .wholmade crutons and dressings and the fried chicken dinner is the best chicken so fresh an full of flavor...everything is fresh and made with perfection. It is made to fit anyones taste and all whole made.."}
{"text":"What I love most about Courier isn't exactly the food, but more the experience. The atmosphere is very warm, and the staff is incredibly friendly. I love the decor of the place, including the little antique items scattered around.  Of the menu, my favorite item is the milkshakes. You can also get custom flavors of the milkshakes besides what's listed on the menu. My friend got a \"butterbeer\" one and just asked for butterscotch and root beer flavor, which was surprisingly good.   I ordered the fish tacos, which were pretty good. They give you a large portion, which is really nice! The sauce and slaw on the taco paired really well together. I wasn't a huuge fan of the fish, seemed a bit rubbery."}
{"text":"I always love the courier, but recently had an exceptionally pleasant experience with my server, Yana. I came in alone on a day that I was feeling particularly down to write in my journal. Yana's sweet, funny personality and genuinely friendly demeanor truly brightened my day."}
{"text":"This is an older place, not quite a diner, but great omelets. I had a bacon and cheese omelet with a half side of bacon. The bacon is great as was the omelet and hash browns. Even the english muffin with homemade strawberry jam was excellent. I remember going to this place before my Yelp days. I'm glad that I remembered it. I will be back on my next visit."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Courier Café many times over the years.  Good food, nice atmosphere.  I only gave 3 stars due to the rudeness of the greeter/hostess on my last visit (June 16, 2018, between 11:00 and Noon).  She made a snarky comment to me when she was putting my name on the \"wait list.\"  Afterward, my husband paid the check, and went to use the Gents.  While I was standing there waiting for him, she asked me if I was going to pay the check. Now she was standing right there, and rang us up, so she knew that we paid.  I did tell her that my husband had paid the check, and I was waiting for him. I know that Saturdays are busy, but that is no reason not to be cordial to your customers.  Perhaps the young lady on duty that day was having a bad day, perhaps she doesn't like \"Senior Citizens.\" I don't know,  but someone might want to give her a refresher course on customer service.  The food was good as always, and our server was excellent.  Thank you."}
{"text":"I've never had anything really unique at the Courier Cafe, but everything I've eaten has been solid, steady, and delicious.  I just love getting off-campus for brunch, and indulging in food that tastes like it was made by someone's grandma.  When I visited campus last weekend, I went back for Sunday morning brunch, and enjoyed the Courier Breakfast - 2 eggs, 4 half-slices of toast, potatoes, and bacon.  Eggs were cooked perfectly, toast was brown and buttery, potatoes were addicting, and bacon was crisp.  Problem with that?  No.  It's nothing immensely creative or surprising, but I got exactly what I wanted and I enjoyed the atmosphere at the same time.  I'd always come back here for brunch."}
{"text":"Stopped in here early for breakfast with some friends that recently moved to Urbana.  I love local breakfast places like this.  Take the time to read the back part of the menu that explains the history of the building.  It also explains some of the items in the restaurant like the old school cash machine at check out.  Breakfast was food.  Pancakes were good.  Service is good.  Arrive early as it can get busy and expect a little wait.  The atmosphere inside is very casual.  Plenty of street parking on the weekends."}
{"text":"I have had lunch here several times and it was always good, but the breakfast was lousy.  The coffee was weak. The omelet was cold, the hash browns were undercooked and cold.  My daughter had biscuits and gravey and she said that her breakfast was disappointing also.  Not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Historic place, quaint and filled with antiques, looks the same as when I ate here as a kid.  Wasn't very hungry - had a reuben sandwich which was very good.  Service was brusque."}
{"text":"The price is reasonable, food is good, parking is free. I like rib eye sandwich a lot."}
{"text":"Tasty burgers, a neat salad bar, and a really unique experience! Definitely check it out."}
{"text":"I am really torn apart by the Courier Cafe . I will go there and it will be amazing all around then the next time I go I will get awful service. For example, last night I went there with a group of four for dinner and waited 10 minutes to even get our drinks ordered. Once the waiter even comes by he doesn't even say hi and is very unfriendly. Throughout the meal we do not get refills and barely see the waiter. Then, once we get our dinner plates he hands us the checks. Talk about being rushed out of a place. I guess they don't want to sell desert or after dinner drinks. This is unfortunate because the food is great. The burger are good value and the friend chicken dinner is one of the best around town. The milkshakes are the best I have ever had. I will refuse to be a regular customer though after my last experience. It is now just a place to go once in a great while or for a shake. The only reason they got three stars is because of the food, otherwise it would be a one."}
{"text":"The courier has awesome food, but the wait time can be a little long.  If you're looking for something a little fancier, you can try Silvercreek down the road.  But this place is perfect for a nice lunch or casual dinner.  My favorite thing to order there is the chocolate milkshake, I'm not sure why but they just happen to make them the best.  Plus, they give you quite a bit when you order it (it comes in two cups)."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and the waiter was awesome. Fresh bread and muffins. The shakes are sooooo good!"}
{"text":"I'm a little bias about this place since my Great Grandfather and Great Great Grandfather owned this place when it was a newspaper and printing business. The building has a lot of nostalgia for me.  So, the atmosphere is awesome (especially knowing relatives had spent so much time in it) and keeps its old charm.  The restaurant owners have done a nice job keeping the historic feel while not going tacky.  We were there for breakfast. I've heard lunch and dinner are so-so. Our breakfasts were all very good: fresh, tasty and good portions. Nothing that makes you call it the best you ever had, but great basic food nonetheless. I'll go back for breakfast at the Courier next time I'm in town.  Have to say the service was outstanding: super friendly, fast, unobtrusive.   Go give the Courier a try...and say hi to the ghosts for me."}
{"text":"One of the mainstays in Downtown Urbana. Can hardly get a seat during a home-football weekend because of all the Alumni that come back and want some delicious, homestyle food. Their breakfast is some of the best in town. Wait staff is friendly and their food is quite good. If you are trying to get breakfast/lunch here on a weekend it is a good idea to get there early because there will often be a decent line."}
{"text":"Courier is solid.  Come for the breakfast food, and if you're in need of a reliable lunch you should go to Courier as well.  It's nothing adventurous - eggs and bacon, pancakes, and tuna salad on white bread.  But it's tasty, reasonably priced, and friendly. It gets busy on weekends."}
{"text":"If anything, get their milkshake and the salad bar at the very least. They have this history to this place and it definitely shows when you step in and look around. Their desserts are normally what I come for. The soup is good. Heavier than most, which is a nice change. Their grilled pesto is fantastic. This is also a good place to get a Reuben."}
{"text":"A unique place to eat.  I dig the atmosphere.  Food is always good.  But nothing, and I do mean NOTHING, compares with their shakes.  I miss them now that I've moved away.  There's nothing more to say.  Shakes.  Get one.  Get two.  They are that good."}
{"text":"This was my second time at the cafe and it does not disappoint! They have the best milkshake in the Champaign Urbana area! I ordered the peanut butter banana milkshake and it was the perfect amount of consistency! Some places either make their milkshakes too thick or too watery, but courier cafe's milkshake is perfection in my mouth!   My friends and I also ordered the dipper. It was potato skin with bacon, sour cream, cheese, and green onions. I didn't expect it to be so delicious. No doubt, when I visit again, my combo is going to be a milkshake with the dipper. YUM!"}
{"text":"I give it 3 stars for lunch and dinner because I really only think the place is okay.  It has a nice decor but the food is just regular American.  They rave about their hand dipped shakes but again, I can't figure out the difference between theirs and Steak and Shake.  I think the menu is simply a little boring.  I give it 4 stars because I think the breakfast is a LOT better.  Be sure to get there before 11:30 for this!  I really like their Spanish omelette (if you like chorizo.. or a spicy sausage.. this is for you!), corned beef hash, and biscuits and gravy (half portion suffices in my opinion).  Oh.. and their pancakes are really REALLY good because they use fresh fruit.  Try the blueberry!  The strawberry is good.. but not as good as the blueberry."}
{"text":"So, after going back to give this place another chance,  nearly a year after my first visit, I was still disappointed. My bagel with artichoke and olives tasted super bland to the point of having to salt it into oblivion while simultaneously drowning it in ketchup. My boyfriends burger tasted like it was frozen and it was so bland that he drowned it in ketchup as well. I was going to give them one more star, this time, for the potatoes wedges because  they were the best part of the meal but they cost extra..."}
{"text":"A great place to get brunch.  Elements of an olde tyme country cafe mix with mechanical elements of the Courier newspaper's history to create you'll-never-run-out-of-stuff-to-look-at decor.  The food was good, the menu was big, the price was right, and the service was great.  I'd definitely come back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I know people love this place, perhaps its the nostalgia attached to it for ChampaignUrbana natives, but for me, its your standard breakfast/lunch, diner food joint. The seating is a bit cramped and I felt like our sever tried to rush us out. You won't find any unique dishes on this menu but the breakfast was solid.  Perhaps I am missing out by not going for burgers and shakes for lunch, but for breakfast, I would not go out of my way to to back."}
{"text":"Courier Cafe is an anchor of the downtown Urbana eateries. Down the street from its sister venue Silvercreek, it is a very homey and comfortable place to enjoy some hearty American-style fare. I've eaten breakfast, lunch, and dinner here and I've always come away fairly satisfied. Breakfast selections are varied but I usually go for an omelet here. It usually is presented with hash browns or toast (your choice) and you can also get the regular sides of meat or other options like a freshly-based muffin. At lunch, I like their hamburgers but they also have other sandwiches and you can enjoy their soup and salad bar (priced by the ounce).   The venue itself is an interesting bit of Urbana history and the service is usually very good. If you want a decent, reasonably-priced meal, the Courier Cafe is a dependable choice."}
{"text":"Went with friends, pretty good brunch place but compare to lots of other restaurants this doesnt stand out to me. Not really a fan for coffee"}
{"text":"This week I stopped into the Courier Cafe for the first time.  We were grabbing a late lunch, which was probably a mistake.  I ignored my intuition that this place is probably only suited for breakfasts.    There were limited items on the menu that were healthy.  I ordered the soup and sandwich combo.  I had black bean soup, which was pretty tasteless, and the chicken salad sandwich, which was unremarkable and doused in too much mayo.  The worst part is my dining companion got the special, a chicken fajita bowl.  Now, let's grant that you probably shouldn't expect excellent Tex Mex in a joint with antiques and an Americana vibe.  But, he took the plunge.  He sincerely regrets this, as he was rendered useless after eating the bland \"fajita bowl\", which was more like chicken salad with jarred salsa in a taco bowl.  By useless, I mean he must have gotten an extreme case of food poisoning because he spent the entire remainder of the day making multiple trips to the men's room.  After an experience with the food here that left us sick, I wouldn't come back.  There are much better places to grab a bite in downtown Urbana."}
{"text":"An absolutely wonderful experience. The atmosphere is quiet but bustling, with friendly staff and enthusiastic customers. Service was prompt, but not pushy. Their almond french toast is pure heaven. I will definitely be returning next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Small cafe with the old world charm :) I really enjoy their burgers and cinnamon rolls! It's also a great breakfast spot."}
{"text":"Great for any meal (I highly recommend breakfast/brunch) and I'm a huge fan of their coffee milkshakes!"}
{"text":"Tourists Treated Same As Home Folks.   I used to be home folks, returned as a tourist, and it's true.   This was always a place I brought visitors to show off midwestern charm. The food is comforting and good. It's not innovative fusion cuisine, it's darn good burgers and milkshakes in a cozy venue. Plus, old-fashioned soda fountain. Where else can you even get a phosphate anymore? And yes, the salad bar rules.   When I lived near downtown Urbana I would sometimes come here for breakfast on a weekday. That was nice. Weekend breakfast is a zoo, WAY crowded, huge lines. There is a reason for that: it's THAT GOOD."}
{"text":"A star for the delcious salad bar. A star for the shakes and soda fountain. A star for the yummy veg options. and a star for huge delicious burgers.  One of my favorite places to eat in CU!   (If the service was better - I would've given the place 5 stars)"}
{"text":"It's very laid back & a no frills little diner. Lots of interesting decorations that are described on the menu. I went there for breakfast over the weekend & got hash browns, eggs & pancakes. I was expecting the food to be amazing, as so many say, but it was just OK, pretty good at best.   I'm hoping a trip there for lunch will be a little better."}
{"text":"Courier was one of my favorite spots for fooding back in the day. The quaint, rustic decor and simple menu definitely shouldn't deter anyone from trying this place out. The shakes are amazing (not too overwhelmingly sweet) and I love that they give you all of what they make - even the portion that doesn't fit in the cup. The burgers are classic - simple, no frills, good meat, fresh toppings, cooked to perfection. I'd also highly recommend the brunch menu here. Alas, it was a rare occasion that I would be awake for it but you can learn from my mistakes and get yourself some delicious brunch at Courier.  For such a historic building, Courier Cafe has done a great job of preserving the past and giving people a taste of the olden times."}
{"text":"The food is standard comfort food. The shakes are nice and generous. They need to have more waitstaff when it is lunch hour, we waited an excessive amount of time for our food and check and I was quite annoyed. If they had more people during lunch hour maybe these problems would not occur. I would not suggest this place for lunch if you have other things to do in the middle of the day. Additionally it is quite loud when it is busy, it must be the acoustics of the building. It is kind of cool that it used to be a newspaper press."}
{"text":"Best milkshakes in CU! They also have delicious lunches and dinners at affordable prices. However, besides the milkshakes, the Courier is best for breakfast, might I recommend the outmeal with fruit."}
{"text":"I stopped the other day for lunch with my daughter after picking her up from U-I.  We're always on the lookout for new places to eat, non-chain if possible, and I'm so glad I found all the nice reviews about Courier Cafe on Yelp beforehand.  We had a wonderful lunch visit!  I loved the old-time atmosphere and I didn't catch our waitresses name but she was without a doubt the most friendly I've had in a very long time.  We made it a little before the lunch crowd and I'm glad we did because they were packed!  Expect a bit of a wait at peak times, as the seating is limited.  I had the Tuna Melt with onion rings and I have to say the food was delicious!  I also highly recommend the sweet potato chips and milk shakes...awesome!  We'll definitely be making it back here in the future, as I loved everything about Courier Cafe!"}
{"text":"It's an adorable cafe with a warm and old-fashioned atmosphere. The food is not spectacular by any means, but it's satisfying and comforting. We came for a late lunch on a Saturday afternoon. I had the ribeye sandwich, which was delicious. The bread and fixings were nothing special, but the steak was perfectly cooked and juicy. The reuben was also one of the best reuben sandwiches ever, with a perfect ratio of meat and sauerkraut. Overall, I would definitely recommend Courier for breakfast, lunch, or even dinner. It's a great place to come for a simple meal in a cozy atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Another good experience here, this time for a hearty breakfast to cure those wretched UIUC hangovers.  No waiting on a Saturday morning at 11:30, we were asked if we would be having breakfast or lunch and were given the corresponding menus since this place has a really large array of items for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I ordered the Morning Edition breakfast sandwich and a black coffee. My friend got the Buenos Dias burrito and a glass of milk.  We both thought our meals were delicious. I particularly liked the fresh croissant that was the bread of my sandwich. The hash browns had a good balance of dryness and wetness, which I feel can be easy to goof up and make them too dry or wet sometimes. These were done right.  Our server was pleasant but really busy. My only issue was with the coffee, I feel like it took way to long to come out. I'm a bit of a coffee fiend and especially when I have a hangover I want that stuff ASAP!  Prices were fair and the food was great. Courier is an all-around safe bet for breakfast and lunch in Urbana."}
{"text":"Somebody needs to turn up the heat! Our visit tonight was a pretty lousy one. Our party of 5 was placed at a table by the front window, which was so cold, being next to the door. Not to difficult to crank up the heat to compensate!  Our order consisted of 2 burgers, Broiled pork tenderloin, fish tacos, and white meat fried chicken. The courier burger was alright, but not really anything phenomenal. My mother had the broiled pork tenderloin, which I tasted and it had a good flavor to it. My wife had the fish tacos, which she liked. My sister ordered the fried chicken but she said it was nothing special and she could do better at home.  The time spent waiting for our food was pretty unreasonable. More than a half hour spent waiting on food to arrive to our table, which feels much longer when you are freezing cold(we kept our coats on and were still cold). The fried chicken apparently was the item that held up our table. You would think with the amount of time they took, they would have gotten it right, but you would be wrong. It was supposed to be all white meat, but instead was a breast, thigh, and leg. The waitress said they must have mixed them up in the back. We took this as \"I grabbed the wrong plate\" but after another 5-10 minutes she hadn't come back. When she finally did come back, there was no offer to get what was ordered, but instead she offered to take a cheeseburger off our bill. So rather than make it right, we got \"go ahead and eat the thing ya didn't want, and we'll comp the cheeseburger your son ordered.\" My sister started to eat the breast and on the 2nd bite almost puked right there at the table as she had bitten into a long black hair that was laced into the batter. At that point we alerted our waitress. The manager came over and said he would make the chicken dinner free and put the cheeseburger back on our bill. \"Damn right you'll make it free, she had two bites and refuses to eat it!\" So she had essentially no dinner and was not offered anything else except a free desert.  It's been about 10 years since I'd been to the Courier and I don't think I'll ever be going back again.  We really should have waited in line for some of the amazing BBQ on the next street over.  If ya don't mind freezing, waiting forever for your food, getting the wrong order, and then finding hair in it... Yea, go try Courier Cafe"}
{"text":"This is such a great place to go when you are sick of all of the places to eat on campus.  I think I loved this place from the moment I walked in and saw that they use the same chairs that my parent's have around their kitchen table.  The atmosphere is very homey.  So the food...  Obviously the shakes are amazing, but so are their sandwiches.  My favorite is the grilled swiss and pesto on sour dough with sweet potato fries.  They also have a big salad bar in the back and you pay for your salad by weight.  They have pretty interesting combinations and the price is just right."}
{"text":"I go here quite a bit. Love the late hours! Salad bar is tasty and reasonably priced although it would be better for vegetarians if things were labeled. The menu has a lot of variety and plenty for vegetarians to choose from. The shakes and regular fries are the best in CU!! Breakfast is also good here. Can be crowded, esp for lunch. Remember to check the specials board when you come in. Luke the addition of the kitchen garden and increased parking."}
{"text":"I love small little shops like Courier Cafe. This is my wife and I's new favorite weekend date night. This place is inexpensive, chill atmosphere and DELICIOUS food.   You HAVE to try the dippers. They are basically potato skins and the prime rib sandwich. To die for.  Alright alright, tried the salad bar tonight. WOW. Who knew a salad bar would be so delicious and fresh. Really enjoy the features from their garden and the complimentary rolls and cinnamon rolls. This place is quickly becoming our new weekend spot. Today our waitress, Shannon, was flawless. She was so on top of it and was beyond kind. I love this place!"}
{"text":"I have been here too many times to count. I have never left anything other than happy, though eating pretty good and relatively cheap food tends to do that to me. I was holding off on yelping this place as it has been done to death and I don't have much to say, other than:   1) I suggest you try the phosphates (old fashioned soda pop), 2) they reportedly have good hangover treatment burgers, 3) their salad bar is pretty darn good, 4) you should sit in the front, not the back, and 5) if both price and ambiance is important to you, this is one of the best places to eat in Urbana, especially for breakfast.  I guess I did have a lot to say."}
{"text":"Came here for a late lunch and was pretty disappointed by the service.  Our waiter took our order promptly enough and we received our food.  The sandwich I ordered was on the wrong bread and I spent what seemed like forever waiting for the waiter to come back around.  In the meantime I discovered that there was also a hair in the sandwich.  I eventually managed to flag him down and asked about the bread.  He took it back to the kitchen and when he came back, told me that they were out of the bread I ordered.  Ok...so why didn't someone come out and ask me what I wanted instead, rather than just making it with something else and hoping I wouldn't notice?  Seems pretty straightforward.  I got a new sandwich and by that time my boyfriend was almost done eating.  After that, our waiter never bothered even stopping by our table again to check in, other than walking by to drop off the check.  Sandwich was good (...the second one, sans hair) although the \"special sauce\" appeared to just be a mustard...maybe they were out of that too."}
{"text":"Used to go here a lot. If you don't mind the wait, the food is pretty good. I used to go for their burgers. The last few times I was there, though, they weren't very good. They waaaay over cooked it. A bit disappointed in my last few visits."}
{"text":"This place definitely exudes an antique-hipster aura. I wouldn't be surprised if the people working here were hipsters themselves. I absolutely love the style of the menu. I ordered a Dagwood which is a 3 layer sandwich that includes ham, roast beef, two cheeses, pickles, tomato, lettuce, secret sauce, cucumbers, and onions. Though the waitress got our order wrong (two of us didn't want onions on our items), the food was still magnificent.   Half of the Dagwood sandwich was enough to make me feel satisfied. We ordered the brownie special. Indeed, that brownie now has a special place in my heart. The brownie special can be enjoyed by two-three people. It is a brownie topped with vanilla ice cream, whip cream, and a side of chocolate syrup. I gotta say that the brownie itself inundated my senses with a resplendent sweet flavor."}
{"text":"The salad bar is legit. The selection of greens was nice and fresh, different rices and cold pastas to choose from, fruits, nuts, etc. They charge you by weight. I had so much on my plate that I had to take the rest home and was only charged $5 + change. I'm all for a fresh salad bar. I will try opt for one if I'm feeling indecisive on what to order. The rest of the group was pleased with what they ordered, two of which are vegetarian. I do believe they had gluten-free options as well!"}
{"text":"I grew up in Urbana and have been here several times for lunch and dinner (hello salad bar!).  BUT, I came home to visit my family this week and was meeting a friend for breakfast.  I searched Yelp for a good place to go on a weekday and The Courier popped up!  I had no idea they served breakfast, but boy am I glad they do!   We arrived at ~7:45am on a Wednesday and there were plenty of seats available.  My mom and I decided to split the Almond French Toast and the Courier Breakfast so that we could get eggs, bacon, and hash browns as well as the french toast.  The French Toast was good if you like almond... my mom said it tasted like a Chinese Almond Cookie, which it totally did, but it was fun to try something different.  Also loved the homemade breads! We got the french toast with sourdough, but my mom also got the honey whole wheat as toast.  On the side we also ordered the maple sausage links which weren't overall delicious, they were a little greasy.  I'd stick to bacon next time.  All around good start to my day and I will definitely return for another breakfast soon!"}
{"text":"We hopped on over to the Courier Cafe on a Saturday night to get some ice cream sundae and more.   The building is authentically old and the decor is pretty much 100 yrs old but very clean and interesting.   The service was ok, the waiter forgot to get my drink. But thats ok, they were kind of busy I guess.  The food was totally different scale ... I ordered the skinny dippers following recommendation of another yelper. The skinny dippers are just potato peals (dont mistake them for potato skins, the meatier kind) deep fried and topped with some veggies, cream etc. Its like a heart attack on a plate and the taste wasnt worth the extra grease on the plate.  The sundae was blah, nothing to talk about. Very mediocre.  Over all, if you are a drunk grad looking for a bite late night, this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Visited this place on my last day in Champaign after 5 years ironically although everyone says you should go here at least once.   Went with a few friends for lunch and this cafe has a nice old school vibe to it and even has a really old cash register. I opted to keep it simple and try the Courier Burger. A really simple burger, but it was delicious and the potato wedges were hot and plentiful. My friends loved their meal options including the black bean soup and salad.   Definitely would recommend this place and I wish I could have tried their breakfast options here."}
{"text":"The Courier has a special place in my heart. In grad school, my morning ritual was to head here with the NYT and chill out with coffee and a good breakfast.  Quite a few years later, the place really hasn't changed. Now I've only been here for breakfast, so I can't comment on other foods at other times. But breakfast has always been a win here for me. I think there are some things they can improve on, like upgrade to a more artisanal toast selection. And, disappointingly, the coffee seems to be slightly less good then I remember it from my student days, but maybe that's my fading memory.  The staff are fantastic and friendly and efficient here. The real attraction of course is the place itself...old school wooden booths, tin ceiling, and just a wonderful homey, comfy look all around.  The day this place closes, a part of me will have died."}
{"text":"I've always gone for breakfast and it's usually pretty good. It's hard to find a good breakfast place in C-U!   A few days ago, I went with my friend and our two kids (baby and a 2 year old). I got there and stood at the top of the steps for, no joke, 10 minutes before the host even acknowledged me. But they were swamped and I gave him the benefit of the doubt. I've worked in food service. When he finally asked if I \"needed something,\" I was confused. The sign clearly says, \"Please wait to be seated.\" I told him I was waiting for a table, and he said, \"Oh, there's one down there,\" and pointed towards the kitchen. My friend and I took our seats, and the host brought a high chair. Someone brought us water, and another 10 minutes later, our frazzled, odd server came to our table. She asked if we were ready to order, and we looked down and said, \"Well.... we never got any menus....\" She came back with the menus, blamed it on someone else, and we ordered our food. Every time she came to the table, she had some sort of snide comment -- maybe she was just having a bad day or that's her personality, but it was annoying. It would have helped if she would have ever brought us refills, checked to be sure we liked our food, asked if we needed anything else. At the end of the meal, she said, \"Gosh your table is so quiet,\" which we both laughed at. How would she know? She never stopped by!  The food, however, was fine. I ordered a Dagwood Sandwich (after the hostess said, \"Well, that's a LOT of food,\" and I politely responded, \"OK and I'll also have a side of fries.\") I got the sandwich with just mustard, no secret sauce or mayo, and it's was pretty good (it was a tall sandwich). I shared the sandwich and fries with my 2 year old. We had a few fries left over, to give you an idea of how much food it ended up being.  The bill was about $10 -- on the high end for lunch, but considering it was a large lunch, it seems pretty reasonable.  Lunch was fine, but I think I will stick with breakfast at the Courier. They seem too overwhelmed at lunch!"}
{"text":"Standard breakfast/light lunch fare. I like the decor ok but the food has never just made me desperate to go back."}
{"text":"Courier is always my go-to place when the lines are really long elsewhere. Their breakfasts are solid - not the absolute best around, but reliably good.  The eggs can be a bit hit or miss, especially if you're hoping for a yolk. The ingredients they use are very good."}
{"text":"We came here while on vacation and the food and service is top notch. We got the Ruben sandwich and the chicken pitas. One with the fries and the other with sweet potato chips. All the items tasted fresh and were cooked perfectly. Also the quantity was more than we expected for the price, the corned beef was piled high and it was really filling. Our server was very nice and quick to help us out. The experience made our trip to Champaign much more enjoyable overall."}
{"text":"The Courier Cafe is still the best place in C-U to go for a salad bar with variety. The atmosphere has a one of a kind, casual, ambient old-timey charm. Now, if they resolve the recent issues with their buns, they will also be in contention for best burger..."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in town. I highly recommend the Mexican-influenced breakfast, but it doesn't matter what you get, as everything is great. Their coffee is also stellar.  If you are a history buff, checkout all the cool stuff they have around the place (civil war-era stained glass, an original architectural concept of the 1896 Exposition in Chicago that is believed to be the only copy in existence, etc)."}
{"text":"Maybe it's just my taste preference but this place has never really particularly amazed me despite being a local favorite.  The food is perfectly fine but it's stuff I feel like I could, usually, just make at home on my own.  The decor is nice and the prices are great but I never feel the need to go out of my way to visit."}
{"text":"This is a nice cheap place to go if you want a traditional american dining experience. Read the menu, this location has interesting historical artifacts. One of their best features is the salad bar. If you do the math, it's cheaper than going to the salad bar at the grocery store! We come here for our winter salad fix. They also have wonderful ice cream and shakes and lots of vegetarian options. Sometimes the service can be hit or miss but that usually doesn't interfere with our good time."}
{"text":"U of I is our favorite University, we love the football, our whole family has gone there and when we want beer and pizza, Champaign-Urbana is the place to be.  The floors are sticky and the bathrooms gross but Campus abounds in places with Orange and Blue ambiance.  But when we want a good breakfast before the game, a really good burger after the game or an ice cream rush before the drive home, this Illini family heads to Courier Cafe, with nostalgic 70's decor and honest food.    For breakfast, I prefer the Courier, for lunch any burger plus the sweet potato fries and for ice cream, definitely the Misprint Sundae.  If you want fancier, head down the street to its sister establishment, Silver Creek.    For an off campus comfort food experience, go to Courier.  Tell 'em the Chief sent you."}
{"text":"We went to get lunch here on a Saturday afternoon. Waited for about 15-20 minutes for a table. VERY cramped waiting area.   Menu had a lot of options. I went with the \"Monkey Stuff\" sandwich - this sweet, delectable sandwich of tasty sugary goodness. This sandwich would have been way better had the bread been toasted. By the end I just felt like I was eating a mush of sugar. To counteract this sugar, I also ordered from the salad bar. I liked the layout of the Salad Bar - you pay $0.38 per oz of salad you get, so I had a filling salad to go with my sweet sandwich for only $2.50! Not a very diverse salad bar, but I was fairly pleased.  The other members of my party enjoyed their meal just fine, but we didn't feel this was anything special. The decor of the restaurant is very vintage, so it ;s kind of dark and has a different feel to it. After reading the reviews, I'm bummed I didn't order a milkshake! I don't know that we'd necessarily make a special trip to come back here."}
{"text":"Not sure what the fuss is over this place to me it was nothing more than poorly made basic bar food I had a fish sandwich that was soggy my mom had a fish sandwich which was also soggy supposed to be one of their best sandwiches I won't go back ."}
{"text":"Went in for a late breakfast today. Had some fluffy pancakes and sausage links. Unfortunately they must have changed suppliers on their links, they used to be the biggest in town and perfectly cooked. The new ones I had today just didn't measure up, smaller and somewhat over cooked. Looks like I'll test out the bacon next time!"}
{"text":"This place had great phosphates. I had the green value one which is roughly lime and lemon soda with some creme. It was roughly 3.00 bucks. We both had the coulter breakfast with bacon and sausage, eggs, hash browns and toast. I would have given this a four or five but the host skipped my name and made us wait instead of 30 minutes about 50 minutes.  My name was never scribbed off the list so I was a bit upset with the unprofessionalism of that incident."}
{"text":"If you care about customer service and being treated respectfully, I would not go there. Servers are extremely rude especially if you happen to go on a sunday and a tall women server with extremely short hair is your server (wish I knew her name). We were there at 11:45 am and apparently they close their breakfast at 11:45 am. Anyway, she said, \"I am sorry, lunch menu only\" so were like whatever fine. Sat there but then we saw she was serving a breakfast menu to a table RIGHT NEXT TO US!!! When we asked her about it, she was rather rude and told us that they waited 15 minutes unlike us. Anyway, when we said we were here in time, she decided to ignore us and we just decided to leave because we could not bare how rude their servers were. By the way, she never even apologized while we were leaving and just did not care at all.  EXTREMELY BAD SERVICE AND CUSTOMER MANNERISM!    I did not comment on food because we left the place after 10 minutes because they were so rude and inattentive to us. Try SUNSINGER if you have not already, amazing service and delicious food."}
{"text":"Service: 5 Food: 3 Price: 1  I decided to eat breakfast at Courier Cafe last week after reading all the good reviews. I ordered two eggs, sausage, potatoes, small fruit bowl and coffee. The waitress did an excellent job, looking over me just enough without being intrusive. The eggs, over easy, were too easy. The yolk was properly runny, but unfortunately so was the white. Sausages were tasty, but not seasoned enough. The hash browns were good, but could have been crisper. The English muffin that came with the meal was toasted well, but buttered too heavily. The total bill was $11.13, so plus the tip, my breakfast cost over $13.00. Next time I'll check the prices on the menu, I just assumed that they were in line with other breakfast eateries. I would give this place two stars if the service had not been excellent."}
{"text":"Went last night after a movie for a snack and desert.   We had the desert dippers and a brownie sundae... I loved the atmosphere, love the staff, and lovedddddd the food.   Plus, they have Green Rivers.   What more can you ask for? I mean really.   Definitely check this place out if you're visiting Champaign."}
{"text":"This is the place I take everyone that visits me from out of town. It's delicious for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, and it's cheap, so price is never an issue.   The burgers are great, the breakfasts are delicious, but that's not the reason I'm here so often.  The real reason is the Chocolate Egg Creams.   For those of you that aren't familiar, the chocolate egg cream, originating in New York (as far as I've heard), contains milk (not cream), chocolate syrup, and seltzer. That's right, no egg. The egg creams at Courier are delicious, however, you should all know, they are NOT authentic egg creams as they contain egg whites to help the top foam up.   At any rate, very few places these days have egg creams, so it's great that this place still does. (But if nowhere near you has them and you want to try, they're way easy to make. My version: Fill a glass 1/3 with milk, add syrup til liquid height is 1/2 up the class, fill the rest of the way with seltzer, stir, taste, add more syrup if you wish!)"}
{"text":"Corned Beef Hash and Eggs is the house specialty I'm told and it didn't disappoint. Also friendly house staff, you will always feel like family in this place. Just a quaint respite from the days travels ahead."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in town to see his parents and Sunday morning we drove here to meet up with my teen stepson.  My husband chose this place because he had been here many times during his college days.  He said it hasn't changed a bit.  We had excellent service, and outstanding food.    I always appreciate restaurants that offer vegan or vegetarian choices.  I was able to get \"The Courier Breakfast\" (2 eggs, bacon, ham, or sausage, served with hash browns and your choice of toast) with vegetarian sausage patties.  My eggs over easy and German Rye toast blended well with the patties, and the hash browns were perfectly browned.  Add a small grapefruit juice, and bottomless coffee and my meal was just what I wanted.    I wanted the Almond French Toast too, but had to pick only one meal.  I'm not in the area often, but I would definitely come back.    I loved their selection of kids's book (see photo) if you have a child that needs occupied at the table.  There is also plenty of parking, both in the lots next to it, and across the street."}
{"text":"Courier Cafe is a place of the locals.  Which was the main reason my husband and I visited the breakfast spot in early spring.  We wanted to eat something homemade and different (and not occupied by college students), but our experience was just on par.  The ambiance of the place is that straight from a vintage movie.  We waited a while to be seated even though many of the tables were unoccupied (possibly because the host was also the cashier ringing people up as they finished their meals).  As soon as we were seated, I quickly noticed that some of my silverware had dried food stuck and even my elbows stuck to the sticky table.  We ordered the steak and eggs, which lacked seasoning.   The service wasn't too bad.  We had a very friendly waitress, who tried her best to ensure we would enjoy our experience."}
{"text":"I came here because of the good reviews. Right now it's not even that busy, but I've waited for my hamburger for over 40 minutes now. The waitress is attentive and nice (thankfully) but I will probably not end up returning. Will probably edit and change it into 3 stars if the hamburger is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Salad bar is good and cheap.  I wish they had more vegan options on their menu."}
{"text":"I've only had breakfast here. I am giving them four stars for two main reasons: the best biscuits and sausage gravy in town and a stellar breakfast burrito. In fact, I won't order B&G anywhere else.  I highly recommend the biscuits and gravy with extra sausage and an egg on top.  That said, the gravy has more sausage than any other in town. It is also made in-house (one of the servers informed me of this).  I also get their Cha-Cha-Churritos sometimes.  Simply put, this is one of the best places in town for breakfast."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3.5 stars. Their pastrami sandwich was good and the bread was very fresh but price was a little steep compared to their burgers. Their hand-dipped shake was awesome, so much better than Steak & Shake. They even gave us the extras in another cup. Great service too!"}
{"text":"I feel like Mugatu (played by Will Ferrell) in Zoolander (watch, it's only 5 secs of your life): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AG7LjVCj50Y. I am SO SURPRISED by the reviews here! Did I come on a bad night?! This place was seriously bad!  I went there with a bunch of friends and it was just underwhelming. Given the lack of customers, service was pretty slow. There were only a few menus for us to look at, and the ones that we got were covered with crayon and torn-- but the waitress was nice.  My friends got the gazpacho but they said that it was fermented (i.e.,  old). I tried it and thought the same, WTH?   I got the Courier burger-- simple bacon cheeseburger with fries. The burger was huge but it was extremely dry like sandpaper. I hate putting ketchup and mustard on a  burger, but I had to just to get the moisture back in my mouth! The fries are NOT fries, they're potato wedges. Have you ever been to Mcdonalds? Fries should look and taste like that. Com'on.  I then got The Headliner (two scoops of ice cream with fudge, peanuts, whip cream and a cherry). It was okay, but nothing spectacular-- Joe Schmo who lives out in the dumpster could've made it...probably faster too. Given that we were one of the few groups in the restaurant, it took way too long to make it.   Courier Cafe is overrated."}
{"text":"Other than ZAS this was my favorite place to eat! They have the best food in town! The pesto pizza was amazing and so are the milkshakes. I would agree with Ellen that there is a lot of comfort food here. There is almost always a wait to get in here but it's well worth it. They also have a great salad bar that you can create your own salad and then pay per pound. It's amazing."}
{"text":"Ordered salmon with vegetables.  Dinner rolls listed as part of dinner. Salad bar and offered as a side.  Salad bar was closed.  Thought there would be a dinner roll coming.  Was told that since there was no salad bar I was not entitled to dinner rolls.    Blackened Salmon n steamed Veges were good. Had to repeatedly ask for coffee and water refills.    First trip here was much better.  Second one won't have me coming back."}
{"text":"The third Wednesday of the month, the Champaign Urbana Beer Club meets at Crane Alley. As we had eaten there in January, we decided to try something near there, as I have never been here, it worked well for \"We haven't eaten here on Wednesdays\".  I ordered the steak, Kridz got pork tenderloin.  The meal was served with soup or salad, we both took the soup option, her chili, me cream of mushroom.  I would normally expect to be given a cup of soup as the pre-meal ... thingy... but, this was a massive bowl of soup. If I wasn't hungry, this could have been a full meal unto itself.  The steak was really good. Kridz didn't quite like her pork. The sauce was listed as a pineapple bourbon glaze, but it really just seemed like barbecue sauce. I got no bourbon, or pineapple. Not sure what was up with that.  The prices here are amazing. Cheap is a bad word. This place has VALUE."}
{"text":"I recently went to courier cafe to try out their special, catfish sandwich. I love catfish sandwich, so thought why not try it here. It was a Thursday special, so I went there with my hubby. We were seated immediately. We both ordered catfish sandwich and a brownie special. Our server was really sweet. Food came fast. It looked good. Onion rings tasted great But I had not come there for them :). Unfortunately, the batter on my catfish was not crispy, it was somewhat soggy. It was a pretty thick fillet for me. The quantity was huge. The soggy batter and lack of seasoning made me stop eating after few bites. Now, coming to brownie. It was good. Is it something I would come again for? Well, no. Overall, a mediocre experience."}
{"text":"This is a nice little quaint place located in Urbana. It has an old school feel... Taking you backwards in time! The service is fantastic! Our waitress was attentive and kind. We came during lunch time so I decided to order the regular race burger. No cheese or other toppings. It came with lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, onions and I got sweet potato chips as a side. The chips were delicious! The burger was very overcooked and dry. The bun also tasted really tough. I did not enjoy the food as much as I hoped for! I've heard the brunch is delicious but the burger was just not prepared well."}
{"text":"Ok diner with a limited menu of mostly sandwiches. I tried to order lasagne but they were already out...at 6pm. Poor planning/ordering. Had a tuna melt instead and nothing special. Salad bar is also just ok. Something my grandparents would have thought swell back in the day. Cute space but awfully dark. Prices are cheap and hours are long. Ice cream dishes and phosphate drinks look good, though."}
{"text":"I've been here twice for breakfast and both times I've had a wonderful experience. The wait is never long and the waitresses are always very friendly. The coffee is a bit watered down but there's free refills so it is what it is. I personally really like the courier water (it's basically soda water) I've gotten the steak and eggs, pancakes and eggs, potato pancakes, and Corned beef before. Out of the 4 dishes, I would recommend the corned beef the most because it was something I've never tried and it was a good discovery. I like the potato pancakes at the original pancakes a little bit better. The parking lot provided by the restaurant was full the first time we came so we had to part across the street at the meters so that was a little bummer. Overall the food is okay but i really like the environment and the water. They have this really cool gum ball machine but it's kinda broken so you would have to ask the hostess for a gum ball. I know they have a salad bar that u pay by weight but I've never been here for lunch or dinner yet. I've seen people come here for desserts and shakes but perhaps another time"}
{"text":"Courier has been around a long time. I know them mostly for their sandwiches, shakes, and soups. They make some really good beef and chicken chili. Their sandwiches can be a little on the small side. In a recent trip back, I ordered a corn beef sandwich, and i thought it was a little light on the meat from what I remembered a few years ago when  I went to school at U of I. That being said, it did taste good. The meat was not dry and it had good flavor, but nothing spectacular. The waitress was courteous and attentive.   Still a great place to grab a bite in downtown Urbana."}
{"text":"Eh...Decor is a turn-off. I understand the antique-homey kind of feel that this place was going for, but...it ended up just seeming dirty and in need of some updates.  As for the food, it was average...nothing great. It's pretty telling if I can't even remember what I ordered; it's that forgettable.   And holy cow, the waitress was beyond cranky; she was rather rude and inattentive.  Considering this place is one of the only palatable-breakfast places in the area, I splurged to give Courier 2 stars, although I probably will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This is a really cute place.  The food is always tasty and well priced.  Lots of options for everyone.  I also am a huge fan of their salad bar.  I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Ordered To-go.   Had to wait a long time to get two sandwiches.  I estimated the wait to be 30 minutes.  The food once we got it was just OK."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to take guests from out-of-town. They make a mean milkshake for starters. Their burgers are great and they always taste great with their sweet potato fries (which I got serendipitously and have liked them eversince). I enjoy the decor and all of the fascinating objects in the building and I like how they provide a description of each memorable item on the back of the menu. The service is always been great and they always provide an excellent experience. The parking (east of the cafe) never is a problem so that is indeed another plus."}
{"text":"We had the brownie special sundae! It was so delicious! Generous portions of vanilla ice cream, hot fudge, whipped cream, nuts, and a warm brownie on the bottom. It looked so appetizing that we had it before going to dinner! Glad we did! Will definitely be coming back!  Our waitress was awesome! She was really nice and honest! The best part of our experience was the hospitality of the staff! It's so hard to come by restaurants that treat their guests with such respect. Must visit!"}
{"text":"The building has a long history and lots of character. It's plenty crowded at Saturday breakfast, a good sign that the locals like it. I enjoyed my whole wheat french toast, and thought the coffee was good. There's a metered parking lot just across the street east, free nights and weekends."}
{"text":"Wonderful themed joint with good food, late hours for a restaurant, delicious milkshakes, and wonderful service. Emily was great, got all seven of our orders straight and out quickly and together. She also asked preemptively if we wanted split checks and took care of closing out all our separate orders smoothly and quickly. We stayed till midnight when they closed, which was a great option to have after having finished playing next door. We'll definitely return next time we're in Urbana."}
{"text":"Great American food place. It's quiet enough to talk with ease and the tall booths provide privacy. The milkshakes and brownie special are divine, and you can always count on the burgers. Their fries are also great- wedge style without being too starchy and without sacrificing crispiness."}
{"text":"I come here every weekend for my breakfast.    The hosts are always hustling.  And I mean hustling.  This place gets busy.  I stood around for like an hour observing and as busy as it was I saw this one server standing against the wall (maybe he was being trained). I don't know if the break down in service is in the kitchen or the wait staff.  I like this place.  They are nice to me and they make my omelet like I like it."}
{"text":"I ate here with my family Sunday morning around 9AM. There were a handful of seats available but I knew it would fill up soon as it normally does on the weekends. They provided us a booster seat for our 20 month old and crayons w color sheets for our 3 year old. My husband and I ordered the same meal, the Courier breakfast (2 eggs over medium, bacon, extra crispy hash browns and a cross ain't; my husband got their delicious biscuit). We got the basic breakfast for the boys to split and they devoured their food. We got milks for the boys and probably could've bought a few gallons at the grocery store for the same price. Next time we'll just bring their bottles. The service was excellent; Jessica came to our table frequently and was efficient."}
{"text":"Went to have lunch at the \"trendy\" PizzaM and it was full of students on computers with no place to sit and didn't feel like a lunch spot, so walked over here and it was perfect. Everyone loved the burgers, dipper apps, soup and BLT sandwich. Would definitely come back to this little place, however it is a little loud."}
{"text":"Pleasant staff nice food.  Usually the first place I mention if someone is visiting town and wants to eat at a local restaurant."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in CU.  The Courier breakfast is fantastic, especially with the sausage links, which are essentially English bangers.  Delicious.  When anyone visits town, I make a point to take them to Courier because it is such a good representation of what CU has to offer.  The coffee selection is almost always great, and service is typically delightful."}
{"text":"I still love the restaurant. It has its history. What's knocking a star down is the slow and sometimes indifferent service on repeated visits. Today I went with my family for lunch and waited an hour for a quesadilla, a burger, and a sandwich. The party of ahead of us had already left the restaurant by the time we got our food. They seem short staffed on servers and I'm assuming the kitchen got backed up, too."}
{"text":"The food is still good, but the service has gone downhill.  When I walked in, the hostess acted as if I was an inconvenience.  After I was seated, I placed my order, a sandwich and drink.  I had to remind the waitress to bring my drink, and the silverware was dirty, prompting me to ask for a clean knife.  Since the silverware is rolled up in napkins, it appears that staff either doesn't pay attention or doesn't care.  I'll try this again later to see if the service improves."}
{"text":"Ate here a couple of weeks ago. Had an omelet that had way too much green pepper and mushroom and not nearly enough cheese and onions. And on top of that the whole thing tasted like old olive oil. Toast seemed to have never been buttered. The potatoes were OK as was the coffee, but after making an effort to come here as a treat, we were severely disappointed."}
