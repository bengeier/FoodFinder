{"text":"So happy to have this new local coffee bar in the Brighton Heights area! Greats vibes and service!! Plan to return many times!"}
{"text":"This is my new favorite coffee shop in the city!  California Coffee Bar offers a wide variety of coffee options (including nitro), amazing fresh squeezed juices, lovely delectables and often small cute gifts for holidays.  I highly recommend stopping in and making this place part of your morning routine!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Stumbled upon it a few weeks ago, it's only a mile from my house so I like to take my morning walks there. Coffee is very good and fresh. I love that they offer a juice and smoothie bar, and the acai power bowl is delicious!"}
{"text":"I visit this cool coffee shop several times a week.   They offer a rewards program which is great .. because I am a frequent customer and its nice to get something back - it's a treat!   When it's time for your free coffee or drink.. couldn't be happier .. it happened this week when my budget was tight.  I was still able to get my \"green machine protein shake\" fix. 

If you are a customer.. definitely sign up for the rewards program - it's worth it. 

Also, there are events held at the coffee shop.. cool - fun events. I recommend checking out the website."}
{"text":"I love this place so much!!! The coffee is amazing, the food is delicious, and everyone working there is so kind!"}
{"text":"Stopped by for a peaceful breakfast. This is such a nice little coffee shop! Lots of variety for drinks and pastries. In the back, there is a fake fireplace which adds to the quaintness. I feel like we are over a friends house."}
{"text":"So besides the Bean Thru this is a great local coffee place!! Very friendly and great service! They don't just do coffee though, they also have smoothies and protein shakes, juice bar and food!! Great breakfast and lunch specials plus baked goods!!"}
{"text":"What a hidden gem on the north side!! It's in a section of town that most people avoid but if I were you, I'd make it a point to check it out. They have an extensive menu, including many different coffee drinks (of course) but an impressive selection of items from the juice bar and smoothies and protein shakes. I'm not a coffee snob but I must say, it was a damn good cup. I had a croissant (probably the biggest one in the history of ever) and my wife got a bowl of oatmeal with nanas, raisins and I think brown sugar. Anyway, it was overflowing with toppings. These ladies aren't messing around. Everyone is so nice and the space is fantastic. Head in on a chilly afternoon with a book, grab a coffee, and sit by the fireplace. You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"A neighborhood favorite. Brighton Heights needed a coffee shop and the owners have really delivered. The bar decor is warm and has awesome local art throughout.
The coffee is excellent. Soup excellent. Tea excellent. Pastries...excellent. Everything, you guessed it, excellent!
The owners are kind and polite. The baristas know what they are doing and always have a smile on their faces.
We love coming in with our baby and preschooler and heading straight to the back where there is a couch and a little nook with lids books, puzzles and blocks. We enjoy our drink and the kids enjoy the nook with goodies.
The coffee bar is a nice getaway to enjoy a hot beverage or a cold nitro cold press or root beer. Food is phenomenal and fresh. I recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place is great! Delicious breakfast sandwiches and pastries and a nice variety of coffee and tea beverages. I had the western breakfast sandwich and it was great- fresh ingredients and made to order. The cafe has ample seating- tables, window seats, and a lounge area with soft seating and a fireplace (electric) in the back. They also have games available to play. 

This is a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I am so glad my coffee passport led me to this hidden gem. They have great coffee and a great looking lunch menu. I had a black drip coffee. I drank it there while I worked on a few things. The window seats with the sun coming through the windows gave for a great atmosphere. I will be back next time I am in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"It's so great to have this place in the neighborhood. Great coffee, well designed atmosphere, and comfy seating. Love it."}
{"text":"First time here and everything was amazing! So excited to see a great local business open up in Brighton heights! This will be a regular spot for me :)"}
{"text":"It's very exciting to have a coffee shop back in Brighton Heights again. The place has only been open a few days so I'm sure adjustments will be made, but so far so good. There are a ton of beverage options from ranging from coffee to fresh juices. What's more, they have an extensive selection of various pastries, sandwiches, and salads. There is plenty of seating, which is great because the inviting atmosphere makes this the perfect neighborhood spot."}
{"text":"This is a great little coffee & tea house
It's a nice addition to Breighton Heights
Maybe even worth a drive there 
It's very open and spacious feeling 
Little tables in front and a very inviting section in back
Many coffee tea and smoothie choices
Including my favorite golden tumeric tea latte
This is the drink of the moment many places 
Tumeric is good for you so say many people 
There are also bagels,pastry,and cakes
Plus some sandwiches 
The service is friendly the gals working there are happy to explain the drinks. Many \"milk\" choices
Great place to come sit and relax while sipping 
Street parking seems ok never didn't find a spot though I had to walk a block or two
They have a frequent flyer thing that is easy just type in your phone number."}
{"text":"Yes, My last view was a month ago but I've been here plentyyyyyy of times since then and idk anymore. 

the service and quality I received the first day were amazing. Recently my Acai bowl is just thin (like water) fruit is lacking and hardly any granola or chocolate. My 1st one was perfect and prepared by the gentleman barista. The girls have been serving my more recently.

 Bowl is just not worth the price. The amount they give you wouldn't even be a small smoothie ugh. So you're stuck with a thin mix of yogurt and acai... 3 pieces of sliced strawberries, 2 blueberries and hardly any chocolate and granola and charge $6. No way. Not worth it anymore.

I have met the owners at yelp events and they are so nice... but I'm sorry. 6 bucks for a watery teeny bowl is not worth it"}
{"text":"I don't live in the area but was working close by this past week. I was really needing a cup of coffee at 6:30am and, quite frankly, thought I would find a Starbucks. This was much closer and boy am I glad! I had a salted caramel Mach that blew Starbucks out of the water. It was not so ridiculously sweet like \"bucks\". It was deep flavored with espresso, just a touch of sweet caramel and a hint of salt. I wish I had time to hang out but had to get to work.

I think I forgot to mention this drink was a lot cheaper than the chain. 

I am not in the education field but they offer 20% off to teachers and school administrators which is just cool! 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here this past Saturday with my wife for breakfast.  We decided on the California Coffee Bar because it was close to our house and they had been at the latest community Yelp party.  The inside of this place gives off a homey feel with lots of wood colors everywhere.  The coffee bar is situated in the middle of the restaurant here with seating on both sides and had a number of different pastries which you could also buy.  Last but not least there is an elevated seating area complete with wall fireplace.

For breakfast on this morning I decided to get a 12 oz dark roast coffee and a Greek yogurt bowl while my wife also went with a 12 oz dark roast and an oatmeal bowl.  In both their oatmeal and Greek yogurt bowls you are allowed to choose 3 mixins and so I went with chia seeds, bee pollen and raspberries while my wife went with strawberries, granola and local honey.  Within a few minutes our food was delivered to our table and looked quite pretty.  It ended up tasting very good as I made the correct choice with the raspberries and bee pollen providing some sweetness to the natural tartness of the Greek yogurt.  My wife also really enjoyed her oatmeal and loved the toppings that she picked, especially the local honey.  Last but certainly not least is their coffee which i found to be flavorful, strong and most importantly smooth.

The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I liked everything about this place from the service to the food and the coffee as well."}
{"text":"I'm sooooo happy to have such a great coffee shop within walking distance of my house! The coffee is very good. My husband is very, very particular about his espresso, and he was pleased that the barista made his to his liking. I just get regular ol' brewed coffee and it's a nice strength (although just once it was a little cooler than I like). I mostly stop in for their breakfast sandwiches. They are fantastic, made fresh, and you can get it made exactly how you want it: choices of bread, bagel, English muffin, sausage, bacon, etc. I LOVE their Western breakfast sandwich: egg, cheddar, ham, bacon, spinach, tomato, onion, toasted red peppers, and chipotle mayo on an everything bagel. It sounds like it would be an overloaded mess, but the staff assembles it so carefully that it's perfection! There is a good selection of pastries and sweets also, as well as lunch sandwiches. There is ample seating and cozy decor. The staff is super friendly also, which makes me happy to return! The only negative I've experienced is that the iced coffee seems very expensive relative to the price of the hot coffee. A large iced coffee (not nitro or anything) was $4.50, which I found a little surprising. I almost always get hot coffee anyways so not a huge issue :)"}
{"text":"A beautiful coffee shop, the baristas were very knowledgeable about their craft. I ordered a soy Cafe Latte and it was the best latte I've had in a good while! I also ate one of the vegan \"Pucks\" they had by the counter. My boyfriend ordered an almond milk Lavender Tea Latte and says it was aromatic and delicious! Glad we came!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood coffee shop and cafe. A real asset to the neighborhood. We spoke to the owners and they are huge boosters of the neighborhood and will surely continue to make California a vibrant part of the city."}
{"text":"My favorite coffee bar in North Side!  I'm a frequent customer who drinks regular brewed coffee and espresso.  They make the best that I have found, and the price is right. I recently tried their cold brew. I loved it!  
The atmosphere is very nice, the place is clean, the baristas are friendly, the bathrooms are clean, free parking across the street, they have a small menu, they take credit cards and they have a rewards program. I really like this place. I never wait in line like at Starbucks, and I think their coffee is much better than Starbucks.  Prices are right on!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!

First of all: it is HUGE! There is tons of room to sit in the front, behind the counter where you pay and then up a few stairs to another seated area which also has a couch and fireplace. Awesome!

I got the Berry Necessary smoothie and it was really good and loved that it wasn't overly sweet as well. The girl working here when I came was also super friendly and nice. 

I saw they have the Beyond Meat burger here. I wasn't that hungry so didn't try but definitely curious about it. I plan to come back again so maybe next time I'll try that!"}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood! I've been there twice now since they opened and very enthusiastically endorse the food, drinks and staff."}
{"text":"This Place has healthy food options, like customizable oatmeal and acai bowls and greek yogurt. There are fresh juices and smoothies, too. The baked goods are from Oram's and Mediterra Bakehouse. Prices are reasonable for the most part. I am so excited that this place opened in Brighton Heights. 

Try the acai bowl."}
{"text":"I love this place. I mean I REALLY love it. It is a neighborhood coffee shop with friendly staff, owners who live in neighborhood, and a menu that is simple, delicious, fresh, and filled with healthy, delicious options. 

I've had their tuna salad, grilled cheese, and sausage/egg sandwiches, tried the tomato bisque and Thai Chicken soup, had the vitality juice, the oatmeal with local honey, pastries, and of course the coffee, and everything has always been delicious. They have great bread options, fresh fruit, power bars and an awesome selection of fresh made juices. 

Please go here, and go here often. These are the shops we need to be throwing our money at, repeatedly!!"}
{"text":"On my return home I decided to go out of my way to find this place. Believe me it is a bit difficult to find since it an entire blue painted building. The only way you'll know this is the coffee bar is that there is a small sign by the entrance and engraving on the door.

I stopped in here just to get a cup of coffee after a very filling lunch in the Southside followed by a huge Sundae at an ice cream stand. I glanced at the baked goods and they looked inviting and very familiar to me. Yes, they are supplied by Mediterra baked goods where I have been a number of times and  was very pleased with their breads and scones.

In addition to coffee, you can get lattes, pour overs, teas, smoothies, health juices, as well as a cold bar where you can get cold brews or nitro drinks. In addition they serve a few items for breakfast or lunch including soup. Oh yes, I noticed a sign where they are planning a high tea but don't have any other information on it.

They suggested I try the Brighton brew which is their favorite. When I got it I was disappointed with the fact that it tasted bitter to me. They, upon request gave me a fresh cup but again found it too strong for my tastes.I decided just to finish it regardless. You can either stay downstairs where they have bar stools or go upstairs into what seems like a cozy living room environment complete with a fake fireplace. The do offer free WiFi here and they will give you the pass-code upon request.  They also have interesting art work scattered around.

They  have a grab and go refrigerated beverage section on the first floor as well if you prefer water or soft drinks. Outdoor seating is also available.

I was a little disappointed with the fact that they don't supply you with those tiny plastic keep warm hole fillers for your cup nor was there any trash receptacle on the 2nd floor. I finished my coffee and left. As I was leaving I noticed that on their side of the street is pay parking. I was parked on the other side of the street so I'm not sure if that applies to both sides since I did not see one of those meters on that side. Please be aware of this when you come.

Prices seem reasonable so if I find myself in that area again I may try one of their lunch offerings and a different beverage."}
{"text":"Cali Coffee Bar is just okay. Friends kind of made a big deal about this place, but, meh. 1. For being in Brighton Heights, the prices of the drinks are too high. I understand maybe wanting to compete with other places, but it's not in the city.  2. The service was less than stellar. There was only 1 other person waiting for a beverage at 7:30 in the morning and I wasn't even acknowledged at the counter. 3. The mocha I had was too sugary. It came with whipped cream and chocolate sauce....not really something I'm up for at 7 in the morning (wasn't given the option to have with or without either). There's no doubt they have a decent menu of drinks and food, but the overall vibe doesn't make me want to come back."}
{"text":"This is the type of coffee shop I can hang out in all weekend. Very cozy and relaxing with plenty of seating. There's free wifi so it's a perfect place to catch up on some work as well. If you're kid like me, you'll spend an hour playing all the different board games they have in stock. The variety of menu items is more extensive than other cafes. They have a large selection of coffee, espresso beverages, smoothies, and food items. I will definitely be stopping back in!"}
{"text":"CCB is such a great neighborhood spot! They really care about the community and they have a huge selection of coffee, tea, smoothies, breakfast, and lunch food! This place does it all! The workers are super friendly and helpful. My favorite thing is the nitro brew. It's hard to find places that offer it. If you're not from around the Brighton Heights area it's definitely worth the trip to check it out!"}
