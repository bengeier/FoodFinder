{"text":"I had the Grecian chicken pita with sweet potato fries which was awesome it a large pita with plenty of chicken .. Fast friendly service ..check out the Facebook page let you know where they will be for the week .. Will Definitely be back really wonderful"}
{"text":"I wish this was the same food as the food truck it takes it's name from. No more sweet potato fries. No more vegetarian options at all. No falafel! Fries are from a package. Would not recommend unless you want food beer on tap. 2 stars for beer. Food is sub par at best.   Any updates to menu for healthy eaters would change my review."}
{"text":"I thought hump day couldn't get any better! Pita wheel comes to my work(manufacturing plant with 250 employees) every Wednesday and every damn Wednesday I find myself buying a Chipotle pita because it's so good! Amazing amount of meat on these things and tons of fries or they can hold the fries and you can get a bag of chips instead. Pita wheel day is by far the highlight of my work week."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!  They are the best at what they do. Food was excellent. My husband and I both had a philly and fries. I normally don't eat the fries. The fries had seasoning salt and were excellent.  I could not stop eating. The Philly was out of this world. It was served on a pita. This did throw me off and I thought I would not enjoy because it was not served on a hoagie roll. That was not the case. It was phenomenal. It was hot, fresh and had great size portion of meat. Our server, Flora, was amazing!!!  Awesome at her job and went way above to take her time to answer all of our questions. Thank you to the complete staff for making a find off Facebook an experience we want forget!!!"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the Gyro Pita & Chicken Philly Pita and a nice cold beer!  Good selection of local draft beers and a variety of cans and bottles. We will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I hate to be the Debbie downer of this place because I've heard so many good things and have always wanted to come here ever since I heard about it. When I finally got around to trying it, I was very excited and anticipated a good meal- (almost everyone I know has always been very fond of it...)  but was very disappointed. I had the gyro pita and I can honestly say that Showmars puts their own to shame. I'd be willing to give this place another try later on down the road."}
{"text":"Tried Pita Wheel at Food Truck Friday and it was amazing! We had the gyro and Philly cheesesteak and we were very impressed. They were so delicious!! The best gyro I've had in Charlotte, by far!"}
{"text":"Great service! First time trying this place while at sugar creek brewery. The pita's are delicious! Great service too. I highly recommend it!!"}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Wonderful food! If anything is ever wrong let Chris know and he will make sure it's made right!"}
{"text":"If you haven't tried this place you owe it to yourself to do so immediately. It truly is one of the best places to eat in Gaston County, and as a fat man I would know. Edit to add This really was one of my favorite places to go get pretty much anything they offered. My only complaint that has caused me to drop from 4 stars to 3 stars is sanitation issues I have seen while in the store. People handling cell phones who are cooking and then food, that's unacceptable. The last time I was in and the time before that, I had issues with my food. I had a burger that was simply mediocre, I found the grind to be rough because of gristle and the flavor didn't seem to permeate all of the meat in the burger. Also had a pita on the earlier visit that was so soupy I couldn't hold it without it pouring out the other end. I would actually talk more to the owner if he didn't seem so angry at me currently. I don't want you to write this place off by any means, I do think you'll be happier if you go in the daytime"}
{"text":"Eclectic, fun, off the wall with great food and service. If you love places that are unique and different you need to try this place."}
{"text":"The prices are a little steep for what it is and it took almost 20 minutes for a sandwich and app to come out to the table (after lunch rush, not during). The staff was really nice though :) It was tasty, but not something to rush to try again"}
{"text":"The fried pickles are the bomb.  Mac and cheese may need some salt but the southern philly is awesome. I got mine without jalape√±os.  Be careful ordering.  I ordered my appetizer last and she had to take everything out and start over."}
{"text":"Whoa! You have got to be kidding me ... I had no idea how good this place was going to be. Chris, one of the owners at ODB, recommended Pita Wheel to grab a late lunch on a Saturday. So glad we went.   After we placed our order, I got talking about this place with the owner, Chris Davis. Totally down to earth and friendly guy. He made \"the rounds\" through the brewery scene in Charlotte with his food truck for two years, having the desire and success to open a fixed location.  His experience has given him an insight into peoples tastes for food and beer. The day I went, there were 14 beers on tap, the majority of which were from local NC breweries. Combine that with a bottle shop feel featuring large refrigerator cases, for drink in or take out, with a really nice selection of high quality beers.  Now onto the food - best sandwich I've had in a longggg time. The Fried Pickle Philly is where it's at ladies and gentleman. Shaved sirloin (juicy), Sriracha Aioli and crispy, tart deep fried pickles. Amazing combo of flavors!! Add to that a very generous side of Greek Style cucumber salad.  Beer specials on the board - great food - nice, friendly people. Just wish they were closer to my house!!!! Bravo guys and girls!!!"}
{"text":"Tried this one month old establishment today!  Food truck turned into a brick n' mortar restaurant!  Fried pickle philly pita and chicken daily special were awesome. Great, friendly staff! Give them a try! You won't be disappointed!  Great local beers on tap too!"}
{"text":"Amazing food! The chicken bacon ranch pita was so delicious. I will definitely be ordering food there again next time they're around."}
{"text":"Yummy.. Best thing around!!! Clean, friendly and fresh!!! Only wish I had a bigger stomach.. Wishing this business lots of success"}
{"text":"My husband and I ate here last night the place was pretty cool it had some business going on for a Thursday night we thought it was going to be a good place to try out well when we went in we went and stood inline to wait our turn while waiting inline we of course was checking out the menu for just a few moments and we were up to order our food we asked some questions due to our first time being here and the young lady working the cash register wasn't very pleasant to us she was rude to us the whole time she never once smiled and had a look on her face that we were annoying her it was not not very good customer service coming from her but we placed our order and gave her our name and went to have a seat we waited about five minutes and then she the same young lady called out our name we let her know where we were and she brought over our order still sounding and acting like she was unhappy about being there maybe hopefully she was just having a bad day but when working in a pubic place and dealing with customers that's not the way to go but for whatever reason I hope things will get better for her well the food was decent so it made up some for the way things started off we were looking around and checking out the place it seems to be a  pretty cool simple and clean place so that was another positive thing while we were eating and checking out the place there were another young lady working the floor she was steady cleaning up and looking out for all the customers she was really doing a great job she was very nice and pleasant to us when she approached our table great customer service from her so great job to her but all together we will probably give it another shot hopefully the young lady will be in a better sprites next time"}
{"text":"I am absolutely floored by the awesomeness of pita wheel this is my first visit and one word awesome if you never been here before please come mouth-watering pitas melt-in-your-mouth number one in my book I will come back again and again great staff great atmosphere makes you feel really welcome"}
{"text":"When I pulled into the parking lot, I was a little nervous. The business looks kinda sketchy. Don't let this keep you from going inside. The inside us clean and has seating. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. I had a fried pickle Philly and it was absolutely amazing. So flavorful. Be warned, this is a place to go if you're on a diet... There was a lot of grease. But it's to be expected with this type of food. Do yourself a favor and go try this place."}
{"text":"I've had several to-go orders from Pita Wheel but just went in for the first time last week and it was really good! I'm a bit picky, so I wish they had some more options, but the food and service are great and the place itself has a great vibe! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great local dive.   Awesome menu selections, staff is helpful and attentive even when busy.  Every friend I brought here ha/ had a great experience. We will be back.."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Super friendly staff, quick and efficient! The food is fantastic I had the Cheesesteak pita and it was amazing. Not to mention the beer selection is incredible!"}
{"text":"Ordered the cheech and chong pita and it was aweful. It was so smothered in sauce you couldnt taste anything else. They did remake me a burger in its place and it was great but the frys where aweful. Im pretty sure they took the frys off the first order and redipped them. I also ordered a few bryson city beers and was charged $4 each. After i drank them i noticed the sign on the wall that said they cost $3. They did offer to give me back the $2 but i declined. The owner was not working this day (05-20-17 6:30pm) if so im sure my meal and total would have been better. 2 thumbs down to the careless staff that was left unattended."}
{"text":"We have eaten here at least the times and been pleased with the food and service.  Good pricing for a faster service and meal.  A little tough to get in during the \"11:45 to 1\" timing as they do not have an over abundance of seating but it does work okay if you have a little extra time to give.  Food is good  Salads are excellent Staff is courteous"}
