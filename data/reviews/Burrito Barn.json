{"text":"Carne Asada and Carnita Tacos were fresh and mouth watering. The red sauce is where it's at. I will be back to try their breakfast burrito and everything else on their menu."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best breakfast burritos I've ever had from here. Ham egg and cheese is just phenomenal. Right behind that would have to be their carne asada burritos which are full of flavor and big enough to satisfy anyone."}
{"text":"They are located off of cotton and indian school off of cotton.   I love this place there breakfast burrito is the really really good I had the tacos today and they were very good.  you have to try this place I will be going back can't wait to try more"}
{"text":"Green chicken burrito is so gooooooooooooood. I will get a burrito from there again for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best mexican food within a 10 mile radius. The service is always great too!"}
{"text":"Too many flies. Food is ok, but I would rather have a spot to sit down and eat bug free. I guess it's ok for take out."}
{"text":"I had the street tacos.  OK I have had better. I had heard wonderful things about this place.  I want to go back and try again.  Maybe they were just having a bad day."}
{"text":"The Burrito Barn is NOT closed, it just relocated. This is a mobile food wagon (check out the pics others posted) and apparently it moves around every now and then. Current location is the SW corner of Cotton Lane and Glendale Ave.  I stopped there today (first time) and had a Country Breakfast Burrito. The service was friendly and the Burrito was excellent. They provide both red and green taco sauce on the side, I tried both and they're both good, but I prefer the red.  The picnic tables are a nice touch. There were four tables and people at all of them this morning.   I'll be going back, soon! I want to try the chorizo, and also the lunch menu."}
{"text":"It was not as good as I wanted it to be. I know that Mexican food is regional and you can get many variations of a single item. However, the tortilla my burrito was wrapped in was crunchy, the meat was over seasoned, and there was too much lettuce in the burrito. The red salsa was good. The service was good."}
{"text":"I think is the best clean burrito have had in Phoenix. not necessarily authentic Mexican but better than your average burrito that I have had in typical Mexican places that tend to be a little too greasy. this is good quality. worth the drive."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today, 4 cars all waiting for food when we arrived. We both had carne asada burritos. And here is my confusion, hubbies was really fat and mine very thin. He had lots of cabbage, and I had very little. He had a ton of unmelted cheese and I had none, or so little it's presence was hard to see. I thought the taste was good but the green sauce was very hot (but it was on the side, so no problem). I went because of recommendation of other yelp participants, and because I was in the mood for a burrito! So, not really sure what to expect if we do go again! Since They are made to order , you may have to wait, 4 in front of us it was about 20 minutes, but not quite as long for a few cars that came after us. We did not mind the wait as the order came out warm."}
{"text":"Found about about this from one of my truck drivers who stumbled upon it while waiting for a load at the Dicks Sporting Good warehouse.  Carne Asada plate, rolled tacos, and a bean and cheese flatbread is what we ordered.  The rolled tacos had potatoes in them, and they were cold.  Like the potatoes were frozen previously and never fully cooked. The carne Asada was ok and the fry bread was decent.  Rice and beans.....meh the rice is bland the beans are refried beans with cheese on them.  The ingredients definitely are not fresh ingredients.  There was no diet soda advertised, but we had a couple of bottled waters anyway.   The eating area was clean.  The people visiting their friends from out of town were a bit obnoxious at the next table, but that is not the barns fault.    The service was slow and unimpressionable.  We had told her we had never been there before and she never offered any suggestions, or changed her facial expressions just sat at the register seemingly impatiently waiting for us.    Would we go back?  Yes.  I would say we wouldn't go out of our way but this place is pretty much out of the way lol."}
{"text":"We just ate there tonight. They are on the corner of Glendale Rd and Cotton. Just as good as always! Fried bread with honey, yummmmm. Fish tacos and steak tacos, yummmmm."}
{"text":"First! They moved to a new location. They are on the corner of Cotton Lane and Glendale Avenue. Right next door to the Old West General Store.  I purchased a pork green chili burrito, comes with rice, beans, green chili pork, and potatoes. The burrito was very big, and not messy at all. I like two types of chili verde.  1) I do like the mild and sweet chili you can get at La Canasta or Rito's. 2) At times I like the spicy hot but still savor the flavor you can get from here. I think this location is awesome, After a nice meal in the outdoors, you can go next door for some Thrifty Ice Cream."}
{"text":"Cash Only, but good as hell! For the price this place is a nice change of pace very authentic good street tacos the red chili chicken Burrito is my favorite so far. Can't wait to return to try everything else!  WILL RETURN!   Current location: corner of Glendale and Cotton lane."}
{"text":"Where the heck did the Barn go?!?  It's missing!  I had my heart set on the Machaca for breakfast.   I am bummed!"}
{"text":"This place rocks!! We always get the country breakfast burrito, it is amazing! There Carne Asada rocks as well!!!! Such great service, and always so fast!"}
{"text":"The fish tacos are bomb! I see a fish burrito too ! Going back to try it and asada. The price is good too. This is rare to find. Good cheap Mexican food in all Arizona is about impossible."}
{"text":"Pretty stellar burrito from a truck, but expect premium food-truck prices. Staff was really nice and the food was on-point. California burrito was really good and portions were solid."}
{"text":"We Love their Fish Tacos & Carne Asada. Of course they have my favorite drink - Horchata. The staffs are friendly. You can eat in or order to go. Out side eating area by the food truck with cool mist & huge fans."}
{"text":"Forget trying to find this place.  I have tried twice with no success.  They have no contact information, making any attempt fruitless."}
{"text":"Awesome. I've tried the chile relleno, fish tacos, green chile chicken burrito and the giant breakfast burritos. I love the sauce. The green sauce is hot and just like I like it. They even have pancakes for my toddler. The staff is always so nice. I highly recommend this place especially if you crave good Mexican food."}
{"text":"All I can say is YUM!  We moved here about 3 months ago and have been looking for good Mexican food since.  Imagine our surprise to find it at a food truck in the middle of nowhere.  This place delivers, BIG TIME.  Great food, great service and wonderful outside seating."}
