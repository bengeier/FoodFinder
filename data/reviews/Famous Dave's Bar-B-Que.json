{"text":"Great food great service great prices.  Had ths georgia pulled pork with devil spit sauce"}
{"text":"Went here with a party of 8 for my birthday last year.  We ordered two of the Feast thingy's (All American Feast, I think it's called)...They serve them on a garbage can lid. Comes with ribs, chicken, and brisket or pulled pork, with 2 big sides and cornbread muffins.  Oh, and the fries, that are scattered all over the lid. My god, ALL of the food was good.  The ribs, were delicious fall off the bone, variety, the pulled pork was amazing (I had the pulled pork sandwich for lunch one time as well).  I love the different kinds of bbq sauce.  Their desserts are actually pretty friggin' good as well.  Their bread pudding is diabetic shock, but it's absolutely delicious.  The prices, really aren't that bad, either.  It's about $60 for one of the Feasts, and it really does serve about 5 people.   I've been here 3 times now, and will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Here for the Big Slab Tuesday's deal.  Wow what a huge amount of food.  I had the fries and potato salad as side items.  Sat in the bar area for dinner tonight.  Service was friendly service an quick.  Server was Jenny K......they should hire more like her.  I will be back again.....soon as I eat those left overs..."}
{"text":"My family and I went here today and we had the family fest. The service was good. Loom for the waiter Jenna. She is super nice and makes everything on time with your food and drinks. The food was good."}
{"text":"it was my first time here, i am a Lucille's fan since moving to Vegas almost 5 years ago...I had a brisket sandwich and it was the best brisket I have ever had!! The catfish tenders weren't very good but then again I have never liked cat fish in the first place... my favorite sauce (out of 5!!!) they had to offer was the Georgia kiss or something like that... the other sauces in my opinion were your run of the mill barbecue sauce.... all in all the food was good and the service was excellent... I definitely plan to eat here more often and I have forgotten about the other place"}
{"text":"GO FOR HAPPY HOUR. in the bar area. 11-6. EVERYDAY. (i think) GET THE WINGS!!!! the devil spit is delicious. 
price rating based on happy hour. only time i go


edit: if youre goin to the bar to watch a game, eat and run. they wont turn the sound on. they have to play their music. small gripe but it did bite me once. :0)"}
{"text":"I like their brisket, and the turkey burger is pretty good for a lighter option.  My dining companion's ribs weren't very meaty, the other guy liked his BBQ chicken.  Sides were OK too.  Could use some craft beers on tap; Sam Adams and Newcastle good, but why not a pale ale too?  The bar is a good place to watch a game, eat and drink.  Bartender is friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Had dinner with the family. Although we had to wait longer than we would had liked, even though there were almost all tables open, the staff was very friendly. I ordered the 6 bone ribs with pineapple and potato salad and my wife a chicken salad. The kids had chicken tenders and Mac and cheese. My ribs were a bit tough but tasted ok. I love the grilled pineapple! The family was happy with their food as well. Overall, food was good and staff was friendly. Would have liked to not have to wait so long and had my ribs a bit more tender. I would still return to this location."}
{"text":"Good and friendly staff but kind of pricey. Last time I went there I was splitting the bill with three friends. They charged my friends and then had me pay for my Own meal,  then my friends again. Took a while to fix that."}
{"text":"Lunch special is awesome! Food was great, along with the service..specifically told our waitress we were in a hurry side we had to be somewhere in a hour. Waitress brought our food out quick! Scarffed down our food, but was still able to enjoy the ribs and rib tips we ordered. Cornbread is to die for. Ordered one for the road"}
{"text":"The food was good here! The bbq pork ribs was the favorite of the meal! It's juicy and soft, the flavor was just so good, it's definitely different from any other places we've been to. Actually, their bbq pork rib was the best we've ever had so far!
The beef brisket was soft and melting in our mouths. The corn bread was very tasty too, moist and soft. It's a great meal and we enjoyed the bbq meat a lot at Famous Dave's. We will come again."}
{"text":"So when I walked in, I was greeted warmly by the hostess Brittany. She seemed genuine and I felt instantly welcome. Brittany even acknowledged us several times during our meal. She sat us at a table and Redd was our server. Redd was friendly, knowledgeable and a delight to chat with while we decided on our order. The food came out pretty quickly, and was hot, fresh and delicious. Redd anticipated our needs, and we never had to ask for anything. While the food was really good, the service will definitely make us come back. We felt special and like we mattered. The only reason I am not giving 5 stars is when we were leaving, a gentleman who I assume was a manager due to the button down shirt just kind of grumbled thanks for coming with no smile whatsoever."}
{"text":"This Famous Dave's was awful!  The only reason I didnt give it one star is because our waiter was so friendly. My husband complained that his Sprite tasted like dish water. I laughed him off thinking he was being particular. When he got his food he said his mashed potato tasted like medicine. So I decided to try it. Sure enough the mashed potatoes had a peculiar after taste and the Sprite did have taste like how dish water smells. My son said his burger was burnt. Took a look and the edges were burnt. Our food came out lukewarm. I get hotter food at my job's cafeteria. The corn was tasteless, like eating water. They need to change the distributor where the get corn from. Vons have great sweet corn on the cob, LOL!!! Im sick to my stomach to have spent the money I did on a HORRIBLE dinner for 4. I'll never, ever go back to this Famous Dave's and I'm on the verge of not going back to this chain all together. If you want good REAL BBQ stick to the mom and pops non chained non franchised places like TC Rib Crib, Big B's Texas BBQ etc. It seem like chain places dont put the effort or care into their food because they've made their millions and a name for themselves so why care."}
{"text":"Usually I try to avoid chain restaurants because I want to support local businesses. But for some reason Dave's has a local feel so I consider it an exception.

I arrived just in time this afternoon to grab their Early Bird dinner special and got a combo with the St. Louis ribs, traditional wings with Pineapple Rage sauce, and a side of Wilbur beans. I've been here quite a few times but this was the first time I tried their award winning ribs (I love pulled pork waaaay to much). The ribs were almost fall off the bone tender and not dried out. I did need to add a bit more of the Sweet and Zesty sauce though.

The wings were another new try for me, and while the wings themselves were alright, the Pineapple Rage was all pineapple and no rage. I needed to slather it in Devil's Spit sauce to up the heat a bit.

Wilbur beans are my usual side. The meat chunks are a nice touch but I worry about the sugar content because they're usually so sweet.

As far as chains go, Dave's is alright. I'll keep going I suppose until I find a more \"local\" bbq place."}
{"text":"I went to Daves a few nights ago and got the new Hawaiian splatter.  It was great, chopped pork, ribs, chicken, 2 sides, corn on the cob and a delicious corn muffin.  They have five signature sauces which you are now able to taste with their home made fresh BBQ chips.  I have never been a big chip eater however I could have eaten a few pounds of those chips.  If they every decide to mass producer their chips as they have their sauces I would buy them by the case."}
{"text":"Tasty 'Q.  Specially the wings and the ribs and the pulled pork.
Brisket - eh, don't bother.
Sweet tea - a BBQ must-have, and they do.
And nice cold beer.
Lots of parking, clean and cheerful.
Decent prices.
Not bad at all for corporate BBQ."}
{"text":"Pros: everyone was really nice & attentive. Our drinks remained filled. 

Cons: catfish entree came out cold. Was expecting a filet, got strips instead. I didn't know \"mac & cheese soup\" existed. Garlic mash I swear was instant with some skins mixed in.  Did not taste fresh at all. None of it. 

Sat in the bar. Some guy fell out of his chair. No, really...the entire chair & person fell over. Did anyone employed here come to his aid? Not one. They just stood there gawking. This patron was sober.  

Tables & menus: DISGUSTING!!  Everything was sticky. They could at least wipe the bbq sauce off the menu instead of letting it dry. 

As for the decor....when was the last time this place was cleaned?  Dust on all the knick knacks...it was gross. 

Dare I mention the ants running amuck in the ladies room?

How do people eat here?  This place has no standards."}
{"text":"Amazing food... but the service was the best... our server SEAN was spectacular... very attentive knowledgeable and courteous... I will be returning to this location in the near future..."}
{"text":"I normally order on the phone for pick up.  When I get  my order it is always hot - the ribs are tender (my favorite).  Love the beans.  I have ordered numerous platters for different occasions and have never heard anyone complain when I brought it home.  Everyone really enjoys and that's the best part!"}
{"text":"Excellent service and excellent food at a reasonable price. The ribs, pulled pork, and onion straws are very tasty, and I generally am not one to goto BBQ."}
{"text":"Party of 4. We seated right away. 3 minutes in the booth.So my wife went to wash her hands, and that's when the hostess asked us what we would like to drink. The kid says, \"mom would like apple/cranberry\" She says, \"a what?\" \"Half apple, half cranberry.\"  She says, \"I am only helping out because it is busy, I have to ask your server.\" REALLY, how are you helping if you can't mix 2 juices?
       8 minutes later, the waitress comes to get our drink order. Apple/Cran/ no Ice, lemonade/no ice/ Sprite/ Long Island IT/ no Lemon. 10 minutes go by. The manager, or another server comes to ask for our food order, which wife says, \"the other one already took our drink order, we're still waiting.\" Instead of taking our order, she says she'll go find out what is going on...5 more minutes. Our drinks come, and the Sprite is perfect as lemons (I'm allergic) and ice abound.
     2 minutes later we can order. Q for 2, Rib tips dinner, Brisket dinner. I had the Rib Tips and  potato with a salad. the dinner came and the tips were dry and chewy. The potato was ok, and since I was hungry, the only thing eaten. Everyone else was ok, although we all left with boxes (6 in all). 
    The service was terrible, the food was mediocre. Try changing to, \"Dave Makes Some Food.\" I dunno how he got famous."}
{"text":"Had lunch at Famous Dave's.

Worst ever!

Waited half an hour to get the food. Brisket was nothing but uncooked fat.

Won't be back."}
{"text":"Great place, was a little uneasy about the service as our server was pretty loud but we ended up really liking her :)

Had the 2 person feast and our third had the chicken.

WAYYYYYY too much food!!!  Not a complaint just make sure you bring a big appetite.  Fries were great, pulled pork was amazing, ribs were also good.  Chicken was good too.

Only thing I could say is I wish the hot sauce was hotter, the \"Devil's Spit\" which is the hottest they have was pretty mild in my opinion.  Highly recommended, good food, fun service."}
{"text":"Went here Thursday night for dinner. My family ordered the family feast and substituted cole slaw for Mac n cheese. The waitress forgot to bring my fathers code to the tableland we had to request it after 10minutes. The food arrived and the corn was overlooked, the fries were cold and the meat was mediocre at best. I would only recommend this place if you like poor service and have no taste buds."}
{"text":"Went to famous Dave's on 10/31/14 Ordered the Q for 2 and the food came out cold.. Told the waiter he took the food and warned it up I guess in the microwave.. Food came back out brisket was tough as leather. Why would you think its OK to warm brisket a second time in the microwave and wings were still cold.. Only thing hot were the baked beans and corn muffin all the rest of food was cold.. The waiter was nice enough to charge us for the drinks and took the food of our bill..how nice for something we never ate..I have been to famous Dave's many times luckily the one in galleria mall.. I would never go again to that location."}
{"text":"If you like TGI Friday's and Chili's - you'll love this place. The place is tired  - both their menu and the way approach the restaurant industry.  Just no effort here.  There are plenty of good BBQ places in Vegas.  Notice that Famous Dave's LOST it's \"Best in Vegas\" title a few years ago and hasn't won since."}
{"text":"Good but not great.  Lacks attention to detail.  Like buns so so, beans so so and so it goes.  Like I said good but not great.

Would go back after 6 months to see if food has improved."}
{"text":"I love this place.  For the money, you can beat the quality and quantity of BBQ.  The brisket is very good.  Moist, tender, plentiful.  The sides and cocktails are always good.  Service is prompt and friendly.  There are multiple sauces to pick from and they are all pretty tasty.  I like things a little spicy, and the Devil's sauce is delicious.

This is a very good place for kids.  It's casual and a little loud, so I don't care if my kid is a little loud too.  Nice atmosphere for a family to dine and it's a good time for the family."}
{"text":"This place lives up to its name! The food is OUTSTANDING! I went there for the first time with a friend last week and I was truly impressed by the service. The server took the time to explain the different sauces and which entrees they compliment best. You've got to try the chicken/ribs combo! Their drinks are pretty awesome too! I am going back for lunch today!!"}
{"text":"There's one by our house so we always come to this location. Service is fast and food is consistently good. Their corn bread is to die for and I'm trying not to eat more than one cause I would not enjoy my delicious BBQ. Love the shredded pork and the burnt ends. This is where we go to when we crave for BBQ"}
{"text":"A-OK.

Looks like an Applebee's, T.G.I. Fridays, Red Robin, Chili's, etc.  Smells like any one of them too.  Oh wait, it's a BBQ thing here; I guess that's enough of a difference.  Not my usual M.O., but since I never been, and a friend suggested it as a our lunch option... sure, why not, I'll give it a shot.

My friend was pretty adamant about being seated at a table.  He later explained to me (therefore I cannot personally confirm or deny) that being seated at the bar is a gamble on one's time.  Either you will see your food right away, or you will be one of the last to receive your food in the whole restaurant.  So if you have a lot of time and don't mind trying your luck, by all means, be seated at the bar.  Since we had work to get back to, he made the more prudent choice.

We got a waiter that was on the verge of being over-attentive, but I'm far from complaining.  I'll take that over the opposite any time.  He was prompt, courteous, and informative too.  He asked if we were familiar with Dave's, and I fessed up.  He took the time to explain their entire sauce selection (not on BWW's scale, but decent nonetheless).  This process involved pouring a small amount of each onto a large dish.  With a small bowl of seasoned chips (unseasoned would have been preferred, but they sufficed), we got to try and compare thoughts on them all.

Here are my thoughts.  The Rich & Sassy that they claim is famous enough to put on everything is about as standard, boring as BBQ sauce can get.  The Georgia Mustard would actually be absolutely fantastic on fish, chicken, salad, or some such.  Texas Pit and Sweet & Zesty are just different plays on their first sauce, and equally as remarkable.  Devil's Spit, despite the blasphemous/gross name, was actually fairly tastey, and I don't typically say that about BBQ sauce (if you haven't already figured that out).

We ordered off their lunch menu, and I decided to go with the brisket sandwich.  Now in my experience, BBQ brisket is supposed to be cut thin and across the grain.  What I got instead was just a collection of fatty cubes between buns.  In another words, what I probably got was just the left-over scrap from a brisket.  The price definitely did not reflect the product at all.  Luckily, being the opportunist omnivore that I am, I still ate it.  For what it was, with help from the right sauce, it wasn't half bad, but disappointing still.

Luckily the sauce experiment definitely compensated for the deficiencies of the meal.  Although when I was asked if I was going to finish the chips at the table, replied yes, they were still taken away.  Good thing I remembered we had to get back to work, or I would have pursued the matter.  Oh well, check another one off the list at least."}
{"text":"Love the ribs!! That is all i ever want when i go there... The bartenters make great Bloody Marys and the different sauces are tasty!! Great for work meetings and casual lunches"}
{"text":"I came there for dinner with my friend. Service was very good and helpful. But unfortunately food was so so.  Brisket was so dry and look like old one. Rip was a bit hard. I want to give them 4 star but I just came back from Texas so it's completely difference. Sorry guys."}
{"text":"Javier was super nice & pleasant.
Our appetizers came out and then our dinner.  We had no time to enjoy our appetizers and our food was cool. Javier was quick to make everything better.  
The food was ok but rather pricey. 
This is our 2nd time here & probably our last.  The other time, the staff was not very pleasant."}
{"text":"This place has lots of character and the food was great, not to mention the huge portions! Server was okay but I would definitely go again!"}
{"text":"Good food and good service! Tried the one-meat lunch combo and definitely got my moneys worth for the price. Will definitely be coming back to try other things."}
{"text":"Love the food at Famous Daves and have been to this particular restaurant numerous times with great service, but sadly tonight was a disappointment. 

I never have had an issue with this location until tonight. I'll admit we went in for dinner a little late at around 910pm and wanted to sit in the bar because it is typically faster than in the dining area. No one was seated there and the bar was clearly being cleaned up because trays were up and it smelled of cleaning solution. We asked the bartender behind the bar who was trying to avoid interacting with us if the bar area was closed and she said yes but it's okay we can sit down wherever we wanted. Her response made us feel unwelcome and uncomfortable. After contemplating a few seconds we decided to leave because we didnt want to be a bother to her already cleaned section. She didnt even try to stop us or apologize so we left to the much friendlier Chipotle located in the same shopping center. 

If your closing hours say 10 you should not be completely cleaning up at 9. There were families still eating in the restaurant so why should you have to smell cleaning solution while your trying to enjoy your dinner?? We didnt bum rush you at the last minute before closing. My husband and I knew exactly what we wanted because we are regulars so we would've been out well before 10. Tonight made us think if we will ever be back...sad how one bad apple can ruin the bunch."}
{"text":"Walked in, got greeted. Ask for a booth for more privacy for our little ones, host went to look for a booth..no booth found & got stuck  with the table right behind the trophies & in between two big parties. As we were getting seated  I immediately saw an open  booth available that the host couldn't find!! Asked to be moved. Changed table, ordered drinks..to only get watered down iced teas..MY FAV!!! Ordered food..all food came out @ a reasonable time, except for one, an order that wasn't brought out with the rest because jokingly the server didn't have enough hands to bring it out, & then to only find out that the food hasn't even been started to be made!!!YAYYYY!!

-First time here & Im already turned off by the place.
-3 stars for the food though.
Bbq chips -eh 
Kids loved the ribs
Brisket - ok
Sweet water catfish - ok"}
{"text":"We went to Famous Daves for lunch.  Spoke to the hostesses and inquired about a gluten free menu.  She looked at us like we are crazy and said they don't have any gluten-free items. Seems kinda is that a restaurant in today's society doesn't offer any gluten free items.  Smelled incredibly good in there though."}
{"text":"The food here is great, but the service I got was horrible.  I ordered over the phone and went to pick up the girl on the phone said it would be ready in 15 min.  So I got there in 15 min but still had to wait another 30 min to get my food.  The girl at the register was on the phone most of the time and when I walked up didn't even acknowledge I was there.  Great food horrible take out service every rude."}
{"text":"They have a special Right now for rib tips , and I was craving barbecue so I stopped there after I had to run some errands because I love famous Dave's anyways but the food came out really fast and it hit the spot so I'm really happy and I'll definitely be back soon"}
{"text":"Though the menu has changed some of the years, it's still a damn good BBQ place. Glad that I know to ask for the fried pickles because they aren't on the menu, but I have never been told no when requesting a batch.

Only reason it's not a 5 star is because they changed some of the small things I liked at previous locations. Such as the chips that were brought out to help you chose which table sauce you were going to use. Overall the meat quality has been pretty spot on the staff has been good to my family and I, and the drinks are pretty good."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch with my wife and the place was rather empty. Our waitress came over to greet us and suggested a bunch of the specials they were having for the day. She was great (Linda) about explaining ways we could get the best deals and also about what she thought tasted great. The food was delicious. I thought the Brisket could have been better but it was still tender.  The Mac and cheese and wings were also on point. But it was great getting fantastic customer service at our first stop while visiting Vegas. We may hit them up again before we live."}
{"text":"Good food n ice cold brews at this place.always good service when i come here.not to pricey"}
{"text":"Food is generally good. A group of friends likes to do birthdays there and we always get the family style meals. I find it to be expensive for the quantity and taste."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious BBQ! My girlfriend and I were visiting Las Vegas and ate here after being referred by a local. Prices are very reasonable for the amount and quality of food you get. Our server Taylor is awesome! He made the visit that much more special. Definitely coming back here on our next visit."}
{"text":"My husband and I are visiting from Rhode Island and we both thought it was just OK. The st Louis ribs were fair and the marinated tips had lots of bones. The burnt ends had great flavor but just OK. I would go back but would try something else. Cute place great staff."}
{"text":"Best thing here are the ribs and Mac n cheese. When the ribs are falling off the bone tender (not always), it's the best. Devils spit plus Sweet n Zesty combination make the best sweet and spicy BBQ sauce. This is new Vegas tradition."}
{"text":"Great food but horrible service. We are the only ones in the bar, but Genevieve seems frazzled."}
{"text":"if i could give this place a zero i would!! the worst place I've ever been. Don't get me wrong the food is good but the service is probably the worst service i've ever had. At the middle of our meal we were not expecting good service anymore we just wanted \"a service\" to happen!!. We saw our server once!! and that is when he took our order!! that was it ....never seen him since. We're done with our meal and we had to ask some else to bring our bill and it took him 30 mins to have SOMEONE ELSE TO HANDED TO US!!!. 30 fucking mins!!!!!  I mean what the fuck is that bullshit!!!!. I was eating ice just to fill my thirst!!! I WILL NEVER EVEN RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO MY ENEMIES COZ THAT WOULD BE TOO MEAN"}
{"text":"Bloody Mary is a pre made nastiness. I had the BBQ chicken with green beans and Mac and cheese. The chicken was ok thanks to the descent BBQ sauce. The Mac and cheese was different, it had corn in it. This wouldn't be one of my favorite places to eat."}
{"text":"We're experiencing a decline at this location. Could be a bad night. Service was slow. We had to ask for drink refills. Food is mixed which indicated either a very messy prep table or lazy food peppers. I had Wilbur beans, had mac in cheese mixed in, Caesar salad had pieces of cheddar cheese mixed in. The waiter told us 4 separate times he was on his way with our check. Waiter must be new or in the wrong business because they lacked the skills necessary to wait on more than one table at a time. I.e. He brought to go boxes to one table, walked back to the kitchen and got some for us. I only saw him working 3 tables."}
{"text":"Big let down. The pulled pork had flavor...but the portion was disappointing. The bun was dry. Barely a taste of Mac & Cheese. Tasted like it came out of a can. I won't be paying those prices ever again."}
{"text":"my mom and I stopped in for lunch.   Francine was our server and was the best.  Food and service awesome and the brownie was delicious and sinful."}
{"text":"I've only had family by the pool BBQ, so I was very abrasive about going here for a co-workers birthday dinner.. but it was so gooood!   I got a meal that was $20, to be shared between two people, came with ribs, chicken, pork, cornbread, and a couple other things the service was EXCELLENT, I had the nicest waiter explain everything on the menu to me, my drink was never empty, things also got pretty meessy and he brought us a bunch of napkins and took them away accordingly, and even gave me some recommendations!  Food was perfect, sauces on the table were great!  Counting the days until my co-workers birthday is here again lol.  
Definitely going back!!!"}
{"text":"We had to wait five minutes to get seated but apart from that we had a great evening with fantastic BBQ."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's has changed their menu in the past two weeks. I was told this by the management at the Famous Dave's on Rainbow and Lake Mead.  Here is one item that has changed. The brisket use to be absolutely delicious but now when you order the brisket you get three/four pieces of brisket with a glob of small pieces of shredded brisket intermixed with a lot of fat, and which appears to have been cooking on the bottom of the pot for quite a while.  The brisket as well as the chicken are no longer cooked in the delightful sauce it use to once be cooked in.   I sent my dinner back and so did the person I was with.   It's not worth the money they charge for it.  Just be aware that the great dinner you once enjoyed is no longer available unless you send your dinner back and ask for what you thought you were paying for.  

On the upside the service was great.  Both the manager and my server were polite, attentive and truly sorry that the menu had changed seeing our disappointment.  

Seeing that Famous Dave's is pinching pennies at your expense try John Mull's Road Kill Grill.  You get 3x as much food for the same price and the food is excellent."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong with Dave's always tasty food. staff has always been good and the service fine. I really think I like their chicken the best."}
{"text":"4.18.15 Chicken along a feast for two was spoiled, waiter changed for ribs; but, the restaurant should have taken the whole plate back and bring a new one, that did not happen.

I don't want to go overboard, a lot of good people work there; so, to Famous Dave's: get better at QC."}
{"text":"We were excited to eat here after hearing good reviews.  Great service, food was amazing.  Workers were all very nice and helpful. Being from Texas I'm excited to have a great bbq place that lives up to Texas standards."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed with this place at all. The staff was great, but the food was on the same level low end fast food joint.  Placed an order  to go of the St. Louis 1/2 rack with mash potatoes as my side. The ribs were tough and tasted like a frozen store bought product. 

Now for the garlic red mash potatoes. Who ever prepped the dehydrated mash potatoes forgot to add the package of seasoning. So I just ended up sticky dehydrated potatoes.

So, if you are looking for a place that will serve sub par BBQ check out this place! They are getting 2because they seem to have a good staff."}
{"text":"Famous Daves was solid.  Ordered pick up and food was ready in ten minutes so that was cool. I had ordered the country chicken and catfish sticks combo with sides or Mac and rice, food tasted good bur portions seemed light for the price."}
{"text":"WOW!  I can't believe that it took us so long to try this restaurant.  We love BBQ and we loved this place.  We ordered the Family Meal which came with Chicken, Ribs, Sausage, Brisket, Corn, Beans, Muffins, Cole Slaw and Fries.  The Food was absolutely delicious and our waiter (Darren) was just a good.  We ordered (2) beers and (3) perfect Margarita's and the meal was $117.00.  I would definitely  would give this restaurant a try.  We had many left-overs to bring home and even ordered a 6 pack of muffins to go."}
{"text":"Hankering for some ribs and brisket and tired of going to Lucille's so decided to try Famous Dave's. We got the feast for two in order to sample as many of the meats/sides as we could for a small party. 

St. Louis Style Spareribs: Disappointing. Very tough and difficult to bite off the bone. The only thing saving them was the nice glaze of viscous basted sauce on them.

Beef Brisket: Average. I've had worse (i.e. tough) and I've had better (tender and juicy). These were tender, just kind of bland. I slathered them in the Texas Pit sauce (their medium sauce with peppercorns) to get more of the smoke flavor that should already be inherent in the brisket itself, and was able to down them.

Chopped Pork: Best of the three meats we tried. Tender and pulled apart easily. Tried it w/ the Georgia mustard sauce. A little bit too much vinegar for my taste, but nice runny consistency. 

Sides: Recommend the cornbread and the corn on the cob. Potato salad was a bit hard (wished they had boiled the potatoes for more than two minutes), and fries just your average steak fries."}
{"text":"Deeeelicious! Pulled pork and ribs are the best. We had the family bucket meal with everything in it. And it's huge! Good place to avoid the over priced and not so good food on the Strip. I would recommend this place for 4 stars if not for the service."}
{"text":"As stated before, decent BBQ for a chain. I had the brisket, hot link, mashed potatoes, and mac and cheese. Honestly, I enjoyed the side dishes more than the entree. The mac and cheese has corn in it....different, but not bad. Serving size was on par, and it even comes with a side of corn bread and corn on the cob. The \"dragon's spit\" was not as spicy as I would have expected, but tasty none the less. 

I washed it all down with a root beer float which was HUGE!!!! My order was placed to go. Convenient and quick parking up front for pick ups, and the cashier was very nice and made sure my order was made to my liking. I will come again!"}
{"text":"Just had dinner and it was so good. .. enough to bring home too. . Only question was I got an e-mail saying Q for 2 $19.99 when we got the bill it was $23.99 plus drinks? Next time we will print the offer out"}
{"text":"My friend and I found this a tad disappointing.

We  had dinner there. It was our first time at any Famous Dave's so we ordered the Feast For Two - ribs, chicken, brisket, coleslaw, beans corn and cornbread. There was enough to stuff ourselves silly and still have some of everything (except the cornbread) to take home. The ribs were exceptional - although I don't enjoy any heat/spice and there was no sauce option to accommodate me, so I only had one rib. That lowers my rating from a 5 to a 4.

While all the food was good, the brisket was not \"falling apart\" as a truly superior brisket should - in both our opinions. Again, the coleslaw had a mild southwestern \"kick\" to it - making it less edible for me. Oddly it was the corn on the cob that we both went crazy over. So if we go back it will be ribs for her, cornbread and corn for both of us - we could take or leave the rest."}
{"text":"Hi I was in famous daves in Vegas this weekend and well the service was not good it took 30-40 minutes to get our meal and they got our order mixed up and the restaurant was empty literally like no people in there and the staff was not to friendly it was like we were making them work cuss we were there  I love famous daves in Palmdale they got good service and good staff  maybe I should have stop there before going to Vegas"}
{"text":"Rude bartender girl with fake boobs or muffin top screamed at me \" is this what your going to ask all night\" because I asked for the beer price. We felt uncomfortable but stayed because we really wanted famous Dave's. spent a lot even tipped well. Will not be going back there again even if she doesn't work there. Maybe in another city."}
{"text":"Emily is a rockstar. She was so cute and bubbly. Very friendly and very attentive. I was amazed at her customer service. Definitely a different experience then my last one. Glad you hired someone with a some personality and joyfulness. Was amazed to find out it she had barely started there. I'm a server and there's a few things that show me you're a good server and one of them is refilling a drink before a customer is out and she did that multiple times . Good job Emily! I'll make sure to ask for you every time my husband and I come in now!"}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place. Food, Service, Price....everything about it was awesome. Except for the LONG KINKY HAIR that i found all the way on the bottom of my mac-n-cheese. I loved the spicy little dish so much that i almost finished the whole thing until I found the 3 inch long pubic looking hair in my mac-n-cheese.  I was so disappointed because we were so hungry and the food was so tasty. I wanted to eat more, but was absolutely disgusted when i found the hair. The manager comped the entire meal. I left a big tip for the waitress. PLEASE WEAR A HAIR NET."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. The food... the ribs in general looked and tasted like shoe leather with tons of fat on it. And the service was beyond horrible as well. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy!"}
{"text":"I love ribs!!! The ribs here are fall off the bone smokely dokely awesomely. They have two types of sauces hot and spicy and regular. They are both good. I had the brisket and it was ok. My suggestion, stick to the ribs. The sides are typical. The colesaw and mac and cheese are really good. I always get my food to go, so my review is for the food only. I usually order form the to go counter and one time I waited at the bar and had a beer. The bartender was nice but she made it a point to tell me that I could order to-go food from her. I mean, she is a bartender she has her own customers at the bar. The person that works the take out counter relies on take out orders only. It was a little selfish of her to try to take business from her fellow staff member. It was a little annoying. Other than that, the ribs rock!!!!"}
{"text":"Order Famous Dave's tonight to go cause I was craving some good bbq food .  When I ordered my food they said it would be ready in 10 min. I was a little surprised because I ordered a big sampler plate with ribs catfish chicken and more and a chicken bbq sandwich. How could it be ready in 10 min. Just to my surprise everything tasted like it had been made hours before & not even attempted to be heated up to at least act like it was fresh . Nothing was hot & just all tasted old . Honestly could of just went to a fast food joint then spend extra money on cold old food ."}
{"text":"Yankee  BBQ   everything i ordered had sauce on it, no spice at all, and so much sugar in all the food its a wonder everyone doesn't leave a diabetic .  no jalapenos . looking for wood pile out back, not one, i don't think they cook with wood.   folks if there is no wood pile its not real BBQ."}
{"text":"We just moved from California and we are excited we finally found a good place to eat. We ordered the hot links and the ribs both were great. Portions were good.  Mac and cheese is soooo soooo good and the muffin...love that you can try all the different sauces!  Would go again for sure"}
{"text":"Always a favorite of mine! I usually get a half thing of ribs with their spicy mac & cheese. Of course you can't forget the delicious cornbread! Mouth is salivating just thinking about it. 

Staff has always been friendly and usually quick about getting my order. There have been rare occasions that i had to signal someone to fill a drink."}
{"text":"I've been to other Famous Daves BBQ and loved their food so I decided to go back again.  But the food tasted totally different from what I experienced before.  The ribs weren't thoroughly cooked and did not taste good at all.  They were super busy at that time but still I expected better.  The waitor was so pushy on ordering drinks (alcohol).  When we kept on saying no to ordering drinks he made stupid joke at us which I thought was rude.   I would probably go try again at a different location with my friends but my husband won't go back there again since that was his first experience there."}
{"text":"UGH. My birthday dinner experience was NOT what I wanted it to be this year at Famous Dave's. Been here quite a few times and have always had great service/food. The bar was totally empty when our party of 4 sat down and Matt, the bartender took his sweet time getting our initial drink order. Food arrived and was tasty as usual, but even if something had been wrong, Matt never even really checked back to see how things were. We had a bday coupon that was visible on the table and he ran hubby's credit card without even acknowledging the coupon. When confronted he had a crappy attitude about it saying \"well, I can fix it but it'll take like two days for it to be credited back, yadda yadda yadda.\" Okay, so fix it. That's 16 bucks off of our $85 tab, buddy. And guess what? It ain't going towards your tip. Had to go chase down a manager to take care of it, which took him all of 4 minutes. Being a server myself, I know how easy it is to reverse a transaction... and I also know how to leave the shitty attitude at the door when I show up for work.

This won't stop us from going back to this location but if Matt's tending bar we're sitting in the dining room from now on."}
{"text":"This is a good quick place to stop for some semi-authentic BBQ. The chicken is always good and the corn bread muffins are to die for. I would stay clear of the ribs as the consistency in tenderness varies quite often. Great happy hour and servers have always been very  efficient and friendly:) nice clean restrooms as well.:)"}
{"text":"I took my brother from out of town for the first time and he was in heaven. I have now officially have taken him to the promised land. Our waitress Brittani was incredible. Go famous daves"}
{"text":"It was one of the worst chain BBQ place I have tried. The side dishes was better than their meats.  A little over priced for what you get as far as quality.  All the meats we ordered was over cooked and dry, had to drown the meat with the BBQ sauce to get it down. Tried Dave's BBQ twice now just to make sure, won't be going back for a third."}
{"text":"I'm surprised I never wrote a review about this place until now. I've been here tons of times as it's one of the only authentic southern/soul food/ribs/bbq places in Vegas. I am from the South (Georgia)... so this restaurant feels just like home as I believe DAVE himself started his restaurants in Georgia.

Everything's great about this place from the food, to the friendly staff, to the decor. My suggestions (i.e. what I always end up ordering) are as follows:
DRINK: Sweet Tea
MEAT: Beef Brisket

I've tried their nachos and fried pickles appetizers and they are both great.

DESSERT: Their bread pudding is probably the best in the city

Side note: This is one of few places that offers their own BBQ sauces and they are all on your table and you can pick and choose whatever you like right there! I prefer \"Georgia Mustard\" and \"Sweet and Sassy\"... I just wish I could find that \"Georgia Mustard\" sauce in my local grocery stores because I've seen just about all their other sauces in the grocery store(s)"}
{"text":"Trust this review from a past Texas barbeque pit master.  The first thing you should notice about a barbeque restaurant is the intoxicating, salivating-producing aroma of barbecue as you pull into the parking lot.  This sensation is absent from Famous Daves, even when you walk through the doors.

For the following reasons I actually believe this faux barbeque is prepared in ovens.  The ribs and the \"authentic Texas\" brisket did not have a single sumptuous bit of bark on the surface and also did not have a single bit of smoked flavor. The bark on the chopped pork was better but equally tasteless having been produced in an oven.

About the sides:  The corn on the cob was severely overcooked and mushy.  When you pull the paper away from the cornbread muffin half of the muffin comes away with it.  The green beans were almost raw, so they did not take up any of the bacon, garlic, onion and red pepper.  The supposed four cheese macaroni and cheese was mostly Velveeta.  The potato salad was simple and good and the Wilbur beans were tasty.  

With all this in mind I have to question why Yelpers and Best of Las Vegas reviewers rate this mess of a restaurant so high.  Not being a hater, but I suspect that it has to do with the size of their waists.  I swear, I felt I on the deck of the spaceship in Walley when I sat in there."}
{"text":"This is my alone getaway place, always coming to the bar here when I want some food and being by myself. Super friendly service and quick helpful service from everyone. It makes me feel welcome and comfortable. I love that who ever is behind the bar for the day always makes sure I'm good or if I need anything. Only issue is the gaming machines don't payout lmao but that's not their fault so they get a perfect rating in my book"}
{"text":"You will get the most bang for your buck at Famous Dave's when compared to it's competitors such as Lucille's. We typically get one or two of the following items, ribs, rib tips, sausage, brisket, chopped pork. All are quite good. I enjoy the ribs, because they are tender, but not necessarily \"fall off the bone\". Beware of the ribs and rib tips as they tend to be a bit fatty. All of the meats are very good. Excellent, no, but definitely good. 

As for sides, we have tried the jalapeno mac and cheese, beans, fries, and potato salad. All are very good. 

A few of the reviews point out sub-par service. We have always experienced good service at this location. Nothing spectacular, but nothing to really bother us either. I would return since the prices are reasonable, the food good, and it's close to home. I was undecided between 3 or 4 stars, but went with 4 stars due to the value."}
{"text":"This location has bad customer service and unprofessional employees taking the take out and pick up orders. They'll put you on hold, answer, then will hang up on you. This happened twice, not only once. The manager isn't very understanding either. Instead of taking my order due to the inconvenience, she put me back on hold! Unbelievable. Anyway, we decided on Lucille's instead. Waaaaay better service....and food!! =P"}
{"text":"If i could give them negative 5 stars I would! Customer service was horrible. The first time I called I was hung up on. Once I got someone (Ricardo) tried to place a big catering order with him and he rudely said \"Im busy I will have to call you back!\" He took my and number and said \"Im taking an order now and like I said I have to call you back Im busy!\". ..5 hours later NO CALL back. Its okay I gave another BBQ place my business and will rate them 5 stars for their great customer service. Famous Daves should be called Failed Dave's. I will make sure my company never tries to Order from them again."}
{"text":"BROKEN DREAMS !!! I love this place and so does babe but we literally just left this place and sat in the first booth to the left right as u walk in and 5 mins into sitting there (haven't even ordered drinks yet) he Points out a LIVE ROACH CRAWLING UP THE WALL NEXT to ME !!!!! I'm not Liening I'm not over exaggerating, but literally jumped back in the booth and pushed the seat back! this seriously put a damper on my view on this chain and I'm
sad to say I'll just buy the sauce at The grocery store and eat bbq else where!"}
{"text":"Love their corn muffins so much! Sweet tea is delish, I just like to add a bit more sweetener than it comes with. Got the feast for 2 and it came with a ton of food. Corn on the cob was so good and so we're the ribs! Service was decent."}
{"text":"Very good food here. I've only had a few bbq places here in town, and so far they're my favorite. I generally get the ribs, but have also tried the pulled pork, and bbq chicken and they're all very good. Staff always seems like it's the busiest time of their lives, even on a slow night, but overall they are friendly and do their job so I can't complain."}
{"text":"Havnt been to a famous Dave's in over 5 years and I wasn't disappointed eating here again! We got the feast for two which was Amazing! Brittany was our server and she was the best! Best service, best food!"}
{"text":"It's not bad. But it's not great. It's more or less ok. The food is generally tasty, but  considering the price I think it should be a smidge better. Also, the service was kind of lame. We had to flag down waiters just to get refills on our iced tea. We didn't get butter until we were halfway through with our meal. 

The corn on the cob was overcooked and the other side dishes were uninspired. The cornbread might have been the best part of the meal. My husband got the brisket, and he didn't seem to have any trouble eating it all. My pulled pork was palatable. But all of the meat was served on top of a giant piece of Texas toast. I think this was to give the appearance that we were getting more food. Given the price of our meals, I was hoping to have enough leftovers for another full meal. Alas, that wasn't the case.

The most annoying part of our experience was the lighting. The lamp above our table was outfitted with an amazingly bright light bulb. When I looked around the restaurant (after blinking at the spots in my eyes) I noticed that all of the people sitting in booths couldn't look across their table because the lights were so painful. The light was so bright that the bbq sauce on my pulled pork was making me squint from the glare. So, even if you are tempted by the booths, ask for a table. 

In short: if you're in the neighborhood and want meat, this will get the job done. Just remember to wear sunglasses inside."}
{"text":"We have ate here a couple times. Its pretty good. The pulled pork is good, and so is the cornbread. The one thing i think they could improve on is, larger portions. If you get a Sandwich and the one side, its not very filling. They are a little skimpy with the meat portions."}
{"text":"Server was excellent, the food not so nuch! My fiancé had some fry chicken and my cajum chicken San which wasn't too tasty."}
{"text":"What needs to be said about  the food? It is BBQ. Hard to mess that up. What really gets me going about this place is the service. I am HUGE on service. The manager at this place roves and always has a smile on his face. That attitude rubs off on the staff. EVERYONE is there to help. No one seems put off when I ask for anything. 

My mother in law owns a house out there that we visit for the Thanksgiving holiday so I only visit this place yearly, but I go a couple of times every visit. That is how much I like it. 

Great food, Great service, and nicely priced. I will be back next year."}
{"text":"Unfortunately I have to give a hearty thumbs down to this Famous Dave's restaurant. We went there to celebrate my birthday and our meals were bad. The brisket was very fatty so we sent it back. The next brisket that came out was dry and tough as if had been well over-cooked. The ribs were mostly bone and what little meat there was was dry and chewy. Did the manager on duty offer to comp any of us or make up for this poor experience in any way? No. I filled out a survey that reflected our dissatisfaction and a few days later I was contacted by a manager. He seemed concerned and said he would make it up to me by sending me a gift card. He never did. Very disappointing. I will never return to this location due to the poor food and lack of management concern and follow through. There are much better options."}
{"text":"Love those burnt ends! Wish I could have bought them by the pound like other cuts. Also the loaded potatoes are too die for takes 2 sittings to finish. Awesome goodness"}
{"text":"I was looking forward to some greens and wouldn't you know, there out. The guy at the Togo counter wasn't helpful at all.  Sucks."}
{"text":"I hate chain restaurants, but I like this Dave's. Meat and sides are pretty good. I end up here when driving to or through or from Vegas. Tried one more locally near L.A. once, but wasn't as good, though to be fair, it had only been open for one week."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the staff is not trained for food allergies. With celiac disease you can not eat gluten which is in wheat, rye and barley. The server did not know what gluten was so we had to leave before ordering. Most restaurants train the staff to make all patrons feel welcome. Those of us with celiac would much rather have the option of eating anything we want, it's a major inconvenience to us as well and we really appreciate those establishments that take the time to train an informed staff."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great 4 rib dinner complete with corn on the cob and coleslaw. Great kids menu, and variety of sides. Free refills on certain beverages .........service was great at this location, there was a large variety of ribs to choose from. Will definitely return ."}
{"text":"Blah..... Super expensive and annoying staff..they sit at your table for 10 minutes explaining sauces that all taste the same! Its way overrated and super expensive! Nothing really tastes fresh or authentic. Your better off taking the time and making it at home.Soggy fries, frozen corn, dry cornbread and meat that is so overcooked and smoked I cant taste what animal it strarted off as. Final verdict....Boo!"}
{"text":"Been here twice , Both times I ordered to go. first time  was a walk in ordered a 2 meat lunch combo & banana pudding ... bbq ends and ribs sub par... banana pudding was a hit with to make me go back a second time.  Next time around only ordered the pudding but this tune I called in the order. To my surprise the portion was considerably more then the first time around. Wonder y?! Note the less it was just as good as the first time around"}
{"text":"To start off there was nobody upfront seating people.  They set pretty full already and it was 30 minutes before closing so I guess they did not feel like seating anybody else.  A couple of more people walked in after me and they were waiting also.  So I took the initiative and asked the girl behind the togo counter to sit us down.  After that it was all pretty good.  Food came out fast it taste awesome.  The Texas pit sauce did it for me.  The devils spit is not spicy enough.  Will definetly go back."}
{"text":"Came in this evening for dinner with the family. Our servers name was Michael. Our service was super fast! We were seated immediately and were great as soon as we walked in the door. Our server Michael came to the table fast and took our drink order. Shortly after he took our dinner order. Our children's meals came out super fast before the rest of our meals which makes me a very happy momma! The meal was hot, fresh and super yummy!! We all left with full tummies! This is a favorite spot for my family and we will always return. Thanks Michael for the great service."}
{"text":"Military Mondays. Great. Let's pack up the kids and go. Love my previous Famous Dave's visit at another location. 

I ordered the Nachos appetizer and it isn't a valid entree for the kids $.99 Military Monday special. I redrew it anyways, expecting a leaning stack of chips, meat and and all the trimmings. Was I sadly disappointed when my large order of nachos came out and it looked like a smashed nachos. 

My kids cheeseburger doesn't even come with lettuce, tomato or anything but a bun, burger patty and some cheese. 

Not to mention, my family of 9 waited 20 minutes to be seated on a Monday night. 

Won't be in a rush to return."}
{"text":"Amazing sides and brisket. Good non meat sides for vegetarians. The inside looked cool and service was good."}
{"text":"The large pork ribs here are amazing. Corn is sweet and not buttered so you can add your preference, cornbread awesome, bake potato is fabulous and potato salad is spectacular. Be sure to say no cheese or bacon if you don't like that on bake potato. Waitress was fast and friendly, helping to say that ribs are brushed lightly in sauce not smothered, bringing water with a lemon. Enough to take to go for later. Upbeat ambiance. Passed all tests including to bring a bone plate."}
{"text":"Great food. Crappy service. Takeout employees take forever to answer phones. Mostly kids working there, so it appears to be a management issue. A real shame because being from Minnesota, this place is revered. Get your act together Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The Food was great just couldn't enjoy it for being cold so I have to reheat for lunch tomorrow!,,,,"}
{"text":"Memphis Championship BBQ can be dry, but Famous Dave's is always juicy, fresh and fast.  The only place that comes close is John Mull's Meats."}
{"text":"Let's say that this was a very horrible experience! From the start of calling in a order to go ! I was put on hold twice , Then Famous Gabby talked over me through the entire order rushing me through as quickly as possible ! Maybe they are busy .... 

To my wife's surprise not busy at all !! She showed up 20 minutes after the order was placed and Famous Gabby did not even put the order in yet . My wife was furious having to wait 30 minutes for our order. During that time the manager had passed by three times not even willing to offer any assistance and an employee that was not so famous because he was clocked out was leaning over the counter talking to Gabby ! My wife then asked if she could get Texas Pit BBQ sauce and Gabby said sorry we don't have it Available in packets . She then said I will just give you a bottle . 

Wife returns home and the sauce is Rich and Sassy !! Not a fan .... the ribs were nearly cold and very dry ! The fries soggy and the potatoes were also cold . Not a great experience this time around . My wife decided to call and share her experience with a manager just so they would be aware of the lack of customer service and training. The manager proceeded to make excuses and blame it on a new system that was installed! 

Truly Disappointed ...."}
{"text":"Famous Dave is great! Love the 'Que for Two' deal. Very filling for two people."}
{"text":"The food is great. Been here 3-4 times. Ribs have come out tender everytime. I know this is a franchise and it varies. But this location is great quality n service. Rib tips...pretty addicting..."}
{"text":"Happy hour pricing is awesome. We had the rib tips, nachos and wings for $5-7 each and it came with fries! The draft beers were 1/2 off.  Our server who was also the bartender was great. She came by to ask if we wanted another round of drinks before happy hour was over which was nice. Our bill came out to $33 for 3 apps and 5 beers! Will come back again for HH especially since it's close to home."}
{"text":"service is always great, but that food is just amazing. bbq and cold beer what else do you need. stop in and enjoy"}
{"text":"Famous Daves has some of the best ribs if you order them the correct way.  Always ask for your ribs naked and center cut.  The sauce at Famous Daves is a bit much and really kills the great seasoning and taste of the ribs.  Try them once like this and you will never have sauce on them again.  

The side orders, none of them seem great so I suggest you ask for the corn bread instead.  Service is great and I love the to go option."}
{"text":"This was good for takeout a few months ago but something must have changed in the last month or two, either they got a new cook or the cooks they had lost their desire to make decent food. The Hickory chicken sandwiches were normally good over the past few years are now undercooked and do not have the same grilled taste as before, its more like they microwaved the last couple I had ordered, The fries which were normally crispy and well done are now soggy and undercooked also. The ribs have gone downhill, they were meaty and well cooked before but they are now fatty , soft and taste oven cooked rather than smoked. The coleslaw was warm and inedible Listen up management!!! Get rid of this cook or batch of cooks making this slop otherwise this restaurant that was once pretty decent will go down in flames. My order was today 2/12/2015 at 5PM  and the whole meal sucked."}
{"text":"It's always a good time whether we dine in or take out. We like to come during happy hour to get the appetizers like the rib tips and off course the corn bread. Oftentimes, well call for take out and in 10 mins our order is ready. Overall, their customer service is on point. We've had Alexis as our server a number of times and she's taken good care of us. Their banana pudding is definitely a must try."}
{"text":"Pretty good bar b que. We ordered the platter we picked ribs, brisket, and chicken...came with mac and cheese and baked beans and cole slaw...it was all very yummy!

The service was great and quick. I would def. go back here."}
{"text":"I felt like visiting someone famous and ended up at Famous Dave's. Unfortunately, Dave wasn't available to hang out, but it was happy hour anyway.

Was it just like I was there for happy hour. No, not really. I walked in, had a seat at the bar and Kelly the bartender served me up. I decided to go with the wings (1/2 off for HH), and onion strings. Both were excellent. Twentey-three ounces of beer (domestic) was about $2.99. Not too shabby if you ask me. I spent some time there and admired the decor, the people ordering trash lids of food and many other things. 

Will I go back? Definitely. It's a no pressure sell if you ask me."}
{"text":"Great BBQ joint. Really fast with the cooking. The ribs were perfect. Cooked just right. The chicken is just ok. But the sides are awesome. Beans, Corn, cornbread, coleslaw and mashed potatoes. Service is great. Very polite and friendly. And very informed about the menu. Will definetly return here to eat. Also the portions are huge. More than enuff to feed what they say. Bring your family or friends."}
{"text":"Best spare ribs I've had in a long time. 

We wanted to try this place for awhile after we saw Famous Dave competing in the Reno BBQ competition featured on Food Network. 

The ribs are excellent. They were so juicy and tender. The meat just come off but still carries firmness. 

Beef brisket, on the other hand, I was not impressed. They were a little too dry and over cooked. They did have a nice smoky taste. 

The sides were wonderful. Corn bread that looks like a cup cake tasted as good as it looked. Potato salad was refreshing, and the corn on the cob was pretty crunchy. 

Over all, the food was good. The price was a little more than I liked, but the ribs was worth it."}
{"text":"Our company had a dinner here on Monday with about 25-30 people. The food was pretty good and about average for what is expected from when you go to Famous Dave's. A positive thing I liked was the free re-fills of drinks at no extra cost (except for beers). One of the major issues was the fact that by the time everyone ordered there meals, it took over 70 minutes to get our food. Some people in our company were pretty angry about that. Another positive thing was that our waitress was very friendly and was able to divide all of our checks so that each person could pay individually. For your awareness, Famous Dave's accepts credit cards and cash."}
{"text":"I ordered the Buffalo wings and mashed potatoes and mac and cheese...the waiter was very rude just dripped my plate on the table. The food was BARELY warm...and just did not taste fresh...if I didn't have the munchies I wouldn't have took the couple bites I did....won't recommend this this place to anyone"}
{"text":"Had a strong taste for chicken tenders and fries today! So I searched on Yelp for places nearby that had good chicken tenders. I looked through about 7 places and then got excited when I saw and remembered Famous Daves sold really great chicken tenders. 
So I ordered the platter which was about $12. It came with 5 chicken tenders, 2 sides, a corn muffin, and  sauce. The tenders have a perfect crunch on the outside and juicy chicken on the inside
It really hit the spot!
So delicious!
Everything was great and filling!
Definitely better than Raising Canes in my opinion. It was so good I didn't even think about taking a pic of it until I was almost finished.
I'll most definitely be returning. I love Famous Daves!"}
{"text":"Normally I would not write a review of a chain restaurant with multiple locations in Las Vegas but the service at the Craig Road location by Eric, Kaitlyn and Heath compelled me to do so.

We normally frequent the Rainbow location but tonight we found our selves hungry after attending a car show at the Cannery Casino. This location is almost across the street from the Cannery making it a great choice if you want to avoid the \"casino\" crowd. My wife and I ordered the \"feast\" for two and there was enough to feed three. Famous Dave's food is always consistent. What made us want to come back to this location is the above mentioned staff, they are great! We will be back!

Tip, fill out the survey on your check and you will get a free desert on you next visit!"}
{"text":"I really have no complaints about this place. I love the ribs the service is usually good at the bar although not always. We sit there because they have a spectacular happy hour. All around good food and people. Usually not busy because we go during the afternoon."}
{"text":"Just got a coupon for my birthday and went in for late lunch yesterday. The ribs are still amazing, and I recommend the baked beans and potato wedges for sides. Still one of my favorites barbeque joints in town."}
{"text":"This is only a review for their telephone pick-up service.

A coworker of mine had asked me if I wanted lunch from this joint, as she was about to make a lunch run.  I usually don't eat lunch, but thought to myself \"Why not?\"  Holy smokes!  This joint has THE BEST BBQ chicken I've ever had!  Very flavorful, very tender, and very tasty!  She got me hooked on this place!  A couple of days later, I had to try this place again!  Their ordering system is easy.  I called in my order ahead of time, jumped in my car, and by the time I got there, my food was ready for pickup.  Friendly staff, easy ordering, convenient location...what more could I ask for?  Next time I try this joint, I'll have to go in and sit down so I can review their in-house service."}
{"text":"My coworker was keen on taking us here--I've never heard of this chain before, but I'm glad I know it now. I came here twice in two weeks and ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich lunch special. After the waiter takes your order, he/she will serve you a dish of their homemade BBQ chips--YUM!

The chicken in the sandwichwas juicy, and the different BBQ sauces were all delicious! I enjoyed Dave's BBQ sauce and the spicy devil one (forgot the exact name for it). For the side, I got the mac 'n cheese (it had jalapeno chunks that made it even better!) the first time and corn on the cob the second time. I would stick to the mac 'n cheese since it seems more like a specialty. My coworkers ordered the sausage links, ribs, brisket... and all enjoyed them very much. They definitely got their money's worth for the $7.99 lunch special(for a limited time?) 

Because I'm particularly fond of any banana-related dishes, I had to order the Banana Pudding, which was amaaaaazing! It came with Nilla wafers topped with whip cream in a huge tub that's great for its price. I will definitely come back if I'm ever around town."}
{"text":"Normally I don't update reviews unless there is a really big change. I making an exception here because the service and the food with that much better on this visit. Chris, our services, was outstanding. Made us feel very welcome and attended to our table very professionally. My wife and I shared the Q for two. It includes six ribs, half a chicken, and a third meat. We chose the brisket. Excellent choice! Delish! The ribs were once again outstanding - fall off the bone good. For our sides we chose the potato salad and the steak fries. Excellent sides for this meal. Much more food than we could finish. All for $24. And because we were there early enough for Happy Hour, $3 beer. Such a deal!! Nothing gourmet. Just a lot of very good food for a very fair price."}
{"text":"Guess what? Kids eat for .99 cents on mondays. And noone cares that my children are terrorizing me and being super picky. Staff is crazy friendly even when i had to ask the manager to change my sons chicken breast/wing for a leg/thigh because he cant get his fingers dirty. Thanks to our seever gregory who got my boys to try orange juice because they no longer serve apple juice. to the best place to bring your crazy and picky kids on a monday when youre too tired to cook."}
{"text":"Yes I'm just leaving the Famous Dave's on Blue Diamond and Norvell I was so disappointed in the customer service after I spend 70 some dollars they fill my order and this gentleman slams the order on the counter I think it's terrible and I'm just letting you know it was a horrible experience here and this is the first time I've had this experience and it's going to be the last time I have it here"}
{"text":"Food is great ALL the time and the customer service is out of this world...very fast and friendly staff. =)"}
{"text":"Service is always good and the food is always excellent, I would recommend this place to anybody"}
{"text":"Tried Famous Dave's for the first and last time yesterday at the North Las Vegas store. (#3180). Great corn bread and slaw, good brisket, nice atmosphere, clean, friendly service, but absolutely the worst ribs ever. Pork shouldn't taste like pigs smell. So disappointed that a rib joint would serve such poor quality pork..."}
{"text":"My first trip to a Famous Dave's was around Christmas and I have been back a few times already.

The food is FANTASTIC!!!!
I have liked everything I have ordered. My FAV is the wings, and I really can't say why. They are just full of meat. The seasoning the cook them in is perfect as is and adding the sauces only makes it 10x more yummy.

Our service experiences have typically better very good, with only one exception, which was quickly and sincerely remedied. 

Every time I have been to Famous Dave's, the manager has stopped by the table to ask how everything was. I just can't believe that every restaurants doesn't do this.

See you again REALLY SOON!!"}
{"text":"We have Famous Daves all over in SoCal and it has never appealed to me.  But then one day, my bro-in-law wanted something to eat and we made a quick pit stop to Famous Daves and ordered the burnt ends on a whim.  It was sooooo good.  I just love super charred, well-seasoned meat, and this just fits the bill.  I haven't tasted burnt ends in Kansas (since apparently, that's what they're know for).  However, I can say, that these are the best I have ever tasted.  I even tried burnt ends in the Famous Daves near where I live back home and it doesn't compare to the ones at this location.   I have since been back three different times to this place, and the burnt ends are just as good as when I first walked in the door.  I really can't comment on any other entree or meat since my preference have always been the burnt ends, so my review is not all that inclusive or conclusive.  I can say though that fries and chips are awesome, so I'm one happy camper when I'm here."}
{"text":"This experience was just meh! I have experienced much better.  The drink menu is a joke! You just have to guess how much a soda, beer, or mixed drink will cost you...there are no prices listed anywhere for the drinks.  I wanted a Bloody Mary but wasn't sure if I would even like the tomato mix they use here.

The rib tips we ordered had so many spices on them I had to scrape it off with my knife...they were inedible to me.  The cole slaw was great and so was the service.

Won't be coming back here...highly disappointed. : ("}
{"text":"We got a couple of pulled pork sandwiches that came with one side each. We got beans and potato salad. Very dissappointed the pork was so dry and the buns were semi hard. After dousing them with 21/2 packets of sauce it wasn't bad. The sauce was good but the sides weren't anything special. I can get the same at walmart. For the $ price I would go someplace else. $20 for everything. I guess the que for 2 would've been better. It will be long time before I come back."}
{"text":"The Texas Manhandler:

The sandwich that separates the men from the boys:  real Texas beef brisket and zesty hot link sausage, sliced thin, piled high and crowned with Hell-Fire Pickles all for only 9.49!  

Pretty decent bbq place...however definitely not as good as Memphis BBQ down the street near base."}
{"text":"I'll state the same thing most have stated above me. For a chain food restaurant, the BBQ isn't that bad. Their lunch specials are priced nicely and that is one of the main reasons I eat there. Service is okay, nothing stellar. The food itself is also okay. Hailing originally from Tennessee and having the pleasure of eating BBQ there has somewhat spoiled me and Dave's doesn't live up to TN BBQ. It's not bad though, definitely doable."}
{"text":"This is the only location I will attend. Great food that was served very fast. Out waiter Eric G was very attentive, friendly and helpful. We plan to ask for him every time we come. Loved loved loved the rib tips and you can't lose with free refills.  Thumbs up!!"}
{"text":"While on vacation, we visited this location! We don't have a Famous Dave's where we live so this was much needed! How I miss Famous Dave's!!!! The service was excellent!! Amy was our server. She was very attentive. The food was delicious!!! My hubby and I shared the feast for two, and it was a lot of food! Our kids enjoyed their meals as well! Definitely satisfied our BBQ cravings! We love Famous Dave's!!!"}
{"text":"Maybe it was just because I was starving - but I ate my entire plate of bbq ribs here and it was really good.

It started off a little sketchy.  The parking lot wasn't really full around 5:30 on a saturday ... we were sat quickly.  Waitress came with water and managed to spill it all over herself, the table, and 2 of us at the table.  Yikes!

So, after reading the water soaked menu's (which had a HUGE selection of choices), and attempting at drying our pants... , we ordered.  I had the bbq rib plate with green beans, corn, and cornbread.  Everything was really good.

But what I thought was especially cool was their selection of BBQ sauces.  I couldn't get enough of the \"devil's spit\" - my mouth was on fire and I was LOVING it.  They also had about 6 other choices - there's a sauce for everyone here!

It was BF's birthday and they sang and gave him a complementary ice cream plate.  Total bill for 5 people was $75, and that included 4 beers.  Not bad."}
{"text":"I blame my server for the one star review. She was just \"rushy\" and I just didn't like her service. She seemed as if her shift was ending and that we ruined her night by being seated in her section. My wife paid and I hope she didn't give her a tip. No customer service at all."}
{"text":"The food is always reliably good at this location. Remember: quality standards at national franchise restaurants can vary widely and wildly. This BDR location executes the FamDav franchise very well. 

What CAN make a difference in restaurant chains is SERVICE. Server Susan was knowledgeable, personable and charming. A real pleasant treasure."}
{"text":"I love the family platter.. and the cornbread is awesome!  the ribs are super tender and the brisket is off the hook.

service is friendly.. and usually pretty quick.
they have happy hour everyday from 2-6...

they have plates that are fairly priced if your a family.. or a pair.. even a trio.. .the portions are enough to share!!! 

cornbread.. trust, get extra."}
{"text":"Came in to grab a potato for lunch and was very satisfied. It was on a Saturday so there were no lunch specials available or advertised. I had to work really hard to pull a deal out of my waitress. I asked if they had a stuffed potato as none was on the menu and she said there was which actually came with a side and muffin but again wasn't advertised. Overall food was great and service fast and woulf have given this a five if they wouldn't have made choosing a lunch special so difficult."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch yesterday (8/23/14).  We were seated in a booth, and waited for our server.  After about 10 minutes, a young woman came by and said \"I'll be right back\".  Then she proceeded to go to the hostess stand, look at something, stand there awhile; when the hostess came back, she started a conversation with her - and never even acknowledging us again.  Not even a glass of water.  We waited at least 20 minutes for something to happen (and they were not crowded, there were only about 10-12 tables filled in the entire restaurant).  Finally, since she decided her conversation was more important, we left.  She saw us leave (after all, she was conversing with the hostess) and didn't even apologize.  There is no excuse for bad service in ANY restaurant.  Guess there wasn't a manager on duty to monitor."}
{"text":"For my first time at Famous Dave's, I can say that I was pretty impressed! The potato salad and mac 'n cheese were okay, but the red skinned mashed potatoes and the cornbread muffins were really good. The chili was great; a real nice spice. The beef brisket: excellent! And, to top it all off, the banana wafer pudding was a must-have sweet ending to our meal. Thanks for the southern flavor Dave! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"The service was good and the food hot and tasted good. I had a root beer float which was very good, along with pulled pork with Cole-slaw. It was good bur four people cost almost $80.00"}
{"text":"I am giving this Famous Daves a 5 star mostly because of the waiter we had. His name is Danny. When you go there make sure you get seated in his section. He is super friendly and always came to check on us with a HUGE smile on his face . These days you rarely get a waiter that is this awesome."}
{"text":"Came here on a suggestion from a friend. We were seated promptly and got our drink orders placed by one server. A different server came by about 15 minutes later to take our order--well after we were ready.

The fiance is weird about eating pork, so his loss--he had the brisket platter combo with baked beans and sweet corn. I ordered the pick 3 combo plate thing with the shredded pork platter, mac and cheese, and the small caesar salad. The server noted that the macaroni comes with jalapenos and is spicy, but she could get me plain mac and cheese--so that's what I asked for. Our food took another 30 minutes after placing our order to come out. We came in around 830, so it wasn't busy at all, but the server didn't once stop by to check on us or update us on times (e.g. \"only a few more minutes\" or something\" but looked like she avoided us in our corner booth a bit.

When our food did come out, she explained the BBQ sauces, answered all our questions, etc. The corn muffins were great but a bit crumbly, and my pork was tasty and soft and shreddable but not dried out. I tried a few of their sauces but I liked the original and the Texas ones the best. The beans were tasty, and the brisket was tender. My mac and cheese, though, tasted like Stouffer's from the frozen section. I was really hoping for something homemade and extra cheesy. 

My plate came with a mini brownie dessert. It came in a sundae cup, but was served with a soup spoon that was too wide to fit into the bottom of the cup to get to the bite-and-a-half of brownie that was in there. I asked for another spoon and was told that that was the smallest they had. What a weird way to serve food--in a way people can't eat it. Same with the plating of the saucy meat and bread on the paper: when I cut through it with my knife, I found paper ripped and shredded into my food. Not their fault, but it was something I had to look out for when eating. I guess you're supposed to pick it up like an open-faced sandwich/toast?

Overall, most of the food I found to be extremely tasty. Some of the service was slow for how late it was in the evening, and there was some snags in the meal. But the BBQ is great, and that's what I came for. Delicious! Would come again."}
{"text":"How does one really rate serialized mediocrity? Seriously.

Call me jaded by the marinade of Dr. Hogly Wogly and honest to god real backyard Que, but the factory Que here is just like a Denny's, in other words where you go if you don't want to risk success or failure, but just eat, a lot.

The best thing was their sides, but to be honest the \"Creamy Slaw\" was a carbon copy of KFC's. Does anybody know if they are the same chain? If so, that question is answered. It was not bad, in fact one of the reasons I do stop at KFC is the slaw. The potato salad was nice with the potatoes cooked completely and other veggies nice and crisp. Even the mac and cheese was great. However...

Sides are great, but Famous Dave's is a Que place so what counts is the meat. First off I had the brisket (like I've said, I am a beef guy) and my wife the baby backs. There are 5 different sauces to choose from, mild to \"oh my god that was supposed to be spicy but fell so far short that it can be chugged.\" No risk with the BBQ Sauces. The meat was indeed smoked, not sure with what, it was something other than an aged hard wood, I could taste some of the sap or something chemical you get from either softer woods or wood not completely aged and dried. The brisket was hot and moist when served, but dried on the plate and became mealy. Sauce could not help this. They did better with the baby backs, but then again, how can you not, the cut is so fatty in the first place. The only way to screw it up is to vastly over cook or grossly under cook. There is a huge \"done\" range for baby back ribs; they are forgiving. So I had a couple of those bones (see, I do not turn up my nose at the pig) and found they were just like everyone else's, read that Chili's and say Tony Roma's. Please note I am comparing chains here because as far as I know there is no chain in the world that pulls off superior Que.

Now we get to things like service and atmosphere. Our server was over every 3 minutes, is everything okay? So will you be back? And so on. It was annoying and as a matter of fact, no I won't be you over eager twit! To say I was annoyed is an understatement. I had my watch out, she literally stopped by every 3 to 5 minutes. Talk about desperate. I normally tip about 30% or more because I know a good tip can make your night, but sorry, good old standard 10% for you, I just couldn't open my wallet that wide is was chaffed from all the inquiries as to when I would be spending more there. The décor was cookie cutter, as if they have done it about a thousand times (which I guess they have) and while comfortable did not impress.

Over all this place should get about a 2 1/2 stars from me, but since I can't give a half star I will be generous and round up to a simple 3 stars since I recognize that some people are going to love it. But believe me you can make better Que on your Weber at home any day of the week.

This will not make my \"Cheers Spots\" but will make my \"BBQ search list\" since it is Que after all, sort of."}
{"text":"***My 100th review***

I LOVE bbq, so when my bf suggested we go to Famous Dave's for dinner Halloween night, I was game! Because it was Halloween, there was no wait and we were seated right away. We decided on the feast for 2, priced at $39.99 and comes with a LOT of food. Half a rack of spare ribs, half a chicken, and your choice of either pulled pork or brisket, we chose pork, corn on the cob, cornbread muffins, potato wedges and 2 sides, we chose beans and mac and cheese. The food came out within 15 minutes and I was surprised at how much food there was! We happily dug in.

My favorite item I had was the ribs. They were perfectly smoked and tender and the meat was almost falling off the bone. The chicken and pulled pork were tasty as well. The beans had pieces of bacon in them and were delicious. The mac and cheese had corn and jalapenos mixed in, which was different but good. I really like the different bbq sauces they have sitting at the table for you to use with your meal. They have 5 of them from sweet to inferno spicy. My favorite is the Georgia Mustard, its a vinegary sauce and its tangy and delicious on the different meats. We didn't even come close to finishing everything and had plenty to take home for the next day. Our server was awesome, I forgot his name but he was attentive and friendly. I would most definitely recommend this place, and will be back in the future, especially for the feast for 2."}
{"text":"This place is overall a great representation of the chain. It is still only a BBQ chain and therefore not the absolute best I've ever had but with that said the staff have always helped me to have a great experience. They're always quick and attentive and I think the price for the amount of food you get is a very high value! Recommend for a quick dinner and a drink. If you can, definitely sit at the bar as the service seems to be even faster there!"}
{"text":"I was a fan for a long time and I really love the Devil Spit BBQ sauce, but they changed their fries! Why did they change something that didn't need fixing??? They went from awesome steak fries to some accountant's version of a better French fry! This was a \"go to\" lunch spot. Now with their not so famous fries, it's off the regular lunch roster."}
{"text":"Love some BBQ granted after having Texas BBQ this isn't the best, but it is the best close to home.  Great for carry out - call ahead and they have the orders ready to go.  Lunch is also good - save a few dollars and go early.  All the sauce variety is really nice too.

Never had a bad experience at this location, good staff, good service, good food and good left-overs!"}
{"text":"Memphis BBQ is superior by far. The BBQ ribs I bought at Dave's tasted like they came from the grocery store deli. The sauce tasted like something you'd find in  a plastic bottle on the shelf of a Food4Less. I've had their bottled sauce but I kind of expected it to be a little more homemade at the restaurant itself. The ribs were missing that smokey, charcoal flavor one would come to expect  from a good restaurant. They really did taste like they were made at a Walmart deli. 

And I think I should mention that is was the saltiest BBQ I've had since 1982 (yeah, had an experience back then I STILL remember). It was appalling. 

 I paid over $27. The \"big slab\" aka the full rack seemed to be a half rack size instead. I've been eating BBQ for over 40 years (used to live at Silver Dollar City in Pigeon Forge back in the 70's--lucky me) and I know what a full rack should look like plus what good BBQ should taste like. Their sides are KFC sized, not hardy and filling like i\"ve gotten at literally every other BBQ restaurant I've ever eaten at. Additionally, they didn't even have horseradish like Memphis BBQ does (theirs is the best I've ever tasted BTW). 

Famous Dave's is nothing more than an extension of their bottle quality sauces. A restaurant should hold itself to a much higher standard than what the grocery store offers. 

The one compliment I will give them is that the ribs are very meaty, just not a full rack of ribs. I feel so ripped off. If I hadn't ordered it as takeout but instead and dined in I would have asked for a refund. I'm sorry, but your restaurant is for the less discriminating, less initiated palate and targets those who've never experienced good BBQ in their whole lives."}
{"text":"Ordered them through Uber eats and they let my Ultimate burger be delivered with missing I'm pretty sure what makes it an \"Ultimate\" the pork!! After a long day of work and looking forward to a good bbq dinner, this just killed it for me. Just curious how NO ONE caught the mistake. Everything was there except the pork. If i wanted a regular burger i would of just ordered McDonald's or some crap."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's sure met our expectations. Really cool ambience. The food was excellent. We were able to order dry rub ribs...then added our own sauce. Our waitress was very helpful with our menu selection. She even honored our Groupon with a free dessert. Much alohas!"}
{"text":"So being an Texan at heart my husband and I had some reservations about BBQ in Vegas but we decided to go to their happy hour (2-6) and omg...IT WAS AMAZING!!! We got 6 rib tips for $6.99 brisket and chicken quesadillas (4 slices of each) for $5.99 and the Georgia pull pork sliders for $1.49 each (we got 2). When I tell u we were full and SO SATISFIED!!!! The food was awesome!!! Even our waiter was great! Food and service was GREAT!! I can honestly say this BBQ IS TEXAN APPROVED and \"ballin' on a budget\" friendly!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend loves this place and always wants to go, but I just think it's okay.  I like the cornbread muffins a lot.  But am not a fan of the beef brisket.  I usually ask for a side order of pulled chicken which is nice and tender.  I want to try the ribs, but haven't yet.  

The service has always been really good here, very down to earth servers which can be hard to find in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The brisket is by far the best I have ever had although it is not consistent.  They have very good service and the manager always visits every table to check on you. 

They are slowly but surly taking all the market share from Memphis BBQ"}
{"text":"This place was pretty good for a \"food chain.\" The prices are reasonable and the portions are HUGE! You will get your bang for your buck here. Our waitress was nice and made sure our drinks were constantly filled. I ordered the lunch 2 meat combo, for $8.99 you won't be disappointed. I ordered the brisket and pork ribs. My brisket was nice and moist, I wish the pieces were a slight bit bigger(and they might be w/ the dinner portion?) and the 1/2 rack of ribs were delicious! The corn bread muffin is to die for! Super moist and even better w/ honey!! I didn't care for their zesty pickles as they were sweet pickles turned spicy? The servers bring out a small bowl of bbq chips for you to try the 6 different bbq sauces on the table. My only complaint is that the chips are bbq seasoned so it's hard to really taste the sauces, it would be better w/ plain potato chips."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's are always a bit of a hit and miss for me. It's chain restaurant BBQ, that in itself should describe the mediocrity. This particular one is worse than some. While I will say the staff was attentive, though there weren't very many patrons at approximately 3 in the afternoon. But unfortunately it was the food that gives it only a three star. While I am a huge fan of BBQ everything I got was very dry and dry BBQ just doesn't go down well. The best part of my meal was definitely the cornbread though, the one redeeming factor lightly honey toasted and no bits of corn which I know some people love but I unfortunately do not."}
{"text":"Famous Daves........I drive by and all I can think about is bbq. Not real hungry so I decided to get the Devil's Spit burger and fries. 
Well there is nothing special about this burger. It has a patty, bacon, and pepper jack cheese. And a couple of there famous pickles. You can tell this is a premade Sysco or US foods patty. Nobody makes there own anymore. Might as well go to Burger King order a whopper and add some of there Devils spit BBQ sauce to it (you can buy it at any grocery store).

Skip the burger.
Order ribs 

Ps.....bring back the Frito Pie"}
{"text":"Took my niece and nephew out to dinner last night before watching fireworks. Must have been the best time to go. Only half full restaurant so we got our food pretty quick. Food was good, hot, fresh!

Also this was my first time to eat the Ultimate. It was pretty good. It's a burger with jalapeño bacon and piled with pulled pork. And they add there beam and cola BBQ sauce."}
{"text":"I remembered Famous Dave's as being better than it was here. Although the service was very good, the food left me hanging. The burnt brisket tub sandwich was super tough and chewy and my side of Mac and cheese was bland and tasteless. Hubby's ribs were tough and disappointing. The only thing that they seemed to get fit were the fries. Which isn't reason enough for me to return."}
{"text":"A bunch of idiots working here choose any other place! Worst service ever! And bugs in the restroom. STAY AWAY
More like half a star at its best"}
{"text":"My fiancée and I went to order food to go. Fiancée ordered the food took a little long. Lady said it was taking long because they were finishing heating the muffins. Fiancée told them he didn't care for the muffin so the order can go without it. She said okay and would get the order. At least three people came after us and left before us. When the food finally came, fiancée asked for a side of sauce lady said she would go and get it. She left and came back no sauce by that time we were so frustrated we left. When she saw our upset faces she asked her the gentlemen helping her to get it by then we were out the door. And when we came home the order had no muffin in it. So I wonder what took so long to get our order?"}
{"text":"I had the rib tips and they were a tad dry but had good flavor.  The selection of sauces are awesome and their hottest is actually hot (Wilbur's Revenge)."}
{"text":"Check out the chili I can eat this 7 days a week .. And the corn bread is the best in town. For family's try the family pack sample."}
{"text":"A good server starts with good eye contact. Then he is dedicated to delivering requests promptly, with a hint of humor and a bit of rapport. So I'm giving the service 4 stars. 

Our party ordered the barbq fam feast platter with ribs, tri-tip, corn, cornbread, fries, coleslaw, etc.
  

Not a 5 rating because, unfortunately, the best thing on there was their wedge fries, fried to perfection. Crispy texture on cue. Ribs were not as juicy as I was expecting. And tri-tip tasty but a little dry that I needed to drench in devil's spit sauce. Ive probably enjoyed food at FD's a handful of times  but the food was mediocre for a 12:30pm visit. I'm getting the suspicion that this was last night's leftover food."}
{"text":"We decided to beat the heat and try a new place to eat (didn't mean to rhyme). Got there around 3pm on a Saturday afternoon. There were a few other tables full but I wouldn't say it was crowded.

We ordered the Feast for 2 and my son ordered the macaroni and cheese. 

Macaroni and cheese was just blue box Kraft, which my son actually prefers over any fancier creamier version. Unfortunately there was a chunk of slightly burnt noodles obviously form the bottom of the pan, but the remainder was tasty and kept my kid happy. It came with fries which were nicely seasoned, a drink (good ol' white milk for us), and a two pack of Oreo cookies. Reasonable price for that amount of food.

Feast for 2: 
1) half a slab of St.Louis style ribs - tasty, easy to bite off bone; would have preferred some more sauce.
2) 1/2 a country-roasted chicken - moist and flavorful, similar to rotisserie chicken; next time we would try the BBQ chicken in hopes of having the right sauce. Four different BBQ sauce choices but none were just right. We ended up mixing Sweet and Zesty and Rich and Sassy.
3) Georgia chopped pork - very tasty; would have loved more sauce. It would be really good as a sandwich which I believe they do have.
4) Coleslaw - not that \"creamy\" as they proclaim; a little on the bitter side; could have used a thicker and tangier sauce.
5) Wilbur Beans - interesting tangy and mildly zesty Beans. I actually enjoyed this as I had not tasted this combination of flavors before.
6) Corn on the cob - four half cobs; a little over cooked having that saturated soggy water taste. I will probably cut it off the cob and mix it in with something else.
7) Fries - steak fry wedges delightfully crispy and crunchy; tasted good with a mixture of the BBQ sauces 
8) Corn bread muffins (2) - honestly the best cornbread muffin or cake I have ever had at a BBQ place; just the right amount of corn flavor but moist enough you're not choking on crumbs like I have in the past.

Overall it was a satisfying meal. We ended up taking a lot of it home as it was obviously a lot of food. I gave it three stars for a good meal; nothing mind blowing but nothing strongly disappointing enough to ruin my meal."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile now. Being from Southern California, I've had a lot of bbq in my life. I came here with Mr parents and girlfriend. We were greeted when we walked inside the doors and were quickly given a table. Menu was large with many different options to choose from. My parents ordered the Burnt ends and Ribs, and the chopped pork. For sides they got the Mac n cheese, dirty rice, and green beans. My girlfriend and I got the Feast for Two. What amazed us was that we waited no more than ten minutes and our food was out on our table piping hot. Absolutely amazing food. Great taste and texture to all the meats. Their six sauces on the table were equally as good. I tried a little of all of them including the XXX sauce. All 4 of us were blown away by how good the food is here. All the employees were very friendly and welcoming. Definitely a must try for anyone who likes bbq. The pricing is good for what you get. The daily specials and happy hour menus make me want to come here more often."}
{"text":"I would definitely recommend this place to everyone. I mean I know it's well known but still lol 
We went there with a party of 8 people and a baby and they were so nice to us. 
Their food and sauces were really really good! I, personally, do not usually like bbq sauce because I always like dry rub on my ribs but their sauce was really good. 4 of us split the feast thing for 2-3 people which was PLENTY there was 4 of us and we were all full at the end of the night. so It's like perfect for 4 people. if two people ordered it, they would def have left over for the next day, WHICH I do not recommend. I love left over food, for some reason they taste really good to me. My sister had left over and she didn't eat it the next day so I did lol and it honestly was not good. At all. So if you're going to order something, just eat it there and don't bother taking it home, it just didn't taste right for me. 
My nephew had a kids meal, pull pork sandwich. He got food poisoning from it that night. and threw up like 7 times till the following day....so..maybe it something he ate earlier or it was just that day but I would stir clear...just incase. 
I wish I remember the girl that waited us because she was really nice. 
I hope this help. Other than my nephew getting sick, it went pretty well.
Devil's Spit mix with the mustard one is REALLY good."}
{"text":"This was our first time at a Famous Dave's. The service was amazing and so was the food! We had the meal for 2 people. Everything was delicious! The corn muffins, the ribs & the coleslaw were my favs! Can't wait to eat the leftovers!"}

 who waited on us they were amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent service almost everytime I come here. When I am hungry and can't think what I want to eat I always end up here. Everything on the menu is awesome and your food usually arrives within 10 minutes of ordering. I put Devil's Spit sauce on everything.

I recommend ordering the feast for two or feast for four so you can try everything. Don't forget to order sweet tea also."}
{"text":"Am I a BBQ fan? Umm not so much but i came having an open mind and empty stomach. 

I really didn't find it anything special. We chopped on the sampler app and the meat just seemed mediocre. It didn't seem to have any special spicy love in it. Maybe I'm not the BBQ type... maybe I'm spoiled from my grandfather bbq cooking.. or maybe it just wasn't that good. 

The only thing I enjoyed was the happy hour special that begins at 9pm which was the wings and fries. Can't beat that price. Even then I've had better wings. Which my favorite are from outback. 

Customer service was good. restaurant was clean. Prices are reasonable. Decor is adorable. Food,.. meh. I want some finger licking spicy tangy goodness and this just did not do it for me."}
{"text":"This is an ok BBQ place. We didn't hate it, but we surely didn't love it either. My wife is from the south so it was incredibly hard for her to like it. For me, it was a hit or miss. Sometimes when we go, we have good service, sometimes its bad. Sometimes when we go the food is cooked perfectly, sometimes its overdone. If you're in the mood for good BBQ food, I wouldn't know where to send you, but you'd have to be in the mood for BBQ big time to come here. The best part of this place is their dessert. The banana bread pudding and the pecan pie are absolutely amazing. Seeing as this place isn't a dessert place, I had to only give it a 3. Would've been 2 if the dessert wasn't so good."}
{"text":"It was our first time there as we were passing through LAS! We heard about this location on The Food Channel and stopped in around 8:00pm on a Saturday night. Being a \"newbie\" to this franchise, we choose a platter combination. Well, we can truthfully say we were impressed with the \"2 Person Sampler Platter\"! OMG it feed our party of 3 adults completely and we still had left overs. A great BBQ variety (pork, beef, chicken), corn-on-the-cob, fluffy corn bread, crispy/ hot French fries and their wide variety of sweet, hot and tangy BBQ sauces that were to everyone's liking. Service was on par and our waiter was always on top of everything.  Wish we had one in South Florida (Broward County) were we long for a new BBQ establishment (sigh) for it is a distance (+2000 miles) to indulge our monthly foodie carvings.
Cheers!"}
{"text":"So I'm a 3 time Iraqi vet and I just recently separated from military service.  Came here on veteran's day to enjoy the patriotic meal they advertised but was denied the discount because my ID card was a tan colored card often mistaken for a dependent card.  Talked to the manager (Ilene) and she refused to look at my card saying it's pink so therefore your a dependent. I politely tried to explain that a dependent card is ?D form 1173 while mine stated DD form 2765. Despite the food being pretty good, the service/attitudes of the staff not only made me not want to come back, but also the group i was with. If i ever decide to eat at a famous daves again, it wont be the one at Cannery Corner (Losee/Craig).Well thank you for supporting us veterans I guess..."}
{"text":"My friend Jerry had told me about this place, during my last year's visit. So this year, we checked it out. We were sited quickly on a Tuesday night.Jerry ordered fried fish (I'm not really sure). I wanted ribs and the full slab was on special that night. Along with the 2 sides.

The order came, I was surprised how big the slab was. The ribs were warm, easy to cut.  We shared them because it was going to be too much for me. Our server came by and checked to see how the food was. She asked if we needed refills for the Arnold Palmers. 

We also put in a to go order, It arrived about the time when we were ready to go. I would go back again. 

Thanks Famous Dave's!"}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times. Definitely the place to go when you're craving good BBQ. I think I've had just about everything from the sausage, ribs, catfish and my fav pulled pork. The catfish is kind of expensive for the portion you get, but no complaints on any of the other meats.

I'm not really a fan of the sides. Nothing better than what you can get at your neighborhood deli, but I'm okay with that. Their apple are good though!

Try it.. pretty cheap too!"}
{"text":"Up 1 star for pulled chicken sandwich.
Down 10 stars for horrible brisket. 

I know it's brisket but, this was way too fatty and the parts that weren't fatty were tough as tires. Adding insult injury, an employee tried to convince me that's how it's supposed to be. The location in Hayward, California, can teach her how it's done!

Haven't tried the other Vegas locations. Stay away from the location on Blue Diamond Rd!"}
{"text":"I was always a big fan of Memphis Championship BBQ but then I found Famous Dave's and haven't been there that often.

There's the bar area to the left with what seems like a full bar and big screen TVs.  Main dining area in the middle, watch your fingers especially when their BBQ on them they might go missing.  And the To-go area to the right.

The best part of Famous Dave's is their food of course.  And there's that email for a mystery birthday gift, just signing up for their P.I.G. club online.  The email usually doesn't tell you want you get but you can anything from desserts to the all-american bbq feast.  Still haven't gotten the all-american bbq feast but I'll continue to try as long as they keep sending me the email.

I've had their hot fudge kahlua brownie talk about a dessert, yummy. Their wings are also really good especially when their dunked in that rich and sassy bbq sauce. Their BBQ ribs and brisket are good."}
{"text":"Good food and good service! had to beat that. Angela was our server and she was GREAT. Steve was the manager and very knowledgeable and friendly.  OK the food, so much food, I'm still full. We had Half a rack of spare ribs, half a chicken, pulled pork,  brisket, corn on the cob, cornbread muffins, potato wedges and beans and mac and cheese. The food came out quick hot and perfect. I can't say enough about this place, just south of the strip.  Save some money by coming here while in Vegas gambling."}
{"text":"Last Friday was my birthday.  I had my choice of any reasonable restaurant in Las Vegas.  I made the terrible mistake of choosing Famous Dave's on Blue Diamond.  I was there with 8 family members.  I ordered chicken and brisket.  The server was kind enough to ask if I wanted white meat or dark.  I said I would prefer the white meat. 

Service was a little slow, but that was understandable with a large party on a Friday night.  Our server was very professional and did a good job.  However when my meal arrived, it was brisket and a leg and thigh of the chicken.  I didn't  want to make a fuss, since I was there with a large group.   Then I tried to eat the brisket.  It was the very worst brisket I've ever tried to eat.  It was a blend of pure fat and meat so charred, it could be used as charcoal.  

I can definitely recommend this as a place to avoid!"}
{"text":"I've been to several different locations of Dave's Famous BBQ, this was the worst. 

It's usually very good.  This time the service was very slow and the food was terrible.  My brisket was tough, dried out, oily and tasteless.  The others' brisket was tough and dry.  The chicken tenders and muffins were about the only edible items among the five of us.  Very sad.  

But, please don't let this stop you from trying other locations.  Most are very good.  

There are so many alternatives in this area, I just won't try this again."}
{"text":"we ordered the feast one time and tried everything and we end up with our favorite
big slab and the potato chips....
cornbread is really good.

I don't like the size of their lunch special too small.

happy hour special is not bad at all too!"}
{"text":"Terrible BBQ!!!! I will never eat at a Famous Dave's again. Horrible flavor and even worse sides. This is the worse BBQ I've ever had."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I usually love Famous Dave's. My husband isn't a fan but I drag him along every now and then when I crave ribs. The thing is, I despise BBQ sauce. HATE IT. So I love that they offer their ribs unsauced, or as they call it, naked. So tonight I ordered to-go. Their to-go service is usually lacking. They put you on hold for forever and tonight was no different. The girl on the phone questioned my name twice and how to spell it, when I have a very common name but whatever. I said, I would like a half a rack of ribs and as I begin to say, unsauced, she cuts me off and says, THE MEAL?! Wow. Don't have to yell. But yeah, I'd like the meal. Then I made sure to emphasize, unsauced and she repeated it. Well, the biggest mistake of the night was sending my husband to go pick up my food. He gets home and immediately I noticed, BBQ sauce. AWESOME... NOT! I called and they put me on hold over and over again and all the manager can do is offer to send me a coupon in the mail or remake them now and I'd have to go back to pick them up. Yeah, no. I don't know what I expect, just better service I suppose? The people on the phone are so rude and the hold times... anyway, pick it up Famous Dave's or you will lose a customer."}
{"text":"Came here with a big party. We were put in the very back of the restaurant and forgot about. Service sucks! Staff was preoccupied but the food is great!!"}
{"text":"Food was great had the 6 rib with slaw and rice. Everything was fantastic except the weak drinks. Had two gin and tonics made with tanqueray and both were equally as bad"}
{"text":"Where do I start, ok this place rocks! We go here on dates and with the family. The bar is separate and very chill. They always have the drinks that we order. As far as the family side very warm and welcoming. Staff is super friendly and servers usually advise of other menu options to save you money and get the same if not more food. They also have a to-go area if you can't stay, you order in advance and pick up or walk in and order. It's super convenient and they have pick up parking right out side the door. It's separate from the entrance so you can always come in uniform without feeling strange. Their restrooms are always clean and fully stocked. Great job to all the team members, and thank you for being wonderful!!!"}
{"text":"Loved the rub on the ribs! Happy Hour until 6pm and 9pm to close. Very filling. One portion can be shared by two."}
{"text":"It's never good when you feel like you have to start a review with \"where to begin.\"

So...where to begin?

Let's start with the service. If you haven't noticed, service is a big deal to me. I work in a service industry, I appreciate customer service, and I know what it takes to provide good service (most of the time it's just being nice - ya, that's pretty much it). The service at this establishment was very hit and miss. Our waitress, Stacie had moments where she was very attentive and nice and moments where she was quite possibly the most overbearing and annoying server I've ever had. Let's start with the bad. I understand that every server has a unique style that works for them. However, Stacie felt that it was necessary to call my wife and I \"Young man\" and \"Young lady\" every time she stopped at our table. She literally (no exaggeration here) said those phrases at least 25 times while we were eating there. I'm not sure how old she is, but certainly wasn't old enough to use this term. It just came across as obnoxious. I'm not 5, I'm not in trouble, and your not in a senior citizens home, so don't call me young man. Do you need a refill young man? Can I take your order young man? And you young lady? Anything else young man? STOP IT!!!! Stacie then asked us if \"our food was delicious.\" Unfortunately it wasn't, and this bothered her. She managed that situation very well and it's obvious that she cares about the product coming out of the kitchen. For that I praise her, I just don't care for an overbearing, loud, obnoxious personality when I'm dining (unless I'm at Dick's Last Resort). 

Now to the food. We tossed around the idea of trying a few different restaurants. I'm sad we didn't pick the others. This was our second experience with Famous Dave's and it was equally, if not more disappointing than the first. I just don't see what others get out of this place. Their bbq sauces at the table might be some of the worst tasting sauces in the history of bbq. I ordered a pulled bbq chicken sandwich with a side of jalapeno mac-n-cheese. My sandwich was okay, the chicken was very dry though. The mac-n-cheese was awful. It tasted like they cooked the mac-n-cheese then just dumped the jalapenos in after everything was cooked. Not good. My wife ordered a grilled chicken sandwich. All I could smell was burned chicken. It came with nothing on it, the meat wasn't seasoned at all, and it was very overcooked. She ordered the slaw with it which she said was very good. The sandwich was boring, overcooked, and the presentation was very undesirable. 

Upon telling the server that the food wasn't \"delicious.\" She sent over a manager. We appreciated him stopping by, and we were very honest with him. He did everything right and offered to replace my wifes sandwich. We declined and told him that this was our second experience here and we just weren't satisfied. He gave us various options but we decided to just stick with what we had and agreed that this would be our last experience at Dave's. 

Lucille's at the District is a much better BBQ option that Famous Daves. I'd rather just not eat than have to eat here again.

Famous Daves...you are the weakest link...goodbye."}
{"text":"I went there on my wife birthday and we had a good time prior to this we have not been here in many years. But nonetheless the service was outstanding the food was quick and good and they also brought my wife a birthday Sunday but I called ahead to arrange that."}
{"text":"I went there with my hubby it was lunch time we wanted bbq ribs anyways our waiter was a lady I forgot her name. We order some ribs and fries for appetizer mind you we were very hungry when we finally got our food it had a blonde hair on it we ask the waiter to just make us another plate that was the first red flag we didn't leave as we wanted to give them another chance well not the best idea. The time pass we were enjoying our food when our waiter came and Ask us if it would be okay for her to bring the check over since she was getting off the floor we told her that was fine. Well she kept coming to take plates away asking if we took care of the check already we felt rush as if she wanted us gone so she could collect her tips and leave I was getting very irritated we didn't even finish our drinks. She took my cornbread I wasnt even finish eating it. We will never coming back that's for sure!!"}
{"text":"I don't venture out much to this side of town, being that I reside in Henderson. After a dedication of my best friend's twins at their church nearby, us hungry worshippers occupied the 'party/large group' area. There were about 20-25 of us in our party. Upon arrival, the host opened the door for our large party, arriving sporadically (that's a lot of door opening on a windy day!). The tables were arranged family style, one long table seating 20 of us, with a few overflow tables. They quickly supplied carseat holders for the twins, who were snoozing away in their infant carriers, and asked if we wanted the cupcakes that we had brought in, to be placed in their fridge. (no qualms about bringing outside food into their restaurant!). 

Complimentary potato 'chips' were aplenty, drink orders were filled and our cups were never empty, even with the amount of people in our party. My BBQ chicken platter, corn muffin, and garlic mashed potatoes were delicious. It helps that I'm slightly biased because I love their variety of sauces and even buy them at the grocery store. Fantastic meal, fantastic staff, and fantastic celebration of two little humans that I love very much."}
{"text":"Overly seasoned with salt and the most unfriendly female bar tenders I've ever encountered!"}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ I've had!! I've been to Rolling smoke BBQ but I recommend anyone in vegas who wants amazing ribs and Brisket to come to Famous Daves! Came here with my girlfriend, we were craving some good BBQ and were completely impressed. Our Server Rich was awesome and gave us the best service. Food came out fast and he was on point bringing us our drinks quickly. This place even has a late night happy hour to boot! Thank you Famous Daves we will be back"}
{"text":"OMG .. We love this place .. Good service, very friendly. For sure we are coming back again."}
{"text":"I am bummed I waited so long to try this place. This BBQ is great, if you want REAL, meaty ribs then this is the place. It was pretty pricey (I guess average for BBQ in Vegas) but they do offer a happy hour. I would also like to recommend the mac and cheese, yum!"}
{"text":"The food was great. We gave our server Jen a complicated order and everything was perfect. She was friendly from start to finish! Definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"I'm a fan of bbq and portions and Famous Dave's deliver. 

I visit this location often and my latest visit has been the best. I'm not sure what they did with the outside- but the colors pop and it looks like a whole new building. The food was fast and delicious and they even changed the plating. Whatever changes that they've been making works. Great BBQ and service every time!"}
{"text":"So, I'm not sure why this place was so terrible, but I'll try my best to explain. 

I'm a big Dave's fan, and this is the third location I have been to. First in California, then the one near the Galleria mall, and then this one. 

The first two were similar with atmosphere and nice dim lighting and delicious food 

This one.... Boy... It was almost like a school cafeteria with no privacy, extremely bright lights, and weird layout. Not to mention the food tasted like it was heated up in a microwave and not the usual fresh tender amazing meat

I have not let this visit spoil my taste for Famous Dave's, however I will never return to this location"}
{"text":"FOOD: Salad was ok, though lacking in bacon and lousy with cheddar cheese. Brisket was tender and tasty. Rib tips were SMOTHERED in ground pepper and very skimpy on the actual meat. 

SERVICE: At the bar, very energetic. Food came quick, and she was very chipper.

AMBIANCE: Bar. BBQ. In North Vegas."}
{"text":"Not so good experience my last luncheon at this location. Server was quick to sit us but then seemed like we were lost in Tuesday no serve zone . Literally no water, no nothing . Felt like I was the remake of the invisible man . Finally after waving someone down we get a attitude and quick served like a Nast tennis player . No thank you no nothing . All in all 90 minute lunch $52 for meals with no love . Total disaster . Hopefully will be better next time. Will be back , just maybe not lunch time ."}
{"text":"Came here with my bf because we were craving bbq. 

We had a late lunch and sat at the bar. The bartender was nice and fast. The food was good too. We have the brisket sandwich, chili, and Cesar salad."}
{"text":"We ordered the feast for 2 and 3 orders of 2 meats 1 side with ribs, rib tips, brisket, hot-links, fries, Mac and cheese, coleslaw corn and potato salad. Everything was very good especially the muffins but I will say they are a bit heavy handed on the salt to say the least. 

We had tons of left overs and the prices are bad at all but the meat can be a bit dry so it's important to grab as many bbq sauces as you can (just in case). 

They aren't the best bbq I've had but they definitely offer a decent meal at a decent price. Grab water because you'll need it with all that salt but other than that, food was decent. It was made to go so the bread was soggy but won't knock them for that considering it was a to go order"}
{"text":"This place is always fairly slow at lunch time but what place isn't. Today was the worst by far! Two of us came here for lunch around 11:45. We got sat right away and got our drinks. Our waitress was nice but you could already tell she was fairly frazzled. We placed our order and that's when things took a turn down hill. It took us an hour to get our food. My friends food came out luke warm if not totally cold. But she ate it anyways. My food was just gross. My rib tips were super tough and covered in a thick grease. And my hot link was not only not spicy but cold. Now yes I'm sure we could have sent our food back but we had already waited an hour. I picked at my food and decided it wasn't worth eating. We asked our waitress for our check and she disappeared for about ten minutes. She came back with the check and asked if I needed a box. I politely said no the food wasn't that good but thank you. She said she would send her manager over. The manager came over with our credit cards in hand and gave them back to us. She loudly asked why I thought the food was gross. And said to say something next time so that we could enjoy our food. I tried to explain to her that we didn't have time to send the food back after already waiting an hour but she was already walking away. Needless to say I don't think I will be back to this location."}
{"text":"I normally don't go to places like this but my family member wanted to go. I had a the grilled chicken sandwich with broccoli and cornbread. Needless to say, it was very good and the cornbread was amazin'. On top of all that, our waitress was such a sweetheart. xx"}
{"text":"Good food, worst, worst, worst service ever.  
The hostess forgot to seat us.  It is pretty hard since there was no one there when we got there and she started seating others when they were arriving.  Lots of other things in between, but it took 4 minutes for 3 adults and one child to get food.
never again"}
{"text":"Before I start:  I can't figure out why the representative photo of this restaurant in North Las Vegas (Craig Road) is a baby changing station.  To each his own, I suppose!

I have a love-hate relationship with Famous Dave's.  After dining at the Flamingo Road and Craig Road locations several times, I can tell you their food is consistently good.  Their service, however can be hit or miss.  It's never bad, but not always good.

If you haven't been, here are a few things to consider trying:  the Devil's Spit Brisket Burger, Burnt Ends Sandwich, a Stuffed Baked Potato, or just grab a plate of Brisket with some sides.  It's all pretty tasty.

For military folks in Las Vegas, on Monday they offer a 15% discount for active and retired military, and $0.99 meals for kids!  Hard to go wrong with that deal!

Overall Famous Dave's is a good option to get your necessary dose of BBQ.  Give it a go, just accept the service for being hit or miss, and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Good bbq and reasonable prices. Love the sassy chicken salad and can get smalle portions at any time. The kids meals are well balanced and a nice treat. The family always loves bringing home some corn muffins for the next day.
The service is very efficient and friendly."}
{"text":"We had a great time, food was perfect. Friendly and fast service. Easy parking. We shared a salad and they splitted it in separate dishes at kitchen for us, so kind."}
{"text":"Sometimes one needs a chain restaurant for its consistency. This was that place and that moment in time. 
We just needed a little bit after the airport--something with flavor, but nothing which would overwhelm and make us sleepy. This is where the Burnt End Appetizer comes in. This fare, combined with a Sweet Tea, makes for the nicest nosh. The fried onions ad chilled pickles enhance the carmelized goodness.
We went straight to the bar area and ordered from there. The server was great, quick, and didn't hover. I totally appreciated the refills without the hassle.
A fulfilling stop!"}
{"text":"I like famous daves but this is by far the worse establishment of them. Food was incorrectly made and nothing was done to make up for it or make us want to come back. Oh besides make us wait longer while they remade our food. Sorry Dave will not return"}
{"text":"Best ribs in town, better then tony romas and chilis dry rub.
their secret is they smoke their ribs, and then apply their signiture
bbq sauce. Yum!"}
{"text":"First of all I want to say this is my favorite restaurant. But had never been to any other location. We've always stuck to the Henderson location. I should have gone to Craig Rd!


There were 5 adults and 1 child in our party. We invited some friends who had never been and we couldn't we  wait for them to try your food. We came in knowing what we would order but the waiter Benito took over 10 min to even take our drink order. Once he arrived, we also placed our meal order. We got the American feast with brisket, ribs and chicken and a kids meal. Our drinks arrived via busser and bartender, however the firsy 2 draft beer choices my husband ordered were out so he ordered his 3rd choice. One of our drinks (cranberry juice) didn't arrive until right before our meal (Roughly about 25 min after placing order). 1. Though there was some trouble getting the drinks we wanted and the quality service we are used to getting at Famous Dave's, we looked past that to try to enjoy our night. 2. 15 min after placing order we were told there was NO chicken. Which is why I to there. As much as I love brisket, I was there for the chicken and bragged about it to our guests. Why wait so long to tell us? There were only 3 other parties in the restaurant and they all had their meals already do its not like they ordered at the same time we did and took the last chicken. By this time I was pretty upset because the cooks waited so long to tell Benito the news. We ordered pulled pork instead. 3. Once our food finally arrived, the kid's meal ordered still had not. We asked waiter, he never placed thr poor child's order. Our guests decided to not evening bother. We were hungry and everything was taking too long. The child just ate out of our food. Which is completely fine being that there was plenty to go around. But the child didn't order any of the things we did. The meats we ordered were delicious and well prepared. They tasted fresh and the sides did too. No complaints there. 

But I am embarrassed to have taken my friends there. Especially because they wanted to go elsewhere but we bragged so much about FD that they were convinced FD was the best choice. As a regular customer, I will stick to my good ol' Henderson location and never again recommend any FD location to anyone. Instead I will share how horrible this experience was even though I consider FD to be my favorite restaurant. I understand some things are out reach for the waiter or cooks. But all we wanted was to be told sooner that there was no chicken and expected our waiter to at least get our drinks right."}
{"text":"It was my favorite place, but the fiod quality has gone down. My mac n cheese was cold, it felt like it was microwaved back to hot. I dont know maybe they were having a bad day. Its just ok."}
{"text":"Love this place! The BBQ was great! I ordered the chicken wings and their sauce isn't spicy enough! (Yes, I went with Wilbur's Revenge and still could use more heat.) Service was great and we were seated and attended to promptly.

Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I visit Dave's on a regular basis in TX but here in Vegas i got a little surprise. Burnt BUTTZ YES BUTTS
SMOKED pork flash-fried in blackberry BBQ sauce! 
And man was it tasty, so Dave keep this on the regular menu we love it! Susan was the one that recommended it and she was Right. 

 After a good lunch it was banana pudding time, a little on the heavy side on whipping cream but that's just me I like more puttN then cream. But always delicious."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch 5/20/18 about 1:45. Famous Dave's is one of our favorites, both in Vegas and SoCal. Today's meals were definitely the most disappointing. The service  was slow, I'm not sure why, there weren't many people. Our meals were not at all good. I ordered Dave's Sassy BBQ salad opting for brisket for the meat choice. The brisket was thin, dry and cold. Also ordered was a combo with meal with sausage link and brisket, again the brisket was cold and dry. When we brought it to the server's attention she tried to tell this wasn't the case because she meet just came out of the oven. That as it may be, it was substandard. Famous Dave's brisket is our favorite. I was really looking forward to a nice meal.  I guess it wasn't in the cards today."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst chopped brisket I've ever partially eaten. The sandwich was filled with huge blobs of fat. I had to take the pieces out and surgically remove the edible portion. Others in my party were happy with their meals, and the platters seemed to be better than the sandwiches. It appears that when they trim the platter meat. They chop up the fat and rind and hide it in the sandwiches.  The place was packed but the servers did an admirable job of keeping up, and there is a sice selection of sauces to satisfy any taste. I'll probably eat here again if someone else wants to, but I'll select something different."}
{"text":"Definitely disappointed. My first time there and you can clearly tell the brisket had been sitting there all day because it was all mushy and greasy. The Mac and cheese plain, tastes like stouffers. The chicken was good though. So was the corn muffin but that's about it. 20 bucks just **POOF**. Sad."}
{"text":"It's really annoying when your standing at the hostess stand and the hostess has her back to the door and is too busy chit chatting to acknowledge you're even there. It's even better when she finally does turn around and then rolls her eyes at you for interrupting her conversation.

The foods good, the service ehh (depends who you get). Do yourself a favor, sit at the bar. You won't have to deal with the hostess and the bartenders are friendly."}
{"text":"On a not so busy weeknight, service was lousy. Host didn't acknowledge us, had a party of 5 and stood right in front of her. She did however notice the lighter skin couple next to us. Then it took the server 10 minutes to help us. Food was decent."}
{"text":"Wow. Unbelievable. 

We were so pumped up to check this place out. I have heard so many great things about Famous Daves from friends and coworkers in the past. Usually we would go do the BBQ at Ellis Island, but we were in the mood to try something different today. 

We walked in and were seated at a booth pretty quickly. We checked out the menus and decided on a couple of dishes and an appetizer. I was also going to take advantage of those happy hour prices for a nice cold adult beverage or three.

We were just waiting for the server to come and take our drink order to kick things off.

The thing is we waited...

...and waited...

...and waited...

...and waited...

To add insult to injury, people who came in after us were seated and served their drinks. AND on top of that, two different employees looked right at us, turned around, and walked away. At the 34 minute mark we decided to throw in the towel. It wasn't even that busy as there were plenty of empty tables and booths everywhere! I went to tell the hostess, in a very calm manner, on the way out the door  that we had been waiting 34 minutes and no one had even taken our drink order. There was no apology, no explanation....no...anything. I just got the deer in the headlights look. Nice. 

Cross this place off my list. I'll just go back to Rolling Smoke or Ellis Island...or anywhere else for that matter when I'm in the mood for BBQ.

Welcome to the Hall of Shame.

Disgraceful.

1 star."}
{"text":"I LOVE the food at Famous Dave's! But THIS LOCATION specifically was a down grade from the other Famous Dave's I've eaten at. My water glass was dirty, the tables were sticky. Staff was friendly!
The food was decent, I didn't get as many side bits as I tend to get at others (like the pickled onions, carrots, etc.).
I recommend going to any other Famous Dave's and ordering to-go, you'll have a better food experience. Definitely stick to any other Famous Dave's & don't sit down at this one!
Recommended food: Cheesy potato soup (sooo cheesy)! Burnt ends are MY FAVE! Even better than the ribs!"}
{"text":"This place has went down hill since the last time I was here. Walking in they said a wait of 10 mins and I've been waiting over 25 mins to be seated, people who came in after our party got seated right away. The lady's at the front said it's because they only have 2 servers but they have 3 people at the front. I'm very disappointed in this place."}
{"text":"I like eating at famous Dave's the food is always good everytime I come here but not this time. The service sucked and the food was all salty especially the brisket. It was very dry and very salty. They weren't busy at all there were four table occupied including my table. Server seemed more attentive To her other tables."}
{"text":"Lunch is amazing here! prices are very reasonable and you get big portions. I am a family of 8 and the family feast feeds us all. The staff is very friendly. My drinks are always filled and they are patient with the kids here. For a fun afordable family dinner Famous Dave's is definetly the place to go."}
{"text":"hot dang!!!
famous dave's is really good when you want some quick bbq. i've been hear with a couple friends and usually get the hotlink. it's so yummy and delicious!!! Best time to go is during their lunch specials. most things are discounted down a couple bucks. i went for dinner a couple months ago and had the burnt ends, OMG!! so BOMB. they also had some chip they bring out with dinner. they are really good with the hot bbq sauce. they sauces is something i really like, they fit well with different things are should all be tried at least once. 

only reason they aren't getting a 5 star rate is their servers. when i can a couple months ago the gentleman that served us was very nice but not very knowledgeable about the product, he may have been new so he gets a pass. :P the lady that served us last week was nice enough to check on us but didn't really offer anything, no advice or extras."}
{"text":"The service is wonderful, and the employees are friendly. Tonight one of the servers at the Blue Diamond location in Las Vegas took it upon himself to completely disrespect me and my wife. The waiter was of African American origins like me. He was constantly flirting with my wife behind my back. I was unaware of this until my wife; Tammy brought it to my attention. He was standing in the background constantly staring and making flirtatious smiles and gestures at my wife. I understand that people flirt but there is a line and he crossed it. This made her extremely uncomfortable. He went so far as to follow her AND my three year old son to the bathroom and made a very disrespectful comment. \"Hey, cutie! And I wasn't talking about the baby!\" That was totally uncalled for. Our night was ruined. As a husband my first thought was to confront him. Instead I kept my cool and am writing this email in hopes that you will address the situation. When we got home my wife called the manager of the Blue Diamond location to address the situation. The entire time she was talking to the manager, Kevin, he was laughing under his voice and completely refused to take this matter seriously. He even stated that he was not sure how to handle this type of situation. Kevin told my wife that the waiter's name is \"Essex.\" Given Kevin's demeanor at the time of the conversation we are unsure whether or not that is his real name. My wife even told me that he was the same waiter that kept walking past our table last year staring at her and our 11 year old daughter. 
 As it stands my family and I will never dine at that location again and will suggest to others not do so as well. Essex is clearly there to pick up on women whenever he can and is not there to work. Your manager, Kevin showed is ineptitude when dealing with this situation. Please make no mistake. I am not out to gain anything from this but we are considering seeking legal actions on the grounds of sexual harassment and stalking so no other family should have to endure the same vulgar and disrespectful treatment. We are also going to contact our local news stations and hope they will not make light of this situation and warn the people about that location. I love my family and do not want to see other families put in comprising situations like this. Famous Dave's used to be a place for families to relax and enjoy themselves. Now it is becoming a haven for potential sexual predators. Our waiter, Ryan was great. He should be commended for his excellent service. It is people like \"Essex\" who make the hard workers look bad. 
 I hope you will take what I writing seriously and address this situation but as of right now, we will never set foot in another Famous Dave's BBQ again. Please do not let this happen to another family."}
{"text":"I went to Famous Dave's with my husband, parents and in-laws...all with different tastes. When we left, everyone was full and happy.

Most of us ordered ribs, and they were a hit. the ribs came with 2 sides AND a piece of corn and a corn bread (lots of food for sure). I had the combo of ribs and chopped pork that was sooo tasty. The ribs are not super over sauced. However they have about 5 different sauces at each table from mild to \"diablo\" for everyones taste. So if you want to add more sauce...go crazy. My MIL had the turkey burger and also enjoyed it...so its more than just BBQ.  

Everything everyone had here was good...from the sweet tea to the ribs, DEEELISH"}
{"text":"Their Dave's Favorite Burger and the Smoked cheddar burger were scrumptious. The onion strings were nice, crisp, and salty goodness. The bbq chips were crunchy and fresh. Their signature sauces go well with the burgers, chips and fries. The ambiance was cool and the service was superb."}
{"text":"Yummy! Always a winner. Now they have daily specials, happy hour and reverse happy hour.

This is a pork rib spot no beef. Tenderlicous."}
{"text":"This is a great BBQ place. They certainly are not stingy with the portions either. The staff was excellent. Our servers name was \"Red\" and she was absolutely fantastic. The prices are very reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Craving some good barbecue cooking and didn't want to cook so we decided to drive over for Sunday dinner.  Shared the 2 person meal with ribs, chicken, corn, beans, fries, rice and cornbread.  Everything was tasty.  Service was great and fast."}
{"text":"This place is always hit or miss, sometimes the food is good and other times it seems old. Was very annoyed when my husband got double charged with 2 different amounts, and when I tried to contact them the phones weren't working and I couldn't get ahold of anyone. Hopefully that was just a one time thing because that was super inconvenient and the manager seemed to not really care about the situation."}
{"text":"I received such great service - the wait staff kept checking up on me and offering refills. The food was delicious and I enjoyed trying all the different variety of BBQ sauces they have at each table."}
{"text":"Service and atmosphere was great food was okay just didnt taste authentic hot links wasn't really hot more like a breakfast sausage on the scale from 1-10 it was like a 4 or 5, the macaroni and cheese tasted more like a boxed macaroni  and cheese the cornbread was fabulous the spare ribs were fabulous they were falling off the  bone the green beans with bacon was pretty good I was anticipating them having a more bacon taste but overall they were really good"}
{"text":"Food good but they are slow 35 min for a to go order is to long. They say they slow cook the ribs!  I saw people come in after me, order and 1/2 way done eating!  Other people called in orders, now I know!"}
{"text":"Deeeliscious beans!  Best side dish in the house.  They were the star of my 4 bone Rib platter. While the ribs were moist, meaty and spicy, they carried a slight saltiness that overwhelmed the flavor.  Those beans tho'......"}
{"text":"best BBQ in town!, service is always great no matter what time of day, and remember to sign up for their email club and receive coupons and sometimes free appetizers."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying;  most attentive staff. They are unfortunately hen pecked by the immediate management or corporate.  I had a friend meet me hear and maybe he used offensive words but he has been through some $\"@& recently.  The staff and management was not very receptive to this and I'm not sure why that is. Maybe they have not been trained very well as I read your syllabus and what you family structure is. Very Disappointed!"}
{"text":"I love famous Dave's for the ribs, brisket, and Beans! 
I just wish sometimes a waiter or waitress would listen to a very small request of Hot Fries... They make such a difference when they are Pipping Hot! 
Also, I love the service.. It's just so small to go wrong with such a small request leaves a big break in my heart.. I know Dave understands cause he's a foodie like me! Uuuueeeee!!!"}
{"text":"Had to get someone to seat us, had to get someone to serve us; should've heeded the warning and left. 
Sustained on the fries and pineapple, threw out the rainbow brisket (wth??) and chopped pork.  Now I guess I have to go find my check so I can leave, doesn't look like anyone's coming this way again..."}
{"text":"I have been going to Famous Dave's for a few years, mainly for convenience. They are consistently inconsistent. One visit will be spot on and the next will just be awful. My latest visit makes me not want to go back at all. We ordered the Feast for Two for $36.99 and the happy hour brisket nachos for $4.99. Both selections were not good. The brisket was dry and had almost had the texture of thick cut jerky. The macaroni and cheese was flavorless and watery. What really got me was the fries; over cooked, possibly fried twice and cold. If you F-up fries, you basically suck.

Two stars because the service was nice."}
{"text":"Just thinking about this place makes my mouth water. Excellent ribs, nice-sized portions. Really good service the night I was there. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"The food is the greatest!!!!  Enjoyed the fourth of July without the SWEAT!!!"}
{"text":"The food was okay but the experience / waiter was horrible it was my first time ever going to Famous Dave's so I would ask the waiter questions about the menu and he was just rude and not helpful at all there's about five or six different sauces that were on my table that I wanted to sample being that I told my waiter that it was my first time you would think he would bring me something to sample them with or at least help me out by describing the differences in the sauces it took a customer to tell me that the waiter was supposed to bring me chips to try the sauces a customer helped me more than my waiter I definitely will not return"}
{"text":"Beef it up Wednesday Brisket platter $9.99  came in last minute and the service was great but the food was cold. Has to send it back and reheat it but it was still tasty."}
{"text":"We went to the Famous Dave's on Saturday and it was horrible!!! 
We thought that the food would be good based on the high reviews. But they have really changed, I guess.

The Ribs:
All full of fat and there was no meat on the ribs. For the money we paid, the food was crap.

The fries:
Mine weren't done,they were undercooked. They dont give you enough!!!! The fries are also tasteless and not worth the price

Catfish:
We ordered the appetizer and the catfish are very tiny and not worth the price. If you do order them, you will be very unsatisfied. They taste okay, but are not worth the prices they charge!!!

Chicken: 
The chicken wasn't done and the was loose and not cooked completely!!!!! Total disaster.

Brisket:
The brisket didnt taste real, I think it was a processed meat!!!!!

This place has crappy BBQ!!! I will never eat there again!!!!
The Carl's Jr across the parking lot has better food than they do!!!!!

Dont eat there unless you like crappy food and uncooked meats!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is what I was looking for when I looking for Country BBQ cooking! The decor is of an outdoor country picnic with string lights on the ceilings and red and white checkered tablecloths. The ribs well excellent! The sauce is so good and the full slab was enough to feed 4. As for the sides, a little underwhelming. I was disappointed in how soupy the mac and cheese was and it lacked flavor as well like it had been watered down. The catfish I had as an appetizer though was so good! Spicy but not too much heat and the seasoning tasted Cajun and really makes you feel like you are somewhere in the south."}
{"text":"This time it was just my hubby, my daughter and me. The waiter was hilarious and the food was great. What more can I say?"}
{"text":"Mmmmmm

Famous Daves rules

Some of the best BBQ ever I think

Huge portions and I love this location

Get in here !

If your into guitar .... Please find my albums under Rob Johnson , on iTunes and GooglePlay

Cheers"}
{"text":"I've said it before - chains exist so that people know what to expect as far as consistency goes. 

That being said - I've been to the Famous Dave's in Long Beach and I actually enjoyed my meal - both the service and the food. I wish I could say the same about my experience at the North Las Vegas location. 

Service - our server was around when she needed to be. At least in her opinion that is. She took our order. Brought out drinks, our order, the bill and my change. Otherwise, looking for her was like playing the game - \"Where's Waldo?\" At least she was friendly. I'll give her that much. 

As for the food - my family ordered the Feast and it came out so fast that it explained why the food wasn't very good. Warm it up and serve it up must be their motto. The meat selections were all dry. Of the ribs, the brisket, the chicken, fries and corn, I like the fries the best. That's saying a lot considering I'm a carnivore and I love my dead, cooked animal meat. 

Comparing notes of my two experiences at Famous Dave's - I have to suggest that lunch is better than dinner. It stands to reason that lunch will be fresher while dinner will be the meats prepared earlier in the day to be able to serve the evening crowd faster. Either that or the North Las Vegas location is just that bad. One day I may get around to testing this feeling ..."}
{"text":"My family and I eat here every now and then, but have enjoyed consistently good food and service.  The restaurant is clean and staff is attentive and efficient.  Portions are nice and taste great.  If you go for lunch, as for the frequent diner card and get a \"punch\" towards a free meal.

There's something for everyone at Famous Dave's.  Will definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"BEST CORN MUFFINS!

This is a late review but after my blahh experience with POT LIQOUR I really had to get my fix fixed.

So the next day I headed right over to Famous Dave's to make sure I wasn't trippin on how food should taste like.

I ordered a DOZEN CORN MUFFINS - no need any sauce on it but some butter always makes any bread taste even better than it does.

APPETIZER BURNT ENDS - little chopped pieces smothered in bbq sauce and it comes with some fried onions and some spiced pickles which are AWSOME! 

I would have to say I was not tripping about the other place because the burnt ends here were much more edible than the other place. Although it was a little more on the dry side this time but not to the point of jerky - Ness. The cashier that took my order was quick and prompt and went over what was in each box for me. Food was ready and togo within 10 min!"}
{"text":"The wait staff was great, especially when I spilled my drink. The food was good but nothing to brag about. We started with the smoked cheddar and burnt tips which was simply fatty burnt tips and cheese sauce. Tasty though. Then we had the feast for one and a half rack of pork ribs. The best thing on the table was either the cornbread muffin or the spivey mac and cheese. I was also a big fan of the devil's spit sauce. For dessert we had the banana pudding which was only ok. All in all, nothing fancy but a good night out with friends. Also, the restaurant let us stick around and chat for about an hour and a half after dinner which was nice."}
{"text":"I came here to order to go. I ordered two brisket platters which was horrible. I got mainly gristle which was a big disappointment.  Not planning of coming here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Dave, you're the man.  Ribs, chicken, rib tips, brisket, whatever it is... it is delicious.  I'm sure he could smoke a piece of cardboard and it would taste good.  I have never been disappointed with anything I ate here. 

So many choices.  I usually go with a few people and we end up ordering the feast.  We always leave stuffed and enough leftovers for the next days lunch!!  I would call that a good value.

They had a new sauce last time I went, Ghost Chili BBQ sauce.  Very spicy, but oh so delicious!!  This sauce alone warrants a visit. 

The food is consistent, always done well.  Our waiter Dave was on point.  Did a great job refilling drinks and making sure we were doing well.  

In my opinion, whatever you order, you won't be disappointed.  I won't get crazy and say this is the best BBQ I ever had, but always left stuffed, happy, and satisfied."}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ and service at this joint. Their was no wait to get seated for lunch and I was sold just on the variations of BBQ sauce that they had here. I loved the Georgia mustard and the spicy BBQ sauce personally. On Wednesday they have 3 dollars off the brisket plate which I had with Mac and cheese and the baked beans. Both the sides was great and the cornbread that you get with the plate was perfect balance of sweetness. The brisket was charred nicely and the crust was so flavorful and with the meat being juicy and tender. Little on the high side for a regular lunch but it's great as treat to fill up on BBQ from time to time. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Needed to pick a dinner spot for the evening. It was close to the house and the food isn't that bad. The overall experience was OK nothing to brag about. The waitress wasn't very attentive. I think all she did was take our order. Someone else Brought out our food and refilled our drinks. I would recommend the BBQ nachos, very good and the corn bread was good and warm."}
{"text":"I had that bbq brisket meal and it was good in Good I had the corn bread and Cole slaw both was good I will be back for sure I had my  order to go they told me 15 min and my food would be ready and they were on time."}
{"text":"For starters am a huge fan of Famous Dave's and have been going there for BBQ for 17+ years (although used to be Minnesota locations mostly) and again, I am a huge fan!  Have tried numerous items over the years and have never been disappointed.  My go to is the Beef Brisket sandwich and steak fries.  Was a little over cooked here, but I like it that way, so I enjoyed. My gf who is a first time diner here and got the same was not as impressed though tbh....

Service was friendly and good.  Placed order over the phone and it was picked up in about 15 minutes.  Nice and pleasant.  Good customer service.  

Would definitely recommend anyone near the SILVERTON area...."}
{"text":"Overall great experience!  Very friendly server.  Service was quick.  I had the brisket.  The bbq sauce selection are some of the best I have ever had!  The brisket was very moist and tender.  Flavor of the brisket was pretty bland but the sauce made up for it."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved famous daves BBQ. I drive past it daily but I've never stopped. I didn't barbecue for the fourth so I decided to try a restaurant. I ordered the ribs with mashed potatoes and baked beans. For dessert, I ordered banana pudding. The banana pudding was absolutely DELICIOUS! The ribs had a nice amount of meat, tender and flavorful. I will be trying a different side instead of mashed potatoes next time but the baked beans were great! I will be back.
Oh & I almost forgot about the cornbread muffin. Awesome too!"}
{"text":"My appointment got cancelled next doors so I went to Famous Dave's to get takeout in an effort to please my rumbling belly. They have a good combo to choose from - a ribs + one meat + 2 sides for 15.99, or two meats + 2 sides for 14.99. I got the ribs combo and here's what I learned:

1) Mix the regular sauce (a bit sweet) with the Devil's spit sauce (a bit liquidy) to get the perfect bbq sauce
2) Get the beans. beans. beans
3) You might as well make your own mashed potatoes
4) Save some room for the delicious corn muffin

I'll probably still drive to Lucille's for BBQ (LOVE their sauces) unless I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"I went there with a friend for dinner since we meant to give a try for months and I was not disappointed. I have to say that this is a pretty good place.

This place is located on Blue Diamond Road not too far from highway 15 so it is pretty convenient to get there, and the restaurant does offer quite a lot of parking spaces so it shouldn't be hard to park. The restaurant itself is somewhat large, and doesn't get too busy so no problem to get a table.

We decided to take the ultimate burger and the pulled chicken burger along with a cup of chili, fries and rice, and a brownie. The ultimate burger was very good, while the pulled chicken burger was a little less so. Service was pretty fast and we ended up paying $23 for all this food. Definitely give it a try if you like BBQ!

In conclusion, I would say that this place offers a good quality/price ratio and I would recommend it. Feel free to message me for any additional details that you may need!"}
{"text":"Dave's is what would happen if you were to take a rustic rib shack from the dirty dirty, run it through a Corporate even somewhat Disney like scrub and move it to a blistering desert.  In another words, if you want an authentic, rustic rib shack and you hate the idea of a chain like place, this is not your place.

Fortunately for me, I don't mind the garish touristy-ness of the place.  I just want reasonably priced food and if I'm lucky, beer.

Although their happy hour is advertised as 2-6p, I noted that our 11:30am lunch on a Saturday also qualified.  So if you are hell bent on happy hour, which for $2.99 23 oz beers, that's pretty good, then check ahead.

As noted, by other reviewers, $8.99 two item combos with corn muffin and one side for lunch is a fantastic deal.  However, the overall food is quite average.  Not a bad thing or anything.  I was happy with it, but it wasn't as good as Baby Blue in LA.  The \"Devil's Spit\" sauce was pretty good, but it was not spicy at all.  I couldn't tell the sweet BBQ sauce wings from the spicy.  And seriously, not even cholulu spicy, let alone tapatio.  The sweet sauce was not so good.  I think you can just skip the wings.  The Devil's spit is okay from the bottle for your other meats aside from the lack of spiciness.
 
This place is clean.  You could eat off the floor.  Good job.  The air conditioning is blasting, so you may get a bit cold if you are chugging cold beers and are sensitive to cold.

Service is standard, though a bit spotty when it gets busy.  Instead of having three hostesses, Dave's should add one or two servers during lunch rush.

Overall, 3 platters, 12 wings, 5 beers, 1 side salad plus tax and tip for $62?  Not bad, not bad.  Mind blowing authentic BBQ joint... not so much.  But as long as you aren't a BBQ snob, you'll be fine.  Enjoy."}

{"text":"My first one star review and I stand by it.

Don't get me wrong i LOVE BBQ it probably one of my favorite foods but just not from Famous Daves.

This review actually covers the 2 regrettable times I came in.

I stopped by tocheck out FD with a couple of friends not too long ago. Walking in I thought the place looked horrendous, like a couple hill-billies had designed the place. But I know interior decor really is subjective so I don't really put too much thought on it but in my opinion this place is ugly.

We ordered what I thought would be safe bets, beef brisket, ribs, pulled pork. The usual fare at bbq restaurants. What we got when food arrived could be be described as an insult to the BBQ gods. The brisket was dry, almost complete devoid of flavor other than a smoky/charcoal taste to it. The ribs should have been fall of the bone tender but instead had to be ripped from the bone. the pulled pork was good once completely drenched in their BBQ sauce. The BBQ sauce itself was another problem, I don't know what they use as their base (it doesn't taste like tomato) but its like water. I felt like I was squirting watered down store-brand BBQ sauce on my food. Not even the cornbread was good enough to garner another star here.

The service was completely lacking again. I hate having to waive down servers to get refills, condiments, or the check. They should be making routine stops to your table make sure everything is as it should be.

But I am not done yet...

I came in about 2 months later to pick up a large take out order from work. (thankfully i was not paying for it) The food order was ready when I got there and the server (or whatever you call the to-go order people) was nice enough to throw in some extra corn bread and condiments. I guess it was to make up for the disaster that I was soon to uncover.

 I brought the food back to work, popped open the boxes and there was a collective \"WTF\" like response when everyone saw what was inside. The meat was burned. I am not saying over cooked, but i was burned. About 40% of each piece of meat was just pure tar and black ash. It couldn't even been eaten. I don't understand why a cook would do this! Its just plain mean! Our manager called FD back and totally bitched them out. I think she got her money back or a discount but seriously... I could probably get better BBQ at Albertsons. Def not coming back here."}
{"text":"Years ago, there was a place called Trader Vic's in Beverly Hills.  For all it's kitsch, those who tried their in-house smoked \"spare ribs\" knew what good ribs were.  They were lean, tasty, and typically never served in plentiful enough quantities.

I visited my brother and mother in Nevada over this past Thanksgiving. Typically when I see my brother, it gives us an opportunity to eat meals we don't normally eat.  This time he said \"I've gotta take you to Famous Daves!\"  Usually my brother's judgement is questionable, but not on this day.  He was 100% right, and for the rest of the night, I was thinking about how delicious those ribs were.  I will be back.  I may even go to the nearest one to me, which is nearly 45+ minutes away.

These ribs were incredibly lean, moist and flavorful.  The finest ribs I have ever eaten.  Seriously."}
{"text":"I took my friend and my wife here for the first time on Friday night. We went at 7pm the heart of dinner time. We sat in the the bar area at a table. There was just the bar tender there. She was waiting tables and taking car of the bar. She was very cheerful. She had a smile on her on her face when she came to our table. She took our drink orders and made them and brought them to use rite away. She had 4 other tables,Plus 5 people at the bar. She took our appetizer order. We got the sweet catfish. It was brought out to use promptly. Then we placed our order. We all order the 2 choice meat combo with 2 sides and cornbread muffin. The manager at one point stepped in to help her in the bar area. The manager brought all of us more water to drink. And asked if we needed anything else.  BOTTOM LINE: Great Service,Great Food,Great  ambience. Hands down to the bar tender. She was great!!"}
{"text":"One of our bottom 5 dining experiences EVER! We haven't visited this place for a few yrs and today we we're reminded of why we stayed away from the is place. NOT only was the service a horrible mess but the food (especially the brisket) has gone down the drain ! We at one time enjoyed this BBQ joint but their standards of service and quality of food have sunken to new depths that we won't be returning to famous daves! Only thing they're serving up is a HOT MESS. Despite all of this the manager was aware of this and didn't even visit the table"}
{"text":"I went here for dinner tonight with nine of my friends and we sat in the bar area.  Our server was friendly and did a good job with all of our orders. I simply ordered the boneless wings appetizer for dinner.

All of my friends food came out together and my wings came out about 8 minutes after everyone else's food. Due to me not being overly  hungry it was n big deal. There were about 15 or so little pieces of chicken in the basket and a small side of ranch.  I ate about 5 pieces with the ranch.  

About 30 minutes later I started to sweat a little and did not feel so good. I then excused myself and went my my officer where I spent the next 3 hours in the toilet with diarrhea and the drive heaves. The only reason I didn't go home was because I couldn't be away from a bathroom for more than 15 minutes.   

I finally got up the courage to drive home where I spent the next 4 hours sitting on the toilet and throwing up in a bucket at the same time. In fact it is 2 am and I am writing this from the bathroom floor. 

I had a bad experience and I texted the rest of the guys I was with and they are all fine..... And laughing at me because that's what men do to each other.  

I personally am done going here but make up your own mind 90% my party loved it and will go back...  I just drew the horribly horrible unlucky straw...

And just for the record, there was  absolutely zero alcohol involved"}
{"text":"I used to LOVE Dave's, but recently this one has gone REALLY down hill. The food is usually consistant, but the service is always hit or miss. I've been sat in the bar a few times, and hate it in there. I usually always get good service in the resturaunt so I have asked to be sat in there when the hostess starts heading to the bar. Last week the hostess didn't listen and insisted on seating my husband and I in the bar. The resturaunt side always has us in and out within 35 minutes. The bar takes forever, no matter who is bartending. This time in the bar it took us 1:15 to eat and get out of there. We ordered chicken and pork off their new meal deals. The food is already smoked/cooked, so why on earth it took almost 30 mins to get food is beyond me. After finishing our food and putting our napkins on our plates, it took another 10 mins for the bartender to ask us about dessert, 10 more mins to get dessert, and after those were finishes, 10 mins to get out check. After another 10 minutes, I ended up walking my check up to the bartender to run our card. The bartender wasn't even that friendly on top of it. It was like the people eating bothered her. She had about 4 customers at the bar and there were 2 other tables eating. Not even that busy. I also assume the bartender was some sort of manager the way she barked orders to the other staff. Take a word of advice and eat in the resturaunt unless you plan of spending the day there and getting crappy service... Go 15 mins west to the Flamingo location or go 15 mins East to Lucielle's."}
{"text":"Perfect!   The server was sweet and got drinks out quickly.   The food came out quick hot and perfect.  I wouldn't hesitate to come back. :)"}
{"text":"I relocated to Las Vegas, NV about 20 days ago and I looked hard for a BBQ place to patronize. I am a true southern lady and I was recently converted from the Beef Briskets of Georgia to the flavor of the open pit in Alamogordo, New Mexico. Now that I am here in Las Vegas, NV, I have found Famous Dave's which offers some similarities to both states. I sampled the lunch special with the choice of two meats, Texas Brisket and Georgia Pork. The flavor was hidden by the BBQ sauce (too tangy) but the meat was tender. I really enjoyed the steamed broccoli and the flavor was excellent. I must talk about the Corn Muffin, I do not like corn bread but this was the whole meal, it tasted like dessert. 

I could eat the Corn Muffin alone with steamed broccoli on the side. The portions were a bit slack for the money and military discounts are only offered on Mondays. The \"to go\" customer service was excellent with one suggestions that the cashier count back the change to the customer to avoid any oversights/short changing."}
{"text":"I'm from North Carolina so this isn't the type of BBQ I'm used to. That being said, I really enjoy this place and their bread pudding is BOMB. Special thanks to Estela at the bar - she has a great attitude and was extremely helpful. I only gave it 4 stars because a couple times I've been here, the service has been slow (never at the bar though). I'd imagine that like most establishments, it's because they're understaffed, but it's worth noting because the food isn't super cheap."}
{"text":"Really great service from Mike. Don't know what the negative reviewers experienced but our service could not have been better. Ribs are huge, meaty and lean. Cedar plank salmon was so good the plate was licked clean. Side salad is delicious with the balsamic vinaigrette dressing. Fries are ok but the steamed broccoli is done to perfection. A great option in an area generally starved of anything other than fast food."}
{"text":"Came here for my husbands graduation. There were 9 of us and we were seated quickly once our whole party was there. We ordered 2 All American BBQ feasts. Each came with a full rack of ribs, a whole roasted chicken, Cole slaw, baked beans, potato wedges, 4 corn muffins, 4 corn on the cob and a choice of brisket, pulled pork, or hot links. 

I'm not much of a meat eater but the guys in our group seemed to enjoy it, I know my husband did. I personally liked the ribs and corn bread, everything else was okay. 

We had Chris as our waiter, he was very nice. Only, we sat there for a good two hours and he didn't fill our water cups once. 

I paid $140+ for our meal and had some leftovers as well to take home. Not a bad price but I can think of other places to bring a big group (hubby just really wanted BBQ). Their happy hour is pretty good, I would come back for that."}
{"text":"Great food service was awesome. Got my meal with the quickness. Every time I travel to Nellis this is a must stop."}
{"text":"Nice and quiet!  Good brisket, cornbread and coleslaw.  The fried pickle slices and onion strings were very tasty and our server was informative and speedy.  Not a big bbq fan myself, but my son and daughter were happy with their bbq choices.  Tonight it was quiet enough for pleasant conversation."}
{"text":"A friend took me to a Famous Dave's restaurant at a different location and the food was delicious. The services was remarkable. I noticed there was a Famous Dave's next to the Sam's Club on E Craig so after shopping at Walmart one Sunday I decided to call in an order. I was placed on hold for 10 minutes before they took my order and was about 5 minutes from the restaurant. I placed my order and when I picked the food up the wings were naked and I had asked for them to be sauced. The wings were very dark compared to what I had before. The guy took the wings to the back to get me some more but all he did was have kitchen toss them in some sauce.  I tasted a wing during the route home and it was dry, so I tasted two more after arriving home and all of the wings were dry. I called the store back and spoke to the manager Ellie who asked for my receipt number and I explained they never gave me one. She insisted that they would have placed it in the bag and since I could not provide her a receipt she could only exchange the uneaten portions. I took the food back and pulled everything out of the bag to show her I had no receipt, she even looked in the bag. She took the wings away to make some more and asked was anything else wrong. I informed her that the baked potato was supposed to be butter and sour cream only but they had given me cheese and bacon and asked if I could have butter and sour cream and she said yes and put the container in the bag. Ellie then asked if she could give me a dessert for the mix up, I said thank you but that would not be necessary and asked if I could have a fresh potato and she said of course and tried to get me to keep the original potato that was not cold. I told her that I did not need it and she insisted I could warm it up for later and I said no thank you. I get the food home and it was poor quality. I am so disappointed that I will never eat at a Famous Dave's again and this is unfortunate because I was going to arrange for catering at work."}
{"text":"What's going on at this place? I've dined here several times, but my most recent dinner here will likely be my last.

Instead of ordering any of their BBQ classics, I went for a soup and a salad, which sounded great at the time. I originally wanted the soup and salad combo, but I would've been charged an additional $8 if I wanted to add chicken. Note: The cost of the combo is under 8 bucks. Our server recommended I order the salad and soup separately to save some cash. Ok, fine.

Bacon Baked Potato Soup: Did someone use my bowl of soup as an ashtray before it was served to me? This reeked of smoke! I was unable to find anything in my soup that was causing the stench, nor did my soup taste burnt. 

Chicken Caesar Salad: This salad 90% lettuce, four slices of grilled chicken breast, and a handful of croutons. The salad dressing was SALTY. 

The best part of dinner: The cornbread muffin.

Not coming back."}
{"text":"I don't know what's happened to the franchise lately but it's been a swift decline of quality over the past few months.  They've replaced their Mac and Cheese with Kraft Mac and have ditched the Wilbur Fries for soggy seasoned steak fries.  Worst of all I ordered a nachos to go the other day and there were parts of a plastic bag in it! Yup went to take a bite and pulled a plastic bag out of my mouth. Looks like it was from a bag they get their chili or pulled chicken in. Chef cuts the bag open to heat and doesn't bother to get the cut piece out of the pot!!! If this is how this establishment cares about food service or quality I hope they get shut down."}
{"text":"Great service great food emp... All have great clean customer service well lit and clean bathrooms and explained menu good to us and answered out questions and food didn't take too long either it was a great family home cooking feeling and will come back made us feel like family! Steve and Paula chowing down"}
{"text":"Sam, Ron and I had a good meal at Famous Dave's tonight.  I had the cod, Sam had rib ends and Ron had a half rack of ribs.

Our sides were great; mac and cheese, Wilbur beans and firecracker green beans.   The fried pickles were awesome.   My cod wasn't over breaded and the tartar sauce was pickle chunky.  Rib tips had a Southside sauce and the half rack was tender and fell off the bone.

Highlight was the banana pudding complete with nilly wafers."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout last night and the to go girl Ashley said the wait time was 20 mins. I ended up sitting there waiting almost an hour. Drove all the way home just to find out the wrong meats were put on my order. They did offer to give me the right meat if I drove back. But after a long day who wants to drive back and forth due to their mistake. Annoyed.com"}
{"text":"I am a regular. I've taken 100's of customers to lunch since the opening. I've never had a bad experience. Today was awful. I ordered the large Nachos for myself and 2 clients, the serving was 1/2 of what it used to be. I ordered the 3 Pork Taco's. I sent it back, there was very, very little Pork. Our waitress was seen by one of my clients attempting to explain the situation to \" BRIAN \" the manager. After a few minutes he delivered the Taco's along with this, \" I added more Pork to your Taco's this time, we put 1 oz. of Pork on the Taco's. Next time we'll have to charge you for the extra meat. I said if you only put 1oz. of meat ( total for all 3 ), state that on the menu and people wouldn't pay 10.00 for 1 oz. of Pork. Brian was rude I told him my advise was free. Treat customers the way you would want to be treated, I told him you won't see me or my clients at your store again. Not only this location but \" ALL \" Unfamous Dave's. I was later told the restaurant had been sold to a company in Texas. WOW, company in Texas, you'd think portions would get larger LOL.  The host was great the waitress was also wonderful. I let her know it wasn't on her, it's the company and the face of the store \" Brian\". Having said all of this, I'm sure they'll shut down because of my bad experience.
LOL."}
{"text":"My second visit back was on point. I ordered the same thing and they were delicious. Sweet tea was so good and plenty of food for $10. The order came out just as I had asked and did not disappoint. I will be going back very soon."}
{"text":"They've got a great 2 for 1999 special food is good good BBQ and the special easily will fill you up and to pay for that price you wil most definitely come back for more"}
{"text":"I don't usually bother reviewing chains but I just love FDs so much I just have to. This one is the location closest to wear I live and every time I can kW here I am a happy camper. Whether I get a salad, the chili or a combo plate of various types of ribs I leave with a full happy belly. Yum yum. :)

Update: just lowered to 4 stars after ordering a bad cup of coffee and discovering my cup was a dirty one inside. Ewww. Well no one is perfect but that's just gross. Still, weighing in all of my other meals here where this has never happened, I'm still giving 4 stars."}
{"text":"Have never had a problem with this location till today.  We got our food and right away first bite we knew it was off.  Not the same!  Well now both of us are up sick it's 1am!  Never going again!"}
{"text":"FINGER LICKING GOOD!!! 

I love Famous Daves there food is sooo delicious! 

I usually order the 2 meat combo and get the Beef Brisket and the Chopped Pork and it comes with a corn bread muffin and corn on the cob and your choice of two sides i always order my meal with there Wilbur Beans and there Firecracker Green Beans for the side choices. 

Omg let me tell ya their Beef Brisket is so delicious the way they cook it makes it so juicy and tender my favorite dish here by far. I also like the Chopped pork but unfortunately that's hit or miss if its over cooked forget about it , it'll be to hard to even eat but when its fresh and they cooked it just right its very delicious and the sauce they use is mmmm good. The sides wow amazing i love the corn bread muffin that's usually demolished with the 1st 2 mins of me getting my plate and the beans are yummy. 

I always order their sweet tea to wash done my delicious meal. Now by the time I'm finished my stomach is sooo stuffed and i always over eat because there portions are very generous Ive tried taking food home but cant because the food is so delicious and mouth watering i cant stop eating lol.

So even after being stuff i MUST order there Dave's Famous Bread Pudding.....OMG soooooooooo gooooooood its like an orgasm in my mouth when i eat this! The pecan praline sauce they use is mmm mmm good and its also served with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. 

Food is great, service is good, and the price is right, if you haven't tried Famous Daves you must eat here!"}
{"text":"Whenever I get the chance to visit Vegas, this is top on my list for \"must eat here again\" and it has never failed me yet.  We usually order the 2-3 person variety meal, and every item in it is delicious, with enough left over to snack on later at home.   Corn on the cob, fluffy cornbread, chicken, ribs, brisket, fries.... oh, there's no end to the deliciousness.   There are a variety of sauces on your table, from sweet to sassy, take the time to sample them all to find your favs.  

And one of these days, i'll manage not to eat so much that I can't try a desert afterwards, because they look great as well  :-)"}
{"text":"Brought my family here for lunch because I remember how much I enjoyed it when last visiting NV, and we were famished while travelling from Canada to California - it was as big a hit with them as I had hoped.  The four adults shared the Feast for Two and two of the special appetizers (rib tips and nachos) and were too stuffed to finish.  

I could live on their corn muffins alone, I think.  They are just incredibly good -even one of the picky children fell in love with them.  Of course their meats are delicious - great chicken, ribs, and brisket, each one special and ready to be doused with any of the six hot sauces - I liked mixing the Sweet and Zesty with the Texas Fire.  And don't miss their Mac n Cheese - rich and satisfying.

For dessert we passed around a huge slice of Key Lime Pie (could have been tarter) and a Bread Pudding (great glaze on it, accompanied by Vanilla Bean ice cream).

Love, love, love this place - too bad it'll be another several years before I get a chance to return, but it'll definitely always be on my itinerary!!"}
{"text":"My first time here.  Food was pretty good.  I got the lemon pepper chicken without sauce and it was very tasty and cooked perfectly. You get 2 sides with your meal and I got the Mac n cheese and broccoli.  The Mac had jalapeños in it which made it spicy so I traded it for the plain kind.  We got the burnt ends as an appetizer and they were so so good.  I will get them next time as my main meal.  The cornbread was nice and sweet but a bit crumbly.  The prices were fairly reasonable as well.  Will go again that's for sure."}
{"text":"I ordered to go the beef brisket and st louis ribs combo with a side of 3 cornbread and baked potato soup for me and the wife.  When i got there 15 mins later, the order wasnt ready yet.  Waited an additional 15 minutes before it wasx ready.  It wasnt that busy either.  I should have checked before i left.  Well they forgot the cornbread, and the beef brisket tasted like a chew toy.  The soup was OK but nothing home to write about.  Now i know why its been almost a year since we last went here.  When i called to talk to manager, he only offered to originally provide the 3 cornbread on my next visit.  I told him im not ordering here ever again, so he then offered to refund half my order.  Never will we go here again.  Tip- check your to go order before you leave."}
{"text":"Good staff. Just the BBQ was nothing special. The BBQ sauces are interesting they have at least 6 different kinds.  The sides were nothing special either but had a very good side salad. I ate ribs ,Catfish, and pork. Would come again for lunch becuase they have some good lunch deals but not for dinner. The quality and cost don't equate for dinner"}
{"text":"I have a biased opinion of BBQ.  I prefer Texas still beef.  That being said, I gave this place a shot.  I Tried the sausage.  It was good, but not remarkable.  The sides were ok, however nothing to write home about.  If you need something reasonably priced and ok, this place hits that point."}
{"text":"I have been to a Famous Dave's on the east coast a couple of times in the past and not been impressed. But a friend talked me into going to this one and I was very impressed. I have to say the ribs were superb considering it is a chain. Much above expectations and the service was also great. I will certainly pay them a visit next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I love famous Dave's, and I normally go to the W Flamingo Rd one. But I go to this one because it down the street from where I live. But this location has the worst food and the worst service. 

Brisket and Cedar Plank Salmon were dry and cold. Brisket had no flavor and tasted old. Seems like we got the left overs from the day before. Sad to say I will not be back at this place.

The server Brittney, horrible, with lots of attitude. She is just really bad at her job. No personality whatsoever. She is slow and was just a total bitch. At the end she was nowhere to be found. We've been waiting to just pay the bill and get the heck out but she's too busy chit chatting with the cooks and other servers, and after about 15 minutes she finally showed up, she had the nerve to say \"sorry, i was on break\". Said it in a rude way too, like we were interrupting her break!  

The  \"manager\" Debra is in the wrong field, she is nasty and should not be in the position."}
{"text":"Came here for my first time. Visiting from L.A. . The food was good. Came out a little cold. The corn on the cob was cold. Biggest problem was the service. The waitress was nice ,but not around  . I had to get up myself and walk in the kitchen to refill myself. . I will not be back to a famous Dave's for years if ever. . Waitress Jackie was nice ,but still takes a L on this trip. Looks like Lucille will still be first choice."}
{"text":"They have six different barbecues to choose from. Ordered the string onions for the appetizer and tried all the barbecues with it. My top two were the Rich and Sassy, and Texas Pit. Only thing I disliked was the bread wasn't toasted besides that everything tasted good. The beans were delicious."}
{"text":"Great service and great brisket! They look like they have a good size bar area with some smaller TVs. Food was great pretty empty on a Thursday day time run . Would recommend"}
{"text":"I'm not a big BBQ fan in general (don't like sweet and savory) but the family needed to eat someplace casual and cheap.

The food was fine, and the service was excellent.  My chicken with Devil's Spit was about medium hot and fine.  The parents got ribs and they liked it.  The french fries were good, the corn overcooked, and my mac-n-cheese was fine, although I think it was Kraft's (they do advertise it on the kid's menu) with a bunch of spices.

I would give it 4 stars, but like I said, I'm not a BBQ fan."}
{"text":"Would leave no stars if I could. Slow service, stuck lemon in the sweet tea and never asked ! Placed order for the Cod to be told sold out out so ordered a pulled pork sandwich. It arrived with no meat what so ever and what was there was all fat and dried out. Manager did try to help out but at this point it's too late. UNDER NEW OWNERSHIP PRICES RAISED ON EVERYTHING AMD ITS GONE TO HECK AVOID AT ALL COST !!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Have ate at several Daves all over the US.... We have a few where I live in Nashville! the food is Perfect always our waitress in Vegas was Francesca (spell check) and she was amazing.... As always I took a bottle of Devil Spit home with me lol.... The joys of driving a Semi, food from everywhere!!"}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ.  Wish they could somehow use less sodium in there recipe's.  Server was a little too attentive for me.  Food was quick and hot.  Very nice dinner out."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now, both in a large group, and also with my husband.  The experiences were all consistent: great food and great service.  Bring vegetarian, there are few (if any) entrees to choose from, but I dine there specifically for the side items and cornbread.  They are that good!  My husband has always enjoyed the meat barbecue dishes, and the variety of barbeque sauces on each table to try.  The staff is very friendly and attentive.  It would be nice to see some vegetarian entrees that fit the theme of their restaurant, but I will still keep going there for those amazing sides and moist cake-like cornbread.  Yum!"}
{"text":"This is a worthwhile option for getting your barbecue fix in Las Vegas.

It's located past the Cannery Casino on Craig Road in a shopping plaza with a Lowe's as the anchor tenant and several other retailers.

Pricing used to be more attractive with a regular stream of email coupons for 20% off, \"Cue for 2 for$22.00\" and the like. However,  since the end of 2017 the offers all have mysteriously dried up. The company must have implemented a radical change in it's marketing strategy effective 2018.

They also used to have a Famous Lunch Card: buy 5 lunches and get the sixth lunch free.

The restaurant has dine in options as well as a unique separate entrance with dedicated parking for all carry out orders. Thus, you need not go into the main restaurant itself if you're a to-go customer. 

Specialties worth ingesting include the brisket, pulled pork, ribs and pretty much any of the combo platters. Delectable side dishes - any two of which come with a meal - include the Wilbur beans, garlic mashed potatoes, coleslaw and more.

When comparing Famous Dave's with the local Memphis Championship Barbecue, I personally like Memphis better. But perhaps Famous Dave's is more appropriate for your barbecue addiction?"}
{"text":"We ordered our food and before I could even check into Yelp is was in the table. Seriously less than 5 minutes. 

The ribs are succulent, corn is delicious and corn muffins are so incredible, that I eat them - gluten and all. 

We were in and out in less than 45 minutes. That's BBQ done right."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's has some of the best BBQ in the west coast that is readily available most days and times of the week.  I love the ribs and brisket, always cooked to perfection and if it's cooked too much, even better.  We got the feast for two people and it was more than enough that even gave room for leftovers.  I plan on coming back."}
{"text":"I guess if you're looking for BBQ this place wouldn't be a bad choice. I thought it was tasty though pricy. My girlfriend and I got the Feast for 2. It comes with a little bit of everything, pulled pork, chicken, ribs, fries, corn on the cob and two sides for $34.99. Out the door it was 37.82 before tip and we had enough left over for a small lunch the next day though I was conservative about how much I ate the night before. The pulled pork was my favorite, super smoky. Over all it was good BBQ but pricy."}
{"text":"This is my first time ordering from Famous Dave's and I ordered The Texas Brisket with mac 'n' cheese and coleslaw and everything was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend this place and will definitely be ordering from here often!!! Thank you Famous Dave's for a delicious dinner."}
{"text":"Love the ribs and all the different sauces. The best jalapeño Mac n cheese, BBQ beans, garlic mashed potatoes, and corn muffins. Usually get to go orders and service is always on point."}
{"text":"BBQ!! One of my favorite foods! Now, Famous Daves is very good.....for a national chain BBQ joint. GO ON TUESDAYS!! Its Big Slab Tuesdays.....$18.99 and you get the XXL Slab, Corn Muffin and 2 sides. Seriously, its enough food for 2 people. I have had most items on the menu, and I think Famous Daves does justice to BBQ food in general. I have NEVER had a bad experience, so that merits 5 stars in my book. There are various daily specials and \"Happy Hour\" specials too."}
{"text":"The food is good but the service was far below par. I had to wait on refills and Liz the manager didn't care about the poor service her employees gave."}
{"text":"1 star = for the corn..tasty!  Buttery! and for the super delicious beans.  Best beans I've ever tasted!  Has a kind of spice to it.
2 stars = for the mac and cheese...cheesy and yummy...there is even an option to have jalapeno flavor!
3 stars = for the pulled pork because it was the only meat with any real flavor

I would have given a 4th star for the catfish because it tasted good, but the serving was so small!  We also ordered the rib tips which tasted okay, and the brisket which was okay too, only if drenched in BBQ sauce because it was kinda dry.  

Overall, the experience was just alright.  I was not too impressed, but might come back for a second try if I need a BBQ fix as it is close to my pad.  Plus the sides here are really good, you know..be SIDES the meat!"}
{"text":"I'm not a rookie of Famous Dave's - the BBQ here is great and the variety of sauces gives you something for everyone's taste. We weren't so hungry that we felt like pigging out so we ordered the two item special, added another side dish to it, and split the entire thing. They need to put more two person specials on the menu. The 2 for 2 isn't they anymore but I heard another table ask and was able to order it anyway. Ask questions about the side dishes. I must have missed in on the menu but they had two types of Mac and Cheese, one with jalapeno peppers. What a terrible addition to Mac and Cheese. When we asked about it they switched it for \"standard\" without a problem. No complaints at all about the service - first class every step of the way and always with a smile. The total was about $30 so they're not inexpensive. Although it doesn't have the outstanding taste of an outdoor BBQ with the the family recipe, their BBQ beef is always tender and delicious. I'll keep looking for the genuine BBQ taste, but until I find it we'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Zooey-Mama!  This place has some decent 'que for being a chain.  I mean that in the nicest way.  This is some good stuff!

It was 'date night' recently and the lady and I finally decided to go visit Famous Dave's since we've always talked about it but never quite made the committment to try it.  So I gassed up the ride, put on some Mr. Bean in the DVD player, microwaved some popcorn, put out a couple Klondike Bars (hmmm...what wouldn't I do for a Klondike Bar?), and said \"Later, kids!\"  And we were off!  Although, thinking back I think I forgot to leave another phone number in case of emergencies.  Luckily, everything was fine when we got back home.  Except the funny English accent my little one gave me upon our arrival (thanks Mr. Bean).

Famous Dave's interior is really...decorated.  This place is like the Disneyland of BBQ!  There's stuff everywhere, I guess this is what it's like to come to a corporate BBQ!  Nothing like those down home places where all you smell is smoke, the walls are dingy, and the chairs are rickety.  Looks like Dave's been making a healthy buck on his 'que.  But the place was inviting nonetheless.  

Famous Dave's has a good menu that includes lots of appetizers, salads, burgers, sandwiches, soups, and BBQ combos.  But we were there for one thing only, the infamous 'Que for Two' for $19.99!  Sorry, payday wasn't until the next week and it was all we could afford.  Hard times I tell ya!  Upon ordering this from our server with some cold drinks, he was on his way.  20 minutes later our BBQ bliss had arrived.

I heard from co-workers that the Que for Two wasn't enough for two people and that I would be hungry afterwards.  Me being a 'husky' sized Asian boy was a little let down upon hearing this.  But when our platter arrived, I sure wasn't disappointed!  There was more than enough food for two!  We had four of Dave's 'Famous' ribs, 1/2 a BBQ chicken, 1/2 a serving of chopped pork+1/2 a serving of beef brisket (I couldn't decide on which one so I asked for both..ha ha), Famous Fries, two cornbread muffins, and a side of garlic red skin mashed potatoes.  I gotta tell ya'...it was all pretty good!  The ribs were moist, flavored well, and cooked just right with a tiny bit of bite in em'.  The chopped pork and the brisket were very good too, and tender.  But the biggest surprise for me was the chicken.  Often times chicken can get dry in a BBQ pit but this one was super succulent and moist, and the rub was great.  This was my fav of the night.  And it was all so good with their sauces!  I liked all six of them but my favs were their original Rich & Sassy, Sweet & Zesty, and the Devil's Spit (sucker is spicy hot!).  Service was good, our server kept up with us and kept us stocked with wet naps and our drinks full.  

Next time, I'm taking the kids with us and we're so gonna have the All-American BBQ Feast...old school and served on a trash can lid!  The lid is lined with paper...of course.  I saw it that night on a table...and the sucker is HUGE!  It can easily feed four people...unless you're a mighty Samoan...then this would be considered your 'Que for Two'.  

We had enough food leftover to take a doggie bag home for the kids.  Admittedly, I finished the last rib that night as a midnight snack.  But I did leave the fries for them!  But I did also manage to finish the little one's Klondike Bar.  Boy, am I a big lil' piggy."}
{"text":"I only went because it was my moms birthday. She chose famous Dave's. Not sure why it's so popular, it's not good. It's not just this location. I've been to a few other locations and I'm never impressed. 
My boyfriend ordered the burnt end sandwich because we know we don't care for their ribs. It was very dry and tough. Kids got a 2 meat plate with ribs and chicken fingers. They wouldn't eat the fingers because the said it tasted weird. Thinking they were just being picky I tried one. I'm not sure what all the put in the batter but something tasted kinda like perfume. It was a weird taste, couldn't be mad at them for not wanting to eat it. 
The Cajun chicken sandwich I got was ok. It came with a sauce, lettuce, tomato and their devil pickles."}
{"text":"Gotta see the cussing waiter, it's like having dinner and a show!   Great service and the happy hour specials are on point!"}
{"text":"The only real problem i has so much BBQ sauce i need more meat with my sauce. there nachos is not nachos and 2 times now there was hair in my food. there fried chicken was way to salty. just get the happy hour at 9:pm rib tips 5.99 i was full and left. but the other thing was my refills on drinks i had to walk to the chick to get her attention so many times. I'm looking for a  new joint to eat at."}
{"text":"Not the most authentic.  Not the best.  Good eats none the less.  I try to go here with a birthday BOGO deal as often as our family can.  I'm a fan of the happy hour baskets.  Lunch entrees are pretty good deal also.  I always try to bing a coupon or get a discount."}
{"text":"This was our first time at Famous Dave's and it was definitely a five star experience. I guess it is always a mixture of different things that make an experience a good one. The service, the atmosphere, the right quantity/quality of the food, and one's personal mood. Our server was also the bar tender and she was really great and went through the whole menu with us. She also made us her famous margaritas with Brandy on top mhhhhh As entree we ordered the ribs and they were AMAZING. Very moist and tasty. Their sauces were really good too. Our favorites were the sweet&sassy and chili hot."}
{"text":"3 stars because of mixed reviews.  Been here about 5 times in the last 12 months.  Half the time good service, the other not so good. Nothing bothers me more at a restaurant than a long wait when the place is dead.  I totally understand if service lags when the place is hopping, but not when it's quiet.  My last two time I've been here I got the same service.  Took a while to be seated and once seated, took forever to take my order.  Once you get your order in, the food doesn't take too long. So, you can't blame the cooks.  However, my bill arrived about 5 minutes after I got my food.  Talk about poor service. Take forever to seat you and get your order, but can't wait to kick you out.  This wasn't a one off thing.  Happened my last two visits here.  I would give this place less stars, but my belly left satisfied everytime. 

My Favorites Here. 
-Beef Briskets
-Ribs
-Corn Bread"}
{"text":"The most horrible customer service ever ! First we walk in & wait in the front for a good 15 mins before a host comes to greets us & seats us , then our server was HORRIBLE & I think she was probably high , I asked her THREE times for water with lemon , she brings the water & forgets the lemon TWICE! Then we order raspberry lemonade & strawberry lemonade & she mixes them up ... Then we have to literally wave her down for refills ! Her name is REDD. I'm 200% sure she is high as can be. Our food came out in 10 mins , & it tastes reheated. REDD offered us sauces but failed to bring them so we had to ask someone else to grab them for us. She grabs my plate not even asking me if I want a to go box ...so here goes another 30 mins before we get our check to go. Still no lemons for my water either .... Now on to talk about the food ....

The brisket was just full of fat , so it was GROSS. I had 2 pieces & left it alone. 
The mashed potatoes were OKAY , I've had better. 
The mac & cheese was disgusting !!!!! It didn't stand a chance. 

The corn bread was GREAT & so were the beans. 

The raspberry lemonade was also good. 


I'll never come back here & this was my first time & last for sure. I'll stick with lucielles"}
{"text":"Mid 70's weather outside on the patio, 5 different bbq sauces, and well cooked meats among friends.... what more can you ask for? 
Been driving by this place for a while now and finally had a chance to suggest it as we couldnt figure out what to chomp on for the evening. Rolled in dinner time about 6-7pm and it wasnt terribly busy, the patio was open and the weather was hard to beat so sat outside. We were greeted by (forgot her name) our waitress who was on point all night and very friendly which i think really helps make a meal and the experience of eating out. After placing our order for 5 consisting up several two meat combos and then my own meal of the \"man handler\"  excuse the name but it sounded good on the menu, a sandwich made with brisket, and sausage chopped up with pickles and i added coleslaw to the top, also came with a side which i chose to be the mac n cheese. The assortment of sweet, spicy, tangy, etc sauces was a good variety as there is something for everybody. My sandwich was tasty as the meat was cooked well and the coleslaw actually was a nice extra to have on this particular concoction. And the mac n cheese with bits of corn in it was on point but $10 for a sandwich was kinda enn.. although good i would like liked to have either fries or a second side for $10. Everybody else seemed to enjoy their food also at my table which isnt easy to do with a decent mixed bunch as we were. Will i come back? Sure maybe to try out this happy hour that i just read up on Arron M.'s review as i like the food but for the regular price i think id rather eat something more filling so if there are specials then count me in that day. Money is tight these days so im trying to cut where i can...damn i feel like a pig because the sandwich didnt fill me up.. weak."}
{"text":"Pretty good but not the best.  Our server tried hard to be helpful but they appeared to be understaffed.  The \"manager\" came by and apologized without our complaining, it was a bit odd."}
{"text":"I'm from the south, so maybe I'm biased....
but I can't quite bring myself to RAVE about the food here. 

Don't get me wrong, it's definitely \"good\", but I'm a bit spoiled by my upbringing... 

The BBQ is pretty good, but the meat wasn't cooked as tender as I like it. Between the group of us, we had some ribs, hot links, and chicken as well as the Wilbur beans, the mac and cheese, the green beans, some potato salad, pulled pork sandwiches, and the corn muffins. 

Out of alllll of that I have to say my favorites were the hot links, the mac and cheese (though their's is prepared with jalapenos so that would suck for someone that doesn't like spicy food :( ) and the corn muffins.  The food came fresh and hot and the staff was friendly from entry to exit. 

All in all, a very pleasant visit...decent-enough food and friendly staff will keep this one on my \"Ok, sure. We can go there\" list... but if you've ever had BBQ in the south, you'll definitely notice the difference. They're a great option for Vegas though ;)"}
{"text":"I come into this FD's for lunch. Great food at reasonable prices.  If you like wings, their buffalo wings can't be beat.   Also for about the same dough as Five Guys burgers, have a Brisket Burger with a side and you'll love it and ruin you for other places' burgers.  All this and a friendly staff too"}
{"text":"Best Que I've had from a chain joint. I was a bit apprehensive at first but my fiends put me at ease and assured me of it's greatness. I learned two things that day, my friends know good bar-b-que, and I can eat more food than I thought.

I got the brisket, chopped pork, beans on the side, fiery green beans, corn in the cob, and corn bread. It was a lot of food. I can't believe I ate it all. I washed it all down with a big beer that was at Happy Hour price. Right up my alley.

Everyone was nice and helpful. I know I'll return again."}
{"text":"My hubby and I tried this place again a few weeks ago and the service was amazing. We went again tonight and what a difference night and day makes. The service was just awful.  40 minutes for our food because they were waiting on one item, but could not give us an update as to why until the food actually arrived. Neither of us got a refill on our drinks even though they sat empty for most of the meal. No up sale for dessert and there were long periods of wait time between everything. Meanwhile the other server was working the room like Cinderella, she even showed off her daughter who was with other family members who were chowing down. (It was pretty close to closing at the time.) Our server was just plain phoning it in. I do not recommend going to eat here at night."}
{"text":"Probably the best pulled pork sandwich with slaw that I've had in the five years we've q-searched in Vegas..."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's has surprisingly good ribs for a chain restsurant. Corp recently changed the menu and they only serve St. Louis style ribs, no more baby back ribs. 

The pulled pork is my favorite dish along with the burnt ends. The BBQ sauce is tasty & tangy and they have additional sauce selections on the table. I've never had the desserts, because I'm so full from dinner, but the brownie looks amazing! 

I definitely reccomend this place for your BBQ fix."}
{"text":"Normally my experience at Famous Dave's is positive experience, but today was one if the worst meals I have ever eaten! I have visited Famous Dave's all over the country, and while not the best BBQ in town I have always enjoyed their food. Today I got a pick up order for lunch. Ribs & brisket that were drowned in sauce, and dry as a bone. Brisket that was discolored,  and equally as dry! That was a horrible meal, and I even made a complaint to there corporate office."}
{"text":"Great place! Always have great service. I sat in the bar section today Tad served me and he was excellent! We had a good conversation and really good service. Obviously I'll be back."}
{"text":"The fact that this place is rated so highly confuses me. It's a chain. Nothing special. They have several different sauces to choose from. None of them are anything to write home about. The service was good, but as for the food I won't be back. I'd rather have real barbecue."}
{"text":"We had the feast for two. The portions were huge and the BBQ was delicious. We ordered take-out, the food was ready upon arrival. I love the parking spaces directly in front of the take-out entrance."}
{"text":"I wanted to bring in lunch for clients who requested Famous Dave's. There were a total of 6 of us and this was the first time I had visited this location. For delivery the order needs to be a minimum of $150.00 so I called my order in for the All American Feast the day before and advised the staff I would pick up at 11:30 am

I arrived just after they opened at 11:00 am and went into the bar area where the waitress was very helpful. Within ten minutes my order was ready to go and they included paper plates and utensils

The lunch included a full slab of St. Louis-Style Spareribs, a whole Country-Roasted Chicken, 1/2 lb. of Texas beef brisket, creamy coleslaw, famous Dave fries, Wilbur beans, six pieces of fresh sweet corn and four Corn Bread Muffins. I added on to my order an additional two pints of sides - beans, slaw, 2 corn muffins and 6 cans of sodas. The food was put on a large tray with the exception of the sides which were packed efficiently. The food was a hit and tasty. Ribs were smoked and tender, brisket was yummy and chicken flavorful and moist. The sides were solid and the extra pints weren't even touched BC we had so much food. Actually the platter fed a total of 7 and was a great choice.

My clients were happy, since it's difficult for entire staff to get out of the office and I was able to secure some orders! I would definitely use Famous Dave's BBQ in the future for lunch to go."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch before visiting some clients in NLV. I sat in the bar BC it has plenty of flat screens to watch your favorite sporting event.

I'm not a big fan of the chain BBQ's but there's not a whole lot of choices in this part of town. My order for lunch the two meat combo - Georgia chopped pork and St Louis ribs with side choice of beans and corn muffin. I was given some BBQ chips to munch on b4 lunch arrived. Overall the food was tasty, fresh and my Asian waitress was friendly and made me feel welcome.

The food and service was spot on at this Famous Dave's BBQ and I'd return here again."}
{"text":"If I'm in the mood for American Barbecue I normally like this place.
I usually get the sliders but with all hot links sausage and topped with cole slaw. I do like the pork ribs as well. The corn bread muffin is good, it's more like a cupcake than cornbread and I do prefer wedge fries which they have.
The BF loves loves loves the rib tips smoothered in the \"Devil's Spit\" barbecue sauce, barbecue beans,cole slaw and corn on the cobb.
The fried onions is a greasy but yummy appetizer and you can't go wrong with sweet tea with lemon-refreshing!!!!
The kid's meal includes oreo cookies and finally they offer shrimp-YAY!!!This location is always clean,has fast service and with a full bar  it always feels like a party up in here!!!!!"}
{"text":"This location is just down the street from from the Air Force Base so I usually stop for takeout right after work. If you are military they have Military Monday's FYI. I love ribs and got an email for the Que for 2 special for $19.99. It came with 6 ribs, half a chicken, beef brisket, 2 corn muffins, and 2 small sides. Definitely feeds 2 people and you get to try a little bit of everything. I'm not sure how much the feast is normally but if you sign up on the website you get deals sent to you quite often. 
I've been to the Henderson location and I really like this on much better. The to go area is quick and the people at the counter are usually very friendly. 
I knocked off just one star because they do get my sides wrong a lot when I call in my order. But that's an easy fix and I just have to wait a minute or two extra. But other than that this place has always been consistent with the food."}
{"text":"I have been here several times now and have been thoroughly disappointed every time. Let me tell you what's not good since I haven't found anything worth eating. The catfish is bland soggy and fishy. The brisket is dry dry dry and overlooked.  The ribs (St. Louis not baby back) were dry and overlooked...  The chili is weird....  Don't know how else to describe it.  The bar didn't have a top shelf. Sorry. The best thing they have is the corn bread muffins. Those are good actually."}
{"text":"Pretty good. The meat is great. They mix orders up sometimes and you don't always get what you're supposed to. Otherwise pretty good food and nice people."}
{"text":"Absolutely the worst excuse for bbq spareribs ever. Instead of a half-rack of ribs, I got burnt scraps - very little meat and that was dry, black, and butter like only burnt meat can be. 
I don't know if the place is under new mismanagement or if they're having labor problems, but the service was a disaster."}
{"text":"Server doesn't have any patience at all very grump, food wasn't good ribs was hard and not cook properly, the brisket was ok"}
{"text":"The corn muffin made my 6 yr old daughter very sick. She now says she never eants to smell or eat another corn muffin in her entire life. And she use to love them. And since the ribs were part of the meal she says she wants nothing to do with ribs again and ribs use to be her favorite.  So im not sure if someone touched the corn muffin and it was contaminated with something or maybe it was the ribs but my daughter was sick within a few hours. I guess unfortunately i wont be back here ever again due to her getting sick and also the fact she wants nothing to do with ribs and corn muffins.  Its a shame. Becareful people."}
{"text":"I was created right away and seated as well. This was on a Friday for lunch.
After seated my waitress's came over right away and grabbed me something to drink.
Food came fast service was very nice."}
{"text":"Good service & good food!! Their special everyday @2-4pm & @9-10pm & I always get ribs tip and sweet mama punch.. A must try!!"}
{"text":"Excellent BBQ! We've gone here twice and both times we ordered the Que for Two, $19.99- which is a special (great deal), but you must ask for it, since it isn't on the menu. We got the following (several choices): brisket (my favorite- but ask for it \"lean\"), ribs (my husband's favorite), chicken, two corn muffins, steak fries, coleslaw, and a slice of toast. The service was not only great, but quite speedy- we actually got our food in five minutes! The meat is so tender- falls off the bone tender, the (yummy) corn muffins , and the fries were very good as well (don't usually like steak fries so I was pleasantly surprised). On your table sits a paper towel dispenser and wet naps tucked in the sugar dish- which you will need to use because as you know, your hands will get very dirty. Also, there are five signature sauces, like Devil's Spit (hot! unless you like the heat) and Sweet N Sassy. The server can explain what each sauce contains or you can be adventurous and try them all. We had the bread pudding for dessert, which is more like a flan (love flan), served with a scoop of vanilla and whipped cream with a gooey caramel nut sauce- delicious, but we were so full at that point that we didn't finish it. (And we did some shopping/walking afterwards- one of the best strip malls in the city, BTW.)

There are other feasts on the menu for groups of four- which are great deals and served on trash can lids. Sign up on their e-mail list for coupons. The mascot is a smiling pig(why do they always have to be so cute?); kitsch barbeque decor and, the staff wears logo t-shirts with funny barbeque-isms. The hostess opens the door for you and greets you with a smile. Way better than Memphis BBQ. Will definitely come back here."}
{"text":"First time here ordered the sample plate has little bit of everything for 2/3 ppl dinner was amazing everything was delicious. Give you bbq chips to sample there bbq sauces were tasty pineapple one was my favorite sweet hint spicy and the sweet sauce definitely will be returning kids eat for .99 with purchase of entrée on Mondays only they have tables , booths and outside seating"}
{"text":"Whats funny about this place is alot of things on the menu are good EXCEPT FOR THE RIBS! Dig into the traditional wings with the pineapple habenero and then add the Ultimate BBQ Burger with jalepeno bacon,cheese,bbq pork and you have a deadly combination. Sides like Wilbur Beans and Mac and Cheese are very memorable too."}
{"text":"Good food great service Best BBQ on the south side staff is very friendly restaurant is very clean"}
{"text":"Everytime we come to eat here we are always seated promptly . The bbq is delicious. I love all the sauces they have on the tables! Good to dip your fries or chips into it! The food portions are pretty big so make sure you come hungry! The staff is very friendly and the manager is seen walking around asking customers if everything's ok. Thats always good! No complaints from me."}
{"text":"Great place to cure a hangover. They skimped on my mudslide though, maybe it was the hangover."}
{"text":"Famous Dave's quality at this restaurant has gotten wayyyy better.  When this location first opened it was such a novelty in a part of town without many choices. After a while the quality had slipped considerably and I say that as a big barbecue fan. I'll eat mostly anything with barbecue sauce. I remember the food was so salty that it wasn't even worth making the trip. We had moved away for a few years and when we came back, I avoided this place based on prior experience. 

Well, we dined at Famous Dave's for the first time in 4 years about nine months ago and I was totally shocked.  The ribs were excellent. The burnt ends were actually edible. The only thing I don't like is the green beans. I wish they'd cook them a little more. There are a little too crisp for my liking.  Famous Dave's is going back into our restaurant rotation."}
{"text":"the peeps here were nice. the food was yummy! hubby and i took leftovers since the portions we got were HUGE."}
{"text":"The food was EXCELLENT! I would recommend the Burnt Ends. They are very flavorful. You can get them as an appetizer, which makes a great meal in itself or the combination plate. 
If you go here, try out their Bread Pudding. I had to pick out the raisins, but they were all on the bottom, so it was easy to do. I personally didn't like the raisins, but other than that it was FRICKEN AMAZING! I haven't had Bread Pudding like this since I was in New Orleans! 
The server was rude...I asked what \"Rib Tips\" were and he rudely replied, \"They are Rib Tips\". Which first off , DUH! I can read! Secondly, really? That's your response? Anyway, if it wasn't for the EXCELLENT food we would have walked out. So yeah, I would come back for the food! Maybe he was having an off day."}
{"text":"Came in on the fourth of july. What started off as a horrible experience turned into a good memorable time. We placed our order and 45 mins later  watched other groups getting their food first. we asked where ours was. As upset as we were and getting ready to walk out the door David stopped us. He is the general manager his quick solution and heart felt apology turned a bad night into a good one. Him and his crew earned 5 stars sucks it had to start off bad but his leadership skills really helped lead his team to fix the mistake."}
{"text":"We always seem to be by during the daytime happy hours. The brisket is always soft and flavorful no matter what they are placed upon. The mini corn bread muffins are a happy sweet addition to their dishes. We always get immediate service in the bar area. Staff work well w/each other."}
{"text":"KOMP 92.3 brought me here again! I won a $75 giftcard for Fathers Day but I couldn't wait!

I thought I'd splurge ao I got the Feast 4 Two, a Texas Manhandler Sandwich and 2 mini Strawberry Shortcakes for dessert.

Damn it taste so much better when its FREE!

As expected the service was good, the food was great and dessert topped it off just right.

THanks KOMP! & Famous Dave's!
Be sure to check out the NEW pics."}
{"text":"We ordered take out the meat was beyond bad.Complained to  Famous Dave's at above to no avail.Contact main one still no action taken.Letter never came for anything free.Service is slow not going back.THANK YOU"}
{"text":"Seats for 8 Airmen, please!

Not to bad for my first time here. Had the Two Meat Entree with my choices of Southern Spare Ribs(8) and their slow cooked Brisket(6). Everyone and myself were surprised how big the plate came out to be. (brought other half home to the kids) Both were good, but i liked the spare ribs more smothered in that Sweet and Sassy BBQ sauce they had goin on. All the other sauces didnt really phase me. For the brisket, it was pretty dried out.. never got to taste the juiciness that I had imagined from the picture on their menu. 
The best tasting part of the entree was the cornbread believe it or not.

Definitely coming back for more on the menu, price is fair and staff is bigbooty.. I mean friendly!"}
{"text":"1st timer.   I don't know why I've never tried this place before.   Service was great & so were the ribs.  Few sauces to try ribs with.  Definitely try the corn bread."}
{"text":"I like the st louis style ribs. The BBQ sauces are great,"}
{"text":"I gotta say Famous Dave's disappointed me last night. I was all revved up from goin out shootin in the desert with my fiance and we got stuck in Nascar traffic on the way back home. Needless to say, we were starved after being in the desert and then having to sit through traffic like that!

We decided on Famous Dave's, which I have been to before and I remember it being pretty dang good. However, I think maybe Famous Dave's has lost its glimmer of BBQ goodness to me. Maybe it's because I've had better BBQ elsewhere...

We split the 2-person plate, which is half a rack of ribs, beef brisket, chicken, 2 cornbread muffins, 2 corncobs, and a crap-ton of potato wedges. The wedges were taking up half the plate! Oh, you also get baked beans and coleslaw. So how did all this food stack up?

Ribs - 3/5 
Yikes. Yes, I know. Although they did have a nice pink smoke to them, they were not very tender, and much of the meat would not come off the bone without a lot of gnawing. 

Beef Brisket - 2/5
SALTY SALTY SALTY. Oh and not to mention way too much fat. For a BBQ joint I'm surprised they don't select better meat.

Chicken - 2/5
I just did not like the seasoning on this chicken and compared with the other meats on the plate, it just seemed out of place. It wasn't cooked very well either. Just meh.

Sides - 3/5
Wedges were tasty, but way too many. Beans were pretty good. Cornbread muffins were tasty and sweet, and the corn on the cob was actually perfect. They also served the tasty little BBQ chips so you can taste test the sauces with them. 

Sauces - 4/5
For some reason FD's is doing an awesome job with sauces, but not so much their meat. I mean, I LOVE their sauces, especially the Devil's Spit and the Texas one.

Overall - 3/5
It's okay. But for a BBQ joint... eh, it's just missing that kick, it's missing that fall off the bone wonderfulness you expect."}
{"text":"Amazing staff. We went there to celebrate out wedding and Had 25 people and they went above and beyond to help get us all set up. Mike was our waiter and he was awesome. He made the night perfect. He kept on top of our drinks. Food was amazing."}
{"text":"I really loved the shredded pork sandwich and pork ribs! It is one of my fav place to go for some ribs!  I love the look and feel of restaurant and my friends from Indiana loved it too!"}
{"text":"This is a good average corporate chain BBQ place.  High marks for the attentive and prompt service.  I was very happy with the way the chicken turned out.  Not authentic BBQ but will do in a pinch."}
{"text":"Came here last week never been here before but decided to try it out.
Everything was really good !! 
I got the nachos with brisket as a appetizer they were Delicous so good then I got I believe it was the devil spit brisket burger it was delicious also and the service was good too I'm definitely coming back !"}
{"text":"Stopped by this Dave's around 3 on a Saturday for a late lunch.  Food was awesome.  Service was great!   My husband had never been to a Dave's and said he would definitely be back.  We sat at the bar and played Keno.  My husband won $400.   Pulled Pork, Brisket, Beans are just some of our faves.  Give em a try!"}
{"text":"I love coming to this location. The servers are always nice and so quick to get your drinks filled up again. We had Ashley Serve us and it was a very nice evening. She was all smiles and so friendly. The ribs were amazing! And we always enjoy the corn muffins and spicy Mac n cheese. We will be back. Thank you Ashley for your fast service good job  and we hope to see you soon."}
{"text":"If you're looking for BBQ that's fast, delicious, and decently priced here's your place! 

Many of the reviews base their opinion of this establishment being a 5 star dining facility, when it's not! 

The service is good and fast even when it's busy. The food is up to par with most BBQ places I've ever been to, and they give you a dessert with a sparkler! What more could you want?! 

I always get the brisket or rib platter. Both are amazing and great sized portions. Even when I call an order in, it'll be done within 15 minutes and tastes just as good as sitting down inside. I definitely would recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Great meal. Pork BBQ w pineapple and coleslaw. Guess I was hungry because I burnt my tongue I ate so fast. But it tasted great. Service was prompt and accurate. Price was fair. I ate enough so I probably won't need anymore than coffee tonight. I've been to a FD in Boise and this was comparable. Thinking about my \"burned tongue\" now I think it was the pineapple. Tart! But it was yummy."}
{"text":"Awesome food amazing price 9.25. Come for lunch! The lunch menu is great and they showed me the new lunch menu starting next week that is going lower in price! Happy is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"Had dinner there.  They have the best smoked salmon Caesar salad.  The salad was discontinued but they will still make a version of it!!!  Great place.  The burnt ends appetizer they serve are the best!!!  A little small on the portion size and a little costly for the small size....  But very good!!!!"}
{"text":"Love the beer batter cod, which is new. We go to Dave's on Monday's because they have military discount. We love the servers, they are so friendly, attentive, and fast. Their burgers are so good and big!! Bbq is very good, but we love to have so many other choices. Love the decorations."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for many years now. At first it started out great, with amazing service and really great servers. A few years back they got a new general manager in and we had two trips that were just atrocious (one trip involved the manager herself who was beyond rude to us) so we stopped coming for awhile. Last year we started coming back and have had the best service every time. A few weeks ago we had server Michael (a very happy young black gentleman) around 7pm and he was absolutely spot on!! He had the biggest smile and was genuinely interested in our dining experience right through to the check, not just a forced politeness like many servers. Even when he was ridiculously busy with several tables he checked on us with lightning speed. If he had his hands full he would STILL pause and say I'll be right back with those cocktails for you folks, just to keep us updated that they were on the way. So many restaurants you wait and wait and don't know if they forgot about you, were just busy, or what the deal was, so this was really refreshing! What impressed me the most was soda refills without us ever saying a word, offers for replacement alcoholic beverages, and the fact that every single time he went back towards the kitchen he grabbed empty plates or glasses from our table or his other tables. I watch so many servers who mosey along and perhaps check in with their table but never clear it, leaving everything to the busers. He not only ran around bringing all this orders out to the tables, but you could see he was sizing up drinks and plates every time he went back too. We were in and out within a half hour. I cannot thank him enough for the excellent service. We tipped him well and want to recommend everyone ask to be seated with him if he is working. Our food was super speedy from the kitchen and everything prepared just as ordered. Great job Famous Dave's! =)"}
{"text":"Came here me and my girlfriend on our 1 hour lunch break. The food was delicious. We got the Que for two, although it really wasn't as much food as we expected we had got wings as an appetizer and were full. The meat was tender and well seasoned and the server was very attentive. My glass never went empty. This is a decent priced good meal."}
{"text":"Great food and service.  Amy was our server and was excellent.  Can't say enough good!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite during lunch. Came in wanting Burnt Ends but the server recommended the Texas Beef Brisket. After the first bite of this smokey, well seasoned brisket I forgot I was eating at a chain. Friendly service and a very fair price."}
{"text":"The one star is for the food and gentlemen the sat us two thumbs up for them!
My man and I were craving Famous Daves for about two weeks, we decided to go in on a Sunday.. young man (server) greeted us right when we walked in asked us if we wanted a booth or table we chose booth. We sat for about 25 min decided to wave down the manager Liz she never greeted us just asked if we knew what we wanted to drink she brought us our drinks we told her we were ready to order and she walked away 10 minutes later a lady by the name of Susan comes up to take our order still doesn't greet us and I have yet to see anyone smile but the gentleman that sat us. Our appetizer came with chips (witch we have had in the past) it didn't have enough chips so we mentioned it to the server she rolled her eyes and walked away? about five minutes later we asked for the manager the manger came and we explained how we didn't appreciate the service. The manager mentioned that my man had used the F word with the server when we asked for more chips crazy part is my man has never cursed once during our relationship so can you tell me where this F word came from?  I have never experienced such horrible service not to mention people who make up false accusations. I love Famous Dave's but I refuse to come back to this location. Liz and Susan need SERIOUS TRAINING!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you just crave a quick and easy meal. My boo, his mom and I came here for a quick bite to eat before a movie at the Cannery. We sat at the bar and the bartender on duty was super friendly and attentive. She made sure to keep checking on us and even reminded us before happy hour ended to make sure he got our last drinks in. 

The food was actually pretty good too. It was classic chain BBQ, but done right. I had the Grilled Chicken Sassy Salad which was dressed perfectly. It had just the right portion size and the toppings were all very fresh. I also had the Bloody Mary which was delicious. It was pretty spicy, but I liked it. I do wish it had more toppings though like some cheese sticks or more vegetables.

Overall it was a pleasant experience and I'd definitely come back again for a quick lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"yum! our first stop when we arrived at Vegas. My brother has lived there for 30 years so he knows the places to go to. The food was great and I loved the 100 calorie margarita! Maybe my favorite Margarita ever, too bad they dont' have Famous Dave back east :-(
Great staff there too!  
Oh and the sauces are yummy!"}
{"text":"Yummy yummy barbeque. Happy hour is from 2-6 for 23 ounce domestic beer. They have lunch entrees which are a lil smaller than dinner but cheaper.

The pulled pork is delicious! We ordered the american feast, You can choose i think 2 or 3. We choose the ribs, pulled pork and bbq chicken. (making my mouth water right now.) 

The cornbread is yummy and all the bbq sauce is delicious. A must try.

I still haven't gong to texas or missouri to try there bbq. If you don't have money for that, this is pretty damn good and close to home. A MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place for ribs! Every trip to Vegas includes a trip here! Consistent no matter which location you choose. 

I  had the St.Louis rib combo w/ rib tips, very good. For my sides I chose the baked beans and mashed potatoes.

Service and food always good!"}
{"text":"Famous Dave's was a favorite of my boyfriend, and I was quite excited to see what the excitement was about. The restaurant is spacious with booths and family dining tables tastefully decorated in a hunting motif. The wooden tables and walls gives for a nice ambiance for good eatin'!
Like most bbq restaurants you have more options than you can choose from, for me it's always the 2 meat with 2 sides. It's necessary for me to always have one of the meat choices be ribs. I love ribs. Pork and beef alike, I don't discriminate when it comes to red meat. I am a believer.
The first thing to come to the table was their famous bread pudding.. As my boyfriend MUST always eat dessert first, I have the opportunity to know if I need to leave room for my own after dinner. The bread pudding is so good that he won't order any other option. The bowl it's served in could hold a King size portion of linguini pasta. The dessert itself is beautiful, the way it glistens it what looks like candied pecans and fun juice. Slipping down the side was a nice size scoop of old fashion vanilla ice cream; which you need. This dessert isn't for someone who can not appreciate sugar. It was pretty dang good, I could only handle a bite, but my photo will show you that was not the case for my boyfriend.
I ordered ribs and a hot link with a side of green beans (small bacon pieces thru out), spicy macaroni and cheese, then of course I paid the extra for the loaded baked potato. Because what's BBQ without a baked potato? It came with a delightfully sweet corn bread muffin and a thick slice of white bread.
Famous Dave's have a few sauce options on the table and they definitely have more variety then most. I tend to like the more spicy of the sauces. 
The ribs though... Wow.. I was very impressed by the cut of meat. It started a conversation, and a failed Google search attempt, to find out where they purchase their meat. That good. The rib was seasoned slightly leaving a ton of room for me to taste the beautiful taste of meat. It was thick and meaty.. It was purrfect.
I highly recommend Famous Dave's for a couple, group of friends, or family. You can't go wrong. It's good enough to keep the table quiet, while everyone licks and devours what fun deliciousness is in front of them.
By the way, their was a separate bar area that looked fully stocked with top shelf liquor and happy partons."}
{"text":"So this is the first time since coming here that I've had an issue here.   Happy hour just make sure you say you want an appetizer from the Happy hour menu because it is not mentioned that if you order from the regular there is a difference.  But John B. who was real good about it talk to the Manager and I explained to her that I didn't know.  It probably should have been explained especially since I asked about the \"happy hour\" beer.  They fixed my bill .  I'm happy and shall return as a regular customer.  I love great customer service! Always happy with my food! Today I had rib tips and buffalo chicken wings.  The wings were well done just how I like them but not saucy enough."}
{"text":"This past Saturday was the first time that I dined in a famous Dave's. My brother and I were on the way to the Cannery, and he told me that I ought to give it a try. Why not, it was across the highway?

   The service from the \"Welcome to Famous Dave's\" upon entering the door to the the time that we paid our bill was exceptional. We were treated to complimentary potato chips that could give Frito Lay's a run for their money if they were sold in supermarkets. My brother and I were never rushed.  Our personable waitress was prompt on drink refills. The Manager even asked how everything was. After the meal there was zero pressure to stop talking and leave. I am under the impression that customer service matters at Famous Dave's. Likewise, customer service matters with my reviews. With that in mind, I upped my rating of this Famous Dave's from 3 & 1/2 to 4 stars.

   After seating us at one of the many booths overlooking the bar, our waitress explained the P.I.G. Club. I am so against joining anything called P.I.G. Club. This made me conscientious of what I was going to put in my body. I deviated from the typical BBQ restaurant brisket, ribs, chicken thing and ordered Dave's Favorite Burger. Dave's Favorite Burger may not be Daniel S's favorite burger, however, it was good. From a quarter century of dining in BBQ restaurants, I have come to the conclusion that they prepare well-done burgers. Dave's Favorite Burger included melted jack cheese, smoked bacon, and Dave's Favorite sauce. As expected, the burger was sticky. It seemed that I used the equivalent of a dead baby tree to wipe my hands constantly. Overall I enjoyed the burger and the french fries that came with it.

   What stands out at Famous Dave's are all the sauces on the table. I had the choice of sweet & saucy, Texas Pit, Devil's Spice, Rich & saucy, and Georgia Mustard. There was the standard ketchup next to all the sauces.

  I am glad that I finally dined in a Famous Dave's. It is not guaranteed that I will return to one in the immediate future. What is guaranteed is that I will not be joining the P.I.G Club.

{"text":"Good food. Great Happy hour and lunch menu. It really make the food affordable. The servings are HUGE. The food usually comes out quick, so you can eat inside in a short amount of time."}
{"text":"The food was really good and the service was amazing!   I can't think of a place with better waitresses.   The ribs,  bbq chips and g grilled pineapple were all very tasty."}
{"text":"Came in for a family dinner for 6 and a high chair. We were seated promptly since the restaurant wasn't very busy. 
Service was eh not exactly a point that I would come back on. My order got messed up could've had something to do with the loudness of the restaurant or our sever not really paying attention who knows. Not a big deal I let it go but my girlfriend brought it up and she apologized and offered to get it fixed I didn't want to wait so I just ate what I got. The bbq chicken was good, juicy and tender. Not a big fan of the Mac and cheese that has corn in it and what seems like queso cheese sauce. 
Server took awhile to come back towards the end of our meal with our check and we ended up just waiting with everyone finished for maybe about 6-7 minutes. 
All in all Id give the food a 5 star but I wouldn't call that \"Mac and cheese\". Service left a bit to be desired as far as being present and cutting above mediocre, so three stars on the service."}
{"text":"BS 

Want something quick? Something messy? Want some good old bbq - go here.  Just chill atmosphere and food comes out fast.  I love places like these since they are convenient.  If you got a super bowl party or a birthday party or if you are feeling like a chubby bunny and beast mode into a rack. Chill with Dave.

Food is edible and messy (who uses utensils for bbq anyway?)
Restrooms are ok.
Table wait time none usually unless it's a holiday
Take out wait time is meh
Customer service is average.
Tables are old but comfy 

* Boomsauce scale.
BW = Dis $@% is wack son!

BS++= That's Whoa! That's good.
BS+++= Dayumm! That's fkn DOPE!"}
{"text":"Went here for dinner the other night and got chopped pork and beef brisket with the jalapeño mac n cheese (delicious) and beans. The meal was good, service was good (we sat in the bar) atmosphere was good. I felt like it was a little over priced but it was good food and a lot of food! Overall great dinner minus the price..."}
{"text":"Always good food and service! Amy is the best! Starting coming here when I first moved here and won't stop. Prices are very cheap too, especially during happy hour."}
{"text":"So I was calling to put in a togo order and the girl who answered was so rude. Also tried to ask her questions & acted very irritated with me. So instead of coming in for dine in or putting in a togo order, we decided to go to the other restaurants near it. If they have a horrible customer service over the phone, I can only imagine how they are if we were to eat in there."}
{"text":"Services was efficient. We were seated quickly and drinks/food were provided promptly! Really enjoyed the BBQ for one platter(although it took to people to finish) I loved the brisket, ribs, BBQ chicken and cornbread. I will  definitely return this place!"}
{"text":"Heard only negatives about Famous Dave's. Only went here because it was next to our hotel. Glad we did! It was yummy! Went during happy hour, 3-6 I think. $2 beers, but I loved the $6 Lynchburg Lemonade!  LOL! The deal was the Rib Tips! $5.99! And it was a lot of meat. Ours was really fresh and loved all the sauces they have at your table. Devil's Spit was my fave. We ended up ordering a Chicken Grill Sandwich and Chicken Caesar Salad. Both were good. Place was clean, service was good. Overall, will return to this location! (Nothing was over the top, so gave it a solid 4 stars)"}
{"text":"First of all, We came in about 30 min till closing. Jenny was our waitress...The nicest lady you'd ever want to meet. We told her it was our first time and she treated us like family....let us sample the different sauces and gave really good suggestions on menu choices. I do eat much Barbecue outside of my own & family made but this was really good stuff!!! I will definitely be back and also go to the California location closest to home!!! The food was outstanding but the service was even better. I'm a ppl person and knowledgeable friendly staff makes all the difference in the world to me."}
{"text":"I hate having to do this but... 1 star for the new management. I LOVED this place before. Happy hour was one of the best in the valley. Now they have removed the happy hour, and it is on a request type basis now. Total Bummer! The burnt ends were to die for. I love the chips that you munch on while waiting for your food, that's really worth that 1 star. Our server informed us of the change of ownership & how menu items/prices have changed. We gave it a closer look to notice and it did in fact change. They had Bar Rescue come in and revamp their drink menu which is cool. I just loved how convenient this spot was for some tasty BBQ. Now it tastes so bland, it's like too 'fast food' like for me. I wish this place stayed consistent through the change but it looks like I will venture back to Lucille's for some real good home style BBQ."}
{"text":"In Michigan I refused to eat at a Famous Dave's because I had never heard of them, they just popped up almost overnight in different places.  Since no one I knew ever ate there I stayed away.  

Today; however, I ate here for lunch and was really amazed at how great this place actually was.  I always love it when someone opens the door to welcome me into their restaurant, I know that seems trivial but to me it makes me feel they are happy I came.  Our server was equally amazing, she made sure our drinks were always filled and the food came out in perfect time.  She even remembered to bring a lemon with each one of my iced tea refills!  Not many servers remember to do this after the first one.  

I just ordered the Famous Dave's Cheeseburger and could not finish the entire thing....something else that impressed me was that the manager went around with a smile, she stopped at every table to ask us how our lunch was going and Thanked us for coming in.    

I know this is a chain restaurant but this is definitely a place I would go to again."}
{"text":"Ribs are awesome.  Sides can use some work.  The loaded baked potato is not loaded at all.  1 dollop of sour cream and cheese that is not even melted.  Mac and Cheese was good. Cornbread was amazing.  The fire green beans are spicy.  Make sure to get the ribs, everything else is OK."}
{"text":"Best ribs ever!!!! We went on the reviews posted, figured we try it on the recent trip.  Wow the service from when you enter to when the you leave awesome.  I had the St. Louis ribs and brisket combo. The ribs awesome taste and you get to try the different sauces from original to hot.  The brisket was the most tender I ever had.  Laura was our waitress and she gave us the excellent service and very friendly.

Had to buy the sauces to bring home.

Need to add this to your stops in Vegas."}
{"text":"I've eaten at this place for lunch a few times over the years. It always has good food and the staff are generally pleasant and efficient. Lunch usually draws a large crowd...particularly on Friday, so be aware that a quick lunch isn't had at this place. They can accommodate larger groups pretty well. Famous Dave's has one of the best BBQ chicken breasts as its moist and has the right amount of sauce. And I've had nothing from the menu that wasn't delicious."}
{"text":"I wouldn't say Famous Dave's is great BBQ it is great food. Everything on the menu is delicious and is always consistent, a bit too consistent. While I do love everything about Famous Dave's, it's not true BBQ.

This location has friendly staff, is always clean and never too busy to just walk right it."}
{"text":"Last night my wife & I enjoyed FDB. Talking about very tasty sauces and the food was pretty good! I've only had food to go so now it was time to sit down and enjoy a quiet evening with my wife and that's just what we had. The service was pretty good and the food had a decent temperature. I truly recommend going to eat after 9 PM for those of you who don't mind a late dinner. All in all we have to give them 4 1/2 Stars!"}
{"text":"It's like the Applebee's of BBQ.  Typical, fairly overpriced, nothing special.  Eat here if you have nowhere else to go :)"}
{"text":"I like this place and enjoy to go here with family and friends!

1.  Menu - It can be difficult to figure out what you want, if you don't have a specific item that is your absolute must order. In this case, if you are with friends and family, order the All American Feast which is served on a garbage can lid.  Great selection.

2.  Garbage - Again, if you order the feast that comes on the garbage can lid, which I love as it is in the middle of the table and all share, they you can add on things like sausages and etc for a small fee.  IT is truly great stuff. 

3.  Price - Reasonable.

4.  Kids - They will love it, why?  See point 5.

5.  Sauces - You can put your own sauce and they have plenty of choices on your table. Chances are your kids will not want a sauce as tangy and hot as you want, so this is a great choice for all. 

6.  Large Groups - Great for this, but sometimes they can be a bit busy, so be careful and plan. 

Overall, a nice place to enjoy and hang out."}
{"text":"Daves has made a few changes and one of the most recent additions on the menu is Burnt Butts, burnt end pork but in a sweet and spicy sauce. Best new item I've had at this place in 10 years, highly recommended!"}
{"text":"On our vacay to Las Vegas but had to take a moment to tell y'all how much I freakin' loved this place. Delicious food and friendly staff inviting decor my husband and I ordered a BBQ combo plate brisket and burnt ends burnt ends were our favorite great sauce and yummy sides we ordered beans macaroni and cheese potato salad and cornbread all were good great weekday specials too cheap beer wish we had one in the sacramento area we definitely give it two thumbs up we may go back before we head home"}
{"text":"What's not to like? Food is fast. Lots of specials. Service is fast and friendly. Sweet tea is amazing. Nice sauces. Bar seating as well. And most importantly, the food is good. I've been back time and time again."}
{"text":"Love this place my first was at galleria circle near sunset  station at the Henderson satisfied with all the meal i ordered .. and this place was alright because of the brocolli was really salty -.- the first two was alright until i bite the third and it taste straight up salt smh .. the ribs doesn't have the flavor i ate from the last time .. but always the cornbread is to die for im still giving this 4 star anyways .."}
{"text":"I've been driving past this place every day for a few years now so I decided to give it a try.  I stopped in last week for the first time.  You can't really go wrong with BBQ, and the food was terrific!  I can't say I tried anything I didn't like!  The varieties of BBQ sauces on the table was a big plus, and allowed me to try a sample of every flavor on my appetizer before I decided on my main course.  



I ordered the traditional wings in pineapple rage flavor as an appetizer.  The flavor was nice and sweet with a trace amount of spice (too much spice for my 6 year old, but I barely tasted it), at $9.99 its a great deal, and the portion size was good enough to be most people's main course.  

I also ordered the devil's spit burger with a side of pineapple (love that this is a menu option instead of fries!).  All in all it wasn't a bad burger, just small.  Also, there was barely any devil's spit sauce on it and I had to add my own.  Half way through I decided to add the rich and sassy sauce too; and while I loved the devil's spit, I found the rich and sassy sauce to be even better! 

The only downside I can say is that my waitress seemed a bit off.  I asked her about about the BBQ sauces listed on the menu.. hoping to get an idea of what the flavor of each was and she snapped \"look they're on the menu\". I mean.. I know they were.. that's why I asked about them.  That, and she took very very long to come back and check on us each time.  It happens, but hopefully it's not the norm."}
{"text":"It is pretty decent for fast food BBQ. The ribs are not excellent but they are decent. I really like the Mac and cheese here a lot and I buy the cornbread to go when I get a chance. They have a lot of sauces so it is fun to experiment. Jut stay away from the riblet appetizer. I have no clue what those are but they are nasty."}
{"text":"Came here based on a friend's recommendation and ordered the sausage plate and some wings. My sausage was very burnt and wondered if that's the way it was supposed to be. I really didn't care much for it being so burnt. They brought out some chips, which were good dipped in some BBQ sauce. The wings were ok. The waitress was not pleasant at all. She had a very aggressive attitude and came off rude. I'd probably pick a different restaurant if I'm back in the area again."}
{"text":"Our visit was good.  Danny gave us great customer service, the food didn't  take too long, and the quality  of everything  was good.

I love all the different sauces they have on the table.  Also they have great options if you are watching  what you  eat."}
{"text":"We have lived in Vegas now for over a year and have yet to try a Famous Dave's. We figured it was about time to try. It smells great when you walk in. When moving west from the southeast you yearn for that smell of BBQ. The service at this location was fantastic. I cannot say enough. I normally would praise the server by name, but I lost the receipt. I had the Georgia BBQ and it was pretty good. Don't get me wrong I have had better BBQ, but for west coast and a chain this was pretty good. I could not give it five stars because for a BBQ place I have had better. But it was good none the less. One big issue for me was that they put jalapeños in their mac and cheese. I am not sure where that comes from but it needs to stop. I grew up on good southern mac and cheese and never ever have they put jalapeños in it."}
{"text":"Hmmm....got to front door walked in nobody waiting. Handed a beeper...yes doesn't everyone hand you a beeper when its empty? Sat down and another couple comes in....another beeper handed out. Smartly after a few minutes they returned the beeper and left. Another 3 minutes I walk up lay the beeper down and announce were leaving. As were leaving the two girls chit chatting while we waited to be seated in the empty restaurant giggled with a customer as we left. Called manager 20 minutes later fuming at being treated so poorly...guess what...they were unavailable. ...not there on a Saturday night at 5 pm? Sad part is we've been there before and its been good. We will NEVER return. I will however contact the owner. Sad folks don't care when money walks out the door..."}
{"text":"Best BBQ I ever eat. !!! My and my family came here and every one loved it. !! Food came so fast and we were looking for a place to eat for over 2hours. So were very hungry. !! A must go in Vegas!!"}
{"text":"Nothing says bbq like famous dave's. Now this famous dave is not the first one I attend. I have been to another famous dave's in Fargo, North Dakota. I can honestly says that its awesome all over again. From the phrase at the door, the server guidelines through sauces and the absolute fall of the bone ribs tastiness. Nothing say bbq quite like famous daves.

Try the combo lunch specials with two items and a side. Or their delicious chilis or even their super fantastic briskets. Either way you will love it here. The only dowside here is your satan's spit sauce is not as spicy as Fargo's one. Come on, make it real spic!Y!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I really love this place, even though we are not big on chain restaurants.  We've been here twice and had a good experience both times.  The portions are huge, the food is great and you can't beat how cheap it is! (especially for us New Yorkers).  If you're looking for a good, inexpensive meaty meal, this is definitely the place to go!"}
{"text":"Server was good service was Not they forgot our silverware, 2 sides and muffins our food took a long time to come out and when my food finally came out it was cold I ask if they could warm it up and when they brought it back out the sides were warm and the meats were still cold I was highly disappointed"}
{"text":"The food and presentation was good. I ordered the \"Burnt Ends-N-Rib\" combo with the Wilbur baked beans and corn on cob. A corn bread muffin is included.

I sat at the bar. My only complaint was the bartender wasn't as attentive as he could have been. There were only 5 people at the bar, yet it was hit and miss for him to notice an obvious need such as an almost empty drink. At one point I got his attention for a drink, but after 5 minutes after not getting one, I had to get his attention again to finally get a drink. No apology that he had forgotten. To his slight defense he was also servicing the waitresses, but there wasn't hardly any orders coming through there. I used to manage a bar, and know that a good bartender should constantly be looking for obvious signs of customers in need of more service."}
{"text":"I like it here, but more so my fiance likes it here.  There isn't enough of a variety on the menu for me, otherwise we'd come more often (I only order seafood and vegetarian and only one of the 3 seafood dishes isn't deep fried....so we basically only go when I'm in the mood for salmon."}
{"text":"The reason I'm giving only three stars is because I order a family style meal at 6:00 on a Thursday for my mother birthday and was told that there was no chicken, the waitress said we could have a different kind of chicken either wings or chicken strips. I was very disappointed with this because I really was looking forward to the regular chicken and wings aren't the same as a whole chicken in size or flavor.  The family meal usually comes with a whole chicken, ribs, brisket plus sides.  The ribs were very good tender falling off the bone and very tasty, brisket was ok and the sides were very good. I just don't understand why on a Thursday at a BBQ restaurant  they would not have any chicken, very bad planning.  I don't think the next time I'm in Las Vegas I will be coming to Famous Dave's"}
{"text":"Freezer burn, freezer burn, freezer burn... 

It's the worst thing you can taste on your food.. I have been to MANY Famous Dave's restaurants all over Las Vegas, but this time, it wasn't good at all... 

I ordered the Grilled Salmon (8 oz) and I hated eating it because with every bite I could taste the freezer lol. I drenched it with a LOT of sauce! My Fiance had to order a new Texas Beef Brisket because the first order wasn't good to him. His second plate, he says was much better. The servers and manager were always there, if we needed them, so that's why I give them 3 stars. 

The sides were great and never had any bad feelings toward them. Definitely the corn bread muffins!! MMM! 

Famous Dave's is being beat though by a lot of different BBQ joints out here, so they gotta fight!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! My husband and I had a great experience at this Famous Dave's location, we were especially happy since it was our first time at a Famous Dave's. We were simply passing through on a road trip from North Idaho to Southern California and we were both craving BBQ. We were seated immediately at a table but preferred a booth so they quickly cleaned one off for us and had us switch waiters to this awesome tall guy who was super nice and friendly, I wish I could remember his name. He was thrilled it was our first time at a Famous Dave's and he made sure to tell us all about their different BBQ sauces and he brought us their homemade chips to try each. Our food came out so quickly after we ordered, we were impressed and the food all tasted incredible!! As we were getting ready to leave the waiter informed us that first time customers get a complementary bottle of their favorite BBQ sauce so we left with a bottle of Rich and Sassy! Next time we drive through North Las Vegas we will absolutely visit this location again!"}
{"text":"We had excellent service on a monday night from Mike. He took our son's order first so he can be put first.  He explained the happy hour menu to us and took our order. Our food was out in 10 minutes. If you visit and take the survey at the bottom of the receipt you get a free dessert!"}
{"text":"Food is pretty good...except the only good ribs they serve that are real soft and moist are the the Southern Rib Tips..the St
 Louis Ribs are kind of on the dry side. I always order the Rib Tips for that reason..their fries are the only fries I like in Vegas incl. McDonalds?  Lol.?  Their other sides are pretty good the portions are small for a reason cuz their meat will fill u for sure!  Their deserts are toooo big..I always have to take them home. My fav is the Bread Pudding by far.."}
{"text":"Happy Hour:
Every Day
2pm-6pm

23oz Domestic Beer $2.99
Dozen Wings: $4.50
Rib Tibs: $4.25
Onion Strings: $3.50

The food here is always great.  The lunch specials are also a pretty awesome deal.  I think it's $8.99 for a two item combo (ribs, tri tip, hot link, chicken, etc.).  Tons of food for $8.99!"}
{"text":"I am a huge BBQ fan. I literally had John Mull's Meats & Road Kill Grill on Saturday for ribs then came here on Sunday lol (Probably not too healthy of a weekend haha) This place is very good for a chain restaurant. Compared to Lucille's and Tony Roma's I would consider this place (at least this location) to be the best out of those three.

I ordered the Feast 4 Two meal which feeds 2-3 people. It comes with beans, coleslaw, cornbread, spareribs, chicken breasts and wings, pulled pork, and a slice of bread. After the two of us were done, I had enough to fill an entire to go container up to the brim!

They have 4 different sauces, Rich & Sassy, Sweet & Zesty, Georgia Mustard, and Devil's Spit. Out of the 4 I think the Sweet & Zesty and Devil's Spit tastes the best on the spareribs and chicken."}
{"text":"My sister wanted us to try this place during our visit in Vegas, The BBQ Ribs were sooooo good. I believe what made the ribs so good was the various sauces they offered, For the amount of food we ordered, the price was not bad. We ordered the All American BBQ Feast with an extra Full Slab of BBQ Ribs. The ribs and brisket were scrumptious. The sauce I fell practically fell in-love with was the Rich and Sassy, while the hubby became obsessed with Sweet and Zesty. I finally went to their website and found they do have a location in Vista. Now I have found a reason to drive up North which is so worth it."}
{"text":"I had a craving for bbq, and this place hit the spot. Our server was pleasant, and the customer service was excellent. The food was delicious, and well worth the price."}
{"text":"Nice chain restaurant with exceptional service and yummy bbq. They have some great happy hour specials as well. The bbq brisket baked potato is delicious as is the pork sandwiches. Have had solid experiences each visit here."}
{"text":"Being from Texas I've come across FDs on my travels and gotta say best damn BBQ. Surprise there's not one in DFW Texas...probably give them a run for their money lol. Lunch is $9 good portion meal. It's a must have BBQ stop!"}
{"text":"We waited longer than we should have and our server was a bit high strung for our taste. After watching him bounce off the walls he finally arrived at our table and talked so fast that we could hardly understand him. We ordered our drinks..........long pause.........he dropped off the drinks and long pause again. We finally got him to take our order and we ordered the Lunch Rib Tips one with french fries and the other with mac n cheese.

Our food arrived and the presentation was wonderful and then you start looking for meat on the tips.......hmmm well maybe 2 of the tips had some meat and the rest was fat. The mac and cheese was different as it had corn in it but it was tasty.

It wasn't the greatest experience so we will go back and give them one more chance to see if it was just one of those days. :)"}
{"text":"YUM! Pork nachos, pulled chicken sandwich, salad with really good ranch dressing, broccoli and cheese baked potato, mac and cheese and the best cornbread muffin I've ever had! I thought the food was great, obviously. My hubby found a chicken bone in his pulled chicken sandwich and they took it off the bill without us even asking, which was very nice. All the food was prepared well, came out hot and quickly. Our server, Lacey, was wonderful and right on top of things. Price was great for everything we got (even before the sandwich came off the bill). The only gripe I have, is that there were jalapeños in the cheese sauce over the baked potato and it didn't say that on the menu. It wasn't a deal breaker though. The restaurant was clean, bathrooms were clean and we will most definitely go back. 

Update: Rib tips were amazing, bbq chicken totally rocked, broccoli and mashed potatoes were awesome, but the pickled onions topped everything off PERFECTLY! Why have I never seen these here before? They made everything I paired them with, divine. Bathrooms were super clean (again), tables were clean, server was great. My one gripe this time, the beef was DRY. I'm talking beef jerky. Still five stars because all the awesome overshadowed the jerky, but I hope they fix this before we go back. And we will go back. My daughter and I eat mostly vegetarian. This is our cheat day place. :)"}
{"text":"Good commercialized BBQ for the price you pay... esp for the family feast.  Their new tacos were ok per the wife since she wanted something different.  But I recommend sticking to their main staples, like ribs, briskets, and chopped pork.  Not as expensive as Lucille's, but if you're looking for some real southern BBQ in LV, you'll need to search on Yelp and don't be afraid to explore off the beaten path.   But recommend you go during daylight hours.  =)"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch and had zero problem getting sat quickly. Considering it's this close to the base that is a great feat in itself. We had quick service which is why they get 4 stars but the food is just chain BBQ nothing to write home about. Can someone explain why they let that blond worker sing to the customers..it's weird, not funny and someone should make her stop!"}
{"text":"Famous Dave's Best barbecue place in town I highly recommend stopping in!!!!!! if your dining in or ordering to go I would definitely try there Zesty barbecue shredded pork salad if you haven't tried it it's so good it my favorite!!!!!"}
{"text":"I did not enjoy the overall experience I had in this famous Daves.  We arrived to a slow Monday evening, we were promptly seated, our drinks came out and we ordered the family barbecue for 2-3 people with spare ribs, brisket, chicken potatoes corn on the cob and coleslaw/mac and cheese as sides.  We waited more than an hour for our food!  As we waited my baby nephew was fussy and the waitress brought him out a corn muffin as long as he promised not to cry really? Smh.

The food was awful! Everything was super dry and bland, the coleslaw tasted old.  We were given a free dessert to take home for our troubles but needless to say we are not coming back!"}
{"text":"Soo 3 weeks ago I ate here and u have one word for this place that will be Disguest is a good word for this restaurant food was horrible tasty like a newly born baby puke on my green beans the hush puppies are like turd overall only because they comp us some of our food they get 2 stars never eating here again"}
{"text":"In every culture, the basic instinct to throw meat over an open or
indirect fire is fundamentally ingrained in all. There is something
delicious about the char-grilled flavor and marks that have us
crawling back for more.

I do not know what style of BBQ this is. Is it Memphis, Kansas City,
Carolina, or Texas style? I am not sure, but it is appetizing. The
variety of sauces are different in their own way. There is nothing
more disappointing than getting ready to try all the sauces to and
finding out that they do not have much distinction. My favorite is the
Wilbur's Revenge. It gets some brownie points for references to a
childhood classic, Charlotte's Web. This is their spiciest and it does
not hit you until the aftertaste.

I was not hungry, but my dining buddy was ravenous, so we got the
Dave's Sassy BBQ salad and an order of 12 boneless wings. I know, who
goes to a BBQ joint and orders a salad. I would have agreed with
everyone who makes this statement, but there is something irresistible
about this one. For being a basic greens salad, we opted for the
pulled pork and then smothered it in the Wilbur's revenge made it
thoroughly enjoyable. Normally, I shy away from over dressing a salad,
but not here. BBQ sauce might be my kryptonite. The boneless wings are
nothing special, just your run of the mill variety. For the $10, you
are paying roughly the same price as Buffalo Wild Wings on Boneless
Thursday. If you are dining on any other day of the week, it is a good
deal. If you want more options on sauces then go on Thursday to BWW.

The prices are cheaper than Lucille's, but I will wait until I try
their ribs before I start comparing. Two meats, two sides, and corn
bread at Dave's cost about $10 dollars less than their competitor."}
{"text":"I've been here many times. My friends and husband insist on dragging me here even though I don't really care for it.
 The staff is great, the restaurant clean, prices are comparable to other BBQ eateries. I just don't get the reason everyone raves about this place.
I've had the ribs, the brisket, and the chicken...the chicken was the best thing I've had there. And it didn't need to drowned in sauce. Everyone around me saturates their meat in BBQ sauce, shouldn't the meat be delicious enough to enjoy as its presented?? I don't think their BBQ sauces are any thing special. Their corn muffins are pretty good, but their other sides leave much to be desired, and I've tried each one.  Their Sweet Mama's Punch is tasty , but I can't go and get a corn muffin and a gallon of punch...or can I?"}
{"text":"Order our meal, the we waited 76 minutes we got fried pickles and that's it!  Very disappointing to sit and watch other parties get their food and not even a manager or the hostess never checked in or apologized for the lack of food.      We never got our food after 80 minutes we left, not a sorry, not any remorse to my wife and I.  We left and went to Taco Bell, got fast food, not the best, but we got what we ordered and people were friendly.    We won't be back for awhile, until some changes are made!   No more disappointments for us!"}
{"text":"Went on a Tuesday night cause of the burnt ends with cheese sauce commercial my husband saw on tv. After ordering the server informed us they ran out of cheese sauce also no Sam Adams. After waiting what felt like 20 more minutes in a maybe 1/2 full restaurant we finally got our order and the burnt ends were cold, grilled pineapple had no seasoning as promised by the servers sales pitch and the ranch was weird! St louis ribs were a little tough but eatable with the variety of sauces and the muffins were good. Needless to say we were disappointed. No manager around, this restaurant had a manager issue. We likely wouldn't go back to this location."}
{"text":"10.13.11
Our party of 4 was passing through the Vegas area & thought bbq was in order. 
Of course, we Yelp'd the closest place in the area we were in and 4-star Famous Dave's popped up.
It was last Thursday night about 8 p.m. The joint wasn't busy & we showed ourselves to the bar area. Our server was our bartender & she was quite perky with a smile & very attentive.
My Fat Tire was cold & refreshing especially after a long drive with 3 buddies.
My 1/3 slab of ribs arrived at the table steaming hot. Accompanying my ribs were my side choices of the slaw & wedge cut fries. The menu boasted a 4-bone hand rubbed spiced ribs, but there on my plate, I spied a 5th rib! SCORE! Either I was REALLY hungry or the ribs were actually quite tasty...so tasty, as I was taking my last bite off the last available rib on my plate, I had wished I'd ordered a 1/2 slab. As a member of a competition barbeque team, I can honestly say these ribs are better than most teams we've gone up against. 
I can't speak for the restaurant side, but the bar is large with a small selection of draught on tap. Several flat screens hang from the ceilings & viewable from anywhere you sit.
I also can't speak for my compadres' dinner selections, but judging from their empty plates, they also were either very hungry or this place really IS quite tasty.
However, I drew the short straw in sharing a room with the buddy who ordered the side of beans.
Good stuff Famous Dave's. I shall visit another one of these soon, provided I'm in the vicinity of one & have a hankerin' for bbq on the fly.
Cold beers & above par bbq.
Better than warm beers & bland meat.
\"...because, without BEER & BBQ, things do not seem to go as well...\"
Rounding up from 3.75 stars.

Eat well & drink responsibly...this has been another deez® review because you need it & want it. Enjoy."}
{"text":"The BBQ here is good and satisfying, but not great.   Their service is usually pretty fast. I've never received anything here I didn't like. I wish they had healthier items on their menu for those dieting, but oh well."}
{"text":"Nicky is hands down the best server I've ever had, I would go back just for her recommendation"}
{"text":"Ordered the meal for 2 (to go) = 1/2 BBQ chicken, 1/2 rack of ribs, 1/4 lb of brisket, small containers if cole slaw and 2 sm corn on the cob, 2 corn muffins and some wedges.  All for $40.  Food was pretty good but my issue is the price.  I think the meal is more worth $30-35.00, $40 is a bit steep considering the sides are really more portioned for 1 person.  Not bad BBQ though, better than Memphis BBQ.  I've eaten inside this restaurant before and I would recommend take out, their servers are rather rude and they arent customer driven.  To go was really quick (ready in about 5 min after we ordered).  This is a once in awhile place for us..."}
{"text":"So after fun at the park we decided lets get some bbq. Famous saves it is. We only waited about 10 min to get seated on Presidents' Day not bad at all drinks were quick and the waitress was great got our order after the wife finally decided what she wanted lol. But then the wait came there was only four of us. It took over an hour to bring our food four tables around us sat and ate paid and left before we even got our food. Yes the waitress offered us free bbq chips witch was nice but I was starving. 

Finally the food came my wife's daughters and sister in law food was nice and hot and then mine almost asked if they had a microwave but I was to hungry to wait any longer. The taste was there but the wait and I should of had fresh food too. Then had to ask for ranch 3 times for my daughter never got it. First time at this location. Possibly the last I'll go to another next time. 

Being a veteran on Mondays I got a discount witch I appreciate and the 99 cent kid meal works to but was it enough for over and hour wait and a Luke warm meal idk. I normally don't leave bad reviews and nothing against the waitress she was awesome it was the back of the house that collapsed."}
{"text":"Sean is the perfect example of customer service. Hey kept up on our orders and still showed a smile. Give this man a raise. The food....Ohh the ribs , they fell off the bone. I have never licked a rib but the dry rub made it worth it."}
{"text":"For about $20 I had a half rack of ribs and rib tips, and bottomless Iced Tea. They had a cool bar with several TV's so you can watch Baseball, Soccer, and Golf at one time.
The service was real good, friendly, and prompt. My meal also came with Potato Salad which was good, and Green Beans, which were not bad. I plan to go back again."}
{"text":"I had been to famous Dave's before and decided to swing by again. My girlfriend and I were seated right away with no wait, and our server was there a few moments later. The staff was kind, and especially our server Chase. The food was pretty good, and was out really quick which is why I couldn't give five stars considering there is no way they freshly cooked all of our food in 8 minutes. Most of my review is based off of the excellent service that Chase provided our table. He made sure we had prompt service and was extremely kind. The food is delicious, and especially the sauces that they have on the tables. Try them all"}
{"text":"We used to love this restaurant before it changed hands.  While the staff remains terrific, the portions are way smaller, we did not get dressing on our salad (had to ask), no butter with cornbread or vegetables, and just generally disappointing.   We were given canned responses to our questions as to why no butter, why no dressing (\"we don't put butter on plates or tables\" and \"the cook says she put dressing on the salad.\")  Um, no! Scaling back this much is not a way to win customers.  We're going to look for another BBQ place."}
{"text":"Mediocrity has a pink ring.

I'm seriously astounded that Dave is this award-winning pitmaster because pretty much everything I've ever had from here has been flavorless. The chicken, the ribs, the pulled pork, the sides - all of it.

And BBQ is way too fattening for it to be worth it when it doesn't live up to expectations.

To call Famous Dave's the Olive Garden of BBQ would be an insult to the Olive Garden."}
{"text":"Are you a barbecue snob?? I don't really know how the words Barbecue and snob really jive but apparently they do. I sat next to a family where the father kept saying, \" wow, I am a Barbecue snob and I think this barbecue is amazing!\" So of course I looked over to see what this Que king was eating and he had the ribs and the brisket... I Could not let this self proclaimed BBQ snob enjoy all the saucy goodness all alone so I ordered the Ribs and Brisket combo with the mac and cheese and potatoes... 

The waiter brought out the plate and to the eye I was impressed, it looked juicy, tasty and everything a BBQ snob hopeful could ask for. I pulled a rib off the half rack and raised it to my mouth......... Now that you are waiting for some crazy descriptive to tell you how delicious it was take a moment to enter your own word here............... Okay that's enough of that, its my turn, It was Crap, somehow the rib pulled off the half rack but maybe in the 2 foot travel to my mouth it got jet lag or something because it was dull, dry and unexciting. I was in no way impressed and was doubting the BBQ snobs credentials. 

I then figured, \" well I need to be fair, and try the brisket,\" It had that nice brisket look with the pink rim and cooked center so i grabbed my fork and went at it. Hoping to reignite my passion to be on the BBQ snob wagon I tore into it and low and behold I had the same crappy experience, it was dry and had a rather odd taste for brisket. If I could have made a BBQ Snobs citizens arrest or revoked his snob certificate I would have. 

The server was great, he kept my drink full and checked in on us just enough to be very attentive and not a creeper. So if you really take a look at what I am saying, I would go back for a drink, some mac and cheese and to socialize with a waiter... Is this reason enough to go back... .Ehhh, Not this time.... Sorry Dave!"}
{"text":"I have only been to the Famous Dave's in Henderson, so I kind of knew what to expect.  We were there early so there was no wait for a table / booth.  We were taken to our booth and given menus and a child's crayon set to keep her busy.

Anyhow, we went through the menu and picked out what we were going to have.  We were greeted by our waiter who was extremely talkative.  He seemed to have a story about everything.  He was witty and efficient.  He takes our drink orders and came back to take our main dish order.  We ordered Brisket, Mac n Cheese and burnt ends.  Everything was alright, but not memorable.  

There are other BBQ places in the valley that are much better.  And, worth the drive... But, if you are in a hurry and for convenience, this place is alright."}
{"text":"As first tine diners Famous Dave's did not disappoint. They have HAPPY HOUR! For starters we had the burnt ends with a cheese sauce it was so amazeballs that I had it again for my entree accompanied by succulent 1/3 slab of ribs with mac n chz with coleslaw. Both yummy.  My husband had the feast for two & everything was delish. Jenna was our server who was knowledgeable,  friendly & efficient.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Excellent Service & Excellent Food!! From the moment we walked in the service was great! The food was delicious and very well recommended for families."}
{"text":"I have absolutely no idea why people love Famous Dave's so much in Las Vegas.  There's really little to love, as nothing I had was executed properly.  Dry and flavorless meat (the ribs are hilariously awful).  Sides that were not real exciting.  The people working there are nice, and the cornbread is ok, which is why I'm not giving them one star. 

For entertainment value it might be worth going here so you can see huge platters of saturated fat being devoured by people who care nothing about what they shovel in their gullets.  The one particular time I was there, my husband and I were fascinated by two large people eating one of the biggest platters of meat I have ever seen, more than I've seen in any casino buffet. 

Am I a BBQ snob?  No, because if you read Raymond B's review, Famous Dave is supposed to satisfy these people.  I just really really want to have better BBQ than I can make at home.  But sadly, Famous Dave's, Memphis, Lucille's, and TC's Rib Crib have all been completely disappointing. 

I don't know what it is about this city and BBQ - we have probably the best selection of restaurants in the entire world, but we have no good BBQ that I have found.  I've had better ribs and BBQ in Washington State, even in a town of 12,000, and WA is more known for its seafood than anything.

So bottom line, I have not found good BBQ anywhere in this town, and this restaurant continues this trend.  If you absolutely have to have fatty meat with loads of sauce which isn't that good, this is a great place to go.  If you want real, scrumptious, smoked meat which has been carefully tended to, I have no idea where to go, and I would love to find out."}
{"text":"We stop at this place after driving from LA. Seeing at least a swarm of 100 bats flying around me made me get the munchies. Plus I ate magic cookie earlier so the experience makes the road trip more interesting BTW. 

I had the beef or pork brisket I can't remember exactly well haha. There's 4 different type of BBQ sauce. They should at least put the BBQ sauce on the meat while cooking, then I would of add more stars. This place is legit. 

Now it's time to party in Las Vegas during the Halloween weekend (Andrew WK style)"}
{"text":"My family eat here every week since we can't seem to find decent food around here. I love the cornbread and the banana pudding it is my favorite. I always order takeout and Jose is always so nice. I always order the whole bbq chicken so I have enough for lunch and dinner and my husband loves the cheeseburgers."}
{"text":"We just had dinner. The service was great along with great food. We had the Famous plate for two. We have leftovers for tomorrow.  It was all so good."}
{"text":"Best BBQ joint in town that we've tried better than Memphis and their service is definately better than Memphis
Always get the pulled pork sandwich and gobble it up."}
{"text":"LOOOOVE this place!! The sauces are absolutely amazing also. the food is awesome! deffintly coming back!!"}
{"text":"I've never been here before and they keep springing up all over the city so I thought may as well give it a try. Walking in the decor was like any other chain restaurant, nothing special. I did like the bar area, had extra tables to eat at if you didn't feel like waiting in line and if you wanted to sit at the bar there weren't any video poker machines so you could actually sit at the bar and eat and drink without having the glare and screaming lights telling you that you too could get a royal flush.

The service was nothing short of excellent. Everyone was extremely friendly. Every server said hi, bye, smiled, quick, attentive, almost seemed like it was their first week and were trying to impress. Bartender even came around out of the bar to take more drink orders. Very strange but me likey.

Food? I see that they were voted Best of Las Vegas 2010, but I have to say I liked the barbecue at Lucille's better than the food here. Their signature wings were pretty good, definitely better than Buffalo Wild Wings, meat wise anyways, the barbecue sauce was so so but still I will be going back for the wings.  As for everything else, I had the brisket, half a chicken, half a slab of ribs, the green beans, fires, baked beans, and garlic mashed potatoes.....don't judge me. The brisket was okay, I had to keep saucing it up, I would of rather had the tri tip at Lucille's. The chicken wasn't the half rotisserie chicken I was expecting, it was more like a pigeon leg but... it was decently flavored. The ribs were good, nothing to write home about but good enough. The sides though? I'd pass, nothing really stood out and I actually didn't finish them. The service was good but the food was just not as good as Lucille's or even close to the barbecue down South. But would I go back? Absolutely, but probably just for the wings and a beer."}
{"text":"Burnt brisket was disgusting.  Had a party of three no one was particularly blown away.  The chili was good along with the spicy mac n cheese.  Wanted it to be good because it's right by the house, but will make the 20 min drive to Bells BBQ every time now."}
{"text":"Went here today around noon for lunch. Erika was our waittress. The food was awesome. Minus one star because my husband ordered a salad with ranch dressing and it came out with blue cheese. We asked Erika if she could bring us some ranch and she argued with me that it was ranch. And then she brought us another cup of blue cheese dressing claiming it was ranch. Whatever. Minus another star because the bread pudding in the picture on the menu looked nothing like the bread pudding we received."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service and very clean and friendly atmosphere.  Their \"Famous Margarita\" is one of the best we have found in Las Vegas.  We eat there regularly!"}
{"text":"Best BBQ in Vegas. This location can get pretty crowded around dinner time (7pm), but it's worth the 20 minutes wait.  The meat is always tender and slides right off the  bone and the 6(?) choices of BBQ sauce to eat on your meat are all equally great.  My favorite is sweet and zesty.  I've tried the Georgia chopped pork and rib tips here and the flavors are just exquisite.  The average price of a dinner is about $11-$12 and they make sure you leave good and full. 

 The meal I usually get is a BBQ combo. It includes: Your choice of meat, your choice of two sides (I love the jalapeno corn man n cheese and the garlic redskin mashed potatoes), a cornbread muffin, and a corn on the cob FOR ONLY $10.99!!!  

You can't beat all that food and all that flavor for such a great price.

Check out the picture I posted and I'm sure you'll be runnin out the door   :]"}
{"text":"Famous Dave's is consistently decent bbq.  I like the ribs and brisket, but the chicken is just ok for me.  I like the sides here better than Memphis Championship BBQ, with the cole slaw and cornbread muffins being the stars.  They have a couple of sauces that are not on the table that they will bring upon request.  The first is a pineapple sauce that is very sweet and the second is a hot bbq sauce that is pretty spicy.  

The server was pleasant and efficient."}
{"text":"I've always passed by a famous dave's and finally gave in & tried this place! When I first stepped into this establishment, it had a very 'homey' feel to it. The employees were very nice & friendly. I ordered the Feast for two, since I wanted to try a bit of everything and I was sharing this meal with my spouse. The feast for two came with ribs, chicken, and a third choice of meat. We chose brisket. The sides that came with our meal was cornbread, baked beans, mash and potato salad.

Let me start off by saying, the cornbread was so damn good!!! I don't like cornbread at all... but when I had their cornbread, yummm! I want more already. The ribs were cooked to perfection. The meat was literally falling off the bone! The chicken was delicious. It had lots of flavor. The brisket was my least favorite personally. But my other half really enjoyed their brisket. At the table, they have additional BBQ sauces/hot sauces to accompany your BBQ. They also provided a roll of paper towel & some wet toilettes to eat as your heart desires! (Plus one!!) I love a place where you can eat freely. The feast for two was a lot of food. We even had some leftovers to bring home. 


Overall, I really enjoyed this place. I will be coming back for those cornbread."}
{"text":"Been to this location several times as I live near by. Everytime we go it has been a pleasant experience with great BBQ selections. The staff is always nice and ready to serve you at anytime. We have also enjoyed sitting at the bar and watching sports while we dine in. Warm and inviting atmosphere too!"}
{"text":"We come here about 2-4 times a month. For dinner we usually get the Feast for two. For lunch the 2 meat platter, even though the pulled pork sandwich is amazing too. Their brisket is great most days, okay on others. Ribs and beans are always great so is everything else really. 

Be warned though that lunch takes forever. Usually 30 minutes before you get your food. Once it was cold too, but they quickly took our food back and when they brought it out again there were double the ribs on on the plate.
The manager is a great guy, very personable and seems to be great at his job too.
Darion who does take out is fantastic also, she remembered my order when I'd call in more frequently.

Our most recent server was Sean. Who was a funny guy and brought out the staff to sing happy birthday to my husband. He seems to really enjoy his job and spreads good energy. 

5 stars for the food and staff
-1 star for the slow service during lunch time"}
{"text":"Bad a$$ food!! Wish they sent out coupons, I would have eaten here sooner! Food was awesome, and service was speedy and friendly! Much better than other BBQ places for less $$!!"}
{"text":"My very first visit!!  Cute place and perfect for a birthday gathering.  They let my friend bring in her own cake (boobie cake of course because we live in Vegas) and the wait staff all came out singing!  

I highly recommend Jalapeno Mac n Cheese and the Moonshine Margarita!  Don't be scared - trust me!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I leave God's great Texas, I get desperate for BBQ, and every time I'm disappointed and dissatisfied. Where to start. If there are 5 sauces on the table, one should be edible. Any time there's more than 1, maybe, 2, that's an indicator to stand up and leave. Of the 5, none were edible. Different variants of ketchup and vinegar. I ordered a loaded baked potato, not on the menu, another indicator, and wasn't happy. The tater was moist but had an after the taste of sorts. The brisket was all bark, and not in a good way. Hard, dry, and flavorless. The sweet tea was as weak as the sauce. A place like this thrives in areas where barbecue is unknown. I would rate it 1 star but this place has a great atmosphere and friendly service...as they serve you McDonald's BBQ. Scratch that, I'd prefer a McRib."}
{"text":"Our last trip here was disappointing. Horrible customer service and bad food. For some reason or another the girlfriend wanted to stop here again tonight.

There was a lot of improvements the food was top notch but customer service was still lacking.

We were greeted and sat promptly but then it took the kid serving us almost 10mins to approach our table and take or drink orders. He must of had many tables as he disappeared for another 10 mins after delivering or drinks. 

So we were there over 20mins without placing an order. Once the food was delivered (feast for two and catfish) a few of the butter containers had fallen into the beans and Cole slaw. 

Not sure why we were presented our food in that fashion as we have no idea who/what last touched the butter containers before they ended up floating in our food. I guess its not that big of a deal since we would have touched them to open them up but it just wasn't the proper way to serve the food.

The girlfriend pointed this out and we received an apology and were asked if we wanted him to take it away and we declined. Like I said we would have touched them to open them so we kept our feast.

We asked for a to go box and containers for sides and the waiter was prompt in bringing them out but must have figured we were going to hand carry everything individually as no bag was brought to carry three items.

Since they did bring the Catfish Fingers back and I was told they will be there for a while (they ordered new menus) I will be back!"}
{"text":"Bar-be-que is good in small doses since the flavor kinda gets overwhelming. 

Lunchtime called upon my friend and I and we were promptly seated and asked if it was our first visit. They ended up letting us try all the sauces they had and even gave us a bottle of our own ! They also offered punch cards and locations map. 

The food was flavorful and amazing. I couldn't have asked for a better satisfaction of my ribs craving after ordering a full rack of St. Louis ribs and chicken with rice, fries, apple somethings, and mashed potatoes."}
{"text":"First time here with my boyfriend and we had a great experience ! Service was fast and friendly and the food was delicious! We ordered the feast for 2 and it was indeed, a FEAST lol. They gave us a good portion of food.  It was enough for  2 hooked up plates for each of us.  Most def recommend it! The ribs were my fav"}
{"text":"I waited a long time to try this place, but I wish I didn't. 
My husband and I went about thirty minutes before closing to place a to go order at the bar. Eric, the bartender on duty was extremely friendly and upbeat. He got our order in right away and checked on us while we were waiting. 

The food was delicious; he had the full rack of ribs, while I enjoyed a barbecue combo plate with brisket and catfish fingers. The meats were adequately seasoned and the portions were generous. 

We definitely will be back to enjoy more of the menu!"}
{"text":"Our dinner was pretty bland. The brisket tasted boiled. Meh! 
The corn bread was great!"}
{"text":"I was not really expecting too much from a BBQ chain restaurant.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I used a groupon for 20.00 worth of takeout( I paid 9.80 with a promo code). 

We got 4 rib bones, coleslaw, a loaded baked potato( upcharge), beans and a dinner salad.  Also came with a corn muffin( loved that, very moist).  Everything was packed very well for takeout.  We enjoyed the meal in our hotel room after a long boring drive from LA."}
{"text":"First time here!!
GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE...
Hostess was awesome!!
She greeted us right away, and gave me and my wife great recommendations.
We got platter for two and it was delicious. 
Definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"I don't really care for Famous Dave's but I found myself here a couple of weeks ago for a quick dinner. 

I ordered a bowl of baked potato soup and shared a few bites off of my a brisket plate. The food was nothing special but the service is the reason for the lackluster review. Refills were hard to come by and our server disappeared for minutes at a time. 

I don't see myself returning to this location, in particular."}
{"text":"We spent the night in Las Vegas with a friend. Rather than cook we ordered a platter and picked it up and was back at the house in time to watch the game! The staff was friendly and our order was ready when we got there. If you are on the Southside and hungry for BBQ go to the Blue Diamond restaurant and get your grub on!"}
{"text":"The Shrimp appetizer was nice. Lots of shrimp, and flavorful. To my Taste anyway! I had a half rack of ribs and they were word class tender, fall off the bone wonderful. 
The server was delightful, and it is worthy of a stop if you are in need of BBQ - with six different sauces, there is at least one for everyone, and two or three for me!"}
