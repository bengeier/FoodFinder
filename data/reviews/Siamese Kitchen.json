{"text":"If you are looking for original thai food, you have to come here and it very peaceful. They have the best nuddle soup, it my favorite dish here. The waitress so nice and friendly. LOVE THIS Restaurant :)"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Good prices. Nice balance of flavor and heat. Have not had a bad meal, have just had to wait a little longer than I wanted. Plan to relax and you will be fine. Actually would give this place four stars if they could be more consistent on time. Good service otherwise. Maybe food that tastes this good deserves some grace. Maybe I should be able to embrace the moment of peace it offers. Maybe I should go to the Fast Food place down the street if I am in such a hurry. Maybe...

{"text":"Awesome food, perfect size lunch portion and very inexpensive. Went with my daughter who lived in Thailand for 3 years. Authentic and spicy. Had the Panang Beef Curry and Thai Iced tea. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"hotter than most.  they speak a little english here but nothing is lost in translation . great Tom KA Gahi spicy and sweet great stuff. prob the best panang in town"}
{"text":"I have eaten here many times and never been disappointed. 

Yes, it is run by two ladies that work hard so if you arrive and it is full the service might seem a bit slow but when your turn comes it is well worth the wait. 

My favorite dish is the Pad  Kee Mao with Beef, I am addicted. I used to order it \"spicey\"but I get the same great flavor without the pain when I get it \"medium\". 

The red curry chicken is great, too. First time I came here that is what I ordered and I got it \"hot\". It was so hot I didn't come back for a couple of months however I did finished every bit of it.

The ladies that run this place are delightful.

For those who don't like it too hot they do serve things very much toned down and there are many dishes that aren't hot at all.

Yes, the strip mall is old and the parking lot needs some new pavement but I imagine that is a factor in the reasonable prices.

Try their homemade coconut Ice Cream!!"}
{"text":"Sandwiched between a tattoo parlor and a biker country music bar, this place is great for Monday night take out (or dine in) in your jammies (at least, that's when I usually go). I imagine great people watching possibilities on a Friday night. The food is generally yummy and freshly prepared, with the exception of a few menu items (like the sweet and sour chicken, which is some kind of strange deep fried thai/chinese hybrid that doesn't work for me).  It is family owned, and the woman who is usually the server is really friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Why aren't more people eating here! The food here is great --by far the best Thai food I've had in the Valley.  It rivals the top-notch Thai food you can find almost everywhere in Seattle.  We had the yellow curry with chicken and it was absolutely delicious, creamy and spicy. The panang with beef was also good--way better than Malee's at Desert Ridge before they closed. We ordered both dishes with medium heat. I'm happy to say this was American medium, not Thai medium--so it was exactly the heat level we were expecting. Spot on. I'm a fan, although I have to say that if you're looking for ambiance with your meal, this isn't the place.  The staff is very nice but the interior could use a bit of rehab. Nothing fresh flooring and a coat of paint couldn't fix, however  We will definitely visit here again, albeit perhaps for take out."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, and both times have been great. They actually make the food spicy when you ask for it and it tastes authentic. I've had the panang curry and the papaya salad, both of which have been fantastic. I can't wait to try their pad thai next time"}
{"text":"Keeping this short and sweet:  The food here tastes like the food you get in Thailand.  Authentic enough for you Phoenix?"}
{"text":"The prices are about the same to other Thai food places in the area but the portions are, to me, noticeably smaller. The food is really good taste wise but I almost feel cheated with the portions. Great staff; the restaurant is small and old, so what?? 

Worth going but I would be going for lunch because of the price. Although, they do not serve soup with the lunch like most other Thai places either. Oh well, rather have a little bit of good food than a lot of gross food."}
{"text":"It is the worst Thai food ever!  I got sick and vomited after a few bites of I don't what kind of chicken & vegetables entree they gave.  Yeah, it's cheap but the quality and expiration date? who knows.  I ended up in emergency, they told me I had food poisoning.  Bad experience!  I will not go there again unless I want to lose 10 pounds in a hurry."}
{"text":"My mom is from Thailand and whenever she doesn't feel like cooking, we come here for the authentic stuff.  The prices are reasonable, the food is always so good and the waitresses take care of us! Plus the country bar next door closed down so it's much more pleasant for dinner! Yay!"}
{"text":"The yellow curry we got was very good and very spicy for being medium. We were happy with that. The service was very friendly. The Pad Thai however was the worst Pad Thai I have ever had. It had a very weird sickening sweet/sour taste. I hate to think of it, but I think something in it was rotten. I hope it doesn't taste like that normally. It also had HUGE pieces of green onion. I'm talking a 2 inch piece of green onion. It was weird. The worst thing about the place was the stupid hick bar next door. I feel so bad for the restaurant owners. It isnt their fault at all and i don't blame them for this.  It is just not fun to have your table shaking from awful country music during dinner. I wish they would start the Ho down after the restaurant closed."}
{"text":"This IS the BEST THAI in Arizona!! I have been coming here for Years. A friend of mine that lived in Thailand for many years turned me onto this place years ago as the best, most authentic Thai in AZ. And I have never been disappointed!
This place is run by two ladies and the owner is the chef. She is in the back whipping up each order individually as ordered and applies the heat as directed. She is amazing! Yes, there may be a little wait for the food BUT it is never too unreasonable for the quality she puts out. And It is only Her cooking as ordered. This is not a chain where food is waiting to be microwaved as ordered. So, back off on the wait complaints. 
Siamese Kitchen Rocks!!!"}
{"text":"What a gem this place is! Unassuming and simple. The food is fantastic!!
Very good flavors in the chicken Ma su Man. It was mild but had extremely wonderful flavor!
The wide noodle dish was packed with veggies!!
Cheaper too than another Thai place close by. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I've been going there since 2001. Every time I talk about Ma'am's food, my mouth waters.  I've tried most items on the menu. My favorites are Yellow curry chicken,  tom ka gai, satay chicken, Thai beef salad. My Mom, who doesn't like most peoples food, loves going there."}
{"text":"I will start off by saying I LOVE spicy food, but seriously! This was the spiciest Thai food I've ever eaten. It was too much and killed all of the flavor. I ended up throwing away my leftovers because it burned so bad. I still gave it 3 stars because I'm sure you can tell them to make it mild and it will be good."}
{"text":"I know, I know, I've been a Yelp absentee for eons. Well, I'm back - and will get cranking with my reviews soon. I'll kick off with my lunch today at this here Siamese Kitchen. 

I had a hard time finding this place - I just knew from Jon's review that there was a Thai place at the 43rd Ave & Olive intersection and that was about it. The window outside was painted \"Thai & American Food\" which is immediately dubious, but there were no burgers or grits on the menu so I don't know where that \"American\" came from...

Anyway, I'm being long-winded. 

Jon was right - this place IS tiny. Inside is extremely casual decor with the obligatory giant portrait of the Thai king & his wife (I guess, uh, that would make her queen), and other random faded 70's posters of Thai landscape . 

The lunch specials are ridiculously cheap - all under $5: veggie spring roll, rice, and entree. I got the chicken red curry & asked for it spicy. For once these people actually took my request seriously and actually made it spicy (and my spice-o-meter is set pretty damn high) so no sheepish requests for chili sauce had to be made. Good plus.

Taste of the curry was good and, like Jon said, upon first appearance, the servings seem puny, but by the end of the dish, you're completely satisfied. The wait took a while, but not too long. I wouldn't call this amazing 5-star Thai food by any means, but it does make for a fairly decent lunch option on this lame side of town...

3.49 stars."}
{"text":"I had the Pad See Ew with beef ($8.95). It was delicious! Slightly sweet but mostly savory. The beef was slightly overdone, but otherwise, it was great! I would definitely come back here. Decent price, great service. There was a little bit of a wait for my food, but I didn't mind. I think it is a family owned restaurant."}
{"text":"My family and been coming here consistently for 3years now!!! Never ever disappoints... so delicious!!! So spicy!!! So authentic!! The staff, the food, the environment is what a mom & pops restaurant is all about!"}
{"text":"We stopped in with my parents last night after a Thai friend had recommended it to us. Even though it looked sketchy from outside and in, their food was excellent. The people were friendly, the food came promptly after ordering, and the service was attentive. The Pad Krapao Mu was spicy and delicious, the green curry was coconutty and blended perfectly, and the Pad Thai was.. interesting. Highly recommended, it's a gem!"}
{"text":"This place is NOT good. It smelled inside and the food was by far the worst Thai I've ever had.

We usually go to Taste of Thai, but when I saw this had more reviews and a higher rating, we decided to give it a try. What a mistake!!! The pad thai was gross, the spring rolls were disgusting, the green curry was ok but the tom ka ghai was horrible! 

Yelpers really let me down on this one! I think it is recently under new management, so maybe these reviews are out of date, so steer clear!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Glendale area --
And the staff and chef are wonderful people. Definitely recommend them."}
{"text":"Who would have thought that such a hole-in-the-wall spot in a semi-suspect location would have such great food?  Luckily, my fellow yelpers pointed me in the right direction, since I never would have stumbled upon this gem on my own.

Since I was dining with a group, I was able to sample a wide variety of items, and my stomach was so happy for the variety.  The many appetizers I tried were delicious.  I particularly enjoyed the papaya salad, Thai toast, and fried tofu bites.  For dinner, we had the veggie curry and pineapple fried rice.  Both were delicious, well-seasoned, and made perfect leftovers the next day.

Despite the drive, this has moved into the top spot on my Thai take-out list.  Be sure to be patient if you come with a large group - there is only one server and one cook.  However, if you don't mind a leisurely pace (and perhaps refilling your own water), the food will make you smile!"}
{"text":"Food is amazing. Unfortunately, the owner must try staffing the place to avoid labor costs?? Our \"25-30 minutes\" estimate on take-out turned into over an hour. This was a theme on a holiday weekend night as we watched other people waiting just as long (if not longer) for their take-out and dine-in orders. We decided we will stick to Siam Thai from now on."}
{"text":"I really should explore not-so-attractive strip malls more because some of them have hidden gems like this one. After you are seated by the gracious hostess, you will have the challenging task of choosing from so many tempting dishes listed in the menu. The food is VERY flavorful, the curries really rich (watch for the heat, though; even \"mild\" packs a respectable kick), and the prices are great! Four and a half stars, probably going up to five with future visits."}
{"text":"We absolutely love this place!!! They make the best tom yum goong EVER! We used to eat here all the time when lived close and never had a bad experience. By far our favorite Thai joint in AZ and we have tried several others. The pad thai is amazing as well!"}
{"text":"We were seated immediately and courteously. We were a bit close to the door and with the constant opening and closing, it was a tad chilly.. The waitress was pleasant, attentive, and apologetic about the wait for our food. The food was great (thai spring rolls, mee grob, tom kha gai, red beef curry, and seafood chili sauce). The leftovers won't last very long. We will return."}
{"text":"We drive over an hour to get good Thai food. We've tried so many places even in Scottsdale and they just don't compare. If you want excellent soup not made from a pretty made base, this is your place. Keep in mind the owner is the only chef so be prepared to wait or call in at lease 30-45 mins before you pick up your food. Anyone who appreciates 100% authentic Thai cuisine will understand the wait. It's worth it every time! We will never eat at any other Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"Really good food! Pad thai - hot, egg soup, and red curry. Server was very nice. She even brought our take home to our car when we forgot to take it with us on the way out."}
{"text":"Coming here for more than a year. Had i remembered to write my review before latest stop it would definitely have been 5 stars. However....

8pm - phone order: Red Curry (medium) and Panang Curry (medium). 30 minute estimate given.

Got to the place and picked up food. Dinner order curries are almost the same amount as lunch. Containers are less than half full. 

Anyways the problem was when opening at home we noticed that the two curries were identical. (Panang suppose to only have green peppers). Both  had jalapeños. They were beyond spicy. Never have they put jalapeños in their curry. I have gotten other dishes that usually have jalapeños but not curries. My wife could not eat it so she called and explained the situation. Stating they might have gotten the orders wrong. The one lady(the only ever in the front)tried to explain that medium spice always has jalapeños. Bologne! I myself get thai hot and it has never contained jalapeños nor the medium spice. Anyways she agreed to remake it. We go and pick it up. However....

She tries to explain again why it had jalapeños. But then it was explained to her that both curries were the same. She said they werent but once she noticed both had same vegetables she backtracked and seem confused....the cook was extremely mad as we were lying. We then get our food and ask for fresh rice. The lady states that it has curry(i was serving myself at home before i realized they gotten. Order wring) and if we could just reheat it at home. Whaaaat?!!! That was just unreasonable. Their mistake we deserve fresh food all around. Anyways the dumbest and most shocking statement she said \"if it didn't have sauce then i could..\" and my wife cuts her off saying \"you would take it back and serve it to someone else?\" At that point she realized what she was implying and just stayed quiet. The cook slammed the rice container in trash and served another plate. 

Why didn't we ask for our money back? Because we knew it would be tough battle with this lady. And we loved the food.

Sadly we were loyal customers and our favorite thai place. BUT this last incident just leaves a bitter taste, and tells us to find another place. 

Business tactics here are bad. If they are willing to take back rice that was served to someone else what else can the be doing behind closed walls."}
{"text":"Very hearty, fulfilling Thai food. Though I feel a bit heavy after eating here, I just can't seem to choose another Thai restaurant! Their coconut curry soup is by far one of the best in Az."}
{"text":"Gentle people, delicious food, AND excellent prices.  You can find more expensive food but you will have a hard time finding better Thai food.  I drive from North Phoenix past a half dozen other Thai restaurants to eat here."}
{"text":"I had never eaten Thai food before, and I was taken here for dinner after helping a friend move all day on a Saturday.  It may have been that I was starving and was depleted of all my energy, but the food here was great!!

The folks I was with swore up and down this place had some of the best Thai food in the Valley, so I let them do most of the ordering (I wanted to go the safe route via sweet and sour chicken, but they objected wholeheartedly).   

We ordered a variety of items, (appetizers, soups, and main dishes) and shared between the 3 of us.  It did take a little while (even with us and only one other party seated), but I was told this is because all items are cooked fresh when you order.  The lady serving us was very friendly, even when my friend was giving me crap about ordering medium spicy and not hot .  

It was all very good (If I attempted to spell some of the dishes I'd end up offending someone), I kept eating long after my stomach said \"no more\", since my taste buds were saying \"keep going!!\"  

I will definitely be returning very soon!"}
{"text":"small hard to find little spot at the corner of a strip mall.  The atmosphere for the restaurant is very quaint and no frills about it.  The server was super nice and the place was really clean.  

Food- order the tom yum noodles soup. was asked if I wanted it spicy and sure enough I did asked for it to be med hot.  I also asked for no peanuts and fish ball.  when the soup came I was floored.  Med size bowl filled to the brim.  The pork was super tender and the noodles where awesome.  and the spicyness was just perfect!

Staff- although the server was super nice the place is super slow so hopefully you are not in a hurry and chat with friends!! I believe they only have one cook on hand but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"I had to lower one star because they've recently changed their recipes! They no longer have duck when we come in, and their curry recipe is completely different. It used to be my absolute favorite Thai place to go to, and now it's a good Thai place. The curry is still good, the food is still good, but it's no longer completely exceptional. We still go, and we still like it, but we really miss the old recipes!

Best Thai food in town, hands down! My husband and I love Thai food, and while other places in the valley are good, NOTHING beats Siamese Kitchen. 

The curries are to die for, creamy, wonderfully flavorful, and deliciously spicy. If you want to take baby steps with the spice, ask for a side of chilli and fish sauce. This will add the spice without killing the flavor. 

The chicken  satay is the best I've ever had. Large pieces of peanut chicken, perfect sauces... we get this every time we come! 

The lunch specials are dirt cheap, very filling, and just as delicious as the dinner serving of each dish. 

Finally, get the coconut ice cream! When they have it, it's fantastic!"}
{"text":"So here's how it went:

Been here over an hour.  Got apps at 45 minutes. Still no dinner. 

They turned the Open sign off an hour before closing. 

Only 1 person out front one in kitchen. 

Someone just came out and said and i quote:  \" they want good food they wait. Too bad.  \"

Finally got dinner about 1h20m in. 

Masamun curry was ok. I tasted something sweet though which isn't what I'm accustomed to. Beef was not good at all. 

Wife had green curry.  The broth was VERY thin and it didn't taste very good.  

I have a friend who's Thai and raved about this place so we didn't go to our normal spot.  We won't be back.  

We probably would've given them another shot if not for the irretrievably rude person who said 'too bad'.  

1 star for not charging us for the 3 beers my wife had."}
{"text":"Wow this place is bomb. Try their Thai soup it's amazing. Glad I stopped by. Place is very clean. Lady who works here is welcoming. Will be coming back. And I recommend you check it out too."}
{"text":"Love this place! Best Tom Yum Gai soup and so very kind and friendly! Stuck in a little strip mall you wouldn't guess the food would be so delicious. Definitely worth the drive for me."}
{"text":"Wow....just had a wonderful meal with friends tonight. Had Noodles with Thai basil and pork...to die for. Pad Thai was excellent too. I would get spicy next time . What a gem. Great food, great service and very reasonable. Modest setting, but who cares with food this good. Curry was good too!"}
{"text":"Keep in mind - ***** - \"Woohoo! As good as it gets!\" - IN ARIZONA

Being that my Thai grandmother's blood runs through my veins, and it's all I had growing up at home, I'd like to say that I'm a pretty credible Thai food yelper.  For the past MANY years, this is the only Thai restaurant that my parents will dine in. 

Their menu is pretty eclectic since they offer everything from stir-fried noodles, noodle soups, stir-fried meat/veggie dishes, and fried rice. I had the pad Thai the last time I went to pick up take-out about 3 weeks ago. It was WAY spicy, but I asked for it. Despite the streams of sweat that were rolling down my temples, the noodles were delicious! My other favorite dish here is the pad kee mao which translates into stir fried drunkard. This dish is best spicy as well. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area and love authentic Thai food."}
{"text":"Short Story.

Just edible and far from Best Thai but with very nice service.

Long Story.

Started with Fried Won tons. It was nice that they seemed free of grease and were seasoned nicely but they might have been slightly over cooked since the filling was very dry. It was a little disappointing but not a big deal.

I ordered the Pad Gra Prao. Their spelling, it's spelled many ways but is spicy basil dish that is a very common Classic Thai Dish that is very simple to made as it's basically Fish sauce, garlic, usually Chicken, 1-2 bunches of Basil, Thai chili's and Oil. Better Thai Places do offer this dish Thai Style topped with a crispy fried egg.

My dish lacked basil as it only had maybe two basil leaves in the dish so it didn't have any basil flavor. It was very high on the heat level but had a terribly strong jalapeno flavor to it. (See Photo - those are not bell peppers they are jalapenos! ) The next taste was sugar. This dish was very very sweet. Honestly it was so sweet it could be good on pancakes or ice cream. The dish might have had fish sauce in it but it wasn't enough and lacked that funk flavor that balances the flavors and makes the dish delicious. Lastly the chicken was on the dry side, still edible but dry.

Many people do say this is one of the best Thai Places in town so I don't know if it was an off day or maybe I ordered the dish they do least well?

{"text":"I was looking for a Thai restaurant to try. It being my first time trying Thai food, I looked to the Yelp community for suggestions. There near the top of the list was Siamese Kitchen.

I went here on a Friday night and it's this quaint hole in the wall place. There was practically no one here when we arrived and we were able to pick or seats. The waitress was super friendly and we ordered the Thai tea (highly suggest because it's sooooo frickin good!) Her knowing it was our first time having Thai tea, she took the liberty of bringing us waters in case it was too sweet for us.

We both ordered the Pad Thai since it is a popular dish and was highly recommended. And for good reason! The chicken was tender and the shrimp plenty. There was chopped peanuts on top and normally I'm not a fan of nuts on my food but I felt it complimented the meal perfectly. It was a huge portion and I couldn't even finish my meal! The waitress was just perfect. She didn't hover which can make for an awkward dining experience, but was also attentive to our needs.

This being my first Thai food experience, I would say I'm rather pleased with how it all went. I am very much looking forward to future dining trips here with a new groups of people so they can experience the deliciousness this place has to offer."}
{"text":"My co-workers drag me here every couple of weeks.  Don't get me wrong, it's a nice place, nice owners, kind-of what you expect from a hole-in-the-wall place.  I'm just not a Thai type of guy, so I wouldn't necessarily suggest this place on my preferred list.  I usually go for lunch and get either Beef and Broccoli or Sweet and Sour Chicken.  Both of which are not really Thai food but pretty good, the food is always very hot (temperature) and I haven't had anything that I didn't like and my co-workers seem to think it's one of the best Thai places going.

Just another comment on the location, it's in a scary shopping center and the place is pretty run down looking, as my co-workers say, don't come her after dark."}
{"text":"This is by far the best Thai restaurant outside of LA and Thailand (in my opinion). My whole family and I have been going here for over ten years. Their beef noodle soup, squid salad and beef salad are amazing. The service can be slow during the lunch rush but all of that can be overlooked when the food is this awesome!"}
{"text":"My husband and I come here every Tuesday. This food is absolutely wonderful! Some of the best Thai I have ever had. The prices are even better. Would recommend to anyone without a doubt.!!!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

This place is definitely outside my 5-mile radius.  In fact, only the idea of seeing some of my favorite Yelpers could entice me to make this hour-long drive from hell.  But if I do end up in a hell that requires me to do nothing but drive across town over and over again, I'm glad Siamese Kitchen is along the way.

Very small restaurant with only 2 people running it made for understandably slow service, but they worked incredibly hard.  I did feel somewhat badly for anyone outside our group (well technically I was outside our group arriving so late) that picked that night to dine at SK.

Now on to the food.  We shared spring rolls, chicken satay, and green curry.  The chicken satay was just okay.  The chicken was just chicken, and I thought the peanut sauce was lacking.  It wasn't rich enough for me, but neither is my husband, so I can't complain too much.  The spring rolls were nice and crisp.  The green curry was delicious.  Since I just like a little heat, I ordered it mild thankfully.  I guess that's true Thai mild, since it was more like medium.  But full of flavor!

I would definitely recommend Siamese Kitchen if you find yourself nearby!"}
{"text":"This is by far our favorite Thai place in Phoenix. They get the spice and portions right. The only downside is they are stingy with meat and chicken. I always order chicken pad Thai and my husband order beef basil and our order have 3 to 4 small pieces. Mine is mostly noodles and his is mostly sauce! I always order take out so I am not sure if this is why we don't get our meats. We have tried other places but this is by far the best."}
{"text":"One Liner: Delicious food after getting a tat

Food: (scale of 0-4) 3.2
Apparently Phoenix isn't just about Mexican food. This thai place offers quite a few delicious soups and noodles. Even the fried rice was good. The restaurant is sandwiched between a tattoo parlor and a biker's bar. It may not be the most desirable area to be in, but the food is definitely rewarding. Be careful on the spicy or hotness scale. It can get pretty spicy.

{"text":"Let me preface this by saying that I could eat Thai food every day until I die without a single complaint. Favorite. 

This place was...fine. I went at lunch and ordered the pad thai to go and the yellow curry chicken. The meals come with an egg roll, but I couldn't eat more than one bite. It was so heavily fried that it literally dripped oil. Not my style. I tasted the pad thai, and it, too, was very oily. The flavor was fine, but a little bland, and there was not much in the way of chicken or shrimp. The portion was, as others have mentioned, noticeably smaller than most thai places...but a reasonable serving size none the less. 

So, the curry. 
I just...I can't even...ugh. It was so good. Thick and creamy curry, al dente carrots and peppers, and perfectly tender potatoes along with sliced white meat chicken. Guys, It was so good. I hate that the portion was so small--I typically expect to have leftovers for at least another meal. It was only $6 though so I certainly can't knock it. 

The overall experience was fine, the place was clean and the food took a long time to come out but that's worth it for the fresh food. I'm torn, because the curry is worth going back for but I'm not so confident on the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"Love this little hole in the wall. Consistent, fresh. Had several items from here all good. Must try the Thai pineapple shrimp curry, oh my it is delicious. Thai toast is a great appetizer."}
{"text":"I still love this place and it maintains its rank as my favorite Thai place in the Valley. 

A couple of helpful notes I wish I could do a better job remembering: they open for lunch, close for a break and then re-open for dinner, so you may want to call first to make sure they'll be open when you get there, if it's not normal lunch or dinner time; and, they are closed on Sunday. 

The hospitality is genuine and unobtrusive. The Thai fried rice is really delicious -- Other than that, see my original review for more menu suggestions."}
{"text":"I've been eating there since 2001. Same owner/chef. Delicious Tom ka gai and yellow curry. My mother, who didn't care for anything other than her own cooking, absolutely loved it. Whenever I travel, I always look for a Thai restaurant for comparison and nothing ever comes close to Ma'am's cooking.  Best Thai food in the valley."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a authentic and cheap Thai restaurant, you should try this place out. It seems this place has been around for years or even decades. I heard lots of stories about there is usually only one cook, cooking all the meals and she's still the same one until now. They really do have great Thai food for a decent price. Service is quick. Their lunch special is about 6.00 for a one person meal. Try it!"}
{"text":"My favorite Thai place in Arizona!  I love there number 29.  It comes with veggies, shrimp, chicken, and beef in peanut sauce.  My sister loves there number 57.  They are unbeatable and their service is always great!"}
{"text":"Oh my god! This place is delicious, definitely authentic Thai food! And yes, to the negative reviews saying there's a huge wait, there can be a long wait due to the fact that there's only 1 cook- the owner. She's amazing & dedicated to making sure her food is authentic & good! I fully believe it's worth every second to wait! Great prices, a little cheaper than other Thai places I've been to!"}
{"text":"WOW, Best Thai I've had in years, Run down neighborhood and strip mall but absolutely fantastic food."}
{"text":"I really need to bump up this rating.  I've been back several times, trying something different each time.  Sometimes medium spice nears my limit but all the food has been great.  Last time I was in it was pointed out they have a smaller portion lunch menu so I don't have to pig out in  the middle of the day.  The woman running the front end knows I don't take lemon in my iced tea.  I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Yassssss! Thai food heaven! The food was awesome and price isn't bad at all. The only downside is it took forever for order to come out and there was almost no other guests there...actually just one other table. I'll still go back though because maybe it was a one time thing. All the food we ordered was delicious."}
{"text":"A nice little restaurant in Glendale!

Parking: Super easy and plentiful. This is in a strip mall area, near Jus' Country and a barber shop.  

Atmosphere: very quiet, though we went once during Christmas season, and cheesy Christmas songs were playing the whole time.   

Service: Pretty decent and friendly. The wait staff are attentive. 

Food:  I have had the vegetable curry several times. It is delicious and creamy with a sneaky spice.  Also, I can specify which vegetables to *not* include in the curry, and they make everything tasty and fresh.  My friends who eat meat have enjoyed the chicken and beef dishes that they have ordered. 

Drinks: I have only had water and green tea."}
{"text":"Get ready for a sappy review...this hole in the wall has a special place in my heart. When my mom had cancer she'd get a craving for Siamese Kitchen and send me with our own glass dishes (bc she didn't like the to-go styrofoam LOL and they would gladly pack my mom's food \"to-go\" in our very own dishes. I always thought it was so sweet that they would go the extra mile to please a customer. 
Since then I feel like they've gotten busier with being on postmates and such but I still enjoy their red curry soooo much. Their beef salad is delicious as well. My only caution is that when you order on the phone be sure to ask what the \"hot scale\" is...for a while I was ordering a level 3 spiciness thinking the scale was 1-5 and getting home only to find it was barely spicy at all. I called and asked if the spicy level was 1-5 or 1-10 and they told me it was sometimes 1-5 and sometimes 1-10. This made me chuckle big time. I guess it depends who's taking your order. But be warned! It's got all the quirks of a hole in the wall but awesome taste and it's a family favorite of ours because of the special memories we've created around their food!"}
{"text":"This has become our \"neighborhood\" Thai place, although its not really in my hood - but totally worth the drive.  I normally get the pad see ew (sometimes known as Drunken Noodle).  It is very good as are their curries.  Everything tastes very authentic and thankfully not \"Americanized\".  We ordered their catfish last night which wasn't up to par - but nothing to get salty about.  They also have lunch specials that are well priced."}
{"text":"There aren't alot of great things about living in Gilbert, but working at the Metro Center...but Siamese Kitchen would be one of those things. 
I haven't explored the menu too much..I stick to my favorites; Red Curry & Phad Thai..both are delicious every time I order. 
For the demented crowd like myself,,,,get the food \"thai hot\"!!  It never fails...a few bites it and your mouth burns, you start to sweat, and your nose runs like a busted faucet..it's paradise!!"}
{"text":"My friend and I re-discovered this place this summer, after one of the other local Thai places we were going to eat at was closed that day.  I was hesitant at first, as I had been to Siamese Kitchen many years ago and was not that impressed.  

Boy, am I glad we did!  It is under a different ownership from the last time I was there, and it is now a fantastic Thai place!  We liked it so much, that we ate there twice a week all summer long...now we go once a week almost like clockwork (going today!)!

We have had everything Thai on the lunch menu, and they are ALL very tasty, and nowadays, the price they ask can not be beat!  Great staff and great service as well!   They've won me over for sure."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in Arizona! I love this place. Its the next best thing to actually being in Thailand! I love the pad siew, thom kha gai, and lard naa. The prices are low and the service is really nice too!"}
{"text":"Great food and reasonably priced.  They will spice up any dish to your desired level upon request.  I love their Panang!  And they have great cream cheese won tons"}
{"text":"Want authentic Thai like you were in Bangkok?  This is the place in Phoenix to find it!
Tried 3 dishes:  one soup made with coconut milk, one papaya salad and one pad thai--all mild--all excellent.
Every single thing here is made TO ORDER per customer! Every item is super fresh and purchased that day!  We got this information straight from the wait person who works there.
A really hardworking Thai woman does all the cooking for everyone, and she is really great at it, too.  Her food is authentic and not some Americanized version of Thai which doesn't need played with as so many place do (thinking Malee in Old Town Scottsdale).
I'll definitely be back here.  Love it!  I felt I was sitting at a cafe in Thailand again...sigh...so many memories."}
{"text":"Love this restaurant. I am very particular with Thai food, but this place has a delicious take on the beef larb. I've taken at least three people to this restaurant at different times and they also enjoyed it. Some of my friends are repeating customers. My one friend said the pad Thai was delicious and reminded her of back home. I usually get the Thai tea (creamy) and the coconut ice cream. I think the portion size is reasonably priced and all of the food is authentic. I actually come here like every 10 days. The waitress and cook know my order before I even ask. They even remember my name and telephone number when I call in my order. Great service and a calm atmosphere. Feels like home."}
{"text":"We have enjoyed eating at this establishment for the last 10 years now. I believe they have the best Tom Yum Gai I have ever eaten. If you have a desire to eat some delicious Tai food and finish with authentic Coconut ice cream, this is the spot."}
{"text":"It's a small place with a large amount of flavor.  I've eaten here twice and loved it both times.  The soups are great and full of flavor.  Be careful when saying how hot you want it, I tried medium and it had some kick."}
{"text":"We love this place.  It is a great neighborhood spot.  We always get take out because of our little one, who loves the chicken satay with peanut sauce.  I have tried a few different things but I always go back to the pad kee mao noodles.  They are so yummy and fresh, and I order the medium plus which is just spicy enough for me.  The staff is very friendly.  If I had one complaint it would be that the food is never ready in the time quoted, but it's always fresh so I really don't mind."}
{"text":"I'm addicted to this place ! The papaya salad , beef salad , curry & pad Thai are so yummy!"}
{"text":"*UPDATE*

The country bar next door is out of business so no more loud crappy music! Bonus!"}
{"text":"Pretty good. The waitress was very nice and conversated with everyone. The food came pretty fast."}
{"text":"Hidden gem in a crappy strip mall. Inside is worn but clean and wait staff very attentive. 

Lunch special is perfect amount of food with an iced coffee. I tried pad Thai and added ground Thai chili - careful, a little goes a long way. 

I will be back."}
{"text":"Yum.  Darn good curries, they seem to be thicker and creamier that other Thai places here in town.   The green papaya salad was good, simple and just spicy enough, although when I've had it at other places they usually add shrimp to it.  No big deal.

Talk about a shitty strip mall location, man, this place rivals Pizza a Metro for good food in a nasty location.  I suggest going to this place in the daytime, or pack some heat."}
{"text":"I love this place.  Best Thai restaurant in Phoenix....even better than the Thai I have had since moving to the Bay Area a few years ago.  When we come back to the Valley...a trip to Siamese Kitchen is a must.

I used to work close by and would eat lunch there frequently.  My wife would drive across town...I think she was more into the food than hanging out with me.  The food was always fresh, delicious and incredibly flavorful.  

The prices are great, the quality is great and the two ladies who run the place are great."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai done from scratch ....their thai spicy is the real deal vs the typical spiceless  that is common at places marketing & disguising themselves as \"Authentic\".  The Beef Kao Mao had me sweating for lunch, I relived my spiced out tongue w their deliciously tasting  coconut ice cream.
Prices are  reasonable & portions are just right, server was on top of things & very responsive."}
{"text":"I went here last night. I was going to take a to go order but the server said there would be an hour wait with all the diners and go orders they already had. So I figured it must be good because this is not exactly a fancy place or even easy to find. So i said well can i eat here. I ended up ordering a hot pot of the tom kar gai- not sure if that is spelled right. And i also ordered the pad thai. I did wait a long time for the soup which i was warned so i wasnt upset. It was very good. When the pad thai came i took a few bites and had the rest for home. It was also very good. Everything seemed super fresh. And while it did take a while, it was worth it. And the server had on like one of those blue schol uniform polos. She was just so sweet and ran around the place like crazy. Glad i found this place."}
{"text":"Good homestyle Thai food, the owner cooks everything herself so expect a bit of a wait. The food though tastes about like what it does in Thailand, a rarity to find in Arizona. The spice level is also closer to a Thai rating than most places so order accordingly 5* larb is actually Thai spicy and delicious whether you order as a 1 or a 5, has the spicy, sour, salty taste it should. Another of my favorites is the noodle Tom yum soup, made as in Thailand this isn't the same as Tom yum soup with noodles but more like a flavorful pho soup very hard to find here. The grapow (basil) dish is also pretty good though she is a bit heavy with the black pepper. The flavors being closest to Thailand you will find in the area as evidenced by (yes I'm a nurse) how many regular customers from Thailand you will see come in from Thailand while you are waiting for your food."}
{"text":"I came to Siamese Kitchen with 19 other Yelpers and we plowed through much of the menu and overwhelmed the kitchen but they were gracious and didn't mind when I jumped in to help clear tables and keep the food moving.

Wow, that was a run-on sentence.

Overall the food was really good and the service was good as well.  They did have a hard time keeping up (as most restaurants would when 20 people order at once) but were good natured about some of us jumping in now and then to bus tables or refill water.

I really enjoyed the Yellow curry although I would order it hotter next time.  Dottsy ordered her pad thai hot and the leftovers came home with me...too hot for most.

All of the dishes I tried (7-8) were nice and flavorful.

I will keep Siamese Kitchen in mind for lunch when I'm in the neighborhood, good stuff and good prices."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was a kid I love everything on the menu such a great place."}
{"text":"It's a nice small family restaurant. Family owned and family run. They have a lunch special for about five dollars, comes with a small portion of the dish you order, rice and a egg roll. 

Today we ordered the Pak-kee-mao (check spelling) with medium spice. One thing we look for when eating is spice levels; we were pleasantly surprised to see how well they spice their foods. There are four levels, mild, medium, hot and Thai. For the beginner, mild is no joke. Today we got the medium and it offered just the kick we were looking for in our dish. Many places skimp on the basil but it offered a nice flavor that helped enhance the spices.

Their Thai tea and Thai iced coffee was delicious. As expected the iced coffee was strong in flavor but it was delicious. I recommend it fully."}
{"text":"I came here alot when I use to work down the street! Great place and great food! Only thing bothers me is just they take forever to bring the meals. Oh and love there thai ice tea!"}
{"text":"Best hole in the wall Thai place in Phoenix. Everything came out piping hot. Papaya salad, beef salad are full of flavor. Had a wonderful experience here and they're very friendly."}
{"text":"Nothing to look at on the outside, but the food, wow. Came at start of dinner service and waited for the chef to walk in  15 min later, with the fresh seafood, veggies for the night . We had the fried rolls, pla saam ros catfish with spicy sweet n sour , chu chi shrimp in red curry, and drunken noodles that was like eating fatter chow fun noodles.  Cooled down with Thai iced tea."}
{"text":"A lovely little Thai restaurant.

The food selection was great (most other Thai restaurants I go to have smaller, less varied menus), the service was immediate, the preparation and serving of the food was fairly quick (though not worryingly quick -- they definitely cook the food all the way through), and it just tastes great!
I've had better Thai food elsewhere (outside of AZ), but this is hardly a bad choice at all - it's definitely one of the better Thai restaurants here.
What made me give this place 5-stars was the service.

Our server was very kind, friendly, understanding, personable, and accomodating.
We enjoyed our food and talks so long that we stayed past the restaurant's closing time. We felt awful for realizing that too late, but we felt absolutely welcome at the same time: We were never once rushed or pushed or encouraged to leave. We felt like we could stay there for as long as we wanted, and they wouldn't mind. The kindness and friendliness still held by our server even after closing hours was extremely gladdening.

If I lived in the area, this would definitely be a restaurant I'd frequent!
Highly recommended!

P.S. Their Thai Iced Tea is *definitely* good - a wonderful complement to their spicy foods (How I normally rate Thair restaurants is how well their thai iced tea goes with their spicy foods)."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai spot! Comparing to other Thai restaurants this hole in the wall is as authentic as it gets. I love spicy food! Most places when I order Thai Hot the food isn't as spicy, here you get what you ask for. I always order the papaya salad, tom yum soup w/seafood, and waterfall beef. The food sometimes take awhile to come out, because there is one person in the kitchen. But the taste and consistency is worth the wait."}
{"text":"I love this place! Im half Thai and I know Thai food! Most Thai food places are way to Americanized. The food here is as authentic as you can get. If you know your Thai food they will even cook something for you that's not on the menu. That to me, is amazing customer service. Everyone is always friendly and I've never had to wait long for my food. It always comes out hot and tasting fresh! No frills needed for this girl....just great food and this place delivers on that!"}
{"text":"This place takes foreeeeeeeever to serve food!! Appetizer alone which we ordered as soon as we sat down took close to an hooooour! Then the main dishes? Another 20 mins?! Sad thing was, I came in with the family hungry, and craving some curry. Kinda lost our appetite by the time the food came.."}
{"text":"Really good, authentic thai food here.
Definitely be aware that the spice level is on the spicier side, which is the case with most thai places, but this one especially.
The thai tea here is a little creamier than others......SO good!!!

What really set this place apart was the service; absolutely top notch!"}
{"text":"This is the epitome of a hole in the wall and I love it.  I have had several dishes and each one of them were fantastic.  The papaya salad is one of my favorites and I am also a great fan of the Tom Yum Gai and Squid Salad.  The service is super friendly and the prices are reasonable.  I am afraid of the future of Siamese Kitchen because on my last visit they said they may close it down, which would be such a tragedy. I'll keep my fingers crossed."}
{"text":"This is the most delicious Thai food in the whole Phoenix!!! Love the Pad-Kee-Mao and the Beef Salad!!! The owner is also the chef. Very authentic Thai restaurant."}
{"text":"I really liked it. I had the Veggie Curry lunch special which was a super deal! The food is great and the prices are so cheap. Lunch special for $5.95, Wow! The server was so delightful. I'll be back. I can't believe I left without ordering my fav kind of coconut ice cream though. Oh well. That just means I have to go back. Warning- I like spicy and the Medium is very hot! Almost too hot so make sure you have an iron gut or are a spicy superstar if you are going to go hot. I believe part of the day was the lovely company. Great company plus good food makes my first New Year Yelp review Yelp-errific!"}
