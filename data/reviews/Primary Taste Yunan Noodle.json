{"text":"Terrible service . This is not my first time eating here. I know their food was served on a not equal level quality every time. But normally it doesn't test bad. This time they bring me a really salty spicy soup. And when I told them and asked for a little bit more original soup, they told me that they cannot do it. I was told to buy another meal since they do not sell soup alone. Or they can add water in my soup. And during the lady from the cash talk to me, she is keep \"making \" my meal with a bowl of hot water which is total disgusting for me. I just end up with let them take it away and paid for it since they didn't feel like something wrong. They just let me seeing my friends eating on Christmas Eve. Never gonna be there again."}
{"text":"The perfect place for warming up on those cold winter nights.   As their name implies, they serve Yunnan noodles... with a twist. They serve you a pot of boiling (really hot!) soup separate from stringy noodles (well made!) and a bunch of veggies (lettuce, corn, black fungus, etc.) and meat (raw sliced beef, ham, chicken wing). The main thing you end up picking is your soup base. My favourite is the \"primary taste tomato sauce rice noodles.\" The soup is delicious and I don't get particularly thirsty afterwards (no more than usual) even though I drink most of the soup. This makes me think that there can't be TOO much MSG! The decor is nice and the waitstaff are average.  Overall, I recommend this place if you're craving noodles and a good soup - especially on those cold winter evenings. I will continue to come back."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  We ordered the regular Yunnan special rice noodle and the coconut curry rice noodle special.  First off the soup was nothing to write home about.  It was bland, oily and inconsistent.  The food came at almost 20 minutes apart between the two orders and 10 minutes in we had already gave them a friendly reminder that we had not been given the second set of noodles.  The price was acceptable for the area, being $8-$10 for a single bowl of noodles.  However, the service needs a lot of work."}
{"text":"Pretty nice for a Yunan noodle place. The chicken side dish goes well with any broth in my opinion. As others said prob not a good place for a lot of people since they only have one big table. But other than that I find the food service fine. Prices are definitely reasonable, regular price for a meal in my opinion ."}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to eat here on a complete whim (the restaurant used to be the location of a Korean restaurant my family and I used to love, but they relocated). This place is similar to hot pot and ramen in prices - when they give you your dish, you get a bowl of hot steamy broth, soup ingredients and raw meats (to be cooked in your soup), and noodles on the side which you add gradually to your soup. The noodles have the right consistency of chewiness without being too hard and the broth was very flavourful. I would try this place again!"}
{"text":"I like this place. I like their concept of bringing small sides and having you add it yourself. I found their sides to be really flavourful and delicious - especially the pig ears and the pork bones. The noodles are chewy and have a nice texture and the broth has a nice flavour as well. Only downside is that their menu is really small and they don't offer much of anything else.   Service is typical of a Chinese restaurant, I'd come here again for the food."}
{"text":"I came here on a hot day and I was sweating throughout the meal.  The AC was weak.. It was so hot that I couldn't really taste my food to give a rating."}
{"text":"Came again tonight. First time in a couple of months. Still delicious. Most customers are Mandarin speaking. Had the tomato broth soup, sans fishballs. Really good soup base. Two slices of raw hotpot pork were delicious and tender even after going into the hot soup for more than fifteen minutes. Noodles are still a really good, slightly chewy texture. Steamed chicken with chili oil is also really good. Slightly salty, but highly addictive. The servers remind you to put the hotpot pork into the soup first, to ensure it cooks. Still a perfect meal for a cold day or when you feel like you're coming down with a cold."}
{"text":"Noodles are nice and chewy, love how you can customize the ingredients you'd like to add to the soup. The soup base is a bit bland and over compensated with salt though. Price is reasonable."}
{"text":"A small restaurant, I love the cold dish, especially spicy chicke?service the food very fast.  I give  five stars because when I leave and I forget my phone, the lady keep my phone until I came back."}
{"text":"Literally decided to walk into a restaurant we have never tried. Will admit that we had no idea what we were getting into or the type of food that was served. The menu had a small handful of options for noodles and then some appetizers or snack dishes.  Ended up ordering what seemed to be the original noodle and a curry noodle. Food was mediocre at best and we didn't really know what to do with it as the food came within minutes with everything in a separate small dish and a bowl of hot soup base. At the end of the day, the portions were small for the price compared to any other noodle or ramen place. Neat to try once as it's sort of like a mini hot pot noodle dish where you just dump all the little dishes into your hot pot of soup."}
{"text":"An OK noodle place that offers something different from your regular noodle restaurants.  The overall experience could be better though.  Pros: A different take on noodles  Cons: Not much vareity Tables are too small for what they offer  As many have said before, this place replaced a Korean restaurant from before.  They did not change much as the seating is pretty much the same.  When we came in, we told them were 2 adults and a baby.  They would not give us the bigger table and instead gave us the tiny table normally for 2 people and put a chair at the side.  This place mainly does one thing and one thing only.  They offer 5 or 6 side dished but their whole menu consist of 10 or so items.  They have noodles with different broths that come with either pork or meat balls.  The different take part come in that they give you a bowl of broth and a bowl of noodles that come with serveral side dishes that you add yourself.  We ordered two of the and a spicy chicken side dish.    Here's the problem with the smaller tables they have. The tray and the bowls everything comes with take up a lot of room.  Having two orders and side dish made it virtually impossible to have enough space.  When your sitting at the bigger tables, it's no problem but when you're at these smaller ones, you spend the entire meal trying not to knock anything over.  It was a little frustrating not to mention trying to feed a baby at the same time.  The food itself was fine but it was completely overshadowed by the high wire act we were trying to do while eating.  Talking about food alone, this not a bad place.  It's the other parts of dining experience that will make you look elsewhere,"}
{"text":"Rice noodles, with an array of items to add to the broth.  Broths arrive in Korean ttukbegae dishes.  I had the hot and spicy seafood which was very spicy - but not unbearably hot.  The broth was a bit fatty but tasty.  The shrimps, mussel, crab and scallop were fresh, but the star of the show for us was the VERY FRESHLY home-made tofu with onion (cold salad).  Spouse had the primary taste noodle (non-spicy).  This is very regional Chinese cuisine and leaves you feeling satisfied.  Totally different to the wheat noodles in Northern China."}
{"text":"I had Hunan noodle on finch and Kennedy.. this place is same as the good Hunan noodle. I love all mixed up the topping and noodle with mild soup..I really love this place.."}
