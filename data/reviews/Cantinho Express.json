{"text":"Great chicken place.  After trying them you won't be satisfied with Benny's, Au Coq or St Hubert. The chicken is grilled & their spicy house sauce is yummy and they've recently added a beef burger to their menu. The prices are reasonable, portions are generous and service is quick, I just wish they offered delivery. There's parking in front and out back."}
{"text":"This is my go to place when I don't feel like cooking supper or leaving the house to go out and eat. I love the charcoal chicken with piri piri sauce and their potatoes which are a choice of several sides are great. However they recently changed them to a different flavor which I don't like as much.  Despite the change to their potatoes its still really great take home food when I don't feel like cooking."}
{"text":"Just like the parent restaurant, except counter service unlike O Cantinho on Jarry, which has table service. It has a similar menu except that they also make sandwiches.  For those that don't know Cantinho, it's a Portuguese restaurant. Charcoal grill for all proteins, very rare to find. Spicy or not, your choice, I like spicy. The sandwich platters are huge, potatoes or fries or rice with salad. Bring your appetite.  Not sure about alcohol at this location, as I was there for lunch. Highly recommended.  Forgot to mention that the chicken is the cheapest in town."}
{"text":"1.) They charge extra if you eat there even though you are the one to bring your food from the counter to table (no service) even the water/drinks is self served 2.) We ate here and the chicken was absolutely dry and hard to peel off the bone 3.) Poutine had 4 tiny pieces of cheese under what looked like scraps of left over chicken 4.) Staff are incredibly rude.. this is what really hits it on the head. You have 0.4 seconds to say your order (felt like the soup nazi).  The way they call your number is similar to being a prisoner of war.. yelling the number harshly and if you literally don't put your hand up they yell even louder.. but with every ounce of anger. 5.) I got accused in front of everyone for not paying a certain item.. then showed my bill and all the employee said was \"well it's not on my order receipt fine\".   Service + Food is crap. I'd give it a 0 star if possible.    **** please note this place went down big time.. all other reviews are months/years old."}
{"text":"Plus besoin de ce rendre sur le Plateau ou au quartier St-Michel pour manger du bon poulet portuguais! Le repas familial (avec poulet entier, frite ou riz et une grosse salade) vous coûteras 20$+tx . J'ai goûter la poutine au poulet portuguais! Excellent!!!! Service super rapide et ils font la livraison aussi dans le hood! :)"}
