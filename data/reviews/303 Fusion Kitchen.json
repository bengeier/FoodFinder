The food was fresh and delicious. Our server even ran outside to pick fresh basil for our dishes!

If you're in the area definitely give it a go!"}

{"text":"Update March 2015: best Taiwanese beef noodle soup in town. 

They are expanding Taiwanese dish in the coming weeks; currently the food quality is good and price affordable. Oyster pancake is amongst the most authentic in North America (trust me I tried many of them in Vancouver, Toronto, LA and Vegas). The other outstanding dish include beef wrap and sweet potato/yam fries."}
{"text":"The best Taiwanese cuisine on the city, absolutely addicting morsels of amazing Yassss"}
{"text":"Service was great (owners are very nice), pricing is on par with everything else in Calgary at about $10 per entree and $5 for the bubble tea. The food is more Taiwanese than Chinese and is as authentic as it gets in Calgary. Restaurant was small and cozy, definitely a hidden gem. Everything on their menu that I've tried is good but if you're looking for recommendations, the beef onion pancake wrap is delicious (more of a starter) and the beef in their spicy beef noodle soup is very tender. However, it is a spicier broth though."}
{"text":"Order from here for dinner today, I got chicken and sir fried veggies, it wasn't on the menu but they made it anyway. (Plus)
Unfortunately the veggies were very over cooked, almost mushy. But I also got the beef wrap and found it very yummy. My co worker got the honey mustard chicken and said it was amazing. Will I order from here again? Absolutely, May have been an off day. And to be fair everything besides the chicken and veggies was great. And very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I have to regretly inform that it seems like this restaurant is no longer in business... I went by the other day and it has news papers all over the window. I don't see any cars anymore.
The sign is still up but I haven't seen an \"open\" sign up the window.
So I guess no more reviews to be added with nice yummy pics to go along with it...."}
