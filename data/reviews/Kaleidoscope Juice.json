{"text":"Hot mess of a location. Big menu hanging on the wall of food items and such. After a few mins of reading I walk up to order and am told that they don't make the food, it's whatever pre-made food is left in the fridge.   Decor is totally random. Feels like a furniture store in some parts. In orders like a cafe in SoCal. But the juice itself is tiny. There's more room dedicated to the liquor shelf than the juice. Weird bad place."}
{"text":"So I gave them another try. First thing I noticed was the depressed looks at the marginalized women faces that work there. Then the one \"white boss\" so to speak got up from her laptop and did not even say hello or ask if I have any questions (which I did!) I fended for myself, made the best attempt to educate myself and paid. Not a single thank you or even a smile. My heart ached for the women cutting up all the vegetables and hope that they are treated better than I was as a customer!  Why I am really writing this review for is the mess in the store! Boxes everywhere, a mess. Looks like a tornado ran right by it.  I know you're growing and this location probably doubles as the manufacturing plant but that's not an excuse to have a mess. Clearly a health violation!"}
{"text":"Michelle is the best bartender ever!! What an awesome chick. She was so nice even though she only had a day or two left, when most people wouldn't care at all. Great service and friendly as can be. 5 stars."}
{"text":"I died and went to coffee & fruit/vegetable heaven today.    I read (mostly) all the reviews. It seemed like people's only complaints were a) the price and b) the friendliness of the employees (or lack thereof). And to preface my review, I will let you know that I have neither of those complaints after visiting them.   I was greeted with smiling and welcoming faces. They asked how I was and let me wander around without bugging me. I can't stand being approached 3 times in the span of a few minutes asking if I need help. Maybe some people like that sort of thing. I don't. I spent some time admiring the spiritual gangster selection of clothes. Super cute. I will be purchasing items in the future. I made my way back to the counter and inquired about the bulletproof coffee I read about on the yelp reviews. I let her know I was vegan and she left out the grass-fed butter. I went with the 12oz as I wasn't sure how much I would like it. I'm sort of a coffee snob. And I'm a black coffee kind of gal but let me tell you something: GET THIS COFFEE. And get it in the largest size they have! Seriously. Order it and don't look back. I wasn't even looking for a new favorite coffee and I found one. What do they call that? Serendipity? It was wonderful.   I also ordered an acai bowl. I'm unofficially on a mission to try out all the local acai bowls and THIS one? Omg. It's perfection in a bowl. The granola is out of this world as compared to Nektar juice bar. Their acai bowl is good, yes, but THIS one? I'll be dreaming about this one and planning our next meeting ASAP. It's that good.    Now what originally drew me to this place was the organic juice selection. You'll read people's reviews complaining about the prices but you get what you pay for people. Go buy and juice organic produce and let me know how much it costs you. Now you want someone else to do the leg work and prepare it for you? They have to make money, people. Realize what you're getting and stop complaining. If you want conventional produce and a cheaper price, hit up your local Jamba Juice. In the meantime, Kaleidoscope will be serving up delicious juice to the organic produce lovers who know and appreciate what it takes for a piece of organic produce to even carry that label. Quality. Quality, quality, quality.  This place is a gem. It's no wonder they're successful and have multiple locations."}
{"text":"Phoenix finally has a juice bar!! I've been dying for something like this and now that it is finally here I can't say enough good things. Alexandra, the owner, is so knowledgeable about all things juicing and truly cares about her customers. Every time I've been in she makes recommendations based on what I'm looking for.   In addition the the awesome service, I love the juice here. Not only is it fresh and flavorful, but there is such a variety that I am constantly finding myself ordering/trying something new each time I come in. Every single thing is so delicious. I am a huge fan of the quinoa salads--they come in huge portions and make for a perfect lunch when paired with a juice, and you will still have some left over for later."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE. Immortal machine is my favorite. They usually have some vegan goodies too which are yummy. Workers are chill and helpful. Highly recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast / lunch spot with every beverage type (outside of beer / liquor) you could want on a work day. Super friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"Stopped by to have an acai bowl. It was pretty good but overpriced for the size it was. Was $10. Very small compared to other places. I wouldn't come back, I suggest you go somewhere else where you can get more for your money. Other than that, the store was adorable and had cute nick nacks. Would probably try a smoothie there."}
{"text":"Bulletproof coffee all the way!! Acai bowl is pretty good. I haven't tried the juices on account of I think they are overpriced. 5 stars based just on the coffee though!"}
{"text":"Great place to find especially if your out and about and you need a break. The staff was enjoyable , plus my acai bowl was awesome! I can't wait to bring my husband here. I know my return trip will make his day"}
{"text":"I was diagnosed with thyroid cancer coming up on 10 years ago. Two years ago I went for a second opinion at they Mayo Clinic and they found some additional involvement and have been on a little bit of a roller coaster ever since. In January I decided I wanted to make a change. I wanted to change my focus to nourishing my body instead of fighting my cancer. Loving my body, instead of wasting energy hating this small part of me. I was interested in starting juicing both for occasional cleanses and weekly supplements, and I was lucky enough to stumble upon Kaleidoscope. I am addicted. I love so many of the combinations they have, and I love the energy I have drinking them. And my next Mayo appointment 2 months after making this change, which has also included adding meditation and Bikram Yoga to my life, my tumor marker came down significantly! Each bottle is made with the best ingredients, the best process and so much love. I can't thank Kaleidoscope Juice enough. I recommend them to all of my family and friends. :)"}
{"text":"Cool vibe, and close to the Convention Center. That can be a plus if you're there for a conference, but if you're just visiting and looking for a good juice spot it might be a bit much to see so many folks with conference lanyards.   I only had a juice, so I can't speak to the food (although it looked good as it was being delivered). I ordered whatever sounded good to the woman taking my order, which turned out to be a 32oz juice called \"the walk-in\". It was refreshing, tasty, and as I was able to watch the juicers at work, all of the ingredients were clearly fresh."}
{"text":"Delicious, fresh and nutritious! I really enjoyed lunch here and there was something for the whole family. The veggie juices were tasty without being too sweet with fruit juice, the salads outstanding and the sandwiches amazing. Wish we had this closer to home."}
{"text":"Save your money. This place is terrible. After paying $13 for two small juices, one was served room temp and half full with foam. When asked if it's normally warm received a \"yeah - if you want it cold you need to ask for it over ice\" and then when I asked why it's cold she said it's because it's just strawberry juice mixed with water. Gross - paying $7 for water that's cool. And then when I asked to speak to a manager I was told \"she'll be in sometime next week\" um... okay. Cheaper water found at McDonald's  ;)"}
{"text":"Never thought I could get so excited about juice but this stuff is amazing!    The unique combinations of fruits and vegetables blend so beautifully that every bottle is a treat to drink.  It's hard to pick a favorite but I am amazed at how delicious the wheatgrass lemonade is.  It's clean and tasty...not grassy at all.  Do something great for yourself...check this place out!"}
{"text":"I was on a business trip and tired of business trip food. This was a short walk from my hotel and worth the trip. I got the Acai bowl, a latte and a fresh juice. It all was delicious! This is one of those places that you pay a little more for but while enjoying your splurge you find yourself repeating wow so worth it :)"}
{"text":"Will definitely go back again.  I didn't know about this place and just stumbled in wanting something to drink after being out in the sun all day.  Drinks aren't like anything else you find and they are healthy also.  Nice atmosphere also."}
{"text":"Just finished Anton's Spinach.  AWESOME.  I regularly do my own juicing so really can appreciate the quality of their product and the fact that I didn't have to go thru all that work.  If you don't have a juicer, just buy it from Kaleidoscope!"}
{"text":"Addicted.  Pure, organic, cold pressed, no BS.  The stores are very nice and so are the staff.  I only wish it wasn't so pricey, I don't really understand the $$ rating here.  Won't keep me from going back though :)"}
{"text":"Well.....was in Phoenix and was jonesin hard for a legit juice bar.....Being from San Francisco, I was ready to ratchet my experience down a notch.   Well, all I have to say is \"no sir!!!\". Kaleidoscope hit the spot. I had the Trinity and the headed back the next day and rocked the Rebirth. Both were awesome. If my San Franciso juice bar owner wasn't so sensitive about his juices, I'd take him a Kaleidoscope menu and and show him how real juices are done."}
{"text":"Kaleidoscope dtphx is awesome! Rachel is the best, always so friendly and cheery, you can't help but be in a good mood after leaving. She also makes a great coffee! My new ritual of a bulletproof coffee first thing every morning is the best way to start my work day. I highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Products and people with integrity... what a concept!!! These girls are doing so many great things that they deserve nothing but success!   I think juicing can get a bad rep sometimes for not being ultra tastey, but kaleidoscope juices are all very well thought out using only organic ingredients! Also their Thai Tiger Salad is amazing!   On top of the products being excellent, they compost all of their waste from the juicing! BIG PLUS!    All in all one of my favorite spots to visit! Staff is very knowledgable, friendly and can help you whether you a seasoned juicer or just trying something new!   Go get a juice, it will make you feel energized!"}
{"text":"Kaleidoscope's new location is great! Pick up a juice, smoothie, coffee, peanut butter protein cookie or wheat grass shot all from the bike up window. All products are organic, and made with lots of love! The staff is helpful and attentive to your personal needs regardless if you just want a pick me up in the form of juice or coffee, or a life transforming cleanse.   Go try it! It may just change your life..."}
{"text":"The food and juices are very good, but i can't start my weekend without an immortal smoothie (with espresso).  it's the only way to live."}
{"text":"Food and coffee were yummy.  The kids demolished a gluten free muffin and wanted more.   Great customer service.  Staff went out of their way to make my guy with special needs a lemonade that he'd drink.  We'll go back next time we're in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"It's a good healthy juice/smoothie spot. However, my concerns were: 1) location is not ideal. It's tucked within the optima sonoran buildings next to their gym 2) customer service is very average 3) prices are a bit high considering the content of the menu and the selection   I would recommend it for healthy smoothies crazes, but not an everyday spot to get your routine drinking!"}
{"text":"So glad to have found this place! Definitely the best place to get fresh juice in town. I highly recommend the wheatgrass lemonade, but all of the flavors I have tried have been delicious. The juice is always fresh and it is always served with a smile. 5-stars!"}
{"text":"Kaleidoscope is quickly becoming a regular stop for me, now that I found out about all kinds of food allergies that I have! Everything at Kaleidoscope is super fresh, and gluten free. I love their juice combinations, they totally beat anything I have come up with at home in my own kitchen. As they should, the staff are total pro's and really know their products. It's a fun environment, healthy, and quick! Absolutely worth your time and money."}
{"text":"Kaleidoscope juices and salads have changed my life!  Made from the finest, purest organic real vegetables and fruits - they are delicious and they help you feel better, healthier and more balanced throughout the day.  The cravings disappear as well as the pounds the more you drink!  Highly recommend and nice to know the owner is committed to improving the health of her customers!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to Kaleidoscope and I guarantee that it won't be my last! The service is extremely friendly and the inside is cutely decorated with plenty of seating.   I ordered a pitaya bowl and a bullet proof coffee. If you come here you must order the bullet proof coffee, it is absolutely amazing! The flavor is smooth and creamy even in the absence of added dairy and you get an energy boost incomparable to regular coffee. The pitaya bowl was also delicious although I will admit that I have had better ones elsewhere. The size is plentiful and if you add protein you will walk away quite full. The granola on top was very good, the fruit tastes fresh and they added a really delicious jam sauce on top instead of honey like most acai/pitaya bowls have at other places. The only reason for four stars is the price. It is very expensive in comparison to other places in this genre but I suppose that is to be expected for Old Town Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Solid açaí bowl. Not the best presentation, but the taste was great. More options would be nice. Their smoothie \"shake\" was good as well. Had some serious banana chunks that didn't get all the way blended... but once again, great taste. Cool spot with nice decor and plenty of seating."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place. And the Strawberry Warrior Milk maybe one of the best things I've ever tasted. I also got a few coldpressed juices. I really enjoyed the electro-lite, especially in this heat. Great drinks, great food, great vibe and more importantly great company."}
{"text":"What a great little place filled with a warm energy that is calmly invigorating. The service, the products, and the atmosphere are all superb.   My faves so far are the myriad of juices, their version of bulletproof coffee, and the Acai bowl. I can't wait to try the chai."}
{"text":"Pricey but the food is good and filling. As a visitor staying at near by hotel, was disappointed that the kitchen is closed on Saturday.  Acai bowl is amazing and filling. Salads are fresh. Street tacos are delicious with fresh guacamole. The guacamole should be a stand alone menu item. Staff is friendly. Would return when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Not a bad place little on the expensive side for what it is but they do use very freash ingredients and it was delicious great place for after a work out"}
{"text":"We randomly walked into the place while wandering through Grouchy's Coffee next door. Lucky for us we were looking for a quick and delicious breakfast place.   We ordered two breakfast burritos, both of which were tasty, but simple. However, the kicker was the salsa! It was so spicy, which I loved, but also chunky and smoky. I really hope it was homemade because if it was, I'd love the recipe. :)"}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I was only here in Arizona for a couple hours but needed to get a juice and smoothie. The prices here we reasonable and great as well as all their options are very accommodating. I got a build your own juice and a greens universe. I was very glad with Theo service and I would recommend this place to any. It's very trendy and the food here is worth it"}
{"text":"Love this place! Has the freshest tasting juice that is cold pressed and knowledgeable people to help you with a cleanse or just a kick start to a healthier life!  I spent quite some time there the other day just talking with Alexandra!  I came in just before closing and wanted to start a cleanse the next day.  They were basically out of juices so instead of having me come back when they opened the next day, she told me to just come back later that night when they were done juicing and she would help me pick out juices to make a great cleanse!  Needless to say, all of their juices taste amazing!  It's kind of pricey, but definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Great Juice! My husband and I just got back from LA and discovered a wonderful juicery/restaurant called Kreation. We came home bummed that we didn't have one here. We did a little research and came across Kaleidoscope. We both did 5 days cleanses, the juice was great. The staff was super helpful and friendly.   Favorite Juice: Hot Yogi or Anton's Spinach"}
{"text":"I took an item from the 50% isle and was charged full price and the clerk claimed it was misplaced there and didn't offer to refund for the mishap"}
{"text":"Ordered the Pitaya bowl (acai and dragon fruit bowl) which had delicious granola, nuts, fresh banana, and shaved coconut. The smoothie part on the bottom was outstandingly refreshing and tasty. Not too sweet, which is a huge plus for me. I ordered through Ubereats and it was delivered promptly and in good condition (still cold/frozen and looked delicious). Would definitely order again!!"}
{"text":"Kaleidescope is the best! Healthy cold-pressed juices with fresh ingredients (including turmeric) and gluten free snacks (even waffles). Good prices, quick service and awesome staff. The new manager Rachel is very friendly and knowledgable. I heard they are going to start cooking fresh to order meals for breakfast and lunch next week. Much better tasting juices here than other spots like grabba green. It's a cool place in the same location as the cartel coffee lab downtown."}
{"text":"Home away from home. Here on business from the east coast. Cool fresh hip vibe with high quality product.  Check it out"}
{"text":"The Immortal Machine smoothie is awesome!  Is it worth the wait and the price?  Absolutely not.  The employees here need to have their morning boost of caffeine prior to coming to work. Today when I walked in the store had one other customer waiting for their order and only one employee. The employee came over took my order went and finished the other customers order then proceeded to take orders from the string of customers that began coming in. Finally, other employees slowly began to work. One of them worked on my order. 20 minutes after entering the store I walked out with my smoothie. If you have all the time to wait and don't care about customer service this is the place for you. If not, find someplace else."}
{"text":"Anyone ever try to order here from UberEATS and find it randomly unavailable throughout the day?? Ordered yesterday and it was unavailable to order for 15 minutes then it was \"open\" again. Not sure if it's their restaurant or an UberEATS issue but I love ordering from here so I don't have to load my kids in the car, and it's so dang difficult!   Good food and great place to get some fresh juice."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I am an absolute sucker for a good smoothie bowl, and kaleidoscope has exactly that.   I've been disappointed by a sub-par bowl more than once in my life, and I am grateful that this was not one of those. The homemade granola gives the right textural contrast to the smoothie (I had half pitaya and half acai).   For coffee, I suggest the bulletproof with collagen added---I usually need sugar and cream in my coffee, but it was easily palatable without it."}
{"text":"The Optima locations is one of my favorite spots. Great for meals, meetings, meet ups, dates, lunch, dinner. Expect to pay a bit more for the conscious food/drink/smoothies/juice with better ingredients. I do from time to time and love it. Definitely recommend the peanut butter protein cookies. The bulletproof coffee is my go to. Get the large, hot bulletproof with the coconut whip. Hit up the one off 1st Ave for a different location that's easier to pop into and head out. This one's great for hanging out."}
{"text":"LOVE this juice, my only regret is finding it while on vacation and not being able to continue drinking it!  Alexandra was helpful and really well spoken on the different benefits for each juice.  I was fighting a cold and had several immune boosters and Gold juice, each made me think of liquid sunshine.  You can't go wrong with these high quality juices- just don't think it is like a Jamba Juice or chain...this is pure juice and herbs/spices.  Long story short, after daily juicing it seems my cold didn't have a chance."}
{"text":"About six months ago I decided I was turning 32 this year, and I wanted to be in the best shape of my life by really getting serious and strict with my diet. This kaleidoscope is a great help for when o don't have time to prep my own meals. Their selection of natural and healthy food alternatives is amazing. Plus their fresh juices and coffee is amazing as well. Plus the day time manager Kandance and staff's amazing and positive vibes make for an energetic and awesome atmosphere."}
{"text":"The best place to get amazing pitaya bowls !!! Everything taste great and natural. I like their $2 tea and beagle GREAT DEAL for great taste . I work across the street so im here all the time! Always send customer to this place!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite healthy food & juice bar in town.  If you want high quality & healthy food that tastes great, this is the place to go.  The service is prompt and very friendly.  Every cold pressed juice they make is spot on for taste and so healthy! The Avocado Toast, Chia Seed Oatmeal and Acai Bowl are out of this world!   Please open-up more locations across the valley.  I would eat here every day if I could.  The environment has a great vibe and energy too.  If you want to feel good about what you are putting in your body, go here."}
{"text":"Were do I even begin! This is by far got to be the best place downtown to eat! Not only are you greeted by some of the most friendly beautiful people you will ever see in your life, but they have the most variety of smoothies juices and food it makes it impossible to choose. I used to be a big fan of Jamba Juice till I realized how sugary and gross it was in comparison to the amazingly tasty things your are able to get here. I highly recommend checking it out you won't regret it !"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! I go here 3+ times a week for a juice and the occasional bagel or pitaya bowl. They are affordable and pretty fast. My favorites are The Walkin and Conquer the World (I add pear to this one). Today I tried the bagel with egg & cheese and it is as delicious as everything else!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Fresh cold pressed organic juice, tasty healthy fast causal food and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Half off juices offered daily, great baked goods selection and a stellar staff. You won't regret the best acai bowl in town!!"}
{"text":"What a great patio to hang out and meet friends. Feels more like family!  Love it here"}
{"text":"Great place with a very pleasant staff.  The smoothies are good and the selection of healthy snacks is great as well.  Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"Loved the food and atmosphere.  They told me the Medicine Broth would be kind of weird... But I loved it. I added some hot sauce and it was delicious.  We talked to the employees for a while... They were very friendly. Samantha was great."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved this place it was so nice and honestly really aesthetically pleasing!!"}
{"text":"Conveniently located next door to Cartel, started the morning off right with a latte and an amazing green juice. Friendly service, great suggestion of the Vanessa."}
{"text":"I enjoyed it.  People say its pricey but its the same price virtually for a combo meal at a fast food place.  Id come back here for sure especially if you want something on the healthier side."}
{"text":"Went in here today for the first time and fell in love. Met the owner I believe who runs this business with her mom. Such a sweet lady! We bought 2 smoothies and they were amazing. Also purchased a hand made crystal necklace (quartz I believe) and it's amazing. Purchase a cute baby pink spiritual  Gangster shirt. Love this place and will be visiting again soon!"}
{"text":"Best chocolate mocha I have had. Great service by the Hollywood Brunette."}
{"text":"This place is a little piece of heaven. Everything I had was incredible and it's reasonably priced for the quality. You'll find coffees, juices, all sorts of body nourishing things that I haven't found anywhere else. The girls that work here were also really sweet. Highly recommended if you're in town... your body will thank you."}
{"text":"The Vegan Burrito with added avocado and MUST use the vegan chipotle mayo, I could eat this everyday. I know because ive done it for a week and still go back for it."}
{"text":"I hate beets and always have but a friend suggested I try a beet juice for a cleanse.  I was SHOCKED at how delicious the Dusti Beet juice at Kaleidoscope was.  Maybe I like beets after all and I didn't know it."}
{"text":"Came up here for comic-con and everywhere was jam packed. So we find this hole-in-the-wall shop not expecting much, but they still managed to disappoint. I ordered a chicken protein bowl with quinoa and a 24oz iced caramel latte. The girl with the huge tattoo of an axe on her leg brings me a 16oz latte heavy on the caramel.. i tell her thats fine except its supposed to be a large, and she pours it into a larger cup and tops it off with milk. Am i stupid? The whole drink is caramel and milk now. Im blown away how i paid 19.91 for this and received trash.  The chicken and quinoa with asada sauce was pretty tasty though it was also mixed with a grip of carrots cauliflower and cabbage... very disappointed with the cost. Lastly, i decide to get some water instead, and theres no ice in it. Keep in mind the weather is 100° plus right now."}
{"text":"Great place to drink teas, coffee, or smoothies. The strawberry warrior is an entire meal. I love the breakfast burrito, protein bowls, and egg salad on toast. Everything is healthy with vegan and gluten free options."}
{"text":"You know it's illegal to own owl feathers and the fact that you are selling them is really disturbing.  I used to like this place but I am now boycotting. So disrespectful to the native culture.  Also this is a very selfish greedy not so conscious thing I would of expected more. But seeming that the staff is super fake and egotistical I now totally understand how the business owners are probs my just a stupid as their employees  Owl feathers for $4 a pop  Unbelievable!!!!"}
{"text":"Compared to competitors like Chop Shop, or even Necktar, this place was awful. The food was not good quality, and the staff was full of themselves."}
{"text":"I am in Phoenix for a conference and stumbled upon Kaleidoscope as I was walking back to my hotel last night. Besides the cute and modern Southwestern decor, their food is excellent. I had the Phoenix Scramble - a little spicy, but otherwise very delicious. Since I was a little under the weather, I also got the Flu Shot pressed juice. Amazing! I want to try them all now. If I'm ever in the Phoenix area again I will definitely be coming back to Kaleidoscope!"}
{"text":"Best juice in town! All 100% organic and all delicious. The staff is great and friendly. I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This place is so good. I got a River green juice and a salmon veggie protein bowl. The service was exceptional as well.  The girls working behind the bar were super friendly and very knowledgable.  I highly recommend stopping by if you live or work in Arcadia!"}
{"text":"Found out they have great bulletproof coffee! It's hard to find around town and with the coconut whip cream it is definitely the best in town."}
{"text":"This place is the best!  I started going here because I live close and have become a regular.  The staff is all extremely friendly and helpful.  I was new to juicing when I first came in and they made me feel right at home.    All the food is reasonably priced for how high quality the ingredients are.  I would strong recommend stopping if you are looking for a cold pressed juice or a salad."}
{"text":"First time here! Came to meet someone for a quick meeting, located at the optima. Wasn't hungry so just had a almond milk chai but it was delicious!"}
{"text":"This is literally my favorite place to go for lunch! The two girls that are always there, I believe their names are Kylie and Marika, are so nice and funny. They always give me the best customer service and some laughs to pick up a boring day! The food and smoothies are amazing too but I definitely choose to continually eat here for the amazing service these two girls provide."}
{"text":"2 stars  for customer service,  5 stars for juices and 1 star  for prices.  I must say,  the location is awesome and the place is a nice Modern little setting.  Won't consider buying from here ever again."}
{"text":"Strawberry collagen water is great. Immortal machine smoothie is has great flavor and consistency. Service is excellent!"}
{"text":"Hella healthy, this place has good vibes and good food too. Lots of beautiful people with expensive yoga pants and Notvodka shit flying around.   I'm in and out like burgers , but they actually have tables if you'd like to dine in after a gruesome workout. #panda"}
{"text":"The breakfast of champions. I love my favorite green juice. The vegan breakfast burrito is a favorite of my carnivore teenager. Great service and always informative staff. I wish it wasn't so expensive but still yummy."}
{"text":"I work downtown and have been grabbing a Starbucks Mocha just about every day until I happened to pop into Kaleidoscope - one of the best Mochas I've had anywhere! Kaleidoscope specializes in all the healthy juices/healthy options .... making it look easy to transition over to healthy :)  Thank you, Mario, for suggesting I try Almond Milk in my Mocha!! YES!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in today after my meeting. So glad I did! I was originally going to grab something quick and unhealthy, but a juice from Kaliedoscope was exactly what I needed! I took the organica juice. Great natural flavor and not overly sweet. The girls working there were awesome and helpful, too! See you guys soon!"}
{"text":"$10 for a smoothie? Ha ha! I guess I won't ever find out how good they are.  Apparently Yelp wants me to write more so this is considered a review... So, the building was cute. The staff was friendly during our short interaction and it was clear the AC worked. Unfortunately, their smoothie price is ridiculous."}
{"text":"Excited to try this place based on Yelp reviews; however, very disappointed! Staff wasn't friendly, internet \"out\" so accepting cash only OR you could leave all of your card information for them to enter the charge later; very slow, and my smoothie was meh! All for $8.50! Can't recommend."}
{"text":"Came by here every morning during my business trip, and it was awesome. I initially started going cause the juicer girl with the short hair and tattoos was really cute, but i kept coming back for the juices. All the ones i got to try were really good.  Gonna miss this place."}
{"text":"The best place for high vibe organic food, smoothies, & illuminating waters! Staff is wonderful & the customer service is out of this world. Always my go-to place!"}
{"text":"Found this hidden gem when meeting with a client in the building. I was unsure what to get but Jordanna was sure to lead me in the right direction. Not only was she an expert on the entire menu but she was knowledgeable about the nutrition and health benefits of the  ingredients. I am hooked!"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that I love Kaleidoscope's menu and have had nothing but great experiences at their 1st ave location. This review is solely about the AWFUL customer service that I have experienced over and over at the Optima location. The girls working there are rude, unhelpful and almost always mess up my order. I've heard from multiple people in my office that have tried to go there once, have had a similar experience, and then never gone back so I know it's not just me. They don't listen to your order in the first place. If they are out of something, they wont tell you when you order, they will just make your coffee with some random substitute without even asking. I've had at least 5 coffees from there that have been undrinkable because they decided to use some random milk or sweetener that I didn't ask for.  Most recently I was in there with a friend and she ordered their largest ice tea, they gave her a small, and when she asked for a large the second time the girl poured her drink into a large cup and just added ice to the top. They should seriously consider re training the people that work at that location or hiring some new people that actually care about customers."}
{"text":"The juices were great tasting, but they are all premade so you can't alter any I gradients. Also, pretty pricey at $10 for a bottle."}
{"text":"By far the best coffee shop ever! I practically live here. They have the best healthy snacks, juices and smoothies! My favorite is the mint chip smoothie and the protein waffles are a must try...they have a variety of milks for your coffees and the staff is beyond friendly! There's no better way to start my day than to grab my latte and chat with Cassidy and Jen of whom are my favs and ....grab a brownie on the way out!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I've given this place so much business it pains me to have to write this. Sure, they're a healthier option in town. If you're looking for a quick grab n' go bite (salad or protein bowl) in and out, healthier, come on in. But, be wary of the service you might experience. The workers here are bipolar. There's maybe a total of 4 employees who are just the sweetest, and I love seeing them, I actually try to go here ONLY when those SWEET people are working, the ones who actually are spreading GOOD vibes. If everyone who worked here was like those sweet individuals, I'd give this place 4 stars. But for a place who prides themselves  on \"Good Vibes\", they need to reconsider their staffing practices. I've experienced a lot of cattiness, what, just because you're in scottsdale gives you the right to be rude to your LOCAL REGULAR customers? They don't bother making relationships with locals, except.... They're super sweet to men, of course, the place is ran by females. The type of service they give is so biased as I watch them fawn over \"cute men\". Sorry guys. If you're really high vibe, show the same respect to people of all shapes, sizes, colors, and GENDERS.   Also, in regards to food options, I get more and more disappointed each time. They added a new vegan feature, a bowl with falafel, so I'm super excited. Only to find out it's filled with GLUTEN! Come on!!! Be SUPER CAUTIOUS if you're vegan or gluten free when buying food here because you'll also find the staff doesn't  know anything about the menu either. If it's not labeled, they've got NO idea. There's usually a couple things I consider for my \"cheat days\" but what's more ironic is I still have to \"cheat\" at this \"healthy spot\". Lolz.   I've been coming here since this place was hole-in-a-wall, back when the Scottsdale location was the only location, when they prided themselves on the quality of their options. I've watched as they've added more and more animal products to the menu and fail to add additional health conscious, grain-free, gluten-free, and vegan options. It's just very disappointing.    Want a another healthy spot that's just around the corner? Go to Juice Core, I think I'll be sending my welcomed support over there now unless I feel a friendly welcomed invitation back to Kaleidoscope.  Edit: P.S. I'm sorry but I really just am looking for good, positive customer service from this place. I probably will try this place once in a while still but hope this can show that there needs to be a refocus on customer service. Please and thank you."}
{"text":"This place can get really crowded really fast, based on what time of the day you go. The inside was much larger than I expected, with a good amount of seating.   I actually visited this spot twice, once in the morning to get a juice, and then second time for lunch. When I got there, they had the entire Pressed Juice part of the menu covered up. I thought maybe their machine is broken today? Since they also had enticing shakes, so I decided to get one of those. I chose Scooter Monkey. Since they are made to order, it takes a while for it to come out. When my shake finally came out, and took one sip, and I was in love. This shake was awesome and super delicious!   The second visit was for lunch. And again, the Pressed Juice section was covered up. I asked the staffs if they are no longer offering the pressed juice, and he told me that they offer the pressed juice that are already bottled up in the refrigerator.  Since I wanted to have something that is made fresh, I decided to go with their shake again. This time, I chose Universe. This one was so delicious too!   For food, I really wanted to try their Protein Bowl. I chose my bowl with chicken, brown rice, and ginger miso sauce. This item is also made to order, so I was given a number and waited at the table. When it arrived, I was surprised with how big the bowl was. And I mean HUGE! It had loads of chicken, roasted sweet potatoes and veggies. It was delicious and oh-so-filling! Loved everything I got from this place!  This place was definitely my number one favorite spot in Phoenix. I wish if this place existed in NYC..."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Bullet Proof coffee is spectacular. I'd come here every day if I didn't live in New York. This will be a must visit place whenever I'm in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Ordered a juice ahead of time, though when I got there the juice machine was down. They did accommodate and allow me to purchase a pre-made juice for the same price of the one I had ordered. Super pleased with their customer service!"}
{"text":"I have been wanting to try a Kaleidoscope juice for a while now, but I live in San Diego and I don't think SoCal is within delivery boundaries!    I was laid up in bed sick as a dog when I was scrolling through my Instagram feed and saw Antonyoga11 posted a sweet pic about a new juice bar location. I was so stoked and thought to myself \"this is just what I need to get better!\" The next day as I was feeling better I met a friend to grab a juice and check the place out. FYI: They have another location 2 blocks away where they make the cold pressed juice and they have a runner that shuttles over Flavors they don't have in the cooler, so make sure you don't make this mistake. Even if you do it's walking distance so no big.   After we found it we oohed and aahed at the awesome building and colors. I especially love the logo design. The two people behind the counter were really helpful. They explained the cold press process and what other bevys and snacks you could get there. I opted for Anton's spinach and it was deeeeelicious! Highly recommend this. Also, on the table inside they had a cute baking sheet of some goodies cut up for sampling. There is a small bar and a larger communal table for seating. Outside they had a cute patio with chairs, not to mention a walk up window which is awesome!  This place is going to kill it in Scottsdale! Next I want to try the cleanses."}
{"text":"Really yummy acai bowls. They have bulletproof coffee- definitely try it!  Great atmosphere and store front. It's bright, uniquely decorated and plenty of seating. I would definitely come back when I visit Phoenix again!"}
{"text":"Another healthy food option with very good vegan food and juices. Great customer service and very convenient location. Sick of chop shop? Hit Kaleidoscope."}
{"text":"High vibe through and through. If someone asked me why I'm such a frequent visitor I'd tell them that I don't just come in for the great healthy food, their immortal machine smoothie with an added shot of espresso or for the fact that they have one of the best strawberry margaritas in town, but for the people. I've had some of the best conversations and met some of the best people (both customer and staff) there. That's what really keeps me coming in!"}
{"text":"Wow. I love this place. A Cali girls dream. Prices are a little higher but i was more than willing to pay for what I was getting. Stopped in two mornings and a row for kambucha on tap and an açaí bowl!   The decor in the place was adorable. Succulents, spiritual gangster, definitely right up my trendy alley.   They also had a ton of healthier food options that I would recommend. Service was friendly and they had a great selection"}
{"text":"I got two juices and some cookies. The trinity juice was delicious (haven't had my other one yet.) The Almond Butter Protein Cookies were the best cookies I have ever had and I don't just mean the best GF cookie or the best healthy cookie. I mean the BEST cookie I have ever had. I'm going to load up on my way out of town so I can share the cookie love and get all my friends hooked"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!! Come here all the time now that it is so close to my work!   Every time I come in all the staff is so friendly and willing to help when I have questions about something.  My favorite juices so far: Hot Yogi, Walk In, Goblet of Life, Watermelon Flush  They also have some of the best smoothies! I love the Strawberry Warrior and The Immortal Machine.  Food: love the grab n go selection. Not always consistent in what they have in the fridge, but everything I have tried has been great!  Favorite Lunch Items: -Yo, Adrian Salad is one of my faves Also love the potato broccoli cheddar soup (not vegan), and the tomato soup (vegan) which were both soo good! -My favorite heavier lunch is there protein bowls w/ chicken.  Favorite Breakfast Items: -Avocado Toast is amazing -Also love the Gluten Free Bagels with veggie cream cheese  Definitely Recommend!"}
{"text":"Such a huge variety of healthy foods and juices! I tried the \"yo Adrian\" salad, was super tasty! And the chai with almond milk was to die for! Excellent tasty food and clean open and comfortable ambience! Highly recommend for a quick healthy breakfast!"}
{"text":"Needed a cleansing drink while in Scottsdale and got introduced to Kaleidoscope.  Wonderful quality and experience!  The product is the best and the staff, led by Alexandra Maw, is amazing.  What a knowledgeable resource!  You must try it.  Please support a great thing...."}
{"text":"Happy to say that they have now added sandwiches, protein bowls and salads which makes this an actual place to grab lunch instead of just a smoothie. Also, it seems like the staff is making more of an effort to interact with customers which is nice.  Additionally, they still sell great smoothies, juices and they even now have a selection of their own shirts and hats to go along with the Spiritual Gangster attire they've always carried.  Kaleidoscope has definitely earned a 5 star rating!"}
{"text":"Kaleidoscope Juice is hands down my favorite place in Scottsdale. After coming in the first time, me sister and I were in love. Let me just tell you about how amazing it is there. The first time we came in, we ordered the avocado toast and a pitaya bowl as well as a tea and a coffee. Everything was absolutely amazing. The girls working there were so sweet and friendly and accommodating as well. They did a wonderful job a recommending options on the menu as well. Considering we had such a positive experience, we came back the next morning and got more avocado toast and once again, it was amazing. If you're ever in Scottsdale and want to enjoy great food in a relaxing environment, kaleidoscope juice is the one for you. I can recommend enough."}
{"text":"Such a cute little space to grab a bite to eat or study.   When you first come in, you order at the front and then find a table to sit. There's plenty of room! I decided to get the pitaya acai bowl and it was delicious! For those who don't know, pitaya is dragonfruit. There were strawberries and bananas. Definitely a healthy breakfast!  It's a shame that I found this place on my last day in Phoenix. Bonus? It's next door to cartel coffee lab!"}
{"text":"Pretty good! Was in town for an army class. Although my smoothie was 8$, it was tasty and staff was friendly."}
{"text":"I got a juice from here today and it was delicious as I expected t to be. But what really was awesome is that the girls were having a hard time because this establishment was robbed last night and so their system was not working properly and they were still doing the best they could and just making sure everyone was taken care of. Great staff!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times out of convenience, but it's a weird vibe in there... the employees in the morning all seem to keep their eyes down at whatever they are doing, like they are trying to avoid any friendly contact with their customers... it's really weird.   Like when I walk in to QuikTrip most mornings (my standard place for breakfast), the nice folks there always say hello and make you feel welcome, and they make eye contact with you when you are being rung up at the register.  But not here... here it's almost like an exhibit... the folks behind the register seem checked-out from that whole customer welcoming experience. They are just behind a barrier and you're just kind of watching them do whatever they do.   I'll also say that there doesn't seem to be much of a process behind the register / counter area and things end up taking much longer than they need to, and they just seem disorganized. I do hope things improve here because I'd really like to like this place more."}
{"text":"Best part is that it's connected to Cartel. So you get the best of both worlds for the pickiest of couples. Coffee and/smoothie.   But let's move on to this spot only. It was morning when we arrived after a quick workout at the hotel and my group wanted coffee. I'm not a huge fan of coffee to be honest. I love the smell but dislike the taste and end up masking it with creamer and raw sugar. Luckily my girlfriend found this place, as a bonus because they were more concerned with finding Cartel instead. Was a little hungry so ordered something \"light.\" Their acai bowl. Very fresh with minimal sugars added. Sugars were most likely already in the acai mix that they use, can't do much about that. Shaved coconut on top for a nice tropical taste. Girlfriend had the breakfast burrito which was vegetarian. Looked filling. Didn't try it because the acai bowl was bigger than I thought it would be (slightly larger than normal). Inside decor is cute. Lots of seating and possibly wifi. Saw a couple people working on their laptops.   Walked here so not sure if there's parking. But who needs parking if you're visiting the downtown area? Just walk everywhere. Should be able to walk anywhere in the vicinity within 30 minutes tops.   Remember: food adventures are out there. So eat 'em up!"}
{"text":"I love cleansing with Kaleidoscope!! They make it so easy and delicious! Kaleidoscope's employee's are also so incredibly helpful, caring, encouraging, and really know exactly what they are talking about when it comes to health and wellness. I love Kaleidoscope, I recommend it 100%!"}
{"text":"Pros:  Five stars for the amazing pitaya bowl I had this morning. Their house made granola is delicious and the drizzle on top is a great finishing touch. About $10 and completely satisfying.  Adorable set up with everything your standard yogi/juice phene would be into. Essential oils, bohemian accessories, and a little clothing boutique.   Took a brownie from the counter to go and ate it driving back to California. It was yummy and kept me full the entire drive. The only bummer is that all of the ingredients weren't listed which could be problematic for anyone with allergies. (Loved the chewy addition of goji berries but that was an example of what wasn't listed).    Cons:  Had a green juice that had legitimately no flavor. I wish I remember the name but it was the one with the mint...which couldn't be tasted either.   The chick with the short hair was kind of a dick/unenthusiastic/rude/ugh go away. Totally out of place in the environment. If she's in anyway associated with owning the place or knows the owner, I think she's doing the shop a total disservice. If she's a random employee...sucks for the owner. Cute girls needing a part time job shouldn't be hard to find. I usually don't comment about service but noticing that several reviews mentioned it as well I figured I would too.   Also. Update/reprint your menu if free coffee isn't on the agenda -_-    Basically, I'll be back. But this place has so much potential to really be a staple in Old Town."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times, and overall good smoothie and coffee, but never feels like it's worth the price.  Today is definitely the last time I go here though and pay for an over priced smoothie and glare from service girl.  She had such a sour presence and couldn't bother to reciprocate a smile.  Not worth it.  Highly recommend owners encourage better customer service in the future."}
{"text":"the Organica gives me LIFE! I love this place so much and the staff is always so friendly."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place for lunch during the Phoenix Comic Fest and I felt that I definitely made the right decision. As a suburbanite, the prices are a bit higher than I am used to, but not overwhelmingly high and the food is certainly worth it.   I ordered a vegan burrito with a side of roasted sweet potatoes and blueberry tea. The burrito came with delicious chipotle mayo sauce and salsa. The burrito was very flavorful and exceeded my expectations as well as satisfied both my stomach and taste buds. The blueberry tea was amazing and I would definitely try it again. One of the servers offered me a free sample of a banana nut shake, which was rich, thick, and delectable.  Luckily I happened to visit when it wasn't crowded, so I didn't have to wait long for my food. The staff was friendly and the environment was very chill and laid-back with modern/contemporary decor and nice, large windows which let in the sunlight. I can't wait to visit again to try other dishes and juices on the menu."}
{"text":"Good healthy breakfast place. The lox are very good, but then so is the Phoenix scrambler. Also, Lots of good, creative vegetarian choices for breakfast. The bulletproof coffee is fabulous, and the variety of juices is impressive. This looks like a local place with a creative, attention to detail mind at the helm. I'd eat here everyday if I weren't from out of town."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!  They have the best juice, and it's organic and cold pressed!  Very knowledgeable about cleansing and overall health.  They genuinely want to share their knowledge with you and help you have a more energized and healthier life!"}
{"text":"Love all the girls here - great energy, fast service, and always give good recommendations on what I am looking for. Offer a ton of vegan options too!"}
{"text":"Love the design and atmosphere there. The smoothies were delicious! Great place if you need to work from the computer on the go!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best juice bar in town!  It is real deal... 100% ORGANIC, cold pressed juice, awesome truly healthy food, and an great vibe.  There are a lot of imitation juice bars on the scene these days, but Kaleidoscope is this real thing.  I am beyond grateful that they are in Scottsdale :)"}
{"text":"Super rude in my opinion walked in and was not offered for help instead got unwelcoming looks. Stood there for 5 min when some else walked in and he was offered help. Not sure if it was a rave thing but you guys need to fix that."}
{"text":"I have had much better acai berry bowls and smoothies. The smoothie was low on fruit and over whip so the it tasted like chalky foam. Sadly, the acai berry bowl was not much different. The blended berry mixed was the consistency of syrup instead of sorbet, and the granola chunks were huge and so sweet it was disgusting. I don't plan to return. I brought some juices and am hoping they are better than the blends."}
{"text":"If you are in downtown Phoenix for an event at the conference center, then you want to hunt down this place - especially if you are craving something healthy and flavorful! We had a few days of just bad food in the area and then happened on Kaleidoscope on our 4th day in town....4 days too late!  I had the Soba Noodle bowl with chicken...delicious! My friend had the power bowl and it looked fantastic (and she had a look of delight while eating!). We both had the Hulk lemonade drink...fantastic!  Definitely worth a stop in if you're in town. Just be careful - it gets pretty packed around lunch...and for good reason!"}
{"text":"I got the Santana Maria via Uber Eats tonight.  I'm not a big turkey eater to begin with but took a chance since all the ingredients sounded good together.  I'm glad that I did.  It was a really good sandwich.  I liked the mixture of savory, sweet and spicy.  I would get it again and love that I can order it via Uber eats if u need it delivered."}
{"text":"I strolled in here on a random Monday and decided I needed a smoothie fix! This has been right beside my building and I have been neglecting it. It was time to pay a visit. Upon entry, there is lots of natural light in the store as well as plenty of seating. Menu options vary from salads, bagels, protein bowl, tacos, burritos, sandwiches, coffees, smoothies, shots and pressed juices.  Before it was my turn in line, the barista was chatting it up with a cute boy in front of me (clearly flirting lol), and then when she decided she was done conversing with him, she got to me and was completely UNINTERESTED in me! Hey now, I think I'm pretty cute too (if I do say so myself) and if you're going to show him that much attention, I deserve some as well ;)  There is so much to choose from, which is why I asked the barista behind the counter if she had any coffee syrups. She told me she \"had all of them\" and then I asked for two different flavors and she claimed she didn't have them (they were my favorites- white mocha and lavender), so I opted against coffee and for a smoothie. She kind of seemed like she was annoyed, maybe because she already told me she had like sooooooo many flavors to choose from. I ordered the Strawberry Warrior (a mix of protein powder, almond butter & milk, strawberry and goji berries, banana, and cinnamon) it was pretty good, but I feel like it could use a little less protein powder! It didn't keep me full for long, just an hour before I was hungry again, but it was pretty tasty. Next time I think I'll go for something without the protein powder, or tell them to hold off.  Let me be clear, the only reason I gave this place four stars is because of the barista incident. Other than this, I really do like this place and I would definitely come back, so long as I don't have the catty barista once again.    -Easily accessible to the Valley Metro Light Rail  -Good for groups  -Good for bringing work along with you- Lots of tables and comfy couches"}
{"text":"I really enjoy what they are doing here. The Immortal Machine, the Bulletproof coffee and the gluten free muffins are top notch. They offer health with a dose of consciousness in the establishment. I've had the chance to interact with the owners as well and they are doing their best to bring a deeper understanding of what we put into our bodies to the surface and by making things exceptionally tasty, they are convincing people left and right. The vibe is great. Would love to see better customer service(good not great) but this place is a gem."}
{"text":"It was a blistering afternoon in Phoenix when I stumbled in to this establishment looking for ice tea. I was able to get a very large glass of black peach unsweetened tea that absolutely quench my thirst. The staff was super nice and friendly and I was able to hang out in air conditioning. The Wi-Fi was super slow, which was the largest inhibitor to my experience. Beyond the Wi-Fi issue this is a nice little establishment."}
{"text":"Love their take away fresh juices!!! The flu shot is amazing and they carry alkaline chlorophyll water! That's a hard find and I didn't expect it in dtphx! They also carry some awesome coffee roasters like stumptown and dark matter. Breakfast is great  with chia deed oatmeal, smoothies, sammiches, bagels... all around this place is a win!"}
{"text":"The juice is good no doubt. There are a variety to pick from. However, it's way too expensive for a bottle of juice that doesn't last too long. $10-12. Three stars for the juice cause it did not disappoint. However, the price will keep me away. There are other and cheaper Juice establishments with the same quality."}
{"text":"Stopped by last Thursday, first time at this location.   Jen's amazing coconut whip cold brew certainly hit the spot! Great vibe and her attentiveness went along way.   Thanks Jenny!"}
{"text":"Service by Cher and Jenny was impeccable....Very attentive and their suggestions were great today! Will come back soon, love this place!"}
{"text":"The friendly guy at the counter recommended the Chickrizo burrito. He knows the biz. The burrito is so filling and tasty. The chicken chorizo is just as delicious as traditional pork without making me feel guilty. Egg whites, black beans, cheddar, and potatoes. My new favorite. The best part is that I pre-ordered so that it was ready for me immediately after spin class. Love this place."}
{"text":"I came here based on the yelp reviews.  I was hoping to cool down with an acai bowl.    I ended up getting their pitaya bowl and a wheatgrass shot.  I was a little disappointed that you cannot choose your toppings or that they didn't have flavor options.  I was pleasantly surprised how much I liked their bowl though.  I think I was most pleased with their homemade granola that topped the bowl.  It was sweet, crunchy, and full of sweet dried fruit and perfectly roasted nuts.   I enjoyed the \"down to earth\" feel of the place.  It almost has a boutique feel with the product they sell.   The staff was also really friendly and prompt.  I will definitely return here when I am in the area!"}
{"text":"This place is cute, but I think the food is overpriced. I got an Acai Bowl for $9, & it wasn't even that good. It tasted like they added a lot of stuff to it & all I wanted was just acai with some toppings. I probably wouldn't recommend the acai bowl. This place is cute though & the workers were nice, so I'd probably come back to try something different.. but for acai it is overpriced and not good."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times now and it's always been a great experience. The drinks and staff are always wonderful. Definitely recommend if you like pressed juice!"}
{"text":"Their juice selection was tasty and had great variety.  Shares space with a bakery,  so look hard because you might miss their sign. Juices are about $10 for a 16oz. Little more pricey than other places."}
{"text":"I'm rounding here really a 3.5.   The place is beautiful. It's a cottage feel with a ton of spiritual gangster clothes around for sale.   I came in around 8 for some juice and kind of felt ignored by the people working there.   The juices are 10 dollars each and are pre packaged. The juice was pretty good but I feel it is overpriced. I can go to other places in the area and they will juice for me on the spot for less."}
{"text":"Kaleidscope is a part of my daily routine and I couldn't love it more!  Both Dani's, Jordanna and Cher are amazing goddesses that make the whole experience at Kaleidscope. I love supporting local and everyone should go and see these lovely ladies to get all the goods! Start your day with a turmeric shot and yummy shake ... you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Whenever I come to Phoenix for work, I usually stop by this place a couple times for breakfast. They are a bit pricey but everything they offer is super fresh and healthy. I usually just go for a juice, protein Smoothie or acai bowl which are all very good.   If you need a nice healthy spot in downtown phoenix, you gotta come check them out!"}
{"text":"This downtown location was nice and clean! Good food and coffee. Just make sure you specify which breakfast sandwich you want. I didn't see that there was a \"breakfast sandwich\" and a \"vegan breakfast sandwich\" so just heads up. Staff was chill and friendly. I went on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't busy which I liked. I got a vanilla macadamia milk latte with coconut whipped cream. Delicious! Even tho I didn't get what I thought I was ordering, the sandwich was filling and tasty."}
{"text":"Very cute and cozy juice shop in downtown Phoenix. They've got succulents and wall art to enjoy.   Two things about the pitaya bowl. First off, the pitaya smoothie itself didn't have the traditional sweet/tart taste that I'm use to. It was more muted. And another thing is that they provide strawberries as a topping. This is something that I'm a fan of because typically I always have to ask shops to substitute kiwis for strawberries."}
{"text":"This place is awesome - great healthy smoothies - this is my lunch every day.  Add to the great healthy options the fantastic service from Rachael and the team and you have the perfect lunch hour stop."}
{"text":"Kaleidoscope Juice that doesn't make fresh juice anymore? Huge disappointment. The only juice available is pre-made and bottled in their in-store refrigerator."}
{"text":"This place is my go to for fast, healthy, delicious homemade organic food and drinks. The salads are amazing and made with the finest ingredients! The chicken and eggs are top quality organic. I've tried a lot of the food and the flavors are amazing! All of the employees are super friendly and knowledgeable and the customer service is on point always. The bada Bing salad is my fave with organic turkey, egg, artichoke and other fresh veggies. The dressing is made from scratch and is so delicious.  If you haven't been here you should try it because it's great!!! They also sell spiritual gangster apparel in the back and always have great sales"}
{"text":"I'm in and out of Scottsdale for work several times a month and I really look forward to coming in for my acai bowl (add protein) and my juices for the week. Delicious! I just met Alexandra this week and she was as sweet as can be! I will return again and again and again."}
{"text":"You don't have to be a triathlete or a fitness buff, all you have to do is know your body needs solid nourishment.  The owners of Kaleidoscope understands this!  Not only do they serve wonderful recipes of pure awesomeness for the body, they do with class & integrity--everything they juice is organic & zen.    For weeks, I was scouting for an organic juice shop and while this may seem easy to do, it's not.    3 weeks ago, I was very happy to find this nugget of gold nestled in downtown Scottsdale & then on the same day I found out that they have opened another store in North Scottsdale, walking distance from my new home at Windgate Ranch.    The store in old town Scottsdale is next to Poisoned Pen on the corner of Goldwater and Indian School.   Now back to their juice recipes.  Their juices are jammed packed with medicinal whole foods and offer herbal shots/boosts to your drink.  I was happy to find the use of cucumber as a base instead of the sugary tastes when using apples or carrots.   Their produce is local, fresh and organic. Juicing with locally grown produce is optimal for the body as it lives and thrives within the same environmental zen. Additionally, they compost all of their waste from the juicing.  If you are interested in healing your body, sleeping better at night, having more energy without the side effects of caffeine and energy drinks then I recommend Kaleidoscope.  The ingredients of their juices have a much more profound effect on the body because many of their herbs and plants restore the liver, gallbladder, heart and tonify the internal organs and clean the blood.    Their recipes help bring the body back to the source of its purpose; to live healthier.    Because they juice organic, I can drink without worries that their products were not grown in pesticide ridden soil.  If it's not organic then you might as well order a cucumber, kale,and spinach pesticide juice because that is exactly what the produce is when not grown organic.  The pesticide is in the soil as the plants grows and so, pesticide is embedded within the entire plant.   After I got addicted to their juices within a week, I decided to do the 7-day cleanse. This was on my to-do list for a long time; and I knew with the knowledgeable Alexandra's (one of the owners) help and the quality of juices, I could do this.  I'm glad to say that I finished my 7-day cleanse without any problem yesterday. Alexandra and her staff guided me throughout the 7-day journey with their deep knowledge of the juices as well as the flow of positiveness.  Needless to say, I'm hooked on to their juices, the best ever. My journey to a much healthier lifestyle has just started with the 7-day cleanse.  Thanks to Kaleidoscope for truly elevating my lifestyle!!  I wish you all the success & I'll continue to come to your stores every day."}
{"text":"This is such an amazing place to get your healthy kick on the smoothies and the fresh juices they have are just a ray of sunshine in your mouth and belly!! They have such cute clothing and all kinds of amazing things to offer you! Go check it out you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This is my goto place for my juice and smoothies n more . So healthy and good you can never go wrong!!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, juice and the best acai bowls!! Definitely coming back every time I'm in PHX."}
{"text":"When I walked in here I expected to be your typical juice place. I was so excited when I saw that it had so much more. It has incredible breakfast and lunch items, delicious smoothie recipes, juices, and bulletproof coffee. I could've spent my entire daily per diem on this. Instead I opted for a turkey and avocado breakfast burrito and a shot of turmeric since my immune system was feeling a little bit low. Altogether, it's took me about 20 minutes to order, get my food, and eat. I hooked up to their Wi-Fi and worked while I was waiting. I finished half the burrito and took the second half to go. Everything was enjoyable, fairly priced, and great service. I wish that I would've known about this place earlier in my downtown Phoenix experience because now I'm leaving and I already can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite healthy food spot in Arizona!!  The protein cookies are to die for, their house made coconut whipped cream is unbelievable and the breakfast burritos....  I could go on but the best part about all the Kaleidoscope locations is their amazing staff.  If you get the pleasure of meeting one of the owners when you stop in you will be in for a treat!!! Alexandra and Andrea are truly so passionate about their business and go up and over to make each customer feel important.  I truly can't say enough good things about this place!!! Must try it for yourself"}
{"text":"Please correct your hours!!!!... I walked in at 12:25.... & drove 15 minutes. I walk up to the counter and wasn't acknowledged and I asked if they were closed and they said yes. Welllll your hours say 1:00 so maybe you should note that on your website that you don't follow that time schedule."}
{"text":"I liked the vibe of this place and the many vegan options. On my first visit, I had the veggie breakfast burrito and subbed the eggs with tofu. The veggie chorizo is amazing!  The next time, I had a protein bowl with rofu, quinoa and ginger miso. The ginger miso is amazing!"}
{"text":"First timer today. Waited over 20 minutes for an acai bowl just for them to tell me they were out of strawberries. Would've been courteous to let me know beforehand. Other than that the acai bowl was good."}
{"text":"Great great food but rude employees. My first time there was a couple days ago and the girls who were working were rude. Every time I asked a question, they gave me attitude and didn't answer my questions fully. They kept rushing me to pick what I wanted, even when I told them multiple times I wasn't ready and not so sure what I wanted. When I finally was ready, they talked amongst themselves and then acknowledged me and took my order. The other locations have great service and great employees, I'm not so sure why this one is different."}
{"text":"Great acai bowl. I'm on a kick right now and the ingredients tasted so fresh and the portion was generous. It's 100% organic, so don't expect basic Jamba Juice smoothies. It was more on the expensive side of acai bowls but the portion made up for it. It's also located in a cute boutique/yoga type space. Lot's of fun/dangerous shopping to be had while you wait for your food."}
{"text":"So I love to try out new places! Especially juices!! I was in shock that grabbing a toxin flush or a smoothie at the bar are $10...Wow!!  Cute place! Smoothie is ok! Staff was nice but to pricey!"}
{"text":"Excellent quality juices and ingredients. Their turmeric frankincense coconut water took great care of me while attending a training. Vegan peanut butter cookies were badass. This is the best juice bar we could find downtown."}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure I only go to spin so I can eat at Kaleidoscope.   It's not the cheapest way to work out, and also, probably not the most effective considering I'm addicted to their breakfast burrito. When I decide to start my day off at the Madison Improvement Club, I know that it will be at least a $50 morning. My friends are like: Morgan, seriously, walk away. You just spent more on food and juice than working out. You don't need three different drinks.   Um, yes, I do. I need this plain water bottle because the label is funny. I need this chlorophyll water because it's so beautiful to look at and I am a sucker. I need some kind of fresh pressed juice because of vitamins. I need a coffee, because duh. I need this burrito, because again, duh. It's a burrito. I need a vegan cookie so I can pretend to be healthy and still eat cookies.    I need a friend who \"slap chefs\" my wallet out of my hand anytime I come here.    Dammit, Kaleidoscope. Why can't I quit you?"}
{"text":"This restaurant is like home. They have a fridge full of fresh and amazing juices, shots, etc. They have plenty of water available and everything says comfort. I was killing some time but I did need some fuel, so I got a turmeric/orange juice. It definitively tasted fresh and replenished me. Really good vibes too."}
{"text":"This morning place was nice. It was busy when I went (scientific conference nearby) and was expecting to be waiting a while. That was not the case. I ordered fresh juice and food and they were all out before I could sit a good 10 minutes. Would recommend if you're on Phoenix and want fresh food with quality ingredients."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Kaleidoscope Juice! My favorite post-workout drink is the Turmeric Detox Flush with raw turmeric, lemon, ginger, cayenne and spring water to help with inflammation, sore muscles and most importantly, boost metabolism! I'm so excited about their new location at The Madison Improvement Club Phoenix!"}
{"text":"GO here now!! If you want healthy and tasty, best lunch downtown! I heart Kaleidoscope! Everything about this place is awesome! The food is so tasty and healthy; It is hard to find both sometimes...this is my GO TO spot for lunch since I work downtown. The service is amazing! The staff here have such great customer service, they go above and beyond. I always ask a lot of questions and am very needy/particular (I have no problem admitting this) and they are sooo patient and sweet regardless! :) don't change a thing Kaleidoscope!"}
{"text":"I was here for a work trip, Found this place on the second day and LOVED it! Went back everyday until we left. Nice people working there. Great food! Clean place! Definitely will go back when I am in town."}
{"text":"Where do I start about this place. It's amazing!!! The juice is so fresh and healthy, the staff mainly (Jordanna) is amazing. She is super professional and helped me pick out a juice for a cleanse. I will never visit another smoothie place after my experience with her. Thank you for being what this Industry needs. She listened, talked to me about my goals and focused on it."}
{"text":"In all of Scottsdale, this is by far my favorite juice bar/ place to get a smoothie! The strawberry warrior has been my staple for over a year & the coconut whipped cream is to die for!"}
{"text":"I discovered this place just by coincidence, guess where they are located, yes, inside a cupcake store.  I had been wanting to do a detox juicing day for a while.  I even checked out the one Selma Hayed does, so when I found KJ, I was thrilled.  All the juices are freshly pressed and they are organic.  I have done the one day reboot twice now.  I am not going to lie to you, it was not easy, by the end of the day everyones heads looks like a juicy hamburger.  I try to get busy and be distracted the day I do it.  The last one was a lot easier, since I had so many things to do with the twins.  By 6 p.m. that day, I still had two whole juices to go, woohoo.  I all seriousness, the juices are very good, and this coming from a cupcake queen.   I love the Steve's Green Dragon, it has Kale, Green Apple, Mint, Cucumber, Celery, Parsley and Jalapeño which gives it a spicy kick.   The Anton and the Watermelon Mint are also in my must have list.  I mainly do this to give my body a shot of healthy veggies, although the first time I lost 4 pounds, of course that doesn't last long, I kept 2 of those off.  The second time I didn't loose as much, but I am at my lowest weight, which will probably last 15 minutes.   I am trying to give myself a buffer before my birthday binge."}
{"text":"I am so excited for Alexandra.  Kaleidoscope Juice has another location.  They just opened yesterday 12/27/13.  After a week of holiday eating, I needed to cleanse my body.  I could feel it, so I headed to the new location and got my favorite juices.  Green Dragon is my all time favorite.  I got Anton's Spinach, Hot Yogi, and Keri also.  They will also offer salads, smoothies, shakes and coffee at this location.  It is really cute, just a little bit west of Scottsdale Road on 1st. Avenue.  Great location in Old Town.  Maybe after a night of partying and drinking people should consider detoxing here.  Just a thought."}
{"text":"This is the best break for lunch place in all of Scotsdale, Az.  I  was greet by a friendly and totally knowledgeable staff. The food and juices were refreshing and most delightful. I feel energized to continue by day.  I am looking forward to more wonderful surprises as I try dinner and snack breaks here."}
{"text":"Kaleidoscope Juice is my new favorite place in old town! They have a wide variety of healthy drinks, that I feel actually work! I am in love with the pitaya bowl from here and I order it all the time! Every time I go in, the ladies are always so helpful and sweet! The vibe here is so awesome and I tell my friends all the time about kaleidoscope!"}
{"text":"This stuff will change your life...  It's so much more then juice and it starts with the love and care of the owners. Their commitment to your wellness and understanding of how what you ingest changes your energy and your health makes Kaleidoscope Juice not to be missed!   If you are looking for a kick start in the form of a cleanse or just looking to make healthy care a part of your day to day, the owners can guide you towards a program that will help you feel vibrant, energized and excited about what you are eating.. or in this case drinking. All the juices are cold pressed and totally fresh made with all organic ingredients so you can rest assured you are giving your cells the best stuff on the planet.. and trust me you will FEEL the difference. You can also pick up some amazing salads made with the same love and care like my favorite, the kale quinoa. Kaleidoscope is a true testiment to what a fresh, conscious, local experience can be - catered to inhance your personal well being and guaranteed to put a little extra bounce in your step. Don't miss out.. this stuff will change your life!"}
{"text":"Best high vibe drinks and food in all the lands. Green juice all organic and intentional ... A true alchemy. Loads of healthy organic food and now amazing cocktails :) cleanses and delivery as well"}
{"text":"I travel all over the country! This was one of the best Acai Bowl I had!! The service super friendly!  Super clean! Love the furniture......very nice decor!  The music was Great! Can't wait to come back!! So Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The food is really good AND healthy. The staff is AWESOME and so friendly. One of my favorite things about this place is the music! I wouldn't change a thing about the Downtown Phoenix Kaleidoscope. Wish I had one by my house."}
{"text":"This was the perfect lunch spot while I was downtown for a seminar. I went here twice and enjoyed a vegan bowl with falafel, rice and veggies. The staff is really nice. Only downside is that both times I went in there was a long line, and they seemed understaffed. The second time they were so unprepared for the traffic that they ran out of a number of dishes and the food was slow to come out. I still got a great meal that was worth the wait."}
{"text":"We were in the area for the Comicon and this was one of the places I wanted to visit while in town. It was awesome! Huband and I ordered juice on the first visit and they were perfect. I couldn't wait to go back and after trying the tumeric shot and acai bowl the next day I was wishing we lived closer or were in town longer. Husband was equally impressed with the Avo Smash with egg.  There are large windows so you can see what is going on outside while you wait/eat and a great atmosphere inside.  This is a place I will definitely visit again whenever I'm in the area. There are a ton of great vegan, vegetarian, and even options with meat, so there's something for everyone. It looks like they recently started serving alcohol too, which makes it a perfect stop anytime of the day."}
{"text":"Great avocado toast and extensive healthy menu, love this place. Gluten free options available"}
{"text":"Love love love Kaleidoscope Juice! This is a busy person's dream. It makes getting extra nutrients &/or cleansing so simple. Everything tastes fantastic. My favorites are Gold, Dusti Beet, Kerri's Clean Green, & the Strawberry Protein Almond Milk. I've done several 3 days cleanses & i absolutely love the 1 day reboot when I'm feeling a little low on energy. I tell everyone about Andrea & Alexandra & Kaleidoscope. I've lost track but I think at least 50 of my friends, family, & client have done their cleanses (either as a group or on their own) & many say they pop in all the time for a juice or two. Wish these ladies all the success in the world, they're doing great things :)"}
{"text":"So, Kaleidoscope expanded the menu. And uh, there are so many options I don't even know where to start. More vegan options, chips, guac, and pretty much everything you could want out of a healthy lunch spot. Super stoked that something like this exists walking distance from the warehouse district downtown."}
{"text":"Best Açaí Bowl ever no others compares. It's fully of natural flavors and superfood. Always clean and the nicest staff!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and healthy breakfast. My entire family loved what they ordered which included: açaí bowl, the vegan \"chorizo\" wrap, the turkey egg white omelet and one of the shakes. Really tasty, filling portions and incredibly friendly and Attentive staff! If I lived in this town I would be a regular here. THANK YOU!!"}
{"text":"Was craving an acai bowl and found Kaleidoscope in Old Town. It's such a cute little place! There was just one guy working and he was very nice. The walls are lined with shelves of essential oils, juice cleanses, and other natural products. They also offer lots of bottled drinks like cold pressed juices, Stumptown cold brew, and komboucha. I ended up going with a pitaya bowl. Perfectly delicious and refreshing on a 109 degree day! Lots of pitaya and granola, with some banana, coconut, and other fruits. The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was that there were raisins in the granola. It just seemed strange with the rest of the bowl. This place is definitely pretty expensive, which makes sense since it's Scottsdale, but $10 for a smoothie?! Haven't had that but hopefully it's worth the price! The shop is super cute and the pitaya bowl was pretty tasty. I would definitely come back to try the coffee, smoothies, or food!"}
{"text":"We stopped by for an early lunch before heading to the ballpark. It's a cute spot, reminded me of home.   Vegan Chorizo Burrito - We are not vegetarian but because it is lent and no meat Fridays, we went for it. It was a standard burrito but the vegan chorizo brought out the flavors. Topped it with some hot sauce and you got a solid burrito.   Acai Bowl - Their menu listed a ton of ingredients blended in so we just got it blended with banana, coconut water, and sun warrior protein powder. Topped with banana, granola, and coconut flakes. The consistency is was very thick and creamy. I liked it but not my favorite. Wish there was more bananas on top but they told us they ran out. Oh well.   Overall, I would have to say it is pricey but it good quality and there large selection."}
{"text":"Healthy food in downtown Phoenix. Grain bowls chock full of vegetables and mouth-watering sauces. Cool vibe. You say pretentious? I say clean eating. A joy to discover in an otherwise lackluster lunch scene."}
{"text":"Healthy can mean yummmmmm too!!  Beyond the organic cold-pressed juices they are known for: are great & tasty food, smoothies & Nitro coffee mmmmmmmm!!    One of my new faves is the choose your own grain & protein bowls with veggies & sweet potato hash!!  And gotta have me my healthy smoothie: A Bigger Yard (spinach, kale, pineapple, mango & coconut water). Friend had Dragon Slayer (pitaya, pineapple, strawberries, fresh-squeezed OJ). The Santa Maria (roasted turkey breast, w/mango jalapeño jam, Brie, avocado, tomato & arugula on toasted nine grain)."}
{"text":"My gosh! A half hour for scrambled eggs, with Schreiners sausage, supposedly.   Guess they had to wait for the chicken to lay the eggs. Don't come here for a quick lunch, because I don't believe that exists here.  I should have spent ten bucks (I didn't get anything to drink) somewhere else.  I couldn't tell you if it was good or not as it was hard to taste anything thru my anger. I should have just asked for my money back after ten minutes and gone somewhere else so that I could actually enjoy my food... but I kept thinking, it'll be out soon, it'll be out soon. And with each waiting moment, I had less time to go elsewhere before my lunch hour was over.  I guess their system was down.  Funny how they were able to take my cash, but not walk over a peice of paper to the kitchen so they could start making my order. I'm assuming that's why it took a whole  darn half hour. Unreal!  Have a back up plan when computers /Internet goes down! Sheesh!  On a positive note,  the people were friendly."}
{"text":"To be honest, I haven't had much on their menu but I continue to come back for the Acai bowl. It is delicious. I've had trouble replicating the recipe at home, but I'm not giving up. Spending $10 every time I want one (which is daily) is expensive. However, for a treat every now and then, I find the price worth it. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Smells great in there. Cool, laid back environment, the workers are very nice. The pitaya bowl wasn't the best I've had but still solid."}
{"text":"I rarely leave bad reviews but I was really disappointed in this place. I've had Kaleidoscope products before so I was eager to visit the actual restaurant in Downtown. I ordered a protein bowl and a drink from the fridge, costing $20. The bowl took quite a while to come out, and I was one of maybe four customers in the place. The girl taking my order wasn't very friendly and even acted annoyed when I asked a question. The food was ok, but I probably wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"So expensive for mediocre coffee and baked goods! Haven't tried the juice or the smoothies though."}
{"text":"Had the Chickrizo breakfast burrito and it was amazing!!! Also, if you need a quick energy boost they have cold brew nitro coffee."}
{"text":"I had a business meeting at Kaleidoscope a few weeks ago and loved the build your own juice option.  I opted for apple, pear, ginger, spinach and lemon - so refreshing and tasty!  Nice place to relax and friendly staff too!"}
{"text":"This place is sooooo yummy and healthy!!! They have a great vibe with wi-fi and music:) my jam to the fullest! And they just added a bar. AWESOME!!!!"}
{"text":"This new location is so cute. And not to mention delicious. A girlfriend and I stopped in to check it out. The bullet proof coffee is divine, it's a mix of espresso and other energy boosting goodies (Lucuma powder, kidney bean extract, coconut butter) I swear you don't need any extra sweetener. I've had their juices before, I know they're amazing. Going back to try the beneficial fro-yo!"}
{"text":"Please open a place in N. Glendale, Arrowhead area.  I was in Scottsdale, but now in Glendale and miss the thai salad at this place. I think that is what it was called. i tried to make the salad dressing myself and failed miserably. I love it, and wish i could go back and get some. But the drive is so long. Actually, i may have to do a drive and pick up a couple of salads.   This is a great place. Organic juices and fresh healthy foods. I love the Thai salad. I wish there was more salad dressing though with the greens. All in all, this is a great place if you are health conscious. I recommend it. I wish the juices were a little less expensive but i understand their costs are probably high as well.  Thats the price you pay to be a spiritual gangster as their shirts say. :) Great place...5 stars."}
{"text":"This place was an awesome surprise in Phoenix! Some very awesome vegan options from breakfast to dinner! Awesome juices, friendly staff, bit menu.  Downside, they weren't too prepared for some of those conventions downtown there. That section gets VERY busy and they are on prime real estate. We each waited over 40 minutes for a burrito to go. Well, that happens, so can't fault them for too long on that.  Great job guys, keep it up, and add more awesome hot vegan sh*t! I know I'd keep coming back."}
{"text":"First stop when back in Scottsdale! This was my favorite juice & coffee cafe when we lived here and they never disappoint! This time new items including an adaptogenic latte, beauty latte and a flu shot smoothie! Hard to pass up the avo smash & the protein waffles! And don't forget to pick up your Greens to go before leaving. Jordanna & Lauren made this visit an absolute treat! Love our Kaleidescope!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Very healthy option. They have fresh ingredients for all their food, smoothies and fresh pressed juices. The staff was knowledgeable about ingredients and options! I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"ABSOLUTE FAVORITE! Amazing juices, salads, coffees, treats! SO fresh & SO yummy always! Healthy, organic, and delicious. A little pricey but you get what you pay for! So much love for Kaleidoscope Juice. xoxo"}
{"text":"This one of my favorite places to get a smoothie, juice, and a quick meal on the go. It is so hard to find healthy places in the valley and this one stands out too me because of the friendly service and great quality standards!!! I can't wait to come back:)"}
{"text":"This place seems pretty awesome. I just stopped in for a turmeric shot and hummus toast. The trendy atmosphere is bright and friendly. Staff was courteous and helpful. There's a lot on the menu I'd like to try so I do plan on coming back. But only three stars because I ordered to go and waited 20 minutes for my food, which again was toast. But the toast was very good!"}
{"text":"Pretty bad. Pretty millennial girls, bad food. It's interesting to watch how much their baristas waste coffee. I saw this guy today remake the same drink 3 times, wasting more coffee on each attempt. The food is microwaved Costco supplies and veggie protein from who knows where. Enjoy, but don't expect to impress your tastebuds. If a \"manager\" comes to you to ask if there's something they can do, seriously ask for your money back- you're in for the stunned reaction from the employee in front of you that can't  actually help you because they're pretending to be the concerned manger"}
{"text":"I came in fairly early on a Monday morning and I was the only one in the restaurant besides the workers which was nice. I liked that it was very quaint and quiet. I had the acai bowl which was super yummy. I also added the protein powder to it. I love that they give you this option cuz most places don't offer protein powder in their fruit bowls. Staff was nice too! Over all very cute ambiance. Would come here again."}
{"text":"I love a lot of their \"sweets\" even though they are completely healthy.  This place isn't cheap but, what they deliver is delicious."}
{"text":"This is the best juice bar in the Phoenix area, not to mention the smoothies and avo smash that are in my regular diet. The costumer service is great! Cassidy and Brooke make everyone feel like regulars."}
{"text":"PERFECTO!! Awesome \"greens\" \"strawberry banana\" smoothie &&&& the vegan blueberry muffins are amazing!!! Coming back!!"}
{"text":"I was traveling to Phoenix for work and tried this wonderful healthy restaurant! I went three times there in my short one week trip which means I definitely loved this place! I tried açaí bowl, organica shakes, vegetarian chorizo burritos - everything was awesome! Portions were small but sufficient for me for a meal! But if you looking for heavy breakfast or more cheesy food then this place is not for you!   This place is perfect for healthy options! And lot of vegetarian options! Considering I am vegetarian I could eat good and clean food! I taking off one star just because I felt it was bit pricey for the portion of food! But I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Their cookies are amazing and bullet proof too! The optima location has some amazing drinks as well. The girls that work there are sweet and high energy. I was very pleased with the customer service"}
{"text":"This is a cute, cozy, free-spirited juice bar and coffee shop that I decided to check out this morning.   Since I was already late for work, I kind of came in like a whirlwind, but was greeted by three friendly and welcoming ladies which helped me slow my roll, for a little bit. So that I wasn't 20 minutes late to work, I made an executive decision not browse the shop to check out their entire inventory or wait for super fresh juice, so I opted to grab some out of the refrigerator. After a quick glance at all of the bottled juice choices, I decided to go with an 8oz Flu shot ($5) and a 16oz Green Dragon ($10).  The Flu Shot contains:  organic turmeric root, organic ginger root, organic cayenne, oil of oregano, organic lemon, and organic green apple. It is sweet at first sip, but then it's spicy and leaves a very, very mild burning sensation in your throat - I dig it and would get it again.   The Green Dragon contains: organic kale, organic parsley, organic cucumber, organic celery, organic mint, organic green apple, and organic jalapeno.  These definitely taste fresher than the bottled juice at Nektar that I have tried. Maybe that's because I picked a fresher bottle? Or maybe (but more probable) it has to do with Kaleidoscope using only organic produce (yay for not ingesting pesticides and chemicals) and they cold press their juice - pretty fancy - so it's a little more expensive than other juice stores, but the taste! The taste makes it worth it. That is until I can get my parents to buy a juicer (again) that I can later \"permanently borrow\" (again). RIP Jack Lalanne juicer, respect!  From what I can tell, this is a locally run family production which makes me more excited to return so that I can help support an awesome local business and I believe two of them are Arizona State graduates - Go Devils!"}
{"text":"OMG what is this horrid stuff they charged me $9 for. This has to be the grossest, most tart berry drink I've ever experienced, it is masquerading under the very awesome name of Strawberry warrior.  So no strawberry anything. More like battery acid and pepto in a cup  It has an after flavor that could make someone want to lick the asphalt just to get the taste out  Ughhhh. Negative stars except the muffin was edible and not dry."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed with Kaleidoscope! I love the food and atmosphere and the staff are always very knowledgeable and friendly.  Their juices and smoothies are AMAZING and I highly recommend the vegan cookies!  It's the perfect stop after every workout!"}
{"text":"Delicious! The protein bowls are very tasty. My husband thought the sandwich's were bland and said he is going to do a protein bowl next time."}
{"text":"Simply delicious. Fresh and smooth juices- loved the Gold one with greens, apple and mint. Lovely owner- gracious and patient. So happy to have found this hidden gem!!"}
{"text":"I love this place and although people say it's a bit spendy, it's actually very comparable to all other juice places i.e chop shop and nektar. Very happy with all my experiences at both locations."}
{"text":"I confess... I'm not a juice person.  However, I am most definitely married to one, and that's how I know all about the awesomeness that is Kaleidoscope Juice!    Their juice is the good stuff : super fresh, packed with genuinely healthy things, sometimes yummy, and perfect for anything from a pick-me-up to a multi-day cleanse.  The ladies know their stuff and, if you don't know your juices, they're happy to guide you - tell them your goals and tastes and you get matched up with some juice.  While not cheap, the fine ingredients merit the price.  I'm a huge fan of the Flu Shot for a healthy boost.  I definitely feel great after drinking it...somehow, lemon and apple mix harmoniously with oil of oregano and garlic!  I also love the Gold, which is among their tastier options.    My husband has done several cleanses, drinking only their juice, and has felt invigorated all day - he's had beet juices, green juices, almost every variety.  TIP: He loves incorporating an almond milk into cleanses - tastes great and slightly more filling."}
{"text":"I've only had their acai bowl and breakfast burrito but both are absolutely amazing ! Best acai bowl I've ever had ! It's not overly sweet and the hemp granola is delicious.  They are pretty pricey but the quality is worth it."}
{"text":"Great option for fresh juices and a healthy breakfast. Not the cheapest nor the greatest in customer service. This location is also tucked away under a large apartment complex. Most of the parking looked reserved for tenants.   4 stars for the peanut butter smoothie and the quinoa bowl."}
{"text":"Oh my. Why is Kaleidoscope NOT in other areas? Please come to San Jose, CA. Or please send me as many Immortal Coffees as possible. I'm addicted.  Such a great shop with amazing vibes. High vibes, actually, as this is their logo and mission. The drinks are so delicious. The Immortal Coffee hits the spot every time and is a fully loaded bulletproof coffee with some added superfoods and often times topped with paleo coconut whipped cream. Holy wow. It's hot and creamy and the most wonderful thing I've ever tasted.  Then there's a huge array of smoothies and juices and some fun raw, vegan foods to pick from. They have some legit clothing to browse through, too. Spiritual Gangster anyone?  Love you, Kaleidoscope and will come visit you next time I'm back in Arizona."}
{"text":"This is a solid juice spot that also has a variety of prepared items as well as one of the best breakfast burritos ever! On a recent visit I tried the grapefruit and cayenne juice along with the vegan peanut butter protein cookies. Both choices were excellent. The juices are pre-made cold pressed and organic. The cookies were delightful and somewhat guilt free. But the breakfast burrito is quite possibly one of my favorite veggie breakfast burritos of all times. I'm not generally a fan of veggie chorizo but it works in this application and provides a mouthful of flavor. Overall, it's a great spot, with plenty of outdoor and indoor seating and a convenient location!"}
{"text":"I was downtown today and stopped for the first time at Kaleidoscope. I looked at the menu and chose a salad, which you can grab from the grab and go to the left of the counter. There are also sandwiches and bottled juices available there as well. The menu however has a ton of variety, from acai bowls to street tacos, as well as fresh pressed juice. I wanted a juice, so I asked the cashier what he recommended for pressed juice, and he told me the Conquer the world was his favorite. It had beet juice, and a bunch of other things I can't remember right now. It was delcious. I had the Thai a Knot salad with chicken, which I picked from the grab and go, but they took it to the kitchen to be tossed and served in a bowl. Everything was great, tasted fresh, and came quickly. There is also a little bar with liquor and wine.   It seems like a great place to work, read, come with a friend, or just grab a quick bite. I really enjoyed it and will most likely be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! All of my favorite healthy brands in one place. Plus there's nothing I love more than walking into an organic juice bar and telling them what I need and they know the exact right juice to fix all of my problems!"}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place especially because it's so close to my dermatologist so I'm in the area a lot. The quality is great and I have never had an issue with my order but the experience is half the expectation and in that regard, the staff didn't seem the friendliest."}
{"text":"Loved this place the people and decorations were good I got an acai bowl and it was decent just a bit expensive!"}
{"text":"Here on my way to a conference. Smoothie is okay, but I've been here almost 20 minutes waiting on a smoothie and a coffee. These chicks move as if they could not care less. Will not be back."}
{"text":"This place got everything right.  Great energy, inviting vibe.  All organic and gluten free.    I went with the Immortal Machine smoothie (banana, almond milk, almond butter, gluten free oats, vanilla warrior powder and about 7 other healthy supplements).  Dynamite.  And while I was waiting I discovered a package of GLUTEN FREE Almond Butter Chocolate Chip Protein Cookies.  Can you say impulse purchase?  (I can confirm they are soft, sweet and delicious).  Turns out the girl who took my order, Alexandra, is the founder of this business.  She's always loved nutrition, got a business grant while studying at ASU, and now she has 4 Kaleidoscopes.  I think I kind of fell in love a little?"}
{"text":"An oasis of health food and crafted espresso in the concrete Phoenix jungle. I was in town for a conference and this glorious establishment was just a couple blocks from where we were staying. I was here for one week and ended up coming here for breakfast four mornings out of five.   Excellent breakfast here. I tried the acai bowl, which is the best I've had. I also had a couple of the juices which were very good and not too sweet. The protein waffle and the burrito were also very very good. I even bought some granola to take home. I wish this place was in Denver, but it's probably good that it's not here or I'd be spending all my money on eating here."}
{"text":"This place is ok. Went in for the first time last week and the girl didn't know much about the products. Was disappointed they couldn't help me more. Also unlike the other local juice bars they won't let you sample anything before you purchase it. I did not like that, so I purchased two kids, one was good and the other was awful. If the had provided samples I would have been able to find what I like before taking home and getting stuck with it. I didn't even drink half of one of my bottles"}
{"text":"The smoothie i had here and their protein-gluten free muffins were a God send of nutrients and flavor. Just what I needed while visiting Scottsdale for a tough Yoga assessment. Thank God for places like this. Please support clean and healthy food restaurants like Kalaidescope. Service was great and love the small business indi feel. Felt like home away from home."}
{"text":"Always stocked with fresh juices, newest health supplements , and delicious goods. Juices, smoothie, avocado toast, avo bowls, coffee, salads, wraps, and they're vegan baked goods are amazing."}
{"text":"I paid $3.50 for the world's smallest macchiato. I do not typically feel a need to add sugar to any caffeinated beverage but THIS, there is not enough sugar in the world to make it not taste like a big ball of dirt.  To make the experience even less enjoyable, we just sat and listened to a yoga instructor tell someone her tendons have PTSD. I don't think she knows what that actually means. Possibly one of the most pretentious places ever. Gluten free muffins are delicious though so at least there's that. Get the muffin, leave immediately."}
{"text":"I was craving a  teriyaki bowl just veggies with my family I knew this place from doing Uber eats delivery mostly for juicing. But was wanting something healthy.  The staff seamed not very helpful. And kind of full of them selves. I get the bowl and has just carrots mostly and sweet potatoes. Nothing remotely like an Asian teriyaki dish. And they gave me the sauce that looked like creamy dressing that was teriyaki sauce. I didn't even eat it. I went home throwing up what ever I did eat. Veggies were not very fresh and looked like slop..."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!! I wish I could give Kaleidoscope Juice 100 stars! Alexandra and her mom Andrea have really brought something so incredible to Scottsdale. I love the juice, salads, wraps and treats. Their store is easy to find and parking isn't a problem. For anyone who has tried juicing at home knows it isn't exactly easy.  The prices are very reasonable and the product is simply the best. I highly recommend Kaleidoscope Juice, I LOVE supporting this small local business!"}
{"text":"This place was just awesome. I was in town for business and stopped for juice and breakfast every morning. The food is fresh and made with quality ingredients. The juices were prepared fresh and the ingredient combinations made it hard to choose from a list of must haves. I looked forward to trying something new each morning. And it was so reasonably priced for the quality."}
{"text":"Stopped on our way out of Phoenix. Great iced coffee and delicious smoothies. Just what we needed to jump start our day! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I purchased a pre-packaged meal to find someone else's hair on AND under the boiled egg. Staff refused to exchange the salad or acknowledge that this was unacceptable. Very disappointed and grossed out. The $2 \"friend\" coupon the staff member applied doesn't make it right (originally $12 salad)."}
{"text":"I just called this morning around 9am to place a food order to go and the girl that answered the phone said she was going to place me on hold for a \"couple of minutes \" which I thought was interesting. After a ten minute hold and nobody coming back to take my order, I hung up and went somewhere else. I only waited 10 minutes because I was driving , otherwise I know that sounds absurd. Customer service these days ....where has it gone ?"}
{"text":"Best juices around - and they're the real deal (cold pressed, nutrient dense, organic etc.)!  Their food is awesome too."}
{"text":"When it comes to organic, cold pressed juice and delicious, healthy snacks, Kaleidoscope is the best.  Don't miss this place!!"}
{"text":"BEST acai bowl in the valley. i have tried every place for bowls & this place wins every time. But ITS NOT FAKE acai and not as bad for you as most places. They do not add sugar (to mine at least) and make it right there. They add hemp and homemade granola. Personally, I go there for the Anton juice, charcoal water, or turmeric flush. Best elixirs in town :)"}
{"text":"I've been wanting  to check this place out for some time and was looking for a meal replacement smoothie. Cute place. Good product. However, I can't feel great about spending $10.00 for one smoothie. I buy organic food and spend a little more money on shopping local, but not going to be a regular with the prices here. Mad respect to this concept, but not going to do it."}
{"text":"Bulletproof coffee and fresh veggie juice under one roof...total win"}
{"text":"Wow! Found this place while traveling for work and ended up eating here at least once a day. Excellent food options and wonderful staff! Between my coworkers and I, we tried multiple items and never were disappointed. Wish they were in Oregon so I could eat there everyday too!"}
{"text":"What I wouldnt give to have one of these store in my neck of the woods!!!! Love this place. I follow a keto diet and they have plenty of options available which isn't common! I bought and tried several products! Healthy, all natural and they had a boutique!"}
{"text":"What kind of Juice Bar doesn't have oranges.?? We came here Saturday morning. I can't believe a Juice Bar doesn't have any oranges in the summer of arizona. So ridiculous."}
{"text":"3 stars or 4? I battled this for minute and settled on four, given how good their food is. My issue is with their prices. I stopped by for lunch today and ordered their sammy (tuna sandwich) and peanut butter protein cookies. As I paid and exited, I checked my receipt and saw that I just paid $21 for lunch. That was just too much for what I was given. Don't get me wrong, the sandwich was very good. You really can taste the freshness and quality ingredients. The cookies as well were very fresh and just hit the spot when it comes to being a great peanut butter cookie. You can not go wrong with the food, but the price was just hard to swallow. I also noticed another customer taken back by paying $10 for a baked good. Love the food, hate the price. Better close out this review before I change my mind."}
{"text":"Great food and the girls are very nice but the kitchen is lacking on timing. This is the third time I have been in and ended up late for work because my egg whites and veggies took over 20 min to cook. One time I ordered it over the phone and they forgot to make it so I did not have time to wait. It's too bad because it's a great little place and good menu but unless you have time to wait I wouldn't suggest coming here."}
{"text":"Great location near Chase Field and Talking Stick Arena. They have some great juices and smoothies. The Immortal Machine and Bulletproof shakes are as good as it gets."}
{"text":"Wow... Great find in Scottsdale! What a great place to stop and power up, reflect, smile and relax. Staff was nice, lots of beautiful smiles and helpful. Cool shirts, gifts and lotions also. All in all pleasant surprise when I was just looking for a green drink."}
{"text":"Updated Review:  Back in Phoenix again for a conference.  I ate at Kaleidoscope every morning.  I am so happy it is so close to the convention center.  I love starting my morning here for the food and the ambience.  The atmosphere is super calm and bright.  The food was just as good as I remembered it from a few years again.  I have been on the Keto diet for a few months now so I was so happy to see that they serve Bulletproof products!  They have a delicious and creamy bulletproof coffee as well a macro balanced smoothie with bulletproof octane oil.  I will be back again when I am in town next!"}
{"text":"Disappointing... My friend and I were excited to try this for the first time, but $20 for a smoothie and juice is expensive and not worth the money."}
{"text":"Great place to start the morning! Amazing lattes and Acai bowls! The staff is very nice and the tunes are great. This place gives off a positive vibe!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Kaleidoscope Juice on Saturday and I'm in love!  We wanted to grab a smoothie after going to the farmers market, and Kaleidoscope was a logical option - of course. I've ordered their food and juices on Uber Eats and Postmates so many times, but this was my first time in their shop. I love the decor and the high vibe feeling with all of the crystals and superfoods.   I enjoyed the Mint Chip smoothie - it was like a natural and healthy milkshake! My boyfriend enjoyed the Immortal Machine. I grabbed a charcoal lime water 2go to compliment the detox I'm currently doing.   When I order from Uber Eats/Postmates, I love to get the Thai a Knot salad.   We'll definitely be back in for another smoothie morning :)"}
{"text":"Protein bowl was great and nutritious and I couldn't finish it had  so much great veggies in it ! Filling and my tahini sauce on it also tasty! Wish I had tried one of their organic juices ! Very healthy lunch"}
{"text":"I have been a long time admirer of the veggie chorizo burrito here.. I was stoked when they expanded and started serving nitro cold brew (even though I get anxious af when I partake lol... worth it). The only reason for a four star rating is because one of their employees failed to greet us warmly. It could be because it's early though (8am?).. other than that I love this place!"}
{"text":"Every now and then, I learn a little something from my husband...  One of the most recent things I learned is that Kaleidoscope not only has juice, but they have salads as well.  And when I went in to see for myself, I learned that they actually have a ton of other menu options too (coffee, smoothies, muffins, cookies, burritos, granola, and so much more!)  Jared stopped by their new store a few weeks ago and told me about his kale quinoa salad.  Always looking for healthy lunch options in the 'hood, I ended up going in myself and was oh so pleasantly surprised.  I already had one of their salads and I plan on doing one of their \"Juice 'til Dinner Cleanses\" tomorrow (along with Jared and his sister, Alexa M).  We'll have a total of four juices and one of their salads each... I'm actually excited to try them and I am already anticipating feeling great during and after, so I'll report back once done.  (The power of optimism, right people?!)  The ladies working when I stopped by were super friendly and knowledgeable... (shout out to you both: Jess and Jessie I believe).  With three locations in the Valley including this main one, I'm sure I'm not the only one that is grateful you exist.  Thanks to Kaleidoscope for creating healthy food options that are appealing and easily accessible in today's busy world!"}
{"text":"Cool vibe healthy food cute servers and not the shortest wait.  Juices are reality quick.  I ordered oatmeal latte and eggs took about 15 min which is reasonable for fresh food. Kombucha on tap n cold press coffee.  I'll be back just planning on wait more."}
{"text":"OK so I TRY to feed my machine right when I travel and that often never happens. I was in the mood for a \"real\" juice (i.e. cold pressed) so I yelped and found this place just minutes from my hotel. I made the trip twice! The KERI juice was yummo and the açai bowl was unreal... ridiculous... like crazy good. So good that I was scraping the bottom looking for more. I came back the next day for another. ;-) If you're nearby it's worth a visit! Cool people, great energy."}
{"text":"I love the juices they taste far better than mine. Today I ate the burrito wrap oh my goodness was it delish, especially the veganaise yum!"}
{"text":"Omg l couldn't have been happier with my vegan burrito. Instead of tofu I had them add the roasted sweet potatoes. The vegan chipotle mayo was the perfect topper for this burrito full of flavor. I also had the chlorophyll water it was very refreshing! I will be back to this great spot very soon. The service was amazing everyone a spoke to was helpful and personable! The woman who served me today 10/23/17 rocked thanks wish I remembered your name!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place and these people!!! The staff are all so friendly and helpful and take the time to get to know you. I work nearby and frequent this location and feel truly valued there. Both the juice/coffee and the food menu are delicious, the service is great and it's good for take-away or to dine in. I've had questions about ingredients and what health benefits certain things have and the staff is knowledgeable and usually will give you samples to try things out before hand, especially the juice. It's overall a great location and experience and I'll continue to recommend it!"}
{"text":"This place gives me so much joy it's unbelievable. Everything that they make here is delicious, healthy and makes you feel good hours and days later.   Their 6-juice/day cleanse is hearty and doesn't leave you hungry.   Their snacks (especially the hemp bars) are SO GOOD. They're also good for you. Low in calories, sugar, salt and carbs.   Their meals - the soba noodle is my favorite are also incredibly healthy but fill you up AND you have leftovers because the portions are large.   Their food and juices make me happy inside and out. Support Local and shop at Kaleidoscope."}
{"text":"This place is so cute! Great place to come to after a busy day at work or just hanging out downtown. I had their açaí bowl which was pretty good (and aesthetically pleasing if you can tell by the picture). I hope to come back when I'm downtown again and try more of their food and juices."}
{"text":"Simply put....this is one of my favorite places in Arizona. The juice is amazing and the staff is superb! They all have tremendous knowledge of their product and available to answer all your questions. I am stuck on \"The Immortal Machine\" and \"Gold Juice\" right now but I will continue to make my way through the menu. Not only will you feel great from the fantastic food and juice but you'll feel good just being there. Amazing place and you must go!"}
{"text":"Living just outside old town, I had been to this location once before, but recently, I've been coming with a co-worker daily! We're totally addicted! Strawberry Warrior smoothie, watermelon flush juice, charcoal water, sweet potato burrito, & Acai bowl are just a few of my top favorites! Plus, spiritual gangster is connected!  Absolutely love this location, and Candace is amazing, super chill, very friendly, & accommodating!  I highly recommend you swing by for a smoothie sometime soon."}
{"text":"In a 4 day visit to Scottsdale, we came here twice for the quinoa Mexican egg bowl (hidden in the fridge) and a dose of relaxing, earthiness.  Ask for the eggs warmed up.  The store has plenty of comfortable indoor and outdoor seating, and also sells expensive but delicious looking gluten free treats (almond butter cookies, etc) and clothing with quirky, inspirational phrases."}
{"text":"Great find. Cool atmosphere. Variety of drink and food options. Latte was spot on. Immortal machine smoothie was a revelation. I don't know what half of the things are that were in it, but they hit the spot."}
{"text":"One of my favorite locations! I love the merchandise part of the store and the quaint location. Most of all though is the staff is amazing. Jenn in particular is really nice will go above and beyond to make sure you are taken care of. I am doing a 3 day cleanse and a small mistake was made by not including all the juices I needed. I called this location to just see if I could speak to a manager and just get the juices I didn't receive and it was handled immediately. I was relieved to receive the rest of my juices- 1st time cleansing:-). I Highly recommend for cleansing its affordable and all juices taste good. Nothing is ehhhhkkkk this far. lol"}
{"text":"Kaleidoscope oh Kaleidoscope what would I do without you when I don't make my own food????!!!!!!! All I can say is this place is a gem! The owner puts in a lot of work into this place to include the menu, decor, and customer service and it shows. I have been going to this location since they opened in 2015 and it has evolved. The business keeps expanding to other locations throughout the valley and it will probably be in every state in the next 10 years. The food is amazing and always fresh. People always comment on the price but your paying for REAL FOOD. So in the end it's worth it especially for the high quality ingredients. The staff is always welcoming and doing their best to make you happy and the ambiance is on perfect. I only miss the music  more as it brought you out of your head to a chill vibe. If your visiting and you eat REAL FOOD go here as they will deliver and then some... favorites to try are Avocado with egg, all breakfast options, protein bowls, immortal machine, all juices, vegan protein bar, warm vegan, all salads, pitaya bowl teas..."}
{"text":"I had their strawberry protein drink and it was super yummy and filling. While I was checking out they were making one of the bowls and it looked amazing trying it next time."}
{"text":"My first time at Kaleiedoscope, visiting from Southern California, where juice bars are plentiful! I didn't know what to order but Jenn totally helped me out.  I loved the Santa Maria wrap but can't say enough about the recommended Anti-Inflamatory juice!!! So, the next day, about 24 hours later I noticed I looked far less bloated and felt great!  Jenn and Brooke recommended I try the \"Hulk\" drink, which is basically an Arnold Palmer with Cloryphyll and then I tried a Turmeric/Ginger Shot (with a side of water, highly recommended).  Woke up today feeling great and loving the service and loving Kaleidoscope!!!  I will be back!!  Thanks Jenn and Brooke for the great direction!!!"}
{"text":"I visit Kaleidoscope whenever I'm in town.  This visit was my first time at the 1st Avenue location in Scottsdale.  The staff is very upbeat, eager to help and always seem to find the right fit for what I'm looking for.  Kudos to the staff and excellent juices with a great selection!  Best option around!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! I have tried all the juices and haven't had one I didn't like. I make a special trip once a week to stock up on juices. You feel amazing after drinking knowing you are putting something healthy into your body.  I have also tried the muffins and breakfast \"cereal\" (I think its called \"Breakfast Plumber\"), they are delicious.  My only complaint would be the price. At the same time it's so easy and I don't have to spend my day cleaning up a juice mess!"}
{"text":"This place is expensive...but I needed a potent organic juice to get me through whatever bug was trying to bring me down.  I Googled to find a juice bar in Scottsdale and they just happened to be down the street.  1st time in, so I didn't know what to expect, but I was expecting  & wanting a fresh press juice that I can pick my own veggies, fruits etc. in a custom drink.    Well, they already have pre-made juices in a cooler and I ended up with The Flu shot ($7).  They directed me to the cooler which has quite the selection of their menu.  At this moment there was 2 people in front of me and it seemed it might take awhile, so I went with the pre-made option.  It was really potent as it had oregano oil in it and that will cure almost anything.  I like the concept, which I did not experience -fresh press juice but it's nice to know you can stop and grab what you need.   For the price to grab and go-cooler option...I will not be back.  So, I probably won't be back for the fresh press juice option either."}
{"text":"I decided to have a healthy lunch and heard about kaleidoscope online, so I biked over. I decided on a bottled kale spinach juice and the kale salad. The juice prices were not on the menu,  wall,  or bottle. The total ended up being $20+ for the two items which is a bit much especially for lunch. Note: they do not offer half salads either.  When the employee delivered the salad, I noticed it lacked most the ingredients listed.  I thought maybe they were at the bottom of the bowl.  So she left and I started mixing the salad.  The salad only contained kale and lemon dressing. I confirmed with the menu to make sure of the ingredients. I returned the salad and asked \"aren't there supposed to be pumpkin seeds,  hemp (?) seeds, and other ingredients? This is what I ordered,  yea?\" (While pointing at the menu). She said yes, apologized, and offered an add on item at no cost which was nice.  She returned with the same salad with my fork in the same spot with the seeds and add on but the quinoa was still missing.   It alarmed me that she returned with the same salad she took from me because usually if an order is wrong the restaurant brings out an entirely new dish or a side of the missing items. I didn't want to interrupt the boisterous conversation between her and the baristas at Cartel again to get the salad I ordered. I will not return.  For a $20+ lunch of a mediocre salad and juice I expect employees to know the menu."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. It was kind of hidden so you have to be careful when looking for this place. I had the breakfast sandwich and it was delicious. It felt light enough that I wasn't stuffed when I finished eating it. I also had the mocha coffee with almond milk and that was good as well (kind of on the bitter side). Overall price wasn't horrible, and the food is really good! Will come again whenever I'm in this area."}
{"text":"I love all of their juices.  The quality is great!  I especially like the \"Flu Shot\" when I feel a bug coming on.  Also my favorite eats are the avo smash and the protein waffles.  I just recently have been buying my maca powder here."}
{"text":"Place is always on point, friendly staff and great healthy smoothies.  Going to try the bfast burrito and bulletproof coffee tmrw."}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference and ate here 3 out of 4 meals in a row - that's how much I liked it. I'm a coffee snob, and their latte was fantastic. I had the avo smash with eggs (yum!) twice, and a breakfast plate that had sweet potatoes, eggs, and toast, which was really flavorful. All of the employees were really friendly, and even though the card machine was down once, I promptly received an email receipt when the machine was back up.  Minus one star because it was SO hot in there (and it was only 70 outside), once my over hard eggs were runny, and because it's pricey. Luckily I was there on work's dime, because this is outside of my personal budget."}
{"text":"I have 1 million things to do today, but I decided to push this review up to the number one spot because I just finished eating here and being very wowed. I ordered the salmon on organic spelt and a walk-in. They had a special on their matcha bowl ... I said go ahead, and I ended up with this dessert that they could have charged five dollars or more for. This meal overall was amazing! Somehow healthy food can also be comfort food? Yes! ... if you are at Kaleidoscope, this is the truth. I got a delish, completely ultra-nutritious meal for $20. I'm completely addicted to this place. Is that bad?"}
{"text":"I wanted to give Kaleidoscope a good review SO badly. I actually used to like them. But I can't give them more than 3 stars for a few reasons.  1. Although their juices are BOMB (but overpriced), they mess up the smoothies/shakes EVERY time. One time it was way too watery, another time I couldn't even suck it through the straw because it was so thick!   2. Juices are way more expensive than any other juice place (one reason I used to be OK paying more is because I know they only sourced organic/all natural fruits and veggies, which I really appreciated). 3. Every time I've gone in the last 2 months, they've messed up my order.   Again, I used to love this place, but maybe they started hiring the wrong people (or training them incorrectly). I hope they get their act together so I can go again!"}
{"text":"I ordered an açaí bowl and a 24 oz cold brew! It came out to be 14 dollars which I thought was kind of pricey until I tried the açaí bowl! It turned out to be the best açaí bowl I've had and was very filling! The girl that made my açaí bowl was super friendly too. I stayed a while to do homework here because of the free wifi, chill vibes and aesthetic interior! 10/10 recommend!"}
{"text":"There was only one other customer in the shop who had already been taken care of when I ordered my smoothie. I paid for it and sat back down and waited 15 minutes while listening to the 2 baristas gossip. I went up and asked if my smoothie was almost done and she said she forgot about it and will make it. No apology or discount or anything to make up for it. Everything is overpriced and not worth it. Save your time and go to Juby True or Chopshop, they'll have faster wifi as well."}
{"text":"Bulletproof coffee is amazing! Healthy too! Can't wait to try lunch there soon!! Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Got the acai bowl!!!! The workers were so welcoming and wait wasn't bad! Their mini spiritual store was way too cute! Lovee it!"}
{"text":"This place makes the best Bulletproof coffee! The baristas are very friendly and know what they are doing. I had my grass fed butter coffee made with all the extras, including collagen protein, brain octane, and cinnamon. So yummy!!!"}
{"text":"I can finally write about my favorite little hidden spot: Kaleidoscope. I always complain about not getting enough veggie nutrients and got on a major juicing kick before moving to AZ. What I didn't consider was the expense of a juicer and working on a low salary, so what do to? Find a juice bar!    When I searched for Kaleidoscope at first, I couldn't find it and gave up, messaging the owner (embarrassingly)  to figure out where in the world they were. She responded quickly and was incredibly friendly, leading me right to the doorstep of their fantastic shop! They have all kinds of juices and almond milk/milk-substitute drinks that will help curb the appetite if you're cleansing. Bottles are $10 and they have varying flavors. They are always more than happy to give you suggestions based off of your taste preferences and helped me pick out my cleanse assortment. They also have little salads, healthy snack options and raw sources like whey, etc.   The inside of Kaleidoscope is bare bones and I love it. You see the countertops that they make all of their juices on, bowls of fresh produce, the machines, bottles in the back and the fridge upfront with fresh-made juices that are labeled with expiration dates.   I am a huge fan of the River, the Dusti Beet, the Kerri's Clean Green and the Strawberry Protein Milk.   They aren't flashy, and I love that. They deliver orders, have small drawings, and keep things simple--just like their concept. Two thumbs up from this gal!"}
{"text":"This spot has become our official one stop for smoothies and healthy yummies. Great place, great people, highly recommend"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Downtown is in a lack of nutritious spots and kaleidoscope fills that void with its airy positive environment and fresh veggie forward food options. Mario has been a pleasure to see the two of two times I've been here. He makes a mean pitaya bowl with a smile and you can tell he puts in that special ingredient of love and intention into it! Thanks so much!!"}
{"text":"Horrible service with horrible attitudes.  Definitely a place where they only take care of their regulars only and ignore everyone else"}
{"text":"Wow, blown away by this establishment. Coming from San Francisco, I wasn't expecting to stumble across what is now my favourite açai bowl/juice bar....in AZ! The Immortal shake and açai bowl are a perfect combo for any health conscious person. 10/10."}
{"text":"Amazing, kind staff and wonderful selection of juices & pastries. I'm vegan so I got one of their dairy free muffins and PB brownie which are both to die for, and even my mom who is not vegan loved all of it. My new favorite juice spot!!"}
{"text":"Everything I'm looking for in a quick, casual eatery as well as coffee house and juice shop.  The vibe at Kaleidoscope is relaxed in a trendy but unpretentious atmosphere.  Open spaces and industrial style design are broken up with wood accents and greenery.  Staff is exceptionally friendly, saying hello to those who enter, and answering questions about their menu as long as you need.  What makes me happiest is the variety of healthful, delicious food.  Small snacks to hearty meals, all with a whole grain/ fruit/ veggie feel - don't worry... there's meat too.  There are juices for drinking and cleansing too, though that's not my jam.  I tried a Universe Shake smoothie and \"made it green\" for an extra $1.  It was DELISH!  Also great that it left me full and energized for hours after.  Another day I tried the vegan breakfast sandwich but added eggs to make an omelette.  I was a little disappointed with this one as all the veggies were left uncooked and unseasoned just folded into plain scrambled eggs.  Hot sauce helped, but this is probably the least inspired item on the menu.  A cooler of free fruit infused water is available for those dining in or as you wait.  Tables come in low and high, communal or individual, bench style and comfy arm chair.  Next time I'm in Phoenix I'll definitely be at Kaleidoscope sipping a smoothie,  trying one of the epic looking acai bowls, or proteining it up with a bowl."}
{"text":"I like their juices & when I got a 25% off coupon (which as you can see on the picture, has no expiration date) at the gym grand opening party  in October I was very excited to use it. I only do cleanses twice a year so I was going to use it for my next one, however when I decided to use it, it did not work online & when I called they said they won't honor it anymore.  Thanks :-/ Maybe put expiration date on your marketing materials as heads up next time so your customers can plan accordingly. Very disappointing :("}
{"text":"Amazing! Super healthy, and really good food! All of the employees are friendly and helpful, and the cafe has a fun and upbeat vibe."}
{"text":"This place Is bomb.com I love the fact I can get a meal & dessert within my diet. I am all about fresh products and this place is literally my dream, all Fresh meats & fruits! Love coming here for my pre meal & stacking up my protein before my workouts! Great establishment & so happy this location is in the heart of downtown phx!"}
{"text":"Update, looks like a change in staff did the trick, the service is much better and friendly,  the food remains fantastic. They have a solid team and the effort shows. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"What an incredible group of doers and givers!!!!  So giving and passionate about helping others.     It is definitely worth it to swing by and grab a nutrient BLAST to fill your body with amazing foods.   They all taste incredible, and extremely FRESH!"}
{"text":"The juices are amazing here ! So good I could drink them all day everyday , but unfortunately I can't ... The only down side is they are pretty pricey , 10$ a juice. So if u wanna do a cleanse prepare for a good chunk of $$ to be spent :(  I'd give 5 stars if they were a little more affordable for a daily basis."}
{"text":"There juice was very good but there customer service was horrible. They make you feel like you bugging them when you ask questions. They don't let you sample the juices which is a bummer since your spending a lot of money. Core and Karma juice are alot more friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Fantastic and hearty smoothies as well as courteous and quick service. (Ask for Rachel, she's a pro.)  If you're on the go and need a sippable, delicious meal, you can't go wrong with Kaleidoscope's Strawberry Warrior. The atmosphere is very friendly and the juices and smoothies are excellent. Highly recommended for out of towners (and in-towners!) on the go."}
{"text":"The bright faces match the vibrant juice. The new cocktail menu got me extra awesome on Saturday."}
{"text":"I love fresh juices and their strawberry almond milk was to die for - but paying $11.00 for a small juice is kinda highway robbery to me. Coming from LA and paying only $7.00 for juices."}
{"text":"Found the best place ever. Serves bulletproof coffee, fresh juices and this bangin' Acai bowl! Not to mention they have a Spiritual Gangster apparel store attached. :-)"}
{"text":"OMG, this place was amazing. I had the Beauty Latte and that was seriously the best latte I've ever had. I also had the Strawberry Warrior and added collagen to it, so yummy. Finally tried the charcoal water which was super refreshing and cleansing. The whole place was super interesting; so many cool items to look at, from natural cosmetics to handmade jewelry. The only thing they need to improve is to serve the juices and coffees with the lids open or something like that, so foodies like me can take some good pictures! Just better presentation. I somehow didn't take any pictures and I'm so bummed about that. But maybe my drinks were just gone too fast since they were so good."}
{"text":"fresh juice, nice food. what else does one desire in this sad, sad world."}
{"text":"I went to lunch here with my friend for the first time a couple of days ago because we wanted to go out to eat but also wanted to eat healthy! I am so glad we had tried this place out because man oh man was the food fantastic! If you want a salad you have to grab it from the fridge that's next to the cash register (we had no idea) so there were no more salads when we went up to the register to order one. Since the salads were all out we ended up getting a power bowl. I got quinoa, chicken, and teriyaki sauce. Now I am very picky and when I go to healthy places to eat, normally I don't like it because the flavors are just blan or completely weird. This place was sooooo delicious! It's a little pricey to go here all the time but I definitely would if I could!"}
{"text":"Customer service was non-existent. 2 workers did say hi but that was it. They were busy chatting between themselves. The other juice bar was very helpful with info about their juices. Items seemed expensive too."}
{"text":"Great little place to stop by for breakfast or lunch . Everything is very fresh and staff is friendly. Minus a star since the prices are fairly high."}
{"text":"Love everything here--the smoothies, juices, cute vibe, store, and sweet/fast service!!!!  I only wish we had the exact same thing in Dallas!!"}
{"text":"Incredible! Immortal machine. Too many ingredients to list but the most delicious and nutritious smoothie. Also recommend the turmeric flush with a Wheatgrass pour over is crazy delicious.   They also have these Rice crispy treats that have more healthy ingredients that most of us get in a week - even including unexpected ingredients like tahini. They are in their cold case to the right of the front ordering area.   You can also grab a fresh salad as well. They make them each day and plop them right in the ol' fridge as well. I noticed one with Soba noodles... everything else is mostly gluten free as well.   WAY better than any juice place I have ever visited. Ever."}
{"text":"thank you kind people at Kaleidoscope Juice for hooking up a Denver visitor with some of the most delicious juice I have had.  and thanks to fellow Yelpers for reviewing this place.  see, i was in town for some pre-season baseball, and hiked up Camelback for a little exercise.  having ate like crap most of my visit, and just finishing a good trek, i so needed some healthy refreshment.  I checked the Yelp app, and boom.... there u were right down the road.  Needless to say, it hit the spot and my only regret is not making the drive here every morning.  had a celery, apple, kale, and jalapeno... nice and spicy, and so very fresh.  I should have gotten that quinoa salad too.. oh well.. see you next spring!  go Rockies!"}
{"text":"I was in town for a conference and came here every day! I loved the detox juice, kale salad, and acai bowl. Great place to have a healthy meal and do some work. I chatted with the staff and a few locals. Everyone was friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite downtown spot! I work downtown and continually find myself coming back to Kaleidoscope because of their great food which is healthy and locally sourced, as well as their juice, tea and coffee. Everything's so good, and gives me energy to get through the day. The ambiance is super chill as well, and the friendly staff is great also! No better place for a breakfast or lunch meeting."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots to get a yummy & healthy breakfast! The staff (Sam especially), is super knowledgeable about all of their products. I have yet to be disappointed by anything! Highly recommend for anyone who needs some feel-good food :)"}
{"text":"I love this place! Not only is the atmosphere comfortable and calming, but they have great food, drinks, and even clothes! The strawberry warrior smoothie is my favorite as well as the Greek quinoa salad. I visit here about once a week just to get the quinoa salad. All of the desserts and treats are amazing and home made. You really can't be disappointed by any of them. The only downside to this place is that it's a bit expensive, but I definitely think it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Love love love kaleidoscope! They have an amazing variety of cold-pressed juices and their staff is super friendly and knowledgeable about their products. My favorite smoothie is the strawberry warrior, and their açaí bowls are to-die for!"}
{"text":"I was so pleased to find a place that made bulletproof coffee and it was the best I've ever had! I had a really good chocolate gluten free muffin to go along with it."}
{"text":"10 minutes walk to the convention center.  I went here every day, breakfast and lunch.  Have the avocado hard boiled egg thing, it will send yu mad with pleasure and fill you will protein for a hard day's work.  The lunch bowls are huge.  They have a great selection of special waters such as turmeric, delish. It's not cheap b ut the food is good, the staff are friendly and the wait is not too long."}
{"text":"I have been living in Optima for three years now and I dread the fact that this is the only food option in the building other than the vending machines in the gym.  The food at Kaleidoscope is actually pretty good.  The people who work there, however, do not understand the concept of parallel processing.  On three separate occasions, I had to wait anywhere from 10-15 minutes to buy a pre-packaged breakfast sandwich.  One time, there was a line of one person in front of me.  The woman working there was making a smoothie for the customer in front of me.  I understand the concept of a line, but the worker looks at me, looks at the breakfast sandwich in my hand, and then continues to make the smoothie for 10 minutes.  It would have taken 30 seconds to process my order.  She was the only worker there.  On a separate occasion, there were two workers.  This time, there was a line of two people ahead of me.  Again, I went there to buy a pre-packaged breakfast sandwich.  Both workers were making food for the two people ahead of me.  One person then came in behind me in line, and she just wanted to buy a pre-made juice.  She ended up putting back the juice and leaving.  It took me 15 minutes to buy a pre-packaged breakfast sandwich.  Both workers saw that I was holding the sandwich in my hand and that it would have taken 30 seconds to process.  The concept of parallel processing to them must be a complex logistical operation.  On a third time, a similar issue happened.  I saw a line of one person.  I am pretty decent at pattern recognition, so after waiting five minutes, I decided to return the breakfast sandwich and leave.  Over the past three years, I may have bought 100 breakfast sandwiches and breakfast burritos with sweet potato.  I have pretty much given up on this place now.  If you see a line of one to two people, you could get screwed."}
{"text":"I LOVE this juice bar. If I'm feeling lethargic or the beginnings of a cold or if I just want a yummy juice, I head straight in! Love the girls who work here too. My personal favorites are the River, Dusti Beet and the Flu Shot. They also have this one that tastes like coffee... Yummmm-meeee!"}
{"text":"Why can't you call ANY of the shops at anytime of the day? Annoying especially when everything in this city is a 40 mile drive! I don't want to chance if you guys are even open guess I'll just go to Wholefoods. They answer phones over there"}
{"text":"I've had the pleasure of trying a few of the smoothies/protein shakes (Strawberry Warrior is one of my favorites) as well as about 4-5 different flavors of their freshly baked organic protein cookies (they even have vegan options!). Everything here is amazing!! I can't wait to try more of the meal type items. Seriously the best protein cookies I've ever had. I never feel guilty for eating more than 2-3! HIGHLY recommend! :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! If you need a Real Pick-Me-Up get the nitro-coffee you wont regret it! One of the few places you can get acai bowls downtown too!"}
{"text":"Kaleidoscope is a great term for this eatery since their food is colorful, varied, and incorporates various genres of food. Whether it's an acai bowl, tacos, or a smoothie, they have fresh and healthy on the menu.   After browsing through the plethora of options I decided on a protein bowl and an iced tea. The protein bowl has various meaty options was well as tofu, with your choice of grain (quinoa or brown rice) and sauce. I chose the quinoa and tumeric tahini sauce. It was fairly busy around lunchtime so it took some time to get my bowl made. When it did arrive it was a beautiful mix of colors and quite a large portion of food. It included roasted beets, fried tofu, red bell pepper, carrot, cabbage, and roasted sweet potato. Quite a lot of veggies for your bowl! A perfect mound of microgreens was placed on top. All the components meshed together well taste wise and I enjoyed the tahini sauce which was a good consistency to go with the bowl. They did sneak a piece of chicken into my vegetarian bowl though. Good thing I'm not totally vegetarian!  There is a counter off to the side that offers the various iced teas. I had the Kaleidoscope blend which was light, refreshing and delicious. The cup they gave me was huge too!  If you can't finish your meal they do have a self serve station with various to go boxes.   Overall it was an enjoyable experience. The bowl was a little expensive at $12 but it was a lot of food for your money and included high quality ingredients. I'd stop by again if I wanted a fresh healthy meal."}
{"text":"If I didn't drop a minimum of $20 on every visit they'd definitely get 5 stars.  Best juice in Scottsdale, hands down. Whether you're doing a cleanse or just need an afternoon boost of nutrients, all their juices are fresh and delicious.  My favorite is the Green Dragon - jalapeño yum! or the Hot Yogi - so refreshing!  They also have a few options to chew on and everything I've had tastes great and will make you feel fabulously healthy.  Thanks for taking care of me Kaleidoscope!"}
{"text":"I've been to about 3 locations now.  The ONLY reason I go is because they make very good peanut butter cookies, I've tried to make them on my own or look for them elsewhere but am unable too.  First off they are very over priced, I know it's Scottsdale but come on! $10 for a smoothie!  second there customer service is just awful.  I know this because I have experience and witnessed happen on more than one occasion.  If someone is spending almost $50 at your juice bar show some interest.   I get the feeling the people who work here don't need the money  or the job but instead run it as a hobby.   Finally I COULD overlook all this but there hours are different than the one listed online. Like why would they do that? it's confusing and irritating!   So I went down the street to Creamistry and got ice cream. :D   Chesty: 1 Kaleidoscope:0"}
{"text":"Not bad but overpriced, $10 for a smoothie?  I think their are many options in Phoenix for less, the smoothie was tasty but this place was difficult to find and is just too much, I don't think I'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I went to this location of Kaleidoscope twice. The first time I ever visited Kaleidoscope was to the other location, in Scottsdale. As I am from out of town I heard everyone mentioning Scottsdale to be \"the place\" kind like the BH of Arizona. But truly is not. This location was SO MUCH better. For me quality over quantity is ALWAYS a striking point. And I had only one cappuccino and an açai bowl in the Scottsdale location with a below zero quality. I came this this location just to see if I could have a better experience and I am glad I did. I usually cook my own self and I am pretty good to make my perfect creamy açai. But this people are consistent and the location is cute."}
{"text":"I was sooo happy to find this place and their several locations. I went to Kaleidoscope both days I was in Phoenix. I had the Immortal coffee  twice  - protein bowl - a few of their juices and salads. If you want healthy clean eating - this is definitely the place to go."}
{"text":"Had a tuna wrap, black ice tea, and a couple of exquisite, perfectly proportioned cookies, totally satisfying, cleaned my plate, and not feely stuffed"}
{"text":"Love getting either the salmon and asparagus box or tofu and sweet potatoes bowl for lunch and at the outside, long wooden bar, soaking in the noonday sun. Never feel stuffed after a meal. I love the juices, but a bit too expensive for me - got to try one free of charge via my FiveStars points, $10 value. Employees are cool, service is good. Good spot for eating alone or one other. Parking is only on street and hard to find - the empty parking lot directly in front of the place is just for real estate biz located next door."}
{"text":"This review is mainly for the customer service.  We were touring an apartment there and found out that Kaleidoscope Juice was attached.  I was excited as I used to drive to their other location when I'd fly into Phoenix for work.  Now that we are living here, I was super pumped to start frequenting this place again.    Hands down some of the best juice I've ever had.  And I've tried them all from local places in Denver, Florida and to subscriptions to Pressed Juicery in California.  The juices here are great.  Always taste fresh and the Watermelon/Mint Detox is heavenly.    Anyways, we went in and the customer service was sub-par at best.  I won't name drop because it's irrelevant but neither of them smiled, nor offered to help. and once we selected $70 in juices and brought them to the counter we weren't even acknowledged.  First off it furthered the stereotype of this area of Scottsdale but secondly when you're paying that price for juice you should at least be acknowledged or thanked after you make your purchase.  None of which happened.  I had to try convince my girlfriend that it was a good place because it wasn't impressive.    The other location in Old Town when I want there was awesome.  The staff there was friendly and that's probably the one I'll go back to after this experience.  I went with 3 stars as the service was a 1 and the juice is a 5 so I averaged the entire experience out :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for food coffee and juice ! Everyone that works here is so wonderful and helpful. They will set you up with a custom juice cleanse to fit your wants and needs or you can pop in and grab a bottled juice for the day. They also have the most delicious treats like vegan cookies I stop by almost every morning for breakfast and I'll pick up lunch and couple juices!"}
{"text":"I am somewhat of a juice junkie. The juice was delicious. The breakfast burrito I ordered on the other hand was mediocre. It was put together ahead of time and microwaved. Or at least that's what it tasted like. The tortilla was hard in some places like it had been warmed several times. I just wasn't blown away for $13 for a burrito and juice. I would absolutely go back for the juice. I do like that they offer a \"kids\" size which is reasonable in my opinion."}
{"text":"Wow what a great find in downtown Phoenix! I was looking for a casual place to snag a healthy breakfast and coffee while traveling for work and I'm so glad I found Kaleidoscope Juice. Everything on the menu sounded great, and there's a good assortment of options - breakfast sandwiches & scrambles, things on toast, protein bowls, and superfood shakes. Coffee wise they have cold brew, bullet proof coffee, and a full espresso bar. I opted for the avo toast (on spelt bread) with two over easy eggs plus a cold brew coffee. It was delicious! Filling but still light and healthy. And the cold brew was also great - smooth and strong. I love the atmosphere of this eatery as well. It's trendy but not pretentious at all. Lots of wood accents and plants - I could hang out here all day."}
{"text":"Best smoothie I have ever had: The Immortal Machine. The taste is complex and simply delicious. The Strawberry Warrior is also great if you like fruity smoothies. My only complaint is that they don't have a shop in LA! Will definitely be back when I visit Scottsdale again. The interior is cozy with a few places to sit. There is additional seating outside."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! the shop itself is super adorable and inviting. they have some retail items that are so darn cute! my favorite is the flu shot smoothie! it's delicious and healthy lol. they also have an avo smash to die for. I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! the juices are cold-pressed, which is actually better for you since it maintains its nutrients unlike fresh pressed, the shakes are perfect, and the food is amazing! the staff is friendly and helpful, as well. this is a clean, well maintained place that keeps me coming back!"}
{"text":"Busy place! Lots of good healthy options, a bit pricey. They offer a few select cocktails as well."}
{"text":"I had the açaí bowl and it was delicious. I would get it every day for breakfast if it wasn't $9. I wished they offered a smaller version as I don't need that big of a portion. The flavor was great though. My friend had the blueberry bagel and they burnt the first one, so I appreciate that they restarted instead of serving the burnt bagel. They put a bit to much cream cheese on it for my liking, but she enjoyed it. Blueberry flavor could have been a little stronger."}
{"text":"Disappointing...  First off, this place sells pre-bottled juice (homemade and delicious), but nonetheless, I was expecting juice that was freshly made in front of me.  Secondly, I thought that $10 was quite pricey for said product.  On the plus side- the juice is organic, raw, and tasty."}
{"text":"Love this spot! Always fresh juice and friendly faces. The juice and service consistent at the other locations too. Checkout the cute apparel at the old town location."}
{"text":"If you are looking for anything wellness, health, protein, acai, exercise, trendy, or feel-good related, COME to Kaleidoscope Juice.   After arriving in Scottsdale on Thursday for the weekend, I craved an acai bowl; after googling \"acai bowl scottsdale,\" Kaleidoscope Juice popped up, and I'm so glad it did. It was beyond what I was hoping for, as they have the smoothies, coffee, juice, etc, but also place importance on protein as well as real food such as avocado toast, waffles, vegan cookies + muffins, and more.   The staff is both passionate about the food and drinks as well as the customers, lending to a welcoming, feel-good atmosphere.   In terms of seating, although I was able to grab the one spot near an outlet, the indoor seating just consists of a square table with 8 seats around it. There area few tables outside to enjoy your food and drinks as well, and while waiting for your order, you can also browse the little adjoined shop with interesting jewelry, clothing.   I ordered the Acai bowl and the iced protein coffee, both of which were phenomenal. I hope to come back before I leave in a few days; I just wish I lived in Scottsdale to come back more often!"}
{"text":"Just as I gave their other location a 5, this Kaleidoscope earns one as well.   Tucked on one floor beneath street level in the apartment complex, the shop is a bit difficult to find from walking on the street. However, just find the space in between the buildings, and walk away from road to take the stairs down one level. It will be on your left!  I ordered my protein iced coffee and loved every sip! I look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Place is great and service is wonderful!  Locally owned with quite a number of vegan options.  Everything is fresh and what I had was wonderful. I ordered the acai bowl for breakfast, and ordered a miso ginger tofu protein bowl to go to eat on the plane later. I reheated my protein bowl later & it was still incredibly delicious!!  I'll definitely come back next time I'm in town again. This is a new favorite!"}
{"text":"I am here every day.  It's a problem.  Great drinks and smoothies.  My favorite smoothie is the bigger yard which they took off the menu but will still make.  The medicine broth has brought me back to life on more than one occasion.  I drink either the charcoal, alkaline chlorophyll and strawberry collagen water on a daily basis.  Their shots are great for recovery.  And their food- especially their salads and breakfasts are uh-may-zing.  But ultimately the best thing about this place are the people that work there.  They hire the best staff who believe in the product and it shows."}
{"text":"Oustanding food. Good organic grub in the desert. I had the Santa Maria, which is a turkey breast sandwich with a mango jalapeño jam and brie. It was a perfect pairing served up on whole grain bread. I come down here for business quite a bit and this place is now a new favorite."}
{"text":"Kaleidoscope has a great selection of juices and I always find something new I like. Right now I love the charcoal water because it has a splash of lime in it and it helps cure any hangover. I also like the dirt water and the benefits that it brings."}
{"text":"They really know how to concoct really wonderful juice flavors.  I recommend doing their \"cleanse package\" as it saves quite a bit of money on the pre-bottled beverages. On the flavors, they are really balanced in flavors. I am a juice bar junky and have found that many juice bars tend to overkill on the sweet fruits to compensate for the vegetable flavors, but this place really embraces the harmony of both flavors.  I.e. Dusti Beet is wonderful combination of the earthy flavor of beets, with a hint of spice from the ginger, and a slight sweetness from the apple.   Wonderful!!  They also have so many other flavor options. I really love this place!"}
{"text":"Came in to the Madison just to try kaleidoscopes coffee! I also got a breakfast bagel sandwich. I got the nitro brew which I believe was press coffee not their own regardless was delicious! The breakfast sandwich was also delicious! Worth every penny I had no idea the Madison was a spin/yoga studio so I felt way out of place since I was only there to try the coffee and food haha"}
{"text":"if you love organic juices this is the right place. A friend of mine told me about it last Wednesday and I came here already twice since then. It is also very closed to my office, which it makes it easy.  Definitely a great place for great juices."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of being exposed to Kaleidoscope even before it was named. I have tried many of the juices that are made by them everything is Ammmazing... If you are looking for health improvement take a \"Juice Cleanse Challenge\". To be honest Alexandra (the owner) may not even know what that means but just tell her Rich said do a Juice Cleanse and she will set you up..  Well worth it!"}
{"text":"Best place to go for a high quality healthy meal or snack. All of the employees are super knowledgeable about their products, all around good vibes, every time!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out and getting a Acai Bowl. I walked in and two employees had their back turned towards me while I was looking at the menu, than I stood their waiting while they were trying coffee it looked like. There was another employee who was cleaning and didn't say a word to me, I was also the only customer in there. Than finally one of the employees didn't say anything besides \"what can I get you\" so I ordered. Literally he said not another word. I would go back because I didn't enjoy the bowl and their menu looks interesting, but the employees service could be way better."}
{"text":"Kaleidoscope is a great Juice Bar located right next to Cartel by City Scape. I have come here so many times.. that it is official I am a local and a regular and they may know me by name.   So.. What makes Kaleidoscope so special... well..  1. Waffles - The Waffles are delicious, best Waffles I have tried and since they are organic and all of that goodness, they are healthy in my mind.  2. Acai Bowl. No idea how to properly pronounce.. im going with ASEE-AH bowl for now, but anyhow it is Amazing. Add the Immortal Mix for an extra vitamin boost and it gets a nice little chocolatey flavor to it.  3. Immortal Shake - Oatmeal Cookie in a shake, but its healthy. It is really good and is a meal replacement BUT please mind that it is heavy I can only get through half.   4. Pastries - Top - oh those protein doughnuts! and the cookies... and the brownie... ok everything.  Fully recommend. Come and try it out. There is usually just one person working so it can take a little longer than expected but well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Fast execution while I was on a mission to get in and out.  Who knew it took a kaleidoscope to see a speeding ninja?"}
{"text":"I was so excited to check this place out, I've had some of their raw truffles and granola from whole foods and they were delicious. Anyway my experience was terrible. When I walked in there was a guy and a girl working... Not friendly at all. I wanted a chai so I asked what kind they used and the girl showed it to me and it looked good so I ordered an iced chai with almond milk. It took them forever to make it even though it wasn't busy. Then the guy gives me a hot chai and I nicely told him that I ordered an iced chai and him and the girl just give me this annoyed look no apology or anything. So he goes to remake it, then the guy gives me this white looking drink that resembled nothing of chai and then tells me he tasted it and it tastes watered down and they usually don't make chai like that and I'm like okay why would you not make it the right way?! He said he used brewed tea and for the iced chai they usually use a concentrate and he could splash some of the concentrate in it... I told him I ordered an iced chai and wanted the concentrate and it made the right way and he's like no I'll just splash some in, so I just gave up and took the drink. When I took the first sip it was absolutely the most disgusting chai I've ever had. So pissed that I wasted $5 on a drink that makes me want to vomit."}
{"text":"I just can't give anything LESS than 5 stars! Vegan friendly, they offer house made almond milk as a nondairy alternative as well as unsweetened coconut milk. And, a bonus, like a HUGE bonus, they have vegan whipped cream made from coconuts.  Their lunch and breakfast menu is as pure as it gets. Organic ingredients everywhere. It's great."}
{"text":"Juices are slightly over priced. I order an acai bowl to go with no coconut flakes and they messed it up. I really don't get the hype around this place truly nothing special."}
{"text":"The best juice place I've discovered in the Phoenix area.  Everything is cold pressed within a day and comes in a variety of flavors.  Many times juices can be incredibly difficult to swallow but these are all surprisingly tasty.  The staff is knowledgeable and willing to spend quite a bit of time with you answering questions or developing your own program.    The word is starting to get out which leads to them occasionally running out of juices.  It's best to go in the morning to be assured of getting the juices you want."}
{"text":"Nice array of organic, vegan options. The almond milk coffee was delicious. Protein bowl with tofu, sweet potatos, and a spicy peanut sauce was very good. Vegan burrito with kale and sweet potatoes was a solid choice also. Beers on tap to boot! Cute little place to dine in or catch a game on one of the big screen TVs. Also some seating outside to lounge on a nice day."}
{"text":"Good juice spot! Food - Had the watermelon mint and a breakfast sandwich that were both good.  Ambience - Seems like a decent place to sit and relax. Staff - Friendly and pleasant."}
{"text":"Overpriced smoothies.  I bought 2 smoothies and a coffee.  Total $30.  Def not going back.  They were good but still not worth the price.  Make your smoothies at home.  Way cheaper."}
{"text":"I had a very positive experience at this establishment! Before I go any further, I would like to say that this is an overpriced restaurant but also that every juice bar is overpriced so at the end of the day who really cares? Ok so here is the juicy details haha: my friend and I went to this juice bar to have something to eat, escape the harsh southwestern sun, and get some work done. And let me tell you, we accomplished all three! I had avocado toast and some Collagen Water (collagen, lemon, cayenne, strawberry). It made me feel very healthy. One time I got an IV of saline at the emergency room and I thought I felt refreshed after that, but this collagen water REALLY made me feel refreshed. I honestly think that it shifted my perspective on how healthy I could possibly feel. My friend got an açaí bowl which she enjoyed very much. One thing that was unique about my experience was that the fire alarm went off and nobody reacted or knew what to do. I'm not sure if that says something about the nature of the juice bar or the nature of the people there. I just thought I would throw that in. Overall, great experience!"}
{"text":"I have been in this place a number of times and although the juices are very expensive you do get what you pay for. I would definitely come here again. The staff is very helpful too"}
{"text":"I come here almost every single day since the first time I visited! I cannot tell you how great their coffee, salads, vegan protein cookies, paleo cookies and everything else I've tried here are! The Immortal coffee is my favorite. On the other side of the cafe, they have an adorable boutique, where they sell super cute tops, bras, candles, jewelry, etc. They also sell supplements, natural deodorants, lotion etc. I absolutely LOVE this place. The friendly, professional & positive staff is what makes me come to this location specifically."}
{"text":"Nice people, amazing product, couldn't ask for anything better. Quinoa and kale salad is so delicious. I hope they make it out to Vegas. I would totally be a daily customer! In love"}
{"text":"Clean eating done easy, affordably and super tasty. I'd highly recommend this spot if you're looking for a healthy option without sacrificing the taste. Try the lemonade, it's not overly sweet and super refreshing."}
{"text":"Love this neighborhood gem. I've enjoyed watching the business grow, and love the new juice options. It was perfect timing to try some new stuff!  Keep it up - love you guys."}
{"text":"Food was fresh and delicious especially loved the jalapeño jelly on the Santa Maria sandwich  Service was superb especially from the oriental girl with the nose jewelry MUSIC off the chart!!!"}
{"text":"This place has so much potential. It has all the elements I love, but also a few that just rub me the wrong way. I've been here a couple of times and will, in all honesty, probably be back to give it another chance. This review is regarding the last time I was here, when I got an iced tea.   Value: The food and drinks here are a little pricey. Given the location of the place however, perhaps it isn't TOO overpriced. Most meals will probably ring up to around $15 after tax if you decide to add a protein option. They do offer wraps and sandwiches that are cheaper.   Drink: The iced teas are served in enormous cups. Two-hander cups in fact. This would be an incredible value for the less than $3 price, but for two issues. #1: They load the cup to the brim with ice, which means that in a way you're paying for maybe a cup and a half of actual tea. #2: The teas aren't incredibly potent or flavorful that would justify loading the cup with that much ice. I ended up blending some house tea with the herbal blueberry. It was underwhelming. But at least I stayed hydrated right?  Service: Not the friendliest. Pretentious hipsterias was my immediate thought. It hasn't changed yet, but if it does, I'll let the Yelp world know. I've had better service at other Kaleidoscope Juice locations.   Ambiance: This is the winning factor that keeps drawing me back. The entire room is filled with light, little knick knacks, couches, and wooden tables. I'm in love with the decor. I want my apartment to look like this.  This place could be great. I mean, they serve alcohol now. Currently however, this is just a pleasant spot to enjoy a tall glass of refreshingly cold flavored water. I'll be back to try the food and maybe some of their juice."}
{"text":"The food is always great and consistent, but for this visit, their app was down so they did not receive my order. No big deal, I had proof of payment and an order number. The young lady who informed me of this really did not  put any effort beyond telling me the app was down, and then walked away from me. Luckily, a different employee stepped in to help, and submitted my order. The \"it's not my problem\" attitude is what keeps me from coming back to great spots. Luckily the young man who helped me was a quick thinker and able to effortlessly get my order moving."}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for a conference for 4 days and found this place on the first day. You know it's good, when in 4 days, I visited the place on 3 different occasions - breakfast, lunch and juice break! Their food is extremely healthy but yummy, I had the chickrizo burrito, acai bowl and a yummy fresh juice!"}
{"text":"FOOD POISONING We were excited to visit and placed a large order to share.  The green juice, beet juice, acai bowl, and a muffin. The food tasted great, but afterward we didn't feel well.  A restaurant has never made me sick before, and my husband proudly describes himself as the 'iron stomach', but even he was sick.  I can't imagine we'll be back.  My daughter had the waffles and felt fine."}
{"text":"I went on a Saturday morning, around 9:15am. It was busy and service was very slow. I stood in line for @ 15 minutes waiting to place my order. When I reached the counter and requested an Acai Bowl, I was informed that they were out of acai. I ordered pitaya instead. I inquired if they could make vegan breakfast sandwiches since their menu indicates that they have vegan chorizo & vegan mayo. It was told in so many words that they were too busy to accommodate this request.   As I waited for my bowl, I witnessed them mess up a couple of orders. One man had been waiting at least 1/2 hour and was given gluten instead of the gluten-free order he'd requested. They scurried to replace his order.   I got my bowl in about 20-25 minutes. It was much smaller than I expected for the $9 price tag, especially compared to other local eateries. The only fresh fruit was banana. The description included raspberries. They may have been blended in with the pitaya, but I couldn't tell. The bowl was decent in flavor. They were frozen chunks at the bottom and runny at the top. It wasn't the best pitaya bowl and it definitely wasn't worth $9. But if you're in Old Town (and unable to drive elsewhere) and in need of a quick breakfast bite, there aren't many other vegan options."}
{"text":"Best place to get juice in AZ! Friendly staff complimented with a high vibe environment! Definitely recommend stopping by if you're in the area!! Best smoothie is the Immortal Machine (great with espresso). Don't forget to give any of their gluten-free baked goods a shot as well! Almond Butter Chocolate Chip Protein Cookies are my fav!"}
{"text":"Meh...Unfortunately, that is all I have to say about this place. I came here to try their acai bowl and I've been very disappointed. Every bit had zero flavor. Even the fruit. I really wanted to give this place a good chance and even came here on three separate occasions. Nope - I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Acai bowl is awesome! A place that actually adds full amounts of supplements; I've seen places add the tiniest amounts yet price gouge on the up charge. The flu shot drink is also really good if you like that sort of thing."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service. On my lunch break, never been before. Waited in one of two long lines, my line was slower. Time to order one pitaya bowl.  Was told this line is for drinks only sorry. I looked at the \"correct \" line that I'm now supposed to go to the back of to try again and decided to go somewhere else."}
{"text":"I liked the staff and the place has unique charm for a local joint. Great Acaii bowl!"}
{"text":"I was hoping to give 5 stars, the food and other things are wonderful, the staff however were rather crude, now...this review is from last year in the spring, I am just now getting around to it. I was very excites to see a healthier, vegan place...even though it was about an hour away I wanted to try it, walked in, nobody else was in there which was nice, ordered a shot of wheat grass and a forbidden rice bowl, both AMAZING, staff acted like I was a bother to be in there, and basically snubbed me off when others entered, oh well, guess I didnt live up to their standards..but they didnt either to mine, will not return."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have ever had... we walked in and the human working stared down at the counter on her phone for a good solid couple of minutes before she finally acknowledged us. Even then, no welcome, no hello, no smile, nothing. Even your lowliest McDonalds employee knows how to welcome someone in to their restaurant. We later heard her talking to the local D bag at the counter saying she had been there since 5am (it was close to 8pm). Still, that's no excuse, and especially if she knew how to talk to him, she could have treated us like fellow humans.  Maybe take a cue from Dutch Bros, who finds millennials who actually have some people skills. I used to think Optima would be a cool place to live, but after seeing the losers that hang out here, I'm glad I don't. Oh, and the bowls we ate were overpriced. This place won't last."}
{"text":"Nice find here in downtown.  Good little setup on the inside and quick service.    The ice latte was good and my gf got a juice that was actually a lot better then expected. Just sucks we live a little distance away or we would be coming here on the regular.  Also ordered a breakfast sandwich that was flavorful"}
{"text":"I love the gluten free options! They were running a $2 special for a bagel and coffee and I was officially hooked! Their staff is super friendly. Ive only come for breakfast."}
{"text":"I always try to find a fresh juice store and coffee shop in every city I visit. This just happens to be the first place I found that was close to my hotel and has both juice and coffee. I was very impressed by the food menu and hope to come back here for breakfast. Unfortunately their juicer was not working but they had several fresh juices already packaged and I found a very nice variety. I also really enjoyed the mocha latte."}
{"text":"Kaleidoscope is a great option for breakfast in downtown Phoenix. They have an array of fresh juices and smoothies, as well as hot breakfast options. There's something for every mood. You can call ahead for pick up, which is what I would recommend in the morning - otherwise it may take a little while for food since this place is popular! There's ample seating, to sit and work too if you're not on the go."}
{"text":"I very much enjoyed my visits to Kaleidoscope over my recent holiday in Scottsdale. Their amazing portfolio of juices sparkle with freshness, and the macchiatos are the best I've found - pair your choice of coffee with some delicious Almond Butter Protein cookies for a delicious mid-morning break. And their Old Town store is beautifully decorated - a space of modern calm - from the wheelbarrow of fresh herbs and flowers at the entrance, to the lovely raised common table where conversations are easy! What a welcome addition to the Scottsdale scene - who knew that healthy could be this delicious."}
{"text":"The atmosphere was fun, the smoothie was spectacular but to be honest the service was less than friendly..  The two girls yapped on and on about drama and made me feel like I was intruding..  Not welcoming at all.  Had they been more welcoming and tasteful I would probably recommend the place.  I most likely won't be going back."}
{"text":"I was feeling under the weather when I woke up so I went and got a flu shot and another non fruit green juice. So sorry I didn't note the name. The flu shot was YUMMY! I'd highly recommend it. There's a long table outdoors with seating for four. There's a large high top table with seating for eight inside in addition to a another little table on the boutique side. The girls were very helpful and super sweet. Definitely try it. It is a bit pricey. But, it's all organic and fresh so... money well spent."}
{"text":"Wow. The prices hit me straight away.  Not cheap.  The team that works there is really nice and friendly but I got sticker shock.   I moved here from Seattle and the prices are the same there for juices.  I just can't muster the energy to frequent such places"}
{"text":"Friendly, quick service but the breakfast burrito I got to-go was burned on both sides when I opened it. After trying to remove the super burned parts, I gave up and unwrapped it. The insides were a bland nothing. No seasoning on the eggs. You couldn't even tell it was turkey. Really disappointed especially considering it's a $9 burrito. I wanted to love this place as much as the previous cafe housed at The Madison. If I order from them again, I'll stick to the juices."}
{"text":"Kaleidoscope is one of my most favorite places to go in Old Town. I love to indulge in their many vegan treats on the regular. Their almond mylk is pure bliss and they make such delicious and filling smoothies. My favorite salad is the Thai A Knot salad and I'm always SO sad when they're sold out. They have THE best granola on their acai bowls, I'd get one every day if I could! I stop by almost everyday for a Chai or Jasmine tea.   The girls who work there are awesome and very friendly. Always helpful and inviting. Please make more raw vegan carrot cake cupcakes!"}
{"text":"Amazing place with yummy juices and bowls. I can walk there from work and will be there very often! Keri juice was perfect."}
{"text":"This was my first time coming in and I ordered the immortal machine. I was so excited to try it because I read some really good reviews about it but it honestly was not good.  I struggled to even drink half of it. I love healthy foods and I was bummed. I was even more bummed that I spent $10 on it and couldn't even finish it or enjoy it. To be completely honest I felt like I was drinking raw protein powder. I haven't tried anything else so maybe this one shake just wasn't for me but I don't think that I would go back."}
{"text":"Great stop to start your day! Friendly staff and very helpful. They were well educated about their products and the health benefits."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best coffee shops in Scottsdale!! Amazing coffee, baked goods, smoothies, juices and natural products. The staff is so friendly and helpful. They offer a variety of non dairy mills like hemp milk and macadamia nut milk. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Visiting from Las Vegas and stopped here for coffee! Friendly staff, fun environment, GREAT latte, and yummy breakfast options that are healthy and tasty!"}
{"text":"Delicious and healthy! What more could you want. They definitely know their stuff and are ahead of the curve with many of their offerings."}
{"text":"Had the acai bowl and the Flu Shot juice. Service was fairly quick and friendly, and it got pretty packed for a business day in the morning.   The acai bowl was standard and nothing special, but also nothing bad about it. If you are craving an acai bowl, you'll probably be satisfied with the one here.   The Flu Shot is worth getting. It's terrible, but good. You almost have to hold your breath when you drink it because of the intense flavors, but it feels like you're done something good for your immune system... I mean, I hope so, otherwise what's the point of the suffering? But really, give it a try."}
{"text":"I had an iced tea and the 'tie the knot' salad and it was phenomenal. Loved the combo of the fresh vegetables and soba noodles."}
{"text":"What an awesome place! My friend lives in Optima Sonoran and I was visiting this past weekend and was able to check this place out while working out at his gym! The stuff here is pricey, don't get me wrong. But, boy is it good! I had a Green Dragon juice, which said it had jalapenos in it. When I asked the girl behind the counter how spicy it was, she said it varies with the batch since they're made fresh, but if I tried it and it was too much for me, I could switch it for whatever I wanted (it had quite a kick but was good). I also needed some breakfast, and the girl said their breakfast burritos (soy chorizo, beans, regular or sweet potatoes, etc) were extremely popular, so I grabbed one of those. The burrito was delicious, VERY flavorful! They will heat up the food for you if it's out of the fridge. Everything tastes super fresh. Overall, my total was 19 dollars - so NOT cheap for a juice and a burrito, but for something super fresh and healthy - I'd be willing to spend this once in a while... probably not an everyday stop, though. My friend mentioned that they turn into a bar later in the evening and have a happy hour, too! Such a cute spot!"}
{"text":"I can't say I can rate the food as I never got the chance to try it but the service I received this morning rates 0 stars. I found myself here while waiting for an appt in Old Town  Scottsdale, and after overcoming a bit of sticker shock at the menu,  I decided to see what a $10 16 Oz smoothie tastes like. Alas, I never got the chance. Although I was the only customer in line, the counter server- who never greeted me- could not seem to tear herself away from a conversation with some customers in the small dining area behind me. Ad I was inconveniently in her line of vision, she had to talk over my head, poor thing. For about 5 full minutes. As I patiently waited. Even though i was directly in front of her i just could seem to catch her eye (or ear, with a little 'ahem'.) Finally I decided the $10 smoothie probably wouldn't be worth any real effort to get it (especially on my birthday, when I give myself permission to be truly lazy)-- and I quietly walked out. If she took any notice at all, I imagine the counter lady (owner? Who knows...) probably said, in Scottsdalese 'Omg, like, what was HER problem?  On the basis of the service alone (or in my case, rather, the lack of any, which I consider a type of rude unprofessionalism), I would definitely steer anyone away from stopping in here."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing service.  Sam is the best.  Can't recommend this place high enough if you're looking for healthy delicious food.  And you might wanna do yoga or spinning why you're there."}
{"text":"Delicious food, healthy eats. I had a protein bowl w/ chx. It was very filling and delicious. Had it with the ginger miso sauce. I also had a turmeric ginger shot. Definitely gave me a boost."}
{"text":"Love!  So hip and very accommodating. They added our own protein powder in their already amazing smoothies with no problem and with a smile.  Best smoothies I have ever had !! I had the Universal. Total yum!"}
{"text":"So, I went in to get takeout with a friend. We were both pretty excited - she doesn't eat meat or dairy and I'd told her about the breakfast burrito with veggie chorizo, and I wanted those gluten free protein waffles.   Anyway, we order it to go and get back to my house- her burrito has cheese and meat in it, and it came with some whitish pink sour creamy smelling mayo looking sauce. Needless to say she threw the whole thing away.  My waffles? None of the coconut whip which is what I was most excited about. Literally the biggest waste of money in our life."}
