{"text":"My husband and I tried Drexyl during AZ Restaurant Week.  We sat at the bar due to the restaurant being so crowded.  There is a nice large bar which made us decide to come back again soon for their happy hour.  A lot of the restaurant seating was booths, which is always  nice because it seems like so many restaurants put the tables SO close together that you can't even have a conversation with the person you came with!  The service at the bar was awesome.  There were 3 bartenders working and they all served us and spoke to us at one or more times during the evening.  They were all very friendly, attentive, and welcoming, which makes for a much better dining experience at the bar.  And the food was spectacular!  My husband had the gnocchi for his appetizer and it was SO GOOD (he let me taste)!  I had the salmon salad for my appetizer which was also very good.  We both had the halibut as our entrée and it was delicious, especially the way it was prepared with a corn mash (polenta actually) and a cherry tomato topping.  He had the roasted banana and milk chocolate bread pudding for dessert, and I had the spice milk chocolate pot de crème.  Both were amazing!!  We are definitely going back again soon, without a doubt."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and i have only been here once and we both got the pork chop. The brussell sprouts with bacon are very good. I like the tenderness of the brussell sprouts. The pork entree was good and reminded me of the Honeybaked hams i had for Easter as a kid. 
The decor is nice but i think the giant TV's distract. I was in a booth yet the glare of the tv was imposing and that glare also bounced off glass by the booth. Thats why i took a star off and gave this restaurant 4 stars.
I love the employees button down checkered blouses.
It seems to be well run. The manager is constantly on the move and seems involved in all the goings ons. I was impressed just watching him!"}
{"text":"Sadly disappointed on Saturday night. Terrible service, had to flag down a waiter after 15 minutes. Had to inquire about the menu as the waiter didn't seem interested in introducing us to the options. Waiter mentioned that all food was 50% off. Had to remind her of that when she presented the bill.  Owners not interested in customers that they were not already acquainted with. When an owner did come to the table after recognizing that we were less than excited about his new place, he just kept saying \"I'm sorry\" without any inquiry as to why we were disappointed. When asked \"what are you sorry for\" he just kept repeating \"I'm sorry.\" Too bad, had high hopes for a new restaurant in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Paul and his team provide excellent service in a great environment.  The \"rat pack\" music sets just the right mood.  We came for the dessert and the Chocolate mousse was FABULOUS!!! Chocolate, hand whipped cream, cinammon, and a hint of chili; complex, subtle, and AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"Service is great. Food is weak. I had a Caesar salad and they forgot the cheese. The lettuce was limp. The frys were ok but the 4 sauces tasted like plastic. They need to have a more inventive menu. They need to embrace some unique tastes that are sumptuous. Presently it doesn't even rate above McDonald's."}
{"text":"Food and service were great! Not crowded but got seated by the only other people on the upper level and they were sooo loud and vulgar. Will come back though to give it another shot."}
{"text":"Mysteriously empty on a Sunday night when every other nearby restaurant was full.  Not sure why it wasn't busy, it was Final Four tournament weekend. Maybe it is because it's a fairly new restaurant. 

We were a party of 5 and were seated immediately.  The waiter was very attentive and kept the drinks coming, clearing the empties promptly.  The wine list is not long but included some very nice California wines. 

Food arrived promptly. I had the filet and it was one of the best steaks I have had recently, butter tender with a nice glaze and perfectly done, nicely plated with garlic mashed potatoes and grilled vegetables.  For Scottsdale the prices were reasonable. 

Every one in my party enjoyed their food, from pasta to a cheese burger.  They smoke their meats and fish in house. I will have to visit again when I return to Scottsdale and try the ribs."}
{"text":"Changing my review because of my last visit. Drexel has made a huge change, the service. What a difference a few months make. I was greeted by Paul as soon as I stepped in the door, was ask where we wanted to sit, and was seated promptly. Last time, I had to wait for almost 20 minutes while the restaurant was half empty. The place is very modern and the cocktails top notch. My food was very good, the vegetables were delicious although the fish was a little over done. Will definitely be coming back to try some other dishes. Highly recommend this place. So glad it's an option for me again."}
{"text":"Only reason i am giving 2 stars is because the first time we visited was great, happy hour had great offerings and it was reasonably priced. Our dinner visit was a different story.

We arrived 10 minutes before our reservation and were told to grab a drink in the bar until our table was ready. 25 minutes later we had to go visit the host stand to ask about our table and by the looks of confusion on all their faces they had clearly forgotten about us.

it took the server a full 15 minutes to come to our table at which time she asked if we wanted drinks despite our full glasses of wine on the table. We ordered an appetizer instead. chefs board, decent selection, the fig jam and herbed goat cheese is my favorite.

What we didn't realize is we should have ordered our entrees at the same time. even though we ordered our entrees right as the appetizer arrived they still took almost 35 minutes to get to our table. And they must have spent the entire time cooking the food because everything was borderline inedible. the pork chop was burnt, dry, and tough. accompanying macaroni was pure mush. as were the Brussel sprouts. Chicken on top of the pasta dish was dry and tough. and the prosciutto wrapped around it wasn't crispy at all. just hard and jerky like. The Marsala sauce on the pappardelle was ok, little too salty. 

we were offered a dessert menu but given how long entrees took and how terrible they were, we declined. although some brownie thing in a skillet that kept coming by smelled delicious. 

we will probably wait until this place can get on its feet before trying it again. waste of $120 and 2 hours."}
{"text":"Well we expected much more. Lobster bisque was funky and fishy. Sent back. Ordered Caesar salad instead. Really un-impressing and we have had our share of this salad. Not sure why it is even on the menu. We did have the chicken arancini appetizers I cannot remember the name of that were great but it is really a $6.00 appetizer happy hour food that should not be on the $49.00 per person menu. I had the shrimp and scallops. No seasoning at all. Very oily. Served with a lot of corn. My wife had the fillet. Cooked to my liking but she ordered medium and it was rare. Ordered a cocktail with a chunk of ice the size of the glass. Trendy and cool but for the price of the cocktail how about some cocktail. Desert (shared desert) we had the sorbet. In ice cream cones in an unstable ice cream cone holder and two giant soup spoons. Really? Messy, melty, tippy, ridiculous. Gave up after a few bites. Service was unorganized and staff seemed to be confused about who was doing what. Food came out way late after appetizers. Lots of apologies. We were offered bread when main course was delayed. No bread ever arrived. I don't even think they had bread. No one else had any. The crazy thing is they were not even that busy. Also started changing light bulbs in the ceiling on a ladder before the restaurant was closed. Unprofessional. But then, they have only been open about 10 days so maybe it will get better. May try happy hour but no more dinners. It is that easy to lose business. You need to do a better job than I can do service wise and with the cooking and presentation to win me and my hard earned money over. Best of luck. It is a tough business."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Food is amazing, the workers are fabulous. Definitely going back. The owner are amazing."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful dining experience at Drexyl's Restaurant tonight.  Started with a yummy Drexyl Marguerita.  Followed with the Chicken Arancini appetizer.  Then the Heritage Pork Chop.  What a wonderful meld of flavors.  The pork chop had a smoky flavor, was tender and cooked to perfection.  The apple butter, goat mac and cheese and bacon brussel sprouts all melted in the mouth.  We also had a great bottle of red wine - sorry I don't remember the name.  Was fortunate to be with a party who decided to share all three desserts.  All were great AND the Salted Caramel Brownie was out of this world.

Everyone was very friendly and helpful and in particular our server Josh did a FANTASTIC job being attentive, knowledgeable and gracious.

Great job Drexyl's. Definitely recommend and will return."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner with my hot date. I had the filet which was perfectly cooked and the lobster topper was awesome. She had the scallop which she loved. Great desert!  This is a swanky joint so dudes leave your tank tops and jean shorts at home! Happy hour is incredible! Great drinks...Moscow Mule and Drexyl Margarita were superb!!"}
{"text":"Service was super slow. We arrived 15 minutes before happy hour ended and was never served before 6 PM, but server still gave us happy prices since we didn't have an opportunity to order. Drinks...Old Fashioned's were excellent. Ordered the filet \"pink on the inside\" and it was raw and in a pool of blood. Had to send back for additional cooking. The halibut is very reasonably priced, but was just OK. Had the feeling it was frozen, not fresh, can't be sure. The table next to us, a mom and her son, got \"lost in the shuffle\". Someone finally help them after a really long time. We had an appetizer, main course and dessert and they still had NO food when we departed. Everyone was very nice and professional, my pleasure the words of the evening, but still lots of kinks in the service. Hope they make it, since in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Drexyl does it again!
I was at the soft open and remember thinking, \"This place has definitely has the elements of a great restaurant. The menu pairs unique flavors with comforting favorites. I absolutely loved the decor! Together, they have created a vibrant dining experience.\"
I eagerly looked forward to returning Friday for the opening night. They again provided quite the culinary treat, and had even improved. They refined the food and service and added finishing touches to the setting. I cannot wait to return to the scene in coming weeks."}
{"text":"The sandwiches and burgers were great, the ambience is phenomenal and the food and drinks were on point!"}
{"text":"I've had cheap meals and expensive meals, the difference is the $100 MEAL I truly enjoyed was cheap. The $20meal that I gave away was expensive. Tonight's  meal was cheap. Elliot,  our server was special. ...thanks. sz"}
{"text":"The service was exceptional 

Kitchen was a little slow considering it was a Tuesday night

But the food was worth the weight"}
{"text":"Went to Drexyl last night for anniversay dinner and enjoyed it all.  Decor is stylish, and traditional while still being hip.  Hubby ordered fettucine bolognese which he rated very flavorful.  He really enjoyed it.  I ordered smoked pork chops.  Sides were extremely delicious:  seared brussel sprouts were crispy and flavorful.  I hesitated on them due to bad rap brussel sprouts have, but they were delicious.  Goat cheese pasta was cooked exactly right with right amount of very tasty sauce to pasta.  Pork chop is a double chop and therefore inside too pink for me.  Waiter happily took it back to broil some more and then it was fine and not dry.  It is served with a yummy apple butter!  Large portion - I took much of it home.  Prices reasonable for Scottsdale:  we came in at $76 including drinks and tip.  Great dining experience and I recommend you try it!"}
{"text":"This place is so good! Superb food and excellent ambiance. For starters we had the chicken arancini. I highly recommend this dish, can't do it descriptive justice...just try it. For the main course I enjoyed the chicken pasta dish. The chicken was juicy inside with a crispy outside. My husband had the burger, also very good with a soft bun and a tasty garlic aoli. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We all loved our food. The halibut was SO good!"}
{"text":"Met a friend there for lunch. It was perfect! 
Staff is very friendly and professional. 
Service was attentive. Food was pretty good. I had the chicken club sandwich with homemade chips. 
I'd definitely like to try their happy hour and dinner menus too. The vintage drink offerings looked amazing."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. Happy hour specials are great to split, pretzels are my favorite. Staff is friendly and helpful. Great location and lots of screens for different sports games. Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I hopped over to Drexyl for dinner a couple of nights ago in an attempt to squeeze Restaurant Week into our hectic schedule. Drexyl was great! 

We each opted to order off the prix fixe menu. I had the duck tostadas, shrimp and scallops, and pumpkin brûlée cheesecake for dessert. The flavor of the tostadas was excellent, although they were a little on the cold side when they were served. The shrimp and scallops were delish! Cooked to perfection and served alongside Mexican street corn and cilantro pesto and mole sauces. Yum! Lastly, the pumpkin brûlée cheesecake was pretty much all of my favorite desserts in one, so I'm sure you could guess it was ah-mazing. 

My fiancé ordered the pork belly gnocchi, salmon and garlic noodles, and matcha panna cotta. Gnocchi was top notch, served with goat cheese mousse and figs. The salmon was great; however the noodles were sort of served in a store-bought clump. And lastly, matcha panna cotta was an absolute delight, especially with its miso butterscotch and sesame seed brittle. Yum again!

Service was prompt and attentive, wine list was plentiful, and the attention to detail with flavor combinations was top notch. We will return!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here earlier this week and impressed by food and decor. Inquired about Happy Hour and was given hours. 
Arrived at 4:45 tonight(Saturday) with a group of 6 people and was met at the locked door by a manager who advised they were closed for a \"corporate event\"..
What genius closes a new restaurant on a Saturday night?
It will be a while before we come back."}
{"text":"They did a nice job remodeling the old Bloom location at Gainey Village so we had high hopes for this new place.  Sat down and ordered drinks and Lobster Bisque.  The soup came out immediately but no drinks for a long time.  I ordered a Margarita but was served a Manhattan.  No server to be found...for a long time...so I took the drink to the bar where one bartender told me he'd fix it and the other one argued about it.  Finally a female bartender intervened and assured me that they would fix it.  They did, but it took a long time.  The Lobster Bisque served  lukewarm was disgusting.  It tasted like pumpkin soup with a few soggy tasteless chunks of something resembling lobster.  The entrees (pasta, reuben, steak salad) were not great and it took forever to get them.  We ran out of beverages multiple times throughout the evening and the server was consistently absent. To make matters worse, there were three or four \"suits\" (managers/owners/investors?) visible on the floor the entire time.  They made zero table visits and talked to no customers.  They just walked around in a little pack and appeared to be completely oblivious to disaster around them.  When the bill came I was shocked to see that they actually charged me for the drink that they made incorrectly.  With all the dining choices in Scottsdale, I can only say, don't waste your time or money at this place."}
{"text":"Great meal.  I had the short rib.  Outstanding.  Seared to a nice crispy exterior but tender and juicy on the inside.  The wasabi mashed were the bomb, worth the visit alone.  The Brussels sprouts with candied bacon were wonderful.  My wife had the scallops and shrimp.  The Mexican corn with mole and pesto were great contrasting flavors.  The cocktails were average, but the rest of the meal was outstanding!"}
{"text":"Great happy hour, good service, pretty good food. Bartender was very good and fun. The restaurant is clean and looks nice. I hope it stays. This location has changed often."}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  I had the chicken club for lunch and it was probably the best chicken club I have ever had!  Plus, the staff is amazing.  They really do a great job and I can't wait to go back and try more items.  Oh, I also met the owner Josh.  He is so passionate about what he does.  When was the last time the owner of a restaurant actually came up to you as you were leaving asking how everything was and REALLY meant it?  This is a great place and I can't wait to go back and try their dinner menu."}
{"text":"Went last night for happy hour/dinner. Had the double cut smoked pork chop, oh..my..god. will definitely be back again for that! I eat out most nights and love to try new places and this is a beautiful new addition to scottsdale. Excellent service as well and loved the drexyl margarita. My friend had the sole and really liked it. My chop came out very juicy and medium to medium well, but the bartender said they can cook it any way you want. May try it medium rare next time."}
{"text":"Excellent food and wine and ambiance. Had the halibut and finished every last bite! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Fair at best  slow service   food was average and not very tasty   it was opening night so much room left for improvement"}
{"text":"Disappointing. The first thing you see on their website is \"voted best new restaurant\" so I had high expectations. Unfortunately, both the food and service were just so-so.  Unexciting food (agreement of all 4 diners), over-cooked but cold halibut, requests about dietary restrictions botched, and requested bread forgotten. We all agreed that we had no desire to return."}
{"text":"I admit, I am generally pretty nice to restaurants and write nice reviews when they might not fully deserve all that is said.  With Drexyl Restaurant,  it deserves all the accolades I can say about it!  I went tonight for dinner with a total party on nine.   The decor is very new, modern and very nice.  The hostesses were very friendly and helpful.  Our Server Sam was great and provided excellent service.  We ordered a number of drinks, appetizers, entrées and desserts and EVERYONE could not stop praising the food and thanking me for selecting this restaurant.  I wish I had something constructive to say, but the only thing I can say is GO TRY THIS RESTAURANT!!!!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I took a visiting friend to Drexyl for dinner -- happily, we arrived in time for Happy Hour and saved some bucks! Bottom line: good food in a very cool environment. Yes, we'll be back."}
{"text":"Attractive and loud with seriously disappointing food. My lemongrass Caesar salad was tasty, but the lettuce was wilted. My husband's sole had sat around so it tasted oily and hard, rather than tender and moist. My half roasted chicken was deeply salty, too much brining or it was pumped commercially to stay moist. The peach BBQ sauce was delicious, as were the mini potatoes. Bravo for using a fresh peach with grill marks. But points off because, it not being peach season, the fruit was hard and tasteless. Switching to a canned peach at this time would be preferable. The citrus marmalade on the blood orange crime brulee was delicious, even if it made the sweetness over the top. Because this is a convenient neighborhood place, We may give this another try. I know which dishes to skip (the chicken). We were in a large group, although the rest of the restaurant was empty."}
{"text":"I informed my server that I was an experienced yelp reviewer aka food critic and I've been to basically every restaurant in North America and let me tell you this one was by far the best. The only issue have is I feel like they were discriminating against me and my beefy, heavy-set frame. The staff was very accommodating however and provided extra virgin olive oil from the kitchen to help grease me up and get me and my rascal scooter through the door. Overall 5/5"}
{"text":"Food is fantastic!  Best atmosphere and great menu.  Happy hour is amazing.  I would come here many times over."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere and a fun menu to match! I was visiting a friend in Scottsdale and I wish we had this restaurant back at home. We went with a group and shared the chefs plate and arancini balls as a started. Both were fabulous - the spicy and sweet in the arancini was perfect. 

I ordered the ahi tuna salad and a side of the goat cheese pasta for dinner. The tuna melted in my mouth, some of the best that I've had. The goat cheese pasta was delicious as well! My husband ordered the Ruben and brussel sprouts. He said the brisket on the rebuen was cooked perfectly. The sprouts were a little overcooked, but overall still pretty good. 

If you have room for dessert you MUST get the salted caramel brownie. Amazing! We also shared the gelato. It was fun that they served it in cones, but it's a little hard to share that way. The coconut flavor was my favorite and I normally never like coconut!

I wish I could come back sooner! This place is fantastic!"}
{"text":"We ventured into Drexyl last night after changing our minds about another restaurant. And, we're glad we did.
The menu is awesome, with choices that range from appetizers, salads, sandwiches and burgers to entrées. 

I ordered the halibut, which was served with charred bok choy, forbidden rice, shiitake mushrooms and a delicious coconut curry sauce. Every part of my dinner was divine.

My husband had the Pacific Coast Sole, which was served with lemon sauce and capers, fresh vegetables and petite potatoes. It was absolutely delicious, as well.

The room is open, comfortable and not pretentious.
The managers were working the room and ensuring all the guests were pleased with their meals. 

The prices are very fair considering the high quality of the food. 

I highly recommend Drexyl. We feel like we found a real treasure, and will be back!"}
{"text":"It's a relatively new place but they impress in every area

First is the bar- remodeled from the previous place it's open, decorated and has a homey feel.  The cocktail menu has a few twists on classics- if you a whiskey person like me, the old fashion with a hint of smoke is definitely the way to go.  If sweeter is your thing then I actually enjoyed the modified cosmo with lemon and a splash of champagne.

The food delivers as much \"wow\" as the cocktails.  The Mahi sandwich had a generous portion of fish with some great seasoning.  Top it off with hand cut fries you have a perfect and affordable meal.

Just forgot to mention the Cesar salad, Which again was top notch.  Not to much dressing, fresh anchovies and croutons that were actually crunchy and not soggy 

Now the best part- I'm probably not describing this correctly but a home made chocolate pudding with the slightest hint of ancho chili with a biscuit on the bottom.  Trust me it's worth trying.  

Great job overall and have been back a few times"}
{"text":"I'm excited about this place, especially living right around the corner.  I stopped by yesterday in leui of going grocery shopping. I chose mid-afternoon to watch tv, grab a snack and a sunday cocktail. 

The happy hour is pretty legit.  Wines are $3 off, cocktails are $3 off, and beer $2 off, making most drinks around the $7-8 range --- i wouldnt necessarily say great for happy hour drink prices, but considering the nice wine selection and finely crafted cocktails (not well liquors).  The food on thier happy hour though, looks delish.  I had the crispy chicken sliders, full of flavor, pretty filling, and for $8 an awesome steal.  I looked at thier full menu and i'll be back for a lobster roll - i'm thinking probably within the week.  Yes, it was one of those places that i want to return to ASAP.  I think this place has sticking power.  There have been a lot of in-and-out restruaunts in this location, but I hope Drexyl sticks around.  I heard the bartender say that lunch will be offered soon also. I can't wait!!"}
{"text":"We were very disappointed with our first visit here. While we liked the decor and the menu choices, the execution of our dinner was poor. We were given the wrong appetizer and both of our dinners were missing key ingredients that were listed on the menu (steak frites salad but missing the frites for example). This was not even noticed by our server. What annoyed my husband most was not allowing us to sit at one of several empty larger tables. We were given a cramped table and the other empty ones were never filled with customers during our time there."}
{"text":"I combined two appetizers to make a satisfying and reasonably priced meal.  The vegetable chowder (soup of the day), and halibut tacos were amazing--very fresh, vivid seasonings and creative presentation.  Combined with a happy hour James Bond martini and I'm in heaven.  Decor is terrific--beautiful floors, walls, etc.  multiple surfaces that harmonize beautifully.  Service was terrific--imagine 10 separate checks for members of a book club.  Thank you Drexel--I'll be back!"}
{"text":"The ahi tuna tacos are phenomenal on the won ton cracker!! Also, I recommend trying the lobster roll and also the fresh pappardelle, great ambiance, great service, beautiful restaurant!!"}
{"text":"We came back for happy hour and were happy.  Drinks were reasonably priced. Food was still good. Service was great!"}
{"text":"Hubby made reservations here for my birthday dinner. The hostess greeted us w/a big smile and a warm welcome. She was the best part of the evening. 

There is nothing really wrong about this place, but there's nothing really right about it either. Everything was \"fine.\" But in Scottsdale, you have to be better than fine to impress or even to survive. 

Waiter was ok but seemed pretty distracted and perhaps overwhelmed.  He handle our wine order but forgot to take drink orders for our young adult sons. We had to call him back to get them a beverage. Nothing wrong, just \"fine.\" 

I had prime rib -- cooked perfectly but a big vein of sinew running through it spoiled it for me. Served w/mashed potatoes and steamed veggies. Yeah, \"fine.\" others in our party had filet and proclaimed, \"it's good.\"  We had desserts as well -- brownie sundae, cheesecake, chocolate bananas foster. All good, nothing special.  

I'll forget this place in a minute and I won't recommend it to anyone whose looking for a great place to dine.  But if you're looking for \"fine\" ....."}
{"text":"What a great new addition to the Gainey Ranch area. We dined last night with another couple and had such a great dining experience. The food was delicious and the owner Chris was so personable and friendly. The 20's vibe is so cool and it has an awesome large bar in the center. Whether if you are visiting from out of town or live in the area you will be made to feel just like family. 
Great job DREXYL!!
Wishing you many years of success."}
{"text":"Open a week and the beginning is excellent. Out happy hour test has convinced us that we will return for dinner"}
{"text":"We've been here several times and always thought it was a very good place. This Saturday we come in. The place is dead. My daughter got a Caesar's salad and found a 2 inch piece of plastic in it and while the waitress was embarrassed and apologized, the manager couldn't get off his butt to come to our table. This restaurant will be gone very soon.

Turns out, Drexyl closed soon after and opened as a new restaurant"}
{"text":"First off the service was amazing, attentive but not overbearing, informative and most importantly very pleasant. Numerous questions required visits to others with more knowledge and all were answered clearly and promptly.

All of the food was good to quite delicious, however the pricing is beyond what Scottsdale will tolerate with the number of very good and not quite as pricey offerings in town.

The rye old fashioned was very tasty although $12 for a tumbler with the now hipster single massive cube of ice and maybe, at very most, 3 ounces of liquid left me feeling cheated. Thankfully they did fulfill my request for TWO of the dark cherries (which ended up being Luxardo cherries even though they are not listed that way on the menu.)

We ordered the chicken arancini as an appetizer and when they came out we knew all the portions were going to be very small and overpriced....artfully arranged plate with four, less than golf ball sized, arancini with a tablespoon of very tasty tomato jam, a tiny amount of cilantro cream and four paper thin and minuscule pieces of dried/candied jalapeno for $9. Okay it doesn't sound that expensive right, it was just that the arancini themselves were not that interesting, only the accoutrements which were in short supply.

They split a wedges salad for us in the kitchen (nice touch) and it was very, very good, however with a few tweaks it could be stellar. One issue is that the candied bacon was about too smokey (they smoke it in house) AND that it was chopped up so fine it was like crumbs - no slab or thick cut bacon texture really. We want to see and feel that baconness... A nice add was the roasted tomatoes. The other issue is that all of the toppings were in separate little piles and not strewn about the salad imparting the flavors all over the wedge. If that salad either had all the toppings dropped all over the salad OR it were brought out in it's wedge form and then tableside chopped up and served like a chopped salad it would have been fantastic! Having to scoop up all the bits from the piles was too hard to get the mixture of ingredients right per forkful. 

My order for dinner was the Tuna Taco Trio appetizer using jicama as the shell instead of crisp shells. The flavor was good (not great because the tuna was a tad fishy as if they had not cut out that really dark, smelly line of the tuna.) It had a nice a sweet and spicy jalapeno syrup and decent (but not special) red cabbage slaw. However the price really was crazy. Where do they think this restaurant is - Beverly Hills? $12 for 3 tiny tacos that equaled 6 relatively small bites of food is ludicrous. It was doll sized tacos, really. 

The braised Asian short ribs were very tasty as well, nice tenderness and a not too salty and nicely rich sauce with garlic, ginger and sesame. The roasted carrots and Asian broccoli (long, thin, stalks like broccoli rapini) were perfectly cooked. It was again on the smaller size for a $27 entree, but not anywhere near as overpriced as the Tuna Taco Trio was.

We will return for lunch, probably on a Thursday in order to double dip on a much more reasonable menu pricing for lunch dishes (and a Korean Crispy Chicken Sandwich which sounds awesome and the 50% off on wines on Thursday. The Happy Hour pricing (3 to 6 pm) seems okay for the drinks but not particularly generous for the food specials."}
{"text":"If I could give more stars I would!! Absolutely amazing place! 

Two things really stood out to me.

First, the Deluxe Burger was THE BEST BURGER my boyfriend and I have ever had. You could tell with your first bite the quality of the meat was just beyond any other burger you can get in AZ. 

Second, the owner personally got up to open the door for us as we left...An owner with pride in his business truly does show and the service, food and atmosphere are amazing at this spot! 

Definitely coming back :)"}
{"text":"Beautiful place, nice bar.  Food average. Service average.
Atmosphere quiet, friendly staff."}
{"text":"We went before dinner was being served. Took part in happy hour menu. Disappointed with the chefs board as very little cheese on it. 
The brisket sliders were unbelievable. Moist and excellent with great bun. So good we had a second order. 
Service was outstanding and hostesses met you with a smile. 
Really looking forward to going back to order off dinner menu which starts at 5pm."}
{"text":"Owner is one of the most hospitable guys you will ever meet and very gracious.  He needs to find another way to make a living besides running a restaurant, though.  Mediocre is the kindest thing I can say about the place.  The owner clearly has no idea what he's doing.

Ordered a dry call brand Gin Martini up STIRRED (sorry James Bond, but that is the proper way to prepare a Martini served up). Undersized glass, short pour, and either they don't know how to mix drinks, didn't use the brand I specified, or they water down their booze.  Maybe all three.  Really poor quality of an easy cocktail.

I would have left right then, but I was a guest at a business dinner so I had to suffer through.

Our host ordered 3 orders of \"homemade\" chips and dip. Chips were stale.

I had a capresse salad. Pretty hard to hurt that.  However, it was pathetically skimpy. 4 grape tomatoes cut in half and 4 balls of mozzarella as big in diameter as a quarter.  Hardly worth the price charged.

For an entree, I had the pork chop accompanied by their brussels sprouts they are so proud of and Mac and cheese.

The place was hardly busy, but the waiter couldn't be bothered to bring us our dinners so the kitchen staff had to bring it out and play role call. That's fine if I am at some low price point chain.  At a \"better\" restaurant, I expect them to know who ordered what.  Really ruins the dining experience for me to have to play role call.

Asked if I need anything else, I answered that I needed a fork. (The waiter wasn't bright enough to realize that when he took my only fork on my salad plate because this place doesn't give you salad forks that I would need another one.) I waited and waited and waited, then finally got one myself from a neighboring table.  The owner saw me do it, apologized, and brought me another fork like somehow now having two forks made up for waiting forever and never getting the first one.

Pork chop was so tough it was inedible. Could have used it for a hammer to drive nails. The brussel sprouts tasted like they had been sitting around in a pan all evening.  The mac and cheese, well, how can you hurt mac and cheese?

There's more, but I think I've said enough to let the discerning diner know to choose elsewhere."}
{"text":"We had the Chicken Arancini and Chef's board for an appetizer.  Our entrees included the Halibut, Sole, Chicken and Cola Braised Pork (I loved the pork cheeks).  Everything including the red wine was exceptional.  The dishes all had something unique that created a marriage of flavors that you can not easily replace at another restaurant.  You will not be disappointed with the food.

The ambiance (we sat on the patio which is very nice but, the inside is also very warm and comfortable) is wonderful and the staff is authentic in their service, knows the menu and always has a smile.

With too many new restaurants claiming their own \"unique local experience,\" this place truly delivers on that promise and does it with authenticity and class - hats off to the ownership and management on their ability to deliver a product that exceeds expectations!"}
{"text":"Drexyl is not to be missed for so many reasons: 

First and foremost, the chef is incredibly talented: for appetizers our party of five shared the chef's board (charcuterie) which featured an amazing assortment of beautifully arranged delicious bites, of which, the goat cheese and fig jam were the highlights! We also shared the truffle oil orecchiette pasta which is made in house. We all agreed that this was one of the best bites we'd tasted in recent memory. Our entrees were all outstanding. We shared the salted Carmel brownie for dessert which was ooey-gooey in the middle and beautifully crusty on the top! Best dessert for all of us in recent memory, as its baked to order in a mini cast-iron pan and topped with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.

Second, the ambience of this place speaks to my heart. As a Scottsdale native, I appreciate the attention to detail paid to the mid-century modern decor which is elevated by historic framed pieces of art, featuring black & white photos of historic Scottsdale from the 1930's to 1950's. Super classy. Think Mad Men with AZ roots. 

Finally: our service was impeccable. From the hostess, to servers, to support crew, all were friendly, attentive and excited to be working at this great new restaurant. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"We were looking for something relaxing to do this weekend, so decided to check out Drexyl after I stopped into my office to pick up a few things.  First off, I love that their patio is pet friendly - bonus!  They also have a great happy hour too!  We enjoyed a Nolet 75 drink and a glass of red wine to get started and then shared the roasted brussel sprouts, goat cheese pasta, charcuterie and cheese board, chicken arancini and pretzel sticks with mustard and cheese dipping sauces.  The food was reasonably priced at happy hour and quite good too.  It was a great mix that worked as our dinner for the evening.  The service was fantastic and they really get the customer experience.  This location hasn't had much staying power for restaurants, but hoping Drexyl will be the exception."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, food was amazing, couldn't have gone to a better place to celebrate my moms birthday. The \"D\" Burger was perfectly cooked, happy hour menu is great as well. Coming back for sure."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is sort of a mix of classic and modern retro. On the night I was there the music in the background was very old fashioned like from the 30's or 40's and was sort of fun to listen to. This restaurant offers a stunning looking bar and an outdoor patio. The tables inside are a mix of high tops and low tops. The menu is sort of American with accents.

We started with the Ahi Tuna Trio of Tacos. They were yum and easy to eat with the light jicama shells. They had all the right flavors going on. This dish might have been a little pricy for what it was but was delicious anyway.

For dinner I had the Jade Pesto Halibut. It was interesting and different with the cilantro pesto and curry sauce. They gave me a generous portion of halibut that wasn't seared but was sweet, flaky and moist. All the vegetables and black rice were tasty too. I thought this was very much worth the $23.00 because nice halibut dinners at other places usually run $30-34 out so this evens out the appetizer we had.

My husband had the Cola Braised Pork. Overall he was very happy with his dinner. I didn't taste the potatoes but my husband said for him they were boarder line salty and he said for me they'd be much too salty.

The only thing slightly odd was the bread service. We saw all the other tables getting bread and we didn't get any so we inquired about that. We were told they don't serve it unless you ask for it. The bread comes from Wildflower Bread Company so if you like their product you might want to know about this.

Our server was very friendly, cheerful and efficient.

Overall very good and I plan to return."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a Thursday date night on a whim. I had the filet and my husband chose ribeye. My steak was a little on the rare side for me but still delicious and both of us were very pleased with the food. Wine selection was great too. Very courteous and professional wait staff. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"They have a fantastic happy hour menu.  I pretty much tried everything on it.  The drinks were good as well. 
I would recommend the chicken arancini and the ravioli. The ahi tuna was good as well. I also ordered a side of the brussel sprouts.

Service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Saturday night- not terribly busy.  Sat at the bar with a friend and had dinner.  ordered one of their 'vintage' mules and a burger.  The service was very good- the food I must say was delicious!  
I find the decor and concept a mismatch.  Drexyl...seems like it should be a furniture store.  Says Modern American- decor is very Jonathan Adler like- with vintage pictures around and Frank Sinatraeque music.  Just doesn't seem cohesive.  

That being said- the food and service were good- just a bit of an odd ambience."}
{"text":"Excellent food, wonderful staff and fabulous ambiance in the outside seating area surrounded with herb plants. Our party of 6 enjoyed a leisurely dinner with just the right level of attentive service. Waiter corked and served our wine and kept our water glasses full. Chicken arancini appetizer was exceptionally good. Halibut, sole, chicken and pork dishes were all interestingly prepared and delicious. Portions were just right.  Desserts are large portions. Six of us shared the salted caramel brownie and bread pudding and had plenty of sweet goodness to top our a wonderful meal. Plan to go back again very soon so we can try additional items on the menu! Hope"}
{"text":"The food was tasty, but the service was incredibly slow. We waited 1.5 hours for our appetizer to arrive, and when it did, they brought out the entree a few minutes later while we were still eating the appetizer! 
The main issue was that they charged us each (four of us) 3 times for our meal! We've tried calling several times, yet the issue still hasn't been resolved, and we're each out $150 for a $50 meal! Unacceptable!!"}
{"text":"Closed as of 3/25/18.  Closed for restructuring? But the phone still has a recording stating hours. Not sure what's up. Loved their happy hour."}
{"text":"Well..we have been here many times. Atmosphere and food always good. My salad, the farm chop, was a glorified house salad, lettuce, cucmber, tomato, slivered carrots and feta for $13. This time my daughter ordered a salad which she found a large piece of plastic in. Beyond unacceptable. The waitress replaced her salad for us while the manager sat at the bar and chatted up some lady. He should have  come over and apologized instead of sitting at the bar, which he didn't. The restaurant was DEAD. Two tables at 8:15 on a Saturday evening during season. Maybe if the management was better and the kitchen more conscientious the vibe would be better."}
{"text":"Brand new restaurant. Amazing menu, great food, service and ambiance. My second time eating here, the halibut with pesto was so fresh, cooked to perfection. The pork cheeks braised in coca cola were \"lick your plate\" amazing... along with the lyonnaise potatoes. The food and wines are reasonably priced, and very tasty but... save room for the brownie OMG! I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We had a great experience at Drexyl last night. The atmosphere was modern and warm, our server was friendly and attentive, and our meal was delicious.  

We started with cocktails and an appetizer. The shrimp ceviche was fresh, well prepared with the right amount of spice and served with warm, homemade chips. The classic Negroni cocktail with Campari was the perfect complement, even though it was ordered up in a martini glass and came with a giant ice cube in a high-ball glass. (I'd want it that way next time) For dinner we loved the house salads with goat cheese and the recommended entrees, smoked pork chop and cilantro-pesto halibut. We enjoyed the coffee ordered with the NY cheesecake, which was excellent and appeared to be house made. It was not as described on the menu, however. My wife loves cheese cake but not with fruit sauce. The menu describes the topping as caramel, chocolate and nuts. Ours came with a fresh raspberry drizzle, which I loved, but the cheesecake is her favorite. 

We will go back and definitely recommend Drexyl. They have a good happy hour, a large bar and big-screen TVs."}
{"text":"If you read the Yelp reviews, there are haters and friends and relatives.Of course, they love this place. Drexyl is quite ambitious. Not ready for Prime Time. Food and service are not up to par.The remodel is beautiful and it has a nice clientele. But some things are really lacking. It reminds me of Cuttlefish. And they are no longer around. Lastly the menu and the execution of the food needs to improve.It seems the bar is more important than what comes out of the kitchen


Wow. This place has really gone down the toilet. But we knew it was going to happen. It's a rudderless ship. No real management. Food is mediocre at best. Menu is not inviting.  Ugh!!!"}
{"text":"Went there with some of my gal pals to celebrate a birthday during happy hour.  Sam was our server, who was very friendly and efficient.  Since there was five of us, we ordered the 
DREXYL FRIES & DIP sea salt fries with the parmesan cheese, CHICKEN ARANCINI, AHI TUNA TACO TRIO, DREXYL SLIDERS, and the PORK BELLY.  Since all alcohol, including the bottles of wine, were half price, we ordered a nice bottle of pinot noir, which is normally $65/bottle.   A very good bottle and well worth it.   Sorry I don't know which wine it was.   One gal pal ordered the Manhattan.   She said it was very good.   

I loved the fries.   The menus said it comes with three dips, but all we received was ketchup.   I didn't try the chicken arancini nor the drexyl sliders, but they did say they were quite tasty.   I liked the pork belly although I could have done away with the pork fat.   Maybe just cut it off before serving??   The flavoring was perfect, and the mashed potatoes were, well, what mashed potatoes.   Nothing particularly special about them.   

Since it was a birthday bash, we had the creme brulee and brownie with ice cream.   The brownie was delish!   The creme brulee, not so much.   Basically so-so.

I had gone prior for a private party, and had the soft pretzels with their melted cheese.  The cheese was good, but what can one do with store-bought soft pretzels. ...

I would return for happy hour.  I like the ambience, food, and the service.   The manager stopped by our table.   Since I am bad with names, I am sorry that I don't remember who it is.   That was nice to have her stop by."}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food.  We just stopped in to look at the menu and ended up staying.  The restaurant is beautiful and we were very comfortable in a booth.  We enjoyed the  Ahi Tuna Taco Trio and Smoked Salmon for starters and then the Caprese Salad and Seared Salmon Salad for dinner.  Nice portions and the flavor was great!"}
{"text":"I was here with one of my Yelp friends for happy hour and had a nice time.  The restaurant has a very hip and stylish decor and I love the large bar.

We sat at the bar and had a few appetizers and drinks.  The chicken arancini, fried ravioli and sliders were all good and fairly priced at $5-8 each.  I think my favorite was the ravioli because it was fried perfectly and had a really tasty sauce.

Drinks are $2-3 dollars off the regular prices for beer, wine and cocktails.  I was happy to be able to enjoy one of my all-time favorite beers here a Sculpin IPA.

Service was very good at the bar and I expect to return in the near future!"}
{"text":"Came here for date night. Really enjoyed the food and service. They have a classic American menu with some unique twists."}
{"text":"After hearing much positive feedback about Drexyl my wife and I decided to check out the place. We had a 8:30 reservation on Saturday night arrived and seated within 10 minutes. We ordered a cocktail which is the only reason this is one stars instead of zero. Which I can not due. The bartenders now how to make smart simple drinks that look great.(big fan of ice specific cocktails) then we got to the food and service the food was not even warm all three courses the pork belly and the pork cheeks where both room temperature. The pastries where terrible as I informed my server using the word terrible when asked to which I just got a mute stare for a minute.the sever that I saw twice once when he took our order in the beginning of the evening and once to let him know how poorly executed desserts where and that the coconut gelato was not coconut at all, but poor vanilla ice cream. There are many other complaints and comments I would add but it will go on deaf ears. The general some of my review is that I felt like I wasted $100 last night."}
{"text":"Our party of six made a spontaneous decision to dine at Drexyl last Tuesday evening and had a less than mediocre dinner experience.  

We started second guessing our decision when we noticed very few other diners in the restaurant upon arrival, but stuck it out because we were already seated, we were all hungry, and it was getting late (especially for a \"school night\").  

Our waiter was nice enough, but unfortunately the food quality and the handful of menu items that they were out of that night were out of his control.  (A bottle of wine, a steak, and another side item or two).  The spinach dip appetizer we ordered to start looked and tasted like it had been sitting out for hours, so luckily they replaced it with a fresh one, which was good but nothing to write home about.  

For a group that came in hungry, no one finished their meals... from my salad with chicken to my friend's meatballs, my husband's pork chop, another friend's chicken salad and another scallop dish, nothing was that great.  The only wins were the wine and beer, brussels sprouts and french fries, and that's just because I really don't want to be a complete \"Debbie Downer\" in this review.

Maybe we were there on a super off night, but sadly, I don't think so.  Needless to say, we won't be back to find out anytime soon."}
{"text":"We had an absolutely lousy dining experience there on Friday night. The service was terrible. We arrived at 7:30. The place was never more than half full, so it was perplexing that we had to wait forever for our drinks. And by \"forever\" I mean our first course arrived before the drinks did. My kingdom for a glass of water! 

The soup in no way resembled Lobster Bisque other than there was some flavorless fish in the center of the bowl. It would be better named \"Luke Warm Pumpkin Soup\". Except ours was cold. 

When our drinks finally did arrive a la one of the bartenders because our waitress was still MIA, one of our drinks was wrong. Mind you, we ordered a beer, a diet coke, some water and a margarita. Hint: Margarita's don't contain sweet vermouth. We waited and waited for our server to reappear to fix the situation, but rather than dry up and die, my friend went to the bar to get the correct drink.  Two of the bartenders argued with her that it was the right drink. Seriously. They argued over a drink. Thankfully, the head bartender stepped in, saw immediately that the drink was wrong and fixed it. She was the only person in a room full of servers, bartenders, managers, owners and investors who knew how to do her job.

Next, the main course. Which arrived ONE HOUR after we finished our soup. ONE. HOUR. In a restaurant that was by this time, 1/4 full.  The child sitting at the bar got his food though.  

The food was actually quite good. That's why they got even one star. Everyone was happy with what they ordered.  Except that we still had no waitress.  We just kept stopping different waiters/waitresses to ask for refills on water, and additional rounds of drinks.  All while staring at a minimum of 3 managers on duty including the GM. Hint for the many managers on duty: When you see a table of diners with empty glasses repeatedly looking around and finally flagging down different servers or heading to the bar to get water; you might want to make sure their waitress pays them some attention.

We waited and waited and waited for decent service. It never came.  We watched three employees stand there talking to two men at the end of the bar all night though. So we knew there were actually employees on staff.  They just didn't care about our table. When she finally showed up with the check, she pointed out all of the service fails on her part and hoped we'd come back sometime.

We did have a manager shout across the dining room as we left to \"have a good night\". Does that count as a table visit?

I can't recommend this place and don't believe they'll be in business 6 months from now based on our experience."}
{"text":"Food is well executed /presented, and a nice change from what you can get at every other restaurant in town. Ambiance & menu both bet get 5 stars! Great atmosphere. Ahi tacos and chicken sliders were two of my favorites so far! Can't wait to go back and get the bananas foster dessert and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and awesome service. Located in Gainey Village the spot has been several other restaurants that did not make it. The interior has been completely redone and it's very simple modern design is super cool."}
{"text":"This restaurant made our dream come true... the food was fantastic... We had the Chicken Anacini as starters... it was phenomenal... As for entree we had the Crispy Chicken Sandwich and it was phenomenal!!! Our service tonight was amazing!!! Adam was a great server with great recommendations and insight into the menu... To end the evening we had the Salted Caramel Brownie which was Adam's recommendations and YES it was out of this world!!!!!! Finally I cannot enfesize  more on this point that this restaurant is \"For Customer\" restaurant... the staff and food were 10 stars!!! Spend every amazing occasion or just go for an amazing evening to this restaurant and you would be extremely Satisfied!!!! 

Coming from San Francisco this restaurant is the next biggest thing for Scottsdale Arizona...."}
{"text":"Cool restaurant - but surprisingly, not busy during lunch at all. I ordered ahi tuna trio tacos and Brussels sprouts side. Everything was tasty, but I wasn't blown away. My friend ordered a beet salad with chicken. Her portion was generous but mine was not and our bill was the same = $20/pp excluding tip. I left hungry....

I think they should review portions and price for the tuna tacos and Brussels sprouts and if they increase the portions, I'd be happy to pay $20."}
{"text":"Fragile position.

Three months ago the Drexyl opened strong.  The food remains consistent but the hostess desk, service and managerial presence appear to be waning.  It would be a tragic instance to see the Drexyl fail on very remedially issues.  The Drexyl is easily a 5-star establishment if they can double the efforts on service and overly correct the hostess desk.

With that bad bit of flavor, let me attempt to correct any other concerns regarding the actual food.  Last night our party of four revisited and shared many of the core dishes that make up the Drexyl's menu.  

To start, the house specialty drink menu is creative.  I would like to see the Mixologists round out the offerings with more gin and vodka-based creations and resist the temptation to follow everyone else on a tequila/whisky trend, especially as the weather warms and bourbons start to sit heavier.  If you like floral gin, engulfed in the Mule.

In the Appetizer class, the Ahi Tuna Taco Trio is consistently very flavorful and a standout.  Many restaurants offer this dish but few handle the centerpiece fish as well as the Drexyl.  The tuna is lightly seared to perfection.  I highly recommend the crunchy wanton shell.  The Asian flavors are well balanced and the Drexyl doesn't miss the opportunity to kick off your meal with a near-braggadocio demonstration on how well they handle fish.  The only negative on this appetizer is that it only comes in orders of three (hence \"trio\") without the option to order individuals ala cart.  

I would like to see more offerings and effort toward innovation with the other appetizers but I cannot deny that the Fried Ravioli is enjoyable (but not especially cravable or memorable) and the Chicken Arancini is well balanced if the diner can find the delicious tomato jam and cilantro cream sparsely plated and camouflaged underneath these delicious risotto globes.  I wouldn't miss the raviolis from the menu if they magically disappeared but the Arancini could be expanded to seasonally-flavored options and perhaps paired with some cheese as the year progresses.

The main course is truly where the kitchen shines but the staff falls short.  Last night the restaurant was pushing a Hangar Steak with blue cheese crumbles and parsnip purée.  And I mean \"pushing\".  We did not order it as the waiter attempted to oversell the dish but showed his inexperienced cards by finishing his presentation with, \"served with a side of parsnip purée, whatever that is.\"  This is emblematic of the Staff inexperience that was later reinforced when I walked past a service bar en route to the restroom and overheard our waiter and another discussing their own frustration that they are asked to up sell items but don't feel like they even know what they are selling.  So a note to the Manager: FEED YOUR STAFF.  Start every night with a sample of the special and ask the chef to educate the staff on preparation and ingredients.  Any high end, successful restaurant does this and it translates well into sales when the patron trusts the staff.

Rant concluded.  Back to the food.

Do not miss the Pacific Sole.  It is such a delicate fish and so flavorful.  As I eluded to on the appetizer Tuna Taco Trio, the Drexyl chefs know how to handle fish and do so with precision.

The Papardelle was unexpectedly delicious.  Al dente wide noodles not overly dressed, beautifully complimented by tender roast chicken.  This dish is typically heavy but it ate like a lighter dish.

Cola Braised Pork Cheeks are deeply flavorful and tender.  A favorite if anyone is seeking a savory sweet fare.

And the biggest hit was the smoked Heritage Pork Chop with baconed Brussels sprouts and crumbles of truffle blue cheese.  It is clear that a lot of thought went into developing this dish and getting the balance just right.  Even though it is smoked, the meat is very juicy and tender while the putter crust is truly cravable (I want some now).

As others have said, the desserts are \"meh.\"  I never hide my bias, I don't have a sweet tooth and could easily pass on desserts when eating out.  However, they were ordered while I excused to the restroom to wash my hands.  The Brownie ala Mode was a fun presentation but quite honestly reminds me of a Duncan Hines Brownie mix outta the Easy-Bake oven.  The Bread Pudding is standard in composition but quite boozy (which I actually enjoyed but most would not).

Other reviewers have pointed out the noise and irradiated service.  I agree, the place is noisy but that adds to the hip vibe of the Phoenix dining scene.  The noise didn't prevent good conversation or leave us with our ears ringing at the end.  However, as the night wore on and the place began to thin out, the empty now-absent decibels could be pleasantly filled with some house music.

Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to return...for the food.  However, this disturbing trend of service decline must be fixed or good will will likely shift and patrons will readily spend elsewhere."}
{"text":"Went here for a 1st date. Great atmosphere...very chill and chic. Thursday's are 1/2 off...bonus! Only had wine, but enjoyed the wine and neighbors at the bar enough, will definitely go back to try more. Big TVs at the bar to watch games/TV. Intrigued to try the food. Will be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Fabulous dinner matched with fabulous service. The staff makes you feel like you're the only diner that matters. Excellent menu with something for everyone. Great ambiance, too!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this new restaurant! 

The plate presentation was gorgeous, the ambience is phenomenal and the food and drinks were on point! 

I would definitely recommend the tuna tacos, served in a crispy wonton, they can get a little crumbly but it is all worth the deliciousness!

Our table had a variety of entrées and all of them were delicious.

Come to Drexyl soon! You'll be happy you did."}
{"text":"The food easily earns this restaurant five stars, but the service is just terrible. 

To start with the positives - the hostesses were very pleasant. The dinig room has a nice, quiet atmosphere. The salmon salad is TO DIE FOR. The caramelization of the salmon steak is just fantastic. The vinaigrette is the perfect acidity to balance the flavors of the salmon and greens. 

We munched on several appetizers, including the fried ravioli, roasted brussel sprouts with candied bacon *yum*, and the Chef's Board. The salumi on the Chef's Board were exquisite. We were not offered bread - had we known, we probably would have asked for it, as the three small slices on the Board were not enough for the meats and cheeses provided. 

For the negatives - we had to ask for our waters to be filled. I should preface this with the fact that it was late evening, with very few diners around. It took over 10 minutes for someone to come by and check on us. We were never offered dessert, which we would have glady indulged in. We were also put off by the fact that our server (or a busser) did not pick up our plates after our dinner - it wasn't until we were paying the check that our empty plates were taken away. We would have spoken to a manager.. if we could have found one. 

If I start seeing reviews about service improvement, we'd try Drexyl again."}
{"text":"So glad we found this place! We went for a walk to the grocery store and stopped in for an early dinner. It was wonderful! From the Bruschetta appetizer, margarita, meals and drinks. Everything was great including the service!"}
{"text":"The new DREXYL, at The Gainey Shops, is truly, a new and very different \"take\" on American cuisine. Located in the footprint of where Bloom was, once upon a time, the resemblance stops there. The space has been completely renovated, from A to Y...as they decided to keep the glass walked, private dining room. Other than that, the whole look is contemporary, and yet, very welcoming. 
The Staff is young, happy to be there, and ready to please. Manager, Chris Mercato, is present and available to serve, solve any possible problems, and has a quiet, gracious attitude about it all.
The Menu includes \"comforting\" ingredients, prepared in a new, beautiful and delicious way! 
There is something for everyone at DREXYL. The attention to detail cannot be overstated either. Presentation is as good to look at as it is to eat!
Although DREXYL has only been open a few weeks, it is sure to be a regular stop for many, as the location is great! 
We had a drink at the bar before heading to our table. This bar is huge and stunning! I forgot to check out the outside patio, but something tells me it will be the place to be when the evenings are a tiny bit warmer here.
The ONLY reason I am not giving this 5 stars is because they ARE new. And what is fabulous now will only continue to improve over the next weeks and months.
Kudos to this young, talented, inspired group to come up with a huge hit their first time out.
You will NOT be disappointed with your entire experience at DREXYL. And don't forget dessert! I'm not telling, so you can be surprised with this little bit of deliciousness!"}
{"text":"HH menu is awesome.  We had the ahi tuna tacos (these were amazingly delicate and delicious), caprese salad, salmon, and pretzel sticks (you must order these).  Service was efficient and super friendly.  I would definitely come back.  The interior is beautiful and very modern.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The restaurant looks fabulous. That's where the fabulous stopped.

Came in for a late lunch and cocktails. Only two tables were occupied. Waited more than 10 minutes to get our drinks - they were sitting at the bar for 5 minutes before the server even brought them to us. My husband waited 8 minutes after finishing his drink before the server came by. They had more than enough staff walking around....doing nothing. One walked by looking at the dirty dishes on the table but didn't pick them up. We STILL had dirty dishes at the table when we left. 

Food is tasty but not enough to draw me back. 

There are too many great spots in Scottdale for us to consider going there again."}
{"text":"We were greeted at the door by two pleasant hostesses, and seated immediately. Décor was clean, stylish, and modern. Seats were comfortable. Ambiance was terrific. Server greeted us at our table, and drinks were great. wine list AWESOME- top to bottom, full of great selections. Pretzel sticks and salt and vinegar chips were tasty, and served warm/hot. Perfect. Burgers were fantastic (get extra fire and ice pickles if you can- they're amazingly tasty), as were the halibut, the salmon salad, and the desserts (brownie and gelatos were 'ne plus ultra'.) We were extremely pleased with the entire experience (we were visiting from out of town) and plan on coming back next time we are in the area. A winner for sure!"}
{"text":"This was a tough review because the food was well prepared and my Daiquiri (very old school traditional) was wonderful.  To the bad part, first off the food was good and well done, say 4 stars, but nothing was terribly memorable but that may have been because of the service issues.  It was pretty obvious the restaurant was under staffed.  For example, it took us about 30 minutes after we sat down to get drinks and the food came out sporadically.  It was just sort of painfully paced and the uncontrolled nature of the evening lead to additional issues like our bill being wrong, not having a fork when dinner came out and our DD consistently being out of ice tea.  As a side note, the place was also amazingly loud.  They need some soft surfaces or curtains to break up the noise, it left us with an uncomfortable dining experience.

Management was involved and helping but they needed more wait staff and probably another bartender; and because management was busy back filling for staff, no one every checked up on us.  Net-net, the problems were nothing that cant be fixed and maybe we just hit a bad night.  But I don't think I would invest the time and money to try them again for a full dinner, maybe happy hour."}
{"text":"Travien, Bradon and Sheyane best service we've experienced in a long time!  Thank you so much for being so kind and so attentive!  Food was just as amazing as the service!!!"}
{"text":"The food here is great! The service is even better! We popped in for breakfast and let the owner, Kelly know that we were in a time crunch. He personally went to the kitchen to ensure we would be out on time. The bartenders, Annette and Alyssa are so personable and make the experience fantastic! Breakfast was so great that we decided to come back for cocktails the same day! This place is a must, and we look forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Visited Drexyl twice- 1st for happy hour a few weeks ago, & 2nd for Restaurant Week this past Thursday.  Hh was fun!  Our bartender was friendly & talkative, & the appetizers we tried were all lovely & enjoyable!  

Truffle goat cheese orecchiette: Delicious, although the cheese sauce was \"wetter\" than I'd expected.  Tasty, but I probably wouldn't order it again, due to the sauce, as well as the small amount that was given. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ERyujCm_4MvL5KnYWwBKbQ&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA

Sliders- 1 brisket & 1 crispy chicken:  Preferred the chicken!  It was delicately battered & flash-fried & came with a pickled topping that reminded me of Asian flavors, particularly the Filipino pickled side salad \"achara.\"  Brisket was OK-- its meaty flavor & texture were underwhelming.  I was left craving for more chicken. https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=le6cKcwiBc6shAGhkDbeMw&userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA

Crispy ravioli:  Delicious fried ravioli (sorry, but a lot has happened since that hh, & I've forgotten what the filling was- gorgonzola?) on a lovely smoked yellow pepper cream sauce.  Easily my favorite of the 3 apps we tried.  But why only 3 pieces when there were 2 of us?  Did someone want to watch us fight for the 3rd piece??  Hehe.  That was my 1st & only taste of the app, as I was told it's been replaced w/ a smoked salmon dish- fail!

Fast-forward 20 days later, friends & I convened to try Drexyl's RW menu.  They both haven't been to Drexyl before, & this was my first dinner here.  I arrived early to snag a glass of wine during hh (& save a generous friend & I a few $$).  Bartender Trevon (sp?), who was upbeat & attentive, graciously gave me 2 wine samples when I asked (all in the 2 minutes before hh ended!).  Kudos to Drexyl for employing such a fun & amenable employee!

DK ordered 3 apps: https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/drexyl-restaurant-scottsdale?select=ByFFPbr58tJUjAQjjQABiw

Ahi tacos: They enjoyed these; I didn't sample.
 
Chicken arancini: They liked these, though JY wondered why chicken & not the traditional meat sauce & ragu?

Charcuterie board: Calabrese & soppresatta; havarti, herbed goat cheese (loved this!), & gorgonzola; pickled cuke chips, cauliflower (so good!), & garlic (OMG! Wished I could've had more than one!); fig sauce, candied pecans, croutons, & a strawberry.

My Handmade gnocchi: \"Fig braised pork belly w/ pearl onions, truffle goat cheese, micro basil.\"  Loved the pork belly, which was almost melt-in-your-mouth & were caramelized in spots.  Wasn't a fan of the fig sauce.  Gnocchi were just alright, but nothing to write home about. ;) https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/drexyl-restaurant-scottsdale?select=xS1YryX_Wf2BQcTq85odNQ

My Braised pork cheeks: \"Parsnip puree, caramelized onion & gorgonzola pretzel bread pudding, chili salt chicharron.\" https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/drexyl-restaurant-scottsdale?select=ATIicw6k-lqvN_K5bG5mRw  Wasn't a fan of the pork cheeks- too robust.  Had expected something similar to my experience of Sweetbreads En Croute (at Razz's), which was light & wonderful.  Back to the RW dish- parsnip puree was too sweet & too smooth in texture for me.  Reminded me of baby food.  Oh, but the pretzel bread pudding!!  How I wish I could have some more now.  I could eat that together w/ the salt chili chicharron once, or twice a week- don't want to be excessive.  :)  JY also had this dish & enjoyed the pork cheeks more than I did.  DK had the scallop & prawn dish.  Scallop was \"perfectly cooked,\" said DK, but had not yet tried the prawn when I asked. 

JY & I both ordered the Peach upside down cake w/ coconut gelato- exquisite!  Found the cake to be biscuit-like in texture.  The coconut gelato & peaches' sweetness & quality were delightful!  Not too sweet, & very flavorful.  I'd order this dessert in a heartbeat! https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/drexyl-restaurant-scottsdale?select=BUzig_pk0UnBBmLi1Y_5gg

DK didn't want to partake in dessert, as he's on a diet.  (This coming from a guy who likes his scotches, whiskeys, and beers!)  No matter, because that meant JY & I could try the Spiced milk chocolate pot de creme w/ cinnamon whipped cream.  Another impeccable dessert!  I delighted in the scoops of velvety chocolate & the cinnamon whipped cream, a perfect marriage! https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/drexyl-restaurant-scottsdale?select=0L6CkO_SJ9IqvsgfcvbPgw

Inconsistencies in the presentation of friends' Seared salmon salad, & my not enjoying most of the components of my app & main courses are the reasons for the 3 star rating, but I'll be back!

{"text":"Wow what a fantastic place. We came here on a Wednesday afternoon around 3:30pm for Happy Hour. The service was impeccable and the food was even better! 

We had the roasted chicken aranchini, which were phenomenal - I could eat those ever day. We also had the ahi tuna tacos with the crispy wonton shell and the soft pretzel sticks. All the food was delicious and well seasoned, I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"We visited Drexel last night for the first time. It was an unexpected surprise. I had seen the restaurant a few times when visiting other spots in the same plaza but was not familiar with it. I checked it out on yelp and wanted to try it. We started with calamari and a glass of Cab. The calamari was okay. It was not fresh I think frozen but it was decent and the server started off pleasant. My husband ordered the rib eye and I ordered the chicken Marsala. Both were DELICIOUS. actually I stole a few bites of his rib eye which was amazing. I also liked that it came with veggies and potatoes which were both really good. We will definitely be back. We both enjoyed our food. Also the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"Drexyl is in the strip center at Scottsdale Road and Doubletree.  I don't go to this mall much because it's usually filled with overpriced offerings and not very nice people, whether it be a restaurant, shop or Cars & Coffee.  Frankly, it's a pretty snooty mall.  HOWEVER, Drexyl is refreshingly down to earth.  I've been, oh, about 4 times now.  Drexyl does have very nice contemporary decor, a menu reminiscent of Houston's (decor is not like Houston's) and fancy cocktails with nice touches like giant ice balls in whiskey drinks.  Their staff all has been very personable - in that they have personalities and actually care about showing us a good time - from the greeters to all the servers.  Excellent wine list.  Entrees are about in the $20-30 range, but if you can catch Happy Hour there are some deals like the ginormous burger.  Lately they've had a deal on Thursday nights where every glass of wine is 1/2 off, and every bottle offered by the glass is also 1/2 off.  Some of my favorite entrees are the chicken marsala (surprisingly well executed but bring a HUGE appetite) and the orecchiette with asparagus and pesto."}
{"text":"Wow! Totally impressed with the food tonight!! The filet with lobster béarnaise was phenomenal! Make sure to start with the arancini it is one of the best foods I've ever eaten! I may just order several of these next time I'm in!!  Beautiful establishment, great ambiance. Our server Sara was spot on also!"}
{"text":"Excellent dining experience here! The waitstaff was on top of their game and the food was absolutely amazing. Great portions for a high end restaurant!! We will definitely be going back soon."}

What you doin' for Restaurant Week....aah!
What you doin' for Restaurant Week....aah!
You should try Drexyl, yeah!
Drexyl, yeah!


I came with a bunch of friends for Restaurant Week.  My favorite week of the years!  

At first sight the restaurant itself is very beautiful and elegant.  I love the bright greens and marble around the restaurant giving it a museum and delicate feel.  

We started with a bottle of wine and went in for the menu.  For Restaurant Week it was a 3 course meal.  So I started with the Beet Salad; roasted beets, baby carrots, petite greens and drizzled with a honey citrus vinaigrette and sweet jalapenos.  It was light start and honey citrus with jalapeno was different and gave this salad some character and pop!  For the entree I ordered their Braised Pork Cheeks; with parsnip puree, caramelized onion and gorgonzola pretzel bread pudding, chili salt chicharron.  The braised pork was well cooked while the parsnip puree provided a soft subtle creamy texture to the sweet caramelized onions.  I didn't care for the pretzel bread pudding, but overall not a bad dish.  For dessert I wanted the peach upside down cake with coconut gelato, but they ran short!  So I went for the regular menu brownie.  I didn't care for it, but my mates around me loved it.....I had a bite of their peach cake and coconut gelato....I would have rather had that needless to say!

In the end, our visit to Drexyl was nice cause the place was definitely beautiful.  Service was good and attentive since we did have a large group.  I thought the food was well plated and beautiful!  The food I thought was okay because it was well cooked, but I didn't really care for the ingredients fusion. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Eat at this place real soon because I will be surprised if it is still there in a year. 
Food prices very high. 
Portion size skimpy at best. 
Food quality just average. 
Food presentation was good. 
Food server lost in space some place with an attitude. 3 requests for some limes. 2 requests for bread, 3 requests for butter. 
Fancy names for the dishes. When server was asked to describe the dish she just read it off the menu. Had no idea what it was. 
Very noisy. Cannot hold a conversation. Horrible acoustics. My suggestion would be to eat at outside seating if you can. 
We will not be back nor would I recommend them as there are much better places to eat in town."}
{"text":"Great stuff!  Food was real hot, came out in no time, and we absolutely delicious.  No complaints on the service either.  Staff was exceptional and readily available at every given moment.  Music was a bit loud but I like that sort of thing :D  Definitely recommend a visit."}
{"text":"Just had dinner at Drexyl and thoroughly enjoyed my experience. Our server was extremely attentive even while the restaurant was packed for dinner service. Our table all ordered different cocktails and variations of the restaurant week menu. The food and drinks were all delicious. I loved the atmosphere and will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"We were suppose to celebrate Mothers Day @ Hash Kitchen with my family. We had reservations and when we arrived, and we were told they were running behind. Due to our time restraints , my son in law walked across the parking lot to Drexyl Modern American to see if we could get in. We did, I walked through the door and loved the ambiance. We sat in a great spot to accommodate a stroller. Our waiter was very helpful and very friendly. To our pleasant surprise, the food was presented beautifully and was delicious. I would definitely return, and recommend to my friends. Great Mothers Day..."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I came here for dinner a couple weeks back to check this place out. Overall the experience was pretty good.

Positives from the visit:
Huge projector TVs
Nice Bar layout
Friendly Staff
Decor was excellent 
Mahi Mahi sandwich was excellent!

Negatives from the visit:
Not a lot of items to choose from on the menu
2 of the 3 bartenders looked incompetent (the woman bartender was hustling and working her butt off while the other two looked lost). Way to go blonde bartender! 

I would try this place again if they added a few more items to the menu! Sorry to be critical but this is just my honest opinion."}
{"text":"Great news!!  New general manager at Drexyl and after only three days I can already tell the difference.  The staff is happier, friendlier and much more accommodating.  The food is better and the G.M. is always visible to help with an order, clear a table, welcome a new guest.  This restaurant has such a beautiful atmosphere and has been a good meeting place for drinks and/or dinner since its opening not so long ago.  With the new G.M. in place I expect the restaurant to expand on what it's already doing well and become the new \"must visit\" restaurant in Scottsdale.  Based on what my husband and I experienced tonight, we most likely will be back next week.  The staff is amazing, warm, friendly and very competent.  We feel like we've been eating at Drexyl for years, though that is not the case.  It was the wonderful staff and service that made us feel at home.  Keep up the great work, Drexyl, we'll be back with our friends and family in tow.

P.S.  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Can't wait to get back there and have lunch once again.
The \"restrooms were clean as a whistle\".  For anyone under fifty you might have to google that."}
{"text":"My hubby and I enjoyed a yummy meal here. I munched on the Flintstone sized Pork  Chop with divine Brussels ( and I don't even like Brussels... until now). My husband loved the crispy Fried Chicken and Mashed.  We happened to get lucky with half price bottles of wine as Happy Hour was just winding down.  Be still my heart.  As a former Sabercat I pledge my allegiance to this yummy establishment."}
{"text":"We came here on a Friday and the place wasn't super busy. Bad sign, right!?! 

NOPE!!! Totally thought wrong! 

The food was amazing! I ordered the Prime Dip and hubby ordered Meatball Sub. Both were large portions. The bread was soft and delicious. The French fries were perfectly crisp. I couldn't stop eating them. 

Give this place a try, you will be impressed. Yummy! See you next time we're back in Scottsdale!!!"}
{"text":"Had dinner here with a group of friends.  Service was good, drinks were good, food was so-so.  Most of us had salads and they were fine...  nothing special but perfectly decent.  I had the short rib.  It was a nice flavor, but the meat was just too tough for a short rib and it tasted really dry (not what I'm used to when i order short ribs).

I will say that we were a large group and they were attentive and gave us multiple servers to manage all of us - that was very nice.  I would possibly try it again because I see other reviews which are more favorable - but my first experience was average."}
{"text":"After a thoughtful message from Paul, the new GM at Drexyl, I made a second trip here on Sunday night. To say I was wowed is an understatement.

My date and me had a great table at a comfortable booth and really got to enjoy the ambiance and décor from the location we were seated in- much better that the small table near the door that I was seated at on my last trip.

Also, our server was fabulously attentive and kind!

To start I had the silver mule and was very pleased with the taste. It was delish.

We tried the sea salt French fries which were fab and my date also had the chicken arancini which he enjoyed a great deal.

Four our entrees, he had the halibut and I had the garden fettucine with salmon. I had a few bites of his halibut and it was very, very good. My entrée though was exquisite. The pasta was super fresh tasting and the accompaniments were perfect- it included broccolini, asparagus, tomatoes, baby carrots, a lemony sauce and feta cream. The crowning glory to this amazing dish was the salmon though. It had a crispy crust and a savory flavor that was to die for. Yummmm! 

We were stuffed and happy to say the least!

Thanks to Paul & the staff at Drexyl for a wonderful second visit. I can definitely see myself returning!"}
{"text":"Out of the 4 things we ordered....ALL of them were very good. Im going to make a bold statement....BEST burger in town. Im a professional diner, so I don't say those comments lightly. Yep! I said it....great flavor, ingredients, and cooked EXACTLY the temp I wanted. Smoked salmon was also very good...had 4 pieces of toasted brioche...capers, tomato jam was soo good. My only criticism was about the AHI Tacos....great flavor, but kinda small....but lets be honest folks...Im really reaching here. Great meal....thanks guys!!!!"}
