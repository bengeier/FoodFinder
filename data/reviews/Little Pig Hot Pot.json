{"text":"This restaurant was fine, but I much prefer other hot pot places I have been to in the same area. While the soup base was really good (we split our base half-spicy and half mushroom) and the ingredients were really fresh, I missed the experience of getting my own food.  I also didn't like that we had to share one pot between the two of us.  My friend does not eat pork, so that was off the menu for me (not a big deal, really, but just a note).   The variety of things you can order is vast and plentiful, I didn't feel like anything was missing (though we didn't see chicken on the menu, perhaps we just missed it). We were also pleasantly surprised by the 'snacks' offerings, opting to order a bag of the freshly made potato chips...which were really good!    At the end of our meal we asked to split the bill (which did come to about $40/pp - on a Tuesday night - as was mentioned by another Yelp-er) and the waitress was quite concerned about the tip, mentioning to me that the tip wasn't included in the bill total.  I said I knew that and she wanted to make sure that I left the right amount.  This was annoying and because I had read a previous post on here that mentioned something similar, including a reply from someone who worked at the restaurant, I thought it was really a shame for her to be mentioning the tip to me.   I'm glad we tried it, but i don't think we will be going back.  As a note for location, the restaurant is located in the second plaza north of Finch."}
{"text":"Regular hot pot. Nothing special. Spent $45. \"Special\" drinks are 5.99. WAY Overpriced. Can get 2 meals at any other hot pot spot. Do not recommend. PS: cash only."}
{"text":"EDIT: changed from 3 stars to 4 after a mind-struggle. Their overall quality is good enough, though, the only and greatest issue is with the overpricing. ----  Alright, guess I'll begin my real Yelp journey with this review.  3.5 (3.0, plus 0.5 for service attitude)  I am long aware of my loquacity(talkativeness), since I've been battling it for years;  So here's your TL;DR summary, your Grace:  *All you can eat Hotpot(AYCE) +food is decent, fresh and abundant, with a wide selection +service really attentive; convenient way of ordering food +FREE refillment of soup base with its ORIGINAL ingredients (not just adding water) -BUT PRICEY(low $40 per person, and can easily rise above that), in comparison with other similar eateries; you may, I'm afraid, find it not quite worth every buck. -accepts cash and Debit, but not Credit.  Recommended for you if you:  *Have no experience of Toronto hotpots before, but wish to have a safe start   OR *Long for a better AYCE hotpot journey and do not care about spending some more bucks        ------- -------  For a long, long time I am a big fan of hot pot, and especially when it is bundled with an AYCE experience - means I get a chance to claim as \"eaten\" as much food as my little stomach can! And that was what led me into knowing of this restaurant and finally deciding to drop by myself this Wednesday, towards sundown.  It was quite empty when I arrived; assume it was because it is already spring(not a typical Hotpot season) and it was not weekends. Nonetheless the servers did not appear to be unattentive. Seated by friendly staff and introduced to their way of ordering food. Like what others have written in their reviews, You get an IPad to place your orders by yourself for whatever makes you drool - no old-school sheet-filling with a pencil, like you do in most AYCE joints; nor do you have to ask servers to forward your order everytime you want something.  They have 5 types of soup bases available, and if requested yes you can combine two into one, making it a Yuan-Yang (in Chinese, analogically, \"a couple\") / Yin-Yang pot.  Now, beware: THE SOUP BASE IS THE MAIN CULPRIT BEHIND THE EXPENSIVENESS. Compared with other AYCE hotpots, which ususally set most of their soupbase prices at $3~5, this restaurant offers their two main kinds of soup at prices of $12(spicy) or $6(vegetarian), which is relatively overpriced.  If you want to save some bucks, ask for a combination of two different soup bases. It results in a reduction of price by roughly $4, not to mention that you can enjoy two flavours at the same time. The decrease in the portion of each flavor gets compensated for by their service, upon request, of refilling your hotpot with original ingredients, FREE OF CHARGE. That is, literally, not just pouring more water into your soup, like other restaurants do. This happened to the spicy half of my YuanYang pot when it kindof lost its numbness a little.  For the part of food, you actually get a really wide selection. Most of them are AYCE items; some, such as Kobe-grade Wagyu beef, will need you to squeeze your pocket a little bit more, though. For the AYCE, their meat is freshly prepared, with other items being pretty fresh and fine. If you have had some experience of Torontonian hotpots, everything you expect to be on the menu will not elude you. If not, this can be your safe entrance into it: HPT101 - Introduction to Hotpot Eateries.  A free icecream after your meal, of course.  Ended up paying $50, after tax, plus tips(15%). I would say most of it is an enjoyable experience, only that it is too dear for me to fully embrace it.    Give it a serious shot if you'd like to march into the hotpot world at a good angle, or you just don't care about your meal being a bit pricey."}
{"text":"TL; DR version: The food is good but not the place to go if you don't believe in lineups.   I am a newbie when it comes to hot pot, but I could tell this place served good food. For the yin yang pot I chose the mushroom broth (instead of the pork base) and spicy pot (instead of the explosive one), which I loved. Compared to the other average hot pot places I've gone to, I think this place has the best soups, hands down.   They use iPad for customers to place orders on their meats and veggies which is very convenient, rather than the old school paper and pencil. The servers are fast, efficient and very friendly.   I went around 7pm on a Friday so definitely the peak time, and I waited for just over an hour for 2 people. That's the only thing I didn't enjoy at this place. I was told that they would take resos for more than 5-6 people, FYI.   I would definitely go back, but maybe not at the peak hours."}
{"text":"Price? -Overall: 8/10 (10 means really expensive) -weekday $25.9; weekends $27.9 -soup base has diff kinds but only two price $6.5 and $12.5. (Additional cost expensive for less ppl)  -drinks cost additionally; there are several high quality meat and sea food cost additionally.  Service: 8/10 -10/10 for the manager  Food: 8/10 It is fine. Everything is fresh and delicious. But that as good as 10.  Food amount: 10/10 (10 means a lot) All you can eat!  Environment: 10/10 The loft design is great and the plates are beautiful."}
{"text":"Hot pot! Hot pot!  I cheer for hot pot with an enthusiasm usually reserved for sports.  Hot pot is *practically* a sport though. I mean, it's AYCE - it's like a challenge that goes down the very depth of my raison d'etre.  Now, onto Little Pig Hot Pot.  The TL;DR version:  It's good, but pricey.    The ingredients are of pretty high quality.  There's a pretty wide selection to choose from - ever had a cheese-filled beef ball? - and the regular sliced beef is rolled into frozen, pretty cylinders for you to dip into your boiling hot soup of choice.  Vegetables are all fresh. A variety of dipping sauces are available, but you have to order them from the iPad menu (fun!). You'll also actually receive everything you order, which other places don't necessarily do anymore (tsk, tsk, to those places).  Tip: If you're a gluten-puff addict like me, be forewarned that this item is one puff split into two, so order more if you're expecting to eat a ton of them.  Ambiance-wise, it's a clean environment, though a tad on the small side, you can still sit quite comfortably. Although I highly recommend that you make sure to make reservations before coming, because even on the random Wednesday night that I came, the place was packed to the brim.  If you find yourself waiting a bit in line, you can amuse yourself through some selfie props at the entrance - a giant \"Insta frame\" can be held while you use those wolf and pig-noses on a stick props to take the perfect Little Pig selfie.  Service is great.  Really appreciated that the owner/manager came over to our table at the end of the night and asked for our input and explained the concept of the restaurant and the reasoning behind the pricing.   ...which is really my only deterrence from coming here more often. I'm totally addicted to the ma-la/super spicy broth, but at an additional $12.50 per pot, it becomes a much higher price than I'm willing to pay as a single or dual diner (you're looking at walking out having paid $40+ as a single diner!).  While I can appreciate that the Szechuan peppercorns used in the homemade broth are delicious and I would actually peg it as one of my faves, I simply can't justify paying this rather large sum.  So sad.  I shall go weep my hot-pot-less tears now :("}
{"text":"tried to come here for 7pm dinner on friday night and for some reason they told us they are closed. while the customers eating were all looking at us when we walked in he greeted us in Chinese and i replied in english \"for two\" then he just said we are closed...okay"}
{"text":"My new go to place for Hot Pot, as they have the IPAD ORDERING SYSTEM which I think is very efficient of getting what you order. The quality of the food is quite above standards, and the service was quick and friendly. They are somewhat in a secluded area of the plaza but they do offer quite a variety of items on thier menu such as freshly fried chips. Thier broth is flavorful, and thier restaurant is clean and cute. This will probably be one of my more common visits when winter starts to hit. However do note the Spicy broth are QUITE spicy so just be aware of it.  Repeat? Absolutely  NOTE: there was no dispute about the tips as the previous reviews had mentioned before..."}
{"text":"Little pig hot pot, is one of the surprised of the time, It is located in a plaza full of restaurateurs that keep on changing. due to its competitive nature. this hot pot place, got inspired by the Japanese buffets, as it also features an ipad menu for you to order. The Food selection was quite large, and so was the soup selection,   The food here was pretty decent, the meat was of a good quality, and the veggies were decent, however the homemade balls of meat were too small it is hard to find it after you throw it in, and also it overcooks really easily because of the size.   perhaps aside from decor, and ipad, and food, surprisingly what really stands out in this place is the service. the service was actually good., the server and owner you can tell really care about the place and goes out of their way to explain to us what food we may not understand, and check up on us all the time to see if we need anything or if any orders are missing.   the one complain i have is that the soup prices are way too pricey, and although the soup base is good. it is really overpriced. outside of that, i would this is a good hot pot place. and you should go on a weekday mon-thursday, so save some money.   i would recommend people to go and try this place, as it is one of the better hot pot restaurants in toronto."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of hotpot restaurants usually.  The idea of me paying for the opportunity to cook my own food seems like a gimmick. I can definitely do this in the comfort of my own home, so why should I pay to do this at a restaurant?   But then again, I hate cleaning up the inevitable mess afterwards.  And I also don't like having to go and buy all of the ingredients first that I may or may not finish eating and I would then have so much leftovers for the next day.  Little Pig Hotpot though eliminates all of this at a price.  This is arguably the best hotpot restaurant I have ever been to!  The staff speaks perfect English, they offer opinions on what is a good broth to get, they also answer your questions if you are not sure of an item on their menu before you order it.  For this evening, we settled on one half pork broth and one half mushroom broth.  Both were equally delicious on their own way, with the pork broth sweet and creamy while the mushroom was equally sweet but lighter and hearty!   Various beef, pork and lambs slices fresh and made to order are all there.  They are not completely frozen and have been prepared and refridgerated well in advance.  Your beef, fish and squid balls are all there. Veggies are offered galore, also fresh and not wilted or have sat out in the open for far too long.   I was also impressed at how often our waters were refilled without having to ask!  They also have premium items for an extra fee such as Wagyu beef slices to king crab legs for those with pockets.  Their in-house cocktail juices looks refreshing too and are served in huge mason jars. We did not participate this time around but we will definitely try them out on our next visit.  This place is the real deal and I hope their good reputation thus far keeps up! Happy potting! :)"}
{"text":"Good cuz you have a tablet to order own food instead of the traditional order on paper and call the server.  They have a lot of selections and pretty fresh."}
{"text":"Overall excellent food materials and choices, soup base, ambience, interior, awesome service! The food ordering is efficient and accurate all done on iPad with pictures easy to understand.    The only thing is that the space is limited so any group larger than 6 will have a hard time waiting and fitting.   Price is on the average side a bit pricier tho.   But overall very good experience and feel like whoever owns this place really cares about he business, customers and the food."}
{"text":"This place doesn't take reservations and doesn't enforce a time limit. The space is small so you can imagine the waits. We had a party of 8 and we were forced to wait almost an hour before the waiters told the previous customers to hurry it up, when they we're clearly just chilling. I definitely wasn't impressed with how they run business.   Also, the soup base cost $25, on top of the already overpriced cost per person. I ended paying $40 after tax and tips. The food was good but not that amazing to warrant the $$$$ price tag. And let me tell you.... The waiter/person collecting our bill had the audacity to count our money in front of us and DEMAND for more tips, saying its usually 10-15%. Well did you ever think about how awful your service attitude is?! Tip is not mandatory.   Never coming back."}
