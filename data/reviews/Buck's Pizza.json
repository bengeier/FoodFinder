{"text":"I've had a lot of pizza in Madison. There are a LOT of choices. But I will say Buck's is probably the best thin crust pizza around. They've been doing thin crust pizza for over 50 years - they've got it down.  It's a bit pricey for what you get (a deluxe/supreme runs about $20) but it is worth it. My favorite is a deluxe (no anchovies) - your standard cheese, pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, onion, black olives & green olives with a rich, hearty Italian sauce. This pizza is great fresh or frozen (they only do carry-out) but it's also killer re-heated for lunch or dinner!  If you're looking for very bread-y pizza, then Buck's will not please you - try Pizza Brutta or Glass Nickel for that - but otherwise, these guys & gals do thin crust just the way you want it!  Only complaint: wish there was another one downtown. The locations definitely don't get them any student business (right on Univ Ave near Middleton or out on Cottage Grove Rd), but they seem to do just fine!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza Ever. You have to pick it up though. Its worth the drive. Thin crust cut in squares. Best freakin' sauce....mmmmm...........Buck's....mmmmm......"}
{"text":"I was skeptical because of some of the negative reviews. However, this is the best pizza I've had in Madison since moving her ~2 years ago. Just good old fashioned pizza. Reminds me of some of the great pizza joints in Milwaukee (e.g., Marias). Only complaint is that the crust could be crispier, but for Madison - a town that lack awesome pizza, this might be the best place."}
{"text":"Fantastic old school pizza.  Excellent thin crust with cornmeal on the bottom and just the right amount of char on the edges.  Their sauce is flavorful and savory.  Just the right amount of cheese and toppings.  They are truly deserving of the Italy bag they serve their 'za in.  I know some may think this is a stretch, but dare I say, the best in Madison?"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've found in Madison.  I love thin crust and this is thin and crispy!  Not fancy gourmet,  but delicious pizza!  Great deals online,  $5 off 2 large and the guys that are usually working are pretty chill.  Save your receipts for even more savings! Glad I found this place,  reminds me of pizza back home even the bags they come in!"}
{"text":"The taste and quality of Bucks Pizza has seriously gone down hill on the West side. BIG disappointment,! We will definitely no longer be craving it.  Uncertain what happened  - it used to be so good!   Female that answered the phone was more interested in having a personal party than taking our order. She carried on a conversation with someone else in the background, sang a little to the loud music playing - coming back to the phone to casually ask \"what?\" 3 separate times. The ONLY thing that remained good and the same was the sauce.  Cheese that used to be downright gooey & delicious was rubbery.  The crust too was once amazing, who knows what they did to ruin it.. Sorry Buck's - I used to look forward to & yearn for your pizza. Unable to say that  or recommend Buck's any longer."}
{"text":"Thin crust, perfect pizza. In our back yard. Perfect! Doesn't look fancy but they sure make a mean pizza!"}
{"text":"So I had to try  this pizza. So many people had raved about how great it was.  I am originally from Chicago, there is a Father & Son Pizza on Milwaukee Ave, great tasting pizza for thin crust. So I had to try Bucks and compare.  It was ok - not impressed. Dough has no flavor, sausage tasted like too much ground beef,  I wanted this to taste so good.  Thin pizza if done right can be just enough to satiate and won't  make you feel so  bloated like regular pizza from let's say Glass Nickel.(really the only Madison pizza I have found to like)  The service was pretty good. It looked like a group of friends working & having fun Friday night when I decided to give them a try.  They do not deliver only pick up service.   Sorry Bucks! I am checking you off my list of food I wanted to try."}
{"text":"Nothing fancy about this place. Just good old-fashioned thin crust pizza. Take-out only. And you can buy a bag of fresh pizza dough for a dollar."}
{"text":"Sometimes you're just in the mood for old-school thin crust pizza, and when this mood strikes you're not going to do much better than Buck's.  I'm told they're a Madison institution and I can believe it.  Their thin crust pizza reminds me of the impossibly delicious pizzas of grade-school birthday parties and post-ballgame pizza parties.  Sweet tomato sauce, crispy thin crust and tons of cheese - this is the stuff memories are made of!  Don't get me wrong, I usually go for Falbo's or Roman Candle for take-out in Middleton and I tend to prefer the fancy specialty pizzas like the Professional or the Italian Stallion.  But if I'm feeling nostalgic for a simple pepperoni and cheese (and there will be a lot of cheese, mind you) Buck's is the first place that comes to mind.  The place is take-out only and the hours definitely aren't for the late night crowd - I believe they close at 8:45 although the menu says 9.  The prices are very reasonable, especially if you don't add many toppings.  And finally, I haven't gotten this in years and I don't know if they still offer it, but you used to be able to get a \"ball of dough\" for a buck, which you then could take home to make your own large pizza.  It was like DIY take and bake."}
{"text":"Was ok pizza, but I picked it up, and by the time I had gotten it home, the grease had gotten through the paper packaging and actually got on the seat of my car. Quite a bummer.  Pizza was cheap, lots of cheese (if you like that), and all the toppings are a la carte. Wasn't bad, but they should invest in a wax covered bag instead of parchment."}
{"text":"A simple yet tasty thin-crust pizza joint. I had a 12\" pepperoni, which was about $12 with the dollar off coupon I found online. It reminds me of Pizza Pit, so if you like that, you're good.  They also have a take-and-bake option, so you can cook your pizza when you get home."}
{"text":"Buck's is my favorite pizza.  Ever.  Fortunately, we live a block away and can walk down whenever we want, which is often.  This is thin crust, no-frills pizza.  It is sold out of what used to be a car wash, next to a VFW that has Happy Hour from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. (support our troops!).  There is no seating; pizza is take out only.  They even sell cans of pop!  I love cans of pop, because I drink soda about once every two months and don't need a bucket of it.  Sometimes when I drive by, I think Buck's has gone out of business.  But then I call and they answer, and everything is okay.  Buck's is perfect for a night in.  Order it if you don't want to fill up on bready crust.  My boyfriend and I split a large pizza (no, we aren't obese), so order a few if you are dining with friends.  They don't have extras like bread sticks, etc, but they will make you a pizza without sauce, which I call cheese bread and dip in sauce."}
{"text":"If you like thin crust pizza Bucks pizza is a good choice, they  tend to be on the salty side . Ordering and pick-up has always been very easy and many times multiple pizza coupons are available! My first choice for take-out."}
{"text":"Not understanding the good reviews here.  Their pizza is gross.  It's thin and basically sauceless with minimal toppings.  When I order a pizza \"not too bad\" isn't what I'm going for... I want delicious, or awesome, or wow.  With so many choices, I simply can't consider this one again."}
{"text":"Do you know why Buck's is the best pizza in Madison? Because the original owner brought the recipe from the heart of the Pizza Belt...Racine! What is the Pizza Belt? It is the area from Chicago north to Milwaukee where the Italian mafia laundered their monies by opening up pizzarias along the Lake Michigan coast. The best thin crust pizzas in the world can be found in places like Racine, Waukegan, Kenosha, etc. My fave is Wells Bros. in Racine. Anyway, Bucks is the closest thing to one of the Pizza Belt pizza's!"}
{"text":"Buck's is the best game in town for thin crust pizza and one of the tops pizza places overall.  Their zesty, perfectly seasoned and balanced sauce is one of the things the separates them from their competition - as well as their awesome, thin signature crust.  I've consulted for 20 years and among other things I always check out the best pizza places in each city.  Buck's is one of the best pizza's in the country for thin crust.  Super fresh mozzarella and high quality toppings just add to the fact - Buck's has nailed the thin crust pizza to perfection.  I just wish they delivered, but this is the only pizza I will drive for."}
{"text":"Pizza's like sex even if its not great,  its still ok. Should have read reviews. Weird thin crust,  the sauce was ehhhh n didn't care for cheese. I hate giving low reviews but this pizza just didnt cut it."}
{"text":"Bucks is my favorite pizza place in town.  To like Bucks you must like Racine style pizza(thiiiiinnnnn crust and cheap).  I like that Bucks dosent waste their money on niceties like pizza boxes, delivery, or operating out of somewhere other than an old defunct car wash. they focus on their pizza instead, and they do pizza very well."}
{"text":"Really great find, loved our pizzas from here. If you aren't a fan of really thin crisp \"cracker\" crusts then stop reading. If you ARE a fan, then you need to come here. They have short dinner-time hours, but they make &  cook them fast. We dropped in, placed our order & went next door to the VFW for an adult beverage. I don't know about you, but we need to stop by again, soon. See you there?"}
{"text":"best za in msn"}
{"text":"Eh.  Their pizza is ok.  I bought a Madison Perks deal and took a chance to try them out.  The crust is incredibly thin.  I am not a huge eater and I ate half of their large before I got full.    Their sizes are not generously portioned out.  Their largest pizza is still pretty small.  We paid a bit extra for more toppings.  I got my usual sausage and green pepper.  I had one or two sausages on each square.  More like one on each truthfully.  It was very \"chintzy\" for lack of a better term.    I want to like them more, but they are just sub-par.  The only reason I did not give them a one, because the pizza was decent.  It tasted ok.  Nothing stood out to me.  I appreciated that they put the pizza in the paper bags.  It seals up the heat allowing you to get a better product home.  Thank you Buck's for the bag pizza.  Unfortunately, I will not be back again."}
{"text":"I love this place!  I drive by it every evening on my way home, but in 8 years, had never stopped in.  I saw an article on Channel 3000 that mentioned them, and decided to try it.  Thank you, Channel 3000!  The pizza is New York style, my favorite.  That means the crust is thin, but flexible.  it has a great taste, too.  The amount of sauce is perfect.  And the sauce is not to spicy, not too bland.  The toppings are ample.  They cook the pepperoni under the cheese.  That's different, but I like it.  My wife lived in New York and she says it's the closest she has seen to true NYC by-the-slice since she left there.  They will make your pizza half-baked, which is a tremendous plus.  We live in De Forest, a half hour away, so there's no way I could pick it up and have it hot at home.  But pop it in at 435 for about 8 minutes, and it comes out perfect.  I HIGHLY recommend Buck's if you like NY style pizza."}
{"text":"So I knew I wanted some thin crust pizza and was flipping through my Bucky Book. I was thinking I'd like to eat it at home.... Do I want to drive to Monroe Street for Pizza Brutta or something closer. I've had Pizza Hut, ick!  I then seen Bucks, I've driven past a million times and never thought anything of it. I called and the nice gal said 15-20 minutes. I provided her my coupon and walked out the door with a pizza that had 5 toppings on one side and 2 on the other. I wanted half and half. My Bucky Book was 50% off any medium or large pizza. I only paid $8.70 total.   The sauce was sweet, the cheese was nice and gooey, the pepperoni was nice and salty. Everything about this pizza was perfect. The cashier told me to save my receipts as you get a free pizza for every 10 receipts you save.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"RIP. Very sad day.  It's. Closed.  This was the best of the classic college town pies wrapped in a simple paper bag. It out to shame all of the fru fru wood fired so called experts."}
{"text":"BUCKS is hands down the most delectable addictive amazingly priced pizza anywhere!!  Once you try this perfect thin crust wonder, you will be hooked. Great tasting sauce, generous toppings, crunchy tasty crust, nothing bland whatsoever. This will become an addiction to those of you who REALLY know good pizza. There are simply no negatives i can say except i wish there were more locations.  (they have great coupons located in ad books also) don't be detered by negative reviewers who seriously do not know what they are talking about. Absolute sheer perfection. Trust me."}

{"text":"Best pizza on the east side of Madison. Great taste and good toppings. If you order get the extra cheese otherwise the amount of cheese isn't quite as much as most people like. The pizza is somewhat greasier than your average pizza which is a slight minus. For the most part everything about Buck's is great. They have coupons online which help offset their prices a bit, but still their pizza is a little pricy and not as filling as I would like."}
{"text":"I seriously can't believe no one has reviewed Buck's yet.  Buck's pizza is my all-time favorite thin crust pizza ever.  The sauce is just right, they cut the pizza into little squares, and the crust is crackery and crisp.  It's take-out only, but they deliver.  This was my favorite pizza as a kid, and my parents favorite pizza when they were kids.  Now that the west side location has moved to University Ave, and like 2 blocks from my house, it's going to be hard to resist the temptation to eat it daily."}
{"text":"I really like the pizza here but give it 3 stars instead of 4 because WHAT IS UP WITH THE STUPID PIZZA BAGS?! Why can't you use boxes like everywhere else? The bags are endlessly frustrating to me. The toppings almost always get stuck to the bag, and if you order more than one pizza it's a logistical headache trying to get the damn things in the car and home in one piece. Buy some boxes, Buck! I would order from you way more often."}
{"text":"Pizza in a bag! Yes! Who doesn't like a steam filled bag holding in all the awesomeness that your pizza contains. You don't have to worry about this pizza getting cold on the ride home. This is a small pizza shack (kind of a hole in the wall) with excellent square cut sliced pizza. I used a Groupon the first time I went which included a six pack of soda (cans). One of the better Groupons I've purchased.  Now that I've had their pizza a few times I can genuinely say it's not too bad.  It's a great change of pace to the usual triangle sliced pizza in a box, and I appreciate that. I wish the they put more cheese and toppings on. It seems rather cheap, so for that they got demoted to 3 stars instead of 4.  The thin style crust was nothing special, it was crust dusted with corn starch. So yeah....  Definitely not the worst pizza for take out on the east side of Madison, but not the best. As for pricing, I would suggest looking for a coupon or Groupon. The pizza is not really worth what they are asking for full price."}
{"text":"Love this place because of it's simplicity.  No dine-in, no stupid cheesy stuffed crusts, no cinnamon pull apart bread bites or some gross giant cookie dough thing that you cook at home - JUST pizza.  Thin crust pizza that's made fast, consistently good, and uses minimal waste in that they use paper bags v. cardboard boxes for pizzas.  Buck's on Cottage Grove Rd is our go to on nights when we're in a hurry, don't want to cook, etc.  I especially like the fact that eating a Buck's pizza consists more of eating cheese/toppings and less so of a big pile of cooked dough."}
{"text":"Let's all agree that most Madison take-out pizza is bad.  Of course you have Lombardinos, Pizza Brutta, Porta Alba and the like, but I don't classify those as take-out.    Glass Nickel is terrible (why don't they cook their dough?).    Falbos - enh (cheap cheese...in WISCONSIN!)  Rosati's - cardboard (and expensive).    Roman Candle - how do they stay in business?  So on to Bucks...  The ingredients at Bucks are cheap but the pizzas are not.  If I wanted a cheap pizza I would go to Pizza Hut for $10 with unlimited toppings.    What I DO want is a place that can do simple, good, take-out pizza.   In addition to the cheap ingredients, their sauce is bad.  It tastes like it came straight from a can (which I'm sure it did).  Also, no cardboard pizza boxes there so be prepared for cold pizza when you get it home.  If I wanted to use my oven I'd make my own pizza or get a frozen one.   They put the toppings (onion in our case) UNDER the cheese.  So basically the toppings stay raw and stew in the canned sauce.    As I write this I'm really tempted to slash my rating to one star..."}
{"text":"Basic, inexpensive, and tasty pizza.  Nothing amazing but for the cash it's not bad.  Good coupons online."}
{"text":"My family and I loved it! ***Our new addiction!  BUCKS IS REALLY GOOD. We have long been fans of Pizza Oven on Monona Dr. We moved to Middleton.  We don't care to drive that far. We finally found something just as awesome! Thin crunchy crust, yummy sauce, thick rich cheese!  They cut it in small squares. We got the sausage. It was just like The Pizza Oven but it is close to where we live. We couldn't be happier tonight. We are going to get it often. No doubt about it! It was ready in 7 minutes! Seriously. We have all been talking about our new find for the past hour. Crazy to know it's been around for 50 years."}
{"text":"Crispy thin crust, thick (and I mean THICK), gooey cheese, and a hearty sauce. An homage to Racine-style pizza (but not quite as good).   I personally didn't care for the flavor of the cheese, or the volume, but a lot of people would be super-stoked with such heavy-handed application.   The pizzas are super-cheap ($4 for an 8\" and $10 for a 14\" - toppings extra), so it's worth giving a try if you're a fan of thin crust.   Carry-out only; no delivery and no tables inside for sitting."}
{"text":"I'm going all out with the stars. I've had Buck's before. But last night...well, last night was pretty darn special. We ordered 3 pizza's. One with ham. One with pepperoni. And one with sausage, mushrooms and green olives. When we arrived to pick up our order, we were informed that we were getting an extra pizza for free. Why? Because they goofed up and topped our pie with black olives instead of green. They righted their wrong, made the original order with green olives and tossed in the goofed-pie for free. These guys couldn't have been any nicer! I'd give 4 stars alone on niceness. It goes a long way. They even helped us carry our 4 pizza's out to our car. When we got home.....whew. That's where the magic happened. Here's an attack suggestion; go for the outsides of the pizza. The crust pieces. A little charred with the perfect amount of old-oven smokiness. The thin crust, sauce and cheese are beyond perfection. Not stone-oven, 900 degrees, Sicilian perfect. But regular, commercial grade, circa 1978, pizza-oven perfect. Delish. If you haven't been to Buck's lately, go now."}
{"text":"When I was visiting Madison and deciding whether I was willing to live here, I met a father-son duo equally interested in the campus tour. Once I sufficiently ascertained that they were from Madison, I asked them what I had been waiting to ask of a Madison native: where's the best pizza?  It's not a question that one has answered simply, definitively, and firmly, but I was impressionable and they rattled off a few: mainly Ian's, Glass Nickel, and Buck's. Knowing what I know now, this was a decent response--those were perhaps the staples of Madison, with perhaps some nuance of preference mixed in. It took a while to get to Buck's--they're farther from downtown and it was clearly the odd man out of the lot.  Buck's pizza has the bready consistency of Roman Candle, the cheesy consistency of Glass Nickel (without the taste), and very pasty sauce. It's an uncomfortably greasy pie that is served in a bag. Perhaps this is some sort of tradition but it is now a novelty or gimmick that just makes little sense next to the functionality of pizza boxes. They cut their pie in a tiny grid, but perhaps our guy was new because the grid was not parallel, not cut all the way through, and really, who functionally eats pizza in rectangles the size of credit cards? Its ingredients tasted on par with Pizza Hut and its style was on par with frozen food aisle pizza.  I'm on a pizzaquest for the best pie in Madison. I've had a few great ones, and there are some that I won't touch (thanks, Yelp), but I hope this was just an off day at Buck's because it was easily a pizza I would like to forget. It gives me no pleasure to write this, but I need you to know how hard it is for me to give up on a pizza, and that Buck's made it happen."}
{"text":"best pizza i've had in madison so far (but I've only been here 3 months, so give me some time if you don't agree..)  delicious! got a large pizza for around $10 as take out. best thin crust i've had in a while.  kind of a hole in the wall, but totally worth it. just too bad they don't open up until 4pm. there has already been a few times since we've gotten their pizza that we've wanted it but it's not open yet, so we choose somewhere else instead of waiting. those, indeed, are sad days!"}
{"text":"Bucks is a gem without a doubt. If you like good Milwaukee/Racine style pizza you need to eat here. Like order right now here! If you like NYC or Chicago pizza...you *may* be best ordering elsewhere; although I maintain hope that someday you appreciate the awesomeness that is square-cut, thin-crust, pizza.   Keep topping choices to 2-3 at most to ensure crispy crust, tip, pay in cash if possible, and always make sure to bring a 'helper' if ordering more than two as these pizzas are not stackable - but then again my best advice is to park, order, grab a cocktail at Jade Monkey or the VFW, pick-up and go home very happy!"}
{"text":"I've had better pizza from a bowling alley. With how many better pizza joints there are to choose from I don't know why you would ever eat here."}
{"text":"I've been eating pizza from Buck's for over 20 years now. And it's still that damn good!  As Timothy pointed out, they don't waste their effort on promoting an image. Instead, they are all about their pizza.  They made me a fan of the square cut. Who really wants a large ring or dry crust on the outside of their pizza anyway? It's just unused landscape for toppings.  I have yet to have a better thin crust anywhere in Wisconsin.  This place is well worth a trip for some carry-out."}
{"text":"This is a very good pizza.  I usually pick up a couple with a Bucky Book coupon, making it a pretty good deal.  It's a great thin crust with a nice cheese:sauce ratio.    The flavor is excellent whatever the toppings.  The location is convenient to where I can call ahead and pick them up on my way home from work.   Tip well - those kids work hard there!"}
{"text":"Honestly this was the grossest pizza we've ever had. Thin, cardboard like crust. Greasy, so greasy. Absolutely would not recommend."}
{"text":"This particular Bucks seems to be hit or miss. The pizzas are always cooked fast, but the quality seems to vary quite a bit. Decent pizza if you're looking for thin crust, take out only--they have no seating and do not deliver."}
