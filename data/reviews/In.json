{"text":"In is probably one of the less tacky looking Korean bars I've seen around Finch area. I am not sure about how it is on the weekdays, but on fridays and saturdays it gets super busy starting 9'ish. I wouldn't really recommend this place to a non-Korean though- it's filled with Koreans in their early 20's and if you don't fit into that type...I swear you will feel like an odd ball out. Menu is well organized and clean unlike many other Korean bars (where it's ripping into 300 pieces). Def a drinking/lounge spot, food is on the smaller portion side but presented nicely. I would go back to drink and hang out on the weekend :)"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place since I moved to the neighbourhood 6 years ago.   To be honest it was one of the only Korean bars that provided decent side dishes when you order soju. Now, it's not much different from the other ones around such as Oh bar.   The food has always been pretty good. Service not bad. Crowd can be pretty rowdy at times. As a non-smoker, I don't appreciate people lined up right outside the door smoking away; please have some respect.   Overall, it is one of my go-to location around the area but not my first choice."}
{"text":"In is located very conveniently from Finch station. A quick walk and voila!   You are served with a variety of Korean appetizers upon arrival. The menu can be a little hard to order from but the English descriptions help a bit. I have had the pork cutlets, dumplings and dubokki (guaranteed I am spelling it wrong..).  The food is delicious. Servings large enough to feed a village and priced very reasonably. Returned here with other friends on a separate occasion and they all enjoyed the food. Excellent choice if you are in the mood for Korean- and conveniently located!"}
{"text":"Pricey menu compared to other Korean bars. One of the servers did not look pleased to serve myself and my company, and actually rolled his eyes at us a couple times, however was eager to serve and was very welcoming to the other guests (who were Korean unlike us). The place gets incredibly crowded and humid and hot because I don't think there is any air conditioning.   On the upside, the side dishes (complimentary) were incredible. The music selection is good too."}
{"text":"I'm confused! Did I just walk into a restaurant? A bar? A nightclub? A high school cafeteria? In seems to be a combination of all of the above and the result is underwhelming.   I came here with a couple of yelpers late on a Sunday night (around 1am). The place was quite busy, it was dimly lit, the kpop and top 40 tunes were being blasted and the tables were full of young Koreans who all seemed to know each other (even our waiter was socializing with them!). We ordered a spicy chicken dish ($15) which was basically some chicken and veggies stir-fried in a spicy red sauce. The dish was below average, the chicken was moist but cut into very small pieces and the sauce was quite spicy but didn't have anything more in the way of flavour. The portion of the dish wasn't overly big and in my opinion didn't justify the hefty price tag.   The waiter was pretty nice, he would check up on us occasionally and then go back to socializing with his friends/clientele. Overall I do not think I would return to In and if I did it would most likely be for a drink only. If I was a 19 year old Korean boy/girl I think I would really enjoy this place, sadly I am not 19 nor am I Korean so this place gets 2 stars.    *open until 3am daily"}
{"text":"first time I experienced the KOREAN DRINKING SCENE. Quite the experience... was shocked at how much korean girls love to drink. There is no TV at this bar because it's more like a social bar then a sports bar. Great place for friends to sit down, chat and drink the night away. The side dishes surprisingly go quite well with the soju even though it looks a bit weird to people unaware of authentic Korean dishes. The service is extremely friendly and welcoming. Only down is the IS front door. The cold air keeps coming in because people never shut the door when they leave or come in."}
{"text":"first things first, If you're not Korean or with a group of Koreans consisting of at least 2 girls, you're not getting in.  Some excuses will be they're at capacity when the'yre clearly not. or even something ridiculous like they're out of ice which has nothing to do with the service.   However if you are able to get a table it's a good place to relax and have a few drinks of Soju."}
{"text":"I'm sorry for all the people who complain about bad service but from day one since I've walked into IN I have received the best service ever. Maybe it's because I'm a black girl who speaks korean but I go there quite often and I've never had anything to complain for. The waiters are super helpful, they know when I need a new drink, and when I need to charge my phone all I have to do is ask.   It's pretty cozy over there and my opinion might be biased since I enjoy and am so familiar with korean culture but I love it there. Since I started drinking there I haven't been to another bar cuz I love it so much."}
{"text":"In? Am I in?   Opens till 3 am?   Young Koreans hanging out?   Loud music makes me feel like I am in a club?  Food choices are quite limited and on the pricey side.  Spicy Chicken ($15) with vegetables are quite spicy but is really a really stir fried dish.   Services definitely lacking as we could not even find our waiter to order something else or even to get our bill.  With that many restaurant options in the area, I doubt I will be back here again.   Out... I am Out!"}
