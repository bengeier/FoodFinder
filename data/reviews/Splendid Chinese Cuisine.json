{"text":"Klemens F. is on the money...grrrrrrreat place.  I'd just about given up on Chinese food south of Sheppard until location and circumstance landed me here last night.  Everything was perfect--friendly service, excellent food.  We had a sampling of the old faves--har gow, siu mai, cha sui, dow sa gok--and they werenot only fresh and flavourful but minus the scary saucey shortcuts.  This is clearly a chef with high standards who selects ingredients with care.  We also gazed admiringly at the lobster dinner at the next table, perfectly cooked and served with an array of fresh veggies and g&g.  A final note...the bathrooms were spotless.  The out of the way 2nd floor location is perilous.  I hope this place survives...it really is Chinese food at its best while still being highly affordable.  $20 each including tax and tip and a huge doggy bag for eyes bigger than tums."}
{"text":"Great place for delicious and inexpensive Dim Sum. You should definitely try eating Dim Sum here especially while they are having a promotion where each dish, regardless of it's size S,M,L,XL, is only $2 each! They serve Dim Sum from 9:30am-4pm. They offer free Wi-Fi (just need to ask servers for info).  These are dishes that I've tried and would highly recommend: 1) Seafood Chives Dumplings (I love it's thick clear pearl dumpling skin stuffed generous filling of shrimp and chives, definitely need to get these!) 2) Shrimp Rice in Noodle Roll (My fav! The shrimps aren't gigantic, 2 in each roll, but the rice noodle roll is the best I've ever had, it is extremely silky and soft) They serve the rolls with the sweet soy sauce already poured onto the dish for you as they do not have bottles of sauce on the table.  3) House Shrimp Dumplings (Har Gow, it's a classic, sometimes it's kind of sticky so it's hard to peel off and the skin rips)  4) Black Bean Sauce Pork Spare Ribs (Very tasty, nice mix of fat and meat, easy to eat off the bone) 5) Black Pepper Sauce Beef Spare Ribs (Great black pepper seasoning) 5) Curry Cuttlefish (Flavourful and chewy) 6) Deep Fried Stuffed Eggplant (Fried perfectly, light black bean sauce, stuffed with delicious fried shrimp fish paste)  When you walk in and get seated, a server will ask you for which tea you would like to drink. Quick and friendly service, clean dining area, and always fresh and hot food.  This restaurant is on the 2nd floor and you have to walk up a small steep flight of stairs, which can be challenging for some people, and there is no elevator, which makes it difficult for wheelchair users."}
{"text":"Both their dim sum and ala carte dishes are great. The $2 dim sum promotion is still there. We mainly go there for dinner. The crispy beef, eggplant, deep fried squid with salt and pepper( so tender I thought I was eating prawns), fish fillets on Chinese green are just a few dishes that are highly recommended. Unfortunately, they are located on the second floor of a building and it's not easy to spot it among all  those signs and billboards along Dundas St W. If it's help, it's located right next to where Kim Moon bakery used to be. The lady who owns this place is so friendly."}
