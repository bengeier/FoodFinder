{"text":"The service is not bad but you need to make sure to repeat requests such as, can I have milk for my coffee, or they forget the first few times. 
The food is......... Ok. It's trying to be trendy and it's decor sort of does but the food does not. The ham off the bone is either delicious or seems almost raw. It's totally hit or miss. The eggs are ok. The pancakes steer clear of they are dryer then the desert we live in. It's not cheap so I can't play that up and I'm always shocked by how crowded it is. For the better option I'd head to Herb Box next door."}
{"text":"Good French toast. Ham off the bone too salty, I would stay away from it if salt is not your thing.  Nice variety of breakfast items."}
{"text":"Had Bruce's bowl with the pork green chili, wow absolutely amazing. My server James was hilarious and knew the entire menu.  I'll surely be back and a regular."}
{"text":"Great little place, highly recommend coffee and Eggs Benedict, great start to the day."}
{"text":"Love this place.  My only complaint is that it gets so busy on the weekends.  This is a good place to start your day.  Portions are large and food is awesome.  My favorite is the basic breakfast with the ham.  The ham is thick cut off the bone and is great.  I have also tired the breakfast bowl and the California Benedict and both were delicious.

The staff is friendly and it doesn't take too many visits before they get to recognize you and and treat you like a regular."}
{"text":"The food and the service was terrific. Stumbled across this place and it is definitely going to be a place we frequent often. I had the omelet with onions, spinach, mushrooms, bell pepper, jalapeños with cheddar & pepper jack cheese. Comes with 2 pancakes and hash browns. Enough to share for sure."}
{"text":"The food is delicious and the people there are very friendly. I found this place by accident and now I is my go to place when I'm visiting Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Had breakfast at the Breakfast Joynt this morning. No one greeted or seated us and it took several minutes to get a menu. Food was average to below average. Unfortunately vomited on the table immediately after eating what must have been something bad in my breakfast!! Never has this happened to me and we eat out every Saturday breakfast!
My husband told a staff member and he said \"Oh, OK\". We had already paid the bill and were leaving."}
{"text":"One of best breakfast places in scottsdale. Great staff and most of all awsome food! I always get the egg white omlete with the grilled chicken breast."}
{"text":"What a gem.  Found this restaurant by chance when visiting the area and wow.  We were sat right away even in the middle of a saturday morning, service was quick and efficient, and the food.  Oh the food.  Absolutely perfect.  Not many places can poach and egg perfectly but these guys have it down to a science.  Everything came out exactly as we wanted, and tasted great.  Definitely going to visit next time we are here."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews I decided to try a new Breakfast spot in Scottsdale, well actually all the way out in DC Ranch.  Here's how my experience went.
1. Staff - 5 Stars - Very friendly and acknowledged me right away.  Also was thanked several times on my way out.
2. Ambiance - 4 Stars - The place was very clean and what you would expect, but nothing more.
3. Service - 3 Stars - Do you see a pattern forming?  The server should never have brought me the burnt toast.  Additionally, not her fault but the kitchen was slow as they only had 3 or 4 tables.  Not busy.
4. Food - 1 Star - I ordered an Omelet with Chorizo, Green Chiles, Onions, and Cheese.  What I got was something in between a soufflé and a Frittata.  It was like they scrambled  everything together including the cheese and then let it set.  It was probably finished off in the salamander.  It was not folded.  It was also bland.  The Hash Browns were old.  You know how they get when they have been sitting on the grill too long, kind of flat and instead of crispy they were tough.  As mentioned before, me toast was burnt.

I am not one to complain, nor did I have the time to wait for it to be made over.  I will vote with my wallet this time and I won't be back.  Too far a drive to take the chance of disappointment again.  If this was my place, the server has the responsibility to not accept the food from the cook if it is not up to standards.  This was both the kitchen and the server.  Sorry :-("}
{"text":"This place has great food, service, and ambiance. The prices are unbeatable and the portions are huge. You can easily share a meal with a friend and be completely full by the time you leave. If you have food concerns or allergies, this restaurant can accomodate. Today I had amazing gluten free blueberry pancakes. You would never even be able to guess they were gluten free, they were so fluffy and delicious. I give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"Love this place! The biscuits and gravy are fabulous, the service was great...quick and inexpensive for Scottsdale! If I didn't live so far away I would definitely go back many times"}
{"text":"My new favorite!! Reasonable prices for breakfast (I can't believe how some places are so expensive considering it's eggs and toast!) Their omelet includes UNLIMITED toppings, which for someone who likes everything but the kitchen sink in my omelet, this is a dream come true! Plus it comes with hash browns and toast or pancakes. One of the best omelets I have had in a LONG time. Plus the service was great! I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"First time in Scottsdale/Phoenix. Looking for a different place for breakfast. The Breakfast Joynt certainly was.  A variety of eggs Benedict 'Crabby Benny', 'Country Benny', et.al. Both were excellent."}
{"text":"Worst experience. It took 45 min to get oatmeal and one egg breakfast. Oatmeal was soupy and tasted like cement. Bacon was slimy and undercooked. Wait staff did not care about their patrons at all.  We will never return."}
{"text":"Had Aunty Em's biscuits and gravy, best biscuits and gravy I've ever had in a restaurant! Came with eggs and a huge servings of hashbrowns. I got my eggs scrambled and they were perfect and the hashbrowns were a perfect golden brown, crispy on the outside tender in the inside  The staff was very friendly and the place is clean and well kept. They have a beautiful patio area also. All around a great place and definitely one of the best breakfasts in the valley! I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat i eat here all the time chicken fried chicken is my go 2 ones again great place"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast with great service. The red velvet waffle is a delicious surprise!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service. My girlfriend and I  went in on a busy Sunday and our server mentioned they were a bit behind with their orders which we really appreciated knowing. She brought us out coffee with creamer and sugar and we drank our coffee as we sat and waited a few minutes enjoying the atmosphere and each other's company. The food came out and looked fresh and was very tasty. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Our group of five wanted a classic American breakfast. This place delivered. 

We decided to eat outside on the patio , this was not a hassle for anyone. Service was great and everyone had coffee that was full at all times. 

I had the 2x2x2 which was there 2 pancakes 2 eggs  and 2 bacon . Fluffy pancakes what more can a man ask for with warm syrup. Win."}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast here.  It's a little hard to find in the shopping center it is in, look for the sign across the street from the cat statues.

I had the chocolate chip crepes, very good.  Service was great.  We had to wait about 30 minutes for a table (9am on a Saturday)."}
{"text":"Perfect Eggs Benedict and excellent Chicken Fried Steak breakfast. Service is terrific and it's a beautiful place to relax and have a delicious breakfast, brunch or lunch!"}
{"text":"Found this place thru a listing of top breakfast spots in the area. Can't remember which site!? Anyhow, I actually went last month for the first time. Went on a Sunday at 9 am and was amazed at how quickly they were able to seat me and other guests. There seemed to be a constant flow of people coming in/out. The staff was super helpful and friendly. Didn't have to wait long for our food to arrive...maybe 10 minutes or so.  Food was absolutely delicious! I would definitely recommend this place and will definitely be returning in the future!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place. The food is good, for the price you pay, and the staff is always super friendly. What earns an A++ in my book is that they are DOG FRIENDLY, they even bring a water bowl out for your pooch. We are always seated right away and get our food before you know it. Today, from the time we were seated to receiving our food was only 10 minutes (we had an easy order). We have never waited long. If your looking for a quick and inexpensive breakfast, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and great service! We went for breakfast and the food was good, even gave me a coffee to goThe restaurant is very cute and clean!"}
{"text":"The service here is excellent. Prompt. Courteous. Helpful. The restaurant is clean. 

And the food was downright tasty!! I arrived with a group of 18. The servers were so friendly and fast. I ordered the southwest biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon. It was delicious. The syrup was offered warm to the pancake/waffle orders."}
{"text":"Heard so much about the place and since it was in the neighborhood went and had breakfast with my son there this morning.
Disappointed. Service was slow, food was served lukewarm since it sat on the counter for awhile while the waitress chatted up a customer. Ordered toast with no butter with my omelette. Didn't come till I was halfway finished and butter slathered all over it. Avoid. Over Easy and First Watch much better."}
{"text":"This is a restaurant that you need to get to early on the weekends.  The food is great and the service is excellent.   The small bites breakfast provides an opportunity to cut some calories.   I am a weekly regular at the PIMA location"}
{"text":"Honestly I don't know where all these great reviews come from. I took my family here for breakfast and the service was okay and the food was average. I think you're really paying for the ambience of the area. I would say if you're starving and you want some breakfast this will do but if you're looking for excellent food you might want to keep driving. I ordered a breakfast burrito and my burrito  bread was soggy and the contents were Luke warm as if they had just been microwaved. My wife's pancakes weren't  much better. I would say this place is at most average."}
{"text":"Coffee is good, ingredients are wholesome, server was apathetic but service was good, they do play Fox News but we won't hold it against them."}
{"text":"So the newly relocated Joynt has opened in the DC ranch market colony next to Flemmings on the Safeway side of the center. 

The interior is brand sparking new, the teal booths gave a pop of color to the room and it was nice to feel like some of the first customers to sit in the restaurant. Even the table's matte finish was awesome to the touch, not the usual greasy sliminess of older establishments. Also, the counter seating is ample and easy for those solo wanderers to swing through for a bottomless cup of joe or breakfast burrito. 

Hubby ordered the chocolate chip crepes, not hoping that they would be anything he'd find on Takeshita Dori back in Tokes, but praying that the sweetness factor wouldn't have him jumping off the wall either. It came as 3 crepes which were more like thin pancakes, and indeed a bit over sweetened so a word of caution, you may need to order a side of savory for this one.

I always try to keep my order simple and aren't the simple foods that are the most satisfying. My two egg breakfast was also delivered promptly without much wait and I'm glad I went with the waitress' suggestion of ham off the bone rather than bacon or sausage. 

3 stars overall but the additional star for the yummy perfectly cooked crispy hash browns!! Spuds makes or breaks the first meal of the day for me, and if you get over or undercooked I'm never coming back, so I was very happy with TBJ today and will be back soon."}
{"text":"Breakfast was not good today.  No water!? Coffee tasted brunt.  1 piece of toast, no spoons. Waitress was too busy, while 3 hostesses stand around mindless not helping. Ham off the bone was very salty.   We will not return, very disappointing."}
{"text":"This place was outstanding! Food was really  good and portions were big. The staff was very friendly and attentive. Let's cap it off by stating that the restrooms were super clean and Greg really enjoyed the decor. Two thumbs way up for this Joynt!"}
{"text":"The food was top notch! High quality eggs benedict and excellent waffles. However, service was slow /often-absent and we worried we had been forgotten a few times. It was not busy when we went, so it's unclear why this was the case. If I return, I'll try to have the mindset of looking for a loooong leisurely meal, usually a wonderful thing."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best... I ordered the california benedict and both of my poached eggs had solid yolks :( They were busy, but service was slow and the waitress was bland. My father ordered the chicken fried steak (which was better than my benedict, but still left much to be desired). Not terrible food, but overhyped and not worth the wait with all the other options around town."}
{"text":"The spelling is The Breakfast Joynt.... it is located next to Flemings on Pima Road.

Our first and only visit was Saturday morning around 9AM. 

Maybe we have high expecations but when you go to a restaurant for breakfast the first thing that should happen is either someone brings coffee or asks how many would like coffee.... we waited 5 minutes and no one came to our table or acknowleged us at all.... so we left.  

The tables were approximately one third occupied and we saw plenty of waiters/waitresses.... apparently we were invisable.

Even Denny's knows the #1 breakfast rule..... bring coffee."}
{"text":"Good service and great food!
We enjoyed our breakfast and will be back!"}
{"text":"Tried the new Breakfast Joynt for the first time this morning and were disappointed. Breakfasts at the old place were good.  Not so here.  My  wife ordered her eggs basted medium, with the whites completely cooked.  She got eggs with a lot of the white still runny (slimy to me).  When told, the waitress tried explanations (excuses) like, what choices she had when putting the order in the computer - even tho the kitchen was steps away.  We asked that she tell the cook as she took the plate, and when she picked up the check she said she had told him.  That  was the end of it.  Nobody cared.  That hurts more than a bad breakfast.  The bacon was tough too, but that happens.  DC MarketPlace needed a good breakfast restaurant, but as far as we're concerned, this isn't it."}
{"text":"This has become one of my favorite places, and we have plenty of great breakfast choices in North Scottsdale. We usually opt to sit at the counter, and everything is excellent, especially the pancakes."}
{"text":"Great place! The food, service, and atmosphere is top notch. Dining outside here is my favorite ... Especially since they are DOG friendly. When they seated us they brought out a bowl of water for our dog too! Our favorite is the omelet and Belgian waffles!"}
{"text":"I always expect it to be better. Great location, nice space, good staff. Something is always not quite right with my order. This time the bacon was served totally burnt. My waitress scooped it up and took it back to the kitchen but then brought back my plate with really good bacon, but the same eggs (now cold). The coffee is OK, not great. So this is a a good breakfast spot in a good location, fairly standard on the food side, but inconsistent food - this was not the first time."}
{"text":"Great food, fun ambiance, friendly staff. Love it! The chorizo chimi is great, as are the huevos rancheros."}
{"text":"First time to the place and we had amazing food! The service was friendly and the place was very clean. If you like spicy food, you need to try the Southwest Gravy. My son had the crepes. I don't like sweets and thought they were amazing! I had Bruce's bowl. You like breakfast meats, then this for you! Bacon, sausage, off the bone ham and if course some eggs and hasbrowns! Not for the faint of heart. You MUST add the pork green chile too. 

Can't wait to go back and try something else!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast and coffee after a long time. They serve Press Coffee, for all Press coffee fans! Excellent staff and ambience. Love this place.. the food was sooo goooood!"}
{"text":"Small, not easy to find, but totally worth it!  After eating here regularly for a couple of years, I've never had an issue, but the owner is usually right there at the counter if anything comes up.  Friendly, family-run & yummy!"}
{"text":"Stopped in yesterday after hiking. .what a great place! The service was excellent (even gave us suggestions for new hiking places). The food was excellent,  had the California benedict which was very yummy and a side of fruit. Not normal boring fruit, great variety and the cantaloupe was perfect! ! (That is hard to accomplish ). I loved the art work on the walls and the adorable blue booths. The soap in the restroom is even blue!  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast joint - pun intended.  Order the \"Create your own Omelette\" because you can literally order all the fixins with no extra charge.  The co-owner which we met is absolutely very nice and super cool.  Staff are super friendly too.  Jen our server is super cool.  This place is in my top 5 of breakfast places to go to for sure."}
{"text":"This place has a Chicago taste !! The owner is from Chicago the food is outstanding the atmosphere is chicago influence . Wait staff is outstanding. The owner Dave is very friendly and truly is concerned about his patrons . I very highly recommend visiting and enjoying some great food. Little tricky to find but well worth the trouble searching for it. Simply  outstanding dining !!"}
{"text":"Pretty hidden but worth the search... Right next to the steak house.... The basic is delicious, hash browns were a little burn but the service was great and friendly with a smile... Definitely need to check it out"}
{"text":"Highly disappointed. The food was a little pricey, the service of our food was slower than molasses. Server said they were backed up. Took almost an hour for some egg whites and biscuits n gravy. Not sure where someone got on here that their B&G were $2.99. Mine was 8.99 for 1 biscuit and 2 over medium eggs. Probably won't ever go back there again."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing! The Eggs Benedict \"Joynt\" Style is one of the best Eggs Benedict that I have ever had. Our server, Sonia, gave great service! We will be back soon"}
{"text":"My husband and I enjoyed a very nice breakfast here.  The atmosphere was cheerful and clean.  The service staff was very friendly and the food was very good.  Prices for the area were reasonable."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast, service was impeccable, well managed and will definitely be back! Benny Florentine was amazing!"}
{"text":"The service was great, fast and friendly. The food was amazing the waffles was perfectly cooked, homemade fresh whip cream. We had a few special requests and it was all done perfectly. At a very responsible price."}
{"text":"Beautiful store, great pastry, outside seating, and good eats. We were served sample pastries. Kid friendly, crayons and paper."}
{"text":"Food's good, if you can get it.  We waited over 45 minutes to finally get our food after several inquiries.  The manager handled it very well and gave us credit for free meals for our next visit.  However, on our next visit, the same issue occurred, and we walked out without our food, NEVER to return."}
{"text":"The food is always good, but the wait time, for your food once ordered, is always long. I'm a foodie and love good food and places that serve it up. However, if the owner &/or management (if different) doesn't rectify this problem, I will stop patronizing this joint."}
{"text":"We have been there several times. On our own and with a large group. They treated us well every time. I have ordered different menu items. Always great quality. There omelette is the best.  You can have as many ingredients as you want. No extra charge. Most places limit the number of ingredients and charge extra for additional ingredients. The coffee is also good. The wait staff is a lot of fun. They also do a great job.  Four stars +"}
{"text":"This was one of the worst restaurant experiences I've had.  We agreed to sit at the bar which looking back was a huge mistake.  The server approached us by asking what we wanted and taking our food and drink orders all at once.  Fortunately the water glasses were big because nobody returned for a refill. 

My food came out incorrectly and we were missing silverware.  We grabbed someone else's attention and he dropped silverware off.  Nobody ever came by to check on us.  During the entire meal.  There was a place for the servers to have drinks close by so we saw multiple severs stop by for their own drinks but nobody talked or looked at us.  

Finally someone came by (again not our server) to grab our plates.  I let him know parts of my meal were incorrect and if he could let the server know.  I watched as he went and told her.  About 7 minutes went by before she returned with the bill.  She said \"I took the missing fruit off the bill\" and left.  It was literally the worst service I've experienced and I wouldn't return or recommend this place."}
{"text":"Love the Biscuits and Gravy! Great servers. My food was fresh and hot and came out in a timely manner. Ham off the bone is amazing can't wait to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Sorry but unless you have lots of time to spare go elsewhere.   It's our 4th time dining here and still have to wait forever for food and this was breakfast.   Yes they were busy but I've dined many Sunday mornings where they are just as busy and I didnt wait 30-40 min for eggs and ham. Witnessed two tables leave after placing food order that couldn't wait for food.  Children get very impatient after 20 min waiting for table then another 30 plus minutes after order taken.  We've had this experience every time and we kept thinking they'd work out the kinks but not happening.  Signage Breakfast Joynt open finally, could be kitchen motto \" Food ready finally. \". We had no children with us but I felt for those that did."}
{"text":"This place is great. My in-laws were in town and my mother-in-law is from Chicago so she loved seeing \"pop\" on the menu and looking at the décor. The food is delicious and the wait has never been long when we have gone in the past. I've gotten almost all of the benedicts which are always great and my husband is working his way down the pancake menu in order with no complaints yet.

The only thing that I can complain about is the wait staff. They aren't very observant so getting a refill on coffee/water/sugar/condiments is difficult and they are very slow to get items from the kitchen for you. I don't expect to have a full glass all the time, but I'd see them chatting amongst themselves while I was making weirdly direct eye contact hoping that I could catch their attention since asking for help many times when they passed by wasn't cutting it. It isn't bad service, but this place could be a 5 star restaurant easily if the staff was just a little bit better trained."}
{"text":"After being disappointed with the DC Ranch location, we decided to try the new Bell Road location.  First, our server brought our 6 year old a quart of water with a straw.  When I asked if she could bring him a milk in a kid's cup she looked at me as if I had asked for a cocktail!  Wanted to know what I meant.  \"You mean with a lid?\"   It took a long time, but she finally brought out a cute little kid's cup with characters on it full of milk.  So, they did have such a thing.  Odd.
My corned beef hash benedict was not edible.  The hash had the consistency of cat food.  The hash browns were not....brown that is!  Just hash whites, hot potatoes, no brown.  Wow.  I would think hash browns were Breakfast 101.
Oh well, live and learn.  Now we are just disappointed with the Breakfast Joynt all together.  Glad there are some good reviews here on Yelp.  As for me, I am well done."}
{"text":"Inexpensive yet quality breakfast. There is many options in this northern part of scottsdale however some of the other options can take awhile to get seated. I don't know if it was luck or just picked the proper time to go but we were in and out in no time. Food was cooked great and our server couldn't have done a better job. If I had any negative remarks about the place it would have been trying to get the gentleman behind the counter to make an effort of turning one of the two tv's off talking heads sports talk on ESPN to the Liverpool/Manchester United match. He just told me they don't get that channel and stood there, I could have implied that he was an idiot and that if they get espn they sure as hell get NBC. But I'm not one to get into pissing contests so I went back and ate my delicious breakfast and was on my way."}
{"text":"Excellent way to start your day!  The service is warm and inviting and the food is outstanding.
Chicken fried chicken is absolutely delicious or try the Joynt Burger.  It is a homerun and surely to go back again and again...."}
{"text":"AMAZING BREAKFAST! I got a cappuccino and the breakfast croissant sandwich with ham & pepper jack cheese. I loved the inside decor as well! The bright blue booths instantly draw your eye as soon as you walk in, and gives the restaurant a fresh feel.. will be back again!"}
{"text":"Excellent food with service to match at a fair price.  Moving soon to a new nearby location."}
{"text":"Great new place for breakfast! It's a traditional American breakfast joint with great service and food! The waffles and pancakes are very airy and fluffy. The potato and corned beef hash are to die for! I would definitely recommend this place for anybody who is looking for a nice breakfast with family."}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast place! They have the best Eggs Benedict and Swedish pancakes anywhere!"}
{"text":"I came in here today to grab some breakfast before work and it was absolutely wonderful! The decor was really refreshing and nice. My server Juanita was delightful! She was attentive, friendly and quick which I really appreciated. I had the Benny Florentine and it was delicious! I will be back!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast at reasonable prices.  Friendly people and attentive.  Best hash browns I ever had.  A must place to visit."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service.  Probably the best pancakes I've ever had.  Very happy with everything we ate and even came back for takeout the next day."}
{"text":"We are visiting from California and stopped here for breakfast. It was well worth the 20 minute wait. All the food was just better than the average breakfast spot. I don't usually write reviews, but I enjoyed my breakfast so much I thought I would share.

I had the breakfast burrito. I added hash browns inside the burrito. It was so good-- just the right amount of green chile. I also had whole wheat toast which was some of the best toast I've ever had-- the bread was slightly chewy and very fresh.

My friend said her omelet was cooked perfectly. And my brother got the chicken and waffles which ended up being a huge pile of delicious fried chicken with some well made waffles. The siriacha maple syrup was also very tasty and unique.

I would recommend this place if you want some typical breakfast food that is better than average."}
{"text":"Good food but the real reason for Joint dining is the staff in particular Jennifer. Commitment to service and a friendly atmosphere is what will keep you coming back."}
{"text":"Delicious breakfast and fast, friendly service. Went on a recent Sunday at 11 (which should be prime time), and the wait was only 15 minutes. I had a bite of my friend's blueberry pancakes, and they were the best I've had out."}
{"text":"So excited to have a Breakfast joynt minutes from our house!!! You cannot beat their amazing omelets with unlimited ingredients for $11.99. My daughter and I are obsessed with the Swedish pancakes The service is always perfect and we love the cozy neighborhood feel. The Breakfast Joynt has definitely become a family ritual"}
{"text":"We love the breakfast Joynt! So happy that they have 2 locations now. Best place to stop in for a breakfast burrito or even a burger. My new fav is the French toast. Last time I was there I had a Carmel Macchiato which was even better than Starbucks. Yum! We will be back soon."}
{"text":"For just over a year now, the Breakfast Joynt has been my go-to breakfast place.  When I go for breakfast, I am more interested in the quality of the food and the service than anything else. The Joynt does not disappoynt!  Close to 40 meals and I have never been disappointed in a single one. My eggs, bacon, hashbrowns, you name it - they are always cooked to perfection. But the main reason that I keep coming back is the service.  Everyone is good but Jen Martin is absolutely outstanding. From learning my name right away to knowing what I  order, and most importantly, keeping that coffee cup perfectly filled, she really knows how to deliver a quality experience. 

I highly recommend the Joynt, and if you're lucky enough to get Jen, I know you will have a wonderful experience!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent and accommodating due to some diet restrictions. Simply prepared and good quality."}
{"text":"Loved it! Fun to discover good food, and interesting atmosphere in an unexpected setting. I will try their Mimosa concoctions at home!"}
{"text":"We had breakfast here after hiking Gateway.  Most of us ordered the Basic and the kids were able to substitute with chocolate chip pancakes.  Everyone enjoyed their meals.  The bacon was cooked perfect!  We will definitely return to try some other dishes."}
{"text":"What an amazing atmosphere... Tough to find a good all round breakfast joint in all of Arizona let alone on this mountain... The Breakfast Joynt has it all... For starters great coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice... I tried the French toast with Captain Crunch cereal on the outside.... Ummmm the bomb! Scrambled eggs were perfect and the whole toast tasted homemade... I don't think anything in this place could be bad... Last but not least the place is immaculate... Also seems like a family owned place that is HANDS ON and it shows! Definitely going to be my regular spot... (Haven't tried it for lunch yet, but definitely will real soon!)"}
{"text":"Breakfast review....
   First off...it is hard to find. The shopping center it's in is very well camouflaged and once in...there are no signs for the place which is strategically hidden on the west backside of the main thoroughfare kind of in the safeway lot.

The food was excellent. Pefect easy over eggs....cinnamon french toast that needed no syrup.....high end bacon.....exquisite hollandais sauce on the California benedict....

Coffee very average....they should up grade for  the 2.69 price but the food prices were very reasonable. ..especially for n.Scottsdale. 

Service was attentive and friendly.
Nice outdoor patio.

Excellent breakfast place."}
{"text":"We love this place! Awesome food, wonderful service, beautiful vibe. They play great music. We ordered the Chorizo Chimi and the Californian burrito. Both were delicious with great flavor and big portions. Also ordered a side of bacon, side of hash browns, one pancake and 2 ojs. The bill came out to be $42 which is awesome for the quality of food. We will definitely be coming back and recommending!!"}
{"text":"Cheap Breakfast with the normal - pancakes, eggs, sausage, and bacon. Decent portions and the place is filled with locals."}
{"text":"I really wanted to love this place... Sadly, the hostess seemed rude, the menu disappointed, and the food was mediocre, at best. Our server was great - if I were rating her, five stars. We'll give it another try once they settle in for a while."}
{"text":"Can't believe it took us so long to try this place. I had the country friend steak which was awesome and hubby had biscuits and gravy which was also good. Worth the 20 or so minute wait on a Saturday morning. Cute place, good service."}
{"text":"We tried The Breakfast Joynt for the first time after seeing them listed in the Arizona Republic's Top 15 Phoenix Breakfast Restaurants. Our waitress seemed stressed and she was a bit surly until I mentioned it was our first visit after reading the publicity. She then explained that they were short-handed and while I sympathize, customers shouldn't experience negativity when they're trying to have a nice weekend breakfast. The food was quite good and definitely worth coming back for. The Swedish pancakes, my all-time childhood favorite, were exceptional and probably the best we've ever eaten!"}
{"text":"We come here usually every week and food is always good. Always consistent. I usually get The Basic but decided to venture out and try the waffle. I'm happy I did! Waffle not heavy and a slight sweetness to it. Soooo good! Now I'm in the dilemma on which item to order. Tummy very happy!"}
{"text":"This was a unique breakfast place. Service was great, decor was bright and cheerful and the food was very good. I had biscuits and gravy - they were good but not spectacular. My husband had the bowl with eggs, ham, hash browns."}
{"text":"Best breakfast/brunch joint in Scottsdale by far.  Homemade gravy is off the charts delicious.  Healthy options on menu, fantastic variety of mimosas and other treats.  You can sub the (only blah menu item) of hash browns with tater tots that are just great.  Pancakes are fluffy light and tasteful.  You might run into local celebrities at this establishment as well (Michael Phelps dined here last week with his family).  Dog friendly on the patio (they even bring out cute water bowls for your four legged companions.  Just a great place all around.  Prices very reasonable, staff very friendly.  10/10."}
{"text":"I placed a To-Go order yesterday, the place was not busy when I came in for pick up so there's no excuse for them not checking a meal before releasing it to a guest. I come from every side of the serving industry and I know a thing or two about customer service and family owned businesses. I ordered the California Benedict and added (I was charged) spinach. I also ordered the chicken and waffles. When I opened it, there was no spinach, the bacon wasn't bacon, it was fake bacon bits and the \"poached egg\" was hard boiled. The English muffin was dripping in butter. I threw it out. I called and spoke with the owner Sue, she was very apologetic and told me she would issue me a refund and call me back. That was at 10:38 AM. Still nothing. I called at 8:20PM and left a message regarding her \"promise\". Which is standard for ANY restaurant to refund an incorrectly made and inedible order. But in this case I had to ask her, a few times. Instead of just saying \"yes of course\", she sounded confused and didn't know what to do. As an owner, this is common sense. She offered to buy me breakfast however, I don't live in Arizona so I kindly said no I would just like my money back for at least the spinach. After the awkward conversation, I moved on to the \"chicken and waffles\". WTF. Two waffles and literally a chicken thigh and a drumstick. Bone-in. I threw that out as well. Biggest disappointment and waste of money. The fact that I am writing my first yelp review ever over something like this is a joke. It is now the next day, the business has been open since 7am. Even if she is not in yet, she's had over 24 hours to call me back because she was there yesterday and said she'd call me right back. This was just unprofessional and the food was again, inedible. My advice to Sue, if you're going to own a family- oriented business, keep your word to your customers and maybe give your line cook and hostess a few more shadow shifts. Good luck to anyone ordering To-Go orders; double check your food BEFORE leaving."}
{"text":"Pretty chill place to get breakfast on a Sunday where the wait for a table is almost none. I got their \"basic\" which was pretty delicious and their nitro cold brew is really smooth. Its a nice little spot that is kind of hidden but well worth driving to."}
{"text":"Wonderful breakfast.  Swedish pancakes a must!!  Traditional scrambled egg breakfast very good ... good quality eggs!  Great coffee. Service is great ... super friendly.  Would go back weekly if we lived nearby"}
{"text":"Very nice place. As their name implies they have bfast open till close. But they also have lunch too! Burgers, wraps, sandwiches etc. we had a late breakfast around 12:30. I had chocolate chip pancakes, she had Irish Benedict. Both were very good. Fast, friendly service. Food tasted fresh and was served hot. I had a glass of milk, and it was huge and ice cold. Just the way I like it! Will go back."}
{"text":"Food is good.   However, service is hit or miss.   Have had times with good service, but just had second time (in recent weeks) where service was bad.   Server took order and never came back to check on how everything was.   Food runner brought breakfast and never came back to bring asked for coffee and condiments.   Asked a second server for condiments and coffee refill and they also never brought it.  Finally, our third server took care of our request.   He got our tip.   Our original server eventually came by and we expressed our disappointment in lack of service/follow through.   Won't be back."}
{"text":"Been here a few times now.  The first time we went, shortly after they opened, they seemed very unorganized and the service was spotty at best.  We figured we'd give them some time to get things together and returned a month or so later.  Much better experience.  I'm a fan of their California Benedict.  Everything else that we or others that have been with us have ordered has been good as well.  Service on occasion still is a bit slow or inconsistent, but overall this is (now) a good place for breakfast."}
{"text":"I have now been to The Breakfast Joynt two times (in just one week). The first time was right at opening (7:00a) on a weekday. I was one of only two or three patrons there. The second time was this morning - a Saturday at around 10:00a.

VISIT #1

During my first visit, I was helped by Susie - a super sweet and surprisingly chipper (considering the time of day!) server who made my time there very enjoyable. Susie was incredibly attentive (without being intrusive) and excited to gage my reactions to the food. She even brought me a taster of the sourdough toast free-of-charge because it's her favorite and she wanted me to try some! (YUM!)

When I got up to leave, Susie was busy helping another guest, so I intended to make a quiet exit. She caught me walking out the door, though, and called out, \"Goodbye Tim!\" It made me laugh and felt really good. I was super impressed by her.

The food itself was outstanding. I ordered the Breakfast Fried Chicken. It came set over a bed of hash browns with homemade sausage gravy and eggs however-you-take-them and a side of your choice (English muffins for me!). I also ordered coffee, which was topped off frequently by my new friend, Susie.

VISIT #2

During my second visit, I was helped by Joel. It was a beautiful morning and I was originally seated at the bar but, upon noticing outdoor seating out back, I requested to migrate and was told, \"No problem!\". Joel found me a table all to myself despite how busy they were and remained very attentive throughout my stay. (He must have trained under Susie, or vice versa!)

This time I ordered the Homestyle Biscuits & Gravy at Joel's recommendation and couldn't have possibly made a better choice. The meal was equally as delicious as my first. Joel also kept my coffee mug filled with hot coffee and even made a point of making light conversation over the book I had with me, which was fun.

CONCLUSION

The Breakfast Joynt is just close enough to my current abode to qualify as a regular go-to. I love everything about this place and have been excited to review it. Everyone here works very hard to make you feel right at home. They take their jobs seriously and care about the brand they represent.

The food is ON POINT. Delicious morning fare - easily registering in my top favorites for breakfast. I'll be back for sure, and often! If you've never been, I can't possibly recommend The Breakfast Joynt highly enough. Find the time to go for a visit - you won't be disappointed!

*Susie and Joel and the rest of you over there: THANK you for being so awesome. You're some really special people. I'll look forward to seeing you again very soon."}
{"text":"Very disappointed!  I am giving a 2-star rating only because my wife enjoyed her breakfast. I ordered \"the basic\" which consisted of eggs, hash browns, ham , and pancakes. The eggs and hash browns were good and hot. The ham was very dry.  The pancakes provided a first for me. These were the first pancakes that I ever had to use a knife to cut. The were luke warm at best and so tough that I literally had to use my knife to cut a bite to eat. We will probably go back and give them a second chance as my wife said her meal was very good. I hope it will not be a mistake."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great food and friendly staff! My wife and I love to get the Joynt Burger and split it. It truly is enough for two people and the fries are delectable!  Also they have THE BEST corn beef hash if you're in the mood for it! The atmosphere is uplifting with the baby blue colors and huge retractable garage type window that they open up when the weather permits!"}
{"text":"What a nice little breakfast joint!  Chase, our server, was very friendly and attentive to me and the rest of his customers.

Mom had the jalapeno chicken soup, loved it! I had the jalapeno chicken club, loved it!  Only disappointment, the jalapeno wasn't cooked, just cut up and placed on the sandwich.  Other than that, loved it!  I know, picky.

Planning on bringing the kids :)"}
{"text":"Nice, comfortable place. Good food, good service. Counter service and table service available. Garage doors open to the outside when weather permits. Tufted upholstered and turquoise colored seating makes a relaxing ambience. Function room available. Lots of parking!"}
{"text":"Great service & excellent food! Jennifer always provides top notch service with a smile! And the food is always amazing! All you can eat omelette is a good value! There's a wait on Sundays but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Went there Thursday morning with my wife before an appointment we had.  We had about an hour to get served, eat and pay our bill and leave. We were seated quickly.  Restaurant was about 3/4 full.

We ordered.  Our waitress was ok.  She seemed aloof and pre-occupied.
After 20 minutes I asked \"Any luck with our food?\"  She said she would check and didn't come back.  We felt at this point she was avoiding us.  At about the 30 minute mark we realize our food wasn't up yet and we would be rushed to eat it at best.  So we tried to get our waitress attention (young, female, sort of a ginger), with no luck.  She kept adjusting the position of another table for 5 minutes.  We flagged down another waiter explained the situation and cancelled our order.  We were then told our food was up.  No doubt it had been sitting in the back for 10 minutes. 
Our waitress never even apologized she just told us \"we were free to leave.\" after about another 5 minutes of waiting to clear us.


I am not sure why it would take a diner or \"joynt\" 30 minutes after ordering to get our food.  We are talking about cooking hash browns, eggs, and waffles. The turn around ought to be much faster.  I would assume much of it is pre-prepped or even cooked like the hash browns.

It's a sad commentary that there isn't more coordination between the kitchen and wait staff and a real lack of basic training of the wait staff on how to handle situations like this in a professional manner.

In the uber competitive breakfast category there are always other choices and we will strike this one from the list."}
{"text":"OMG! Amazing food, great service (Susan was our server), best corn beef hash & Swedish crepes I've ever had! Good value & relaxing open atmosphere. BEST PART IS...the owner is a huge supporter of Phoenix Children's Hospital & donates over $10,000 of proceeds to the cause. I cannot recommend this restaurant enough. It is truly a breath of fresh air!!"}
{"text":"Decided to give this place a try this morning after we found it on yelp. Very good food! They offer everything from build your own omelets, to different types of French toast and pancakes to crepes and several eggs Benedict to choose from. But the highlight was the biscuits and gravy. The gravy was excellent and the biscuits were soft and fluffy. One of the best ones I've ever had. Definitely give this place a try if you're looking for a good breakfast."}
{"text":"A very friendly and accommodating staff.  A lovely setting and delicious food.  The water tastes delicious (and the vanilla latte's too ) and the silverware is clean and shiny .  The owners of this establishment care about their staff and their customers.  A wonderful feature of this establishment is this: a coffee bar.  All of these unique attributes and the beautiful weather (the restaurant opens up to the outside) makes this a must visit.  We all got to eat - right?  You will be very pleased."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I saw this place and decided to stop by for some breakfast and we were not disappointed. She got the breakfast fried chicken and I got the breakfast quesadilla. The food was perfect and the service was awesome! Juanita was our waitress and she was so nice and attentive. We will definitely be coming back. The menu is so big!"}
{"text":"I'm glad reception for this place has improved. From what I can tell it's a solid breakfast/diner joint with some of the cheapest prices in the area. 

Definitely love the decor. The light blues give some nice vibrancy to the place. And the Coke glasses you get for some of the beverages really takes you back.

The bro had a stacked BLT. The tots were well fried, and were salted - perhaps a tad much, but the flavor was there. He devoured his sandwich on wheat so I assumed it was a success.

I opted for the country fried steak, since it was one of the favorites. Fried eggs were cooked exactly as I wanted them, and the hash browns had the great contrast of crispy and soft bits you'd want. I like that the pancakes were able to sub for the toast - they fit the bill of exactly what I'd expect, no better or worse.

We also split the Chicken and Waffles because why not. The waffle pieces were nice and fluffy beyond the crispy outside so major success. The sriracha syrup was a little tomato strong for me, so maybe not my favorite. I love how the fried chicken had a crispy smooth breading, so you can tell it was made in house. It was a tad dry though, so might not get that again without some eggs or something to back it up.

Overall I say Breakfast Joynt is just decent, but the proximity and price point bring it over the top for me. Definitely coming back again."}
{"text":"Everything here that we had was excellent! The only other place I found that everything was this good was in abq, my very picky children even liked everything! The food came out hot and the service was great, I wish this was the standard and not the exception but.... Go and I hope you enjoy it as much as we did!"}
{"text":"Sadly I can't comment on the quality of the food because we never got seated. We put our name on the wait list, we were told 15 minutes and it was pretty busy so after 20 minutes we were still understanding. 30 minutes came around and all we saw were people leaving and not one person was being seated. We asked where we were on the list to be seated and they said they had tables ready however they were expecting a party of 15 to arrive so they couldn't seat anyone. We were already there waiting but they were holding tables for people who weren't even there?? That makes no sense. We left along with several other parties after they heard that."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to trying this new location. My friend and I walked in, and about half the restaurant was full. We were seated, and waited about 10 minutes for a waiter to come to get our drink orders. We decided on our meals, and ordered. I asked if the burritos come with anything, and was told no. OK. About 10 minutes later, the waiter comes over and says the kitchen is backed up and it would be a while for the food to come out. OK. My burrito comes out with hashbrowns. Normally I would order my hashbrowns crispy, but I settled for the soggy ones. My friend ordered the turkey Reuben. Her sandwich came out without dressing, and barely enough turkey to call it a turkey Reuben.  She mentioned to the waiter there was no dressing, he apologized and said the kitchen staff is more used to making breakfasts, so they have to follow recipes for the sandwiches. That didn't help. Overall it was a disappointing experience and I will not be returning. There are too many other good breakfast places in the north east valley."}
{"text":"I really expected more from a restaurant located in Market Place at DC Ranch - maybe it was because of the Mother's Day rush? In any case, we really didn't feel much love from the staff. The price can't be beat, that's for sure. But the portions were on the smaller side (the chicken & waffle plate, however, looked enormous), and my French toast tasted like something I've had at motel breakfast buffet, soggy and lukewarm. We stopped by for a quick bite before heading to Grayhawk, but I don't think we'll be in a rush to return. It's an affordable, cozy alternative to other options in the area that's just \"A-OK.\""}
{"text":"Didn't look like much from the outside, the patio was actually just the sidewalk. The wait wasn't to bad for a Saturday morning, about 20 minutes. Ordered a 16 ounce mocha from the specialty drink, fabulous. The waitress made it, wish I had her name, made it and it was delicious. The food was surprisingly good. We had Banana pecan waffles, and chicken fried chicken. The gravy was meaty and tastes great. Enjoyed it very much. Thank you."}
{"text":"Sat outside at our table for about 20 minutes as servers walked past us over and over.  Finally flagged one down and the look on his face was like \"Oh, didn't see you there\" as if we magically became corporeal.  Granted I came on a Sunday around 11am, but 20 minutes without even being acknowledged really grinds my gears.  The food was OK but nothing special.  Plenty of better breakfast places around."}
{"text":"In the spirit of small business Saturday, the family and I went out for breakfast to the Breakfast Joint.  We've watched and waited for this establishment to open since it's in our neighborhood. The saying goes, first impressions are everything, and our first impression of this joint was extremely lackluster. Our party consisted of 4 adults and our newborn in his infant carrier. We arrived at 9:30am and were told by the manager at the desk it would be a 5 to 10 minute wait...plenty of tables were open, so I wasn't worried about waiting. Well, 20 minutes later....we were the only party standing there twiddling our thumbs. No one looked our way or asked if we were being helped or anything!!! The hostesses were just standing there...The manager was trying to look busy, literally no one said anything to us while we waited for 20 minutes, not even a waitress walking by...trying to keep my cool in front of my family, I went back up politely to ask WTF! Only to find my name crossed out! I asked why my name had been crossed out since clearly no one had seated us yet, and the girl responded, I think my manager thought you were already seated...???....I asked why he would think that!? She had no answer. They finally seated us after a minute or so of figuring out which table worked best. Our waitress came and took our orders. Her name was Sonia, and she was pleasant. My only issue with her was that her very long black hair was very unkept. She had hair flying all over the place, which is pretty unsanitary working so closely with people's food. Anyhow. The whole meal goes by and the manager never came over to apologize or anything. As a matter of fact, he doesn't glance my way once and trust me, I was watching because I was very upset. He acted as if it never happened which I found very disrespectful. I approached him myself after our meal and asked to speak with him. I asked him how and why we were overlooked and left standing there and all he could say was, it was a mistake. I don't see how, and I didn't buy it. He was very nonchalant. I told him as the manager I expected him to take responsibility and at least apologize, to which he said sorry, but You could tell it was very insincere. He wouldn't have even said anything to us had I not approached him. He offered to take a discount off of our bill which I declined, but he insisted. He ended up taking 20% off which was around 10 dollars...big whoop. Had he handled the situation better this review would be completely different, however, I'm left with feeling this was either done intentionally or he's just an unprofessional \"manager\". Overall, our first impression was sloppy and the customer service was poor. On top of that, the food was super average and halfway cold by the time our meal came out. We will not go back to this place and I'm telling all my neighbors as well! Way too many other better options to deal with things like this."}
{"text":"Really disappointed with this place. Look at all the negative reviews in 2016 alone, that's a clear indication that something is awry here with quality control. Sometimes dishes come out perfect, other times cooking fundamentals are completely missed, like forgetting to season the food. I don't even want to say any further, because there isn't much to say, The Breakfast Joynt accomplishes so little yet charges so much."}
{"text":"Great new neighborhood breakfast place.  Fantastic fluffy and tasty omelette.   Cappuccino was made perfectly, and great baked goods. Wonderful bright atmosphere.  Service was excellent.  Should definitely be Checked out now."}
{"text":"Good menu, but a bit pricey. Food took a while to show up and was not hot. We had to track down the server to get our change. Not coming back."}
{"text":"Staff was super friendly and efficient.  Menu was typical with nice local twist - southwesty - and executed perfectly.   Coffee also very good.  Interior  new and nice with open kitchen ."}
{"text":"Tried to have breakfast at Over Easy but after a 40 minute wait and cold food we left. Much better at the Breakfast Joynt. Fast service and great food. My tummy is happy"}
{"text":"After reading all of the 4 & 5 star reviews my wife & I were excited to visit this new breakfast eatery after my doctor's appointment at Mayo. Sad to say, the dining experience fell far short of 3 stars, much to say, anything more. My cheddar cheese, spinach & mushroom omelette was underwhelming, to say the least. It was dehydrated & tasteless. The hashbrowns appeared to have just emerged frozen from a box & to add insult to injury they were cold. On a somewhat positive note, our server did replace them graciously - not that they were any better, but at least, not cold. 

Perhaps we caught them on a bad day; if so, too bad, cause my first visit was my last."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy in my tummy! Had the breakfast burrito and it blew my mind. Best burrito I've had in a long time. Fried chicken and waffles was good too. I may skip this next time but def will be getting something with waffles!!!"}
{"text":"The service was great and a amazing atmosphere. The food was wonderful I suggest everyone try it."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and excellent service.  Simple, clean and comfortable.  Very good coffee too."}
{"text":"This family run breakfast spot is my husband and 2 year olds favorite place. Very friendly staff. We go every weekend. I love the French toast."}
{"text":"Great food and great prices. Place is located in a nice rustic plaza. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Not a home run. Had a turkey Ruben, way too much bread. Asked for side of fruit and she brought fries.Fries that arrived were the worst fries I have eaten. The plate provided was tiny and food was falling off the plate. Asked the wAitress for deli mustard and she brought yellow mustard. Not a big deal but all in all not a place I would try again. Too bad as this plaza needs  good restaurants.."}
{"text":"Disappointing at best.    It started out bad,  dirty knife.  We ordered 2 Cappuccinos (12 oz)  well that was the smallest I have ever seen and the froth was  4  inches high and the expresso was barely hot and maybe 2 oz.  It gets worse.  My wife's corned beef hash was mushy and tasted funky.   The waitress was excellent, the venue was very nice. My waffle was ordered crispy, didn't come out that way.  I dislike places where u have to take the butter out those little butter boxes they are annoying.   Will I go back, no!  There is the Breakfast Club, Ecstasy, The General Store and Matt's where quality and experience is always great"}
{"text":"I ordered the make your own omelet.  It was large and tasty.   Came with a side of hash browns and choice of toast, English muffin or pancakes.  Very good coffee and the waitress kept our mugs full."}
{"text":"Super nice waitress and good service however a clearly incompetent manager. I wanted a French toast platter with the half biscuits and gravy instead of eggs( I don't eat eggs). This side i wanted is four dollars and the eggs are three. I would expect a dollar up charge maybe two, simple math. But the manager said they could not do that unless I paid the full price for the side and got no eggs. Wouldn't come here again. If you're a picky eater I advise you to go elsewhere"}
{"text":"Breakfast around 10a on a Sunday. Not overly crowded. Two of us were able to be seated right away. The service was very friendly. 

I like the 9.99 omelet with all-you-want fillings and no up charge for egg whites. So that's what I got. Comes with shredded potatoes and toast or pancakes. I ordered pancakes. 

I must have sipped half a carafe of coffee waiting on my food. I swear it took 35m for two identical orders! Waaaaayyyy too long!! 

The omelet and potatoes were tasty, but the pancakes were yuck!!! The texture was God awful...thick, rubbery & chewy and the syrup is equally gross. I think I had 3 bites and was quickly over them! 

Next time I'll stick with eggs/bacon/toast!"}
{"text":"Just came here on the yelp recommendations. I ordered the joint Benny that had an untoasted English muffin, thick slices of ultra thick and ultra salty ham, packaged hollandaise sauce and greasy hash browns that had sat on the grill. Husband had a cheese omelette accompanied by blackened whole wheat toast. 3 stars is being kind! We would not return!"}
{"text":"It was very yummy food, cool Chicago styled place, easy parking. Very service conscience as we had a question on chorizo and server with manager addressed any concerns.  I will definitely go back again when visiting from Chicago."}
{"text":"Great place to eat we eat her every Sunday with our family. The food is good and the staff is great."}
{"text":"Didn't make it to the food. Seated and ordered an ice tea. The tea was barley tinted water. Yuck. As I look around at the plates of chocolate chip pancakes and nothing making me excited, I notice the syrup is on each table in a room temperature bottle which = ice cold on a pancake or waffle! What restaurant hasn't gotten the memo about hot syrup! I glanced at the menu and realized this place doesn't pay attention to detail. We left before the server could make it back."}
{"text":"Not impressed. I think this is the first 1 star review I've ever given. Service was terrible! Waited 5 min before even giving our drink order. Took another 5 min to get our drinks. And then about a half hour to get our food. I know they were busy, but that's ridiculous! Then the food finally came, most of it was cold. Will not go again."}
{"text":"My family wanted somewhere to get breakfast. This is a cute little brunch place. The service was fast and the staff was friendly enough. The omelette was great, and the pancakes were to die for. Would definitely come back whenever in the area."}
{"text":"The food and service are excellent. But when they have over an hour until they close and the waitress is refilling the condiment trays on the tables, it would be great to be left to finish ok ur food instead of reaching across our food while we are still eating.  Wait till people are done and let them enjoy their meal."}
{"text":"I found a hidden gem in a strip shopping center near Kierland shopping area. Choose health or home town comfort food. Prices are great. When my meal came out, it looked like breakfast for a family of four and was only $10!"}
{"text":"We thought we lost our favorite breakfast spot when we saw the locked doors off Northsight Blvd.  You can't begin to understand our excitement when we saw the now open sign at the new Market Place location. Yes all is right with the universe again"}
{"text":"Great breakfast without all the trendy foo fooo. Excellent coffee great food and priced right. Oh and they actually take pretty good care of you too."}
{"text":"Very nice staff and attractive restaurant. The Swedish pancakes were yummy but the banana pecan pancakes were not that impressive. Pancake taste itself was lacking and a bit dry. Orange juice was freshly squeezed and delic."}
{"text":"I really want to slam this place! Utterly the worst presentation & communication between the staff and kitchen. 

2 reasons I won't; 1) It's the day after Christmas, I'm human and have empathy. 2) There is probably something on the menu worth ordering, we just didn't find it today. 

Now, two pieces of advice; 1) don't ask for crispy hash browns, I'm pretty sure they're scraps from the pan. 2) Ask the waitress to recite back EVERYTHING you ordered, even as simplistic as a latte. 

Cute place, but maybe next year Santa can give the kitchen a paid week of.......cooking classes!!! :-O"}
{"text":"We are visiting Phoenix, Az. On our way to the Ben Avery Shooting Facility we wanted breakfast, searching online for a good place to relax and enjoy our first meal in Phoenix.  Yelp was a BIG help. The Breakfast Joynt was just off 101 N It was the perfect choice.  The food was very good, California Benedict was delicious, not to mention the generous serving of pancakes served with eggs bacon and hash browns. I will have another breakfast at the \"Joynt\""}
{"text":"This is our neighborhood breakfast place. We have been here no less than 10 times.  We also get takeout breakfasts.  We love the consistently delicious breakfast.  Their waitresses are also very friendly . My favorite dish is their strawberry crepes always fresh and light."}
{"text":"Really awesome food. Everything was very tasty, arrived hot. Our server was friendly and attentive. The omelet I had was very good and my kids enjoyed their food. Decor is nice, perhaps a little sterile but nothing to really complain about. It's a new place they are probably still adding as they go. We will return."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast after hiking. It's nothing special but there is a lovely outdoor patio area. The restaurant itself is hard to find, even with gps. Kind of a wierd area."}
{"text":"If I wasn't starving and strapped for time I would have asked for a refund and went somewhere else. 
The corned beef had to of come from a can, the hash browns were burnt, and my eggs were cold. 
My pancakes were very generic but they were the best thing I ate today. 
My friends huevos rancheros wasn't that bad but her guacamole was black and her hash browns were burnt. 
We ordered a coffee but then heard our waitress say they had espresso to a different table, that would have been nice to know. It wasn't on the menu. 
The restaurant was really cute and clean. They seemed sufficiently staffed for how busy it was but our waitress was really overwhelmed and rushed. 
I'm so bummed this place wasn't good as it's so close to great hiking. 
I won't be going back."}
{"text":"a little hard to find but in a really nice area of shops. the joint is a smallish dinner type place, decorated in a kind of 50's Chicago theme. 
food was excellent, terrific service, and reasonable prices. 
my husband had the chicken and waffles and it was not only huge, but perfectly prepared. most times either the chicken, or the waffle are overcooked and dry.
my sausage and eggs were also perfect and our coffee (even my decaf) was filled multiple times.
pretty far from where we stayed in old town, but worth the drive! would definitely be back if we lived in az.
also, large outdoor area - dog friendly!"}
{"text":"My family and I were starving from some great breakfast and we happened to find the Joynt! The service was impeccable as the owner even came by our table and chatted for a few minutes! I got the chocolate chip pancakes and they were DELICIOUS!! My boyfriend got the biscuits and gravy and I was literally drooling looking at them!
Next time I am for sure trying the chicken and waffles!!! It is definitely on my top 3 fave breakfast spots- thank youuu!"}
{"text":"Good service but the food - 3 different orders - was greasy and mediocre. A local hash joint would do a better job. High priced and definitely not worth another visit."}
{"text":"My friend and I were out in the area and looking for somewhere to eat breakfast. We looked this place up and thought we'd try it out. This place is located in a plaza, very similar to a strip mall. However, when you walk In the decor is very nice. To your left you have a Chicago city mural painted on the wall. My friend and I were promptly seated and drink orders taken. For breakfast, I ordered the basic and my friend ordered a waffle breakfast. Food was prepped and served in no time. My friend's waffle was delicious. Definitely no fancy frills or thrills with the food. However, it was good and cooked just right. Our waitress was very attentive and sweet. Overall, I will be back and will definitely try out something else."}
{"text":"Stopped at Breakfast Joynt enroute from Austin to Flagstaff for a conference. Food was well worth the stop. The Irish Benny (eggs Benedict over hash, hash browns and English muffin) was perfect. Needed a side order of the hash to savor that alone. Will stop on return trip for more, yum."}
{"text":"When i arrived I was excited because this place is packed!! However, I left feeling like the food quality and taste was similar to Denny's.  This is a great place to cure a hangover but not the kind of place to go if you like a healthy breakfast. I typically go to Tryst in dessert ridge. Its more organic and fresh.  This place is busy though so to each their own!"}
{"text":"The reviews didn't do it justice ... The food was okay ... Pancakes were cold when they came out and other food wasn't very warm. Had to ask for refills. Cute place and very so so food."}
{"text":"I love the Cali Benny and anything on the sweet stuff menu. The mimosas and bloody Mary's are super cute."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Loved it. Recommends if ur around scottsdale AZ. SERVICE WAS GREAT. very clean place. Waiter very friendly and helpful. Man i wish i was closer i would be having breakfast here everyday."}
{"text":"Love love this place. Traveled from Denver for work. Love the atmosphere, food and country music."}
{"text":"Very clean restaurant! We thought it was new but they've been here over a year. Tasty pancakes and a nice job on the omelette. Their breakfast bowl was also nicely made, good portions, we will be back."}
{"text":"This place looks awesome! Came to pick up and order and it was easy. Inside looked really cute like a diner(vintage). You definitely can tell they love Chicago. They have Chicago pictures & sports teams around the restaurant. It looked pretty packed for a Monday at 9am. Definitely wanna try it some day!"}
{"text":"Best place ever. I was on vacation, went here Sunday and it was so good I came back the next day for breakfast. I like the circled omelets and their DELICIOUS pancakes. I would really recommend going here for the food and ambiance."}
{"text":"In DC Ranch. Cool breakfast place!"}
{"text":"I went there this morning with a birthday boy and 4 military veterans and was told my wait would be 25-30 mins maybe longer despite the fact that they had availability in the back room for our family. I left and the owner/ manager was telling me \"everywhere is busy\" \"you should have called.\" I asked him to leave us alone we are not staying. I even asked \"can you open up the back?\" He said \"no.\" Not going back!"}
{"text":"Was hoping to continue the string of very good breakfast places in town...luck ran out.

This is where the Havana Cafe used to be.  They've opened it up (roll-up garage doors to open the inside to the outside) while still enclosing the old patio - cool concept.

I ordered the chicken and waffles - should've known not to go there at a place that isn't a 'chicken and waffles' place, but...

First, the chicken...imagine fried chicken done like fish and chips (that batter coating that is kind of like a crust).  Great on fish with malt vinegar, but such no on chicken...  The waffle was belgian style and ok.  They served it with sriracha maple syrup...sounded interesting, but I have to say, those are two flavors that really don't mix well.  Fortunately, my friend had ordered pancakes and they came with regular syrup.  He said the pancakes were just ok.

On the plus side, they serve Press coffee (espresso, cold brew and nitro).

There are many breakfast places in town, and the Breakfast Joynt is one of them...just not a great one."}
{"text":"Excellent omelets  and light fluffy pancakes. There are so many great breakfast places in Scottsdale. This just may be the best in N Scottsdale. The patio feels like you are dining at a mountain ski lodge."}
{"text":"We picked this location because it sounded good and it was on the way to a spring training game.  What a great choice.  We sat at the bar, which was pretty comfortable.  The restaurant was a little busy and the server warned us the food is a little backed up and it might be a little longer.  That is always appreciated.  She kept our water glasses and coffee mugs full.  We both selected the Eggs Benedict with ham.  The ham made the dish.  The english muffins were toasted and crisp, the ham was thick and fantastic, the hollandaise sauce was very good and the hash browns were crispy and hot.  Did I say the coffee was good too.  Our server, Gina, was very good and attentive.  Overall we felt this was one of our best meals over the 4 days in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I rated them a few months back and decided to give them another try since I was impressed that the owner cared enough to respond to my review. Although I didn't tell him I was coming back, I'm glad we did!!  Been there now a couple different times and......Completely new experience. Great service, great food and will be coming back!  Thank you for getting better.   Could not have been more impressed."}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, great selection of coffee and espresso drinks. Pleasant yelp find!"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Good food. Our party had both breakfast and lunch food. One person thought the coffee was a bit bitter, but the rest of us thought it was fine. 

Be aware that this is a new location on Bell Road."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and food. Plan this to be my new 2x per month or more place to have breakfast."}
{"text":"FABULOUS breakfast,  great service!  This was a real find with the best bacon I've had in a long time.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Came there early this morning with only 5 patrons in the restaurant and a sign asking to hire experienced severs on the entrance door.  I asked to be seated in a booth because it is more supportive for my size and comfort. I was seated but moments later asked to move because they are apparently saved for couples. Got up went to Egg and Joe -sitting in booth enjoying eggs Benedict -so this may explain the lack of patrons and qualified servers. Enjoy the seat with my business elsewhere."}
{"text":"Our server was an older blonde gal, she was kinda snotty and short. She must have had a rough morning, she wouldn't even look at us. we went in around noon, two Sundays ago. It wasn't busy but had a good amount of people there. I ordered the birthday pancakes and eggs etc, and my momma ordered coffee and a big breakfast. It was super good! I really liked the variety of pancakes and french toast! I'm ordering capt crunch French toast next time!!! There's all sorts of crazy flavors and it's cheaper then ihop and taste a lot better! The food definitely made up for the service! Thank you for the yummy food!!!! I'm going to return to this place Sunday and if the service is better I'll update the review! Keep you posted!

Update- we will not be returning. Krissy was so rude to us, huffed about asking for a 2nd cup of coffee, and threw the checks down on the table saying \"I didn't know how you wanted them split\" why not ask? Foods good but i can go get amazing good and amazing service else where."}
{"text":"Wow finally opened LOL. good fresh food always and the pastries are only a $1 proceeds go to Childrens Hospital. Great service with a smile and good atmosphere. We have visited very often and plan to continue going.
4-7-17 Have you ever had Boston creme pancakes? Check them out ....the breakfast Joynt continues to provide good service and Delicious food and they added some specials....Very nice."}
{"text":"Yum. I had the breakfast croissant. It was huge and delicious. My wife got the apple crepes and they were delicious as well. Great service as well. I stumbled on this place by accident and so glad I did."}
{"text":"Bad service with cheap food. Breakfast joints that can't get eggs right shouldn't be in business. Most ingredients are canned. Corn beef resembled wet dog food. Neither meal was hot enough to melt cheese. Sent our food back and the server said she wasn't going to take it off the bill. Lol ok. Wish there was an option for no stars."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place, clean, friendly attentive staff, our waiter Andrew was awesome. He never let our coffee get under half full. I had the Crabby Benny which was probably one of the best breakfast dishes I ever had! My wife had the whole Grain Pancakes that where extremely flavorful. The owner's Mom works the place and makes you desk like ur family. We're in for SuperBowl staying at Inlaws I'm here for another week and I will def return!! 6 star place for breakfast"}
{"text":"Glad they moved closer to our home.  Food is always good and service even better.  Great value for the portion sizes.  I agree with the other reviewer that the pancakes need some improvement, but my kids love their chocolate chip version.

Nice people with a friendly atmosphere.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Our family has been a big fan of Breakfast Joynt for several years.  We think they excel with their omelets, pancakes, crepes & eggs benedict.  Plus, the biscuits and gravy is fantastic also.  The portions are always generous and why someone would say the food was great and only award 3 stars because they got too much food is beyond me?
The owners name is Dave and one of the friendliest people I've ever met.  He runs quality control and makes sure every customer is satisfied.  If you ever have a problem, let him know and he'll fix it right away.
The staff is well trained and if they are not sure about an answer, they'll ask the boss.  A very nice group of waiters & waitresses.  
Also, if you like pastry goods like cinnamon rolls, cookies, etc., they have a well known pastry chef that comes in every morning that makes a slue of fresh bakery items including the bread.  We are going to use them to cater our daughters upcoming birthday party.
Good luck Dave...you did it again!!"}
{"text":"Best in the North Valley! Gluten Free offerings too. Go early or pay the price in wait time. The Basic and omelets offer the most bang for buck."}
{"text":"Cute little neighborhood joint that finally opened after \"coming soon\" for like a year or so.  Tried it out for first time for Sunday breaky with the fam.

Pros:  super friendly, attentive staff; bright cheery decor, t.v.s, and nice patio that's very dog and kid friendly; prices very reasonable unlike some other spots in the area (hint, hint Perk and Chompies!)

Cons:  the food overall was so-so and inconsistent.  Wife got french toast platter.  DRY, dry, dry french toast and her scrambled eggs were overcooked and missing cheese she asked for.  I had corned beef hash, eggs, hash browns, and side of pancakes.  Again, pancakes were DRY and didn't seem fresh but the hash and eggs were good.  We split a side of biscuits and gravy which was good.  Kids waffle was also dry but bacon was tasty.

Verdict:  Definitely will give it another try as its very close, fun atmo and staff super nice, and we like supporting local joynts (get it).  Just will order some different stuff."}
{"text":"Just ordered breakfast for pickup to bring back to work for a coworker and myself. They messed the order up and forgot the side of hash browns I ordered. I wasn't able to leave work a second time in other words I didn't get the meal I paid for... upset I called them, Kristine told me they have them in the back and they just forgot to put them in. However I can't leave work to go get them.... so I was wondering what my compensation for their mistake would be. She says well you can get your hash browns. I began trying to state my logic, of course I can get my hash browns... I ALREADY PAID FOR THEM! What's the compensation for your mistake though? Where's the freebie for the inconvenience? Nothing, she says in a Caty tone, I'm sorry theres nothing I can do for you, you can come get your hash browns though... the level of incompetence that came out of kristines mouth was shocking! I've never been treated so rudely from an establishment. Will never go back again, the food was over all okay nothing special... infuriating how stupid some people in the food industry can be though."}
{"text":"Great food and nice atmosphere!

They have healthy choices, and heavier food.

My only thing I did not like was that it took a long time for the server to place our order. Otherwise, it was great!"}
{"text":"If you enjoyed your breakfast here must be cause you didn't get the sirloin breakfast. The most expensive item in the menu is the worst. I ordered directly from someone whom seemed to be the cook himself because I wanted to make sure the steak had no pink, but when I cut the steak it was just one single piece of pink! Very upsetting. But that is not what sent me to write the review. Businesses that don't care will soon find out that only one customer can make the difference between staying open and shutting down. How many customers can you burn? A lot... if they don't fix their website at least. The prices on the site are lower. I was shocked to see the bill. Not only was the item more expensive but they charged for a replacement. I did not get pancakes and instead asked if I could replace for sliced tomatoes... I was told yes. No fee was disclosed but they charged for the 3 slices and I still did not even get my pancakes. So be careful with this business. Check your bags too if you're taking it to go. I had ordered ranch but that wasn't there. The people can be nice and the place as cozy as they want but they need to keep an eye on the way they run their business. I ended up throwing my steak out. It had no seasonin & tasted like blood. Very, Very upsetting!"}
{"text":"Pretty ordinary breakfast with s l o w service. Maybe we were just unlucky but 2 tables that were seated after us got good before us. Food took a while for 4 of us. I had a waffle platter that was perfectly good but not amazing. Husband had 2+2+2 that was ok. Friends had omelettes that they said were good and as they're made to order they liked them. 

You're not going to have a bad time here but there's nothing outstanding either."}
{"text":"We love going out for Sunday Brunch and have been doing it for years. We have been to multiple establishments throughout the local area.

This was are first visit to this particular location. Loved the ambiance and the Chicago mural on the wall. Color palette on the wall and seating was soothing. Even though we were told it would be a 20-25 minute during prime Sunday B hours we were seated in 10 minutes which was a pleasant surprise.

Our waitress was pleasant and took our orders immediately. Coffee appears to be from Press which is excellent. However, that probably was the only truly remarkable things. The food literally took one hour to get for a table of 5 of us. The waitress came back and told us that there was \"some problems\" back in the kitchen. I have 3 teenage boys that were about to resort to cannibalism due to the wait. Never thought I'd walk out of a restaurant before but we had reached the point. I've been to many establishments where there have been problems in the kitchen and a simple explanation from the Manager would have been sufficient. Luckily our food came out before we went to the nuclear option.

This where the second disappointment came out. You can see all the pictures others have posted. I guess the food was pretty bland and uninspiring. Omelets, which three of us had, were pretty standard. I'm not sure I'd classify them as $13 omelets... Ingredients weren't typically fresh and portion sizes for price were average/below average. One of us had the Chorizo burrito which was pretty well proportioned and tasty. Fried chicken and waffles were also pretty bland. 

In the end, the average food and prolonged wait time really killed it for us. Maybe we'll try it in the future and I'll give it a different review at that time but there is so much competition for brunch dollars, I'd be hard pressed to go back again."}
{"text":"I have a severe tomato allergy so I requested that no tomatoes be used in my meal. It was delivered without tomatoes and a note stating that special utensils were used when preparing my meal. It was so thoughtful and perfect!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood place to walk to for breakfast or brunch. Staff friendly and relaxed."}
{"text":"Stopped by the Breakfast Joynt for a quick bite in the AM and everything was delightful for breakfast especially the coffee. I couldn't get enough of it, it was smooth and I think I had about 3 cups! I had a traditional breakfast, 2 eggs, bacon, hasbhbrowns and toast. The rye toast was great! It was a thicker cut and made my meal to be honest.

The vibe in the restaurant is bright and full of light. The open environment allows voices to travel, so it may be a little more noisy than expected."}
{"text":"So I spoke with the General manager and the waitress said it was a mistake when she closed out a group of her checks at once. The management was great about figuring the situation and their customer service when they were notified of the situation. It's nice to see and I appreciate their effort in this matter"}
{"text":"We love this place for breakfast. Great service, delish foods and the prices are the cheapest in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Definitely worth stopping in.  I love the tucked back location in DC Market.  We went on a Saturday and it was packed.  The prices and food quality were great and our waitress did an excellent  job of moving the meal along at a good pace.  This is basic diner fare but being able to eat an affordable quality breakfast up in North Scottsdale is a welcomed addition .  Its also great taking a drive through the hills after a nice meal!"}
{"text":"On our way to the MIM we found The Breakfast Joint. OMG the food is so good with so many different choices than any other breakfast place I've been to in a long time. We're from California and our waiter James H. was so nice and talkative to us about California and the Jazz festival in Chandler that we just came from. His service was fantastic and we could have any food fixed any way with no extra charge like some restaurants do. We all loved what we ordered. James was outstanding. If I lived in Phoenix I would be a regular!"}
{"text":"Still don't understand why we can't give half stars on Yelp!  Tried this place for the first time. It's very close to home and was a nice surprise. Chicago signage everywhere, which is great for this former Chi-town resident.  Our server was excellent and the food was all really good. Kids preferred the chocolate chip pancakes over the Oreo ones. Hubby had the Florentine benny and I had the Bruce bowl. Both had tons of flavor.  My son ordered a side of bacon and it was way over cooked and we let our server know and she brought us new bacon without issue.  This location doesn't have their liquor license yet so no mimosas, but they hope to get it soon.  Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great, really great breakfast place. We have come many time since they opened but have recently been twice in a week. My wife's loves the eggs bunny. She says they are 4.5/5. I usually go low carb and they have this great dish that is eggs ham off the bone bacon and green peppers called the benniebowl. I skip the potatoes and add han chilli. 5/5!

Coffee is good not great however but since I don't drink it np for me. The place was packed on Sat at 10am but we sat at the bar and had our food in like 5 minutes after ordering. They really know what they are doing here. Service was amazing. 5/5! 

We will return often!"}
{"text":"First time here and we were very happy. Green Chile pork was the star! Delicious French toast too. Will definitely be coming back. Lots more on the menu we want to try. Cute atmosphere and friendly service."}
{"text":"Had their Joynt Burger and tater tots (happy food)! The ingredient quality was top notch and both the burger and the tots were cooked with a caramel glaze, I don't know the cooking terminology but the crust was delicious on both."}
{"text":"Great staff, been there a few times since I moved to the area and every time I have dined in I've felt welcome and like family. Not to mention the food is exceptional"}
{"text":"I had expected this place to be better after reading reviews and talking to friends who love it. I'm not sure what was wrong but nothing I had was outstanding and its pretty hard to do breakfast bad. My eggs benedict had maybe a tablespoon of bacon bits and a couple of pieces of diced avocado. The muffin was not even warmed up. With all the choices for breakfast places around here, I'm pretty sure I won't be back."}
{"text":"When we headed to this location they were packed!  They are obviously a local favorite.  We were able to secure seats at the bar, which we enjoy since you can always watch all the action from here and see how things work.

The country fried chicken is amazing! Our waitress was okay, she kept on top of things, but seemed to be overwhelmed with how busy it was, which was fine. 

The down sides to this place are the parking and how busy it can get.  But if you are willing to walk a bit and hang out for good food that's worth a little wait - head out here!"}
{"text":"Great service, an incredible patio and good breakfast food.  What more could you possibly want in a haunt?  Sitting outside in December is just spectacular."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere.   Friendly service.   The Swedish pancakes were tasty and he turkey sausage was full of flavor. ..although a little spicy.   They did forget one person's bacon,  so,  you do have to remind the wait staff sometimes,  as suggested in earlier posts"}
{"text":"Nice little place for breakfast. Very good selection of items. Even chicken and waffles. Nothing super elaborate but lots of good breakfast choices.
Staff is extra nice and helpful. Not like big chains. Much more friendly."}
{"text":"This place is close to home so the other morning we decided to check it out (on a Friday morning around 10AM). We couldn't have been more DISAPPOINTED! Service was quick, but the food was mediocre at best. 

I ordered an omelet with chilis and jalapeños. I like spice, but not a lot of heat. This omelet was about as bland as could be - NO taste, no heat, no anything! My hash brown potatoes were COLD with no brown or crisp on them whatsoever. When the server checked on us I told her my potatoes were cold and inedible and she said she'd let the kitchen know so that they'd be \"more prepared next time\" - ?? What?? How about offering to take these back OR take the item off the check!! 

My husband's hash tasted like it came out of a can. He's not a fussy eater but was totally unhappy with his meal.  

There's no reason to go back. I can't imagine it getting any better."}
{"text":"Great breakfast.  We hit it early on Sunday morning right as they opened.  Great selection.  I had the Bruce's Bowl and my wife had the chocolate chip waffles.  Both were very good. The Bruce's Bowl came with a side of pancakes that was too much.  I sample them, good, but didn't put a dent in the stack.  Loved the squirt bottle for syrup.  Less mess.  Side of bacon was also two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I will probably NOT go back. My family and I went this morning. Got there about 9:00 and we were sat very fast, which was good. The srrver, Jennifer, came over and took our drink order. 2 reg coffee's, 1 decaf, 1 OJ, 1 Mermosa, 1 apple juice. 3 waters with coffee's. Not hard right? We got 2 waters first. Then the 2 reg coffees. Then came the OJ. Then the Mermosa and apple juice. All at different times. Finally give our order, and again, came out separately. The omelette my granddaughter ordered was not done and then my husband and I had to wait for our order. But what really got us was 15 minutes after our order was taken, our server came back and asked us to clarify our order, which means our order had sat there for 15 minutes, not being put in. Our server did not being our order but a, I assume, was a busboy, brought our orders and was reaching in front of us. All the while, people were being sat and served before us. Our server did apologize, stating that they were very busy. That was not the case. Empty tables throughout. And then after all this, was not even offered any kind of compensation for the very poor service. Plus to top everything off, our hashbrowns were ice cold. Terrible. Not going back."}
{"text":"Haven't been able to try the food because every time I call for take out I get shuffled around and the call takes longer than needed. On top of it, they don't seem happy to take my order and it discourages me to even place the order. Then they tell me a simply order will take 15 minutes.. because they have a full restaurant. Totally fine, but doesn't work for me. The restaurant I prefer only takes 3-5 minutes to prepare my simple order, and is always happy to take my call (no I'm not a regular, they're just better at catering to take out orders)."}
{"text":"(skip to second paragraph if you don't want our background story on this place)... Having moved to DC ranch recently, I was very excited that we could literally walk to the many restaurants that are on Market St.  That being said, I was not a fan of the only other previously available breakfast place.  Then I heard Breakfast Joynt was coming and my expectations were kind of blah based off my experience of their old location (more due to service rather than food, which was excellent).  So, for the last two Sunday mornings in a row, my wife and I have loaded our son in his stroller and taken the nice walk through our beautiful neighborhood and gone here to give it a good try.  Both times I have been blow away!

My basis for a great review is always based on the restaurant living up to expectations, in this case providing great, filling, comforting breakfast food.  I was not disappointed.  Their menu offers all the variety of a great breakfast place, and they execute very well, especially for having just opened.  I had eggs Benedict the first time that was perfectly cooked (I like that they use bacon and avocado on one of their versions), and then I had the chicken fried chicken with eggs and gravy, which was out of this world good.  Haven't delved into their healthier options yet, but sunday breakfast is kind of my cheat meal every week, so i don't care.  Overall, I wish this place the best of luck and I hope that they take the feedback given in their one negative review to heart, as I think the issue raised is useful to address, even though my experience there was totally different.  I love having this place close to home."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast spot filled with all the locals. It's small, so make sure to get in early. I had the Basic Breakfast: 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, sausage and hash browns for $8.99. Not a bad deal for all that food. The portions are large, so make sure to bring your appetite. 

Their only downfall: the coffee isn't very good."}
{"text":"Uber Eats delivered the wrong order. Restaurant OWNER re-delivered entire order himself, free of charge! Best breakfast place in town!!!!"}
{"text":"4-star review, and I highlight the below comment by saying that I will definitely go back.

On my first visit here, I had the Bruce's Bowl, which I would recommend. It was slightly on the undercooked side-- the onions were crispier than I'd have liked. The reason I cannot give it 5 stars is the portion. It is generous and healthily portioned with a small bowl filled to the brim, and I was full leaving there nevertheless. However, it isn't quite what I look for when I go out to eat Breakfast/brunch. Maybe it's an American thing, but I love to get a giant serving of breakfast when I go out to eat! I'd rather pay a couple more bucks per dish to make that happen. Bruce's Bowl was very affordable at $9-ish, but this is literally right next to Fleming's Steakhouse, so I would say that they would be better off charging $11 or $12 and giving more food."}
{"text":"The bloody marys and the captain crunch french toast is nothing short of amazing. This place can be busy and require a reservation.  Go in early for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Was in town for a conference and decided to try The Breakfast Joynt based off of reviews we'd read.  It did not disappoint!  We had custom omelets with hash browns and pancakes. It was excellent!  My husband also tried the apple mimosa and he said it was he best mimosa he'd ever had!  We had a short wait, which didn't bother us. The service and ambiance were both great and we were greeted and made to feel welcome by the owner (my assumption).   We definitely recommend The Breakfast Joynt and will certainly return when back in town.  (Review from picky food snobs from Houston, Texas.)"}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING!  Sydney the server made excellent recommendations for our first visit and will come back again and again!  Must try !!! Managment visable and friendly as well..."}
{"text":"Food was really good, service was fast, and people were friendly.  Only thing is I didn't love the taste of the coffee, it tasted like instant coffee to me."}
{"text":"A big shout out to the service staff there, they really do listen to the customers needs, and they take suggestions well,
I'll be by there midweek, looking forward to having a delicious breakfast at the breakfast joint"}
{"text":"my 1st visit.   Breakfast was great. Had an egg white veggie omelet.  Delicious.  Service was good."}
{"text":"I actually love the food but ordered using uber. Driver went to wrong restaurant so my food sat there for 40 minutes. 
I did file complaint with uber but as a restaurant if you are allowing deliveries recognize your reputation is also at stake. You knew,my food sat there and was ruined. Won't be back."}
{"text":"We decided to stop in here on a Saturday morning because we had an hour to kill before the furniture store opened. We got there at about 9am and were promptly seated. We looked at the menu and I love how the Benedicts you can order a 1/2 order! This is perfect! I had the 1/2 order of the Benedict (traditional) and my boyfriend had the strawberry crepes. Both were great! Service was also great. We ordered, ate and paid and walked out at 9:20! LOL We didn't feel rushed in the slightest but now we had to figure out how to waste 40 more minutes! LOL If you are up in the DC Ranch area this little spot is a must try!"}
{"text":"We live close to The Breakfast Joynt and always at Dutch Bros so we decided to stop in for breakfast a few weeks ago. I had the eggs bene and my boyfriend had crepes. They  were both great! We came back recently and had a traditional breakfast with pancakes and the biscuits and gravy and again, great food! I'm already craving the pancakes again!

I have to say one thing that has stood out is our server Chase! He has been AWESOME both times!"}
{"text":"The only way I can get better food is if I fly to Atlanta and drive two hours to my mom's house. Not kidding. The breakfast options are limitless--and I've tried SO MANY. Their waffles and pancakes are light and fluffy, eggs always perfect and OMG at that gravy. It's almost exactly like my mom's gravy. I strayed from my normal breakfast orders today and got a burger and HOLY COW it was delicious too! And with a fried egg on top? Don't even get me started on the crepes. They are just perfection. Perfect amount of fruit inside, delightfully cooked. Guys, whoever makes your food is an incredible talent. You have an incredibly efficient operation, kind and considerate employees, and the yummiest \"home cooking\" away from home this little southern girl can ask for. Yum. Yum."}
{"text":"Wow, we were in this area driving thru. . Stopped for a spit of breakfast.   This place is awesome! 
I had the daily special of (Cali scramble ).  It was eggs, avocado,tomatoes and pepper jack cheese all scrambled together then placed on a bed of hashbrowns..  I asked for extra crispy browns and they were perfect. The coffee was good.  The service was friendly and fast. Verry attentive but not hovering.  I highly recommend this place! !!"}
{"text":"Reasonable prices, okay food, great atmosphere. The menu was confusing. I ordered a meal thinking I would be getting something else, but due to the poor verbiage of the menu, I was left disappointed. I'd give the place another shot though."}
{"text":"D'Lish !!  And totally fresh !  It's more than a breakfast Joynt.   This place rocks for lunch I tried the Chicken avocado club turned into a salad the chicken was very lean , cooked perfectly and juicy.  I'm a ranch fanatic so was kinda disappointed when I tried it :( not authentic at all tasted like a little dipping sauce from a fast food joint.  

The ambience was delightful very cozy I will most def be back"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast or lunch. The Benny is amazing, love the Bruce's bowl and the country gravy is the best! Great service, everyone is friendly and helpful. We will make this our Sunday breakfast joynt."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great, food is good. A great place to go for a Sunday brunch.  Very clean and welcoming."}
{"text":"Wanted to have breakfast for lunch with a coworker and tried this place.  The eggs Benny joint style were delicious.  The prior comments about the ham off the bone are spot on.  Perhaps the best ham I've ever had for breakfast anyway.  My only mistake was getting the hash browns double crispy upon recommendation of the waitress.  The were the equivalent of those old snacks shoestring potatoes, but my friends looked absolutely perfect.  I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little breakfast spot with very quick and efficient service. It is definitely a plus that they don't charge for more than one cup of coffee like some places! I had the Belgium waffle and sausage patties. I liked them, but the food wasn't to die for which is why I'll only give them 4 stars. I'd go back again though if I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Large portions done right.  Had California Benny, custom omlet, and choco chip pancakes.  Service was good, food hit the spot ... No gripes about any of it."}
{"text":"I think I have tried almost every breakfast restaurant in Scottsdale and several others in the valley.  Some I really like, and some - not so much.  This has become my favorite Breakfast place.  The food is always good.  The scrambled eggs are so good.  Not sure how they are made, but there is something different and they are delicious.  The ham-off-the bone is awesome.  I also really like the sausage gravy that they put over biscuits or on the Chicken Fried Chicken or Steak.  The Chicken Fried Steak is good, but the Chicken Fried Chicken is crazy good.  Have also tried several of the weekly specials and they have been very good as well.  I have found the service to be good - no complaints.  I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Used to frequent the DC Ranch location. But they moved to this location. I like the atmosphere and love the food.  Just as good as the previous location and the service is great. Still one of my favorite breakfast places!  Now two locations with this one and the one on 64th St. and Bell. Have had breakfast at both locations - both were very good!  I especially like Bruce's Bowl with added green chili, the Fried Egg Sandwich with ham, and the Country Benny with scrambled eggs - AWESOME!"}
{"text":"Have been to the DC Ranch location several times- it is great! New 64th St location is just as good! The ambience is really nice. The food and service is consistently good!  The Biscuits and sausage gravy are awesome!  The ham off the bone is exceptional - especially on the egg sandwich! Try it with Swiss cheese - it's unbelievable!  If you want something that's completely different and really great - try the chorizo chimichanga - Unbelievable!"}
{"text":"Amazing eggs Benedict! Would highly suggest the California and Country Benedicts :) also they have great coffee. Breakfast and lunch are served all day! With a beautiful patio to enjoy Arizona's weather before the heat hits!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and super nice staff at a reasonable price. My go to breakfast joint now. What I did there, do you see it?"}
{"text":"Decent food, great service! Ordered a special of the day (scrambled eggs with spinach, bacon, and tomatoes). At first it came out totally wrong (the kitchen must not have known what the special was, since two of us ordered something, and both were totally wrong). 
Definitely great breakfast spot. I'd come back, when I'm back in town."}
{"text":"I have been here twice now just to try and support our neighborhood plaza. Both visits the servers seem super disconnected from the patrons. Not sure how to describe it, but they just walk up and want to take your order, deliver the food, and that's it. The amount of flies in the restaurant on today's visit was ridiculous. The food is a solid C+ to B-. I had the Breakfast Joynt Burger and it was super greasy (I needed 3 napkins). My wife got the Chicken/Avocado sandwich and the chicken breast was pretty dinky. I think I will just drive further to other Brunch spots from here on out. I am probably a bit more Foo Foo when it comes to my Brunch atmosphere. This was more like a Waffle House atmosphere, but with better food."}
{"text":"Slow service. Walked in and said we'd like to sit outside and the waitress immediately gave another waiter a face of disgust. We get sat down and no one checked on us and after 10 minutes we left. Been once before but sat at the bar and got wonderful service. The chicken and waffles are phenomenal, just don't sit outside and expect for any of the servers to come and check on you."}
{"text":"Been a while since I tried a new breakfast place, and The Breakfast Joynt was a winner in my eyes! Super friendly people working there, good quality food, and a nice atmosphere!
It was a nice day so we sat outside, a family friend who I went with was able to bring her dog on the patio which was awesome! I didn't see the inside because we were sitting outside, but it was cute outside! Was a bit hard to find in the complex, but not too bad. 
Took a bit for us to have our order taken, but not too bad. I went for the build your own omelet, with broccoli, red pepper, and spinach. I was happy about all of the options of veggies provided! They had all of my favorites, it was hard to choose. I also was happy to see I could get pancakes on the side instead of toast, I was in need of something sweet but don't like ordering just pancakes. The omelet came out pretty fast and it was good! Was in like a frittata shape, I liked it. The hash browns were pretty good but I would've preferred them to be crispier. The pancakes were ok, The flavor wasn't like amazing but I liked them. Pretty average prices, but good food and environment!"}
{"text":"You can build your own omelette! Anything and everything no extra charge! Not to mention great service!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast restaurant in Scottsdale! Reasonable price. The biscuits and gravy are amazing. My husband loves the chocolate chip crepes! Try it, it's sooo worth it.  :-)"}
{"text":"Went on a Saturday, busy had a 15 minutes wait. Everyone was friendly, food was average, price usual for breakfast in scottsdale. Clean,  love the turquoise  color booths. You need to try for yourself."}
{"text":"I had the Joynt Benedict and Bacon, while my wife had the Captain Crunch French Toast. A lot of goodies to choose on the menu."}
{"text":"Cubs fans come here. Even though we are Indians fans and still smarting from the sting of our World Series loss last year, we gave this place 5 stars.  We were looking for a simple breakfast place and this fit the bill!  I had biscuits and gravy and it was really good. We also sampled the chicken fried steak, bacon waffle, chocolate chip waffle and fresh fruit crepe; all were yummy.  The eggs and coffee were tasty too!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had brunch here one Saturday morning during our Christmas vacation in AZ. It was a bit of a challenge to find the place, given that we were unfamiliar with the area and shopping plaza, but once we found it we weren't disappointed. The food was truly great! We were seated quickly, had good and fast service, and had no complaints."}
{"text":"I've been here about 5 times since they opened now and every time I come it's perfect. Delicious food, and great service. The employees definitely like working here. Beats IHOP and Dennys any day. This place is definitely going to be a regular breakfast place for me!"}
{"text":"Blasphemy.  They overcooked my poached egg.  This is an unforgivable sin at a breakfast place.  I would have complained, but it took me so long to make it wasn't worth waiting around for another.  The bread was burnt too. The rest of the food fell strictly into the mediocre category - there are plenty of other breakfast joynts nearby - I'll pass on this one next time."}
{"text":"I've been here several times and have been happy with the food and service.  I usually get the omelet breakfast which comes with your choice of ingredients, hash browns and two pancakes.  It's the perfect combination of savory and sweet.  I always have enough food to take home leftovers for the next day."}
{"text":"Wow.  Between here and butterfields you can't go wrong but I give the edge to breakfast joynt.  Food was fantastic and the service was superb!!  Huge servings and the ham off the bone is a must get!!"}
{"text":"Everything is awesome.  One of the best breakfast place in the USA let alone AZ. Its really the only place I want to go for breakfast when I'm in Scottsdale.  Awesome service and fantastic food, what's more to want?"}
{"text":"Dave serves up an awesome plate of goodness! Cannot go wrong with anything on menu. Eggs, thick bacon, ham off the bone, killer hash browns, pancakes, waffles...."}
{"text":"The Breakfast Joynt was a nice place for breakfast. I got \"The basic\" with eggs, hash brown, your choice of 4 different meats and pancakes/toast. It was reasonably priced and tasted good. The server was friendly and he came by and refilled my coffee three times.  The place was very clean and the color scheme was interesting.  It was packed on a Saturday morning so be prepared for a short wait. Nice place."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast food at a good price. Went here with my girlfriend for a brunch and really enjoyed it. Cool decor as well."}
{"text":"Best place I've been too in a long time! Staff was courteous, manager even came and introduced himself.  The place was clean and very nicely decorated . They get the coffee and bread Fresh.  The food was outstanding. I got the BLT and it was the best I've ever had. The breakfast chorizo quesadilla was also to die for.  You won't be disappointed !"}
{"text":"I would have given 4 stars. Take note, would have. Great ambience and decent food would have been deserving of the 4 stars. 

Soon as I walked-in, I felt cooler because of the bright color of the seats and the walls. It felt like I was transported to California. An oasis in the middle of AZ. 

The food. The good. The Benny Florentine was really good. Tasty. Not oily and the hollandaise was balanced. Buttery, salty and acidic. Poached egg was perfectly runny. The bad. The southern burrito fell short. It has sorry-zo instead of chorizo. I felt sorry at the amount of chorizo in my burrito. Maybe saw a tablespoon or two mixed in all of that egg. There is room to get better. Just fell short. 

Service. Now this is where I have a problem. It was busy when we got there. Busy, but a 10 minute wait would tell me that it wasn't at the peak of the breakfast sunday rush yet. got there at around 9AM was seated a few minutes after. Got my order in at probably around 9:20AM. Not too bad, right? The problem, our food was not served until 10:10AM. Hmmm, 10 mins short of an hour. Now I may be wrong, but I think our server forgot to put our order in. Maybe I'm a one off but it felt off none the less. 

Maybe next time I would get the 4 star experience."}
{"text":"Visiting and needed real breakfast food. Good stop on way to auction. Very nice area next to Fleming's. A little hard to find but we found it."}
{"text":"Ordered breakfast omelet with lots of veggies and breakfast quesadillas.  It took awhile,  understandable since it was busy,  and coffee/ drinks arrived  quickly.
While the food was substantial in size, it was quite bland.  I understand cooking food for a broad audience,  but no spice at all?  Yes there are shakers on the table,  but no salsa,  just hot sauce. I'm not sure I would return... don't like leaving non positive reviews,  and admittedly I do like fiery spicy foods, this one is not for me and active that likes flavor.  It's an ok value otherwise."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and nice area. Kinda hidden a little as its on backend of shopping area. Came for the red velvet waffle and was not disapointed. Thick bacon and eas great. Scrambled eggs were fluffy. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Loved the place. Delicious food provided with great service. Going back today with my whole family, keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"Great prices,great food and top shelf service. Can't ask for much more. I will going again soon."}
{"text":"I went at 12:30pm for lunch.  There was not a large crowd.  I was greeted by a waitress that was not in a good mood.  She told me to sit wherever I wanted and that they were only taking cash.  She practically threw he menu at me and not once asked if my meal was good or offer a refill on my iced tea.  I will probably not come back any time soon."}
{"text":"I've been a longtime fan of the D.C. Ranch location and was so happy when I found out that this location was opening near my house! The pancakes are so fluffy and delicious! My only complaint would be the lack of alcohol options, but I understand that's not for everyone. However, Mimosas and Bloody Mary's would make this place an even better brunch spot!"}
{"text":"I was not expecting much .... and wow it surprised me .... I did the build your own omelet .. and had a pancake both where delish... I didn't get the servers ne but it was Mother's Day and she worked behind the bar and had a bow in hair ....she is the sweetest :)"}
{"text":"Worth the 45min drive.  Need one in the west valley.  Great eggs - usually think eggs are eggs but scrambled eggs are big, fluffy and tasty.  And food comes out really fast."}
{"text":"One of our favorite breakfast spots. The food is always cooked well and so very tasty. The staff? is always friendly and even with a wait they are efficient. We usually go on Sundays and love the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Cute spot, had the Irish Bennie, Amazing! Best corn beef hash I have had in a very long time! Service was great and the Joynt is super clean...definitely  recommend!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good. Service not so much. Wasn't even finished ordering my breakfast and the waitress snatched up my menu and walked away, was too dumbfounded to even ask her to come back. And to top it off... There was a guy behind the counter with a cigarette behind his ear working. No thanks, won't be returning."}
{"text":"Love a local breakfast in a world of big chains. Service was amazing and friendly and the breakfast menu really diverse. Huevos rancheros and a breakfast quesadilla hit the mark."}
{"text":"My wife and I had been anxious to come here for awhile. We love trying new breakfast spots suggested by word of mouth or with good reviews. I had the breakfast fried chicken which was pretty good. The gravy was good and the hash browns were as well. I would not ask for them to be extra crispy tho as they were harder to get on the fork lol. My wife had the crabby Benny which she loved as well."}
{"text":"Nice breakfast joint. I had Swedish Pancakes with lingonberry, eggs over easy. Super thin with wonderful texture in the mouth. Delicious.  Has crepes in the past. Those were also excellent. 
Place was quite. I had a breakfast meeting. We could hear each other well
Service was excellent. Very attentive. 
I will definitely return again."}
{"text":"What a great place for breakfast! The hostess immediately greeted me at the door. She was so cute and polite! I was sat at a comfy booth and promptly greeted by a server. I ordered the breakfast burrito which was absolutely delicious. Our food was quickly prepared and it seemed like a matter of seconds before it arrived at our table. Great service. Great food. Great atmosphere. I will definitely recommend this place to family and friends."}
{"text":"A fun little modern diner with good food and savvy service (our server asked us to assure we had taken back our credit card - an appreciated but rare reminder.  My Reuben was average but a ham and egg order was award winning per my wife."}
{"text":"Have ordered lunch a few times from them and they have really good food and their staff is super friendly. I can't wait to actually sit down and try their breakfast one of these days.

 Glad they are in the neighborhood!!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my breakfast here this morning. We walked up to a restaurant that made me feel like I was somewhere out of state with their white decor and Tiffany blue chairs. Right away, we were greeted with friendly smiles. 

I ordered a vanilla cappuccino, which was pretty good. Hubby and I shared the breakfast quesadilla and red velvet waffle. I enjoyed the quesadilla and it came with salsa, sour cream and guacamole. The waffle came with cream cheese frosting which I recommend not adding to your waffle. It was way too sweet for me when I added it. However, without the cream cheese frosting, it was pretty good.

Prices were reasonable and our server was friendly. I'll be back again to try other items on their menu."}
{"text":"This place was GREAT! I had Bruce's Bowl with egg whites, this meal was so flavorful and hearty. The service was great, and everyone was super friendly, the manager even came over and checked on us to see how our meal was. We will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Won't be going back. I ordered red velvet waffle with a side of hash browns. The waffle was good tasted like a cake but the hash browns weren't cooked all the way and it tasted like raw onions. My gf ordered the chicken and waffles and her chicken wasn't cooked all the way. The place is cute but not worth it."}
{"text":"First time eating here...overall pretty good experience. Sat at the bar top, waitresses were friendly and attentive. Brought coffee right away and checked refills every 5 min which I really appreciated! Good omelette, prepared differently than I've seen before, but good tasting. Much better than the breakfast I had up the street at Market Street Kitchen. Would return here for sure to try the rest of the menu. Need to test out their patty melt...the true test for a roadside diner type of joint. 

Overall...a B+ on my visit."}
{"text":"Im not a huge fan of biscuits and gravy but I decided to try it here because I heard they were good. AH-MAY-ZING!!! Hot fluffy biscuits with sasauge gravy with warm golden hash browns and an egg cooked to your liking. If biscuits arent your favorite thing, try it any way. You wont regret it! Oh and my moms eggs benedict was delicious as well!"}
{"text":"First time we came here. The service was perfect the food was awesome! The prices were on point, you get what you pay for. I know I found out new breakfast spot!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The menu has a huge amount of options from pancakes and omelettes to lunch options and they even have delicious healthy options! Service is always good and I've never had an issue and restaurant is always clean. Highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"I thought it wasn't bad. I can point out a lot of great things about The Breakfast Joynt. For one, it had a fun atmosphere the one Sunday morning I was there. It was fun because they were packed and it's a fairly small place. The number of patrons gave it a very social atmosphere. I didn't feel cramped, but it's not huge. The surrounding area is really nice. The retail space it's located at has more of a woodsy-feel to it; by that, I mean it's the sort of place you might find in an area full of trees and not desert. Furthermore, the Mcdowell Mountains are close by; although, I don't recall having direct view of them from The Breakfast Joynt. For my breakfast, I had the eggs benedict. I love benedicts with hollandaise sauce! It was good. They have free WI-FI, which is a plus.  I give it three stars because nothing really stuck out to make this my go-to place for a meal, but it was pretty decent. Hey, there were a heck of a lot of people there when I visited so don't let my review stop you from giving it a try."}
{"text":"Finally stopped at this place to try it. I live down the street, I was craving an omelette, so I figured great time to try it ....when I walked in I was Greeted, I wanted to place an order to go, since I had never been here before,  I I told her what I wanted.....on their menu, they have a build your own Omelette, they have about 30 items you can pick from, same cost no matter what u choose ...while I was waiting at their bar seating, the Gentleman, I believe he was the owner, asked if I would like an Expresso while I wait, which I thought was such a nice gesture ..when I received my Bill, it came out to only $11.00 which I thought was pretty cheap, when I got home the omelette was huge came with curly hash browns, and not only that, but two huge pancakes"}
{"text":"All the reviews focus on breakfast but I also love their lunch. Where else can you get tater tots?  The patty melt is perfect and just like breakfast, all are generous portions with great service."}
{"text":"So glad this location is now open. Really bright spot - nicely done!  Fast, friendly, efficient service. Gotta love those tater tots!  Could be dangerous this close to home for all the yummy comfort foods. Great portions!  Bought from bakery also in order to support the children's hospital (that's my excuse). Wow-flaky and yummy!"}
{"text":"The ambiance was great and the food was even better. Very cute little bakery/Pastry area as well . We got the crab Benedict and it was fresh and very flavorful."}
{"text":"Ok first of all,  let me put this into perspective, I LOVE THIS PLACE. Ok Sorry, now back to the review...

Decor- This place highly reminds me of a nice hole in the wall in San Francisco. But they have bright colors, amazing blue seats with white back drops. It was a mechanic shop before so it has good open space. Couple TV's for those morning news patrons.

Food- As a chef, this is my deal breaker and boy did they deliver. I had the chicken fried steak with their \"special\" house sausage gravy. The portions are big, good seasoning on all the food, and try their sourdough bread!!! I actually drove to the artisan shop who provides them bread and bought a load. No joking. 

Service- The staff here are super friendly and make you feel welcome from the start. They're attentive and make sure you're taken care of.

Price point- It was me and one other, and we had a water, tea, and 2 entrees with a side dish. Had to try their green Chile pork, and we paid 25 with tip.

Overall- If you need a solid breakfast/brunch spot, look no further. They will bring it, trust me."}
{"text":"This place has the best Swedish pancakes ever. We also really like the California Benedict. The prices are great and the food is fantastic. Go here over other breakfast places."}
{"text":"Sold on the Breakfast Joynt!  In town for the Christmas holidays and decided to try them out for breakfast on Christmas Eve.  A cool spot with a nicely decorated interior that features roll-up garage doors for warmer weather dining.
Forgetting the name, I ordered a take on a large chimichanga that's filled with chorizo, eggs, peppers, onions, and deep fried in a flour tortilla!  Topped with a verde sauce with bits of chicken, this dish left us speechless!  Worthy of sharing due to its size, this is a must try!
They apparently are known for a gargantuan cinnamon roll that takes up a entire small plate, it too was a crowd pleaser!
The Breakfast Joynt would certainly be a regular stop for us if we were Scottsdale residents, and certainly a stop on each of our visits!"}
{"text":"Family and I enjoyed eating here. Great price and huge portions. Luckily, we got there right before it got busy. Our server was really friendly. My picky 3 year old inhaled her food. We will definitely go back. I thought it was better than Over Easy down the road."}
{"text":"I'm glad the new location is closer to my house but dislike this shopping center. Parking lot is small and doesn't have nice outdoor seating like they did at D.C. Ranch. The inside is still under work. Food was
good but seemed to get cold fast (maybe plates weren't heated?) and the pancakes were dry. They've always had the best at the other location. Server wasn't as attentive and no crayons and coloring page for kids. I'll give them more time but already miss the D.C. Ranch location and staff."}
{"text":"Wow what a great breakfast place!  I had the California breakfast burrito with hash browns and coffee and my wife had California eggs Benedict with hash browns and coffee.  Both were excellent and plenty for a medium to large appetite!!  We would definitely recommend this place!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful new find! My family of four were all happy with our meals; including my husband who ordered his meal with a side of biscuits and gravy (and he is very picky with these!). The diner style setting was cute and the outdoor seating area was quaint in a sophisticated way. We received great service and my husband enjoyed that he could watch the football game this morning without it being an overbearing portion of our breakfast."}
{"text":"I am so unbelievably disappointed in his place. I have been coming here with my family for years! Today for lunch, my business decided to call in an order, only 4 thing... pretty simple. After placing the order the gal on the telephone asked \"did you call the correct restaurant, we are not the one near Dutch bros\" so I replied no I must have called the wrong location... her response was appalling, she said to me \"figures\" and HUNG UP THE PHONE!!! So I called back after looking up the location, turns out that location was closer to me than the other, if she would have told me where it was located I would have been more than happy to continue the order! Well, I called back, told a different person that the girl who answered before had hung up the phone and was incredibly rude, and she told me it didn't sound like anyone that worked there would do it, well they did!! So I placed my order again because it was a more convenient location to my business. When picking up my food I asked if there was silverware, napkins, Salt&pepper, jam, ketchup, and maple syrup on the bag. And yes, I was that specific. The girl told me \"everything you need is in there\" so I tipped them $10, which was about a 25% tip and when I get back to the office there is nothing in the bag other than our food. I actually had to stop at McDonald's for silverware because there was none in the bag. Well, I called the restaurant and asked to speak to a manager. There was no manager on site so I spoke with the chef, he told me he didn't have the authority to do anything about our awful meal except apologize. No comps or coupons just an I'm sorry. Embarrassing. And don't even get me started on how my eggs were cooked well done instead of over medium. I will never be back and the customer service was absolutely awful. I highly suggest looking into what employees you are hiring at this location and firing a handful because they are not cut out to be in this field. It's a shame because this use to be my favorite place for breakfast and lunch but seems like it's garbage now."}
{"text":"Amazing place with a nice, bright, and open concept to it!  A little crowded with the furniture but who cares right!  Service was awesome, waitress didn't give me a dirty look when my order was complicated like others would, pancakes were awesome!  Just in case I didn't mention before, Pancakes=AWESOME!!!!  Omelette was very fluffy and so delicious!  Come to this location!  It's to die for!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"No extra charge for egg whites! Great new location for them. A little hard to find -- if you see Flemings, you'll see the Joynt, which is right next to it. 

Great egg dishes, and they have steel cut oatmeal, which is what I make at home. The only negative about the restaurant is that it's a bit small. Nice outdoor seating though, so if the weather is good, you'll have some great seats"}
{"text":"This is probably my best breakfast i ve ate it I recommend everyone to going this place,,, have a great breakfast  i am sure you guys will be like it"}
{"text":"We drive by this place once a week and wanted to try it. So we finally made time to try today. I ordered the most popular item on their menu california benedict and it was just OK. I've had it better at other places. We were five people and our food almost took 40-45mins to get, we weren't very happy with that, since we had 3 kids with us. The only thing I liked was the pancakes menu lots to choose from."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food but the waitress was a bit surly for us. We had a larger party and a number of the orders were mixed up or incomplete and we had to ask for more coffee from another waitress. The location has moved a few times so maybe when they have been open longer the experience will get better."}
{"text":"The best breakfast in Scottsdale!!  Joynt burger is amazing. Chicken fried chicken breakfast is the bomb. Excellent and friendly service."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast, the ham was so delicious and our server, Raymond was very personable and fun!  Excellent service!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed breakfast here. Since it was a weekday after 9am it was very quiet, so the atmosphere was very relaxed. The place is clean, including the bathrooms. The food is excellent and we'll priced, and the ingredients seem to be good quality: my fruit crepes consisted of fresh strawberries and blueberries, not fruit from a can. My husband's hash brown looked like real potatoes, not stuff from a dry-mix. My only complaint is that the coffee tasted a bit watery, and could have been stronger. Finally, our waiter Richard was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive (without being annoying). Will definitely return if in the scottsdale area again."}
{"text":"We had wonderful service and food was prepared quickly and was delicious.  Special bonus for Chicago sports fans and my hubby is a Cubs fan so score!  Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The Breakfast Joynt was such a cute find. The atmosphere was something to be seen and the food was plentiful. The service was a bit slow and our coffee was cold before our next refill but other than that I would give this place a thumbs up."}
{"text":"The food was good but not amazing, portion was average but nothing more and the preparation was competent. No disappointment but not overwhelmed either.

I'll go back as it came across as reliable."}
{"text":"Fun place for a yummy breakfast.  Love eating outdoors when the weather is nice.  Servers are wonderful.  Can't wait until it cools down again and we can enjoy the patio again."}
{"text":"All the favorite breakfast options under one roof - the Breakfast Joynt has got you covered for all your breakfast wants and needs. They have outdoor patio seating with umbrellas to block some of that Arizona sun. I was with some very fair skin northerners who aren't accustomed to the blazing sun and they went out of their way to make sure every inch of our table was covered with shade. They may have went a little out of their way but it was a kind gesture. This place is great for families and the hungriest of hungry. They have a huge selection of different benedicts, pancakes, waffles, sandwiches, breakfast burritos, fried chicken and waffles, biscuits and gravy - literally every breakfast dish you could imagine. I ordered the California Benedict which included bacon, avocado, and tomato. Also, I couldn't pass up a side of biscuits and gravy which was delicious. Thick white gravy smothered over fluffy buttermilk biscuits. My boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffles and really enjoyed the sirracha maple syrup that came with it. The chicken was homemade and the waffles were huge, large enough for me to enjoy some. Our friends also enjoyed their dishes and commented how large the portions were. I'm very happy we found this place and would frequent it often if I was nearby."}
{"text":"I got a waffle to go and after a weird bite I turned to around just to find it covered with black plastic. Not sure if it's the container melted or something else. Even without the melted plastic this was a very mediocre $8 waffle."}
{"text":"Came here with a group of four and no reservation today, Sunday, around 11:30 - probably one of the busiest times to go for brunch. They were able to accommodate us in 20 minutes, which was fantastic. The location is conveniently within walking distance of a Dutch Bros coffee shop, so we were able to pop over for a coffee before breakfast. When we were seated we had immediate service, and their menu is very expansive. They have something for everyone - Benedict's, chicken and waffles, tons of sweet options for French toast, pancakes, and waffles, burritos, Mexican, you name it they probably have it. There is definitely something for everyone! I had the biscuits and gravy eggs Benedict plate, and it was delicious! My partner had the Benedict with corned beef, and he thoroughly enjoyed it. The friends we were with both got the chicken and waffles, and they both seemed to enjoy it. The bill for the two of us was $20 ($25 with tip) which seems quite reasonable for brunch. All in all I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place and will definitely return when in the area again!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and every time there is usually a 15 minute (or longer wait). This place is popular! Once the wait was so long (and I was so hangry) that we had to go somewhere else for brunch. That isn't the usual since most of the time we've been seated within 15 minutes. 

The location is great and there is plenty of parking. They have a nice patio but no permanent overhang - just a few umbrellas. This isn't very beneficial when it's raining (no one can sit outside) or when it's too sunny (not enough shade). This can be overlooked since most folks don't want to sit outside during the summer, but otherwise it's something they could improve on. 

The menu consists of regular breakfast fare - pancakes, omelets, biscuits and gravy, etc. The prices are pretty inexpensive, especially for the amount of food you get. Most items come with hash browns and the option of toast or pancakes. I'm a sucker for pancakes and they are really fluffy here.  

My first experience here I ordered pancakes with scrambled eggs and bacon. I requested my pancakes to be blueberry and they were delicious. The next time I ordered biscuits and gravy with over-medium eggs. The gravy is fantastic here. (My husband has ordered chicken fried steak several times and he can attest how good the gravy is.) A third visit I ordered an omelet. As for toppings, you can order your omelet with all the toppings you want. (I chose ham, mushrooms, and cheese but the options are pretty limitless.) In addition to the regular menu, every week they have a special. One visit my husband ordered the special - which was southwestern biscuits and gravy. This time the gravy was spicy with jalapenos. It was different but I much prefer their regular gravy.  As for drinks, they have pretty good coffee. 

Overall, this is a great breakfast spot that I have shared with both family and friends. If you are in the neighborhood or up for an adventure, I'd definitely recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"My 8 year old and I went there for the first time today and I must say I have never been more impressed with a place on our first try. The place is adorable- very modern, veteran/American type atmosphere in my opinion- we loved! The service was phenomenal. My son wanted crepes but then saw Oreo pancakes- and asked if they could make Oreo crepes- and boy did they deliver! The manager came out and introduced himself and welcomed us. We will definitely be going back and telling friends about this place. I am floored by the good food and excellent service. My son was so excited that he \"created\" something because they told him he made a new menu item!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place was good but nothing spectacular. The food was good and there were a couple creative things on the menu, including the Captain Crunch French Toast. I tried the California Benedict. I liked that they chopped up the bacon but my eggs were a bit over cooked and didn't really have any yolk left. I like the location but the atmosphere was just kind of blah; no music, nothing fun or exciting about it. They do not serve alcohol so if you are wanting a mimosa or Bloody Mary for Sunday brunch then don't go here. The hostess was very sweet but our waitress seemed a bit put out, she was nice just very short with us. All in all it was good but with all the other great breakfast spots in the area, I may not go back for awhile."}
{"text":"First time at this place.  Food and service was really good.  I will go back again. It is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great service, great food and an overall great experience. Owner/manager gave me complimentary Red Velvet waffle (which was delicious) for my birthday. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Gluten Free pancakes and bread!! They don't say it on their new menu, but they have it. Had the pancakes as a side since they are hard to come by. Even without the gluten free, meal was great. Breakfast is usually easy, but good breakfast like this is harder to come by. Cute place to boot. A little hard to find because it is a large center, but glad I did."}
{"text":"awesome place awesome customer service very relaxed breakfast spot for all ages and the owner is from chicago a home town guy."}
{"text":"This place is very cute, and the service was really great from Kelli. The coffee was not good and cold, and the hash browns were cold, too. The juevos rancheros did not look like they would be good, but they were. I would give this place a try again, but hopefully the coffee will be better next time."}
{"text":"Don't like the new location at all.
It feels wrong.
Food and service are good."}
{"text":"The breakfast Joint is in an amazing location.  For years there has been a void in North Scittsdale for Breakfast food restaurants.  It's hard to not do at least a decent breakfast and the Joint dose a really good one.  The wait can be an issue.  The people are super friendly and the place is clean!! Great neighborhood spot!!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great service! Would recommend to anyone who works or lives by to eat at this place at least one or twice a week! Delivery time is super fast!"}
{"text":"This was our first time to the Breakfast Joynt. We were immediately greeted. Very friendly staff. The manager came around and introduced himself. Food was very good. We will go again."}
{"text":"There is so much to say about this place! For one, when you go out to breakfast or lunch you want something quick, convenient and variety. This place has it. They will customize anything to fit your needs. The owner, named Dave comes out to check on people and ask how everything is! I'm guessing it's a family buisness , and definitely get the family feeling there. It's very laid back and good quality food. I've read some reviews and I'm confused because I've been here many times and it seems those 2 star interviews are people that are not being completely honest. I read one comment saying \"they don't use real maple syrup\" REALLY? Name one breakfast place in Arizona that uses REAL maple syrup straight from a tree spout from Vermont. The price of real maple syrup is so high that the restaurant would have to raise prices on pancakes just to compensate. It's not logical in Arizona. I have a feeling it's some snowbird complaining about that . This is one of the best restaurants I'm willing to drive from GOODYEAR to their location for pancakes , or sweedish crepes or if I'm craving lunch I've had the turkey bacon wrap,  and I've had the Ruben in a wrap, also their salads. They are huge!  You can tell the salad bowls are chilled in the fridge before they're made because when they come out the bowl is ice cold which keeps the salad cold if you're eating outside . Everything is thought of here and everyone who works here really seems to enjoy it...happy employees means good service and good food. Really impressed. Kudos to the employees and owners!"}
{"text":"First time here. They did not disappoint, great food. The Chorizo Chimi was very satisfying and every bite had everything in it.. The price was on point as well."}
{"text":"Delicious food, cal Benedict, chicken fried steak, Swedish pancakes, and even the egg white omelette were all awesome."}
{"text":"Really loved it.  Had to wait a bit for a table,  but that's not a problem.  Food great, and really friendly, smiling wait-staff.  Definitely recommend for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I have been following Dave & Becky and the crew around for years wherever they set up shop! Love the menu! I'm partial to the biscuits&gravy.  Love the chicken fried steak. A lot of my friends love their Bennies too. 
They make lighter fare also. Loads of salads,  grilled chicken.  Yum!
Now they have 2 locations.
Sometimes I run into Becky at Costco.... what nice people and good homestyle food."}
{"text":"Awesome eggs! Great service. I love this place. Just moved from Cali couple months ago and I've been coming here every weekend."}
{"text":"Although we're from out of town, we travel to PHX often and this restaurant is going down as one of our favorites!  Thank you for having a great breakfast place!  Service was great, best omelette we've had in quite a while, and the restaurant was clean and the coffee hot!"}
{"text":"I am glad a reasonably priced, family breakfast restaurant opened in my neighborhood!  The service was great, the restaurant was very clean, and the food was delicious.  I had the waffle platter. The bacon was amazing!  Keep up the good work guys!"}
{"text":"Not terrible, but not good.  The avocado toast was pre-prepared guacamole on toast.  The corned beef hash was from a can.  The service was decent and the prices reasonable...but I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"I live in the area and watched this location open.  I've been waiting for a chance to try this place and finally did!  It was a Friday AM around 9am and they were quite busy.  I would have loved a booth but there was none available so we sat at a table which was fine.  There were also tables available on the patio (about 4 total), but we chose inside.  With the roll-up doors UP, it was almost like being outside anyway.  

Excellent service from our waiter.  He was very pleasant and well-timed.  My coffee cup never went empty.  

I ordered the Basic (mine with scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and english muffin).  This was a LOT of food and could easily have been shared by 2.  Bacon was good quality, thick and meaty, must have been 4 eggs scrambled, a load of hash browns.  My husband had cinnamon french toast - same story - waaay too much food for one person.  4 really THICK (2\") pieces of bread, and while the batter was very tasty, it was unevenly soaked through the bread so some pieces were a little soggy and some were barely covered.  

We looked at their lunch menu, lots of sandwiches, burgers and salad choices there.

Glad to have Breakfast Joynt in the 'hood.  In the future I would trim down my breakfast order and maybe try the smaller portion menu.  I look forward to visiting again, next time we'll try lunch."}
{"text":"Good place for breakfast. California Benedict was a good choice. Portions are large and food was served fast. Good prices with a fairly nice environment, outside seating is available. Solid."}
{"text":"Great food, service and atmosphere! Love it for business meetings. They also make amazing lattes and cappuccinos!! Try it!"}
{"text":"Country fried chicken was amazing!! 10/10 recommend. Hash browns weren't very crispy though. Portions are good. This place is near my house so I will come back if i'm craving some breakfast. Service was great and food came faster than other breakfast places i've been too. Will try more off menu next time!"}
{"text":"Great place for Breakfast and Lunch. Must try the Ultimate Breakfast Burrito. Benedict selections, can't go wrong. Staff is friendly and inviting. Food is quick after ordering, locals and visitors would enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Great food. The build your own omelet is amazing. Huge portions. Pancakes are huge! Haven't had a bad meal yet!!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best Crab Benedict I've had in a LOOONG TIME!!  Not to mention the fresh OJ and the service!  All are impeccable!!  I'm a pilot so I have to travel a lot and this place is OVER THE TOP! 
WELL DONE!!!!!"}
{"text":"Such an awesome place for breakfast and I'm sure lunch.  I had the crabby benny and it is amazing!  No crab with a \"k\" here...fresh asparagus, kick ass crab, great hollandaise.  My daughter ordered the crepes which are huge and full of gorgeous fresh fruit.  The service was fast and friendly.  The atmosphere is clean and inviting. I would highly recommend this joint!  YUMMA!"}
{"text":"Felt like home; the food was hearty and the waiter was welcoming. I would visit again for breakfast the next time I visit Phoenix."}
{"text":"Our breakfast had more lows than highs. The front room by the open garage doors was half empty with dishes still on all the free tables. Ugly, and the greeter naturally wanted to sit us in the back room at a clean table. She gladly agreed to sit us in front when we asked, but it was 10 minutes to get one table cleared by the sole, dazed and glassy-eyed busser.

Our server was great, handling several tables with ease. Wish the kitchen and busser were as good as him. And where was a manager? Pancakes were served raw. Server apologetically brought replacements. They were undercooked, too. Bacon was cold but still thick and good. My dining partner loves hash like the kind from the can and said his was very good.

All in all, other than our server, I don't think The Breakfast Joint really cares about one's experience with them."}
{"text":"This might be a good place to eat but... they have oversold their Kitchen capacity! Uber orders come and good faster than in the Restaurant
Orders. Tables full waiting with piles of Uber orders ready.  Bottom line is if you come here will be await for Breakfast. And the wait staff which there are a lot,can't fix The kitchen being undersized.
Paul's bowl was good but stressed Sunday breakfast. Even received an apology.  But..."}
{"text":"I love the entire shopping center very cute and inviting and this place was no exception; adorable. 

The espresso was pretty good, not the very best, but I would get again. 

I tried the irish benny, but wish I had gotten something else. Most of the components on the benny were pretty good, but the corned beef hash tasted like it was your typical canned variety. So next time I would get something else altogether or just a different type of benedict; luckily they have a large variety!!! My friend had chicken fried steak and was happy with his choice. He said it tasted freshly made. 

I will definitely go back again"}
{"text":"Great food, great service.. can't wait to try everything on the menu.. The Banana cream pie pancakes are great. The corn beef hash Benedict is one of the best ones I've ever had."}
{"text":"Every time we come here the food is always delicious. Their menu is huge and everything I've ever had has been amazing. Service is fast and friendly and Ashley is always fun to have. My kids love the bacon pancakes!!! I have no favorites, I think everything is good!"}
{"text":"We came here in a Sunday afternoon looking for a place close by home to grab brunch. Anyways, I wanted to try a new place that just opened so Breakfast Joynt was it today. Don't get me wrong on this review. I really wanted to like this place a lot. 

We walked in and the place just woke me up. Nice bright colors with popping blue. Very clean and interesting. We had to wait a few to get seated and got one of their booths. 

We were greeted right away at our table and got our drink orders in. Since the place is called Breakfast Joynt, I figured I better try their breakfast. 

I ordered the French Toast Platter which comes with two French Toast, two eggs, and two sausages. French Toast was ok. Nothing really stood out. Poured a lot of syrup but just okay. I got scrabbled eggs and they weren't that fluffy. Just ok. I got two sausage patties which were good. So the breakfast was okay. Nothing to write home about. 

My wife ordered a one egg any style and it came with hash browns and toast. She really didn't like it and I was surprised. She said the eggs weren't fluffy and she thought that the eggs were just reheated. So she wasn't very impressed. 

I wanted to order a latte during our meal but we couldn't find our waiter for the longest time. We had to ask another server to get our server and he finally came. The latte was really good. After he brought us my latte then he was all over us like fly paper. Ready to serve and help with whatever we needed. 

So overall this place was okay. Not great. The food was okay. Service was a little iffy but friendly. The atmosphere was nice and bright but they do keep the doors open to give it that open air type of feeling cause they have outdoor seating. Only problem is my wife didn't like it cause there were flies bugging her while eating. Not good. 

I would like to try the place again to give this place a second chance but my wife really doesn't want to come back. So we will see if we make it back here."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre. We had breakfast; waffles, eggs, bacon. Nothing outstanding about the meal. Coffee was cold, had to wait for a place setting. The service was horrible, staff couldn't care less. Absolutely NOT worth a repeat visit."}
{"text":"Located up in North Scottsdale, it holds it own with other great breakfast places in the valley.  I loved the red velvet waffle. It's dessert and breakfast all rolled into one.    They have a omelette where you can add everything including the breakfast sink for one price.  Service was exceptional from the friendly hostess to the waiter."}
{"text":"Bruce's breakfast bowl is great! Just get it! The Owner came up and asked if everything was good - that's nice customer service. It's a Mom & Pop type place and I love that!"}
{"text":"Good portion sizes, we shared a breakfast meal and a side. Prices are fair for the amount of food you get. Everything was prepared very well. We would come back."}
{"text":"Breakfast Joynt is a great locals place.  It is a little hard to find,  but make sure you find it!!   Breakfast is served all the time they are open   Everyone on the staff is friendly.   The owner,  David,  is usually around and he obviously appreciates the bus7.  BTW, the food is always great.   They have good specials weekdays.  This is definitely a keeper! ."}
{"text":"Great little place for breakfast. Nice ambience and very clean. Breakfast prices are very reasonable. Try the eggs benedict. Outdoor seating available. The patio is dog friendly."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Had the eggs Benedict and basic breakfast. Atmosphere was quaint and Chicago. Learned later the owner is from Chicago. Reasonable price and menu selections were a variety. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This is a great place to grab breakfast.  I've been there on two occasions now with friends. Each breakfast has been very good! This location may be a little out of the way for many people, although it isn't nearly as packed as other breakfast restaurant / cafes you might find closer to the heart of Phoenix. 

I would recommend giving this place a shot for breakfast or lunch if your looking for something casual,  friendly and clean."}
{"text":"Stoped in for breakfast, friendly service, staff and well prepared food. The Egg Benedict selection is awesome!"}
{"text":"So happy this place is finally open! Breakfast is delish and the staff is smiley and friendly - awesome way to start the day. My favorite is the sausage gravy ((homemade!)) and my husband loves the quinoa bowl. Everything at the other location on the menu is great and I'm sure this will be the same. Thanks for being"}
{"text":"Not a great experience in the least!!! After dropping my daughter off at school I decided to pop in and have breakfast. I usually get a Benedict anywhere I go. I chose the chimichanga. The lovely waitress saw I didn't like the chimi and asked if I'd like the Benedict instead. I said yes I would. When she asked the manager (Dave) to take the chimi off my bill he rudely laughed. I felt so uncomfortable and I will never go back because of him. Besides the food was just ok. The service was great tho."}
{"text":"Good food and friendly service near the 101 & Bell.  Seating near the windows was a bit drafty making our food cold. I enjoyed the Chicago skyline.  I didn't partake, but there was a nice offering of Mimosas.  The French toast,  try it!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes...  they were soon dashed when my food arrived.  Ordered their omelets, love that you can pay 11.99 and customize your omelet with whatever toppings/fillings you want.  My omelet arrived and it was over cooked on the outside and completely raw on the inside.  The filling had frothy egg \"juice\" running everywhere.  The replaced my meal with no questions asked with the joynt style eggs Benedict.  The hasbrowns were barely browned and the English muffin was wet and soggy and there was no apparent attempt to even toast the English muffin.  The kids ordered the same meal - eggs Benedict and the muffin was toasted and their hash browns were on point.  So clearly I got the half cooked version.  My husbands sourdough toast arrived partially burnt.  Serving burnt toast in a breakfast place is a fail.  I could've make perfectly burnt toast at home for FREE!  Anyhow, Butters, Butterfields, 40th Street Cafe, Snooze AM eatery are all top notch choices in the same area.  Never had a bad meal at any of those places. Two stars because the eggs benny would've tasted great if it hadn't been soggy, but I wouldn't risk my money on it again.  The place wasn't even busy enough to warrant another undercooked mistake."}
{"text":"Great option for breakfast/brunch in the DC Ranch area. Lots of great options to appeal to the picky or selective eater. One of the few places in north Scottsdale, so come the weekends, it can get busy with a good wait. Suggestion, use that time to get some family & friend pictures on the property as its a popular spot for photographers!"}
{"text":"MEH!
Service is good for this type of place, but the food needs help.
Popped in for lunch. l had the Old School BLT and my friend had the Chicken Caesar. 
Mine was OK. The bacon was good, it was the LT that needed help.
Same for her salad. Her lettuce had seen better days. I was just hoping this place would have their act together better than this..."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is amazing the staff is so friendly,  the breakfast Fried Chicken is very good and the sausage gravy  definitely if you're in the area I recommend stopping by"}
{"text":"I am so glad this wonderful breakfast restaurant has made the successful move from DC Ranch. I love the new location it's very convenient and there's lots of parking. I had lunch there today and had the BLT salad which was fantastic. It was like combining breakfast and lunch together. The staff and the owner are great. Give this place a try"}
{"text":"I love the food and great location. Awesome little breakfast spot. I think the prices are good for the food you get, quality and quantity. Highly recommend the omelettes."}
{"text":"I was amazed by everything. I got the omelette, which was huge, fluffy, and you could put as many items in it as you wanted...no extra charge. It also came with Hash browns and two huge pancakes. I was stuffed and it all was cooked perfectly as tasted wonderful. This will be my new Breakfast place for sure! They have so much to offer, it's a must if you are close by. Try it out!"}
{"text":"Went a few years ago and was left unimpressed; gave it another go and left again, unimpressed. It was nothing amazing, rather a little less than ordinary as my hash browns came out burnt and toast lacking a good amount of butter. As said, plain but satisfactory in the moment of convenience."}
{"text":"They served imitation maple syrup with the waffle that had absolutely no flavor and barely a sweet taste. It is a rare occurrence when a waffle is not entirely consumed while we dine. In this case, we barely ate half. No point, unless it tastes good. 

An up charge of $1.50 for real maple syrup? Why don't you work that into the price of the meal? Considering the area, you'd think that would be the case. 

No desire to go back."}
{"text":"Took some family members out to breakfast one day and just happened upon this place. We ate outside and it was quite lovely. The food was delicious and the prices were very reasonable. Will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Best bacon. Hands-down. Love this place. They use local breads and pastries. Locally roasted coffee from \"the press\". Coffee is so good. They have a nitro cold brew I highly recommend. My favorite is the breakfast platter. Eggs bacon and French toast. Simple but delicious. Their French toast is so good. Stop in and give it a try"}
{"text":"So yummy! Finally a place that has waffles, pancakes, crepes and Swedish pancakes. I got the Swedish pancakes with the Kids Pick 1 egg meal that came with toast and hash browns and 2 pieces of bacon. Delicious!!! My bf got the Bruce dish and it was amazing !!!! (It's like the spuds deluxe from Snooze but way better) 
I can't wait to go back! Great service and a nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"We were greeted by a not so friendly server.  Even though he thought of our kids first, he seemed to not want to be there.  After we got our food, someone in our party had an allergic reaction because of cross contamination, as she was very specific about her allergy.  The owner came over and offered to make her new eggs, but never apologized and did not take it off the bill.  We will also charged a RIDICULOUS amount for our kids drinks ($3, the same as adult drinks), and $2 uncharge for their chocolate chips, of which was no where to be found on the menu, not were we told.  I would not go back because of the attitudes of the owner and staff.  Food was OK."}
{"text":"Great breakfast!
Waffle was awesome.
Swedish pancakes were very tasty.
Omelete and hash browns were perfect.
Vincent was a wonderful server.
Just visiting for the weekend, but planning to go back...well worth another trip!"}
{"text":"Poor service and bland food. There are way too many good breakfast spots in Scottsdale to waste your time here."}
{"text":"We just walked in cause we were heading to Lasikplus for my surgery and we found this place nearby. It's very nice and colorful. Waitress was really nice and attentive. The food was amazing. The bacon is delicious. My husband ordered chicken and waffles, delicious  he said they are the best he has ever had. It was so good that we decided to stop by again after my follow up checkup. It's a great place for a great tasting breakfast. Great customer service."}
{"text":"Visited a second time to see if there was any improvement over our first experience. Unfortunately it was was worse.

First the service was lacking. Tables seated after us received their food well before us.

Next the food was below average and not cooked properly. When we gave feedback to the waitress she said all she can do is take $2 off the bill.

There are better places for breakfast in the area that we will going to."}
{"text":"OK, so its hard to screw up Breakfast, but it is also hard to make it stand out........

Both times we have been here, we have been pleasantly surprised!! 

I had the Lump Crab meat Benedict and it was more than ordinary, and I got the Sweet Potato Fries instead of Hash Browns.

My father in law had the Swedish pancakes because he has been to Sweden multiple times and said they were just as good as being there!! LOL!!

Next time we are looking forward to going for lunch (they are open until 2)......"}
{"text":"This place is hidden away in North Scottsdale at DC Ranch.   My wife and I discovered it because we go to Grimaldi's Pizza a lot which is located in the same area.  The DC Ranch area has a lot of very good restaurants right there within a block of each other.  Restaurants like Flemings, Grimaldi's, and the Herb Box. Nice place to go for breakfast and a short walk to enjoy the scenery. It has sort of a diner atmosphere and the food and service is very good.  You can eat inside or outside under the umbrellas.  I usually have the sausage and eggs and they rate right up there in my top 5 breakfasts entrees.  They also have a killer cheeseburger."}
{"text":"Can't say enough about the service and food here.  The food is so fresh and flavorful.  I have eaten here 7 or 8 times and I have never been disappointed.  Very clean friendly staff good location.  My favorite breakfast in the chicken fried steak.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Although I think the move from Market Place was a bit of a downgrade, the food here is still fabulous.  I had my doubts when I walked in to pick up my to go breakfast order but that doubt evaporated quickly.  I was immediatly tended to by a young gentleman who assured me my order was coming soon.  He even went in the back and I could see him putting my to go order together.  EXCELLENT service!!  When I got home I was not disappointed.  The food was so deliciuos and I'm pretty sure this is still one of my favorite restaurants for breakfast and lunch.  Don't get me started on their hamburgers!  Yum.  I wish you guys all the best in your new location."}
{"text":"Fabulous place with killer breakfast entrees!!

Waffles are from heaven ; served by personal angel Julie!!!  We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Visited 4/10/17- great environment good service and fresh good food.  I needed to make some changes to my order & they were very accommodating. I loved the vibe of the place!"}
{"text":"Great service and food is always yummy.  Wide variety of breakfast items. Great omelettes. Worth the wait.awesome neighborhood find."}
{"text":"Just as good as the original location. Great service. Food is always great! Consistent and the new location looks great!"}
{"text":"Beautiful Airy new location in DC Ranch in Scottsdale off Pima Rd! Nice Patio and good service from owner and waitresses ! Breakfast was the same as other location and look forward to returning on weekend !"}
{"text":"Had looked forward to visiting this new location after having great food, atmosphere and service at the other location. Service was great but we were very disappointed in the stark presentation and consistency of the food. Gluten free pancakes at the other location were excellent. The ones we were served here were uneatable. When we told the server, the pancakes were taken away and the cook admitted that they had substituted the ingredients because they had \"run out.\" However, we were not offered a replacement until we asked and were charged for the uneaten pancakes. Lots of great breakfast places in the area. Will not return to this one."}
{"text":"Excellent spot - gets busy quickly so get there early. The staff is very friendly and the food is great and made fresh and delivered to the table fast. Had the California eggs benedict with house made hollandaise and it was very tasty. Prices are very reasonable and breakfast for two came out to $ 26.00.

The breakfast joynt also has great patio seating with misters."}
{"text":"Nice local breakfast place! Great bright atmosphere serving as an oasis in summer. Food and service have always been spot on. Hearty breakfast choices, good coffee, and a fun place to sit comfortably to chat with friends."}
{"text":"Ive gone here a couple of times now and nothing I've tried has impressed me. I had the California Benny, which wasn't very appetizing and probably wouldn't order it again. I've also ordered the joynt toast which was average, they give you way to much smashed up avocado...I probably waisted more then half of it because their was an absurd amount of it. The Oreo pancakes were very good, I think they are known for their pancakes because they have so many different types. I recommend trying their pancakes."}
{"text":"I do not normally post negative reviews but wanted to share my experience. Went to breakfast at Breakfast Joynt this morning with my fiancé. He ordered the fried chicken breakfast. I ate a couple bites of his chicken near the end when we discovered the chicken was completely raw. The manager took the dish off our check, but didn't seem concerned that we both consumed completely raw chicken. I will never return again."}
{"text":"Very nice and friendly staff. Decor is bright and pleasant. The menu provides several tasty options. The coffee is a high blend and pleasing. Honestly, if you are looking for a reasonably priced and high quality breakfast, you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I have been following Dave,  the owner of the Breakfast Joynt.  For YEARS!!!

The other location was nice, nothing compared to the location now. 

The reviews that are negative, are a little harsh. 

The food is always spot on, Richard is the man to wait on you.

Try and correct the problem before you give this Restaurant negative reviews.

Everyone has an off day,  that includes all of you who gave the horrible reviews.  


Signed Loyal customers."}
{"text":"Love the new Place.   Had breakfast here on Saturday.
Service was excellent from Summer.  Food was yummy as usual.  The baked goods are to die for.
Sticky bun is a must.

Going back today for lunch!!! 


Dave and Becky never disappoint us!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here 5 times and the service has been friendly and prompt.  Food is consistently good at breakfast.   This is my first lunch meal.  Also good but I think breakfast is better.   (Hence the name!).  Strongly recommended!"}
{"text":"The place gets very loud. Lots of family's come in from the DC Ranch area. But the food is good. I had the California Eggs Benedict which was excellent & my husband had biscuits & gravy and that was good as well. Service is great. Once the weather cools off and we could sit outside that would be the perfect situation with this place."}
{"text":"I've been here 2 times now. The first time, I got the strawberry pancakes, which were great but not anything mind blowing. The second time, I got the French toast, which tasted like the kind you can buy in the grocery store frozen. The prices are a little above average, but it is in the Scottsdale area, so that's to be expected. All and all, a solid \"Breakfast Joynt\" but nothing above average."}
{"text":"Cute little place.  Went twice, once on a weekend and once on a weekday. On a weekend you might have to wait a little while for a table it was pretty packed. But on a weekday there should be no wait. I'd say it's pretty reasonably priced. The service was kind of slow when we went on a weekend but that's expected. The waitress kept us loop as to why it was taking long and offered us some free food, can't remember what she offered but she was very nice. The second time it was kind of slow and there weren't a ton of people there. The waitress was a mess. She forgot my drink. Didn't ever come back to get us more water or drink refills. And she switched our orders with another table. There was only 2 of us. Shouldn't have been as complicated as she made it. Not a pleasant second experience. I liked the country fried steak. Ordered it both times."}
{"text":"It's located in the back of the Market Street center next to Flemings. 

I bought the breakfast fried chicken w/ 2 pancakes and an orange juice and thought it was pretty good. I give this place a 4/5 stars.

Service was great - always asking if the food was okay or if we needed anything else."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times right now and will never return.  The service is terrible, we waited 45 minutes for our food today and they still didn't bring everything out.  We watched our waitress walk in circles but never check the kitchen for our food.  Each visit has been the same.  The food is ok, was once served a raw egg that I couldn't even send back for them to finish because no one came and checked on us.  The prices are far too high for mediocre food and horrible service.  Wanted to give it a fair shot since it is so close to our house but never again!  Original Breakfast House is worth the drive and the wait, fast delicious food for a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Meh.  I think this place is overrated, overpriced and overhyped.  Just my opinion.  I ordered the chicken and waffles.  It was pretty bland overall, although the siracha syrup was really good.   It honestly didn't seem much different than something I could probably make at home.   I guess I'm spoiled with LoLo's Chicken and Waffles and had high expectations.  The iced tea wasn't very good, tasted a bit bitter.  For the wait (about 30 minutes to get seated) and the price it just wasn't worth it for me.  Service was adequate.  For me I'd rather just eat at a Waffle House.  Faster, cheaper, and tastier in my opinion.  It looks like some people really enjoy this place though so try it out for yourself."}
{"text":"I ordered there special southern quinoa special. I was not really good. I usually eat at the good egg restaurant and order there power quinoa bowl and it is really delicious.. not like what they have here which is not good at all.. sorry.."}
{"text":"Very nice neighborhood spot it's airy they have it open so you can enjoy the weather very pretty blue decor!! Food is excellent and you can share a meal the portions are huge!!  Vegan, gluten free many options here!! They are open for breakfast and lunch only so get there early!! I'll be back?"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast!! Friendly staff, fresh food and reasonable prices! If you like Chicago or are a fan of Chicago teams especially the Bears...you will adore the decor. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Very decent breakfast joint with good prices! Nowadays places like B.L.D and even Snooze AM are very pricey (over 10$) but the prices for most of the dishes were 10$ and under ( for large portions) food was good, pretty typical diner style and homey. I ordered the corned beef hash and it was exactly how I like it. my boyfriend got the chicken fried steak-delicious but the steak was on the small side. my mother ordered the turkey club with sweet potato fries-very yummy and huge. I'm from gilbert but I'd definitely come back for a good brekky! (especially after a good camelback hike!)"}
{"text":"burnt eggs with a mysterious runny center .. num num. burrito was microwaved and almost tasteless. service was good .. the only redeeming factor."}
{"text":"What csn i say so bad got byrrito took a few bites, tasteless, figured ide take it home for lunch,after i add  sauce,i tasted it again and threw it out and i dont throw food out!! It was 12$. Wont go back too expensive.cant even get toast or donut  with coffee."}
{"text":"Fun breakfast restaurant, very good food and service."}
{"text":"Wonderful food & service!! Hash browns are delicious and so are the waffles :). I wasn't too impressed by the coffee however but there's always Starbucks!"}
{"text":"Coffee was locally roasted and delish.  This little place is deceiving!  From the front it looks like your typical strip mall place, but then you walk in and it's bright, airy, industrial and fun.  Our server was helpful and attentive.  Food was very good!  We kept thinking we'd like to come back with our grandkids-who love chocolate chip pancakes.  They have lots of benedicts to choose from, waffles, pancakes/crepes and egg dishes.  

I had the healthy egg white breakfast. It was packed with asparagus, tomato and spinach.  It does come w/ cheese, which I declined.  My husband had the Bruce's bowl and it was chalk full of hash browns, breakfast meats, he added some chili verde and topped with two eggs.

We will be going back!"}
{"text":"Been ordering here for the past few months, usually the breakfast burrito to go or through Postmates. The food is always reliably good and is prepared quickly. Only had one bad experience where I was out on hold way too long, but still no issues with the food and it was ready when I was told."}
{"text":"I enjoy the food, especially the 'ham off the bone' but when they're busy (e.g. Sunday mornings) either they don't have enough wait or kitchen staff. Seating was relatively quick on our visit on 6/6 but once the order was placed, you just had to settle in for a long winters nap!
I'll be back but will be very mindful of the day of the week"}
{"text":"Favorite place to eat Benedict! California Benedict is my absolute favorite. Highly recommend coming here if you want a really good meal and a family friendly environment!!"}
{"text":"After reading all the positive reviews, we decided to try a new place.  The staff was wonderful, service was excellent, however the food was less than desirable.  Since it was later in the morning, we ordered breakfast as their menu indicated that \"Breakfast Served All Day\".  After we ordered our food, our entrees came out within 1 to 2 minutes after we ordered.  That seems way too fast.  The food was cold and the hash browns were overcook and cold, so my guess is the food has been sitting out and not cooked to order.  Needless to say, I will not be back...there are too many breakfast places in the area that serve better food."}
{"text":"My 89 yo mother and I were seated immediately at a cleared, but not wiped down booth. I took her walker to an out of the way area. When I returned,  mother was being  served coffee and water at the unclean table. I Requested that table be wiped down. It was. Order taken. Food delivered. Omelette and pancakes tasty per my mother. Midway through breakfast, I tried to get server's attention for coffee to be refilled to no avail. I asked the hostess for a refill.  Six minutes later it was refilled. I paid the check with cash. I was due $11.76 in change. Only $11 was returned. I asked hostess about the incorrect returned"}
{"text":"It's worth the drive to get their red velvet waffles and bacon. It's a must try! They also have very good berry crepes. Try the build your own omelette which my husband and son love. Kids menu is also available here. Reason for minus one star was coffee. I'd recommend getting your coffee fix elsewhere either before or after breakfast."}
{"text":"Awesome spot for breakfast with all homemade goodies. Plus they have incredible lunch as well which is very underrated. Have had the breakfast fried chicken topped with a delicious sausage gravy two eggs, hash browns and toast, which was amazing. Today had the Joynt burger (sirloin and brisket mix) which is topped with a fried egg, bacon and cheese. Delicious. Check this place out. It also has a Chicago theme to it."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a few years. Food is always on point with good friendly attentive service. Large portions at a very fair price. Everything from breakfast to lunch and excellent coffees. Check it out if you're in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Love love love this place 
We are die hard Scramble fans but I am so much more Impressed with this place. The food was amazing. The atmosphere is great. 
Our waitress was Juanita. She took care of us like we were her children. 
Definitely will recommend this place."}
{"text":"Yum!!!!   Hubby says one of the best omelets ever!   Eggs benny (California style) was cooked to perfection.  Super service and great coffee.  Find this place. Worth it!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service.  I live close by and have tried it twice.  Last time I walked out since they had plenty of servers standing around and nobody took my order 20min into sitting there."}
{"text":"We are visiting from California and stumbled upon the Breakfast Joynt. It is super cute with a fun, carefree vibe. Fast and friendly service and delicious breakfast! If you have't tried this place, do it, you won't leave disappointed ( or hungry )."}
{"text":"This is a much nicer shopping center than their old location down on Northsight behind Kohl's.  Things started off on the wrong foot as it took awhile to be greeted by our server, and when she finally greeted us it was someone who had been walking back and forth past our table several times (yes, some of us notice that sort of thing).  It wasn't terribly busy.

We ordered a good variety of items and all were rather average diner breakfast food that you can find anywhere, but perhaps without the same price tag and fancy shopping area.  Pancakes were the biggest disappointment as they were really tough in texture and quite laborious to chew unless they were heavily saturated with syrup.  Also, hash browns had a sort of dirty oil taste.  Eggs were fine, omelet was ok, but it is odd that the cheese omelet is $6.99 but adding items from the long list of omelet ingredients bump it up to $9.99, if memory is correct.  For 50% more in price I would have thought they would load it up, but a few of the added ingredients were quite sparse in the omelet.  Orange juice was excellent.  Coffee was forgettable.  Didn't have any of the meats, but the menu repeatedly tells customers that their meats just fall right off the bones.

There aren't a lot of full service breakfast restaurants in the nearby area."}
{"text":"5 for everything except their tea. We've eaten here at least 18 times since the week they opened. We know the owners and we have come to depend on the place for breakfast after 11 on a Saturday. I am a tea drinker and often have. My tea in a \"to-go\" cup just to brew it in a quantity that will maximize the low-end brand bag. Similarly, my coffee-drinking friends pronounce the brew \"fair.\"  We're it not for this important breakfast staple fumble, I'd give five stars. 

The Swedish pancakes. Sub them for your carb! They help make it happen; you'll be so glad you did. The place really caught on lately. Locals are swarming it, so prepare to wait. Park around back in the Safeway lot; skip Market Street. 

Bacon isn't that thick - sausage is a better protein option, I think. Eggs and omelets are really good and never undercooked, which I praise the kitchen for. Good water glasses too - stay hydrated!"}
{"text":"It's the little things that make a difference and this place has an eye for all of them. From the warm syrup to the friendly manager that made sure he touched base with every table and customer.
This is customer service and appreciation done right.
It's more than just breakfast-- it's people choosing a place in which to start their day.
If they keep this up, this will be a neighborhood favorite in no time. Congrats!

Side note, their bacon is finger-licking' good! Make sure to get a side of that ;-)"}
{"text":"Good location friendly staff. Nice selection on the menu. I had chicken fried steak. Great sausage gravy. Nice neighborhood joint."}
{"text":"Wow wow wow!!! The food is amazing here! We always go to the same breakfast place but drove by and decided to try it, and it may be our new favorite spot!! The decorations are so cute and vibrant and the food is incredible. This is a must go!!!"}
{"text":"One of my new favorite places to eat in Scottsdale! Had one of their eggs benedicts and it was awesome!"}
{"text":"Adorable interior. Great plate sizes. Just enough food. Home cooked taste. And the service was perfect. My husband loved the garage doors. ."}
{"text":"The Breakfast Joynt is the new breakfast meeting spot for my networking group every Thursday Morning. Today was my first visit. I had the The Basic which includes 2 eggs, choice of meat, hash browns and toast or pancakes. It is a lot of food, so much that it comes on 2 plates. I went with the ham, two large strips. Everything was freshly cooked precisely as ordered and tasty.  I forgot to take a picture, but I will next time. The menu is very extensive including chicken and waffles which looked great on the plate of the woman to my left. 

Service was also top flight. We were having a meeting in the private room. Our service was attentive on things like drink refills without being intrusive which was exactly perfect. We had the backroom for our meeting a great spot."}
{"text":"The restaurant was busy, at 9:30 am on saturday, but the wait time was minimal. The service was attentive & helpful...I ordered the \"gringo\", scrambled eggs, sausage, cheese, onions etc all wrapped in a flour tortilla served with a side of salsa & hash browns. Delicious.."}
{"text":"First time here, I ordered the huevos rancheros , iced cappuccino. The Huevos Rancheros was topped with green chili, two eggs over easy with re fried beans and corn tortillas and a side of hash brown potatoes. It was tasty and just enough for me. Nice atmosphere, open air seating. Definitely will come again!

    This was my second time here for breakfast. I ordered chicken Fred steak hash brown potatoes and scrambled eggs and English muffin. Service was fast food was good. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"This location is much brighter and more cheery than the DC Ranch location. It has the same awesome Southwest biscuits and gravy! My husband gets the full order and I get the half order and we are both very satisfied. They even have a coffee menu now that includes espresso etc. so you don't have to take your coffee in from the Dutch brothers next-door. Service was great."}
{"text":"Small restaurant in the shopping plaza on the corner of Thompson Peak Parkway and Pima, not easy to find but worth seeking out. 

Ordered the Build Your Own Omelette with Hash Browns and Pancakes which is an insane amount of food, 
The thing about their omelette is you can order an huge variety of ingredients in your omelette and not limited to a few things. I had bacon, sausage, turkey, ham, chorizo, mushrooms, asparagus, and provolone cheese. This also came with fresh grated hash browns and 2 pancakes. The Hash Browns were cooked perfectly and the pancakes were thick and fluffy.  I also liked the fact that they give you a big bottle of syrup so you can drown the pancakes in syrup if you choose rather than some places that give you a small little dipping container.

2 Egg White Breakfast and the Pasta with Chicken was good but the pasta was on the dry side.

If you come here order an Omelette"}
{"text":"Super cute place. Reminded my husband and I a bit of a Californian beach cafe. Food was a little slow, but service was great. The food was super yummy! And...for me, the best part was that they have amazing gluten free pancakes!! They don't even really advertise it (didn't see it on the menu)...but when I asked they had both GF pancakes and toast! I got the breakfast bowl, and it was huge and delish. My husband got a breakfast burrito and he loved it. Hash browns were cooked perfect. OJ tastes fresh. My only complaint was that they didn't offer fresh half/half - only those gross little plastic containers of creamer. But I would still come back! I might just bring my own coffee. ;)"}
