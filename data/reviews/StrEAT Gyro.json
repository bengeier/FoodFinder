{"text":"Got a Gyro from the truck today and it is AWESOME!!  Perfect after all of the food over the holidays!! They also have terrific Falafel!! If you see these guys - chase them down! Grab a Gyro!!"}
{"text":"This truck just came to our apartment complex--we only got hummus and baklava, but it was amazing! I'm a harsh critic when it comes to both items, I've had plenty of hummus and baklava in the last 30 years, so it takes a lot to impress me. Both were authentic and delicious :-)"}
{"text":"Not 5 Stars but Very Good!  Great guys very personable and quick service for cook to order.  If I am being super critical then the greek fries were a bit greasy and chicken shawarma was a tiny bit dry.    For food truck this was really good!"}
{"text":"Had a chicken shawarma sandwich from this truck at a festival while visiting Glendale.  The taziki sauce was bomb! It was delicious, and seemed fresh and authentic.  I wish I knew where they were all the time so I could follow them lol"}
