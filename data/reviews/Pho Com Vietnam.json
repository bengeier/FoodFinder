{"text":"Heard good things about this place, but it went downhill as soon as I stepped into the washroom. This place is really, really dirty. The washroom had a couple bugs around the sink, and what took the cake for me was the cockroach on the dinning room floor. Nasty. Avoid this place it's disgusting."}
{"text":"Stumbled across excellent food completely by accident. Pho, Pad Thai, and vermicelli and chicken all superb, with very generous portion sizes."}
{"text":"Went here with mom for first time and we are both pho-fanatics but picky about where we dine. Well we were both very pleasantly surprised! The pho noodle was WOW! Broth was light and delicious, didnt leave us thirsty like typical MSG-laden soup served from the other pho chains. We also had the bamboo-duck soup which is a very authentic viet dish and again we were both impressed.  The service was quick and friendly, the establishment clean and spacious. Price very reasonable, likely comparable for area.  Will definitely be back and highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"First time here, ordered my standard of BBQ chicken vermicelli and spring roll. This was made perfect.   The spring roll had a perfect mixture of taro and noodle, it was crisp, the BBQ chicken was super fresh, well marinated and cooked perfectly. The vermicelli noodles vs other places were served warm. Bean sprouts and lettuce was also fresh.   This was a take-out order, the restaurant inside isn't that great looking but the food I had here was fantastic."}
{"text":"Service can be OK, price not bad, but quality of food seems to be going down-hill as well as heavy use of cleaning chemicals being used to clear the venue while customers are eating.  So I've been to this venue with m'lady quite a few times, however the last time we went, we decided to not go back again. Why you ask? Well my noodles seemed to  be of a pre-packaged nature (think Mr. Noodles), and it seemed  the rest of the contents were quite similar. Why go to a restaurant to have pre-made food when you can get the same stuff at the grocery store?  Prices have always been decent, and I like that they accept credit & debit cards.  Customer-service isn't the best where they don't seem to pay much attention to you after they've brought your food over.  Cleaning the floors with heavy chemicals while people are eating doesn't help the ambience of the venue.  All-in-all, although I've visited this venue on numerous occasions, I feel it's time I find a different venue in the area to frequent when I am starving in the area, so I'm quite unlikely to return to this one."}
{"text":"Went here cuz of the amazing yelp rating, and that I didn't feel driving all the way west to ossington. There was no on in the restaurant at the time, just one \"worker\" the son, and the dad came out for a few minutes. I had set the bar so high for this place, and let me tell you it was good. BUT BUT there was one ingredient in the broth, can't quite figure out what it was, but it didn't belong, and made the broth unbearable, and therefor I didn't eat more then half my pho, my friend had the same issue. Will try this place again to see if it was a one time issue, or that's just the way they make it ."}
{"text":"Was brought here by my viet bro :) university students occasionally need warm hearty noodle soup to comfort our broken heart from assignments and exams... love their pho, generous size, I order medium and never get to finish the noodle. Guys guys don't forget to get durian smoothie if you are a durian fan. It's soooo good!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service!! Generous portion size and enough meet, unlike others that only gives you a few piece of beef in the whole bowel!"}
{"text":"Pho Com Vietnam is located at a strip plaza right on the southwest corner of Jane and Finch.   It was one of my two \"go-to\" spots for Vietnamese food when I was a student at York University, primarily due to proximity.   The food here is pretty good - nothing near the best I've had but it's more than enough to satisfy cravings.   Try to stick to core offerings at this place - pho, vermicelli, rice and meat dishes. I can vouch for the quality on those - not so much the other auxiliary offerings. I had the tom yum soup once and left craving pho.   Service is typically quick. Pay at the cashier when you're ready to leave."}
{"text":"We went there this afternoon for a quick bite, the service was excellent, the place was clean and we enjoyed the meal.  We ordered 2 grilled minced pork fresh rolls and the grilled pork chop and grilled chicken on broken rice that we shared.  Also included was a bowl of soup which was luke warm.  The tea we received when seated, was hot, which is what we like.  Also the pork fresh rolls came with a peanut sauce, but we didn't finish the rolls as the meal itself was plenty.  We took the rolls home and will try them later, along with the peanut sauce. The wait staff we had was quite friendly and pleasant.  I usually like pho, but here the small pho was $9.00 which is a bit pricey compared to other pho restaurants.  However we will probably visit this place again."}
{"text":"This is my 4th or 5th review on a pho/Vietnamese place so if you read the rest of my reviews on the other places it's all the same pretty much."}
{"text":"Asked for a an extra egg, server never showed up with my egg...  Drinks came when I was almost finished my meal.  Got there at 9:00pm, it was 9:58pm ( they close at 10:00pm ) and i was almost done eating, maybe 5 more minutes.  One of the workers told me to take my food out because they're closing....are you serious? I know your closing but don't kick me out....let me finish my food, like I was almost done.  They brought me the bill and I said \"no change\" and the waitress asked \" No,tip?\". I said \"yeah, the change\" & then she said me 2 more times...... \"No tip?\"   Maybe if you didn't rush me out of your shop, brought me my egg, and made sure my drinks came on time, I would have actually given you a tip and not just the change.....  I know your closing but at least let the customers inside finish their meal...."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Whattuuup Jane and Finch! This place has good pho and some great appetizers. Of the main dishes I've tried, I haven't been too impressed. Last time I went, I ordered the bean curd/shrimp appetizer which was amazeballs, as well as the deep fried squid which was bland. The decor is homey, the place is spacious, and the service is friendly. There's a tank with some ugly fishies to stare at if you get bored.  Stick to the pho and you'll enjoy :)"}
{"text":"This restaurant may not look glamorous or be in the best neighborhood but it sure does serve some awesome food!!!  Yeah, sometimes it can be a miss depending on the day but most of the time we're aren't disappointed. The service is good, the food is fresh and done with a lot of taste.  Most of the time we order the duck noodle soup because they do it really well compared to many places we have tried in the past.  I love their Vietnamese iced coffee and their orange juice is fresh squeezed.  Their salad rolls are good most days. Some days you might get a not-so-fresh plate if they're pre-made.  We probably come here at least once a week. YUM!!!"}
