{"text":"Oh my god SOO slow!!!! I've been in line at the drive thru for 10 minutes for a Frisco Burger and there are still two cars in front of me!!"}
{"text":"Hardee's now has a new concept, on top of offering burgers, fries, hot dogs and chicken sandwiches, they now offer Mexican fare.  Yes ladies and gentlemen the Southern staple of Hardee's now sells taco, burritos and nachos.  Being from Rocky Mount; I've always been pro Hardee's since that's where they were founded and I used to enjoy eating at their original first location.  I'm a little bummed that they no longer serve the Big Deluxe, but I'm still a fan of their cooked to order burgers.  If you're new to Hardee's, I suggest trying the breakfast food first.  It's extremely greasy and fattening and will probably make your chest hurt for a few hours, but man is it good.  The burritos and tacos are better than taco bell, however a little more expensive.  You also can't beat their thick burgers with all the fresh toppings.  Nearly everything is cooked to order with the exception of breakfast, so anticipate at least a 5 minute wait at the drive thru.  The inside is fairly clean and spacious, so eating inside is a good option also.  I also recommend the sweet tea."}
{"text":"Close to my house. Nice people. Hardee's food and service. What is there not to love?"}
{"text":"I don't usually give 5 stars to fast food but this was excellent.  The food was hot and tasty.  We got the frisco melt.  You could really taste the smoked ham   Also we got the platter.  Huge amount of food for price.  Very nice staff and very clean restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. They are slow and they could careless about it. Wait 10-15 min in line for a kids meal and no one was in front of me!!!"}
{"text":"They are horrible at customer service. I waited in line this morning for 25 min. They screwed up so waited another 10 min. The food is mediocre. This Hardee's really needs some help."}
{"text":"Worst location ever, rude employees and snail paced service.   I forgot it was bad, may I never forget again.  HORRIBLE!!!"}
{"text":"They aren't as slow as the slowest Wendy's, Bojangles and Subway in the city, which all happen to be within a mile of each other right here.  I'll give them that(even though that isn't saying much).  That said, the inside isn't very clean, staff isn't overly helpful or nice, but hey, this area is kind of ghetto and I guess all that is to be expected.  I might come back if I want a hamburger as there is no burger king close by."}
{"text":"Hardees offers huge burgers and its not the fastest because huge burgers take time to cook.. If you want fast food it may not be here but ill wait with a smile for quality. . The best burgers in town. ."}
{"text":"So I don't frequent fast food restaurants often, and it's usually because of the experience I just had.  A friend and I went through the drive through (it was just before 9:00pm). I tried to order chicken tenders and was told that they don't have anymore for this time of night. I know in fast food terms, that just means the employees have gotten lazy and stopped making them. Not even an apology. I was stuck ordering something I didn't even really want.  I ordered the nachos. Although there was a car in front of us, I do feel like waiting 15 minutes for our order was just far too long for a \"fast food\" restaurant. It's clear to me that this particular Hardees is just mismanaged and should probably be evaluated.  Also - just as a side note as to the attitude of the employees - lights were flickering on and off and so when I looked inside, one of the employees gave me a very discomforting look."}
{"text":"They are slowwwwwww! Haven't eaten here in yrs. Don't plan on going any time soon. Want a good burger, go to Jack in the Box! Curly fries? Go to Jack in the Box! Don't waste your time. Hardeez used to be hot! Times sure have changed."}
{"text":"Worst experience ever.  From cashier who does not listen to rude cook and incompetent management.  Too many other places to eat close by... save your money"}
{"text":"So slow will never stop here again. Plenty of places to choose from go there if in a hurry."}
{"text":"Great customer service- I don't think I have ever been to a fast food place that had professional quality customer service representatives/workers like this location at the drive thru nonetheless!!"}
{"text":"Service is very slow.  Not sure why kitchen isn't more efficient. Usually 15 minute wait at drive through, when you're the only one in line.  Love the grilled burrito, but be prepared. It's not \"fast\" food."}
{"text":"Awful hardees location. I go here in the afternoons mostly, and have had awful experiences every time with employees and attitude. Rude drive through customer service, awful attitude towards customer's. The disdainful looks I receive at the window every time look like the employees are doing you a favor giving you food. I only stop because it is on the way home and the food is decent to grab on the go, but awful location. The franchise owner should either restaff entire store, or be forced to give up his restaurant. Corporate office should be embarassed to let this location continue to operate with this level of service. I would give them a -10 stars if was an option."}
{"text":"Came through drive inn and took forever. Ordered 3 soft chicken tacos and one hard shell beef taco. Chicken was processed and tasteless. Got a soft beef taco instead of hard shell. Woman running drive thru didn't have my order right. First time eating here and is my last."}
{"text":"It's fast food.  Some of the burgers are great.  Service is usually slow but attendants are usually well mannered"}
