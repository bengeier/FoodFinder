{"text":"I hoped for a basic tuesday night at home with some basic indian food. Did not have high expectations, i just wanted a basic meal. I ordered online, and it took very long to receive my meal...and it was dead cold, i.e. more than cold-ish.   The Naan bread was dry, very dry and all was missing in spices (mild and hot). If this had been a 10-12$ school cafeteria lunch, it would have been a half-decent lunch. But as a 26$ basic-combo dinner from a restaurant, shameful. Go to Parc-Extension for good indian..."}
{"text":"New indian restaurant in St Denis. I came here with some friends on Saturday night. The service was one of the best I have had in my life. Super friendly and fast. The food was really good. We all ordered different stuff and we all loved our meals. The bread and the rice is really yummy.   The only down side is that the bathroom is not very clean.   Overall, very good experience. Good prices. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Worst indian food i ever had. there cottage cheese was so hard and when i especially ordered my food to be extra spicy it was still too sweet and there kulcha naan is just onions garnished over a naan."}
{"text":"Very disappointed overall. The food was bland didn't even have the taste of Indian spices whatsoever. Never again!"}
{"text":"I frequently stay at a hotel close to this restaurant and have walked by without stopping in many times in the past year.  My desire for a quick, easy Indian meal overcame the Yelp review based reticence and I took the plunge last night.  Have to say that I was pleasantly surprised!  The Vindaloo was fresh and appropriately spicy and the lamb curry was executed with a rare sense of balance.  The combos were also an exceptional value.  During my most recent stays I had the opportunity to dine and take out; both options resulted in similar quality experiences. I noticed that a lot of the negative reviews on this place seem to involve third party delivery services and coupon redemptions.  This  place is very reasonable options for high quality Indian in Mid-town Montreal."}
{"text":"Used a coupon on a take-out order, so they overinflated the prices by using the prices from the sit-down menu instead of offering the normal take-away prices and prices a special meal as separate items on top of that. So we just feel like we were ripped off and won't be returning. So, you got us to try your food and your restaurant, but you left us with the lasting impression that you are dishonest and not a place we want to go back to. What's the point of the coupon if you are going to chase away the people you want to come to try your food? Avoid!"}
{"text":"It's safe to say that you can do much better with Indian food in this city. The food does not stand out in any particular way given the (relatively high) prices. Although this is one of the few Indian restaurants on the Plateau, you'd be much better off heading to one of the ethnic neighbourhoods (Jean-Talon or Cote-Sainte-Catherine) for Indian food and trying out a better restaurant whilst on the Plateau."}
{"text":"Went to eat there with a friend bought a groupon and they charged full tax on our bill and tried telling us we only can order from a special menu when it said spend 20$ and get 40$ worth of food.   The butter chicken tasted like Campbell's soup tomato soup, not cool guys.  Had to light my own candle it's so dark in there ... It's the little things people.  The plates were good but only a spoonful of salad, Twas super good tho but should of hooked it up.   They weren't a fan of the coupon I think which is kinda stupid why do one at all then."}
{"text":"Le service est très bien, le restaurant est très sympa et les prix sont plus que corrects. Leur spécialité -le poulet au beurre- est juste incroyable! C'est l'un des meilleures restaurants indiens que je connais."}
{"text":"Leurs menus sont plutôt intéressants et la personne qui gère les commandes sympathique.  Cependant certains plats sont decevants et leur attitude pas du tout commerçante : quand ils oublient quelques chose dans la commande il faut en discuter pendant plusieurs minutes au téléphone avant de devoir retourner chercher le plat manquant au restaurant (ou alors attendre 50min pour se faire livrer...)"}
{"text":"Pseudo cuisine indienne! Ici, on ne veut surtout pas choquer les papilles occidentales. Ou encore, le cuisinier est très mauvais. Dominent le sel et le sucre dans la cuisine du Rajastan. Oubliez la cardamome, la cannelle, la graine de moutarde noire et autres indispensables de cette cuisine complexe et millénaire. Des sauces préparées à l'avance et associées à la viande de votre choix. Pas étonnant que les saveurs attendues ne soient pas au rendez-vous.  Ainsi, nos choix, cari d'agneau et poulet au beurre étant issus de ces \"croisements gastronomiques\", nous fûmes bien déçus. Et gras ce fut.  Je crois que je continuerai à concocter mes caris moi-même à partir de ce bouquin trouvé dans une librairie d'occasion, en Angleterre et qui me donne des plats... \"wow... comme au resto... j'en r'viens pââââ!!!\" (dixit mes amis amateurs de bouffe indienne)."}
{"text":"They robbed me!  They literally robbed me!  After ordering take out with them maybe 30 times over the course of a few years they suddenly showed up at my door with half of my order.  I passed them my money and as I checked my order, realized, and  notified the driver he was halfway down the hall.  He gave me the finger, laughed, and hopped in the elevator.  I called the restaurant and the cook accused me of lying to get free food (after ordering with them that many times??? really???).  I am in complete shock.   These people are criminals.  I don't know what else to say.  Stay FAR away."}
