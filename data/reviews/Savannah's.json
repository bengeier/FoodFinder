{"text":"Best ambiance, food and service I've experienced in a long time.  Great girls day out escape.  The assortment of hot teas was wonderful.  We especially enjoyed the chicken salad and bread pudding dessert."}
{"text":"Really cute place!  We have a family and they have a large selection of Hats for the girls to wear while they are having tea. Needless to say the kids love it.   There is a large selection of tea's to choose from and the food is good. There are also great deserts that are made fresh in house.   If you are looking for a relaxing place to unwind this is a good one."}
{"text":"Wow- adorable house but that's where it ended. We skipped dessert at lunch to go over here. Giant mistake. First- the place was empty so busy was not an excuse.  I ordered iced tea and a slice of pie. Hubby ordered coffee and pie. Hmmm- where to start- pie was ok but slice was teeny tiny. Literally- 3 forkfuls . Tea and coffee were delivered after pie was finished. There was an apology - waitress was new- didn't know to serve drinks first.   I honestly though they'd comp drinks but no - $15.00 .  When I walked in, I texted a friend and said we have to try this adorable place.   No way- big rip off!!!!!"}

{"text":"Have always had a good experience there Was surprised at some of the other reviews, it is always good to me, had a very attentive server, had the tea for one lunch, loved the cucumber sandwiches with nuts, and had ginger peach tea which was very good.  Am pre-planning a baby shower, they were very helpful as to what I needed to do."}
{"text":"I recently hosted a bridal shower/luncheon at Savannah's Room.  The service was excellent and the food was fantastic.  Ruth and her staff were very eager to help with planning and honored all my requests.  I would highly recommend them for events as well as fantastic food.  You cannot go wrong with their deserts and the chicken salad is fresh and tasty!"}
