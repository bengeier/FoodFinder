{"text":"i was pretty excited walking into krispy fish and chips after reading two reviews on yelp.  actually, i was extremely hungry and was looking for something tasty and convenient while driving through whitby on my way back to toronto from a pretty long trip.

the place is definitely not a dive, and looks to have been recently renovated - or possibly just super super clean.

their menu was typical but also was serving clam chowder.  i wasn't really interested in it, but im sure it was delicious.  i ended up ordering the 2x halibut fish and chips at a cost of about $16.  

When my order arrived, i immediately thought that one fish was more than enough to satisfy my hunger.  the fish is pretty big.  it was really nice biting into this piece of fish.  the cook seasoned the fish with salt and pepper  (nice touch) prior to dipping in batter and deep frying.  the fish was krispy on the outside and not too greasy on the inside.  it was pretty good - i was happy.

the fries were perfect.  they looked home cut, except that they were a thinner than typical home cut fries.  some salt and malt vinegar complemented them well.

the only thing i was a little disappointed about was the coleslaw, but that's a matter of opinion.  i like creamy, sweet and crunchy coleslaw, however,  i felt theirs was not creamy and a little tart (from the vinegar).  although it wasn't a big deal, i still managed to eat it and was fine doing so.

overall, i think this place is more than decent.  the food is tasty, the service is good, and the place really does have  some character.  i reserve 5 stars for something more than fish and chips, but this place definitely gets a 4."}

{"text":"Had lunch here today for the first time.... Excellent fish n' chips--and I eat a lot of fish n' chips all over the place.... Home-cut fries cooked to crispy perfection, well seasoned, and the fish is generous, tasty, and covered with just the right amount of crispy batter. If you crave fish n' chips, you won't find better that Krispy's. ALSO: the service is spot-on friendly and fast. 

Highly recommended."}
