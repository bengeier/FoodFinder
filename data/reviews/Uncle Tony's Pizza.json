{"text":"I am so glad to have a good mom and pop pizza joint in the neighborhood!! The food is excellent, prices are great, and really nice people. I hope the place does well and sticks around for years to come. They will certainly be getting all my pizza night money from now on!"}
{"text":"I am from NY and its not so easy to find good neighborhood Italian food on the west coast especially AZ. Uncle Tony is fom Brooklyn and the eggplant dinner is REALLY GOOD and I am kind of an eggplant freak. I go all the time now and I even ask him to make the side dish of pasta fresh and cook it for 13 MIN and he is accomodating. Its very comfortable and casual dining and  very affordable at only $9.75 for the eggplant dinner which comes with a salad, side of pasta and italian bread if you dine in. I used to live around the corner but recently moved 12 mi away yet i still find myself driving to Tonys for the eggplant. ;) Good stuff!"}
{"text":"So i had to make an account so I could leave a review about this amazing place! I was somewhat worried with the reviews I seen but they were close to my house and promised it would taste like NY pizza. Omg! I am so happy I tryd  it because it was amazing! Tastes just like NY pizza and there wings were great and didn't taste greasy like some of the places I've been also there NY SiZED pizza not the little baby sized slices all those big chains sell.  I highly recommend them. They also have slices so you can stop in and grab a slice and a coke. Which is just what I need XD"}
{"text":"Tony's is my neighborhood pick for good pizza and Italian food. It's even served with a (small) amount of NY attitude to let you know you're getting the real deal. Seriously though, my BF and I have ALWAYS had fantastic, fast service any time we've eaten in or picked up.

We usually go for the classic pepperoni (delicious) but have also enjoyed the \"Taste of Italy Special\" and the spinach pizza. BF also often orders the subs, calzones and wings and I've tried a few of the pasta dishes and we have yet to be disappointed.

Give them a try! You won't regret it. We're so glad they came to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"We visited Uncle Tonys for the first time. I wanted some pasta so I figured my family and I would give them a shot. Upon entry I was a little hesitant. The place was dirty, there were several employees sitting in the dining area watching TV, there were dishes with old food on them sitting on top of a garbage can by the register. The decor was really out dated and the menu was a challenge to read but I thought we'd still give it a try. The girl behind the counter wasnt friendly and looked annoyed that she had to take our order(another red flag.) My niece ordered a slice of pep, my mother in law a slice of sausage and fried mushrooms, the husband ordered the \"grilled chicken Alfredo\" dinner and I ordered the chicken parmigiana dinner. First the salad and bread was brought out. The bread was delicious and fresh tasting. The salad with the Italian dressing was tasty as well. My niece and mother in laws slices came out first. They were happy with the pizza but the mushrooms were over breaded, bland and the ranch tasted flavorless. So needless to say things weren't off to the greatest start. Shortly after my husband was served his Alfredo. He didn't have any complaints other than the chicken being dry. I tasted it and by the looks of it, it had been boiled, and not grilled as the menu stated it was supposed to be. It was chewy, flavorless and had a grey color to it. A few minutes later my food was brought to the table. I crossed my fingers hoping it would be better but I was disgusted. The chicken was again BOILED to death! I make chicken parm all the time myself and I have eaten it many times at many other restaurants and I'm certain the chicken is supposed to be breaded and baked NOT BOILED. The pasta that was served with it was al dente and the sauce was good but the amount of water that was on the plate from the noodles was completely unnecessary. I'm not one to brush something under the rug, so I brought the plate to the front, told the cook it was inedible and asked for meatballs instead. I watched him plop 4 meatballs from a water bin on to a plate and cover them with sauce. My question is, why would you put meatballs in water if you have marinara sauce instead??? After tasting the meatballs I was surprised because they were good, just a little water logged. The cook asked what was wrong with the chicken and I told him the chicken was dry, tough and flavorless. He mumbled something and went back into the kitchen. The fresh pies they were pumping out looked AMAZING and smelled delicious. So maybe they should focus more on the pizza and stay away from the hot dishes. Overall my family and I were pretty disappointed in this place. Not sure we will be eating here again"}
{"text":"Friendly service, fair prices, and amazing authentic NY style pizza. Definitely will return, especially for catering parties."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. 
Great NY Style Pizza. Delicious. Fresh. Great prices."}
{"text":"I'm so thankful to have a great pizza restaurant in my new neighborhood!!  Pizza is one of my favorite foods but I'm pretty particular.  I love NY style and this place does NY style really well.  It's almost as good as Ray's on the 101 and Frank Lloyd Wright.  But I live near Uncle Tony's now and just have to say again I'm sooooo happy to have a good pizza restaurant close to home!!!!  Oh and there is a nice patio for outdoor dining when the weather warms up.  Can't wait!"}
{"text":"Bad service and rude employees don't make up for pizza that's only ok. Me and my GF decided to try this place out so we walked in and the employees that were working didn't say hi, or even smile just looked at us with contempt for being there. So after they rushed us to order we paid and waited. The food came out slow considering we were the only ones there. I'm never going back."}
{"text":"It's Jan 7th @7:20 My BFF and I just got two Hogie Specials, the man refused to make a club sandwich said we would have to buy three separate sandwiches@6.95 to put together a ten inch, disappointed. This Hogie Special had more fluffy bread and lettuce then meat.the three very thin would have put Subway out of business if Subway sold sandwiches 28th that translucent meat.I had to give it one star to be able to review.We ask a woman , her friend and little girl,\"How is the Pizza, looked yummy to me, the ladies said it's alright that's not the answer I want to hear about pizza. There was one very nice man with grey hair and the one that could have had better Customer service wears glasses and seem to have an attitude at least to us. Sadly a costly mistake $16 dollars and taking the meat off one sandwich to put it on the other still tasted bready lettuce and mayo.Worst place to get a sandwich."}
{"text":"Very comfortable atmosphere and really nice staff.  I only hope this place can survive through the light rail construction.  Four stars"}
{"text":"This place isn't for folks looking for ambiance or the latest trend in designer pies.  Having said that this is the best chewy yet crispy crust, but foldable and slightly greasy pizza pie that I've had in my near decade living in the valley.

This is your local mom and pop type of pizza joint that I think is run by two brothers.  Don't waste your time going to another spot for pizza because these guys seem to make nearly everything from scratch.  Not gonna lie though I was disappointed the cheesecake came from the freezer. 

Long story short, you'll never go back to the franchises or overpriced local \"designer\" pizza restaurants again."}
{"text":"This place is close to my work, so I thought I'd stop by. Best. Decision. Ever. Really delicious pizza, I went to the East Coast for a few months and have been craving NY style pizza bad. This place is great, the guys are friendly, atmosphere is great and pizza is delicious."}
{"text":"I like this place. Their delivery is SUPERFAST and the salads are HUGE"}
{"text":"I must say this is some pretty good pizza. The cheese pizza there & other originals I must say are delicious other than that meatball sandwich etc. Aren't really a WOW factor. Oh my the canolis (don't know if I'm spelling that right lol) are DELISH!!!! Great place to take your family nice & quiet. I would have gave this place 4 stars if not for all the construction going on in the area! Ugh! Other than that, you must give this place a try. Nothing special but won't dissapoint."}
{"text":"Excellent homemade manicotti and fettuccine.  I will be back.  Nice view.  Comfortable environment.  Nice covered outdoor patio."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery on a whim to try something different.  Was extremely impressed with the friendly service, great value and size for the pizza, and freshness of the toppings.  The pineapple must have literally been sliced fresh; it was unreal.

If there's any small complaint, the pizza had a ton of sauce, so it was hard to eat by hand.

But overall, a great new place in Dormont!"}
{"text":"So I just opened a Yelp account because of how bad this pizza was this past Sunday. Some buddies and I were enjoying football this past Sunday and decided to try this place out since it is close. We asked if they had any specials and they lied to up sell us the two large and 20 wings for an exuberant amount of green. We got there and I wondered why there were zero cars there and nobody inside besides the grease ball owner. We then saw the cheaper specials listed EVERYWHERE. Of course all would be forgiven had the bacon pizza beat our expectations.... The bacon was of very low quality and very fatty. The pepperoni was undercooked on the other pizza. The cheese was somewhat tasteless as was the sauce and the crust had no flavor whatsoever was partially burnt and they clearly used no olive oil. Basically they went in with no lube and didn't even give me a courtesy reach around."}
{"text":"do not order from here, the drivers will sexually harass you!!!! The driver took my number from the online order and sent me text. I called the business and they just made excuses. Completely disgusting."}
{"text":"Very very good!the guy is always the same to make my pizza n wings . spinach and cheese roll thing is so awesome,must try."}
{"text":"Great pizza! One of the best around this area (and they deliver). My only complaint though is that they never put enough sauce on the pizza and I have to order extra sauce. I never do that elsewhere but the pizza is just \"too dry\" otherwise. That minor gripe aside it is a killer pizza."}
{"text":"LOVE!

I was first introduced to Uncle Tony's pizza at a work training in nearby Mt. Lebanon. 
After the first bite, I was so glad we ordered from there! 
The pizza has a sweeter sauce and just the right amount of cheese. 
To me, everything about this pizza is perfect.
WARNING: You will want more than 2 slices! 

I've also had their grilled chicken hoagie and it was great!. The chicken is very fresh and grilled. You can tell that the chicken is not pre-packaged like the stuff some other pizza places use.

Overall, I am a firm believer that you will love this pizza! Delivery was super fast and it is free! If you're in the south hills area and looking for a new pizza joint, go here!"}
{"text":"DELICIOUS, FRESH, FAST! I was wary of trying this place but was enticed by the wonderful aroma coming from the business' building. I went in and not only got my entire order in under 15 minutes but it was fresh and cooked to perfection. I order pizza and wings both were scrumptious! I have grown tired of pizza places that sacrifice quality to pinch pennies. I know that Uncle Tony's Pizza uses Quality ingredients and still offers great prices for food. Definitely EAT HERE!"}
{"text":"Food was delicious!  Their zucchini is so fresh good prices  friendly service loved everything will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"always good pizza and wings. The best wings I had. Compared to wing stop and all other big wing shops this is awesome !!!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices. French fries are crispy and delicious, wraps are great, hoagies are huge and you have to try tiramisu it is amazing!"}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time, Tony was great and thennnn we moved farther away so when we are in the city we stop bye but not very often. Tony has gotten extremely moody and rude!! It really left a bad taste in our mouth for him to peer from the back looking really mad and just plain rude!! He has lost our business. 4 min passed 4 and no 2dlices with soda as advertised he claims there's a time now. He was just extremely rude and mad at the area around him!! Never again will he get a dime from my family!!"}
{"text":"I love turkey club sandwiches and order them from different places and this one... the biggest disappointment. I can't even really call this a sandwich - 3 very thick slices of bread that was few days old (it was hard and rubbery...), 2 slices of turkey  - it is probably oven roasted, but this is the kind of stuff you would get pre-packaged from a grocery store so it's salty and kind of slimey, a slice of processed cheese product and bacon cut into tiny little cubes that somehow doesn't taste like bacon aaand falls out of the sandwich.
so yeah, this is what I got. I wish I could just send this back... totally regret ordering from this place"}
{"text":"I've never been to Uncle Tony's pizzas actual location, but their delivery is pretty good. We've gotten it a few times and never had any complaints. Pizza is a thinner crust, which I like. They put the pepperoni under the cheese, which I also like. Delivery usually doesn't take too long and the food arrives hot. Their wings, however, are a bit pricy ($6.99for 6 wings, ouch!). They are open late and have a wide selection of items on the menu. My favorite thing about Uncle Tony's is you can place your order right here on the yelp app! No need to call & talk to anyone. I will continue to get delivery from Uncle Tony's."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place! I've never dined in, only always taken out, but it's always delicious. The pizza is the best, totally NY style pizza. And the wings... to die for. 

Not a huge fan of any of their dressings to dip, but that doesn't change my five stars at all. 

If you haven't ordered from here, put it at the top of your list for your next pizza night!"}
{"text":"I love this pizza joint. One of those local hole in the wall type places. Amazing food and service :)"}
{"text":"Really isn't that good, especially for what you have to put up with just getting your pizza. 

The owner is so rude, obnoxious, and cheap. In the past 3 visits he has literally yelled at me for not eating there more often, made me jump over his back wall to enter the restaurant \"from the other door\" because he refuses to let customers come in from one of the two entrances after 9 pm, and has tried charging me extra for cheese and pepper packets. 

The pizza doesn't suck but it really isn't great either. Wings are good but you have to get your own ranch becuase the owner even admits to mixing the ranch with water to thin it out and make it last longer. It's gross. 

There's this place called stumpys like 8 more minutes down the road and it's so much better."}
{"text":"Their food is good. They sometimes forget parts of the order, cheese sauce for the cheese fries and most recently the salad that comes with the pasta dinners but we still order from them."}
{"text":"Family owned and operated. The staff is super friendly and welcoming. Awesome pizza! Stick with the specials for the best prices. And the wings are delicious."}
{"text":"Absolutely disgusting! Ordered my food, two slices and a soda. When the slices finally arrived they were pools of grease and soggy as all hell. I ate half of one slice and said no more. Will never go back."}
{"text":"Real. Pizza. The best I've had since moving to AZ from NY.  If you're in the area and need some delicious crispy goodness this is the place."}
{"text":"Ordered an salad from this restaurant, took the food home and it was nothing but a small proten of meat and a lot of lettuce. I resolved this transaction due to having to pay $9.87 for lettuce, then he turned around and charged my card info for the $9.87 I had no problem with giving him his lettuce salad back. Gee he didnt even wear gloves when preparing the so called salad. He tryed to hurry up to close the lid and charge my card knowing that he just gave me nothing but lettuce...I will be reporting this business to the BBB of Arizona...ripping ppl off just cause his restaurant has no customers."}
{"text":"I hate ordering from the big pizza chains, but in this neighborhood it was the only option.  I saw Uncle Tony's was moving in and got excited.

The pizzas are good even the fancy white spinach pizzas.  The wings are extremely good.  I love the sandwiches. I order the Steak special sandwich regularly.  Call in orders are always ready fast, routinely ready 10 minutes after I have called in.

To comment on 'Chad M's\" rating the slices do look a little sketchy who knows how long then have been half baked and I have never tried it.  Get a full pie if you can you wont be disappointed.

If you are brave enough to weave around the light rail construction traffic cones stop in and give them a try."}
{"text":"Love their pizza and wings. Always wanted to try their other food but I haven't yet. Why I haven't tried any of their food? 3 words: PIZZA AND WINGS!!!"}
{"text":"I liked that the prices were reasonable, they had soccer on, and the pepperoni and cheese pizza slices were alright.   I didn't like the sausage pizza because it had way too much sausage on it, and I didn't like that they charged for refills."}
{"text":"I'm from Brooklyn, so I know pizza...and THIS IS THE BEST....thank goodness my boys came over and are serving me what I missed for so long! Service is great, fast, and the food is top notch, truly authentic NY...Chad M, you must be from Arizona, and obviously grew up thinkin domino's was pizza...sad for you...but there is NO PLACE BETTER...hoping they can survive the light rail mess; give them business, they are great guys from Brooklyn doing the best Brooklyn Pizza here for sure!"}
{"text":"Best NY pizza we have found in Phoenix and I am from NY. Big, thin slice with just enough grease, light smather of sauce & gooey cheese. The crust is the best part though... Still crunchy but soft.
No reason to go elsewhere. Thanks Uncle Tony"}
{"text":"Driving by saw this place decided to stop in, the owner was very friendly and helpful, even gave me a small history lesson on Italy. I had the steak and mushroom with cheese sandwich, it was very good, I will be here again."}
{"text":"I ordered a cheese calzone... OMG so delicious and hands down the biggest dang calzone I've ever seen. #yummo"}
{"text":"My husband and I just ordered a 16\" pepperoni and 20 wings half medium and BBQ. Let me tell you that this is the best pizza I have had I quite awhile!!! I loved it! This is aunthentic New York pizza. The wings are crispy and delicious. Is definitely our new go to! My mom and I were here last week for pasta and it is homemade and delicious too! Quite a pleasant surprise!!! Don't be fooled by the outside! Check out Uncle Tony's!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Sweet pizza sauce, fresh dough crust and the sub bread is top notch. They are fast and friendly.  I regularly order the Italian sub and meat lovers pizza. Wings are good too. Call em up!"}
{"text":"When I want a quick lunch I come in to grab their 2 slices and a drink deal. I love their cheese pizza. It's a NY style pizza - huge slice you have to basically fold in half to eat. I think it's a great mom n pop kind of place for a pie. I've also had their spaghetti with tomato sauce and a huge meatball. It was fantastic!! Why only 4 stars? I dunno why... but I'm still in love w Peter Piper's pizza. So, that's the standard I end up judging by. My wife on the other hand, would give this 5 stars I'm sure; it's her go - to pizza place for her cheat day.

Wings are fantastic!"}
{"text":"I have been going here for pizza and wings because they are just the best around but tonight, thought I would have an actual dinner.  I ordered eggplant parmesean an I have to say that it was the best I have ever had - and I cook Italian.  Plus, it was so filling that I have lunch for tomorrow.  Thanks Tony I can't wait to try your other dishes!,"}
{"text":"Uncle Tony's pizza is a great mom and pop shop for crispy New York style pizza. Service was within good time, I was expecting longer since it's mom and pop but was surprised it wasn't. Wings are also crispy but have a decent amount of meat on them. The sauce is thin and covers the wings well. We got the white pizza which needed some more garlic and herbs but was still yummy. 

The reason I take two stars away is because the place is DIRTY, dirty tables, dirty walls, floor, counter you order at. However back of the house looks clean from what I can tell."}
{"text":"I took another trip down to see Uncle Tony again! It's been far too long since my last visit and I couldn't wait any longer. Once again, Uncle Tony does not let down.  WOW!! DID I MISS IT!! I just got some slices today but holy cannoli this is the BEST NY pizza around! He's closed up his pizza shop in Brooklyn in exchange for the warmer climate of the Phoenix area and THANK HEAVEN for that because this place is a hidden gem in the desert! I'm so thankful he is here in Phoenix so I can still have delicious pizza and food!

As soon as I walked in Uncle Tony's today I can smell ALL the delicious food being made fresh! I brings me back to Sunday's at home with my family. Everything smelled soooo good I wanted to order slices, pasta, meatballs, wings.. I mean I wanted everything! But it's been a while I need my NY pizza fix. All of his food is cooked fresh right there.

I know I always say this but it's important, I was born and raised in NY for the first 35 years of my life. Lived in the Bronx and Yonkers and Uncle Tony's pizza out here in Phoenix is better than a lot of pizza places in NY!!! Uncle Tony won't let you down and I recommend this to anyone!"}
{"text":"Ordered Uncle Tony's for the first time tonight takeout. Maybe the worst pizza ever. It was so bland. All I could taste was the sweet sauce. Minimal toppings. The ranch was like eating a clove of garlic. My boyfriend and I ordered a large and ate one piece each, the rest is in the garbage."}
{"text":"Worst pizza, bacon, service, and prices I have ever seen. New York prices for a trashy product. I have had shady mechanics treat me better. Pure garbage!"}
{"text":"The thin crust pizza is on point. And Tony has that New York attitude that makes the pizza better. Get the 20 dollar special. xl pizza and 20 wings for 20 bucks. Support local business"}
{"text":"I Came in a couple nights ago and tried this place on a whim. We got Tony's special pizza on the menu and added olives. Tony himself made it and handed it me, very nice guy also. I was blown away by how good it was. Wow.. I must have another uncle Tony's special pizzas. I have had my share of pizza and this place is up there, it's soon good. Try it! You'll be pleased if you like great local pizza!"}
{"text":"Pizza was OK and certainly did not live up to some previous reviewers on the day my wife and I stopped by for some slices. 

Biggest disappointment was the pizza maker who was outside for an extended period of time talking and hanging with friends then when he returned, never washed his hands prior to handling food products. 

Large place with plenty of seating"}
{"text":"Uncle Tony's is some of the best pizza in the area. Why not 5 stars? The ranch is a little watered down, but that is OK...I can live with it. Can't go wrong with a cheese pizza, cooked perfectly, the crust is amazing, with a side of fried zucchini's. We will be back for a third time soon."}
{"text":"We were craving pizza, decided to try somewhere new and we were not disappointed at all! Had a classic pepperoni pizza and the bread sticks. It's very obvious the dough is homemade and it is incredible! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I been coming to this place for awhile now and uncle tony was angry when I told him my zucchini ' s were burnt and then when my pizza comes out I come to find that he didn't feel the need to cook my mushrooms like he normally does.... definitely my last time here..."}
{"text":"This place is as close as you can get to being in NYC without having to take a plane. I have lived in NYC twice, and I  love the pizza there, always missing it and wishing I could find it in here in  PHX.  When a friend brought me to Uncle Tony's, I  have to say, I was blown away,  I was SOOOO pleased.  I ordered 2 slices and a drink.....and it was by far the very best pizza I have ever had in PHX AZ  EVER.  If you have not been here, you are missing out, for it is as authentic as it gets.  (I would not hire them for interior design,  defintiely Not the best interior design, but hey, with such great pizza who cares.)"}
{"text":"Stopped in by chance . Took a chance and i am glad i did... very friendly staff .. pizza was amazing.  Will visit  again.  Thank you uncle tony"}
{"text":"My family's favorite pizza joint we love this spot and have returned several times they are the best and great prices too can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"We got delivery and I couldn't believe how hot the food was.  Normally delivery food isn't still steaming. 

The wings were great, not over cooked, very meaty and the honey BBQ sauce was good.

I thought the pizza was better than most. The crust and sauce has good flavor.

We will definitely put this at the top of our delivery list."}
{"text":"Ordered a family special #3 online.  Great online app!  Food was delivered in a reasonable amount of time.  Italian hoagie was very soggy and of ok flavor.  Bbq honey wings good size, not crispy at all and the sauce was weirdly clumpy.  Pizza was bland with sweet sauce, soft crust and light toppings.  Overall disappointed and most likely will not be ordering again."}
{"text":"We live vert close to This place, and we love it!! Thé owners are from new york, and thé pizza is Very Authentic!"}
{"text":"I had a slice of the cheese and a slice of cheese with pepperoni on top. Nothing special. No special or unique flavors, just ok pizza slices and not good enough to require a return visit."}
{"text":"Wow. I am eating right now and I have to say... First if all the environment is awesome from the décor, to the patio, to the extremely comfortable seating. Secondly, their food is amazing, in having the lunch special and wow. It's also extremely fairly priced. Thirdly, I met Tony and Uncle Tony, they are straight outta New York for sure! YUMYUMYUMYUMYUMYUMYUMYUM

I asked for garlic and sausage slice, they did not skimp on either, just the way I like it!

The only thing Ill do differently is that i learned that I love their sauce and next time I'll ask for got extra!"}
{"text":"I'm from Long Island and I love this pizzeria. Its our go to for pizza. Uncle Tony and the other guy are super nice and will always verify you got anchovies on your pie. They get a kick out of that joke. I recommend Uncle Tony's pizza for sure!"}
{"text":"Don't order Uncle Tony's Pizza if you like your neighbors. This driver couldn't be bothered with the 30 seconds it would have taken to pull forward and not block our driveway. I wish it let me post the pictures because the person who answered the phone didn't care!"}
{"text":"Ordered to go pizza here last Sunday. The guy on the phone was really rude. Had a medium pizza and 20 wings. $37 later was the worst meal ever. The crust was hard as a rock and the center soggy and nasty. I think they gave me yesterday's pizza dough and ingredients. Maybe if you eat in house it's better but I'm not going back. Fool me once! Pizza Hut and Domino's is better. Sorry Tony."}
{"text":"Uncle Tony's is...fine. 

There's nothing particularly memorable about the pizza either way. We order from them when Nick's is closed (they're closed on Sundays. Boo.) The bread sticks are good. Delivery was fast--about 30 minutes, so that was nice.

They messed up our order, which is oddly not surprising because the exact same thing, with the same toppings, had happened to me at another pizza joint. Pineapple on one half, bacon on whole was our order, but we got half and half. Eh. Maybe those two things are not meant to mix."}
{"text":"Heard about this place and was told it was good, so after reading reviews on Yelp, I decided to stop in and get some lunch. This spot is located at the corner of 19th and Northern. From the outside of the restaurant, it isn't all that inviting. The building is old and doesn't look like it's had a makeover since it was built. The inside also looks old, but it has that mom and pop joint feeling to it. Even though it was older looking, it was clean from what I could see. 

I and my guest ordered the Medium pizza with 10 wings for $18.99. Their medium pizza is 14\"!! Huge for just the two of us. Was not disappointed at all with the pizza and I'm not a big pizza lover. The crust was just the perfect thickness, just the right amount of sauce and lots and lots of cheese. Yum! I would definitely come back for more pizza here. Wings were so-so. The taste was good, crispy on the outside, but half of the wings were dry and the other half was perfect. I was disappointed since my guest had been here before and said theirs was so good! Will give them another try on their wings as I love wings!

There was a young man that took people's orders and a young lady that brought out the orders. Both were very courteous. The young man answered questions about the menu and items they had with knowledge to the customers who came in. Took orders professionally and asked each customer who paid with a card if they wanted/needed a receipt. The young lady smiled when brought out food, but other than that, I didn't see much of her. Both of them did eat their meal out at the tables while customers were there, but got up and took orders when people came in. Seemed kinda unprofessional to have the workers eating and getting up and down every few minutes to take orders. 

Will come back again soon as they have so many good looking items on their menu. 

5 stars for the customer service
5 stars for the delicious pizza
3 stars for the wings
5 stars for how clean and organized the location was"}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood about 3 years now. There are some absolutely great mom and pop places near the corner of 19th Ave and Northern. But alas there was no bar, no pizza, and sadly no place to go an watch a game. Now there is Uncle Tony's!!!  We been frequenting the place since opening week. For the people interested in the short review it is the best pizza around, beats the local chains that include Streets of NY, Pizza Hut and Papa Johns. They have really good deli sandwiches, our favorite is there Pastrami. as well as full Italian dinners. The food is really good the location is pretty standard, they have beer and games on the TV's, it was a pizza restaurant in a former incarnation. The food gets 5 stars and the place gets 4, I am gonna lean toward 5 stars for the Review.

A comment to the folks that gave this place only 1 star... Are you sure you didn't walk in to Pizza Hut? The Subway is right next door, did your buddy switch sandwiches on you? Really so wonderful to be able to get a hot sandwich or a hoagie from right across the street that is this good. MOM & POP shops can have an off day now and again, so far we have not experienced that here.

They have a lunch special that is 2 slices and a soda for $4.50, or any sandwich and a soda for $5.99. We have had at least 3 different ones all hot and very tasty. The Pastrami, the Beef & Cheese, and the Philly style Beef, Mushroom, Cheese. We have been very happy with the NY Style thin crust pizza. 

The other special that is worth crowing about is the large pizza and 20 wings any style... Mild Medium, Hot, BBQ ... maybe more all for $20 dollars. That is a value!


The menu includes other items that include Calzones, Salads, Appetizers and more... 

They have a web site, the current special is for Bus Pass holders, One slice and a soda for $1.75 check it out at www.uncletonysnypizza.com"}
{"text":"Before ordering a pizza and wings from this place I was stoked that maybe we had found a great pizza joint down the street...I WAS SO WRONG. 

We ordered a standard... Sausage and onion. When we it it home we were disgusted! There was probably half and onion on more on a medium sized pizza, the cheese was hardly stringy and the sausage was so ground it looked almost like pepper sprinkled on top. We were disappointed to say the least. 

We took it back to them, Wanted a refund. They refused to do anything about it calling them selfs professionals.... Blah blah blah. Obviously the guy making the pizzas was a noob or what ever. Eff this place. NOT COMING BACK. 

They will probably fall off the map soon. All the reviews that are posted have to be fake. Even the pictures. Nothing like what was in our box."}
{"text":"Good food as usual. But the kid that takes phone order has no people skills and you ask him a question and the old man chimes in.  I misunderstood the price of extra items on the pizza ask him about it and daddy chewed me for asking about it."}
{"text":"We love the sausage pizza and also try the eggplant! Buffalo wings are bomb. You won't regret this pizza, and the family who owns the place are very nice."}
{"text":"Just got a pizza from Uncle Tony's through the Postmates service and it was the best I have had. Their pizza is always great, but, this one was superb!  I got the Napolitana sausage, mushrooms and onions it was cooked to perfection. The Postmates delivery was so fast, the pizza tasted like it just came out of the oven. Can't wait to have the rest for breakfast tomorrow."}
{"text":"So far I can say uncle tonys is a nice small mom n pop joint, very courteous.  Sandwich's r good n so r the pizzas. They also have tvs inside with remotes u control what u wanna watch. Pretty cool establishment."}
{"text":"Such a great pizza! We ordered a meat lovers and it was loaded with meat! It's a little hole in the wall place but the owner is so kind and the young man at the front was willing to answer any silly question. As I am from Chicago, it's the little things that matter as far as sauce and bread depth. All around a great place! We picked it up but I noticed they had a tv inside and just a normal open table setup."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time. Great taste great customer service fast and quick I got two nice pepperoni slices and a drink all for 6$ bucks great prices and food"}
{"text":"PATHETIC! As any regular who lives in the neighborhood knows Tony's Pizza isn't doing so good. Business is always slow and Tony is always complaining about it. 

My daughter and I Were craving a greasy cheese pizza and hot wings. I try to keep our business in the neighborhood knowing how bad the construction is due to the light rail people try their hardest to avoid it at all cost. When we went in it was dead like usual. I noticed that the two guys working there were new and Tony wasn't there. I asked the gentleman behind the counter what \"specials\" they had, cause usually it's posted on the wall. He rudely said in a heavy accent \"that special over there is the only one I have\"; which was a lg. Cheese pizza with 20 wings for $19.99. We ordered even though I was disappointed that their weren't more to choose from. 

As I made my order, the guy still being rude as hell, I told him that I wanted to split the favor of the wings to 10 hot and 10 BBQ. Not only did he try to charge me a \"carry out\" fee of $2 but then he tried to charge me a additional $1 fee for SPLITTING up the wing flavor. I informed him that we've been eating there for a long time and I've never been charged those addl fees. He shrugged his shoulders and said with a cocky attitude \"well that's how the owner wants it\". So I told him \"well I'm not paying those fees, that's seriously ridiculous\"! He then waived at me and told me \"BYE\". 

I could of swore the name of the restaurant game was to keep your loyal customers so they at least keep coming back. Even if it means not charging those ridiculous fees. 

I guess having a happy customer and customer retention is a thing of the past at Tony Pizza. Kinda sad cause he once again lost ANOTHER customer."}
{"text":"We were in the mood for a Chicago style deep dish, and Uncle Tony's is nearby. We ordered the Sicilian XL Uncle Tony's special for only 20 bucks. The pizza was fantastic and fed 4 hungry adults with leftovers! A tasty bargain!"}
{"text":"I gave Uncle Tony's 3 stars instead of 2 because their boneless wings Mild- was exactly my favorite taste! I loved them. Not to hot.Good taste.
 But they WATER down their ranch and Bleu Cheese. Why???? Why would you do that? There was a little foam on the top  and it was so thin. That is just gross. I understand you have to make Money- so please charge more for side dressing. And STOP watering down your ranch.
We ordered two pizzas. They were just ok. Nothing bad to say about the taste. But nothing memorable either. My husband really liked the ground sausage."}
{"text":"There's a few pizza snobs on these reviews. Pizza snobs. Jeez. 

Maybe y'all would be better suited to spend your cash at a papa johns or pizza hut.

Uncle Tony's is sketchy, yes. Shattered windows and dark parking lot. 

The workers are a rough around the edges, yes.

The interior leaves a lot to be desired. A LOT. 

Now I don't know about you all, but I will set all of that aside for a good neighborhood pizza. Uncle Tony's is a good neighborhood pizza. 

Ordered: Large Pizza and Wings-I think it was 20 bucks. Added Pepperoni. That and two drinks I think the total was $26, maybe $28. That's a heck of a deal. 

Wings came out quick-and were delivered to the table. Crunchy wings are my favorite, and these were good wings. 20 wings was what the deal said, I think I counted 24. Score!

Pizza came out in good timing, about 3/4 of the way through the wings. Greasy, big pizza. Good and suitable, if not exciting. Sometimes you just want a greasy pizza. 
--
If you are looking for a consistent run-of-the-mill pizza, call up one of the chain places. 

If you are looking for something all fancy and nice, go visit The Parlor. 

If you just want a damn pizza, go to Uncle Tony's."}
{"text":"Solid local independent pizza place. They are generally friendly but a little abrupt at times. I've eaten there plenty of times and I've always been satisfied with the product. The prices are fair for the quality of the ingredients. I've never been disappointed except when Tony wasn't cooking the pizza recently."}
{"text":"Uncle Tony's offers fast delivery and typically above average food. There's not much more I could ask for from a pizza joint.

I've had their Regular Pizza, Garlic Parm Wings, and Fries - all above par. I think the Italian hoagie left a little more to be desired but it was still average."}
{"text":"Came here on my lunch break with a co-worker. Since we only have a limited amount of time for lunch, we called ahead and put in our order for a certain time. When we got there, our food was ready and waiting. 

We got the 20 piece mild wings which cost $14. We asked for the wings to be extra crispy on the outside, which they didn't disappoint. The outside was nice and crispy but the insides were moist. The wing sauce was good. Not a ton of meat, but decent for the price. I'd say comparative to Buffalo Wild Wings. 

We got there at opening, so we were the only ones. The place was nice and clean and organized. Note: This place has an A- rating from the Health Department. Restroom are small and look like they've not been cleaned in a month!! At least the men's is that way. 

Will definitely come back again and try out other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Had an opportunity to have pizza with my son here very good little pizza joint seems like it's quaint owner operated can use a little cleanup but food is food in the food was good. Enjoy and support the local guy"}
{"text":"I straight-up blame Uncle Tony that I have gained 10 pounds since they opened. Living across the street has made this an easy choice for several months. Whenever I think what else is around for dinner or just a lunch special I always come back to Uncle Tony because it's a good deal with good people.
Admittedly I have never eaten at the restaurant. I've always done take out. I would rather have good food than a super decked out restaurant. It does look like a good place for a kid's birthday party. I'm just not taking the date there.
Excellent pizza. That's all I care about"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with this location.  I love hole in the wall type joints and this one does not disappoint.  Great pizza by the slice and they let you have the remote to change the tv.  Don't let the currently light rail construction stop you from trying this place out..."}
{"text":"The Pizza is the real deal -best New York Pizza I have had in Phoenix,and yes, I am from New York. Eggplant Parm was just okay, and the pasta was overcooked; hence my four star (not five) rating. This will be my go-to Pizza place during future visits to Phoenix."}
{"text":"Eh, I miss Meatball's, the pizza joint that previously held this spot. 

We opted for delivery from Uncle Tony's last night and made one mistake; we ordered fish sandwiches from a pizza parlor. Never do that.

I know, I hate making generalizations, but these were just nondescript, mushy, and  tasteless, just like pretty much every fish sandwich from a pizza restaurant. Dad wanted his fish, though, so... 

The wings were overcooked and overseasoned.

The pizza? Call it the bastard child of Mineo's and Fiori's. Look up my reviews for those pies before you get excited. I'll wait...

Ready? Do you see what I'm getting at?

Hey, the crust and sauce were both solidly appetizing, but that cheese, which covers the toppings (something novel that I welcome, actually) just slid off the pie and had that tough texture no melted cheese should ever have. Nonetheless, the pizza was the highlight, and that's unfortunate. 

Why did Meatball's disappear? I want them back. There needs to be a petition circulating about this. 

Cagney and Lacey.

Arrested Development.

Meatball's?"}
{"text":"Still not meatball's.  Service is friendly and did not take very long to get our meal.

The pizza is OK.  The crust was a little thicker than last time.  Just a reminder, the cheese is cooked on top of the toppings.

Had the chicken wings and they are OK."}
{"text":"This place was great! We had the pizza and wings and it was all delicious! I love the New York feel and taste, I would definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"I love this place. It is such great pizza. However- Yelp says they deliver, and they in fact do not. 

You should definitely stop by though!"}
{"text":"We recently moved back to the area, figured we'd give a new place to us a try.  Lived in this area as a kid, I believe this location used to be home of a Streets of New York. Just did pick up - pizza and wings.  We went with the cheese and the hot BBQ wings.  The food was okay - didn't find anything different or excellent with the pizza, maybe I need to try something besides cheese.  The wings were a bit soggy and drenched in sauce which  had a strange smell - almost smelled like cigarettes.  Maybe it is the type of hot sauce or BBQ sauce they use, but I was not a fan of the sauce.  The restaurant seemed a bit greasy and very quiet for a weekend night.  May try again, but for sitting at 4 stars I was expecting a lot more."}
{"text":"Love this place! My BF is a NYC native and will not eat any pizza that isn't New York style. I always preferred Chicago style...until now! From the moment you walk in, you know that the food will be delicious. The restaurant smells awesome, and you can see the dough being made in the back. Plus, the pies look gorgeous. The slices we ordered the first time were so delicious that we went back a second time just a few days later. According to my BF, the ratio of cheese to sauce to crust is perfect and is \"exactly what I'd expect to find in The City\". The texture of the crust is also phenomenal: slightly soft, slightly crispy, and perfectly flavored. Who needs toppings? I also need to give a shoutout to the lovely soft-spoken Albanian gentleman at the front. I didn't catch his name, but he helped us both times and is so hospitable and kind. You will NOT regret coming here for a slice or three!"}
{"text":"I was staying in the new Marriott in Mt. Lebanon and was jonesing for a pizza. Google said Uncle Tony's was closed but I was desperate so I tried calling anyway- I am glad I did! The person I talked to was super friendly and my pizza was delivered surprisingly quick by an equally friendly delivery man. The pizza was very good: a little sweeter of a sauce and fresh cheese. Don't trust the hours on Google- they are out of date!"}
{"text":"The closest I have found in PHX to a real NYC pie.  If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know."}
{"text":"This NY'er is giving this place a solid 4 stars. 

Yes the place looks a little sketchy from the outside but the service and food are great. 

Ordered a simple large cheese - huge for $12. Right amount of cheese, sauce and some good grease on it. Yes i love some greasy pizza so if you counting your carbs and calories, mayyyyyyy not be the spot for u."}
{"text":"It's the best NY-style pizza outside of Brooklyn.  Susan and I had a crisp, thin-crust pie with sausage & mushrooms.  Mmmm.  Washed down with ice-cold draft bear.  Double-mmmm.  And they need all the help they can get during construction of the light rail extension along 19th Avenue at Northern Avenue.  This place is just one reason that we love our neighborhood --hell, we've lived in the same house for 34 years.  The light rail stop on the corner will only make it better.  (Check out the picture of the pizza.)"}
{"text":"I love uncle Tony's pizza best place to eat a simple pizza thank you. Believe me I know pizza and this place knows how to make simple food taste so good."}
{"text":"This place is surprisingly good. It definitely doesn't looks like it from the outside or in, but the pizza was some of the best that I've had in Phoenix. Unfortunately, I had to ding them in a star, due to their wings."}
{"text":"I really can't give a good review. I am lenient to a degree, but when I get served a sandwich roll lightly half-smeared with garlic that's served as \"garlic bread\" I have to be fair and honest. The service was slow, and my party was the only table with patrons. The pizza was decent but nothing to write home about. It was way too hot inside the restaurant. The chairs were wobbly and extremely dirty, like they have never cleaned their furniture. The staff seemed confused by every question and was seen in the back playing on their phones! Very disappointed. We will NOT be returning."}
{"text":"J and I stopped here for a quick bite to eat while our car was being serviced across the street. The place is pretty small, with three tables in total and a cooler half filled with soda. The owner came out to greet us pretty quickly and took our order. I ordered a half of a meatball sub (7') with a can of Sprite and J ordered a half of a steak hoagie (7') w/o veggies and a can of Coke. Everything came to around $14. Our sandwiches came out within 15 minutes or less. and we're delivered by the owner. We were pleasantly surprised with how tasty the sandwiches were. The bread was crispy and had the right amount of meat, cheese, and sauce. The sizes were large and filling and he service was great. All in all, J and I will definitely return if we are in the area."}
{"text":"Just had Uncle Tony's for the first time & we love it!! 
Fantastic pizza! The sauce is delicious-great Italian flavor. 
The crust is the great combination of a little chewy 
yet crisp.  The veggies are fresh. Super friendly guys too. 
So happy to have a great new restaurant in our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"I don't know how long this place has been here. I have been passing that intersection for over 40 years and don't know when they appeared. We were wanting pizza or better our grandson wanted pizza do we picked the first one we passed and this was the place. I/We will be back.
My wife waned a thin crust pizza and I got the wings. The wings were good but it is hard to rate a place on wings. I have eaten then at many places and all are pretty much the same. It is hard to mess up wings. 
The pizza was excellent at least that is what my wife said and our grandson seemed to also enjoy. 
This is not what really made the trip or dining experience great. It was the people. The man that waited or took our order was extremely nice and helpful. Better service is not to be had anywhere. At the end or the meal he brought out a bag of chips for our grandson for the trip home. 
This is a local owned restaurant and this is the places I like to eat. The person that served us is a nice man and we will be back when in the area."}
