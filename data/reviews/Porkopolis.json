{"text":"I have been hearing about this place on the radio for years but I live in the far west valley so it's a drive. Finally got there and couldn't get enough of the sweet BBQ sauce. Amazing on everything I had. The fried pickles were a bit too salty for my taste but the appetizer quesadilla was amazing! I could have had that for an entree. The green chili burrito was PACKED with meat and a definite get again. The combo meat sandwich was also an excellent base for more of that sweet BBQ sauce. I would go again with no hesitation, if ever on that side of town."}
{"text":"After years of hype on the radio, the Brady sauce was ehh. 630pm and they were out of brisket, ehh. Too much hype, too much a money grab by shameless Brady."}
{"text":"Very good happy hour. Appetizers are half off and are a good value at full price, so half off is great. Staff was very upbeat and attentive. A overall good experience."}
{"text":"This is the fourth time I've gone to Porkopolis and while the previous encounters were great, this last visit was a bit of a disappointment. The corn chowder soup which usually is one of the highlights was lacking in flavor and rather skimpy. The pulled pork was very dry and bland and the chicken wings, while flavorful, were very dry and over-cooked. I'll give them one more shot to redeem themselves."}
{"text":"Dined  on sat afternoon. The three meat platter was amazing. Lots of flavor and the sauce was like candy. The beans for side were cooked perfectly and the flavor great. Had a burger as well it was great as well. It was a long drive but worth the trip"}
{"text":"Fantastic food with a southern twist.  The red neck tacos were superb, and are pulled pork, jalapeno cole slaw, and bbq sauce on a corn cake.  This is a meal in itself and surprisingly well balanced.  The mashed potatoes aren't thin as Brianna mentioned.  They are WHIPPED potatoes - a classic not usually found in restaurants these days.  I found them to be light and creamy.

I had the salmon and the pork loin.  Both came out at the perfect temperature which was particularly important with the pork loin being such a lean cut.

Paletas Betty on the menu was a really pleasant surprise, and we took a fresh orange creamsicle on the way out."}
{"text":"Took a chance and stopped in for an early dinner and was not disappointed. I ordered the Brisket Salad which could have fed 2 people . The greens were fresh & the Brisket was very tender.  The staff was very attentive even when this was a slow time . I will definitely come back !"}
{"text":"This place is really good. I had never heard of it but I was driving in the area and saw the sign for it and was intrigued by the name. It's got a nice open layout with multiple TV's. All the employees were super friendly and helpful. Their pulled pork was exceptional, the ribs were fall off the bone and delicious and their sweet and smokey BBQ sauce was amazing- I could eat that all by itself. I also tried their Mac and cheese and corn bread. The Mac was super cheesy and had jalapeños in it- very good. And the corn break was really good too- nothing super fancy or different but it sure was tasty. Overall, I had a really good experience at Porkopolis!"}
{"text":"Porkopolis bans law abiding gun owners from discreetly carrying in their restaurant, ensuring that the only people carrying, are non law abiding folk.... Famous Dave's and Joe's in Gilbert do not ban law abiding gun owners from carrying responsibly."}
{"text":"i only ate because of all the ads from the Holmberg show and some good promotion from friends.  I had the Baby Back platter.  After a 21 minute wait our waitress finally showed up to greet and take our drink order.  Drinks came 4 min later for 2 people ( about normal).  Ribs were cold, sent back.  18 min later I got new ribs that were hot.  Nothing to write home about.   Meat was tender (congrats! you're no waffle house) but the sauce was terribly bland.   I had the mashed potatoes which were of the dry canned and mix variety. 

Too commercial, not enough flavor and canned ingredients.  

Very sad day for the Q.

Maybe their chef needs a quick kick in the rear? Maybe a bad night.  I dont know.  I heard great things.  Huge let down."}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the best BBQ joints I have ever been to and I am pescatarian! My boyfriend and I ate there a couple of weeks ago and it was amazing! Our server (can not remember his name, but it was not him, it's me, I am bad at names) was great! Checked on us appropriately, not like those annoying servers who do not give you an opportunity to even eat, refilled our drinks and even helped me decide what to have for dessert when I couldn't decide. Cupcakes! Always a good choice! We started off with the deep fried pickles; great texture and the dipping sauce had the right amount of spice! I ordered the Blackened Catfish topped with Mango salsa. DELISH! On the side were green beans (fresh, not the frozen then thawed kind) cooked to perfection with the right amount of crisp to cooked ratio and square of corn bread. Did I mention the BIGGEST square of corn bread ever?? So pleased with the taste, it was like cake!!! My boyfriend ate ribs and although I do not eat meat, I know a good rib when I see one...the moment you pick it up it falls off the bone..yum! I also ordered a drink called Hoochie Mama which had moon shine and Ginger Ale, so good. I will definitely being going back and will be bringing some more peeps along!!"}
{"text":"We were hogs and hops regulars and we love bootleggers on Shea. We were excited to try Porkopolis because we live close by. 
We got the ribs, brisket, and meatloaf for takeout. Brisket was good (dry but good with sauce). meatloaf meal was excellent. Ribs were inedible because of WAY over salting. I threw them away.  If they can fix the ribs then I would give a better rating. 
Mac and cheese was great. It had fresh cheese on it and just enough green peppers in it that I could enjoy the spiciness and my kids could pick them out."}
{"text":"We ate there for the first time last week on the recommendation from a friend. It was happy hour which has some decent prices on beer, mixed drinks, and appetizers (there weren't any special prices for wine). 

However, I was disappointed with the beer selection, both for happy hour and the beer not on happy hour prices. There was no amber-style beer on the menu. I had to settle for a pale ale. Also, there weren't any local beer/Arizona beer selections such as San Tan (located a couple miles north) or Four Peaks. I was disappointed that a local restaurant is not supporting local breweries. They do, however, offer a dessert popsicle from a Chandler company. We didn't have dessert so I don't know if the popsicle is any good.

I've seen the mixed reviews about this restaurant's food so maybe it depends on who is in the kitchen that day. We had a good food experience and the service was adequate until the end when she was chatting at the bar and ignored us. I had the pulled pork sandwich (not dry), my boyfriend had the brisket (not dry or fatty), and our friends had the quesadilla which they loved. We also had fried pickles for an appetizer (happy hour price) and they were very tasty with the BBQ aioli. 

Three things would make me change my three stars to four stars:
1. put local amber beer on the menu
2. place TVs so everyone in the bar can see the game (my back was to the screen)
3. fill up my water glass when it's empty; I was glad I left water in the car because once we paid our bill the server never made contact and I was parched

I will be back next month in December with my girlfriends. I hope they improve the beer list!"}
{"text":"I went to Porkopalis for the first and last time Friday for lunch. Your food is terrible!!! Worst Bbq I have ever had. Brisket tasted like dried out Pot Roast and the Dirty Bird Turkey,The toast was aweful and tasted like your grill needs to be cleaned. The only thing that was good were the Fried Pickles and the drinks. You are better staying on the radio and selling Porkopalis to someone who knows Bbq and Bbq sauce. Farewell Porkopalis. Famous Dave's and Bobby Q is 100x's better then what you call Bbq."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and it was pretty dam good. I'm not a fan of meatloaf a all but the one the serve here is very good! It has jalapeños in them and it's delicious healthy portion. We also had the spicy pickles and they were delicious! The sauce they come with is a very good pairing. We also had the peach moonshine and mojito moonshine and they were also very good. I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. We tried the turkey, brisket and pulled pork. Also recommend the pulled pork nachos and fried pork rinds for an appetizer. We somehow left room for dessert and tried the ice cream sandwich. A layer of ice cream between two brownies. Sinful. Will be back for brunch."}
{"text":"Not a place to bring children. 
I have been to porkopolis a lot with my husband. It is our number one choice when we can afford a night out.   I was so excited to celebrate  mothers  day here with my family who was mostly from out of town. What a bad idea!
I had brought my daughter here 2 years ago for Father's Day when she was 5 and thought it was just a fluke.  Nope!  They do not like children  
During this trip my 1 year old son was getting restless and I ordered him some cornbread so he would calm down and not bother the other guests. I was a server I know how bad that can be. I ordered this first thing and asked for it as soon as possible. 
We asked nicely twice over a twenty minute period if the cornbread was coming. Our food came first. By this time baby was.mad and I spent most of the time outside. When we asked for water for the baby that was another 20 minutes. 
This place is just not for kids. 
Food is good but they are missing out on families."}
{"text":"Delicious food. I had the pork sandwich and we split the BBQ quesadilla - they were both really good. I was surprised that it was a sit-down restaurant and not the typical 'order at the counter' BBQ place so that was kind of cool. The apple pie moonshine is pretty tasty and goes well with the BBQ. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Me and my wife went with our friends who had already been once before. I was impressed with the pulled pork and brisket but the sides were sub-par. The dirty rice was odd flavored and the mac&cheese was  bland and mushy. I would eat there again but not very often."}
{"text":"I am a guy that doesn't leave reviews, I just use the reviews to make more informed decisions. My meal that I just had at Porkopolis was worth my time to share my experience. I ordered the combo meat (brisket/pulled pork) sandwich with coleslaw on it and felt that it was absolutely delicious. I don't consider myself a barbecue expert, but I do enjoy great barbecue and have tried many places in the metro Phoenix area that  I felt MEH about. The brisket was thick cut, (how I like it), not fatty at all and as one review did note, the beans were watery, but tasted really nice. Next time I am near 202 and AZ Avenue, I will be back. As a side note, I ordered to go, and the man who served me asked if I wanted a coke or water while I waited, which I took him up on the soda, then he provided a to go cup at no charge. Classy touch that made a great impression on me."}
{"text":"Highly recommend trying the Apple Pie Moonshine!! So good! BBQ sauce was delish. My boyfriend loved the spicy version, even bought a bottle. :)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome,  70 mile round trip from my house,  looking forward to going back this week. The Brady Burger rocks. We also had the fried pickles and the brisket, pulled pork sandwich, took home both kinds of Brady BBQ sauce.  Met the legend Brady Bogan himself there, very cool and down to earth. My son Riley and I are going back in a couple of days, the only trouble we are having is to figure out what we are going to have next time around. I just wish it wasn't so far so I could enjoy one or a few of the many drinks offered there.  The atmosphere was nice, not to brightly lit so you can relax. Rock on!"}
{"text":"Only been here once so far, but the French Dip brisket is fantastic!! I've never had French Dip served with full slices of brisket before. At first I thought it would be a tough bite, but it was tender & delicious. Highly recommend. Brady's BBQ sauces on the table are also great on their own."}
{"text":"Nice addition to the neighborhood. Cute little eatery with completely yummy BBQ. They have a number of meats and sauces to choose from. the ribs were fantastic, meat just falls off the bone. Nice outdoor area for the thankfully cooler nights we now have. Plus the patio is dog friendly!! There is nice bar area inside. if looking for some good BBQ, go check it out!"}
{"text":"What a cool place, great vibe, friendly staff, and good food, nice bar. What else would I want?"}
{"text":"For lunch we had the burnt tips and the quesadilla. Both were very good, liked both sauces that were on the table. Service was good even though fairly busy for lunch. Just opened a few days ago. Good TV's for sports viewing. Hope they do the Sunday Brunch."}
{"text":"I grew up in the South so my standard on BBQ is pretty high.  Porkopolis blew me away.  Great service, great food!  I got the ribs and briskets.  The ribs meat was just falling off the ribs.  I never had to touch it with my hand.  Tender, juicy, tantalizing."}
{"text":"This review is from December 4th Sunday night. Second time diner. I decided to get some Bbq for dinner. I enjoyed the ribs last time I was here. I was greeted right away and decided to go to bar. I wanted to checkout all the beers and moonshines they offered. I sat at the bar deciding what to order asking alot of questions, the bartender was offering samples. Great sales person. While reading menu, a couple at bar was really happy with their brisket they just finished. They actually bragged about how good it was. They asked the bartender if they did catering to go for 60 ppl on Xmas Eve. The bartender was super friendly and  informative. A very good bartender who did his job well. He controlled his area. Hearing how much they liked their brisket, and I love a good brisket,  I decided to order a 4 meat platter, half ribs and half brisket. I went to pickup my wife a few miles down the road. We ate dinner in the car. Ribs were spot on just the way we like them. The talked up brisket on the other hand was tough and chewey. You could tell by the color that it was old and dried out. We were very bummed out. I called right away and talked to Matt Hamilton the manager. I told him my problem and he asked what I would like to do. All we wanted was to substitute the brisket for some more ribs, thats it. He apologized and said he would investigate brisket and would take care of us. When I went back with brisket, Matt saw me coming and got my order. He apologized again and said he wanted to make it right and wanted to have us try the brisket with some more ribs and a gift certificate. I explained that all I wanted was the replacement ribs. He said he wanted us to try the brisket and get us to come back. What a great gesture. Matt is a awesome Manager. He went above and beyond of taking care of the Customer. Brady, please personally thank Matt for a job well done. Being in the Management part of Restaurants and Food Service, Managers don't get enough praise, they only hear the negatives. Not enough praises you will lose good people. 
By the way , the new brisket was very good. Awesome. We will be back. 2 thumbs up from me."}
{"text":"3.5 out of 5 stars, really.

My wife is an avid KUPD listener & so we had to give this place a try after learning about it from Brady on the show.

The location/atmosphere are very nice - modern & comfortable.

The service when we went was perfectly adequate.  The server was friendly & kept our drinks topped off fairly well.

As for the food, we were disappointed in some items & pleasantly surprised at others.  We tried...

Beef Brisket - pretty dry & probably the weakest of the meats.
Ribs - over cooked & a bit mushy, but the flavor was ok.
Pulled Pork - the best of the meats, it was fairly tender & flavorful.
Chicken - not bad, very smoky (in a good way) & tender/juicy enough.
Burnt Ends - flavor explosion, though quite a bit of fat & maybe not worth the $.

Cole Slaw - the wife LOVED it & the slight jalapeno kick.
Mac & Cheese - quite possibly the best I've ever had at a restaurant.
Cornbread - good flavor & texture, though curiously served cold.

It's funny, judging the meat alone would give this place a 2.5 star rating.  Judging the sides alone would give them a 4.5 star rating.  Strange, considering the supposed focus on the meat.

I'd like to take a minute & talk just about that Mac & Cheese.  It is seriously good.  There is a slight jalapeno kick, smooth sharp cheese sauce, al dente noodles, & it's topped with crispy bread crumbs & more cheese all in a pretty large ramekin before being individually baked.  I would HAPPILY pay $15.00 for an entree sized portion topped with some of that pulled pork!!!  (hint hint, Mr. Bogen)

Overall, a pretty good dining experience.  We'd definitely try it again if we were in the neighborhood, though it's not the epic BBQ experience we were hoping for."}
{"text":"If you find yourself in the area, stop off here. Very  nice spot with good bbq and friendly staff."}
{"text":"We tried this restaurant last Friday night for the first time with an order to go.  We got the 4 meat plate with double brisket, pulled pork and ribs with beans and coleslaw to share between the two of us. We also got an order of the fried pickles. The brisket was excellent--glad we got double. The sides were disappointing in that the jalapeño coleslaw had no jalapeño flavor and was really bland and watery. The beans were pretty soupy, and not much beans in the little container. I must say we were surprised how small the portion sizes were for the sides.  The pork, the ribs and especially the pickles were so salty it ruined the meal.  We had such high hopes for this spot but we won't be back because of the salt.  The staff were great -- friendly, efficient, professional and helpful. We looked around while we were waiting for the order and thought the place looked great. Too bad about the salt though. I see now other reviews mention it too, but we never checked Yelp before we came in."}
{"text":"i have been wanting to go to Porkopolis for a long time, finally went. i attempted the Brady's BBQ Bacon Burger Challenge. i of course failed miserably. but let me tell you, most food challenge and \"big portion\" restaurants focus on quantity over quality. at Porkopolis you definitely get both. everything there is so good from the meat all the way down to the vegetables and french fries and especially Brady's BBQ Sauce. everything is top notch, the staff is very friendly and welcoming while being professionals at what they do, the bathrooms are clean and very inviting, everything about this restaurant is perfect. if i could ever choose my last meal, it would definitely be Porkopolis. if you ever have any concerns the amazing staff will make sure you have a great experience. i was a total stranger to everyone there, but i felt like i had been best friends with everyone for years, even \"local\" celeb/owner of Porkopolis Brady Bogen when he stopped in and wished me luck on the burger challenge. Porkopolis will be one of the best dining experiences every time you go, i am sure of it. my taste buds are still tingling and party a day later. in fact......... I'm going to go eat some more Porkopolis right now."}
{"text":"Great BBQ to stuff your facehole. You will get meat sweats. Prices are very reasonable for quality of meats. Baby back ribs are a must have when you visit. Cocktails are a grip so get boozed at home."}
{"text":"I have to be 100% honest. I have eaten a lot of places in my life time and have watched thousands of football games at the bar, but this bartender(Kara) was by far the rudest, loudmouth, obnoxious bartender I have ever come across. It was so bad I had to leave right in the middle of my lunch. When I paid my tab with cash this bar tender instead of handing me my change she dropped it on my plate of half eaten food. The funny part is is that the owner and day time manager(Matt) were right there when she continued to act like a 3 year old when it came time to putting on the football game in which my friend and I had requested. I had to tell her 5 times what game it was and than after that she asked what channel it was on when she was holding the remote and it was right in front of her. She proceeded to yell in front of the entire restaurant WHAT CHANNEL IS YOUR GAME ON THIS ISNT COOL!!!! I couldn't believe what I was hearing. It was almost like she was on drugs or just plain stupid. The food is only average so putting that with a BITCHY bartender is enough for my friend and I to NEVER go back to this establishment. I am still in disbelief that her owner and managers(Matt) would let her act like this and not even try to defuse the situation... Do yourself a favor and don't waste ONE hour of your life going here if your going to sit at the bar as you will totally resent it and say I told you so!! On a positive note We were there to say goodbye to Jordan who's shift started at 3:00pm for his final shift as he is moving on to a bigger and better career . Sadly enough I didn't get that chance to say good bye to there best employee but now realize why he is leaving after 2 years with this company. Jordan you were the best and good luck to you... Management I will never ever say a good thing about your restaurant!!! Your employees can make or break you, and this bartender is going to break you and I can't wait to see it. Good riddance..."}
{"text":"Came here for restaurant week. Three courses for a couple cost $40. Deal. The food was delicious. Particularly enjoyed burnt ends and the waffle ice cream cinnamon dessert. The service was great."}
{"text":"Delicious! Had the Redneck Tacos! They are one of the best BBQ dishes I've ever had. Our server Kelli was great!"}
{"text":"Service was a bit slow but the breakfast way more then made up for it.  Dinner was okay. I'm sure I'll be back for football season."}
{"text":"Great lunch. Service was excellent.  Brisket salad was wonderful. Food could have been served hotter."}
{"text":"This is an excellent place for BBQ. The French Dip is fantastic. Their house sauces are some of the best I have tasted. The place is always very busy."}
{"text":"Really good BBQ! Try the burnt ends, they are delicious! The combo pulled pork and brisket sandwich was also great with the perfect ratio of meat to bread!"}
{"text":"Stopped into this joint on NYE to grab a bite. It was dead (to be expected). Service was great! We ordered the fried pickles to start. Quite a large portion size but left the bottom of the basket covered in grease. We each ordered a lunch platter of 2 meats with a side. Was slightly disappointed in the price of the meal compared with the portion size. The sides were tiny (2-3 bites). The pulled pork, brisket and ribs were DELICIOUS. Tender, juicy, flavorful and cooked to perfection. The two sauces they have we're fantastic as well (sweet & smokey and hot &sweet). Overall, Porkopolis is a great contender, but doesn't win out over Rudy's BBQ in my book."}
{"text":"Poor Service, overpriced plain cold/reheated food. 

Went there around 12:30 on Saturday, not long after they had opened for the day. The restaurant was not busy at all, maybe three other occupied tables in the restaurant area.

We were initially 'greeted' by a server who did not smile, welcome us, or even so much as a friendly gesture. We were sat near the window, which was full of grease and handprints - this window had been skipped over while the other windows were clean. Again we were there shortly after they had opened. It was a two top and the two top next to it was dirty. So not very likely that a family had eaten in that area this morning. 

When we were seated, we were not greeted by our server for 5 minutes, let alone had our drink orders taken. She was slow to greet us but overall more welcoming than the other lady. Again, there were three other tables. There is no reason why it should take them that long to greet us when we can see them standing on the line twiddling their thumbs.

The food came out fast, almost too fast. My food was ok relatively bland. My girlfriends was obviously reheated - the center of her sandwich was still cold and the cheese had that texture to it when its been cooked and then reheated.

After we had finished the food, the sever only then asked how it was. Never stopped back by the table until then. I said it was ok, all she said was, \"oh\". As she cleared our plates.

We will never be coming back here."}
{"text":"1st visit, ambiance is nice and tables give everybody enough leg room to stretch and loosen the belts.

Ordered a Brady bacon  burger on brioche bun with a side o fries...and ranch of course.

We split the burger and fries due to the portion size and appetite we had. The burger came with thick cut bacon, a heaping of BBQ pulled pork and jalapeño slaw....unbelievable...

So, we tore up the burger and fries...still a little curious and ordered a side of burnt ends. The 1st basket of burnt ends were 99% fat...not good... (see pic - Exhibit 1). Told the waiter that they were full of fat and I was not impressed. She immediately offered to replace them with no challenge(see pic - Exhibit 2) So, we received a new order and nibbled on a few and was pleased.

Final conclusion: Burger was $15...well worth it, 1st round of burnt ends $11...I would rather eat   bull anus than eat another basket of burn end fat...the total tab came to $35 (tip included).. I would give the place another try....you decide."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!! I am not necessarily a bbq know it all but this is awesome. The brisket and ribs melted in my mouth. Our server Davis was great and made the visit even better. Great job guys!!!"}
{"text":"One of best restaurants I've been to. My husband got the brisket, so tender and yummy. We shared the Porkopolis quesidilla that was on spot. The sauce the put on top was so yummy.  And our server Dan was awesome. I'm already planning our next visit."}
{"text":"Yummy stuff! Was recommended to us by the guys at RideNow when we bought hubby's motorcycle.. Great food! Service was decent. Priced accordingly, too! Grandparents got the pork rinds and said they were divine. We got the redneck tacos.. Jalapeño coleslaw was super yummy but the corn cakes could use some tinkering. The pulled pork melted in our mouths! Also, the fried pickles were a treat...wish they had a southwest ranch for them, though. So many other things on the menu to try, we'll be back!!"}
{"text":"This review is based mostly on the food as I placed an order for pick up. Staff was friendly upon arrival. Food was done in the 20 min they stated. The Redneck Tacos are ingenious and taste amazing! The brisket was the best I've had in a long time. I will be back and highly recommend."}
{"text":"My husband and I have dined here twice now, once at the bar about a year ago and again in the main area with friends last Thursday. I have been truly pleased with both experiences. Good service, clean restaurant, and simple menu. The portions are generous and the meat is consistently great tasting and so tender!  They also have great weekday Happy Hour specials on appetizers and drinks that really will help you get even more bang for your buck. 
I highly recommend Porkopolis to anybody looking for some good BBQ and drinks."}
{"text":"Although i found the prices a bit high for just a normal night out, the quality of food was great and I thoroughly enjoyed my whole meal.  The smoked wings were unique and very tasty.

I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Awesome atmosphere, waiter was fantastic and patient with us while we drooled over the menu.

Started with the brisket quesadilla appetizer. So. So. Good. Amazing.

Ordered the meal, I had the brisket sandwich, boyfriend had the pulled pork sandwich. Both were fantastic.

Ordered the porch tea moonshine and it was very good. Ordered the apple pie moonshine, didn't like it as much.

Five out of five, very good all around."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to try this place for a long time and finally got around to it. I was pretty skeptical at first when I saw the menu, not that it was lacking, it just seemed     a little overpriced compared to other places. I ordered the BBQ nachos, and I'll tell you they did not disappoint. I had ordered a side of fried pickles, which were very good, since I did not know what the portion size would be. I could not finish these nachos, and that's with my wife grazing on it as well. I will definitely be back again, and look forward to trying other creations on their menu."}
{"text":"Yum-o! Great brisket! My husband and I just went for the first time and wil be back again!"}
{"text":"$75.00 for the absolute WORST barbecue I have ever eaten in my entire life. Didn't see or smell any wood in the entire place and definitely didn't taste any in the meat. Anyone who actually likes this place has clearly never had real barbecue. This place should not be allowed to call itself a barbecue joint. GARBAGE."}
{"text":"nothing special about this place. ordered their turkey salad. the turkey was just diced smoked turkey breast loaf. was pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"They have awesome food, or so I would guess. Learn how to let up on the seasoning! Seriously! The turkey was grossly over seasoned, the pulled pork was great when we had it on our tacos. But was DISGUSTINGLY salty on its own. 

I can tell they have great food but they also need to fire someone. No professional chef would ever go this crazy on the seasoning. Less is a LOT more in this case. The food reminded me of a backyard BBQ prepared by someone who had a little too much to drink.

Side note; your creamed corn could use some... corn."}
{"text":"Very good ribs, pulled pork and brisket but sides were sub par.  Good for takeout but skip the sides."}
{"text":"We have been to Porkopolis multiple times and each time we have been having decreased satisfaction in the food and service. This visit we walked in and there was only one gentleman at the bar. There was a serve and bartender working and it still took a few moments to be recognized. After we finally got seated it took almost ten minutes for the bartender to come back to the table to take our drink order. When we finally received our food, which took over 30 minutes in a completely dead restaurant,  the meat was dry and tasteless. The corn bread was good and the mac and cheese was fabulous. My father pointed out the restaurant has pork in the name but yet they serve very little pork. My husband got the pork and it was fatty and dry. By the end of the meal we didn't stay for extra drinks which we normally do because the moonshine here is awesome. The only reason this review isn't a 1 is because the mac and cheese and the moonshine saved them. I am extremely disappointed and will most likely not go back to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Went there for my second time yesterday.  Great food, great service. Had a blast chatting with the waiter about BBQ and such.

The meat comes out unsauced, which is a requirement for BBQ. Pre-sauced BBQ is the refuge of a cowardly pitmaster. I want to taste the rub, the smoke, and the meat, not your sauce and how much you think I want on the food! Thankfully, the meat is very good all by itself, though the hot and sweet sauce is good as a small dollop.

Whenever I go to a new BBQ place, I always try the chicken. If they make a good smoked chicken, then I know they aren't phoning the rest in. The chicken was moist, smoky, and flavorful. For this last trip I got the brisket. Nice tasty rub, not too salty, great smoke ring, moist and tasty.

My companion got the turkey. I tried some, and it was out of this world. Not at all dry, just enough smoke flavor. I think I'll be getting that next time, which is an odd thought to me. Going to a BBQ place for the turkey? Yeah, that's exactly what I'm going to do.

The sides are great, too. I've had the garlic mashed potatoes and the jalapeno slaw, both of which I'll get again. My companion said she could eat just the jalapeno mac and cheese and be happy.

We also tried the fried pickles and I could have eaten an entire plate of them. 

I think we're going to try the brunch next weekend. The Redneck Benedict sounds intriguing.

It's a little pricey, but both times we've had leftovers, so when you consider that you're getting basically two meals the prices aren't bad at all."}
{"text":"Not good BBQ, plain and simple. How others have given this good reviews is beyond me. If you are looking to go here be prepared for beef brisket comprised of 60% fat, Mac n Cheese that has virtually no taste all (don't be fooled by the pictures), and creamed corn that tastes like milky water. Oh, and I forgot the worst part.....they only have two BBQ sauces both of which are SWEET sauces?!?!?! Note to the owners, at the very least get a good BBQ sauce. It will go a long way in making anything taste better. My fiancé who grew up on a farm just said \"I think I'm going to be a vegetarian\" after that meal. Enough said."}
{"text":"Surprised this place is only 3 and a half stars. I've gone in with my dad. We shared a pulled chicken salad and a half rack of ribs. They were both delicious. BBQ Sauce is really great. Service was really great as well. We even ordered dessert and got their ice cream sandwich which was amazing. Will definitely go back since it is so close to our neighborhood."}
{"text":"We absolutely LOVE Porkopolis!  As a family we love to smoke our own ribs, and have perfected a recipe.  We have never found a comparable rack of ribs until we tried this place!  We are thrilled to have found a place to eat amazing bbq.  Since trying it out a few months ago, we have been back several times.  We love everything tried from the ribs, pulled pork, turkey, briskey, wings, mac n cheese,  cornbread, the Brady bacon burger.....amazing!   The service eating in is perfect, and take out is super efficient!  My little guy asks for ribs from Porkopolis weekly, and my little girl begs for the Mac n cheese.  Perfect place to satisfy the bbq craving when it's TOO hot to do it yourself!"}
{"text":"I was in the neighborhood, so I decided to stop by and check this place out.  After all it's been here a while.  Well let me say I was glad I did!  I had the lunch special two meats.  I ordered the ribs and brisket with a side of the jalapeño cole slaw.  Ribs had great smoke and there sauce is sweet and savory tad of heat.  The brisket was fork tender also had great smoke and nice bark.  Service was also great!  I'll return in the near future, this time I'm ordering a whole rack of ribs!"}
{"text":"First day here in Chandler, and after a long day of moving activities, we ate at Porkopolis. The server was very attentive and accommodating. The brisket nachos were absolutely fantastic as was my Brisket sandwich. We had the ice cream sandwich for dessert, and it was yummy. If every restaurant is this good, I'm going to love living here!"}
{"text":"My daughter and grandsons and I went here during restaurant week.  The boys are 7.  We had the burnt ends appetizer (which was the reason that I wanted to go here in the first place).  They did not disappoint.  I would have been happy to stop here.  We each got a 3 meat platter with two sides.  All of the meat brisket, chicken, pork, turkey was excellent.  Both the sweet and spicy sauces were excellent.  We had cornbread--good but nothing to write home about, coleslaw which my daughter said was good, mac and cheese with green chili which was also good but not earthshattering.  The cheeseburger my grandson's split was excellent!  All of the meats, even the brisket was moist and smoky.  I have never had better smoked turkey anywhere.  The chicken was also excellent.  The best part was the customer service.  My daughter's boys are twins and 7 years old.  They pre split both their meal and dessert so we did not just get an extra plate and both looked the same so no fights.  For dessert we split the apple waffle!  It was absolute heaven.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Good just not as good as expected.  Fan of  owner's radio show, so  probably have high expectations from always hearing about this place. Brisket had good flavor,  ribs over cooked, pulled pork a bit briny. Pork rinds were also good.  Siracha sauce was good. Service was above average."}
{"text":"Casual atmosphere, friendly staff, OUTSTANDING food!!!!  We had (shared) the brisket, pulled pork, wings, and turkey! Loved everything and bought the sauce to take home! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Seriously nice waiter. The beans and slaw were good. The cuban sandwich had burnt cheese, no pickles or mustard and the bun was crumbling apart. Their slogan is the evolution of barbecue.......I sure hope not!!!! Won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch after my husband heard about this place on the radio. It was great. Quiet, low key, and the food came out fast. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to a takeout sandwich from here. I asked for a bbq chicken sandwich, not a solid breast but pulled pork style.  I picked up my order that I'd paid just under $15. for and what a big disappointment! Bits and peices of chicken on a bun, three pickle chips and a side of Oh so sweet bbq sauce. My mashed potatoes were just that but it's a Lot of money for four ounces of chicken and a bun. Don't think I can afford to eat here again. No wonder the place was empty!"}
{"text":"The food is still good, but the turkey was not spectacular on their 3 meat plate. I should have made another choice. Three stars is still good in my opinion and the service this time was very good. If I could do 3.5 stars I would."}
{"text":"An excellent barbecue place. Tried ribs (huge serving!), two meat platter with brisket & rib with garlic mashed potatoes and the goulash appetizer. All very tasty, tender and 'fork cuttable '. Ice tea is a little weak. Good service. Didn't do dessert."}
{"text":"We're still exploring the menu - so far I'd recommend the baby back ribs, chicken, creamed corn and the mac n cheese. (There are jalapeños in the creamed corn and mac n cheese which gives them a nice kick)"}
{"text":"My rating is going to be based solely on the Redneck Tacos, which is the only thing I've had here and I had it to go.  

Imagine mounds of delicious, smokey, tender pulled pork placed gently on top of a bed of flavorful and creamy (and not too spicy for those of you who care) jalapeno coleslaw.  Underneath it all are the most fluffy and delicious sweet corn pancakes I've ever tasted...ok, I've never tasted corn pancakes before, but these have ruined me for all others that I may try in the future.  Top it all with some of their delicious barbecue sauce and voila, magic happens! 

I was going to bring them home to eat them, but I made the mistake of opening the box while I was in my car, and next thing I know, I'm bare-handing them into my mouth in the front seat of my car like a ravenous squirrel.  Those tacos were so good, I don't know if I'll ever order anything else on the menu, but I know I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Paid $7 for a two second pour on a well gin and tonic, bar tender was nice but main focus was his cell phone. I don't eat dairy so my only sauce option was BBQ for pickle chips. No marinara or honey mustard or anything.."}
{"text":"This was my first experience  two nights ago.  The food was a mixed experience and I won't be back.  To be fair, as the server recommended, the brisket was their best offering and it was very good but the ribs were tasteless.  The portions were a fair value.  There were only two BBQ sauces and one was an Asian-oriented sauce unusual for this food and the other was at best like a slug of molasses.  

However, a dining experience is more than the food even if the setting is a casual environment.  The attitude toward the customer starts with the owner/manager and the staff essentially follow it.  My order came back wrong.  The server did correct the problem when I pointed it out.  At the end of the meal, the server inquired about my interest in desert.  Since it was my first experience there and my initial order came back wrong, I inquired if management would cover the cost of desert as a gesture of service courtesy.  The server went to the owner/manager who didn't both to come over and talk with me and said they would give me only half a desert but charge me half the price. This approach obviously won't win any loyalty from me nor likely from anyone else.  I spent over $33 on my meal alone, before gratuity, and didn't merit a visit from the owner/manager when the restaurant had only a few diners."}
{"text":"I would like to start off this review saying that I grew up in the BBQ capital of the world, Kansas City, and am use to eating and making world class BBQ. I LOVE Brady from his radio show and was hoping to see him there almost as much as I was excited to try this place that I hear so much about. I gathered up my kids and grandkids and off we went to Porkopolis for our first time there. I refuse to eat at chain BBQ places and am still looking for my go to BBQ place here in Arizona after 13+ years in the valley. My oldest daughter said that she hear that this place is just ok but I've heard and read different so I was going in with giving it 6 out of 5 stars. We got there around 11:30am on a Saturday and the place was almost empty. 

We ended up ordering a wide variety of food from the menu. This is probably my first review of any type of restaurant ever so I am not a master critic or reviewer but I am an expert on good BBQ. We ordered the Brady burger, a variety of meat, and tons of the sides that they offer. I feel that we had a good range of everything that this place has to offer. I love you Brady and this hurts to say it but this was by far the worst BBQ I have ever had in my entire life. My daughter barely ate the burger and fries and I had enough left over (which is rare) to feed a small nation. The ribs tasted like they were boiled and never grilled or smoked, the brisket was overdone and tough, and the chicken was so dry I could barely eat it. The mac & cheese had zero flavor and the coleslaw tasted like styrofoam. I did not detect an ounce of smoke flavor on anything and if wasn't for salt & pepper there would be no seasoning on any of the food. The smell in the place started to smell like our food and was making me nauseous. 

Hopefully I just caught this place on a bad day but from the sample size of everything we had I have to think that is just how the food is there and the standards for good BBQ in the valley are that low. I hope if someone from the business reads this they can use this review to improve on the food quality. Apparently enough people like it to open up a second location. Brady, PLEASE do not ever quit your day job because I love you on the radio (I live for the Brady report) but the second job has a long ways to go. I wish I could report on a better experience but I have to be totally honest. It would have been a wash if Brady came in and I could get a picture with him but that didn't happen therefor it could not save this disaster of a trip. In my best Brady voice \"keep trying little buddy\"."}
{"text":"Brisket that melts in your mouth, pulled pork that is juicy and perfectly shredded and cleaned, and a BBQ sauce that is wonderfully balanced in tartness vs sweetness.  Not too spicy or overpowering.  You can still taste the meats.  Porkopolis has it all.  Portions are large leaving plenty of leftovers. 

 I picked up food for Thursday night football and had a special circumstance where I couldn't leave my car upon arrival.  I'm not saying they could do this for everyone (pickup was mid afternoon) but I explained my dilemma before ordering and they cheerfully said that they could indeed run my food out to my car when I arrived.  They were walking to my car immediately after I turned off the ignition.  Since I paid with plastic, it was very easy to tip them extra for their efforts.  They NEVER made me feel like it was an imposition.  The customer service was exceptional.

The food was a huge hit with everyone.  It took only one bite from the Nachos and we were all hooked.  The most interesting combination of deliciousness I have had in months.  Homemade potato chips topped with cheese, smoked chicken, scallions, BBQ sauce, and sour cream.  It is outstanding and I will definitely order EVERY TIME I go to Porkopolis....which will be often.

Also...the burnt ends are one of those things you will crave at 2 am so get extra."}
{"text":"I got the lunch special 1/4 rack baby back ribs & brisket.  Hubby got the half rack of ribs.  Both meals were out quick & tasted amazing."}
{"text":"Love this BBQ place. We don't mind driving all the way there just to get our BBQ fix. The reasonably priced combo platters feed our family of 5 with enough leftovers to take home. Such a good deal! It's our go-to BBQ place."}
{"text":"For a BBQ/Pork shop the pork was dry and Nasty. You got no choice of what sauce they put on your ribs. The service was worse than the pork. At one point there were no employees where a customer could find them. My wife had to go get her own silverware. The only good thing I had here were the chicken wings. For a pork shop really. There are better choice near by."}
{"text":"Really solid. I am from the south and maybe too picky with BBQ. Arizona and California are tough to find good BBQ in my opinion. Until I ate here. I cannot believe how much love is put into the meats. The ribs are five star by any standard and the brisket and pulled pork are all day long tender juicy and smokey perfect.  Big fan."}
{"text":"I love pork and meats in general, and I actually thought I was going to have a difficult time choosing which meat to consume as we are in from out of town and the opportunity to eat here again may not come soon.  The Brady burger had bacon in the burger on the burger and pulled pork with slaw!!  Holy moly if that was not one of if not the best burgers I have ever had, included creations I make myself.  I highly recommend this place!  Service was great and price was not bad for great BBQ."}
{"text":"Family took me to an early Father's Day dinner and I was disappointed overall. The ribs were good but the brisket was fatty and full of gristle. The pulled pork was over cooked to the point of being mushy. The burnt ends were not even close to being burnt and were actually better than the brisket. The mac and cheese seemed to be from a box with some bread and chili put in at the end. We will not be back."}
{"text":"Actually very very good. The best BBQ I've had in AZ. Definitely a must try!! The redneck tacos are awesome!"}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for over 3 years and I finally felt compelled to write a review. The food and staff are outstanding. I've tried everything on the menu and it's all delicious. It is the best barbecue in Arizona. Make sure to try the brisket quesadilla, burnt ends and the smoked wings. Wash it down with a ice cold Deschutes freshly squeezed. Now I'm hungry gotta go."}
{"text":"The seating is very uncomfortable (one side booth in some areas the other side hard chairs). The service was good, but the food not so good.  The mash potatoes are too thick and lack the garlic taste they advertise. The cornbread is really horrible and shouldn't be called cornbread.  The salads are good, so if your going to go \"just order a salad and you'll be okay\".  Also, I think they are overpriced for the food taste they deliver.  It's more of a sports bar type place than a restaurant. And seriously after leaving this place last week, I had gas and stomach pains!"}
{"text":"We drove almost 40 miles (each way) to check out Porkopolis, and it was worth every mile there and back!

Our delightful server Megan suggested we try the Red Neck Tacos to start, claiming that we probably never had anything like them before.  She was absolutely right! The tacos are delicious soft corn pancakes topped with tender pulled pork, jalapeno slaw with sweet and smoky sauce. A fantastic combination, and would have been enough for my dinner alone, maybe with a side, but I had to share with my hubby, who also raved about this unique dish.

For his main course, hubby had the baby back ribs. They were finger-licking good! He claims to be a baby back aficionado, and when he finished his first rib with a Cheshire Cat grin, I knew I had to have a bite even though I have never been a fan of the baby backs myself . . . I am a convert, at least at Porkopolis! I ordered the Barbecue Salmon which came with polenta cakes and fresh veggies. I am always a little hesitant to order salmon out because even when I ask for it to be prepared on the rarer side, it never comes out right. I was even more hesitant here knowing that it had to be cooked and then recooked on the grill. Much to my satisfaction, out came a beautifully done hefty piece of salmon cooked to perfection. I opted to have it prepared with the sweet and smoky sauce instead of the hot and spicy, and it was yummy! The polenta cake had a hint of cheese, and was very creamy in texture, a great match for the salmon! The macaroni and cheese was equally creamy. Loved that it had a \"crust\" on top.

Both owners, Matt and Brady, came around to greet us and see how we were enjoying the meal. They engaged us in some great banter, commented on my picture-taking . . . \"Are you tweeting?\" \"No, Yelping!\" Then I told them they already had two 5-star reviews!  Unlike Brianna, I found the service to be spot on, especially for a restaurant that opened less than two weeks ago. Our server was attentive and on the ball. We never had to ask for a tea refill. We also were thanked by not only our server and the owners, but also by the other servers. Either they heard you Brianna, or you didn't hear them when you left???

By the way, we picked up a bottle of sweet and smoky on our way out. If we can't get to Porkopolis as often as we like, we can bring a little Porkopolis to our home. I can't wait to try it on some chicken, Highly unlikely we could find baby backs even close to the fall of the rib, though."}
{"text":"I wish I could dual rate.  If so I would give the food a 4 but the service a .5 better yet a 0.  Our waiter left everything to be desired.  First when asking if he recommended the Corn Chowder I was quickly schooled that nothing would be on the menu if it wasn't good.   Thanks dude.  Then he jacked up my teenagers order by bringing him his side but not his sandwich.   When asked his response was to pull out the fourth chair, sit down and school my son on how to order a sandwich.  Still stunned.  I think his name was Dave or Dan.  Will eat there again but will ask to be seated with someone else."}
{"text":"My son heard about this place on the radio and wanted to try it. We drove 40 minutes to try it out today. It's Sunday late afternoon about 4 pm. We walk in and there's only one person and he's sitting at the bar. We had second thoughts about staying. We had a family meeting (lol) an agreed to stay and we are happy we did.  Two of us ordered the Brisket French Dip and the other dish was the Brady Bacon Burger. The sides we ordered were: Garlic Mashed Potatoes, Mac & Cheese, French Fries, Cornbread, and Jalapeno Coleslaw.  We ordered 2 of the homemade desserts; Brownie Ice Cream Sandwich and the Cinnamon Apple Waffles and Vanilla ice cream sundae. Everything was really good and our waiter Brian was outstanding. I do have one suggestion for the management get some new menus. The black menu with small off-white print is very hard to see. Go with a Sand color menu with Bold Black &/or Red print. Have pictures of your dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time tonight. My husband and I decided to try the Redneck tacos, pulled pork sandwich, and the brisket sandwich. All the food was really good. The mac and cheese was my favorite. The reason why I gave it 4 stars is because we ordered takeout and the tacos were soggy. It only took ten mins for our order to be ready. Next time we want to eat in because the place is a total neighborhood hang out."}
{"text":"Great food, huge portions, combined with friendly, attentive service makes this my new go-to BBQ place in the Valley. My family and I stopped in hungry and hot after an afternoon at a nearby park. We were immediately shown to a nice table along the wall and told about their Restaurant Week specials. Let me say the Full Moon drink off the Moonshine menu was the best adult beverage I've had in months. Ole Smoky Blackberry Moonshine, Apple Pie Moonshine, combined with Peach Moonshine and sour mix, and served over ice in a Mason jar made this most refreshing. The fried pickles were a little too salty but still tasty accompanied by a smoky chipotle sauce. I had the 3-meat platter with two servings of beef brisket and one of pulled pork. Both were enjoyed, but I think next time I'll sub baby back ribs for the pork. I could not give five stars because of the saltiness of the fried pickles and the chunks of fat I had to slice out of two pieces of brisket. Really, Porkopolis is 4 1/2 stars. Wait staff was most friendly, food was tasty, and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I really like good BBQ and this is one of the best in our area. I have enjoyed their burnt ends many times, they are wonderful. The ribs are good as are the sauces. However, it would be nice if ketchup was on the table for fries, etc. along w/ the sauces. I don't like always asking for it and it's a pain for the servers when they are busy. I also enjoy their Margaritas in the Mason jars to wash down the sauce. My only dislike is I believe the sides such as coleslaw and baked beans come in small little cups and I believe these should be made larger."}
{"text":"A casual setting, smaller bar, but neat overall atmosphere. Everything on the menu looked delicious, but we started with the BBQ wings (mild sauce) for an appetizer. You get 10, and they were so good. Large and very meaty and the sauce was great!! For the entrée I got their take on the Cuban sandwich and it was life changing. The bread was fresh, soft, and slightly sweet. It came with pulled pork, two cheeses, pickles, and mustard. I dipped it in BBQ as well, not that it needed it. Literally the entire time I was eating I could not stop raving about it!! My fiancé got the two meat plate and said his was equally amazing!! Also, it was a great price for the quality and amount of food. Most plates averaged between $10-14 bucks!! I for sure recommend!!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch on Saturday.  The server was nice and the food came out fairly quickly.  I ordered a burger and let me tell you...I never knew a burger this good existed.  All other burgers will be compared to the Brady Bacon Burger from now on.  I am not kidding.  Wow.  SO good.  My husband got some redneck tacos.  He enjoyed them I think,  but I barely noticed on account of my huge delicious burger.   The jalapeno cole slaw is good and the french fries came out crisp and piping hot.  Yum.  Also, this place smells magnificent.  Can I get that in a candle?"}
{"text":"After non stop hearing about this place on Holmberg, I stopped in today with a buddy during lunch break. The service was great, quick, knowledgeable bartender/server and amazing food. Had the French dip brisket and fries which was delicious the whole way through and great portions. The Brady hot and sweet sauce is a must have. The Scottsdale location is a nice small joint with quick service and great food and beer specials. Highly recommend for lunch and happy hour."}
{"text":"Though I haven't been back since my less-than-favorable review of last week, I did want to let everyone know that management took immediate action on our review and made everything right, so we look forward to going back to try some of their new entrees.  

To set the record straight, we've had nothing but great meals at Porkopolis since they opened but had a not-so-great take out experience last week.  Everyone deserves a second chance and we're more than happy to give them one because their burnt ends are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Went there the first and last time today.  Understand, we are not \"pills\" when it comes to restuarant food.  The french fries were God awful as evidenced by my wife's plate at the end of the meal as well as the foursome at the next table who left the fries on their plates.  The brisket sandwich had little brisket and I have never seen provalone cheese on bbq, but the brisket had it.  I scraped it off as best I could.  Pulled pork was fatty.  The \"spicy slaw\" was not.  I salted and peppered it to no avail.  There were very few folks in the restuarant which is always  a problem.  The final insult was the owners or the managers were sitting at a table with a screaming kid from the time we went in to the time we left.  This is a SMALL place.  Never again, Pokapol...  I we want to eat in a private nursury, we'll pick the kid.  Final note:  if you want GREAT BBQ, it's first Honey Bears, now at 52nd street and VanBuren in PHX or Rudy's at Chandler Blvd and I 10 Freeway. We'll stand by these statements."}
{"text":"Food is amazing- atmosphere is laid back- clean and well maintained- staff is very professional and attentive."}
{"text":"Soooo good! I had pulled pork and brisket, Mac and cheese and coleslaw. I wouldn't mind eating this everyday for the rest of my life. Meat fell apart and melts in your mouth!!! The bbq sauce was delicious too!!! Was a great place for a date. As long as you don't mind getting messy. Very reasonable prices too."}
{"text":"Foods great.   The reason for 1 star is the waitress that served us was real mean bitch. Almost walked out after drink order.  So when you go stay out of the old lady with freckles section.  One of the worst experiences ever.  Won't be returning. Oh and another thing.  2 quarter size pickles for a whole sandwich is is pretty cheap. Thanks Brady you should stick with radio."}
{"text":"I didn't know this place was open. Drove by and decided to try it. Great atmosphere, timely service. Matt the owner is top notch! Food was moist and delicious! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We started with the fried pickles and burnt ends paired with a shot of apple pie moonshine.  The acidity in the pickles got my mouth watering and the moonshine was sweet and savory; a perfect combo.  

Next we tried all the meats and multiple sides.  The favorite meat selections was the pulled pork and when you topped it with some of the sweet/spicy coleslaw, the pallet started singing.  The favorite side was the creamed corn (with green chili's) but the mac & cheese was a close second.

The desert course really electrified our table.  The ice cream sandwich is simply amazing, especially when you pour a spoonful or two of the milk chocolate syrup over it.  The portion was ridiculous, one ice cream sandwich can easily serve a family of five.  Bam!  These guys get it.

To cap off a wonderful evening are two endearing features;  the owner Brady Bogen came over and visited with us AND for a value guy like me, I loved that we had a lot of take out.  The portions were HUGE and that makes Porkolopis my favorite bar-b-que in town."}
{"text":"Eh. Atmosphere is ok, food was boring, service was fantastic. Came in on a Saturday night at 6:00 and there was hardly anyone there. Server was amazing and we had no trouble getting a table for 6. I ordered the baby back ribs with fries and the jalapeño mac n cheese. The ribs were incredibly tender but had absolutely no smoke and tasted like they were cooked in a crock pot. They were then drowned in the house BBQ sauce. The mac n cheese was decent and you can't screw up fries. Had this been a meal at a friend's house it would've been great but at a BBQ restaurant? It was disappointing to say the least. There are just too many BBQ joints in this town to give this place another try. Three stars overall but one star for the food."}
{"text":"Food was good prices were good staff was friendly and the service was great glad we tried it only thing I found lacking was it was greasy but hey BBQ meat what do you expect great overall"}
{"text":"I read the reviews and tried the pulled pork and chicken with the hot n sweet bbq sauce and was impressed. I usually don't go to bbq joints because I leave feeling I could have had better at home.  Customer service was good too. Plus beer was $2. Ill definitely come back."}
{"text":"Burnt ends are to die for.. and the  Redneck tacos are amazing! 
I crave this place way too much!"}
{"text":"I ordered the burnt ends and 3 meat platter with pulled pork chicken and turkey. The burnt ends were nothing but fat hardly any meat. The pulled pork and chicken were juicy enough but the turkey was like eating a bar of salt. I got the cornbread and mac n cheese as my sides. The cornbread was dry dry dry but the mac n cheese was tasty. I didn't feel the money spent made up for the food received unfortunately.  Gotta wonder without the Sams Club there now how long will this place be there as well."}
{"text":"So I've been waiting to try this place for a long time and I was disappointed.

The only good thing was the sauce. All the meats were super dry and flavorless.

The service was good (it was a Monday).

The prices would be fair for better quality/taste but they need to work in their kitchen.

I had the brisket, ribs and pulled pork. The pulled pork was the only thing that saved the review from 1 star."}
{"text":"Had the ribs and brisket French dip and both were delicious!  The wait staff was friendly and serve us fast! Will definitely come back next time we are traveling through the area!"}
{"text":"Stopped in to grab a quick lunch last week and was extremely happy with the quality of not only the meats but the sides as well.  Ribs were amazing literally falling off the bone.  Will be going back very soon"}
{"text":"Wow!  What a nice find....I found out about Porkopolis thru Southwest' Rapid Rewards Dining website.  My wife & I stopped in during Happy Hour and found out appetizers were 1/2 price.  We had some excellent dry rub wings, burnt tips and Carnitas tacos on pancakes!  They were all $5 or $6 each during Happy Hour!  Great food and big portions!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I loved the meats! Brisket is soft and juicy, Pulled pork was tasty and ribs were very meaty! I would go here again for a meaty treat! 
I'm not fond of the dry corn bread, I do like famous Dave's corn bread muffins better and their sauces. I think Brady's sauce is a bit too sweet for me but I did use the hot and spicy one. My sons Mac n cheese had a jalapeño taste to it so he didn't like it. 
Well come back again."}
{"text":"I just got back home from eating there right now and I am pretty disappointed. As I first got there, there was no one there, I was unsure if the place was even open or not. I can now understand the empty seating. 

I had the two meat plate of ribs and brisket. The brisket was ok, had better. Then came the ribs.. I love ribs and could probably eat them everyday but this was insane. It was so dry and flavorless I might as well have ordered water flavored beef jerky. Terrible! 

The Mac and cheese was a joke, what is with this place and the bland food?? It looked good brought out with the cheese melted on the top but again, flavorless. But here came the best part, the bottom of the bowl contains plain noodles and a few were undercooked. Nice! I got a box to go just to give to my dog.. He likes dry food so it was perfect :)

Our server was a bit of an airhead. My boyfriend only had a bone left on his plate from a chicken wing (My gran didn't like hers  so she was giving them out to everyone at the table). Anyway, the server asked my boyfriend \"Are you still eating that or can I take your plate?\" Left me wondering if this guy goes home and eats bones for his enjoyment like a dog.. Then when he asked for desserts he asked our table of seven have we decided what to get for our desserts. We looked at each other in confusion because we didn't have a menu to look at to decide. 
Once I asked about what flavor cupcakes there were he said the flavors are different everyday... Awkward stare.. Ummm.. Can you tell me what the flavors are today then? He had no idea but still stood there awkwardly to get me to decide on a surprise cupcake I don't know what flavor it was. My mom had to jump in and ask the guy to check. He stood a table away and waited there until a different server came next to him to ask her. Great way to find out.. Standing there like a sitting duck.

Overall, the food was terrible and service sucks. And, while there were no customers, the servers just stand there watching tv! Atleast clean the tables because as I was sitting there, my right arm got somehow covered in this weird goo that was left there on the table.. Yuck! 

Btw... My dog never ate the leftovers, he is a typical garbage disposal when it comes to food, he even tries going through the garbage can to eat my sons doodly diapers! So, if he is not eating the food, I find it very questionable.."}
{"text":"We knew we were risking our call near closing time yet the reception received was noteworthy.  Great customer service, polite, friendly phone order taker and food was ready for 10 in a matter of minutes.  We were all impressed.  Dining on a sunday evening, we did not anticipate that restaurants would close so early but this one met our needs with hot, accurate deliciousness.  We had one person remark that the beans were spicey and she felt they were too hot for her taste.  All others enjoyed their selections.  Pulled pork was plentiful, tender, tasty and the sauce was very special with a sweet after-taste that was enjoyable.  The chicken entree was very good and the burgers were cooked to order.  Coleslaw was warm from being so close to the hot food so it had mixed reviews by our group.  This was a 10 person take out order and the consensus was that we would do it again, asap.  Thank you for a lovely meal and experience.  Price was right, too!"}
{"text":"I was told of this spot months ago but was hesitant to try it.....finally got to eat there and was pleasantly surprised. The portions are very generous,and sides were good.... (mac n cheese and jalapeno coleslaw) as for entrees the meat platter was good had ribs and  brisket.... only downside for me was the brisket could have been a little more tender,as for the ribs.... fall off the bone good. Will definitely visit again, just hate that it took me so long to visit...... Restaurant week is a fantastic idea!"}
{"text":"Porkopolis is one of my favorite places to dine! My sister and I frequently stop in for some delicious bbq (burnt ends my favorite) and to have a delightful experience with the team that provides excellent customer service. We always leave with a smile on our faces...thanks Porkopolis!"}
{"text":"If you judge a BBQ place by the smell when you walk in the door this place will get your attention right away.  It smells like any authentic down home BBQ joint you have ever been in.  Before you are even greeted by the friendly staff it's a good sign.  The menu is great, diverse and everything looks great.  I had the Cuban sandwich which had pulled pork, mustard and pickles with a side of jalapeno Cole Slaw.  It was exceptional.  Other favorites at the table were the baby back ribs.  The meat was falling off the bone but not overdone.  The appetizer was the potato chips with ranch dressing.  If you love chips this is the perfect dish.  The worst thing about the appetizer will be stepping on the scales tomorrow morning. :)  Well worth the extra pound it added to my waistline though. :)

The BBQ sauces were the best, Madison, our server was great, atmosphere was great and the food overall was better than expected.  They also do the little things right like have Stevia in the raw, not a huge thing, but very noticeable in terms or doing it right. 

I would recommend this place to anyone who loves BBQ or wants to try something different.  We will go back for sure."}
{"text":"Thank you yelp. I found this because of you! What a wonderful place, you walk in and the 
Aroma is amazing. The waiter was great, he said you could pick anything and you won't be disappointed. So I thought I would order what others have, the brisket and ribs...... Well being from the south we love our BBQ. This place was soooo good I'm lost for words on the food. They have wonderful sauces but because the food was so tasty you don't need sauce. The smokiness flavor was perfect, wish I lived here I would come in often. It had made my list of places to come back to. The waiter was awesome and he was right,  I'm not disappointed. Thank you for great service Dan you're the best"}
{"text":"The opolis of Pork was very good. Fried pickles were excellent as well as the pulled pork. Only suggestion I would have would be on the sides. My wife received the mac and cheese as her side which was delicious and a huge serving. When it came to my baked beans very good but tiny portion. It almost felt like I didn't really get any. I would just suggest getting the mac and cheese cause you get a lot more food for the price"}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ place. My favorite is the pulled pork with sweet & smokey sauce. The jalepeno mac & cheese is really good! Cornbread was just okay for me. We've had the nachos several times and they're delicious! We sat under an air vent at the booth all the way to the right and the cold air was so strong our food was freezing within minutes. Great service & good food though- we will be back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great smells, food was excellent. I had 3 meat platter.
Smoked Turkey, Baby back ribs, and pulled pork, came with 1 side a choose the green beans grilled. The Turkey was moist and juicy with every bite. The baby back ribs fell off t h e bone.  The pulled pork was moist and had a good Smokey flavor. 

A new place for me to come when I'm near Shea/Scottsdale road area."}
{"text":"I had the ribs, brisket, pulled pork and the Mac and cheese. My girlfriend hand the brisket and the turkey. The pulled pork was really good. The brisket was okay. The service was great and the sauce is awesome. Now for the bad. The ribs were not fall off the bone, and the flavor was so so. The Mac and cheese looked great, and when we dug in, it was extremely watery with little flavor. The turkey was just bad. I don't know what it was but the flavor was just not appealing."}
{"text":"My wife & I had a very enjoyable time with another couple. Three of us got the Meat loaf which we all enjoyed. My wife had a salad which she liked but thought the Meat loaf was better on this day because it was an unusually cold day and the meatloaf fit the comfort food category better. The waitress was very sweet and attentive. From the young man who greeted us when we walked in until we left, it was a great experience."}
{"text":"Nowhere near the quality of Rudy's, Andrew's or Famous Dave's. I tried most of their meats in a big combination platter and the only standout was the smoked turkey. They only serve babyback ribs that taste like the readymade supermarket variety. Brisket ranged from fatty to tough. Their creamed corn was so pathetic they should be ashamed. Sort of like a sports bar that wants to be taken seriously for BBQ but they aren't even in the ballpark. I will not return."}
{"text":"I almost feel guilty writing a review when all I had was a salad...at a BBQ joint.  Any way, I got the brisket salad.  Brisket was ok...sauce was good.  Candied pecans, blue cheese, strawberries...good stuff.

The rest of the menu looked good so I guess we can chalk this review up for the salad and I will update when I have some true BBQ."}
{"text":"We had such a great experience! The food was delicious and the service was great, our server Dan did a great job!"}
{"text":"If you walk into a barbecue restaurant with no smell of barbecue, you know they're doing something wrong.  In this place, you walk in and ALL you smell is barbecue.  That's already a good sign.

I went there last month with my parents.  We were greeted well and quickly brought to a table.  Our waiter gave us really good service, and was attentive without being annoying.  My parents ordered the BBQ Nachos, substituting brisket for the chicken for no extra charge.  They come with freshly-made potato chips topped with cheese, cheese sauce, green onion, pico de gallo and sour cream.  That was unexpectedly good.  I ordered a brisket sandwich on a toasted bun with pepper jack cheese, along with crispy shoestring fries.  The brisket was good, tender and smoky, the way it's supposed to be.

It turned out that my dad didn't get a whole lot of meat on his nachos.  The waiter was cool about it, and got him another healthy portion of brisket for no extra charge.  On top of that, he also brought a free dessert to make up for the mistake.  Talk about service!

That was my first time at Porkopolis, and definitely won't be my last."}
{"text":"Best ribs I think I've ever had. We shared the 3 meat combo between the two of us and it was plenty. The jalapeño Mac and cheese is the perfect amount of spicy."}
{"text":"My husband and I have enjoyed eating at Porkopolis since it first opened in 2012. The food is delicious and they have amazing happy hour specials. Our favorite menu items are the Red Neck Tacos and Wings. The wings are in a dry rub and perfectly cooked. I've yet to have something I didn't like here, and their breakfasts are super unique and delicious too."}
{"text":"Besides the fact that Brady from 98KUPD owns it, the bacon bloody Mary's kick ass. Only reason I didn't 5 star is because I have not eaten there yet. I will definitely be back! And....MORE BACON! lol"}
{"text":"Hey the happy hour is pretty great, at least the prices are. Not sure if I like the idear (yes, I spelled it that way on purpose, you'll live) of potatos chips for nachos, but I guess I've survived worse. The meats (or do I have be trendy and say \"protein\" now while I wear $200 spandex pants and a shirt that says \"ATHLETE\" across the back? Nah, fuck that noise.) are solid. All prices are decent, and that's my litmus test for anything regarding food."}
{"text":"I have been to Porkopolis a few times now. Reasonably priced, great food, and great staff and atmosphere. I would highly recommend trying this place out if your looking for great BBQ in North Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"Our table got the fried pickles and brisket burnt ends, both delicious! Food was all great, especially loved the ribs, pulled pork, mac and cheese and dirty rice. Friend was not a fan of the BBQ beans, that was the only negative. Come hungry--none of us finished even half our plates!"}
{"text":"Had the brisket French dip, and it was delicious. Big portion sizes. The service is great, very friendly. Great place for BBQ"}
{"text":"Food was amazing, service was absolutely awesome. And the atmosphere was very relaxing."}
{"text":"Just not great food. Ordered a brisket sandwich that was dry, beans were more of a chili. The nachos were pretty good. The waitress however was great, when we told her the food wasn't what we expected she made sure to get us food that we liked. She  made the experience much better."}
{"text":"I must admit ever since I saw the \"coming soon\" banner on the store I've been waiting to taste some BBQ! Porkopolis more than delivered. The setting was much fancier than I had imagined it to be which is fine because this section of Chandler is starved for sit down eateries. Upon walking in my sister and I were graciously greeted by staff. We started off with the BBQ Shrimp Skewers which we nicely paired with coleslaw and mango salsa (the salsa was more of a chutney- wasn't my favorite but it's passable). My sister had the Brisket sandwich ($10) which was served on brioche bread (nice touch!) she wolfed it down so fast that I didn't even get to taste a piece. Her sandwich also came with Cream of corn which looked super luscious but she struggled to eat it because she did not have a spoon. I had the 2 item combo ($14) I choose the Ribs and Pulled pork. The ribs were meaty and tender and the Pulled pork was amazing!!! The sides of choose with my combo were the Mac and Cheese and BBQ Beans. The Mac is comes in a very large portion and it's probably one of the best mac's that I've had in a while. The BBQ Beans were slightly sweet and savory, I enjoyed the flavor but again it was a struggle to eat because I had no spoon! The house BBQ is served on the table but if you like hotter food you can ask for their spicier BBQ. I like how this place had both linen and regular napkins makes eating BBQ less messy. At the end of the meal we were given moist toilettes. The I only thing I recommend is fresh squeezed lemonade instead of that stuff on tap and giving spoons to folks who order beans or cream of corn."}
{"text":"The food was absolutely amazing.  The fried pickles and the sauce that it came with is mouth watering and light. The prices and drinks are great as well."}
{"text":"I'm not a bbq fan but saw this place and thought we should give it a try. OMG one of the best decisions !!! Food is so yummy. Love the jalapeño coleslaw.  Great atmosphere,  we would definitely come back with our friends !! I wish the fried pickles are sliced a bit thinner. Burnt ends that we had was awesome! !!! I love the Hot and Sweet sauce, I did however added a few dashes of tobacco sauce to it too. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Friday Night BBQ!!!
Didn't start off so good, something was wrong with the exhaust system in the kitchen. The doors were open to allow some of the smoke out which made the restaurant a bit warm.  The regular black iced tea was not so good but the passion fruit tea was good. 
The three of us each ordered something different and shared.  
The Turkey was among the best I've had anywhere. 
Pulled-pork was amazing.
Pork ribs very good.
I'm not a chicken fan, but I'll say it had great flavor and was very moist.
The brisket was a good piece of meat and had great flavor, but was not as moist as it could have been.  Don't get me wrong it was very good, just not championship level.  (I'd order it again, championship level brisket is very hard to find... I'm a bit of a brisket snob!)
Our sides were:
Coleslaw - French Fries - Beans - Mac n Cheese.  I like the beans and Mac n Cheese the best!
Our server was Megan, she did a great job taking care of us.  She is super friendly and you can tell she truly likes her job.  
I'll be back soon and often."}
{"text":"We came here last minute on a Thursday night. For us coming so late an hour before closing. Our food was very fresh and the staff was very atenative to us. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been here a couple of times. We go for lunch so its not too busy. We were seated immediately by the owner. The environment is laid back and comfortable. I had the french dip sandwich which is the best I've ever had! It was full of flavor and served on a soft roll with au jus. My husband had the 3 meat plate and it was so much food we brought left overs home. We had dessert of cupcakes and vanilla ice cream. Cupcakes were moist and really tasty. We love the food here and plan to visit more often!"}
{"text":"The pulled pork is awesome so is the brisket dinner.  If your hungry I recommend it, just be careful if you are a CCW carrier.  The sign by the door is not very visible so you may get in a pinch if you don't see it."}
{"text":"Love the food!!! We have been there many many times now,  each time I try something different and can't decide what I like best. All the food is great! Even my kids love it.  We always get the nachos and fried pickles to start and end with the ice cream sandwich. Best place in the valley!"}
{"text":"Visited 5/27/12...

So was craving BBQ.  What would be better than that on Memorial Day Weekend. 

Went with two other friends.  Had heard this place had recently opened and my friend had heard by rumor mill it was good. 

First, I don't give much stake to reviews.  I am the type of person that has to try it myself to believe it.  However, in this case the reviews that reflect the 2 Star rating are extremely accurate. 

They had half priced appetizers.  We had an order of the Red Neck Tacos.  Pulled Pork with Jalapeno slaw over corn cakes.  These were probably the best thing we ordered.  Although the Pulled Pork was much like my main order, see below..

Had 3 Meat meal with Pulled Pork, Brisket and Baby Backs. Baby Backs are a 1/4 slab.  It came with 4.  So I had to research to learn that a Full Slab is considered about 16 Ribs.  However, these were very small, for whatever that is worth.  Another friend had 3 Meat with Chicken.  In all cases, the four available meat choices were dry and over cooked. Baby Backs, the meat was falling off the bone - over cooked. The rub was extremely salty and overpowered any meat taste, smoke taste and BBQ Sauce.  Brisket, dry.  Chicken, dry, Pulled Pork was probably the best of the 4 meats - dry.  The BBQ sauces are lacking.  One that I still don't know what it was supposed to be, another a little spicier and there regular. 

A third friend stuck with his own order of Red Neck Tacos and then a side of Mac & Cheese.  This side was really pretty good.  Maybe the second best thing we had. 

I was extremely disappointed.

It is not open for lunch, which is maybe the only other time I might try to return for a sandwich.  Otherwise, there are way too many other locations that serve better BBQ than this. 

If you are thinking about it, don't do what I do... Trust some of the reviews and maybe move on."}
{"text":"So I pass by this corner *all* the time and I never knew this place even existed.  I had to find out from Yelp... that's not good marketing.

Hubby was in the mood for Joe's BBQ last night and so to break out of the routine of going to Gilbert for our BBQ fix, I convinced him to try this place out, quoting some of the remarks fellow Yelpers had provided.  

He ordered the 3 meats (ribs, brisket, pulled pork) and I had (stupidly!!!) the Asian Pork Salad... FYI: DON'T BOTHER getting this salad: it was soggy with sugary dressing, the \"mixed greens\" were literally iceberg lettuce with about 5-10 leaves of spring mix, the peppers were barely there and so was the pork portion.  I was very disappointed and, frankly, peeved that I chose that when I should've just gone with my instinct of a pulled-pork sandwich.  Whatever...

Hubby's meats were tasty - we both noted the brisket was very dry and had to load it with BBQ.  I tried the pulled pork from his platter and loved the bark.. dark, crispy, fatty, yummy, sweet.. good stuff.  I know what I'm getting next time!  Hubby however, was not as impressed with the meats - said they were good, but still thinks Joe's can't be beat.  He says that if you want to hang out with your buddies to have some cold brews and good BBQ, this is your place... but if you're focus is great BBQ, he says to stick with Joe's.

Oh yeah and you need to try the Mac & Cheese - the best I've ever had... creamy, cheesy, bits of non-cheese flavoring that are exciting and addicting.

Also, they served ice cold Firestone IPA - delish!

Service was nice and so was the ambiance.  I am a fan of the mac n cheese and the pork bark here, but hubby is still a Joe's believer... so, there you have it."}
{"text":"Wow! The seating was uncomfortable, the service was unengaged and the food was downright terrible. The assumed owner or manager just stood around with the employees, we weren't offered a second round of drinks, we waited forever just to ask for our check. The brisket and chicken were so dry and the greenbeans were disgusting.  As I'm typing this my hubby is on his third trip to the bathroom with the runs. We won't be back. Too bad, we were looking forward to finding a new favorite restaraunt!"}
{"text":"My 2nd time trying the place.  Friendly workers, good food but pricey food and they are stingy on the portions.  If money is not an option then double down on the meat.  It tastes great but for the price you get a little portion."}
{"text":"I decided to try lunch here today based off the Yelp reviews and photos. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, jalapeño coleslaw, and dirty rice. I wish I would have just stuck to Famous Dave's. The food looked good but the taste didn't match. Everything I ordered lacked flavor except the bbq sauce. The dirty rice was bland,dry, meat less, and didn't have the holy trinity or any fresh veggies for that matter. The little veggies in it are dehydrated veggies which leads me to believe this wasn't from scratch. The dirty rice from Popeyes taste better. The coleslaw was completely flavorless and leaves you with an after taste of jalapeño and that's it. The bun to my sandwich was soft but once again the meat didn't have any flavoring to it, the bbq sauce helped a little bit. Maybe I caught them on a bad day."}
{"text":"Good selection of smokey meats, a little fatty at times but lots of flavor.  Definitely try the burnt ends!  Also a small but good selection of craft beers.  Not the best BBQ i've ever eaten, but better than decent, and worth trying."}
{"text":"The service was wonderful. But the food. Wow it was amazing. The turkey was the best but everything was so good.  It was clean and well decorated. The staff was friendly and helpful. We will be back."}
{"text":"If you you are on a quest to find the driest overcooked reheated BBQ,  You will strike gold with this joint.  Save yourself the disappointment and dine some place else."}
{"text":"This was a nice surprise...we decided to try this fairly new BBQ restaurant. They have an extensive menu including burgers,sandwiches and all the usual BBQ favorites.We tried the two meat entree which comes with two sides. Our choice was the brisket and baby backs. The brisket was lean and moist, and, very tender. It comes dry so you can add which ever sauce you like. The babybacks were very tender, but, too much sauce for my liking. Next time i would have them hold the sauce. The sides were jalapeño coldslaw and the mac.and cheese. Both the sides could have used a little more zip and heat, but, o.k. We also had the Cleveland skillet dinner which was burnt end cut with cottage potatoes and coleslaw. It is served in a castiron skillet. It was very good, but, also could have used a little spice. The quality of their meats is very good. They offer a large selection of appetizers and a full bar. We would diffently return, but, would definately not miss the brisket. They offer dine in and takeout. There are several TV' s showing sports. Our waiter, Dave, was both helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"We have been here about 3 more times now, and the quality of the food has been getting worse and worse. The mac and cheese was bland and not fresh; the mashed potatoes tasted horrible; the meat wasn't \"fall off the bone\" like our first visit. 

I did get a salad and it was really good, and the corn bread croutons were yummy. But overall I'm disappointed and am sick of spending $50-70 on mediocre BBQ when our first visit was delicious BBQ."}
{"text":"Thank goodness! Good BBQ in Scottsdale. The ribs, pulled pork and brisket were excellent! Moist and tasty! The 2 sauces are both the bomb. Beans actually had more meat than beans, super good. The mac N cheese is also excellent. The coleslaw was a bit bland, but the Brady's siracha made it great. Super service topped it all off!"}
{"text":"I love this place, the have great bbq, and a killer happy hour.  The sauces are great, and love the moonshine cocktails.

That's it! Just a great place."}
{"text":"Ok, so I am biased on my bbq. I have a particular sauce I like, that you can't get in Phoenix, so there's that. But anyway, decided to try this place out with some coworkers. 

I ordered the 2 meat plate. Ok. Not bad. Not awesome. The brisket was really dry and not much flavor - so I added the smokey sauce. The smokey sauce is ok - a little too sweet for my liking. The turkey however was good and moist, but I do have to say more salty than any real bbq flavor. I kind of left with the impression that the sauce had to be added to everything to make it \"bbq\". Warning - the macaroni and cheese has jalapenos or something in it. I would also call this a bit flavorless - maybe that is why the jalapenos are in it - to add something. 

Overall, it was ok. I wouldn't make a special trip to come here in the future."}
{"text":"I went in to have their burnt ends for lunch with my mom. We ended up getting those plus a sandwich special. The special was a combo sandwich and fries. 

Everything was very good. It we way too much food though so we both ended up with more than half a sandwich to go. There are a lot worse things to happen. 

Our server was Megan and she was great as well. This is my new favorite barbeque place in Chandler. Give them a try."}
{"text":"Ordered the Asian spare ribs. Very tender meat on top of mashed potatoes mixed with veggies and teriyaki sauce. Very delicious!

4 adults and 3 small kids (who shared meals), no alcohol, and bill came to $88.

Good and friendly staff. It's a small place inside and the noise level is not real conducive to speaking at a distance."}
{"text":"Ok. Not good enough to go back. I can name at least 10 other better bbq places within 30 min of here"}
{"text":"I finally tried this place today and I'm glad I did. Being a KC native, I have found it difficult to find good bbq in the valley. When I'm craving bbq in the future, I'll be going back here. I'm looking forward to trying their burnt ends and french fries. 

I ordered the two meat platter with brisket, pulled pork, mac n cheese, and bbq beans. The bbq beans were more like the beans I'm used to (made with bbq sauce), not the cowboy beans you typically get in the valley. The mac n cheese seemed homemade, but it needed a bit of salt and pepper - I like pepper in my mac n cheese.

The brisket was deliciously smoky and had a perfect pink ring around the edge. It could have been more tender, but it was leaps and bounds better than the fatty, no flavor brisket I usually get out here. 

The pulled pork was fantastic and it's not something I usually get. It was extremely moist, tender, and flavorful and there was no fat. 

The presentation also reminded me of home with the two slices of white bread under the meat and pickles on the side. One of my favorite things about bbq is eating white bread soaked in sauce. 

Unfortunately, the only thing I didn't like was the bbq sauce, but that is a personal preference. All three of their sauces are sweet and I do not like sweet bbq sauce. I would have given them five stars if I liked their bbq sauce.

I can't speak much to the service and ambiance because I ordered carry out. However, the hostess was very friendly/helpful and there was a nice bar with tv's. 

If you are craving quality smoked meats, this is your place."}
{"text":"Our waiter was really nice-friendly and funny. Celebrated my aunt's birthday here two hours ago for dinner. We chose from 2 meats and 2 sides.

I ordered pulled pork/ baby back ribs with sides of french fries and corn bread.
Yeah my cousin took my cornbread before I had the chance to eat it and yes I wanted to take their Sweet & Smokey - KC Syle BBQ Sauce and just run off with it lol that sauce made a difference when you bite into that brisket, pork, or burger.

We thought it was a big serving so a few of us shared food but wow it was a good amount for just yourself to pig out. So next time I come and eat here I'll order for myself and that cornbread to myself! Lol"}
{"text":"We went here kind and of late in the evening when we first moved into our new house. We had the 3 meat platter, fries and jalapeño Mac n cheese. The three meats were the brisket, ribs and pulled pork. Their own sauces are pretty good but the food can be enjoyed without it too. Also we had the brisket burnt ends which we loved and they just melt in your mouth. I like their signature moonshine drinks too but a whiskey and coke goes well with the food too. Also, the staff are friendly, efficient and knowledgeable about the menu. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Let me preface my review by saying that the food here is not bad. It's really not. However, it is not worth the costs. I paid somewhere around $14 for my plate and it was pathetic. There was hardly any meat on my sandwich. If I had to guess, there was probably at best 4oz of pork and brisket on it. Worst of all, my beans were served in a tiny condiment cup. Yep. A condiment cup. Those little white cups they serve dressing and ketchup in on the side. 

I can't recommend this place to anyone when they're charging those prices and serving portions that small. I felt ripped off and don't plan on returning here."}
{"text":"Good food, outstanding service, and the best happy hour in the Valley.  Reagan rocks!

I recommend the BBQ Chicken Nachos, the Quesadillas, and the Burnt ends!

I once had smoked Prime Rib which was phenomenal."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Porkopolis out in Chandler - which was amazing!! But this one falls unfortunately short in comparison. We ordered pick up, which was probably our first mistake. By the time we got home to eat, everything was overly dry and almost tasteless. I say it's wroth a drive to the Chandler location!"}
{"text":"Freaking delicious. The bbq nachos are yummmmmmmy btw. And half off for HH. :-)"}
{"text":"Look, I am not even a BBQ enthusiast... BEST BBQ I HAVE EVER HAD.  I got the pick 2 plate. Bbq pulled pork, and the half rack. The meat fell off the bone-- big chunks. 

Had the moonshine Kool Aide- wow:)

The staff was great, and the price was spot on."}
{"text":"Friends recommended this! Burnt end hash! Delicious. The hot & sweet sauce is delicious!"}
{"text":"Initially, I thought the prices were a bit high. Until you get the food. I can have several meals off one plate. The meat (brisket and pulled pork) was tender and plentiful.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This was our first time at this new restaurant and it will also be the last time. We wanted some place close to our house since we had time constraints. When we first walked in, we got excited with the smell because we love BBQ. We ordered deep fried pickles which were great for an appetizer and then for the entrees. My mother in law order the BBQ Jambalaya, which was a mistake. Rice was super dry and the meat portion of shrimp and chicken was a little light for the price. My wife ordered the Salmon, which that is a joke. Should have called it the guppy. The serving was about 1/3 to 1/2 the size of any Salmon you would get anywhere else for the same price, and it was laid atop that same DRY dirty rice. I ordered the 2 meat platter with bean and fries. I had pulled pork and brisket. Both were pretty good and the sauce was good, but there was some fat included and I have never been served fat pieces from any other BBQ. The kicker here was 8 oz of meat for $14.95!! At Joe's REAL BBQ, you can get the same thing for $10.49 or get 12 oz of meat with 2 sides for 12.99. This will be the last time I go here. If I want BBQ, I am heading over Joe's BBQ in Gilbert or even Chandler BBQ Company which we have had before and we like as well."}
{"text":"We have been to the site twice since my previous review. Management visibly on hand to assist, food was fast and hot. Discovered the Red Neck Tacos - Amazing! Huge portion! Great price $11 and half off during happy hour.  A must have!"}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place so I had to check it out.  I had lunch there with my boss (he paid - heck yeah) and I really enjoyed it.  I ordered the combo brisket pork sandwich and fries, and I forgot what my boss ordered because I was totally focused on MY sandwich.  The meat was tender and flavorful, and the hot n smokey bbq sauce was the perfect amount of hot and super tasty.  When I ordered, the server asked me if I wanted ketchup or ranch dressing for my fries.  I love that.  Usually I have to ask at least twice at other places before the server brings me ranch.

I definitely recommend this place.  Next time I will order the brisket burnt ends and fried pickles."}
{"text":"We drove by this place a couple times and decided to try it out. We are from TX and are very picky about our BBQ. This place did not disappoint. The service was great, the atmosphere nice, and the food was served promptly. I had the brisket platter with the burnt tips. It was awesome. We're going there again. I really liked that on the menu was salmon, cooked to order. Where do you ever see that in a BBQ place? The helpings were huge, which justified the price. I had leftovers for lunch today and will again tomorrow. Highly recommended. Oh and the beans were the best I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"If you're going to get into the BBQ game you'd better bring it. While the meat was tender it lacked the punch for a place that comes with a lot of hype. It was worth a try. I will just have to keep searching for my new home."}
{"text":"The brisket was very good, everything else kinda fell short. There was jalapeños in everything. Ribs were decent."}
{"text":"Wow really great food here from Kansas City found it on yelp gave it at try well worth it friendly and customer service was awesome totally need to try"}
{"text":"Good stuff.  I really like the ribs and the smoked wings; you don't even need sauce on either of these.

The restaurant itself is more modern than I'd expected for a BBQ place, and the bar is nice as well.

Servers are all friendly and can even manage putting up with my dad's rude requests with a smile."}
{"text":"I've visited this location twice and have been happy both times. The pulled pork has a great Smokey flavor to it that most other BBQ joints don't have. The brisket is good, but nothing amazing. Their meat trays are a great value for the price amount of food and variety that you get. The Mac n cheese is good but (WHY?) put jalapeño flavor in the Mac n cheese that is served to kids? 

Side note: the toilet seat was broken and I almost fell in. Went back later and all they did was put a not saying it was loose. It wasn't even connected."}
{"text":"I finally checked this place out, and let me tell you, the food was amazing! I've tried three of the other BBQ places in Chandler, and Porkopolis definitely beats them no questions asked!  I had the pulled BBQ sandwich and BBQ beans.  The sandwich was AWESOME!  The best pulled pork sandwich I have ever had!  The BBQ beans were really great too!  This is my new favorite BBQ place!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time recently and ordered carryout. I was sent to the bar where a guy took my order. He did not seem happy I was doing carryout or he just has a unfriendly personality. No eye contact and did not say much to me.

I got a pulled pork sandwich with fries. The sandwich was full of meat! It was packed! Also included were a side if BBQ & ketchup in mini solo cups. There were two dill pickles on the side. I'm glad they were not on the sandwich!

The sandwich was very good. I will be back. I love my ketchup and can tell they use a cheaper brand. They do not use heinz and it's noticeable. Please switch as your current offering is not good. I will have skip the fries next time and get beans due to the ketchup. Fries are good. 

The inside has a nice feel and I love the funny sign with the rules. Plenty of people inside. Great place overall!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food here! Super laid back place, it was quiet, and service was very fast! I had the Cuban and it was delicious! Also the Mac n cheese in the kids meal was yummy too!"}
{"text":"Decent place but the overly loud and neurotic redhead manager/waitress lady is nerve racking!!!

If you go here to relax with a nice meal and a drink she will kill it. Her loud voice and constant complaining is like nails on a chalkboard"}
{"text":"Tried it last night for the first time, and was very dissapointed. Just for the record,Iam a CIA graduate and have been a professional chef for 25 years now. Service and  atmosphere was friendly, warm and attentive. The food on the other hand was good and bad at the same time. The fried pickles were crisp and plentiful, but had way to much salt which overpowered even the dill flavor . We tried the beef brisket which was moist ,tender and a nice portion, but then again with the heavy salt. The biggest problem was the brisket had no smoke flavor what so ever.This was not BBQ, it was slow cooked in a regular oven. The sides were fair at best. The mac and cheese had no cheddar , crust or any color for that matter.It needed a little texture. My lemonade was from a mix. We were hoping for great things as this is close by. We'll have to keep looking."}
{"text":"The service was great. We sat at the bar and were greeted with a smile. It wasn't long after ordering our first drinks and food that it all went downhill. 

We smelled rotten eggs or sewage. We asked our server if there was a natural gas leak and were informed that it was in fact...sewage. We were told that the floor drains don't have the proper and/or adequate gas trap installed so raw sewage smell comes up into the restaurant. 

Our server had even lit a candle in an attempt to mask the nasty order. We were also told that the owner is refusing to fix the issue because it would involve taking up some of the floor.

We elected to sit outside instead of continuing to smell sewage while we ate. 

I wish that was the end of our problems. Shortly after relocating outside our food arrived. One of the sides was wrong and the same plate had the worst cuts of brisket ever. I had brisket as well, yet the two servings seemed to be cut from separate pieces of meat. 

The server rectified the wrong side and we were more than happy with them. The server is not the issue. 

My overall review is this: if you don't mind eating your meal in the bathroom...you'll love the place."}
{"text":"I made a pickup order through Yelp. Extremely easy! Quaint restaurant, the gentlemen who helped me was very nice. The redneck tacos are pretty delicious. The jalapeño slaw is awesome, I could eat a whole bowl of it. We ordered the pork salad, fresh and good dressing. I will definite come back with my family."}
{"text":"Been meaning to come here for quite a while. Wish I would've come sooner. Great looking place and the food was awesome. I had the brisket French dip. OUTSTANDING! My girlfriend had the baby backs which we're also very good. We're definitely coming back here. Good job guys!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out, brisket and ribs. Brisket was the driest brisket I've ever had. Ribs were nothing special but salvaged the disappointing take out."}
{"text":"Good joint, great name.

First visit here and it was tasty.

Had the 3 meat plate with one side. Brisket, pulled pork and ribs with mac and cheese.

-Pulled pork was my fav, had crispy bits and great flavor.
-Brisket was super moist
-Ribs were good with a bit crispy/dry on the edges (which i kinda like)
-Mac and cheese was good and it was topped off with even more cheese :-)

Two sauces. One sweet and smokey one hot and sweet.  The hot and sweet was my preferred one.

Overall place is kind of updated bar feel and seem to have decent beers on tap, typical sit down type restaurant. Service was quick and on tops of things.

Worth a try especially if in this part of town."}
{"text":"I had the Porkopolis 3 meat platter with brisket, pulled pork and baby back ribs.  It comes with 2 sides, I chose BBQ beans and mac & cheese.  The meats were all delicious.  The brisket had a perfect burnt top and the meat was juicy and fell apart.  Meat fell off the baby back ribs.  The pulled pork was also good, but I chunk of turkey or chicken fat in the middle.  The BBQ beans were good, however they were rather small and seemed more like a sweet chili.  I didn't care for the mac and cheese, Kraft is better.  I was going to give 4 until I found the chunk of fat in the pulled pork."}
{"text":"My Dirty Bird sandwich was an instant classic. The turkey is a thick slice, so thick that I thought no way would this be tender, but it was the tenderest turkey in a long time. The sandwich was topped with jalapeno coleslaw, which was good, but had no kick. The Texas Toast was a good choice of bread as well and this is worth the $10 price tag at lunch. Not everything else was great.
3 meat platter - Contained some of the worst, fattiest brisket ever put on a plate. What chef would serve an entire piece of all fat brisket? the other two meats (chicken and pulled pork) received average reviews.
Dirty Rice - nothing special that I couldn't make at home..dry and flavorless
Mac N Cheese - costs a dollar extra for some reason, but skip this side. It was simply elbow macaroni noodles with cheese melted on top.
Sauces - All kinds of artificial ingredients and both sauces actually contained anchovies!!

Waitress/bartender had no personality, like a robot, but if you get the dirty bird all that goes out the window and you will enjoy your lunch. Watch out though, dinner prices are so jacked up it's a bit crazy..The 3 meat dinner is like 7 bucks more than the same exact item at lunch."}
{"text":"First time to Porkopolis and it did not disappoint! Couldn't decide between the Burnt Ends or Ribs. Thanks to the waiter, who let me in on an a little well known secret. Told me to get the meat platter and do both for a $1.00 up-charge.

Paired with a side of Corn Bread and Bomb Mac & Cheese, the result is a nice little Friday night food coma and enough leftovers for lunch tomorrow. 

I shall return hungry for more!"}
{"text":"Had the red neck tacos at the Big Red Night of the Dead concert. These were amazing. I will absolutely stop by the Chandler location to get some more and try the ribs."}
{"text":"Food was good had the redneck tacos and fried pickles and a pineapple mojito staff was attentive and friendly will definitely come back for something else"}
{"text":"This place has outstanding service, cold beers, delicious and plentiful food and all on the cheap. I actually cannot wait to go here again."}
{"text":"Real solid bbq.  We had 2 meat 2 side with pulled pork and brisket.  Flavorful and plentiful.  Mac n cheese side ok but not worth more $$ than other sides.  Dirty rice good, french fries surprisingly very good (well seasoned.  Also got burnt ends which are my absolute favorite.  These were good but did get more pieces of fat than anywhere else I've ordered.  Garlic mashed potatoes pretty garlicky.  Nothing lacking in flavor/taste.  Service solid.  Good place.  Gotta lose the fat and some grease on burnt ends though."}
{"text":"Well my husband and I went here for lunch today and we both ordered the 3 meat plate and we both ordered brisket, pork, and ribs. The ribs were the best out of everything. I looked over to my husbands plate and he picked up was was suppose to be pork and he was a pile of fat, so I asked the server if we had both ordered the same thing and she said yes, so I asked her why it was just a pile of fat, so she brought us some more meat on a separate plate. Then I had ordered creamed corn as my side, it was almost the size of a baby food jar not quite. ???? And we also ordered the Mac and Cheese, I make Velveeta at home that taste better than that. I'm so glad someone else gave me a gift card to go here for $40.00 bucks, because I would've been so mad if I had paid for this meal. We won't be back, I've had better elsewhere."}
{"text":"I tried the shrimp, chicken & pulled pork jambalaya. It was super tasty!! More of a BBQ flavor than typical spicy jambalaya. A nice change I thought. The lunch portion was enough to feed three, so I went home with leftovers. I can't wait to dine here again. The service was terrific!"}
{"text":"My husband and I finally made it in to try Porkopolis.  We are big fans of Holmberg's Morning Sickness and Brady, so we wanted to give the place a try. 
We went on a Saturday about 2pm for a late-ish lunch. 
The place was quiet, but there were several tables occupied.  We were greeted and seated promptly.
I ordered the Brisket Sandwich and my husband ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich from the lunch menu.  He got the fries, I got the beans.  
When our plates arrived, my husband's plate was half full of fries, while my beans occupied a teeny tiny little cup, like the kind you get when you ask for a side of ranch dressing.  The beans were delicious, but the portion was sadly small.
The sauces on the table were delicious.  I liked the sweeter one while my husband liked the spicier one.  
For the most part, I think it was worth the price.  The service was good and the sandwiches were great.  I'll get the fries next time, you get more of those than the beans."}
{"text":"Visited here because my son loves BBQ.  I had the burnt ends and they were the fattiest bits of brisket I've ever been served. I informed the waiter who said he would let the cook know but nothing offered in the form of credit or a way to make up for the poorly prepared meal. My wife had the pork tacos and they were average at best. Went here because of the high ratings. No idea why they are rated this high. We won't return."}
{"text":"Seriously one of the best BBQ places I've been too with friendly staff!
Burnt ends appetizer was hands down the best - no BBQ joint has been able to compete for me!
I had the smoked shrimp and the green beans was the perfect addition.  
Will go back as often as possible!"}
{"text":"Wow! Once again I ordered sauces online. I've bought bbq sauces from coast to coast and am very picky about what I use on my bbq. I've had some good, some bad, some mediocre. When I found Brady's I was hooked. Their sweet and smoky had me! Since then they've brought out the Gold-N-Sweet which I love on chicken. The best new addition is their Spicy Asian. It's great on pork, chicken, well pretty much anything. Again I ordered online and, again postal service managed to break 1 of the 4 bottles. Again, Brady's stood up and replaced it. Brady's is MY sauce to use now. Thanks for the great customer service again!"}
{"text":"Went here tonight with the family. It isn't bad, however it isn't my favorite. 

Had the beef brisket platter with garlic mashed potatoes and jalapeno cole slaw. The brisket was decent. The potatoes were lumpy which I liked, however they were dry and I didn't taste garlic. Now the cole slaw on the other hand was delicious. It wasn't overly saturated with mayo, nor was it sweet. Should I come back, I will be ordering two sides of the cole slaw. 

The prices seem a bit high compared to their competitors."}
{"text":"I'll tell you what folks, this is the best BBQ place I've been to in a while.  I'm in town for work and was having a hard time deciding what sounded good for lunch.  Looked on yelp for nearby restraunts and saw this had good reviews so decided to give it a shot.  

Walked in and they were filming a show for food network.  Sweet...if it's decent enough to make it on TV, must be worth it right?  I ordered the two meat lunch combo with brisket and chicken, mac-n-cheese and green beans for sides.  

When the food arrived I was really surprised to see that the green beans were fresh and not the usual canned beans that are spiced/seasoned up you get at most bbq places.  The mac was also good,  home made and not box mix, but not the best I've had.  Brisket was killer!  Nice thick, moist pieces that melted in your mouth and by far the best brisket I've eaten in quite some time.  Chicken wasn't anything to brag about.  I was hoping for smoked chicken on the bone, but got a pile of chopped chicken they probably also used for bbq chicken sandwhiches.  It was still good though, moist and not dry.

All in all, this place is well worth it.  Prices were great for the portion sizes you get.  I stuffed myself and still wasnt able to finish the plate for $25 including tip.  If you're looking for good bbq try this place out."}
{"text":"Solid 2-1/2 stars... The first time we came here, the brisket was so tender and delicious, this time it was tough & dry. The jalapeno coleslaw was bland & dry as well, didn't even eat it & I love coleslaw. The baby back ribs were scrumptious & would order those again. My husbands plate with the brisket, pork, etc (3 meat plate) was overall underwhelming, the dirty rice was again dry, the only thing on his plate that sang to us, was the pulled pork. I think they need to work on consistency and quality control to level the food service better. BUT the customer service we received was excellent and always very accommodating and we really appreciate that! And as much as we love the service, it really comes down to the food & I think they still need to work out the kinks... Sorry =("}
{"text":"The good:
-Ribs were great, although smothered with a bbq sauce. I prefer their spicy bbq sauce so i would have like to put that on instead.
-Smoked meatloaf was decent, not very smokey but the green beans and mashed potatoes were the stars of that dish.

The bad:
-the redneck tacos, which are historically amazing, this time did not have a single jalapeño in the slaw but was covered in green onion.
-Do not order the cornbread. It was so flat, undercooked, and covered in grease.
-Creamed corn was a joke, served in a condiment cup, it tasted like canned corn, mixed with milk and sugar. It was so watery. Not good. 

I have been here before and had a great time with really good food, maybe they were having an off night but i feel like it was a big waste of a meal."}
{"text":"Great food! Got the BBQ burger, Mac n cheese, and mashed potatoes and they were all delicious. Super friendly and helpful staff. When we finished eating our server even brought us refills of our drinks in to-go cups! Definitely will be eating here again for lunch!"}
{"text":"Yum! My husband had smoked turkey and the ribs with the garlic mashed potatoes and green beans. I had brisket and pulled pork with the jalapeño mac and cheese. Everything was good. The smoky BBQ sauce was really tasty! They should add some sausage to the meat choices. A little on the pricy side. It was about $22 for each 2 meat plate. But they are pretty generous with the portions.  If I could do 4.5 stars I would."}
{"text":"Finally tried this place after knowing about it and driving by dozens of times.. Hopefully it won't be so long until my next visit as I enjoyed it quite a bit.  The smell inside this place is amazing..  I really had a tough time deciding what to get as everything looked and sounded really good.  Started with the fried pickles - quite tasty.  Ended up getting the 3-meat platter with the Turkey, Brisket, and Ribs - mashed potatoes and cornbread for the sides.  The food came out quickly as it was pretty slow for an early Tuesday night.  Everything was wonderful.  The brisket was sliced thin.. the ribs fell off the bone.. and the turkey was juicy and flavorful.  Potatoes and cornbread were good though they were just sides and my main focus was on the meat.  

The service was great.. our server Madison was very friendly and attentive.  The place itself was nice looking with a modern/rustic look - the wooden tables and lighting were quite nice.  Food prices were pretty reasonable.. $8 for a cocktail was a bit steep for me, but overall I give this place an A+"}
{"text":"We have a new favorite BBQ place in Chandler. We had never been here before and we're very pleasantly surprised. I had the brisket au jus and my wife had the pulled pork sandwich. Our waitress, Stacy, was very cheerful and attentive. The sweet and smoky sauce was very tasty. We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Great Ribs. Nachos brisket was awesome.

The service was great, my son ordered a steak and the staff were concerned it was taking too long so they gave us complimentary appetizer to eat while we waited. Irony was the steak came out quite fast.

When the food came the servings were huge, fresh and tasted great."}
{"text":"There was a really nice man named Scott who worked there. For the one time me and my family went out, we didn't feel forgotten. Our server always checked on us to see how we were doing. Also, their pulled pork sandwiches are awesome!"}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ.  Eat there at least once a week and the service is always excellent. Staff is pleasant and polite. This is a must stop for legit BBQ."}
{"text":"Busy place, but Ragan hooked us up. Even though we got the wrong meal, they gave it to us for free and thanked us for coming. Good BBQ for the value. Could watch the game here with lots of friends at the bar."}
{"text":"Solid BBQ. 
Ordered the brisket platter to go with Mac n cheese and some beans. 
The brisket portion was generous and fall apart yummy. The Mac n cheese was on par, I'd probably try a different side if I go back. The beans should be illegal. They are out of this world! The cornbread could use some love- mine was dry. So get some butter and/or honey. Overall good food, super friendly staff, and quick pickup times."}
{"text":"I got here early for dinner and had the brisket plate the brisket was a big disappointment. It was so dried out it was almost inedible. I had eaten here once before and I didn't have brisket but my friends did. Theirs looked good and moist and they were happy. I don't know why I got some that was so dry. Maybe it was early and they had some left from yesterday. I have had brisket at the Salt Lick, Krause Market, and Blacks BBQ All in Texas and compared to them this was pathetic"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday and they were advertising on a sign out front Happy Hour (Porky Hour) half price appetizers and drink specials.  The pricing for specials was confusing to the point where the staff could only charge certain prices depending on where the hostess seated you in the restaurant.  That was confusing and pretty stupid. 3 star management, but 4 star service.  Our waitress kicked ass.

And of course, 4 stars for the delicious food!  We had the Redneck Tacos, which were a perfect combo, and a meal for one by themselves.  Great big portions!

We split a 4 Meat Platter and it comes with 2 sides and their 3 kinds of BBQ sauce.  The brisket was perfectly cooked medium rare.  The ribs were good but a little overcooked.  The chicken breast was good, but on the dry side.  Sauce made up for that well enough.  Last meat was the pulled pork, same as comes on the Redneck Tacos, which was just perfectly tender and flavorful.  At $20 it was a good deal and we had plenty of leftovers for the next day's lunch.

Porkopolis lived up to its name with its pork.  We'll be returning to this restaurant with the hopes that they work out a few of the start-up kinks.."}
{"text":"I've been trying to get a chance to check this out for a along time, I'm upset I should have been coming here since day one!!   Absolutely amazing food ,  six of us went here last night everyone is a foodie and we were all impressed.. Service was so slow,  restaurant wasn't busy we were there kind of at off peak time.. however totally great menu and portions were giant and the preparation and food was incredible kind of upscale BBQ.  Just real quality made with a lot of consideration for flavor and presentation.  It's a bit pricer than some but well worth the extra .. note the corn bread is soft and just mild but good.. brisket was nice with a little dry and a touch of edge just like I like it, and that meat loaf was awesome it's got some kick!!   Sauces are thick also and really great,  I purchased a jar it's probably gonna go on everything."}
{"text":"Generous & delicious. I'm going vegan the rest of the week to recover & it's only Monday. Jake was quick & attentive. Contemporary/industrial decor, lots of TVs & beers on tap. Pulled pork was juicy, brisket was tender with a nice crust. I like the spicy/smoky sauce. Wanted more baked beans. The serving was just a teasing taste."}
{"text":"A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY. 

My dad and I had talked about check this place out for a while. So I decided to take him there for his birthday dinner tonight. Completely disappointed. I should have listened to the body language of our waitress and went some where else. When we asked what she  recomended she only talked about the pulled pork sandwich, when we asked about the other items on the menu she didn't really have much to say and kinda shied away.

My daughter had the Brady burger and creamed corn. She ate 3 bites and refused to eat the rest. My dad and I picked at it a little but and it had the really weird liquid smoke after taste and it had the texture of a frozen pre-made burger patty. The creamed corn had a weird sweetness to it.

I had the meat combo sandwich with the jalapeño Mac and cheese. The sandwich was alight after I scrapped off the nasty coleslaw. 

My dad got the southern fried chicken sandwich. We've had better at a fast food joint.

This placed is definitely  overpriced for the food that you get. I was checking out menu I was originally  meat platter . 17 bucks for a 2 meat platter... ok that's pretty normal until you see you only get about 3 ounces of each meat. 17 bucks for 6 ounces of not so good meat.  I can't get a 1/2 pound of awesome BBQ for half the price.

Our server never even asked how our meal was I think she could tell that we were not happy campers. Please take your money elsewhere this place is not worth it."}
{"text":"Turkey was amazing. Ribs were stand out fall off the bone. Sweet and Smokey bbq sauce was thick and real tasting, almost like it was cooked in a crock pot. I will return just for the bbq sauce. Green beans were another stand out. They were Smokey and crisp. China was our server and she was wonderful!"}
{"text":"First off what was right. The restaurant itself is clean, well lit and the wait staff was very attentive. 

Then there is the food. We ordered three dishes.

Pulled chicken salad with a side of mashed potatoes. The salad was fine, the chicken was a bit skimpy and the mashed potatoes came out cold. They were sent back and a steaming hot order came out quickly.

Three meat plate of pork ribs, turkey and burnt ends. This was where the disappointment started. In my mind bbq meat is smoked meat with smoked taste and a distinct smoke ring or coloring. None of the three meats had any of this. They all appeared to be oven roasted and covered in bbq sauce. The order came with the wrong sides which was also corrected. The jalapeño slaw was good as was the freshly cooked green beans.

Two meat plate with pulled pork and beef brisket. Again no smoke flavor and thankfully not sauced so we could flavor it with one of the three sauces on the table. Both tasted like they were oven roasted but were tender and lean.

Now I could be way off base here but putting bbq sauce on something doesn't make it \"bbq\". I had high hopes for bbq in North Scottsdale but my search continues."}
{"text":"The combo sandwich is awesome! The bacon barbecue burger is very good. I've been here a few times now and have had a great meal with good service every time."}
{"text":"We weren't impressed. We arrived early for dinner, about 5pm. They seemed really understaffed, the staff were all very nice just way too busy. Our food took a long time to come out (our daughters were starving by that time) and my food was over cooked. My husband ordered a drink and it took about 20 minutes to arrive. The tables were super close so I just kept looking around at the tables filling up and the wait time getting longer. If they were adequately staffed it may have been a better experience, we won't return to find out."}
{"text":"Best bbq in town.  Sunday brunch is a winner.  Great food,  great folks.  Ribs and brisket are to die for.  Bring an appetite."}
{"text":"Judging by the other reviews, I was expecting this place to be pretty awesome. I have  a feeling that none of the people giving it high ratings so far have had good BBQ. 

Honestly, this is probably the most overcooked BBQ I've ever had, with the exception of the brisket, which was tough and clearly undercooked. The ribs were pretty much mush. They couldn't even be picked up. The bones just slid out of the meat. That's called overcooked. Ribs should NOT fall off the bone. The pork was dry and a bit tough. I wouldn't be surprised if they were serving leftovers of that. The chicken was even drier than the pork. There wasn't enough sauce in the building to bring that back to life. 

As far as the sauces go, the sweet & spicy one (whatever it's called) was pretty good. Better than most sauces you'll find elsewhere. The teriyaki was horrendous. That's a flavor that doesn't belong with BBQ in any way, shape, or form. I tried it with each of the meats and none of them went well with it. 

I also wasn't impressed with the overall vibe of the place. It felt dead & the staff seemed less than enthusiastic to be there. 

If you're in the area and they're open, it may be worth a shot if you have no clue what good BBQ is. Otherwise, it's a no-go."}
{"text":"Excellent Barbecue, they have a daily barbecue sandwich lunch special. Delicious ..... a lot of meat ,served nice and hot. Excellent french fries, Friendly service,Recommend, restaurant extremely clean"}
{"text":"I'm always on the hunt for great barbecue, and I found it here! The pulled pork quesadillas are phenomenal and the brisket sandwich is amazing. As much as I love the meat (hehe), it was the side of beans that blew me away. Seriously. The beans. Loved. Them. Great food, great service, lots of food for a reasonable price. Long live Porkopolis!"}
{"text":"We ordered from their catering menu and he sizes to \"feed 8\" we a 3oz portion of creamed corn and a 3oz portion of baked beans. $75 dollars later and I have enough food for 2 people. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"My husband and I wanted to try this place for a long time and after we finally did we couldn't really decide how we felt about the experience. There were some really good things that could've made it a 4 star experience and there were some questionable things that were worth 2 stars so we decided to settle on three.

First, the good things.:) The tacos we got for the appetizer were weirdly awesome. Pulled pork with jalapeno coleslaw on pancakes was a bizarre but tasty combination. The portion was HUGE. It would've been more than enough for an entree for me. 

Pulled pork and brisket were really good. If we go back that's what we'll stick to.

Again, the amount of food you get for the price is obscene.:)) 

Now the questionable things...

The atmosphere was meh, really small place, the waitress looked like she was so behind on everything that she was never going to catch up. 

The guy who sat us down and brought us the food told my husband that he had some other sauce that he recommended we tried and when we said \"sure\" disappeared and never brought us that sauce. 

I think they forgot about my order of blackened catfish because it took a while to get the food and we only got it after they brought our dessert and we said we hadn't had dinner yet.  

The bbq chicken, the turkey and the fish were nothing to rave about. We didn't think they were very good. 

They ran out of apple crisp so we had to go for the ice-cream sandwich (it was part of our 3 course for $40 dinner). 

So probably not the best bbq place in town but not the worst either."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the show. I have been listening since moving here in 2011 and have finally made it to Porkopolis for dinner. We missed the dinner rush and were sat in the bar. Bartender was polite, responsive and knowledgeable about the menu. 
My wife had the salad and at 15 weeks pregnant, there isn't a dish that goes unfinished. (Don't mean to sound like an ass. I love that she's able to eat like she does and stay fit) Such a big portion she was full half way through! I had the three meat entree and my oh my. We learned after our meal that you can get each dish exactly how you like it. Dry ribs, not sauced. Buttered corn bread, instead of dry. Evolving BBQ. Now I get it.
Brady was there and was polite and asked \"what we didn't like\" it was to see him not only greeting tables but working as well. My grandparents owned bar/restaurants and my grandfather was never above bussing a table or washing dishes. People, or I love to see that in an owner. Hats off to these guys for great service, food. 
We will be returning and have finally found our BBQ spot in Arizona."}
{"text":"First clue should have been when we walked in there was only 1 other customer at 5:30pm. Food was absolute garbage. The only thing good was the Pepsi drink. Never ever waste your money on this place."}
{"text":"Amazing! Had the brisket and pulled pork sandwich which is served dirty style with jalapeño slaw. Topped with BBQ sauce too! The jalapeño Mac n cheese was perfect with the right amount of cheese and al dente macaroni. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"First impression-oops I made a mistake! Completely dead and lifeless place. Three people working, they did greet me from across the restaurant, seated me also from across the restaurant then took my order....then they all went back to playing games on their phones! Much smaller place than I thought it was gonna be, three TVs and only two work. 

All that said I ordered the redneck tacos....AMAZING! Completely changed how I felt about the visit. You owe it to yourself to come here and try it, don't let anything else fool you. Brady....start MARKETING!"}
{"text":"I was disappointed with Porkopolis. I ordered burnt ends, and a combo meat sandwich. The burnt ends were ok, too much fat. The sandwich really disappointed me. The bread was way too fancy for a BBQ sandwich. It looked like a fancy hot dog bun. I couldn't taste the meat without taking the sandwich apart. And there wasn't much to taste. There was very small amount of pork and a fatty piece of brisket. The bread tasted great!
I give 2 stars because the service was great, and I liked Brady's sauce."}
{"text":"First off, staff is super friendly.    First time there.

Portions are HUGE (except the baked beans that were dwarfed by the crock of macaroni and cheese)!

I got the 2 meats - brisket and baby back ribs.

The brisket was good, good smoke flavor and was tender.

The ribs were bad -- way too salty for my taste and no matter how much sweet sauce I drenched them in, it was over powering.   I actually stopped for a milkshake on the way home to quench my thirst!   Left half the rib meat.

Too bad but no return visits for me."}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to visit. Sat at the bar (lunch). Kelly took very good care of us. Fast, courteous, service. Tried the 3 meat sampler Split two ways more than enough. Creamy corn and jalapeno coleslaw sides were very good.  Brisket and pulled pork was excellent. Ribs a little dry and over done . . . sauce was excellent. Oh yah , almost forgot . . . fried pickle appetizer was awesome. Moonshine cocktails were creative and tasty. Fun place with a nice atmosphere . . ."}
{"text":"Something has gone terribly wrong at this place. Used to be great. The last three times were absolutely horrible. We arrived at peak dinner time at 6:30pm, and we were literally the only customers in the place from the time we ordered food until we finished eating and left. I guess that should've been our first clue."}
{"text":"Awesome food! They really put on the feed bag! I ordered the pulled pork sandwich and the burnt ends as an appetizer. I took one star off due to the burnt ends. They were super fatty with hardly any solid meat to them. Other than that the service was great and the sandwich was amazing. You gotta try all the sauces that live on the table. The sweet/hot goes great with any of the meats!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner with family on Friday.  I had the pork skillet, husband had the meatloaf, son had the jambalaya and daughter had the nachos (cheese only).  Being family we passed plates for all to try.  My pork like a prior review had a few bites of all fat BUT other than that all very good flavor nothing was over sauced like other BBQ places; service was great very friendly wait staff.
Will go back for sure and happy to see the have a brunch Menue.  The one thing I would change is getting a better draft beer selection...would love to see a selection of AZ beers."}
{"text":"Just tried porkopolis for the first time and was fortunate enough to meet the man himself, Brady! Super friendly and even played with our son. The food and server were really good as well. Had the brisket and it was so tender it was just falling apart. The smokey wings were also delicious! Gotta love when u try a new place and the owners and staff truly appreciate their customers"}
{"text":"Was driving by on a Friday at lunch and noticed this place... Pulled pork Gods started whispering my name.  The service was awsome!  The pulled pork was delicious!  The hot n sweet BBQ sauce was perfect.  Mac n cheese was just okay.  The price was fair and this place struck me as extremely clean which was nice.  Liked the theme and art and music.  I will bring my wife here soon.  Good job Porkoplolis.... Now plant one in east Mesa:)"}
{"text":"Our go to BBQ place! We love the burnt end and the brisket quesadilla! The moonshine is awesome too. 
Wait times are short if there is any wait. Definitely recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"OMG!! Best bbq ever. Love the environment, friendly staff and the food was to die for."}
{"text":"Great bbq place serving pretty good sized portions. Fast service,  good selection. Brisket was spot on fall apart on your fork. Really one of the best I've had in a while. 

Only knock is there are only 2 kinds of sauce, both are sweet. Rice side dish is a little bland."}
{"text":"I tried this place during restaurant week. First, let me say, their restaurant week menu is completely worth it. The 3 meat platter is regularly $22 alone so if you and your date (or just you, no judging) order that for both entrees, the appetizer and dessert are free!! I tried the burnt ends (sauce on the side), jambalaya, 3 meat platter (chicken, pulled pork, and brisket), and the apple waffle. The burnt ends were tasty, slightly dry but overall had a good flavor- the sauce was extremely sweet and smokey. We ended up mixing it with their sriracha sauce to make it appealing. The jambalaya had a good kick to it but the sweet barbecue sauce was a put off for me. As for the 3 meat platter, this thing was huge! The brisket was great! Very tender with good flavor. The pulled pork was also tender but a bit bland. The chicken is a 1/4 bone in chicken- amazing crispy skin!!! I would eat a plateful of just the skin. However, the meat itself was a little dry. For sides, we tried the baked beans and the mashed potatoes. The beans are smokey and spicy in a thicker sauce and the mashed potatoes are creamy with a good amount of garlic and butter flavor to them. 
Now, for the apple waffle..... by this point I had already eaten way more than I should have but we still needed boxes for our leftovers.  I was dreading dessert because I thought I was going to burst. Our server swore that people always finish the waffle and he was right. I put myself into a food coma eating it and I'd do it again in a heartbeat. I didn't even get a picture of it because as soon as we laud eyes on it we immediately devoured it! The waffle is almost churro like in texture- crispy on the outside and soft/chewy on the inside. The apples are sweet with a great caramel and cinnamon flavor. Definitely a great end to the meal.  Service was great and the place was bright and clean. I definitely recommend to try it as part of restaurant week!"}
{"text":"Dropped in on Porkopolis for lunch...my friend and I both ordered lunch plates.
Kinda spendy, for lunch - but would've been perfect, had we split my plate.

I got the two meat plate with burnt ends and pulled pork.

Wow!  Must've been 2+ lbs of meat - they have to be losing money if their portions are always like this!

Burnt ends were pretty good.  Pulled pork was fine.
Wasn't a huge fan of either sauce...sweet and spicy-ish, or sweet and sweet-ish...
Would love to see a vinegar based sauce for the pork (especially a mustard and vinegar based sauce).  

Too expensive for lunch, unless you can take your leftovers home and eat it for two more meals - then it's a pretty good deal!

Server recommended the garlic mashed potatoes (I can't do garlic, my friend said they were good) - I got the creamed corn - more like whipping creamed corn - wow!  Creamiest creamed corn ever...but pretty bland."}
{"text":"Exemplary service from our waiter (also bartender). He was on top of EVERYTHING from drinks to menu questions.

Menu and menu prices you see on here are completely inaccurate. Manager said \"sorry that's just the menu on yelp.\"

Why do yelp users use Yelp ???

However, He did make it right with us by honoring the prices we saw, and the food was great."}
{"text":"About eight of us came here for lunch this past week. It was a group outing to reminisce over a friend who had just passed away. 

Porkopoist was one of his favorite places and we thought this would be a good place to go and remember him. So needless to say, the food is really very good here. We all ordered something different off the menu: brisket, sandwiches, ribs, salads and of course their jalapeño cole slaw. All were wonderful!

I had the Pulled Pork Sandwich. As you can see from the photo I took, this isn't one of those BBQ places that drenches the food with sauce. It was moist and incredibly flavorful. No need to kill the taste with too much sauce!

My tab with taxes and gratuities of 18% included (we were a large group of eight), came to $12. My friend would have loved being there with us. I only wish he was there to enjoy our Irish Wake. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place has AWESOME food!! The wings are some of the best I've had! They're smoked then flash fried. They are big, meaty and full of flavor. The Cuban sandwich is also large and bursting w/flavor(my fave)! The HH is one of the best left in town with all apps half off and awesome drink specials, can't beat it!"}
{"text":"They're breakfast on the weekend is great. I always get the Redneck Benedict."}
{"text":"First time at Porkopolis. Dropped in on a whim at noon on a Monday and there were only five others eating. Uh oh. By the time I left at 12:30, I was the Lone Ranger. 

Very cabin-like decor, with sports channels going on the five TVs. 

I was greeted right away, obviously, and asked for drinks. I ordered an iced tea and a two meat combo, with ribs and brisket, plus jalapeño coke slaw. It all came to$17.01, which was appropriate. 

It all arrived in 3 mins but I was in the restroom when it was delivered. Not good service there. He also never smiled thru his bushy beard. Ever. 

The 3 slices of brisket were good, with good flavor and pull apart texture. The 3 ribs were also good, with sweet, sticky sauce. They were a tad dry but not overmuch. They were fall-off-the-bone, which has never been my fave. I like enough meat to chew a bite. The slaw was okay. I love jalapeños and I love slaw. It wasn't a good marriage tho. I think they need to work on the dressing. 

The service was fine, with the exceptions noted above. 

All in all, not my favorite BBQ (Texas BBQ House) but certainly not my worst experience."}
{"text":"Amazing lunch special! $7 for a huge BBQ pork and brisket sandwich with fries. The BBQ was very tasty and lean with just the right amount of sauce and the fries were thick and crispy. Service was good an on a Tuesday wasn't crowded at all."}
{"text":"The Cubano was ridiculously good and very flavorful. My husband liked the flavor of the burnt brisket tips- except the burnt part. Ha! Sides were ok but nothing amazing. Server was pleasant."}
{"text":"I see some good reviews for this place, so that leads be to believe they might have some consistency problems. Perhaps their 2nd shift cook isn't putting the love into the food that the 1st shift cook does? Who knows. All I know is this. I'm going to rank my grievances with this place in order. 

1. BBQ chicken is not supposed to be unseasoned fried chicken. Most places smoke their chicken then pull it. That seems to be the standard which I have began to expect. I know the menu doesn't say \"pulled chicken\", but when I see chicken on the menu in a BBQ place, I sure don't expect a bland fried chicken leg/thigh combo. 

2. Burnt ends not even edible. A little fat is one thing, but an entire appetizer of burnt ends and ALL of it was fat? Cmon now...That's just lazy. Burnt ends are basically the end piece of a smoked brisket. They are known for being HEAVY on the smoke flavor, while also very tender and flavorful. The burnt ends I got at porkopolis were just pieces of fat cut off of an unseasoned brisket. If anything, it just opened my eyes to how bad the brisket was going to be, because I tasted NO smoke in the burnt ends, which is a really bad thing for BBQ. 

3. The brisket not only lacked seasoning and smoke flavor, it was tough as beef jerky! This was the worst brisket I've ever eaten. Wow...Unseasoned, fatty pieces of brisket that wasn't smoked enough(IF AT ALL) and was tough because it wasn't cooked slow enough. As a brisket lover, this was a sin to me. 

Those 3 things ruined my meal for me. The pulled pork wasn't bad. It was noticeably more smoked, but AGAIN, not seasoned enough. It was bland. 

The BBQ sauce they feature there is actually pretty good in my opinion. Brady's bbq has some good flavor. Too bad it's being wasted on VERY POORLY cooked bbq meats. 

The sides were decent. The cornbread wasn't bad, a little too cakey but had good flavor. The mac and cheese wasn't bad either. The cream corn was something both me and my girlfriend liked a lot, so good job there. The baked beans tasted like hormel chili. We couldn't finish that nor did we take it with us. Finally, the apple crisp with ice cream was tasty. The dessert was by far my favorite part of an otherwise forgettable meal. Honestly I hope they figure this BBQ thing out and fire whoever cooked last night. Find someone who knows how to operate a smoker and season their food please. 

Finally, the service was good. The tall, pretty, blonde girl was very nice. It wasn't her fault!

This place is so close to home. I really hope they get their act together so we can try them again."}
{"text":"I came here for Restaurant Week. The service I received was great. The appetizer were rib tips and they were delicious. We got a 3 meat sampler and the jambalaya. Both were delicious, although I have never had jambalaya, I think this place set the bar for me. It's a nice little restaurant. Has a small bar and some televisions. The server we had was also the bartender and he was very friendly and informative."}
{"text":"The last time we were here, the food was outstanding, tasty, spicy and juicy and the staff was quite friendly.  The staff is still friendly, but the food changed big time and it has not been that long.  This time we ordered two separate meals with different ingredients so that we could sample more items (and have leftovers).  I loved the jalepeno mac and cheese the first time, had a great flavor and zing, this time, I couldn't find the jalepeno's.  No zing.  Same with the cole slaw, where were the jalepeno's and flavor that it had the last time.  The dirty rice tasted like it came out of a box.  It tasted like chicken flavored rice from a box.  The garlic mashed potatoes seemed to be missing the garlic tonight.  Finally the meats were ok, but not as juicy and tasty as before.  The turkey tasted like deli turkey rather than BBQ turkey.  Not a big fan of deli turkey so was quite disappointed in that. Brisket was tasty, a little dry, but with the BBQ tasted better.  I hope these changes are not permanent."}
{"text":"took the family here and we loved it!  the food and service were great! our food went like this:
*redneck tacos....cornbread fritter-like topped with bbq pork and jalapeno slaw.  freaking amazing!!!!
*ribs....couldn't eat with your hands because the meat literally fell off the bone....best i have ever had.
*brisket.....super tender and full of flavor.  we wanted to order more to take home.
*bbq chicken......just plain greatness!
*mac n cheese.....i'm only assuming it was really good.  when i went to try it my son had already killed his whole plate.
*full bar........always a bonus.

anyways, we will definitely go back again and hopefully very soon. 

oh yeah...the bbq sauce ruled!"}
{"text":"Four stars for our server Rory. Two very large parties came in right after us, pretty much creating a standing room only situation in the bar/restaurant.  Rory somehow continued to make sure my husband and I were taken care of.  

First: I would not classify this as a restaurant, it is clearly a bar.  Nothing wrong with a bar, love a good bar or a good dive, depending on the situation and mood.  

Second: Hands down one of the worst meals my husband and I have had the misfortune to eat.  We each had a 2 meat platter that was quite small for the price.  I had smoked turkey and ribs, with garlic mashed potatoes and jalapeno slaw.  My husband had the brisket and ribs, with jalapeno mac and cheese and slaw.  ALL the meats were extremely dry small portions and were much more like jerky than a delectable smoked meat.  The seasoning and smoke, were distinctly missing and there was no evidence of a smoke ring.  The garlic mashed potatoes may have had a clove of garlic waved over them at some point, but you couldn't prove it by me.  They were also extremely dry.  The jalapeno mac and cheese was missing the cheese.  The pasta was covered with some kind of watery, weird tasting, non creamy, non cheesy sauce.  There was zero \"kick\" to it.  The portion was fairly generous, but big deal, it was terrible.  The best part of our meal was the slaw and it was average, at best.

After having this on our \"must try\" list for quite some time, it was an epic disappoint.  Needless to say, we won't be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit here and won't be my last.  We went during the beginning of happy hour and had their Ole Smokey drinks (half price during happy hour).  They were excellent!  So good that had a second one.  The server was well-versed on the menu and gave suggestions.  The food was excellent.  The BBQ pork was served on a soft brioche bun.  The coleslaw has a bit of a kick, just the right amount of kick."}
{"text":"Prokopolis is one of best Barbecue places around and certainly The Valley has a bunch to choose from. 

There's Famous Dave's, Dickie's, Lucille's, Naked BBQ, Ono Hawaiian and of course, a bunch of really good K-BBQ places, including California transplant GEN BBQ. So we are not at a loss for good grilled meats here, that's for sure. 

I've been a fan of Porkopolis Chandler for a while now and was genuinely excited when they opened this location. 

First you should know, that Porkopolis puts a ton of food on your plate. It's $18 for a two meat platter, $22 for three and $26 for four, with each meat being four ounces or more, plus two sides. Wow

We ordered the two meat platter of Brisket and Pulled Pork. Excellent. The Brisket had nice ring marks and was moist and flavorful. I ordered the Cuban Sandwich and it too had a bunch of great flavor that did not disappoint. See photos. 

Our bill came to $49.93, including drinks and extras, like Fried Pickles, but before gratuities. We had a great time, our server Dimas was prompt and very friendly too. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Let me first start off by saying I am not the biggest fan of BBQ, but my family is. This place  offers a nice variety on the menu including some burgers and meatloaf. They also have a decent tap beer selection. I think they tend to be a bit heavy handed with the salt salt and the rest of my family thought so too. 
The service here is great. They are fast and attentive, but not not pesty. Lastly, the prices are reasonable and a pretty solid choice."}
{"text":"I'm not a morning person or night person. I am a food person. if you can't guess, the ways to my heart: buy me food, make me food, be food. And it helps if you are really really good BBQ. I stumbled on this heaven on earth at the Great American Beer and BBQ festival. It is also where you can meet Brady in person or otherwise listen to him on your daily commute.

Porkopolis is a fave lunch spot because it's a jaunt from my office. There's plenty of seating at the tables for a big group or you can casually hang at the bar. ALWAYS go for lunch because the daily specials rotate at a measly $7 with generous portions that could be split if you are a sharing kind of person. Outside of that, I would eat everything on the menu. Definitely go for the burnt ends, pulled pork, beef brisket, and the mac and cheese. I like my BBQ naked but there's a slew of sauces to tantalize your tastebuds. Service is always outstanding, but what do you expect? Who wouldn't be happy when the smell of BBQ is in the air??!!???!! I would eat here every day. In fact, some weeks I check in at least 3 times. If you can't get to Kansas City or Texas, come to Porkopolis. It's one way to cut carbs. It won't take you 6 hours to cook it, but only 3 seconds to eat it."}
{"text":"I always loved Brady's BBQ sauce, so I was excited to try his restaurant and I was not disappointed! I have had many, many pulled pork sandwiches and it is the first thing I try at all barbecue joints. I have to say this sandwich was heaven on a bun. The pork is perfect - not too moist, not too dry, with a nice bark on it. The sauce is wonderful - the perfect mix of tangy, sweet and smoky. But the piece de resistance is the bun - it's a brioche bun that they toast perfectly so every bite has a amazing crunch to it.  I think I'll be dreaming about this sandwich...
I tried my husband's brisket and it was great too (although I have to say I still think the best brisket I have ever had is a friend of mine's who does competitions) - moist with a nice bark (if you can't tell, I love bark on my barbecued meats) and very lean. 
The beans were also fantastic - really spicy, which I love. But if you like your food mild, you might want to pass. The mac n' cheese is also very nice and creamy with a little sharpness to the cheese.
The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is the burnt ends weren't quite as burnt and as full of bark as I like them, but I am an enthusiastic love of lots of bark as I have already mentioned. I think I will try the redneck tacos next time if we want an appetizer. 
We were too full for dessert, but someone at the next table got some amazing looking chocolate chip cookies that came with a glass of milk that almost changed my mind. Maybe next time... and there will definitely be a next time!"}
{"text":"You know, I just was not impressed at all with this place. It was our 14th wedding anniversary, and traditionally we'll just go out and have a nice meal somewhere. This time we both felt like BBQ and almost decided on Pork on a Fork, but then I noticed this place on Yelp and we decided to drive here with plans to head a little further south to Sprinkles for dessert cupcakes after.

Came in and the place was completely empty at prime dinnertime, which is usually a bad sign. Still, the inside smelled pretty good. I got the Cincinnati Skillet with burnt ends ($18) , the wife got a two meat selection and the kid got the kid's mac and cheese.

The good:
- Burnt ends tasted pretty good, although they were a tiny bit on the fatty side - I don't mind that.
- Wife got served more meat than she was expecting. BBQ meat, guys. Come on.
- Pork crackling was really good.

Now for the bad:
- Kid frowned and pushed his mac and cheese away saying it was too hot. Chile hot, not temperature. We checked and saw green bits in the cheese sauce - jalapeno. Now, one of the wife's sides was jalapeno cheddar mac and cheese, and that's apparently what the kid got as well. I asked the server if that was normal. She said yes. I'm like, KID'S mac has jalapeno in it? Anyway, he ate some of my burnt ends, of which there wasn't much, and all of our cornbread so he was fine.
- my skillet was SMALL. For $18 I would have expected PLENTY more food than I actually got. The skillet was about an inch deep and five across, with a couple oz of burnt ends, drowned in coleslaw, with some beans. Pic here: https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/porkopolis-scottsdale?select=eexH9J7VbjZyuR4rxyyAsg&userid=RaNkWBMywhBqCZOQWSN_SQ
- The menu advertised that it is served with \"roasted potatoes\". Nope. It's served with FRENCH FRIES. Not exactly the same thing. Baked beans, then fries, then burnt ends, then coleslaw, basically a dog's breakfast. I can't say it tasted horrible, but it's not a smart serving concept and it was NOT value for money.
- I got a side of dirty rice. It wasn't dirty rice. Basically dry long grain rice with a little onion and red pepper. Absolutely no pepper or detectable seasoning/spices. You look up just about ANY picture of dirty rice on the net and you'll see something completely different. Pic here: https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/porkopolis-scottsdale?select=mCHZWfdcLn96AtGb61T0EQ&userid=RaNkWBMywhBqCZOQWSN_SQ
- Pork crackling dipping sauce was runny ranch. Completely unnecessary. A thicker, tastier dipping sauce would have been better. I was fine to eat them on their own.

They took the kid's meal off the bill which was appreciated. He got more than enough cupcake and froyo to fill in the missing space about ten minutes later. Can't say I'm inclined to return, next time I need a BBQ fix I'll definitely be hitting up Pork on a Fork instead. They get 2 stars instead of 1 because the server was pretty attentive. (Then again, that could have been because the place remained empty the whole time we were there except for a couple of take-outs)."}
{"text":"The burnt ends we ordered as an appetizer were pretty good. Some pieces were a bit dried out but I am sure they're hard to keep moist. Each of the BBQ sauces were alright. The sauce on the actual burnt ends didn't have much to it. It could've use some spices, salt and vinegar. The \"hot and sweet\" had zero kick to it and needed more acid as did the \"sweet and smoky.\" The Jalapeno coleslaw completely lacked salt and vinegar and again had no kick to it. The beans were also under seasoned. The Porkopolis Chef Salad was good but it again lacked seasoning as did the ranch dressing. They definitely know how to BBQ here! But basically everything was just under seasoned. This place could be so good! Keep it up"}
{"text":"I'll be completely honest, I ate here because I was in the area and have been hearing about it on the radio for years. I was 100 percent expecting to be disappointed, as one generally is with BBQ places in AZ. I had a fairly witty yet scathing review half written in my head before I walked through the door. 

I ordered burnt ends and a side of beans, because what better way to judge. They were very heavily seasoned and overcooked. You know, the way burnt ends should be. Great flavor. The sauces were a little sweet for my taste, but good. The only real ding I can give is the beans. They were more chili beans than the bbq beans I want from a bbq place. That said, they were also good. A little pricey at $3 for about a 3oz side though. 

It's probably not good enough that I will drive across the valley to eat here, but it'd definitely worth stopping at when I'm in the area. Well, might have to drive here once, I think the sweet and smokey sauce is right in my wife's wheelhouse and she loves her some pulled pork."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing. Was excited to try this place after seeing it on the travel channel. Ordered the smoked wings to start. Only offered 2 sauces to choose from and they both tasted the same, BLAND. My wife ordered the 3 Meat combo,  brisket dry and burnt, chicken dry and no flavor or sauce, ribs were dry,old are basically disgusting. It came with a baked beans side that consisted of 4-5 beans and red chili sauce that can be found in any burrito spot in the valley. I ordered the 2 meat combo sandwich,which the waiter said was the best thing on the menu, which consisted of pulled pork and brisket. I couldn't tell the 2 meats apart because they tasted flavorless. The sauces on the table were not any good either. I ate a few bites and pushed the plate away. The waiter was attentive but never asked how our food was. He must have seen the look of disgust on our faces and wanted to avoid the confrontation. Don't waste your time or money at this place."}
{"text":"Stopped in while on my way to a job site for the $5 lunch special. I was thinking it was going to be a light lunch (which I prefer) but I was surprised. It was a feast and I ate it all of course. The sauce is amazing and the fries are awesome. I definitely recommend Porkopolis for any meal! Service was prompt and friendly.

You guys put me into a food coma!"}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ and the portions are big enough to share! The brisket was nice and smoky! BBQ sauces are put on the tables so you can add the right amount of sauce! I drive 45 min away just to come have the best BBQ in town"}
{"text":"This is a complete middle of the road BBQ place.  For every good thing there is a not so good thing.  I really wanted to like this place just on the fantastic name, but there were too many things that were lacking to take this place over the top.  There was always a but...
So let us list the positives first:
1) The fried Gumbo is a fun and tasty Appetizer, but its a BBQ lace so who cares?
2) The service was good and friendly
3) When I opened the door I smelled the smoke (always a good sign)
4) 2,3,4 Meat combo platters say it is 3oz of each, but it was easily 5 to 6 oz of each meat.  I got the four meat to try as many kinds as I could and got 3 meals out of it.
5) The meat was all tender and moist, the ribs fell off the bone

But...
1) While the meats were tender and moist, the most smoke I got was the smell at the door.  The meat did not have that distinct smoke flavor you want in BBQ.
2) The Jalapeno cole slaw had no flavor of Jalapeno and no heat
3) What is a BBQ place with no hot links or smoked sausage?
4) It is more about the meat, but their BBQ sauce was overly sweet, even the hot & Sweet was more sweet than hot.

Not a swing and a miss, but a lot of foul tips.  Just not the place to wow you.  It was a lot of food, but just average so not exactly a Meh, but I will keep looking for my new BBQ home."}
{"text":"Came in with my family for a late Saturday lunch before church and we loved the food. The portions were giant, the food was fresh and delicious and service was great. Our appetizer, the BBQ nachos, have freshly made potato chips that I would love to eat just by themselves. I left so food drunk that I had a tough time staying awake in church."}
{"text":"I had a co-worker mention that this is their family's favorite place, since we live just up the road I thought \"awesome.\" *sigh*  My husband ran down there to grab take out and was immediately struck by the decor, which was fairly upscale... for it's business, it's location... for BBQ, and to top it off had a misogynistic poster of \"how bbq is made\".  I understand it is a joke, but is that the right place for that joke?  Maybe it would be better served on their Facebook wall instead of their dinning room wall.  In his t-shirt and shorts he felt a bit scrubby being in there and chose to wait for the food outside. 

Pretension aside, the BBQ wasn't great.  We got the burnt ends which were very tasty and the best item we got, but also extraordinarily fatty and not a great value at $11.  The pulled pork was the best of the meats.  We also sampled the chicken (lovely and smoky but dry), brisket (worst, by far the worst brisket I've ever had in fact, dry, fatty and tough), and the ribs (also dry and tough).  From the other reviews it sounds like we should have gotten the mac & cheese but instead we got the beans which were oddly chili beans and not BBQ beans, and the chips.  My chips were well cooked and seasoned but half of my son's order were soft and half-raw. The pulled pork was tender, but pulled pork is forgiving and we weren't impressed.  Their rub is fairly spicy and we all felt the heat detracted from the experience.  I'm all for spicy BBQ, but I think it should be in the sauce so you can adjust it.  We couldn't do anything about it being cooked into the meat that way. 

Overall I expect we will not be back to Porkoplis despite the convenient location.  We've got too many great locations like Joe's, Rudy's, and Famous Dave's even, that are worth driving a little further for."}
{"text":"I wanted to get take out and knew nothing about this place. We go to Sam's Club all the time. It took a few minutes for someone to acknowledge me. Then the most friendly, pleasant woman (a sunny redhead) changed the whole experience. She guided me through the menu, made recommendations and personally brought me what I ordered, very quickly. 
The food was good. I got the chicken Caesar salad (fair), and tried each of the smoked meats. Ribs were a bit salty but tender. The brisket was a bit bland and soft but in the BBQ sauce, great to eat. The pulled pork was average but the best part was the turkey and chicken. That turkey was so moist and tender, I could eat it all day! Overall, the BBQ sauce was so tasty and I'd gladly buy a bottle. 
The only dud was the baked beans. Tasted like chili beans. 
We will go back to eat in the restaurant to try more of the foods."}
{"text":"The pulled pork, the briskit, and the coleslaw were all amazing! By far the best BBQ joint in the valley! I only wish that they sold air fresheners that smelt like the inside of this resteraunt!"}
{"text":"I came here by word-of-mouth, I heard that this was an amazing place to eat barbecue. I had heard about it a bunch on the radio so I was pretty excited! I had taken a late lunch so I was starving by the time I arrived. The Staff was okay. I was greeted by the waiter when I came. I sat at the bar and she handed me a menu. I waited a few  minutes for the bartender, but it wasn't too bad. I ordered the 3 meat dinner (pulled pork, brisket, and ribs). Brisket was good and well seasoned, a little fatty but the way I like it. Pulled pork and ribs were at least a day or two old reheated. The ribs I only ate 1 bone of and the pork I just slathered in sauce because I had limited time. Mac and Cheese was okay, but nothing great. The bartender wasn't engaging at all but took my order and payment promptly and said bye when I left. I wish this was good but you can never trust a BBQ place that reheats their food that much. I love Brady's sauce though!"}
{"text":"We decided to try Porkopolis after hearing about it on KUPD-- Brady Bogen from Holmberg's Morning Sickness is the owner. The food was absolutely delicious. We had the burnt ends, pork ribs, a 2-meat chicken and brisket platter, a brisket sandwich, and a brisket quesadilla. The four of us each had a little bit of each other's dishes. The burnt ends were a little bit fatty, but they were moist and delicious. I normally don't like pork ribs much, but these were great-- they didn't have that gamey taste that pork sometimes has, and they didn't have too much fat. The brisket was out of this world. We did not have dry, tough brisket like some people are saying they had in their reviews. It was moist, tender, and perfect. The brisket quesadilla was by far the best thing I tried-- I ordered it as my entree even though it's an appetizer, and it was more than enough food for one person. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I think people who give this place a good review are just in love with local \"celebrity\" Brady. I eat bbq at several local places, all of which are better by far. I had the brisket sandwich. Clearly roasted, NOT smoked. the texture was tough and the intermuscular fat had not broken down/melted. It was quite tough, and the fat was like gristle. The meat did not seem to have any seasoning other than being covered in bbq sauce. My friend and I had burnt ends also. THESE WERE NOT BURNT ENDS. Burnt ends are smoked with the brisket, then usually smoked again after being cut off. These were clearly cut-offs of meat AND mostly fat that were braised in something, then drenched in bbq sauce after the fact. I also had the cole slaw: no taste. YUCK. I will not be going back. if this place is still open in a year, I will be surprised. BRADY: don't quit your day job! I love you on the radio!"}
{"text":"Great food, great staff, great atmosphere. Me and my wife have come here 3 or 4 times and have had pleasant experiences each time. Sometimes we like to come here for the half off appetizers which is 3-630 on weekend I think. They also have really good BBQ. You can get one of the BBQ platters with an appetizer and split with someone else. Looking toward to my next visit."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Porkopolis twice now and will probably never be back. I want to like this place, but it just isn't good BBQ. I ordered the meat platter with brisket, pulled pork, Mac and cheese, and corn bread.

Service- 4 stars. Sodas were refilled often and food came out fast because smoked meat is usually prepared. 

Brisket- 3 stars. Portion was large. The brisket was not overly dry, but did not offer much flavor and really no smoky BBQ flavor at all. Does not seem to be fresh and smoked on-site 

Pulled Pork- 2 stars. Very disappointing considering the name Porkopolis. No smoky flavor, dry, and seemed to be at least a day old. Edible, but not something I would ever order again. 

Sides- 3 stars. Corn bread was good. Jalapeño Mac and Cheese was very thin/watery and had hardly any jalapeño flavor.

They seem to have a good happy hour with half price beers and some cheap appetizers, but not even close to a top notch BBQ. The restaurant was nearly empty on a Friday at 6 (during happy hour) which tells you all you need to know. If you are looking for some good BBQ brisket or pulled pork this is not the place. Portions are huge which make the price fine, but the meat just isn't anything special. Famous Dave's brisket on a not so good night taste better than Porkopolis."}
{"text":"Nachos, wings, French dip, burnt tips, Mac & Cheese, and cream of corn is what we ordered. The nachos looked good but it was too salty even with the BBQ sauce. Wings were mediocre, French dip wasn't tender like other French dips I've had. It does the job if you're starving. The burnt tips had too much grease - we literally poured it out onto a separate plate. The meat was tough and the fat was probably the best part of the taste. Cream of corn was too watery and hardly any corn in it. The Mac and cheese tastes like Kraft. The best part of our visit was our server/bartender. He was friendly, great sense of humor, attentive, and on top of it. So kudos to him! He gets our 5 stars :)"}
{"text":"Def check this place out! Great BBQ and excellent service!! 

We had a chance to talk to the manager and he was super nice. I really hope this place does well because it was delicious! 

My boyfriend and I split a three meat plate. We got pulled pork, brisket, and chicken. The sauce is literally amazing - it's sweet and smiley. They have a hot sauce and an Asian sauce as well, but the smokey one is a showstopper. 

It's a fun, rock n roll atmosphere. Don't miss this place"}
{"text":"porkolicious i say i had the briscuit frenc dip oh man im heading back soon"}
{"text":"Great meats, not dry and juicy. Wait staff very attentive and friendly!"}
{"text":"Decent BBQ for Scottsdale although I don't know why that is always the excuse. Had the brisket which was dry and cold and the turkey which was just ok. Jalapeño coleslaw needs some work. Very expensive for portion size and $1 up charges for more than a few things. Best thing about this place is the dining room and bar...they spared no excuse for that."}
{"text":"Anytime a place does smoked meat and brisket they get an automatic 3 stars and we'll take it from there. I had a 3 meat plate- brisket, pulled pork, and baby back ribs. We also had the brisket salad and a side of burnt ends. The brisket had a very thin smoke ring and was somewhat dry. No bark at all. Smoke flavor was hard to find because it was overpowered by salt. Salt permeated every inch of the brisket. The pulled pork was a bit dry and also had a lot of salt. Salt and sweet, but not in a luscious way, was the dominant feature on the burnt ends. They also had too much solid fat, not the soft, melted fat that defines a brisket that has had the fat and collagen fully rendered. The brisket salad didn't work for me, partly because I'm not a vinegar guy and the dominant flavor was from the vinaigrette dressing. Blue cheese was in the salad, along with pecans and strawberries. The blue cheese really overpowers the salad and in my opinion would be better replaced by a small amount of mild goat cheese, or removed entirely, because the brisket can't really show itself with such bold flavored cheese. The baby back ribs were good. Moist and perfectly cooked. Conclusion: If they back off the salt and replace it with more black pepper, along with adding more moisture to their smoker, then their products will shine, I'm sure. I might add that I think the service is good, and that portions are good. It m surprised to hear previous reviews complain about high prices. I think the prices are good. BBQ is an expensive item to produce."}
{"text":"High priced glorified menu. Tried this place while vacationing on April 3rd, a Monday afternoon. The host and waitress had bad attitudes, unfriendly to say the least. 3 other people dining when we were there for lunch. Food was poor. For $35 for a burger & fries, meatloaf & mashed potatoes. Should have gone to Jack in the Box. I'm sure the employees would have appreciated us as customers and the food would have been better. That was our experience there."}
{"text":"I had fried pickles, the meat platter, and a peach moonshine drink. The fried pickles were average. The meat platter (brisket, turkey, coleslaw, and mashed potatoes) was below average...how do you mess up mashed potatoes? 

The drink was excellent. Service was excellent! If I came here again, it would be because someone is holding me hostage and forcing me to. Even then, I would just have drinks."}
{"text":"Hubby and I had dinner recently and really enjoyed the 3 Meat Platter. Ordered Red-Neck Tacos as a \"starter\" and they were delish. Corn cakes with tender pork and jalapeño coleslaw on top. I ordered pulled pork, chicken and wonderful ribs with some of their Hot & Yaki sauce on the side. The food was cooked to perfection and so was the service we received from Kelli. Very friendly and efficient. The restaurant was clean too. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This may have been my first time here but it definitely won't be my last. 

Had the BBQ nachos (substituted brisket for chicken) and it was amazing. Great atmosphere and great service as well."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner we ordered Brady burgers , brisket sandwich, red neck tacos and the smoked meat loaf all four items were outstanding as was the service thank you for a pleasurable evening we will definitely be back the staff was exceptionally nice and very personable."}
{"text":"Great BBQ Joint! Met a couple of friends for lunch, but wanted a casual place where we could hear each other talk and have a great lunch.  Porkopolis was the perfect place. From the Brisket to Pulled Pork to the Jalepeno Cole Slaw, everything was great. We'll be back soon. . ."}
{"text":"Fell short this time. Got the burnt end. Almost like jerky. The chips were room temp if not cold. Hesitate on a return."}
{"text":"Outstanding BBQ...especially the Hot & Yaki sauce.  You have to try the Red Neck 
Tacos and the BBQ Salmon is excellent.  Also, ask for the \"Apple Pie\" before you eat.  It's special label bootleg-style whisky, but it tastes exactly like home-made apple pie. If you have watched the show Justified on season 2, you can try the real stuff.  Great food and excellent staff!"}
{"text":"1st visit: 
Delicious BBQ grill & BBQ sauce. Ribs, pulled pork are all good. 
Surprisingly good if not better is their Grilled Long Green Beans! Complimented w BBQ dishes very well. We ordered extra Grilled Long Green Beans because it is so good. Should give it a try ;)"}
{"text":"Excellent brisket and pulled pork. Big portions. The staff is very friendly. A definite repeat in our circle of restaurants."}
{"text":"Been here twice and not sure why i waited so long after the first visit to go again.  Food is amazing.  Sincerely fantastic 
 Service is great.  Brady did a great job here. Can't wait to go back and try more items."}
{"text":"Today I went to this place for the first time. It is simply AWESOME. I have never  had such good bbq as I had here this evening. I had the 3 sampler dish, brisket, ribs and pork bbq. It was so tender, so tasty.. Just out of this world GOOD.. My sides were garlic mashed potatoes and the dirty rice..Everything was just excellent. The server was great as well!!!"}
{"text":"Burnt ends just okay, barbeque sauce pretty good, quesadilla bland, pulled pork sandwich was just okay.  The meat was super fatty, even for barbeque.  The fries have too much powder on them and taste like barbeque lays potato chips.  Service was just okay saw employees lounging near counter where food comes out with the paper or ipad or kindle or whatever brand, \"chef\" made table visits twice, but was to the same table.  Took my husband there for his bday and mentioned it twice before he got there and once again after he got there and not even a happy birthday and guess they don't do anything for bdays.
WHAT THE HELL KIND OF BBQ PLACE DOESNT HAVE FRESH BREWED TEA?  Shameful!  And no potato salad.

AND...both of us ended up sick for a cpl days after eating here. We won't be back and tell everyone we know not to go there. Disappointing because the hubby kept talking about it wanting to go there for a while since he listens to the DJ that owns."}
{"text":"Porkopolis is a fun little casual BBQ Restaurant. When you walk in there is a tasty aroma of BBQing meat. They were kind to offer a killer deal for restaurant week so we gave them a try. We started with the Brisket Burnt Ends. WOW they gave us a really big portion! (this was enough for four people) The ends were crispy and really super succulent. They were a little too sweet for me but then I used their really tasty Porkopolis Sriracha BBQ sauce on them and it made them really yummy.

I almost had a Heart Attack when I received my ENORMOUS 3 meat plate. (1/4 chicken, Turkey and Brisket) I'd say it was enough food to feed 3-4 people. I don't know if it's always this big or if they gave me extra. My favorites of the meat I tried was the 1/4 chicken. It was a good smokey and was tasty and juicy. The Brisket had a nice crust on it and was extra succulent. For my taste the Turkey ran dry but my husband who eats more BBQ than me said Turkey is usually like that at most BBQ places. I wasn't big on the sides..

My husband enjoyed the pork the most on his plate. He liked the cornbread. Said beans were ok but a small portion compared to the enormous portions everything else was.

We had lots of stuff packed up and then they brought out a fresh hot waffle with apples, caramel and ice cream. 

Our server was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Amazing portion sizes. I got the two meat two side plate and it was enough food for myself and two kids with left overs. The Mac and cheese was soooo cheesy too, great for kids. The pork brisket and the smoked chicken were some of the best I have had. I would say the chicken was a little dry but the sauces were such a good pairing I hardly noticed. My SO got the beef brisket and we both agreed the pork brisket had a better flavor but neither option would be a bad pick. 
Also very friendly staff and fast service."}
{"text":"Nope, good friendly service, but what I received was so dry and flavorless that it was physically difficult to swallow. Sorry Brady, love the morning show, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"I love the apple pie moonshine and the redneck tacos! Super good!"}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time during AZrestaurant week, it was delish; so we brought my parents back when they were in town next and the food was great.  Much like any BBQ, it's pretty filling so we tend to split an appetizer & main dish (I'm a light eater).
The burnt ends were yummy!  Mac & cheese was ehh, I've had better (lacked flavor)."}
{"text":"My friends went here for date night, and brought me an order to-go.  He really enjoyed his steak.  She said the fried pickles were not crispy and were made with poor quality pickles, the ribs were pretty good, the pulled pork was tender but dry, the garlic mashed potatoes were okay, and the creamed corn was delicious.  She said overall it was mediocre and she won't go back. 

My order was the beef brisket sandwich with macaroni and cheese.  It did not look like the one in the picture on their website (on a different type/shape of bun), and did not come with au jus to dip it in.  The meat was tender but very bland and dry.  The macaroni and cheese was so spicy that I could not eat more than one bite, all I tasted was jalapeño.  The menu did not mention that it would be spicy.  It was very disappointing.  I would not recommend this place at all."}
{"text":"Took a vacay to Arizona recently with the boyfriend for our anniversary. He was craving some BBQ while we were there so we decided to stop at Porkopolis, plus it was restaurant week and decided to take advantage of their 3 course meal menu for $44 a couple! Great deal right!? Well let me tell you...the service was really bad! I mean it was Memorial Day weekend and it was pretty packed and they only had 2 servers throughout the whole restaurant but still no excuses. It took a long time for a server to take our orders and then hand us water. I literally had to flag them down by raising my hand multiple times. 

Now onto the food! The food portions was great for $44! For starters we had the Pork Rinds which were good but nothing special. For our main entree, the boyfriend had the 3 meat platter while I had the Big Kahuna Porkloin. My Porkloin was amazing and I finished the whole thing because I'm a fatty! And the boyfriend said his food was good also but he honestly told me that he had better. Which was true! I tasted pieces of his food and I have great love for brisket but when I took a bite of his brisket..it did not leave a good impression in my mouth. Maybe they cook it differently in Arizona but in California where I'm from, the briskets I had over here are moist, tender and easily tear. For dessert, we ended up getting the Sweet Potato Pancake Stack with Vanilla Ice Cream to share and OMG IT WAS THE BOMB! I'm still craving for another stack till this day! Oh and I forgot to mention about their Moonshine Cocktails. I decided to order their Redneck Kool-Aid which brought me back to my childhood days drinking lots of Kool-Aid during the summer, without the Moonshine of course! The drink was refreshing and great for the Arizona heat!

Overall the service sucked but the boyfriend gave a generous tip anyways and the food was ok which in turn I gave 3 stars on this yelp review."}
{"text":"Ordered some food for takeout to try this place. They didn't get my order right (gave me fries instead of slaw) but it wasn't the end of the world. The meat is super tender and the brisket and beans were definitely the star of the show.  The pork was melt in your mouth but not a ton of flavor. Mostly I disliked the BBQ sauce itself- strangest BBQ I've ever tasted- not quite sweet and not quite tangy, it was a bland mashup of both styles. Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Ordered carryout. Got the brisket sandwich and fries, with a side of sweet and smokey wings. Amazing. Best BBQ in Chandler for the price."}
{"text":"Porkopolis was a stop on a food crawl done for my friends' 40th birthday.  The owner and his team were really awesome to work with to get everything setup, they blocked out a private space for us next to their well appointed bar, and had a great beer selection to go with the great meat.  Our group loved the turkey and the brisket, we had several sampling platters.  High quality food and great service here.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Burnt ends!!!! Burnt ends!!! Burnt ends!!!! I mean I don't know what else to say. These melt in your mouth and are  full of flavor.  If you haven't tried these yet, get to Pokopolis asap!!!  It really is a good thing that I have to drive 45+ minutes to get here otherwise I would be here all the time and probably have a heart attack! Lol"}
{"text":"We love this place! Have been there several times, but this review reflects our latest visit. We have never had a bad experience, so it's nice that's it's consistent. 

This is why you should try this place:

1) Amazing food with huge portions and reasonable prices. Our favorite items are the jumbalaya and the burnt ends (yummy)!  Order was correct!

2) Fast and friendly service.

3) Good atmosphere.

4) Didn't have to wait to pay! That's one of my peeves that I encounter frequently (waiting for your check and/or for them to take your payment)."}
{"text":"Meh, service is good sauces were not my favorite, think I'll stick with Dickeys or Toms"}
{"text":"I liked everything about this place. Brady came up to our table and was super friendly. My date loves the HMS radio show he is on. So he was excited to come try it as Brady talked about it on the radio. I live near it and have wanted to try it too. I got the BBQ Burger which was great! My date got the 3 meat meal. He said he enjoyed it very much. The two sides he got were Mac N Cheese and Fried Polenta Cakes.......both were fantastic. We both plan to go back. I wanna try the Red Neck tacos next time!"}
{"text":"We were in a bit of a hurry and it was our first time so we will definitely be back. The service was great, Jordan was our server and he made it happen. Helped us decide what to order based on his favorites and we enjoyed everything. Try to moonshine cocktails! Half price cocktails & beer during happy hour and includes appetizers. Great prices and we had a good time while we were there."}
{"text":"Fried pickles were yummy! I was impressed with the presentation of the food on the plate. I don't think I've ever had a prettier plate of BBQ. The salmon was cooked perfectly; however, the BBQ sauce on the salmon is definitely a little on the spicy side-- almost too spicy to the point it almost overpowers the salmon. If you're sensitive to spicy foods, I would not recommend the salmon dish. If you love spicy foods, you'll probably love the salmon. Also, this place opens at 3:30pm, so this place is more for dinner or a really late lunch. Bring your appetite, though. They serve a lot of food!"}
{"text":"Been hearing about this place for a while.  Finally got to show up.

So, as I always do in a new place, I get the pulled pork.  That is my measurement standard for BBQ places.  My wife got a platter that had pork and brisket.  So \"how was it?\" you ask...

My sandwich was pretty good.  The pork was very tender (as it should be), and the sauce was OK.  I would have liked a bit more of a smoke to the meat, maybe a bit more rub too.  But it was pretty good.  My wife's brisket was fall-apart tender, but again needed a bit more smoke and rub flavor.  To their credit they go light on the sauce.  You want to add to the flavor of the meat, but not cover it up.  They were successful there as I could taste the meat very clearly.  Which is how I know it needed a better rub and some more smoke.

I got beans as my side.  The quantity was a joke.  Seriously.  Not much bigger than a shot glass.  Maybe two regular shot glasses.  And that's it.  Why even bother?  I also got to try their french fries.  Lightly seasoned, but heavily salted.  Too much salt (and I LIKE salt!).  The dirty rice was very nice (I got to sample that also).

So Joe's Real BBQ has nothing to worry about.  They stomp this place into the ground.  Dave's also beats them (by a bit in terms of flavor, but by a LOT in portion size).  And Rudy's is probably better too.  So I don't really have any reason to come here.  They are \"pretty good\", but nothing to get excited about.  There are several better choices in the east valley that I could go to first."}
{"text":"Loved everything we tried smoked turkey, brisket, chicken, pulled pork ribs amazing. Kids loved their meals too...only thing we had a small issue with was the kids mac and cheese has jalapeños  in it and we didn't know it when we ordered so the little one wouldn't eat that, but he filled up on our food so it wasn't a loss because we enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I am really torn about this place because the server Jillian was fantastic, the name is catchy, the smell when you walk in is good, and the atmosphere was nice, but unfortunately the food wasn't enough to make us want to come back, especially for those prices.

We went there for my birthday (and they did get us some cupcakes to go on the house-1 chocolate salted caramel and 3 maple bacon which were...pretty, but weird tasting). 

I got the 2 meat platter...ribs and pulled pork with sides of cole slaw and mac n cheese. I always get ribs naked and if I need sauce I usually find a decent spicy one at any BBQ joint. Their spicy sauces were not good. I felt like they tasted like tequila for some reason. I'm not sure if they were meant to, but it wasn't a good flavor for a bbq sauce. Also...other reviews have talked about the ribs falling off the bone. Uhhh...mine did not. As a matter of fact, I only ate a little meat off the top and when my boyfriend asked why I explained that I couldn't get the meat off of any of the other parts bc it was tough. 

So...the pulled pork was ok...not much seasoning or smoke flavor but y'know...tasted like pork. There were a few gristly floppy fat things that I personally don't like, but maybe some people do.   

The cole slaw was bad...like...not creamy and had some really strange flavor. I don't know what it was but it was gross and I didn't eat it. Normally I love cole slaw on my pulled pork, but this one would've ruined the pork.

The mac n cheese was good (as recommended by Jillian) but one good side isn't enough to make me come back.

My boyfriend got a steak. It was cooked perfectly as he ordered it, but it had no flavor. I would swear it wasn't seasoned AT ALL. Just a plain steak, flopped on a grill for some nice grill marks and served just like that. It was pretty bad. He doesn't eat veggies much but I tasted his green beans...they were very uhhh...fresh? Is that the nice way to say that something wasn't really cooked or seasoned? They were almost raw. I personally don't like green beans like that, but maybe some people do. If so...get them here. He had mashed potatoes too and they were pretty bland too. I guess if you serve a bland steak and bland green beans it's probably good to have bland potatoes with them so you don't accentuate the blandness of the other two items.

I almost forgot about appetizers! My dad ordered some redneck tacos for an appetizer. They were...ehhh...I wouldn't order them again. They were basically some pork and that funky tasting cole slaw on top of what basically tasted like a pancake. I had to cut it up to eat it with a fork, and didn't finish it bc it was so weird tasting.

We also shared some burnt ends which I normally love at BBQ places. They had strange flavor. Not sure if it was the meat or the sauce. I didn't care for them. 

So like I said, the server was wonderful, but the food's just not enough to make it a place I'll return to."}
{"text":"First time trying Porkopolis, we had fried pickles, pulled pork sandwich, and combo sandwich. Brady Bogen was in and stopped by each table and inquired what we were having and suggested his new sauce; Sriracha. 

Review:
Fried Pickles- great, chips not spears, light breading, and a massive serving. Split with 3+ ppl the two of us had more than enough.

Pulled Pork Sandwich- great portion pork wasn't dry and all the sauces paired well.

Combo Sandwich- good portion but was dwarfed by the pulled pork sandwich. However the coleslaw was a great addition. 

Mac&Cheese- Just do it... Great portion, a creamy cheese with a baked crust.

Sauces:
Hot and Sweet- lacking on spice but not too sweet. 

Sweet and Smokey- well balanced.

Sriracha- None compare to Huy Fong Foods Sriracha. Brady captures the Jalapeño Garlic sauce well, I would have liked more spice and a thicker sauce. It is a better  Sriracha than any generic store brand. 

General feel of the Restaurant: well spaced, great view into the kitchen area, beer selection is a bit small but it's not a bar, service was adequate and we were seated quickly. 

Overall:
Experience was good- I look forward to going more times to explore the menu. Plus bring my buddies with some appetite!"}
{"text":"The gf likes to take me here because she says I'm a little piggy. I guess that's better than being a big piggy. But truth is this is one of phx best eating establishments. Think French class and care but in a BBQ joint. The quality and freshness of the food is simply amazing. Everything about this place is wonderful from the host at the door who is always sweet to the music to the diet coke. One of my favorite foods is apply crisp. They have some amazing desert save room"}
{"text":"My husband & I stopped in after a movie and this place deserves a 4.5.  I got the blackened catfish, which was a 5; my husband got the skillet BBQ shrimp, which was not a 4 because the sides size were too small.  Good thing I let him finish my catfish!  We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I see why this place is called Porkoplis.   The pulled pork and ribs are amazing!   Great service also."}
{"text":"Great BBQ! Great chicken. Sauces and rubs are tasty. Leave room for dessert. Megan was a great server."}
{"text":"Solid! Great flavors and great portions. I've been here a few times and I've never had something I didn't love."}
{"text":"Had my first experience here not too long ago and it was awesome. Great service and the brisket was perfect. Looking forward to going back and trying more of their menu!"}
{"text":"Porkopolis is a favorite of some of my friends. I had never heard of it before and love some BBQ in my life... This place did not let us down. 

I thought the prices were a bit high until I saw how much meat you got. The. The prices seemed very fair. It actually called into question the portions at some of my other favorite BBQ places when the same order at this spot is nearly twice the size for the beef brisket!

Service was good and this place was busy!

Definitely worth a taste!"}
{"text":"Great pork and brisket. Staff was amazingly friendly. Ate a bit early so wait was short; however, this place filled up quick. Its definitely worth arriving ahead of typical meal hours. Everyone seemed pleased with their meals and staff interactions. Super great place."}
{"text":"Gross, gross, gross!!!!   My husband and I were excited to hear there was a barbeque place in town that had 'Burnt ends' on the menu.  The last time we had burnt ends was in Kansas City and we have never been able to find them on a menu in Arizona.  We visited Porkopolis last night (Thursday, Feb 21st) and it saddens me to say, \"The Burnt ends were dreadful!!!!\"  My first two fork stabs brought up two huge pieces of fat...no meat.  There was more fat in the container than meat.  The little bits of meat we did have was swimming in liquid fat.  The Red-neck tacos were okay...nothing to write home about.  Don't bother ordering the potato chips.  Wow....I can't believe I even ordered the potato chips.  Luckily, we just ordered 3 appetizers and are down $30 bucks.  It could have been a lot worse had we ordered an entree.  For those of you that are going solely on the basis that some D.J. you hear on your fav radio station owns the joint DON'T.  Save your time and hard earned money.  (Note:  The bbque sauce is good.)"}
{"text":"We ordered takeout, our first time trying Porkopolis! Everyone seemed nice over the phone and inside. We ordered two combo meat sandwiches and one brisket French dip. The flavor of the combo meat sandwich was great. However, the meat was a bit dry and there was zero BBQ sauce on the sandwich or in any of the bags. I think BBQ sauce would have definitely helped. The brisket French dip was even more dry than the combo meat sandwich, unfortunately. I'm not sure if it's because it was towards the end of the night or just a dry batch."}
{"text":"The food was pretty damn good! 
I wasn't expecting much, but the pork and the brisket were pretty good! 
There were two types of BBQ sauces and they were flavorful, but not the best I've had. 
One was 'Hot n' Sweet' and the other was 'Sweet n' Smoky' 
They were good. 
The brisket was a little dry but very flavorful and the pork was cooked almost perfectly. Very flavorful as well. 
I would recommend this place for sure. 
I liked it. 
The service was good, I enjoyed the gentleman working today. 
He was friendly and energetic. 
I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"This place is mediocre at best. I've definitely had better. Way overpriced for the quality you get. I guess you're paying for the name? Kinda a bummer that there's only 2 flavors of bbq sauce. Ate here with my family of 5 and literally everyone got sick a few hours later. Seriously. Don't eat here. Save your money and find somewhere better."}
{"text":"Service was great and the food was wonderful. I ordered the Cubano Sandwich with Jalapeño Mac N Cheese for the side. The Mac N Cheese was delicious and really enjoyed Brady's Sriracha BBQ sauce. Great food and service for a great price. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Best fried pickles I've had. Husband usually won't eat them but he tried these and loved them. Sliced thin and crispy. Had the Redneck Tacos which is listed as an app,  but was easily a meal I could have shared. Jalepeno coleslaw was the perfect addition to them and hubby's sandwich. Resist the urge to try the fried mac and cheese bites. No flavor to them. Apple crisp was tasty but not much crisp to it. The pulled pork and the bbq sauce was delicious."}
{"text":"Because this was on the food network, we decided to try it out. Barbecue at most places is hit or miss. This was a miss big time. I don't think I have ever had worse BBQ. I decided to take the opinion of the server and go with ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. The ribs were just OK, but they seemed to be from the oven. Everything was extremely dry and I hate to use sauce because the BBQ flavor should come through without sauce. The jalapeño mac and cheese was OK, but had zero kick. Asked the server why, he said it is just supposed to have a hint of jalapeño. We complained to the server about the dryness of the food and he said he would let the person who is supposed to be managing know. No offers to correct the problem nor visit by the manager."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. We left feeling jipped (spelling?).  

We walked in unsure if we should seat ourselves or wait to be seated. Someone came to seat us after a minute. The waitress got our drink order fairly quickly but didn't seem as interested in answering questions or taking our order. It didn't take forever, but longer than we thought it should. 

We ordered the nachos to start. This took longer than it should have to get to our table.  They were made with the house potato chips, chicken, cheese, tomatoes, scallions, and sweet BBQ sauce. Could have used more sauce inside, but that's easily remedied with the sauces on the table. 

My son ordered the blackened catfish (and plain ole fries) and said it was spicy. He otherwise enjoyed it. 

I ordered the pulled pork sandwhich. It's what I use to judge every BBQ place we go to.  The bun was great. But the meat was just okay and didn't take up much space in the bun. Not worth the price. Came with a side and I got the jalapeño cole slaw. You could taste the jalapeño flavor, but it was dry and otherwise bland. 

My husband got the 2 meat platter. It came out on a huge platter but took up not even half of it!  There were 4 small pieces of dry, flavorless thin cut turkey and 2 pieces of okay brisket. The garlic mash tasted watered down and bland. The dirty rice tasted dirty alright- like dirty dish water. Bland dirty dish water. 

Overall, not worth the $60 we spent there!  I'd rather go out of my way to Joe's and spend less money and get my money's worth. Funny thing is, they have a little comment card that I filled out. If you turn it in, they email you $5 store credit. Yeah, we won't be back. Don't need that credit. How about half a refund instead?"}
{"text":"We had gone to Porkopolis about 2 years ago and were so underwhelmed by, well, everything, even the service that we had not been back since.
Last night we needed ribs and it was WAY past time for me to make them and Famous Dave's didn't sound right either so we bit the bullet.
See those 5 stars up there that should tell you that that wasn't the only thing we bit in to.
The pulled pork, the brisket, garlic mashed potatoes, cole slaw (which I normally equate to eating pure evil).  All were moist and almost no sauce in sight until we poured the supplied sauce over the meats.
Oh, and then the meat-falling-off-the-bone ribs... wow.  Actually only complaint is that I actually like to tear into the ribs but all is forgiven.
I got a couple of burnt ends but the wife and kids barely left me any.  
I got the food to-go so my only interaction with the staff was while waiting for the credit card scanner to come back online.  Wait was long enough that I was offered a drink which is a sign of good customer service at a restaurant.  I had water by choice.
OK Porkopolis, you've redeemed yourself in the stomachs of our house."}
{"text":"AMAZING BBQ and AWESOME service! We came for restaurant week to try something new and practically had to be rolled out of there, everything was delicious! Not only were we stuffed from the yummy fried pickles, jalapeño mac and cheese, pulled pork and cornbread, but we left with leftovers to boot! The cinnamon apple waffles were dynamite and the perfect ending to an excellent meal, but what we couldn't get over was the personal, fast and friendly service, we loved it! Rockin' ambiance, too! We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"If you love BBQ Ribs as much as me, don't pass up Porkopolis.  I just had the Best baby backs of my life. And that's saying something since Iam 67. :) Thick fall-off-the-bone meaty sweet BBBacks.  Yummy!"}
{"text":"This is by far the best BBQ in Scottsdale and probably in Phoenix. The burnt ends are always spot on! Pair that with red kool-aid and Mac N cheese and you have a winner.  The staff is always friendly as well. Try the homemade pork rinds too!"}
{"text":"Solid four stars for our first experience at the opolis of Pork.  It's tucked away in the Sam's Club parking lot and despite driving past it numerous times, did not realize it was there.  That said, I listen to Holmberg's Morning Sickness almost every morning so I've been wanting to try it out for some time.  It's smaller inside than you might think, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Our Groupon special came with two of their cocktails, an appetizer, three meat entrees + two sides, and a dessert.  I've only had fried pickles that were better at Hooters - and in my opinion, Hooters frickles are the best thing on their menu.  In other words, get 'em!  The brisket was fattier than it should've been, the pulled pork was spot on, and the ribs were a little dry.  The sides were tasty, I had the mac n' cheese - which had a kick to it that I enjoyed, and the jalapeno coleslaw that tasted nice and fresh.  They were out of the ice cream sandwich that came with the special, but instead they gave us two of the best popsicles I've ever had (see review for Paletas Betty) which ended everything on a high note.  The service was top notch and we will be back to try the other meats!!"}
{"text":"I live about 45 minutes away from here but I have no problem making the drive to eat the great food at this BBQ joint. I love the fact that Brady himself will come up and talk with you and tell you about the food you are eating. I think the staff is extremely helpful and I have not had a bad experience here yet. I would recommend you try something particular but I would say try everything it is all great!"}
{"text":"Honestly, this is probably over rated BBQ I've ever had, with the including the brisket, which was tough and clearly dry brisket should be moist without the sauce. The ribs were pretty much undercooked a little. The pork was dry and a bit tough. Unlike the other comments here I like my ribs falling off the bone, but not to the point that cannot enjoy.

If you're in the area and their open, it may be worth a shot if you have no clue what good BBQ is. It good to get others opinions on this place.

My server was great, friendly, and attentive. Prices are reasonable.

I will visit again under the 3 strikes and you're out rule."}
{"text":"Third time out to Porkopolis with the family and nachos win the day.  Had the dirty bird which was pretty good but I think I over killed it with ordering coleslaw with it as well.  Love the owner and the morning show he's on and now love the meat he's cooking as well."}

Porkopolis, the meats evolve, 
All the platters would come with sides
I do Yelp, I do Yelp

Porkopolis is barbeque
Everybody got their eye on you
I do Yelp, it's Scottsdale

Porkopolis, the barbeque
Sweet and Hot sauce on the table side
I do Yelp, I'm all here!


I was somewhat excited to finally come to Porkopolis simply because I was a fan of KUPD radio station!

I attended Porkopolis with my family for an early Friday evening dining.  The place was pretty slow.  We started off with some beer and I was pretty intrigued by the selection of moonshine, but rather shy away from it and shot for a beer instead.  For my food I went for the 2 meats and 2 sides selection.  I picked the Brisket and the Pulled Pork with a side of Jalapeno Mac and Cheese and the Baked Beans.  This was definitely a big boys meal.  The size of the platter was almost the size of a large pizza!  

As for the food?  The brisket was cooked to perfection, but I wished it had more of a crust to add that extra texture.  Pulled Pork was a tad bit dry so I added some much needed BBQ sauce.  My favorite was the Sweet & Hot house BBQ.  The heat wasn't overly bearing, but just enough sting for that added flavor.  My star of the night was the Jalapeno Mac and Cheese; cheesy and warm with every bite while the jalapeno pepper was just enough for a minor aromatic scent.  The baked beans were also my favorite since it had small chunks of pork and also was more of chili then just plain baked beans.

In the end, the pork didn't win me over, but the BBQ sauce did and so did the sides.  Service was fair and the moonshine might get me to come back. - Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Visited Porkopolis again last night. This place never disappoints. The customer service is always fantastic. The food is always served fast as well. The meat is incredible. So flavorful and tender. I think this is personally one of the best bbq spots in the valley. The portions are also great. I always have leftovers to bring home and enjoy the next day. I highly recommend you try this place!"}
{"text":"pretty good bbq.  I like the flavor on the burnt ends.  they are done up crispy and have great sauce.  they are a bit fatty.  I was talked into the pulled pork and I thought it was ok.

service was fantastic at lunch!"}
{"text":"Finally a solid barbecue spot in the neighborhood! We went for restaurant week, so we were able to get a good idea of the menu. We started with the burnt ends and fried pickles, portions were great for both and the pickles nice and briny (a bit of grease at the bottom of the tray though). We then got two of the barbecue platters (we tried the brisket, pulled pork, chicken, and ribs), the pulled chicken salad, and the quesadilla. The brisket and pulled pork were a bit on the dry side, the ribs were good (they fell off the bone), and the chicken was the best (moist and smoky). For dessert we had the waffle with apples and ice cream on it, it was delicious, though we suspect the apples came from a can. 

The music playlist was bomb! And service was on par. They seem to really have it down here. We enjoyed our time here and will probably return."}
{"text":"Finally, barbecue is back in this neck of the woods in Scottsdale. For some reason it's a hard-sell cuisine, here. Joints open then close within a year. Cost of rent vs. low customer numbers is surely the culprit.  Here's hoping Porkopolis can buck the trend and stick around.  

The folks that own the joint have certainly spent beaucoups o' bucks renovating the space from the two previous tenants. The resulting decor is comfortable, barbecue joint. The bar's been moved to more open spaces. Generally, it's less claustrophobic than, again, the two previous tenants' efforts.  I just hope the new owner's sales can recoup the expense of the redo so the joint can survive. Last night (a Wednesday) the place was drawing a nice crowd, so maybe... .

The Beau and I have only sampled the wings and the Redneck Tacos. The wings are gargantuan and are quite the tasty affair.  The Rednecks are open faced and consist of a thin, tasty, homemade corn cake that was very flavorful and on the sweet side. Atop, a generous helping of Porkopolis' Jalopeño Slaw then finished with a scoop of pulled pork. Three to an order and pretty good tasting on the ol' tonguebuds.  Only downside was the pulled pork
wasn't firm; just a little bit too soft; it's texture was as if it had been flash-steamed just before plate-ing. Pulled pork should have a \"tooth,\" or where the grain of the meat should be felt by the chewer. If the cook works on that, the PP will be a \"winner winner chicken dinner.\"  

Upshot?  I'd say the Q is Memphis Style as the meats are rubbed with a concoction of spices and the sauces are vinegar based.  All-n-all Dick, I'd give the record a 7 1/2. It's got a good beat and it's easy to dance to.  Yea, I'd buy the record."}
{"text":"Stopped by on my way home from work. I ordered the 3 meat platter, 2 smoked turkey and 1 brisket with a side of mashed potatoes and beans. All I can say this is going to be a regular stop. The flavor from the meat is heavenly. The brisket falls apart in your mouth. Brady's sweet BBQ sauce has and amazing flavor with a nice kick. The staff was eager to guide me to the right meat choice. Talked with Brady which was great and met Hamy who has a great dry rub sense of humor. Tricia was very helpful in guiding me and will definitely be back sooner rather than later. All I can say Porkopolis,  \"You food is so good, I would do handstands daily for it\". Keep up the great work"}
{"text":"I came with high expectations after hearing great things but was really disappointed. Growing up in TN I will admit I am spoiled with really good bbq so may be a bit jaded."}
{"text":"This was my first visit but I'll definitely be back. Great brisket, good service, good sweet tea."}
{"text":"I ordered food to go. From the time I walked through the door I was unimpressed! I was told for to go orders to go to back counter. When I arrived at counter I was not greeted at all. I awkwardly stood there. A man walked by and dropped my check down in front of me on the counter. $72, and still no hey how's it going, thanks for coming in, nothing! I ordered 3-2meat lunch specials, a pulled pork sandwich and 3 sides of cornbread. When arriving home I noticed my cornbread was still frozen! $9 Is a lot of money to spend on frozen cornbread! The brisket was very dry, thank goodness for BBQ sauce. I was hoping to find some TX style BBQ. Folks if your looking for good BBQ it's not here, mosey on along, don't waste $72 like I did!"}
{"text":"Lost in translation what Revelations really state: \".....and in the final days god created Porkopolis, so that man may get a taste of the divine, as a sign of his existence.\"

Disclaimer:  I'm the biggest barbecue aficionado you'll ever meet.   I've tried the big chains  from Famous Daves to Lucille's,  to the smaller hometown favorites:  Waldo's, Tom's, Big City,Honey Bears and the overrated Joe's real.  Hell--- I've been barbecued myself! Anyone who went to the 2012 Arizona Barbecue festival knows, a woman's scorn has nothing on the sweltering heat of the Arizona sun.  What am I getting at?  

Porkopolis is omnipotent.  

The atmosphere is great, brown floors compliment the burnished colored walls and hard oak tables.  Brady B's family history of pork packing is displayed on canvas and to make things top shelf you will find a stylish bar to your left, so drink your sweet heart out!

I ordered the 4 meat tray, I chose all four meats, two hearty sides, and by god if you like a spicy kick request the sauce with more heat...they'll know what you mean.  The ribs were easy to pull apart, it's savory nature magnified by the steam rolling off the round bones.  The texture is a tender chew, complimented with Brady's sweet barbecue sauce you'll go to rehab over.  Next up is the brisket, it's moist contents seal in it's delish distinct flavor. I unlock it's contents with my first bite and I'm in sensory overload.  The baked macaroni is more than enough for two and it's cooked just the way those cheesy noodle bastards should be.  I can't even finish the two other meats as my stomach is packed like an \"Occupy Wallstreet\" protest.   Modestly priced me and my date got stuffed for 20 dollars...and I'm a 240 lb monster.

I intend to be a regular for my barbecue cravings, thank god for Porkopolis the hog heaven for human carnivores!"}
{"text":"I ordered 3 of these tonight. They are combo pork and brisket sandwich with cole slaw. I ordered to go. It isn't the best to go let me say, but that is because the styrofoam makes the fries soggy. They would be better wrapped in foil. The meats were a bit salty, and there was no side Bbq sauce to put in the sandwich like they're usually eaten with. About half way through the sandwich I bit into something hard. It was a ball end of the bone and about the size of a large marble. I was pretty disgusted, and so glad I didn't bite down hard on it or I would have broken my tooth! I took a photo of it in case they needed to see it. I'm not sure if calling them would accomplish anything. We've come in here before a couple times. Service was always ok, but don't get the impression it's very important."}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite BBQ restaurants. Dimas and all of the staff are awesome! Great food and customer service. I just tried their Chef Salad and would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I can't remember why I decided to try this place but I am very picky about my BBQ being from Oklahoma.  It was tucked away and I finally gave it a try since the new competing restaurants were not up to my standards of licking fingers several times during the meal.  Yes that is a legitimate measurement in the world of BBQ.  Oh and a bib at times.

It has a bit of a sports bar feel to it and the kitchen is open so you can see what's going on.  The owner was there one of the times I went and is very committed to a quality product and experience.

I remember splitting the meat combinations a few times and it was more than enough food for two people. There is smoky flavor to the meat and I've tried the chicken, ribs, pork....all good.  If you are a bit of a wuss like me, I think the side of beans has a kick and so does the coleslaw so be cautious.  

One of my favorite things to do is just get the wings and go to town on those.  They grill them instead of frying which makes them delicious.  Bypass the two BBQ places on Chandler & I-10 because this place so much better."}
{"text":"Awesome pulled pork...fabulous creamed corn....cornbread was a little dry....Mac n cheese did not need the jalepenos. We split a three meat platter and it was perfect portion size. GREAT service and cool atmosphere. Will be back here again for happy hour :)"}
{"text":"The pulled Pork tacos are delicious. The brisket is so tender and the Jumbalaya the perfect level of spice. The quality of the food and taste deserve 5 stars.
The owner was very friendly and made you feel welcome."}
{"text":"We went for a late lunch and there was really no one there. Quiet and quaint! I only had the fried pickles and the ice cream sandwiches.. both were VERY good! Others at our table had the pulled pork sandwich with Mac n cheese which was also very good!"}
{"text":"Fried pickles were a bit salty but the Brisket salad and cornbread was exceptional! The atmosphere is causal and inviting. The service was great! I'd definitely recommend this place and I will be coming back."}
{"text":"Stumbled onto this place and was glad I did.  Got the three meat platter which was way too much food for me but a reasonable price.  The baby back ribs and the jalapeño macaroni and cheese were fantastic.  Brisket was not as tender as I like hence the 4 stars.  The sauce is fantastic.  Great service I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Amazing food friendly staff. I will definitely be back. The burnt ends are amazing. Thanks for the dinner guys."}
{"text":"If you like pork products, come here! They have delicious tacos, quesadillas, bbq nachos, and delicious larger meals too. If you like bloody Mary's, try their bacon Bloody Mary!  They always have great service too and I cant wait to go back to try more!"}
{"text":"The staff was very friendly! The food could have been better. I had a high expectation after trying out Rudy's and hearing good things about this place. I feel the meat lacked in flavor. Pricing was also a bit on the high side for what you get. Probably won't be going back here unless Ruby's goes out of business.."}
{"text":"This is a great place to meet friends for their great happy hour. 1/2 price appetizers and so many to choose from. Their burnt ends are fab. Their burgers are big and juicy. This is our 3rd time here and we'll be back."}
{"text":"No doubt amazing smoked meats and delicious moonshine. I am in awe. EPIC! Had the strawberry candied pecan and blue cheese brisket salad. Follow your nose to this place and you wont be sorry! Brisket was tender, fall apart moist burnt goodness- how do they do it!?!?!? I dont care, im happy!!!"}
{"text":"Holy smokes (no pun intended) this place has the best wings I've ever had. I have tried wings all over the valley and none of them come close to these. They actually smoke their wings. Then fry them and put a fantastic dry rub on. No need for sauce at all but if you're that kinda guy then they have 4 pretty great sauces as well. These wings are meaty and perfectly cooked. During happy hour they are $.50 each. After 3 belt adjustments, I had to stop eating. I didn't want to but I had to. Do yourself a favor and swing on by for some amazing wings."}
{"text":"So when I first started coming here, the food was amazing. I always ordered the half rack ribs, mac n cheese and fries. Ever since then, every time I've come, I've returned the ribs as they have gotten more and more chewy, the mac n cheese more and more watery, and the brisket is borderline beef jerky. I hate being the guy to send food back but LITERALLY the past 4 times here I've sent it back. This place has amazing food but the consistency is all but gone. Unfortunately after being here 10+ times, I give up. I will find a new spot. Sorry guys. It was fun while it lasted. Ps, the kool aid is amazing"}
{"text":"Average BBQ - sauce was not very good. We were told to stay away from the chicken since it was frozen. We ordered different meats to try, the best was brisket   French fries were solid, steak fries. Also smoked wings were very good, crunchy exterior and smoke flavor gave them a great taste. Price is high for what you get"}
{"text":"This place is AWESOME. Best BBQ I've had in a while since moving to AZ 14 years ago!!"}
{"text":"ooooooooooooo my goodness!!!!
i haven't been to chandler az in many years, well i had a load of tp to deliver at nearby, looked on yelp, thought i'd ck it out !!!
i asked about the redneck tacos!!
awesome!!!!!,awesome!!!
ms tess suggested them when i asked her about them, & i hope i am able to return!!!
thank you ms tess. sto by & enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine recently tried this place and was ranting so we had to check it out. I called before we went because we are coke drinkers so thumbs up. Place is clean and hostess was super friendly.

Our server made some great suggestuons, the wings for appetizers are delish, doesn't need sauce because they ate good dry. We tried the fried pickles,  those are pretty yum too. 

We split the full rack of ribs platter, and still have plenty we took home, HUGE portions and lots of meat on the bone. We got the mac and cheese as a side,  you have to try this. ..soooo good! I Think this meal was $23 but worth every penny consideing how much food you get. 

After being piggies and tried a lil bit of everything,  we ordered the apple crisp. Very good...

I will be coming back here for sure, great service and easy going atmosphere."}
{"text":"Meh. That's my one-word summary of my experience. Meh.

Walking into Porkopolis, I immediately liked the atmosphere. It's casual but nice. There was good music on throughout the meal. The staff was friendly and attentive throughout the meal. So far, so good.

We started with the Redneck Tacos. Considering the size and flavor of this \"appetizer\", we should have just stopped there! This was probably the best dish of the night. Three corn cakes came out with heaping piles of cole slaw and pulled pork piled on top. Admittedly, I had gotten myself thinking it was going to be more like corn bread with those toppings on it, so I was a little disappointed that the corn cake flavor disappears in the pork and cole slaw combination, but this was pretty tasty!

After sharing the Redneck Tacos, two of us got the 4-meat combo platter. I will say that the portions at Porkopolis are definitely big portions, because this 4-meat platter put the two of us under the table. Unfortunately, the flavor of the 4 meats really isn't much to write home about. We got brisket, turkey, and a double order of ribs.

Brisket - I judge a BBQ establishment by the brisket. This is not good brisket, in my opinion. It came out in huge, thick slices, which was an immediate bad sign to me. It had big chunks of fat on it. Those two things right there are bad signs to me for brisket. It ended up being greasy and just OK.

Turkey - I am fairly confident that this is processed turkey. We were joking around before it came out that we had ordered sandwich meat, but I was confident that we'd get nice turkey breast. Instead, we got thickly-sliced sandwich meat. It was very rubbery in consistency and just not very appealing.

Ribs - This was the best of the meats. It was falling off the bone, though, which means that it probably was overcooked. And considering the amount of sauce on it, I'd say that they know that the meat was dry from the overcooking. But they were still pretty decent.

Green beans and baked beans - The stars of the night, honestly. I really enjoyed the baked beans and would have liked a serving that was more than a couple spoonfuls. It was the only item of the night for which the serving was entirely too small. And the green beans were just plain delicious. Perfectly cooked with delicious seasoning.

The green beans, baked beans, and Redneck Tacos are the only reasons for 3 stars on this rating. The meat itself is 2 stars at best.

Maybe we should have listened to the server and ordered the meat loaf. It sounded pretty interesting on the menu. I don't think I'll be back, but if I ever am, maybe I'll take that route.

Meh."}
{"text":"This was our first time to Porkopolis.  We've been looking forward to visiting for some time, as my husband is a loyal KUPD listener.  During our visit, the place was pretty empty, only two other parties.  Certainly not a dinner rush.  Service was wonderful, definitely the high point of our meal.  However, the food was nothing special.  The ribs were inedible - tough and dry, basically beef jerky.  Our 3yr old daughter ordered the KIDS mac and cheese, only to find that it was spicy (as in heat flavor).  She didn't eat it.  The rest of our meal, Blackened Catfish and the Combo Meat Sandwich, was ok, not bad, but not great.  Wanting to root for this place.  We may try it again at a busier time, in hopes of fresher bbq."}
{"text":"They should call this place Saltopolis because everything was dramatically oversalted.  I tried the brisket and pulled pork. My wife tried the turkey and chicken. Of course, we shared a few bites with each other.  For what it's worth, I will say the pulled pork was really good and they have GREAT sauce. It's really wonderful stuff. But the meat itself was just ok and way too salty (other than the pulled pork).  The chicken was also overcooked and dry.  Maybe a bad day for the chicken? Who knows.  It's decent food with larger portions, but it's a bit on the pricey side.  There are cheaper options that are just as good and there are options with the same price that are a lot better. It just simply wasn't good enough to warrant a $50 price tag for two, two meat combos and 2 drinks."}
{"text":"Disappointed. Ordered take out for Mother's Day...pulled pork, brisket, Mac and cheese and beans. Meat was tasty and BBQ sauce was good, but brisket was super dry, beans were gross with large bits of fat and Mac and cheese was tasteless. Oh well. Not the worst BBQ I have had but not even close to the best."}
{"text":"Wonderful BBQ!!  We walked in needing a quick to go order and was in and out in less than 10min. We are BBQ \"snobs\" (being from Texas originally) and it was some of the best BBQ we've had!  The pulled pork is amazing as is the jalapeño Mac and cheese!  We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Amazing staff, I feel like family each time I go here! The food is fantastic as well."}
{"text":"A good measure of BBQ is how the food tastes without sauce. It is impossible here because the food is smothered in sauce, which overpowers any flavor the meat might have. The food is not bad, but it certainly wasn't good enough to make me want to return."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Highly recommend the redneck tacos or the Cincinnati skillet with pork! Great size food portions and reasonable pricing. Happy hour get the front porch peach tea!!"}
{"text":"Phenomenal!!!! To say that the food is delicious cannot begin to describe it. This is a must stop place for anyone who loves great BBQ!!"}
{"text":"Great food. We got the 4 item and split it for two people. Great food. The spicy Mac and cheese was great"}
{"text":"I called and asked if they make turkey legs here, he said \"no we don't.\" And hung up! How rude! That is really BAD customer service."}
{"text":"Peg and I are always up for 'Q and we had heard great things about this place. We went last night and loved it!  Scott took great care of us and we had a sampling of things...our usual M.O. The fried dill pickles and sauce were terrific and a great way to brighten things up. We had the brisket salad (with a light vinaigrette), the smoked chicken wings (also top notch), and the porkopolis quesadilla..the star of the show... served with sour cream and a very good salsa. Leftovers of the quesadillas with scrambled eggs were the deja vu for us this morning. Service and food way better than average, especially for this 'hood.  Hope you find time to check it out!  Happy Holidays from Peg and me!  Dr. B"}
{"text":"It was meh.  Didn't care for the moonshine cocktails. I swear if I had lit a match close to my lips I would have breathed fire. 
The brisket was dry and too salty. the ribs were fork tender but also on the salty side. 
The pulled pork tacos were good but the corn meal tortilla was too soft to eat like a true taco, unless you are okay with getting it to your mouth just to explode  all over your lap. I chose not to live dangerously and ate it with a knife and fork.  
Service was really friendly."}
{"text":"My family and I have been here twice in the last week.  The barbecue nachos are fabulous, and a meal all by themselves.  Top hat off with a two, or even three, meat entree and you're all set.  The corn bread and the garlic mashed potatoes just added to a great dinner.  
The desert choices are great as well.  They have a great brownie ice cream sandwich that my whole family loved, and tonight we had the sticky toffee pudding cake.  Both nights you could see Brady making the rounds talking to the guests.  He is very friendly, and jokingly tried to get my daughter to give him a bite of her chocolate chip cookie.  It is definitely good food with a very friendly atmosphere.  The only problem I have is that it is on my way home from work and too tempting to get the nachos for take out."}
{"text":"For starters the burnt ends are actually burnt A large portion is served  and it is very well done I ordered the 3 meat plate ribs pulled pork and brisket all well done I would recommend this place for the food but the beer selection puts it over the top"}
{"text":"More like NOPEopolis.  I'm usually not terribly mean in my reviews but I am still kind of annoyed by this whole ordeal.  I wanted some ribs, checked Yelp for good reviews, decided on a local place over some chain, and FAILED miserably.  Yelp owes me one.

First, I didn't care for the ribs at all.  There was a bit too much spiciness on the ribs and it overshadowed the flavor a bit.  Also, I didn't really care much for any of the BBQ sauces offered and smokiness would have been more prevalent.  More annoying was that the ribs were overdone, which makes me think they were sitting around drying out, or cooked too quickly, and wasn't excited about a bunch of hard pieces of pork.  I tried the pulled pork too and it was underwhelming; Tender, but slightly dry.  This was also not very smokey or flavorful and tasted like bland cooked pork.

Ok, so the meat was... meh.  Side dishes... is where I started posting curses at Yelp on my Facebook page because it was rated 4 stars.  The people who said get Mac & Cheese are out of their freaking minds.  This stuff took me down memory lane, of a time when I was 10 years old and didn't care how food tasted.  Think Ponderosa buffet mac & cheese here; Watery and tasteless.  I believe there was an attempt to bake some real cheese on top so it looked pretty, but I wasn't fooled.  I was excited about cornbread at least... NOPE!  Dry, cake like, and tasteless.  Use a box of Jiffy cornbread mix maybe? Ack! AND, melted margarine all over it?  I thought I was getting punked.  Here is the deal...  Go buy the book from this place back East called Dinosaur BBQ.  It has a recipe in it for cornbread.  Make that.  Yeah, you'll have to buy some actual butter milk and real butter, but so what.  Take some left over butter and melt that on top.  And, use real cheese IN the mac & cheese, not just on top of it.

All that being said... the service was good at least.  And their Moonshine drinks were tasty, although they didn't really cheer me up.  Maybe I should have a had a couple or 10 more."}
{"text":"I'm giving them 5 stars for the brisket and pulled pork. Good lord was it good. Ribs are even good. 


The sweet and Smokey bbq sauce is excellent. 

Mashed potatoes are on point. 

The best part about is no plastic people and bad Botox."}
{"text":"Great experience here, definitely coming back.  Our server was patient (even though I asked him lots of questions about the ingredients because of my food sensitivities), professional, and attentive. We got the 4 meat platter and mashed potatoes and two sides of green beans and dirty rice. It was just the right amount of food for the two of us and our three young children. All of the meat was moist, tender, and flavorful even without any sauce. We also got house made pork rinds as an appetizer. It was an enormous platter, and tasty with the dipping sauce. We also got the brownie ice cream sandwich which hit the spot. The whole meal was a great value too, considering the quantity and quality of the food. Very satisfied. This will be our go to for barbecue."}
{"text":"This was the first stop on our restaurant week agenda! My husband has driven by this on numerous occasions recently and this was his pick. Good pick! 
We made a reservation for 7 on a Sunday night. We were greeted and seated almost immediately (bonus points for reservations meaning something!) It was loud (due to cement flooring and open ceiling) and there were quite a few families there with kids making noise, but it wasn't distracting...just sounded like everyone was having a good time. Our server (who never gave us her name) was courteous and efficient. 

We ordered the red neck tacos to start...they sounded unique....BBQ meat, coleslaw and sauce on a pancake! They were good (especially the coleslaw!) but I suggest you add a little more sauce to them. There were 2 choices of sauce on the table...both really yummy. 
For our entrees I had the catfish (NOT BREADED THANK GOD!) but wonderfully seasoned and perfectly cooked. It came with fresh string beans and dirty rice...both very good. The spouse had the ribs...and holy cow there was a mountain of them! He is a big eater and he could not finish them! He said they were delish and very meaty. They came with that great coleslaw and fries. 
For dessert we split the apple cobbler...made just how I like it with lots of brown sugar, and topped with fresh vanilla ice cream. 
For drinks, the spouse had his usual (boring) gin and tonic, but I tried the Firestone Brewery DBA. Really good!  Our bill was about $60...good value! 
My husband is happy he found a new lunch place for the days he has to go to South Chandler for work. Check it out!"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service! The pulled pork is the most moist I've had! The brisket was fantastic as well."}
{"text":"I got the 3 meat platter and the husband got the scramble. His was not bad. Mine I got the pulled pork, the brisket,  and the  turkey. Garlic mashed potatoes for the side. We got there about 1pm on Saturday. The server was amazing. Only 2 other people there. He was very kind and helpful our drinks never went empty.....the potatoes were good. The pork sure tasted like it was left over from Friday tasteless and dry. The turkey is pan fried not smoked. And the brisket was over cooked and brittle. No flavor and no smoke ring. I should have known it was gonna be bad when you walk in and you don't smell meat smoking! The sauce was not good. When eating BBQ I would expect some sort of flavor. Thank goodness for the white bread and potatoes."}
{"text":"This place was very clean and simple. The staff was friendly and nice. The menu looked pretty awesome but when the food came out it was disappointing. We had the red neck taco appetizer and the two meat combo ( baby backs and brisket), all of their meats were very fatty and the sides were boring and bland.  There is just nothing to write home about with this join. With all the BBQ competition in town they definitely need to step up their game."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to expect of this place, I've heard a lot of hype from different people but after seeing pictures of the food I had to give it a try. I decided on there Brady Bacon Burger which I want to say was a brisket bacon blend...with 2 strips of bacon, pulled pork, and BBQ aioli. I opted out on the coleslaw that was supposed to be topped on it. I eat a lot of crazy foodie type burgers and must say, I put this on my top 5 burgers of all time. I can't wait to go back and get it again. It is a little pricey at $14, but you get what you pay for. I don't mind paying a little extra for quality. They also had kool-aid on tap which was a great plus and serve local made and there own house deserts."}
{"text":"Got a bunch of food to go. Ordered there food was ready really fast got it home and everything was just ok. Got the baby backs they where ok had some brisket that was just ok too. For the sides we got Mac and some fries. Mac was not my thing my friend liked it though fries where good got the chowder and it was pretty bad. Place is just OK maybe it was cuz I took it home but I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Had the pulled pork sandwich, it was great. Price was good. First week they are open, still working on organization like any new place. Wait was 5 minutes, they were busy for lunch. Food was worth it."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place just so I had another BBQ place to go that wasn't a chain like rudys or dickeys. I was disappointed when they brought out my 2 item plate with brisket and pulled pork, the brisket was extremely dry and only had flavor on the outer edges from the smoker. The pulled pork faired better but still needed a lot of barbecue sauce, I think some of the appetizers would be great since they use the same meat but it just doesn't hold up on its own. 

The only thing I did like was the friendly staff and the barbecue sauce."}
{"text":"Good BBQ.  Had the brisket and it was delicious. Fries were OK and the waiter forgot my ketchup. 
Wish they had some lunch specials. Most plates are $11-$15."}
{"text":"I appreciate Angella's response; however, please note that we were already at the restaurant for over an hour and a half when our waitress finally gave us our bill. I'm sorry but **she** should have realized we were upset about the ribs after we brought it to her attention and **she** should have made it right. That's where the issues is. It does not lie with us failing to ask for a manager to make it right, it lies with the waitress not making it right herself. She represents your restaurant.

Your response says \"one of our biggest frustrations is when guests leave without letting us know what happened so we can take care of it right away\" but, remember, I **did** let you know what happened. We told the waitress the ribs were inedible. She didn't take care of it. Why do I have to be the jerk that asks to speak with her boss? Do you not empower your staff to handle these types of issues?

Also, I sent the email from your website's contact page and when I left the two messages for a manager to call me I explained that it was pertaining to an experience I had over the weekend. At this point all I was looking for was an apology. I probably would have deleted my review after receiving one. I'm disappointed that your response was defensive and didn't offer even the smallest of apologies."}
{"text":"First time here, absolutely amazing food. The brisket is by far some of the best I've had. Our server was on point. Always had our drinks topped off. I'm impressed!"}
{"text":"This is the best BBQ restaurant in the Chandler area. Excellent pulled pork, beef brisket, BBQ beans, and macncheese.

Service is just as good as the food and the restaurant has comfortable seating.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Best bbq I've had in AZ. Definitely recommend the different meat platter with two sides. Lots of food and great service which is a hit for me. Love it!!"}
{"text":"Wow!!! Yummy bbq. We had called ahead since 7 of us were coming. But when we got there they had no idea. Still service was amazing for was yummy. And a few of us shared the plates were huge. Price was awesome. Will have to be back, next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Well, I so badly wanted this place to be incredible. It was OK. Service was, eh... And the food, well lack luster. I had the 2 combo meal with the ribs and brisket. Brisket was OK, however the ribs were overcooked and salty. I had Mac and cheese and potatoes. They were both bland. I felt so awaful after my meal, as well as my friend that went with me. I actually got sick, which I never do. Sorry folks, but not going there again. :("}
{"text":"First, I'm not much of a BBQ snob. I like all styles; a bbq whore, I suppose. The only time I gripe is when it's just bad. 

Porkopolis is not bad at all. 
I tried a bit of the brisket, ribs, and pulled pork from my friends plate. Was quite tasty, I think I liked the brisket the best. The Brady sauces are not bad. A bit different than what I normally see/have, but hey, if everything was the same it would be boring!

I had the bbq nachos. Loads of chicken, lots of chips, cheese, etc.
However, it was just a bit *too* much cheese. I had basically cheese soup with unidentifiable objects in it towards the end. I would have liked about half that much queso, senor. 

My son had the mac and cheese, which of course I tried. Quite good, he liked it. But he's 4, what does he know? Better than Kraft :)

Overall, good BBQ. I only went there because a) Brady runs on about it all the time, and b) I was in the area. It's a bit of a drive from where I live, so I don't think I'd be going back unless there was a bbq bonanaza/wet tshirt contest/free beer thing going on. 

I would recommend it to friends, but I only know like 2 people out in that area and I'm pretty sure they've already gone to it."}
{"text":"The girlfriend and I went here for dinner.  I had read the reviews and I was not disappointed.  For being a weekend we were seated fast.  Our waitress was great and the food came out quickly.  I had one of the skillets and it was perfect.  I have to mention the moonshine and koolaid...as it was a drink she tried and very good.  For after dinner we did the waffle and ice cream.  It was very good"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now. Food is always great. Love that I found a nice clean casual BBQ spot.  Friendly service, and a reasonable price.  Absolutely recommend if you are in a BBQ mood. Get the Mac and Cheese side, it's a must. Best $1 add to a sandwich you can spend."}
{"text":"Brady's fat ass is finally right about somthing! The pulled pork is amazing, the sweet and smokey sauce is not as good as the hot and sweet though. I recommend asking for the hot and sweet sauce on the pulled pork, but honestly you can't go wrong iether way."}
{"text":"Came for a quick bite and ordered the Brady bacon burger because I was told it would be like having a double bacon cheeseburger as it is a large patty with bacon in it and bacon on it. The only thing I asked is for no bun and the condiments on the side. Well...I don't know if I was served the wrong meal or if it was a misrepresentation, but that's not what I got. 
Burger was supposed to have pepper jack, it had provolone. 
Burger was supposed to have bacon IN IT, no bacon in it. 
The burger itself was not the highest quality meat as well. I know because I eat free range meat as much as I can afford. 
The only thing saving this review is the French fries. They are some of the best I've tasted. 
Maybe the kitchen didn't like all the changes I made to the burger, but that's no excuse. Yes, I could have taken the food back, but I was in a hurry to get to a friend's party. I vote with my wallet. Most likely will not be eating there again. A shame, too. The fries were tasty. :-("}
{"text":"Good food. Small but nice draft beer selection. We will definitely be back. Would be 5 star, but thought prices a tad high. Had the combo meat sandwich, really good. Wife had bacon burger, really good as well. Some of best French fries in Phoenix imho. Smoked wing appetizer real good to. Again, will be back. Hope Porkopolis makes it in this space, a few others have failed here recently. Good BBQ not easy to find in the area.  This is great."}
{"text":"The best for BBQ. Redneck tacos are always a hit with anyone we bring with us. The apps are so good that we can hardly eat our actual dinner. Always have left overs. My wife usually gets the burro and loves it. I get the 3 or 4 meat sampler so I can share with the kids. The pulled pork is the best. Followed by the ribs and brisket. I usually throw chicken in the mix for the kids. It's good I'm just not a chicken fan. The kids like it though. My daughter says the skin is her favorite lol."}
{"text":"Good place or bbq... The brisket french dip sandwich was flavorful and had plenty of meat!!  The au-jus was flavorful too; kinda a surprise since Most au-jus is flavorless at other restaurants... 

What was not impressive was the fries; they just tasted generic and then they added this rub to em. The rub didnt hide the generic taste. 

Sweet tea is SWEEEEEEEEET  as fuck!!

I would come back if I ever visited this god forsaken state again...."}
{"text":"OMG!!!  I love bbq and typically travel to local bbq places all over Arizona. They smoke their food here and have it dialed in. I tried the three meat platter (Ribs, Brisket, and Pulled Pork) and the meat melted in my mouth... jalpeño mac-n-cheese and creamed corn was off the hook."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night about 9 pm after a long work day.
The staff was very helpful and friendly.  Beer was cold and the food was amazing.  Go hungry because the portions are big. I will be back soon"}
{"text":"Good food, and unlike many BBQ places they have a decent selection of sides. Salad was very good. The brisket was very good and I like their sauce selections. Server was friendly and attentive. Lots to like here. Will be back!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit here and it won't be my last....

First and foremost, the service was really good. Kelly was our server, he was friendly, personable and he seems to be very passionate about his job. Kudos!!!

We ordered the burnt ends app and pick 4 meat to split between 2 people. We wanted to as many of the meats as possible. The brisket is by far my favorite!

And to mention, the music was a perfect touch. Classic rock and classic southern rock....perfect to set the laid back atmosphere"}
{"text":"I was really impressed with all the concepts on the menu. It took me a while to decide what I wanted because everything looked so good and interesting. Our server was very patient and helpful.  When the food came out it looked delicious. I was really excited for that first bite of my sandwich but was a little disappointed. Everything was cooked fine. It all just seemed to be lacking flavor. My wife's nachos were the same. Everything looked delicious it just lacked the flavor I was hoping for. My fries however were very good.   Maybe we came on an off day."}
{"text":"Drove (400) miles from Los Angles to try this place, totally worth the 6+ hour drive.  Adrian was great and wonderful with service!!! Thank You for such delicious food and everything else.  A+++++ and"}
{"text":"My wife and I went in for lunch today at the Chandler location.  I  ordered the burnt ends and they were burnt, dry and cold.

We both ordered the lunch combo. I ordered the brisket, chicken and ribs with a side of beans, dirty rice and corn bread; the chicken was dry and tasted like turkey (they have turkey on the menu).  The beans reminded me of  ranch style can beans, the dirty rice was anything but dirty rice; it came out dry, cold and flavorless and the corn bread was dry and old tasting.

My wife ordered the chicken, ribs and pulled pork with mashed potatoes and corn bread; again her chicken was dry and tasted like turkey, the mashed potatoes were soft, slightly running and the texture of box mashed potatoes.

I have been in the food industry for over 35 years and have eaten at a lot bbq restaurants across the the United States and let's just say that after two bits of each item I looked at my wife and said I am sorry and asked for the check.  When we were asked if there was something wrong I explained to the server how bad the food was, she apologized but there was no management on duty other than the person behind the bar who came over to see what was wrong or if there was anything else she could do.  I explained my experience as well as the flavor profile of the food we just experienced, she became rude and standoffish stating that EVERYTHING IS MADE FROM SCRATCH AND IN HOUSE... 

As a chef I can tell you that her statements are not true; the food was dry and old tasting... and I wasted 45 dollars."}
{"text":"Very good BBQ! fall off the bone ribs, expertly cooked turkey and pull apart brisket, the Southwest chowder with pulled pork was incredible, I definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Went here with my wife about 2 months ago and we keep going back. Simply put, this is the best BBQ I have ever had. I love good BBQ, but this place takes it to a whole new level. The happy hour specials are awesome too. I had the brisket and pork sandwich the last two times we went there and it's AMAZING!"}
{"text":"my wife and I came here after driving by several times and boy am I glad we came here for dinner!  the place is kind of small inside but they also have a decently sized patio outside.  there's a full bar and some TVs inside for games.  of course, the food is the real draw here - I got the mixed meat sand which and my wife got the BBQ burger and both we're great!  the meat was juicy and fresh and the sauce was a great touch.  they had sweet tea on the menu and it wasn't as good as what I've had in Texas, but it was still a fair sight better than anything else I've had in Arizona."}
{"text":"Four of us came here on a Wednesday night for the first time. First off, our server, Dana, rocked! We told her it was our first time. She was bright, funny, and very knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered the burnt ends for an app. They came out exactly like Dana described. We quickly devoured them along with our first round of drinks. The entrees came out. Greg had the barbecued Jambalaya, Lynn had the skillet meal, Sue had the Cuban, and I had the Green Chile Pork Burrito. The entrees were all reasonably priced, the portions were huge! 3 of us took home boxes. We will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Went with the 3 meat plate: brisket,  pulled pork, and ribs. Brisket was fork tender, pulled pork was moist and delicious, and the ribs had an incedible smokey flavor. They even off burnt ends (ordering next time, a real treat for a bbq lover). Some of the best bbq in AZ!"}
{"text":"My friends thought I was unfair of my review because it just opened and I should have known better. Well, I didnt pay \"just opened restaurant\" price, but what the hell. Ill try again. This time we ate there, not takeout. Im avoiding the brisket sandwich but my friend ordered it anyway. He only had 2 full mouths of fat chunks and said \"thats just how it goes\".....for $13? No
 I got the burnt tips and mac n cheese. Very good. We sampled nearly everything and overall good. 
Why the 3 stars?  We would have drank more and dessert, if asked. Nope. It was busy and we felt we were being rushed out.
It just felt stuffy and uptight. To me upscale BBQ is like putting lipstick on a pig. Maybe it should be called \"Pork Off Pig Lips\". 
Sorry, can't do it again"}
{"text":"We just tried this place. We both had the French brisket sandwich. Super good! I got the bbq beans with it. Was more of a chili I think. Also very good :)"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!! We always come for happy hour for half off apps & get the nachos and quesadillas. The aioli sauce they put on top is amazing. Definitely one of my favorite places to eat!"}
{"text":"We love this place! The food is really good. The kids meals are affordable and huge! And the moonshine  (especially the peach) is the bomb. We always go back."}
{"text":"I ordered the two meat plate, Ribs and chicken. Chicken was dry and the ribs...oh my, they were so over cooked that they were rock hard. No edible meat on them. Rice was salty and the server seemed like it was her first day. First time there, and the last. Waste of money."}
{"text":"Outstanding food!!! The Nachos are awesome and probably the best we've ever had."}
{"text":"The hubby and I went to Porkopolis for dinner for the first time last week since they were pretty much the only place in Chandler besides Cork that was participating in spring Restaurant Week. They were in the $40 category but their offering included two entrees with a shared appetizer and dessert so we really got our moneys worth.

We started with the Burnt Ends appetizer which was basically chunks of brisket mixed up with their sweet barbeque sauce. The meat was a little fatty but it had a good smokey flavor to it and the sauce was pretty good so we both really enjoyed this dish. One of the entree options was the 3 meat platter which is normally $19 so that made it such a fantastic deal for RW that we both decided to order that. I got the turkey, pulled pork, and brisket as my meats with beans and cornbread for sides. He got brisket, baby back ribs (1/4 rack) and chicken with fries and cornbread for his two sides. So, between the two of us we had a ton of food and got to try a lot of different items. I have to say my favorite was the brisket. They know how to do it right here. Good smoke ring and it was served with a slice of white bread - Texas style. And they have two sauces that you can put on yourself, one is a little sweet and the other one has some good heat to it. I chose the latter and it was fantastic! I am also really happy that they offered corn bread since this just goes with good bbq in my mind but unfortunately theirs was a little dry. The beans I ordered were delicious, though; nice and tender with a fantastic tangy and spicy sauce. And the fries my hubby got were addicting; you could really tell they were fresh cut, not frozen.

The place itself is a little small and there is not much in the way of decor. It looks very new which is nice because it was clean but on the downside it just didn't have a whole lot of personality. We sat in the bar area and so I believe our server was the bartender who was stuck acting as waitress and hostess as well since apparently the other server didn't show up for work that evening. I wouldn't have minded the slow service ordinarily, especially since she did warn us up front and apologized for it but unfortunately I had plans with my sister later and ended up being late because it took us over an hour between being seated until when our food arrived. We ordered the apple crisp for our dessert but had to have it boxed up to go... which meant I didn't get to taste it since the hubby ate it on his own while I was gone :0)

So, really not the best experience but I will definitely give them another try since the food was so good and they are pretty close by."}
{"text":"When looking for bar b q look no further!
First time visit last night. Omg the service the quality the portion size are matched by none  I've found in south east valley. 
Bring an appetite. They provide take home box accordingly. 
Only complaint is limited choice of sauces."}
{"text":"**UPDATE:  I've been back and service was great as usual and the Brisket Tips were delicious!! I must have gotten an off batch the first time. I'm going back again today. **

Being from Kansas City I am definitely picky about my BBQ, especially out here in Arizona. It's been hard to find good BBQ. 

I give them a 3 1/2 stars due to the super oily brisket bites and inches of oil in the bottom of my Togo bag. Without that it would've been a higher rating.
So, last night I was starving and I had a craving so I tried out Porkopolous. I ordered to-go, everyone was nice, good service for the time I was there. 

I ordered the Brisket tips app, pick 3 meats with 2x ribs and Pulled pork. 
1. The ribs were perfectly cooked, just wish they had a little more smokey flavor. But good none the less. 
2. The pulled pork was the best I've had for as long as I can remember!!
3. Brisket bites...I was definitely less than happy with these. Not because they didn't taste good, they were amazing...but here is my issue-I live 6 minutes from the restaurant, and by the time I drove home and opened up the bag, there was at least an once of grease in the bottom of the bag. I had to sift everything in the bag out of oil from the brisket bites. 
**as for the bites, flavor was amazing! However, they were sitting in about an inch+ of oil in their Togo container, and Slovene half of them were so dried out they were inedible. It was saddening because the ones I could eat were great (after separating them from the oil). In their defense, I did order at 7:56, and they close at 9pm, but they had it ready quickly and I picked it up at 8:15pm. So j realize it was the end of the night, but it is frustrating to throw away half of your appetizer. Had I not be so tired I would have driven back and returned it. 

I do want to try them and the brisket app again to see if it was just an off day, but the oily $10 brisket bites were a let down."}
{"text":"Pretty good BBQ joint, local business. My husband wanted to try it because it was opened by Brady Bogen on 97.9 KUPD. Our waiter was amazing, and funny. We were able to seat ourselves which was nice.

We started the meal off with the quesadilla which was really good. Probably one of the best items I ate. We both got the 2 meat platter and both got brisket (3 oz.) And baby back ribs (1/4 rack). For sides I did garlic mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. He did corn bread and mac and cheese. 

Their rub they use on the ribs is kind of strong. You get used to it as you eat, but it's definitely a slight assault to your senses. And i'm not sure i'm a fan of the mac and cheese, I think it's cooked with jalapenos which I normally don't mind but it was an overwhelming flavor. 

I really loved the brisket, and the garlic mashed potatoes were amazing! I'd go back again and maybe try one of the sandwiches =)"}
{"text":"We come here just for the burnt ends. Everything we have tried has been pretty delicious, this time we had the ribs and quesadilla. Our serve Stacey was attentive and pleasant."}
{"text":"This place is amazing, best service in chandler but don't get the take out food taste totally different then in house."}
{"text":"My daughter and I tried Porkopolis last night.  It is a hidden gem! Best BBQ I have had in Arizona by far.  The service was excellent and the food exceeded my expectations.  I had the pulled pork sandwich with jalapeno cole slaw and my daughter had the ribs and baked beans.  We will definitely return with other family members!"}
{"text":"My bf and I love going here when I visit him from out of town.... his favorite is the pulled pork and I love their ice cream sandwiches. The ice cream sandwiches are literally to die for. Last time we went we were too full, so we ordered one to go! The Hoochie Mama is my fav drink, so yummy. The inside of the restaurant is great, lots of tvs and great service!"}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ.  Nice cross of KC and Texas.  Started with fried pickles which I'd highly recommend.  Nice and spicy.  Main course was meat combo sandwich.  Soooo good.  Finished off with sweet potato pancake dessert....OMG.  thought i was full but managed to dig in on that.  Im coming back."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I just had our first taste of this place and have already decided it's our new BBQ spot. AMAZING BBQ and AMAZING service!! Great price for such a huge amount of food!! My mouth is still watering!"}
{"text":"Have been hearing about this place for awhile and thought we would give it a try! Good food and friendly staff. Loved the BBQ nachos and Ribs!! One short coming is staff was a little slow on retrieving plates from table and handing out the bill!! But I would recommend this place to anyone!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered pulled pork sandwich and burnt ends for lunch. We both got fat trimmings and no meat until we complained. Service was good and replaced both orders with what we should have been served the first time. It always amazes me that restaurants try to get rid of stuff that should have been thrown away by covering it with sauce and hoping you will not choke trying to eat it."}
{"text":"I had been wanting to come here but I live in the West Valley and it is a challenge to get here.  I recieved an invitation thru the website to attend a TV Show taping, had the day off from my second job, so I thought this was a great opportunity.

I was not disappointed!  OMG!  The brisket quesadilla was delicious!  I saved some of the appertizer portion to take home because it was such a large order!  Also, the prices are reasonable!  I ordered extra food to take home.

The bartender was nice, knowledgable and good looking!

I will come back here and the Chandler location, as much as I can!"}
{"text":"First time here and I have to say, it's fantastic. Met Brady, mostly because I walked in wearing a Michigan Football jersey, but also because he's a very cool and gracious host and it looked like he generally makes the rounds and shakes hands with his customers. Great energy, amazing food, cool atmosphere, even if it is an Ohio fan hangout. ;) Seriously, though, really enjoyed the place and especially the food. Thanks, Brady!"}
{"text":"I read reviews and was excited to go. I was so disappointed and nauseous after eating here. The pickles were so salty we couldn't eat them. My entree was the brisket sandwich and it was all fat. Not a single piece of meat. I didn't even touch my plate and instead of the waitress asking what was wrong she picked up my plate. Will never go back here."}
{"text":"We've been a handul of times now, and we always have a wonderful experience! Love the pulled pork, and their bbq sauces are great! It's nice coming here for the laid back environment, and being able to relax and enjoy some good food."}
{"text":"What a great place! Met some friends here for dinner and all of our meals were amazing!!! I had the meatloaf and would suggest it to anyone! We also had the salad, 2 meat tray and Cuban sandwich! All were delicious. We also had all of their moonshine specialty drinks and they couldn't have been better. Our waiter Dan was also amazing! Very knowledgable and witty, super great guy! Thanks Porkopolis we will be regulars!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here before and the food was good but not tonight. We ordered for pick up and the most of the meat was very dry. My son could not even eat the brisket it was that bad. Not sure we will go back"}
{"text":"Sorry, this is very unfortunate.  Was really looking forward to trying this place (KUPD fan).  Take out order for a small group for the NFL Football Championship games.  Expected it to be busy but business was extremely slow. And this is why: First off everything was extremely salty.  Smoked wings= very over cooked, actually so over cooked they were hard as a rock.  Same with the brisket, over cooked, tough, and burnt.  Opposite for the fried pickles, soggy like mush.  Most of the food was thrown away before the end of the first quarter!  Would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"First time here had heard about it from the radio. All the food that we ordered was amazing! The brisket was moist and fell apart in your mouth!"}
{"text":"This bbq place was very promising the smoke flavor in the ribs & dry rub was spot on. It was very good I felt like the ribs could've been a little bit more tender fall off the bone but for the flavor they were a good amount for the price. The sliced brisket did not have a lot of fat on it but it was a little dry so they may want to before slicing the brisket maybe put it in some type of au jus sauce. The lemonade were really good they did have drink specials were PBR was a dollar. The kids portions were really big portions for kids , my nephew could not eat all his food. Service was moderately slow but it was really packed and they only had two servers. They didn't have very good Kool-Aid and very good Southern Sweet tea. For dessert we order the sweet potato pancakes with crusted pecans and caramel and ice cream.  To me the pancakes were made with too much eggs so they were more of eggy texture then pancake batter texture. The caramelized pecans and ice cream were awesome."}
{"text":"I am a mechanic that works down the street from this place. I've heard about it many times on the radio but never realized it was just a few blocks away.  I was so happy with the food here. The BBQ was amazing. Fries with the seasoning on them was fantastic. They are gonna get a lot more of my lunch break business plus any other I can give. I would even fix their cars if I was paid in this food. Some of the best BBQ I've had in a while. Thank you."}
{"text":"Don't waste your time and money if you're looking for REAL BBQ. The food here isn't even close to the real stuff. Went for Happy Hour and ordered the \"burnt ends\" $12.00, they weren't part of the Happy Hour deals. Not impressed at all. Asked for them without sauce. Any BBQ place that drowns  their meat in BBQ sauce is trying to hide something. The burnt ends didn't even have the faintest taste of smoke. They also have \"fried gumbo\" on the menu. Gumbo to me is a stew. This is their \"twist\"?? on gumbo. creative twist on a Southern favorite. Lightly battered fried shrimp, catfish and okra seasoned with Brady's rub and a side of ranch & bbq aioli.
Just not what I was looking for having been to other BBQ restaurants in the Valley.
Wish I could give this a better rating."}
{"text":"I and my girlfriend got a chance to out Porkopolis during Restaurant Week 2015. I'm glad we made the trip as the food is wonderful. I don't think I've ever had pulled pork on bruschetta but is just as flavorful as it sounds."}
{"text":"First time trying it and we will be back. Very friendly staff and meats were very good. Only thing we didn't enjoy was the cole slaw but that might be because we like a little more zip to it.
Food was served quickly and hot. The portions were bigger that I thought they would be and needed to take home food."}
{"text":"We are visiting from out of town and my brother saw something on food network about this place so we came here. We ordered pork rinds with the spicy sauce. They were eh and they sauce was like miracle whip. For dinner we ordered the platter. The ribs were ok but not great and same with the pulled pork. The brisket was terrible. So dry it was almost impossible to swallow. The best thing about dinner was the mac and cheese. I let our waiter know how terrible the meat was and all he said was I'll let them know... he was a great waiter but to me, I would try to make things right for the customers. For the 50 some odd dollars I spent I should have at least had palatable food....."}
{"text":"Good stuff! 1st time my girl and I had been there and they did not let us down. Brady and his friend's restaurant lives up to the hype. Though I'm not necessarily a fan of pork I gave in and went for the brisket. Two words: DO IT!!"}
{"text":"With a name like Porkopolis, how could I not stop? 

I believe this is a newer location for them - there's another in the area as well. The space is small (maybe 30 tables and a smaller bar) and located in a strip mall. That said, it's clean & comfortable inside. 

I picked a 2 meat plate with pulled pork and smoked turkey - you could also choose chicken (on the bone), brisket, ribs or sausage. Their pulled pork was really juicy and had a nice smoke flavor - I didn't need to use any sauce at all on this. The smoked turkey is cut thick - like a ham steak and seared on the grill for a minute or so - again, it was nice and juicy which is hard to get on such a lean meat. Meals come with 2 sides - I picked mashed potatoes (real, delicious!) and jalapeno mac and cheese which was creamy and just spicy enough. 

Know that portions are HUGE, especially the sides. I ate as much as I could (because it was all really, really good) and had plenty left on the plate. For $18, you could probably feed 2 people. Service was really nice too - the staff was friendly and didn't make me sit at the bar which usually happens when dining solo. 

AZ isn't known for their BBQ but Porkopolis was as good as places I've been in Nashville and Texas for sure. My one dislike (and this is a subjective, personal preference thing) is that both of their sauces are REALLY, REALLY sweet. The \"spicy\" is a total sugar bomb and something I honestly couldn't have more than a drop of. Fortunately, the meats were delicious on their own and really didn't need any sauce. My suggestion would be adding a Texas style tangy sauce for those who aren't sugar lovers.

Other than that, I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"This place is great. Good food. Good service. Good drinks. I highly recommend their Mac and cheese with pulled pork added in (don't think it's an official menu item). Also, their breakfast sandwich and breakfast hash are very good. Their bartenders are friendly and make great bloody Mary's and tasty moonshine cocktails."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Especially enjoyed the pulled pork with some spicy barbeque sauce. They have made an effort to make the sides more interesting than those at most BBQ places and it definitely paid off."}
{"text":"Great food, great music and even better happy hour prices!! Would highly recommend the brisket. Amazing!!"}
{"text":"The pork tacos were such a hit we order another round. Ribs compete with some of the best in town. Service was very attentive but not a bother.  Have been back several times."}
{"text":"you know that feeling when you walk into a restaurant already knowing the food is going to be delicious? This place made me feel that way. I put my hand on the door smelling the sweet and dense aroma of barbeque and knew I had to open fast. The restaurant was impressively clean and perfect for a family outing. There is a nice and open bar with large television screens for those who want to sip on a beer or two to chat as well. 

My mother wanted to have a drink but wasnt sure what she'd like. Our waitress, however, didn't drink so she couldn't make any real suggestions. Instead, she brought the bartender over to our table and he went through the entire list trying to please her thirst the best he could. 

Tried the Red-Neck Tacos and the 4 meat combo. 
The tacos were very unique with jalapeno cole slaw (the best!) and corn bread tasting shell...it was more like a corn cake (pretty good). loved the pulled pork with on top, made for a perfect combination. 
For the four meat combo we tried the brisket, pulled pork, and two orders of ribs. Was a little weary about trying the brisket because of other reviews saying it was way too dry but surprisingly I loved it! It was one of my favorites, the pulled pork being my favorite. The ribs were good but tasted more like ham than a rib. 
The side Macaroni and Cheese = THE BEST and jalepeno cole slaw also delicious. 

the meats did get me to feel a little queezy but that's what the bread is there for I guess. I didn't eat anything other than the meat because...that's just how I am. The combo did, however, come with pickles which I devoured. Asked for more and they brought out a huge side plate full of them haha

would go back during happy hour if time permits! 3:30-6:30 M-F!"}
{"text":"Update! We've been back a couple times to try and give it a shot. Food was hot, flavorful and out in a timely manner. Service was improved. It was a quiet night but still great atmosphere and kiddo friendly. Overall improved and we would eat there again."}
{"text":"We have been here twice now when in town and never disappointed. Service is great and food is remarkable. We will be back."}
{"text":"First visit for dinner tonight. Ordered meat combo sandwich. Brisket, pulled pork on a hoagie roll with jalapeño coleslaw. 
Absolutely delicious, meat very tender and flavorful. Coleslaw not overpowering but really enhanced the sandwich.
Dirty rice wasn't as good as the sandwich but the sandwich was so big the side dish was not necessary.
Took home 1/2 the sandwich and most of the rice.
Reasonable prices. Excellent service.
Can't wait to return to try the chicken skillet."}
{"text":"First time here. Not a big fan of BBQ but this place surprised me. We had the burnt ends, fried pickles, Cuban sandwich, and Mac n cheese. Everything tasted homemade and fresh. Highlights: Burnt ends were in a tangy sauce, fried pickles didn't have too much breading, sandwich had great bread, and I could've eaten a tub of the Mac n cheese. Definitely want to try the cornbread next time! Our server was great and meal came out quickly."}
{"text":"I wanted to try a little of everything so I had the sampler...pork bbq, brisket, and ribs. Everything was very good..my favorite was the brisket. Ribs had lots of tender meat. The bbq sauce was delicious as well.  

The sides I had were mac and cheese and fries. The mac and cheese was very bland and I would not order that again. Fries were nothing special at all either. Next time I'll try different sides. 

One last thing, this place is way better than Joe's BBQ in gilbert."}
{"text":"I was getting some work done on my car at Walmart and I figured it'd be nice to try something new, so this popped up and was a 10 minute walk. I am a glad I went!

They have a outdoor patio section but it doesn't get much sun. It was still nice though.

The server told me about the day's specials, and it was a brisket sandwich with Au jus sauce. Mmmm it was so delicious and tender and tasty. The cole slaw was good and fresh as well. I still think about this sandwich even days later."}
{"text":"I give this place a two bc of the service and half of the food that was ordered at the table it was just OKAY and/or dry.. the three meals out of the 7 food that we ordered were pretty good.. which was the tenderloin with mashed potatoes and green beans, Mac and cheese pulled pork skillet and the jambalaya... we also ordered a Mac and cheese for my boyfriends nephew but had to send it back because no where on the Kids MENU or the waitress said the kids Mac and Cheese contained Jalapeños... the Brisket sandwich that was ordered was dried out and the two hamburgers were just okay nothing out of the ordinary.. the waitress that was serving our table was really bad... she kept leaving without waiting for the other people at our table to finish ordering or would walk away before someone can tell her what kind of drink they wanted or a refill.... so she did A LOT of walking back and fourth!! She's also the one who didn't mention there was jalapeños in the kids Mac and cheese .. so she had to take that back and get more of a kid friendly Mac and cheese... would I make come back willing next time? Probably not... if I was in the neighborhood then maybe I'll do a to go order on one of the three foods that only three of us enjoyed tonight..."}
{"text":"Place is bomb BBQ!  I get the brisket salad and it's seriously one of the best salads I've ever had!  Strawberries, candied pecans, brisket (I get it lean) and blue cheese!  Then I drizzle the Hot and Sweet BBQ sauce (which I can't decide if it's better than the SweetnSmokey)!  Scott the bartender and server is way cool too!  Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"I stop in for some dinner after working out across the street. My waitress said that I could get something to go fairly quick so I ordered the three meat platter. I chose macaroni and cheese and coleslaw to go with my three meat platter.  When I received it I saw her put the sides in my to go bag and I noticed they were very small. I asked her if I could get a couple of more khosla to go with it since there was three of us eating and she said they're $3 each. Disgusted with that I left and called the manager. He said oh that's a five ounce serving which it was really less than 2 and we have to charge for that I said forget it. once I got home we opened up the 3 meat platter which had pulled pork smoked brisket and baby back ribs. Once we started to eat the meat seemed dry and the macaroni and cheese had absolutely no flavor and the cole slaw was mediocre.
I really believe that we got yesterdays meet that was left in the cooler overnight and not very fresh and the crowd that was in there was not a crowd there was only about 6 people I am sure I will never go back. 
If the manager would have taken care of me and the meat would have been a little better it would be worth visiting a second time. Good luck with your experience I hope it is better."}
{"text":"Bummer...I really tried to love this place. I'm all about supporting local businesses vs. chains, but I won't go back. I've tried this several times and the inconsistency of food quality is a real bummer...

One visit the burnt ends are crispy, delicious, meat candy and the next visit you're served a bowl full of chunks of beef fat. (Brisket varies along these same lines.) One visit the bbq beans are sweat and tangy with robust flavors and the next they taste like ranch style beans from a can. Just not worth it for the price."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment eating here. Service was prompt and friendly but couldn't make up for the food. We had BBQ nachos and should have stuck with only that. My husband and I ordered Cincinnati Skillets, his beef and mine pork. The burnt ends were beef jerky in texture so all flavor was dried out. The pork just tasted funny but the mac and cheese was good. We ended up throwing out our leftovers since my husband threw up an hour after eating and as of now is still praying to the porcelain gods. I only hope the food improves but I won't risk visiting again."}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of BBQ in general, but this was delicious.  We shared a four meat platter, and both the pulled pork and brisket were phenomenal.  Both are items I'll come back for in the future.  We tried the sweet and Smokey sauce as well as the hot and sweet sauce.  Both were very good.  I preferred the hot and sweet, but quite truthfully, the meat was tasty enough to eat without the sauce.
Great casual atmosphere with great good at a reasonable price.  Bravo."}
{"text":"I'm a hugh fan of 98kupd and I tried this place once and I'm hooked every was great the service and the food was perfect"}
{"text":"Demolished my Red Neck Tacos and side of creamy cheddar Mac and Cheese, so good! Awesome restaurant set up with grocery store type doors. Tons of items on the menu to choose from along with a slew of side dishes."}
{"text":"The meat is not smoked just baked I think.  The brisket is very fatty any lacks taste , the chicken is tasteless.  The Mac & Cheese is on par with boxed with some jalapeños added, the corn bread was cold, the cole slaw was so so. The buns for the sandwiches are very good.  If you are in the area just go to Joes BBQ, much better and real smoked meats."}
{"text":"Ok, this is going to be a long one. First we will start with the creamed corn. Big crunchy kernels, actual cream, jalapenos. It was sweet, spicy, and delicious.
The fries...instead of salted they are spicy! Spicy and incredible...but then you add the sweetened ketchup! HOLY FRIES BATMAN! Looks like there is some brown sugar in the ketchup, making the spiciness of the fries POP!
The pulled pork has a very distinct smoky flavor...some mesquite...but not overwhelming...they definitely cut it with some other wood keeping it not overpowering, but almost perfect. You could see the bark even though it was pulled. And the spices! Not too spiced that you couldn't taste the meat, but great flavor. It didn't need sauce, but added some sweet hot bbq sauce after the first bite. I was in heaven! This was perfect pulled pork.
The brisket was perfectly smoked with no need for sauce at all. Good bark, great seasoning, not too dry....OMG this is great brisket.
Now the ribs. They were smoked to perfection and covered in a sweet smoky sauce ( not the spicy one). They were almost fall off the bone, but not quite. The meat was reconstituted and...and...perfect. This was a perfect BBQ rib.
So between the BBQ Nachos, fries, creamed corn, pulled pork, and brisket, I'd say this was an amazing BBQ Joint. But then you add the ribs. When I say they were perfect, I do know what I am talking about. This is the BEST BBQ JOINT in Arizona! I can't wait to come back!
I give this place 5 stars, two thumbs up, and worth a drive from Tucson!"}
{"text":"Came here as I had read an article about this place and the reviews were good.  I went with the smoked chicken wings just to get an idea of the flavors and seasonings they use.  On the positive side, the food was hot out of the smoker and the skin was crisp.  However, there was way too much seasoning and salt flavor - the salt penetrated all the way to the bone of the chicken wing it was so intense.  The wings came with ranch dressing which was very basic.  The BBQ sauces were tasty and I mixed the spicy pineapple one with their sweet/smoky sauce.  The rating is more like a 2.5, but I'll go with a 2 as I won't be visiting this place anytime soon as there are several other great BBQ options."}
{"text":"This was our first visit here. We were greeted promptly and seated right away. Our server was very helpful and was able to answer our questions regarding menu items. We ordered from the happy hour menu and were very pleasantly surprised at both the quality and portion size of our selections. As we first were seated the music seemed to be fairly loud but after asking if they could soften it a bit they took care of it immediately. Even as the place filled up shortly after we got there our server was very helpful and kept our drinks coming without us ever having to wait. Just as we were about to leave we noticed all the bottles of sauces line up on a shelf and found out they were available for retail sale so we did purchase some to take home. We will return here for sure and would highly recommend to friends."}
{"text":"A friendly Yelp challenge was put in front of me and as promised, I was able to make another trip out to Porkoplis with a coworker before the end of the week. 

I talked up the menu options and BBQ itself to convince them to come with and just about everything meet our expectations. 

Atmosphere is laid back and casual and if you have time, grab a spot at the bar and indulge in a beverage with the TV's in easy viewing. 

I went with the Combo Brisket Pork Sandwich with the slaw on the side. The slaw I was told had a little kick to it so I wasn't sure if it was going to be overpowering so I gauged and just added to my liking. I complimented it with the Jalapeno Mac and Cheese as my side... which you would think would be spicy, but wasn't, just jalapeno flavor with some small bites in it. 

My coworker went with the Lunch Combo that included the brisket & pork with a side of cornbread.

One of my favorite items is the pork skillet but that's on the dinner menu. If u ask politely & if not to busy, I'm sure they can accommodate. 

Sauces at the table add sweet or spicy to the mix but are good if you like to have some BBQ with your sauce. Looking forward to the next visit!"}
{"text":"We love this place! The food is spot on & the service is outstanding. We always feel welcomed and have never once had a bad experience. Happy hour specials rock and they have a $2 beer special daily. Best bartenders in town! Matt & Brady know how to operate a great family business and their care shows in every aspect of the business. The catering is fantastic too! From small backyard gatherings to corporate Christmas parties, it's always been great and everyone has been blown away by the awesome eats! Great job guys; keep up the good work!! 

Update! 
Still happy!! Matt & the gang totally saved the day today with a last minute catering disaster. I knew I could count on them to rescue me. They never ever disappoint :) 
Thanks for everything! See ya for dinner again real soon!"}
{"text":"Been hearing the hype on the radio show for a while now. Drove an hour to try some hyped BBQ.

I really wanted to love the place. Honestly it was severely average. Let me be fair and say that if they had one closer, I would be an occasional customer, maybe once or twice per year. Since they are so far, I won't likely be back. Don't think it's because of the distance. This fat boy will drive for HOURS to eat somewhere awesome. I plan my vacations around food. The food isn't worth a long drive.

My brisket was dry and it needed a fork and knife. I think as BBQ connoisseurs we can likely all agree that brisket should NEVER need a knife. Fork tender, pull apart, what ever you want to describe as your idea of proper brisket cooking, this was none of them.

Mac n Cheese was pretty good.
Fried pickles were pretty good
Smoked wings were okay too


Maybe I went on an off day. Or maybe they have the power of a funny radio show to influence traffic."}
{"text":"I live in Surprise and made the hour trek to Chandler just for Porkopolis. So worth it! My boyfriend and I both got the two meat plate. He got Turkey and pulled chicken with the BBQ beans. I got the baby back ribs and brisket with Mac and cheese. Nothing disappointed! The Mac and cheese was ridiculous! It was all cheese! Was almost hard to get a bite without having cheese strings dripping down my chin. In my book that's a fantastic thing! The baby backs were literally falling off the bone. Also they had stevia in the raw for my delicious black Berry and jasmine iced tea. High class! I even saw Brady and John Holmberg eating lunch at the bar, though it embarrassed my boyfriend so much at just the thought of me saying hi, I didnt. That was my only regret of the visit! We got out of there at only $23 and change. Great price for both of us leaving stuffed! The service was quick, friendly and attentive. I give the highest of recommendations for Porkopolis!"}
{"text":"OMGosh... Must try! Just left and I can not wait to let the world know they need to get into this place. I'm a Texas girl and always have something to say about BBQ. My boyfriend got the Brisket French Dip, the brisket fell apart in your mouth! So good
I had the Pulled Pork Sandwich, like I said I'm from Texas and very picky about my pork and it was nothing less then amazing.

Only complaint I have is that I don't have an extra stomach to eat more!"}
{"text":"The drinks were great, service was great how ever ran out of ribs, brisket so never got try kinda disappointing as whole reason why I want to go.. sobhade a sampler platter with burnt ends which i dont think did it justice...."}
{"text":"Very good bbq. Prices are very reasonable. I have never left hungry. I normally go for the pulled pork, it is shredded perfectly, not so much that it falls out of tye tasty bun, but not chunky. I hate chunky. Comes with a splash of bbq sauce on it, not too much to make you think they're hiding something. Bbq sauce on table is 2 flavors, neither are scorch your mouth. Brisket sammy is awesome, quesadilla was dumdum good. 3 big screens for sports on. A full bar. 

One thing that really STANDS OUT LIKE SOMEONE SCREAMING IN CAPS, is the outstanding service. It is some of the best I've gotten in Az. They'll toss the ball around with you if you're feeling snarky. 

My drink has never been empty too long without a friendly refill offer. They also offer me a to go refill. 

If you are a fan of Famous Dave's prepared before it hits the back of the restaurant, this may not be the place for you. 

Thanks Porkopolis for the good food, and if the painting of Japanese fart war goes missing.....I swear its not in my man cave."}
{"text":"We met up with the entire family for dinner here. My sister picked it out based on the reviews from Yelp and my sister said she's been here and it was good. So far so good we ordered the fried pickle and it was ok and the pork grinds which was just a bag of pork grinds opened up and put on a dish, so yeah.

Most of us ordered either the the 3 meat dish or 5 meat dish. Sides that we ordered were fries which were good, jalapeño mac and cheese was really good, corn bread was good & good size portion and creamy corn don't order that. 

I had the pulled pork sandwich which was perfect didn't have too much sauce on it. You can add more they leave different types of BBQ sauce on the table for you to add. Everyone seem to enjoy their dishes."}
{"text":"Red headed server is super nasty and things she's cool \"you work in a barbecue place and you're over 30 take a look at your life\" food is mediocre at best there's a nasty bartender too overweight conceited older gentleman who smokes an e cigarette and thinks he has cool tattoos but he's a huge tool pretty horrible place all around"}
{"text":"Came here on a recommendation from a friend. Plastic was found in both meals ordered. My meal has several small plastic strips in the pulled pork. My girlfriends sandwhich had a 3-4 inch long top from a plastic bag. Food did come out very quick, concerned pre-made and heated to order? Manager had a bad attitude about the returned food. Offered only to comp one meal when neither of us ate. Came back threw check on the table said \"thanks\" and left.  No charge on either meal however very bad experience.  Not sure about a return vist. Recomend to check food before eatting."}
{"text":"Came here after a day of traveling from New York. Great food and service. Had enough food to take back for lunch tomorrow."}
{"text":"This was our first and definitely last time here. Decided to try it because of the Yelp reviews... Big mistake! Came in a couple hours before they closed and we were the only people in the restaurant for the hour I was there, that should tell you something.

I ordered fried pickles which were pretty good followed by a meat trio of turkey, brisket, and ribs. The turkey and brisket barely had any taste and were both dry. When I got to the ribs I wished they could have been as subpar as the other meats. They were very dry and salty and topped with the worse BBQ sauce I've ever had. The ribs were completely inedible, they were disgusting and tasted old. This was the first time in my life that I've asked the waiter to take an item off of my order, which thankfully he did! The service was really good and the waiter was attending. They advertised \"craft beer revolution\" I wouldn't call one craft beer on draft and six in bottles a \"revolution\" I call it disappointing. 

I see other one star reviews of others who have had similar experiences. Not sure where the five star reviews came from... Think twice before trying this place."}
{"text":"I enjoyed this place. Went w a large group and were seated promptly. Since it was an odd time, after lunch but a while before dinner, there weren't too many other people there so we were able to push tables together. The waiter was a nice gentlemen who kept our drinks filled and checked in on us plenty. I got the pulled pork and brisket combo. Side of Mac n cheese. It was delicious and ample. And at lunch the price was sure right. I think it was maybe 12 bucks? The Mac had a smoky green chile taste to it which I liked but some of the younger kids at the table were a little taken aback. I'd recommend!"}
{"text":"Visited this location last night for the first time. Food and staff were excellent. Great BBQ all around the table. The ice cream sandwich was worth going by itself but the BBQ is why we were there. Brady even said hello to us as we left. Be back next week."}
{"text":"Service is good and friendly.
The Turkey is great.
The chicken was dry.
The brisket was delicious.
1/2 of the rib was good.
The sauce is different.
Great Mac and cheese.
I would like to return and try the other stuff on the menu."}
{"text":"Came for lunch, and food and service was great. I had the redneck tacos (really good!), and my boyfriend had a BBQ burger. We loved both! Only negative would be that the beer list wasn't that great, and they didn't have all of the beers listed. We will be back!"}
{"text":"We went to the NHRA Drag races last weekend and thought it was a good time to finally try this place. 

The service was great - we were greeted promptly and our server was attentive.   However - it seemed half the food on each plate was cold.  The mash was good - but cold.  The brisket tastes fabulous but was cold.  The ribs were great and served hot, the chicken was good and served hot, the beans were good and served hot.  So in short - the food was good but it was hit or miss on temperature.  

Further - we paid just about $60.00 for lunch.  It has cloth napkins which matches the bill but it seems they want it to be a more casual place.   There were more employees than customers which caused a \"gathering\" at the food bar in the back of the dining room.  They seemed to be having a lot of fun.  

It's certainly over priced OR they need to change it up so the food and restaurant are more in line with such high ticket items.  

I'd go back - but only if someone else is buying."}
{"text":"Super disappointed. After reading the reviews I ordered the burnt ends. They came out right away which was a red flag. I could tell they had been microwaved. It also seemed like they mixed old meat with slightly fresher (fresher, but not fresh) meat. Some oft the pieces were as hard as rocks while others were burnt on the outside but still tender on the inside. The burnt ends meal definitely has potential, but it seems like the chef pawned off 4 day old leftovers on me. 

I also had the platter. The pulled pork and ribs were decent, but nothing to write home about. 

I'll give it an extra star due to the good service and well mixed drinks."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the best brisket in town. Absolutely delicious. Fun family atmosphere. Great conversation with the staff."}
{"text":"This review is for my third and probably last visit.  The first two were ok but not outstanding.  Unfortunately the third was awful.  The positives: friendly owner, reasonable prices, good service.  The negatives:  the brisket was over cooked and very, very dry.  I was only able to eat a third of it and only after very liberal squirts of bbq sauce.  The ribs were inedible....it was liked they were way over grilled a few days ago, frozen, and then put in a micro. One taste and I was done.  The beans as a side were mediocre.  Server asked if I wanted a box since 75% of my plate was still full....oh no!  After paying I gave my thoughts on the meal to the server and asked him to convey my thoughts to the owner.   Nice facility, nice folks, but this time the food was awful."}
{"text":"Outside of being a little crowded and noisy, this is a great place for barbecue. The plates are plentiful and the meat tasty. The sauce is quite good even to me, who usually avoids barbecue sauce preferring straight meat. We had brisket, ribs, and \"burnt ends\"; all three were moist  and tasty. The string beans were unexceptional, but the pickles were outstanding. The ambiance is Scottsdale and the music soft rock. The staff are pleasant and smile, which is nice. Have to try the rest of the menu, but in keeping with that Scottsdale quality there are no links and blah white bread."}
{"text":"Very good bbq. The meats were,very tender and rib meat fell from the bone.  Prices were reasonable and staff helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"Okay, pork sandwich is very tender. Appropriate amount of Salt making your mouth water and want more. The house Barbeque sauce is awesome as well, some flavors really popped when eating this with the pork. However the pork is so good by itself it doesn't need bbq. 

The only con to my order was the Mac and cheese. It was almost water on the bottom... Not very appeasing. the cheese on top that they added and melted was the only good part. It was not very cheesy.
 Mind you this was ordered via take out. 

Overall, seems like a great place to go eat again, so I shall."}
{"text":"1st timer and they met all my expectations. The atmosphere was casual which is great if you have kids. Staff was friendly and attentive the entire duration of our visit.  Can't recall the name if our hist because we had so many lol. When she was busy there were several others who checked in with us and even played with my boys. Terrific food, friendly people, and the check wasn't bad either (2 adult entrées + drinks,  2 kids plates, an appetizer and a drink from the bar less than $55 not including tip).... ..... 10 stars!"}
{"text":"Ok gave this place another shot. Picked up 1lb of Brisket at 6pm on a Friday night. I assumed they would have the fresh brisket out and ready to roll.

Drive home (15mins) opened up the brisket for me and the hubby and it was by far the most dry and overcooked Brisket we have ever had!!!! My hubby is a bIGTIME BBQ nut and he said this Briaket had easily been sitting since the morning.

Why would you serve this to people and charge them this much!?!

Anyone can do Pulled pork. It can sit out for MANY hours and still taste good. Brisket, not so much.

Bummed."}
{"text":"Mixed feeling about this place.. 1. Heard LOTS of great things via word of mouth... But after this experience, I reached back to those promoting this place to me, to find out the original opening n quality of this place hasn't withstood the same quality and most of my peers wouldn't go back.. 

A+ - Kiltlifter on TAP (even though AB bought them out.. good to see still available at most locations. 

Appetizer: Fried Pickles. (DON'T DO IT) extremely Salty. non edible salty,,, just gross... 

Daughter got the BBQ Nachos, which other than a huge mess of sour cream on top, these were pretty tasty, and might come back just for this.. (and kiltlifter.. lol) The \"Nachos\" are actually thick potato chips, great flavor and concepts... most likely biggest reason for 3 stars..

2 Meat Combo. Pulled pork and brisket.. Pulled pork, decent flavor and was juicy enough to not NEED added sauce,,, pretty good stuff a lil bit above average here. n might use this for a return visit with those nachos. But the Brisket.. Ehhhh, not impressed at all,  decent flavor on the edges, but so dry in the middle,

Finally, asking for a togo box for the nachos, waitress stared at the uneaten full bowl of pickles and not one peep about them... Kept my mouth shut as lesson learned, but commented on the Check when i paid.. 

Most likely unless a good friend says to try this place again, I wouldnt waste my time here.."}
{"text":"A solid deal for lunch. Came in around 11:45am on a Friday, several tables were occupied but it wasn't packed or too crazy. 

I was excited to see the 2 meat/1 side lunch plate for $13. Sounded good to me! I went with pulled pork and beef brisket, and decided to try out the fries. My partner got the burger and upgraded to a side of Mac n cheese ($1 extra at lunch at least). 

When my plate came out I was like oh my gosh.. what have I done... it was HUGE! Absolutely worth the price, and I ended up having to take some home. Those who know me know I usually don't need to-go boxes! The pulled pork was my favorite of the two, it was alright. The brisket wasn't anything special either though. However it still made for a good meal. They had two kinds of sauce, hot and sweet and then just sweet bbq. I was using a combo of the two because I wasn't crazy about either on it's own (just my own personal preference, they weren't bad, I've just had others I like more). The fries had some solid seasoning on them. Overall I was super full and content. 

My partner really enjoyed the burger and even said it was better than a lot of other faster casual burger places in the area for lunch. I think that definitely counts for something! The mac n cheese she wasn't as impressed with, but I thought it was decent. It's got cheese melted on top, then it's more liquidy on the bottom. Basically if you are looking for thick ridiculously cheesy stuff, this isn't it, but I enjoyed it! 

Service was quick and friendly. I'll definitely return for lunch. Nothing super fancy but sometimes it hits the spot!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy. Just a decent BBQ place in a strip mall.  Relatively quick service and has a nice little outside patio. 
I consider the pricing a bit on the high side but the food is quite good.  Creamed corn and mashed potato sides were very tasty but undersized. 
My primary suggestion is to turn down the rock music. Most don't want to fight to be heard over hard rock music blaring, even on the patio."}
{"text":"out of this world!!   I love the food here."}
{"text":"Everything was dry. Sauce was either to sweet or too spicy. Corn bread was also dry and tasteless. I compared the brisket to canned dog food. Looked and smelled the same. God dammit Brady. Why????"}
{"text":"First time here.  The decoration and atmospheres are nice.  Chairs could be a little more comfortable.  Great selection of various BBQ and appetizers.  A tad overpriced for lunch, but good food.  Food could of been a little warmer, but had a great flavor.  Two kinda of BBQ sauce ready in the table to use.  The jalapeño mac n cheese was probably the highlight, by spicy, but a nice creamy flavor.  Make sure to sign up for the Yelp cash back!"}
{"text":"I placed a to go order, because it was Saturday night and my husband did not feel like waiting for a table.  Upon arrival the place was pretty empty and we could have been sat easily.  My food was ready when I got there and they packed everything nicely for my commute.  Staff was friendly and welcoming.  Once home, we ate, food was ok, not great.  I hate to judge the food this way because i had a 25 minute drive home, but it was BBQ which you'd think would travel well, but it became over cooked and the meat dry.  Next time if there is one i will eat there."}
{"text":"Already our favorite place! This is a carnivores  heaven! Our waiter was Dan Dan the sexy old man, he was awesome suggested dishes we might like since this was our firsr time at Porkopolis. Dan didn't let us down. DAMN! This place is awesome! When we arrived Brady from Morning Sickness on  97.9 KUPD (the sickest morning show on FM) was there and made us feel at home by welcoming us to the Pork Side. This place is a MUST if you want some of the best BBQ ever."}
{"text":"Just a word of advice. If your coming to eat at this place just stick to the meat. Everything else they make seems to be below average. But if you get brisket dishes your in for a treat! The tacos are yummy too!"}
{"text":"Hate to say it but it was just okay. Even though I realize I've been spoiled from the south, I can't say that the meat, beans, or cornbread were any good. Sorry guys. Had big hopes."}
{"text":"Food is amazing, 5 Stars!  Ordered pickup using the eat 24 app and food was hot, fresh and ready when i arrived (10 to 15 minutes).  Jalapeno Coleslaw was perfect and adds a nice flavored spice.  All the salad ingredients were very fresh and went with the pulled pork and rib combo plate with a side of spicy BBQ sauce!"}
{"text":"We dropped in to try the new location. We have visited the Chandler location and were pleased to have one closer. Ok, I ordered the Tri Tip Dip, and hubby had one of the skillets. The food was excellent. The presentation was nice. The portions were large. The service was friendly and the ambiance pleasant. I loved the music , and The Outdoor BBQ rules posted in the bar area were awesome. Give it a try."}
{"text":"The combo meat sandwich here is amazing! I'm not a huge fan of bbq so when my husband and nephew, fans of Brady from 98 kupd, recommended this place, I was hesitant. But since that time we've come back so many times I've lost count. I don't eat coleslaw ever, well, until now, the jalapeño coleslaw here is amazing and I get an extra side of it to put on the sandwich. The bbq sauce tastes great and the fried pickles are perfect. Just enough batter to pickle ratio. My husband loves the bbq hamburger and the pulled pork is so tender, my 17 month old daughter enjoys it. The only complaint I have is that for 3 of us and a baby that eats from the kids menu, the cost is about $60-$70. I think they could shave $2 off each item and still make good money. Oh and the peach iced tea made with moonshine is yummy, though for $7 you only have 1."}
{"text":"Great service! Delicious BBQ! Moonshine drinks are awesome! The prices are reasonable with big portions. It's our second time here and we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"If I make it to heaven (its 50/50 right now) I'd like Beer & BBQ from Porkoplis to be on the meal selection. :)"}
{"text":"My hubby was craving some BBQ. So I pulled out my Yelp app to see what we hadn't tried. I did a fast call in order. We did two, two meat orders and a combo sandwich for the kiddo. Phone order was a breeze. When I arrived our food was ready and packed with two flavors of sauce (regular) and hot and silverware. The chicken was good maybe a bit dry. The pulled pork was moist and tender and the brisket was amazing! Maybe a tad to much fat but that does help season and our dogs loved the unexpected treat! We had the beans and Mac and cheese and a coleslaw as sides and the beans were good, my husband didn't care for the Coleslaw (I didn't try it) the Mac and cheese was really good. We also got one side to share of the cornbread and it was delicious too! We had so much food we could have gotten one meal to share! But we have leftovers for lunch tomorrow. All in all the quality is good and we would go back! Nice that it's close to home! Total for 3 dinners was 54.00."}
{"text":"Great potential but the lack of professionalism was kind of appalling for customer service. Ordered a Pulled Pork Sandwich... there was a long and dark hair in it. I didn't find it until second bite, sadly. When I expressed this that I wanted a new item, they did not provide it. Not sure what his problem was, I was pretty calm about the whole thing. I will avoid this place in the future, long time listener 98KUPD, whole reason why I went. Sadly, I won't be returning. Common courtesy for all of your customers is to provide them with contaminant-free food."}
{"text":"This place was a shocker for me! Food was incredible! The beef bites, and macaroni.....everything was great! Was not disappointed one bit. When I had back in town it will definitely be a spot i will come back to visit"}
{"text":"Awesome, delish! Owner is friendly and helpful, the desserts are to die for! Great ambiance."}
{"text":"Stopped here as driving by for lunch.   Absolutely fantastic BBQ.   Pork would melt in your mouth and large portions.   Great sauces and will definitely return when in area.   In strip mall so you have to look for it."}
{"text":"Was jonesing for some bbq, so i stopped in to order some take out. Although my steak was great, the ribs we ordered were burnt and black, covered with sauce.   If you go here, check the order before you go.   However, i called and they offered to fix the problem, no questions asked, so that made up for the burned food. I will go back to give them a try again.  Mac and cheese was great, green beans were excellent  and the sauce was good.   
Good cold beer at the bar and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Was here about 2 weeks ago on a road trip through AZ. Stopped here for lunch, we chose the pulled pork sammich and brisket sammich. Fabulous.  Brisket sandwich was the winner but I'd definitely order both again. Fries were crispy and delicious, The server was nice, and there were a couple of PokéStops we could hit from sitting there if you're into that kind of thing."}
{"text":"We had previously tried Brady's BBQ at the 4 Peaks Locals Festival BBQ Competition back in April and were quite impressed.  We happened to be the in the area and though, when in Rome eat some pig.  Although I enjoyed my BBQ at the festival, it wasn't as good the 2nd time around.  

We arrived for a late lunch/early dinner and the restaurant was pretty empty.  We were greeted right away and offered a table in the bar area.  Our server was also the bartender and was a nice guy, was helpful with my menu questions and very prompt on delivering our food to our table.

At the Festival, I had the chance to try their burnt ends and their ribs from their competition team and decided to go that route again.  This time the love got lost somewhere, the ends were good but not as good as I remember.  After taking the first layer off the top, the basket was revealed to have a ¼ inch layer of standing grease in the bottom.  For entrees I ordered the Beef Brisket French Dip and The Boy got the 2 meat platter of pork ribs and brisket.  My French dip was just ok, the au ju it came with lacked flavor.  The boy liked his ribs (fall off the bone) and the brisket was just ok.  The 2 sides he ordered were really disappointing.  The mac and cheese looked delicious but was deceptively spicy and the mashed potatoes looked like someone had scooped them out of pot and plopped them on the plate.  I am not expecting presentation but the potatoes tasted as lack luster as they looked.

I think some of my love was also lost because everything there was spicy.  Now I love me some flavor, but everything we ordered was heat spicy from the mild BBQ sauce to the spicy salt on my fries.  At one point I was so over the spice, I wanted to steal the slice of white bread off his platter just to have something that wouldn't burn my mouth.

The final off put was the staff.  I know we got there early but there was at least 8-10 staff members just milling about.  A couple of staff members at the bar, not sure if they were all staff but 2 of the 4 were wearing company shirts and their loud topics of conversation was not work appropriate and were offensive.  One waitress even proclaimed to be the \"Khaleesi of Feral Cats\" which was just, odd.  Idle servers are the devil's work, especially when I have to ask for a refill on my empty water.

Hopefully our experience was just an off day at Porkopolis but it will be some time before we return to see if things have changed."}
{"text":"Went in for a early dinner. Menu Selection is as expected at a BBQ joint. The service was perfect but seeing as there were only 3 tables occupied I was not surprised; I think that there were more staff than customers while we were there. The Pulled Pork in the Pulled Pork Sandwich was really dry and the only think that saved it was the BBQ Sauce. The Brady's Bacon Burger was large but slightly overcooked and left a very charred aftertaste. The fries were generic and under seasoned. For two people the bill was under 30; no liquor was involved. To be honest, my wife is a big BBQ fan and I am a big fan of Brady's BBQ Sauces but this restaurant really disappointed me with lack of flavor and overcooked meat."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time tonight...not good at all! Unfortunately there is not one thing good to say about it. We had the ribs, brisket, catfish, rice, green beans, mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, and cornbread. The barbecue sauces tasted horrible and I've bought store brands that taste better. The cornbread didn't even look like cornbread and was dry and had an odd flavor, I've made better mashed potatoes and macaroni and cheese, and although the brisket was tender the flavor was just not good. We have tried a lot of Bbq in our lives and we've lived all over,  so believe me when I say that it's not worth the time or price."}
{"text":"Tried this place for dinner Thursday night and found it to be really nice. We arrived early about 5pm and were were told all apps and draft beer was 1/2 off for happy hour.  So we ha had a couple beers and tried their fried pickles. Both were great and the pickles were very good. Maybe even a little too many for a 2 person app. Prob more like a 4 person. I had the 3 meat platter with pulled pork, brisket and baby back ribs with a side of slaw and jalapeño Mac n cheese.  The slaw was a little lack luster needed more creamy salad dressing coating. The Mac n cheese was awesome. My wife had the bbq pork salad and lived it. 
We will be back."}
{"text":"Being originally from Kansas City, eating good barbecue is a necessity.  We moved to Scottsdale, AZ two months ago and have already been to Porkopolis 5+ times.  (so many restaurants to choose from for new residents!)  

Great pulled pork, and ribs that literally slide off the bone.  I even enjoyed the smoked meat loaf dinner.  This last time, we took advantage of their Happy Hour half-price appetizers and enjoyed the brisket quesadilla and the fried pickles.  Surprisingly, I could not stop eating the damn pickles!  They were good!  

For the quality, the prices are fine.  The service has always been very good.  They definitely are building up a loyal fan base who we are now part of!"}
{"text":"Nothin like some bbq after a workout huh? lol. 

My friend recommended this place and wanted to try it out. So we had no idea what to get. We ended up sharing a 3 meat platter. Which was a bit much for two of us. We didn't even finish it. lol. We ordered the brisket, pulled pork and chicken, with a side of the creamed corn and Mac & Cheese. So my favorite was probably the pulled pork. This thing was amazing. & the sauce that they have will blow you away. Try the hot and sweet sauce that they have! The mac and cheese was also reallyyyyy delicious. I wasn't too fond of the chicken because I thought it was a bit dry. 

I definitely want to come back for happy hour! Those bbq nachos look bomb! The customer service was spectacular. I wish I remembered our server's name because he was super friendly and helpful with the menu. Very knowledgeable and always made sure we got everything we needed. I'll be back for more! =)"}
{"text":"Im really surprised at how many raves I've heard about this place.  The food is unremarkable.  Cornbread is dry, lots of gelatinous fat on the pork, brisket was tasteless.  
Service was terrible.  Wrong drinks, no napkins, got our own silverware, asked for ranch and catsup twice before it came.  
Super expensive and VERY noisy.  Still hunting for a good bbq joint to rival Kansas City."}
{"text":"After my fiance found this place on yelp he decided the food looked good, we stopped in. We were seated and told someone would be by to get us a started. 15 mins went by before someone came by, there was no one else there.  When she did come over she said \"well I guess it's me, what can I get you to drink \" we got the 3 meat plate (chicken,  ribs, brisket) chicken had no flavor and was dry, brisket was 65% fat hardly any meat. The ribs fell off the bone but once again no flavor. We also had green beans which were extremely oily and salty. The staff didnt seem to happy to be there."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for this place!  I ordered the mac and cheese with the pulled pork and crumbled bacon and corn bread.  The pulled pork was awesome, great flavor, not too sweet and not too smokey.  The service was fantastic as well but the mac and cheese and the corn bread were less than stellar.  The cornbread was COLD yes, cold no butter nothing!  The mac and cheese had zero flavor.  It literally tasted like buttered noodles with some cheese sprinkled on top....I love mac and cheese...I even eat microwave mac and cheese and it was better than this...I was sad.  I might try it again and maybe have a dish with a different side but how can you serve cold corn bread.... :-("}
{"text":"Here now for the first time. I'm having the 2 meat combo with jalapeno slaw. 
Ribs are fall off the bone. The brisket is decent, I added some salt buts 
thats just me. The two sauce choices are ok. The hot n Smokey could be 
hotter for me. The sweet n smokey is simply not for me. Service was fast 
and friendly. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"I travel to the midwest quite a bit for work and every time I'm there I definitely try to visit good barbecue restaurant. 

I haven't been to many barbecue restaurants out in Arizona, and I am not sure whether I will ever try another barbecue restaurant.

Yes, this place was pretty bad... I ordered the two meat platter during off the lunch menu. Cost was $11. 

First, they didn't have many options in regards to sites, I usually like to order collard greens, green beans, I like to have something green along with my meat. 

Second, the brisket was pretty dry, however the one good thing they had on my plate was the turkey. I thought the turkey was cooked to perfection as it was moist and not dry  

I had high hopes for this restaurant as it had 202 reviews and four stars, but I don't think I will be coming here again."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Food is amazing, ribs fall off the bones, and customer service is excellent."}
{"text":"Fast service, sometimes seat yourself. Got drinks right away and ordered food promptly. Place is nice and modern feeling. Smells good. Has a patio and a bar. Best background music! 

First of all the BURNT ENDS are a MUST order for us every time we come here, they are hit or miss at times, but delicious nonetheless. Not a fan of jalapeño Mac and cheese, but that's just me:) I'm sure people love it. The fries were fantastic. Ordered the brisket and it was pretty good! Mostly lean even though I'm fatty fan, it had lots of good flavor. At times it is dry, but still yummy. Wife had the pulled pork sammy, and she loved it and almost ordered another! Over all good experience, we visit regularly! Best of luck Porkopolis and see you soon!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome if you get the right things. As other reviewers said, the burnt ends are terrible, but to be fair..I've had burnt ends in KC and they were bad over there too. With that being said, don't let that discourage you! Their combo brisket sandwich is amazing - I would put it against the Z-man at Joe's KC. Awesome BBQ quesadilla and surprisingly great wings. Give this place a try!"}
{"text":"I ordered a three meat take out dinner for my wife and I, the BEST part of the meal was that they said they would reverse the charges. 
HORRIBLE. 
Absolute dog food. 
We got the brisket, chicken and baby back ribs. 
The chicken was yellow grey, sweaty and over cooked with the flavor of old salt brine. Shriveled up skin that had seen better days. Nasty.
The baby back ribs had a quarter inch chewy crust, were grey throughout and absolutely horrible. Reheated garbage. Over salted, consistency of jerky. Drenched in salty Bbq sauce to cover...
The brisket was light grey, over cooked, fatty and over salted. 
What an absolute mess. 
I don't know if they serve day(+) old crap to unsuspecting carry out customers or if they serve this horse shit to in house customers too.  
BTW - two plates of horse crap - $54 with tip. I will be checking my bank statement daily, I don't trust they are competent enough to reverse the charges on my card either. 
Good news - they should be out of business soon if this is their standard.
Happy Valentines Day."}
{"text":"Greeted right away as we walked in. To my surprise, restaurant is more of a bar setting with tons of tables, looked liked there was some outdoor seating as well. 

Onto the food, I ordered the 2 meal option with one side and the portions were huge. I could only eat half. My husband ordered the southern fried chicken sandwich and an order of Mac and cheese. For my 2 meal option I got the pork ribs and brisket with cornbread. The ribs and brisket was out of this world but I wish I ordered fries instead of the cornbread, I've had better. My husbands sandwich was yummy too, crispy and lightly battered. I stole his fries which were perfectly cooked, just the way I like it and also the seasoning that they used was awesome. I tried a couple of bites of his Mac and cheese and I was not impressed, the pics that I seen looked way better. Had a little spice to it too so I would not recommend it for children. I am not sure if the kids Mac was different or not but I would double check. 

The service was spot on and we can't wait to bring the inlaws who love brisket. I also can't wait to eat my leftovers today!"}
{"text":"Porkopolis is my guilty pleasure.

I came here a few times after work to get the brisket sandwiches.  I was drawn to this place by Brady Bogen and the Holmberg's Morning Sickness crew.  It's pretty good.  It gets FOUR STARS because I've always taken it to go and it never tastes as good as it could be.  It's also expensive for pork products, but they don't call it The Evolution of BBQ for nothing!  I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Since moving to Phoenix about 3 years ago, I've listened to the KUPD morning show frequently. One of the hosts, Brady Bogen, owns Porkapolis. There used to be only one location and it was almost an hour drive, so I hadn't had the chance to try the BBQ they spoke so highly of on the air. This newer location is much close, so I thought I would try it today. I was very impressed. I had the BBQ jambalaya. This is a mix of spicy smoked BBQ pork, chicken and shrimp, served over their dirty rice. The flavors were amazing and the portion was so large, I took half home. There were many other items on the menu that I wanted to try, so I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"First time ate here we had an amazing experience with outstanding food. This time the ac was broken, the food was dry and lacked flavor. I had t he ribeye. Half of the steak fat. My wife had the 2 meat platter. The briskett a was extremely bland and tuff. The Turkey was dry."}
{"text":"It's ok... The ribs are boiled and dry. It was busy so people like this place, but I wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"The meat was tender.   The bbq sauce on the pork ribs reminded me of Mexican mole.   The sides were not so wonderful,  but we had a great bbq nacho platter on happy hour special.   I will definitely come back!  Oh,  and the service was excellent!"}
{"text":"We ordered a 4 meat platter to go and when we got to the park to eat our food, I opened the box and there was hardly anything in there. 4 small ribs, a very small portion of brisket and two descent sized pieces of smoke turkey. I have ordered this to go a couple of times in the past and the portion size seemed a lot bigger. But what was there was as good as ever. Just kind of skimpy for the money. I also ordered a Porkopolis Quesadilla which was really good."}
{"text":"Overall this place was decent, but they could definitely improve in a few areas. 

Meat - Bbq pulled pork sandwich was tasty, bun was good too. Meat was tender and juicy. Brisket was fatty and dry, would not recommend. Based on my coworkers experiences, the meat quality is very inconsistent. 

Sides - an apparent afterthought, beans were watery and bland, coleslaw tasted old and was also very bland. Mac N Cheese looked tasty but was watery when dug into. 

Sauce - two options, sweet & smoky and hot & sweet. Both good. 

Service - prompt and relatively attentive but only one server for the lunch crowd was not enough. 

Prices - overall acceptable OTHER than the $3 charge for an extra side of beans... it was probably about half a cup of beans at most."}
{"text":"Service is always good!  Love their happy hour!  Moonshine drinks are a fun change from the usual.   Not sure about the Kool-aid one though...   took me back to high-school days of jungle juice and epic hangovers! Redneck tacos are absolutely to die for... the cornbread pancake with layers of incredible flavor on top..mmmm.  and enough to share!  The chowder is hands down the best comfort food out there... actually its good enough to put pants BACK on and go get some!"}
{"text":"Pretty good barbecue especially for North Scottsdale where there is no barbecue. I would give it 3.5 stars and I wish Yelp would finally get on it and be able to give half stars on reviews. Tried the brisket and pulled pork as well as the baby back ribs. Both were decent but a little on the dry side. Both sauces were good, the sweet was pretty sweet and the sweet and hot I preferred but was still a little too sweet and not hot enough. Either way glad there's actually barbecue in the area."}
{"text":"Freaking fantastic. Amazing meat, amazingly nice and accommodating bartender. Wheelchair and service dog friendly -  totally NOM NOMS FOOD! Super flavorful, fun, different and generous.  Nice selection of beers. But wow.  The jambalaya, the smoked meatloaf, the BBQ nachos and the skillets... On point! Thanks, guys!"}
{"text":"The food here is really good! Mitch our server was fantastic. However it's very loud and very crowded. All the employees were very nice but we were seated next to a table with unruly children that the parents didn't care to look after. I would definitely order take out though!"}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ that I have ever had. I had the three meat platter - ribs, pulled pork and brisket. All delicious!! Service as A+. Would definitely recommend trying. Place was smaller than expect but we were seated right away."}
{"text":"OMH good!  You can't go wrong. Everything our table ordered was wonderful and we each had enough leftover for our dinners. This was a good find and one we will not lose.

The service was great. Attentive and helpful but not too much."}
{"text":"I was hoping that this place would be good but it's actually quite terrible. I would imagine that the average person that doesn't know a whole lot about barbecue might think that it's really really good. The brisket was very poor. Super overcooked and it almost tasted like it was left over from yesterday and I just popped in the microwave. I wouldn't be shocked to learn if they cook that in the oven or on a pellet cooker. As far as the ribs go they were severely over cooked and we're barely on the bone."}
{"text":"The service was terrible. I watched an entire inning of baseball before I was asked for my order. Granted, the food came out quickly, but it was definitely just sitting there waiting to be ordered. The pork was just ok, and that's the best thing i had. I ordered a 3 meat plate w/ baked beans and an order of fries. The brisket was terrible. It was so dry, it couldve been there for 3 days. The chicken wasn't much better. The sides were good.
I'm from the south, so I'm used to sweet, sweet tea. This is not as sweet as i get back home, but I appreciated and enjoyed this toned down sweetness."}
{"text":"The food was ok, have had better BBQ. But their homemade chips are amazing, those made the Nachos even better. The BBQ sauce was good also. Service was also decent."}
{"text":"Ordered the two meat platter (pulled pork and ribs).  Had polenta and cream corn as sides.

Also ordered a pulled pork sandwich with fries and baked beans.

So the food...

Ribs...fall off the bone so that was good.  Flavor was fair.  Not bad, just not unique.

Pulled pork...pretty good

Creamed corn...good, better than Rudy's.

Polenta...meh.  They don't have onion rings on the menu, but they have polenta??  How does that happen?  That being said, it just wasn't worth getting.

Pulled pork sandwich.  Again, pork was good.  The bun was a brioche...very good.

Fries...matchstick kind.  I like matchstick fires but these could have been a little warmer.  Other than that they were ok.

Beans...were ok.  A little sweeter than I would prefer but since the serving size was pretty small I didn't get too much of a sugar rush.

Service, for the food anyway, was very quick.  I'm not sure how this happens but the food beat my beer to the table.  Beer showed up a few minutes after the food.  As I understand the economics of the restaurant industry, the big money is made from bar sales.  Such being the case you'd think the beer would show up sooner and then they'd ask if I wanted another with the meal.  Nope...didn't happen that way.  As a matter of fact, didn't get asked if I wanted another beer (I didn't) until I was all but done with my meal.  

The other thing that struck me odd was the number of employees socializing with the guests.  I mean being polite and talking with guests is one thing but this was something else entirely.  Kind of reminded me of some of the scenes from those restaurant rescue shows.  Another thing that struck me as odd was that the place was packed and we were initially told we'd have to wait for a table or sit at the bar.  As it turned out a table came open.  As they took us to our table we walked through the bar where I noticed one of the bar high top tables (located behind the reception desk) covered with items that clearly belonged to someone at the restaurant, and other than the stuff on the table, no one was using it.  Again, odd, am I in the middle of a restaurant rescue show or do we just think it's a good idea to take up table space for now good reason.

I gave them a 3 but because of the things that really struck me as being odd (see above) they're probably really a 2.75 or less."}
{"text":"Used to love this place but something has changed. Last 2 times we went the ribs were dry and just fell off bone. Like they were in the oven 2 long. Not sure what happened but hope they turn it around again."}
{"text":"I went here for something different which in this case was not good. My companion ordered a pulled pork sandwich and fries and said it was very tasty and more than she could finish. I ordered a  meal - meatloaf which came with 2 sides, mashed potatoes and green beans. The mashed potatoes were bare! No gravy, no sauce, no anything until the waitress suggested some butter. I decided to swap out the green beans for creamed corn. They brought a tiny little container that had maybe 3 spoonfuls of corn. My meal was twice the cost for less food! I ended up helping my companion with her fries because I was still hungry. I will not eat there again."}
{"text":"I have to finally write a review about this place. I'm not going to bore you with the cliché \"I never write reviews but this place was so good I had to\" kind of review. No, this place is deserving of so much more. Truth is, I have written quite a few reviews about places. This one is going to join them. What makes this place stand out among the others is that I am writing this review from another restaurant because I am thinking about Porkopolis.  

Yes. I am out to eat somewhere else and I'm thinking about how sucky it is that I cannot eat the sweet, delicious, juicy bbq that hails from Porkopolis. The only therapy for me right now is venting about how darn amazing the food and atmosphere is there. I know of no other words than juicy and freaking delicious when describing the taste of the food. Also, I've always been angry at the fact that most bbq restaurants let you spit on the floor and......that's just gross. This place isn't a farm. It isn't a county fair. It's this little piece of proper Heaven where you can eat messy barbecue but have aesthetic pleasure at the same time. Sign me up a million times over. 

In addition to the atmosphere and food, I - the girl who is not at all social - am on a first name basis with the server. His name is Jordan. You should also be on a first name basis with him because he takes care of business and won't judge you if you have a little bbq-face (trust that this has happened). 

Long story short for those who have made it this far......Every time I choose a place other than Porkopolis I feel like I have failed. I've failed myself and I've certainly failed my stomach. Go check it out. See your new favorite server Jordan. Your taste buds deserve a party."}
{"text":"My friend told me that a radio DJ is the owner if this restaurant. Wow! I've got to try it!

The restaurant is very clean, organized and welcoming. Staffs were friendly and helpful. I ordered a combo with the choice of briskets and BBQ ribs. They were both so tendered that it falls off the bones. I didn't care for the corn bread that came with it. It was a little blend for my taste. Smash potatoe was delicious and generous in portion.

I am not a drinker, but I do notice that they sell moonshines here. maybe I'll try a shot here next time. We had so much leftovers and I have another full meals do my lunch the next day. Ill definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"The excellent service elevates Porkopolis to 3 stars.  The food is good, but the only standout item was the fried pickles appetizer.  Those were the best fried pickle slices that I have had and I highly recommend you start your meal with them.

I had the 3 meat plate (brisket, ribs and pulled pork.)  The ribs were the best of the meats and the brisket and pulled pork were good, but their flavor was underwhelming.   I had the mac and cheese as my side and the baked cheese topping was unbelievably cheesy.   Unfortunately, the actual mac and cheese below the topping was watery and much, much less flavorful.   I did enjoy their thick BBQ sauces and recommend you take full advantage of dousing your meal in their sauces.

The atmosphere is relaxed with an industrial, modern feel.  Porkopolis is by no means a bad restaurant.   Their service, full bar and decent prices make it a worthwhile stop, if you are in the area and hungry for BBQ and beer.

**Tip 1**

They have a weekday happy hour!!

**Tip 2**

Am I the only one who puts half a bottle of BBQ sauce in my leftovers?  I always recommend you squeeze a little too much in your to go box!"}
{"text":"My first impression was that I had walked into a bar that put a small restaurant inside as an afterthought.  Ok, well, that's still my impression, but...the food was really good.  And despite going with my kids, I never felt like I was taking them to a bar.  The few tables (no, really, this place is tiny) around us were full of families just like ours.
The staff was very pleasant, and the food was pretty good.  Your typical bbq fare, but also with different twists.  
I really enjoyed seeing that they teamed up with other local business, so they serve Paletas Betty's desserts.  And I'm definitely a fan.
I still wish the bar area was smaller and the restaurant bigger...but I'm sure at other times of the day, the bar is the highlight.  I'll still go back."}
