{"text":"Situated in a rather dark, dingy strip plaza, the restaurant is a cozy, brightly lit place with warm hosts and fragnance of old world kebabs, koobideh and saffron rice. We ordered the Royal Kebob platter complete with a skewer of barg, chicken, koobideh, rice and salads. Very impressive!"}
{"text":"Best Persian food in the area if you leave in Richmond hill  Koobede is the best in this place."}
{"text":"Best Persian food I've had in this area thus far. Staff are super friendly. Would recommend this to you."}
{"text":"Waiting time is unacceptable. Being there 2nd time, ordered shawarma wrap  for $7 each most expensive in GTA. waited 20 mins. Starving to death. It turned out no shawarma , but kobob in a pita roll. Pissed off. Will not return any more"}
{"text":"My fav place for Persian food in oak ridges. The quality is always good. Happy that they are now open late on weekends and the app to order is convenient."}
{"text":"This is my second time getting take out from this restaurant. I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt and made the mistake of coming here a second time. I have never in my life had beef fillet that was so dry, so smelly, and so chewy. Beef fillet should be so soft and tender you can cut it with a spoon, I couldn't cut this kabob with my back teeth. It was so dry that it sucked out all the moisture from my mouth, I couldn't get it down. And don't get me started on the taste. It was a mixture of sour and smelly. Clearly not fresh. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Horrible. I saw one review that said it was cozy.... 1 table and no washrooms for the customers isn't my idea of cozy. Sure there's a sit up bar that's 12 inches deep if you like staring at a wall while you eat. We ordered 2 chicken shawarma and 2 cans of pop....$20. Wait time -20 minutes. Flavour was 1 out of ten with your choice of three toppings. Really? In this day and age how do these places survive? My daughter couldn't even finish hers. The garlic sauce was so runny it pours out the backside making the wrap (loosely wrapped) virtually inedible after about 2 minutes. The one redeeming thing about this establishment was the nice lady who served us at the counter. She was very kind, but I'm sorry I'm never coming back."}
{"text":"Great spot for take out Persian food!  Family run restaurant with friendly and efficient service.  Prices are very reasonable compared to other persian restaurants, i would recommend calling ahead to order so food is ready when you arrive.  Noosheh Jan (bon appetite in persian)"}
{"text":"Is seriously another hidden gem here in Richmond Hill if you are close to the Oakridges (Yonge & King) always great quality and portion-happy you will quickly fall in love with satisfaction after your meal.  Highly recommended Apple Restaurant for a quick tasty take out on the road or to bring home to your family!!!"}
{"text":"Apple restaurant serves excellent Persian bbq and stews. Koobideh kabob which is basically ground beef kabob on basmati rice and salad is the favorite meal my kids love to order. For $8 it is a very good deal.  Barg (veal) kebab is very soft, incredibly delicious and one of favs. I also like their stews such as bademjan, eggplant cooked with veal, tomato and sour grape served on basmati rice. If you ordering a family of 4, try their family pack.  They seem to be getting busier every year so give yourself half an hour for pickup after you order.  They have 3 tables for a quick dine-in, but be prepared to wait at peak hours.  If you pay cash you may get a discount."}
{"text":"Very nice Persian take out/ delivery joint. The kebabs are awesome, they are juicy and delicious. Soltani is the best, as it should be, but so was the chicken. If there was a suggestion I could relay to the management - get better containers for take out instead of those stereofoam ones. It's Aurora, people are used to a bit more up here. Presentation goes a long way."}
{"text":"Ok so the food is good. But they stopped giving salad two years ago. Which is fine whatever. But now they don't include a drink with your meal and when you stay to eat they give it to you in a to go container instead of a plate which is less food. They are getting really cheap which is ridiculous!"}
