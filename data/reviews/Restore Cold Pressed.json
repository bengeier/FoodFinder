{"text":"Delicious, healthy, a little pricey. Totally worth it for high quality ingredients. Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is an amazing spot. I was in Cleveland for a wedding and stopped here for something each morning! The avocado toasts are delicious and the smoothies are fresh! Didn't try the juices but they're probably just as good. I would highly recommend this place and wish I could have something this good in the DC area! :)"}
{"text":"I recently visited Restore before attending a Cleveland Indians baseball game. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable as they guided me through the different choices. I chose juice #1 - it was outstanding! I highly recommend you take the time to visit Restore Cold Pressed.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great juices, smoothies and lattes! (Turmeric latte with 2 shots espresso!) I came here each day on my trip to Cleveland- nice bright environment- highly recommend."}
{"text":"The avocado toast with salmon is amazing. Just a little pricey. Nonetheless I love coming here and the customer service is great!"}
{"text":"Yummy food! Great Customer Service! So glad I came upon this gem while visiting Cleveland"}
{"text":"I am so happy to have found this place! Sometimes it feels like trying to eat healthy in the Cleveland area is a major struggle, but places like Restore make it a little easier. Everything is so fresh and YUMMY.   I had the #2 antioxidant smoothie (kale, spinach, banana, mango, pineapple, peanut butter) and was not disappointed. $9 is definitely a little steep for a smoothie so I probably won't be coming here too often, but it's definitely a new favorite that I am glad to have around.   It's also a great location right in Playhouse Square, the staff is super friendly (no snooty health nuts at all), and the interior is beautiful and relaxing - I left feeling healthy and happy :)"}
{"text":"Staying with friends nearby and they recommended coming here and I'm glad I did. Ordered the #1 detox juice and an acai bowl. Both were so tasty. I was satisfied until lunch and felt like I was putting healthy, refreshing ingredients  in my body. My boyfriend got the blueberry banana smoothie and said it was the best he's ever had. They are very nice and happy to help you too. Can wait to go tomorrow for breakfast again!"}
{"text":"Yum!  I took a bike ride during the lunch hour, and happened across restore cold pressed.  I had no idea they were here, despite the fact our office is 2 doors down (to be fair I work from home) but was glad I stopped in.   I make smoothies 3-4 times a week, but was a little nervous as I was looking trough the menu. There are a lot of healthy ingredients that frankly, I don't want to put in my body.  Kale?  No thanks.  Still, I landed on the #4 smoothie and wow, it was good.  Much better than what you can get and coffee shops downtown or Ohio City.  The price?  $9 which is pretty steep.  The size was a little on the small side in my opinion, but it tastes great. On top of it the space there is fairly large considering what they actually sell so I am sure some of that price goes to rent.  The staff were all super nice, polite and cute as a button.  So if part of the price goes towards cool people I'm about that too.    If you like kale, or other whole foods-esque ingredients in your smoothie and are downtown during the day be sure to stop by."}
{"text":"Just visited this yummy shop. Had a delicious acai bowl and a yummy detox juice. My husband had the yummy goji, mango, kale, pineapple, strawberry and young coconut smoothie. Such fresh ingredients and delicious treats. Owners and staff are super nice and friendly. Would totally recommend this spot for anyone looking for a healthy yummy treat."}
{"text":"Just had the 05 Nut with cold pressed coffee - amazing! Great vibe in the store with very friendly staff. Probably the best looking juice spot I've been to and definitely the best in Cleveland. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Always excellent service and solid working atmosphere to get some things done mid-morning. Definitely check out the Primal Coffee w/ mct oil and breakfast bowls. Very happy I found this place"}
{"text":"During a recent visit to the city to see my brother, I was surprised at how few cold-pressed juice options there were in Cleveland.  However, compared to even the best ones I've been to (and I've been to over 20 over the years) Restore does an incredible job providing delicious juice and light breakfast/food items in a fresh, clean setting.   The juice selection ranges from super veggie green, to sweeter ones with more fruits.  Love the shots selection too-- of ginger, wheatgrass and the usual suspects. Avocado toast on probiotic bread executed terrifically.  Ripe juicy tomatoes and generous smashed avocado. Friendly service to boot.   PS:  To those who say $10 for a 16oz. juice is expensive, it's actually quite on par with markets all across the country where the product is cold-pressed and organic.  It takes 5 pounds or so of vegetables and fruits to make one bottle, and with cold-pressed, it takes much longer than conventional processes.  Keep that in mind, uneducated juice skeptics!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place for any time of the day! Delicious juices and avocado toast, clean and neat store and helpful staff."}
{"text":"We had the #1 smoothie and the #1 juice. Both were really good, but very expensive. $9 for a juice and $8 for a smoothie. I understand it's all organic and what not, and it was pretty good, but that seems like a little too much for me. Oh well, got to sustain the downtown cle real estate somehow! We'll probably be back, but not too often."}
{"text":"My first visit to Restore Cold Pressed was a good one! I tried the #1 avocado toast, and added smoked salmon. Toast was thin and crispy, but still \"held the weight\" of lots of avocado a slice of smoked salmon and a tomato. I got a cold brew, which includes coconut oil and Ghee. Ghee as in clarified butter. I was definitely skeptical at 1st but turns out Ghee is good for you, and it didn't take away from the flavor of the coffee too much. They sell Acai bowls there, which I've never had before. After finishing my meal I asked one of the employee's for a sample and they obliged! Next time I am back in Cleveland I will definitely be back to Restore!"}
{"text":"Nice place to sit down and grab a healthy fruit bowl or juice/smoothie. Was craving a fruit bowl and Restore was one of the few (if only place) in the immediate vicinity that seemed to have it on the menu. Their chalkboard for some reason only boast the acai and oatmeal bowl, but I was able to get the pitaya (dragonfruit) bowl. It was good, but I wish they would include a drizzle of honey or nutella as an option on their basic $9 bowl - I think that would really make it more oustanding and appropriate for the price point. Staff was courteous."}
{"text":"It was pretty quiet on the weekend I went, but the space was clean and minimalist. The customer service could have been better with the explanations when I was trying to decide between two choices - after all, this place is pretty healthy, and customers would like to know more about the benefits from the ingredients. I decided on the #5 smoothie - the flavor was a bit odd with the after taste from the hemp seed but overall was fresh. Also, to get the bottles, you need to order the juice, not the smoothies."}
{"text":"We were visiting Cleveland for the weekend and thanks to Yelp I found this yummy place right around the corner from our hotel.  I would not have walked in on my own, since the outside signage is very stark and unassuming.  However, I'm so glad we did - the avocado toast was so fresh and tasty and the smoothies hit the spot.  I also had the Turmeric Latte.  The perfect way to start a healthy day!"}
{"text":"This is a cool place to grab a healthy and trendy treat. The location is great, right in downtown Cle, and it's very Instagram worthy! The place is clean, fun, and the food, smoothies, and coffee are all really good. My only issue is that it's a bit expensive, however, whatever you get will definitley fill you up and you'll want to go back.   Their merch is also cool. I've been eyeing the shirts they have that just say \"Avocado Toast\" for a while! I have to go back and get one!"}
{"text":"Best juice bar ever.  Juices are very tasty. Coffee is amazing.  And the prices are great!  I simply saw this place as I was walking and decided to give it a try. The owners were were extremely friendly when I walked in, and I could tell within 30 seconds they were authentic, honest, and enthusiastic.  Cheers! I'll be back when I'm in town."}
{"text":"A little bit on the pricier side but amazing acai bowls. Next time I come back I'm definitely gonna try one of their juices because they looked amazing. The atmosphere is super chill and great if you want to just sit and get work done. I will be back!!"}
{"text":"Great fresh juices of all types in a funky little space on Huron. Just around the corner from the 9. Try the #2 smoothie and slip your kids some kale without so much as a whimper or moan."}
{"text":"I came in around lunchtime today with the sole intention of browsing and seeing what was being offered. Omg...Primal coffee?!?! I've had coffee with coconut oil and I've had ghee but never all three combined. Holy deliciousness. I also got the #3 Immunity juice: Carrot, Coconut, Pear + Lemon. Wow the glass bottle makes it taste so much more fresh and delicious. I love the modern, rustic simplicity of the space: from the big wooden tables, to the neutral muted paint colors, to the rustic decorations. I honestly could go on and on about this new juice place, just a hop away from work. Next time I want to try the avocado toast or an acai/oatmeal bowl! :-D"}
{"text":"Restore is a delicious place for a quick snack and some amazing, fresh squeezed juice. I absolutely love their avocado toast. It is simple, fresh, and just tasty!   The staff here is some of the most friendly and knowledgeable staff that I've ever seen anywhere. They are willing to answer any and all questions, even when it is busy.   I've heard people complain about the price of the juices and food but I have to disagree. The portions of juice are more than I've seen at other locations and the produce is always fresh squeezed and tasty. I think you're really paying for what you get at Restore - which is tasty, healthy, amazing juices and snacks!"}
{"text":"What a hidden jewel. And it's giving me life. I had #2 from their Superfood Smoothies. If I was in town longer I would've tried their breakfast toast as well. Very clean and modern. Vision beyond anything. Thank you Cleveland. While in this tour you surpassed my expectations."}
{"text":"As the latest addition to Cleveland's growing juice bar scene Restore Cold Pressed has what others lack: the space and design for people to stay-- to work, to meet with someone or simply to relax while enjoying your juice. The open space is great.  In addition to a wide array of fresh squeezed juices (fruit/veg blends) Restore offers smoothies, coffee and a few healthy snacks. I'm particularly fond of the Acai Bowl: for $8.50 you get a nutritious and tasty light lunch.  Restore has a great location downtown just a stones throw behind the County Offices on E. 9th."}
{"text":"Restore Cold Pressed is a breath of fresh air with organic food, vegan options, and fantastic cold pressed juices. This is definitely one of my top favorite places to go when I need a health boost or a light lunch option. The avocado toast is full of favor, and with red pepper flakes it adds a kick! The staff is so kind and excited to answer all my health questions. A great overall experience."}
{"text":"I was in town for business this week and was pleased to see that a juice bar was so close to my office. I walked the few minutes and found a pleasant and open space. The first thing that caught my eye was the Almond Milk. I love to put a shot of espresso in a good almond milk, it's just he best. But the geniuses at Restore are one step ahead of me and already have cold brew mixed in (plus Vanilla, pink salt, etc) - awesome! I also ordered three other flavors on my two trips and all were delightful (immunity, orange/turmeric, and green). But then, to top it off, as I'm checking out I see they have a coffee drink called PRIMAL on the menu. I prepare butter coffee for myself most mornings but am absolutely delighted when I find it on a menu. All said, I'm looking forward to being back in Cleveland next week!  Have to give a shot out to the man behind the counter, Dave. He knew how often I'm in here, and my go to orders, so he knew to stash a #5 in the fridge for me - much appreciated!"}
{"text":"For what it is - an eclectic and urban pitstop with healthy offerings and clean/energizing snacks & quick meals, this place fits the billet nicely. I would say, for the price-point, it lacks something to be desired. I had the pineapple custom immunity fresh cold press blend to drink with sage and lemon flavoring; it was very sweet and seem more like pineapple juice than anything else - but refreshingly good. To eat I had a tomatoes & avocado wheat toast. Again, for the price-point, something was lacking. It was bagged grocery store bread, with fresh avocado, but it lacked much fresh tomato (barely a sliver) - it was, however, clean and tasty. This place is worth a stop if you desire a fresh, clean and healthy boost to your day."}
{"text":"the bowl was good and the smoothie was ok. Nice ambiance and very friendly/helpful staff. Here's where my problem is: $11 for a 16 oz. smoothie?? People willingly buy this stuff? you gotta be outta your dam mind. It tasted OK. Just OK. If i'm paying over $10 for a 16 oz. drink it better cure cancer. Hopefully your staff receives health benefits with the 1,000% markup you're receiving on drinks."}
{"text":"Love the look and smell of the place. It's a bit pricey, but the acai bowls are big. I like how I have the freedom to choose what goes in my bowl. Everything just smells and looks fresh. Definitely will go back sometime."}
{"text":"WOW! The smoothies here really do live up to the hype. I tried the number 1 (blueberry and other berry mix), and was pleasantly surprised to find it not too sweet and none of the flavors were overpowering. The smoothies are very thick, so you know you're getting a quality drink."}
{"text":"Overall it's really good; the reason it's not 5 stars is the lack of nutritional information. Health conscious people want to know how many calories they are consuming!!"}
{"text":"I like it, but for the average consumer its a pretty limited menu. You can't just get a regular coffee you have to get coffee with butter and coconut. Its also pricey think $10 for a glass of juice. That being said its really good."}
{"text":"Great, friendly staff. Awesome juice! I love the decor, vibe, and glass bottles. They juice on the scene which is great. Highly recommend this spot when visiting CLE."}
{"text":"$10 for a 16oz bottle of juice!  That's what you're getting here folks.    I don't care if it's hand picked from the Mountains of Borneo, and then pressed by the hands of druid monks, and sweetened with the tears of an angel.  It's just juice - plain and simple.  If you are really so concerned about your juice just get yourself a Vitamix and make it at home.  You're return on the investment in the Vitamix will pay for itself in no time."}
{"text":"Great, modern space with helpful service. This place is a great addition to downtown.  I'll come here from work for avocado toast (red pepper flakes, himalaya salt) and they are an amazing afternoon pick me up.  Their juices are amazing combos as well. When my parents came into town, my dad wasn't able to eat much because of some health issues. Juices (especially with ginger) are always a pick me up for him, and he felt more energized and restored (ha) after drinking it. We also got a plant fix for my mom, which also have great combos.  I know they do a lot of other events here too and occasionally some yoga. Great space and great business to have downtown!"}
{"text":"Awesome juices! I've been waiting for Restore to open for weeks, and I stopped in this morning on my way to work. They have a big menu that includes way more than juice. They had a good selection of smoothies, smoothie bowls, granola and other snacks. The interior was very clean and beautiful, with a modern feel.  I ordered two juices, the #10 for myself and the #1 for my coworker. The #10 had grapefruit, pear, kale, celery and cucumber and was light, refreshing and delicious. Definitely more veggie flavor than fruit, but I'm into that. The #1was apple, beet, and lemon and my co-worker liked hers as well. I loved the glass bottles and the bottle design was beautiful!  I did notice that my juice was substantially colder then my co-workers, so maybe hers was just made. Still, they should be cold. Also, I wanted to originally order an different juice, but they told me hadn't made it yet. They're new so I know they're still working out some kinks, so I'll give them a pass.  Restore is filling a much needed void downtown. I know I can't be the only one that prefers a fresh pressed juice over coffee in the morning! I'm looking forward to stopping by often on my way to work for some juice, and after yoga for some nut milk! I just wish they were open a little later!"}
{"text":"A great place downtown for a healthy snack.   I ordered the Plant Fix #8 (spinach, kale, pear, lemon, ginger) and the special custom juice (Blue Majik - a blue green algae derived from spirulina, alkaline H2O, lemon, ginger, maple). Both drinks cost about $10 each (expensive, though cold pressed juices aren't cheap in general!). Both were very good. The Custom drink was light and refreshing, like fancy lemon water. The Plant fix was very flavorful. I'd recommend it!  I also ordered an acai bowl, which was good, although I didn't realize that it is served cold (I thought it would be at more of a room temperature), which caught me by surprise on a cold winter day!   I'll definitely be back (need to save up some money for it though!). I just noticed someone else's review mentioning that the coffee is really good there. I didn't even think about trying the coffee at a juice bar, though I'll have to check it out next time I'm there."}
{"text":"Amazing super healthy selection. Price is perfectly matched to the upgraded quality. You must must chime here if you are trying to be Bulletproof."}
{"text":"I live in the area and was walking by one day and saw a sign that said \"open come in!\" So I walked right in not knowing what Restore was. I now recommend it to everyone I know! As someone who knows about juicing I was judgmental at first. I can usually always find something they are doing wrong. I was so pleased that I finally found a place that does everything right! All the way from no heat to no plastic, everything was covered.  I happen to like the fact that not all the juices are available all the time as it forces me to try something new. I love to come in just to see what the custom juice of the day is.  I was reading the reviews on yelp and while all are great, I found that some of the customers need to better understand the health benefits of why somethings are the way they are. I was one of those people not to long ago. :) I highly recommend trying everything on the menu! I have not been disappointed yet!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places! If I lived a little closer, I would probably come here everyday. I ordered avocado toast, an acai bowl, and a green juice to go. I love that you can choose which toppings to get on your toast and your bowls. This place makes eating healthy so fun! The staff was super friendly and knowledgeable. The juicery itself is very cute and inviting. I can't wait to go back and try more!"}
{"text":"OBSESSED. Everything I had from here is amazing-- acai bowls you can customize based on desired toppings, awesome smoothies, yummy primal coffee, delicious juices and the best avocado toast I have ever had. I wish they would extend their hours of operation because I could eat anything on the menu at all hours. It is pretty pricey and parking is limited. I wish they had an Independence location so I could go during the week days!"}
{"text":"TAKE ALL OF MY MONEY RESTORE! ALL OF IT! Amazing juice, amazing toast, amazing Acai bowls, amazing customer service, and vvvvvv attractive employees. Love this place. The #2 smoothie is DA BOMB."}
{"text":"Shocked by how awesome the service is here for such a small Place. The staff is super helpful in making selection for those of us who are new to juicing. I have gone a few times and every time loved everything. The smoothies are great, I love the avocado toast and there a decent amount of seating to meet with others."}
{"text":"OMG! This place is the best! I was in Cleveland for a wedding and found this gem! I had the AVO toast, matcha green tea smoothie and bought a detox & plant fix juice to go! My kid had the banana blueberry smoothie and he loved it! We even bought a freezer bag for our to go juices a tee shirts! Next time I'm in Cleveland I'm there!"}
{"text":"Their smoked salmon & avocado on bread was outstanding.  Tried a couple juices and they seemed fresh and invigorating.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"So good, and so cute! I love it inside, super modern and chic. The staff was really nice. I got confused and ordered the wrong thing after paying and they let me switch it out no problem. I ordered an immune juice, apple, cayenne, and lemon. It was delicious and refreshing, and helped cure my headache. My friend loves their acai bowl which I want to try next. There is limited street parking do ne aware but it's totally worth it."}
{"text":"Design: The interior design of this store/restaurant is beautiful! I love the paint color and use of wood.  Drinks: Great juices. The Detox 1 drink is great and I'm not even a big beets fan. However, I wish there were more options without ginger. I'd go a lot more if I had more options (minus ginger).   Oatmeal: I'm not a fan. I've tried it twice and mixed different things on top. While it's very healthy, it's also really bland no matter what fruit I put on top of it. I don't know what I can do to make it better."}
{"text":"Went for an iced coffee and decided to try their \"#5\" - it's a $10 pre made iced coffee with almond milk, honey and vanilla.  Good?  Yes.   Worth $10?  Not a chance.  Other menu items looked good and I might try their smoothies or juices, but it's hard to justify the outrageously priced iced coffee."}
{"text":"So I don't want to like it because it is pretty expensive...but it really is fantastic. The juices are creative and fresh. A few favorites are the detox 1 and immunity 3. The immunity 3 is sort of a spicy lemonade and when I drive by u swear it calls my name. Also love the avocado toast."}
{"text":"I don't know how I just now discovered this place but am so glad I did! I have never tried an Acai bowl before and was blown away by how delicious it was. It tastes almost like a berry smoothie in a bowl and you can add your own toppings. Everything was super fresh and flavorful. Their cold pressed juices are a little more pricey at $9/bottle but well worth it and come in a large and beautiful glass bottle."}
{"text":"Juice is ok - no different from Zest. The biggest issue is parking - it's literally impossible to find a spot with a reasonable distance unless you pay to park in a garage which is absurd to just pick up something quick.  Not worth the effort. Move to a more accessible location."}
{"text":"I love that this place is in downtown and is a walk away from where I live! I did the 3-day juice cleanse (my first one!) and all the juices were fresh and surprisingly very palatable. I've also tried their açai bowl (with granola, almond butter, and banana) which was light and delicious, especially after a workout class. Staff is friendly and helpful as well. Will definitely keep coming back, and would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Love getting the Acai bowl here!!!! I usually get strawberries, banana, and coconut on top. I have gotten peanut butter too, which tasted great but the texture was a little weird for me mixed with the smoothie bowl. There's a great atmosphere here as well, so trendy and welcoming. I come here as often as I can, even though it's a drive for me!"}
{"text":"I had the avocado toast with turkey and it was so delicious and light. I combined it with the 01 Detox juice and it was a great meal. I will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Stopped in this morning for the first time! I am loving the Almond, Coffee, Raw Honey + Vanilla drink! I can definitely tell that the almond milk is home made. See you guys for lunch, I can't wait for some oatmeal!"}
{"text":"We came here for the first time today (residents of East 4th street) and tried the kombucha, an acai bowl and the #4 smoothie. Everything was great and this place has a really good vibe. Staff is friendly and even in a huge rush while we were here the service didn't suffer. Seriously this place is great. We will be coming back often! Can't wait to try more items off the menu. Way to go Restore."}
{"text":"Avacado toast is out of this world. Juice was great. Nice people working at the shop. Check it out."}
{"text":"Stopped here between class with two friends. OMG how have I not been here sooner?! I got an açai bowl and fresh coconut water and both were amazing. My friends each got smoothies and loved them. Everything is made fresh in front of you. My coconut water was even juiced to order. The staff is super friendly and Ali was so knowledgable and helpful. I'm officially hooked."}
{"text":"First of their lattes is perfection. Best latte I have had in the area. The baristas are nice and good he menu wholesome and healthy-check it out!"}
{"text":"Are you into juicing or healthy eating? Then, Restore is for you!  I come often here to grab my raw juice or avocado toast. You have different options of raw organic juices for detox or immunity, with nuts or plant fix. Also, their Acai bowls taste wonderful!  During the day time, the place is half-busy, so you can come to work with your laptop. I like minimalistic interior and wood tables.  5 star"}
{"text":"Restore is a hip and modern cold pressed juice and smoothie joint that also serves bowls, avocado toasts, ginger + tumeric shots, coffee, matcha and bone broth. All the healthy things. They only use organic fruits and vegetables and all juices are fresh pressed each morning and smoothies are made to order. They also offer whole juice cleanses if your into that.  It was a little small and pretty busy when I visited which I'm sure is the norm. But they do a lot of take out orders. I decided to just get 2 juices to go. Plant Fix 04 and Immunity 07. Super potent and vibrant blends with no added sugars. I loved that they had plant only juice options that included zero fruit so I didn't have to worry about the insane sugar content that comes with a lot of juices. They come in 16oz glass bottles that are reusable or recyclable. They are about $10.00 a pop which isn't bad because if you're drinking juices right, each bottle is at least 2 servings. They also had some vegan treats from a local baker at the counter. The cashier was also friendly and I loved that when she was packing my bag to go, she used napkins to grab the paper straws to keep from touching what I would soon be putting in my mouth. It's the little things lol"}
{"text":"Don't be alarmed by the prices... I had the cheapest smoothie ($8) and I feel like it completely cleared my sinuses and helped with my cough (I went when I was sick). This place does wonders and it's very cute inside!!"}
{"text":"I love Restore. The staff are so friendly and knowledgable and a great resource if you have questions about any of the food there. I work within walking distance so it can be dangerous - I go there too much! I love the acai bowls, smoothies and avocado toasts. There's also free wifi so it's easy to sit and relax with your bowl and a primal coffee and get some work done.  The only downside? It is slightly pricey - but you get what you pay for and I've never had anything I didn't like!"}
{"text":"If I could give RESTORE 5+ stars, I would.  Aesthetically, the space is beautiful. Reclaimed wood furniture, modern lighting fixtures and interesting terrariums fill the room. It's a surprisingly large space inside, with plenty of seating throughout. The wi-fi connection is stable, which is a huge plus if you want to make it your office for a day. They always have low indie pop/rock music playing, which doesn't distract me while I'm working on my laptop. The seating also nicely accommodates meetings.  RESTORE is committed to recycling, so save your glass bottle for 50 cents off your next purchase. If you see a juice on the menu you know you want to try, I would also consider calling beforehand to check if its sold out. Some juices sell out on busy days! From the cold pressed juices, the \"Nut\" really stands out for me. I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but the mix of almonds, cold brew coffee, raw honey and vanilla has a good caffeine kick to it. Paired with the \"#2\" avocado toast, this combo is a bulletproof winner for an organic, satisfying breakfast that keeps you full most of the day...and feeling pretty guilt-free!"}
{"text":"Restore is literally life!!! Best acai bowels in Ohio. And the avocado toast with smoke salmon is to die for. Relaxing environment with friendly people. Weekly must for me"}
{"text":"This was my second visit to Restore Cold Pressed. I believe the first time was shortly after they opened this location. Clearly, the word got out because this place is bumping on a Sunday morning. This is the first time I've hopped on the bone broth trend but this cold is getting the best of, so I caved. Let me tell you what, this shi* is delicious. You got me, Restore. I've also had the pleasure of enjoying their açaí bowls $10 and cold pressed juices $10 (higher price is matched with a higher serving size). On top of all off this, they also offer a variety of avocado toasts, smoothies and a variety of coffee offerings.   If I lived in Cleveland, you'd probably find me throwing up my laptop and working here for a few hours whilst treating myself to healthy delicacies. The floor to ceiling windows offer great lighting and the reclaimed wood tables are lovely. Note that there is only enough seating for around 20-25 people. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Note that their açaí bowls are somewhat build your own with the selection of three garnishes per bowl. Extras available at cost. Thanks for the fuel and good vibes, Restore!"}
{"text":"I was downtown for practice at Inner Bliss, and had a taste for either a smoothie or a coffee. Imagine my delight when I found that Restore has a smoothie that has coffee in it! Yes! Cold brew coffee, date, hemp seed, banana, peanut butter & almond milk blended together made for a great drink. My only wish was that it was a little bit thicker- with more of a smoothie consistency. I loved the space, the staff and the vibe!"}
{"text":"My life will never be the same having tried Restore. Is it expensive? Yes. Is it worth it? Heck yes! Everything is SO fresh.  The primal coffee is the best Coffee I have had in cleveland. The acai bowl is the perfect treat. And their avocado toast was perfection. Also, the restaurant is spacious and rustic, such a beautiful space. I wish there was a location on the west side somewhere. They would have allll my money, all the time. The location in public square is difficult to get to unless you work downtown. But like I said, it's worth it."}
{"text":"If you are interested in your health and healthy food options, Restore is a great option. I was drawn to Restore because of their Acai bowl. They have many options for toppings you can choose from (peanut butter, chia seeds, strawberries, bananas, coconut, and many others). The first time I ever went, I got the Acai bowl and then I started noticing the Dragonfruit bowl. This bowl was also delicious. It is a bright pink color and taste refreshing and tropical, whereas the Acai bowl is a dark purple and has a sweeter taste.   Restore also has amazing avocado toast! I don't even like avocados and somehow I can still annihilate their avocado toast. Hands down the best I've ever had.  They also have a bunch of juices, but I have not tried any of those.   The seating is limited, so you will definitely be sitting at a table with people you don't know.  I love going to Restore because I care about my health and what I put into my body, and I never have to question what I'm getting at Restore and know my body is thanking me! It is prettyyyy pricey but that is because what you are getting is quality."}
{"text":"Really great place when you're in the mood for clean and healthy eating and drinking. I love their juices and smoothies, and I can grab an order of the avocado toast and make a lunch of that. Yes, it's on the expensive side, and yes, it's worth it. Happy to have this in my work neighborhood."}
{"text":"I heard about this new place from a friend, and upon checking it out on Yelp I found that it had awesome reviews! The atmosphere was nice and the employees were very friendly. However, all the juices on the menu are not always necessarily available, which I personally found a bit misleading. I had looked at the menu prior to going, and I was disappointed that they didn't have the one I wanted. I ended up with the #8 (spinach, kale, pear, lemon, ginger) which was pretty good, and they let me sample it first. I was willing to pay the $9 because it tasted very fresh and the glass bottle is pretty enough to reuse, but I can't say that I'd spend that much on a regular basis. In addition to the juice, I had an oatmeal bowl with banana, almond butter, and coconut flakes. The oatmeal was cold as though it was refrigerated, I've never had it served that way and I honestly didn't love it. The almond butter was a good addition, but wasn't enough to make me want to finish the very small portion. I think I will return to try the acai bowl, which, hindsight being 20/20, sounds much more appetizing than cold oatmeal."}
{"text":"Superb cold pressed juices - every bit as good as Juice Served Here - and fantastic smoothies made w/o ice."}
{"text":"Ah the modern, clean, and sleek feel of Restore Cold Pressed makes it such an appealing place to visit! The employees here are incredibly friendly and helpful in giving recommendations. I ended up getting the Plant Fix juice (#8), which is made from spinach, kale, pear, lemon, and ginger. The jars that the juices come in are super cute (and reusable!), and the juice was very tasty and refreshing but it cost $10 (!!!) so definitely not a drink I can afford on a regular basis. I also ordered the avocado toast, but to be honest, I was pretty disappointed by this item. I had read other Yelpers' great reviews about the toast, but my toast was so salty I was trying not to cringe while eating it. Maybe it was just a fluke and whoever made my toast put too much salt on it this time, but I don't think I will be getting the toast again anytime soon.   Aside from the green juices, the nut milk sounded really good - definitely an item I would like to try next time I'm here! They also have pretty delicious-looking acai bowls here as well.  Overall, a very nice place to drop by for some fresh juice on the go, to catch up with friends, or to camp out for a few hours to work or study. There is also free wifi here (the info is posted at the edge of their tables!), so that's a plus. Just be aware of the price point at Restore - otherwise, a place worth trying out at least once!"}
{"text":"I just left here with takeout.  I got the avocado toast and added salmon and an acai bowl with coconut, peanut butter and granola.  Everything is delicious as I'm eating it at my house.  The bowl is pretty decent sized, and the toast actually came with 2 pieces. The space is cool, super lofty with awesome music playing and lots of people working on computers and stuff.  A little pricey, I paid 17$ total and I didn't even get a juice, but its very comparable to other juice places like Beet Jar.  Definitely give it a try if you're interested in healthy eating.  They also have cleanses that I would love to try.  If you bring back your rinsed out juice bottle you get 50 cents off your next juice as well."}
{"text":"This is a great new addition to downtown! The store is completely what you would want it to be, insanely clean and gives off a cool/modern vibe.   The juices are amazing, I could never make one as good myself.... I mean how can something with beets in it taste so delicious!  I love the avocado toast. The serving is huge (at least a full avocado) and big enough to eat for lunch."}
{"text":"The Avocado Toast with salmon is by far the best thing on the menu (in my opinion). BUT, I was not impressed at al by the acai bowls. I am a total Alchemy Juice Bar fanatic, so Restore just didn't really do it for me. They only let you pick like two or three toppings and any others you have to pay extra. The toppings come on each of the bowls at Alchemy and there are WAY more bowls and menu items to choose from."}
{"text":"Amazing juice! Was in Cleveland for an event and got juice from here every day... Awesome juice recipes, super fresh, and awesome people working there. My only complaint is there isn't one in Florida and I can't order their cleanses online :) gotta wait to go back..."}
{"text":"Fun and spot on when you need a pick me up. The juices are are fantastic and prepare which is fine especially if you don't have time to wait. The avocado toast was good."}
{"text":"The juices were awesome. I had a juice of the day which was watermelon and mint, it was really refreshing after walking around for a few hours. The staff were very informative and helpful, and kind enough to pour us some iced waters when we asked. The juices are all made fresh and have awesome ingredients like kale or beets - super foods. The only downside is the price, for a typical glass bottle it costs $9. If I'm in Cleveland again I would like to try the smoothies! Oh and the interior is minimalist and clean - love the simple layout."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh! Had the greenest juice, avocado toast, smoothies, and turmeric latte (with 2 shots espresso). Definitely recommend ! **Do not come here if you are in a rush- this place moves slower**"}
{"text":"You won't be disappointed! Restore in Cleveland is just as wonderful as the Jackson Township Restore.    Everything leaves you feeling refreshed! Check their açaí bowl, avocado toast, and juices! Although products are supreme, their prices are rather high."}
{"text":"Awesome place.  I love how they encourage you to stay there and hang out. Most juice places are grab and go, but they really create a very welcoming atmosphere. Wifi passwords available on the tables--GENIUS. Makes life so much easier. The seating area is great for hanging out, catching up on work, or just staring into space.  The juices/smoothies have been hit or miss for me. The ones that I didn't like...I REALLY didn't like. But the ones that I did like...I REALLY did like. Granted, I have a huge sweet tooth, so when I ordered one of the coffee-type juices it was way way too bitter and I couldn't stand more than a few sips. But for people who don't pour splenda into their lattes, I could see them enjoying it.  My favorite is the acai bowl--so yummy, filling, and healthy. A great lunch. I have been meaning to try avo toast but honestly I can't stay away from the acai bowl. I also had the #6 smoothie and it was incredible.  Also, I just have to add that everyone who works here is great. SO FRIENDLY. SO NICE. They genuinely want to get to know the people who come into their store. I've had some nice conversations with the employees here.  *Terminator voice** I'll be back."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere. Avocado toast was great but need more salt. Smoothly and their bowl which I have no idea what it was but it tasted great."}
{"text":"I'm desperately trying to get into the juicing in order to give my digestive system a break once or  twice a month but had been struggling mightily to enjoy it. I tried another juice location in town a month or so ago and it deterred me from the scene.   Today I gave Restore a chance and it really blew me away. Restore found a way to make even green plant-based juices really good. This is the best option in Cleveland, hands down.   Also: A+ for the fantastic customer service"}
{"text":"Mmmmm juice!  It was my day off and I had been dying to try this place, but due to 1.) not working in downtown and 2.) the early closing hours, I have never been able to make it down to Restore... until today.  The menu is impressive- all types of juices (plant, nut, immunity, etc) plus smoothies plus acai or oatmeal bowls with a ton of healthy toppings plus duck rabbit coffee plus avocado toast, down to even bonebroth- they really do offer a lot!  We decided to go with the detox juice- beets, apples, carrot and lemon- and it was delicious. It was well balanced and just so refreshing- I was surprised at how energized I felt afterwards-and to think, I had almost succumbed to my normal afternoon coffee.  Oh and save the glass bottle too- on your next visit, you can get 50 cents off. :)  I can't wait to try the other juices! Absolutely delicious and so worth the try."}
{"text":"I la-la-LOVE the acai smoothie bowls here. I get mine with strawberries, cacao nibs, and granola, and I'm usually in such ecstasy that the traffic I face afterward design bother me one bit."}
{"text":"This place is great for a healthy snack... If you know anything about me , that's not my MO lol! The place is cute/trendy and everyone that goes there is gorgous coming from the yoga class around the corner. But I stop by for the smoothies! they are 9$-10$ but i'm telling you so good!"}
{"text":"Restore is my go-to lunch and breakfast spot! It's so healthy and delicious. I always feel good after eating here. The juices are all delicious, but my favorite is the orange and turmeric. The #1 Beet is also great and the #3 Immunity is good too. The #1 avocado toast is amazing, I highly recommend it. My favorite thing on the menu, especially on a hot day, is the dragonfruit bowl!   The owners are great and so is the staff. The place is always clean and inviting. I can't say enough good things about Restore!"}
{"text":"Nice selection of organic juices ready to grab and go. Staff was friendly and the toast tasted great as well!"}
{"text":"The juices here are really really good. Ingredients are fresh. And the experience is pleasant. I work near by and this suits for an alternative to a meal."}
{"text":"Really nice lofty and spacious storefront with high ceilings and a modern feel. I could definitely see spending some time here working.   Having never been in here before I asked the worker what was good and she asked if I wanted a juice or a smoothie. I said smoothie and she recommended #1 as most popular, which is what I ultimately got. This smoothie contained blueberry, banana, coconut oil, flaxseed, agave and almond milk. There were half a dozen more options with the worker's favorite being one with a hint of ginger in it.   If you don't want a smoothie ($8-10) the menu is pretty diverse and offers other options. There are plain juices mixed in creative combinations. There is a toast menu much like the Cleveland Tea Revival one in Hingetown - though much more substantial. Here you can have the option to add meat to the toast to make it more of a lunch. What I want to come back here to try however is the breakfast options. They have some oatmeal bowls that sound great."}
{"text":"Restore is so fresh and fun! All the pressed juices are so delicious and refreshing. The acai bowls are my new thing and I highly recommend trying them! I personally love to add the coconut flakes on top! Don't get intimidated by the menu, the workers are so friendly and helpful! Also you HAVE to try the Nut cold brew - it's soo yummy! Im not even a regular coffee drinker and let me tell ya, it's amazing!  The prices are def a little high but it's truly worth it. I've never tried anything I didn't like! And I always feel refreshed and energized afterward."}
{"text":"Awesome Decour! Very friendly service. I was walking by craving an Acai bowl, as they were closing up they were nice enough to let me in to get an amazing açai bowl.  Wish I was in town to try their yoga"}
{"text":"A little bit pricey, but well worth it! My acai smoothie bowl was delicious. You can put any toppings you want as well. The granola is amazing."}
{"text":"On vacation in Cleveland and was so excited to find this place down the street from our hotel! So yummy. Everything is amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Favorite place downtown by far for lattes, did like that they had matcha as well something that is very rare in Cleveland. The juices all looked great and I loved the whole space when I walked in and everything was great. They have other locations too in Hudson and canton and some opening up on the east side, the employees told me. Definitely planning on trying the other locations out!"}
{"text":"This oh-so-trendy cafe won't exactly get you very far in terms of affordability, but it will leave you feeling like a certified health nut for the rest of the day. I've come here a handful of times and have gotten both their juice and avocado toast and really enjoyed both of them. Their juices are pricey, averaging out at about $9 a bottle, but they are meant to be 2-3 servings so I usually save half the bottle for the next day. They also allow customers to try any of their juices on offer so you can make sure it's to your taste before buying the whole bottle. The standout for me though is their avocado toast which is always perfectly made and well seasoned, especially with the roasted turkey on top. The cafe has a nice vibe with big bright windows and large tables so I often choose to come here when meeting a friend for lunch. While I initially thought it was the type of place that was too expensive for me to return, I have been back several times on treat yourself days. I would recommend if you are interested to try juicing, or if you're a fan of avocado toast."}
