{"text":"I should have checked the box before I got home. I ordered for pickup. I understand this is a pizza place but I paid over $10 for 5 burnt chicken fingers and 10 burnt fries. I LITERALLY counted 10 fries. How was that acceptable to serve on a plate as a cook and then as a cashier how could you let someone walk out with that? I was so hungry and too pissed to go back when I got home. Extremely disappointed with the sky pointe location."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the north west area,if you like pizza from NY or NJ. Which I do! Born and raised on the easy coast,I didn't realize how good I had it when it came to pizza! Moving out to Vegas,I found out fast the pizza out here was pizza pretending to be pizza lol or trying.. Now Rocco's pizza by red rock is VERY GOOD! Mmm. BUT..it's far from me."}
{"text":"Amazing service and the pizza was to die for. I understand why this place is Best of Las Vegas four years in a row."}
{"text":"this place is good. i love pizza, it does get soggy really quick due the the grease. i love my pizza's crispy. i always have them extra well done which comes out perfect for my tasting. the ingredients they use taste very fresh. meatballs are to die for and the pizza's are huge. not to mention the deals they have on thurs and sun. bogo for carryout. yum yum goodness. actually had metro the other day."}
{"text":"Great server. We ate here with the kids last Sunday and we sat at the patio.  Great time and experience. The manager even came out to check up on us.  Garlic Romano Fries was awesome. Abbodanza - da bomb!  We will surely be back at this pizzeria."}
{"text":"i have  ordered over 30 pizza from them... however ive called in over 10 times because ordered was not right when it reached my residents i never write reviews but this time it was unacceptable.  i waited over a hour for my pizza when they driver came i asked to use my card he said i had to do it when i placed the order so i apologized an asked if it could be done an to call he refused so at this point i looked around the house for extra money an couldnt find anything but a extra 100$ emergency bill i keep in my wallet so i asked if he could give me change he said no again an started walking off i could not understand why he would treat a customer like that. so he left with my pizza an drinks completely unacceptable.    i called metro pizza back an talked to cynthia on the phone (manager) she said sorry we can take your card info however the driver had already left for atleast 15 min an i asked him at first to call an he wouldnt these people have no class an could care less about their customers i was very loyal an spent atleast 800-1000$ with them just on pizza,salads an drinks they dont deserve to be making all this money an not care about their customers at all i have a son thats hungry an my wife as im making them waiting to find somewhere else to eat cause im writing this review this has to stop an it stops buy us the customers giving them so much MONEY."}
{"text":"With half an hour to kill and a hankerin' for some greasy pizza, I walked into Metro Pizza one afternoon to grab a bite.  After having a hostess ask \"For you?\" when I told her I was looking to get some lunch, I was seated at a table with a checkered tablecloth reminiscent of every other pizza joint I've ever been to.  What wasn't familiar, though, was the bizarre decorative choices made in this restaurant, seemingly in the late 80's (which was likely also the last time they cleaned the walls). Imagine cotton-candy blue and pink pastels, and then imagine that they somehow devised a way to make these colors less vibrant. Throw in some neon tubes and a horribly-misplaced wooden wine rack for good measure, and you've got Metro Pizza.  Confusing decor aside, I expected a good meal based on my experiences at the Tropicana location. An individual cheese pizza took them a satisfactory amount of time to cook and serve to me, and the staff's disposition was sufficiently cheery (though the bowtie on one of the waiters was a bit creepy). Grease dripping from the folded slice in my hand, I said a quick prayer and took a bite.  When I said up top that I wanted some greasy pizza, perhaps I should have been a bit more careful what I wished for. The river that slopped out of this slice of pizza would be enough to clog the arteries of an elephant. Despite the liberal application of pizza grease to this concoction, it didn't taste bad. I likened it to a less-disgusting version of Pistol Pete's (or Chuck-E-Cheese's) pizza, which I always thought was half-decent.  If you didn't stop reading my review after that last statement, thanks.  I finished my pizza (which must mean it's not that bad, right?) and settled my check, then headed out the door. I left disappointed -- and wanting a shower -- not necessarily because of the food itself (which would merit three stars on its own) but more by the general nastiness and creepiness of the establishment that I had just given twelve dollars.  The first thing Metro Pizza needs to do is take everything out of the place and paint the whole thing one color (and not in pastels, please). The cotton-candy walls and columns made my teeth hurt. Also, lose the neon. Nobody likes neon anymore, especially when it matches the pastel walls.  Let a bit more light into the place, mop the floors and wipe down the walls every now and then, and they'll have a nicer restaurant on their hands. I can't make a better pizza so I can't tell them how to change theirs, but less gut-busting grease would be nice.  If you're going to go to Metro Pizza, go to the one on Tropicana and Maryland. Let this one either realize the mistakes its making, or let it die the death it should have had years ago."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Food was great, sourdough bread they give you when you arrive is good, HELL the pizza was amazing. I loved the sauce on the pizza. I would go there again"}
{"text":"Went to dinner with my boyfriends family tonight and despite having about 10 people and a baby we were seated fast. I was surprised to see that we only had one server. It took about 15 minutes for drinks, another 5 for bread, 15 minutes to take orders, and then 45 minutes to actually receive our food!!! First the most part the food is great, but they forget to mention that their thin crust is just thick crust just not as thick as the \"metro\" way. You have to ask for extra thin crust for something nice and crunchy...they will not offer it to you. Also one entre of meatball sliders came out with cold centered meatballs. You could tell our waitress was annoyed, which was uncomfortable...but I couldn't blame her...no one should have to handle huge parties by themselves. Based on other reviews, they either need stronger more experienced waiters, or they need to have more working."}
{"text":"Nette Bedienung------keine unnötigen Schnörkel -----Möblierung könnte mal erneuert werden----aber worauf es ankommt Pizza Pizza Pizza in hervorragender Qualität zwei Sorten Teig dünn oder richtig dick-----beides traumhaft das Paradies für Pizzafreaks---"}
{"text":"Worst service I have ever received. Me and my girlfriends came in for lunch and it took over 45 minutes to get our food, a table that came in 20 minutes after us got their food at the same time. When I asked to speak to the manger all he said was ok is there anything I can do he did not even apologize although received 25% off.  Anytime we asked for anything our server completely ignored us so we would have to ask multiple servers before actually receiving it. great food but unfortunately would probably not come back because of the service."}
{"text":"Recently ordered this while in Vegas.. It was expensive $70 pizza.. two large, and two orders of fries plus delivery charge. Delivery time took over an hour when it was promised to be under that. The pizza was pretty warm though so most likely they got a little busy.   The pizza was excellent. Not the best that I've had but it's definitely up there and better than your regular chains, Papa Johns, Domino's, Pizza Hut, etc. This place definitely doesn't skimp on the toppings either.. the veggie and meat lovers were LOADED with toppings dropping all over the place. The fries were good. The nuclear fries were hot but nothing to go raving about. I'd order from here again, but would definitely try to find a coupon or some sort of discount."}
{"text":"The pizza was good and the salad was huge.  However, this particular Metro location on Horizon Ridge is always extremely slow in getting your food to you and many times the pizza is cold.  Yesterday the waitress totally  forgot our order after a 35 minute wait. She didn't apologize but took 5 percent off our bill. So if you go just be be prepared for long waits to get your food. This is going to be our last visit after 10 times of being loyal customers. Enough is enough. They need a floor manager to be on top these issues."}
{"text":"Metro's pizza is very good. However, $29.13 ($26.95 plus tax) for a large specialty pizza is extremely high for what you get. Was this worth 30 bucks? No.  Also, spread the goodies around more evenly!"}
{"text":"I came here and was so disappointed. I had heard about how great their food is, but we didn't even get to eat! Our waiter was some middle aged looking guy. He took our order and brought our breadsticks and drinks. We then waited for over an HOUR for our pizza. We watched people who came before and after us getting their food. Our waiter walked by us several times and would make weird awkward eye contact with us but would never check on us to see how we were or to give any explanation as to why it was taking so long for such a simple order. We decided to cut our losses and go to Dominos.  I'm only rating two stars because our hostess was very nice and apologetic about the entire situation."}
{"text":"Good food and a fun, casual atmosphere. We've been going to Metro Pizza for years (even at the other locations) and the food is always consistently great! The only downside is that it gets busy and there can be long waits- but that's probably a good sign :)"}
{"text":"I cannot figure out how Metro continues to win \"Best Pizza.\"  We have been going to Metro for years and over the last 3 visits the food has deteriorated to inedible.  The pizza has been tough, greasy and tasteless.  The appearance looked as if someone had thrown up all over it.  Cheese and meat were hard to find in the mush.  None of the pictures of pizza in these reviews looked like ours.  Unfortunately, when we told the waitress this was the worst pizza we have ever had at this restaurant, she just shrugged her shoulders and walked away.  They must think that because they have been voted \"Best\" people will eat anything.  Well, 3 times and you're out, literally.  We will not return."}
{"text":"In the old days the ride to Vegas was filled with thoughts of shrimp cocktail at the Golden Gate. Now it's a run to Metro Pizza. The old New York with sauce on top of the cheese is especially good. Others have remarked it's pricy. Yeah, SO? This pizza is worth it. In my top 10."}
{"text":"I wish I could give 3.5 stars, as I feel 3 is low but 4 too high. If I was grading solely on service, I would have given 4 stars. If I was grading solely on food, 3 stars.    We went for lunch, and it was packed. Even so, we were seated quickly, and our sodas brought immediately. We ordered two large pizzas and two kids pizzas, and it took about 35 minutes to get them. Our server was quick to bring refills on drinks, extra napkins, etc.  The large pizzas were a bit pricey at $23-$26 each. However, there were plenty of left overs for anther meal.  The crust was really good, I loved the snap and bite of it.  My toppings weren't as warm/cooked through as I would have liked, the cheese not quite melty enough. This might have been due to an effort to get all of the pizzas out quickly.  My kids each ordered the kids cheese pizza, which was surprisingly large for only $5, including a soda. It came in a frying pan which they found hilarious. (The pan was completely cool, no burn hazards here!)"}
{"text":"This place was really good. Wait staff was great and friendly. Kid friendly and lots of seating. Pizza was really good and ingredients were all fresh. We were here visiting from AZ and looking for something close to our timeshare and we found a great place here. Appetizer spinach artichoke dip was made fresh would recommend. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Love this place! Excellent service, excellent pizza and pasta. The bread was fantastic. Family friendly without being annoying to non-kid tables."}
{"text":"Come once a month with my sibling and the service has always been great and they don't seem to mind taking down our orders of custom pizzas and extra crispy wings, if u love pizza come to Metro Bruh"}
{"text":"Horrible service from the guy that is working as a bartender. We ordered waters and ice tea and we got them 35 minutes later. We also ordered food with our drinks and got our food 50 minutes later. We were disappointed with his service and I told him that and he threw me an excuse of how he is really busy. Other tables around us got their checks before their food even got to their table. They were forgetting things left and right. Horrible service. I would not recommend this location to any one and I'm never coming back here again."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places to go since I don't eat pizza but the hubby and kiddo do!  The eggplant parm is soooo yummy and even more so the next day for lunch!  Our server was a bit on the slow side but we were taken care of by the Manager and left happy...as usual"}
{"text":"We've been going to this location of Metro Pizza for at least 8+ years now (and the Decatur location before that for a couple years), at least once per month and more recently about once per week!!  Metro has some of the BEST pizza I've ever eaten.  For a long time, our favorite was \"The Metro\" which is a super, super thick crust, but a couple years ago, we tried the original thin crust, and I found a new favorite!! As for service, Metro has some of the BEST service anywhere.  Even before we were regulars, we were treated great by MOST employees... and those employees that weren't the friendliest didn't last long working there.  Those employees that have remained all these years are genuinely friendly & professional!!  For years, Susan was our favorite server... she is now the Manager!  David has become our new favorite server!!  But ALL the servers are great, the hostesses are super nice & helpful, and the busboys are prompt & friendly & willing to help out with whatever as well! Quality of food is totally awesome about 98% of the time... once in a while the bread is a little undercooked... gummy & doughy inside... and about 1 in 25 times the pizza is a little bit burnt, but not bad enough to make it inedible!  Only once did we ever get a pizza that we couldn't eat, and they offered to remake it immediately!  Overall, the flavors are delicious!!  Two of us get one small pizza and between the free bread and the great filling pizza, it's more than enough for us... and that makes a very reasonably priced dinner for two!  They also make GREAT cannoli as well!  Tastes awesome & I believe they make them themselves!  Every time friends or family come to town, we always take them to Metro at least once, and every dish anyone has ever tried has been great!  They always thank us for taking them there and ask to go back the next time they come to town!  Metro Pizza is by far my favorite pizza restaurant in Las Vegas!!  If you haven't tried them yet, you're missing out on the BEST pizza around!"}
{"text":"Pizza choices are great, especially if you are dining in like we did. The pizza was served fresh and hot. We had a party of 6 and we ordered salad, garlic knots, garlic Romano fries, and the meatball-basil-garlic pizza. The portions are large and served family style.  I always make sure to order the garlic knots and the garlic Romano fries no matter what. They are unlike anything in Vegas and it will not disappoint. The customer service were attentive and they were always making sure we were taken care of."}
{"text":"Great pizza and I am NOT a pizza fan. Delicious minestrone soup. Had it delivered and they were quick and timely. I now want to try more of their menu."}
{"text":"I have been going to metro pizza for the 24 years I've being living in Las Vegas, I will never go back after today! Ordered my usual , small metro and nuke fries! Fries came perfect as usual pizza came looked like a normal pizza. Talked to bartender who has been serving me for years and he told me manager is busy get to me when he can! Came 15 minutes later told him this is not thick crust, he argued with me. I then asked to pay bill for a pizza for my kids and fries I ordered! Was rude and will never go back again! 24 years a loyal customer! Plenty of great places for pizza now! Better watch out for your customer service!"}
{"text":"yummy!  We stumbled upon this after attending an event in Vegas and just needed to find a place to eat.  I usually am so picky about pizza that I won't go to just any place but we needed to eat.  The pizza was very good.  The salad were tasty.  So much so we bought a bottle of the dressing to take home with us."}
{"text":"Very good pizza. Fresh ingredients and a variety of crusts; something for every taste. Service was friendly and efficient."}
{"text":"Their service was great. They made me feel welcomed and the place was very clean. However I did not find their pizza as tasty.... not bad though."}
{"text":"Favorite pizza restaurant.   Altho we cannot eat cheese, Metro always makes the pizza with enough toppings that we don't feel deprived.  We take home half of large pizza and have dinner the next day.   What a bargain!"}
{"text":"MOST DISGUSTING TASTELESS PIZZA I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY ENTIRE LIFE!!! I SWEAR the sauce on the pizza was Hunt's tomato paste! And if it wasn't  that is what it tasted like! What happened with this location Metro Pizza??? The Tropicana and Flamingo locations are freakin amazing!!! This one is just BAD BAD BAD!! So disappointing :("}
{"text":"This place is overpriced for mediocre pizza, $50 + tip and the didn't deliver paper plates, napkins, or parmigian. Thanks, really cool for my 3 kids."}
{"text":"Metro has great pizza (served piping hot on silver stands) and solidly decent calzones and pasta.  The best part about Metro is the atmosphere: The tables are covered in white butcher paper and each table is given a pile of crayons.  While this may be a ploy to distract customers from the hungry anxiety of waiting for their order (you can't watch steaming pizzas carried through the restaurant - past your table - while you're occupied with tic-tac-toe), the wait hasn't been unbearably long in my experience.  They also have theme nights, like 70's/Woodstock and Hawaiian.  I seem to remember something about dressing up and getting some sort of discount.  This is great place for a lively group outing.  (The Flamingo/Decatur location is slightly more intimate).  In sum: A casual, fun place with good pizza."}
{"text":"I have been a regular Friday customer of metro pizza for seven years. My husband would grab two pies on his way home from work from the trop location. Always had the best pizza. And it's quite the haul to our house so the pizza was always somewhat cold. We didn't mind though. The pizza was always perfect. When they opened the sky pointe store we were very excited because we would have hot pizza. The last several weeks, however, the pizza  has been awful. The sauce seems watered down, the outer crust is so flaky it crumbles with every bite and the center of the pizza has been soggy.  Another wonderful pizza place trying to be a chain and seems to be failing."}
{"text":"I wish this was in my town! The pizza was really good. The crust was delicious as was the toppings on the pizza I wish I had tried some of the other appetizers or had more time to try a calzone. We got the Gotham pizza with no mushrooms. I could only eat a slice since it was so filling.       The bread that you get at the beginning was delicious as well."}
{"text":"Okay this review is about the pizza first of all $25 is to much for a Nasty ass pizza cover in  sun dried tomatoes OMG the worst pizza ever"}
{"text":"First choice for \"cheat day\" meal. I have never had a bad pizza here and they give you yummy bread before your meal.   Sometimes service can be slow but the staff is great other than that."}
{"text":"Some people like you but my experience has left me wanting a good slice of pie!  I ordered your pizza twice now and both times its left me wishing I had not believed the hype! Margherita Pizza here is so so sad, no real tomatoes just a drizzle of sauce, barely any cheese at all & the middle of the pizza is soggy/sloppy.  I love a good Margherita Pizza and if you ever find yourself at metro pizza avoid this item!"}
{"text":"Horrible experience went there while in Vegas for the pizza expo was told when we arrived there would be a 30 minute wait over an hour later and watching the staff failing to take care of numerous customers the hostess seated a group that had gotten there 30minutes after we had we left without even getting seated"}
{"text":"Food are great here especially their pizzas. Their service is very slow and our server was Maria, she'll disappeared for quite sometime and we had to wave her down a lot even when we tried to get our bill paid, Maria still nowhere  to be found, lol. Where is the manager here?? Service thumbs down. Maria didn't seem much to care for her customers, but for one particular table she sat down at the table with the customers, chit chat for quite sometime, we find very unprofessional, seems like we were invisible to her. HER NAME WAS \" MARIA\", she needs to learn customer service if she still in this business."}
{"text":"Metro has the best pizza!  Actually everything is delicious.  You can't go wrong here with whatever you order.  Great catering menu too. We have been eating here for over 15 years."}
{"text":"Very good pizza,  been eating there for 20+ years,  even when I owned a pizza shop across the street 15 years ago... Recommend highly"}
{"text":"Been going to Metro Pizza since I moved here in 1990. We've been to all their stores that are very good and the pizza is consistently delicious. Lately I've been going to the Metro on Sky Point Drive in the northwest. Many times it's so crowded because it's the best around."}
{"text":"The female bartender with short black hair sucks.  She's rude and has no customer service skills.  I understand having a bad day, but call in next time or something, instead of being a shit head.  Manager said he'd take care of us, but we left the to go order and said no thanks."}
{"text":"\"Came For The Pretty Great Pizza but Stayed Longer For The Crazy Calzone\"  Interesting location within the Ellis Island Casino. Not fancy, mostly locals. I went for dinner with my husband, but he had already eaten a few hours before. I on the other hand, had not eaten since breakfast. I ordered a small pepperoni/mushroom pizza. It took about 10-15 minutes, which seemed an eternity since I was so hungry.  It finally came. The cheese melted just right. It wasn't greasy and the crust was perfect. Pizza was cooked evenly. I took my first bite. It was so delicious. I asked my husband to try it. He did and also loved it. Pretty soon I could tell that one pizza would not cut it for the both of us, so we ordered a three cheese calzone. After 10 minutes, here comes the calzone accompanied by light tomato based sauce. It was huge. We had to wait about 5 minutes to cut into it, way too hot. The melted three cheese delicious stuffing was amazing. I think it is made of a blend of mozzarella, ricotta, and romano cheeses.   I have to say that the pizza was truly delicious, but the calzone was the very best one I have ever had. When in Vegas, please do stop by this Metro Pizza location. As mentioned above, it is definitely not fancy, but prices are fair and I believe cheaper than their other locations throughout Vegas. Also, a great place to people watch."}
{"text":"I ordered a sunspot pizza about 2 weeks ago when it arrived it looked like it had been dropped the toppings were all pushed to one side including the cheese I also ordered the nuclear french fries which consisted of fries with a cayenne pepper over them wasn't overly impressed in fact I was very disappointed with the entire meal I do have to give credit to the manager who refunded me over half of the price which was nearly 50 dollars for pizza and fries"}
{"text":"best east coast style thin crust in vegas. nuf said."}
{"text":"THIS REVIEW IS FOR A TAKE HOME ORDER.  My significant other was at this establishment for a work function. I asked him to bring me back an order, since he was having dinner there. (why cook when he already ate?) I had him order the spaghetti with meat sauce.   I was stoked for him to arrive home. I immediately fixed a bowl full of spaghetti. I ended up eating it because I knew I needed to eat, since I skipped lunch. :( It was still hot (coming from the west side of town, to the east), but I've had better. I guess I'll have to tough it out and finish the order over the next two days. I hate wasting food, especially at that price.  The portion size was pretty generous. It came with a big portion of salad, and a bag of some bread. The bread wasn't too great, which could have been due to the time it spent out. (a little hard on the outside, and a tad too chewy on the inside. Not a great combo).   I wonder if the pizza would have been a better choice. But for the take out order of spaghetti with meat sauce, I was not impressed. It lacked great flavour/taste. It tasted generic.   For a small chain, I expected better. Nothing beats home made spaghetti, but when dining out, my favourite ones are from Buca di Beppo and Olive Garden."}
{"text":"I have ordered from Metro for years - ever since they opened the Horizon Ridge store, and have always had great food here, but sadly the last two times the food has been atrociously bad and the service even worse. After calling to explain to the manager that I had received a pizza that was inedible ( the crust was so soggy it disintegrated as I picked up a slice) and that I would like for it to be replaced  he complied by replacing my large pizza with a personal sized one delivered 2 hours later. We had 4 people over for dinner and had to make other arrangements. This is unacceptable, especially in light of being long-time loyal customers. Stuff happens so we decided to give it another try and once again the quality of the food and the service had gone through a radical change from the Metro we have known all these years. Sadly I really don't think the third time will be a charm."}
{"text":"Delicious and greasy just how I LIKE it!!!!!! Seriously it surprised me!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered from this location as the one on the strip had a 2hr wait (or just didn't want to deliver). The antipasto was massive! Great mix of cheeses, meats, and marinated veggies. Also had two pizzas, pretty decently sized, thin crust pizzeria style. Evened it all out with the garlic knots, just the right amount of garlic/butter on them. Order actually came earlier than the expectation and the delivery guy kept the antipasto separate from the hot items. Nice touch. Will order again from these guys!"}
{"text":"This is a decent place, I took out, but would have loved to eat in. This is like artisan pizza..and it's pretty good. Not the cheapest my pizza was like $20 bucks but it is better quality than pizza huts of the world.  I'd give this place a shot if your in town.   -Alex"}
{"text":"We have been going to Metro Pizza for the past 5 years and the pizza is great and the kids love making their own pizzas too."}
{"text":"Yum! Have yet to be dissapointed at metro pizza. Modesto, margherita, and milano are tasty, as well as just ur regular cheese and pepperoni. My favorite has to be the modesto tho. Havent stopped by in a while tho... i should stop by soon. :)"}
{"text":"This is our favorite Metro to go to.  There are prettier new locations, but the decor of this location keeps us coming back.  We affectionately call it the \"ghetto\" Metro.  A run down looking throw back to the 80's.   But the pizza is the best and we've never had any real problems with the staff.  We usually go during 1/2 price time and the quantity of toppings and overall quality are never skimped on.  Same as their full price pizzas.  The are a bit pricey, hence going during 1/2 price, but even when paying full price it is worth the money with the quality ingrediants.  Metro, any location, is the best.  You should not miss out on this!!"}
{"text":"By far the best pizza I'va had in vegas. The marinara sauce is delicious. Good family friendly atmosphere. Good pricing. Terrific food and service. Try the stuffed pizzas! Evertime I have friends or family in from out of town I take them here."}
{"text":"I recently stayed in Vegas and was looking for some good food off the strip because Casino/Strip food is overpriced and/or mediocre. A friend of mine suggested I try this place. It was awesome! They have a friendly staff there. The pizza was really good! I will go there every time I hit Vegas!"}
{"text":"This review is based on their pizza only as this is what i order 99% of the time. Metro Pizza produces a very solid and tasty pizza and for a very reasonable price. Their service and pizza cooking equity times are usually about average but what i remember every visit is the taste of their pizza. Everyone's pizza preferences varys but for me when i order a pizza i ask them to cook it perfectly, not under cooked and not over cooked but right in the middle. I found that this request has been very rewarding.  Also remember, for those people with more flexible eating schedules, from 2:30pm to 4:30pm, Tuesday through Thursday, pizzas are half priced!"}
{"text":"Hey, Slater!  You wanna meet up at The Max after school?  We should totally study for the bio test before we wind up in detention with Belding.  ......oops sorry.  Just getting lost in my \"Saved by the Bell\" daydreams.  It always seems to happen when I go to Metro Pizza.  So if you're still confused, the inside of this place SCREAMS the diner that Zack and the gang would hang out at after school (you know, \"The Max\").  It certainly makes for an interesting dining experience.  1993 decor aside, let's get to the important information: the food.  I have had the garlic fries (yummy), the eggplant parm sub (not so yummy), and plain ol' cheese pizza (good).  One of the lunch specials is $10 and comes with a plain or pepperoni pizza (a little smaller than a medium at most other places) and a big salad.  I always have leftover pizza for dinner, so that's nice.  The bread and salad really aren't anything special when you think about it, but I love both.  The bread tastes like what some little grandma would make on a Sunday afternoon, while the salad is always a large serving of fresh veggies.  I highly recommend their house-made Italian dressing- I don't know what they do to it to make it taste so good, but I would like the recipe, please.  Most days, we get a large pizza that is half Thompson and half Mulberry.  The Thompson is spinach, garlic, and ricotta while the Mulberry is fried eggplant, ricotta, and fresh basil.  The pizza is a thinner crust but still doughy (not crispy) and it is huge.  Two slices and I'm done.  Our pizzas have always been cooked perfectly and there's always a good balance of cheese, sauce, and toppings.  Usually the toppings are tasty, however on our last visit- not so much.  The water wasn't squeezed out enough from the spinach (obviously frozen) and the eggplant was fried to a crisp.   The servers are friendly and usually our water glasses are kept full.  But for some reason everything is always SLOW.  I'm talking you may spend 2 hours here if it's a busy night.  The pizza is good, but prepared to spend some time in the restaurant.  I believe Metro is a Vegas institution that everyone should visit at least once.  I suggest this location in particular, so you can re-live all your bad memories of terrible neon outfits from the early 90's."}
{"text":"I had the sausage pizza and thought it was great. I think the menu described it as a Chicago style pizza. Maybe the sausage is from Chicago, but this is not deep dish. Actually pretty thin. But I definitely liked it and would definitely go back the next time I am in Vegas. I was there too late for it, but they were advertising half off pizza during the late afternoon."}
{"text":"Eat at this restaurant all the time and usually the service is great. The other day I ordered take out and my salad was not the greatest but overall the food is usually fantastic and the service is good. Love the atmosphere of this restaurant and love the pizza!!"}

Before he could finish she curtly said \"No\". He politely finished his sentence, explaining that our 7 year was diabetic and we needed the information to calculate her insulin.  She then said, just as rudely \"still no, do you want to place your drink orders?\" We did stay, but only because we brought people and we felt bad.  The service did not improve and it took a very long time to receive our food even though the restaurant was not busy.  I'm sorry, I don't care how good your food is.  It does not make up for poor customer service."}
{"text":"I ordered a carry out large pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni , Sprite. Over 25 $ + tip , opened the box that was full of oily cheese that wouldn't stay on the dough which was well done actually burnt. I couldn't finish one piece I called back to complain the girl asked what she could do. She says that's what happens when we do pepperoni I told her you already showed me what you did do which was excuses of which I dislike excuses. I told her I will never order there again would be due justice metro pizza  had their first and last impression , icky uckey sloppy pizza ,  I order Marcos and other pizza places which do a fine carry out pizza . Z"}
{"text":"Really like their food...BUT THEIR SERVICE SUCKS!!!!. Been there a few times and always have had a service issue. called twice today and was put on hold each time by ashley for 5 mins. Second time was disconnect. Spoke with jesus the mgr. and got the same excuse given before about being too busy taking care of other customers. I informed them that I was a customer as well but tgat didnt seem to make a difference. Just decided to get a pizza from BJ s . If it is half as good it will be worth it . Maybe if if I had said we were ordering 5 large pizzas and several desserts it might have made a difference."}
{"text":"I got delivered gotham pizza and ceaser salad they both were so good and I didnt wait too long for my food. Delivery man was very nice too but he did not carry extra sauce since we didnt mention at the first place which was understandable."}
{"text":"My kids love it here because of the dough they get to play with at the table. Great salads and pizzas. The food prices seem a little bit high, but their beer prices make up the difference with 5.00 24 oz domestics. The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is the service is usually a bit slow."}
{"text":"For my money, still the best in town.  Went to them in high school when they were at Sandhill and Flamingo and go to Decatur and Flamingo now that we live on the west side (and also Trop and Maryland if we're out).  Good enough that we pay the extra delivery charge to get it delivered."}
{"text":"We've been going here since it opened, and with each visit things have gotten progressively worse.  First I have to say that TISH is the BEST!!!  She is a wonderful waitress, attentive, funny, helpful - she certainly should be working somewhere else.  She is way over qualified and too professional for this place!  We liked the pizza when it first opened and therefore kept coming back.  But in the last 3 months it has just gotten to be terrible... portion sizes have gotten smaller... food quality is virtually non-existent and the only thing consistent about this place is that it is inconsistent.  Our bread came to the table raw inside... all 4 loaves... I mean, come on people, this is a pizza place with a bakery next door.  You should know how to cook bread!  French fries were soggy. And the pizza - barely edible.  Now, I have to tell you, we order NY thin crust cheese pizza.  If you load your pizza with a bunch of meat/veggies, you probably won't notice a change.  But we did... sauce was tasteless!  I had to request garlic and oregano and still it tasted like dishwater on bread.  The response?  Well, it must be a new cook. Hmmm.... bad answer from the kitchen.  Manager never bothered to come over to the table to address the issue.  Next day - two people in our party had the gurgly stomachs, etc....  It's too bad - the place has a nice feel - well decorated and good location.  But that doesn't make up at all for the lousy food and lack of concern from the owner/manager.  Restaurants don't run themselves....    Fortunately they aren't the only place in town - in a city this big with the vast array of options the owners should care.  But it's evident they do not.  Just like a former reviewer said, they change things and do not notify people and they just don't care about their customers.  Spend your $$ someplace else."}
{"text":"Worst service ever!! Called for a delivery, I was on hold for 10 minutes, called back, put on hold  another 8 minutes, called a 3rd time to speak to manager was on hold another 10 minutes!!!!  I will never call this place again!!!!!! If I could give no stars I would!!!!!!! Perhaps they need to learn how to manage their establishment!!!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza is phenomenal. I used to live in chi town and this is the closest thing I've found to home. Their ranch and house dressings are killer. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because every time I go for pick up they staff is not very friendly."}
{"text":"Its a family friendly pizza parlor. Always has a gimmick on their calendar for a discount. Nuke/atomic fries are a las vegas institution at metro pizza. With the plethora of pizza to go places nearby, this place makes it fun to dine out and eat pizza with your friends or family."}
{"text":"Finally, someone got smart and decided to open a Metro Pizza in Henderson! I no longer have to fight UNLV students on their lunch break for a nice booth and some pizza. The new location I believe is better than the original. It has a full bar area, a party room, and regular dining room. There is also a separate wing for pick up orders so you don't have to trek all the way through the restaurant in your pj's and slippers. The pizza is great on its own, but the nuclear fries are so good, I would go just for those. They are spiced and have a bit of a kick, and make the perfect addition for a pie. They also have a variety of beers on tap, which also obviously pairs well with pizza. Avoid the weekend evenings though because the hype around the new restaurant is still prevalent. It's packed. Lunch is the best time, and things stay pretty quiet.   Recommended pizza: The margherita.  Recommended beer: Hefeweizen with some lemons."}
{"text":"Our experience was not great with the food. We didn't like the garlic knots or our pizza. We ordered the Gotham pizza and it was undercooked and the topping didn't taste good either."}
{"text":"Very bad service, waiter came to our table like twice and did not get any bread unlike other tables. Very confusing service but food is good but would recommend going to Napplis instead."}
{"text":"I am from New York & I have tasted some amazing pizza! This pizza here is very good. Not compared to New York but it is better than most pizza's in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Food was okay service okay. Personally think the toppings were too heavy causing the pizza bottom to be a tad saggy."}
{"text":"The crew here is very friendly and gives anything you need, very attentive! The pizza is too awesome, they are not the typical papa johns or domino's type of pizza, the ingredients are better quality even the crust is a lot bigger for the price that you will have to pay. Go there Monday to thursday 2:30 to 4:30 to get a half off pizza! It's the best treat ever!"}
{"text":"I lived in Vegas for about 7 years, and tears well up sometimes when I think of this place.  I miss real pizza so much!  They make the best thin crust Margherita pizza by pretty much flash cooking it in their giant coal-brick oven.  Although this is hands-down my favorite dish, everything they make is awesome.  I can't believe I made it so long in Vegas eating their food and can still fit through the doorways."}
{"text":"Try the San Gennaro. So delish!   If you are ordering out, make sure you ask if they have any specials running, because you won't be told about them otherwise.  One of the best pizza places in town!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza joints in town. Been going here since they let you draw on the tables with crayons. The pizza is usually amazing, but the pizza varies depending on who cooks it. Love the bread that comes with dinner too.  Overall very good."}
{"text":"sky pointe location has the worse hostess ever !!!!!! from the seating to the disgusting ass attitudes . i dont recommend anyone going there unless you feel like being treated like shit"}
{"text":"This is our favorite place to get awesome pizza, slots and Mr Pibb. Metro Pizza has never disappointed us. The remodeling at Ellis Island looks amazing. Thanks for the last 7 years we have been going!"}
{"text":"I finally had a chance to visit this place... Not sure what took me so long either as I drive by it numerous times on a daily basis.  This weekend I decided to try it out for the first time and took the family out for pizza.  The waitress that served us was great! Friendly attitude, quick service, very knowledgable of the menu, and was even great with my kids (we all know they are the true test)  We went with her recommendation and had a Stuffed Pizza.  The pizza was amazing!  I have nothing negative to say, all my expectations were exceeded!  We will definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Slow service for a to go pizza.  Then the girl at the counter has a bad attitude with Raiders jersey. The pizza was good though."}
{"text":"We ordered take-out from this place for a night in.    The menu is so extensive it took us ages to figure out what to order!  But that's actually a good problem to have.  We only got to glimpse the inside of the restaurant while we waited a few moments to get our order and pay.  It was large and spacious, kid friendly, and full of warm-colored Italian decor.  It looked very welcoming and I wouldn't mind if we ended up eating here some time.    The food was pretty tasty.  I split the Tuscan salad and the Milano pizza with a friend.  The pizza was pretty good, although I imagine it would taste better if it was straight out of the oven and not reheated by the time we got home.  The salad was also good.  I'm knocking off a few stars because they messed up quite a few parts of our order.  We ordered bleu cheese on the side for a number of our salads and they didn't get that right.  And I remember my friend stating that twice while ordering on the phone.  They also handed me a box covered in what I will assume was chocolate frosting.  Just a bit weird.  Then they gave me the weirdest looks when I asked for a napkin to wipe it off my hands.    They also have gelato here and we got the stracciatella to go.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"This particular store wasn't news as food as the original one. But the ppl on the phone were just as nice as always. I made the mistake of not making sure that the pizza I ordered was the thick crust however, it was just the same quality as it ever was. It was pretty quick and hot. The cheesecake was super awesome as well! Great place! I'll be going to them more often."}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza I've ever had.  Found this place while in Las Vegas after searching yelp for the best pizza in las vegas."}
{"text":"Good, but overrated with terrible service. Comparable to frozen pizza."}
{"text":"It blows my mind that this specific metro doesn't have better reviews, and I don't understand why people are complaining about the price of pizza and delivery. Like if you want cheap pizza go to dominos. It's 2015. Gas isn't .50/ gallon now. Anyways.   As far as service Nate is incredible everyone else is mediocre. He's friendly and efficient. It's the only pizza in town there consistent and good. Their house Italian dressing is great. The garlic knots are good most of the time, sometimes they're a little undercooked. I love love love Mac n cheese and I was upset when max brenner at the forum closed because that was my favorite Mac and cheese. But metros Mac and cheese is incredible!  I have had bad experiences here, but only because of the service. If you stick with Nate you'll never have an issues!"}
{"text":"This location is just okay, areas kinda ghetto but it's cool for a quick lunch after school."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype.  Very average pizza and very average service.  I've heard people heap superlatives on their pizza...i just don't see it."}
{"text":"wow really, i read the reviews and was expecting at least a good pizza, and this was one of the worst pizzas i have had, the sauce is way to sweet with the taste of vinegar, and very moist. I am a fan of the thin crust NY style pizza and this is not at all that type of pizza. the atmosphere is nice inside, although very crowded. better off getting pizza hut, doh.."}
{"text":"A friend of mine recommended this place to me, so I decided to give it a try.  I love NY style pizza, so I was happy to see that they offered it.  The sauce was pretty good, the only drawback is the greasiness of the pizza.  It was so greasy that it soaked through the crust.  If you like pizza like that, i would recommend this place.  If you like a less greasier pizza, i would avoid this place."}
{"text":"Good pizza but only if you eat in. Twice i have ordered delivery that was over an hour and a half wait and we live only a few streets away. The second time I had to call to find out what happened and an employee claimed i didn't give my area code even though it was repeated back to me. They didn't bother to look up the info in the computer either even though we were a previous customer. They then sent a two hour old pizza with wrong toppings(along with a pissed off delivery woman) instead of firing a fresh one. Both times we ordered delivery and once ordering pick-up the pizza was cold. I refuse to give them anymore business with such high prices and bad customer service."}
{"text":"i was in the marines, and have visited Chicago, NY, and other places.  I can tell you in LAS VEGAS, this is the BEST NY  pizza slice you will find, and in my opinion, the best overall pizza.  Grimaldi's is 2nd for ny slice.  If you are looking for Chicago style, look elsewhere"}
{"text":"Adequate pizza in a land of pizza philistines.  I'm from Chicago originally and I'm an unapologetic pizza snob. Chicago pizza is the best- you lose- get over it.  That said, I've eaten at Metro Pizza with friends a few times and I can say if you can't get real Chicago style pizza, the Metro pie will do in a pinch.  I get it with pepperoni on the thicker \"Metro\" crust and tell them to leave it in a few minutes extra. I like my cheese browned a bit on top.  It's pretty generic or \"Sbarro-esque\" as another reviewer said (love that description by the way) but it's still head and shoulders above the crap they sling out of pizza hut and dominoes- or the king of craptastic pizzas- Little Caesars.  Also, we've always had great waitress service there which is amazing compared to the usual level of service I've come to expect in Vegas.  3 stars for an adequate pie and above average service."}
{"text":"Metro is OK. They have good Pizza's. I'm personally all about the Foundation (Crust) so that why I give them 3 stars. If you can't eat the crust by itself, its not Great Pizza. Just OK."}
{"text":"In town for a convention and planning to watch the Blackhawks game from my hotel room so decided to look for some Chicago style pizza. I am from Chicago and enjoy Gino's for deep dish and Giordano's for stuffed.   In my opinion, this is not Chicago style pizza, but it was quite good. I think what threw me was the sauce on the side. I ordered the South Side which is three types of cheese. There is no sauce on the pizza. It comes separately and you get a choice of meat or tomato sauce.   I debated giving them five stars because the pizza was good, I guess I just haven't totally embraced the sauce on the side concept. I would recommend you give them a try as it is interesting and most importantly tasty.   I also appreciate that the gal on the phone was friendly as was the delivery driver and they were actually a few minutes early for their delivery time."}
{"text":"This is for the Metro Pizza at the Las Vegas Terminal 3 airport - tried their breakfast platter of scrambled eggs, potatoes,  crossaint, & bacon- terrible.  Didn't eat it except for bacon. Croissant was  soft like cotton, egg was chopped hard and dry, tatoes tasted like it was fried in old and reused oil."}
{"text":"Once a top notch pizza establishment, it has had a rapid decent. I would now advise avoiding this pizza joint. I suspect a new ownership after years of the same owners. AVOID!"}
{"text":"Placed a To Go order tonight of a large pepperoni pizza w half sausage, garlic fries, and a chopped chicken salad. I ordered the chopped chicken salad w no feta and extra chicken. When we got our order home my salad did not have extra chicken. I called in and spoke to a manager. He took my order again and had another salad delivered within 20 min. He was very apologetic and didn't hesitate to send the corrected salad. Awesome customer service!! We were very appreciative. Thanks Henderson Metro Pizza!! We will def be back!"}
{"text":"Defintely as good as it gets for pizza! I dont know how anyone can rate this place less than 5 stars because I've been here plenty of times and I've never left anything but satisfied. Most recently tried the Thompson Street Pizza and added pepperoni (because who doesn't need pepperoni on their pizza!) and I cant even describe how good it was! I usually try to avoid stuffing myself full, but for this pizza, it was worth it!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing from start to finish.  They are very accommodating to families and specifically the children.  I was very impressed with the cleanliness of the place, the layout and interesting things for customers to see.  The teamwork was very evident as servers from other stations are constantly helping each other and paying attention to the whole restaurant instead of just their tables.  The quality of the food is very high and even though the owners were not personally walking around or even at the restaurant the customer feels like they are right there because of the family feel and the importance they have showed to detail in the overall organization of the restaurant.  It feels like one of \"those\" neighborhood secret pizza parlors but in fact they are a local chain with numerous locations.  Thank you Metro Pizza!  We will be back frequently.  I ordered an amazing salad with fresh pears and candied nuts in it.... Amazing  My Son ordered the kids pizza with bacon... he can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is a pillar of the Las Vegas food scene!    Featuring massive portions, this is definitely a group/family dining spot.  Especially the Stuffed Pizzas!    For dine-in, this ambiance is perfect for a casual lunch or dinner experience.  The the service is professional and courteous.    They use only the highest quality ingredients in their wide array of pizza options.    The one recommendation I would make would be to go with the \"Metro\" (thick crust) style.  Otherwise, just put your trust in your server and listen to their suggestions.    P.S.  we even ordered from them at school once and they delivered to the UNLV Library, it was awesome!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here 3 times.  2 of which we had the most awful waitress ever.  The waitress with the long dark hair pulled up high is super rude! She has made 2 dining experiences uncomfortable.  Don't forget to ask for peppers and cheese and ranch or sugar for iced tea because they are not on the table. We were told management pulled them off to save money.  This may not be a big deal if you have a waitress that pays attention and isn't rude.  Avoid the dinner salads if you like fresh salad, order it if you love iceberg."}
{"text":"I went to dinner with my friend tonight.   Worst service ever.  Our server was eating and never washed his hands and served it's our drinks apps and dinner. We were there for about 1/2 hr none of the tables were cleaned after customers left. Both our server and busser were on the ass. After I spoke with I think was a manager I said to the server to wash his hands that maybe next time it might be health department. He then said here take your tip back.   Maybe someone should tell him the meaning of Tip= to insure prompt service!! Dumb ass!! No star for this place yelp is making me give you one so I can get out of this page"}
{"text":"The delivery driver ripped us off. Was quoted $49 for pizza to our hotel. When he came to deliver told me there was a $10 delivery charge (which I knew about) so we gave him the extra ten plus a tip. I asked for a receipt and when got back to room saw that the original $49 already included the $10 delivery fee and he just pocketed the extra $10, probably not thinking people at Vegas hotels actually check their receipts or even ask for them.  Beware and make sure you check your receipt."}
{"text":"The location at the Las Vegas airport by the D gates was horrible. A member in my group was treated very poorly by Robin, an employee. Her manners were poor as she refused to make eye contact, quoted 20 min for anything except vegi supreme. Wgen U went back 5 MINUTES LATER there was both cheese and pepperoni. She continued to be rude to me as well."}
{"text":"We are from Michigan, so we only get to the Vegas area once a year.  The first place we go is Metro Pizza.  This place is awesome. We got an added treat this year. We punched in the place on our Yelp app, and got a coupon for a free non-alcoholic drink! Then we arrived at 3:30 p.m and they told us that if we get there before 4:00 our pizza is half priced. And then the margarita pizza is our favorite.  We like thin crust pizza, and this place has the best.  Our friends like thick crust, and they rave about their pizza.   We can't wait till we go back."}
{"text":"I frequent this place with my fiancé. We love the food, from the fresh salad to the pizza, and everything else we have tried is always great.   We always ask for Nate to be out server, because he by far the best on their staff. We have other servers and the food is always good, but it's always better when you have great service. So if you're looking to eat here I would recommend Nate for a server."}

{"text":"My family and I have eaten here a few times. Normally, we really enjoy eating here. Tonight was absolutely ridiculous. Our server forgot to bring our order of garlic knots. He did ask if we still wanted them, but our pizza had already came, so we declined. Our pizza was on the thin side, and all the toppings were falling off, due to the crust type. We specifically asked for the metro style pizza w/Gotham toppings. When we asked the server about the crust. He admitted he put in the wrong style of crust. He never asked if we would like another pizza, blamed it on him being stressed and have only been working at the establishment 6 months. The manager never came over to apologize, and only took $5 off our bill. Overall it was a very disappointing experience. My husband & I only ate one piece of pizza apiece. The server boxed it up, and I'm sure it will stay in the refrigerator until it's time to throw it out. On a high note the spinach & artichoke dip is amazing. I will be calling tomorrow & asking to speak to a manager."}
{"text":"OK. Let me just put it this way! This is not the best pizza I have ever eaten. but it comes in a close second.  When my wife and I walked in I was impressed right from the start. The restaurant is a nice large size. They have magnum bottles of wine placed throughout the restaurant. And in the menu under the history of Metro Pizza page they pay homage to the first pizzeria in the United States; Lombardi's in New York's Little Italy. Metro has become my favorite pizza place in Las Vegas.  On their back wall they have a map of the United States. It takes up the whole wall. Pinned to it at different locations are small photos with the names of Pizzerias in the different cities that they believe are the best. I have to go back to write them down sometime.  We were seated almost after stepping through the door. We were greeted at our table by a wonderful server who was friendly and outgoing and made us feel like we were the only patrons there. Bread and drinks came to our table very quickly. The bread was still hot from the oven. It had a really nice yeasty flavor to it and the real butter melted into it quickly. If you know someone who does not like pizza, if there is such a person, you could take them just for the bread. It is that good!  They have two sizes of Pizza. A small and a large. We got the large. I thought when ordering it, it would just be a bit to big and we would have a slice or two left over. I was very wrong. We were only able to finish half the pizza. So one large feeds four. We got one half the pizza as Hawaiian and the other half Gotham. Each were wonderful. The toppings were all fresh and crunchy. The pepperoni tasted a bit different from other pepperonis, but still very tasty and not as strong as most. If you want to know what sausage is supposed to taste like, this is the place. It was very flavorful like you would expect it to be. The veggies were tasty and crisp and the ham on the Hawaiian was plentiful and flavorful. One thing very interesting about the bacon bits on the Hawaiian; they were bacon fried up and cut into bits. So they were very moist and full of flavor and most of all they were not hard and overly crunchy. The sauce was tomato-ie like sauce should be. I expected the sauce to have a lot of spices in it overpowering it's flavor. I could not tell any spices in it at all. I'm sure they were there, but they were well incorporated into it.  Pizza is and always has been my favorite food. So I know I will be going back again and again to get this wonderful pizza."}
{"text":"Doreen is wonderful, she knows how to make you feel welcomed and like family. Plus the food is great. The beard you get is so yummy I  could eat just that as my meal."}
{"text":"I love metro pizza! Been here and other locations many times and have not been disappointed yet. Always on point and great service."}
{"text":"I like the pizza here, but its a bit pricey for what your getting. I'd say it ranks 2nd on my list of pizza places here in town. However, I just can't afford to eat here like I used to."}
{"text":"Metro pizza is just delicious. Although I may be a bit biased because this is the place my husband took me in our first date. The food is always guaranteed delicious with tons to take home and the service today at this new location was absolutely perfect. Just enough attention but not annoying or overly at tentative. Our server was fantastic and we really enjoyed dinner here."}
{"text":"Super disappointed in our experience here.  Walked in at about 1:30pm for lunch on Feb 15th and we were seated in the back where it was dark and cold.  We asked to be moved only to be taken upstairs to another lonely terrible table.  The hostess disappeared as soon as she could without asking if this was a better table.  When people go out to eat its about the experience along with the food.  To sit us in Siberia with no ambience is not OK.  We saw a table in a great spot that was waiting to be cleared she could have offered or she could have let us know the approximate wait time on a better table.  We walked out and won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Wow...these guys really built one classy pizza joint out in the northwest boonies! And I mean CLASSY.  Beautiful free-standing building.  Inside spacious, bright, with large tables and comfortable booths. A large, inviting looking bar took up most of one wall, and the open tile kitchen with the visible ovens is another touch of class.    To call this place a pizza joint isn't really accurate because they have a fairly extensive menu.  But of couse, it all comes down to the food and service.  The day I was there, both were very good. My wife and I ordered a house salad and large saugage pizza. I'm a pizza minimalist...to me a pizza is New York style, topped with sausage or pepperoni, plenty of cheese and sauce, and thin and chewey crust.  And that's what I got.  Its almost as good as the pizza in Metro's Decateur location, though it was slightly sweeter and less spicy.  I'm sure it'll all even out in time.  Service was fine even though our server announced he was \"In training\". All in all, a delightful dining experience and I'm sure they'll be seeing more of me."}
{"text":"We got a pizza that was half Gotham and half something else... I think it's called spring street. We were impressed. For a large pizza it cost about 25 dollars but it was worth it"}
{"text":"We enjoyed the pizza a great deal. Thin crust and just the right amount of cheese. The service was great, always attentive. Big party going on here and we still felt very well taken care of. Large dinner salad was perfect for the two of us."}
{"text":"i will never understand, why this place has such raving reviews. i like my pizza either nasty (pizza hut thick crust) or delicious (pizzeria mozza in la) i think metro pizza is somewhere (or nowhere!) in between. we arrived late on a saturday night (around 9.25), but we were told that it was open till eleven. we were one of three tables but the service took forever. the server was rude and after i pointed it out he was arrogant for the rest of the night. i ordered a glass of sparkling wine and he came back after five minutes saying theyre out. they did not have the beer my boyfriend ordered either, but he did inform us about that right away.  i did not know they served bread, and wouldnt know if a food runner did not ask us if we wanted some. some minutes later i asked the waiter about it and he said theyre still baking it. you can only understand my surprise when the bread came out burned and inedible. good think it probably wasnt good to begin with, or i would have been even more mad. i ordered a margharita pizza (safe choice, because i was already pissed) and it was barely average. it sucks they sat us as such a small table, because by the time mine and my boyfriends pizza arrived, we had no room for plates to share.  moreover, the prices are a little outrageous.. you can go to Settebello's in the district and enjoy a delicious pizza with authentic ingredients, in a better atmosphere. overall, i was looking forward to try this place but it was a big bust wish i remembered the name of the server, or i would say to NEVER have him.. i gotta start writing stuff down don't go there!"}
{"text":"Today had to  try the meatball sliders, great idea. Meatballs , provolone in a garlic knot roll sprinkled with Parmesan .     This is not your everyday boring slider, someone actually thought about it. The slider was very good, tender meatball covered in cheese  in a buttery garlic roll sprinkled with parm cheese and served with romano fries We also had the fried calamari it had a light crispy batter with a spicy marinara. My only gripe with calamari  ,lemon was sliced , if lemon is to be squeezed , wedges more appropriate . We also had the Steinbrenner calzone stuffed w/ eggplant parm , ricotta and marinara. Beautiful golden crust  , crisp and chewy.        Very tasty combination of flavors Service was solid ."}
{"text":"Since we moved from East coast always was looking for one like NY. Guess what Metro is the place to go.  Me, my kids my hubby we love it.. yes it is little pricey but you get what you pay for.."}
{"text":"Metro Pizza is our go-to pizza place in Las Vegas.  It's consistently delicious and easy to get in and out when we place our to-go order. This location is usually super-busy, so to eat-in we'll travel down Eastern to their Tropicana location as it's usually less crowded (and a less desirable neighborhood, but I digress..) Their bread alone is worth the wait for a table, however.   We love their garlic knots, Tuscan Chicken Salad (you have to add the chicken), and Modesto or Sunspot pizzas. We'll order a combination of the three and never have been disappointed."}
{"text":"They get two stars because the food was good. If it wasn't for the food, they would get negative stars. Service was beyond horrible. There was one person who saved the day and he was the host!!! The man with spiked salt and pepper hair was RUDE!!!"}
{"text":"Good pizza if you like Chicago style pizza.  Sometimes I like this kind of pizza for dinner.  Give it a try,  best Chicago pizza I've found here.  Give this place a try for lunch or dinner."}

{"text":"The food here is always great.. My review today is regarding the delivery. I feel a little bad posting this.. But at the same time.. Standards have to be in place. The delivery driver who brought me my order reeked of urine... Not animal ... It was so unappetizing. I could not even eat what I ordered a complete waste of $30!!!  For a person to approach my door in that state with food... How can this be? He is in the restaurant picking up the food to deliver.. Do the other employees and owners not smell this? If i can smell it while he is outside my door... how can no one there not smell this? How could standards be so low?... I'm so turned off by this.."}
{"text":"The Gotham pizza and the stuffed cheese pizzas are what we order at Metro.  The plain bread and butter they bring to the table is bland, don't waste the stomach space or calories.  The prices are a little high so we don't go here or order it often, but when we do, the quality is good."}
{"text":"I've been to this Metro Pizza location twice.  The first time was great.  The service was prompt and friendly.  I had the Old New Yorker and it was excellent.  The crust was thin and crisp and the toppings were perfect.  Although this location isn't the closest to us, our experience was so good, that my wife and I decided to drive over to this location about a month later.  The second vist was poor.  From the point where I started noting the time, it took over 30 min. to get our individual size pizzas.  Our waiter was unbelievable.  Some of his friends came in and he chose to sit with them which was really great for him because the conversation took his mind off our hunger.  Eventually the food came.  The crust on my pizza was perfect, however, the toppings were a slimey mess with uncooked green peppers and onions.  When we were done eating, I finally grew weary of waiting and had to go over to where my waiter was seated with his dinner companions and request my bill.  I'm averaging a 4 star visit and a 1 star visit and adding 0.5 (i.e. the benefit of the doubt) to get 3 stars.  BUT, next time I'll go to another location."}
{"text":"I went to this location it was 20 minutes before they close they close at 11:00 I was told they were only doing carry out, if your open to 11:00 it should be dine in as well. This is poor customer service."}
{"text":"Drove around Vegas looking for a pizza place and just happened to pull in here. EVEN IF THIS IS OIT OF YOUR WAY, GO!!!!!!! The best pizza I have ever had! Lots of regular customers here, definitely a good sign."}
{"text":"We are regular customers at this Metro location and have been going here for years. We love the service, no complaints there!! We dined there yesterday, 6/10/2014.  Immediately upon entering the restaurant, the ghastly odor of sewage gas was apparent. We wanted to leave and headed out the door, only to see our fav server have our pitcher of beer ready and waiting, so we held it in and sat down. This is not the first time this sewage odor has occurred and they simply need to fix it, once and for all or close their doors until it is fixed.  I have sent them emails about this but sadly, no response. It is truly unthinkable and the health department should be alerted! Also, the quality of their cheese and crust has gone downhill considerably lately. There is no stretch to the cheese and it appears to be of a cheap and watered down variety....alas! more profit for them! So very disappointed in the overall quality of this once stellar pizza spot. Also, due to one of the managers ( no longer there) recommendations, they have done away with Bud Light on draft, offering instead, regular Bud. Really? Bud Light continues to be the number one selling beer in the world and does go well with pizza! We've kindly asked them to bring it back, but no dice! And although they offer Coors Light as a substitute, they are almost always out of it since most people today do prefer light beers. So disappointed, all around, and we will not be back unless we hear things have drastically improved."}
{"text":"I have been eating at Metro Pizza for decades. I no longer live in Vegas but I had the chance to dine there recently. This is in my top five all-time pizza restaurants. The owners, Sam Facchini and John Arena have a long history making pizza. If you have a chance read their history http://metropizza.com/founders/about-us. They are both involved in the restaurant community, locally and nationally. It is not uncommon to see them working in their restaurants. My favorite pizza is the Triple Play, a thin crust pie, cut in squares, loaded with sausage. The sausage is the best I have had on a pizza -- ever. The Triple Play offers the perfect balance of chewy and crunchy crust, high quality cheese and sauce, and amazing sausage. I have ordered other items on the menu, but this is the best. Another must try is their Italian salad dressing. It's a special recipe that has a slight red tint to it. It is excellent on their salads, but also for dipping your pizza crust. It used to be served in a bottle, but this last visit it now looks like it is unfortunately served in plastic cups. They have a reasonably-priced wine list. If you have young children, ask for some pizza dough for them to play with."}
{"text":"Came here during happy hour and the service was horrible .  They were all chit chatting and no one bothered to help us or take our order for awhile . It was slow and like no one cared .  The pizza was ok at best .  I will not be back."}
{"text":"well, after flying to las vegas to spend the day at a web usability conference, only to go back to my room to find out (via email) the boy i'd been seeing no longer wanted to see me, all i wanted to do was order pizza and watch Law & Order until i fell asleep.  i google mapped pizza places that delivered to my hotel, and Metro Pizza came up. within 45 minutes of ordering, a southern-accented delivery gentleman had called to tell me he was waiting at the front desk with my pizza and garlic bread.  to my surprise, he'd also brought me a complementary \"special brew from the local brewery\" -- root beer! that was a nice touch. also, the garlic bread (knots of dough with garlic topping) was TDF (to die for). pizza was pretty good, just the thing to cure a broken heart.  service + convenience + price + quality food = 5 stars."}
{"text":"The pizza is always cooked perfectly, the staff is as friendly as it gets, and it gives people a feel-good vibe. A definite must-eat in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"I came here cause I was starving and I had to wait an hour for a table at the Ellis Island Restaurant. I saw this Pizza joint and thought \"PERFECT appetizer\". I was lucky enough to get a nice fresh slice of pepperoni. It was sooooo good, exactly what you want when you think of a New York style slice of pizza, plus it was very CHEAP. I loved it and I will be back."}
{"text":"After not having a good experience at Metro Pizza John Arena contacted me right away to apologize and make things right. He treated us to dinner and everyone at Metro treated us very nicely and the food was delicious. I have never experienced such great customer service from an owner before. John thank you for caring about your customers."}
{"text":"Rarely do I write a review and unfortunately this place pushed me over the edge. I fondly remembered enjoying this pizza while at a friends house that lived near by, so I decided to order with a couple of friends.  If the cardboard box had cheese on it I'm sure this would have tasted better. The dough was flour and water. I went so far as to call back and complain (something I've very rarely ever done).  They were kind enough to send a new pizza. I was looking forward to what turned out to be warm moist cardboard.  Sorry guys, good service, bad food. Stay away"}
{"text":"Ever since Aurelio's closed I was in search of a new favorite pizza place and I was so happy I found Metro Pizza at first! They are absolutely delicious and one of the best delivery pizza places.  However...   I've only had one problem with Metro, and that was when a girl who took my order did not make note that it was delivery, and after 1 1/2 hours of waiting, I called back to see what was taking so long because usually it only takes 45 minutes. When I called back she was very rude and did not believe she was wrong at all, and when I asked to speak to the manager she deflected. When I spoke with the manager they offered to remake the pizza but still charge me the insane delivery price! He was not helpful at all, and one of the worst managements I've talked to. I informed him that although I personally think I should get a fresh pizza AND free delivery ($10 fee) he got aggressive. I accepted my situation and waited for my fresh pizza. When it was FINALLY delivered 2 1/2 hours since my original phone call, it was not fresh at all and tasted like cardboard.    Aside from the rude manager and employee, the pizzas are very delicious! But fees and pizzas are waaaay too overpriced."}
{"text":"Pretty much the standard for pizza in Las Vegas.."}
{"text":"Great service, super tasty bread, GREAT PIZZA, and all pizza is not created equal. I would recommend to anyone!"}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite pizza place on the hill but with a dirty counter bar n a 3 topping $30 pizza there are many other choices. No coupons for locals n bad attitudes for all."}
{"text":"We have been using this Metro since it opened and have seen a steady decline in food quality.  Today the dough was chewy, the sauce was thin with the result of a water drenched middle ; the peppers were uncooked and the spices were non existent.  VERY DISAPPOINTING on a day when we were watching the nfl playoffs.  We complained by phone to the manager who was only interested in us coming in to get our refund which defeats the purpose of home delivery.   NEVER AGAIN!  They've lost us."}
{"text":"It pains me to have to rate Metro a 2. I absolutely love the food at metro. Great pizza, wings, salads, and gelato. The HUGE issue I have with them is the take out service.   The last few times I have ordered take out my experience has been atrocious from start to finish.   First, when I call, I'm put on hold for EXTENDED periods of time (last order was 5 mins 37 seconds). When someone actually comes back to the line I can order me food. I order the same thing every time. Large cheese and pepperoni pizza, wings medium extra crispy, large dinner salad with house dressing (which is amazing dressing), and occasionally an order of garlic knots. The order time is usually 25-45 mins, depending on how busy they are.   Now on to pick up, where another huge issue lies. When I get to the counter to give my name, the employee will tell me to wait while they take 3 more phone orders. I can usually see my order waiting for me. It takes me 10 minutes to actually get my food handed to me. All while there are at least 3 other employees standing around doing nothing. It's ridiculous. This happens ALL THE TIME.   It's a shame bc we love the food, but the service it terrible. Even after I fill out my credit card receipt and include a tip. I live closer to a Rosatis's but choose to come here instead bc the food is better. I'm not sure the terrible pick up service is worth the drive anymore.   *i honestly don't mind the service to dine in. It's the pick up that's AWFUL.*"}
{"text":"Staff friendly and welcoming, offers dine in or carry out or, bonus, delivery. Menu offers selection of pizza, salads, apps and deserts that range from basic to complex. Diners even have the option to get two pizzas in one pie (we for half Modesto and half sun spot, it was delicious combo). Serve beer and wine. Servers were friendly, some seem to have regular customers. Our server was a little forgetful though (we had to ask for water twice and the server forgot to get my husband's adult beverage/wine choice so we had to get her attention to place the drink order). Our Caesar salad was perfectly dressed and included lots of fresh parmesan cheese, croutons and 4wedges of garlic bread (yum). The pizza had wholesome and flavorful ingredients and the crust was perfectly crunchy. Big slices so the 16\" pie could easily satisfy 3-4 people. The two of us could only eat 4 of the 8 gigantic slices. Good experience over all. If I lived in Henderson, NV I would dine there again!"}
{"text":"Our go to pizza place in Henderson.  Good pizza, good salads, excellent service. We love Cindy!"}
{"text":"The food tastes pretty good. The value is the problem. I expect $35 for a large pizza to be able to feed quite a few people. It doesn't stretch very far for the cost. I would suggest finding coupons or some form of discount to make this worth it."}
{"text":"We had a party there for my daughter's birthday. The pizza was undercooked and doughy. We sent it back to be recooked. It wasn't any better. The pasta was bland and not worth the money. I had booked the party through the catering manager.  The manager never came over to see how the refired food was or how our party was going. I have been in the restaurant business for over 25 years. As a manager I always touched every table to make sure things were good and made a point of checking back several times on tables that had problems. The manager never checked to see how things were nor did the catering manager check back to see how things were. I guess spending $200 at a pizza place doesn't rate a call or followup. I will never go back. We tried to fix the pizza at home and we couldn't get the dough cooked. The server was great and tried to flux the problem, but the management, kitchen and catering staff failed. I will never recommend metro pizza and have told my friends who are also in the business about my experience and they won't go either. I like little small places but not this one. Way over priced  and the food was horrible. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!! We should have gone to Rosati's, its much better."}
{"text":"So....they changed their prices. One star because the girl at the counter was sweet. I used to get the grilled chicken pasta for 9.00 and now it's 15.00! I can't afford to go back. I think loyalty supercedes trying to make an extra buck. Be loyal to your customers and they will return. I would have been sympathetic to a dollar more, but that's too high a jump. The pasta is good, but not Olive Garden in California  great. I'll never understand why food tastes better in Cali."}
{"text":"Second Best Pizza in Vegas. I've tried least 20 different ones. I won't comment on the boring ones just 3.  0 Stars for speed and phone order ease 1 Star for Big Cheesy Goodness 1 Star for Price 1 Star for Large Family Style Tables and Atmosphere 1 Star for Cleanliness"}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas. They typically have a special from 2:30 to 4:30 p.m. everyday half price Pizza when you eat inside. The wait staff is very nice and attentive. The fresh bread that has brought out before your meal is fantastic. The only downside is it is so popular that it can be a little noisy."}
{"text":"We where is Vegas on Vacation and decided to get out of the casino to eat one night. Found this place on Yelp. So after looking at the reviews we decided to try it. There were so many options on the menu that looked good. My daughter almost vapor locked when I told here the was one that combined pizza and pasta!! We where real tempted with the stuffed pizza options, but ended  up choosing the 86th street pizza which is a deep dish. The crust was not a really heavy doughy crust. The pepperoni was spicy and bacon was good. The service was great. My drink was being refilled before I even realized it was half empty. We will go back there next time we are in town."}
{"text":"This is the best Pizza Place in Vegas.    The las Vegas Review Agrees because it has won their Best of las Vegas award for the last 2 years. Yheir are 3 other stores around vegas so check their website for the details.    We walked-in and placed a takeout order, but we could have dined in the restaurant.    We were given a free Soda to drink while we waitted for our Pizzas.    We ordered a Galic Bread starter that came as a small loaf baked with Garlic butter and covered in Mozzarella. Delicious.    Our Pizzas were cooked to perfection in a proper vintage Pizza Oven. Mine was a simple Pepperoni but they were very generous with the toppings and the base was really crisp and light.    My wife had ham mushroon & pineapple and was equally pleased.    before we left they gave us 2 big bags containing dried chillies and Parmesan cheese as optional condiments.    Simply superb food and good service."}
{"text":"Love this place.   Pizza always arrives fast and correct. My kids love it more than any other pizza. The inside is nice and spacious. Can see the whole kitchen and ovens from dining room  The Fra Diavlo is amazing. Spiced tomato sauce with calamari, shrimp, and scallops. Even the plain cheese pizza is a notch above. Crust is usually on the thinner side with slices slices rather large.   Ordered a cannoli to go and they stuffed it right there by some very friendly staff .  Always returning"}
{"text":"They had a few options ready it takes 20 min to make fresh. Garlic knots are heavy on the garlic. Crust  can be doughy at times. Portions are good. Half price pizza 11-430 pm. My friend and I come for the deals and extra garlic knots."}
{"text":"I LOVE Metro Pizza!! So much that I live on the Northwest side of town and would travel to Henderson just to get some of this delicious pie/pizza! Lol Now that we have a Northwest location I went and dined here asap! The pizzas amazing and the nuclear fries are the best!!"}
{"text":"They have awesome pizza ... I thought it was a little pricey service was superb beer is very inexpensive ... All in all very happy n pleased will definitely be going back"}
{"text":"good pizza but only giving 3 stars because they would only accept this check in offer one per table when they should do it per person checking in."}
{"text":"Myself and two other friends went to your location on 1/10/15 at 4001 S Decatur Blvd Unit 39 Las Vegas, NV  89103-5860 United States  We ordered 2 pizzas and a pitcher of beer. While we were waiting for the pizza's to get done we where at the bar. One of he pizza's was not made how it was ordered And it had to be remade.  There was no bartender on duty. And A employee refilled our pitcher that was grate we had appreciated it. We were halfway through the Second pitcher we  a another employee walked up to the bar and accused us of pouring our 2nd pitcher.  Choosing us of stealing it was very disrespectful. We still had a half a pitcher we weren't going anywhere we were watching the football game. We went to the manager to complain about this issue.  He tried to make it better saying that he would take care of the second pitcher. At this point The issue was closed. We then returned to the bar. shortly after the manager reapproached saying he called the cops on us. And created a new conflict. The manager was clearly upset that his staff messed up the first order and was disrespectful.  Instead of excepting the truth. The manager then then shut off the game verbally attacked us And had a formed as they had called the police.   Quite shocking for a manager to respond this way and make a bad situation 100 times worse. He used all kinds of profanity. While he was talking to us. Even though we did nothing wrong I told my friends that we need to go. No more reason for more conflict.  There was no reason to get the cops involved. So we left peacefully with no other conflicts.   This has just been a shocking and horrible experience.   If I could put -5 stars I would!"}
{"text":"Nice place but pizza is not really like an Italian would bake it. Its probably because of the electric oven. They do have plenty of discounts and servers are pleasant."}
{"text":"Okay! Time to settle any queries that any people may have about how to find the best pizza in Las Vegas!  Metro Pizza is FANTASTIC!!!! Disputes are now deemed over!  The service is exceptional every time I go there and the pizzas are no joke. There are daily specials offered everyday for the weirdest things. Good specials too! They give you a great discount if your name is listed on the daily special on each table. How cool is that? After reviewing the list, I found that my name is not there, but that's ok.  If you like garlic and basil on your pizza, there is a specific pizza you must try. Look for it on the menu (the name escapes me!).The garlic and basil is chopped fresh and loaded on the surface of the pizza. The aromas waft through the air and tease your senses as you drool on top of your slice.   If you have any room left in your stomach, try the Meatball sliders. They are to die for!!!  Finally, if you still have room after the meatball sliders, please, please, please order the Cannolis! The filling is made on the premises everyday (according to the owners) and they are stuffed full. I guarantee you can not eat just one! Very delectable and satisfying."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Just found this gem and have to patronize it again. My wife and I decided to go find a new pizza restaurant last Saturday and found it after reading a article somewhere about great pizza in Henderson."}
{"text":"Visited this place for the first time but prolly not the last this past weekend.  Loved the fusion of toppings and cheese.  Wish the cheese was a little bit more plentiful and the toppings cooked a little more especially the veggies. I love the monthly calendar where everyday there is something going on.  May or may not apply to you but still something going on!  The sauce was good and tasted fresh, dough seemed a little older but not stale.  I would like to give it another try cause I know it'll be better.  Just the timing of when I went was not ideal.  I want to try different combos and maybe a salad or sammich but HHAHA yeah right don't believe that for a second!  Ima get a PIZZA!    Service B Friendliness  A- Food B Ambience B+ Price B"}
{"text":"Will seem average to you if you get your normal pepperoni and sausage.  try the specialty pizzas or 3 or more toppings and you'll notice the difference as it begins to stand out.  Crust will not bend, the cheese will stretch, and your stomach will be satisfied. Crunchy crust.  The service was good as well. dude was pretty cool, took pictures of us and everything.  i just can't find em! ha!"}
{"text":"Delicious food. The service is always great. Everything is clean. There is usually a wait because like I said the food is delicious. They usually have specials. Good for small group or large groups"}
{"text":"Mine and my sister and brother in law experience of metro pizza was opposite of the the experience I had with my best friend. First me and my best friend came in first and ate around 7pm we had a calzone and garlic knots and wine service and food great. My sister and brother in law had not eat dinner yet and I told them how good the food was so they asked me to join the so we all came at 915pm ready to eat more good food, the service was good and great food again but this time when we go up to leave several male employees in the bar area where fat shaming us by barking and mooing at us we looked at each other is disbelief and when we looked back they where pointing at us. Bottom line this is disrespectful and we will not be back and I have enjoyed metro pizza for over 30 plus years!"}
{"text":"Best pizza, service was awesome waiter Ray was very knowledgeable.. huge help!! Price was good.  Nice setting and clean.."}
{"text":"Been here a few times.. yummy food! If you garlic you must get the garlc fries! Unfortunately they continue to have sloooowwwwww staff!!"}
{"text":"Took a long time to get two calzones. The food was good though."}
{"text":"We checked out Metro on the first Friday night it was open.  There were four of us.  We ordered on separate checks and that was to blame for the rest of the events.  Our order was nuclear fries, and 2 small pizzas.  Our friend's order was garlic knots and 2 small pizzas.  We ordered at the same time, from the same waitress.   We also ordered another round of drinks with the food.  2 beers and a wine - same beer that had been ordered for the 90 minutes we had already been there.  The beers arrived and were a different color - the waitress said they were what we ordered.  No, they also tasted different so two new one were brought to the table, they were the right color and flavor.  The waitress tells us that she put in our order correct.  Hmmm.  The nuclear fries show up -stick with pizza, not fries.  They were literally frozen fries with some cayenne dried spice sloppily sprinkled on top.  Another order of fries show up, we said we have our, waiting for garlic knots.  Our waitress brings the garlic knots and extra fry order, tells us she put in the order correct, not sure what happened.  Okay, humm.  Our friend's 2 pizzas show up.  We wait...conversation with our waitress after 20 minutes is that our pizzas should be out shortly, not sure what is taking so long because she put our orders in at the same time.  10 more minutes, the manager comes over, our pizzas are going in now, friend's pizzas are now cold because they were waiting for ours.  He was totally professional, took back their pizzas, made fresh ones so all 4 could be served together.  More beer is ordered while we wait.  Just before 10pm the 4 pizzas arrive.  Our waitress asks if everything is okay, and doesn't know what happened because she put in our order correctly.  Enough already!  Still waiting for beer now.    We all taste a slice or two of our pizzas but now it's late, we're tired (we're in our 30s so we can't stay out late like we used to) and we want to go.  Because I was so hungry and didn't get food until so late, it was all a blur and all I can really remember is how our waitress had no idea what was going on because she did everything correct.    Whatever, it is what it is.  Of course we'll go back because we purchased the 2 for 1 gift certificates they had on special last week."}
{"text":"I usually like this place but I placed a delivery order and was told 45min to an hour, ok not bad I guess sept that when my food got here exactly an hour later it tasted like my pizza had been siting out, it's usually hot, it wasn't hot. I got a house salad and it was warm and so was my ranch, yuk. I also ordered a soda and the cup was filled with ice so just a few sips and it was gone, if you're going to get a soda ask for no ice and just get ice from your own kitchen. I called to tell the manager what happened and he said he'd remake my order and I could pick it up....um no! The whole resin I ordered it and had it delivered was so I could avoid going there and I could enjoy my meal at home. But thanks to tonight my son and I had to reheat our pizza in the oven to enjoy it and I will not eat warm ranch, I'm not getting sick. And as far as the soda, thanks for the $2 ice chips."}
{"text":"food is always good service needs some serious review. I went in with a friend... and we were ignored!!!! I used to frequent this facility often.. but the last 2 times have been really piss poor service.  It needs to improve...  I love metro! the one on trop rocks!  every experience has been amazing.. but this one.. .really needs some service revision!! take care of the customers in the store... don't ignore your guests.. and get off your damn cell phone!!!!! really need to think if we will be back to this location!"}
{"text":"Can only rate the Steinbrenner Calzone from the Ellis Island location and must say- WOW, was that fantastic!!!! The craft beer was excellent as well."}
{"text":"I think the fans of Metro Pizza must have thought they didn't need to vote as that is the only way I can see how Villa Pizza won Best in Vegas last time.  I had a Villa pizza, it was dry and the crust was hard.  The sauce was very acidic.  Metro may be greasy, but good cheese has grease in it.  Their sauce is the best.  The staff remembers you and is very friendly.  This is the Best in Vegas Pizza!"}
{"text":"I'll give it a month when the mindless catch on, but I gotta say I'm not impressed. The pizza tasted like casino buffet pizza, the wings, I can get at any bowling alley or PT's or any hole-in-the-wall, one of the driest spaghetti's I've ever had. I waited 20 minutes for an order of nuke fies which was not evenly distributed, meaning it seems like they threw the fries in a container and dropped a handful of their spice and bagged it. The only thing I can say that stands out is the bread for the meatball sliders and the choice of tap beer."}
{"text":"This was the most expensive pizza I've ever had. Taste was good but 26.00 for a 16 inch pizza was high. Pepperoni on the whole thing and onion and green pepper on one half and mushroom and anchovies on the other half. They charged me for 5 toppings at 2.00 each even though only on half the pizza. They only had 2 sizes 9 inch or 16 inch. Like I said very pricey but taste was good. Lacking in sauce so it was a little dry. I will not go back too many other options that are just as good for less money."}
{"text":"Great Pizza, but get it HOT right out of the oven!  Had ventured to this Metro pizza a couple of years ago after trekking over from the Flamingo hotel...had grabbed a 2 for 1 slice of their plain cheese pizza...then went to the convenience store nearby and grabbed an ice cold bottle of Mexican Coca Cola...I was in heaven with that combination.  Two years later we made the trek again...three times 9after hopping on the shuttle from the Rio to Bally's (and a five minute walk)).  The first visit, the pizza was still incredible.  We had to wait 10 minutes for the pizza to come out of the oven, but it was worth the wait. Also had the pizza with a pint of the Elllis Island beer home brew...delicious combination.  The second visit was OK. Again we had to wait for the pizza to come out of the oven, but it wasn't as good as the previous slices...kinda soggy and not crispy.  The third visit was totally terrible, instead of waiting to have a pizza slice fresh from the oven we grabbed a slice that was under the heat lamp. The cashier said it had only been there for a few minutes. The pizza was kinda cold and the experience made me frustrated that we didn't wait for fresh pizza from the oven...in hindsight, I wish I had complained to the cashier about our experience."}
{"text":"Est 1928, so is there customer service & food. Arrogant behavior and food as old as 1928. Hope I won't fall sick tonight."}
{"text":"Was okay nothing too different. They didn't mark boxes the calzones came in so we had to finger them until we figured it out.... Also I forgot to pack my vacation silverware and asked if they could provide and they agreed. However when the items arrived there was everything under the sun accept silverware.   FOOD: Calzones have ricotta cheese in them which isn't listed on the menu. They give you a generous size pie but its greasy as hell. Yes yes i know its pizza greasy is to be expected but I never have had a calzone so greasy before. Crust was nice and golden! If it wasn't for the silverware I'd give it a 3 stars... Also missing was 2 sides of ranch. Overall poor experience"}
{"text":"Once a month, I like to come to Metro Pizza with some friends and family or even by myself and enjoy the pizza happy hour. The food is great but it also costs a lot more than other pizza parlors. I'd say you get what you paid for. That's why the weekday Tuesday-Thursday happy hour deal is so nice.... if you come at the right time.  The service is a little below average- the waiters are slow in their pace and usually bored. I usually don't mind since I'm busy talking or doing my own thing. This past Tuesday, I came in by myself for a Large stuffed pizza (Skyline) at 1:50 PM, totally forgetting that happy hour is between 2:30-4:30. The pizza was big but average tasting. When I got the bill I was bummed that I totally forgot the happy hour times but it's totally fine since I like supporting family businesses. When I brought the check to the counter to pay, I mentioned to the cashier that I totally forgot about happy hour.   I would have been thrilled if they honored it, or it would have still been just fine if they just said sorry. Instead, the lady told me, \"Yeah... I guess you'll just have to skip pizza for a bit.\" I paid and left a lot angrier than I expected. How about I skip Metro Pizza altogether? Seriously, I wouldn't waste my time to write this review if I wasn't this angry, 3 days after the fact just remembering her response.  5/5 Star Pizza 3/5 Star Price 0/5 Star Customer Service"}
{"text":"I chose Metro Pizza based on the reviews that I read on Yelp. I was very skeptical as I was catering for a rehearsal dinner in Las Vegas from Miami! I called the catering department a few weeks in advance and Julie couldn't have been more helpful....considering I must have called her back a few times with changes. She was very patient and accomodating! I even called her the day before the dinner, because we forgot about dessert....and she came through with flying colors. The food was delivered on time, and our delivery guy - Steve was the best. They had forgotten the sauce for our wings, and he returned with it a short time later! The garlic knots and meatballs were sensational! The pizza and italian sausages were delicious as well. A lot of food for a reasonable price.  Everything was a big hit with our guest....who are \"italian food connoisseurs\"!   I plan to use them again when we go back to Vegas!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here and I have to say it was some darn good pizza. I can't wait to go back and have some spaghetti and dessert which I had no room for because the stuffed pizza is super filling. I stuffed it and had two slices. Chill atmosphere and nice people working here. I'll be back ;)"}
{"text":"Cool little pizza place off on Decatur.  Didn't know it was a chain till I saw the take-out box.  When you go in, it looks like someone either misses the 80's or they built that place in 1985.    Even though it's not deep_dish (somehow reviews say it's that, but it's not ), this was good.  The key was the dough.  When we got the little garlic rolls, and they had that good 'doughy smell, I couldn't wait for the pizza.  Very soft, chewy, and tasty.    We got the salad and a large stuffed pizza.  Somehow I'm not good at size estimation, because this pizza was probably for 6 people, not three.  We had like half the pizza left!    Will definitely go again, just to try a different (and smaller) pizza.  Good Value, good pizza, great for what it is.... Yeah I think I'll give it 5."}
{"text":"I have been to two different Metro Pizza locations. Both looked very different but the pizza always tasted great.  When people asked me of a good pizza spot Metro Pizza is what i suggest.  The Gotham Pizza is my favorite. Its loaded with great toppings and it taste perfect. The service is a bit slow but its not like you're at Lil Ceasers, good pizza takes time.  They have a great seletion of beers to choose from and the prices are decent.  The Tropicana and Maryland Parkway location is pretty nice id suggest that one.  The Decater and Flamingo location is a smaller venue but the quality of the food is still the same. I'm actually way over due for another Metro Pizza trip soon.."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place!!! I come with the family every time I visit my grandparents in Vegas. The last time I was here I just had to bring my boyfriend who loves pizza. He really enjoyed it. Their fries, hot wings and metro pizza are the best. I'm not much of a pizza person, but metro pizza is making me rethink this. The staff is friendly and the setting is nice as well."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Vegas. If you like thick crust, you have to try the Metro thick crust. It is amazing. The only negative with this place is the price, but sometimes you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Chicken parmesan dinner....crispy breaded chicken breast...served on a bed of spaghetti and marinara sauce was awesome lackin NO flavor what do everever gotta try great service...everyone was attenive and nice"}
{"text":"Good food.  Terrible service.  I have been to this location twice and both times my order came out wrong and management acted like it was my fault.  What a joke.  Typical Vegas.  \"My product is good so I can treat you like crap\".  One more thing...  Try hiring some people that can take an order without screwing it up!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! The service was good as well. I enjoyed the meat lovers pizza except for the hamburger bits. It didn't quite go with the rest of the pizza. The buffalo wings were excellent. They have cheap beers, $3 and $4!! Next time They had grease (the movie) themed decorations which I enjoyed. They offer a pizza making class in the evenings that I would like to try one day too. Next time I'm in Vegas I will def stop by!"}
{"text":"They have amazing pizza and I must admit customer service 5 stars their chicken fingers we're good and even come with fries I ordered from this place for the first time and I like it delivery driver was friendly the girl who answered the phone was very kind and the food taste great so if you're looking for that good old school kind of pizza feel call this place leave and delivered to my home which is kind of far from where they're located so yes 5 stars thank you very much Metro pizza I will be calling you again in the future I hope that you keep living up to the expectations not that I have high expectations but just want to be treated fair and this time you did a great job so 5 stars for you I might add their chicken fingers come with french fries and ranch which is really good by the way so I will call you again in the future and keep updating photos I'm kind of curious to see how the Philly cheesesteaks are as well as other items that you offer"}
{"text":"Just tried this place today because of reviews. We had a Cicero - meatball stuffed pizza. It was good. The delivery arrived ahead of schedule. The crust was good. The cheese and the meat dipping sauce was really good. It felt a little light on the meatballs. I might order this again but if I do I will order extra meatballs."}
{"text":"Love the pizza here! The Sunday special is amazing, buy one get one free. We got two large pizzas, one was the Memphis (BBQ Chicken) and the other was extra pineapple. We always order ours well done as the pizza is thin crust and we think it's fantastic slightly more done. Highly recommend, this is our go to pizza spot in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent and well priced. However the service is beyond SLOW and a little off we had to ask for silverware for everyone in our party and ask for refills.  If you are hungry or in a hurry it really sucks.  Thankfully the bread they serve you is super yummy (although I was almost full on the bread by the time the pizza came)....the pizza itself was fresh and tasty.  If their service was a little more on the ball (quicker and better) it would have gotten 5 stars.  Oooh I didn't try them but they did have red velvet whoopie pies!"}
{"text":"This has been my goto place for dinner when I don't feel like cooking. It has been for years. Programmed in my phone, same order every time. 2 Chicken Pasta salads. Price now 31.25. Picked up my order. These were the worst I have ever gotten. Not much chicken plus overdone and greasy. Supposed to be broccoli in there. 1 piece in one 0 in the other. One half piece of sliced tomato per salad. I can not believe they put these in a bag and out the door. I just can't believe this is a new normal.  If smaller portion is for cost savings they just lost a lot because they have lost a years long customer. Someone should check the to go orders before they are handed to customers."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. Had the Triple Play with the addition of peppers and mushrooms. Nice thin and crispy crust. Sausage is definitely \"Chicago type \" sausage -- excellent. Kristie my waitress was very good and very attentive. Would go back again.."}
{"text":"YUM, great crust and sauce.  Little pricey but never disappoints... gelato good too.  Garlic fries are ridiculous."}
{"text":"Yummy!! I love this pizza it's so good since it has lots of flavor. I recommend to not have more than 2 toppings bec if you have a lot it doesn't taste as good. I really enjoyed the pepperoni and basil pizza. Must try this pizza!"}
{"text":"Food was okay. But the server was horrible. Leticia (sp?)  had brown thin hair. She was rude, rolled her eyes and disregarded anything that we had to. Favorite part of the visit was the cannoli. But, I will never go back due to her service. She seemed to have personal friends at another table and spent all her time chatting with them."}
{"text":"We asked them to maker our crust a little thinner than standard and they were friendly about it and made it perfect. The cheese was cooked perfectly. Only complaint, and a very minor one, is the sauce. Tasted just a bit too tomato pasty. Very good experience and will definitely go again whenever we stay at Rio."}
{"text":"Just went to metro pizza for the first time with my husband and the moment we walked into the door it was horrible. The hostess were very rude and unprofessional. The first server who came by and took our drink order heard my husbands and just assumed I wanted the same thing. Then our next server comes and is so impatient about us ordering... my husband asked about their beer and he seemed like he had no idea. We finally ordered and get our pizza and one of the pizzas came with sauce on the side (weird) and I asked the server what the sauces were and he answered me very rude. The moment I bite into our stuffed pizza it's very cold and the meatballs were not good. The server was also really bad at our refills. We really could not wait to leave and get our check which took 20 minutes after we asked for it."}
{"text":"This place is awful, in particular the service from the get go. Initially there was this young girl who took my order on 9/4. She was rude, ignorant to not one but all questions (I hope you see this). Upon receiving our pizza, there was no receipt . The pizza was cold... To say the least my experience with Metro Pizza was atrocious. Awful enough to have me download the Yelp app and write this review. If you need a pizza get it from somewhere else. Trust me..."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of Metro. It's truly the only place in town that I've found has edible pizza. Their specialty pies are really great   I love the creative thoughts behind them.  TONIGHT THOUGH.......... I've been out all day it's late I don't wanna cook and I'm tired but STARVING!! I didn't know they delivered until I checked Yelp. $35.00 & an hour later I had my pie. It was good but not gourmet good. Come on Metro!! Really?!?"}
{"text":"First time at metro pizza    Easy to find location.  Was greeted by a ho hum person who really just didn't care.  Seated us and we waited for so long my husband said we will give them 2 more min .    we are here and if they don't show we are out of here.  Two min later a waitress showed up and took our drink and dinner order. Maria didn't care if we were there or not.  I ordered a dinner salad and a glass of wine hubby chose a beer ( poor selection)  We ordered dinner at the same time as we were afraid Maria wouldn't come back. ( only one other table In The place  had anyone at it) time was around 6 pm Bar had 2 tables with folks eating.  Ordered the margarita pizza on half and the metro on the second. Started eating the meto special and it was all sausage and Grease. Crust was good and the other half margarita was fine .   A place to take young kids but not a great place for great pizza  Poor service poor quality for the money bill was over $ 40 for two with 2 small house beers and one glass of wine ( I think the beers were 6 ounces) maybe less."}
{"text":"Awesome. Best pizza in Vegas. The specialty pizzas are the thing to get. My favorite is the Seafood Fra Diavalo (sp?). The half loaf of bread they give while you wait is good. The garlic knots are the best I've ever had. Late hours are a plus as is the calendar specials. I always order more than I can eat because it's so good reheated in the toaster oven the next day. Actually it's so good I've been The Duke on multiple occasions."}
{"text":"Wish I could give a 4.5 star rating.  The place isn't perfect but its darn close.  I've been going back to this Metro location in Henderson at least once a week now for a month due to its early bird special, Mondays through Thursdays 2:30-4:30pm..  My \"weekend\" is Wed/Thurs, so it works perfect for me.  I'm probably the least desirable type of customer due to the fact that I always eat solo (no friends have these days off), I frequently only order water and I only go when the pizzas are half-off.  To a waiter, I'm probably not much of a tip generator.  However, I've NEVER felt the service was any less positive than if I was with a big group of people ordering beers and paying full price.  Because of this, I usually tip close to 20% of what the bill would have been without the discount.  It's still a great deal.  I also appreciate that the quality of the food isn't affected in ANY way, even though its half-off.  I've only ordered the San Genaro and Gotham pizzas but am thinking about trying some of their weirder specialty pizzas in future visits (I actually think there's one with diced clams on it).  Very good pizza and service with a great early-bird special.  Please check this place out!"}
{"text":"Metro Pizza is really good.  My wife and I are rather unadventurous, so we usually just get a regular pie with pepperoni and sausage.  The bread they give you beforehand is also very good.  The ambiance at the newer locations is much nicer, but if you want a trip back to the 80s, check out the one on Decatur."}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I last ate at the famous Metro Pizza and let me say... time has not been good to this once great place. The first indication that things had changed was the fact that I parked in the front row during the lunch rush. In the past you almost had to settle for the Smart and Final overflow lot from 11:00 to 1:30. Once inside the dazed and confused hostess somehow found the effort to say, \"How many\". These two words were all I got. I believe she is getting paid by the least amount of words she uses during her interactions with guests. I imagine the phrase, \"Hello\", or \"How is your day going\" would be too costly and have been removed from her script. Once at the booth I noticed the familiar table cloths that I remember were on the tables when I last visited some 4 years ago. I was impressed that they only had 7 or 8 deep dirty cuts in them considering their age. The good news is that they did go hand in hand with the chipped up painted floor. But enough of about the atmosphere! I mean I would eat off an old tire if it was good!  We ordered the salad and the Gothic from the very nice waitress. The salad was good! But the pizza was...not so good, unless you're a fan of soggy tasteless pie. I would have to say that this new Metro Pizza might make the pies the day before and warm them up when ordered. It just seemed like we were eating day old pie that was heated up in a large microwave.  The sad thing is I would recommend Metro Pizza to ANYONE looking for good local pizza blindly. Because I was going off my past experience. Now...not so much. Sorry guys I know you offered a comment card at the end of the meal but there just wasn't enough room to put my feeling on a 6x3 card. Bottom line is you guys need to step it up! Get back in there and get that place back to what it was."}
{"text":"We just left Metro Pizza we had  the Modesto Pizza it was great.  The one problem we had is the hostess who seated us she had no personality did not even greet us just took us to the table and that was it."}
{"text":"Went here for  a snack right after the UNLV  REBELs  thrashed  top ranked BYU 88-74.   I had the chicken marsala sandwich. It was very bland and lacked flavor. The ciabatta bread was too dense or thick for me. My friend had the Italian sub which did not look too appetizing. The pepperoni pizza was OK. Next time I will stick to the pizza. Do not even bother ordering anything else. Service was a little below average. We did not get our drinks refilled. The weird looking bus girl was a bit too detached from her duties. Not the best. Not the worst."}
{"text":"This pizza place is delicious!!! Their pizza taste fresh especially their crust!! The crust is soft,crunchy, and delicious!! Their salads is yummy as well. The pizza is large to full you up, since the slice are large as well. I tho recommend cutting it in half to make the right size for ur self, while the other half can go to you'r friend/family member. This meal is also the best meal I had today. I recommend eating in this pizza place!"}
{"text":"I had one slice of pepperoni and one slice of Margherita pizza. It was Thursday which happened to be the day of their 2 slices for the price of 1 promotion. What a deal! The slices were large, the pizza was excellent, very tasty with generous toppings and neither too crisp or too limp. Combined with a $3 draft beer from Ellis Island's brewery, it was a very satisfying meal. I will definitely be back here again."}
{"text":"Get the stuffed pizza it is amazing! best pizza in Vegas IMO. if you want all around good italian food Napoli's is your place. If you want pizza and only pizza, Metro is the winner."}
{"text":"I have only eaten here three times, but all three times have been fantastic.  The pizza is amazing, some of the best pizza I have ever eaten..  The service is great, and they have a great beer/wine selection."}
{"text":"Their pizzas are great and the atmosphere is good, the prices are affordable."}
{"text":"Gave this place a couple chances to redeem themselves and they couldn't do it.. We've been here 3 times and all 3 times we walk in there...wait 30 mins at our table and no one acknowledges us so we just leave....it's that bad"}
{"text":"ONLY good place to get pizza in all of Las Vegas. I love thin crust pizza, they make it to perfection! The antipasto salad is VERY delicious as well."}
{"text":"After more than 20 years I still highly recommend Metro pizza! Here is an excellent reason why.  I recently had a small problem at one of the restaurants; but the customer service by John, one of the Las Vegas area co-founders, was unparalleled to anything experienced previously from any other LV restaurants. What was most impressive was that he reached out to me and was proactive about taking care of me and my family and making sure we were satisfied with Metro Pizza. Not only am I extremely impressed, I'm very thankful. John's concern was genuine and he earnestly took care of us. Definitely actions that went above and beyond the call of duty, and yet another reason to tell all your friends to support Metro Pizza!"}
{"text":"Went back just for the Talenti gelato! Omgosh it's so delicious! The service at this place is good, but the best thing they have to offer is this gelato! yummy!"}
{"text":"Just left this location. It's a Tuesday at noon and not busy at all. The waitress must have been overwhelmed because we only saw her once. Halfway through the meal nobody in my party was even offered a refill. An hour later we're waiting on refills and the check. Two tables around me also complained about the service. The pizza was good but there are hundreds of better pizza options in Vegas/Henderson that understand the value of customer service."}
{"text":"Metro pizza is a place that I heard alot of people talk about. Then I read all about the  \"Best of\" awards. So I eyeballed the menu and found a gem of a pizza  The skyline is a stuffed pizza that looks beautiful and taste even better When you order it make sure you get the meat sauce. The pizza comes With the sauce on the side but don't worry it's all good  Always always perfect"}
{"text":"Greasy food, which actually made me sick the next day."}
{"text":"Awesome! Get the thin crust! Classic New York style. Stop off for happy hour, it's half off pizzas for dine in. Great bread."}
{"text":"There was a large group of us visiting Vegas for a bachelor party and the groom wanted pizza so we attempted to try Metro. We had to take multiple cabs to get out group there. We arrived 10 minutes before closing and the hostess (who was still manning the front door) notified us that they were closed. I pointed out that we were their before their posted closing time and that we were planning on giving them some substantial patronage. She started to seat us when a cook literally ran up to the front to put the kabosh on that. He said he was, \"just following orders\" and I asked to speak to the manager. He said something dirty under his breath and at that point I felt that it wasn't safe to order food from the kitchen and we left. Obviously can't comment on the food, but of their food is reflective of their service, don't go."}
{"text":"I'm not a local, so I don't know if this is the best pizza in LV - but I can absolutely say Metro (Henderson) has the BEST MARGHERITA PIZZA EVER. And their house Italian (?) dressing is enough to bring me back for more. I could eat salad straight for a week if I had this dressing! It's \"like candy\". ;-) I already thought their food was great after just the salad and bread (dip that in the dressing, too!); but the margherita pizza put Metro over the top in my book.  So, Metro Pizza Guys, when are you coming out to NorCal? :-))"}
{"text":"Great place. Great food. Love the knots and the Gotham pizza. Portion sizes are huge. Prices are reasonable. The staff is friendly. We always have a great time."}
{"text":"I'm Italian and from Chicago.  I am used to having a certain caliber of pizza.  Not deep-dish pizza like everyone thinks is the only kind served in Chicago, either.  Local Chicago people mostly eat thin-crust pizzas and it's hard to find a bad one in Chicago.  Now on to Metro.  Most of the pizza is Vegas is bad.  That's just the way it is.  Too many pizza places here trying to sell cheap pizza with bad ingredients.  There are actually a few places in Vegas now that have Chicago-style thin crust pizza.  Metro is the best one.  Metro serves only one kind of Chicago pizza called the \"Triple Play.\"  It's a thin-crust pizza with cheese and LOTS of sausage.  I always order mine with only half the normal amount of sausage because they actually put too much on.  This is by far the best Chicago-style thin crust pizza I have had in Vegas and for that it gets 5 stars.  They order the sausage straight from Chicago.  I know because I asked the manager once before because it tastes just like sausage I would get in Chicago which is to say it's damn good.  You can also go there and buy this sausage by the pound which I do often because it's the best Italian sausage you can find in Vegas."}
{"text":"Got a follow-up call today from management at the e Sky Pointe location.  Manager made took some concerns to a new level...I will not visit this property again and I feel for the servers who work for an arrogant @$$.     Was so looking forward to pizza and a beer.  Pizza here is quite good.  Beer selection is below average.  Had to settle for an unknown craft beer at a nationally known price.  Asked server about beer selection and was told they stick to Italian beer.  Gee...Stella is Belgian...Sam Adams (which they were out of) is American.  Could not identify an Italian offering.  50% of all available was craft and nobody could make a comparison.  C'mon man!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Was looking for true New York Style pizza, and actually found it. Reasonably priced, wide menu selection, and only a couple miles off the strip. Staff really hustles, and food comes in an acceptable time. Party of 22 next to me got their main courses in about the same time as I did."}
{"text":"Yummm thin crust pizza in vegas :) I'm sold! Pizza was delish. Service was great (it was a quiet tuesday night though) and we didn't have to wait long for our pizza. In the \"waiting time\" they serve you fresh bread. No complaints :) I'll be back when my next pizza craving hits!"}
{"text":"Miss this pizza so much!  Have tried every place here in SD and no one comes close.   The best pies and sauce ever!!"}
{"text":"OMG, the pizza here is so bomb, I love it, the only problem is they charge u $10 delivery, can u believe that, they r crazy!! That's how much it costs 4 a pizza!!!!! Ridiculous!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Okay. I dined last night and metro pizza. Overall experience could of been better. This is solely on service. The food was by far amazing.   It was my first visit we sit down drinks right away. We ordered all was well. Waiting for our food a dif story. It took literally 30 for pizza and meatball sliders. FOREVER! The food was good though. However next time I'm ordering take out."}
{"text":"When we sat down we had to wait for 5 minutes before our server showed up.  We decided to order everything all at once and our food came but didn't have napkins or silverware.  We didn't see our server for about 10 min.  Next time I'm just going to order takeout.  Crappy service"}
{"text":"Definitely a hidden gem. My wife and I agree that this is one of the best pizza places we have found it in Las Vegas. Service, food, and cleanliness were all top-notch. Our waiter was very attentive and answered all of our questions about the different pizza styles. He even brought two samples to our table for us to try. We will definitely be returning"}
{"text":"Really great square Sicilian pizza! Ann was our server and we had a great time. Everyone was extremely polite and we had a great first experience here! There was another guy that got our drinks and was helping her, and he was sweet too.   We'll be back soon!   Pro Tip: try the garlic knots!!"}
{"text":"Good food at bit over priced for the items and divlevery is a joke in price but food is still good."}
{"text":"This place for pizza it's really good . Better than buying  the known brands PH or DNS pizza etc etc...  It's fast service , clean and friendly staff And  it's never a big waiting time to enjoy your pizza .  They have huge sitting area  inside and out.    I highly recommend  this place and after you finish your pizza  you can always have desert just down next door inside the same complex."}
{"text":"The closet thing you will get to east coast pizza, they use the best ingredients and offer pecorino Romano cheese, def a go to, the guy who runs this joint takes serious pride in his work"}
{"text":"Busy on a Friday night but we were accommodated after a few minutes. Good food and great service. A nice friendly place to have dinner."}
{"text":"Now I consider myself a connosiour of pizza, having eaten it up and down the East Coast, from Boston to Philly to NYC to DC.  When I moved to Las Vegas 8 years ago I pined for a slice of NYC pizza I'd eaten standing on the sidewalk so many times, but to no avail.   While Metro pizza is not NYC, but they make a solid pie. My wife and daughter hit this place up a couple weeks ago on a monday during their half off pizza (mon-thurs, 2:30-4:30pm.  Yes I've been called a cheap bastard, and I consider it a complement). The place was half empty, and they sat us in a booth near the bar.  We ordered the CIcero, a stuffed pizza with meatballs, ricotta and mozzerella and a kids spaghetti.   The service sucked.  45 minutes to make a pie and spaghetti in a half empty place?  I've been in and out of this place in 45 mins when it was packed.  The pizza was great, the spaghetti overcooked with watered down sauce.  I could tell the bartender didn't like waiting tables, asked several times for things that never came and just gave up.  Would I go back?  Hell yeah. Just wouldn't sit near the bar, and would never order anything off the kids menu again."}
{"text":"Bad service. We called yesterday to order pizza and they said it'll be ready in 15 minutes. We drive from our home and it took us about 15-20 minutes. We get there and there's a huge line, we wait for another 15 minutes and when we finally get to the front of the line the lady said \"wow you got here early\" ????? And if had already been about 30 minutes at least, she said it would take 30 more minutes !!!!! Horrible service. They will tell you inaccurate time, so if you call and they tell you a certain time, maybe expect to have your pizza one hour later then the time they tell you."}
{"text":"Good pizza & the garlic bread knots wasn't bad. The meal was a little pricey for pizza. The restaurant was extremely loud. Our server was very attentive and friendly. Overall, our meal was pretty average."}
{"text":"My brother and I orderd a larger pizza yesterday from this place and when it arrived the crust was burnt, and the pizza was extra greasy! We call to let the manager know how horrible our pizza was, he said he would give us a credit for a free pizza for next time. We'll next time came, we asked to redeem our credit for our free pizza and the girl tells us we owe $13 for the toppings! I  guess our credit was for a  NO topping pizza, don't think we will order from metro again."}
{"text":"Good fresh sauce and delicious crust. I ordered the cheese pizza. It was hot, fresh, and tasty! My only complaint was that they were out of spinach salads. Thursdays 2 for 1 pizzas."}
{"text":"Best pizza ,wings and their specialty fries .. cute place inside and staff was super friendly. . We were super happy that we finally found a great pizza place and not be ridiculously expensive"}
{"text":"The manager Dave is the best. He is considerate, sincere, and truly want you to enjoy your visit at Metro. He is very well dressed by the way. My husband and I keep coming back because of him. The food is good, the staff is good, but Mr. Dave is GREAT!!"}
{"text":"Good experience always. Very good crust whether you want thick or thinner crust. God selection of toppings. Worth the trip."}
{"text":"I have lived in the northwest for years. I have driven past this restaurant many times on my way home. I finally decided to take the family there for dinner last week and give it a shot. We did not have the highest of expectations. Unfortunately, it still fell short.   The staff was nice enough but there was nothing memorable about them at all. The furniture was fairly beat up and the food was sub-standard. My wife had eaten at another Metro Pizza years ago and remembered that they had delicious garlic knots. This time however, they were not good. They were very dry. My wife and I both ordered the stromboli, and the kids shared a small cheese pizza. All of it was extremely greasy and unappetizing. The stromboli looked more like a panini. The kids barely ate one slice a piece of their pizza. If you are looking for a nice pizza place to take the family, you can do much better than Metro Pizza. Not terrible but definitely below average."}
{"text":"Vast selection of pizzas; Chicago style, NY style, unique pizza toppings, flavorful.  Attentive staff and great service. Have to improve their wine refrigeration, the red wine was served on the extremely warm side, and not room temperature. Other than that, I would definitely recommend and return."}
{"text":"there are only two reasons to come to metro pizza: the first is a little slice of heaven called \"pasta pie\"; the other is the garlic fries!! outside of those two items i can give no advice. that being said, i don't care if i can't talk on anything else because i will never order anything other than a pasta pie! i'm only in vegas four times a year, if that; so this is one of my MUST HAVES when i'm in town!  metro is kind of cheesy 80s colors with some florescent lights. the glowing sign will guide you to a pasta pie happy ending. the big booths in the back are great for larger parties; especially once those tummies are filled on said pasta pie! although the pizza is a tad pricey; it's quite difficult to finish more than a slice and a half. i recommend getting a pasta pie on your first night in vegas, then you'll have late night meals for the next couple of days! HOOOOOOOORAAAAY!"}
{"text":"The service was great and the food was delicious. We came around 3:30, and if you come around 2pm to 4pm the pizzas are half price, so we got amazing food for a really good price. It's totally worth it, stop by and give it a try."}
{"text":"The Tuscan salad is amazing . I get it every time I come here . It was a recommendation from our server . The pizza is always good . The sauce on the pizza is delicious ."}
{"text":"Went with my wife's family in from Chicago on vacation. Thought this would be a good time to try Metro as I am a NY style pizza fan and the reviews were good. Obviously the fam is bias to Chi style but they were willing to give it a shot. Was not impressed at all with this place. Pizza was very bland and the cheese, what they have of it, had no pull or taste. Should have stuck to my instincts and made the drive to Verrazano Pizza for the real deal!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places in Las Vegas is Metro Pizza. The restaurant is large yet is always filled with big families and large groups of friends.   It is very close to the University so it is a popular place to eat.   One of my favorite appetizers is the garlic knots, $4.95. I think they are fun because they are garlic knots that are skewered over metal sticks. They are fun to share. It is served with Marinara sauce.   My favorite salad is the \"Domenica,\" $10.75. It is a chop Italian salad that is comprised of romaine lettuce, salami, ham, provolone, cucumbers, tomatoes and onions. It is tossed in their house dress. It also comes with a garlic knot. One salad can easily be shared with a friend. You can also add chicken or shrimp for $3.00. It is a meal in itself.  Their veggie pizza, \"Green Valley\" is my favorite pizza, $23 (large). It has zucchini, mushroom, onions, black olives and tomatoes.   If you like an off- the- Strip, New York- Little Italy style pizza, this is a great place to visit.   Tip: Check out the calendar while you are there. There are specials every day and it can sometimes get you free food or discounts. :)"}
{"text":"Love love love Metro Pizza. We frequently take out of town visitors here because it gets you away from the strip and you can almost airways get a table quickly and that huge Metro pizza is solo good for sharing. The garlic knots are delicious and the wings are great for appetizers."}
{"text":"Garlic knots are excellent.  I like the Caesar salad.  The pizza is too greasy.  The crust is too soggy!  Love the 1950s vibe.  Improve the pizza then it will be ok."}
{"text":"We came here tonight for a team dinner . Got here are 6 pm . They told us we had to be out by 8 because they had a party of 125 coming.So our party of 25 didn't matter   Service  was incredibly horrible..The employees were rude I'm never going there again.."}
{"text":"As most locals know Metro Pizza is arguably Las Vegas's best pizza. Make mine a pepperoni and mushroom pie."}
{"text":"Great service but I didn't like the pizza the taste wasn't bad but it wasn't great either ....it was meh :/  and it was very greasy . The wings were good and the house salad was yummo  .I had the chicken parmesan ( my hubby had a small pizza ) my meal was not bad ( portions are  big by the way ) but I was so full from all the other food ,  I hardly ate it . Our server was nice and even gave my baby girl a free ice cream :) again service was great it was the pizza I didn't love but maybe you will , so give it a whirl ! Gave 4 stars because their service and the atmosphere was great but the food didn't knock my socks off :)   ps. I used the check in for a free drink coupon and the waiter said no problem  , then we were charged anyway :(  double check your ticket if you use the free drink check in coupon ."}
{"text":"I ordered spaghetti meat balls and its the worst i ever had. Meatballs tasted its from a can. I cant hardly taste the spaghetti sauce. Theres too much noodles and less sauce.   Only good thing with the food i had was the salad which you can pretty much order any where.   Our server is not friendly at all and didn't even bother explain to us the menu, didn't properly introduced her self, didn't bother to ask if we like our food.   Food quality is not good.   We wont come back"}
{"text":"We are a fan of Metro Pizza but not this location. Service was slow and hostess is completely lost. She started be wanting to sit us next to a group of 20 right next to the small kids side of the group. I asked to sit elsewhere as the place was not busy. The next group of 2 she did seat next to the kids, they looked upset. Next pizza was coming out to tables that were after us and the group of 20 even got their food after several groups that came in well after them. We just sat and watched how everyone was working. This location compared to the Tropicana and Henderson location needs some serious help. If you like Metro Pizza as we do stay away from the centennial location, go to the other locations."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good, but the service is lackluster.  I counted 5-6 employees waiting near the ovens watching patrons yet we couldn't get a server to take our order and forget about a drink refill.  I generally wouldn't leave such a low review if the food is good, but of the several times we have been here the service has been consistently poor. We have decided to order food to go if we really want a pizza from here.  A bright spot- they have great ranch dressing."}
{"text":"If you want very expensive pizza ($14 for two slices) that are very doughy, tasteless sauce and boring cheese that isn't distributed evenly and not melted, this is the place!!!! I don't have high standards for airport food but this was insanely disappointing."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place! Tastiest pizza in Vegas. I've been going to this location for years. Excellent service and the food is always delectable. Jarvis and Katie are my favorite servers :) They are always friendly and attentive. I highly recommend this restaurant. Don't forget to try the nuclear fries. Yummy!!"}
{"text":"Sometimes you just know it's going to be one of those days. Third trip to Metro. Last checkin was the first sit down. Took wifey with me for one of those evening out things.  Deena was our server and she was terrific. Problem was, she wasn't supposed to be our server.  She was doing the emergency cover for the person whose section we were sitting in.  Never found out who that wayward soul was. Got seated and then got forgotten. Wow! When was the last time that happened? It's been a while.    The food was top shelf as always and it was all you can eat pasta night. Happy about the food, a little salty about the service.   Once is an oops, twice is a trend. Going to give it one more shot just to check.  I'll let you know.    Should give this a one star for being forgotten. Three stars because the food was on point and Deena went the extra yard to make up for the nameless laggard who apparently forgot that if people sit in your section you might want to find out why they are there. Who knows, they could actually be customers looking to order food."}
{"text":"Pizzas are yummy, but I love their meatball sliders! The atmosphere is here is so warm and welcoming. You can tell management takes care of the staff by the cohesive feel you get from the entire staff. Great customer service with cool funk atmosphere. The staff is very knowledgeable and make it simple to order food. Overall a nice Family fun night! Bring the kids and a hefty appetite."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the food! A little pricey, but overall we liked everything we ordered.  (Nuclear fries and a large pizza 1/2 Memphis and 1/2 Modesto) We will go back and also recommend to friends who are looking for a good pizza place.  The place is spacious and overall staff service was great.  Our food arrived quickly and our server made sure to check on us often."}
{"text":"This pizza is one of my favorites but is not my number one favorite. I have yet to find a Pizza that could be considered the best pizza ever. I ordered a basic pepperoni and cheese pizza. The bread is good and the toppings are quality. They seem to have a variety of house pizzas that looked and smelled of great quality. This is not a cheap slice and price place. If you want good pizza and a place to chill outside of the strip, this is the spot. The service was forgettable but most places are. I've been here two or three times and enjoyed the pizza every time. The pepperoni pineapple and jalapeños on half is the Key."}
{"text":"This pizza joint is God's gift to earth. I ordered the Stromboli which is the kind of food that makes you feel so incredibly guilty the whole way home. Three types of meat wrapped in cheese and then wrapped in pizza dough. My mouth is honestly watering while writing this.  I think they put salads on the menu for health inspection reasons because we all know if you're coming in here you're leaving your calorie counter at the door. I met the owners once or twice because I won an essay contest for my hospitality class. What great people, but how can you not be when your spreading cheesy joy across the land.... or at least Tropicana. Did I mention there is a bar too?! 'Nuff said. My only complaint is I have yet to see my name on their calendar. I'm trying to eat some discounted pizza fam. JUST LOVE ME #5Stars"}
{"text":"John and his staff took great care of us last week.  We started with the Domenica salad, then garlic knot sliders, pizza, and finally pasta.  Everything was done well and the hospitality was great."}
{"text":"Don't order pizza for pick up on a holiday. Was told it'd be a 1.5 hour wait for pickup, fine. Two hours later and I am still planning. The manager is clearly in over his head and poorly prepared. The line is out the door and not moving. The manager should be demoted for his poor planning. Phones are ringing no one is answering and the staff looks like they're about to cry. Poorly managed, food might be good, but the place is poorly run."}
{"text":"Food is good, but service was slow. Being able to walk in on a Friday and not have a wait, you would assume that the service would be quick and on point. We waited about 45- an hour before our food came out.and by that time both my kids had been finished and ready to go home. The kitchen was way to slow for how \"busy\" they were....   Tip the kids menu pizza is enough for dinner for 2 it's a 10\" pizza and worth the $5.50. Order your kids meal first!"}
{"text":"Very good pizza,especially when I have them put it back in to oven to have my crust crispy to the point where the slice  is stiff ,yum...."}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing! My family ordered The Metro Cheese only and The Stuffed Pizza Skyline. The stuffed pizza is literally like a pie. The dough incredible and perfectly baked on bottom and top. Neither of these pizzas were greasy or doughy and uncooked, how most pizza places are unless you get thin crust. The both were amazing. We also ordered fried mozzarella, and wings. The wings were fantastic. The fried mozzarella normally comes in sticks, but here it comes in large triangular pieces with an amazing breading. The cannoli's are delicious too! We did takeout, but after going and seeing how nice this place is set up, we will be dining in next time! By the way the staff I interacted with just for pick were amazing. They even offered my girls free samples of the gelato, which by the way again AMAZING!!!"}
{"text":"The restaurant was empty when we came in. It's probably because we went for a late lunch about 3 pm. No one greeted us as we entered. I had to eye a cook and told him table for 2. He motioned to sit where ever. Ok, so we sat.  The waiter came by shortly after and he was nice. We ordered the Abbondanza, half Modesto and half Sunspot.  The pizzas were decent. We got happy hour prices so we can't really complain. It was a great deal. I am not sure if I would pay full price since nothing really stand out and menu price was a bit on the pricey side."}
{"text":"Needed to get away from the Vegas Strip so we ventured out to this local joint for lunch one day. The pizza was good. The sauce was flavorful and all. The crust was OK - not as crispy as I would like. They did have many other crust options, but we went with the regular crust with the recommendation of the waitress.  The service was OK. I mean, it wasn't that crowded, but the wait times were pretty long. Not a big ding on that, but also not worthy of a plus."}
{"text":"The food was ok but the service was kinda bad. I hardly complain about service but they did take forever to bring out the food. And yes, it was full that night I went so I wont bash them too hard. When we got our food, it tasted like it was sitting there for some time already and they forgot about our food. I would give them another shot maybe during lunch hours."}
{"text":"nom nom nommm. Im keeping this short and simple the pizza here is so good! They also have blue moon on tap."}
{"text":"Great pizza with plentiful and interesting combination options. Great all-around pizza place. Garlic fries are addicting! So excited to get a location in the NW soon!"}
{"text":"Reviewers were right when they said this place looked like the cafe: The Max from Saved By the Bell. Staff was friendly and attentive enough. This is a fun place to bring kids for a brithday party, but since I don't have any I won't be coming back too soon. I'm still searching for the right pizza..and haven't found one in Las Vegas anyway.  I had the Modesto specialty pizza that had roasted mushrooms, garlic, roma tomatoes and sausage on it. The crust was my least favorite, I could taste the oil on the bottom-other than that it was just ok."}
{"text":"My first time trying out this place and I will be a returning customer.  Next time we will have to dine in as it seems like a really cool relaxed environment.  I ordered the meatball sliders with the garlic parmesan cheese.  First let me start off with the bread.  The bread it oh so delicious, buttery, and soft.  The meatballs are so good and they fit the entire bread as they were really big.  I was only able to eat 2 of the 4 slider so I will have the rest later.  The garlic parmesan fries were good but they just don't give you enough because I am big french fry person.    So next time I guess I want to try the White Chicken Pizza because the pictures look so freakin good.  Once I try that I will update again to give my review."}
{"text":"This is one of the first original Metro Pizza locations. It still holds up and the pizza is the best."}
{"text":"If I could eat meatball sliders everyday, I would. Forget the pizza. These beautiful, delicious meatball sliders are perfectly seasoned and in between a giant garlic knot. A GIANT GARLIC KNOT! The most genius idea ever. And if that isn't good enough, it comes with a side of garlic Romano fries."}
{"text":"Very good pizza off the strip in Vegas.  Cool place to order some pitchers of beer and watch the games to see how your parlays pan out.  Nice medium crust pizza with good flavor.  I definitely would go back to this place - about 5 minutes from the strip."}
{"text":"The pizza was amazing at first but turned greasy. I decided to try a new kind with noodles stuffed in it. Fucking heaven lemmie tell ya. I would give it one star. But that one kind of pizza made it go to 5 stars. Love that shit. Idk what the fuck its called. But yasssss."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong here with any item that you choose.  These guys have been in business for over 30 years in Vegas, and once you eat here you will know why."}
{"text":"We've eaten here several times great atmosphere, service & food. It's great for larger parties. You can get a big salad for the whole table & the pizza is good"}
{"text":"This has got to be some of the best pizza we've ever had! We come here at least once a week, dine-in and take out. They are so efficient and the food tastes great! I was really amazed by Megan who was handling the pick up area - she is ON IT. So fast and friendly! I highly recommend this great, family oriented, pizza parlor!"}
{"text":"I've always have been a big fan of Metro Pizza. This is the first time I've ever been to this location. Considering the circumstances, I thought that this location was just ok.  Came here for their Three Square event which all the proceeds of their 1 dollar slice of pizza special went to this great charity. This is a great cause and this review has nothing to do with that charity. Coming in here, the place had sort of a retro look to it, sort of a 'Saved by the Bell' type of vibe. Super casual place.  On to the pizza. I thought it was ok, the pizza dough was good. I also thought that the sauce on the pizza was good as well. I wasn't a big fan of the cheese that they used. It seemed to separate a lot, and there was a pile of grease that had accumulated on top of the pizza. Now I have been to other Metro locations over the years. This was probably the first time I had seen this on their pizza. But other than that, it was fine.  I will continue to patronize Metro. They could have had just an off day or something. But generally, the pizza is excellent, probably some of the best I've had ever."}
{"text":"Came in with the family for dinner.  Ordered 2 antipasto salads, fried calamari, eggplant parmigiano, cheese and pepperoni, bottle of Chianti (okay, 2), a canoli and a cappuccino  (cappuccino machine is broke and has been for some time).  Gave 4 stars because they can pre-bus a bit better and enough with the cappuccino, either fix it or buy beans, I know they are expensive.  Food was awesome and we will be back.."}
{"text":"Not really sure how other people came to their reviews.  I come from New York and I absolutely love this pizza.  It's expensive, yes, almost $6 for a veggie slice, which is definitely overpriced, but the flavor is fantastic.  What's cheap at the airport anyway that's half decent?  Here you can get a good slice and you have seating right outside.  The crust is medium thickness, the amount of cheese is nice.  All in all, I love this pizza, would love to come back if I ever come to this terminal at Vegas' airport."}
{"text":"Great Pizza. Great Service.  Great happy Hour prices. Unbeatable."}
{"text":"The food was so good!  We started with a pitcher of the honey porter, which was quite tasty, and the Tuscan Salad.  After having the salad, I almost didn't even want to have pizza- it was sooo good!    For pizza, we ordered a half and half- Sunspot and Gotham. After a full slice of the the Sunspot, I only had room for a bite of the Gotham, but both were delicious. The Sunspot tasted light and fresh, despite it being really filling. The Gotham, from what I had, was really meaty and just as good.  The pizza is pretty heavy, so I would say not to expect to get past a couple slices.  There were 3 of us, and we ended up bringing half the large pizza home.  Definitely making a trip back."}
{"text":"Had buffalo wings (medium) and a large custom pizza (with mushrooms, artichokes, garlic, and tomatoes).   Wings were good, very meaty and not too spicy but still hot. The sauce isn't stuck on the wings but rather a little runny, but it suffices.   The pizza was good too, and the bottom of the crust is very nice and firm, crispy and not soggy like others that might get soggy from the amount of sauce or toppings. Great place and not too crowded as it's not on the Strip but more on the outskirts of Vegas."}
{"text":"Metro Pizza is home to the stuffed pizza, two pizzas one in top of the other created a giant calzone. The prices are high, but the amount of pizza you receive is unbelievable. It really is like eating two pizzas. Plus, the bread you receive before your pizza is to die for!  The joint is always very clean with kind and intelligent employees and is nicely decorated on the inside. They offer takeout and delivery and have a gelato case.  Tips:  -- Between 2 and 4 PM Monday through Thursday, pizzas are half price for dine-in customers. We always order a large and take the rest home. Slices freeze well when wrapped individually in saran wrap.  -- At 7 AM on Black Friday, the store opens to sell gift cards at 50% off. There is always a long line so be sure to arrive early. Each person can buy up to $250 in gift cards (an $800 value). When they sell out, they sell out and the rest of the line goes home disappointed.   So, if you get the 50% off gift cards and go between two and four Tuesday through Thursday, you're getting a gigantic pizza at only 25% of the price."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. The portion size was amazing. Terrible service. When we walked in we didn't get greeted. We waited and looked around. Finally a girl came rushing up to the front and got us a table. After we sat down we got our drink order really quickly but then had to wait a while for our server to come greet us. We weren't ready to order so he said \"wave me down when you know what you want\". Shortly after we figured out what we wanted but couldn't find our server anywhere. There were 4 employees sitting in a booth towards the back of the restaurant but couldn't see our server to flag him down. We waited about another 7 minutes and he finally came to take our order. The food was very good. Our server kept disappearing and talking to another server. At one point he went to refill our drinks and sat it a walk way with our refilled drinks in hand to talk to his buddy for a few minutes. It took a while after we were done eating to get our server to acknowledge we were finished and needed a box. Like I said, good food, bad service."}
{"text":"Possibly one of the best pizza places to eat at in Las Vegas, not only for the food, but service as well! Typically there place is clean, the mens room could be checked on more, however myself and my family typically are happy and full upon leaving. We take a lot of out of town guest here, and they can accommodate large parties!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, thin crust new York style. I go once a month. Great fun atmosphere. Gellato is amazing:)"}
{"text":"Previous visits I had sliders and salads, but lately I've been eating from the pizza portion of the menu exclusively. The rumors and ratings are right: this place has fantastic pizza. Multiple crusts to choose from, several specialty options, but almost everything I've tried has been great.  The Modesto is my favorite: roasted mushrooms, garlic, and roma tomatoes, with fresh basil. And you can add sausage for FREE. Who has ever heard of that?! So props for having legit vegetarian options, and for kicking them up another level with the carnivore customization option. The small is perfect for two, add on some wings or a salad and you won't do too much damage to your diet.  The stuffed pizzas are also a hit- I'm not a fan of carbs on carbs on carbs, but BF would consider selling one of his kidneys for a large Loop (sausage, pepperoni, roasted mushrooms). The marinara dipping sauce is robust and comforting, but the crust is a bit too thick for my personal liking. I will say that the large, 8 slices for $30, is a great deal if you have a large group: similar, smaller, thinner slices in town go for $5/each elsewhere, and this averages out to under $4/slice with much better quality and a larger portion.  And service. It's always great. Phoning in my order is easy, it's always ready on time at pickup, and staff are friendly when I pop in. Bonus points for having the two takeout-pickup spaces in the parking lot!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Metro in years even though it's just blocks from the house.  We remembered the food being really good. Decided last night to grab dinner there.  First thing that hit us was all the Hawaiian decor and music.  No one ever explained what was going on, but people at several other tables were going to spin a wheel for prizes so we figured it must have been a marketing promo.  The bar menu is awful.  Bud no Bud Light.  Coors Light no Coors.  Craft beers.  I ended up ordering a glass of white Sangria that came in a wine glass the size of a tea cup with ice and a slice of lemon hanging on it.  For $5.95!?  The fresh bread that came was really good but came with the single serve plastic cups of butter you get in a McDonald's breakfast tray.  We ordered calamari (which was greasy) and fried mozzarella which had so much breading and seasoning it ruined it.  My husband's meatball sub was good he said.   Unfortunately my eggplant parmesan was made with a thick layer of ricotta cheese!  Ricotta on eggplant parmesan?  No thank you.  The sauce on my pasta had separated to a big lump of tomato paste and a pool of liquid on my plate.   Took 3 bites and was done.   The service was awful and the marinara \"blah\".  It was a Friday night at 6pm in an area of town with limited dining choices. There should have been a line out the front.  Instead, half the tables were empty.  They need to get rid of the goofy marketing promos and focus on fixing the food."}
{"text":"Don't get this wrong - Metro pizza is great.  I usually frequent the one by campus, which would get five stars, hands down.  This particular location though?  The service was bad.  Our waitress didn't seem to know where she was, and that's when we could find her.  Granted, it's been awhile since I've been to any Metro but the pizza here was greasier, thinner, and all together more \"blah\" than I remember.    The bread and the ranch were still good.  I don't know how two locations could vary so much!"}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty great but the $10 delivery fee is not. With tip, I ended up spending $40 for a large pizza. Again, food is great but I won't be recommending Metro again just based on price."}
{"text":"Metro Pizza is known as one of the best pizza places in town and been around for 20+ years. I've been as a kid but not in years. Last night I visited and it didn't disappoint.   We ordered the daily special, one large pizza and an order of atomic fries, all for $19.99. To start, the atomic fries are amazing. They are covered in a spicy season salt that is so good, especially when dipped in their homemade ranch. Their ranch is one of the best I've tasted, ranch lovers like myself know the importance of a pizza joint having homemade ranch!!   As for the pizza, I wasn't in love with it. We ordered half cheese, half pepperoni. The pizza was greedier than expected and the crust was a little too thick for my liking."}
{"text":"Been coming to this location since 1992, don't go as often as I used to because I live in Red Rock now. Made the drive for their stuffed pizza and house salad with honey mustard. Upon arriving, I wait a few minutes and leave with my order. I get down the road and I check the pizza, it's the wrong one. I call them and the girl says we can credit you for next time. I just drove 25 minutes to treat myself tonight. I tell her I'll just come back. They switch the  pizzas, no problem. I get home and open the salad, and it's the wrong dressing, with bread with no butter. Food was overall good, but the ordering to go was a huge let down. Hopefully they get it organized."}
{"text":"We live in the Sun City Anthem area and we have Metro deliver up to us.  It's a bit more, but this pizza is SO worth it! We got the Metro pizza tonight, which has extra cheese and a thick crust.  They said it would be here in 45 min to an hour and they were here in about 40 minutes.  The pizza was hot and delicious.  We're from New York and have been looking for a good NY style pizza for a long time. Metro is one of the closest ones we've found.   Whether you eat at the restaurant or have it delivered, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Kind of strange interactions with the waitress initially but she turned out alright. Asked first person for separate checks (company paying) but she did not communicate this to the main waitress. When the main lady came (which kinda surprised me because I thought the previous lady was our main lady), she almost seemed annoyed when I reiterated the check issue, like how was she supposed to know that. I'm just thinking, I'm sorry, I told someone else, silly me, I assumed she would tell you too. Anyway, she told us she couldn't guarantee the food would come out the same time if the checks were separate. We said that was okay but you and I know that is total BS. This is 'mericuh. You can make those checks come out at the same time. That's how amazing this country is.  Here for lunch. Got the garlic knots. Gooood. Got the spring street pizza. Good. Got the nuclear fries. Man these things were addictive! Had, I'm guessing, some fine cayenne which kept making me cough but eventually got used to it. Not all that spicy but has some msg action or something making these guys gooood. Get it.   Overall, what can you say. Pretty decent food, worth the visit."}
{"text":"My guilty pleasure... PIZZA. Metro Pizza does it right. I'm more of a classic pizza guy but their Fra Diavalo pizza is amazing. If you like seafood, then this is the pizza for you. Also, you can't go wrong with the Meatball Sliders. I can't really review about the service because I honestly don't remember... the pizza is fresh on my mind. 5 Stars goes to the PIZZA!!!"}
{"text":"This place doesn't know their ass from their elbow.  Terrible experience. It was like getting a big plate of oil.  It was absolutely disgusting.  I will never go back here.  Save yourself from heart attack and save your money.  It's also over priced.  Dominoes is better than this place.  The sauce on the pizza smells like vomit."}
{"text":"Stopped in the other night to try something other than pizza.    I ordered up the 1/2 pound Angus Cheese Burger with squeal. The bacon was shredded...an interesting twist.  My GF ordered up the Ranch Chicken Salad.  It was both huge and tasty.   But what the hell am I doing talking about burgers and salads at a pizza joint?  I have yet to find something from the pizza menu I have not liked. Though  I am staying way clear of the \"Flying Piggle\" because pickles on a pizza sounds just plain wrong.  Tasty crust, tasty sauce....... a very fine pie indeed."}
{"text":"Been going here for a long time and its always been great. Service and food is always exceptional. The price is a little bit high for the 16\" and they could add a senior discount."}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza. I ordered for pick up. It was ready in the time that was estimated."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I moved to Vegas in 08. The pizzas are a little bit pricier than bigger chains (~$18 for a large cheese) but I definitely think it is worth it! They have a fun monthly calendar with specials every day of the week for random things like if you're name is Ashley you get a discount today. I always leave here satisfied!"}
{"text":"Great pizza place located inside Ellis Island Casino and Brewery. We ate here several years ago and couldn't get the pizza out of our head. They serve traditional NY style pizza here along with salads and wings.  We came on a Sunday and it was 2 for 1 large pizzas no exceptions. Since it was just 2 of us we asked if we could get 2 smalls and they said no. I thought it was a ridiculous idea for them to refuse to let us only get 1 pizza! What a waste of food. We found a group of hungry looking college kids and they graciously took the pizza off of our hands. We ordered pepperoni and sausage. The sauce is heavenly and the crust has enough chew. The only bad thing is that it gets soggy on the bottom. I didn't keep me from enjoying 3 slices. I love that it isn't too loaded with cheese so you can enjoy the pizza with out feeling totally guilty.   I totally recommend this place for cheap and late night eats when in Vegas. So much better than popular chain places."}
{"text":"So when my gf and I were in Vegas a couple weeks ago, we were craving pizza, but at the same time, didn't want to drive all the way to Henderson for Montesano's (still my favorite pizza in Vegas).  I checked out Yelp and this place popped up. I didn't realize that they're a chain until we got here. We ordered two large one topping pizza's to go. One with mushrooms and the other pepperoni, both very very good! I don't know if they have thick crust, but ours were on the thinner side.  I wasn't really paying attention, but since we were staying on the strip, their location inside Ellis Island would've been a little closer to us.   One thing about the place; our total came out to $30 bucks plus tax for two large one topping pizzas, I don't know I think that's sort of on the high side for to-go pizza."}
{"text":"We ordered a large supreme pizza. It was okay. I liked that we could substitute ingrediates without a charge. Got the garlic knots because of yelp recommendations. It was okay, nothing too special.   Took about an hour for delivery to our hotel on the strip."}
{"text":"What is the fuss about this pizza?  Maybe you have to get unusual ones to experience the nirvana claimed by others.  We got \"large extra cheese\" for the second and final time.  Based on ratings we figured we should go back.  There was not enough sauce, nor cheese (forget \"extra\") and the cheese was chewy.  The price was high, which made it the trifecta of bad pizza."}
{"text":"Ok went there on 11/25/16 at around 9pm. Looked like they were ready to close (an hour later).  We had around 45 people. GREAT service to a degree.  While I applaud the attentiveness, some of the food came out way after the rest which included a chicken salad (grilled) and a couple of fried chicken breast sandwhiches. ALL the chicken sandwhiches after taking a bite were completely RAW.  I called the manager over and she PROFUSELY appogized and informed us that when she saw our large group enter she asked the kitchen manager to stay and help, they REFUSED!! And essentially left her to hang out to dry. Metro Pizza you should find this UNACCEPTABLE and hold your kitchen manager accountable. The female manager on duty should be applauded for the way she handled it. RAW chicken can KILL people. You can call me at 661-742-9465 and we can discuss it if you want. Because of the way it was handled I'll give 3 stars."}
{"text":"My family and I tried this place recently while visiting Vegas.  We got the square pie Sicilian style pizza.  Sold!!!! I don't know what it was about this pizza but it was perfect!  Next time we're there, we will some of their other pizzas."}
{"text":"You wouldn't think that after spending the week at the 2017 Pizza Expo, that eating anymore pizza would be an option but we did! Metro Pizza delivered,  just as good as the Pro's at the show. Great service as well! Will be back next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Great pizza; love their crust and the ingredients are really fresh. The Margherita with arugula tomatoes and shaved Romano is perfect for a light meal with a beer or glass of wine. Ask for it to be made with sauce. Super friendly servers!"}
{"text":"Vegas pizza is terrible, but Metro pizza rocks.  Great staff, great food, great feeling inside (not too cramped or loud, etc).  Eat it, love it, nuff said."}
{"text":"Good, friendly, attentive service.  Generous portions.  Good pizza.  Even yummier garlic sourdough bread with real butter while I waited for my pizza.  I thought it took a little too long for my pizza to arrive but maybe that's because I was hungry, and was fighting the urge to gobble all the bread before the pizza arrived and I found myself too full to do more than taste it.  A \"small\" pizza is way too big for one person--it lasted 3 days (but no complaints about that--it was still good pizza on day three). My only complaint is that the restaurant is painfully noisy, even when I'm not having one of my hyper-acute hearing days."}
{"text":"This is a review for their food and delivery service.  I ordered their stuffed pasta pizza. Everything in it was spot on. It was not greasy, which is really common when it comes to pizza and especially with stuffed pies. It's a really thick crust that had a bit of sweet to it, something that I love in pizza. It reminds me of pizza from Northern NJ and New York City, where I'm originally from. Now as for the chicken wings. They are among the best I've had. Again, it's not greasy even with the sauce on. The wings are crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I had the mild sauce and it was pretty spot on, just enough kick to it.  Metro is a bit on the pricey end of the spectrum but you see it in the quality of the food you get. The delivery fee to my area was $3, which is average compared to all other delivery places. Really good service, had extra sauces for everything included.  I have to say that Metro is worth the extra money for the quality of food you get."}
{"text":"The food is alright, service was extremely slow and we were one of the only people in there. They ran out of some of the beers on tap. Also it was a little pricey. Not the best I've been to that's for sure."}
{"text":"I like the Metro brand, but I think they need to stick to full service restaurants and drop their counter concepts (here and Ellis Island)-- product and service are subpar, can't even compare them to the great pies available when you go to their actual restaurants. Minimal slices ready and available, disinterested service. Pizza itself was just okay, comparable to any other airport pizza place."}
{"text":"This is just good, middle of the road, run of the mill greasy pizza that absolutely hits the spot after downing a few beers at Ellis Island. Always a decent selection of pies that have spent too long under the heat lamp, the price is awesome and it will definitely satisfy your craving for a slice of pizza after losing your money in the slots! I always find myself grabbing a piece or two, not a lot of wow factor but you will never regret your decision either."}
{"text":"Use to be really good at all locations. Now it depends which location you go to. Ellis Island has a pretty good one. Thursdays and Sundays are buy on get one free. They are pretty pricey when compared to the fast food cain pizza places like Pizza Hut or Dominos.But parlor pizzas are so much better and authentic.And the flavor is great. New York Style. Horizon and Stephanie use to be really good but last few times I was not happy with them.I was wondering if they are under new management.Makes you mad when you pay $25 and its crap.havent been to Tropicana location in a long time. Hope they get it together cause they are one of my favorite pizza parlors."}
{"text":"This is my favorite location in the city.  1, because it is the one closest to my brother's house, and 2, it is just far enough away from the strip to be devoid of most tourists.  I've eaten here over a dozen times and somehow never had to wait.    I first found out about this place from my neighbor, Casey, who I owed a favor.   I asked if he wanted anything from The Vegas, and he said a loaf of bread from Metro Pizza.   It was the beginning of the end.  The crust is thick-ish, which is usually not my style, but the taste of the crust is absolutely magical.  It is the same as the bread, which is also amazing.   They give you some of this bread, toasted to perfection, while you wait for your food to come.  I haven't had a bad pizza here.  They have the option of pre-fab specialty pizzas like the New Orleans (shrimp, garlic, roma tomatoes) or the Napa Valley (white pizza with zucchini and proscuitto), or stuffed pizzas, or you can build your own (my poison of choice being pepperoni, mushrooms, and olives, extra sauce).  In addition to being a ranch lover, I am also a sauce whore.  I ask for extra sauce and they always give it to me, and it is delicious!!  I have never had anything but excellent service here, including nice chat from servers, and even once, when I was in a HUGE hurry, having them pack up three loaves of bread for me (after a short and efficient phone call) so that I was able to run in, throw my money on the counter, grab, the bag, and go.   A word of warning (and the ONLY reason this place doesn't get 5 stars), for some reason, this pizza is at its best in the restaurant.  It doesn't hold up as well as take out, and it doesn't reheat very well.  I don't know what it is about it....but it makes me sad because it is SO GOOD as dine in pizza, and I love to stretch my meals.  I'm not saying I won't take it home, reheat it, and eat it...but it really just isn't as good.   It is still some of my favorite pizza in the world, and when I am in town, I always make a stop here."}
{"text":"We ate a late lunch here. After finding a way to enter this pizza place (it was a bit confusing navigating the entrance of this place), we were rewarded with an awesome dining experience. Our waiter, Ed, introduced himself to us. He was friendly and very helpful with suggestions, since this was our first time eating here. We decided on Garlic Romano fries & Nuclear fries for appetizers, both of them were very good. The Nuclear fries had a nice heat to it, and went nicely with the ranch dressing dipping sauce (that came with both fries). We also got the Steinbrenner calzone which was very delicious. The eggplant parmigiana in it was perfectly done. Along with a large Skyline stuffed pizza, which was both tasty and very substantial, the meat sauce on it was perfectly seasoned and not overly sweet, while the crust was very good. Sauce and crust are the most important things on a pizza and they nailed them both. For desert, we had the Spumoni pie and Cannoli. Again both were very good, but we were so full by then that we had to take it to go. We highly recommend this place and waiter Ed for a great dining experience. I forgot to mention about the bread that they serve before we started to eat. It's baked on site and is delicious, but don't get carried away eating it or you're not going be able eat the rest of your food."}
{"text":"This is by far the best place for pizza in town and it is so nice inside and a very comfortable atmosphere .   They have so many different options to eat here which is great . The have beer and wine which is amazing with your pizza .   The staff is very friendly and always so helpful here when I go with my hubby . Prices are great I think . This is not a normal pizza place it is a step above the rest believe me, try it out you will not be sorry ."}
{"text":"Metro is one of the top local pizza chains in the valley, but it wasn't til their Slice Out Hunger promo that I visited this particular location. Last year, the fundraiser for Three Square was held at their Flamingo location, featured pepperoni and cheese slices, and was quite disorganized- this year, organization was on point and slices were expanded to include specialty pies!  Location is fairly large, staff were friendly, and our large group was able to reserve a table in advance for the promotion. Tickets were sold at the door at a dollar each, 5 per person, to be redeemed throughout the night for slices as available. Staff manning the slice counter were fast and friendly, and the manager chatted a bit with me about the organization and how they help out the community. I have students who personally benefit from Three Square and I'm always happy to support what they do- discounted pizza is just an added incentive.  As usual, the pies were on point. The Mulberry Street (eggplant ricotta) and Milano (white)  pizzas were probably my favorites, and the giant, pillowy square Sicilian impressed too. Unfortunately, I was unable to try their Pumpkin Spice slice, as they went quick whenever they were put out and I only had a scant half hour to pop by.   TIP: Discounts and promos available often, check their monthly menu, there's always something going on. 15% off for UNLV students with ID, too."}
{"text":"Excellent service from seating to eating. Fantastic. Perfect for family. Pizza-yum."}
{"text":"The hardest part about ordering from Metro Pizza was deciding which of the amazing-sounding dishes to order. While I was tempted by the pizza and pasta, I ultimately chose the Ranch Chicken Salad because 1) I had a heavy lunch already and 2) I read another review that raved about their ranch dressing. I'm known to be selective about my ranch so reading the review that claimed that their ranch is nothing like Hidden Valley (because that is NOT ranch...bleh!) sealed the deal. The salad was huge and plenty for two meals, if not three, for me. It's topped with chicken fingers, tomatoes, mozzarella, cucumbers and croutons and comes with a hunk of (sourdough?) bread on the side. I asked for an extra side of ranch and was so happy I did as soon as I discovered the absolute wonderfulness of the ranch. Definitely one of the better ranch dressings that I've ever tasted and I'm very thankful for the other reviewer for describing it in such a perfect way. This is true restaurant quality ranch.   My only slight complaint is that in addition to the lettuce, which is stated on the menu, the salad also included spinach. I can't stand spinach and had to created a reject pile on the side of my plate as I uncovered spinach leaves. Also, I'm not a fan of cucumbers but thought I could easily pick off the slices so I didn't make any special requests. Of course, though, in this case the cucumbers were finely diced and more difficult to remove.  Although we ordered our food to go, the restaurant looks like a charming place to eat and I'd be happy to make this a regular stop if I lived in the area."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. One night it'll be great. The next it's so-so. The Four Corners is good.  The service is great, but it's like they have more cheese than the pizza because they're begging for tips.  Definitely go on a less busy night and hope for the best. I don't know what it is, but maybe certain pizza cooks don't know what they're doing...?"}
{"text":"Pizza here used to be good, but is getting worse and worse with each day. Almost every time I order it, the crust is burned. A couple of times I had to return a pizza because the bottom was literally black. They also put too much pizza source on it, and you can't taste the other ingredients because of it. Very disappointing. My family and I will not be ordering pizza from this  place anymore."}
{"text":"I took my mom here yesterday. We were having our battery charged at the AutoZone. We asked the guy if there was a place to eat. The guy from the AutoZone recommend  Metro Pizza. This was our first time here, we ordered Fried calamari and we ordered a small Modesto 9\" pizza. We had Gabriel waited on us. It was a fantastic place! My mom & I Love this place! We will be back."}
{"text":"We love the pizza here. Only problem is they are so busy all the time. The server at our last visit forgot everything. We had to remind him several times for drinks, ranch and napkins. Overall great pizza."}
{"text":"I've had several items from the menu and it's all been good. This is a local run business. The stuffed pizzas are very good and what I'd recommend most here. They have individual pizzas ans larger ones and if you are ordering an appetizer then try the meatball sliders they are really good and the garlic knots they use for them are made fresh to order. The staff has always been friendly and attentive. Check the website or ask your server for a monthly calendar to see what specials are going on it's something different each day. inside there is a good sized dining area with tables, booths and there is a bar also. There is a door for the restaurant and for pick up orders but you can go in either one depending on what side of the building you park. If you do order garlic knots keep in mind they are best eaten fresh from the oven at the restaurant because the couple of times I ordered them to go they didn't taste the same when I got home. The pizza on the other hand tastes good even left over for lunch the next day."}
{"text":"Closest NY pizza in Vegas.  Casual friendly atmosphere, friendly staff, good food.  Never feel rushed here.  Would definitely recommend for a great casual pizza/ Italian restaurant with friends."}
{"text":"We have a big party they said they were ready for us and we confirmed that we would be there at the booked time. everything is slow and we didnt even get any water until we complained 2 times 30 mins in we received our water. Isnt that the first thing they should give us? Giving us all this bread to eat first and making us wait for water to shove it down later. Thirsty af man."}
{"text":"Meatball Sliders. That is all you need to know.   Metro Pizza still delivers great service every time I dine here.  We are always seated immediately.  The dining area is clean with plenty of seating.  There is another entrance on the far side of you are picking up your to-go order.    They bring their house made bread to your table while waiting for your meals.  Always warm and fresh.  The meatball sliders are my favorite.  They never disappoint.  The flavor is consistently great.  I realize it is a pizza joint but I'd have to say their pizza is just ok.  I will say they offer a huge variety of specialty pizzas and calzones.  Maybe I just haven't found the one pizza that wows me.  The Tuscan Salad with grilled chicken is delicious! The toppings are plentiful and filling.    Metro pizza remains my #1 choice for meatball sliders.  Great service keeps me as a returning customer."}
{"text":"Food is delicious. Price is a bit high for Italian food. Service is TERRIBLE. I've been here about 6 times and each time the service was equally as bad. You'll have about 4 waiters come to your table. You'll never know which one is actually yours. They'll ask if you need anything and then never come back with it. Seriously. I went an entire dinner with no water, missing food, food delivered for a table of 4 over 15 minutes. Had to ask for a high chair more than once every since time I've visited. I'm honestly not going to come back anymore despite the good food, because the service is such a mess."}
{"text":"Terrible $31.15 pizza. No taste other than the oregano seasoning, which I hate. If you don't like oregano don't order it. Even without oregano it is tasteless."}
{"text":"Great food! Have eaten here many times and it's always a great experience! The garlic knots and chicken fingers are my favorites. The service is always great. The entire staff is friendly and very helpful at recommending some of their favorites when we want to try something new. I always recommend metro to anyone that asks me where to get a great pizza, pasta or bar type food."}
{"text":"Placed an order for delivery and needed to repeat myself numerous times. When I got my pizza half of it was soggy because the box was wet. The pizza didn't even taste very good.  Definitely overpriced and not worth it. Won't order from here again."}
{"text":"We have been to this location many times and tonight was a train wreck. They didn't offer my son a children's menu, forgot our appetizer, forgot plates for the bread, we found plastics in the salad, way over sauced the pasta, and burnt the chicken parmigiana. When I told the waiter about the burnt food, he shrugged and said he was sorry to hear that. The manager came and took the bill and said he was going to take care of us. He took half off my son's meal, not the burnt meal.  We did not feel taken care of at all. If we ever go back, it will be a while."}
{"text":"This place is well known for their award winning pizza but of course whenever I end up dining here I order  anything but pizza.  Their lunch menu specials are great deals. The dinner size plate of the giant ravioli is enough to feed two people and even then Mr B and I still end up having to take home leftovers.  This visit was the first time in a few years since I've dined here though.  I didnt know they had Eggplant Parmesan till Daniel S. told me.  Perfect!  Since I really don't eat much breads and pasta.    The dinner version of Eggplant Parmesan came with a serving of spaghetti and a side of salad.  Pretty good size portions too for one hungry person.  I didn't know what to expect and was pleasantly surprised the Eggplant Parm was really good!  It was lightly breaded, eggplant was baked perfectly.  There was just enough marinara sauce and cheese on it.  And the seasonings were subtle.  So good that I finished it. ..but I barely touched the  pasta (good girl Shirley! ) The salad was well chilled and crisp as well.  So good to know there is an option to an almost carb free meal here. And a delicious dinner at that!"}
{"text":"Visited Metro Pizza with a group.  We ordered Lasagna and  salad.  It was delicious and family style.  ie, we had a large tray of Lasagna and a huge salad.  Both were passed around the table.  Food was delicious, service was very good.  Next time I'm back in Vegas, Metro Pizza is definitely a restaurant I'll visit."}
{"text":"The shrimp and feta calzone is delicious. I added spinach and it was huge. The mozzarella was delcious and there was plenty of cheese. The marinara was full of flavor. The bbq chicken calzone was also very good and had the right amount of red onions and sauce with chicken"}
{"text":"If I only had the chicken fingers and fries I would maybe give it a 5. Fries, chicken fingers, and ranch were good. Pepperoni pizza not that great. My boyfriend enjoyed it, I thought it tasted like vomit. This gentlemen dropping off food helped more than our server. Boyfriend doesn't like ice and of coarse she forgets and brings back drink with ice. Not a huge deal but when you're sitting on the side with all the coworkers and just talking and talking; maybe she was distracted. Who knows."}
{"text":"The hostess was very pleasant, and our server was quite attentive. Order the lunch special for $9.95. It's huge and comes with a salad and beverage. Why 3 stars? Pizza was average. Tasted a tad too bland, but fortunately not greasy. Wanted a Ceasar salad instead of a green one, and our server said it was a $1.50 up charge. I said \"for a plate of lettuce?\", and he said it was because of the Ceasar dressing. I said no thanks. He asked what type of dressing would I like on my house salad. I said Ceasar. No up charge. Huh?? Anyway, the meatball sub was quite tasty, so was the complimentary bread and butter."}
{"text":"Been going to metro pizza for over 15 years. Always great service and pizza hot and delicious. Today is Saturday at metro for there Sicilian sub."}
{"text":"Very good food when you eat in the restaurant.  Take out pizza seemed like a totally different product and was not good.  They would not turn down the loud music even when it was not busy."}
{"text":"The food is really good and the service is awesome. There is also a hot waiter that works here, so that doesn't hurt. ;)"}
{"text":"Sad pizza equals a sad customer...  Walking into this place it feels like you've stepped back into Miami Vice (its an old TV show from the 80's for the youngsters). It's fun and I appreciate that more so than places without any decorations. I'd also like to point out that service was awesome. Both the greeter and our waiter were very nice.   The pizza made me want to cry. For starters I appreciate that you can create whatever you want and we made one half of our pizza pepperoni, mushrooms and ricotta and the other half was ham, sausage and pineapples. When we went to pick up our slices, they both drooped (a lot, like half the slice). It was like eating wet and uncooked dough. Not only did that happen but the flavors weren't great either. Everything was bland. With each bite I regretted the carbs. Finished my slice and just felt sad.   So I ask myself on every sad review, what was good? My free Coke with a yelp checkin and the service. That's it and I have to say this was one of the worst pizza experiences ever."}
{"text":"YUM! Their pizza was delicious. Chewy yummy crust. We got a large pepperoni and an order of wings. I normally don't like wings from pizza places, however, these were large and delicious! We will return. I wish the price was a little more reasonable though. Our large one topper with wings was $30. I can't forget the service either. It was ready fast and the take out workers were quick and efficient, not to mention friendly."}
{"text":"Garlic balls were dry and not much taste. The pizza was way too oilily and greasy. Deliver took 40mins which is great for a deliver."}
{"text":"Didn't dine in, but rather took out and carried away. The  pizzas were great got a large meatlovers and their Hawaiian (kids love it). The price was a little high, but quality was worth it. Great ingredients and the wings were great too. I only carried out so cant give a full review here, but customer service seemed on and I could see them tossing pizza while I made my purchase. Will be fun for family. Will definitely dine in or out again."}
{"text":"I will only speak for one item on their menu and the only reason why i keep coming back to Metro Pizza every time i'm in Las Vegas....  Garlic Knots is the only word i can say when in this restaurant...  This garlic knots are like no other i ever had,   Thank You Metro Pizza for been part of my life."}
{"text":"Pretty tasty although prepare to pay exorbitant airport prices.   I got a slice of the stuffed pizza, I think it was about $7.50. It's stuffed with mushrooms, sausage, and pepperoni, and was delicious.   No line too so it didn't take long to receive my order. Metro Pizza is located in the Delta terminal (terminal D) near the end of the terminal."}
{"text":"All I wanted was some damn pizza. Tried to order it to the hotel room and they said they would not accommodate my specific order. I wanted something that they make on their menu, the Margherita pizza, but they said they would not make it for me for delivery. To which my reply was that makes no sense, you can make it and if I come down there in your store and get it I can have it but you will not deliver? They replied yes, we just won't do it for a delivery order but you can build and make your own pizza.   So wouldn't I just be able to build a margherita pizza?   Huh? What in the world? man people are idiots."}
{"text":"Food is DELICIOUS. I'll start there. But the service is sub-par. For one thing, the girl who greeted us and took us to our table...my comment to my friend was \"well she loves HER job.\" Just not friendly at all, dry, not welcoming. Then we had a waitress with a similar attitude and very little service. We saw so little of our server it was shocking. I've been here at least 1/2 a dozen times because their wings are GREAT and I like everything I've ever had, but I may have to start doing takeout and takeout ONLY. Sorry guys, but you have some work to do. Your food is great, but that's all."}
{"text":"The best tasting crust! Came for Valentine's Day and the Gotham pizza. It was shaped in a perfect heart. We had to indulge so we also ordered the garlic fries. Yum! Crispy on the outside and creamy inside!"}
{"text":"Probably the best pizza in Vegas and from New Jersey area my standards for pizza are HIGH. Anyhow the pizza gets a \"5\". However service not so much they get a \"3\". We always ordered the metro which is the extra thick crust but we also order an appetizer such as the romano fries. Pizza comes 25 minutes later because it usually takes longer due to the crust(no problem) then you realize that the fries still haven't made it and you haven't seen your server since he took the order so even drinks need tending.  I then say \"Never mind don't want the darn fries\".   This happened on several occasions where they have forgotten the appetizers but i started ordering the appetizer before ordering the pizza. Works better that way.   Overall great place and when the food isn't forgotten is beyond delicious. The constant incompetent wait staff however cost it a 5."}
{"text":"My must stop whenever I am in Vegas.  I love their pizza, it's delicious!  I have recommended it to several friends, and I always seem to get a phone call thanking me for recommending it.  The Stockyard is my favorite, if I lived in Vegas I would be much fatter because I would be here all the time."}
{"text":"The stockyard pizza is the best.....    note it is huge one slice will do you in.   Staff was so pleasant.  We enjoyed our date night.   And lots of leftover for game day today."}
{"text":"As a Chicago native I  have high expectations when it comes to pizza. Although I'm partial to a good deep dish pizza I like to explore different varieties. With that being said, if you don't have any taste buds, you enjoy the stinch of nasty carpet, and if subpar pizza is your favorite then this is the place for you.   We ordered the Metro pizza and it's supposed to come with extra cheese. If that was extra cheese then I guess regular cheese would be equivalent to a sprinkling of salt from \"Salt Bae\". The sauce tasted like tomato sauce straight from the can with ZERO Italian seasonings. Unfortunately, we were unable to finish the first slice beyond 2 bites.    The ONLY reason I gave 2 stars is because our waitress was very nice and accommodating."}
{"text":"I was pretty impressed with everything we ate here.  Stuffed pizza was huge and delicious. My margarita pizza was so fresh and light.  The dough to me makes or breaks a pizza and this dough is perfection!  Food is amazing but service is lacking.  The hostess was so unfriendly and seemed unhappy with everyone walking in.  The servers always seemed too busy to refill drinks and are always look frazzled.  When you need something they may not be found but then you see them run by frantically 15 minutes later.  We rarely tip less than 20% because my husband and I have both been servers and we get it but we had so little interaction with our grumpy server that we actually tipped him less.  We may come back for take out next time."}
{"text":"Please don't let this place be your introduction to the Metro Pizza company. It's a counter in a run-down off-strip casino, and it tastes like any other similar spot- average, thin crust, a little greasy, pretty meh cheese... nothing compared to their real locations.    They do have a menu offering a few more of Metro's dishes, but this is primarily for grab and go slices. Note that they have BOGO slice and whole pie specials on Sundays and Thursdays. Service is quick but not particularly friendly."}
{"text":"Now in the past the service has either been outstanding with friendly waiters or down right  WRONG and we had to walk out.  We sat once for 20 mins without anyone stopping to even get our drink order.  It was like we were invisible.    When you are seated they bring the bread pretty quick.  Our pet peeve is when the bread comes and no drink order yet. I think they are still working on that issue because the last time we only sat 3 minutes after the bread came before our waitress arrived.    Metro is improving on their service now since I only see one regular waitress from the past still working there and we haven't gotten the invisible treatment yet.     We usually have the house salad with their house dressing which is pretty good.  Cannot figure out why a pizza joint doesn't put mozzarella cheese on the salad.  You can ask for it but they charge more.  BBQ chicken pizza is good and ask for the garlic and oregano seasoning shakers to add more spice."}
{"text":"Yum! The sausage is to die for! Just dont make the same mistake and try to bring your 11 year old with you...no eating in the establishment if you are under 21! CHECK PLEASE!!! LOL"}
{"text":"We attended an amazing pizza making class here! We were treated to the history of pizza, incredible tips fir pizza making at home all while being fed Metro's delicious food: garlic knots, different types of pizza and dessert!! It would be a great activity for a family or party, too."}
{"text":"Decent pizza. Wish the sauce had more flavor!!!! The location is clean, stocked, and lots of seating. The salads are amazing and the bread they serve is yummy! Huge pizzas with tons of toppings!"}
{"text":"Wow.  So very embarrassed.   We had one guest over, so that made three for dinner.  Instead of getting a large, which is pricey for $25.  I had the \"good idea\" of ordering a small and a calzone to give the guest options and make more of a selection.   Well, metro only has small and large.   Otherwise known as individual for $13 or large for $25. And the calzone was laughable small as well and waterlogged and had no flavor.  We ordered the bbq chicken one.  It squirted out water and the crust was soggy. The individual pizza was very tasty and quality, but literally was less than a personal size.  It was a very good thing I had just went to Trader Joe's the day before and was able to pull out lots of apps. To make a nice cheese and app spread.  I was very embarrassed for having no food to offer and even contemplated ordering papa johns after just having paid $25 for absolutely no dinner.  But that would have made the situation even more embarrassing, so I just dropped it and added the large selection of apps."}
{"text":"I was in charge of a bachelor party and needed to get enough food to a hotel to feed 18 guys before heading out for an evening's debauchery.  I asked around town, and the results were unanimous:  Two Vegas Yelpers: \"Metro Pizza.\" Waitress at the TI pool: \"Metro Pizza.\" Cabbie: \"Metro Pizza, and then let me take you to Treasures, they got the hottest girls in town.\" Kandi at Treasures: \"Metro Pizza.\"  So I went with Metro Pizza, and it was great.  The pizzas were a little pricey but you certainly get what you pay for.  They deliver to the strip for only a small surcharge, they got the pizzas there when they said they would, and everyone was impressed with the quality of the pizza.  I'll be back in Vegas in two weeks and am definitely going to order from them again."}
{"text":"Gotham pizza, try it. Trust me. Sundays are 2-4-1."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout pizza...put on hold for 5 min on a Friday night. Had to call again to place order.  Ended up with nearly raw undercooked doughy crust, gross ground sausage with a mix of some sausage pieces and next to no cheese or sauce.  By far the worst pizza I ever ate.  Had eaten in here before and to be fair it was good. Honestly don't know if they are under new ownership or what but for now will not be back."}
{"text":"The wait was long, my sliders were cold, food was ok not great, the waiter didn't stop by our table once to see if we needed anything, skipped our table literally. Not sure what all the hoopla is all about :("}
{"text":"Large menu, great selections!  Garlic knots were tastey, and so far the Triple Play Chicago style pizza is my fav!  Not like most pizza joints that have TVs all over the place,so if you plan on watching any sports event here, dont get your hopes up too high,  i believe i only saw one TV and that was at the bar.  It also lacks any arcade games for the kids to play, i have to say that this was the first pizza place i have ever been to without an arcade, or at least one or two games!   Food is good, not the best, but good."}
{"text":"Outstanding service and good, quality pizza.  I can't get tired of this place.  Personal size pizza is enough to feed two people.  I always end up bringing home leftovers.  Prices are reasonable, too."}
{"text":"We came to Metro Pizza for a quick lunch in between classes. I ordered there $10 lunch special which includes a salad and an individual Pizza. Service was great. They brought a small, hot mini loaf of bread to the table while we waited for the salad. The bread was delicious, the salad was excellent, and the pizza was a typical Metro Pizza. Overall, accomplish what we needed to accomplish - a fast tasty lunch at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"I went to metro pizza got wings and a pizza woke up that night with severe food poisoning. I always go to metro pizza, not anymore. I know it was metro pizzas food because that was the ONLY thing I had to eat that day. Disappointed."}
{"text":"Been there many times its Good good good stuff. Yes it's greasy but so what it's good!  Best pizza I've had outside of Michigan. It always is fresh because theirs usually a line to get it at least when I've been there."}
{"text":"They bring us toasted bread to snack on, their napkins are so soft you could cuddle them, they have wondrous choices between garlic bread and garlic knots, what could make this any better? Within two minutes, they started playing our friends jam and we knew this was that one special thing called love. They even played Beautiful by James Blunt, it was like fate. It made me feel cherished. The first mouthful of pizza was like all of our questions about life had been answered and world piece had been solved. A kitten was born. A puppy got adopted. Dwayne the rock Johnson smiled. A+ guys, A+"}
{"text":"Large pizza was $16... If you go on weekdays between 2 and 4 you get half off your large pizza! The garlic Knot were a hit with our 5 kiddos! They and we all loved this pizza place and we will definitely come back! Love the yelp check in, we got a free soda which is awesome!"}
{"text":"These guys really need to step it up. This location is haggard inside and out. The service is really bad. Nobody is communicating with each other or their customers. And the food is not consistent with the other locations at all."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time last weekend and came back last night.  We have found our new favorite pizza in town.  No doubt about it!  Had a calzone the other night that was delicious and had \"The Loop\" (stuffed pizza) last night.  It was better than the calzone.  It is a little pricey but this isn't your typical take home or have delivered type of pizza.  You get what you pay for IMO.  My daughters macaroni and cheese was delicious too.  Staff is friendly and the service is prompt.  This is now our go to pizza place!"}
{"text":"I love this place! Especially this location. It brings me back to my childhood when my parents brought me here as a kid. They haven't changed any of the Decore which I absolutely love. It is very 80s still.   I ordered the lunch special number one which came with a small house salad and a small individual pizza for $9.95. The salad was actually big and their homemade Italian dressing is delicious. I also recommend the ranch dressing. The cheese pizza was perfect. Thin crispy crust with lots of cheese. They also bring hot fresh bread.  My server was great. I didn't get her name but she was super attentive and quick.   They do some really awesome specials throughout the month and giving you a promo calendar when you sit down.   Ever Tuesday they do buy one get one on different items. I believe the next one up is buy one beer get one free on the 29th.  A table next to me got a pasta dish and wings. They both looked amazing and I will have to try next time I'm in."}
{"text":"Meh. I don't understand the hype of this place.  Ordered \"nuclear\" fries.... they didn't have much flavor.  The BBQ aka \"memphis\" pizza is okay. Maybe I caught them on a bad day, but I haven't been compelled to go back."}
{"text":"*We went opening weekend* Good pizza, the service was great. Chris & Paul were great. The kitchen was a little slow but it was packed and it was opening weekend, we didn't hold it against them. Even with the kitchen being slow our service was so great we barely noticed. We will be going again."}
{"text":"Probably one of the BEST Pizza Places in Vegas and we Love all their items. You cannot go wrong eating here and their Salad dressing is to die for. Try it cause you will like it like we do."}
{"text":"For the money I just paid for supreme pizza.  I got a horrible tasting pizza.  Thin, soggy limp  crust.  tissue thin amount of toppings.  The meat was just plain flavorless hamburger.  I looks like crap.  I got charged about $24 per pizza.  They have forever lost my business.  I would of done better to get the hot and ready pizzas at Little Caesars.  What a huge disappointment.  I paid a lot for this garbage."}
{"text":"The food is good - my wife and I have been going there for five years. That being said the portion sizes seem to be smaller. Our last visit there we oredered the stockyar which was a stuffed pizza. it was good but not nearly as big as we were used to. Since we drive across town to eat here we were disappointed with the portion"}
{"text":"Not sure what the hype is all about?  This place is OK.  Nothing special.  A little over priced and inconsistent with the application of toppings.  Put this place in NY or NJ and it goes out of business in less than a year.  Sauce was ok, crust was done pretty well too.  I'll keep searching for a great Las Vegas pizza......."}
{"text":"This place can have all my money. They have the best pizza. I'm new to the area and don't have to look for any other place. If I want pizza you know where I'm going. Great salads too. Balsamic vinaigrette is on point!"}
{"text":"Positive notes: good service. Good crust Negative notes: it wasn't best pizza ever had. Would I return to this place? No"}
{"text":"Tried to celebrate our sons 19th birthday at this location on Sunday 5/15/16 around 7pm, (they don't take reservations on weekends) so we were delighted to be seated right away ( party of 6). Here's the sad part we sat for more than 20 min and not one employee would make eye contact with us! Not even a we'll be right with you! My husband even called their pick up number to let them know we were there and ready to order! Still no one showed up! Finally as we got up to leave a very rude man who claimed to be the manager just threw his hands in the air at us and made no apologies! I stopped at the from podium to ask to speak to someone else and this man who they said was the manager came over and asked me to leave because I was being rude!!  We left, called BJ'S , got a reservation! AND there pizza is so delicious and we had drinks and appetizers in 12 min's the refills flowed and our wait staff was friendly and attentive! They even made eye contact!  We live two blocks from Metro and have always felt the service was slow but not even the pizza will ever get us the put ourselves in the position of being made to feel as if we are bothering their employees! So with that said if you like being treated with respect and made to feel your money and patronage is valued don't go to Metro Pizza on Horizon Ridge! I feel sad for these employees, must be hard going to a job you hate."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely amazing! Customer service is normal amazing! Very clean all the time.  Little crowded some nights but just shows how good it is!"}
{"text":"Visiting friends in Vegas for Christmas and came here on Saturday, right after Christmas. Arrived around 6 PM and was told it would be a 20-30 minute wait.  We were seated within 15 minutes. We had ordered Calamari and Garlic knots at the bar.  Both were served with dipping sauce and very good.  No skimping on the garlic on the knots!  Calamari was perfectly cooked and flavorful. Once seated, the 4 of us shared a Domenica Salad which was also very good as well as the basket of warm bread. Out friends like the Gotham, ordered a large one.  I ordered a small, thin crust, BBQ chicken pizza.  I tried both and liked mine way better.  They didn't skimp on the toppings on the Gotham which is sort of a \"Supreme\" pizza. Service was top notch even tho the place was packed. I'd certainly go back again."}
{"text":"Not sure what is happening...is it my taste buds or what?  But the last time I was at Metro the experience just was not up to par.  The Meatball sliders that were originally so wonderful , were total crap.  I don't get how places change up their perfect recipes for not so perfect...do they not know that's how you LOSE business?  I just don't get it."}
{"text":"I was here last night and the food was ok. Salad was better than the pizza. Anyways I had left my hat at the table close to closing. When I called back the next morning the manager Evan was a total douche saying why didn't you come back last night if you knew you forgot it. He talked down to me like I was dumb. If there's a lost and found, employees should turn missing items in rather than taking it home. It's not about the hat, it's more about the policy of honest employees and an arrogant manager by the name of Evan who doesn't know how to handle a customers request."}
{"text":"Poor quality pizza made inconsistently.. sauce tatsed weird.  Some slices were very burned and dry.  This place is a mess avoid."}
{"text":"Speaking about pizza, my daughter and I went to Metro pizza last night, it's still good, But... the haven't remodeled in years since they opened in the 1990's.... It looks so junky!!  There's nothing worse the seeing a condiment table near a mop, bucket of water for cleaning tables, and baby high chairs in view when your eating.   You ask for water, you get nasty tap water on ice..   But...  Water bottles are lined up everywhere,  it looks like they are going furnished the city with water for the next drout!!  They need to remodel, if they want attract new customers!"}
{"text":"My parents have been bragging about this place.. I finally made it! With them of course.  Let's start with the good stuff... Well we ordered some sausage overload pizza OMG soooooo good..   Next our waitress.. After asking three times for plates I finally got up and stole it from a table. Not to mention her lack of personality and poor attitude.   The food... Calamari came with two different sauces no one would've guessed that if I hadn't said something. Aren't you supposed to explain to a guest what you're dropping off at the table?! My parents ordered a meat lovers pizza with thin crust... Except they brought a Hawaiian that wasn't even close to thin and the waitress argued that was the thinnest even though mine was incredibly thin. Waited ANOTHER 20 minutes for the new pizza and SHOCKER they rushed it so hard that it was undercooked and doughy. Waitress continues to argue with us and it takes a manager a good 10 minutes to come to our table to resolve this.  Long story short.. The pizza was taken off, the waitress forgot about a box for the pizza after asking multiple times and got herself a well earned tip."}
{"text":"I love Metro...their Dominica Salad is my personal favorite and I order it often. The pizza is delicious and consistent, and I always enjoy the staff at the Decatur location. I would give it 5 stars but my only complaint is that it's a little expensive. My salad is $13 and it's not a huge salad. But it is delicious that it's easy to overlook all of this."}
{"text":"The food it's great. the bread they give with your meal is yummy as well.The building is beautiful. in many ways I feel like this is a five start place. except when it comes to service. they seem to have a couple of great people and a lot of people that don't seem bought it. Because of the I don't care of can't be bothered attitude it great impacts the service.  It is sad, because I never had a bad experience at there Decatur and Flamingo location."}
{"text":"MMMmmmmmmmmmm!   FIVE STARS  I had to the large stuffed (everything?) pizza and a bbq calzone to split among six and there were left overs. The prices are good! Pitchers of beer and soda are cheap!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza's I've had to date.  We ordered a pizza from Metro after landing in our room at the MGM nearing the end of a 25hr. day.  We ordered the deep dish pepperoni pie and garlic knots.  It was so filling and I struggled to eat more than one slice.  The Garlic Knots were the best knots that I've ever had.  They were like a meal all in it's own.   My only gripe is that the delivery driver wouldn't deliver it to our room.  After 25hrs of being awake due to a delayed flight and 3rd shift job, walking down to the valet to get our pizza was the last thing we wanted to do."}
{"text":"It's a pretty solid place to go for a pizza. Not the best I've had, however neither is Starbucks but I keep coming back. The food is predictable, but not in a bad way. I come in knowing I won't be disappointed.   Tonight we went in and were seated right away. No waiting for service with a smile even on a busy Saturday night! Check plus!   The bread they served before the meal was not great. Did we get an old basket or what? Well, i guess we didn't come for the bread. Check minus. They did make it up with coming often to give fresh drinks without having to be asked.  We ordered the Gotham. Delicious and flavorful! Delavorful? Anyways, yummy! This is sort of a meat lovers with red and green peppers. The large was ginormous! Two pieces had me too full for any dessert. Absolutely will be coming in again to try the other specialty pizzas!"}
{"text":"A friend and I ordered a pie via delivery today for lunch. The estimated delivery time was an hour. To our surprise, the driver was about 15 minutes early.   The pie was delicious. Hot, fresh, with a perfect crispy crust. I love how they give you crushed red pepper to top off the pizza as well.   My only complaint would be that it was a little more greasy than I care for. However, that's nothing a napkin can't fix!   I would definitely order another pie from here when I'm in the mood! 24$ for one pizza was a little steep, but so worth it, we both are 4 slices !!!!!"}
{"text":"This is the best pizza restaurant I've ever been in Las Vegas. Good price good service and especially \"The metro pizza\" is fucking bomb. Everybody should try it out."}
{"text":"Three stars because we felt the pizzas were too expensive for our family. There was a single serve gluten free pizza as well as the other two pizzas but I would not want to spend around $70.00 again when I go to order pizza.  Our granddaughter HAS to have gluten free - she enjoyed her pizza.  Unlike the other reviewer, she was good with her gluten free pizza and did not have problems with illness from it,so that was a plus.  Our pizzas were fresh and tasty but not really outstanding.  It was a week night and we picked up the pizzas and they were ready to go when we picked them up"}
{"text":"Love Metro Pizza!! Tried the Honolulu, so good! You could see the steam off the pizza even the bread they give comes out steaming, I am a fan of their Balsamic Dressing- it's my favorite.. and that's a huge compliment cause I love a good ranch!! We went to the location on Trop, great service. I need to try there dessert! But for now I love that we fed four hungry people for under $30!! They also have pizza making classes, that would be fun!"}
{"text":"The pizza's pretty good, but OH MY GOSH THE GARLIC KNOTS! I would give those knots five stars if they were New York style (bite sized! Like popcorn!) but they are huge and I can only eat a few. They're amazing, though. They practically melt in your mouth. You just have to try one. One order, I mean. And don't share it."}
{"text":"This place is the one of the best pizza places I've ever eaten at, simply delish lol need to go back soon. I definitely would recommend this place, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"MY BIRTHDAY WAS ABSOLUTELY RUINED ON FEBRUARY 19TH, 2016. My wife asked where I would like to eat for my birthday, so I picked Metro. At approximately 2pm on Friday, I called to see if I could make a reservation and they stated they did not accept reservations...fine.  I made sure to arrive at 6:15 in order to get my name in since I did not want my elderly parents to have to wait to be seated and the hostess said the wait was around 25 minutes. My entire party sat there as they are seating table after table, then the kicker, at approximately 7:15, an hour after I arrived, a party that came in at around 7pm was seated in what seemed about 5 minutes. That is when I became extremely agitated. From across the room, the manager must have seen fire in my eyes, came across the room and said, \"You look very upset?\" I explained that my birthday was now completely ruined and that I have witnessed many, many people being seated before us and what really angered me was the party that just moseyed in and were seated in minutes. Due to my parents lack of mobility, I didn't want to hop in a car and go elsewhere, so we decided to stay.  I then questioned their reservation policy and the answer the manager gave me was absolutely preposterous. He claimed that they don't accept reservations, because they can't guarantee they can seat a party at their reservation time. I have managed MANY restaurants and that was never an issue. If you can't seat a party when they first come in at their appointed time, they have a spot for which they will be first in line. The manager looked at me with this blank look, no apology...NOTHING. I must say, the hostesses who knew they messed up by seating the other party ahead of us profusely kept saying, \"I am so sorry, I am so sorry.\" Needless to say, our server \"Nathan\" was very nice and had a great personality. Being that it was my birthday and knowing that I was not at all happy, Do you think the manager could have sent over a nice desert or done something nice? NOT A CHANCE...In fact, whoever hired that idiot used poor judgement when they hired this moron. I used to brag about this place, now, Metro Pizza can go to hell, you have lost a customer for good and that manager needs to be trained on how to manage and take care of people. He is absolutely INEPT."}
{"text":"Pizza was soooooo good! Jalapeño & pepperoni! The jalapeños were so spicy but awesome!!"}
{"text":"Ok, I am a pizza guru, and Metro has the best Americanized pizza in Vegas. No, you can not get a Pizza Napoletana here, but amazing East Coast pizza with quality ingredients. My favorite is the Bleaker Street which is sausage, garlic, and fresh basil. You can also get Chicago style, and  thick crust. My suggestion is stick to the regaular crust and you cant go wrong. Ask for some complimentary bread too, its mazing out of the oven. Metro is not cheap, but if you go there MOnday-Thirsday from 2-4, all pizzas are half off.  Also if you get the Old New York, you get fresh Mozzerella, not the shredded stuff. Classic cheese goodness!!."}
{"text":"Man, I really love this place. Today was a crazy day at Metro Pizza. We got there at 2:30 right when happy hour started not many people inside my daughter ordered a kids meal individual cheese pizza with light sauce. Me and my son ordered a large Bleecker Street which came out in about 20 minutes before my kids pizza. Myself and my son finished our slices, and my kids pizza will still not out.   Our waitress came up with a crazy excuse of the pizza cook did not time it well. So me and my son were already finished with our slices of a large pizza and my little eight-year-old still waiting for her kids meal. When the kids meal pizza came out it had extra sauce on it, so we told the waitress and then had to make her another one. This is where they should've comped The kids meal and a manager should've come over and apologize for the mishap. They didn't do anything, and it was a really weird experience. Not the type of Service I expect at Metro Pizza. I frequent this place often, and this is the first time that something like this happened. The pizza is amazing. I believe the waitress forgot to turn in her order, or the the pizza chef just forgot to make it and she came up with some stupid excuse about his timing being off. I mean how can a large pizza come out 25 minutes before an individual child's pizza? And then when it comes out it has extra sauce instead of light sauce?? Today it seems like a lot of people who are working in the kitchen or just constantly talking and not paying much attention. We got there at 2:30 and there was really no one there, so truly no excuses   ."}
{"text":"After paying $68 for a 10 oz steak at Strip Steak at the Mandalay Bay I stop several Mandalay Bay employees begging them, \"You don't pay tons for food....where do YOU eat?\"  When a number of them say, \"Metro Pizza\" I hug them and say \"THANK YOU!\"   Metro Pizza is just 2 minutes down Tropicana (okay 5, because there's always traffic) and when I saw their prices I was so excited and proud of myself for making this discovery that I almost took out a flag, stabbed the ground and declared, \"Ahhh....normalcy.\"     They even DELIVER their yummy food to your hotel too!  702-736-1955.  The owners grandparents immigrated from italy and lived 50 yards from the first pizza place in America where they were some of it's first employees.  If that's not enough to excite you, Metro Pizza takes pride serving the great traditions of America's landmark Pizzerias.  What that means to YOU?  Daily hand-made dough, cooked on stone in hearth ovens and fresh tomato sauces made from the finest picked tomatoes.   (I'm getting hungry....)  They have appetizers, speciality pizzas, stuffed pizzas, regular pizzas, east size pizzas, family size dinners and salads, the people next to me ordered this salad that came out in this gigantic bowl that looked so delicious I couldn't stop staring.  It was also had this giant ball of dough on top. I asked Thomas what it was and he said, \"That's a garlic nut.\"  I asked for a menu because I was in Vegas and my dirty mind just had to see these words in print.  The menu said, 'Garlic Knot\" and I laughed out loud.  The neighbors also noticed I was staring at their salad and brought me over a plate of their food!  I almost died of embarrassment but graciously took the offer cause I really wanted to try it!  It was their most popular salad called; The Domenica Salad.   Y U M.    The staff is amazing too.  Our waiter at the East Side Location was a guy named Thomas.  He was very busy on the night I visited, but he answered all my questions, looked me in the eye and consistently made me feel valued as a customer and fulfilled all our tables needs!    YES!  Finally, I found a place that is just like a restaurant I'd have started (if I had $ and a will to work 24/7)   The other wonderful employee I met was a girl named Janice or Janet (my kids and I argued what it was so I'm putting in both cause I've been known to be wrong) (did I really say that?).  She had long dark hair and helped me with a child that refused to move from a 15 person booth (didn't I tell you they THRIVE on families - bring in a big group and they will hold you hand and make you happy!)  My son refused to move and it was this girl that not only  tried to coax my just-woke-up-and-hate-the-world five year old back to our table but she'd come over to give me funny updates on how it was going.   My devil-child finally snapped out of it and Janice/Janet filled that table with a family of 12 two minutes later.  Bottom line:  Metro Pizza screams of family, traditions, friends, and great food.  Their menu is filed with family size portions and if it's not listed on the menu and you want it...chances are they can do it for you....with a smile.  It was soooo good, even though I was there last night and tonight, we just may be calling for delivery to our hotel room!  To Metro Pizza (if you ever see this):  Bravo!!!  You can be sure I will visit every time I come to Las Vegas"}
{"text":"Awesome! Love this place. Good food and good service. Little pricey but worth it. I usually get the gotham. The calamari and the ministrone soup is good as well."}
{"text":"Everything on their menu is astoundingly good. Best pizza in Las Vegas from the many places I have tried so far. Rosati's is a close second.   Metro's Cheese and Macaroni is rich, cheesy, rich, decadent, and RICH! There is a reason why they put the \"Cheese\" in the name first. They use all cheese and only cheese ... no fillers, and you can taste the difference.  Wow. As a self-proclaimed cheese slut, I must admit this M&C beats any other I've ever had ... so far.   Garlic Knots:  like thick, soft bread sticks, tied in a knot and smothered in garlicy butter, served with marinara ... I could easily make a meal of these alone.  Another WOW dish.  Metro Pizza is carb nirvana for this girl!"}
{"text":"A few years back, a buddy/coworker of mine introduced me to this place as being the \"Best Pizza In Town\".. So one day we ordered a whole pie for lunch. He recommended to order a Large Pizza knowing we'll have leftovers. So we got the \"The Stockyard\" aka Meat Lovers..Came with Pepperoni, Sausage and Ground Beef. That thing was Stuffed with chunks of sausage and beef! Medium sized crust not super thin nor extra thick. Overall, didn't look that oily (considering all the toppings) and was Very Tasty and Very Filling.  No Comparison with the Big Chain Pizzas Meat Lovers!  I\"ve gone to 2 other locations since (boulder and tropicana). And this is what I had:  Garlic Romano Fries: wide fries with major crumbles of garlic and parmesan cheese. These were Awesome!  Cheese Pizza Slice: Decent size (not quite as big as Costco's slices), Thin NY Style, Sauce and Dough both on the sweet side and Cheese was quality you could taste and held together (stringy type).  The Gotham: pepperoni, mushroom, suasuge, green peppers, ground beef and onions. Love the toppings, exactly what I would add on my pie (if it wasn't plain cheese or pepperoni)! Everything Quality and Amount of Toppings So Generous..   Service was fine (decatur & boulder) and Prices Fair.. Boulder location is quite small, like a shop you'd find in a foodcourt of a mall, with some tables scattered in front  of it). The Decatur location is more of a dine in restaurant outfitted with a Radical Vintage/Retro theme. So far, its been One of the Few Pizza Joints I wouldn't mind paying another visit.."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised. I've eaten at metro pizza before in town so I knew what to expect when it came to the food. When I say I was surprised it is because we went on their second day they were open and everything was spot on. Normally going in the first week a place is open you kind of have to expect slow service as they work out the kinks and get in a rhythm. This was definitely not the case here. The hostess was very nice and seated us within the wait she quoted. I can't say enough about our waitress, I wish I had gotten her name but she was amazing from start to finish! The pizzas and salads came out and they were cooked perfectly. We ordered a white pizza and a pepperoni. We will definitely be back very soon as this is only a 5 minute drive from our house."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite pizza place for about 7 years now. My family loves it BUT my review that would have absolutely started at a 5 is a 3 and that's being generous. The last time we ate there the pizza was so full on charcoal nastiness on the bottom. We were discounted and apologized for the ovens not being cleaned correctly so I gave t a slide for my favorite pizza place. The service has continually gone down in the last... eh... 1.5 years or so. Anyways this last time had me in. We decided to get delivery and we NEVER got to order. Literally answered immediately and put on hold 4 different times adding up to a total of TWENTY minutes just to order a pizza. It was ridiculous. I understand being busy but clearly you have a person near a phone since the same dang girl answered each time, stop what you're doing for 3 minutes and take a order instead of losing an order. 20 minutes of no one available for a call is a little ridiculous not to mention is was already after peak dinner time when we were trying. Step it up Metro, I'm losing all desire to show up for what was awesome food and service."}
{"text":"We stopped here based on the ratings on Yelp and we were pleased. The people were friendly and courteous. We ordered a large pepperoni pizza and Caesar salad. The meal started with fresh warm bread! The salad was big enough to feed three of us. The pizza was quite good. When we come to a Vegas again I am sure we will stop here again."}
{"text":"Waited an hour for a pick up pizza. Brought it home and it was greasy and soggy. Big disappointment. I know they were crazy busy tonight but I had hoped the hour wait would have gotten me a better quality."}
{"text":"Putting this on yelp since Metro's website has no contact link. I have been a Metro fan from the 90's and I am now a former customer.  This location has had service issues from the get go. I kept hoping it would improve but no luck.  Took my wife and son for dinner this week and as usual my son ordered a chocolate shake. We noticed he wasn't drinking it and we asked why. He said it wasn't the same as always.  Upon tasting it it was odd tasting and had dark chocolate chips in it. We asked the waiter and he said they were out of ice cream and used gelato instead.  We voiced our displeasure and he said sorry but didn't offer a refund or substitute item.  How about having some integrity and letting us know you are out of ice cream when we ordered it. Then when we voice our displeasure how about taking it off the bill. Since neither happened its time to take Metro off my regular rotation. Too bad cause I couldn't wait for this location to open. Got to big to control quality."}
{"text":"this was our first time to metro, actually by default, we had tried to go to Sammys LA pastrami but were ignored by the worker there, So, we decided to check out Metro.  We had the garlic knots...YUMMY, garlic romano fries...my kids woofed those down in 2 seconds and the stuffed pizza Skyline version.  I would've liked to have had more meat in the pizza, but it was good, didn't have any leftovers so I know the kids liked it. We will def go back to try other pizzas for sure..All in all Metro saved our family nite out dinner!!!  Good customer service too."}
{"text":"The foods a 3.66r, (for math geeks) lol. So it's been 24/7 of craziness at Otakon Vegas  anime convention. Second day I get back to my hotel around 11:30pm. I did 7 miles of walking (according my iPhone) plus the gym at planet Hollywood, so I ended up hungry once back at the hotel 8, great place to stay, right off the strip, $25.00 bucks a night right now.  The casino that it is located in ellis island, it's like the strips love child, it's a casino, but it's not really worth checking out, to be honest. I called from my hotel room, to be answered by a young man that informed me the casino doesn't have the updated menu prices. There seemed to be a lot of metro pizzas in vegas, several around the area according to google maps.   I got cheese slice, and waited for a new pie to come out. Brought it back to my room and I was very happy. Upon waiting for a new pie, I noticed the dough trays being stacked. This made me happy, having worked in a pizza/sports bar, these trays means the dough is from scratch, as well as all the other toppings.   So going off onto a tangent, pizza places like this make a lot of there toppings via prep, they slice the meat and veggies like port of subs does with a deli slices, and they bake there meat/mushrooms etc veggies,  in an fire roasted oven.   So, finally to the review of the pizza. Cheese was stringy, crust was super thin, they had garlic power, oregano, chili flakes, salt, pepper, and parmesan to top the pizza off. The ranch was home made, but again too sour creamyish. That's kinda been the trend in Vegas I have noticed.   The guy behind the counter gave me ranch for free. It's not like the best thing in the world, but I really appreciated how happy and chill the employees were."}
{"text":"Good, cheap thin crust pizza. $3 a slice and you can get a $1.50 micro brewed beer from the nearby bar. It can be hard to find a place to sit sometimes, but they've never had a problem with me using a slant top video poker machine as a table. I know some of the other reviews mention the grease. I like mushroom pizza which is rarely greasy since it is the meats, especially pepperoni, that are responsible for most of the grease. I didn't find their mushroom pizza particularly greasy. Their combo didn't look bad either, but I could see their pepperoni being on the greasy side as it is packed with huge slices of pepperoni. Still, its probably delicious."}
{"text":"I must first admit that this a review for take-out and I have yet to actually dine-in at this location.  Walking in, the decor and atmosphere were good. And all of the staff were very friendly and nice.  The food, though, was just so-so. Now, perhaps the take-out aspect of this had an adverse effect on the food. And perhaps I just ordered the wrong items (it's a pretty extensive menu for a pizza joint). Also, the fact I have lived in Chicago and NYC may have resulted in me being a Chicago-style and NYC-style pizza snob.  The Chicago stuffed pizza was just all wrong. The spinach and cheese were right, but the crust wasn't quite right and it absolutely wasn't thick enough. And then they do this strange thing where they don't put sauce on the top. Instead, you get luke warm pasta sauce on the side - choice of marinara or meat. Now though, don't get me wrong, it was a decent pie (I certainly ate enough of it). But it just wasn't quite right.  After a long internal battle between over the second pie being one of their NYC-style pizzas or the Memphis BBQ one, I opted for the Memphis. It was good, but I've had way better BBQ chicken pizzas. It was skimpy on the sauce and cheese and a little greasy.  For a side, I opted for the nuclear fries. Again, they were not what I was expecting and they were far from anything even slightly nuclear (they barely qualified as medium). And they were a little soggy, but I chalked that up to one of the unavoidable problems of take-out fries. But again, don't get me wrong, I definitely ate them and they were ok. But I doubt I'd ever order them again.  And it is all a little pricey for what you get. Two small pizzas, fries, and a side of ranch totaled $35. Which, while certainly not beyond reason, I found to be too pricey for what you get - especially when better pies cost less.  But, of course, all of that being said, I still ate it all and I would not be adverse to trying out some of their other menu items."}
{"text":"This metro pizza is not as good as the one in green valley henderson. I'm not sure what the hell happend but I could have gotten better pizza from Costco. Not happy for the pizza I got and the price I paid. I wish I stayed home and ordered domino pizza. I normally would have complained at the restaurant but I was on a date with the lady and that would have started a fight. Not sure if it's what I ordered or this restaurant it's self but a big difference between south side of vegas and north side."}
{"text":"Yum. Yum. Yum. Great staff, great food!  Will be returning again and again!!  Had the large stuffed Loop pizza... It was HUGE!"}
{"text":"Mmmm, i love this pizza....  I have read so many reviews on this place and I just don't understand.  Maybe its not the the best pizza in the world, but if I am in the area of either of the Flamingo locations you better believe that's where I am eating!  The crust is not to thin and has good flavor.  Toppings are not overwhelming nor are they MIA.  The salads are a good choice if you don't want pizza and there is plenty more to choose from too."}
{"text":"Metro makes one of my favorite pizzas, the Gotham (with Metro crust).  However, they are more often than not wrong on prep time for takeout by 15-20 minutes.  So there is a choice:  take the risk that they will actually finish on time and eat lukewarm pizza, or sit around and wait while they finish the job.  Chose the latter today.  Bad decision."}
{"text":"The pizza is decent, but they don't really take orders well. I asked for \"easy on the cheese\" & they instead put a ton of sauce & very little cheese, which made the pizza soggy & saucy. The ingredients were ok, but everything else was all wrong."}
{"text":"Poor excuse for a pizza and they sneak into your hotel and stick flyers under the door..........creepy! Don;t be a sucker and fall for this junk. Eat cardboard instead. Any other pizza place would be better. And, watch out, they charge you a delivery fee of $10 or more. Worst experience in my life was eating this tasteless, cooked improperly, rancid, disgusting pizza."}
{"text":"Seriously? A $10 delivery fee to drive 4 miles for a $20 pizza. What else is there to say. How ghetto. Choke on it."}
{"text":"I've never actually eaten IN Metro Pizza... I have always called in the order and went to pick it up or had it delivered.  -1 star: $5.00 delivery charge and a $2.00 credit card charge from over the phone!  really?!?  However, I have ordered two things from this place only: -Chicken Pasta Salad tri-color rotelli pasta, broccoli, olives w/ breaded chicken breast and their house dressing AND honey cayenne dressing.   OMG!  This is so damn good!  It's a HUGE portion and I ALWAYS get a stomach ache because I try and eat the whole thing, yes- its that good. Their homemade dressings are insane.  The honey cayenne is delicious!  -Pizza, all types the crust is perfect, cooked perfect and toppings are perfect. (can we say perfection?  haha!)  Personally, I think their prices are a little steep, but its defintely worth the splurge every once-in-a-while.  ...now I want some pizza!"}
{"text":"The Loop..... omg!!! It's huge & delicious!! The artichoke and spinach ..... delicious! I thought it would be just another pizza joint... but the atmosphere in here is very chill and relaxing. Service here .... terrific! I definitely recommend this place to any pizza lovers!"}
{"text":"Not my favorite but the pizza tastes good. I'm more of a Chicago thin pizza kind of guy."}
{"text":"I came for my birthday the pizza was delicious, but that is to be expected of Metro. However, once me and my friends were seated we were practically ignored for 10 mins before our server even looked at us. It was such a shame because he was a very attached man. I could tell it was towards the end of his shift because he was very tired looking... We ordered cheese pizza, garlic knots, and my friend ordered a personal meat pizza of some sort, and all of it was very delicious."}
{"text":"The last time I was here, it was a to go and our food was cold upon pick up because it took me a while to get there...so I decided to give it another try. This time I ordered it there  rather than phoning ahead. . When I asked the girl if I can redeem my non alcoholic beverage with a regular purchase for my yelp check in... She wasn't too familiar with yelp so she got a hold of the manager, to which he replied \" only if she drinks it here.\" Okay, what a turn off. After I received my food, I proceeded to work where I opened my pizza box, only to find a pizza, NOT made to MY order... A little puzzled because I was the only to go order and no one new came into the establishment. To make matters worse, they slice their pizza into squares.  The pizza was burnt on some edges while a ton of orange grease sat on top making it soggy and chewy on the bottom... In most cases three strikes you're out...Well, it was so bad, you just struck out after two! Game over!"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with a group of people from New York and New Jersey. I am from Chicago.  We all took John's Pizza class. Getting to sit with a group of people and truly discuss Pizza was amazing. I was moved by John's passion and emotion for his family and for pizza ! As suddenly it didn't matter where you came from and what style pizza is from your region.  During the class John brought out two different pizzas Sicilian and Margarita they were both absolutely delicious and I think they were even more delicious to me because I got to know John, the Pizza Guy. I got to know his passion I got to know that he's not in competition with any other pizza maker. The other thing that I really liked about the pizzeria this particular one on Horizon Ridge there's no 52 or 70 inch televisions! it's a family experience eating pizza is an experience it's a discussion. I will definitely be back to Metro Pizza and I will be bringing some of my deep dish friends lol Metro pizza gets 5 stars from this Italian Chicago girl"}
{"text":"My family and I occasionally come here. The waiters have always been attentive and very kind. I've only had one semi bad experience where we ordered a chicken parm sandwich and it was cold. Sometimes the wait is just a little too long for the food but they make the food right then and all the other times it's piping hot.  Small pizza was enough for me to share with hubby while he ate fingers. The chicken fingers were salty to me and I didn't prefer their fries but it wasn't bad. Pizzas here are so good! I'm a ranch connoisseur and their ranch was up yo par. Their stuffed pizzas are interesting. It's like a giant calzone pizza. Salads are good, knots are good. The only thing we haven't tried are their calzones and pastas. It is a little pricey in my opinion, but if you want yummy hot pizza check it out here."}
{"text":"I wish I could list all the things I love about metro but I don't think anyone would actually sit and read a review for hours. We've been coming here since 2002, we've been to all locations, and we have never had a bad meal or bad service. When family comes into town from San Diego, they usually meet us here...as in they don't even want to come to our house to drop their luggage off. Lately, this has us wondering, are they here to see us or are they here for the Metro Pizza?? They demand we eat here at least 2x per visit. Just the other day, my husband used the Pasta Pie (a must try) as a fantasy football trade incentive. The pizza is that powerful. The latest pizza we ordered--with the always perfect, thick metro crust, had to be the best ever. The crust was so perfect; thick but airy, crisp yet soft. After a decade of enjoying this pizza, you don't think it can actually get better. But it does. Each pizza is a masterpiece...and that's exactly how they treat it."}
{"text":"Cheap NY style pizza. About 4 bucks a slice depending on topping. Had pepperoni, pepperoni and jalapeño, spinach pizza (very garlicky but tasty).  In Ellis island Casino where people watching is a special treat. No gourmet here, but perfect for the late night munchies."}
{"text":"Sicilian pizza is amazing!  The garden salad we ordered looked like it was made three days prior!  Stay away from the salads!  I couldn't believe someone served a salad that looked like this???"}
{"text":"Love this pizza, always great staff who are friendly and helpful. I bring my family here whenever we want pizza!"}
{"text":"The pizza and the chicken wings were great. I actually don't mind the location/parking lot area and the interior is nicely decorated and spacious. The reason I have to give it 2 stars is for the bad customer service. When I went, there were ONLY about 3 other guests and yet service seemed to be frustratingly slow, despite there being about 4 waiters walking around.  It took quite a while for anyone to realize the hostess had seated us. When we did get seated, there was water spilled on our seats. I thought it was probably just a minor oversight, but when I looked around, there were also a lot of tables that hadn't been bussed/cleaned and had all the dishes laid out and piled up. I would not have cared, but after seeing the slow service and the many waiters, it was hard not to notice the lack of effort being put in. When we left the place, the tables were still never cleaned, despite the multiple waiters constantly walking by the tables, looking at them, and then walking away... From getting seated to getting our check, it was all slow."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and love love love it!! I ordered the Pantheon, it was super delish with an awesome crispy crust. I also ordered some garlic knots which were really fresh, and the New York cheesecake is to die for! Delivery was fast and the delivery guy was really polite, I will definitely be ordering from here again!!"}
{"text":"SHOP LOCAL!  If I have a choice between a corporate-owned establishment and a local business, I will pick local EVERY TIME.  Metro is a local joint.  I've been coming to Metro since moving to Vegas in 1998.  Even with the updates to the menu and the restaurant, the place is always great.  I can honestly say I've never had anything I didn't like here.  I've had everything from chicken marsala, to meatballs, to canollis, and of course nearly every type of pizza they have.  It's all great.  I like Metro so much, we even had our wedding rehearsal dinner here in 2002.    Management and staff are easy going and great to work with.  The atmosphere is nice and of course the food is top-notch.  As long as I live in Vegas, I will continue to come to Metro Pizza."}
{"text":"I'm newly moved to area and saw Metro Pizza so thought I would try. I went inside and smelled awesome. Looked like a Great place for families and kids. I ordered pizza to go and was highly disappointed when I got home. The half cheese and half pepperoni Pizza was greasy and burned. Let my pics speak for themselves. I wouldn't recommend or return."}
{"text":"Delicious, fantastic, YUM! I love Metro Pizza! My daughter and I love the lunch combo specials, they come with a drink. My favorite is the pizza and salad. I love their salad, so fresh, so yummy. They have home made dressings and I love the regular Italian and the Balsamic Vinaigrette. Simply amazing! I could drink them!   Good service, even when they are busy, and I just love the pizza. It's a little on the pricey side but it's so worth it. Keep up the good work Metro!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent, Ernest (waiter) was attentive, however the reception is terrible. Went there Sunday night at about 8:40, stood at podium for a few minutes with being acknowledged, numerous people were behind line rolling silverware, looking at us, but seemed uninterested in our presence. I took it upon myself to seat my wife and I. Ernest was very attentive and took our order. This is the first time we have returned here in a couple of months, for this very reason. The reception needs to be worked on, at least say I'll be with you in a minute or seat yourself anywhere."}
{"text":"After trying numerous places in the valley pizza parlor- this is the only place i go to and i love there Sunday and Thursday specials"}
{"text":"Normally my spot to go for pizza. Tonight was the last time I do delivery.. I ordered my pizza at 828 and finally got it at 945.. I called and the lady that does the orders said she had no record after my card has already been charged. See then finds the order and says she's not sure what happend but the driver will have it to us within 5 min .. ten min later we got our COLD pizza. Thanks alot"}
{"text":"The service was good but the pizza was meh. We had the Margherita pizza with mushrooms, truffle oil, and Alfredo sauce. The slices were saturated in sauce and floppy which made it necessary to shovel it in to my mouth. The taste was good however, and this particular pizza deviated from the well-structured slice I'm used to on campus. I'm not a pizza person, so I can't say how well this pizza holds up to most but I would come back here if it weren't out of the way."}
{"text":"The pizza tonight was nasty as hell the service was terrible in rude the pizza wasn't done and they tried to tell me was double cheese on both sides and it wasn't anywho the pizza tasted like total crap when is usually good I guess it's who makes it"}
{"text":"They served me a cardboard box with dough floating in grease... Called the manager and he said that it wasn't his fault because bacon is greasy. Not even worth the 3am delivery for drunk fellows stay away"}
{"text":"Maybe it's just me, but Metro's pizza is just OK. I am not too sure why everyone raves about it. It is good, but it's not like the best pizza I have ever had. I decided to try the lunch special #1 today, which is a personal cheese pizza, side salad and a soft drink for $9.50. The side salad was fine, it had a few slices of tomato, thinly sliced onion, and a few croutons over a bed of lettuce. I always get their house made Italian dressing on the side because that stuff is bomb. I also got a side of ranch because I like the combination of ranch and Italian on my salad, and then I use the extra ranch to dip my pizza into. The personal pizza was BIG, and much larger than what I imagined so that was a pleasant surprise. The flavor of the pizza is just meh to me. Granted I only got cheese this time, but I have tried a lot of their other pizza's before and nothing blows me away.  The service today was spotty. They only had 1 server and 1 cashier/hostess/phone person during the lunch rush, and it is very apparent that they need more help. The cashier/hostess/phone person is busy because she is trying to do 3 different jobs at one time. There are constantly people coming in to be seated, people who are leaving that need to pay, and people who are calling to place orders over the phone. It took about 5 minutes for me to be acknowledged by the hostess and taken to a table when I first arrived because she was busy doing other things. I sat down and was given a menu and some silverware. A gentleman came by and took my drink order and then I browsed the menu. In between that time, the hostess brought me out some fresh bread and butter. After a few minutes I knew what I wanted and just sat there awkwardly waiting for my server to appear. Finally after about 15 minutes, she came to my table. You could tell she was busy. I ordered and off she went. I saw her bounce from table to table all over the dining room. My food came out about 15 minutes later and it was fresh and hot. I had to hurry up and eat because my lunch hour was almost over. This meant I had to flag down my server to bring me my check which took her 5 minutes because she was busy bringing boxes and checks to other tables. Despite today's visit, I have decided I will be back to try their meatball sliders that are voted Best of Las Vegas. Hopefully the service will improve but I will post an update regardless.   Manager/Owner if you are reading this, you need more servers on at one time. I don't know if you were short handed today, 1/15/15,  but to me it is ridiculous to make 2 people run around like chickens with their heads cut off trying to please everyone. With more help, things will go smoother and I promise your customers will thank you for it, and your servers will get compensated better.   Yelp 2015 Review #13"}
{"text":"Loved the pizza, garlic nots and salad. The atmosphere could use a updo, but service was good. Price fair. Great marinara, and awesome thin crust pizza. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I tried a couple of their pizzas and I've gotta say it was  decent. It's not the best, but its worth trying. I really liked their minestrone soup, you can tell they use fresh veggies and not can veggies  when they made it.  Overall, it was ok. I'm gonna try this place one more time and try other items on the menu... Maybe I'm missing something, after all they did win best of Las Vegas for a reason."}
{"text":"Metro has happy hour between 2:30-4:30 Tues-Thurs all pizzas are half off during this time. It was a rare occasion that I happened to have a Tuesday off, so some friends and I decided to have lunch here. We ordered a large salad and a large pizza, half Honolulu and half Sunspot. They also brought warm bread and butter to the table. It was more than enough food for 3 people. The pizza was good, but sadly it was a little watery and soggy. The Honolulu comes with ham, pineapple, bacon and green pepper, and the Sunspot had chicken, artichoke, tomatoes, basil and garlic. You would think with alllll of those toppings that they would have made the pizza a little bit more well done. Nothing is more unappetizing than a pizza that is watery. I enjoyed the pizza, but it's not the best I have ever had, and the only time I would probably come back here is for happy hour."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!! Good price good pizza good kalzone. I go there everytime and enjoy good service, free bread to start with and more... I recomend on the Alfredo souce with the pizza"}
{"text":"Overall the food was good but that's about it. There was hair in our stuffed pizza, our server came back one time to fill our drinks, there was three other tables and it took us 45 minutes to get our food. After she dropped of a bill we were on our way out when she stopped us and said she gave us the wrong bill. We won't be coming back. We recommend sunset pizzeria over metro any day!"}
{"text":"Great service, food, and friendly atmosphere. Thanks Metro!!"}
{"text":"Amazing...that is all! The meatball sliders are the bomb! Pizza is delish! Sorbet and all desserts are winners!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gosh. How have I Lived in Las Vegas my entire life and never been to a Metro Pizza. My boyfriend and I got the Pantheon, which is a white pizza with a creamy garlic sauce, chicken, spinach,  and feta cheese added to it. OMG, so good. The pizza is soft, easy to eat. The flavors are amazing. I can't even believe how good it really was. The garlic nots were good too, they didn't seem fresh, seems like they're probably made in big batches and then kept warm to order, but I don't know for sure. I just know I'll definitely be back with my entire family to introduce them to the yummness as well! Our waitress was a sweetheart as well. All friendly and helpful. Great first experience"}
{"text":"Great service all the time! They offered an amazing deal that was worth lining up at 3am for! Buy one, get one free gift cards!"}
{"text":"This location has the WORST service ever! We were ignored for phone call,  even though we had been standing at the take out counter for 10 min and then treated rudely when we were served.  The food took FOREVER  to come out. I will never come back here again."}
{"text":"Im a frequent customer of metro pizza horizon ridge however the 1st time i have an issue they do nothing to resolve it and for that they lose my business. I called to order a pizza and a girl takes my order clearly she is new and tries to charge me $10 more than it is. i had to call her out and she gave me the correct number after placing me on hold. Then it took her 5 mins to input my cc number. She kept having me repeat it and putting it in wrong saying that the numbers were wrong. After 7 mins of being on the phone with his girl i asked for a mgr. an alleged manager gets on the phone doest say hi doesn't ask the issue just says whats your cc number. I give it to him and shocking it was correct he then said ok. I said is that it he said yes and  hung up. No apology no im sorry for your inconvenience nothing. Horrible customer service! No matter how good your food is if you dont have good customer service  i wish i could give this less than a star horrible and disappointing"}
{"text":"The food is unbelievable but they need to revamp the restaurant the booths are too small the cushions on the both need to be replaced so come on owner replace some things in this restaurant because you've been here too long but the food is still tremendous"}
{"text":"I hate giving 3 stars because there pizza is awesome but I ordered a clam pizza that is not supposed to be spicy and the put red pepper in the cheese. My mouth was burning which made it hard to enjoy. As I say their food is great but red pepper is something that should only be added on request."}
{"text":"This pizza is excellent quality. The sauce is so good that they use on their pizza. The garlic knots are also extremely tasty. Easily a top 3 pizza joint in the Greater Las Vegas Area, which is saying something because there are a lot of really good options these days if you are in search of good pizza. There is a reason that they have won so many of the \"Best of Las Vegas\" awards. Simply put, its VERY good."}
{"text":"It just so happened that in one weekend I visit two \"Best of Vegas\" spots, the other being Pho Kim Long. I didn't even do that on purpose. My honey likes pizza!  I ordered the chicken calzone. Lately, I've grown more and more in love with calzones. This calzone came out HUGE. The dough rose a lot, making it look like a two story calzone. It looked great, but didn't taste as great as it looked. I loved the guilt free cheese, but not really the taste of the chicken. I wish it had pepperoni instead. And the tomato slices are big. I would have preferred chunks.   I got two meals out of this. Although it wasn't fantastic, it wasn't worth throwing away. My fiancée ordered the meat lovers stuffed pizza, which he regretted. You are able to get sauce on the top or the side, but there's no pizza sauce inside. Womp womp womp. Maybe we ordered the wrong things. Or maybe we had higher expectations. Either way we left full.   As a note, they have a discount practically every day. And it's different everyday. One day it may be 25% off for military and another for teachers. The day we came in you could receive a discount for wearing tie-dye or a peace sign in honor of Woodstock. That's a pretty cool incentive to get some pizza."}
{"text":"This location of Metro Pizza is really close to our house and is great for a casual date night. Its a traditional sit down pizza restaurant, and they have tons of options to choose from. We got the garlic knots and the small Seafood Fra Diavolo pizza to share for 2, and it was plenty of food for us. We told them that we were in a rush, so they got us in and out of there in about 40 minutes. The garlic knots and pizza were tasty, and we'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Outstanding quality and service as always! The cashier was so helpful and pleasant. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Not a whole lot to say just YUM! My co-worker ordered some for work and i missed out because i was busy... he had promised me some earlier but couldnt save any  the next day we went together and he ordered a large. he had the girl split it into 2 boxes so i could take some home. it took a bit of a wait but i was very impressed, the garlic bread was awesome too very soft  hours later the pizza was still good cold! im def going back to get the full experience for myself but their food alone has earned them more business"}
{"text":"Ya, this place is good. The placemats are lots of fun if you are there with some friends. I like it because it is mainly locals, not tourists. The fried calamari is AWESOME!!!!! Sometimes they have specials like if you wear a hawaiian shirt you get 20% off. I guess you have to call and find out before you go though."}
{"text":"Good food and reasonable prices. The lunch specials are very very good. Service is on point and your food is served quickly. No complaints about anything. Great place to grab a quick bite with the family."}
{"text":"Got the old New York with pepperoni and it was great. Good sauce, tasty crust but $28 bucks is pretty steep! -a star for the price. It'd be a tough sell to spend that much for a pie in a town with so many other choices."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza good beers fun environment! Would recommend to a lot especially the wings. Zak was our server and I can't begin to express the hospitality and professionalism from this young man . He was very knowledgeable of the menus and made great recommendations! Will go again for sure."}
{"text":"The food is great. It is no wonder why this place is always packed. I would have to say that you would have to have a lot of time to eat here. You can't be in a rush or have any time constraints. It did take a while for the food to come out but it was great when it did. Our server checked on us throughtout dinner. I would definitely can me back."}
{"text":"After reading reviews of here I was excited to try Metro, well I have to say the pizza was a bit of a disappointment. I got the Gotham, because you need to taste toppings rather than just a cheese pizza. What I got was under cooked and very oily. Yes I know the meats will add oil, but to leave puddles of it on the plate, that is a no go. It actually got better after I cooked it in my oven at 350 degrees for 10 min. I have to say that I have had better from other places here in Las Vegas.  The saving grace were the meatball sliders, now those were good, and had I just ordered those this would be a better review. The knots were fresh, cooked correctly and every thing was in balance.   Over all the 2 star rating was due to the pizza, and the service I got from the person behind the counter who had to be reminded to give me my slider order with the pizza. Maybe I will try again, but not for pizza.  Oh the kicker is that wanted to charge me $15 to deliver their food to me. Be careful, since their site does not say any thing about the charges you might get hit with,"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner on a Thursday night. When we arrived, it wasn't busy at all. This is a decent pizza place to take your family. Nothing too special. The staff were super friendly and accommodating, but I'm rating a 3/5 because the service is always slooow when we eat here. Again, it was not busy when we came. There were 3 of us eating. Took about 15 min for the waiter to come to our table to get our drink order. By that time we were ready to order food, but the waiter insisted on getting the drinks first. Waited about 10 min or so for him to come back. I'd say it took an hour from the time we were seated to get our food. We're usually pretty understanding about service taking time when a place is packed. Didn't give the waiter a hard time or anything like that, but was just disappointed that everything always takes so long when we come here.   I would not recommend going here if you have plans to be somewhere afterwards."}
{"text":"I have been ordering from metro for four years now and every time I order it has gotten progressively worse. I used to think they were one of the better pizzas in Vegas, that don't say much because most pizza out here is terrible in comparison to the Brooklyn pizza I am used to.  What has totally turned me away from metro Pizza is the recent run around I had with my take out order. I ordered two dinners and two salads. The eggplant dinner was extremely greasy and burned, then when I got to the bottom of my salad there was a 6inch diameter piece of plastic at the bottom of my salad. Now having eaten most of my meal I was so sick to my stomach I vow to never eat from Metro Pizza again. When I called back to tell the manager and get a refund she was rude didn't believe me and was reluctant to give me any attention. I felt I deserved better service then this especially since I belong to their \"pizza\" club. In this club they send me coupons that are practically useless, and if I save eight pizza clippings from the mailer I can get one pizza free, if I dine-in. Now these coupons if your lucky come once a month so I have to wait about a year of eating pizzas from this crap place to get one free?? I should get one free just because metro pizza charges way too much for a regular pizza as it is. All in all, this place will never get my business again."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza place in Vegas. The thin crust is a good new York style. But I really like the metro its a thick crust pizza that will fill you with deliciousness. I also recommend the chicken finger mmmmmm gooood! Oh my wife wanted me to add get their salad and house dressing amazing."}
{"text":"Great place. We had a family reunion there. George and all the staff treated us so well. The bread and pizza was great. The service was outstanding. We were all made to feel welecomed.."}
{"text":"I had heard that this place was one of the 10 best in the country--I had to try it.  Their pies are definitely a good value as the toppings are of great quality and plentiful.  Their crust is excellent too. But to me the sauce is the third pillar of great pizza and that is where these guys are lacking."}
{"text":"I used to love this pizza but was here last Thursday just to be disappointed for the second month in a row! Pizza not"}
{"text":"Metro Pizza's pizzas are delicious. We ordered the Sunspot which is grilled chicken, garlic, marinated artichoke hearts, Roma tomatoes and basil. It was DELICIOUS.  And their service is VERY good. We were just two, but there were multiple tables of much larger tables around us. I only noticed a barely perceptible lag in our order. In many other restaurants I probably would have starved to death before even putting my order in. Kudos to Metro."}
{"text":"I had heard good things about this place...  But, I wasn't the least bit impressed.  Ordered the meatball sliders...  They were very bland...  The \"garlic romano\" fries had virtually NO garlic flavor, what-so-ever.  Caesar salad, dry.  Delmonico salad, dry.  The best part of my meal was the Coke.  Service was fair...  Yet, unimpressive.  Can't say I'll return."}
{"text":"This was the first time at this location. I normally go to the Tropicana location cause one of my friends favorite pizza and closer location for both of us. Not my all-time favorite but still big fan of Metro Pizza. The things like most about the pizza is the crust, dough, base tomato sauce use on most of the pizza, and toppings are great. I feel like everything is fresh. I have tried most of the pizzas on the menu from the Gotham and some of the calzones. Again with the calzone job well done the shell is nice golden brown, filling steaming hot from the first cut, and delicious. The diversity on the menu is fabulous that can never have the same pie twice in row. On this recovery meal (lunch) went for the Modesto Pizza with add sausage. Talk about hungry after 60miler bike ride. I literally ate the whole pie. It was awesome. The whole pie from the perfect crust not over crispy or burnt outside just right. The topping from the mushrooms, sausage, tomato, and basil all tasted fresh. Thin crust style pizza. My favorite style.   The service was excellent. They even have free non alcoholic beverage with yelp check in. I got my soda for free. yay Yelp!! He was totally on it the whole time never having empty glass, checking up making sure our lunch was great, and even order take out before we left not problem.   The location I would never know about if never went with group of friends. It right off the 215 so perfect spot on the way back from brick day or work out day at the Lake. One that am sure be back cause nothing better reload on carbs then Metro Pizza!!!"}
{"text":"When you open the menu for Metro Pizza, there is a sweet little \"story\" about Metro Pizza that takes you all the way back to 1905...   That's great and all, but I want the REAL Metro Pizza story... the one that CLEARLY starts somewhere around '85 with a BetaMax machine and lots and lots of recorded episodes of Miami Vice... or a love for AC Slater and Screech, as evident by the awesome 80s décor that hasn't been retouched since, well... the 80s.   Seriously! In all its pastel painted glory and neon finery this place is legit and a GREAT place to grub!  I ordered the Meatball Sliders - four garlic knots cut into little 'buns\" complete with meatball, melted provolone, and sauce and served with fries. I ordered my sliders with the Garlic Romano fries, crisp fries dusted in Romano cheese and minced garlic... they were delicious and I'd definitely recommend the sliders if you want something other than pizza, the meatballs were perfectly seasoned and cooked...juicy, not overdone...so good.   The BF ordered a 16\" thin crust pizza with pepperoni... oh man, the grease was literally oozing onto the plate... haha... Greasy pizza means fresh ingredients and that it's gonna taste yum! I was surprised to see him put away three slices like it was nothing. I traded a slider for a slice and gained at least 4 lbs after that meal but oh man... good stuff. We even had half a pie to take home with us!  Metro has some of the best pizza I ever did eat. Ever. It's really THAT good.   The staff is super friendly... our food was delivered piping hot and we were never without drink refills. Loves it."}
{"text":"$4.49 for ice cold pizza!! I could vaguely tell that it was delicious at one time, but not when I ate it. Bored staff with no pride."}
{"text":"Sometimes I think I would rather talk about circumcision or which is the best web browser or perhaps whether Deckard was a replicant than try to have a sane conversation about pizza.  I don't know what it is about people that makes them lose all logic and diplomacy when it comes to pizza. Say you don't like New York-style pizzas, for example, like the way some people don't like charcoal grills or folk jazz but are still respectable citizens, and it's like the entire eastern seaboard will hop on a bus to your humble opinion on the internet and burn it for heresy. It's no better with Chicagoans, either. People have *strong* opinions about pizza that tend to manifest as The One True and Only Way.  Me, I've discovered I can appreciate all styles. I thought I hated New York-style until I tried Grimaldi's. I found Chicago-style to be a hot mess until I made my own at home. Sicilian? Detroit? CPK? They all have their merits.  Metro Pizza is after my own heart in this way in that they offer several different types of pizza on both their carryout and dine-in menus. Now we all can be happy! (And take that first step toward peace, which begins with admitting that more than one type of pizza exists.) I was most encouraged by their \"Metro crust,\" a thick crust option that I hoped would take me back to, well, most of the pizza I had before moving to Las Vegas (land of the floppy and greasy slice... and that's okay... for other people).  The first time we had Metro I closed my eyes in joy. Not perfect, but so much closer than most places. Finally!  The second time, same deal, although the flaws (as I see them) seemed to interrupt my bliss more this time.   The third time... um, what happened? (But edible.)   The fourth time we threw most of two large pizzas away. (And people, I seldom walk away from any combination of bread and cheese.)  Oh, Metro.  I think everyone needs to try Metro Pizza. They are immensely popular, and if my friends are any indication, odds are you will be very pleased with what they do and how they do it.  The staff at the Decatur location is extremely friendly. They usually offer us sodas while we wait for pick-up, so I feel like a big jerkface to criticize them now. But, I write the type of reviews I want to read, and when I'm considering pizza joints, I appreciate knowing whether I can expect a thick-crust pizza with good ingredients that isn't wet or greasy.  My standard order is a cheese with mushrooms plus Metro Crust. Right away, the first time I noticed that most of the toppings were in the center of the pizza. I don't know why this happens, but I never encountered it until I moved to Las Vegas. Here I see it All. The. Time.   I also determined that, dough-wise, I loved the outer third or so of the crust, but the middle was just too soggy for me. So, a little scooching of the toppings, and I had a good pizza, albeit with a strange, wet mucky circle of dough from the center left over. The cheese tasted bright (ugh, Food Network is rubbing off on me) and wasn't rubbery, and the mushrooms were hearty and not slimy.  But, as I said, things have been downhill over the past four months. The crust became more and more undercooked, the toppings didn't taste as fresh plus they congealed more and more into the center, and everything took on a greasy feel. We're talking back-of-the-throat acid before the first slice is done.  After the third time we said, you know, maybe we were wrong. It's just not our style after all. But the other day I had a craving for a thick crust, something the local Grimaldi's doesn't do, so back we went and, like I already described, it was so bad that we actually threw the pizzas away. Pizzas that I know so many other people would love. (Along with a batch of garlic knots that could've doubled as rocks should we have wanted to end the meal with some xeriscaping.)  If I had Metro Pizza before moving to Las Vegas (after a lifetime in the midwest and south), I'd give it a two at best. (Again, with guilt for downrating such nice people.) But now that I know that this is (it seems) what pizza is *supposed* to be like for some people, I don't know what to do.   Three stars, I guess, but it's really not \"A-OK\" with me."}
{"text":"I just don't get why people think this pizza is so great! The crust is never done enough and bread is always raw-doughy inside. We have been to Metro more than once and it always seems the same. It is just below average to average pizza that is way overpriced!  I would much rather have Champion Pizza off of Gibson."}
{"text":"A great place for Pizza. The staff is friendly and good service. Consistent in food and service. Pizzas are large enough for a table of four and usually leftover carryout box."}
{"text":"Omg. The worst chicken parmigiana sub I have ever had! The chicken was like they cooked a week ago. Probably fried 10times before they served it. Trims were like tough rubber. Not enough sauce inside. It was like chewing on tree bark. Should have gone to Pizza Rock. Huge disappointment! If they can't cook right they should take it out of the menu."}
{"text":"Only two stars today, we were seated immediately. It took them 15 min to get us a waiter. Apps came out quick, we had to ask for salad dressing, it took another 15 to get our drinks. After several requests I asked about our pizza & finally got the \"two more minutes\", 10 min later we had pizza. It was a total of 45 min from the time we ordered pizza until we got it!! They didn't even ask how anything was or comp us anything for waiting. Did I mention the kids fell asleep waiting on their food!! Oh well, this will be another location coming off the list."}
{"text":"Wow...hostess was completely unprofessional. She was sitting people at tables plopping menus down and walking away without saying a word. Server was friendly and food was delicious, but to be greeted by a rude young lady was ridiculous...can't say I will be coming back anytime soon."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Las Vegas. No matter if it's a regular pizza, or a stuffed pizza, the balance of dough, cheese, and toppings is perfect. Four stars instead of five because it's pretty expensive for a pizza place."}
{"text":"They need to hire more employees, there were 8 people waiting for pickup orders with only one employee barely helping us while answering the phone at the same time.  Took over 30 minutes to even ask me my name for pickup order. Ridiculous, shouldn't have waited -- the pizza isn't even that good. I will take my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"Our food arrived late and was burned. We had to call in twice to have our orders corrected without much avail. The delivery drivers were really nice but the people on the phone weren't very helpful. A lot of the items available on the menu of the Tropicana location were not available at this one. We couldn't get their hot fries or two different varieties of pizza. We settled for a custom pizza that wasn't nearly as exciting as we had hoped & two calzones that ended up being burnt.   I've had excellent pizza from the Tropicana location, but it's still a bit expensive. I'm still giving them 3 stars because the pizza was above mediocre, delivery people were exceptionally nice and willing to bring back re-made orders and I know that the company is capable of creating delicious pizza. I'm hoping this was just an off night..."}
{"text":"The pasta is enough for two people!! The salad could be split also! I think the marinara sauce is better than the meat sauce. And as always the pizza was awesome!!"}
{"text":"Twinkle twinkle, little pizza, how I wonder what toppings you are! Came here on a quite busy Friday afternoon.   Of course, as we got seated..first things first. One blue moon please! Looked on their menu and there's honestly so many options to choose from, I promise you'll need a good 5 to 10 minutes. Ended up going for the calamari appetizer. LET ME TELL YOU...I always order calamari because I simply just LOVE it, but metro pizza's calamari portion is HUGE. I was so excited, I almost didn't bother eating my pizza. Of course it was also just my boyfriend and I, which meant that an appetizer and a large pizza was good for us two already. Ordered the large pizza, hand tossed with mushroom, pepperoni, sausage (kinda too salty), and basil. It was yummmms. My favorite part of the pizza is the cheese! Like, cheese please and thank you!   Ended up having leftovers for the next day, and pricing wasn't too bad at all! Here's a tip: if you check in on Yelp, they give you a free non alcoholic beverage!   Thank you for my leftover calamari Metro pizza! They even gave me a new marinara sauce. Yas!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed  I walked in and it kinda smelled Pizza was very greasey and that's all I tasted was grease."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a radio station contest.   My hubby is from vegas so he had heard of them to but never ventured out to try it. Near flamingo and decatur with time to spare before my doctors apt we decided to take a chance and try it. Mind you i was 6 months pregnant! Going here i was so hungry and once i walked in i could smell the aroma of homemade pizza and pasta. I was in heaven! Looking at the menu we had a hard time making a decision. We decided to go with an app [buffalo wings] and a pizzza pie [it had sausage, mushrooms, and pepperoni inside] and a side of french fries. the service was great. waitress was friendly and explained the biggest hits on her menu.   The bus boy was great at refilling our drinks and they were never empty. i loved that. food came quicker than i thought since they did have a good amount of people there for a [monday] lunch hour.   The wings were delish and i could not get enough of them. The fries were a little to salty for my liking... but then again i grew up with a mom who never allowed us to use salt plus i was pregnant and my taste buds didnt like salt too much. Lastly the pizza pie was huge! def enough for atleast 4 people. we had sooo many left overs. i swear when i went to the doctor i had gained atleast 10 pounds.   we shall be back because the food was very good. very much reminded me of my hometown in cali where the pizza has lots of toppings and tastes homemade.  Great thing about this place is their are all about specials. Lunch specials. Specials on their calenders for every day (i.e on may 2nd if your names jacob you get a free pizza lmao. they also give half priced pizzas to those who dine in monday thru thurs from 3-5pm"}
{"text":"If I could give the Decatur store in NW Vegas a negative number, I would. We used Door Dash to deliver a pizza. The order stated a gluten-free requirement. According to Metro, it was not mentioned when Door Dash placed the order with Metro. Maybe yes, maybe no...not my fault. The person that answered the phone at Metro was clearly concerned and tried to help. The managers (heard one in the background and got transferred to someone entirely different) said it wasn't their fault and there was nothing they WOULD do about it. What's a pizza really cost to make...a few bucks? How much would it mean to a hungry customer that often went to Metro Pizzas in the Vegas area and took others as well? Apparently a small gluten-free pizza and driving it to my home 2.5 miles away costs more than me never going again and steering neighbors and friends away from that location from now on. What ever happened to taking care of inexpensive problems that reflect badly on your brand?"}
{"text":"We went to the decater/flamingo location tonight. We ordered half modesto and half Gotham with a small side salad. The salad was huge for the price and the house italian dressing was very good.  The pizza was soooo tastey. The cheese was not salty,the toppings were fresh, the crust was chewy and perfectly cooked, and it had just the right amount of sauce. The service was phenomenal, like how old vegas was 20 years ago. We have gone to soooo many pizza joints in vegas, and have always felt like something was off. We left Metro pizza with a big smile on our faces, and we couldn't wait to go home and share our left overs with our neighbors."}
{"text":"Ok the service does really suck here, the pizza might be the best in Vegas. Sauce and crust are just right and the ingredients are always fresh."}
{"text":"Great pizza, friendly staff, clean restaurant, and reasonable prices.  What more could you want?  The best times to come by are for weekday lunch specials (11-2, I think) and happy hour (2:30-4:30).  Lunch specials come with a drink (and are enough food to share, in some cases), while happy hour = half price pizzas.  Do: try the buffalo chicken pizza, Modesto, Skyline, meatball sub, baked ziti, and artichoke spinach dip.  Do: ask for Maria or Hugo.  They're the best!  Don't: come here in a rush; they can get a bit bogged down at peak volume.  Happy eating!"}
{"text":"really? After being placed on hold for 7 minutes, someone picks up the phone listens without saying a word then hangs up... now after 40 tries and 23 minutes later their line is busy! ONE STAR JUST FOR THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WE JUST RECEIVED!"}
{"text":"On my hunt for a delicious pizza spot near my apartment, I stumbled upon Metro Pizza. I have been here twice-- once to eat there and the other time for pick up. My first time there was alright. We were seated at a table immediately but the service was rather slow. I remember sitting there in this huge dining room with maybe two other groups who were already done eating. We ordered a large pizza (might as well!) and rigatoni with meat sauce to give ourselves a carb coma that none of us would be able to forget. We also had garlic rolls at our table. The salads were okay, nothing too special.   The best thing about Metro Pizza was the portions! I like how a large pizza is a large pizza. The prices were also not too shabby. I also like their gelato selection! Swoon! When I came back the second time for a take out order, I was able to grab a scoop of gelato as I waited for my food to be ready. I might just have to come back here for gelato cravings. Delish!  The customer service was nothing too exciting. The person who took my take out order the first time was amazing! She was both cheerful and helpful when I had questions about ordering. The service I had during my dining in experience could have been better. We had dinner for about two hours and it was not because we eat slow. Haha."}
{"text":"It was my 1st time at this location and I wasn't very impressed. Service and food quality is not what I recall from my previous visits to Metro Pizza at other locations. It was a slow Sunday night when I walked in and everything seemed disorganized from the hostess to the wait staff, although my order and tab was correct. I sat down and placed a beer order, then waited, received the beer and proceeded to order food: meatball sliders. Then I sat around for 10-15 min just playing on my phone, starving and wondering why they hadn't brought over a bread basket. Eventually the bread arrived before I asked about it, but I barely had a couple bites when my food arrived. The sliders were good overall but the buns seemed over toasted and were super hard. 1 of the top buns even looked charred and burnt...this is not how I remember it from previous experience. The buns were so hard that I had to be very careful eating it, worrying that my teeth or brackets would bust off trying to finish my meal. I'm hoping it was just an off night here because I used to be a big fan of Metro. Maybe next time I'll stick with the pizza."}
{"text":"Their prices are pretty fair and the portions are huge. But it isn't really the best pizza in town and they have a few items that just tasted a bit bland (Pasta Pie)."}
{"text":"Great pizza place.  Come here with a group and you will be happy!! Top notch pizza and salad. Good beers on tap too. Quality of food warrants higher price. Cheap compared to strip and only 1.5 miles from mgm grand on Tropicana."}
{"text":"Metro Pizza is one of my favorite pizzas in Vegas I've had them here and at the various locations.  I always joke about that you can't screw up making a good pizza but I've had people screw even that up.  Metro Pizza has never served me a bad pizza.   You can order the usual pepperoni, cheese, mushroom, sausage, etc. They are delicious and huge. But you can also order the stockyard. You say what exactly is a stockyard!? It's only a stuffed pizza. A stuffed pizza on steroids. Eat it with a knife and fork or just pick it up and stuff it into your mouth. You can eat a slice but can you eat another or maybe another after that? Don't forget the baseball sized garlic knots and desserts like cheese cake, tiramisu, and cannoli.   It's located in a shopping center on Flamingo and Decatur next to a Food4Less grocery store and Makino restaurant. Though it's spacious it does get busy. Also the interior is straight from the 80's in it's fluorescent colors kind of reminds me like The Max in Saved by the Bell but older notice the water stains. Customer service has been fast and friendly. I don't frequently go to this location but they all service excellent food."}
{"text":"Well, well!  In have been eating a lot of Las Vegas pizza over the past few months - kind of on a kick to find my own private pizza Idaho, someplace to call my own that just so happens to serve great pizza.  Just when I found a pizza I somewhat liked in my 'hood - along comes Metro to blow that pizza out of the water (it's always all about the water isn't it?).  My friend had just received some upsetting news and our proposed lunch date venue was far too public to speak frankly - so I decided to order a pizza and salad in. I have worked within two blocks of this Metro Pizza for over two years - and never stepped foot in the door.  As usual - Yelpers saved the day and convinced me to give it a whirl.  I ordered the ultra-thin Margherita pizza and a large dinner salad to split.  Although they were swamped - the pizza was ready on time and the service was terrific when I picked it up.    Let me tell you - this is BY FAR the best pizza I've found in Las Vegas.  The crust was thin, but toothsome and crunchy at the edges - the sauce was flavorful and fresh.  Perfect pizza. End of story.  These guys really love pizza - they even have offer 3 hour classes are the second and last Tuesday of each month if you want to learn how to make your own!"}
{"text":"Metro Pizza has turned into one of my family's favorite places to eat. We're now regulars here, thanks to the food and great service"}
{"text":"The best thing about metro pizza is that they are always open when I'm rushing back to the airport.  I usually am super hungry once I get to the gate in Vegas and metro pizza delivers my cure to my hunger. This time, at 1 am, on New Years morning, they delivered again. They had equivalent of one full pizza, about 6 large slices and a few pizzas in the oven. I chose the 2 pieces of Bbq chicken pizza. It was little over cooked so the crust was really crispy and made my jaw little sore. But the taste was good and it satisfied my hunger. Another thing I liked was the manager got a customer who was allergic to pork and he made a whole vegetable pizza for him from scratch so the guy could eat something. I thought that was really cool especially when they were trying to close."}
{"text":"Should have look for the reviews first but always wanted to give Metro Pizza a try.......what a waste of money. $23 for a 16\" pepperoni mushroom.....not even close to good   Dominos is much better so save your money"}
{"text":"Update now I'm sure we will never be having Metro Pizza again. Last night we ordered for pick up. We called early it was Monday night football so we figured they would be busy. Let me begin by saying take out service and the salad are the only reasons to give even one star. I'm in my fifties so I have had my fair share of pizza. My husband and I got to play a game with our pizza where's the cheese. I had a slice where i could not find a shred of cheese lots and lots of sauce it was very very red. It had less cheese then the 1.25 frozen Tontino's pizza. We ordered wings eh not great just OK. I did not get a copy of my receipt did not notice till my husband asked how much I paid for the worst laughable pizza we have ever eaten. (Or not eaten) My recommendation do not leave the pick up area without opening the box to see if you have cheese on your pizza at 22.00 for a pizza it should have some cheese.  Save some dough frozen beats this any day."}
{"text":"The food was great as usual. However, the service at this particular location has gone way downhill. I feel bad for having to put that fact on here, as we have been dedicated Metro customers since back when the we're New York pizza. The last three visits have been poor. But after today's lunch, I feel compelled to let \" the pizza guys\" know the service is below their standards.  There was no hostess to greet us, bread wasn't brought out till the food, my husband never got his dinner salad that came with his pasta dish, I had to ask for ranch 3 times for my chicken fingers and my daughter in laws pizza came out after we all had our food and was not very warm.  All that for approximately  46.00.... very very disappointed with the Horizon Ridge location. Won't be returning till they are better staffed with waiters , waitresses, hosts, & a manager that give us that great service we remember Metro having."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now. The first time I went the service was mediocre but the food was good. My second time my server (I think her name was Courtney) was great and the food was very good.   We ordered hot wings and pizza and ate every last bite. I also grabbed gelato as we were walking out and it was fantastic! I sampled all of them (of course), but my favorites were the classic spumoni and the strawberry. I will be back!"}
{"text":"One of the better pizza joints in Vegas. I have come to this location multiple times. It doesn't hurt that it's in my hoood either. Defnitely something I would recommend going to at least once.   Right when you walk in you get that old school diners feeling. The service here is generaly really good. The most recent time I had come here, my server was friendly until she walked away from my table. She walked back to the cooking/cashier area she started to complain about my table. Not cool. She might of been having a bad day.   Besides that the pizza is good and they have awesome lunch specials and deals everday of the month. I would recommend any of the specialty pizzas. You cannot go wrong there. Half off pizzas M-TH 2:30-4:30 or somewhere around that time."}
{"text":"Don't get me wrong! The food is wonderful but....Do not ever try to use Door Dash it is the second worst experience you will ever have at Metro. The worst experience is to call them to place an order. You will undoubtedly get an adolescent teenage girl who will leave you on hold for 10 minutes, treat you like you are a door mat and not take your order correctly when she does answer the phone. Metro you fail miserably....shame on you for the reprehensible customer service. Nick and Lena S."}
{"text":"Love Metro Pizza's Tropicana location.  We have come to expect exceptional food and service from Metro.  This location hardly resembles Metro.  The garlic knots are half the size and overcooked.  The service at this location was horrible.  The only person that seemed to be actually working was the bus person.  I will not return to this location.  Will drive the extra distance to Tropicana."}
{"text":"Its open late n I love eating late!! Good pizza very different definitely  coming back soon!! Service was good server was nice enough to answer all the questions I had n I had a lot."}
{"text":"The pizza tastes great, in fact one of the best in Vegas, but to get a delivery only 7 minutes away is a $15 delivery fee.  I mapped it and it was only 7 miles distance.  The pizza is $18 for a cheese,and $15 delivery fee, then they tax it all.  So you are looking at $35 for a pizza!   this is exhorbitant in my opinion. I delivered pizza for years and there was never a delivery fee then (in the mid- 90s.)  People today are lazy and spoiled."}
{"text":"The final star was deducted due to location.. I know, I know.. but after have a fantastic meal it's kind of hard to run (should you need to) from any unsavory characters that might be following you around in the parking lot. Neighborhood is not so hot.  Location aside lets talk about my experience. My friend had it right when she said the ambiance reminded her of being on Saved by the Bell. Bright neon lights, black and white checkered flooring, good thing the 90's look is back in.  Being a fan of all things retro (and sad to say that I can refer to the 90's now as being retro), I enjoyed the cheesy decor.  Service was fantastic, we were celebrating a birthday and had a large party but were seated right away and had stellar service the entire time.   The food equals delicious!  Soo... I'm doing the not eating fattening foods thing (again) so I ended up ordering their Dominica (sp?) salad while everyone else indulged in pizza *insert sad face here*.  Guess what?! I am a picky salad person and I can honestly say this was one of my favorite salads of all time!  Fresh ingredients and delicious dressing (I went with their house dressing), and excellent portion size.  I did snag a bit of the pizza crust from one of my fellow diners, it was crunchy and delicious and no doubts about it, should I have a hankering for a tasty slice of pie I would venture back to Metro Pizza without a second though (shady neighborhood and all)."}
{"text":"Unique pizza options and very yummy bread. This place is casual, but goes beyond the standard fluffy pizza dough and cheese. Personally I am a think crust person so they had enough simple options for me. Overall very satisfied."}
{"text":"Pizza is great. Service okay. However I have a lot of problems with this place.   My favorite is the Modesto. Get the metro crust every time on any pizza. It's thick and doughy and is soooo cheesy. If you get a beer get a bigger one because it always seems to run out and I'm left without a drink until the end of my meal. Most times the waiter doesn't come back until it's too late.   I do not like the other people who come here. Whether it's a bunch of bro dudes, obnoxiously loud laughing people (one time people even had the nerve to talk about us in the very next booth), large parties of children. Many times I just order take out.  The major problem I have with this place is when I try to take advantage of their special offers. Many times it's the reason I'm there. Like one time my husband won on a trivia question on the fb page. But they didn't offer him the prize. We messaged them and they never replied. Not cool. Another time, Black Friday, they offered gift cards at a reduced price. They had run out, but took our info. We never heard. We not only called them a week later, but also sent them a message on fb. No information, no reply. We even saw them advertising that they had gift cards again. RAGE. Finally, weeks later they called us.   Personally, I go when it's slower or when I don't want to drive all the way to my favorite pizza places. MMmmm, metro crust."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas, though the delivery charge is pretty expensive depending where you live"}
{"text":"Ok, here goes! The pizza is always great, especially the Specialty Pizzas like the Chicken Wing one. It is a very family friendly atmosphere which is great for us and our children! Most of the time and I do only say most of the time, the wait staff is excellent! Our last couple of visits during their half price pizza periods (I think it's like 2:30-4:30), we have not had the best of service. We will order and then it seems like we wait and wait and wait. Neither of these times it has been busy when we were there so there really was no need for us to have had to wait so long. It was the same waitress both times and she was not that attentive. Most times, even when busy, the service is excellent and the wait is not too bad. We will continue to go because we really do enjoy it overall."}
{"text":"Food was great as always, ice tea was horrible it tasted like day one tea. We come here a lot never have bad tea. So we asked waitress maybe get some tea from bar, was advised that all the tea is the same. So we got water, would of been 5 stars with some good tea."}
{"text":"The service here is prompt, since there is no line.  $5.29 is not a competitive price for a small water."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Love to get delivery. Best pizza I have found since NY. Great staff very friendly. Try their sausage, AMAZING. You wont be disappointed."}
{"text":"Great pizza but the service was awful.I understand it was busy but a simple\" hi sorry we are busy we will be with as soon as we can\" would have sufficed!I watched 2 tables get up and leave due to being ignored.Had I not promised my little girl metro pizza we would of done the same.Being busy doesn't excuse poor customer service."}
{"text":"Good place for pizza my server George was great very attentive I had the BBQ chicken pizza not bad but  Bistro pizza  BBQ chicken pizza was better  but is a much smaller place and might not be good for large group's ,  the inside is much nicer than bistro pizza , metro is priced slightly higher then other comparable pizzerias overall I would recommend"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza spot in Las Vegas. I tried it for the first time last night. I highly recommend the garlic knots!"}
{"text":"By far, the best pizza in town! If you like a thick crust and cheese, order the Metro Style and you won't be disappointed. The spinach and artichoke dip is delicious and creamy. Recommend the garlic knots with their full of flavor marinara.  The ingredients are fresh, portions are generous, and the service always superb!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Service is always great, all the staff is super friendly and they always remember you..."}
{"text":"I was expecting the best pizza place in town to have all 5 star reviews. Shame on you guys for not giving them all 5 stars. Great service, pipin' hot pizzas, great salads and french fries, and their house brews are pretty good too. You can not go wrong here with so many great pizzas offered. Thanks Metro you are the greatest!"}
{"text":"Good pizza best pizza in town, deliver is good and the staff the best guys love I'll definitely come back"}
{"text":"Metro Pizza in general does above average pizza and Italian food.  There is however a reason that they stand out above the rest.  Stuffed Pizza!  Not some lame stuffed-crust gimmick or anything like that.  They do some of the better Chicago style stuffed pizza in Las Vegas.  They wouldn't quite be able to hang with the big boys in the Windy City, but their \"Southside\" is more than a solid choice in Vegas!  They also have some good lunch deals and wonderful calendar specials."}
{"text":"I don't know what it is -- but Metro Pizza is inconsistent. I ate at the Henderson location recently, and it was almost inedible. Because the pizza was underdone, the crust was doughy and the toppings were a little raw.   Just two weeks prior, I went to the location on Tropicana. The same Gotham pizza was so much better. Maybe the ovens are different, or perhaps the Tropicana location cooked it longer.   Service is always average at these restaurants. Prices are a little high for pizza- but can be worth it at times.  Bottom line, I would give this restaurant 3 stars for its inconsistency among locations.    Drive past the Henderson location -- and go to the one on Tropicana.  You won't regret it......"}
{"text":"I hadn't visited a Metro Pizza in years. It was once my go to pizza place, because of the phenomenal pizza and especially, the salad dressing. A few years ago, my husband and I went in for lunch, got seated and waited 25 mins for a server to talk to us. Never happened, so we left. Based on that experience we never went back, because my husband wasn't having it.   Well, finally got him to give it another shot. What a disappointment. Ordered the baked ziti. Got a microwaved plate of crusty cheese and crunchy ziti. Our friends who were with us, ordered a pizza and I stole a slice because dammit I was hungry. The pizza wasn't any better! Tasted like really cheap cardboard! What happened to this place? It used to be so great. It makes me really sad how downhill the food has gone. The only reason it's even getting one star is for the salad house italian dressing. Shame.."}
{"text":"Crazy inconsistent.  I just don't get all the love for Metro Pizza.  It's not much better than a Pizza Hut or Dominos.  Heck it can be worse on a bad day.  I ordered a Triple Play and it is supposedly a southside Chicago style squares pizza.  It was loaded with a bland terrible tasting chewy sausage that was almost inedible.   They didn't know how to cut a squares pizza.  It had sliver slices, wedge slices, uncut slices, crisscrossing slices, and not a square in sight.  The crust was just the same crappy crust you get on a regular pizza.  Instead of having hundreds of \"different\" choices, they need to focus on a couple of things and do them well."}
{"text":"Love this place. Garlic knot meatball sliders are the bomb. Pizza can be a little greasy depending on the toppings, but always very good."}
{"text":"I love this pizza! I usually go there during lunch and get their special - a personal pan pizza, salad, and a drink for under $10. It's a great deal because I always have enough pizza leftover for at least one more meal. I also like how they have the daily specials calendar as your placemat. The only downside is all the name day specials are too common of names. Probably won't ever see mine.  Definitely would recommend this place."}
{"text":"The place is everything u love. Its clean omg the food is wonderful. The staff are wonderful 5 stars plus 1,000 more stars."}
{"text":"The pizza is really greasy, I filled 3 napkins full of grease before I could take a bite of it.   Fast service and easy, $4 for a slice and $4 for a drink (check in offer gets you that free though!) and good for a quick belly fill before a flight."}
{"text":"They Dont follow the same lunch specials that are on their website and don't even have garlic fries, which would probably be the only gluten free thing in the airport or in section D. What is the pony of having the website on the yelp page?"}
{"text":"I came here previously and my girlfriend raves this place but I wasn't so happy with it. The place is run down but we live to far to go to the Henderson location. First off the prices are very high and they don't even have a medium it's either big or tiny. Second we called to order over the phone 15 minutes before we arrived to make sure they had it ready when we arrived. We ordered a large half cheese half Gotham with no ground meat and extra sausage. We got there and we paid for the order and it took over 15 more minutes for them to cook our pizza. The customer service was extremely poor when we were there. They were not busy but took forever to get my order to me.  When we returned home we had the pizza and the crust was SO thin that the pizza broke apart. The crust underneath was burnt .   My girlfriend still raves this place but I still am not sure. Maybe if they get better faster service !"}
{"text":"Food was bad, service was bad. Definitely not best pizza like they advertise. Pasta was Terrible! Don't order the fettucini!"}
{"text":"Food is always good. If you come in on the right day (check the calendar), they might be doing free nuclear fries (very good) or free canolis (also very yummy). It's good for dates or for large groups. Really it's just always good."}
{"text":"No roasted red peppers? This place has gone down the tubes- like all good things in Vegas. I've been a patron of Metro for a few decades and the sauce must've changed because it was disgusting and unoriginal- it now tasted different. The Spring Street pizza stated roasted peppers as an ingredient- but I never imagined they'd be green because they never were before. When brought to the server's attention, even he wasn't aware because he went back to ask, I'm guessing the kitchen- or pretended to go ask- but returned and said they longer use red peppers... What? A pizza place no longer serving roasted red peppers? He wasn't even empathic to our disappointment. And to add to the bad experience, their own brand of draft beer is gross. With all the other pizza options and specialty draft brews around, Metro has officially lost two customers due to the poor quality of food and service. Good riddance."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas in Las Vegas!! Thick fluffy crust, tons of cheese, meatball pizza is GREAT! Lots of desserts, Tiramisu, Giant Chocolate Cake, and Gelatos. Daily specials. I really can't say enough about this place. I LOVE it!"}
{"text":"The pizza is decent enough... better than chain delivery like Papa John and Pizza Hut but expensive. Not a fan of the 10 minute hold time before they take my order by phone though."}
{"text":"We've ordered take out from this place 4 times since moving to the area. The first two times were ok at best.  The last two times were bad. The pizza was so soggy you couldn't even pick it up.  It flopped right over and all the toppings slid off. It was almost like it had been dipped in water!   We also tried the calamari and wow. They didn't even bother to cut most of it up. They just battered some whole squids and put them through a grease bath. They were impossible to eat. There WERE some cut pieces that we could eat but they were the same;  greasy, wilted, cold and gross. The batter didn't even seem to be cooked all the way through.  There were still whiteish, uncooked batter splotches that were just dripping grease.  Anyway. I'd ask for my money back but I think I'd rather just never order from this place again. We gave them a fair shot as newbies to the area who could be regular customers, but they blew it."}
{"text":"I have loved Metro for years, was recently released from hospital, Metro on Horizon Ridge was my first stop. So disappointed. My server was an older gentleman with a pony tail. Barely spoke to me, quickly took order then disappeared. The hit bread I love so much was never brought. I think he was way too interested in a loud conversation he was having with his co-workers right behind me. Never came to refill my soda, and had to wait 10 minutes for my check.  Frankly, I had better service sat St. Rose Hospital."}
{"text":"Went here on a Wednesday afternoon.  The waiter was nice, but never told us his name.  We ordered a large hand tossed pepperoni pizza and two dinner salads.  When the pizza was served it was cut but NOT served onto our plates.  Usually, when we go to pizza restaurants the first piece is always served.  The food was not bad, but the service was pretty slow.  Throughout our meal dirty dishes continued to stack up on the table.  Then after we finished eating the dirty dishes remained on our table for another 20-30 mins while we waited and ate dessert.  I don't think I will return to eat there again.  Service all around needs improvement!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Las Vegas, I always stop by Metro Pizza at least once! They are AWESOME!!!  The last time we were here, we ordered their meatball sliders with garlic romano fries, and a large pizza (half flying piggle, half buffalo chicken w/ blue cheese) they first served us some delicious bread with butter, and not long after, our meatball sliders. All of the food was delicious!  regarding food, I've liked everything that we've ever ordered from the first time we've visited up 'til the last, and I'm looking forward to our next trip to Vegas for their pizza! ( you can't go wrong with their pizza!)  things you should try: appetizers:      meatball sliders      nuclear fries      garlic romano fries pizzas:      the flying piggle      Buffalo      the Gotham      Memphis       tip: make sure you check their calendar on their website for discounts!  http://www.metropizza.com/calendar"}
{"text":"I didn't order any food, just stopped in here to check the place out and have a drink. I was in here on Nov 1st, opening day. They were still working out some kinks but the place was busy and it seemed like a good atmosphere. The patrons were happy and the staff was enthusiastic about the opening. I will be back to sample some grub and have another brew next time I'm out that way."}
{"text":"This will be a short review. The best pizza in Las Vegas. Hands down!"}
{"text":"We didn't try this place for 9 1/2 years so yesterday we went and the pizza was just not all that great still. There is no flavor to the cheese they use. Bambino's on west Sahara is superior to this place.  They must be using cheap cheese as the other place I mentioned does have a lot of good flavor with the cheese they use.  Overpriced for what you pay for and many years ago it used to be good."}
{"text":"Having spent my early 20's around the UNLV area, I was pretty familiar with the metro Pizza around campus.  So I was pretty excited to see one open up on the Northwest side of Vegas.  Here is the deal though ... Things that seems amazing from college tend to fall short when stacked up against other options, Metro Pizza is in that boat.  When I was in college it was pretty damn good and one of the better pizzas around, at least I thought so.  Now it's just average.  I am a fan of the nuke fries and garlic knots though.  Those withstood the post college taste test.  The pizza on the other hand is just okay."}
{"text":"Love this pizza!  The garlic knots are also super delicious.  I used to travel to Vegas a few times a year for work and I made sure to always go at least once while I was in town.  Gone for lunch and dinner, and never had a bad experience.  I have only ever had the pepperoni pizza and garlic knots, so I cannot say anything about the rest of their food, but what I have had is top notch!"}
{"text":"Great Pizza, good salad, excellent dressing and fairly quick delivery time.  Lost 1 star because we got a house salad and asked for a few olives on it and they charged us $2.00 ( a little prices for pre sliced black olives)"}
{"text":"This meal was very good. Their garlic fries were the perfect combination garlic and parmesan cheese. Nothing was overpowering just good.  The calamari was a bit thin, but the breading and dipping sauce was spot on.  I had the Honolulu pizza which was piled high with pineapple,ham, and green onions. It was the best pizza i have had in a while."}
{"text":"Success has gone to its head. In the past the steep prices were worth it, the pizza was excellent. Now after much notoriety the crowds have caused this one time gem to become complacent with regards to its quality and service. The other night was the final chance for us and Metro Pizza. We placed a take out order for the \"Metro\" and arrived 40 minutes later (time as quoted) to pick it up. The pizza was burnt badly and they had tried to cut off the burnt sections, in fact many slices had no crust at all. When brought to his attention, the manager did offer to remake the pizza (we'd wait another 30-40 minutes for it),  and when pressed he offered a free 2 liter of soda. We left with our burnt pizza (no pizza is worth a total wait of 80 minutes) and something to wash it down with. Considering the Metro with one topping cost about $25 bucks with tax, this was the last straw.  With so many excellent pizza places in the valley that are vying for customers, I hope Metro decides to shape up and get back to the quality that made them a staple in Vegas."}
{"text":"Vegas is known for a lot of things.  Gambling, of course.  Bright lights, yes.  Hookers, drugs, and what happens here staying here - yes, yes, and not so much, you idiot.  It WILL get back to your wife.  Anyway, I digress - Vegas is known for a lot of things.  One thing it's NOT known for is good pizza.  Generally the Hut is the pick of the litter for most people in the valley.  If only those poor, misguided souls knew about the wonders of Metro Pizza.  Always hot and fresh, and always more than you can eat, Metro serves up the best pies in the city.  From regular you-call-its to different and tempting specialties to stuffed pizzas so huge that finishing one slice is a task, everything offered here is top notch.  And it doesn't stop at pizzas - pastas, salads, sandwiches, calzones, paninis - I've never heard one person complain about anything they've eaten from here.  Their dine in service is great, their carry out service is always prompt and the orders correct.  The only thing to be wary of is the dinnertime crowds; but if that many people like it, you know it's good."}
{"text":"10 years ago Metro would have gotten nothing but 5 stars from me all around. As I know they make a great pizza-pie, I have recently been let down by the consistency.  I placed an order for delivery not too long ago. My total came out to $50. They forgot my ranch and gave me the wrong pizza. When I called to politely let them know, I was offered $15 credit. The large pie they messed up was more than $15, so I am confused on why this amount is appropriate credit. Basically a way to get me to spend more money there, cuz ain't no one eating there for $15 solo. I was grateful for the credit, but expected more.  The quality of products, and customer service is almost always at 100%. I have never had a complaint about service. The prices have gone up over the years, but at least they have not cut corners on using high standards. Over-all, yes I will dine here. But it use to be my 1st choice, and I can't say that now. There are quite a lot of old school, east coast style, pizza joints popping up around town, Metro may be the OGs of their trade, but they still need to step their game up to keep up with the competition. Especially in Henderson, when Bistro pizza is right around the corner."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places. I love the metro  style crust and the macaroni and cheese is a hidden secret.   Our server Courtney is so friendly. I won a contest in 2014 and won the title of metro pizza prince. I come at least 10 times a year and especially on my birthday for half off a large pizza special."}
{"text":"I attended a pizza making class at a different Metro location and learned in class that originally, Margherita Pizza did not have fresh tomatoes on it.  That made my heart sing. I hate fresh tomatoes, but love tomato sauce.  Take the class...it's fun, and loaded with food and drinks (including beer and wine) for a low price!   I also love a good paper thin crust pizza.  I ordered the Margherita pizza which comes on an ultra thin 12\" crust.  I added pepperoni and fresh garlic and asked for a well done bake.   Definitely the best pizza I've had in Vegas.  Yum.  I am hooked.  See the uploaded pics of the pizza.  I knocked off one star for the decor of this particular location.  It is such an eyesore and is long overdue for a remodel.  The pizza, garlic knots and cannoli are all worthy of 5 stars!"}
{"text":"ugh.  this place has been open for yearrrrrrrsssss...and it looks it!  Dirty & dingy...in bad need of a remodel.  nothing like their new location in Centennial Hills.  Seriously, this place looks gross and the staff is slow.  Horribly slow."}
{"text":"Awesome AOC (arugala, orange, cranberry), salad with goat cheese and house dressing. Soooo good! My kid's and husband devoured the pizza."}
{"text":"Upon recommendation from a local, we made a special trip to Ellis Island for pizza.  The pizza was greasy but good.  The plain cheese was better than the white pizza.  The local root beer was good, but some of the pizzas waiting to be sold by the slice looked sketchy (so old and gross looking that it cost them a star in my review.)  Service was okay, but Secret Pizza is close enough that I probably would just head over there instead.  Not bad though if you're hanging out around here..."}
{"text":"Very bad garlic knots, rude person in the counter. Old Indian guy.  When asked about why garlic knots are not edible, he replied they are always like this. Will not try again."}
{"text":"I came here again yesterday ( thursday) for dinner.We got nuclear fries,and a 16 inch pizza.Half cheese and ricotta cheese,half sausage mushrooms.First came out the bread,then the fries,then the pizza.It came out faster then it did last time,wich was nice. nuclear fries-They were defently spicy,the ranch dressing went well with them  Pizza-My half was the ricotta cheese and normal cheese.Ok I wanted to get the ricotta  becuase i seen a review where someone got it.THey were defently right! It made the pizza even more gooy and yummy,ill defently get it that way next time! The crust was perfect again,i just love this pizza.I put hot pepper flakes on it it spices things up:)"}
{"text":"Last night decided to get pizza for a little get together so we thought Metro would be good for larger pizzas.  The people were very nice, but the pizza was not impressive AT ALL!  We ordered two pizzas and some chicken fingers, totaled $65. for a pizza costing $25, I expected a lot more flavor! Anything. Ok, we ordered the Honolulu - ham, pineapple, bacon, onion, green peppers, we asked that half the pizza had jalapeño instead of green peppers. And it was marginal. The green pepers were in chunks and dried out, the sauce blah, the bacon bits were in a nice row across the pizza so you only had a few bites, or were completely doused, depending on which piece you got.  The second pizza is what I use to judge pizza by as I always have this style. It was a large Mott Street: sausage, peppers and onions. Ok, first off this is a $27 pizza, for WHAT! That price is absurd. The crust was soft and doughy, and didn't add much flavor. The sauce was tasteless, as was the sausage. Peppers were dried out and the onions were barely there. I was extremely disappointed. Now, I'm Italian, and lived in CT where we get our sausage from the little Italian ladies down at the corner shop, and have eaten at the Wooster Street pizza joints in New Haven. This was just plain bad pizza. If this won best pizza for nine years in LAs Vegas, people here don't know what good pizza is. I'm sorry. I would much rather go to Blaze pizza and enjoy a less expensive pizza that has a tasty sauce, with a flavorful sausage. It is so bad, I don't want to eat the leftovers, but I also don't want to throw out the pizza that I paid so dearly for. What a mess! Sorry Metro, never again."}
{"text":"My review has nothing to do with the quality of the pizza as it is quite good.  In fact, one of the best if not best pizzas I have ever had.  My complaint is with the Black Friday Gift Card situation.  I called on the Wed before to find out what time they would be open to purchase the 50% off gift cards and I was told that they would open up at 11am by a guy on the phone.  When I showed up there at about 10:45, I was told that they were sold out of the gift cards.    The person behind the bar area told me they sold out in 2 hours . . . which I said how can that be if they don't go on sale for 15 minutes.  He then told me that they opened up at 7am and that the cards were gone by 9am . . . and sort of took the position of  . . . . tough luck guy or bud . . .something said like that which just added insult to injury.  I really do enjoy the pizza here, but it is quite expensive for pizza . . .about $35 for a large specialty metro style pizza. . . .the 50% off gift cards bring it down to a reasonable level . . . .I mean the pizza is worth $20, but not $35 as it probably only costs about $5 to make.  So since I was misinformed by the person on the phone who gave me the wrong time of gift card sale, I am going to boycott Metro Pizza until next year when I get there at 7am to get the gift cards.  It's just the principle.  Again . . . . $35 for a pizza is quite a bit of money and there is only so much entertainment money in the budget to go out on . . . . . There are good pizzas out there for much less. . . . .  So until next December  . . . I say good bye to you Metro PIzza!"}
{"text":"everything here is pretty good.  Kids ordered spaghetti and meatballs, which they loved.  My husband and I shared a Modesto pizza and that was amazing, craving it as I'm writing this review haha.  The only thing that wasn't good was the minestrone soup, too salty for me"}
{"text":"Our favorite pizza in LV.  Consistently great. It is a hidden gem! Love all the pizzas I try. Service is usually fair.  Love the bread that is served before the pizza comes out, heaven."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! Right as we walked in, we knew it was going to be busy- my boyfriend and j waited about less than 10 minutes and we were seated right away. While waiting, you can see the guy making hand tossed pizza from the splash screen as well! The decor is kind of like an 80's theme ish but it's cute.  To start off, fresh baked crusty bread was given and it was delicious! Soft on the inside and crusty and crispy on the outside! We ordered garlic knots, hot fries, and a half pepperoni pizza and sunchoke pizza! The crust to the pizza was nice and crispy- food was cooked to perfection! Garlic knots were nice and fluffy with the right amount of garlic! The hot fries were addicting and crispy- you can tell they were just right off the fryer!  Our server couldn't have been any more accommodating! We knew he was busy as he was running around the whole place but he was super sweet and still took care of us. I like this place better than some of the other larger chain pizzas and for sure I will be back again for more!"}
{"text":"The service was friendly and prompt. As soon as I walked through the door, I smelled the pizza and felt transported to my favorite pizza places in NYC. The servers were very attentive and were good about tending to our needs.  We ordered the ultra-thin margherita pizza. I was not actually trying to compare it to the NY pizza I love so much, because I knew that the ultra-thin crust would be a different texture. The ultra-thin crust was softer in the middle and very crispy on the outer edges. The flavors were excellent, though the margherita could use just a bit more cheese.   The garlic knots were more like garlic buns...they were so huge! They were chewy and soft and very well flavored. That was the highlight of our meal. The restaurant was clean and did not look divey or dingy. I am definitely going to come back and try the old NY style pizza."}
{"text":"The price is okay and the pizza is quite good for a In-casino-to-go pizza place. Can't complain"}
{"text":"sorry gave a review last year 5 stars , but now after 4 different visits to the NW centenial location. I have to go from 5 star to 1 star. with in a year i have witnessed them go from 5 pieces of meat per slice to 1 and also increase there price from 18.00 large to 24.00 large for the same pizza...... sorry going back to lil Ceasars with extra toppings for $2.00 ===== $9.00 +tax"}
{"text":"I agree with most of these reviews this place was nothing special. The pizza was like something you could have made better at home. That to me could have been tolerable. What annoyed me the most was the fact that there was about 5 servers in there to 8 tables and our server had 1 of them and she still disappeared forever. From getting ranch, to the bill. She even got a bigger tip than I would have liked to have left because she disappeared forever and never came back and I didn't have exact change. Clever strategy on her end AND for me, I know never to come here again."}
{"text":"Nice ambience but won't be going back. Pizza sauce was bland. Costco pizza has better taste than the pizza I had here. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"I ordered a bunch of food to be delivered to my hotel for a Bachelorette party and I was 100% pleased with what arrived!  The thick square cut pizza was the perfect later-that-night-alcohol-soaker-upper. The salad with the pears and candied nuts exceed my expectations of salad meant for a large group (AKA- no iceberg here with fatty ranch dressing here), and the antipasta platter had it all (calalmata olives, artichoke hearts, meats and cheese).  Put aside that the food was tasty- it was ridiculously affordable. Sixteen of us ate to our hearts' content for $15 each.  That's UNHEARD of for a dinner in Las Vegas. AND we ate plenty later that night as well. Metro Pizza did a great job helping us gage it so that we could have leftovers.   Definitely recommending this to any dear soul throwing a Bachelorette/Bachelor party (like Courtney, hi Courtney)..."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Being from Chicago, I'm very serious about my pizza.  The stuffed pizza is awesome, and so are the calzones.  Service has always been excellent. It's nice to have a great pizza place close to home. All you have to do is walk in the door. It smells absolutely delicious in there, and the decor is so perfect.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Great food, seafood fra diavalo, garlic romano fries, and their amazing house Italian dressing! Mark is a wonderful and comical server! We will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"This review is strictly regarding this location and their delivery/catering service. My wife and I have been going to the Henderson restaurant for years and it's great.   Having said that this location's delivery service has much to be desired. My work has been getting Metro delivery every Friday for several months now. Sadly there is nothing I can do to prevent this from happening as the boss loves Metro.   From the very beginning we have had problems. Mostly with undercooked pizzas and employees getting sick. The past 3-4 weeks they have been significantly late or they forget things like salad which is all I eat now since getting sick. On top of it the delivery driver has a really poor attitude.  I'm very grateful for my boss providing lunches but this place is TERRIBLE and I would never recommend getting your party catered from Metro.   If you are metro management please note there is a huge reason your orders from us have gotten smaller.... most people are eating out instead of taking the free food."}
{"text":"I've been to the one in Henderson and expected this one to be as nice - it isn't.  This place is older and looks it.  It could use a good cleaning.  The food is good though.  There were 4 of us, 2 ordered pizza, 1 ordered calzone, and 1 ordered sliders.  Slider girl ate all hers but the rest of us took at least 1 more full meal home.  Good food and more than 1 meal even if you order the personal size.  Personally I'll go back to the Henderson one instead of coming here but if you're in the area the pizza is definately worth the stop."}
{"text":"I really appreciated being able to call a little before the restaurant opened to order my pizza (about 30 mins). I had to pick up and bring to a pre-k party so it had to be ready on time. Every employee that helped, both on the phone and while picking up were very nice and accommodating. The pizza was really delicious, everyone enjoyed it. This is definitely joining the pizza rotation, joining settebello as our favorite. It also looked like a nice atmosphere to dine in as well."}
{"text":"Grabing a quick bite you can't beet 1 top slice for $3.50.  Tossed in the stone oven and ready to chomp in a few moments. Throw some cheese, pepper and oregano and you are in pizza heaven. Craft  Beers on tap for just $2.25. Select from stout, Irish red, ipa, or heffeweissen makes the visit even better.  Cheap beers a flowing.  Ellis Island is A must stop in Vegas if you are looking for a good time on a budget.   I think I found my new starting point for nightly fun."}
{"text":"I like the pizza but it certainly isn't the best I've ever had. It's nice to sit down in a restaurant to eat pizza but I also feel it can be a bit pricey. Still worth going to sometimes. Also, can depend on what pizza you get."}
{"text":"Unique pizzas (like a piggle that included pickles on your pizza) as well as standard pizza's all served hot and delicious.  It is an excellent pizza parlor in the traditional pizza parlor style.  Antipasto plate is terrific as well.  I have been between five and ten times and always enjoy it."}
{"text":"Normally it gets very busy on a Friday night or a weekend, so when we're trying to pick up a pizza that we ordered over the phone, it takes a while for it to come out. One day, waiting for a pizza took almost 30 minutes on a night when it was packed. I haven't been here in a while, but their pizza is very good hands down."}
{"text":"The pizzas here are really good and not over priced. I've tried the gotham and skyline and both were awesome! I recommend this place. Their small pizza is the perfect size for two and their garlic fries are so good."}
{"text":"went to metro pizza on sky point dr. last night ordered a large triple play pizza. over $24.00 for a large pizza!!!! it was a thin crust ridiculous! one of the most expensive pizzas we ever ordered! it was ok but $24.00 wasn't worth it. if that wasn't bad enough my brand new car got keyed on the whole passenger side!!! car's 4 months old hasn't even had first oil change yet. I know it wasn't metro's fault but we were parked in their handicap parking {we're both handicapped and hung our sign up} trouble with this metro  their parking lot is way off to the side and far from the restaurants entrance so yeah makes easy target to vandalize patrons cars.called police filed complaint and talked to metro's manager on duty.advised him to maybe put camera out in parking lot and for him to call police so they can watch parking lot when cruising the area. told me he will have owner give me a call. of course that never happened! yesterday evening ended up making this the most expensive pizza we ever had.typical owner could give a damn about trouble we had outside his restaurant!!! we will never set foot in metro pizza ever again.just a warning to all the public be wary of eating in this establishment cause your vehicles will be at risk when you park in metro's parking lot."}
{"text":"Voted Best Pizza in Las Vegas by the Review Journal 9 times and I can see why.  They have all well know regional styles of pizza, like NY, Chicago deep dish, along with other great food offerings.   We had the Pantheon, a white garlic cream sauce pizza topped with spinach, artichokes, and grilled chicken. The thin crispy crust was delicious with this ingredient combo. We also had the Triple play, and thin crust triple portion of sausage pizza cut into squares. Yummo!  Sausage could have had more of a spicy kick but I guess that's why they make crushed red pepper.  From the pizzas I've tried here, they are one of the best in the valley. They always have great specials on a monthly calander the prepare in the restaurant. They change the theme of restaurant weekly, daily and monthly which adds some fun to the dining experience.  Check the back of your Smith's grocery store receipts for 25% off your dine in check over $25. Deals can be had here if you are a smart consumer.   ENJOY!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. My husband and I ate a late Sunday lunch here because he was craving meatball sliders.haha The service was great, Garret was our waiter and he was very attentive. We ordered the calamari, a small pepperoni pizza, and the meatball sliders. The atmosphere is very lead back and casual. It's a great place to go for groups and families."}
{"text":"Good pizza, which you can order thin or deep dish, great fries (called \"nuclear fries here, and for good reason!)  Close to the airport, so makes an easy last stop."}
{"text":"Love a business who supports their military.  If you check their calendar online, you can find many deals throughout the month.  Eating out with five people can be very expensive, so we were pleased to see the military 1/2 off offer if you dine in.  I love the kids menu because my kids aren't too crazy about pizza.  Are you sure these are my kids?! The restaurant is spacious and the wait staff is very attentive and nice.  We often get carryout as well and the food never disappointments."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Our half eaten pizza accidentally fell off the table and they immediately came by the table to offer another one.  No questions asked. Thank you management for hiring a great team and training them on how to give excellent customer service. It's hard to find it sometimes. Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"We come here from California all the time just for a Metro pizza. We rave about it to everyone we know that is headed to Vegas. This time it was a great disappointment.  The Metro is a thick crust pizza with extra cheese.  At first they bring out what looked like an ordinary thin crust pizza.  Poor waitress apologized for putting the order in wrong and normally we would have been ok(in fear of what  will happen to our food if one complains) but we honestly ordered a Metro had been looking forward to it for months knowing about this trip to Vegas. So we asked if we could please get a Metro pizza. Seriously!! It looked like they brought out the same pizza!!! No extra cheese. No thick crust!! Not even piping hot!! WOW Like we are fools!! Never again!"}
{"text":"I've tried another location before which had way better service.  Upon arrival we were seated (my wife and 2 children).  I checked in on Yelp to receive the free drink offer, first person didnt know about it, asked a 2nd person didnt know and said wait for your actual server.  Our server didnt come for quite some time, finally arriving, and then finally getting our drinks.  I knew what I wanted so I ordered right away, I asked to have 1 or 2 minutes for my wife to peruse the menu.   Our server was not in sight again for a good 10 minutes.   We also realized that from the start, the hostess never offered a kid's menu for my daughter.  Once again, server not around, had to really look for them to get the kid's menu.  Anyways, ordered the \"chicago\" style stuffed pizza.   Unfortunately, being from Chicago, this has nothing on Pizza in the Windy City.    Go get a real chicago style pizza and what you have is the crust then followed by the toppings and the sauce right on top, thick layer.   Metro's version was a stuffed pizza.. Crust, toppings, crust on top.   And no sauce inside the pizza.  You had containers of sauce on the side in which you had to dip or pour on your pizza.  Not cool.    Unfortunately, though I would try other things on the menu, the service is keeping me from going here again."}
{"text":"I will never come here again. Don't like coming to this location. Every time I order a pizza I have to wait and additional 10-15 minutes after the time they say it will be ready.  Showed up today was told 2 minutes. 3 minutes later I'm told it will be 10 minutes and the pizza is just going in the oven. What do you mean?  You told me it would take 35 minutes and when I arrive at the 35 minute mark I'm told 2 more minutes.  This is unacceptable. I will not be returning.  I want my tip back.  Look at my picture.  Sloppy pizza."}
{"text":"Came here when it wasn't too busy, and the service ended up being terrible.   After waiting 15 minutes, I literally had to get up and find a waiter. Then waited another 10 minutes just to receive our drinks. Ordered some appetizers and pizza and after another long wait, it was just alright.   Maybe I'll be back to try again, but not for awhile."}
{"text":"Let's start with the parkkng: parking is around back with doors in the front (not good for handicap). Door labeled to go in was locked. The door for take out is to be used but not labeled for restraunt entrance. The table for a party of 4 received bread with NO silverware, but the bread was good! The baked ziti had no herbs/spices or flavor. We will NOT return."}
{"text":"Okay, I would like to preface this by saying our experience at Metro Pizza in the past has been pretty good, but this review will be only about our delivered pizzas from last night. If Metro Pizza does anything to win back our business I will update my rating. The only reason Metro got 2 stars is because the pizza was delivered on time.  My wife and I had a friend staying with us this weekend from out of town and last night when we were throwing around dinner ideas we agreed on pizza. With Metro it's always been good, and for the price the quality better always be. Unfortunately, last night that was not the case. We had ordered two pizzas, and both were so soggy by the time they got to our house it was like the crust was made out white bread that then had water poured on it. In addition, the one pizza just really tasted funny, and I've had enough pepperoni pizzas is my life to know what one should taste like. So, I'm not sure if they just weren't cooked enough or my assumption about the crust is actually right, and it's now made out of Wonder Bread and water.  We all ate a little bit of it and then decided to just finish dinner with Halloween candy.  It had been awhile since we've had Metro, and if this is their new recipe I think we will pass  I would have just written Metro Pizza, but I didn't see an email address on their website."}
{"text":"I love me some metro pizza. I wish they had a medium size because the small is just too good and when the pizza is gone I am sad and the large is just too damn big. Great cheese pizza always and forever best pizza in town"}
{"text":"We have been a customer of this location for years and it used to be hands down the pizza in town. It's been about 9 months or so and we ordered a Gotham and Chicago style loop plus wings extra extra crispy. The wings came barely cooked and the Gotham just had a bunch of ground meat dumped all over and the green peppers were not completely done. It was awful. The Chicago style Loop had absolutely no cheese and was flat. We have ordered the same 2 pizzas and never has this happened. We threw most of it away it was so bad. This is after paying $78 plus tip. Absolute fail. We will not be back.  Just disgusting. Sad to see a great local place go so far downhill. Have been eating there for over 20 years."}
{"text":"I have been there twice and the service has been really good. I stopped by tonight for take out... I ordered the Baked Ziti and the Metro Pizza.. The young girl at the counter was very nice,, she offered me a soda pop while I waited.. It took a while maybe 20-30 minutes.. next time I should call ahead of time....   I am giving it 3 stars only because it was a little annoying sitting there waiting for your order ...when there was some kid at the counter..he must have worked there at one time as he seemed to know everyone.. however.. he was flirting with the waitresses and asking for hugs and eating the cookie samples from the counter...if he wants to talk and hang out.. maybe next time he should get a table and not stand around and bother those who are working...   I really love the food... but not so impressed with the take out lobby..."}
{"text":"I asked my kids what they wanted for dinner. Well what do you know they wanted pizza. Shocking news.   Well, it just so happens that Metro Pizza just happens to be in the same plaza we were in so off we go.  As soon as we come in to what appears to be a full house, we are greeted warmly by the host and showed us to our table. Right away our server hands us menus and gets our drink orders. Great first impression so far.  We order the Domenica Salad, Garlic Romano Fries, and a large thin crust half Pepperoni half Gotham.   The Domenica Salad has romaine lettuce, salami, ham, provolone, cucumbers, onions and tomatoes all tossed in their own house dressing and served with a fresh-baked garlic knot.  The Garlic Romano Fries has shredded romano cheese and real sautéed minced garlic. No vampires will attack you after eating this.  And for the star of the show, a large thin crust half Pepperoni half Gotham pizza. On one half you got just about every topping they have and on the other half just your basic pepperoni. The crust itself seemed like it was hand tossed at first sight, but as soon as you take that first wonderful crispy bite, there is no mistaking it is genuinely thin crust. With thin crust, usually a lot of toppings tend to make it limp. Not this style, the overall slice kept its shape.   As for the service, lets put it this way, if you don't have to ask for anything, that means everything was on point. This was one tip I didnt mind going over the standard. Great service is few and far in between it seems so I dont mind showing my gratitude.  So there you have it. Great food and great service. Finding both in everywhere you eat is usually a low percentage. If I am in the area, I will ask my kids.........no what I meant was I will tell my kids we are having pizza."}
{"text":"The Green  Valley- Veggie Pizza is a winner!  We had an impromptu gathering at my big sis' house in Vegas and ordered in a large veggie and a large pepperoni pizza.   If you prefer your crust light & airy, almost Brooklyn pizza style, then you'll give this pizza a thumbs up. The vegetables are fresh & tasty. The tomato sauce is light and seasoned to perfection.  Green  Valley pizza is comprised of the following toppings:  cherry  tomatoes; zucchini; black olives; onions; and mushroom.   On a busy day,  the Friday after Thanksgiving, the person taking the tel. order was patient and friendly. The delivery driver was polite. The pizza was at doorstep in about 40 minutes.   I will definitely call up pizza from Metro again the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place always hits the spot. I've only gotten delivery from here, so I can't comment much on the restaurant itself.   Usually a large 1 topping pizza with an order of garlic bread = $30 which isn't bad. Usually it gets delievered within 45 mins and it's always hot and steamy. The pizza dough is not too thick and the sauce has a really good flavor. It's a little greasy, but hey that's what should expect when you get pizza.   I DEFINITELY recommend ordering from here if you don't want generic chain pizza from pizza hut or dominos. It's a nice change with some fresh flavors."}
{"text":"My husband took my daughter to eat there on January 11th and my daughter was burned by their pizza. I called the manager the following day to let him know because I wasn't sure if the waiter notified them, I was told that someone was going to call to make sure that everything was ok and till this day no ones has called or contacted me in any form. Everyone be aware specially if you have young children their temperatures are ridiculous they gave my daughter a 2 degree burn in her hand and no one in management cares."}
{"text":"Came here on an empty stomach with my friends, ordered the seafood fra diavolo and the pantheon. The pizza took really long to arrive but was worth the wait. The seafood fra diavolo was delicious, lots of shrimp and calamari. The pantheon was also good. Overall great pizza, the wait was the only downside."}
{"text":"2 for 1 Whole Pizzas on Sundays and 2 for 1 Slices or Whole Pizzas on Thursdays. This location only. No player card needed. Open everyday from 11 am to 12 midnight!  Located inside the Ellis Island Casino off of Flamingo and Paradise, this find of a gem is a must especially on those days! For those that are not familiar with Metro Pizza, these guys are consistently in the top 5 of the Best of Las Vegas. For you first timers I suggest the Gotham, which has a little bit of everything. If not that, then the Honululu, which has ham, pineapple, green onions, and bacon bits!  They not only have pizza, but their Garlic Romano Fries will definitely keep the vampires away from you! Or that one obnoxious person you don't wanna talk to!   They have other locations as well but why would you not go here on those two days listed? You not only save money, but you get 2 awesome pizzas guaranteed!  The only downfall I think is that on those particular days, they are very busy. They do have booths with tables but they are usually taken. My suggestion would be to call for pick up. When you get there, if there are tables available, by all means, grab them! If not, then you can always go somewhere else to eat.  Lastly, don't forget to get an Ellis Island player's card because you just might score a free slice!"}
{"text":"The calzone wasn't great. The pizza was fantastic. I liked the milkshakes.  They had a few other but parties in the place already so they crammed our party of 6 into a smaller booth.  The wait staff was ok. They came back to check in only a time or two which was inconvenient when we needed more napkins or refills."}
{"text":"I really like their Grilled Chicken Pasta salad with the honey cayenne dressing. One of my favorite salads ever. I also believe you get what you pay for .... For two salads the meatball sliders and two cannolis you're looking at about $50+tip. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is b/c I'm not that impressed with their pizza. It's \"okay\" and you can tell they use quality ingredients but I wasn't a fan of their crust. I like it puffy on the edges and thin in the middle and well done. If is sags when I fold it- it's not cooked enough...But that's just a matter of preference...  The interior at the Decatur loaction is horrible! And the bathroom is kinda gross. The handle seemed broken and could overall use a little dressing up. New paint and a few cosmetic upgrades aren't a bad idea."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas! Vegas--you're in trouble if that's true. It's not bad pizza, I just think that the election is rigged. The owners are smart and humor runs high in their marketing ploys. Gimmicks like getting a discount on certain day if you're name is Mark are pretty brilliant.   The service is also pretty on point and upbeat. The place itself is designed to feel homey like a pizza joint should and succeeds. I am especially fond of the mammoth booths. Extraneous seating is always a winner in my book.    The special on my day is that you got free Nuke fries with your order. The spicy Nuke fries are o.k., but I think I would be upset if I paid for them. Gesture appreciated though. Metro has four Eastside specialties on their menu--so my friend and I went with the Four Corners, which gives you two slices of each Eastsides.   With exciting toppings like eggplant and ricotta in the mix--I thought the Four Corners was going to be a knockout, but the uppercut never came. I got rabbit punched instead. The idea is good topping-wise on these pizzas, but the ingredients all feel very commercial--like straight out of a can or factory.   Also, the Large pizza is pretty large--so only order thick crust if you are starving or if you want to take some with you. The Four Corners hit the spot as far as my pizza craving, but surely there is better pizza in town. That being said, the pizza hounds have been let loose and the hunt begins!"}
{"text":"Disappointed we cant make our own pizzas and not exactly up to par this time. Booths were cracked. I asked for a tall Heff and got a short. No silverware. Gelato was poor when its normally stupendous. #1 may not happen next year. Just sayin."}
{"text":"I just love Metro Pizza. It's a real clean restaurant and parking lot - friendly staff, free bread and butter while you wait -- check in Yelp while there and got a free drink coupon but my drink was free anyways, included with the lunch special. I just love their white pizza. Most pizza places don't even know what white pizza is -- but at Metro they specialize in it, so so so good!! This is a great date place as it's a little noisy so you can talk yet not as casual as a pizza hut -- yes it's very casual but they seat you here and you have servers.. This time I had a salad -- which yes, their ranch dressing is so fresh and yummy - good salad. I had garlic fries - YUM and an individual pizza (lunch special) cheese. Great food, thanks!"}
{"text":"Consistently delicious! We love to get the Gotham minus sausage and beef add ham! A large pizza and domenico salad feeds 4 perfectly!   The complimentary bread to start is delicious and I often wish I could go just for that!"}
{"text":"Like other reviews say, the interior looks like the set of \"Saved By the Bell.\" If you can get past that (or maybe that '80s look is a plus for some?) you'll find some good pizza. It won't crack my top 5 in town, but it's a nice spot to bring the family for a low-key dinner.  We had the Modesto ($25.95 for a large) - roasted mushrooms, garlic, roma tomatoes, basil, and sausage. The crust was crispy and chewy but the underside of the pie wasn't firm enough to hold up to the toppings that were on it. I loved the sausage on it and the fresh basil. The sauce wasn't very memorable.  We also got an individual cheese pizza ($7.75) that my kid loved. He liked it so much that he got mad at me for eating his left overs a couple days later."}
{"text":"Metro pizza has been around since I moved here almost 20 years ago.  They've always had extremely good quality for a reasonable price.  The two locations I've been to have a New York style decor and a very friendly environment.  Recently, a couple co-workers and I decided to order from there for lunch.  I chose one of the stuffed pizzas called \"The Loop\", which references Chicago deep dish pizzas.  However, their stuffed pizzas are nothing like deep dish pizzas from Chicago.  From the description on the menu, this calzone-like dish comes with sausage, pepperoni, and mushrooms, and cheese (all my fav pizza toppings) stuffed inside a doughy shell.  When the delivery guy showed up I was starving and couldn't wait to dig in.  Upon opening the mini pizza box, I found exactly what the description foretold.  This thing was so big (I got the smaller sized one) that I could only eat half.  It also comes with your choice of dipping sauce, marinara or meat.  However, it is ridiculously greasy.  So much so that it bled through the box and even through the wax paper underneath it.  Overall it was excellent.  It was even good the next day since I only ate half.  Additionally, I highly recommend the parmesan-romano fries.  It's just french fries, but they cover them in the above mentioned cheeses and fresh garlic.  They come served with ranch."}
{"text":"I am never disappointed with this Metro Pizza. The service is always good and the food is delicious. The meal starts with bread, which for my family is one of the most important details. The salads are very inexpensive and easily feeds 4 or 5 people. I love their house Italian dressing. I almost always order The Gotham but all their pizzas are really good. I can't say they're the best in Vegas but you'll always get a really good pizza here. My wife is a much tougher customer than I am and even she agrees 4 stars."}
{"text":"This is some of the best pizza I have ever had in a restaurant.  When we first walked in, it took a while for someone to notice we were there and a bit longer to get seated even though it seemed like there were a lot of empty tables.  Our booth seats were half wet, half covered with crumbs. As soon as our food came, we didn't care about any of that.  And our servers at the table were really friendly.  They start you off with nice crusty bread and butter.  They have a 'barrel special' wine selection which that evening was a bottle of grenache for $12.  We shared a salad - can't remember the name that had walnuts, blue cheese, pears etc. - it was plenty for 4 people.  We had the Honolulu and the Sunspot pizzas - both were super yummy.  Honolulu was ham, pineapple, bacon bits (real ones) and bell peppers - we opted for no onion.  Sunspot was tomatoes, artichokes,spinach and basil - we opted for no garlic.  Two small pizzas were enough for the 4 of us."}
{"text":"Angela was one of the best servers we have ever had. She took the time to ensure that we were well taken care of. I would have given the place 5 stars, but I can't get past the wierd Miami Vice decor in the joint!"}
{"text":"Missing large cheese pizza. Out of 2 large pizza. This is for a staff lunch. I can only feed half the staff, if I wait 30 min the first half the order will be cold. I asked for entire order to be re delivered so everyone can eat a \"hot\" meal together. Customer service rep said why would I do that. You are \"only\" missing a $27 pizza. Horrible, horrible service."}
{"text":"Terrible Service!  I wish I could say something about the food, but we never got to try it.  After waiting 20 minutes for service and watching the waiter attend to the 3 tables that were seated after us, we finally gave up and left.  We will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Ordered jumbo ravioli which they are a lot different seemed liked a layer of lasagna stuffed with cheese never again."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town. Can't wait for the NW location to open. Perfect crust, delicious sauce, right amount of cheese. The bread is so good you have to be careful not to fill up before the pizza comes. Love the Tuscan salad, one of my favorites. And they have real ranch, can't stand the store bought ranch other places have. Worth a try for any pizza lover."}
{"text":"2 words: garlic knots. Must order! The pizza was meh. Overpriced. But I love the atmosphere and the options other than pizza. Calzone. Salad. It's all delish."}
{"text":"First time i came here it was good. Second time it was good as well.. BUT this third time is was bad. So we got half PEPPERONI and half supreme.. Turns out the half of the pepperoni had meat and other ingredients from the other half .. So annoying taking pieces off ( since i was the one who ate the pepperoni half) oh and it was so oily"}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza for pickup with Brian on Saturday night and he asked for my phone number. I told him it was my first time and he said \"welcome, hope you like it\". I ordered a large metro with extra pepperoni and it was so good. My hubby went to pick it up which Brian said it would be ready in 40 minutes. It only took about 30 and well worth the wait. They have a monthly calendar with various promos and looks like it may be a new pizza place for our family. Pizza was wonderful and the price may be a little more than the local quick pizza shops but this is well worth the cost."}
{"text":"This is both a good and bad review.  Over all we loved the pizza, not the service.  Read more if you like for further detail.  I went here last night hoping to find better than Papa John's and as far away from Northside Nathan's Detroit Pizza as humanly possible.  I've got to say, I really like pizza at Metro.  Although I live in Las Vegas now, I am originally from Rhode Island.  My all-time favorite pizza has always been A-1 Pizza in Newport, RI.  I guess some of my friends would say I'm difficult when it comes to eating out with me.  It's just I expect a lot when I'm dining out.  Something more than I would make for myself at home and service to match.  If that makes me \"difficult\" then so be it.  I've always been a fan of huge toppings and mondo amounts of cheese so I ordered the Metro Pizza with extra cheese on top and added zucchini and spinach.  I'm also a big eater so I figured I'd order a side of hot wings as well.  While they came to the table temperature hot and looking  great, I didn't care for the sauce.  It was vinegary and not spicy hot at all.  I'd asked them to make them as hot as possible.  I guess they just don't have the means to make them any hotter than you'd get with a standard hot sauce from a bottle.  They were maybe just a little under cooked as well.  Everyone likes a crispy wing right?  Requests them extra crispy and you may find them passable.  My partner ordered a small Stockyard stuffed pizza and it looked amazing and he stated that he'd enjoyed it very much.  Noting that the sweet Italian sausage was plentiful and yummy.  All in all, I'd have to say it was a good night for food at Metro.  I will be back to try more of their delicious pizza to be sure.  Okay, now the bad... The service was poor.  Just to give an example and not dwell on it too much I'll just tell you a few points they stick out 23hrs latter.  We sat with empty glasses for 20min till I asked for assistance from a second passing water.  No suggestions were offered and when asked about the different crust options it looked to us like she's grown tired of that same question from every dang customer and offered very little help or sympathy for two proclaimed \"first timers'.  No suggestions were given or up-selling suggested for that matter.  No one ever smiled and when our pizza was ready to be brought to the table it looked as if our waitress was debating with the other water who helped us as to who wanted to bring the pizza to out table (the second water was nominated).  We shared the last napkin at the end of the meal just not wanted to bother with her again.  The friendliest conversation we had with our waitress was the 10 second attempt at influencing her tip upon laying the bill on our table.  I thought the prices were maybe a little high for what we got, but they do have a special going on that attempts to those on a budget.  Mon-Thu 2:30-4:30pm is HALF OFF all pizza!  I'm liking that and at that price I'm still giving them 4 stars with horrible waitressing being my only real complaint."}
{"text":"A complete waste of money! One of the worst pizzas in the West island. If I had any enemies I wouldn't even recommend this place to them."}
{"text":"I've never eaten at this restaurant before but decided to celebrate my birthday lunch here before my family, friends and I head down the street for the Pinball Hall of Fame. They don't take reservations but said they have ample seating and bringing a cake was no problem.   When my husband and I walked in, we were greeted by the most awful stench. The smell I would describe as sewage and farts. Gross! I have to say if we were not expecting 8 more people to join us, we would have ran for the door. But alas, we had to sit in the middle of the room bearing the terrible smell. It seems like there were people eating there oblivious to the stench so after 15 minutes or so, I think our nostrils gave and we were able to ignore the odor. Thought we were crazy for a bit until I asked a friend who finally showed up. Yup, there was a sewage aroma in the air masked by cooking pizza.   When the food came, there were no complaints. Everything was good! My husband claims the fried mozzarella was the best he's ever tried. The pizzas were larger than I imagined and 3 large pies were more than enough for my party of 10. Overall, great pizza and good value. Would return here if somehow there was a guarantee that the place would smell better."}
{"text":"Metro Pizza is a good local pizza chain with many options - probably the closest thing in Las Vegas to a good, local, homegrown small pizza outfit with a few locations, and good dining options at the restaurant.  I have been a customer of Metro Pizza for 15 years +, and their food and service is pretty consistent, and many of their staff have been around for many years - an indication in my mind of a good solid employer if wait staff, busboys, etc... stay at a restaurant for many years.  The pizza is of high quality, and many varieties are available - different crusts, toppings, etc...  I particularly like the San Gennaro pizza with the thick 'Metro' crust.  I generally favor their thicker crusts here as opposed to the thin crusts, which are more standard in my mind.  Salads are good too - the antipasti salad is excellent, and the chicken pasta salad is also excellent - their dressings are very good - balsamic, honey dijon, house special, etc...  Good lunch specials as well for under $10.  Main issues I have had are minor, generally wait at lunch can be long.  I favor their Tropicana location near UNLV over others, but the Horizon Ridge location is ok too - food is consistent, I have just gone to the Trop location for a longer time.  They also have a good calendar of events (which unfortunately is not updated online enough at their website) - they do many specials - i.e. discounts for your name, wearing UNLV colors, holidays, etc...  I also very much enjoy when they have events for kids to make their own pizza, lessons on making their really good bread, etc...  Highly recommended, good value based on reasonable prices and good quality, good local small business that appears to treat their staff well and delivers good food and service.  This business appears to be a  good community citizen."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the area, Hands down!  Metro crust is so thick and chewy, and flavorful. I can just eat the crust my family left on their plates (they don't know how to appreciate good crust?)  Ask for caprese   salad. It's not on the menu or it's not listed as Caprese. Their balsamic vinaigrette is   They cannot be reached on phone sometimes, because their to-go section gets so busy. But then number listed on here is the correct one, give it a couple of minutes and try again.   Update: 9/29/2017 Why! Oh why?! You messed up my beloved Caprese salad! It's not even Caprese salad because you forgot basil  tomato-to-mozz ratio was way off too"}
{"text":"Love love love the food and by far some of the best pizza in Las Vegas, but the northwest location is famous for really bad service."}
{"text":"I have always heard that metro pizza is really good, so we went over there on a weeknight. The food is decent but honestly I had better. Tried the pizza and the pastas. One was a spaghetti with meat sauce and the other one was a rigatoni with sausage and onion and pepper, and it was decent but nothing special. Also tried the grotto pizza and it was alright. When we went there, there's no silverwares and they dropped the bread down, no knifes for the butter, after that they dropped down the pasta and salad and we still didn't have any silverwares, like really? I had to look for the server to get some simple utensil. Also, they never ask if we needed any red pepper or Parmesan. There are some tables that have different condiments but not on every table. They also never really check in on you, just drop the food off and go. I'll probably never come back, at least not this location."}
{"text":"Meh.....the pizza was okay.  Always wanted to try Metro as I've heard how good the pie is.   Well, maybe in a stand alone restaurant it is; but here, it was just okay.  Definitely an attempt at NY style, but other than a somewhat thin crust that can be folded.....that's about it.   Decent pie if you're hungry.   Gourmet or award winning?  Naw.   Remind you of NY?  Not really.      But, for what it is......it's just fine."}
{"text":"Tried Metro Pizza on a family trip to Vegas.  We ate the Honolulu Pizza. This pizza was huge 16 inch. We were stuffed. This pizza was a thin crust new York style pizza. Highly recommend this place.  Really cute and clean on the inside and the staff was friendly and pretty fast to get our order."}
{"text":"$30 for a pizza and they couldn't even make it edible.  The last time we went there the stuffed pizza was undercooked. We figured maybe it was just a fluke and it was undercooked because it was so huge, so this time we ordered a regular pizza not stuffed and it still was horrible. They only get one star for the nice cashier at the front."}
{"text":"Terrific pizza!  Good every time, no joke.  Great bread and butter, service, pizza, salad and on and on....even offer a pizza happy hour on special days and times.  Good job Metro!"}
{"text":"My family and I used to love Metro Pizza. Tonight's meal was a deal breaker, though. We ordered take out, so the wait time was expected. I ordered a pepperoni calzone and a margherita pizza- they only have one size. First of all, the margherita pizza's size is pretty unacceptable. The size has gone down drastically - and yes, I understand all of their pizzas are thin crust, but recently, there is almost nothing on top of the burnt bread they call \"crust\"... It's crunchy, but not even appetizing, crunchy. It's just hard, tasteless bread at this point.   Secondly, I ordered a pepperoni calzone and arrived home to a cheese calzone- when I ordered pepperoni. I called Metro again, and the same girl that took my order answered; and did not give me any other options. At least Dominos gives you credit towards a new order.   Metro Pizza's quality has definitely gotten bad over the past few months."}
{"text":"Cool Pizza spot but they must have the smallest TV s of any bar throughout Vegas. All good though, food is good ambiance is better than most Pizzarias. Took my son for his 1st calzone and he dug it! Plenty of other options for people who want something else besides pizza. Looking forward to coming back!"}
{"text":"Great place for the family. We ordered the Pantheon white garlic cream sauce with chicken and spinach. The kids loved it. A large had 8 large slices. Very delicious!"}
{"text":"Best pie in town.   What else needs to be said??"}
{"text":"I tried the Old New Yorker and Four Corners and have had better pizza. The complimentary bread is one of the worst I've had.  Don't bother ordering the individual size, I think it's about 1/3 for half of the price or the large size. Price-wise it's not that cheap either.  They have daily promotions, tough."}
{"text":"How things have changed since our favorite server left more than a year ago. I used to swear by this place & told many how great it was but that was then. It has been almost a year since I've been back due to the last few times having been pretty bad. The food was just not the same & the service was shotty."}
{"text":"Family pizza night was at Metro Pizza on Horizon Ridge.  We had to wait over half an hour to be seated on a Friday night despite their being at least 3 tables which remained empty the whole time we stood waiting.  I'm sure it was a staffing issue, but as a customer it did not help with our patience.  The food we ordered was good, not great, but solidly good.  My pizza arrived as a completely different pizza, but the waitress offerred to remake it immediately and even brought me a nice salad so I could eat with my family while their meals were hot.  She packaged my pizza to go.  The best item was a sampling of their sliders which my husband ordered.  The sliders were served on their homemade garlic knots and the meatball and the caprese ones were great.   We'll likely return as it's so close and food was good and service was great."}
{"text":"Just finished up a great meal at Metro Pizza. Excellent service,  fresh, Hot and Tasty!"}
{"text":"Closest thing to East Coast pizza we have had west of Philadelphia!  Yum!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, cheap prices, good service. I love the sauce and the warm bread in the basket.  Seriously, two people can eat dinner here for under 15 bucks.  A Vegas tradition since Zach and Slater were carousing the Max for chicks.  This location screams 80's Miami Art Deco...show up in your linen suit and Wayfarer's and check your Dornaus & Dixon Bren 10mm at the door, you're gonna love this place!"}
{"text":"The worst waiter service I have ever had at metro pizza. Brian- the African American waiter - is the worst. Completely disregarded our need for drink refills, brought our food out half warm. NEVER checked on us the whole time after we finally got our food- 1 item came out first then the other item came out 10 minutes later. It really sucks when the other people are eating in front of you and by the time you get your food- they are nearly done. I couldn't wait to pay the bill and get out of there. Why were we neglected you ask? Maybe Brian should stop trying to impress the sexy young waitresses and laughing with him and do his damn job- taking care of customers like me. Every time I looked for him for help-that's what he was doing- are you kidding me??? I have been going to metro Pizza for well over 25 years- when John and Sam made the pizza on Decatur. Yeah- I'm a regular. I'll never go back the sky point spot. Thanks for ruining for our family pizza nite out Brian!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying the New Philly cheese steak sandwich is delicious. As far as the food goes, I give the back of the house five stars. As far as the front of the house goes , you need to seriously train your staff on customer service. It's pretty simple. Be nice,  if you tell a customer you're going to do something, do it. And if you can't resolve the situation get a manager, don't get frustrated with the customer. I spoke with David today and he finally resolved my issue, but the last few times I've dealt with certain people from Metro , they've left me debating whether or not I want to be treated like crap to get some good pizza."}
{"text":"Always on point with quality and service.  Aside from a recent experience from a manager on Superbowl day 2015 at the Tropicana location we have been loyal customers on a weekly basis and introduce anyone who hasn't had the Metro Pizza experience.   Food is delicious, filling, and family friendly. They even offer kids to make their own with fresh dough. From the beginning with fresh bread, to the end with yummy gelato its worth a try."}
{"text":"I am a native New Yorker I will keep it short and to the point - Best pizza west of New York City."}
{"text":"I am a native New Yorker I will keep it short and to the point - Best pizza west of New York City."}
{"text":"I am a native New Yorker I will keep it short and to the point - Best pizza west of New York City. For some reason this location seems to have the best pie of all the Metros."}
{"text":"This place has not only the best pizza but amazing salads!! The desserts are yummy too. Go NOW!!!"}
{"text":"A disappointing meal all around. We had heard how great this restaurant was so decided we'd finally give it a try after living in the city for 7 years. We got the salad which would have been good except for the slimy canned peaches. Then we got the pizza. I could smell the sugary sauce before it was even placed on the table. There was no garlic and the dough was not very good. We wished it would have been better but it was not."}
{"text":"Horrible, most expensive pizza I have ever had, tastes worst then frozen pizza. So much grease. I will never return here!"}
{"text":"Pizza was very good you can definitely tell it was hand tossed handmade loving care was taken in each pizza. Ingredients refresh the whole pizza just was excellent. The inside of the restaurant was a little run down chairs weren't very comfortable to sit long time in , the service was okay but the recommendations by the waitress were awesome. We went during happy hr when They had half-price pizzas which made it a really good deal. three adults got individual pizzas and an appetizer of cheesy bread and all for 25 bucks, we aren't locals to Las Vegas but we visit often and will definitely make sure that we come back to one other locations that they have."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza I've had on the west coast since I moved here from New Jersey 10 years ago. Their servers are very nice and the atmosphere in their restaurant is family friendly. My only complaint is that they don't have any TV's to watch games on, so it's hard to get the family to go there on any game days. But definitely 5 stars for the food and service!"}
{"text":"If you like salty,  overpriced pizza, this is the place for you.  $30.00 for a, at best mediocre pizza, not worth it. Check out pizza rock, so much better pizza than this joint."}
{"text":"So GOOD! I brought a group of 7 people here and they all raved. Awesome free bread.  We all ate and had sodas for about $57 + tip."}
{"text":"Decided to give this restaurant another try and we won't be back. Horrible service, Wednesday nights are awful for some reason. Ordered the Pasta Luna which advertised \"vine ripened tomatoes\"...canned is more like it. Don't recommend it."}
{"text":"Now...the size of this place, the waiter service, the bar with TV gives Metro 4 stars. The food gives it 3 stars. This place sure can get loud when there are big groups eating. I came here for a romantic anniversary dinner and I would say that Metro is not the place for that. My most recent visit was with 8 family members and I think that is more Metro's style.  The wait staff has a way about them that is efficient and thorough. They get the job done.  I love the spaciousness of the restaurant. The decor helps promote the Italian feel.  The food was just ok for me. I've had pizza, garlic fries, salad, and canolis. I would say that it is good food, just not wow or amazing. I see myself coming here again for family get togethers but as far as for a quiet night at home, I have other choices for tastier pizza."}
{"text":"Dissapointed, I will give it another month and go gain. Half of the pizza's that came out were burnt and had huge bubbles. There are way better pizza places in the northwest, I am going back to Northside Nathan's."}
{"text":"Having worked in the service industry through college, I'm pretty forgiving and don't usually feel the need to post a poor review but this is the absolute worst experience I've had ordering pizza. I had a slice of Metro Pizza the night before I ordered from them and was quite impressed. Unfortunately what I ordered was not anywhere close to the quality I'd come to expect. I ordered a small Stockyard \"stuffed pizza\" with meat sauce. I can't give an accurate review because that is not at all what they delivered. Delivery took about an hour as expected. After a long day at work I was ready to munch down a couple of slices and get to bed. When the pizza got here I opened it to find two small ice cold quarter slices of a regular small pizza with pepperoni and sausage and an oversized cup of still warm meat sauce. After taxes, delivery and tip I paid $24 for pizza that didn't compare to the slice I had the night before...it wasn't even close to the quality of the last frozen pizza I had. Probably not typical of the quality and service from this restaurant but pretty unforgivable no matter how much slack you want to cut. Order with caution."}
{"text":"I took my family to have some pizza and we waited and waited ....and waited....and waited....and then we walked out after 25 minutes 9f absolute nothing....they did not even bother to ask for our drinks.....good bye metro pizaa...forever!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Metro Pizza since I was a wee young foodie, and I have always loved the food and the service.  There is no question why their pizza wins Best of Las Vegas  nearly every year.  Having said that, the family and I went to try the newest edition located in the northwest off the 95 between the 215 exit and Durango.  The experience was less than stellar overall.    The ambiance and the appearance of the new Metro is wonderful.  It is very open and inviting, and the seating is well spaced.  The decor is great, with a mix of old-world Italy and sports banners hanging in the bar area.  After being seated, we were greeted in a fairly good amount of time (within about 5 minutes) and the server started out on point.  That is where the point became a jagged line.  After our drink orders were in, we asked for a kid's cup for our son, and never saw it (after asking two additional times for it).  The lack of attention continued for us throughout the meal.  I did run to the restroom to verify that I was, in fact, still visible to the human eye just in case there was an anomaly, but alas I was not transparent.  The orders were finally taken and the food did arrive to the table in a more than reasonable timeframe.   The food is still exceptional, and even though this is a new location the quality is still very much the same as I would expect from Metro.  The service, on the other hand, continued to deteriorate at an alarming rate.  After receiving our food.  We did not see our server again until nearly 20 minutes later.  We had to ask another server for a refill of our beverages, and there was never a follow-up from our server until that 20 minute mark.  When she did finally show up, my wife asked for to-go containers and a slice of their carrot cake for our son.  The boxes did show up, but we never saw the carrot cake, or even the check for that matter!  20 more minutes passed and the server was seen checking on other tables and completely ignored us.    This was the final straw.  We called the manager over to express our frustration and concern over the missing cake that our son was now asking every 3 seconds for (never keep a 5-year-old away from his dessert).  The manager was very courteous and did state that he had noticed the poor service (which is the first concern I have.  If he is aware of the poor service, why wasn't he out there to begin with?) and wanted to make sure that we were taken care of.  This was a very disappointing trip and one that I will have to think hard about returning to this location for.   This restaurant's only saving grace is the food is fantastic and well worth a normal wait.  I hope that they are able to correct their poor service issues."}
{"text":"Food is ok, I prefer the crust crispy &  not to flop around when you pick it up.  Service has been hit or miss, this was a miss.  She had to come back a couple times to confirm our order.    Not all our pizzas came out together we were told they had problems in the kitchen making the cheese pizza (the easiest one to make). We were sitting right in front of the kitchen, no noticeable problems.  She would only refill half the tables drinks.  The other half had to catch her & bug her for drinks."}
{"text":"Worse service ever!  This place USED to be great, service & food.  Not any more!  1. Restaurant practically empty & had to wait 45 minutes for a table. 2.  Waiter only takes 1/2 the tables drink orders and doesn't come back for the rest. 3.  Waiter takes the food order & never brings clean plates (we went to other tables to get them) 4.  Food comes out COMPLETELY WRONG!  No apology from waiter or manager. 5. When correct order arrived it was ice cold! 6. We have to BEG for refills on our drinks. 7. Waiter never comes back to the table to see if everything was ok? 8.  We had to find the waiter to get the check.   9. After all these mistakes NOT one penny taken off the bill!  NOT EVEN A \"THANK YOU FOR COMING\""}
{"text":"My friends and I make sure we make at least one trip per month to METRO PIZZA on Stephanie and W. Horizon Ridge Parkway. We all agree that they have the best pizza in town. Their half-price pizza, from Monday through Thursday before 4:30 PM is a great deal! Yesterday for the first time, we took advantage of their \"old school pepperoni\" something they started about a month ago. OMG! Brought us back to when we were growing up and pizza was real pizza.  The pepperoni slices are small,  about the size of a nickel,  and crisps  and forms a little cup when it's baked.  The flavor is so much better.   Service here of course is excellent as always."}
{"text":"Loud. Decent service. Oh, and did I mention it's LOUD?! Could hardly hear the people sitting across from me. The food was marginal; OK pizza; sickeningly overly-dressed Caesar salad. Their gelato isn't real gelato, but Talenti brand, which is basically smooth ice cream but not truly gelato. Definitely won't be going back."}
{"text":"Pizza is good and the (service is awesome).  Anything you order is bigger on the quantity of food you get compared to most pizza places.  Just the atmosphere is great from the people serving and cooking."}
{"text":"EVERYTHING WAS GREAT!    my BF played baseball at unlv after Friday games we always wanted to try metro pizza but the close early. Years later we came back to try it and everything was amazing !!  The staff was super friendly, the food was SUPERB we got meatball sliders, bbq chicken pizza (not my fave) pulled pork pizza (PHENOMENAL!!!!!!)    Checked in they said they'd honor the free drink but they forgot.   Definently recommend !"}
{"text":"She whispers in your ear softly; \"I need to get up early for work tomorrow, do you think you could ask your friends to leave?\"  The beer's gone. By rights, they should have left hours ago.  What's keeping them here you begin to wonder.  It's not you or your half charming personality. And it's certainly not your wife either.  It's those seven boxes of Metro Pizza you over-ordered.  This shit is so good, no-one's going anywhere until they're all stuffed like blue ticks..unable to hold another drop!  This pizza is so delicious, it'll have you crooning 'Hey Compare' and 'Funiculi, Funicula' in your head, over and over again.  You're not Italian, but after eating this pizza, you'll think you were raised by a hairy upper-lipped mom and her four hairy upper-lipped sisters who routinely beat you iwith a wooden spoon for not keeping up on your cranking duties on days when they all came over to make homemade pasta.  Bitches."}
{"text":"Service has went way down. The wait for food it over 40 minutes so far. Workers busy making out in the work area in plain site of customers. Workers obviously don't like there job. Last time we will be coming here. Sad because  we like the food."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had in the area. And we stumbled in today, half starved, the waiter says pizzas are half price. I thought he was joking!!!  No more fighting over what to get."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from here for over 10 years.  I love their pizza and their clubs.  Always a go to when I'm not sure what to order.  I ordered a pizza one time and the cheese was all moved to the side. We called and the man argued with us saying that we dropped it. Finally they came and brought us a new one but only after 4 phone calls of being hung up on.  This happened again 2 nights ago I got 2 small pizzas.  Both of them had the toppings moved to the side again.  However when I called back this time, the man didn't argue and offered to bring us new ones or give us a credit for next time."}
{"text":"I ordered the Stockyard and  it's usually very good. This time the stuffed pizza was barely stuffed with the meat items. It was more pizza dough than anything else. Very disappointed! If I'm going to spend $30 on one pizza I would hope to get my money's worth out of it. Most likely that's the last time I order from Metro"}
{"text":"Paid $20 for a pepperoni pizza. Waited 40mins and the employees were all sitting down doing nothing. Won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The crust is awesome. I don't really like Hawaiian pizza but that's what I ended up ordering and eating because of my 16 year old daughter. I think had I gotten something that would better fit my personal taste, this 4 would be a five.   I liked the fact that they had tv's but they are really small. They are really high up.   Our waitress was genuine and did a good job making sure we were taken care of.   I will be back to try some other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Cool little location beside smiths and ups store on Flamingo and Decatur. I've been here many times since I live close and drop off shipments at the ups store often.   I like this place if eating at the restaurant but delivery comes a little soggy. Eating there you get a raised serving tray letting any grease drip below the crust keeping it crisp. I like the thin crust, could be just slightly more crisp which I'll ask for next time.   Nice staff. Cool decor. I like the oldies music and theme.  Bar and outdoor seating.   Worth a try. I'll be back."}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE their Gotham pizza.  The only thing I am not crazy about is the price.  All said and done we usually have a $30 tab for 1 pizza, that's a little ridiculous I think.  So lately we've been getting a small and making our own salad at home to fill the gaps, better for us anyway, and keeps it under $20.  I've never eaten in the restaurant (take-out only) but it looks cozy and I noticed they have a bar too :)  I think they do more take-out orders than sit-down, from what I've noticed anyway (the phone never stops ringing but the dining room isn't full)."}
{"text":"Metro Pizza is always awesome! I love their cool calendar of specials. I always get the 2 for 1 pie from the Ellis Island location its good on Thursdays and Sundays take out only! They are so generous with the toppings! Love it!"}
{"text":"We were in town for the night and decided to have a pizza delivered.  I convinced my friends to give this place a shot.  I ordered thr North Beach and had them add olives.  We also got an order of garlic fries along with the atomic fries.   30 minutes later there was a knock at the door and a pizza dude stood there with our meal.     The pizza was great.  The cheese was a perfect blend gooey, salty wonderfullness.  The grilled peppers were amazing and added a wonderful texture.  The dough was very good as well.  It was crisp and had a nice bite to it.  The fries were good but not my favorite part of the meal.   This place is a must.  Leave the strip for an hour and come get the best pie in the state."}
{"text":"Really cool place and the pizza was good although the crust was a little tough.  But I'd definitely go back and try it again.  It's a Vegas pizza favorite with some friends."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in vegas.  Order what they call the \"metro\" it is has a different dough than other pizzas.  It is hard to describe, it has a thick light airy crust, like what the boarder crust is on a good pizza but its that way on the whole pie.  No matter what you order the pizza is tasty and a everyone I have ever taken there loves it, you can't go wrong.  They also bring you warm delicious french bread as you wait."}
{"text":"Stuffed pizza is great stockyard is my favorite but the regular pizza the dough is so flat and tasteless I might as well eat cardboard with cheese on it"}
{"text":"When I first moved to Las Vegas, before gourmet pizza places started popping up everywhere, Metro was the only option. It was consistently voted best of Las Vegas and even though I now prefer Naked City, there are still some occasions where I specifically crave Metro Pizza. The crust is thinner but not \"thin\", their slices are huge, and they have a lot of options for toppings.  The other night I ordered a large 1/2 Modesto with sausage (free to add, why not?) and 1/2 Milano to go. One great thing about Metro is that they DO offer 1/2 and 1/2 toppings because Naked City doesn't. I was told the wait was about an hour and a half (Friday night) but it ended up being more like an hour. The Milano is a white pizza with garlic, mozzarella, and ricotta. This pizza is very garlicky. I don't mind that but my boyfriend wasn't that into it. I liked the ease of eating it, you can actually pick it up with one hand, whereas I'm usually always a knife and fork pizza eater. The Modesto's flavors were more intense and varied but the pizza itself was totally soggy, I think because of the tomatoes. I really enjoyed the strips of basil on this side and I think next time I may add that to the Milano.   Overall Metro Pizza is consistent and offers a lot of interesting pizzas without them being TOO weird. It's pizza that doesn't make you want to pass out immediately afterwards, which is appreciated sometimes. I'll keep coming here even with the pizza explosion happening around town."}
{"text":"I've been coming here on and off for the last 10 years or so.  I've seen the quality go downhill in the last two or so years.  Let's start with the booths.  Some of the booths are so in need of new upholstery.  They are torn up and it feels like you are sitting on sharp objects.  They are in need of new table clothes as well, they are worn through in some places.    I had dinner here last night with my wife and kids.  The drink cups had rough edges on top (they are plastic) and are in need of replacement. French fries were under-cooked and chicken fingers were pretty blah.  Chicken Parm sub was decent.  Pizza is still very good here, but I won't be back anytime soon until this place gets some love.  Please spend some money and make it look nice again."}
{"text":"I can't believe I've never eaten here before!  I had the Stromboli and it was amazing!  $10 for the Stromboli and a drink.  Short wait for my food (they offer bread while you're waiting).  Nice, clean, friendly.  Full bar too.  Plenty of parking.  I'll be back for sure.  Pizza looked awesome as well...I'll have it next time."}
{"text":"We love Metro, normally.  Called to order delivery today, three times and they hung up on me without saying a word all three times.  I am okay with being put on hold, but to have their machine answer say they will be with me in a minute, have it ring and be hung up on, not pleased.  Customer service is important if you want my business kindly put me on hold until you can get to me.  Rudely hanging up, not once but three times, unacceptable. Metro did contact me to apologize.  They are making efforts to improve this issue, which is good.  I do like that they cared that my experience was negative."}
{"text":"Love Metro Pizza forever but I love even more that it's located in a bar and it's cheap! Great pizza and great vibes. Especially on Thursdays, buy one get one free and 1.50 hefe's! For sure my fave spot to go every Thursday."}
{"text":"My family and I ate dinner here last night, the service and food were great!  We had the Abbondanza, their meat lovers pizza, portions were huge, and there is enough left over for lunch today.  Great place, give it a try."}
{"text":"Worth the try.  Came in with a party of 8 and ordered 2 pizzas. Little did we know how large these pizzas were. Dough seemed to be made in house, which gave the pizzas a fluffy, but filling crust, \"bread,\" portions. My only discrepancy was that I felt that the crust, \"bread,\" portions lacked any real flavor in themselves. Wide variety of toppings to satisfy everyone. Very flavorful. The environment was comfortable with internal decor matching their theme (80's 90s?).   I would come here again."}
{"text":"Being in TV Production means working excrutiatingly long hours and often terrible food. After 12 hours on the job and one shitty meal under the belt I started to crave pizza. Wanting to do right by my crew I ordered 10 pizzas from Metro for my hard workers. We got everything from the sausage lover, pepperoni, to the crazy spinach one, and MAN, did people scarf up those pizzas like it was their dying meal.   We did that 6 nights in a row and it never got old. It was so delicious that I'm salivating right now thinking about the pizza all the way from Los Angeles. I will say that the one pizza that didn't impress was the margarita. It was very thin and extremely dry/crisp. All the other pizzas were fabulous, fold over types, like true NY crust.   For once I really wish the old adage wasn't true:  \"What happens in Vegas, stays here.\" Please come to LA. Period."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. They even delivered to our hotel at Hooters. The delivery boy was very professional and even was dressed in slacks and a tie. I have never seen such a well dressed pizza boy. Great service! Would definitely order from here again."}
{"text":"Metro Pizza is a great place for a low key dinner with friends and family. This is DEFINITELY a family establishment. Every night they have a different \"special offer\" and you'll find these on the paper calendar at each table. There are specials for service members and most holidays--they really do vary.   There is always an upbeat atmosphere and you're always cozy in one of the booths. Being from New Jersey (home of the best pizzas) I am very, very particular about my pizza. I'm not gonna lie, I don't love their classic pizza-but it's because it's not my style. I'm a thin, crispy crust kinda girl and this place definitely goes more for the thick, gooey crust.  This being said, they still get five stars in my book because although I may not love their classic pizza, they have some AWESOME specialty pizzas. They do stuffed pizzas which are just awesome. The Pasta Pie is amazing and they have SO many other options that could satisfy any cravings you may have.   You really just need to find what you like and I'm sure you'll be able to do that with their extensive menu! You may not love everything, but you'll definitely fall in love with something."}
{"text":"I love Metro Pizza! This review covers multiple visits and we have never been disappointed. The food is always delicious, the staff is always efficient and friendly, and the atmosphere is great! They are very good at accommodating large groups of people too. Whenever family visits from Washington state we always plan to eat at least one meal at Metro Pizza.  The garlic knots are a must order... YUM!"}
{"text":"Consistently good pizza!!! I am here for the lunch special which included pizza and dude salad and s drink. The entire back menu is dedicated to the lunch specials do you have large  variety of options."}
{"text":"I musta come on a weird day but I had pretty much the opposite experience of many folks: the service was fine and the crust was terrible.   I ordered at 5:00 on Sunday Night (think: football) and was told I could pick up my large pep and mushroom pizza in 30 minutes.  Not bad.  I arrived in 25 minutes and was greeted by two pleasant cashiers dressed in football jerseys. They said my pizza would be out in a few minutes. About 15 minutes later I asked again and my pizza came about five minutes after that.  Everybody was nice, and it seemed okay that I waited at a time which would be so predictably busy.  When I got back to my hotel room, about 5 minutes away, and started eating my pizza I was shocked to find that the crust was chewy and had poor flavor. When I say chewy, I mean actually hard to eat.  The other ingredients, the sauce, cheese, and pepperoni, tasted great."}
{"text":"My whole family loves this place. Their sauce is the best...we always order extra to go with the Skyline. We also love the garlic bread rolls...so yummy. If you're not into deep dish the Gotham is fabulous too."}
{"text":"The food is not the best so I don't know how they have so many awards and the wait is outrageous like I'm talking 2 hours I think they take themselves way too seriously and it is overpriced wow they invested way to much money in this waste of time and money (Riley 11 Year's of age)"}
{"text":"Pizza is far from my favorite type of food but I just can't get enough of Metro! We waited anxiously for this location to open and since opening day, we've been there quite a few times. While I love Metro, I have to give them only 4 stars, mainly for consistency issues...  Let me talk about the food first though. By far, my wife and I's favorite pizza here is the buffalo chicken. It is just flat out good. The chicken and blue cheesed mixed with onions are celery are a perfect combination. And the buffalo sauce they use is great, super good buffalo taste and its not too spicy but not too mild either. There other pizzas are really good too. From the not so usual seafood pizza to your standard pepperoni, they just make good pizza!   Appetizers are mostly good too. We can't talk about Metro without bringing up the bread. When you get it hot and fresh, it's hard not to get yourself nearly full on the bread. The garlic knots are a must try! I also really like the meatball sliders which they use garlic knots as the bun for. If you're in the mood for wings, Metro has decent wings also. The only thing I don't like too much are the fries. They use a great spice on the nuclear fries but the fries themselves just aren't quite there.   Like I mentioned, Metro has some consistency issues. We went opening night and I can tell you it's gotten way better since then, but they still have some kinks to work out. We've had some not so great service and sometimes the pizza doesn't come out like it did the last time. Less toppings or sauce, whatever it may be. The other thing that bothers me is the bread inconsistency. Since we love the bread so much, it's disappointing getting a burnt loaf or one that's cold.  Metro is a must try in my opinion. They are a little on the expensive side but the monthly calendar with daily deals are great. And if you can make it during a weekday for the 50% off deal, its a perfect way to try it for the first time."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and great service.  Very tasty pizza, and the server was always checking water and our needs.  Very happy with service and food."}
{"text":"Not too bad. Got a pizza on pickup. It seemed kind of doughy and almost damp. Not a terrible pizza, but not as good as I remember them being. The service was fine when we picked up the pizza, but honestly I would probably try another pizza joint. Can't say I would recommend this, but if you are starving and nothing else is available it's edible."}
{"text":"Lobby had a strange smell. Service was good and quick. Friendly waiters. Food was good as always but the experience was ruined when someone comes in with a German Shepard. This was not a service or seeing eye dig so made it really bad so we left half way thru the meal. Big furry dog. May not ever go back. I like dogs, just not sitting at the table eating with me."}
{"text":"This place is always good... if you're a fan of mac & cheese this place has the best in town for sure. You wouldn't think that of a pizza joint but trust me.. give it a try. The pizza here is delish! I tried the chicken parm and the breading was a little too soggy for my liking, could of been a fluke or just how they make it."}
{"text":"I love pizza and metro pizza is no exception.. unlike most pizza joints this is a full restaurant with ample seating and other items on the menu. Did I mention they also have a full bar! The pizza's and food items are not the best in town, except for the mac-n-cheese, I think it is the best! I used to work in a pizza joint in So Ca and I know the amount of work that goes into making fresh dough, sauce and prep. However the prices here are still too high. If you have access to the metro guys calendar then go on the special days and make sure you mention the special and you will definitely get a bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"Consistently a great neighborhood resource- my family stayed for a week. We ordered out and loved the chopped chicken salad, hawaiian and meat lover pizza and the huge success is the Caprese sliders served on hot garlic knots of bread. Amazing! My Navy son wolfed down his meal plus half of my sliders. Of all the great places we can walk to, Metro is truly wonderful."}
{"text":"Metro pizza has been around in Vegas for a long time and have a couple locations around the valley. It's a little pricey but the pizza is good. Not my top pizza place but it's up there.. good service and nice atmosphere"}
{"text":"Do you have any idea how good the pizza is here?  On a scale of 1-10, it is a 9.5.  I am only holding out because we have a Tony's Little Italy Pizza in Placentia, Ca. that ranks a 10 in my book.  We have been coming here for years, whenever we find ourselves in Las Vegas.  I think this may be the original location.  There is a decent amount of seating, not really huge, and bright, cheerful, NY ambiance.  We usually order the extra thick crust, but we were trying to cut down our carbs this time around, so went with a thin crust.  I loved it's thin \"crustiness\"  with cornmeal base, and would definitely do it again.  But....our real downfall was the fresh out of the oven, hot Italian bread with sesame seeds.  Fabulous tasting, it has a crumbly crust and the most tender insides you can imagine. They brought out a soup bowl of their amazing marinara sauce (I ended up drinking it like soup when everyone else was done) for dipping, and lots of butter.  I think I like the less acidic marinara even better than the pizza sauce.  Either way, you will be tripping over your feet trying to come back just for that.  The good Italian sausage with fennel seed, cheese, pepperoni, and fresh mushroom is our standard order.  It never disappoints.  A large size gives you 8 large slices.  They kept the Coke coming, and it was free with a Yelp check-in.  Even refilled our marinara bowl.  Such piggies we were.  No leftovers.   We walked away full and happy, 4 of us for ~ $30 including one generous glass of house red wine for Mr. B.   Happy to share this with you!"}
{"text":"If you like greasy NY Style pizza, this place is for you, and me, because I love it!! The slices are not NYC Huge, but they are big enough and very reasonable price wise. Grab a slice, and head over to the bar for an in house brewed beer or root beer, and you have yourself a damn fine day going on! The pizza is exactly what it's supposed to be, thin yet still a bit chewy, slightly charred, just the right amount of grease, and lots of melty gooey cheese. Delicious!!! Service is all business like, but it's quick and efficient. On Thursdays it's two for one slices, and on Sundays it's two for one whole pies. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Always polite staff. However..... Mex.girl @ counter register overworked on Valentines day had 3 people on hold. Very shy, very timid, very slow, afraid of eye contact, nice but scared and clueless. Perhaps a new kid ???????     No offense but pls.stop hiring tenny-boppers"}
{"text":"you folks with all these 5 stars must have absolutely no taste buds.    just very drab unappetizing food.   Polite service though all the staff is super nice..deep dish though is the best ever..."}
{"text":"Decided to stop in in a whim. The price wasn't too bad for the portion. The pizza is good if you don't mind all the grease. In my opinion the pizza was way too greasy and upset my stomach. However their anti pasta salad was the bomb. I will be back to get the salad.   My second visit was a take out order. Double check your order because the gals tend to forget to give all your items and aren't the nicest people there.   I would recommend sitting down to eat instead of taking out."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing. Last night hubby and I ordered pizza and salad from here and had it delivered to our room at the Aria. Let me start by saying these people are so nice. After getting screamed at by some nutcase at Sicili's about how they don't deliver to Aria (sorry for asking, but you really should just post that on your yelp page or website) they were just a breath of fresh air.     We got a small stuffed pizza that was delivered HOT and a salad that was fresh and had no problem including the extra ranch (which was so good I could put it n an old work boot and enjoy). They even threw in two jumbo sized root beers.  I would def order from them again."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place.... Great pizza! great people! It's always our last stop in Vegas."}
{"text":"OMG.  Amazing pizza!  Delicious salad!  Red velvet cheese cake was tasty!!! Never had pizza this delicious.  I'm craving it again and it's only been two days since the last time I ate it!  They have great customer service and super friendly staff!  Been here two years and I'm mad I didn't take the time to try them sooner!!  Pizza Hut,I'm never eating you again!!!!"}
{"text":"I dined here tonight for dinner for the first time and the service and food were excellent!  We sat at a nice booth, our drinks were replenished in a timely fashion always with a new glass, and our server was very personable and attentive.  I can't remember his name but he was younger and said he had worked there for a long time. We asked if they had caprese salad and it's not on the menu but the server said they could make something like that and it came on garlic knots and was delicious!  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I love their pizza. Full of flavor and thick and fresh out of the oven. The presentation of the pizza makes you very hungry and does a good job matching its taste. Plenty of topping and really satisfying."}
{"text":"I had Metro Pizza for the first time last night and it was amazing. I think it is the best pizza in town and my Valentines Day heart pizza was so cool!"}
{"text":"Omg!!  Went back in just to see if they have changed and all I can say is WOW!!  Metro is my favorite pizza place again.  What a turn around.  No bad complaints here.  ( miracle coming from me.  Lol. ).  Had the stuffed pizza finally. I was a little apprehensive at first but damn!!   Frigging \"excellent\" in my Spicolli best voice.  All I can say is YOU HAVE TO TRY THE STUFFED PIZZA.  Great job Metro.  See ya soon my friends....."}
{"text":"The wife and I recently embarked upon a quest to find our perfect pizza in Las Vegas.  I'm Australian and the wife grew up in Michigan and neither of us are fans of the two most prominent styles of pizza available in town - New York Style and Chigaco style.  I posted a thread on the discussion forums here detailing my preferences when it comes to pizza and a few people suggested Metro pizza and their \"metro crust\" as possibly satisfying our needs so we decided to give it a try.  The restaurant seemed very pleasant, but we decided on take-out. I ordered a large \"Gotham\" minus the mushrooms and my wife, ironically, ordered a plain cheese with mushrooms. Both were metro style and we were very encouraged watching our nice puffy looking pizzas come out of the oven.  When we got home we discovered that Metro Pizza is getting close to what we are looking for, but still isn't quite on the money. The real strength of metro is the superior quality of the toppings. They are absolutely delicious.  The crust is also tasty, but I sort of wished it wasn't quite so thick on the outside and wasn't quite so thin in the middle - perhaps a uniform thickness throughout.... Like many pizza places around town, the pizzas are a bit wet for my tastes and slices tend to point straight down to the ground when you pick one up rather than exhibiting any sort of backbone. This is a shame because the crust has a pleasantly chewy texture that I enjoy. If they could somehow cut the wetness about the interior of the pizza this would be a real winner.  Overall Metro Pizza is probably going to satisfy the majority of pizza fans in Vegas, particularly those with tastes less exacting than my own. It wasn't quite the crust we were looking for, but the quality of the toppings makes for a delicious taste that will surely call us back for repeat visits - at least until we find the holy grail of Vegas pizza."}
{"text":"BOGO on Thursdays. You're welcome.   Not the best pizza I've ever had nor is it the worst, but it gets the job done. I also have left over lunch for the next day. I had their wings recently, and they were good, nice flavors and texture! The garlic knots were a bit lacking so I would skip on those. Also, pizza in general is salty, but I always end up drinking like a gallon of water before going to bed after eating 4 slices of their small pizza. Maybe their pizzas are a little high on the sodium content?  The dude working at the front counter is on it! He always packs us plates, napkins, crushed red pepper, and parmesan cheese. Props, dude! Overall, the good deal, decent pizza, and friendly service is what brings me back on Thursdays."}
{"text":"After nearly 1.5 years we decided to try Metro again. We used to get pizza here all the time and loved it but all of a sudden something changed and their food was terrible. So we started ordering pizzas again....large cheese pie and I am so very happy the pizza is back to the excellent quality tasty pizza it was 1.5 ago. So today we ordered dinner entrees and was very pleased with the food. I ordered mozzarella triangles, chicken parmigiano with spaghetti. The dinner came with a large fresh and delicious salad. The chicken parmigiano and spaghetti was excellent. Mozzarella triangles were good. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"How is this place still in business?  Oh yea... the pizza tastes pretty good.  SERVICE STILL SUCKS!  Tried it again at the Centennial location.  Ugh.  Terrible.    Hostesses were very pleasant.  There was a 15-20 minute wait so I ordered a beer at the bar.  The bartender was so rude.  No smile.  No greeting.  Nothing.  Wow... welcome to Metro Pizza.  The server was slightly better.  Somebody brought bread to our table so we asked for utensils.  5 minutes later, we asked somebody else for utensils.  We were starving so we opened the little butter packets and dipped the bread into the butter.  Lol.    5 minutes later, we got our server's attention so we asked him for utensils.  He looks over to the kitchen and says \"they're coming soon.\"  5 minutes later...  no utensils.  Server comes to take our order, and when we're done he says \"Okay I'll get your utensils.\"   Haha.    Salad comes out.  Pretty good.    Pizzas come out.  Delicious.    My son's kids Mac & Cheese hasn't come out yet....  10 minutes later....  15 minutes later.... it comes to the table cold and flavorless.    My son takes a bite and says it's terrible.  I take a bite and confirm that it's awful.    I tell our server to take it off the bill.  No sincere apology.  He agrees that he'll take off our bill.   We've been to the older Metros and they're awesome.  This location is either managed by the idiot cousin... or it's so far from the other locations that there is no quality control on service.     We won't be back.  Way too many good pizza joints in the city to waste our money here."}
{"text":"The Modesto with sausage is so tasty and their pizza crust is some of my favorite ever. It's crispy, crusty and delicious! The Oreo shakes is thick and the right amount of cookie."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! We got the BBQ chicken pizza and it was heavenly. The bread they give you before your meal is warm and tasty. The minestrone soup tasted delicious and homemade and was even better when you dip in the homemade bread they give you. My son loved the soup and it was full of hearty vegetables so it was a double win. Turns out we came on a good night, they were doing 50% off for military which was VERY generous! I asked to speak to one of the owners to tell them how impressed we were and how nice it was for them to be so generous with their discount but neither owner was in. We definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great pizza and great service! Zakery was awesome! We can't say enough good about this place...you have to experience for yourself."}
{"text":"Well, after waiting 15 mins to put our drink order in while the employees just walked around empty handed. Even the girl who sat us, who had nothing to do and just stood at her podium while we sat with nothing to drink. 3 waiters and no one can say \"hello I'll be right with you.\"!  Food as usual was very good. I just can't get over the horribly bad service. It would be better off to turn this into a self service establishment."}
{"text":"Tonight I had a disappointing experience at metro pizza.  At 5:20pm I order a chicken Parmesan sub for pick up. They told me it would take about 25 minutes. I showed up at 5:45pm and paid. They told me about 2 more minutes. 15 minutes later I asked where my food was. The girl went back to check and came back with my food. It took 40 minutes for 1 sub sandwich. Very frustrating! Not to mention the food was also disappointing. The chicken on the sub was over cooked and barely any sauce on the sandwich making it very dry. The bread wasn't very fresh either. And the girls at the pick up counter were not very friendly.  Needless to say I don't need to rush back there any time soon."}
{"text":"Terrible service here. We waited way to long to get our food , our bill and boxes. The screaming kids running around and sliding on the floors like it's a baseball diamond echoes in here have it sounding and looking like chuckle cheese. Top this off with bad service it's nightmarish. Not worth it. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Random pizza night almost went south with bad service right off the bat from the hostess and the lady taking the drinks.    Walked through the door and the hostess grabbed our menus and guided us to our seats without saying a word.  When I asked how her day was going she turned in surprise that I would speak and said good, as she walked away.  The drinks were next to come, the waitress asked what we would like to drink, but then said four waters and turned to walk away.  She had to be stopped so we could actually order the drinks we wanted.  I almost left on the spot, but I have been here many times with fantastic results and for a moment I thought I was being pranked.  Well I'm glad we waited, our waiter was awesome and saved a possible full blown nuclear meltdown of a review. He answered a few questions, took our orders, got the food out in a hurry and always made sure our glasses were full.  Way to come in and get the save Sir, if it was baseball season your closing skills would be in high demand.    We went with a couple pizzas,  (Gotham, and meat lovers)salad and some nuke fries.  All were great the typical Metro Pizza pies with great portions and tons of flavor.  The fries had just the right kick and I topped it off with a nice adult beverage.  The initial service will drop this review from were it should be in the four or five star range to a three.  I am hoping it was a one time thing, but thank you again to our actual waiter for being what I have come a custom to at Metro Pizza."}
{"text":"Closed to our hotel. Good pizza while staying in Las Vegas and excellent price."}
{"text":"Metro Pizza is one the liveliest pizza joints I've ever been to and its more like a dining / catering hall as it looked like a cafeteria inside with a lot of buzz from hungry customers everywhere.  Plenty of groups are eating here and while the price of the pizza is a bit hefty, however, its absolutely delicious.  This would be a prime location for many Vegas drunkards, but they don't open late unfortunately.  The thin crust pizza was just light enough to feel the crisp and it was pizza that tasted clean and wasn't all over the place.  Deep crust looked equally delicious and the meat pie was a savage's delight.  It was full of sauce, plenty of toppings, and thick enough to where people with small mouths would have trouble biting down.  Its not all about pizza here, their salads look very hearty and the fantastic \"nuclear fries\" are a heart attack waiting in a box."}
{"text":"I know my NY pizza, I wouldn't say Metro's is exactly the same, but it comes pretty close."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years and Metro has never disappointed.  In my opinion, Metro Pizza is home to one of the best pizza deals in town. Monday - Thursday, from 2:30 - 4:30pm all of their pizzas are half off. I'm a sucker for places that hook it up with free bread and the baked pizza dough that arrives before the meal is delicious.  They definitely get points for experimenting and making some very unique pies like the little piggy which features pulled pork, fried onion strings topped off with diced pickles. Their \"small\" pizzas can easily feed two. The crusts are nice and crispy but you can opt to get the metro crust which is a lot thicker and doughy. Its nice to see some premium toppings like grilled chicken, meatballs and even truffle oil available. The stuffed pizzas can probably feed a small country and the expansive menu features much more than just pizza.  They have a monthly calender where each day has a special deal. On certain days you can get 25% off for military members or for just reppin UNLV. The restaurant itself is pretty nice and spacious, the bar has a pretty good selection of draft beer and prices are great. Our server Terry is the definition of excellent service. Shes always on top of refills, her recommendations are always on point and her cheery attitude makes the dining experience all the more enjoyable. This place is a must for anyone looking for some good pizza in Vegas.  And as always, remember to check in for the yelp deal!"}
{"text":"Food was decent. Not my first time here. But the waiter was bad. He could not multi task. He had us sitting and waiting forever after we were done eating just to come take the food and box it up. Kept waiting on tons of other tables.  Maybe they shouldn't wait on to many tables at once.  He was very unprofessional and not friendly. Not sure if I will go back again."}
{"text":"We went here last year a few days after they opened.  It wasn't the best I've had nor the worst.  I had a calzone which was pretty tasty, but  a bit bland.   My mom's pasta was very bland & boring.  It is cute inside & the service was decent.  We haven't gone back since..."}
{"text":"I've tried a few different things here...my all time favorite is definitely the meatball sliders. Image a great tasting meatball in a slider....however instead of a regular old bun...it's place in between a soft garlic knot. It's amazing! A new discovery that I decided to try was the Flying Piggle Pizza. Succulent BBQ pulled pork, fried onion strings and butter pickles. THIS IS A MUST HAVE!"}
{"text":"It was good to read another review where someone recently complained about their pizza being burned to a crisp!!  Thought it was just us!!  Usually, you give a place the benefit of the doubt--but discounts and apologies are pointless if the same mistakes are repeated over and over---we gave this place like 3 chances!!  Once they even burned a personal pizza--seriously?  Shocks us that the place is mobbed--almost like they planted actors there as a publicity stunt---for as often as they burned our pies, why go back there again?  Metro Pizza---get it right, get a clue, get something...!"}
{"text":"Everything here is always great. The staff is always on point and friendly even though they are normally busy! This place has never disappointed and I would be shocked if it ever did."}
{"text":"Just wanted to give a quick update. Pizza (and all food) at Metro has always been 5 stars. Last night my husband and I and the twins met one of our couple friends and their kids for PIZZA FRIDAY at 6pm. There was about a 25 min wait for our party of 8 and after waiting for 5-7 min the hostess asked us if they could sit us in a booth and table....next to each other...putting the kids at a separate table. GENIUS....three of the kids are 8 and one was 7 so we weren't worried about them expect for noise.....but it was a busy Friday and plenty loud!  Our waitress promptly came up to us and asked if we were on a date night....she said have some wine and enjoy...I got the kids. SCORE.....so nice and professional and kid friendly. She treated the kids as if they were adults....they ordered their drinks and food and dessert....and they were so happy and she was so accommodating to them and us, I am forever grateful to the staff at Metro.....we will def be having more couples nights at Metro Pizza!!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to give Metro Pizza a try last night, and we had a great experience. Our server was Eduardo and he was great; very attentive and checked on us often. Luckily they weren't busy at all when we stopped in. My husband got a small stockyard stuffed pizza and he said it was great and the sausage was very flavorful. I had the fettuccine alfredo and it was pretty good as well. We also shared the chocolate cake and couldn't even finish it. That's definitely a family size dessert! Our drinks were never empty and the restaurant was kept very clean. I don't know why we hadn't been to Metro Pizza before last night, but we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The pizza is a bit overpriced and forgettable.  The metro crust was OK.  I spent $26 on a large metro crust with sundried tomatoes and artichokes.    If you need to use the bathroom don't expect it to be clean.  The door knob had a booger on it and we decided to hold it.  **I was shocked to see an employee size up a group of customers.  I  watched him talk about them and laugh to a coworker.  I don't want to do business with anyone who treats customers like that! That is a \"NO NO\", especially in a bad economy.    I will not be returning!!!"}
{"text":"We went here for lunch after church on a Sunday and there was 12 in our party including one kid. When I asked the hostess for a high chair that I saw in the corner, she said she didn't have one! When i pointed to it, she said \"oh that thing.\" Um, why are you a hostess if you don't know what a high chair is ?!??   Our waitress wasn't much brighter than the hostess. Because after taking our orders she went over to my friend and said that she was confused and asked if he could just reexplain the order to her so she could write it down this time because she didn't think she'd have to write it down the first time around and she forgot everything.   Then when our pizzas came out, one was burnt. Like literally we had three pizzas and this one was clearly black and burnt. And when we told the waitress she said it looked fine to her ? And threw a fit when we said we didn't want it.   The only good thing about the meal was the nuke fries. We won't be returning."}
{"text":"Forgetting Something??   Metro Pizza always has amazing service I am rating this in regards to my take out order on 05/25/18 we ordered a pizza with a few salads along with wings and the garlic fries!  It was about a 30 minute wait or so for all the food to be completed and avalible for pickup. After the time had passed we went to go pickup the food and the cashier at the register was polite and very nice handed my food in exchange for my money and I then proceeded to head back home. I didn't even think to check and make sure the order was correct as I assumed they would get it on the first try.   After arriving at home we started to go through all the items and noticed that the garlic fries were not inside the bag. I then immediately called the business and let  Them now that they forgot the garlic fries at which time she asked me if it's with the wings I looked in the Box of wings and could not locate any garlic fries. I then let me know the were not and I'll be back enroute to pick them up.  I went back grabbed the fries as they were made fresh and she advised me that when she talked with the cook he didn't see them on the list although they were and she was sorry for that.  I let her know that it was ok and I picked up my items and left.   The parking situation where I was at was pretty small although it does look like there is extra parking nearby the restaurant itself appeared clean and the employees are really  polite and nice!"}
{"text":"One of the best Vegas pizza joints!  The food is fantastic and the service is great. My family loves to go there and the house made balsamic vinaigrette dressing is the best I've ever had, anywhere. I ordered it and WOW, a great surprise."}
{"text":"Hey so the pizza is Good , WAAY  over priced unless you go for their happy hour where you could order pizza half off from 2:30-4:30 (check the times to be sure) but  not  for take-out. You could order as many pizzas as many people are there for half price , then it's worth the money... also the red sauce for pasta is horrible,   But the salad house dressing is amazing!! I have visited this place many times over the last 10 years I have had hit-and-miss service which didn't bring me back for a long time but the most recent time I visited the service was very good .. 3 stars for Inconsistency , food and prices."}
{"text":"My go-to place for pizza during Happy Hour.  I've gone here M-Th on vacation.  Metro Crust pepperoni or stuffed pepperoni, sausage, mushroom!"}
{"text":"Decided to finally try this place based on reviews. We ordered a large half cheese/half pepperoni and pineapple. The taste is very average, but the worst part is the crust. It was so hard and chewy, it was so hard to tear bites off. I'm bummed, was hoping for so much better."}
{"text":"I love the food, I always love the service. But we just called in to order the same pizza the same way I have ordered it since this place has opened.... And was told it would be a 4 dollar up charge to change the pizza from red to white sauce. Supposedly they changed all their pricing 3 days ago ... They are already pricey as it is and 4 dollars is even worse. Looks like our monthly order from metro will no longer happen.    Yes my one order a month will not make or break them... But if enough people are not happy with them maybe they with find the error of their ways and not nickel and done their customers.  Yes the food is good but not at these prices anymore."}
{"text":"We've been long time customers of Metro for a while. Lately, the service quality had been declining somewhat. Most recently, we ordered a stuffed pizza and family size Italian salad. With delivery, it was almost $70. A little high in my opinion, but that's not the point of this review.   With our pizza, we ordered half without mushrooms. However, when it was delivered were couldn't tell which portion didn't have the mushroom in it. I called and asked how I'm supposed to know and the person on there phone, Cheyenne, was pretty rude. Said there's usually there topping on the pizza indicating which half contains it. Then followed up with, \"if that's not there then there's not much I can do for you\". She's their manager too. Just reinforced my view of their declining customer service.  Sher could have offered an exchange of pizza or a discount fort next time but nothing.   Lastly, I gave the company a chance to address the situation by emailing them and it's been a week now; no response.   What used to be good idea no longer. The quality of customer service had declined considerably and the prices are pretty high. You can find better service elsewhere."}
{"text":"Obviously, I've been coming here for the pizza for years. It is one of my favorite pizza places. Service is always excellent (at every location) Some of my favorites are the plain cheese, white pizza or the Margherita. I don't know how many times I've eaten several slices of cold cheese pizza... because I can't stop eating it and I don't want to wait to re-heat it.   Recently, one of the girls in my office recommended the Mac and Cheese. She knows I love me some delicious mac and cheese. Holy Moly it was amazing. Baked, cheesy deliciousness.    Garlic knots are pretty fantastic too. They came with a side of sauce and it was pretty tasty. Another co worker ordered a garlic knot meatball sandwich thing... it looked amazing.. See photos!!!   Next time I go, I'm not sure if I'll be able to choose between mac and cheese and the pizza! Not such a terrible position to be in.   Ahhhh. I can't believe I almost forgot to mention the baby cannoli's.  These are so freaking good. I can barely stand it. See my photos!!! Absolute must try!!! Everyone at my table also liked the elaborate Pizza Paradiso (Nutella and Raspberry Sauce) I thought it was good... but a little too much for my taste... The cannoli's are where it's at."}
{"text":"I've been having pizza here for almost 10 years now and it's still a strong showing in the pizza department. Usually very busy during dinner hours and it can get noisy with the kids getting grumpy before bedtime, but just order another glass of wine or another beer and you won't hear the screaming kids. ha ha. Food was great tonight and service was good. Our server forgot our salad, but we just took it to go and it's all good. I wouldn't order the Alfredo with grilled chicken, not only is the chicken a seperate charge, you don't see or taste any chicken at all in this dish. Chicken pieces so small even a child wouldn't notice it. This is a pizza place and a solid one at that, but you take your chances with other dishes. My parents loved it all and we took enough leftovers home for later."}
{"text":"Metro Pizza is a family environment with decent pizza, but I can say from experience that service here is a hit or miss... they either will always be at your table or only visit once and forget about you, at least from my experience. The pizza is decent, a little overpriced if you ask me, and a nice environment. I'll go back when I get the chance but it's nothing super special personally."}
{"text":"Pizza is the best in town and bread is delicious! It is a pizza joint - expect loud crowd, kids, and ok service. But food is great and portions are big."}
{"text":"Received a birthday email for a free cannoli with any purchase. Went today at 3 PM and ordered a pizza. I was notified by the server that I cannot take advantage of the half-price pizza deal that they offer between 2:30-4:30 PM Monday-Thursday and receive the free birthday cannoli. I was very disappointed and the server didn't offer any other type of treat to celebrate my birthday."}
{"text":"Been here many times servers most of the time do smile and are friendly. Today we were greeted by Brandy she had a beautiful smile. The person (Carlos) who came to our table and stood there to take our drinks did not smile, did not introduce him self, neither had a professional body language. I am a very observant person. I was confused to what he wanted from me I said we will get small metro pizza he said \"she'll be here in a bit\" no smile still and then I said oh drinks. We order our drinks he pass by many times with a face the is obvious he is miserable at this place. But a smile goes a long way  Keeps you from getting wrinkles and makes customers feel more appreciated. There was also another male employee who did not acknowledge me after he clearly saw I was trying to get Brandys attention. No smile from him at this visit I felt ignored, unappreciated and like they were doing me a favor which I'm paying for food should get an appropriate treat I think I'm not asking for much and all up in my table. I work in customer service and smiling is always a must no matter your day how busy or how boring or your personal problems home or with your employer. All I'm trying to say is training staff to smile and be more attentive would not hurt. One more thing, all employees should would wear at least same time and color of shirt I think. Brandy was excellent though left her a good tip."}
{"text":"No thank you! Not a fan of cold, super greasy unflavored pizza. Price reflects the reason why the pizza tastes nasty."}
{"text":"Their pizza is awesome! I love their dough. You can't really go wrong with any of the items on the menu. The staff is very friendly as well."}
{"text":"We wanted to order the focaccia deep dish pizza, but when we called around 2pm for delivery at 6:30pm, they said they can't do it because it takes them 24 hours to make it. SERIOUSLY? 24 hours to make a pizza? I know it was large, but I could raise a cow and make my own cheese in that time period! It's weird because my friend had it before and definitely did not have to call it in any more than 10 hours, let alone 24!  So we just got two medium pizzas and a large salad. All this fed 8 girls for $70. Seemed pretty expensive for cheese pizza, but it was good at least. All in all, 3.5 stars. It probably would have been higher if we got the focaccia pizza!"}
{"text":"Ok so this is no seriously pie (for those of you from the pacific northwest) but better than pizza hut!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good. Sundays Thursdays half off at Elis Island Casino. Good deal.Have not tried other items on the menue. I am not happy with casino or its management.  But called Metro, ordered 2 pizzas and was ready when I arrive. Very good quality."}
{"text":"Food is always excellent!! Service can sometimes be not so great. I never see a manager checking on customers and servers seem to forget about customers. If they fixed that problem, I will give them a 5 star."}
{"text":"Ordered Seafood Fra Diavolo pizza to go. As usual, great pizza."}
{"text":"So today's decided to go to Metro Pizza for so quality pizza for once. I normally go here when I'm craving quality pizza. So being the good helper that I am I checked in as soon as I got there and I was awarded with free drink with the regular price of any food.    It's hot in Vegas so I was licking my chops at this coupon.  So I go to pick up my pizza and so the cashier (her name was Susan) my coupon for 1st time check in.  It seems like she took pleasure out of denying me a free soda with the purchase of a $30.00 pizza.  She stated that its only with a dine in meal.  I then showed her the coupon and it stated nothing about only dine in and her response was \"we'll that's what it's meant for\".   I could've pushed the issue but I decided I'll just write about experience and let people know about Susan at this location. One thing I forgot to mention when I initially walked up to wait in line a customer was there talking with Susan that had already paid and they spent the next 5 minutes talking about meals on wheels and delivery issues.  I decided to sit down and wait since she was obviously not in a rush to help me out.   Overall the pizza was good though.  The service to get the pizza was horrible.   Good luck helpers"}
{"text":"Took my family here & had the slowest service and surprising because hardly anyone was there. Ordered an appetizer only to be told the cook didn't make it so it would come out with the pizza. I had to cancel the order and just ate the pizza. Ordered the Gotham and it wasn't anything special and daughter ordered Mac N Cheese and it was more like watery cheese soup with undercooked noodles. I will never eat here again nor would I recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"I think Metro Pizza is worth 5 stars for what it is. Delicious pizza and fast food! This place has decent prices, relative to the other pizza places, and delivery is super quick. They also take interac on delivery, which is a huge bonus!  I love their poutines and club sandwiches. Their pizza is also great. They don't skimp on toppings like some other places. The staff is always very friendly.  I have never had a delivery as messed up as the first reviewer posted and I have ordered from Metro many, many times. It looks to me like it was more an issue during the delivery than a restaurant quality issue. The delivery driver may have accidentally tipped the box. Oh well, accidents happen. I would definitely give this place a chance if you are thinking about it!"}
{"text":"I'm sure all of us have eaten a lot of pizza and have had amazingly delicious pizza and horrible pizza experiences. I am no different and compared to other pizzas I would rate this one as OK. 6 out of 10. Average pizza place."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday around 1700 (5pm) and was told the wait would be about 30-45 min. We waited and hour and 10 min. Once seated in our oversized but comfortable booth we had a young male waiter who was very pleasant and professional but not overly excited which was nice bc this made us comfortable with him somehow. We got our drinks for our party of 6 and baskets of warm sesame white bread for either side of the table within 5 min of sitting. He also mentioned that week nights are much better nights to bring your larger groups since they are always slammed on weekends. We ordered the 16\"Gotham pizza, a small pepperoni, and the 40 wings. Everything came out fresh in less then 30 min.  Wings were just ok for me, i thought the mild sauce was extremely sour but the hot was decent just bc it was less of that tangy flavor. My husband and son enjoyed them and they came with a decent amount of ranch. The pizza is definitely worth the wait! Flavor wise it was up there with the best of them. I did get a slice of pizza that had a piece of cardboard box in it, most likely from a pizza box. I thought it was a mushroom but realized it wasn't quickly after. Wasn't a deal breaker or anything, pizza was still edible and my waiter and the mgr apologized and made a genuine effort to make sure we were happy customer and even gave us a small discount. I'm giving them 4 stars only for having to pile on top of people in the waiting area. It's not so much the waiting but the waiting in a confined space with small children. It was a very uncomfortable 70 min, so that's a star deduction. I'm also a fan of better prices. I love a better deal! ?On all three of those items plus drinks we spent $75 only bc $12 was subtracted for the box in my . All in all, i would eat there again."}
{"text":"The best salad of your life will be the pasta salad with the best salad dressing of your life which is the honey cayenne salad dressing. Lettuce, tri color rotini, some cheese and breaded chicken.....simple but heaven on your taste buds. I have ordered this salad for years and it never disappoints anyone who has had a bite! The stuffed pizzas are also authentic, filling and delicious. We had the Cisero stuffed pizza with ricotta, meatballs and mozzarella dipped in meat sauce and ranch. The nuclear fries, garlic knots and the meatball sliders on garlic knots are killer too. Whoa am i full of happiness! The restaurant is cozy and the service has always been superb. FYI i am pregnant and i rarely get such satisfaction from food lately so when i say this was good, believe me! Go during happy hour, between 2-5pm i believe, when pizzas are half off!!!!!  They also have a different promo each day based off of your profession, attire or name so check it out and pick the day to go."}
{"text":"I grew up eating here at Metro Pizza. I love the feel when entering. Yes, it looks like the 80's with a lot of neon but I love that! It takes me back to being a kid and floods my mind with awesome memories.  The meatball sliders are a must. Please at least try them! They are almost $10 but worth it.They are made with garlic knots as the bun YUM! Ask about the daily specials. They have a printed calender telling you what special is each day that you can take home. They have it up on their website but I find it isn't updated regularly.  I recommend the stuffed pizzas they are so darn good! You can place your order for pick-up if you don't want or have time to eat inside."}
{"text":"I met a friend here for lunch and even though they had a good amount of customers we were still seated right away and service was good. One of the owners was there and he came over a couple of times to check on us and make sure we were happy with everything. Indeed we were because the pizza tasted just as good as it always does. They have tables as well booths and an area for larger groups. I love the complimentary bread they bring to each table and it's nice to have something to nibble on while the pizza is being made. They serve several types of pizza and some take longer than others.   Modesto ($27.50 for large) - Roasted Mushrooms, Garlic, Roma Tomatoes and Fresh Basil. You have the option to add sausage for free so we decided to get it on half of the pizza. The crust held the toppings well and and the pizza just tasted great overall. This pizza as well all of the specialty pizzas can be ordered small size, not just large. I've ordered the smaller pizzas to-go and it still tasted good and was hot when I got home.   They have a calendar with a different special on it each day every month. You can check their website or just ask for one, they are usually already on the tables.  Catering is also offered and phone orders are accepted for to-go orders. The lunch specials here (mon-fri until 2 pm) are worth checking out and include a drink."}
{"text":"With all of the things that come and go in Vegas, thank the pizza heavens that Metro Pizza is still around! I recently met up with a group of friends here to support Three Square by participating in Metro Pizza's Slice Out Hunger $1 pizza slice night. I let them know I would have a party of 18 and they were able to accommodate our large group no problem. Earlier this year I attended the $1 slice night at the Decatur (retro metro) location and while it was tasty, they only offered pepperoni and cheese slices. This time we could choose from like 8 different pizzas! They had all the pizzas set up in the bar area and after paying the suggested $5, I was given 5 tickets redeemable for 5 slices. I have to say this not only supported a great cause, but it allowed us to try several types of pizza at such an affordable price. There was a guy who checked on us from time to time and he was friendly, but getting drink refills was not so easy which could have been due to the amount of people on this particular night.  Metro Pizza offers several types of pizza baked different ways and they do also have pasta, salad and the Garlic Knot Meatball Sliders are a must try. On this last visit I tried a slice each of 5 different pizzas and all were pretty darn tasty. The Pumpkin Spice Pizza smelled wonderful and those that tried it in our group seemed to like it. The 86th Street Square Pie is very good if you like a thicker Sicilian type pizza.   Check their website for the monthly calendar to see what specials are happening each day. They have 4 different lunch specials around $10 that include a drink"}
{"text":"Yay!!!! So glad this location is finally open!!!!! Being from Vegas I grew up eating at Metro Pizza. Who from here didn't?!?!  The pizza is so darn good that we would drive across town to the Flamingo or Trop location because it tasted that good. So, to have one after all these years right in the neighborhood is just such a bonus!  I will say this. The parking is odd. They have 2 separate doors. One is for take out orders and the other is for being seated inside the restaurant to eat. It isn't well marked so either door could look like either door. We parked near the take out and were eating inside. We needed a handicapped spot. The curb you step onto from the parking lot to go inside is very high. Please be careful of this anybody could easily trip and fall. I believe it could be meant to be a ramp for wheelchairs but when walking you have no choice but to step over it and it could easily be missed if your talking or looking around.  The inside is huge! There were tons of staff hustling around inside. They have a bar so you can just pop in for a drink or even have a drink before being seated or waiting on someone. There is a hostess stand where you wait to be seated and we were greeted and seated right away. A moment later a bread basket was dropped off at the table. Yum! The server came to take our drink orders and she was very friendly, nice and took great care of us.   We ordered some \"Garlic Knots\". Delish!  They have meatball sliders that I have had in the past and they use the garlic knots for the bread you should give those a try!  I had the \"South Side\". It is a stuffed pizza and SO good! It has 3 cheeses (mozzarella, ricotta, romano) and came with a side of sauce. I love their sauce! I ordered the individual size but let me tell you it is so stuffed with cheese that this is a sharable or a take home for another meal kind of a pizza!   The inside is very clean. The moment after someone leaves they are wiping down the tables and everything on it.   They have a monthly calendar that has daily specials. You can get one inside any restaurant or directly from there website. You can also follow them on facebook.  We were very pleased and will for sure be back!"}
{"text":"new york style pizza perfected - slightly sweet, amazingly thin crust with just the right amount of sauce, fresh mozzarella, and rotating, seemingly random toppings. grab a slice and order a cup of their famous, house-brewed root beer or beer for less than 5 bucks... delicious!"}
{"text":"Always good pizza if you don't like it greasy don't come here however I do I just got a quick large pepperoni on Monday - Thursday 2:30 to 4:30 every pizza is half off so a really big pizza for a pretty fair price  it was good as usual I guess if your really into authentic Italian pizza the cheese is pretty normal nothing extravagant as well as the sauce but it works for me, I really enjoyed much better than any dominoes, papa johns or something like that and pretty much the same price especially Monday - Thursday so stop by and try for yourself instead of crappy quick places such as those also the decor is adorable I love the old school vibe. Will come back plenty more times ;)."}
{"text":"4 of us enjoyed dinner at Metro last night. Service was good. The pizza was very good, the 'hot' chicken wings tasted great, but were closer to mild than hot. My wife had the sliders and she said the meatball sliders were good but she did not like the shrimp sliders."}
{"text":"Finally decided to try out Metro Pizza tonight and we were not disappointed.  The hostess/host were super friendly.  They were giving out Parmesan chips to snack on in the waiting area.  The bartender was super nice as well.  We ordered -garlic romano fries:  these were piping hot upon arrival.  We dipped these into ranch and it was yummy. -chicken wings: asked that chicken wings be well done, with the hot sauce on the side.  Came out just like how we asked for it.  Yay!  points for Zip (our waiter, but we gave him that nickname since he was quick and responsive) for getting it right.  These were yummy too. -Honolulu Pizza: with anchovies.  We were afraid that the individual would be too small so went w/the large.  I ate half of my slice and was FULL.  It was very delicious, and I will get to eat the rest of the pizza for the next 2-3 days.  yay, no need to cook! -Tiramisu:  not balanced.  The mascarpone cheese overpowered the coffee taste.  I wouldn't order this again.  Forgot to mention that they give you a basket of warm crisp on the outside/fluffy in the inside bread, with butter.  I took some of this to go too.    Overall, this place is wonderful, especially since it's right around the corner.  Definitely recommend to those who wants yummy pizza and friendly service."}
{"text":"BOMBBBBB!!!! I recently went to las vegas to celebrate my birthday and met up with my cousin for lunch at metro pizza and honestly this is one of the best pizzas i have ever sunk my teeth into! I ordered the green valley individual and the portion was really generous and huge! The green valley pizza had sun dried tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, olives, and zucchinis! All of the ingredients were really fresh and the pizza was not oily at all so i didnt feel guilty for indulging in it! haha~ my cousin ordered the balsamic vinaigrette salad and my friends ordered the Margarita pizza and the Gotham pizza, which were all really delicious! They are really generous with their toppings and service is quite friendly too.   I wish i lived closer to metro pizza but then again maybe I will just have to visit my cousin more often since she has great taste in food~! :)"}
{"text":"Average pizza. The restaurant is a better choice. Secret pizza is Las Vegas best!  The slice here is decent price for a casino, small slice though...."}
{"text":"Great pizza.  Take advantage of the deal they often have M-Th 2:30-4:30pm when pizzas are half price.  Yummy bread.  Great pasta pie and pepperoni pizza.  Tropicana is the best location."}
{"text":"Went for lunch. This is a local favorite. The meatball sliders are a big hit and pizza is a little pricey but worth it.  Staff was friendly. Would come back again."}
{"text":"HOLY PIZZA.......this place is my favorite! (sigh)  So here's my \"CAN'T MISS\" food highlights: ~Fried Mozzarella ~Garlic knots! ~Steinbrenner Calzone ~BBQ Chicken Calzone ~The LOOP..............= happiness!    ;) ~The Skyline ~The Pasta Pie ~The MODESTO............UH-MAY-ZING! ~Tiramisu ~Cannolis  I've been eating here easily since elementary school and last I checked, I've been out of high school for 11 years.......you do the math!  This is my FAMILIES go-to dirty CARB indulgence!  In fact, this place is greatly in the running for the BIRTHDAY dinner next month!!!  =)   Don't let this particular location detour from what your stomach will thank you for.  It's OLD but it definitely has character.  The staff is welcoming and the SAME cooks have been working there for YEARS!  That in itself has to say something about the place!  Oh, P.S. They do PIZZA MAKING CLASSES at their UNLV location! How cool is that!?!?!? =) Count me in!"}
{"text":"You will not find better pizza in Vegas than Metro, in my opinion."}
{"text":"Enjoyed two pizzas via take out last night. I thought that the pizzas were decent and was impressed that they were ready when we arrived. The restaurant was packed and about 30 people were waiting for tables. It certainly seems like a popular place."}
{"text":"What a great local pizza joint. The pizza was great and priced just right. They have daily specials too. Next time we come I am going to try the  sangria as I see lots of people drinking it."}
{"text":"I'm always really happy with my deliveries that come from Metro. We love their pizza and their small size is perfect for two people. They have great wings and delicious cannoli too. I have tried their salads and am always left indifferent about them so that is not something I order.  Their deliveries are quick and the food is always hot. Ask about their football specials, they usually have a buy one get one 50% off!"}
{"text":"Great Service. Not too crowded most of the time. Very friendly staff and food was amazing. All made fresh. I never had an empty drink and the food came quickly without lack of quality. Highly recommend for Italian food."}
{"text":"Was craving pizza the other night and decided stop in as it's close to where we live. Sadly, I was really under impressed. I researched a bit on yelp before going to see what yelpers suggested. The thing I kept seeing was the garlic knots, which were really bland and hard. When we were seated initially, there was no silverware on the table and we had to ask two different people to get some. My boyfriend ordered the Gotham pizza and it came out cold and again was pretty bland. We only saw our server, Angela, twice throughout the meal. She took our food order then dropped the bill. The food is overpriced for what you are getting. Service was minimal and food was underwhelming."}
{"text":"This is a good place to eat. In the past I've had delivery to work, this was my first time inside the restaurant. I was very surprised on how modern and clean the place looked. I wait staff was very friendly and helpful. Its a pretty big menu with lots of good choices. Our food was very tasty and fresh. Good sized portions. Tasty pizza. Took my family and they like it. Will go back again and again. Only down side,  the music is too loud."}
{"text":"We had a great experience here for dinner.  First of all, the red sauce is amazing. Fresh and flavorful. Second of all, you MUST try the Spumoni Pie. I think I'm officially hooked. I'll crave this in the near future for sure.  We had the calamari for an appetizer-the calamari was fresh, the breading was light and perfectly fried. It's a must have if you love calamari. We had the Olde New York pizza and the baked ziti for our dinner-both were so good! You can't go wrong with either.  Looking forward to trying the calzone we are bringing home (we are total gluttons).   Good service, beer & wine, great food and a casual ambiance-with Spumoni Pie!! Who could ask for more?"}
{"text":"This place never fails to satisfy,the best traditional pizza in Las Vegas.  It's a small chain."}
{"text":"I have been here many times before, and I promise I won't come back. Jesus gulliver was rude and would not honor what the girl told me the special was on the phone ten minutes prior. He told me he didn't care and would not care if the owner knows. Last year I came here for my birthday and the owner was there and was a very nice man. I find it hard to believe that any business owner would want their business ran that way. *owner has since called an apologized I will update after tonight, he invited us back in.*"}
{"text":"Amazing service and even better food. Thanks so much for making our dinner it was delicious John!   We will definitely be back soon, this place has the best nuclear fries and pizza :)"}
{"text":"i wouldn't describe with a style because it is different. It's a little thicker than New York stlye and has a doughy texture I always go with the mushroom topping. They are sauted mushrooms and just add the perfect taste to the pizza. Metro has a calander where they have different specials for different occasions just about every day. I always order during football season because on Sundays they offer buy one get one with up to three toppings on each. It helps because they are a bit pricy."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location and others around town for over 15 years. Metro is my go to pizzeria when I have relatives and friends in town. I have taken the pizza class with my meet up group 3 times. My experience yesterday may warrant a change in Pizzerias. I ordered 1 large cheese and mushroom and 1 large cheese, sausage and bell pepper for carry-out. They brought my pizzas out and he had me check them. This must have been the skimpiest pizza from metro I've ever had. When you order a pizza with just one or a few toppings shouldn't it cover the pizza just as much as if I ordered a pizza with lots of different toppings like a combination? A large has 8 slices. I could have taken all the mushrooms off the pizza and it wouldn't have covered  2 slices.  The same for the sausage and bell pepper. Okay, I get it...sausage is more expensive and may not give  them a higher profit margin in their food cost but seriously, mushrooms and bell pepper? It crossed my mind at that moment to not pay for them and express my dissatisfaction but I actually had out-of-state relatives waiting for me at home. If their \"buy 1 get 2nd half off large pizzas\" are at this subpar quality would I have received a pizza that had generous toppings if I paid full price? No thanks, I'd prefer the latter. With embarrassment, I served the pizzas to my guests. I'm sure they were thinking, \"this is what she was raving about?\""}
{"text":"I've been going to Metro Pizza ever since I can remember. My whole family and I love this place, we usually go to Flamingo and Decatur location but this location is closer to me! No matter what location you go to it's still same good food. I recommend ordering the Meat Lovers pizza and pasta salad, it will feed a familt of 4."}
{"text":"Been coming here with my family since I was little. Definitely the best pizza in town when I'm here my family we order the Gotham Pizza and meat lovers pizza! The staff here is amazing they treat you like family super awesome people! Whenever my friends come into town I always take him to Metro Pizza!!"}
{"text":"WARNING: do NOT eat the gluten free pizza here if you have celiac disease ! You will get sick even if you speak to a manager first . They do not take it seriously, trust me. I learned the hard way . Plus they don't cook the pizza all the way anyway  also , they need all new management & staff at this location. Definitely gone & going downhill . Will not be returning .   12-30-17 Update : they still suck! Thought we'd try again! Even worse now . Save your $ & patience"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed metro. They had a fun atmosphere, the food was delicious, and the price was fair. They were a bit slower than we would have liked and our server could have been more attentive but overall, we would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I took my kids here because of the rave reviews on Yelp, but it did not deliver on the expectations. Our salad didn't show up until I asked about it when they delivered our pizza. (but they did comp this without me asking them to). The waiter said he didn't realize it hadn't come out...but that's the waiter's job- to make sure we get our food. My kids' pizzas were good - and free (Kids ate free that night) but my \"Individual\" pizza was soggy so I sent it back. They tried to make it right but the cooked spinach on the pizza just makes the dough too soggy. (They should use fresh spinach!) The individual pizza could easily feed 2 adults with a salad on the side for dinner. Service was very friendly and they did their best to make up for the mistakes, but the food was disappointing. (except the Caesar salad, when it did come, was very good.)"}
{"text":"Been here once, didn't stand out to me seemed like typical run of the mill pizza spot. Seems like a good place to take the family or groups."}
{"text":"This review is for pick up only.   What's going on here? This local chain seems to be spreading themselves thin. I've been to their other location on the eastside and found their pizza to be just okay.. But damn those garlic knots were tough as rhymes with (hockey) puck.. Pretty sure they were old.   To top it all off, according to the girlfriend, they were rude up front and too preoccupied with their cellphones to give a damn. Eh, it's all good though cause we need establishments such as these to remind us of good food and service when we see it."}
{"text":"Metro Pizza has been around for a long time and has always served up pretty good pizza, but the age of the restaurant is showing and the environment needs a refresh.  The last time I was there was a few years ago, but this visit I could certainly tell that the place isn't what it used to be.    However, the service was still great, but the pizza was soggy.  This could have been an off night for the restaurant but I probably won't visit this particular spot for a while."}
{"text":"I have only been to this location one time. They offer discounts for fire fighters on certain days of the week so I would call and ask what days they offer that and different discounts. I sat at the bar so I could watch a game that was on that night and they forgot all about our food. We waited for 40 minutes when the waitress finally noticed that we didn't have our food yet. Once we got our food it was pretty tasty but I might have been bias because by the time I got my food I was extremely hungry."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant. The pizza is delicious . The staff is always pleasant. Love going on the days kids get to make their own pizza helps them get excited to eat."}
{"text":"Pizza quality isn't consistent. Only eaten twice before but my most recent take out order was disappointing. Ordered a large pepperoni with pineapples and extra sauce, along with garlic knots. The pizza dough nor the garlic knots were cooked all the way. And some how there was a miscommunication. Instead of extra sauce, there was extra cheese - enough to choke a horse! For the price, we were expecting better quality or better attention to the results. Undercooked food is unpleasant."}
{"text":"Couple of months ago I would have given 4 star rating but what is going on here?  Pizza gone done a notch and the service has too.  There are loads of staff running around but management needs to listen to customers and provide quality, not quantity.  Maybe they forgot this on their way up the pizza ladder.  There are great other pizzerias to try in this town."}
{"text":"Metro is my first choice for pizza in Henderson.  It's almost always pretty busy (a great sign in this economy), and the pizza itself has the BEST taste!  I like the San Genaro pie, but have gotten many other kinds and have never been let down.  We always go in to order the take out pie, and then sit at the bar while we wait.  The bartenders are always very friendly & they have great beer, wine & sangria.  I ordered the wings once, and was not very impressed - they were kind of soggy when I got home.  BUT - the pizza is 5 stars, and that's what really matters, right?  Lastly, the gelato is out-of-this-world....You MUST try the Sea Salt Caramel Gelato.  It's the BEST!  We make a point to eat at Metro once or twice a month."}
{"text":"I think this place is great i could order from a large variety menu and its all italian babyy !! :)"}
{"text":"New to the NW Las Vegas area and after hearing so many good things about Metro Pizza, I had to check it out! Everyone was right: great food, service, cleanliness.  And I absolutely love the gelato bar!!"}
{"text":"This place got it! Born and raised in nyc listen to your boi this pizza is on point! Plus if you want dirt cheap drinks across to the casino bar, show up!"}
{"text":"tucked away in a strip mall location i ran into this place while looking for a quick bite.  yes, it feels like stepping back in time but hey, i'm here for the food/service not the decor. :P the salad hit the right spot along side the bread & butter, i washed it all down with an iced cold tea.  service was on point even tho it was lunch time and a bit slow.  i'll keep this place in mind when i'm working in this area next time."}
{"text":"Nothing better to end the day than a belly full of Metro Pizza.  Omar treated us well and the pizza was amazing as always.  It's a definite must have when in the area."}
{"text":"First visit to any Metro Pizza.  The bread they give you to start the meal with is killer and don't fill up on it!  The calamari is very good, it is a different breading than I am used to but is makes an incredible difference. Nice and tender not over cooked not undercooked and there is a lot of it there.   We ordered the pantheon pizza. I am not usually a fan of white sauce pizzas but let me tell you this one is extremely good! I would have it again, and I was hesitant to order it at first. The crust is light and crispy without being over cooked. The sauce is just right and the toppings are spot on.   The service was excellent as well"}
{"text":"Good food & friendly service! Love this neighborhood pizza place. Our server was wonderful when there was a mistake with our appetizers- he apologized and made the whole night by sending us dessert. We will definitely be back! Thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. A locally owned pizza place that has been here for years. I love the nuclear fries with ranch dressing. Speaking of ranch dressing they make it themselves and sell it by the bottle. I personally like the pizza cut in squares. By far the best pizza in town! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Extremely rude staff member. When I approached to ask a question, he Would not even take the time to turn around and address me like a man. Needless to say, that's the extent of my visit. Will never be back! Way too many options to tolerate this treatment."}
{"text":"I get tired of people complaining about the lack of good pizza in Vegas!  Metro pizza has a varied menu to fit anyone's pizza needs.  From delicious crispy standard crust to stuffed pizza pies if you can't find anything you like then that's on you.  I decided to try the flying piggle pizza and it was great.  Pulled pork, bbq sauce, deep fried onions, and pickles on a sweet crust brought two of my favorite foods together.  If your not into pizza the baked ziti was large enough to feed four people and was pretty good for the price.  I always recommend starting with the garlic romano fries or if you're in the mood for spice the nuclear fries are pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Good food and great service!  It was our first time to Metro Pizza.  We were there on a Saturday afternoon and seated in the bar area, which really isn't that separated from the rest of the dining room.  Our server, also the bartender Tony greeted us quickly and was great at suggesting some pizza choices.  We went with the Gotham.  Cooked perfect.  Loved getting some bread to start out the meal  My beer was cold, Tony shared some good jokes, great family atmosphere.  Thanks to Tony we will be back for sure!."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!! You always know if you are in the right place when you walk into a packed restaurant!!! The garlic balls are amazing, the beer is cold, and the pizza is perfect!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location a few times and every time it's been a good experience. I guess this week was a Disney theme as they had posters and characters hanging from the ceiling. They also had Disney music playing which brought back memories. Right away my 3 year old recognize the songs.   Anyways we came on a Saturday night and it was fairly busy. Right away Keanu greeted us and walked us to our seat. We where given complementary bread with butter which was nice and hot and tasted great, I could eat that stuff all day. I order the 10 piece Hot Wings, my kid order Mac and Cheese and my Wife got Calamari. The food came in a good time about 15 mins after we order which is totally normal. The ranch dressing is the bomb, I actually want to buy a bottle of it and take it home. Every thing tasted great and the staff was amazing. Even though he was busy our waiter Keanu was very nice and professional, answered all our questions and even gave my daughter crayons and a crossword puzzle to keep her busy. Definitely will be coming back."}
{"text":"Best best pizza in Vegas! I lived in Italy this is the closet I have found to Italy!!! Awesome salads! Awesome service!!"}
{"text":"Okay so it's no secret- I love pizza! And I used to love Metro Pizza but lately I find their food to be very inconsistent. In all fairness their garlic knots are superb, salads so-so. It's the pizza that Frustrates me because I never know if it will be good. Sometimes it's great but sometimes it's just not edible. Today it was served barely warm with the cheese not completely melted-come on-are they trying to save power or maybe the oven is failing? Nevertheless, I can't wholeheartedly recommend them because of their inconsistency. I think there are some other good pizza places in Vegas- Metro is just so-so. You be the judge; however, if you expect consistency go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Decent pizzas spot.  I liked it fine. I'm not sure why I didn't love it. Good customer service.  Looks like a pizza/Italian restaurant should.  Beer, wine and dessert.  I got the Loop stuffed Pizza.  It was slightly doughy for my taste but should reheat nicely."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an escape of the hustle and bustle of Las Vegas, Ellis Island is the best place to visit - once here, make sure to make a stop at Metro! The NY style pizza here is incredibly satisfying. We're talking about a perfectly thin crust with just the right amount of cheese and toppings, served piping hot! Make sure to pair it with one of the cheap yet carefully crafted beers from the bar. I believe on Sundays they have a two for one special, which can make the return crawl, I mean drive, to LA much better."}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location several times.  I normally order a specialty salad and a pizza.  My food is always delicious...no complaints from me!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large(16\") pizza with Pepperoni, Black Olives, and Mushrooms for take out. It has an excellent chewy crust with very good toppings. It had a little too much sauce for my wife but the rest of us really enjoyed it. The cost was a bit high for a 3 topping pizza ($24.80) but if you eat in between 2:30 and 4:30 Monday thru Thursdays you can buy any pizza for HALF OFF. Now that is a great deal for a pizza of this caliber."}
{"text":"9/13/2017  I went to the Metro Pizza  Tropicana location for their \"Early Bird Special\". They advertise 50% off all Pizzas (except the 86th St. Square Pie and any stuffed pizzas) between 2:30 - 4:30 Mondays thru Thursdays all month.  I was seated immediately and was brought a menu and a small loaf of freshly baked bread with butter.  I reviewed their extensive menu and I ordered a large thin crust pizza with Pepperoni, Sausage, Hamburger and Anchovies with a Coke.  The pizza came quickly and was cooked perfectly with the crust being crispy despite all the toppings and cheese.  A fresh drink was brought to the table without being requested and the service was top notch.  I was only able to eat 2 pieces due to the size of the pizza and took the rest home to be enjoyed later.  I was asked if everything was okay and if I needed any thing several times without being pestered.  The restaurant was clean, it had a homey feel and there were several TV's throughout the place that were visible.  I would recommend this location for good pizza, atmosphere and service."}
{"text":"If you are looking for stuffed pizza, don't go here. I don't know what the fuck this is. But, their pizza license should be revoked."}
{"text":"Went with some friends and family and was kind of underwhelmed. The service was ok but the food was forgettable. I split a 9\" Milano pizza and a dish of spaghetti. I couldn't really taste much ricotta on the pizza and felt there was too much oil on top. Plus there was hardly any spinach at all. Crust was decent but overall it just didn't impress me."}
{"text":"Great costumer service, unfortunately the pizza was very plain, I will stick with CPK."}
{"text":"Went with family with in-law's from out of town. No one left disappointed. I ate the Stockyard, a stuffed pizza. To say I left with a stuffed tummy would be an understatement."}
{"text":"I am in love with this pizza place. I dream of the menu and the gelato. It is our favorite place to take the kids. We can't go too often because the prices are a little expensive.... But really for the quality they should be. I'm having trouble figuring out if they deliver. If they did, I would be in more trouble. We have tried a variety of items- fried mozzarella appetizer, yummy but crunchy, the marinara is great with it. We tried the seafood Fra Diavolo pizza- also awesome but not the best for reheating because the calamari gets a little weird. My kids have destroyed the kids menu options and they are happy with them. We had the Old New York and the Spring Street as well. Man the sausage on the pizza is killer! My one disappointment would be the cannoli. A little more delicate, larger and with more filling and I could really wreck myself!"}
{"text":"Had lunch at metro today and the server was so inattentive we had to ask for refills on our water and tea. Took forever to get our food. I ordered chicken fingers and the server dropped the food and walked away and proceeded to chat with the other employees near the kitchen and far away from our table. I turned in my seat several times to get his attention since my chicken fingers were lukewarm at best.  I would have sent them back but the server never checked in with us again. We were seated near the the hostess stand and had to ask her for our check. Where is the manager?"}
{"text":"So, I was at work when my family went to Metro Pizza . I asked Maddie,  age 10 and Rachel,  age 8 to describe it.  Porter: How many stars for Metro Pizza? Maddie: Five [5] Porter: Why? Maddie: Pizza  [Stockyard] was amazing, over the top and out of this world. Service was too good to be described.  Porter: How many stars for Metro Pizza? Rachel: Five [5] Porter: Why? Rachel: I had the Gothem which was Awesome, delicious and messy fun because of extra sauce that I asked for.  I have personally been to Metro Pizza three times now. Three locations too.   The East Side / UNLV location was busy after a show at The Thomas And Mack Center. Great professionalism by the staff. I had the Stockyard and friends were shocked by the serving size.  The WEST Side location reminds me of Miami Vice with its fun decor.   The Northwest location is slower business wise, but the kids love the place as you can read. The Northwest location changes decor every now and then which helps create a reason to return. As if the food wasn't cause enough.   Special thanks to my daughters, Maddie and Rachel for helping create this review."}
{"text":"The best pizza is the Triple Play sausage.......about 5 lbs of great sausage on the small size pie! If you go in M-F between 2:30 & 4:30 the pizza's are half price! You have to check it out!"}
{"text":"Oh this is such a sad day...Have not been to this spot in a couple of years and thought to stop in with some friends for a late afternoon lunch. Before I even get to the service and the meal; I'm having an even tougher time getting past what I am sitting here looking at.   DIRTY FILTY WINDOW BLINDS (ON ALL THE WINDOWS) WITH NASTY OLD FOOD, BODILY FLUIDS, DUST, KID SPIT & WHATEVER ELSE HAS BEEN SITTING ON THEM FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS!   Sorry for the ALL CAPS but I really wanted to emphasize my anger and disgust about this initial impression. I have taken several photos that I am attaching to this review to make my reference pointedly clear.   After sitting there with my friends discussing how ultimately GROSS this was to look at; were then provided a basket of bread to start with. Eventually the lavender haired waitress (btw really?) approached us to take our order. We ordered a large Gotham pizza, some salads and some beverages.  Salads were simple and nothing noteworthy to mention. The pizza arrived about 30 minutes later; it was watery, unevenly cooked, toppings totally scattered unevenly so that some pieces had 2 toppings while others had 5. Come on guys....lets take the time to craft a pizza; not just throw crap all over the place making it look like a sorry mess. This pizza was just simply a poor result of laziness.  Service turned into a non-existent form once the waitress knew that we weren't ordering tons of high dollar items. Again we just simply wanted a lighter meal of just pizza and salads. She was obviously looking for a bigger ticket tonight. Unfortunately I always tip good service a $20. in a place like this; but NOT this time when service was not even there. No refills, no asking how everything was, no checking back, no nothing!  What's super sad is that the owners of this place used to really care about the service, the cleanliness, the value for the dollar and for the quality of the food. Obviously they are not around watching over this restaurant like they used to. Perhaps this is why the place seemed so dead for a Sunday early evening. Perhaps this place has ultimately now become a kid-centric pizza shop; where parents take their children to spit food upon the window blinds. Sadly that's the impression that I got out of this last visit; since the obvious lack of cleanliness in such an upscale neighborhood leaves me shaking my head.  I simply would no longer bother eating at this restaurant as there are simply way too many awesome pizza places in town. BTW Giordanos from Chicago has just arrived on the strip for those craving serious awesomeness! Best of luck to the \"Pizza Guys\" moving forward. I truly hope that you bring back your focus to what you once were in this town."}
{"text":"Omg some of the best pizza in town. Their modesto pizza is the bomb! I am not gonna lie, this is some of the best!"}
{"text":"Simply one of the best pizzas put together!hot and delicious! The cheese just makes it happen."}
{"text":"Good Pizza joint, good pizza and food for reasonable price for what you get. Kids like it. If you want to keep your kids entertained while you wait for your food ask for some dough...they will give you some for the table to play with."}
{"text":"Pretty dang good Italian food! Then again why wouldn't a girl be happy stuffing her face with meatballs and sausages?  Had work lunch catered by this place. The garlic bread rolls should be named crack rolls because I couldn't stop eating them. They were soft and baked to prefection with just the right amount of garlic butter. There goes my no carb diet... out the window! To make matters worse or better depending on how you see it, the long, fat sausage are truly a girls best friend... thick and juicy, warm and dripping pesto sauce. If that's not enough to make a girl happy, there's some very large meatballs for the perfect happy ending.   My name is Dani and I specialize in food porn, read my reviews responsibly. -wink-"}
{"text":"The food is great, and service is usually pretty good.  My only complaint is the noise level.  The acoustics of this place are lousy!"}
{"text":"I don't give many 5 stars, in fact,  I'm like the Josh Bell of food reviewers. (See if anyone gets that one)  For me, good pizza crust is a must and the sauce is boss. Yes I'm poetic about it because that's what this pizza is, worthy of poems! The crust is crispy with bit of chewiness where it matters. The sauce is tangy and not overly sweet, just the way it should be. Yes, real cheese (duh) and ingredients galore are all good.  The next best thing here are the garlic knot sliders. Little orbs of meaty love is what I call them. Highly recommended.  Never disappointed with the food here, and the staff is always friendly and service is fast.  By the way, for the at home chefs, you can buy dough and sauce here and give it a whirl at home. I've done it, not quite the same but close. Mostly because my GE oven doesn't quite compare to a commercial pizza oven...Still, worth a try."}
{"text":"mmmmm Pizza. You can never go wrong here. To me it's one of the best pies around. The crust, the sauce, the toppings. It all works for me and most people I know. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"In Vegas visiting family. My father in law ordered delivery from this place. I was very pleased with the Pizza, salad(the one with pears in it), and the huge manicotti dish. All were excellent and if I were a local this place would become a staple for me. Looks like the major complaints were about service. I wouldn't know."}

{"text":"This review is specifically for the takeout area. My previous review is being updated. I am happy to say that management has made some serious changes with staff and the takeout area is wonderful now! The young lady was very friendly and DID NOT leave out the ranch, red peppers, and parmesan cheese like I've experienced previously. She actually gave me extra! This was like a whole new Metro experience for me. As a paying customer, I'm very satisfied and pleased with the new changes.   Thank you Metro management!"}
{"text":"Didn't order anything fancy, just a small pizza with beef and black olives. Didn't particularly look appetizing nor did it taste appetizing. Doubtful I'll give it a second chance when there are so many other options. The glowing reviews here let me down, not my experience."}
{"text":"The pizza wasn't bad at all...I even went for a second slice...the roach I saw on the counter...not so much.  That is what comepletely turned me off.  We were at Ellis Island anyway and I was in serious need of food to try & soak up some of the alcohol so I figured why not.  Well, not again.  They get 2 stars because the quality of the pizza was decent and hit the spot...if it weren't for that they'd only get 1.  I know places have bugs that us customers never see.  But when it crawls out ON THE COUNTER where the guy is about to set down my slice...NO THANK YOU!"}
{"text":"I really don't get it, I guess. It wasn't that spectacular--it was just normal pizza that wasn't from Pizza Hut. It was similar in flavor to the giant slices of pizza at Costco or Sam's Club. Don't get me wrong, that pizza is good, but it's just pizza. It's not last-meal, greatest-thing-I-ever-ate, I-can't-wait-to-finish-it-all pizza."}
{"text":"I like to go on Tuesdays for half off on there pies, there appetizers are good I like there calamari it doesn't taste like rubber. They have many different pies to choose from the manhattan is good too and  they also make a pretty good Sicilian."}
{"text":"Dinner time is the play for pizza we always order the bathroom with no ground beef. Coming here for lunch has lunch specials with a small salad and a beverage nonalcoholic. We been coming here for years everything is fresh."}
{"text":"Ive been \"dragged\" here twice. Im really surprised it has so many good reviews, but then again, people love crappy food. Fast food and chain restaurants are recession-proof. This place reminds me of chuckee cheese. I think the food is horrible, but its always crowded, mostly with people with tons of kids. The service is unspeakable, even if you have lowered expectations for a pizza place. Very dirty feel of the place. It smells like sewer inside, like that dirty steaming floor drain smell. The servers run around with dirty plates, money and fresh food all in one round, just throwing dirty plates in bus-tubs, and walking around. They serve 12 beers on tap, and red and white wine. The bartender was so incompetent it was embarrassing to even watch.  She was so awful, I cringed."}
{"text":"Lots of my friends rave about this place so I was excited to finally give it a shot!!! Maybe they were having a bad day or maybe I'm just a pizza snob from NYC but to say I wasn't impressed is an understatement. First of all the place is really dusty. Looks like it's needs a spring cleaning.!!! The service was ok. Not terrible. And the pizza was overcooked. Borderline rubbery. It wasn't the worst pizza I've ever had but I won't be rushing back. The search for good pizza in Las Vegas continues!!!"}
{"text":"Easily the best pizza in Las Vegas.  There are so many different types of pizza to choose from!  If you love pizza, this is it.......you can get Chicago Style Deep Dish.....New York style thin, where you must fold the slice.....Sicilian style......whatever you like.  It's awesome and always packed.  I recommend showing up early or late....if you show up during peak lunch or dinner hours you'll be waiting a while.  it's worth the wait though."}
{"text":"My Girl introduced me to Metro Pizza and I have to say I love going there now. The pizza is hot, fresh and mmm mmm tasty.  One of my favorite things to order is the Antipasto platter. It is very fresh, the meats, cheeses olives and greens are a great way to start a meal. The only \"off\" thing I have had here is there minestrone soup, which tasted like a soupy pizza sauce more than how it should have tasted.   A few times though lately for the \"kids make it we bake it\" they have not had enough staff working to do it so the kids get sad, after a few \"WTF's\" from my Girl the server went ahead and brought out some stuff for the kids to make there mini pizzas.   All in all it is one of my favorite places here in Vegas for pizza, and worth a visit if you have never been there before and be sure to try the garlic knots!"}
{"text":"Food was very good... Had a margarita pizza and spaghetti and they have kids personal pizzas. Nice atmosphere, friendly servers. The pizza was amazing and the garlic knots and sauce are great too"}
{"text":"Been eating this pizza since i was a little kid love it so happy they have multiple locations I always order the Gotham pizza and their house salad"}
{"text":"The pizza was good - seating was substandard and uncomfortable.   And even for a pizza joint, it was extremely noisy with only a handful of customers."}
{"text":"The best or one of the best Pizzerias Around Las Vegas, enough said."}
{"text":"Out-freaking-standing.  The pizza was perfectly baked, fluffy thick crust that was crispy in all the right places and not too greasy. The toppings were excellent and the pre-meal table bread was even noteworthy.  Service was excellent, never had to ask for a refill. And they have daily specials for holidays, service workers, even for anyone with a certain name.   Overall, just a very cool local place that definitely has a good rep for its good eats. This particular location also has this cool 80s deco vibe that I really dig, and that's just gravy.  Check this place out! Best of Las Vegas for something like seven years running...and with good reason.  (Check in for a free soft drink, your entire party can check in and all get a free soda!)  We even came back a couple days later to eat again while we were still in town, turns out they don't open until 11, but they let us in 20 minutes early because they're just that nice.   A++ would dine again."}
{"text":"Super yummy, with options for those of us who don't do pizza (major points in my book!) A couple locations making it easily accessible for different parts of the city. Their gigantic cheese ravioli covered in Alfredo sauce was so good! They also have a pizza that our friend called the garbage or cheeseburger pizza (i can't remember) it had so much on it but was incredible!"}
{"text":"Been coming here since high school when my bff was the waitress at the Flamingo/Sandhill location. Been in love since. Hand-tossed circle of love. I always start out with the Tuscan salad-field of greens and marinated tomatoes, pears, bleu cheese crumbles, toasted walnuts and balsamic vinaigrette dressing, this dressing it outstanding and is available for purchase. My favorite pie, is the Metro Pizza, which is the thick crust pizza with extra cheese, and if a  different pizza catches your eye, and thick crust is your thing, you can request thicker crust for $2-4 extra. The ranch dressing here is fantastic, and it compliments the crust perfectly. (Don't hate me because I dip) The bread basket here I think is the best in town.   Also they have cooking classes, 3 hour classe are the second and last Tuesday of each month.                    (copied from website) $24.95 +tax   *Multi course meal and beverages.  *Recipes and methods for at home pizza making.  *In depth analysis of the history, methodology, ingredients and love of Pizza.  *Hands on training in dough making and stretching.  Who's in?????"}
{"text":"This use to be one of our favorites. Honestly, lately it hasn't been so good! Whenever we order for delivery for the past several months has been mistake after mistake. Today is just icing on the cake, our order amounted to $50. Now I will admit the pizza is usually great, but we ordered chicken fingers and they were burnt beyond belief! The worse part was that they tried to hide them below some wax paper so no one would see until it was to late! We also ordered regular wings that had no sauce on them! This use to be a weekly place that has become a bimonthly, and now I don't think ever again!"}
{"text":"Just moved from Chicago... we love their pizza & garlic knots. We tried the Modesto (added spinach and sausage). Really really good. Plus, while we waited for the pizza... played a few slots next door and won enough to cover our dinner. Win win!"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed. Go there all the time and usually everything is great but not this time. Food was very bland. The service was the worse part. Too almost five minutes to get a waiter and order something to drink after we already finished our bread. He was not friendly at all and did tell me a salad came with my meal and brought it about 30 seconds before my food with dressing I didn't want. Never checked on is till we were done, never got another drink and not even a thank you when he gave us the bill. Was not busy at all and am a really good tipper but not this time. There are too many good places around to get bad food and services which is too bad cause we really liked this place."}
{"text":"3/18/16- Busy as always, but our Olde New York pizza (sliced mozzarella, simmered tomato sauce, fresh basil & evoo) and dinner salad were both as delicious as ever.  The consistency of the food quality keeps us coming back again and again."}
{"text":"Some restaurants places just seem to work well, Metro Pizza is one of them..Consistent food and service makes dining here a pleasure, isn't that why we go out? I imagine it's very easy to spend a hundred dollars and more for simple, honest Italian food for 2 (w/out wine) in Las Vegas, but why?  It is nice to see the variety of families eating here, it is, as it should be!"}
{"text":"Best pizza you can get delivered in LV! Amazing food. Not a bad thing to ever say about them. I've ordered from them about 15/20 times. They are a little pricey but well worth every dollar. I guess you get what you pay for. I also love how when I call they already know what I want. They keep your past orders in their computer system. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Went in for some delicious pizza. The waitress Maria refused to seat us in any of the 5 open booths because we didn't have 4 people in our party. We even offered to move if a large party came in.  She refused and said she once got yelled at by management for seating too few customers there. When we asked to speak to a manager we were told one would be with us shortly but after waiting another 10 minutes we decided to just leave. I'm told the absentee managers name was Susan. I have been eating at metro pizza since I was a child. It is stupid to treat loyal customers this way."}
{"text":"I love their pizza and come here often. They have a great buy one get one free special on Thursdays and Sundays, the service is always good and fast. There isn't a lot of space to come in and sit down to eat your food but this place is inside a smokey, loud casino so I say take out is the best way to go."}
{"text":"My wife and I finally here last nite. Nice and roomy, service was great. Loved the pizza, awesome crust. We did have the calimari appetizer, not a fan of the cornmeal breading though. Overall definitely would come back."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza that I have so far in Las Vegas... reminded me of New York pizza.. it's the perfect taste .. & soft & right size of slice.. I only tried their mushroom slice pizza & a slice of pepperoni with jalapeños .. tasted so good... I will definitely be back & highly recommend to all.. U won't be disappointed .. the only thing is not much seat .. U need to either stand or share table if others don't mind.. but hey as long as the pizza taste good .. I don't care or mind to stand & eat..   soooooo good...."}
{"text":"Ive only had one favorite pizza place, and that's in my hometown that is too far away. But I found metro pizza, thanks to yelp. The sauce they use is so good and different. They're sesame bread is awesome and the seeds give it an unusual but tasty twist. Just don't call the number they have listed on google, it's wrong.   I'm really picky about my pizza, but this is the best so far. I always get Hawaiian, and it's always fresh and yummy. :)"}
{"text":"I ate here in the airport.  It was what I was expecting, a large slice of pepperoni, jalapeno.  The cheese wasn't overwhelming, and the crust had a crispy outer layer with a chewy inside.  Nothing outstanding, but it filled by craving for pizza."}
{"text":"The pizza is good and the nuke fries are great but I have found hair in my pizza on two separate occasions"}
{"text":"This place is pretty decent pizza. Gotta admit, though, that I'm kind of irritated right now. Just called to get a delivery at 9:55. They stop delivering at 9:30p, so I ask if I can pick it up. They say no, they stop making pizza at 10. I say, well... it's not 10 yet. Doesn't matter. No pizza for you.   So yeah... a little irritated. Closing at 10pm is bad enough... this is Vegas. But refusing to take an order even though they aren't closed is really kind of irritating and just shows bad customer service.   I'd give it four stars usually... but they kind of soured my mood tonight. Two stars."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in Vegas.  I love thick crust and lotsa cheese, and the \"Metro\" has both in spades!  My husband loves the Gotham - loaded with meats and veggies on a thinner than average crust.  The salads are huge and tasty - their house italian dressing is mindblowing.  The fresh baked bread that comes along with it can easily make a salad a meal!  I miss my hometown pizza grotto in San Diego, but Metro Pizza has become a great stand-in!"}
{"text":"I love this place for there dinner salads and I must say it's probably the best ranch in the world as far as dressings go.  The pizzas are good, but EXTREMELY greasy.  I had to soak off all that nasty grease with napkins.  Our server was mostly missing in action the whole visit and the bussers did most of the serving.  I really should give 2 stars based on service, but food made up for the lazy waiter.  Another good thing to know as an FYI, during Christmas time, there are buy one get equal value gift cards that are a great value.   Especially if you plan on frequenting them a lot.  Example:  $25.00 = $50.00 gift card."}
{"text":"The staff is great the pizza was ok at best. The salad is a joke a piece of chicken and lettuce a tiny bit of tomatoes and feta........ 35 bucks for that and a 16 inch pep & sausage.   Im done."}
{"text":"Let me start of by saying i should have written this a few days ago when we went there but i never got the chance! I work in a busy restaurant on the strip and got off around Ten,i felt bad for my husband who said he was Hungary so i suggested we go to Metro for the first time, we arrived and we were not greeted,we waited and someone finally came over,the place was empty with one large party of maybe 8 and a two top,when we sat down i noticed how dirty the  place is,the floor was covered in food droppings and our booth seats were ripped and our table was sticky,i checked the menu and was surprised at their prices,but i hoped it was a good indication that the food was good..... the Waitress was pleasant,we ordered a Hawaiian , but i explained to her my husband didn't like peppers so one half needed to be without peppers,and then she said ok without peppers but with extra bacon on his side and i said no,just without peppers. After about 15 mins,i told my husband i was exhausted and that we should just get the pizza to go,i was expecting at this stage the pizza would be almost ready.....wrong,i waved over the waitress and paid for the pizza which was $25.00 a complete rip off,we ended up waiting another 15 mins before we got our pizza....keep in mind we were the only people in the place ordering at this point. We walked home and i opened the box to discover we had no peppers on any of the pizza and extra bacon on one half.........the pizza was doughy and way to heavy on the toppings also lacked any flavor.   So in short the service was bad,the pizza was bad, and the price was outrageous,i would never return,if you live in the area, try Cuigino's which has some of the best Italian food i have tasted outside of Italy and the family hail from Naples, also it is a fraction of the price!!!"}
{"text":"As I'm not a big fan of pizza in general, I haven't had Metro Pizza in years.  I think the last time I had it, I lived somewhere else in town, so that was 2006.  Anyway, my girlfriend was fiending for some pizza, and Meto Pizza was open until 10pm, AND it was on the way to where we were going.  I'm glad we stopped in.  We got The Metro, which is a deep dish style pizza.  We had the small pizza, billed on the menu as \"individual.\"  Well my girlfriend and I were both stuffed and had a slice or two left over.  $11 for the pizza, so a pretty cheap meal for two.  I'll be back to try their other varieties... at some point."}
{"text":"This is our second time to metro pizza and as always the pizza is absolutely outstanding.  However the service is bit spotty.  This boyfriend and I stopped in for an early dinner.  The busser seated us, took our drink order, served our drinks.  After about 7 min our server came over and took our order : garlic knots for an app and a Metro Pizza for us to share.  The garlic knots came out promptly and we're absolutely yummy.  Then the pizza was brought to our table.  It was ridiculously huge and not in a good way.  Neither of us are big eaters and literally I could've used this pizza as a couch cushion.  Upon looking at the menu again I found Metro offers two different sizes of its signature pizza but our server never asked us which size we would like.  We both ate less than a slice of pizza each before being full and having to ask for our pizza to be boxed up.  Don't get me wrong it was delicious pizza but just absurdly too large for anyone to imagine two normal sized people to be able to eat.  The busser boxed the pizza and brought us our check.  The only time we saw our server apart from her taking our original order was when she asked over her shoulder, on the way to another table, if we were doing okay.   To continue the monstrous pizza saga...upon arriving home we discovered this pizza box was too big to even fit in our full size side-by-side fridge.  In summary:  Food: 5 stars Service: 2 stars."}
{"text":"Awesome place to eat. Doid is amazingly good!!! And our servwr/bartender Nate was awesome. He was attentive and informative and super friendly. Def one of the places we'll be back time and again.  The stuffed pizza, nuclear fries were so good but nothing topped their bread!!! Holy cow its good!!! Come to Metro you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Enjoyed an excellent dinner on a relaxed Sunday evening. We shared the Pasta Luna (photo) and a veggie pizza. A house salad comes with the Pasta dinners but our server delivered a larger version of the salad for the two of us. The house bread was amazing; warm and fresh... that perfect crisp on the edge to the soft and tasteful inside. The sign of a good kitchen. The dinner fare did not disappoint. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"We waited over an hour for our food because there was some kind of shift change mistake...However, the assistant manager rectified the situation by taking care of the bill. We understand mistakes happen and really appreciate Metro realizing there was a problem and fixing it to ensure that we were satisfied. I will go back again because the service and food is good, but to me, more important is that they care about their customers' satisfaction and want to make things right. I appreciate the good customer service!"}
{"text":"Good pizza. Seriously over priced though. We have tried it three different times and ALWAYS get cold pizza for delivery. They have the best house dressing I've ever had though so we will just fine in when we eat here!"}
{"text":"Pizza was good! The crust was especially nice and perfectly cooked. Thin and nicely crisp. I only gave 3 stars because the delivery took over an hour and the lady on the phone taking my order was rude and really shouldn't be in a customer facing role. Other than that...great pizza."}
{"text":"Who would have thunk it.  Top notch Chicago style pizza in Las Vegas?  Um.  Vegas known for buffets and newly sprouted trendy bourgeois restaurants not pizza.  Try the stuffed Stockyard pizza pie it's grande. Take your friends."}
{"text":"The entrance to this place is on the totally opposite side of the parking lot which is super confusing but enter and you feel like you're in a chucky cheese minus the games! But...don't let that fool, why we're all the waitresses and hostess super friendly and nice?! Awesome, you usually don't find that kind of service at a minimum wage paying type of eatery. So fresh bread is served at the table and it is easy but don't fill up. We ordered two order of the garlic knots since they are 6 per order and we had 9 people. Tasty and huge and why does this place have the best ranch I've ever tasted?!? Omg!!! We ordered the Honolulu, the Pantheon, and the Meat Lovers (large). Seriously, the crust is not thick or thin, it's just right! The flavor of the dough was amazing! I've eaten so many pizzas in my life and this is the BEST!!! I loved the Pantheon because it had a garlic cream sauce and the thick mozzarella cheese and feta and spinach with the chicken on top literally make you just want to melt into it! I sadly could only eat one piece because it is so filling but I tasted the toppings on the other pizzas and they are huge pieces of everything. The waitress told me it's because they use all real and fresh ingredients. I'm craving this pizza again!! I know pizza is so fatty but I need it again soon!!! This is my new pizza spot. Now I hope they deliver to my house because this is my UFC and Oscar night must have! Though each large pizza is about $29 each, big and filling and the taste makes it so worth it!"}
{"text":"First of all my reason for the 4 stars is the food is a little pricey. The first time my Mom and I went was awful which was about around the time when the sky pointe location first opened. We had a lot of questions about the food and our server knew nothing about the menu. We ordered a pizza that was nothing as she described. It was really nasty. We took one bite and sent it back. The Manager refused to take it off of our bill even though we sent it back. The service sucked that day and they weren't even busy. We decided we were never coming back.                                              Well, yesterday on July 4th after going to a movie with my Mom and Son and getting ready to pass Metro Pizza on the way home, we started talking about giving them a second chance. We were seated right away with a very friendly young lady. Our server was Scotty. We asked a lot of questions about the menu and he answered every one of them. He knows the menu. We decided on the Lg. Gotham Pizza. It was fabulous. Scotty said it was one of their popular pizza's. Everything had a perfect balance. The al dente red peppers to the cooked fresh mushrooms to the just right sauce and perfect meat combo was so good.  Scotty is an asset to your company and we will definitely be coming back. I would also like to say that yes the food is pricey but they have specials throughout every month which if you go on those days then it is affordable to go a little more often as most other pizza places have coupons too to accommodate their prices too."}
{"text":"Because I am a cool teacher, we held our last full class of the semester here! It gives my co instructor and I a chance to chat with our students as well as chow don on some good pizza at great prices!  We went during happy hour when Pizzas are 50% off. We had great service, our server didn't even right anything down and she got it all correct! I was amazed because there was 10 of us.  Our group ordered many different pizzas, some stuffed, pasta a well as salads and a couple desserts. One of my students got a strawberry shake that looked really good!  Overall it was a great experience and drink refills were aplenty!"}
{"text":"For about three hours, ten or so of us got a lesson on the history of pizza making along with a live demonstration of how to do some by Metro Pizza chef/owner John Arena.  He teaches a semester course at UNLV in this same subject so we got the condensed version.  During the time we were there, he shared with us some history, methodology, good stories, and great food.  Food items we tasted:  Meatball sliders Pompeii pizza Sicilian pizza Grilled pizza with razor clams Bruschetta with sausage, peppers, and caramelized onions on Semolia Pasta pie Steinbrenner calzone Modesto pizza with sliced mozzi Brioche gelato--pistachio gelato in brioche buns  There was not one thing I ate that didn't register a high mark from me.  The meatball sliders were moist and the buns were topped with garlic.  Learning how the Pompeii pizza was made thousands of years ago--pre-scoring the dough before baking and then topping it after baking--was very informative and the pizza was quite good.     If I had to pick standouts for the evening, I'd go with the Sicilian pizza and the Steinbrenner calzone.  I like thick crust pizza and the Sicilian here is a thick crust that is soft and not crunchy like some I've had.  Chef Arena described the fermenting of the dough and the twice baking so the dough is soft and the ends are blistered.  The calzone was one of the lightest calzones I've had.  It had very little dough and a proper amount of filling.  This was not a lot of dough with a little filling but the opposite.  Our group had this private lesson and pizza tasting in the Lulu's Bread and Breakfast section of the building.  Helping out with the breads was Chef Chris Decker.    This was a wonderful evening.  While our selection of foods and Chef Arena's lesson are atypical of the normal customer at Metro Pizza, I know that the food is excellent.  It's excellent because of the years of experience Chef Arena has making pizza.  With that experience, he has learned a great deal.  His passion for his craft comes out in both his class and the taste of his food.  We had the good fortune to be taught by a master pizza maker!"}
{"text":"We eat here every Friday.  So sad i feel this place is going downhill.  First off when Jen P works service is great.  Was there yesterday , they had no silverware so we had to use plastic ware.  Never enough napkins.  They ran out of salad bowls or they were getting washed.  Brain was our server just seemed like this place was to busy for them to give service.  We had to ask for drinks,  napkins,  dressing for our 50 wings we ordered.  Hope service gets better or we will have to go else where."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizzas in Vegas is the Gotham at Metropizza. love the happy hour half off promotion during the weekday afternoons."}
{"text":"My family loves the pizza from Metro at Skypoint. We order from here quite often probably at least 25+ times to date. The resturant atmosphere is nice and they have a bar but the bar is not inviting. The TVs are attached to the ceiling probably 20 feet in the air so it's really uncomfortable to watch any game. Most bartenders are not very friendly and keep to themselves. The bar is never busy but the restaurant and especially the takeout do get very busy. Only once had I got a burnt pizza, once they forgot to make my order, and today I was put on hold when ordering for 14:12 with no apology from Jennifer but typically the pizza is excellent. I'd recommend dining in or take out but not the bar."}
{"text":"Pizza's not bad but just a little expensive.  Service was good.  Garlic fries were very yummy.  Place is ok if you're in the mood for pizza and you're close by."}
{"text":"After a disappointing Italian lunch earlier, it was time to get serious. Once you have a craving, it has to be taken care of the right way. Time to turn to an old friend. Metro Pizza never ever disappoints. I've enjoyed Metro for 15 years. Used to be a regular fanatic at the Ellis Island location. Awesome garlic knots!!  So anyway I hit up the Flamingo/Decatur location for takeout. On this trip I ordered the Modesto pizza. It was delicious. Simple but so good, and cooked perfectly. Awesome crust, mushrooms, crushed tomatoes, spicy sausage. And of course my wife had to have the chicken fingers. Her absolute favorite. She turned me on to these a while ago, and I have to agree with her, these are the best chicken fingers out there. You can order them mild, medium, or spicy. We opt for medium. Just enough tang and spice. The fingers are HUGE!!. lightly breaded, hot, juicy, flavorful. One bite and your hooked. Dip it in there delicious ranch dressing and you're in for a treat.   Metro is a local favorite and never disappoints. Really good pizza, chicken fingers, Italian favorites, great service, reasonable prices. You can't go wrong!!"}
{"text":"Centennial Hills location.  Family business for many, many decades. One of our Las Vegas favorites. Super menu selections. National varieties  of pizzas Great thin crust pizza"}
{"text":"I ask the server what was every ones favorite & ordered a small Gotham pizza last night with a couple of garlic knots just to try them out after all the good reviews I read. Staff is friendly, Pizza is lacking, no sauce, no cheese, I expected better.  Costco make a better Pizza. Maybe a small is harder, but I won't be returning."}
{"text":"Friends took me here for the first time on my birthday. The service was friendly and fast and the pizza was delicious! The only reason I did not give Metro 5 stars is that I did not get to experience more items on the menu.  I want to go back and order pasta and dessert - then I will update my review!"}
{"text":"A friend of mine posted a slice pizza pic to FB.  It was a damn good picture of some damn good looking pizza.  That's when it was over for me.  I had to satisfy the craving...nothing else would do.  I didn't just want pizza.  I wanted good pizza.  So, I hopped onto Yelp and began my search.  Where I live (north side of Vegas - up on Nellis AFB) there are NO good pizza joints (or other restaurants...really).  So, my search resulted in everything down south.  Metro pizza caught my eye and the pictures from other patrons enticed me.    Drove down in 20 min, walked in, got seated, and looked over the detailed menu. Started off with complimentary fresh, moist, and heavy bread.  Then ordered some garlic knots.  Decided on The Stockyard (Meat Lovers)-small pizza and San Genarro (sliced meatballs/fresh garlic)- small pizza.  The San Genarro sounds too simple, right?  No way, this baby was poppin' full of flavor.  Both pizzas were off the chiz-ain (am I allowed to say that?  Who cares, gonna say it anyway). This was more than enough food to feed 2 adults and 2 small children.  I was glad to have left overs so I can eat some for breakfast tomorrow!  I like a good thin crust with plenty of sauce and gooey cheese.  This place has it.  They also have super thick crust if that's your thing.  I can't describe how wonderful the food was.  After 2 years of living in Vegas...I've finally found a good pizza joint.  (Restaurant itself - large, clean, and friendly staff)"}
{"text":"The food was really good, but despite being there incredibly early the kids' food came out quickly while the adults' food didn't come out until the kids' good was already gone or already cold. That was a bummer!"}
{"text":"First time here and all I have to say is WOW!!!! Had Sicilian pizza which was like being back in queens. We were greeted by Kiara who was extremely friendly, professional and a sweetheart. Our server Courtney was awesome! Very friendly, attentive and professional as well. We're Definitely coming back here again!"}
{"text":"Clearly ordered two pizzas (6 people around to confirm) - phone service was lame - repeated order multiple times.  Deliver arrives with one pizza at $27 and has no clue of other order.  Proceeds to charge $27 for one pizza with no solution for the second pizza.  Clueless staff."}
{"text":"OMG I had the stuffed pizza and chicken wings from this place. If crack was in the form of food, this would be it. What more can you expect from the 6 year Zagat rated best pizza joint."}
{"text":"The pizza was ok. Nothing special. I've had much better at places closer to my house. Not anything like Chicago pizza as stated on the menu... My boyfriend lived there and didn't like this pizza. I've been to NYC and had better at a street corner place....  However the server was on top of things and was nice.  Hopefully the food gets better."}
{"text":"Great pizza joint. But a lot of bread in the pizza pies. It's great for families and get get togethers. Not a lot of sound absorption so it can get rather noisy. The help is friendly and attentive. I can't wait to go back so I can try a regular style pizza. That's it."}
{"text":"Always good. Everything at Metro has been my favorite. I love the Decatur location because I feel like an extra in 'Saved By The Bell!' Service is always great, and we had toddlers with us and they were very accommodating. Kids can play with some dough if you ask;) I love their Tuscan salad, but would love it even more if they used fresh pears. Chicken chop with ranch is my other go to. Pizza game is on point, and I love their ranch. Definitely bring a friend to eat with. Portions are huge!"}
{"text":"They do pizza very good here. I've been coming here for about 3 years now. If you're looking for a pizza where you can taste the actual toppings then this is the place to go. They pile their pizzas with toppings and If you plan on coming here and don't get their Metro style crust then don't even bother, it's what they specialize in. It's basically a thick doughy crust but it's so good. It's what they're known for hence the name. Pizza is kinda of expensive but you get what you pay for, I get full off of 2 slices where as other places I can eat 4. Staff here is decent nothing that will leave an impression on you. If anything it's their quality of their food. Overall solid 4 stars."}
{"text":"Great pizza - although slightly heavy for a thin crust.  The place has a good atmosphere, very \"family\" and always busy. I've read a lot of negative reviews about the service, but I really don't think the bussers are rude, just maybe not too experienced since everyone seems to be a high school kid. Overall, I think it's pretty prompt and friendly. Prices are decent and they have a bar."}
{"text":"My friend told me that I should try this place the next time I was in Vegas, so on our last trip to Vegas we had to make a stop here.  As soon as we entered I got the reminiscent feeling of a old school diner feel.  Located a bit off the strip but definitely worth the drive.  We ordered three kinds of pizza, garlic fries, garlic knots, and the sangria.    The Stockyard stuffed pizza, Modesto specialty pizza, and the spring street east side pizza.  Three different kinds of pizza, all so big that I struggled to eat a slice of each.  I had to try them all since it looked and smelled so delicious when it was brought out.   It didn't just look and smelled good but it was actually really tasty.  Flavorful and fresh.  The modesto was the lighter one of the three and the stuffed pizza was pretty filling.  Wash it down with a cold cup of sangria, left us all full and happy."}
{"text":"I love their pizza.  I especially love it when I am there during happy hour and get a discount.  They have a lot of events which I never seem to make it to, but I keep trying.  Service has always been very good although it can take some time when it is busy.   The crust is top notch.  Salads are decent although I usually just get side salads and not the dinner salads which look huge."}
{"text":"Dinner with Terri R and Suzy H at Metro Pizza equals good times.  I love me some pizza.  Here's the problem...I don't get to eat it much.  If I can, I'd have a pizza every other day.  Too bad, so sad for me.  But I finally got the chance a couple of nights ago after 12 weeks of clean eating.  I earned this and I'm going to turn this mutha out.    This is not my first time to Metro Pizza.  This is just my first time at this one.  I've always been a fan of their pizza and let's not forget their garlic knots.  I shared half a pizza with my gf.  Okay, I actually ate 75% of the pizza, but who's counting?  My half included just pepperoni & mushrooms and Terri's was just mushrooms.  The pizza was tasty, thin, and not overly sauced out.  This is exactly how I like my pies.  As for the garlic knots, those little baked creatures didn't have a chance. The G-Knots are a bit greasy, small enough, and my goodness, the type of carbs my body has been missing.  Obviously, I'm a fan of Metro and wish to be back in another 16 1/2 weeks.    PS:  We had a slight issue when our pizza first arrived.  It was missing the mushrooms, but this was remedied quickly.  To top it off, we also got hooked up with canoli's.    BTW:  This Metro does remind me of Max's from \"Saved by the Bell\".  We're just missing Kelly Kapowski.      YELP PERSONAL CHALLENGE 2013 - (438/500)"}
{"text":"Metro Pizza has one of the best lunch deals in town. For right around $8 you can get a personal pizza, a small salad, bread AND a drink. I have never gotten anything other then this lunch special from Metro because to me, that's pretty much unbeatable.   The pizza is good, not exactly mind-blowingly amazing, but good. The thing that gets me every time is the house salad dressing. I need to find out if it's made in house or purchased because that stuff is delicious. I always use the bread that comes with my lunch special to soak up any remaining dressing. Mmmm.   I have been to Metro a couple times with co-workers and shared some appetizers. The only one that stands out is the nuclear fries. They aren't messing around, those bad boys are hot. Or I am a wuss. Or both. Service is always great though, and my 'I refuse to grow up' inner child always has fun drawing on the paper table covers with crayons."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of the Metro Pizza on Decatur and Tropicana, but had never been to this location despite it being fairly close to my house.   My husband and I stopped in for a late lunch before catching a movie this past weekend. My first impression was that it was decorated a bit nicer compared to the Decatur location. There was a lot of 80s memorabilia on the walls but other then that it seems more like a place you could go on a date... None of the butcher paper as table clothes, which gives the Decatur location a more casual, fun, family friendly feel to it...   Who really cares about the atmosphere of a pizza place though? People go to pizza places for food! And Metro delivers. We split a small (9\") mushroom pizza ($9) and an order of garlic knots ($4.95). My husband also had a side salad (don't recall price) with balsamic dressing. I am a huge fan of the house dressing at Metro but had never tried the balsamic. It's great, I love how they bring out the entire bottle so you are sure to have enough for your salad and some extra to drizzle on the yummy complimentary bread.  The garlic knots were excellent. I like the knots from Villa pizza, I LOVE the knots from Metro though... The pizza was ok, when I took my first slice off the plate most of the cheese and toppings slide off. Don't like that much. It tasted good though...   Service was a little on the slow side, slow enough that we ended up going to see a later movie.  If I could do half-star ratings I would give Metro a 3.5 but it was good food at a decent price so I will round up"}
{"text":"I'm a fan and didn't even try their pizza.  I've had Metro Pizza bookmarked, then I took it off, then I put it back on, then I finally tried them.  I was seeking this place out every since I read an ROTD on it from last November.  Never found the time and wasn't in the area to ever try them until now.   Let's start with the restaurant itself.  It's bigger than I expected. One thing missing from most reviews is the size of this restaurant. I expected a small typical pizza joint with your checkered red/white tablecloths and gaudy decorations all over. Boy was I totally moted!!  This restaurant is classy, spacious, clean, and well lit.  Because of what I experienced walking in, I assumed a pricey menu.  My first thoughts, sure glad Terri R. is paying for lunch this time. Then I reviewed the menu and was brought back down to earth.  Bang for your buck for sure!   Metro Pizza has a large selection of pizza, stuffed pizza, salads, calzones, platters, dinners, and one type of soup (Minestrone).  I didn't want to feel too heavy for lunch, so I opted against pizza this time.  I'm not a huge pizza guy anymore anyways.  I chose their Chicken Parmesan Sub w/Garlic Fries ($9.25).  This is served hot, melted cheese, and just the right amount of sauce on top of about 8 oz of breaded chicken breast.  Simply delicious, portions big, and the chicken breast tender.  I washed my parmesan sub down with their garlic fries and glass of water.  In about 10 minutes, my meal was devoured.    One thing about Italian Restaurants, either there's too much sauce which sometimes sogs out your meal or there's not enough where you're wanting more.  At Metro, they had it just right, not too much, not too little, and definitely not too thick.  Since I'm a new fan of Metro's Parm Sub, I'm sure their pizzas are good too.  Service was great from start to finish. Our food was also prepared and served with little wait.   Voted \"The Best of Las Vegas\" 7 years in a row!!!  They obviously don't need my review to keep their status, but they got my 5 stars anyway."}
{"text":"Given that it is in the airport and you expect overpriced food, the pizza was not bad. I had the Hawaiian slice. It wasn't greasy despite the other reviews. Would try another slice if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Some of the best pizza I have EVER eaten.  The Hubby and I come here on every visit to Vegas - we wouldn't miss it.  Highly recommend the Thompson Street and the Memphis (my fav is far and away the Thompson Street pizza, honestly can't think of a better pizza I've eaten).  Staff are friendly and obliging, never crowded when we go.  If you're looking for pizza in Vegas, look no further."}
{"text":"3 stars for the friendly and informative service. However, the pictures were misleading on here. Sauce was spotty. Zero to no veggie. Where's the cheese? I ordered a Margherita pizza and THIS is what they gave me! Check out my pictures. Pitiful.  I want an explanation."}
{"text":"Great service from Jose and the pizza salad and garlic bread were amazing I came here on accident as I was looking for someplace else I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Great suggestion from \"Jaime\" for a business lunch near the airport. Settabello in Green Valley is my go to place for work lunches which is just ok... but the pie here at Metro far exceeds the eats they have over at Settabello (thank god).  I met an associate here mid day 12:30 for a quick bite and chat. And simply asked the waitress (sorry forgot her name) to bring us her favorite which seemed to be a sauceless pie with fresh cheese, tomatoes, and basil and a hint of meat and was fabulous. The crust was on point with the right amount of density to hold the toppings and not a shoe sole to bite or chew through. The atmosphere is very friendly and you can see plenty of tables with the typical groups from work gathering over great food so im sure its gets busy during the lunch rush.   Food - A    so tasty  Service - A    very friendly  Atmosphere - B+    but its a pizza joint so its not going to be fancy   Overall experience is tops in my book and i will certainly return when i need a good pizza or a casual place to meet for a work lunch."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for quality pizza. I personally love the calzones and stromboli. We go to the location at the corner of Stephanie and Horizon Ridge Pkwy."}
{"text":"We went on a relatively busy Friday night. We got the keys to our new house and decided to see what was good in the area. I've lived here for over 20 years and have friends that swear by this pizza, but I've only eaten it twice at the Tropicana location too long ago to remember how it was.  \"Meh\" is a perfect description. Not horrible, but I've had way better before.  We went with three individual pizza's. \"The Green Valley\" (Veggie) Pizza for myself, the wife got a seafood special, and the kid got a kid's cheese.  The Green Valley - Really happy to see zucchini on the pizza, and thinly sliced too. Olives, mushrooms, and green peppers. You can tell they use a quality cheese as the pizza wasn't greasy. However, the pizza sauce was extremely flat and the pizza crust was too doughy. Reminded me of the nation wide chains. I ended up having to cover it in Oregano to get any flavor.  The Seafood Special - Much better. The menu said it uses a different \"diabla\" (IIRC) pizza sauce, and it was much better than the sauce on the green valley. I'm also sure the umami from the fried calamari and shrimp really helped. If I ever get dragged here against my will, this will the pizza I order.  Kids cheese - stole a slice from my kid (that's what dads do). Same experience as the Green Valley: doughy and boring.  Service was fast and friendly. No complaints there."}
{"text":"This location is close to my house so I always order from here, Although I hate the $5 delivery fee and then tipping the driver on top of that. Also this place is pretty expensive, $40 plus dollars for a pizza and garlic bread(delivered) But its hard to beat some of the best NYC pizza in vegas on a friday delivered to your house. Nothing like a pepperoni and black olive pizza with a 2 liter of coke. 4.78stars"}
{"text":"Great tasting pizza but fairly pricey at $25. I suppose you get what you pay for though considering I am completely stuffed after 2 slices. One large \"metro\" will definitely feed me for a couple days."}
{"text":"The stuffed pizza was awesome and so filling! to be able to add as much sauce to my pizza is genius, I always need more sauce especially since it tastes so good. The sauce tasted homemade and not red gravy from a jar.  This place does it right and I think from now on I'm going to order pizza with a bowl of sauce on the side...once you go Metro there's no other substitute.  The price was perfect and the atmosphere was everything and more I was looking for."}
{"text":"I LOVE METRO PIZZA! And I have always loved it. For over 20 years. The food is consistently delicious. The pizza is off the chain. ALWAYS. My fave is the pizza of course, but the spinach and three cheese Calzone is to die for. Nuke fries with ranch...hurt me mama! The baked pasta is delish and, well, I could go on.... The ambiance, the wait staff, which by the way doesn't change often, are excellent as well. I went with my 19 year old daughter Crista last night and she has been going there since she was born. We always bring family and friends when they are visiting too. Shout out to David who has taken care of us for years. Metro Pizza is a great family restaurant!"}
{"text":"I might have to expand my pizza horizons after a visit during a fundraiser special.  Metro Pizza occasionally hosts special nights with proceeds going to the fight against hunger, specifically local food bank Three Square. I'd enjoyed a similar $1/slice offer earlier this year at their Decatur location, but the Tropicana location was even more exciting, with up eight of their different pizzas advertised as being available. They weren't quite clear about the limit stating a minimum requested $5 donation per person, while the cashier-of-sorts said we could only get up to $5 worth of tickets. Well, not that I was up for eating five hefty slices anyway...  As promised, they had a very impressive slew of pies. Although some were less readily available than others, and most if not all recipes were more modest in toppings than what other Yelpers' photos suggest is normal, this was still an opportunity to enjoy solid pizza while assisting. The crust was consistently crunchy, while the rest of the dough remained relatively soft.  Cheeses and toppings were enjoyable though, no matter the slice. I had a pepperoni, a sausage, the Sicilian, the Mulberry St (eggplant and ricotta), the Milano (with garlic and ricotta), and the white whale of the night, PSL. This featured butternut squash, sweet caramelized apple, whipped goat cheese, toasted pepitas, and walnut oil drizzle, and it was surprisingly balanced between sweet and savory. If pressed, I'd probably rank Milano and sausage as the two next best, with eggplant being an interesting take that could've used the most help from having a higher coverage of toppings.  I also ended up trying a draft beer for the obvious pairing appeal, settling on the Bonanza Brown by local brewery Tenaya Creek ($6 here). The brown ale definitely was pleasant to sip, not as bitter as some ales and not light in overall flavor.  I should add that the employee who took my beer order was nice enough to run to the register to run my credit card and then find me later at my table to bring me the card and receipt, despite me somehow completely not hearing him and subsequently not remembering that I'd passed along my card. It's standard stuff, but a lot of Yelp friends' reviews highlight poor service, so I wanted to share that anecdote.  Metro Pizza isn't an especially brilliant pizzeria, but they're a solid local chain with at least one unusual, seasonal offering. I enjoyed them enough that if I weren't such a sucker for things like happy hours and build your own pizza joints, I'd probably visit here semi-regularly. I should probably pay more attention to that calendar of specials on their web site, huh? That might close enough of the gap."}
{"text":"After much debate on what to eat tonight, we decided on ordering from Metro Pizza. With all the tasty options, we decided on the Sunspot pizza and it was absolutely delicious!!! Thin crust with chicken and artichoke and sliced tomatoes! Yum!!"}
{"text":"There is so many pizza places to choose from in Vegas, but Metro Pizza is one of the top ones. Very authentic place, decent service, variety of food not only pizzas.  The grilled shrimp, bacon, bbq sauce pizza is the best."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a great lunch here Sunday afternoon. Small side salads were huge! Ordered a large half sausage half Gotham. It was great and massive. The sausage was fresh and of good quality. The bread is the key. Out of everything we enjoyed I would say the warm fresh bread and butter was a treat.  Was baked to perfection. Our server and the rest of the waitstaff did a really great attentive job."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. My only complaint,  they always seem to screw up the order. I asked for pepperoni and pineapple, they added ham! Next time I will open the box and inspect the pizza! Geesh!"}
{"text":"I have eaten pizza all over the country. I like all of the various types of pizza. Metro is one of my top go to spots in Las Vegas for New York style pizza. I love the Old New York with pepperoni added. I want high quality ingredients, a chewy crust, and the right balance of sauce. Metro always delivers. The new $14 bottle of wine deal is also a great deal. I'm giving this 5 stars because it is definitely under rated here."}
{"text":"An excellent pasta place in Las Vegas!! What a consistent, great experience! With the superb service from Dave, and the awesome GIANT RAVIOLI, it's the one place we always eat at every time we travel to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty good, best pizza I had in Vegas. Would definitely wanna go there again!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to Metro Pizza for over 20 years. I have been to all their locations including the one they closed down in UNLV. This location on Decatur needs to be remodeled. The other locations are nicer. The food and service was good but the inside needs an upgrade."}
{"text":"Very good little mini-chain - definitely a better choice than any national chain for good pizza.  I've been going to Vegas for years, but on my last trip over the holidays, I made more of an effort to check out dining options away from the hotels and away from the strip.  I decided on a small pizza taste test and Metro Pizza came up in my research.  Came hear with my brother and we ordered a pie, half pineapple and mushroom for him, and half sausage and onion for me.  I thought my portion was fresh tasting and had solid ingredients.  The sausage was nicely seasoned, done up in small balls (see my pic).  The sauce and cheese was better than average, and the crust was thin, but not ultra New Yorky type thin.  All in all, a better than solid pie IMHO."}
{"text":"Metro Pizza is my favorite! I have been visiting the restaurant since I was eight and having end of season soccer parties.   They deliver the warmest, freshest bread when you get seated and they have a dinner salad that my kids love. The pizza is delicious and is even yummy as a leftover. My family and I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"HAPPY NATIONAL PIZZA DAY!  Yes, I came here tonight for a pizza party and it is National Pizza Day. Metro Pizza is marking the occassion by selling pizza by the slice for $1/per. Hells yes. Sign me up. Plus it is to benefit 3 Square Food Bank. Cheap pizza and it helps charity. Win and win. Plus hanging out with a few, or more than a few, friends. Bonus win.  I think I had Metro Pizza maybe once before tonight. And I had never been to the restaurant. This location has a cool 80s retro vibe. Maybe its a little dated but who cares. I dig it and the music matches. Plus the pizza is A-OK.   Tonight I ordered three slices of pepperoni. That is three slices of thin, wide, greasy NY style pie just the way I like it. Add some sprinkle cheese, some red pepper flake and a dash of garlic salt. You will not be sorry.  There is a full menu of other foods to choose from so check that out too. Metro has some good eats."}
{"text":"I came in to this Metro Pizza (Tropicana location) as part of a group last night.  The restaurant was having a special fundraising event.  $1 per slice to raise money for 3 Square Food Bank.  Charity and cheap pizza is a hard bargain to pass up.  For $5 I received 5 tickets for 5 slices of pizza which borders on too much for me.  My standard serving is 4 slices.  But my oh my these pizzas were good.  I'm talking about simple cheese and pepperoni (though they were options).  I'm talking eggplant and ricotta.  I'm talking garlic white pizza.  I'm talking ultra thin crust loaded with ground Italian sausage.  Yes, I had a slice of each.  And yes I had a slice of pepperoni too.  I am a pizza classicist.  Of the four, my favorite was the eggplant pizza.  Eggplant and ricotta together are hard to beat.    After stuffing my face with those first 4 pizzas, I waited a little while before using my 5th and final ticket.  I wanted to try the season pumpkin pizza.  I was highly skeptical at first.  All these pumpkin spice creations are so overrated cliche at this point.  But I saw the pizza in person and knew I had to try it.  I was so surprised and impressed by it I convinced another person to try it.  She enjoyed it to.  The crust was fabulous.  Crunchy, soft, and chewy all at the same time.  On top of the perfect crust was pumpkin puree, squash, apples or pears, pumpkin seeds and a whipped goat cheese.  It sounds sweet but tended more towards the savory.  Mildly spiced with the full flavor of the pumpkin up front.  The tangy goat cheese, though limited in its quantity per slice, was the perfect counter to the squash.  Those couple of bites in which I had goat cheese were damn near perfect.  I don't know who came up with this creation but I would like to shake his/her hand.  The staff tonight were hopping.  Running pizza to the bar for the fundraiser.  Running empty pie pans back to the kitchen for another go around.  Serving the people who were ordering as normal.  They were a little off when it came to drink orders and refills but in the end we all got our waters and even a pitcher of water to go around."}
{"text":"I ordered a pineapple pizza from here today and it was so yummy! The garlic breads are to die for!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service...one worker making pizzas and ignoring customers, the other disappearing in the back.  Long line ignored.  8/14/2017 6:10pm.  I put my drink back and walked away."}
{"text":"We went in for the evening meal on a Friday, we were seated in a reasonable time frame but the restraint was very noisy and not much for ambiance. We ordered our pizza and due to my wife having allergies the pie was asked to only have sauce on one side. When the pizza arrived it was not to order. We asked for a personal size pizza to be made so she could eat. By the time her pizza arrived I was done earthing and had to have the smaller pizza boxed and saved for later. Although the the small pie was comped we go out to eat as a couple. The pizza was runny and not worth the money. It was comparable to Dominoes except for the price. I don't believe we will be going back to this wanna be pizzeria."}
{"text":"So I gave this place another shot after not really liking it and having a not so great experience with my server. This is an updated 5 Stars! I come here once every two weeks now for take out! The other day I actually sat in for lunch and ordered their lunch special that comes with a small personal pizza, salad, and drink for $9 and change. It was delicious! My friend also got their lunch special with garlic fries and chicken parm sliders which was very tasty. I think I will order that next time.   Every time I order take out I get the spring street which is my absolute favorite. I prefer a crispier crust so I always ask for it to be over-baked which they gladly do.   I'm very happy I decided to give them another try. It's delicious and has actually become one of my favorite pizza places. The service is much better and their to go order people are awesome!"}
{"text":"Perfect amazing. I have been on the west coast for 4 years now and haven't found good pizza. I thought man I guess I gotta go back home (VA) to get some bomb pizza. Until tonight. I will never order from Napolis again. This is now my go to spot. Thanks guys for a great dinner"}
{"text":"This is our favorite pizza place for group dining, they make it easy to order and the food is fresh, hot and delicious."}
{"text":"Love it all the time.....the lunch specials are great.  Love the house dressing.    Great service, and quirky \"specials\"."}
{"text":"I've given Metro Pizza a fair shot at redemption several times and they still can't produce a good pizza.  This place is pricey and with pizza being their specialty you would expect them to have perfected their craft. About six months ago I ordered the seafood pizza for pickup. When I arrived home (about a seven minute ride) not only was the pizza not hot but it was soggy. You couldn't grab a piece of pizza because it would just fall apart. I called and explained this to the manager and he (I forgot his name) not only apologized but had a new, much better pizza delivered for free to my home within 25 minutes. Last night I phoned in an order (Metro pizza) for pick up.  I arrived at the pick up counter 25 minutes later and my pizza was waiting for me.  I took that seven  minute ride home and once again disappointed!!! The pizza was semi raw and the extras cheese was definitely missing. However, What was more disappointing than the terrible pizza was the attitude of the manager on duty, Dave. He insisted that we bring the pizza to him and he had an \"I don't give a s$%t attitude\"  he didn't offer us a new pizza and my boyfriend, who explained our history with Metro pizza, quickly grabbed our money for the crappy pizza they expected us to eat and left. I was upset by this as and I called metro pizza today to speak to the manager and wouldn't you know.. It was Dave!!! Yes. He still had the same poor attitude and didn't care that I told him he just lost a customer.  Beware... definitely NOT worth the expense!"}
{"text":"They seem to be getting cheap. I always order extra cheese. I ate inside tonight.  When the pizza arrived, it looked like they didn't add extra cheese. When I asked the manager he said it's 4 oz extra...I showed him where there wasn't much cheese at all....he said they didn't distribute it properly.  I'm done....it's good pizza, however, I don't like it when managers justify there errors.  How about apologize and fix it."}
{"text":"This place has very good regular pizza, I noticed that had a lot of big crust pizza's.  I ordered a small regular personal pizza/ no toppings.  It was around $8 and fed me and my 8 yr. old. I am from NY and think it was very good pizza!! I would return to this place.  The pizza was close but not exactly like MY Little Pizzeria on Court street which is owned by the Same Fontana family as all the Original Pizza's in Brooklyn and this pizza was similar so I was happy :) with it and will return."}
{"text":"It's okay.  Nothing special here, but it's not bad either.  The building is nice and it's very conveniently located near my home.  We had a $25 gift card so we went to check this place out.  The bread that they give you before your meal comes out is good, and the fried mozzarella was very good.  The pizza, was okay.  The bell peppers on the pizza tasted raw, like they were not cooked at all.  For me, I think this place is a bit pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"$40 dollar, hour and a half long delivery time pizza. Burnt and cold. Pass."}
{"text":"Every time I'm in Vegas and want a pizza this is the place I go!  The pizza is fantastic! The crust is outstanding, the sauce is oh so yummy, and the toppings are fresh.  I always get take away so I can't tell you how the restaurant is, but the service is always good when I pick up my pizza or call to order by phone.  Very nice and courteous staff.  I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family."}
{"text":"Not far from the strip, this place is the best kept secret. Inside Ellis Island, tiny casino. Pizza is always good, and the prices are fantastic. Sundays they have 2 for 1 large pizzas. They deliver too!"}
{"text":"This pizza hit the spot! Tastier (and cheaper) than most of the recommended casual pizza joints on the strip. A little on the greasy side, but nothing a napkin couldn't fix. Can't beat this value."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here twice and the food is delicious! The staff is friendly and both times our severs have been sweet and very professional! Very family oriented as well! Love it here!"}
{"text":"I understand why this is a favorite for one of my former math teachers. Metro was recommended to me over 5 years ago and I finally had time to check it out.   The pizza is so good and so huge! The large feeds two hungry hippos. You're also allowed to do half of one specialty and half of another so do that!! I forgot which two I ordered but they were awesomeeee"}
{"text":"Pizza was really really good and the service was amazing. Will definitely come back when in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from This location tonight. $$ 5 $$ delivery charge plus a tip. The delivery guy didn't know if he received all, part or any of the delivery charge. Metro Pizza is my husbands favorite. It must be the location, which sucks because we needed a new place to eat in this area. Fries showed up soggy. The salad I ordered was not good at all. I chose the one with salami and ham...it was very bland, the meats weren't tasty and somewhat old and the lettuce tasted dirty. My husband said the pizza was just ok. 49$$ for pizza and salad Is only worth it if its delicious. I'm so disappointed  ...Rosatis it stays.  Their feta salad is to die for!"}
{"text":"This place is way overpriced for what you're getting. With a great pizza restaurant down the street ( Streets Of New York) they gotta give me a reason to come back"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give this place a higher score, but I wanna sleep at night.  I was excited to come here for two reasons I love pizza and of course all the buzz following this place.  Finally made it down and left pretty disappointed.    Literally before I could sit down some one was hovering over me asking me what I wanted to drink.  Before I could look at the menu to see what they had, and they just stand there until you decide.  Being a swell guy and not wanting to feel uncomfortable and leave the kid standing there I just ordered a Coke.   When the server arrived it was not the same person who took my drink order.  So I took a gander around the place and noticed they have the bus boys bun rushing the guests with drink orders before they sit.  My sister and I decided to try the hot and spicy fries for an appetizer.  When they came it looked like fries with a light sprinkle of pepper.  To be honest the fries had a odd smell and the flavor I was not a fan of at all.  Now the pie.  We went with the family favorite sausage and mushroom.  When it came out I was a bit surprised with the size.  But a good surprise of course.  Metro make a really good pizza.  If I would have just had the pizza itself I would given it a four star.  But the whole experience for me wasn't great hence the 3 star.  Maybe I was expecting too much from this place, but with all of there locations a bit far from where I live and having some other great places closer I don't know when I will be back."}
{"text":"YUM!! We ordered salads, hot wings, pizza and 2 hefeweizens!!! Good service and great food!!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to try metro pizza as I had heard great things. I viewed their menu and saw they offered a stuffed pizza. Being from Chicago, Giordano's stuffed pizza is literally my absolute favorite pizza. When I called I asked if the pizza was similar to the stuffed pizza from Chicago, the person answered that they actually have a \"Chicago\" stuffed pizza (I did see it listed on the menu and it was a spinach stuffed pizza) not answering the real question of what the pizza was like...so I figured she had never had the real deal and I would go for it.  I asked about the sizes, it was to feed two of us, and she said well the small Only has 4 pieces. 4 pieces sounded so small and we unfortunately opted for the large. I definitely should have realized a large stuffed pizza is very very big BUT it was early in the day and I was hung over so I though leftovers wouldn't be the worse thing. Unfortunately if you are looking for a Chicago style stuffed pizza (giordanos, Lou malnattis, unos...) this is not the same. We ordered a cheese and there is a definite crust completely covering the cheese with all of the marinara on the side. A true stuffed pizza does indeed have a very very thin crust topping the luscious cheese in the middle But the marinara costs the top and is baked with the pizza. The crust is deep and crispy and I always use it as a breadstick. This crust was much more reminiscent of a typical deep dish pizza and didn't have the crispy texture or thickness. Super super super disappointed and unfortunately the rest of the pizza went to waste after the first 2 slices.   Seems like I probably ordered the wrong type of pizza and my expectations of a Chicago stuffed pizza were out of line with reality. Now that a giordanos exists on the strip in Bally's if I am to spend $30+ dollars on a pizza I've learned a valuable lesson of where to order."}
{"text":"I dunno how this place makes it; the salad still sucks and so does the service.  The bread is the best part by far.  The pizza is just okay.   Please get fresher ingredients and better trained servers Metro Pizza and maybe I'll return.  Simply gotta find better elsewhere."}
{"text":"Ever since college (early 1990s), I've been coming to this pizza chain. This may be the only one that has not converted to their newer, updated theme, like a family style pizza place. It's very 1980's in here. I totally agree with Blair B. on the decor looking like it came from \"Saved By The Bell\" set, bright colors, and geometric shapes paired with black and white print contrast.   Still my favorite place to get a pizza at a sit-down restaurant. My favorite remains to be be the \"Gotham\"- pepperoni, sausage, ground beef, mushrooms, green peppers, and onions. And then, to take some home, to have at another time, it's a treat. It's not as greasy as my husband's favorite, Pizza Hut. I've also had on the menu: the sandwiches (eggplant parmesan), salad (house), and the calzones (huge), too- which are all, very yummy too. What I always saw at the Trop location, was the huge pizza for takeout, I always wondered about that, I think that it's one topping, but I could be wrong.  This location is probably the smallest one, and so, it can fill up fast. But if you get there at the right time, your wait time (for a table and for your food) won't be so bad. Service was pretty good. The hostess was nice. But because it's a small place, there might be a wait for the restroom (single one).  Great pizza, good food, a trusted pizza chain restaurant. There is a reason why I've loved the Gotham pizza for so many years."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite pizza place here in Las Vegas. I've been coming to this chain since my college years (90's) so the decor has changed from kitchy (think Appleby's and TGIFridays- since renovated) to a classic rustic italian restaurant with numerous tv's playing sporting events. My favorite pizza is the Gotham- sausage, peppers, onions, mushrooms.I've had other pizzas here but I no longer choose the road less traveled. My husband introduced the Gotham to some out of town friends- they loved it. I've had the eggplant parmesan sandwich and the calzone- which are excellent. They're both too big for me to finish, so plan on leftovers unless you wanna split it with a large party. The calamari appetizer is very good and worth mentioning. The service is really good. You get fresh warm bread and butter while you wait for your pizza or entrees. I am so glad that this place, even with its popularity and loyal following, still participates in the entertainment book, with numerous coupons. Also worth mentioning the huge pizza (30\"?) that you can order to go, as well. Also, there are specials like the \"50% off pizza between 2-4 pm\" on weekdays only."}
{"text":"I was famished after a day of playing tourist and stumbled into the Ellis Island Casino, where in a little corner, you will find this Pizza place. I had heard from the shuttle driver that the pizzas are yummy and yes, that is so!  Thursdays are buy one slice or pizza and get one free. Same thing on Sundays too. I watched as dazed gamblers would rouse themselves from all their slot action and stumble over to Metro and grab a pizza slice and beer. There is a little area now with three booths that the under 21 crowd can chow down at. Otherwise, a sign does warn that around the corner is 21 and up only. That's because there are enormous vats of beer brewing right behind some windows. I guess Ellis Island brews it's own, which is brewing sustainably.   The pizza's are DELICIOUS! I had the Supreme slice and it was loaded with every good thing! In fact the piece of pie was so top heavy with ingredients that I could not lift it up to my mouth to eat, so I rolled it and thought to myself, I am going to get a heart attack from this, but I will die happy! I also ordered a 16 oz. cup of their brewed on the spot light beer and it only cost $1.75 for a cup. Also had the antipasto salad made on the premises and it was unholy good too! After pulling out the onions and peppers, it was full of slices of meat and cheeses with a wonderful Italian balsamic dressing.  Deducted 1 YELP STAR for surly service from the bored-looking cashiers.  But forget about feeding the sluts... I mean slots.. at this Casino. Just go for the pizza action!"}
{"text":"This is the best in town. I turned my office staff on to it and I think they order from there at least twice a month. The garlic knots are amazing."}
{"text":"If you like your pizza with a soggy bottom, then this is the place for you. The crust was good though."}
{"text":"This pizza was A-OK. You could do a lot worse for a quick bite at the airport.  It wasn't that quick though. They had one old slice of plain left when I arrived, with several people waiting around to get a slice of whatever pies were coming out next.  After about 10 minutes, a pepperoni pie finally emerged and I got my hands on one of the super oily slices ($5). As I stood there looking like an idiot taking a picture of my pizza, the oil actually dripped down my palm on to my wrist and my arm. Serves me right.  They also had a stuffed slice which looked a little scary, as well as a Hawaiian pie and a veggie pie, and some garlic knots. All those things looked even greasier.  From a quick search, this appears to be a chain in Vegas which I didn't get a chance to visit during my stay, so I wonder if the chain is this mediocre, or if it just seemed not that great since I was trying it for the first time at an airport. Maybe I'll try a real location next time I'm in Vegas. Also, maybe not."}
{"text":"Love it! I always order the #1 lunch special and a glass of wine! Really good stuff."}
{"text":"Not bad at all! Finally had some decent pizza in Vegas! This is the closest I've had here to the pizza I grew up with in Chicago. I am a fan and will be back. The gelatto was yummy too."}
{"text":"I can here solely based off a recommendation from a friend who told me this was \"the best pizza in Vegas\". I consider that something of a dubious distinction since Vegas, to my knowledge, is not known for any pizza places. And if CA can barely get pizza right, I had a hard time believing Vegas could do any better.   For the record, I live and die by NYC pizza. There is nothing on this planet that even compares. Yes, Chicago, that includes you.   They were having a special deal where all pies were half off, so we got a large topped with pepperoni, sausage, and black olives. The quality just wasn't there for me. The pizza wasn't crispy enough, for one thing. Every time I folded a slice in half the front would start to droop like it was going flaccid. The sausage and pepperoni didn't help things since both were so greasy the pie was getting soggy. I'm cool with pepperoni, but those little blobs of meat called sausage do nothing for me. I should have vetoed that topping suggestion when it came up. Pretty good crust, though. Nothing that saved the dish but it worked all the same.   Is this the best Vegas can do? Decent doesn't cut it for me. I can't grade on a relative scale."}
{"text":"LOVE Metro Pizza and love it even more on Thursdays... 2 for 1 slices and 2 for 1 ANY pizza! I suggest you order ahead of time when it's a Friday!"}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery. After and hour and half no pizza. We called and we were told it was out for delivery. Twenty minutes later we received a call and said our order was never processed; however,  we were still charged. He apologized but was \"standoffish\" when told we are not paying for the pizza."}
{"text":"Tastes just like east coast pizza I love it! I didn't expect this pizza to be that great but it is amazing. If your craving some good New York style pizza try this place out."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with Metro Pizza. I love their food, I've never had any qualms about recommending their food. Service on the other hand has been either spectacular or horrible. That being said, this is the most consistent of the Metro Pizza locations, and as Blair mentioned, its like going to the Max from Saved By the Bell. This has become our local Metro since moving across town, and we go once or twice a month. I've noticed it is never as busy as the E. Tropicana or Green Valley locations, its quieter due to its design, and the service is more consistent. The food is just as good as the other Metro's but the feel is like you are in a one of a kind pizza joint, not a mini chain pizza joint.  The pizza is pricey, but its worth it. Our regular order is a small South Side (Chicago style cheese), with a side salad (massive - more than enough for two people with great ranch dressing)...if their are more than two of us, we usually add the nuclear fries, which have a good level of spice to them.  Metro isn't the best pizza I've had, but it always hits the spot."}
{"text":"This location of Metro is the reason I have a love hate relationship with this local mini-chain. My rating then is a composite rating for every two good visits I've had to this location, I have had one bad visit. My most recent visit was on Monday, and it was with a large group from my office. I called ahead a couple hours to let them know we had a large group coming. They asked for the exact  time, and I gave it to them. However, when we showed up, a few minutes before the time I gave them, it was almost as if I never called at all. It was lunch time, but it wasn't all that busy. They asked if we wanted table or booth (there were 12 of us) and I said table, as I had on the phone. Instead of being placed in the back right corner where I've been on at least 6 occasions when with a group of 10 or more, we were placed in the middle of the main dining area, despite the other area only have 2 customers. Normally, I wouldn't be upset at that, but because I've encountered some of the worst customer service I've experienced anywhere at this location, I knew it was par for the course.  For the most part the group got the lunch special (pizza & salad or pasta and salad). My pizza was fine, and I've never had bad food here, so again that is part of my love hate relationship with Metro.  Depending on the day your order could take 25 minutes or 45 minutes. With this large group we only waited 30, which I thought was actually pretty good. The server did struggle keeping up with our drink refills, but I am not going to hold that against them.  I will be honest, I only come to this location for work related meals. If it is for personal meals, I go to the Decatur and Flamingo location as its more quaint and never as busy. I wish I could say that Metro is worthy of their Best of Las Vegas, and maybe they are if it was solely based on food, but I think they need to re-think their service strategy if they want to continue their reign."}
{"text":"Just moved into the neighborhood and saw the \"Best of Las Vegas\" sign hanging outside so we decided to give it a try. First time there we ordered the atomic fries, the flying piggle and the sunspot, both pizzas individual sized. Everything was fantastic! We decided to try it again last night and did not have the same experience. This time around we ordered the flying piggle in a large size because we liked it so much the first time.... Not a good idea. It seemed like they took the same amount of ingredients from the small size and spread it out more to cover the large plus there was no bbq sauce on it at all.  Overall it is still good pizza just inconsistent. If we go back it will be for small pizzas only."}
{"text":"damn good thin crust, but not always consistent.   2-4-1 thursday slices ensure fresh pizza, and they'll make one just for slices if you don't get to weird on toppings.   BAKED fries!  good stuff.    Mediterranean salad is good filler to not eat the whole large pizza, balsamic is good."}
{"text":"After really enjoying the MP on Koval/Flamingo, I moved up to Centennial and was expecting the same.  Nope.    A bit pricey on the menu, for my cheap bastard standards, I waited for a sale.  yep - it was a dream come true:  They support homeless water drives, and had a 12\" cheese pizza in exchange for a 24pk of bottled water.    Albertsons had a coupon for 1.99 24pk of bottle water, so I dropped off three packs - got three cheese pizzas that barely made it out and into my truck I chomped them down.   As it was for the month, I probably had a dozen pizzas, supporting the water drive.    Buuut, my veteran monthly group opted to eat there, and so I was able to try the menu.  NY style pizza - avoid it.  LOTS of bread, not much sauce.   Stick with the standards - meat lovers, pepperoni, etc.    Always good service, but I miss the 2-4-1 slice or 2-4-1 large pizza specials that Koval has."}
{"text":"Wouldn't know about the food.  After waiting for 10 minutes for the girl to go back and forth several times to help the lady in-front of us with no resolution, I asked to be sat at a booth to which she had to go once again and ask her manager, Thomas if she could sit us at a larger table since it was the only booth available.  He refused to let us sit there so we ended up leaving.  Probably best because with the slowness and incompetence from the hostess and the utter lack of care for making customers welcome and catering to them, I would have hated to have to endure a whole dinner there.  On a good note, we drove down the road to Burger King and got much better service way faster."}
{"text":"My all time favorite pizza joint.  Never disappointed by the pizza, salads and service.  The decor has been the same for years which makes it Uber fun. Large booths and daily menu specials makes dining fun.   My top menu pics would be cheese pizza, Caesar salads and the chicken fingers."}
{"text":"Was house sitting for some friends so I thought I would treat myself to pizza and some fingers.   First off when I called to order the girl was upfront that the wait for a pick up order was running over an hour. Which was fine since I was driving in from work. When I got to Metro the pick up area was full of about 7 people ahead of me the space to wait is pretty small so it was crowded. As she rang up my order she let me know it would be about 10-15 more minutes again ....not a big deal.  After about 25 minutes and hearing her now yelling people that they had a huge last minute catering order come in and that was the reason for the delay. Another customer arrived and paid after me but she was given her food and offered a piece of cake for the delay yet I was handed my food and not offered anything for my delay which I found to be tacky. By this time it was just she and I waiting for goodness sake.   The pizza was good the fingers okay but for the price I would expect the experience and professionalism to be a bit better. Disappointing and I will visit other locations.           Other locations seem friendlier and more organized."}
{"text":"One of my family's favorite pizza joints!  We love the fun atmosphere and theme weekends, such as \"wear a Hawaiian shirt and get 50% off a large pizza.\"  Check their Facebook page for the current deals.  And the pizza is tasty, too.  My husband and sons' love the Loop stuffed pizza.  My daughter and I like the South Side stuffed pizza with added mushrooms and spinach.  Don't forget to try the Nuke fries.  You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"When you're in Vegas and you want some good pizza delivered, check out Metro. They've got most of Vegas covered. Since the closest shop had just sent their driver out, it was going to take a lot longer to get our pizza for delivery. They said it would be 20 minutes for pick-up. This gave us a great reason to go out and get beer. ;)  Got to Metro and the place was so cute. Red and white checkered tablecloths. It looked like the old school pizza places in NY in old movies, but in a cool, modern way.   The aroma that wafted from the pizza box on the way back to the hotel was driving me nuts. It smelled soooooooo good. Get back to the hotel, open that puppy up and there were just toppings galore and a taste that reminded me of my favorite pizza place back home.  Next time you're up for a little late night pizza, call Metro. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza. I generally like Metro Pizza, they serve solid New York style pies and have delicious meat ball sliders. I love that the meatballs are stuffed inside a garlic knot, it combines some of my favorite ingredients: meat, cheese, and garlic knots (YES PLEASE!). Well honestly, I'm not a huge fan of meatballs, but these have pretty good flavor, so I guess I'm a fan of Metro's meatballs. It's four meatball sliders in an order and they come with parmesan fries, delicious as well. We always do take out so I cannot speak on the dining experience."}
{"text":"Pizza from Metro? Yes please! My favorite pizza joint thus far! Their pepperoni and regular pizza are magically delicious! The sauce blends perfectly with cheese.The sauce has a bit of a sweet taste to it and is not overwhelming the overall taste. The amount of cheese is pretty generous and tasted like it was of good quality.   Also tried their calzone, they have a stand in UNLV and the pepperoni calzone I what convinced me make my way to the restaurant and try the pizza. Once I did, it was a match made in pizza heaven."}
{"text":"I ordered the Heart Shaped pizza and meatball sliders on V-day and it really hit the spot. My honey and I both had to work but wanted something easy that maintains the V-day spirit. Why not a heart shaped pizza? They had a special of a large heart shape with an extra topping for about $20 with tax. Pretty good deal! If you don't already know, Metro pizza serves up a pretty yum pie. I am familiar with a few of their locations, and this one did not taint the reputation.  My favorite thing from Metro however, is not the pizza. It is their meatball sliders with fries. BOMB! Yummy meatball sheltered in a garlic knot, YAS PLEASE! They are soooo good! The fries is really good too. Only complaint, fries portion shrinks every time we order the sliders. Please don't skimp on the fries! My experience with Metro is solely based on take out. I need to plan a time to dine-in."}
{"text":"This is the best place for calzones! They are huge and deliciouse.  The bread is right out of the oven.  Would defintely have to try if you are ever in Vegas.  Went here a while back."}
{"text":"The pizza is good but I feel it's overpriced.  I won't say it's the best pizza I have ever had but you can taste the quality. They don't have amazing specials like most pizza places. The wings are Good but only sold in small quantities.  The one thing that stops me from eating here more often is the lack of pizza and bucket of wing specials cause it doesn't exist."}
{"text":"I've been going to this location (and only this location) on and off for the past 8 years. Location is sketchy, but the food is worth it, and BOGO on Thursdays and Sundays. We just recently went to our first other Metro Pizza location in Henderson, and they suck compared to this one. Why are they different? I don't get it. The garlic knots here are humongous compared to the Henderson one and supposedly the Henderson one doesn't do BOGO (the people there weren't super nice either). We will forever be coming back to this place instead. Also, how come Metro Pizza doesn't give you receipts? Just thoughts."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday aftenoon and got seated pretty quickly. This was my first time here, surprising since this is a Vegas staple!   Tony was our server and I couldn't have asked for anyone better! He told us all about the restaurant and the menu.  They give you this amazing bread at the beginning which the pizza crust is made of. Then we ordered Garlic Romano Fries as our app. For our entrée we had Italian sausage spaghetti and a large Abbondanza pizza with garlic. AMAZING!  Not to mention our drinks stayed filled the whole time. Tony was so awesome and talked history of the place and we talked hockey forever. Such a cool guy with local knowledge. I'll definitely be back for the great food and best service."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Service was good and fast. This was our first time here and I highly recommend it. I'm a ceasers salad kind of girl and this has to be one of my favorite salads so far. Pizza was so yummy."}
{"text":"I've been going here since I was a kid and the food is just as great as it always was!"}
{"text":"Affordable, close to where I live and has a variety of good pizza options.  I generally go with my gluten-free friend and we order a GF Modesto pizza and an antipasto platter. (If you are extremely sensitive to gluten, I might not suggest the pizza due to cross-contamination.) While the GF pizza only comes in one size, it is enough for two hungry patrons. The antipasto platter is quite filling as well.  The wait for the pizza was a bit long (or maybe its just for the GF pizza?) the past few times I was there, but drinks are topped up consistently. Servers come by from time to inform us of the wait time / check in on us and they do not give us any hassle with our gluten-free requirements.  They have daily specials and whatnot, take one of their calendar flyers on your way out."}
{"text":"We all love pizza.  And this place is the best pizza place in Vegas.  Possibly the best pizza I've had anywhere.  My favorite is the Stockyard, a meat lovers pizza with pepperoni, sausage, and ground beef.  Its huge!  I can pack down a lot of groceries and this thing has got me beat.  One or two slices and I'm done.  The sauce is excellent.  It is loaded with meat and cheese.  WOW!!!  You gotta try this one.  Its a bit pricey at $27.95.  It took a while to come out, but this thing is worth waiting for.  Not in the mood for a massive pizza that is sure to provide plenty of leftovers?  Try the calzone.  I had it once and really enjoyed it.  Parking was not an issue when I've gone.  I enjoyed the atmosphere.  There is another location on Decatur, but I don't like the old time decor.  If you only eat here on occasion, then make the drive over to Tropicana."}
{"text":"Had my worst experience at any restaurant here.  Last year, took my wife and little girl to eat here.  The service was terrible. Group came in after us and got there food before we did!  Also was waiting 15 min before they took our drink order.  When pizza came we just took it to go.   I told girl in front counter my concern and she just smirked and brushed me off.  I'm still bitter about it.  I do believe they are prejudice at this location.  I loved the Metro at Ellis Island and the location at tropicana completely turned me off from the Metro brand!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Metro Pizza for years and they always have great food and excellent service! The location on Sky Pointe Dr is my local Metro Pizza and I've never been disappointed! Metro is one of the best pizza places in town!"}
{"text":"We loved Metro pizza and have eaten there for years. It the last 2 or 3 pizzas we have gotten have been very grease and not up to par"}
{"text":"Metro Pizza is one of my two favorite local go to pizza spots. They are located in a large parking center so there is plenty of parking. This location gets pretty busy in the evenings, but we've never waited more than 20 minutes.   The food is always really good and they offer more than just standard pizza. By far my favorite thing here is the sliders that they serve on their garlic knots. We usually get the meatball sliders which are buttery, meaty, and cheesy. The sliders come four to a plate and my husband and I usually split an order in addition to a pizza. We recently tried the shrimp sliders with diavolo sauce which has a spicy twist and they were almost as good as the meatball sliders.   The bread that they bring before the meal looks boring and bland, but is actually very tasty with some serious crunch. In order to incorporate vegetables I usually get a small house salad which is kind of a boring salad, but the house Italian is awesome and dresses it up. The small salad is actually enough for two people to split if you are ordering other food.  Every pizza I've had here is good, but my favorites are The Flying Piggle (BBQ pork, pickles, and onion strings) and the Seafood Fra Diavolo (shrimp, calamari, and a spicy marinara sauce). We usually split a small pizza because we order other items. The large pizza is ridiculously large and definitely too much for two people. We learned this the hard way.  The atmosphere here reminds me of an old school small town family pizza spot. It's cool to have a place in Las Vegas that is not only local, but has a local feel."}
{"text":"I recently dined here in a group for the Metro Pizza's Slice Out Hunger $1 pizza slice night. This was a well organized and tasty event. I love that Metro does events like this for the community.  The event was easy to enjoy. Upon arrival we purchased tickets for $1 and each ticket was good for a slice of pizza. From there we grabbed plates and went down the line choosing from a nice selection of their pizzas. I loved the white pizza with garlic and the specialty pumpkin pizza. It was a nice way to also try a variety of their menu options. Our table enjoyed all of the pizza offerings. The only thing that could be slightly improved would have been the service on this night. It was difficult to find a server to get a drink or order other menu items. We had empty drinks most of the evening.  I've dined here in the past and found this location to have great food. The service was also great for a regular dining experience."}
{"text":"This is OK pizza, crust is thicker than I like toppings were just OK.  Nice little restaurant, good service, nice bar.  Honestly I've had better pizza in Vegas on the strip, but if you're in the area and hungry this place fits the bill."}
{"text":"Came here to cure a hangover and it worked. Metro has always been one of my favorite pizza places in Vegas! It's a New York style gourmet pizza. They serve wine and beer as well. I've only ever had their pizza and salads and it never disappoints. Friendly staff as well"}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere! Been a fan of Metro Pizza for over 20 years and like the Henderson location the best. Its so big and clean and the staff is so friendly.  Even though the pizza is awesome, my favorite meal is the wings with a side salad.  The wings are cooked thoroughly with crispy skin and the mild sauce is just the right amount of spice (the hot is for the very adventurous only!)    We usually come about twice a month.  Its a family favorite and were all loving the new Happy Hour menu."}
{"text":"Only came here because Naked Pizza was 21 and over.  I am glad we did.  Pizza was excellent."}
{"text":"Metro pizza is a Las Vegas locals pizza place. It's NOT cheap but they are pretty consistent.  Most recently we had a lunch caterered in at work and everything was quite good.  The delivery & setup man was fantastic he made sure we had everything and extra.  We ordered the salad, garlic knots, baked ziti and chicken parmesan. The food was hot,cheesy and the chicken had crunch.   I couldn't find myself shelling out $40 for pizza & breadsticks but it was a nice treat."}
{"text":"Fairly new location.  Great food and environment.  Perhaps I'm slightly biased growing up in Vegas, visiting this chain on occasion.  You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Amazing! My boyfriend was the first to show me this place. Since then I I've been addicted to their baked ziti. And don't even get me started on their calzones. Love them! Nothing fancy. Or too expensive. The portion sizes are more than enough.  Always taking home leftovers. And they are even bomber reheated in the oven."}
{"text":"Horrible service via telephone. My wife has been on hold for over 5 minutes and yet no one seems to care. I am calling from my cellphone and all lines are busy. What's sad is that is our first time (trying it out cause of recommendations) and I already have to give it a bad review."}
{"text":"Restaurant was empty and hostess tried to seat us at a dirty table. All the other tables were clean and set up. I had to ask for a clean table!! Makes no sense! Food and service were good."}
{"text":"I came here with my boyfriend their pizza is SO amazing, we got half meat lovers pizza and half Hawaiian pizza, the 16 inch one is big but I'd still get it over the smaller one. Overall the pizza is BOMB and the service is excellent, the only thing is the music.. Ugh! It would be so chill if they played 80s music. Idk if they are able to control the music but it would be chill if the music matched the theme of the place. Great place for a fun date, family, or group of friends!"}
{"text":"Don't let the pictures fool you. The first time I saw the photos that are posted, I was not amused. I settled with this restaurant because it was the only one near my neighborhood that would deliver. Metro fooled me! The deliverer came with a nice silver portable table to utilize so he would not struggle with anything in his hands. Clever! I ordered a thick crust combo pizza and buffalo wings. Metro hooked me up! Not only was the crust thick, the entire pizza was! The wings were awesome! They do not drown the wings and drumettes in buffalo sauce. They add just the right amount of sauce that does not mask the flavor of the chicken. Metro, I'm definitely keeping you in my book for pizza!"}
{"text":"Great food, great pizza, great people. Love the ambience and the wait is worth it. I grew up in Vegas and this is the best pizza around!"}
{"text":"Came here for a dinner with a large party. We ordered a bunch of items, some of the favorites were the bleaker pizza, meatball subs with fries, boneless buffalo wings. The buffalo wings were really good and spicy, the pizza was delicious, and I had the ceaser salad also which was good also. They even give you bread before your meal which is pretty good bread. The decor reminds me of the Saved by the Bell Cafe though."}
{"text":"Amazing!! Food is great!!! We had the Gotham and the Nopali pizzas. Katie our server was very friendly with a great attitude. Overall food, atmosphere, price, and service was 5/5. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"I did a Modesto with the Ricotta and Meatballs from the Spring Street on a thin, extra crispy crust. It was pizza perfection! In fact, they should make it a menu item just like that, call it the Farino Metro!"}
{"text":"Dammit, you spend 30.00 for a pizza, please teach your employees some customer service skills! I hand you my money, and you say thank you. Its really just that easy.  Everyone wants 15.00 an hour, for what?  good pizza, but no people skills."}
{"text":"I'm pretty picky with pizzerias, and I've been to a few of them, this one is one of my top favorites. The fact that it's super close to my house is already a huge plus making it my local pizza parlor. The sliders are crack, the pizzas are not very salty which I love, and they're very giving to the community. AND they have an awesome lunch special with salad and a drink included. Did I mention that they have a bakery and gelato place in the building too? Yea, this place is the bomb."}
{"text":"This was my first visit. I parked in the front (so I thought) but it was actually the back. I think that this signage must be weird. The area I parked was for a business in the same building but it was closed. I walked around the building to the \"front\" and found the door labeled \"metro pizza pick-up only\". I was confused! I stood there (looking dumb) and a man walked up. He explained the ACTUAL entrance was around the corner but that I could cut through the \"pick-up only\" area to reach the full-service restaurant. How utterly confusing! I think that they need a lot better signage!  I was joining a geocaching group for a meet & greet so I found a table with 2 people (the entire group encompassed about 8 tables). The people at my table had finished eating already and their dirty plates were sitting at the end of the table (ready to be picked up by staff). No one brought me a menu so I went to an adjacent table where there were extra. A waitperson came and took my order and picked up one of the pile of dirty dishes (1 of 2). The calzone came out and the lady started to walk away. I flagged her down and asked for silverware.  I had the CHICKEN HERB CALZONE and it was very good. I enjoyed everything about it! On the down-side, I felt the accompanying marinara sauce was watery and bland.  Additional comments: Pro: pleasant atmosphere, good for groups, reasonably priced, good portion sizes, tasty food. Neutral: customer service was a little sketchy but I get the feeling that it was b/c it was a group event with people arriving at different times. Con: the second pile of dishes never got cleared even though waitstaff walked past our table repeatedly. Finally, I was never served bread even though some tables had 2 plates of bread. I didn't request any b/c I knew the calzone would be adequate but they really should have provided the bread since EVERYONE else was given it.  I recommend this place even though I only gave it 3 stars (\"a-ok\")."}
{"text":"What has happened to Metro Pizza? Have they expanded too far around the valley? Have they put too much effort into Lulu's? I'm not sure, but the pizza I ordered from here was pretty dang bad.   On a busy weekend running chores my husband and I decided, hey, let's get pizza. So I called in an order to Metro Pizza. Pretty simple: large pizza, ham, and mushrooms. The lady told me it would be ready in 30 minutes for pick-up. Perfect!  We picked it up with no problem, got it home and sat down to eat. First off, I realize we had to drive it home, but it was luke-warm when we opened the box. I have this feeling it had been cooked WAY before the 30 minute pick-up time indicated and had been sitting around for us to actually get there for it.  The dough went from crusty-super-crunchy on the crust of the pizza, to doughy-soft at the inside of the pizza. The cheese, to me, was disappointing, clumpy and not good. This pizza was just plain: not good.  I hate to do it, because I love Metro. I have for a long time. But, I am sad to say their quality may be slipping. Best Pizza in Vegas? Nah, not anymore."}
{"text":"Always a good eat spot with cool atmosphere for my family and I, we love the Metro Pizza.  Great pies, delicious salads, cold beer and friendly service.  From the hot fresh bread and butter (love those toasted sesame seeds!!!) to the \"nuke\" fries (get the honey cayenne on the side) Metro Pizza rocks.  The only thing they have changed in recent memory that I miss is the option of coloring on a paper table cloth at the Henderson location.  My kids and I are doodlers!  Bring back the crayons, MP!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars because the 2 for one deal is great and you can get a stuffed pizza and a free regular pizza, too.   The stuffed pizza is about the best I've ever had..  Sausage is sooooo tasty.  Crust is so yeasty and good."}
{"text":"One of the best, if not the best in Vegas! I love the sunspot pizza, the hot chicken fingers and nuclear fries are super yummo too!!! Plus they have awesome Ranch dressing! Can you tell I'm from Vegas???? The place is hella 80's and looks like the maxx from saved by the bell, but don't be fooled this place rules!"}
{"text":"love it. plain and simple. they have great employees that are beyond helpful and attentive.  there pizza ranges from thick crust to thin crust, and of course i love the Chicago style stuffed pizza being from Chicago myself. the other thing is that they have salad which makes my nephew very happy.  when we were there last time the owner came over and talked to us. he handed out candy to my nephew and asked how everything was. perfect of course.  we got a large Hawaiian and a large Gotham ( love that one cause I'm a batman fan, lol) both were fantastic and we had tons of leftovers.  we also got salad for the nephew, and spinach artichoke dip which is new to the menu. the dip was great the only complaint is that it didn't really have great bread with it.  the other thing they have is a monthly calender that has special deals and name days . so if your name or birthday are on a specific day you get 50% off a large pizza. that's a great deal. they also have wear certain items and you get discounts. you can sign up and have this calender sent to your house which comes with more coupons.  all and all a great value and great food and great service.  go you wont regret it."}
{"text":"The two stars are because the food is good.  They got 0 stars for service.   I recently went to this metro pizza location for the first time.  I went during lunch since they have a 1/2 off pizza special before 4pm.   My issue started when I showed the server my check in redemption for one free non-alcoholic beverage.    This tall brown haired server immediately thought I was probably a cheapskate and not going to tip well.  His demeanor became lackluster and nonchalant as if my presence was that of a nuisance he couldn't be bothered with.   The worst part is I love metro pizza.  I have Been going to the Decatur and flamingo locations as well as the Ellis island location for more than half a decade.   I never had an issue with those locations.   * please do not offer a discount if your workers are going to act in such an imbecilic manner to its patrons for fear of a tipping issue.  If the service is impeccable and well deserving of a 20% or higher of the unadjusted bill prior to discount, the server should not be worried.   After it was all said and done, I being the bigger man.  Approached the server informing him that his 25% tip was left on the card and let him know I usually tip in cash ( screw the IRS ).   Now he can enjoy having to be forced to claim the tip on his taxes.    I was so flustered from my service experience that I had left my box of pizza slices I had to go on the table.   Anyone who knows me will tell you that I never let good food go to waste."}
{"text":"Take out very inconsistent.  Today the pizza was paper thin and chewy.  Have given them the benefit many times but no longer.  Will go back to cuginos on Decatur even though the drive is longer.  Cheaper and much better quality."}
{"text":"Great place to have pizza and wings and nuke fries great customer service every time I go"}
{"text":"A bit overrated...  Considering all its accolades, I was not wowed by the pizza at Metro. I can name dozens of places I've been to with better pizza. Price and bad service by employees who appear to be CCSN rejects doesn't help either, but the atmosphere was nice."}
{"text":"Today I had the Steinbrenner calzone! As always, perfectly cooked and delicious. The servers in this place are quick and friendly. Holly is my fav, always having a joke or a story to share. My other go to dish is the chopped chicken salad. Their house dressing is the bomb. And don't pass on that bread, it's made fresh daily in house, and served warm. This place is a must add to your pizza dining list."}
{"text":"After a fun filled night in Vegas that lasts till the wee hours of the morning there's only one thing that's on eveyone's mind when they wake up, food! As my friends and I drove to Metro's we could smell the aroma of hot pizza in the air. Walking in you get this sense of community and family. Everyone is very friendly and helpful. I was the greenhorn out of my group so the waitress was very helpful in recommending dishes that she thought I'd like. We ordered 2 pizzas. Your typical pepperoni and one Greek. Both were very tasty. What makes a good pizza is 2 things: the sauce and the crust. Both were really good. The crust was nice and crunchy.  Food: Good Service: Awesome Atmosphere: Friendly Price: A little pricey for pizza Impression: I'd come back. It was a good hangover remedy."}
{"text":"Just got home from having dinner here, we arrived at 4:40. The place was dead our sever was Ernest who was either smoking something before his shift or drinking. We sat down and another couple was seated after us, they received drinks and bread before we did. Okay no problem then Ernest comes over to take our order and is on something it is like talking to the wall because we have to repeat ourselves a few times. The table that was sat after us didn't receive their salad the lady was clearly upset, we received our appetizer garlic cheese bread, it was cold. When Ernest brought over our pitcher of beer he spilled most of it on our table and the floor, he laughed and said oh let me top off your pitcher. We ordered the football special- large one topping pizza, wings and a pitcher of beer. The pizza came out- it was so greasy, we had to ask for our wings two times before they came out. Another server had to step in because we wanted refills and desert. I really liked this place but after tonight's service and food I would rather goes elsewhere."}
{"text":"I love love love this place!!! Their Modesto with sausages is SO DELICIOUS!!!! My family and I love their random calender specials and kids night. We always go there, very worth the money!! :-)"}
{"text":"I always order Metro Pizza for work events. Old New York and Pepperoni w salad and a dozen canoli's are always what we get. Their prices are definitely more expensive than other pizza places but worth it! And the catering department is AWESOME!  Jessica is always so courteous and easy to order with."}
{"text":"They use some sort of a butter-rich mozzarella in the pizza and they have a ravioli (that you can add Italian sausage to) that will feed your for several days or can split between a party of 3 or 4.   I think I could just dine of the bread appetizer they serve as long as the butter holds out!  We've been coming here for about 25 years!"}
{"text":"A good place for pizza and Monday through Thursday from 2 to 4 it's happy hour so all pizzas are half price, and alcohol is a good price too."}
{"text":"Fantastic.  Had a small Abbonanza pizza and my friend who is vegetarian had the Margarita pizza. It was delicious! Also had the fries and for desert the canoles. I'd heard about this place for being authentic NY pizza. Metro is owned by two cousins who started working in the family pizza business 40 years ago and have brought that same magic to seven locations in Las Vegas! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Excellent fresh tasting pizza and good service in Saved By the Bell/The Max and/or poor man's Chuck E. Cheese setting. However, I was bit disappointed with stinginess of veggie toppings. Judging from the peeling walls, carpeted floors and location, this is definitely one of the older locations. But fellow patron, don't eschew it because of that; it's actually a glowing gem hidden amongst a dilapidated shopping plaza. No wonder it's beloved by Vegas citizens.  I ordered the Green Valley pizza but what came was Death Valley. The pizza was layered with lots of black olives and sun dried tomatoes. I asked for added broccoli, too. A pizza with an adjective green should be green, right? Not this one. I wanted to feast on a fucking evergreen forest. Nope, it was a vast black desert with patches of green. The ratio between canned and fresh cut veggies had to be 4:1. At least it tasted great and the service was prompt and kind. Next time I'm asking for no olives and sun dried tomato and extra zuchinni."}
{"text":"WAY TO BOMB METRO PIZZA! EVERYONE I know for a FACT who lives in Centennial was waiting...and waiting...and waiting for this place to open because after all the other locations are AMAZING! But WHAT THE HOLY HELL happened with this one?? WORST salad ever and my treasured garlic knots tasted literally like sweat..yes SWEAT! SO disappointed in this location. I bet people who like this place have not tried the other locations. They should, then they would see that this location SUCKS!! Guess I will continue driving all the way to Tropicana!"}
{"text":"Gotta love when the food arrives under the estimated time and is piping hot! Got the Cicero this time (stuffed pizza/meatball)!  Yum!"}
{"text":"This is my parents go to spot for pizza around Vegas. We recently came on a Saturday night for dinner and were quickly seated and helped. The servers and staff are always super friendly here.  We started our meal with a large house salad. It was a big enough portion size to split between about 4 of us. I also have to say props to their ranch, it's definitely some of the best tasting. We then had garlic knots to split as well. These were very tasty, but super hot temp wise so be careful before digging right into these bad boys. For pizzas we went with a margarita and one large with sausage, mushrooms and onions. Both were delicious, but I wish the crust on the margarita was a little bit crispier.  Overall this is a great pizza restaurant with a few other great sides and goodies. I'm sure I'll be back again and again."}
{"text":"If you're ever in doubt on what to order off this menu- take my advice- order the metro pizza. If heaven was a food, this would be it. The globs of cheese... the sauce... the damn fluffy yeasty bread!!! I don't even like pizza and this just made my week. I don't even care that I paid an additional $7 to have it delivered by santa clause (I'm not even kidding.. he told me so). this pizza was was so good that it made me wanna slap my mama."}
{"text":"Love this place. Just had the Cicero stuffed pizza......awesome."}
{"text":"When staying next door at the Super 8 Koval, this is certainly a convenient option if you don't have time to go elsewhere for dinner, though certainly not the cheapest in town. Their vegetarian pizzas are pretty good and full of toppings and it is better than your average Pizza Hut, Little Caesar's, Domino's, etc. I have ordered from their location at least 4-5 times in the last couple years that I visted Vegas, and the service has been okay.  The thing I didn't really like is that even if you're staying next door at the Super 8, they will add on a delivery charge (I believe it was $3; what!!?) to get your order to your room, so you might as well just go to the counter, order, then come back in about 15-20 minutes or so and then pick up your pizza. Come on, the prices are pretty expensive as they are; how much more money does Metro Pizza really need?"}
{"text":"This is more of a customer service review since I ended up not being able to eat here because of an allergy. I realistically didn't think I could eat here, but I figured the worst I could do is call and find out if I could eat anything at a party I got invited to. The guy I spoke to was very nice about answering my questions, but wasn't very knowledgeable about the ingredients in the food. (he seriously started talking about ranch and blue cheese when I asked if any of the salad dressings were dairy free, lol!) So obviously I won't be eating here any time soon, but I did want to leave a good review for the customer service since I have encountered restaurants that aren't so nice about answering questions about the food."}
{"text":"The quality and the taste of the food was good.  Our party consisted of three children and three adults.  All the food came out at different times.   The rest of us were done eating by the time my husband got his pizza, and it arrived with a topping (green peppers) he had asked them to delete as the peppers make him sick.  They remade the pizza, and we ended up taking it home.  The restaurant did not appear busy.  I suppose they were just having a bad day."}
{"text":"So Metro Pizza is my favorite pizza place. But their \"May calendar of savings\" has May8-12 as Teacher appreciation week. and then May 15 is firefighter appreciation day. But May 8-14 is national police appreciation week. Can las enforcement get some love too?"}
{"text":"First time checking out Metro Pizza, which apparently came to a shock to my co-workers! Always wanted to try them though, so I was excited to order through grubhub.com.     We ordered two small pizzas, one pepperoni and one supreme, a pepperoni with extra cheese calzone, a chicken parmigana sandwich, a eggplant parmigana sandwich and an order of garlic balls.   The garlic balls were YUMMY, smothered in garlic and their oil. The only other items I got to try next was the calzone and the eggplant parmigana sandwich. The calzone was really good, I loved that it's packed full of ricotta cheese. The eggplant sandwich was just okay, the eggplant didn't seem too ripe so I wouldn't order it again. Something to take note of though, my co-worker, who has frequented Metro Pizza a lot in the past, made the comment that the pizza wasn't the same quality as before.     The girl on the phone and our delivery driver was both really polite and helpful. If we go with them again for lunch I won't be getting their eggplant."}
{"text":"Good Pie!  Sort of sterile vibe, but hey it's Vegas. It was open late enough so ah yea I'm a fan."}
{"text":"My family loves Metro Pizza! They have the best pizzas in town. We love their Sun Spot with chicken and artichokes, or their Gotham (but we leave off the hamburger). We also like their salads and chicken fingers. Fries are always hot and crisp. If you are a blue cheese des sing fan, their's is the best. Ranch isn't too bad either."}
{"text":"This is the first meal we have every time we go to Vegas. The pizza is by far the best this side of the Mississippi. The first time I ate here it reminded me of the taste I was used to getting in my home town of Chicago. The sauce they use is second to none. The sausage is perfect. My wife loves the mushrooms. Usually before the pizza arrives they bring you some bread and butter appetizer to snack. I usually order my pizza about 10 minutes before we arrive at this location and it is waiting for us. Have gotten to know Ann one of the managers there over the years and she always takes care of us. Always greets us with a smile. Our last few trips I have ordered a side salad for starters and their house Italian dressing is outstanding. Monday thru Thursday between 2:30 and 4:30 all pizzas eaten inside are half off. The best pizza in Vegas as far as we are concerned. The inside of the place could use some upgrades but other than that this place is a gem."}
{"text":"Tasty! Tasty! Tasty! Never had Metro Pizza but had always heard bout it. Not a big fan of New York thin pizza but good pizza is good pizza. Friendly staff. Two for one Thursday slices or pizzas. Two for one larges on Sunday. Will definitely have more often."}
{"text":"I am a regular here, so it pains me to complain. But if a restaurant is going to be open New Year's Eve, the service should be as good as any other night. It wasn't. Had to ask for bread and was given a burned end right out of the oven, too hot to handle. Was subjected involuntarily to a long chat between a waiter and his buddy as they hung out kibitzing within earshot of my booth. Waiter dropped the bill, then vanished. I got sick of waiting and took the check to the front myself. This was at 500 pm. There are many pizza places in Las Vegas. I won't be back for awhile, even though their food is tasty."}
{"text":"Decent enough pizza but amazing service for being the last table of the night. We were treated great and we loved the beer pitchers too!"}
{"text":"It's decent enough if you want particular toppings and happen to be near. Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here. Wouldn't highly recommend dining in either, as service takes some time (1 hr for an order on a Friday evening). There are better options"}
{"text":"Treating my birthday girl to a very good pizza dinner and totally embarrassed her by having the whole staff sing to her. A great way to turn 13 years old."}
{"text":"This review is bc of the horrible service me and my boyfriend received yesterday. Specifically, the waitress who was assigned to our section. She was short with us the whole time we were there. Not friendly at all. Yet she was chatting it up with the table right next to us for about 5 minutes after she took our order. Maybe they were her friends. Who knows? But the thing that really made me mad is she purposely made jokes about \"raiders fans\" talking extra loud so my boyfriend can hear. I know she saw the raiders hat he was wearing. She just finished taking our order then went on to the next table and started making jokes about the exact team he was wearing. I just think that's rude and NOT professional. I don't care how you feel about the raiders!   For the rest of the time there she just ignored us. She looks at my empty drink (I saw bc we made eye contact), walks past twice but never said/did anything. We couldn't even get a refill until we asked.   The point is, we did not receive the same level of service she was giving the other table RIGHT NEXT TO US!   My boyfriend wanted to leave her .20 tip but I felt bad so we left her $2. I still don't feel she deserved it though. I just hate not tipping."}
{"text":"Metro has arguable the best pizza in town but honestly this location has been getting run over since it opened. If you haven't had the best service or food given them another chance when the madness dies down. Order the antipasti plater, meatball sliders a pie of your choice."}
{"text":"We originally went to the Metro Pizza in Ellis Island and it was great!  We came to this location and the food was very blah.  The italian sauce on the food was very boring.  After we were done eating all the waitresses dissapeared and we had to wait about 20 Minutes for a box and our bill.  The second time we came in we were seated and greeted and given drinks. They didnt have the beer I wanted. Then we were ignored for 20 Minutes again, we left money on the table for our drinks and left, in the meantime I saw approximately 7 employees standing around doing nothing. I dont think we'll be back"}
{"text":"This place always has great tasting pizzas & great service. Haven't had a bad experience yet!"}
{"text":"What I miss about my New York heritage is the food that I grew up with. Especially the egg plant Parmesan hero on toasted bread. Metro Pizza has reunited me with the eggplant Parmesan hero on toasted bread. The majority of the time that I dine in Metro Pizza this is what I order.     This location is the newest Metro Pizza to open in  Las Vegas. Ever since we drove back from the Spring Mountains this previous summer, I have been anticipating the opening of the restaurant.     In a way, this Metro Pizza is roadside architecture. It stands at the northeast corner of US 95 and the 215, where the spaghetti bowl of the northwest valley will probably be built. At the time that I write this, the motorist has to maneuver through a maze of roadways to access the parking lot from US 95. Once in the parking lot, you are looking at the back of the building. You have to walk around the building to get inside. When you get to the front of the building, there are two entrances. One is a take out entrance in a room that sells gelatos  and other foods. The second entrance is for dining in.    The dining room is large, and I feel nicely themed. To the right is a bar with flags of colleges hanging above. Toward the back is a mural of popular pizza families. To the back left is the open kitchen. And to the left is the take out room slash bakery. Throughout the restaurant is sufficient seating.     Before entering Metro Pizza my mind was decided on ordering the eggplant Parmesan hero on toasted bread. At a cost of around $10, it is worth the money. Especially when it includes french fries. For the most part, I was happy with the hero. I do have a tiny weenie complaint. The hero could of been warmer.    In general the service was good. Yeah, there was a wait for the food. I expected that on a Friday night. Our waitress was on top of the complimentary dinner roll refills. By the way, I ended up filling up on them. Toward the end of the meal, the waitress probably had a brain fart. This would be one of the strangest moments I experienced dining out. It was material for a Sinfeld episode. When the meal ended, my brother and I ordered coffee. A few minutes later, our waitress returns to the table. She goes up to my brother and says this is the last of the coffee and we are brewing more. I am thinking, \"Excuse me. Am I invisible? Could you have asked if one of us wanted the coffee, or let us know that more coffee was coming on the way?\" Feeling like the ghost of Metro Pizza, I sat there watching my brother sip coffee for what seemed like a good five minutes. When I returned to being a physical being again, the waitress presented me with coffee served in an Izzy cup. I was under the impression that they brewed their own coffee. They serve Izzy coffee. My taste buds regard it as decent. If I had brought it in a coffee shop I would of added a flavored syrup to it.     I will return to Metro Pizza. Their egg plant Parmesan hero is a product that keeps me coming back.  ........This is review 68 of my 2013 Yelp 100 Challenge......"}
{"text":"The pizza is good ,fresh ingredients and the cashier is so nice. I have become a repeat customer after ordering here two times."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok...crust overcooked.. Service was ok..cleanliness of restaurant questionable"}
{"text":"Decent slices of combo. Fresh baked and fill in the needs. Service was super friendly!"}
{"text":"Aside from a few specialty pizza places I've been to, this is some of the yummiest pizza in Vegas. The service is friendly and they have consistent quality ingredients. This is our top pick when dining out with the kids and extended family. My favorite is the Gotham but my husband likes the Old NY or Spring Street, so they split the pie so we are both happy! As a cheese lover I also ask for extra cheese.  They also have a wine special which is quite reasonable at $15 per bottle!"}
{"text":"Best Pizza in The Green Valley area.  I like this spot alot, obviously came in for pizza and wasn't disappointed.  Also the calamari appetizer is pretty darn good as well.  Decent beer selection.  Staff is friendly and very helpful.  If you have kids they give out  pizza dough for them to play with, which is good cuz they have fun with it and it keeps them busy.  They have daily specials on this little calendar  they put on your table, so check them out.  Two draw backs are as follows.....a lil pricey and can get pretty busy during the weekend other than that LilMark gives it a Good to Go."}
{"text":"Pizza is the closest to New York style that I have tasted in Nevada. We have eaten here several times, had the Sicilian with pepperoni, pizza pies with various toppings. Preference is to go, the Decatur location is a bit cold, and outdated. The pizza is very good"}
{"text":"When having a pizza, I pay attention to their cheese, tomato sauce and  crust. These are the basics and they are crucial building blocks of a pizza.  The choice of cheese used and tomato sauce have a lot of bearing on the pie that's being cooked in the oven. I have to say their toppings, and service here  were phenomenal. However, I was not at all impressed with their sauce and crust. It wasn't anything to hold me to this place.  I'd go back here and try some of their sandwiches like the meatball sliders. It was overall mediocre I'd say."}
{"text":"Came in with a few friends around 1:30-2 on a Friday afternoon. It wasn't packed but it wasn't empty, good amount of tables filled up. We were seated right away.   We were started off with bread. Idk if I was just hungry, but their bread was pretty good! I ordered a #1 off of the lunch special menu & dubbed the salad for garlic knots. You get 2! So I received the garlic knots first & holy hell. I think they might've been the best garlic knots I've ever had. It was hot, fresh, garlicky, & amazing with marinara. I would come back everyday just for those. Then, my pizza came. I swear on my life I thought the menu said individual pizza... & I thought that meant one slice of pizza... nope. It had 6 slices. I took myself to carb-o-load town & went ham. I couldn't finish the pizza, I tried & could only eat 3 lol. The pizza was good too!   The server that we had was great. She didn't come by very often but she was very nice. I felt bad cos we had to ask for the check to be split among 8 people... yeah. Sorry!! Anyway, I know I'll be coming back for those garlic knots."}
{"text":"5 Stars. This is now my favorite pizza place as I seem to order from them at least once a week, and sometimes much more. Katie (I hope I spelled her name right), is now bringing it when it comes to great customer service and when she says 25 min, my order is ready in 25 min. And while my first experience here was not the best, since that time I've not had any messed up orders and I find myself more and more impressed with the place.   While Settebello is still my ultimate pizza in Vegas, for day to day classic pizzas without much fuss, Metro is hard to beat. I do wish they would reserve a space or two for carryout parking, but otherwise...I can't really complain."}
{"text":"My wife and I each ordered a slice of cheese pizza at this outlet of Metro Pizza.  The toppings were greasy, the crust limp and the price too dear for us to ever make that mistake again."}
{"text":"Great pizza option when you want something with a more local flavor. Metro Pizza has been a Las Vegas favorite for quite some time and after the first bite you can see why. The crust is thin and the toppings are fresh. It is the type of pizza best eaten the same day though. I am a fan of next-day-pizza, but I don't think their pizza holds up very well the day after. Plus, there are very few occasions where there is any pizza left to even have for the next day.  My favorite pizza from them is their white pizza which has a white garlic sauce on it and chicken. The Gotham is another popular option, which has bell peppers, olives, sausage, and onions. The pepperoni is a safe option as well. I will advise to order in advance if you have a large order though and/or if you need delivery. Peak times are definitely lunch hours 12-3 pm, Fridays, and weekends.   For example, if you need 5 large pizzas to be delivered I wound order a week in advance if you know when your event is happening. You will have to talk to their Catering Department, but they are very helpful and will make sure your order is accurate. Karoline and Sara are part of the Catering Department and they are super helpful and friendly. I suggest to order early if you need delivery because their delivery availability fills up fast. So last minute party orders might mean someone will have to go pick it up, but they will do their best to accommodate if they can. Pricing can be a little higher than average, but you get a good portion. Just to note, their large has 8 large slices, but they can cut it to 12 small slices. The medium could feed 3 or 4 people. Worth trying at least once if you haven't and if you have, it's worth having to treat yourself from the usual run of the mill."}
{"text":"Good quality pizza but slightly pricey (like some quality pizza places can be).  A couple unique menu options- we went with one, called East Street Style..I think; cheese layered first with drops of marinara, it was cheesy & tasty!  Service was good even tho a little slow.  I was surprised by the more casual vibe here- for some reason it wasn't what I expected.  Beer & wine only- no liquor.  I'd go back but we are huge fans of Pizza Rock & the prices are comparable but the vibe & menu seems more fun there."}
{"text":"I've always had a great experience here for dinner. The food is great! Starting with their fresh baked bread. Caesar salad is really great and they even have anchovies. This time I had the fettuccini Alfredo with chicken. My friend had a calzone with pepperoni and meatballs and he devoured it. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"We ordered one of their specialty pizzas with clams and garlic combined (forgot what the name was for it) & a Caesar salad. For our drinks we ordered coke and their flavored peach ice tea. I liked their peach tea a lot & I wouldn't recommend putting sugar in it because it comes already sweet. The pizza we ordered had a lot of garlic in it so if you like garlic I would recommend getting it. You can also definitely taste the clams inside & it was quite delicious. Caesar salad was served with bread too & I enjoyed it! I felt like the service was a lil slow & for as busy as it seemed we didn't see a lot of servers making their rounds. Overall good was great though!"}
{"text":"The food and service are usually good here. Jarvis, your poor service just lost a customer  tonight. The newcastle is what we usually come here for. Had to ask for napkins, asked the bus boy for a beer refill, no water or milk refills. No utensils for the butter with our bread, gave us the wrong bill for stuff we didn't order. I left a more than generous tip for what service we got. Step up yo game Jarvis or you'll lose more customers for Metro! All on national cheese pizza day and Made sure I showed up late to skip the dinner rush. It is now 8:58 pm you can see the time and day on the receipt."}
{"text":"The office manager at work decided to buy everyone lunch today - presumably because we are all just awesome people - or maybe because we were super busy and she didn't want anyone to leave for lunch in fear we would not come back.  Either way, enter Metro Pizza! ta da!  Figuring that everyone likes pizza, she ordered a large one of each of the basics food groups: pepperoni & cheese veggie everything but the kitchen sink Hawaiian and plain cheese  I thoroughly enjoyed the pepperoni and cheese - greasy good.  The hawaiian (you'd think ham and pineapple, right?) was a surprise.  Apparently Metro calls it the \"Honolulu\" and its got all this extra crap on it - onions, bell peppers,and bacon bits.  I was less than thrilled at having to remove all the excess crap to fulfill my craving for hawaiian.  But, the crust was good, and the extra pepperoni slice I had made up for it.  I didn't dare touch the veggie - it looked crazy - cucumber, onions, all sorts of bell peppers and artichokes.   yuck.  But I didn't hear any complaints from the rest of the crowd and that pizza was devoured, so I guess it was pretty good.  The delivery guy was the BEST.  He offered us plates, napkins, etc, even though we didn't ask for them.    All in all, not a bad (free) lunch."}
{"text":"I like this pizza. It's not like, the best, but it's good. We have been here twice and both times we have ordered the pepperoni (large is 16\"), garlic knots and this time, the wings. They forgot our ranch though (we took it to go). I wouldn't recommend the wings for take out, they have potential to be better when dining in, but we probably won't be ordering them again. Also, forget dining in. The neon lights and the crazy 80s diner pizza combo just freaks me out. We will order again, however! And maybe next time, we will try something new."}
{"text":"Good pizza, the quality of toppings used are worth going. Only issue i have is related to delivery. They have always arrived with the center of the pizza being completely soggy, as if it was undone completely (doughy). But it is the method for which the pizza is placed in the box and steam to death I guess. Out of all the pizzas I have ordered all over this country, this was a new one for me. I had spoke with a manager (Chris) there before and he was rude as all can be about it and very challenging. As a customer, if I pay you good money for quality and you fall short, then stand behind your product and make things right the next time. Leave out the confrontation or ridiculous compromises. Do as you say, deliver as you promise.   I don't think I will keep my business with Metro going forward. Too many pizza options in Vegas to deal with bad attitudes."}
{"text":"We tried Metro Pizza 3 times.  All 3 times the food was okay but below average.  The final time we had a basic cheese pizza with pepperoni and onions.  The pizza was so greasy we had to use napkins to absorb the grease.  We will not be back.  A frozen pizza you can fix at home tastes better.  We wanted to like it since it is just down the street from us but 3 strikes and no more."}
{"text":"I enjoy their white pies..But I can't give any pizza place a full thumbs up if they don't sell by the slice.   As a New Yorker, I like my nice big slice.  I don't want to have to buy a small personal pan pizza to eat alone."}
{"text":"Thought the pizza was pretty good. Although the sauce could have been kicked up a bit. Crust was yummy. Over all I'd eat here again. Lots of comfy seating and a full bar. Staff was nice. And restaurant was very CLEAN."}
{"text":"Looking for a Pizza spot while in town for a cheer competition. I found Metro on Yelp. The decor looked good and the area was good. I learned from being down at ASU that good pizza can sometimes be found near colleges.   The service was good. But if I had to minus a star it was for the lack of good beer. The reason to go out and have pizza is to order a pitcher of beer. The pizza was good, not great. I did order the huge ravioli and it was excellent.   I would return the next time in Vegas"}
{"text":"I'd give it 3- 3 1/2 stars.   Pizza is good but nothing special. Being a native east-coaster, I've definitely had my fair share of good pizzas. This place fulfills the pizza craving but isn't a place I'd go out of my way to eat at.   Went here on a Saturday night and the place was not nearly as busy as one would expect for a Sat. night in Vegas in the summer.   There's not really much else to say- I had a side salad which was your standard Italian chain restaurant side salad and the pizza we got had peppers, onions and sausage (or maybe it was pepperoni?) In either case, it obviously wasn't that memorable.   Service was standard. It's OK but I'm sure there have to be better pizza places in Vegas....somewhere!"}
{"text":"I usually love Metro. At least when dining in the restaurant. But we ordered pizza and pasta a little while ago, and literally live a half a mile from their location, and the pizza was cold and nasty and the pasta looked off color and was cold, like it had been sitting under a heat lamp all day.   Now, I have no idea if they use heat lamps. I also have no idea if they transport delivery in hot containers.   But I do know that places with much lower quality expectations can manage to deliver warm pizza and pasta (yes, chains like Dominoes and Pizza Hut)...so it was a bummer to have Metro fall so short.   We even called the store to let them know what happened. First, the manager said there was no way it was cold and that they didn't use heat lamps (I'll have to take his word on that). Then he did not offer to replace the pizza and pasta or offer any kind of discount or concession. We asked him. He reluctantly agreed to send out a replacement pizza and pasta. We thought that was fair and waited another 40 minutes for it to arrive (again, less than half a mile away, but I can accept it takes time to prepare)...  To our surprise, when we opened the new pizza box and new order of pasta we found...another cold pizza and \"vintage looking\" pasta.  We decided to give up on hoping for a good meal at Metro and ate left overs from the fridge. No more Metro for us.  To be fair, 4 stars for any good experiences with Metro. 1 Star or less for two rounds of cold crappy pizza and stale, week old looking pasta."}
{"text":"I debated with myself whether to rate Metro three or four stars. The service was fast, friendly and efficient. The beer offerings were adequate and was served fast and cold. The dinner salad was the worst I've ever had. A seriously 'why bother' experience. Iceberg lettuce, stale dull croutons, a couple of cucumber and sad tomato slices. If you can't make it right, don't make it at all. Wouldn't take that much effort to make it so much better. The main event, pizza, was much better. Good crust, not thick, but not too thin either. Very good sauce and generous toppings. I still like Rosati's better, but Metro's was good enough to visit again."}
{"text":"The food was good not out of this world.I ordered the small stuffed Chicago, i feel the need to have to repeat that a small size (4 slices). I promise you I'm an eater I luv food, i could only have 1 slice and was done. So unless your extremely hungry or sharing with a large group small is more than enough. The stuffed Chicago was light and fluffy very very cheesy and not greasy which I loved. It had great flavor you are even given marinara sauce on the side.   It was interesting  but the reason for the 4star well I'd have to say the staff. Best customer service ever, all the staff were friendly attentive seriously made you feel welcomed. Don't get me wrong the place was crowded but they still managed to take the time to insure every table was taken care off (promise I was watching) It was a fun experience after a tiring flight. If I lived here this would definitely be a family favourite."}
{"text":"Terrible!!! The service was very slow the Food was overcooked and they over charged us for a couple drinks, not a good experience i would never go back and kitchen caught on fire so it was smoky all in the restaurant and there was no music very dead atmosphere"}
{"text":"Every time I call to place an order I get attitude, bad service and most times told 1.5-2 hour wait time. Food is good most of the time but you guys need to either hire some people or stop delivering If you can't manage to figure it out. Some how the other pizza places can manage to provide actual service with a good attitude. If you were a hole in the wall discount pizza dive I might cut you some slack, but you charge 20-30 a pizza and 5.00 to deliver...hire some people who can show a little care for the customer."}
{"text":"Amazing the pizza is mouth watering , the parking lot isn't the hugest but it's worth the walk for the pizza  , the ambiance is nice an warm I love it very clean the customer service is excellent very friendly the bread they give you to start off with is so delicious , I like the crunch it had with the sliced butter , surprisingly it is my first time being here for happy hour , so I went a little crazy with the appetizers. It's definitely a great place for the family if you ever want to take yours. Over all the pizza we ordered comes with fried calamari an shrimp ooooh it's so delicious, I always have a side salad when I come it's a must the salads are simple an yummy. I get excited every time when I come.  So if your ever around a Metro pizza make sure you stop by"}
{"text":"I ordered the usual, a metro with mushrooms and pepperoni. The simplicity of the 2 topping pizza let's me enjoy their unique fluffy crust, which happens to be the reason i love it here so much!"}
{"text":"The small pizza lunch special is a pretty sweet deal. The pizza is big enough for two people to share. The crust reminds me of a chibatta roll. It's crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. If you're tired of the usual pizza options, definitely check this place out."}
{"text":"Wed afternoon, only 4 people in the place and THE COOK FORGOT TO MAKE OUR PIZZA???? REALLY??????? The waiter brought us some one elses pizza too. . The manager DID NOT EVEN OFFER TO TAKE IT OFF OUR BILL. Said the GM wouldn't allow it. But would buy us dessert? HA HA i just wanted what i ordered. We always eat early to avoid long waits and bad service BOY DID WE GET TRICKED!!!!!! My family and I will NEVER EVER GO THERE AGAIN, TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!! And I let them have too!"}
{"text":"Pizza was okay. Garlic knots didn't have much garlic flavor. The marinara sauce that came with the garlic knot taste like tomato sauce in a can. Had no flavor. Need some improvement in that department guys!"}
{"text":"Food was good. Our server wasn't as stellar. When we asked what he would recommend to eat, being it was my 2nd time eating there and the first time for my 5 relatives, he smartly replied, \"pizza\"! Really!? Thanks Einstein!!! Loser!"}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had to date in Las Vegas.  Wife had a white cheese and I had the meat lovers.  Rather than blather on about pizza comparisons, I'll suffice to say that it was very good and we'd go back!"}
{"text":"We like it here. Have never had a bad meal. Great pizza and good selection of pastas, salads and calzones. On the pricey side at times depending on what you get but its a good spot to bring a large group or just for two."}
{"text":"Came here with a family of four at around 4:00 PM for ou first visit.  It is decorated in a charming and not pretentious way.  Seems circa 2010'ish.  The place was not overly busy, as you'd expect for such an early dinner.  We were seated in a comfortable booth right away.  The server was at our table within 2 minutes.  They give complimentary warm sliced Italian bread loaves with a sweet butter spread.  We ordered garlic knots, a small cheese pizza for the kids, and a large pepperoni and Italian sausage pizza for the wife and I.  This amounts to a lot of food.  After the bread and garlic knots, we barely had room for more then one piece of pizza each.  We ended up with more then half as a left over meal.  No complaints here about left over pizza, but if I had known about the complimentary bread, I would've skipped the garlic knots (delicious though they were).  When the pizza came it was very good.  The crust is legitimately a NY style crust very similar to the crust served at Lombardi's.  The Italian sausage was a crumble style vice sliced.  The pepperoni can either be the traditional US 1.5 inch slices or the smaller and slightly spicier version, which is what we chose.  The sauce is a mild and smooth (not chunky at all) slightly sweet tomato sauce.  The cheese was the US standard grated mozzarella.  Everything tasted very good.  If I were to recommend an improvement it would be with the cheese.  A good quality mozzarella sliced Napoli style is more appealing to me.  Lastly, the only service related issue occurred when our server did not explain, or even offer the specials to us, but did to the table right behind us.  That table received complimentary garlic knots with a pizza that we may well have ordered if we knew about the special.  Lastly, they DO offer a military discount of 10 percent.  In conclusion: my family really liked this place and will probably try them again soon."}
{"text":"So I keep hearing this is a popular spot for UNLV students and the pizza was alright. It's good if you like a thicker dough. It's definitely not a New York style kind of pizza. For that, I'd stick with Grimaldi's. It's very affordable and the salads are good. It's not somewhere I would go back though. There's a lot tables that are good for big parties so feel free to bring the whole gang here. There's also a lot of different pizza topping combinations too so there's a lot to choose from."}
{"text":"Once again!! An amazing experience. We came to metro with friends visiting from out of town and they LOVED it!"}
{"text":"Good stuff! I'm from NY so I am a pizza snob. This pizza passes my test, so that says a lot! A co-worker of mine recommended Metro Pizza claiming that it was like East coast pizza and that it's the best pizza she's had in Vegas. I was skeptical but I thought, okay, I'll try it.  I'm glad I did! This pizza IS like East coast pizza and I love it! They have a lot of specialty pizzas and a bunch of choices for toppings. The inside even looks like a NY pizzeria (this place is just 20 times the size of one, the take out area is a more realistic size for a NY pizza place). Now, they are pricey, about $25 for a large pie. It's quality pizza though so I don't mind paying that price. Need some persuasion after that last sentence? They've won \"Best of Las Vegas\" every year since around 2007 - give it a try, this is authentic pizza!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmmmm, love me some local Vegas pizza! Their calzones are great and I love the meat sauce with bread. This all depends on personal preference but any pizza with light sauce is delish!"}
{"text":"pretty average pizza for a pretty premium price...also, bring your own water, they charged me $5.09 for my 500ml bottle of Evian!  Hard-Pass next time I come through Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Once I found metro I never went back. This is one of my favorite pizza places. I've had pizza, wings, sandwiches, meatballs, all of it was delicious. The staff is awesome. And the inside of the restaurant is kind of amazing. 80s saved by the bell diner style. If you like pizza you're in the right place."}
{"text":"Voted Vegas best pizza multiple years in a row. I can see why !  Amazing pizza...fantastic service... Will DEFINITELY be back !  Wow!!"}
{"text":"We we're visiting Las Vegas and wanted pizza, we we're driving around & came across Metro pizza & decided to give them a try. We were not disappointed, best pizza I think I've ever had. They start out by giving you a crispy bread as an appetizer, that was unexpected & so good. We ordered the Gotham pizza & it was fantastic. Great taste & plenty of toppings. Our server was very friendly & attentive. The place was nice & appeared very clean. When is Vegas again we would definitely go back here."}
{"text":"We eat here as a family often and order from Metro Pizza at least one Friday a month... so we understand that they are super busy on Friday nights...and usually I don't complain but this past Friday was a joke. First of all I had to call 5 times because someone kept picking up and hanging up on me. When I finally got thru she took my order, repeated it to me, gave me my total and said it would be ready in 40 minutes... 40 minutes later my husband goes to pick up our order and they don't have it. There were two girls working the busy takeout area and they were like \"maybe you called another location\" and kind of brushed him off with a \"sorry not my problem\" vibe. Ummm we order from here often and there is only ONE location in Henderson...so no, I didn't call the wrong location. So I sent my husband a screen shot of when I called and they were like \"yea that's our number, weird.\" No sense of concern to fix their mistake or get to the bottom of the issue. And funny thing the same exact thing happened to another woman in line and she just stormed out. For as much as we pay for a large pizza, we should get a little better service. Maybe send a confirmation text or email for phone orders? Clearly it's a common mistake if it happened to multiple people in an hour timeframe. We already wasted an hour waiting for dinner so we ended up just getting food somewhere else. Looks like we might have to find a new pizza place for our pizza nights!"}
{"text":"The pizza and stromboli dough always seems a bit soggy in the center.  Maybe they're using too wet ingredients?  My parents love this place though, so we keep going back.  :-P"}
{"text":"Best pizza in town and the service is always top notch, fresh its old feel reminds me of home"}
{"text":"stayed at the marriot and one night my family and i felt like geting pizza and the front desk recommended Metro pizza.  it was a lil pricier than my usual choice of delivery pizza but IT WAS WORTH THAT LITTLE BIT MORE!  we ordered the gothem pizza and their chicken wings. They were delicious! especially the pizza was amazing, i would order it again next time i stay their.  the delivery guy was older han i expected, i think he might have been the owner, he gave us 2 house brew rootbeers on the house. it was very wonderful of him!"}
{"text":"Just tried this place for the first time after hearing about for over a year now.  It definitely lives up to the hype!  Food is amazing!"}
{"text":"All the portions are generous, and made with the best tasting ingredients. They have grrreat special pricing, so look at their calendar and take advantage of their half off special! My favs The metro pizza, huge, love their sausage Garlic fries The free bread Best calamari ever"}
{"text":"I've been to metro many times but the latest time was a few days ago with my uncle. We went after I got out of work around 8pm. It wasn't that busy but it still took longer than expected to get our food. I don't know if it felt like a long time because I was starving but I think it was because it took longer than needed. This was weird because all the other times I went the service was fine. Maybe because it was almost closing time but still annoying. Despite the food taking forever it was worth it. We ordered the meatball sliders and the personal pan size of the Metro pizza with just cheese. The meatball sliders come on garlic knots which makes them amazing! The personal pan size was huge and enough to split for two people. Its thick pizza which is my favorite. Since cheese is my favorite the only thing I would add to the pizza is more cheese. I will definitely be ordering these again when I return."}

{"text":"Let me surmise for ya...  GREAT PLACE, AMAZING FOOD..."}
{"text":"We come here a lot in a group for our celebrations. I didn't like it the first time (nuclear fries should be insanely spicy, dammit!) but in subsequent visits I've really enjoyed the veggie pizza, the cheese, and the other dishes I've had (salads, mostly). They serve pasta and dessert as well (I had a decent a la mode here). I am not a fan of deep dish, which is I think what made the first time not good for me. Many of my coworkers are from Chicago, and they get this meat concoction - I think it's called the Slaughterhouse or something. Every morsel is gone before we leave."}
{"text":"This has been my favorite pizza place in Las Vegas for years.  They have expanded to a number of locations and I know the owners and they can't be at every location. Their lack of supervision at all locations have made this place suffer a bit.  I have had pizzas with so much black oven residue on the bottom that it is not edible and some service has suffered without their attention.  The guys that run this place know their pizza.  They have probably tasted more New York style pizza than anyone.  They use the best ingredients and taught me what a real New York pizza should be. You used to be able to take a pizza making class there which is very cool.  I hope they still do it.  They have a great salad with a house dressing that is out of this world.  5 stars if they weren't so expanded and could afford to be everywhere.  Grimaldi's edges them out a bit for a reliable quality.  Two good guys that know a lot about pizza."}
{"text":"I organized a work happy hour party here and they were really great to us!  I called in our order ahead of time and they reserved the entire loft area for us.  It worked out perfectly for our group.  All the food came out on time and though the servers were a bit slow with coming through to take drink orders, they were always nice and accomodatinig on anything we asked for.   The best part of any Metro Pizza is the freakin food!!  The pizzas here are always perfect.  The only one I was disappointed with was the supreme.  It came with WAY too many toppings, like giant chunks of hamburger.  BALANCE, people!!  A pizza needs some balance with it's toppings.  I basically picked off half the toppings and then it was perfect.  Next time, we'll stick to just one or two topping pizzas.  Don't forget to order garlic knots.  You won't regret it!  Love this place"}
{"text":"Very expensive pizzas, and they really aren't good. Whenever we order pizza for work, it always somehow works out to be from Metro.  I have never had a good pizza from this place, and I have eaten here at least two dozen times.  Maybe the take out is significantly worse than the dine-in experience?  Who knows.  All I know is that this place is extremely overrated and quite terribly expensive for a below mediocre pizza."}
{"text":"We love this place. The Loop stuffed pizza is a real treat. The service could have been a little better but in his defense it was rather crowded. The only complaint I had was the wine. Nothing irks me more than when a restaurant charges you 8 to 10 dollars for a glass of wine and then fills the glass less then half full. Well they do that here. Matter of fact it was kind of like 1/3 full. So next time I'll do without wine. Try this place."}
{"text":"Nice place to go with family and large groups.   1.  Pizzas - are just fine, nothing too special, but good and tasty.  2.  Menu - They have large group menu items as well like salads, meats and pasta, which is really convenient for large groups.  3.  Large party catering - They also have really nice take out, full pans of Italian food for your home parties. Must give them a bit of time though.  4.  Go Early !! - Overall a nice place to go, but you must go early, or the wait is long. Since this place caters to families and large groups, waits can be huge.  5.  For the kids - They really take care of the kiddies. You automatically get butcher paper and crayons for the kids to be artistic. You also can ask for some pizza dough and the kids can play. Lots of fun.  6.  Beverages - You can ask for pitchers of your favorite refreshment. Great for groups and if you are THIRSTY.  7.  Service - Top notch, friendly and fun."}
{"text":"Best. Happy. Hour. That pretty much sums it up. From 5-7 this restaurant has great selection of beers and appetizers for happy hour. I visited with a friend and sat at the bar area. Our waitress was very attentive and friendly. We really enjoyed the service received here!   As an appetizer I ordered the fried mozzarella (a must!), hot wings (it comes with 5) and their pizza. Everything was delicious and it came promptly!   The place does get busy so there might be a short wait time when you get there. I defended think it is worth the wait. Food is fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Their primary goal is to get a pizza to your home, right? Then why would they take an order from us, spell our street name incorrectly and send the pizza delivery driver out with the wrong address of a place that doesn't even exist? What did he think he would do, sniff us out?  I had to call her back to figure this out FOR HER. Wouldn't you have made sure you even delivered to us before you took the order? Made sure you knew where we lived first?   It gets better. They charge us $45 for a soggy pizza that finally showed but he managed to forget our salad. So my husband paid him and he went back for my salad. I found out it was missing and that he took the $45 plus $5 tip. I was quite upset. No comp offered and it had been well over an hour already. I called the manager and demanded our money back and to forget the food. So the driver came back with the money AND he took the pizza back with him that he left us. No class. Plus I'm sure he had to throw the pizza away since it was left at our house. Who would eat that coming back from a disgruntled customer?  It's a shame this happened. Dominos has messed up and handled the transaction well to make us happy in the end. This place had no clue. The pizza is too pricey to put up with subpar service and maybe even a snide dig on us (the taking back of the pizza).  So I ate a fiber bar and went to bed sad."}
{"text":"We went here on Friday night and I was very much not wanting too many calories but I knew my bf has been absolutely DYING to try this place since we moved here. We've tried grimaldi's but we heard this place was way better and the people arent jerks so that's a plus. We went for the Gotham b/c my bf is a true believer that the more toppings = the best pizza you ever made. We got the gotham minus onions of course for me - and ordered the small since we had also ordered an appetiz. the garlic fries which my fellow yelpers raved about and i'm a huge fan of the gilroy pearl myself.  1st the app - the fries were really good but not to die for like if I went again i'd have to have them... they were kinda hard. and i was expecting soft fries w/ that flavor that just enhances the taste. Again good b/c that means I didnt have too many!  2nd the PIZZA - it was really good. I'd def. order that again. Someone next to us ordered like 2 pizzas and had maybe 1 slice per person so they had tons of leftovers and then ordered all kinds of desserts. wedidnt even go there w/ the deserts. we took our left overs from our small pizza and had the rest for brkfast. The 2 slices i had were super filling b/c of all the toppings. I'd def. go back to this place. I think this is my bf new fav pizza place."}
{"text":"This is the worse pizza I've ever eaten. I'm from Chicago and we use real cheese! I don't know what they use."}
{"text":"We ate here after my favorite pizza place, NY PIZZA AND PASTA at Jones and Sahara had a fire. I have read and heard mixed reviews of Metro Pizza but I knew it had been rated very high. We ordered their pizza and found the restaurant to be very clean and a nice place to hang-out and have pizza etc. They have a very nice selection of wine and beer and our server, Tony, was a very nice person and the service was good. I read somewhere people complained about bad service at one of their locations........not at Flamingo and Decatur......... the service and attitudes were fine. So as always we order the pizza\" Thin crust all the way to the edge with pepperoni and fresh garlic\". The pizza was good ..... in fact to be honest it was better than good but the sauce, cheese and especially the dough was not as good as my usual hangout. Don't get me wrong!..... If you go here you will be happy with their pizza if you order it the way I do......... Authentic NY style. This place is a nice hangout, clean and I would bring my kids here plus good food but just not as good as pizza( maybe 20% less satisfying)  when Brian at New York Pizza and pasta makes my pizza thin crust all the way to the edge with pepperoni and fresh Garlic. I am waiting  for their new location to open in the Northwest part of Vegas. I will give it a try again........ it's better than \"good\""}
{"text":"The free bread and butter was good. Nice, big place and clean. Service was fine. They have a nice selection of beers and wine. WE ordered the Large pizza..... why no \"medium? size? Crust was toasted correctly but lacked significant flavor. Sauce was just \"OK\" but lacked presence and there was too much sauce to the point the cheese was falling away from crust when folded like good N.Y pizza should be.. Lots of good cheese that tasted \"OK\". Lots of pepperoni that was \"OK\". We ordered the FRESH GARLIC AND PEPPERONI N.Y style, thin crust. The \"FRESH GARLIC\" was a joke... just like the  Metro Pizza location on Decatur and Flamingo served us some 6 months or so ago...... Then we got the bill..... $28 for a large pizza with pepperoni and fresh garlic........ NOW THAT'S A JOKE! Also...... N.Y pizza should be delivered on aluminum pie trays, not some plastic POS tray. I will say that my friends meatball pizza looked very good..... looked like real meatball slices. Once again I regretted not going to New York Pizza and Pasta..... It's only location is at North East corner of Sahara and Jones. BRIAN MAKES THE BEST NEW YORK THIN CRUST FRESH GARLIC,PEPPERONI PIZZA IN LAS VEGAS, Wednesday thru Saturdays.....do not confuse this place with \"MARK RICH'S NEW YORK PIZZA AND PASTA\" which is IMHO not good pizza and has 2 locations in LV."}
{"text":"The pizzas were the bomb, hiroshima style. The nuclear fries were more like a sparkler being waved by a toddler.  The North Dakota carry out girl was amazing.  This place rocks!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite place for pizza until they decided to change their delivery service. They driver gets to my door and can't take my card because the numbers aren't raised. We have been metro customers for several years and never had an issue with their delivery until now.  I had hungry kids that I had to drag out in the rain to get food after this mess.  Never again will we be eating metro."}
{"text":"We DEFINITELY did not go here for pizza. It was the only thing available. We were actually going to dine in the restaurant at Ellis Island because lil guy wanted ribs. Well, the kitchen was closed that particular night and they were on a limited menu. Ribs was not part of it. Then, we decided to walk over to the brewery because they also serve ribs, but we got there at 10:03pm and they close at 10pm.  Hubby had been driving and driving around like he usually does and couldn't make up his mind where we should eat. Of course, hours go by and we've just completely missed the boat. A couple who were waiting by the brewery said they'd been there for 45 minutes and still were not seated. GODAMMIT. Lil guy was now starving.  So there was only one thing left. Metro Pizza. The stuff looked like it'd been sitting there forever. OK the good thing is that these pizza slices were paper thin (the way I like my pizza).  We waited a long time since the guy behind near the oven was on his cell phone. 8-10 mins go by and another guy comes over and helps us. Lil guy wanted a slice of pepperoni and hubby and I got the combo topping selection. Boy, the guy didn't even put it into the oven for us and I didn't know to ask.  We sit down and lil guy immediately said \"mommy, this is really greasy\". He had picked up the slice and his plate had a pool of oil just laying there. I would've taken a photo but my hands were greasy from my own slice so I decided not to soil my camera.  I ended up using about 10 napkins to soak up some of the oil from lil guy's pizza. Our slices weren't all that great either. I guess if you've been out partying and drinking, all that grease is probably okay. However, we were starving and it was just a disgusting end to an otherwise great day.  No, I'll never have pizza here again. GROSS! But they're open until 3am."}
{"text":"Food was good. Had an incredibly unpleasant overall experience because of the host, Tony (I believe?) Was so rude from the moment me and my family walked through the door. Rolled his eyes (no joke), when we didn't walk to the table fast enough. We were all in disbelief. Never had someone be no blatantly unpleasant with no reason. Spoke with our family friends who recommended the place, and they said.. oh yeah, Tony is always unpleasant.. we always hope he's not there when we go. Why is he still on staff??"}
{"text":"Metro is one of those places I've been coming to for a few years and only recently realized I had never yelped about it.  But, Metro doesn't need it, it's reputation speaks for itself.  On our most recent trip to Metro, we had lunch.  Both of us started with the side salad, which for $3.50 is decent sized and includes tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, and peppers.  We then each had an individual pizza.  They are typically $10-$13, but they are 6 good sized slices.  You should definitely have enough for another meal unless you are really hungry.  The wife had the Memphis, which is Metro's BBQ chicken pizza.  This is loaded with toppings and a sweet BBQ sauce.  The sauce is a little too sweet for me, but it's good.    I usually get one of the east side pizzas.  These are my favorites because they are made with thicker mozzarella.  Today I had the Spring Street, which is served with ricotta cheese, meatballs, and peppers.  I also like the Bleeker Street (sausage and garlic) and the Mott Street (sausage, peppers, and onions).  Metro is not skimpy with the toppings, so sometimes you have to start the pizza with a knife and fork and finish by folding.    We've never had great problems with service.  They bring you out fresh bread which is nice and toasty from the oven almost as soon as you sit down.  Also, today we got refills of our drinks before ours were close to being empty.  Overall, never had a bad meal at Metro, and always have leftovers."}
{"text":"I just discovered this place about a year or so ago, when my brother told me about it. Ever since then, our family has made this a regular dining experience.  Metro Pizza has been around for years, and only recently opened up a few new locations around the valley (for years, the Tropicana location was the only one.) It definitely came as a breath of fresh air when they opened a location relatively close to my home.  If the name of the establishment didn't give it away, this place is all about pizza. They have a ton of options and diverse pizzas to choose from, plus a variety of other pasta items. The calzones are excellent, some of the best I have ever had. Not to mention I've had some other great pizzas, and that is saying a lot considering I am something of a \"picky eater.\" There are pasta items too, though it's clear the main focus here is on pizza - the chicken parmesan I tried one time was very chewy and had an odd flavor to it. Additionally, there are some solid dessert item choices - the chocolate malt that I had easily rivaled that of 50s diners. My father and brother always get beer here, and there is definitely a better selection of it than you would expect from a \"pizza place.\"   The atmosphere tends to be a little loud, but I welcome that in a place such as this. It's almost always crowded in here, but not so cramped that you're going to have a hard time moving around.   I can't say much else that hasn't already been said. If pizza is your thing, you need to make Metro Pizza your next dining experience."}
{"text":"Holy Amazing Pizza Batman!!!!!!!  They have locations all over Vegas but this one is close to the Strip.   They start your meal off with fresh bread and butter which was warm and yummy. The Pizza was fantastic, some of the best I have ever had. (Thank you Vegas Yelpers for the tip!) The service was wonderful. Our server was a very active listener and from random conversation picked up that we were from out of town. I would recommend this place to anyone going to or living in Vegas. The pizza was just right not too saucy and not soggy. Great place for groups as well I was highly impressed. We went twice while we were there it was so good."}
{"text":"It's a tradition!  I first met my wife in Vegas just about exactly seven years ago and this one of the places where we went to eat.  We were engaged about a year later.  Whenever we come to Vegas, we always come here to eat.  We either have the Gotham (see my recent picture series), or the Stockyard.  If you are on vacation in Vegas, please be sure that your hotel room has a refrigerator. because you are going to need it unless you have a monster appetite.  Rockin' pizza!  Fabulous service makes it even better.  If this joint is good enough to be a landmark in our marriage, I think you'll love it on your next trip to Sin City.  Make eating here one of the sins you're allowing yourself while visiting.  If you can, bring home leftovers--this is something that doesn't have to stay in Vegas."}
{"text":"1 star for the pizza itself, but I'm giving it 2 since it was quick and inexpensive compared to all the other airport eateries. I should've gone to CPK, but I just wanted a single slice and not an entire pie. If ever I return, I'm going to ask for a freshly baked slice and not one that's been sitting out all day like the kind I had."}
{"text":"Pizzas are the staple sharing food of all time.  It's easy to order, most everyone likes it, and there's usually more than enough to go around.  I don't eat much of it outside the home, especially if it's just the two of us.  But since we had our friend with us, sharing a pie was the way to go.  It's my first time at Metro Pizza and the Husband has good things to say about the place.  While the guys decide on their pizza of choice, I'm curious about Our Famous House-Baked Garlic Knots \"Six of our freshly baked and famously soft Garlic Knots.\" ($4.95) and the Husband and waiter definitely agrees to my great choice.  The guys decide on a large of The Gotham \"Pepperoni, Mushrooms, Sausage, Green Peppers, Ground Beef, and Onions\" ($22.95).  We also decide to share a bottle of the Volpi, Barbera d'Asti from Piedmonte, Italy ($22).  It wasn't quite what we expected, but that was our fault.  Warm bread and butter are then brought to our table, which I find interesting to receive at a pizza shop.  We already have a lot of bread coming our way, but it's still appreciated.    The garlic knots arrive with marinara sauce and it's so good - so good because it's doused in garlic butter!  Yum yum!  Your fingers are dripping from the oily goodness and I had more than my fair share.  When the pizza arrives, it looks pretty generous.  We all dive in and my first response is that \"It could be warmer...\"  The Husband agrees because from his seat, he saw that the pizza had been sitting on the counter for our waiter to bring to us for awhile.  So it could have arrived piping hot like it should have.  Chunky pieces of sausage are the first thing I notice and the last thing I remember.  It's pretty good stuff, and yes, we had leftovers.  Overall, good pizza, huge restaurant space.  Service could be improved, especially by bringing our pizza over when it's ready.  (It was near empty when we came on a Saturday night.)  Other yelpers mentioned the cost, they do have coupons in the Entertainment Book to help with that concern.  3.5 stars  (Pics posted!)"}
{"text":"Good food! Had cheese pizza and garlic fries and was impressed. Price is a little high for a large cheese, but I would def go back!"}

{"text":"This pizza was beyond horrible. I was headed out of Vegas and decided I wanted some pizza since I was still recovering from a good night. So first of all they didn't have much of a selection and were basically out of everything. I was going to be greedy and get two slices because I was trying to sell recover however since they didn't have the proper inventory I settled for one slice of pepperoni which I'm so glad. The pizza was extremely greasy. I know it's going to be greasy other way because it's pepperoni but it was pretty ridiculous. It didn't taste good at all. The bottom was slightly burnt but I ate it since I bought it. Definitely know not to stop here ever again!"}
{"text":"I would consider myself a pizza connoisseur!   Nice place, service is ok.  Bread is great!   Ordered pepperoni pizza and meat lovers version.  Pizza is just ok.  Sausage and pepperoni is very bland and tasteless.   With so many choices today you should leave with a great or fantastic food experience !    Not a terrible experience, just average."}
{"text":"I had heard a lot about Metro Pizza.  Everyone raves about it.  I was pleasantly surprised.  A multitude of choices.  I had a specialty pizza topped with Fra Diavlo sauce, calamari and shrimp.  It was terrific.  Fresh ingredients and proper preparation.  Spot on.  I will be back again very soon."}
{"text":"Too Busy, long waits, over worked staff, and expensive for Pizza.  Other than that the food is Okay."}
{"text":"I wanted to experience Metro Pizza because I heard it was excellent pizza. I ordered the lunch special which included a personal pizza and salad. The pizza was a generous sized portion. It was actually big enough for 2 people to share, so the value is great because you will have leftovers. The pepperoni pizza was delicious.  The only concern I had was the excess amount of grease on top which is why I scored it 3 stars. However,  I would come back because the staff was polite and I would like to try a different kind of pizza."}

{"text":"My wife and I went for dinner this evening as we have done many times before. While the dinner was fine and our waiter (who was also tending bar) was excellent our experience was ruined by the to go area of the restaurant.  My wife is the Store Manager of a national chain retail store and frequently treats her staff to lunch. On many occasions she has ordered a total of 6 pizzas to be delivered to the store the next day and it has never been an issue. Unfortunately tonight was different.  She asked the girl behind the counter for an order to be delivered tomorrow to the store but was told \"wouldn't you rather order tomorrow so it would be fresh?\". I am not sure if she thought we wanted it cooked tonight and delivered tomorrow but that was not the real problem. She went to the back to ask the Manager on Duty - Paul if they could deliver tomorrow and was told no. Since my wife has done it many times before she asked to speak with the manager. Paul came out and began to make excuses like I don't know how many delivery guys I have tomorrow, the other store may take some of my delivery guys, I already know I have one order,etc. If you already have an order than apparently you do what we were asking.  Since this is the age of reality shows, and Metro was actually on one, don't you think that customer service should be crucial to a manager's duties? Paul made an issue out of a normal request. We than left Metro without placing the order and proceeded to another pizzeria and placed the order with them, no issues and no excuses.  I doubt my wife will ever place an order with Metro again."}
{"text":"Fast, spot on service.  Ordered the small Gotham pizza (pepperoni, ground beef, sausage, onions, mushrooms, and green peppers) crust and toppings were cooked perfectly.  Complimented the meal with some hot chicken wings which kept their flavor but needed a little more heat in my opinion.  Order was the perfect proportion for 2 hungry appetites.  All this was washed down with a couple Red Banshee craft beers (American Amber/ Red).  Enjoy your meal!"}
{"text":"Nuke fries are yuummyy, pizzas are good, beer selection is few but have some locals and good ones. everything is good here"}

{"text":"Maybe it was hunger from walking the strip all day, or maybe all the beer we bought from 7-11 complimented it more, but this was GOOD pizza! If you're in a group it's more economical to get a large pizza than to buy single slices. Best thing to do is get one (or two) to take it up to your hotel room. The pizza is worth it and probably cheaper than other places on the strip."}
{"text":"Good pizza, beers on tap, friendly atmosphere.  I've heard a lot of good things about metro pizza, and finally got to try it out.  We started with complimentary bread on the table and a few beers.   I ordered a large pepperoni and jalapeño pie, which was filling for two people; and it was very good.  My daughter had the margarita pizza, which to be honest, tasted like cardboard lol.. But she liked it.   The star was friendly, and didn't mind that baby dropped bread all over the place.  Loved my beer too; Bluffing Isn't Weiss.  If you like blue moon you'd love it!    All in all; awesome place.  Went two or three days ago and we're planning to go back over the weekend."}
{"text":"Yummy yummy yummy.  This is a much better spot than the one on Flamingo.  Better atmosphere and I believe the pizza tastes better too.  The one on Trop is good too. Always appreciate the crust and bread at Metro Pizza.  They obviously put a lot of care into creating a good dough.  I would like more spicy pepperoni but that's a personal preference.  Wait staff and hostess are great.  The owner was there that night and he is a really great guy - knows his stuff about pizza and very friendly.   Probably the best \"non premium\" pizza in Vegas and gives places like Grimaldi a run for their money."}
{"text":"Hands down best pizza pie in Vegas. Get the metro well worth it."}
{"text":"This was my first experience at Metro Pizza. I've heard so many wonderful things about this place I was super excited when my friends decided to have dinner here the other night.   There was six of us in our group and when Joel and I arrived they already had a table waiting for us. The menu is large and it all sounds excellent. All three girls shared a pitcher of red Sangria cause they were out of white. It was fruity and had a great taste. Joel ordered a pizza from their stuffed section called The Skyline. I decided on a salad called the Domenica. It was basically an Italian chopped salad with their house Italian dressing. Which was pretty good, but I do wish it was garlickier. It had tiny bits of chopped ham and salami. Yum! Joel's pizza was huge and tasty. Everyone else in our group enjoyed their food as well.   Our waitresses was on point and kept our bread basket filled and our water and soda  glasses topped off. She even split our bill in threes with out even being asked.   The pizza wasn't the best I've had, but I'm glad we got to experience a pizza staple in Vegas. I'd go back to try another style of pizza and maybe some gelato. We all left happy and full!"}
{"text":"Not busy at all, sat right down for dinner. Dining area was clean, nice atmosphere.  Fresh warm bread served as great.  Got caesar salad, calamari, and garlic fries for appetizer. Apps came out fresh, hot & fast. The 3rd star was because of the apps, they give us hope to try Metro again.  Ordered small pizzas; pep & cheese, Panthenon, and a kids meal pep cheese & bacon.  Pizzas were just ok, panthenon had heavy garlic in the sauce and the chicken had no flavor. Pep n cheese wasnt cut right so we were pulling it apart. Kids meal was fine.  Waitress was nice, but got distracted w/another customer talking & took forever cash out! Yelp check in for a free iced tea.  Might try a Metro style crust if we go again..."}
{"text":"Love this place!!!! This is me and my fams \"go to\" pizza spot  when we're out and about craving pizza. We always order the Gotham and for my kids, the original pepperoni. They have the best pizza!!! Super cheezy, the sauce is just enough so that pizza isn't too tart and the crust is to perfection! We always eat our pizza with their ranch. Idk what kind of ranch they serve but it has a hint of garlic and it goes perfect with any slice of pizza you order.  Perfect place to bring your family and kids. While waiting upon your order, you can ask for some pizza dough for your kids to keep them busy. (Pretty cool!)   Don't forget to check in every time you're there and show your waitress/waiter, you get a free beverage! Cool staff, great atmosphere and fast service. We will always be back to this place!"}
{"text":"Pizza is pretty bad. They don't carry stromboli on menu regularly said it be about 40 minutes to make and they ran out a few hours ago.  Beer is 8 bucks from bottle on its on.  Should really step it up."}
{"text":"As far as pizza goes I love this place. It seems that when it comes to pizza everyone is a critic and I enjoy Metro Pizza more than the commercial outlets like Pizza Hut and Domino's. Their Spinach and Artichoke dip is and probably will be the best I have ever had in my life. I went with a few people from out of town (East Coast) and they agreed they never had better. I recommend Metro Pizza for a nice lunch pizza."}
{"text":"I love Metro Pizza and I can't believe I hadn't reviewed them yet! This location is our favorite but all of them are GREAT! Today our 2 pies came out nice and quick. Brandy was our server and she was fabulous. I checked in and got my free non alcoholic beverage and since it was my bday they have me a slice of choco cake too! Cannot say a single bad thing about Metro, they are awesome in every way! The pizza is the best in town in opinion hands down!!! Also we didn't catch the busser's name but he was on point with refills! Been coming for years and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"Mediocre at best... Tonight was my first experience at Metro.  I ordered to go; eggplant parm/with salad and garlic knots. Not the worst eggplant parm I've ever had, maybe a 5 out of 10.  Sauce just OK, missing something, more cheese please on the baked parm, garlic knots pretty good, nothing I'd probably be craving in the future... And lastly the sad salad,  a pre-packaged iceberg head medley of wilted brownness.... Yuck!  And btw people, it's 2014, be done with styrofoam!! Toxic, non-bio degradable crap!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. I had the big raviolis and it was BIG! The service was a little slow  and all of our food came out one at a time. I will definitely be back to try their pizza and desserts."}
{"text":"We heard that Metro did a pizza \"happy hour\" from 2:30-4:30 (Tue-Thur) where pizzas are half off so we decided to try it.   You are able to do half and half so we got half Patheon and half Piggy. Patheon was decent ingredients it was slightly bland and maybe needed seasoning on the toppings. Piggy was the opposite and was very flavorful with bbq sauce and pickles on it. Their crust was crispy, but is airier than.usual.   Service was decent. We were checked on and drinks refilled.   Overall, it was decent at the half off price, but not a spot I would seek or frequent."}
{"text":"I've already been to Metro a handful of times so this is just a review of my most recent visit to this location last night with a friend. I got my usual fave. The Modesto with sausage. Italian sausage, garlic, tomatoes, basil and mushrooms. Pizza was good as I remember it. Place is a lil pricey. $27 for a large. If you catch them when it's 50% off on their various special days/times it's a great deal then. Service was good. I've been here before but it seems like the place is starting to run down a bit. The booth seats were a little idk...off? And it was littered with crumbs. A little surprise was also the tab holder, or whatever it's called? When I got the check, I noticed the flap on it was exposed on the inside crease and the cardboard was starting to tear off. Very odd... Still, a solid 3.5 stars overall for the good food and service."}
{"text":"Staying at the Bellagio Vegas, called front desk to get a referral for pizza, locally delivered. They recommend METRO PIZZA, called and everything sounded good. They got the order correct but told me 1 hour, get the pizza and salad. The pizza was \"HELLA COLD\" and the salad was warm! WTF? Now I'm sitting here hungry and 40 bucks light.  Not ordering again.    Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"This is the first Metro Pizza I ever had the pleasure of visiting. BEST DAMNED PIZZA AROUND! We had the \"SKYLINE\" and the \"GARLIC FRIES\" on my first visit. Both of which were some of the absolute best things I have ever eaten in my life. I would come here every time I wanted pizza if I lived here.  They even have a daily calendar for specials you have to see to appreciate. As well as kids nights where they can learn about pizza making. Thank you Beth H., for introducing me to one of the best places to eat in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I've been eating pizza for almost 60 years and it doesn't get any better than Metro! The staff is excellent and the 1/2 price pizza specials are wonderful.  Treat yourself and take John Arena's pizza making class.  You'll be smarter and have fun too."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Vegas. We eat here once a week and it's always consistent and delicious  The chicken chop salad is a must with extra basil  The calzones with jalapeños and pineapple is amazing.  Everything is made fresh.  This is not your cookie cutter pizza"}
{"text":"What's not to love about Metro Pizza. It's a family tradition to eat pizza here when my Uncle visits from Virginia and although we usually go to the Tropicana location, this place is more convenient for both me and my family as it's located halfway between both our homes. We always come for the pizza and have yet to order anything but pizza, salad, wings and garlic fries. All of which are awesome. The Gotham pizza is my favorite, it's like the king of supreme pizzas! It's so good. Only recently have I discovered they have thin crust pizza which is my favorite. The Stockyard pizza is more like a deep dish pizza stuffed with meat. Soooo much meat so if you want to get pizza and meat wasted at the same time that's probably something you would want to try. The Hawaiian is also a good pizza, and also the white pizza is kind of awesome.Recently we finally decided to order the meatball sliders which come on garlic knots! O M G they are so delicious. The meatballs are tender and the garlic knots go well. The garlic knots should be a tad softer because they meat is so tender. Everything we order here we love and it's perfect for bringing the whole family too. My family loves this place. I'm sure yours will too."}
{"text":"In reading my prior review you will know all about my pickup experience. Not the greatest but the pizza was fantastic. Tonight i brought my family, a party of 6 and Ed was our server and he was fantastic on totally on it. Nobody in my party had ever been here before and its fair to say they are serious pizza lovers ( or snobs, take your pick! ) We ordered a 89th street Sicilian which is perfection. A nice light fluffy bready pizza with melted cheese, pepperoni, and its probably the best pizza i ever had. I literally have to exercise restraint and not overstuff myself. The other pizza was a thin crust pepperoni & cheese. As you can imagine, i was really anxious to know thier thoughts. The vote was unanimous... the best pizza hands down! That means more miles on the odometer but its totally worth it. Thanks again Ed for making our experience a great one!"}
{"text":"Last time I went to Metro Pizza was a few years ago and didn't blow my skirt up. Coming from back east its hard finding decent pizza here. When you are used to a certain quality its hard to change. Its on par with eating fresh pasta every day and then suddenly only being able to eat Spaghetti O's. On this visit I really enjoyed myself though. I ignored prices (hard to do when they are so high) and went with the Olde New York pie. Really, really, really good. I ended up forcing myself to eat more than I should have because it tasted so good. Not really the NY style that I am used to but it was very good. The server was very nice and the place is clean and well kept. The only negative is the price. Ok so I let myself go this time and put out the $23 and change for a large pie. Will I do it again? Probably not. If I had money to blow I would eat there all the time, so for you rich kids out there go for it! Although I may go back to try the Mac & Cheese as Matt C seems to love it."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza! Went here after checking out some of the other Yelp! reviews and we weren't disappointed. I ordered the individual triple play pizza, a thin crust pizza with two extra servings of sausage and it was delicious! My wife had the Domenica salad which was probably large enough to serve at least three people. For desert we had the sea salt caramel and spumoni gelato from the dessert bar and both were excellent. The service was great. Our waiter was on the spot and took our orders quickly and was very attentive, but not overly so. We were there on a Sunday evening and it was full, but not packed. We didn't have to wait for a seat, but there weren't many empty tables either. All in all a great place for a pizza or other Italian fare."}
{"text":"Alittle on the pricey side, but if you go when they have the half off deals or some other special on a pizza, it's worth it.  My fav is definitely the garlic knots, but I didn't find the pizza to be all that. The place was set up nice and it was clean, and the waitress was very attentive. Will probably return and get another pizza whenever those specials roll out again."}
{"text":"Ordered the The Skyline. My roommate and I used to live in Chicago so we know pizza pie. We ordered it carryout; the wait was very short (only 15minutes) so I kind of knew right away it wasn't the real deal thick crust stuffed Chicago-style pizza (which take no less than 45 minutes) but we gave it a shot. The dough was tasty, and they did not short us on any ingredients. The pizza was cooked perfectly with a nice crispy crust yet warm doughy center. Overall we were satisfied with the taste. Only set backs: the crust was not deep dish, the pizza itself was very wide for Chicago-style, and the meat sauce to put on top was very thin (almost like college dorm quality spaghetti marinara sauce). It was almost like a cross between Chicago and New York styles.   If you have the munchies for a quick all-American pizza, go here. The staff were very friendly as well."}
{"text":"Excellent calzone. Unreal. Take it into bar and enjoy with a beer. Even though Ellis island bartenders are the worst ever."}
{"text":"Had  a great  time  with  my  family  and friends  for  Disney  Weekend.  22 of us ate  more  than  we  could  handle.  Pizzas, pastas  and  salads  were  just  memorable.    We  loved  the  Star  Wars theme.  The  manager  was  dressed  like  Darth  Vader and  some  kids  got  pictures  with  her.  She's  awesome.   Keep  up  the  good  work.  We  can't wait  to  see  what's  next."}
{"text":"Love going to Metro it's a staple. The food is quality and great service. It feels like a nice local spot as well and always delicious. The pizza's are large and have a good amount of toppings! YUM!"}
{"text":"I don't get the Metro Pizza love around here.  Maybe it's because I'm from St. Louis, the land of cracker-thin crust and ooey-gooey provel cheese.  However, I find this pizza very generic.  I have eaten at this Metro location three times now, each time hoping to understand the draw.  Nope.  Still don't.  It's not like it's BAD... it's just not exceptional either.  The service has gotten worse with each visit too.  The first time, the waitress was so friendly and warm that it made me want to come back and try to find that lovin' feeling for Metro.  The second time... meh.  The third time, the waitress only made it to our table once, and that was to take our drink and food order.  After that, service was a free-for-all.  I love Grimaldi's.  I also like Aurelio's.  This whole Metro thing?  I guess I'll never get it.  Sigh."}
{"text":"If you haven't tried the Chicken Pasta Salad, it is amust!  When I come back to Vegas I always do my be to get to a Metro. Honey Cayenne Dressing....awesome!"}
{"text":"Yummy! Sausage pizza the way its supposed to be! Make sure to ask them what their specials are, they don't advertise them!!"}
{"text":"I love Metro Pizza! I've been coming here for years...but what happened to all the fun and friendly waitstaff?"}
{"text":"I had three pizzas delivered...and...oh yeah...they hit the spot!   The pizzas arrived within the time frame stated (1 hr) and they were still nice and hot despite the cold weather. The delivery guy asked me to check my pizzas for accuracy before he left (ooops...something I never do) and they were exactly as ordered!"}
{"text":"Hmmm, reading through some of the recent reviews, I wonder why some people would give this place 3 stars or under. I feel, if you're going to rate somewhere and it be a deterrent to others to visit, you should have better reasoning other than the petty reasons people are listing. Just because you're having a bad day isn't a good enough reason to give a shitty review. Base it off of the food, service, cleanliness, etc. If you're in a bad mood, I'm pretty sure you're going to try to find the shittiness in everything - even though you shouldn't.   I liked this place a lot. The service was fast and friendly and the food was very good.  I would say that the prices are a little above my liking and that's the only reason I won't go here as often. But, I will pay extra when I want good pizza. I hate most American chains and I don't ever order from them. I don't care that it's cheaper.  We had -   Milano Pizza - it's their version of a white pizza. It was probably the best I've had in town. Very garlicy but they always are, and I dig me some garlic. Highly recommended if you like garlic too.  Half pepperoni/half sausage and olives. It was very good. Sauce was perfect, crust perfect and toppings were very good. The only thing is there was a hell of a lot more olives than sausage, but I'm not picky. I love both.  Hot wings - very delicious. Their buffalo sauce is very good here and it had the perfect amount of spice. They fried them perfectly. It wasn't too thick of breading, it was light and crispy.  I would highly recommend if you're in the area or if you tire of the normal pizza joints.  Overall, it's an awesome pizza place and sometimes, it's just worth paying extra money for better pizza."}
{"text":"The food is always awesome . The stockyard is always my favorite pizza  . The servers are excellent as well . Never a bad meal or service ."}
{"text":"Been here twice, both after an hour or two of light drinking while playing blackjack during a long layover, and before a red-eye flight. Pizza has that sabarro taste, which isn't a bad thing in my opinion, all things considered.  4 stars for filling my pizza craving and most important, being open when nothing else was, after midnight... big points in my book. 3 stars for taste and price. Would definitely recommend if hungry for pizza and in that part of the terminal."}
{"text":"I know pizza like Nobu knows yellowtail...a regular at the pizza expo, I'm from New York, my uncles and grandparents were in the pizza business all their lives and I grew up eating it 4 nights a week, literally. With that said, this pizza was VERY middle of the road, 'meh'. It wasn't atrocious, but after 7 years in Vegas and hearing about metro pizza, my mind is blown as to how such average quality pizza is a hit to the point of multi-store Las Vegas expansions.  The dough was extremely bland and needed a double proof, a bit of molasses and either some cornmeal or garlic sprinkle to make it stand out.  The sauce was tasteless and again, nothing special whatsoever.  The cheese they use was ultra cheap, substantially worse than the grande brand cheese (industry standard these days) and created an oil slick on the paper plate when folded in half and eaten NY style. I've had tons of good pizza made with marginal quality cheese like this when the sauce or dough were able to compensate but I couldn't find one redeeming aspect at Metro besides the friendly service.  With such a mediocre interpretation of New York style pizza, Nobu should offer up a sword to fall on."}
{"text":"I came a few days ago and Edgar who served our table he was AMAZING! He took care of us very well and has such good manners. He made my experience become an unforgettable one. and I must say he was quiet handsome haha! (;"}
{"text":"Came here rather early on a Saturday night - we walked in just before 5:30pm and was told there would be a 20 minute wait. Walked around the plaza a little and came back after 15 min or so and our table was ready!  We ordered:  -nuclear fries - not spicy at all! Fries were really good though - crispy on the outside, hot and perfect once you bit into them. The \"nuclear\" came from whatever spice mix they sprinkled on top. - half bleecker street, half spring street (small) - yum! the spring street was my fave out of the 4 kinds we tried~ - half memphis, half pantheon (small) - the BBQ sauce on the memphis was on the sweet side and I would've preferred it to be more zingy! The pantheon was nice a creamy, but I think I prefer traditional tomato based pizzas  The pizzas were a little flimsy and each piece was floppy and it got kinda messy as we ate. I think the large pizzas are more sturdy (judging from the tables around us that got larges)  Service was good! Our server was prompt and friendly - nothing to complain about.  Not sure I would come back here - rather pricy for pizza!"}
{"text":"We have continued to order pizza from here & have been more than pleased every time. I also have a new favorite salad, the Domenica & their house dressing.. O.M.G! I even bought a bottle of it the last time we were there for dinner, SO good. Unfortunately it doesn't have a slow pour top so my 10 year old ended up pouring more than half of it on his salad one night :( I will gladly spring for another bottle though, even at $4.99!  The pizzas we have especially loved were the Modesto & the San Gennaro. We ordered the family platter of Chicken Parmigana one night & while it was a TON of food for the money ($35.95 for about 15-20 breasts in a foil tray covered with sauce & cheese.. ended up being enough for lunch & dinner for 3 days!) it wasn't the best Chicken Parmigana I've ever had & we will probably just stick to their pizza for the most part.     Also, try their Spumoni Gelato sometime, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"A well executed pizza is a marvelous thing! I've had trendy minimalist pizzas and overloaded pizzas, but as I learned in Italy the key is quality dough, sauce, cheese, and toppings to make an incredible food experience .   They say pizza is one of the most unhealthy things you can eat, but with pizza this good how can you say no. I've been to Metro several times and been to several trendy award winning places and it comes down to consistency and quality and Metro has never failed to deliver.   This visit we had a great deal on a couple of bottles of wine and created a combo pizza from a the Gotham and the Spring street pizzas. The Gotham has pepperoni , mushrooms, sausage, green peppers, ground beef, and onions. The Spring street is topped with meatballs, ricotta, and roasted peppers, Both pizzas had a crisp tasty crust and the topping were fresh, delicious, and in perfect harmony.  The atmosphere was friendly, comfortable, and the service was quick and attentive."}
{"text":"The eggplant sub wasn't the best, but the pizza was awesome. I prefer Boston/New York style pizza this place didn't replace any old favorites but its one of the better I have had since being here in Nevada.  The atmosphere was nice, the seating was comfortable, the only thing keeping me from going back often would be the prices."}
{"text":"Everyone's a big fan of pizza now a days! So we decided to order take out for our monthly poker night at the house. If we're in the mood for pizza it's usually one spot at the top of the list.   I called them to place an order and to my surprise the lady stated they delivered as well. I gave her my cross streets and she stated it was an additional $5 so I placed my order and loved the fact that I didn't have to pick it up.   Our total was $140, for 4 large pizzas, 40 pieces of wings and 2 orders of their Romano fries. As usually we took great care of our delivery man.   .......... Sadly, our pizza was cold and over baked. Our fries were stale and drenched in oil. The center of our wings weren't cooked throughout. Hence, we had company I decided to work with what we had. The dining experience is worthy of 4-5 the delivery service is awful. I'm definitely steering away from ever ordering out again."}
{"text":"I usually don't like many pizza by the slice places but for some reason I had a craving for a good pizza, after hearing that metro was good I headed that way. At first the pizza they had in the glass looked so old and horrible however my friend asked when a fresh pizza was coming up and it just so happened to come out 2mins later. We ordered a supreme slice each it was so good I got another,  I'm writing the review now because I was going to head back and get another but I see it's closed now. This review is based on price per slice, there is better out there, but for $4 a slice it's very tasty you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the type of walk-up pizza joint where you stare into the glass case at the pizzas that have been sitting there for who knows how long, select your slice, then they run it through the oven and everything is hunky-dory.  I like this pizza. It's the kind that you have to wring out before you can eat it, but, if you're lucky like me, and you have a friend who will demand that you keep the wrung-out grease so he can dip his pizza in it, then nothing goes to waste. The Hawaiian and the veggie are LOADED with good toppings, and it's the perfect accompaniment to the buck brews they serve at EI. And it's, like, $2.50 or so. And the slice is humongous.  I don't think I have ever gone to EI specifically to get a slice of Metro pizza. But, if you're going there anyway, and you're hungry, then this is a fine choice out of EI's two other dining options."}
{"text":"So let me start by saying I dont eat cheese. With that being said, its really difficult to find a good pizza joint that makes great cheeseless pizzas. Metro pizza is the first pizza place that made an amazing dairy free pizza for me. Their dough is very good (I got the metro crust) which is pretty thick, but I like thick pizza. We tried their atomic fries that were delicious! Their garlic knotz were alright not the best I have had. The only reason they got 4 stars is because their service wasnt great. Besides that my girlfriends and I all loved it (and they eat cheese)!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and it never gets old. I had the regular pizza and also the stuffed pizza. They were both great and I see why it triumphed in so many awards!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting Las Vegas so I came on yelp to find a place to get some pizza. I looked through the pictures and I noticed I seen something that looked interesting to me so I called and ordered it the lady on the phone was super nice delivery took about 35 minutes which is not too bad it's actually very good when the pizza came it was fresh but the only problem was there was barely any chicken on it. So when I give a call back the lady was still super nice and she tried to say that she would give me some credit towards the store which did not interest me because I'm not from here I just said that I wanted a new pizza with more chicken on it. The lady spoke with her manager and then they agreed to give me a new pizza they said it would take about 45 minutes. The both of the pizzas were very good. They seemed very apologetic when my second pizza came it was very warm just like the first one but luckily it had more chicken. I would definitely recommend the place the food is super good the customer service is amazing definitely a thumbs up"}
{"text":"Very disappointed I used to like this place, I ate there today and more than one meal at our table tasted very watered down. I did ask an employee if they change the sauce and they said yes. I know this new sauce must be cheaper, it had no flavor was very watered-down. It completely changed the dynamic of the pizza and the pasta dish. I won't go back again now."}
{"text":"Not bad. Pizza was tasty. I've heard about this place for years. Server was nice enough, she seemed a little depressed or something but other than that good pizza experience."}
{"text":"The pizza is OK. I figured I'm already here, who wants to drive somewhere else to get something to eat. The sauce was ok, and the ingredients were flat. Nothing really spectacular about this."}
{"text":"I've been going to Metro Pizza for many many many years here in Vegas.  Unfortunately I hadn't been inside Ellis Island casinos for about 15 years.  I finally came here the other night and was pleasantly surprised to find a Metro Pizza located in this casino.     It was perfect as I showed up hungry and got some pizza from here.  They had a line but it moved rather quickly and they had the same quality of service and food as the other locations that I've been to.   If you like pizza and your in Vegas, this is a MUST!   Plus it's located in a great casino with a brewery attached.    Can't go wrong here"}
{"text":"We got Metro to go for dinner.  This is one of the best pizza's in Vegas.  Great flavor and they aren't skimpy on the topping.  This pizza is loaded.   We usually done in at the new Centennial location.  It's a great setup and always good customer service.    I also like the beer selection..."}
{"text":"Ups and downs here but overall the food is good. The decor does not fit at all but not a big deal. Waited about 5 mins before anyone acknowledged us. The food and pizza is good but definitely pricey. The customer service is not the best, but the food makes up for it."}
{"text":"It's Metro pizza. That is all that needs to be said. If you have never had Metro Pizza then you are missing out on some of the best Pizza in Vegas. Everything from the Pitchers of beer to the variety of pizza, calzones and pasta dishes are the best around. We get the garlic fries, calamari, Sausage pizza with metro crust. The Baked Ziti is probably the best we have had in town. I recommend you try it."}
{"text":"Went to the Sky Point location and really enjoyed the pizza. I got the meat lovers pizza in a personal pan size. The ingredients are all good from the crust, sauce and toppings. The building itself is spacious and very noisy. Great for groups."}
{"text":"Great pizza and it's not overly packed and that is something that is very difficult to experience in Las Vegas. It was not crazy loud and you could enjoy the company of your friends and family with out the headache. The prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food. Also right now if you check in you get a free beverage which is handy. There is a bar as well for those of you who drink."}
{"text":"Heard this place was good so I was very delighted to see they have a Metro Pizza in Ellis Island Casino.  We planned to eat at the casino restaurant because it's good and cheap, but the wait was 45 minutes, it was dinner time and we were hungry.   Ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and it was delicious!  The crust was the perfect texture--not cardboard but not super big and fluffy--had just the right crisp and crunch. The pizza was not oily and had just the right amount of topping per bite. This pizza reminds me of my fav east coast pizza, Bostone.   They have specials: - Thursday: B1G1 slice free - Sunday: B1G1 free large pizza"}
{"text":"Really good pizza spot.  A bit pricey but worth it for a night out."}
{"text":"Excellent friendly service. I had the cheese pizza and salad. While I didnt care too much for the salad, the cheese pizza was prepared perfectly. Even though this location is busy, they still take time to appreciate their guests."}
{"text":"Now, is when I admit the ugly truth: I am not a pizza snob. I know I have been hiding behind a foodie cloak, albeit a discount foodie cloak, but I am pretty easy to please when it comes to a slice with cheese. (Couldn't resist the rhyme.) If the sauce has some kick and the toppings are not from a can, I am a star-giving fool!  With that off my chest, I would like to say that I really like Metro Pizza. However, I might add, that I think Metro could please even a foodie. I have been at least four times, and if I keep going back, something must be right.  The place looks like a 50s diner, and there are some rather uncomfortable booths in the back. Watch out for that. But, the servers are always nice, even when we show up right before closing.   They have a calendar of goofy specials that changes every month. Goofy specials include days when you can get 50% pizza if your name is Mina. (The name changes so don't go and change your name.) Also, they have an early bird special Mondays - Thursdays, 2:30pm - 4:30pm: Any Pizza, Any Size, Half the Price!  Now, as for the pizza, we always get thin crust. They bake the pies in a pizza pan that has knobs along the bottom (probably a technical term for this), and I think that helps create a beautifully crisp crust without excessive greasiness. The toppings are generous and fresh. We generally don't order one of the specialty pizzas; we just get the toppings we want. Man, I can't really think of anything to complain about here, but then again, I am no pizza snob. Which reminds me, have you tried the new Domino's? ;)"}
{"text":"The best pizza in town is at this location. The closest I have found to NY Style pizza. 2-1 days are Thursday's and Sunday's. Slice and brew from Ellis island with a group of friends watching sports = priceless."}
{"text":"Great spacious dinning area for family, friends and co workers. Pizza was delivered in a timely maner (20min). Prices are reasonable here. Courteous waiters and clean restaurant."}
{"text":"We ordered the garlic fries and a small abondanza pizza, it was enough for two. Pros: The place is clean and the price was affordable. The fries were great, I'd order them again. Waitress was friendly, and we received fast service. Cons: the busser who brought our drinks appeared to be in a rush he was already leaving before I finish saying how I wanted my drink. I had to raise my voice to say \"light ice\" cause he was leaving. The place had about 4 customers, not so busy where he can't spend 20 extra seconds to listen. And second, I didn't like the presentation of the pizza. The meat appeared to just been thrown on it. Very cluttered all in the middle. Didn't look too appetizing; however, it did taste fine. We didn't finish the pizza and we decided not to take the leftovers home, because it was too greasy. But I think that's because of the extra meat, so it might be different with another pizza. Would visit the place again but not my first option."}
{"text":"Solid 3 star experience for me.  Not amazing, but definitely not bad.  I'd be happy to return, or even order for pickup/delivery.  We walked in at about 7:00pm on Friday night for date night, and were seated right away.  The place itself is a little worn down, but still clean, and comfortable.    Service was...strange. We were seated by a friendly girl, and then a young guy in a tuxedo shirt and bowtie came over to get our drinks...when we gave him our coupon for free meatball sliders, he became a bit confused, and had to get the manager, who took care of us for the rest of the night...but the guy in the bowtie kind of...hovered around the table, almost like he wasn't sure what he was supposed to be doing... The manager was very nice though.  We waited about 20 minutes for the food, which isn't a bad wait.  The food LOOKED amazing.   The Meatball Sliders:  meatballs, sauce and cheese served on a garlic knot with french fries.  Whoever came up with the idea to do a slider on a garlic knot...well, they're a genius, and I want to kiss them.  What a great idea! For me, the meatballs could have been seasoned just a touch more, but they were pretty good.  Very heavy.  I only had one (and it happened to be the only slider on the plate that was DRIPPING in grease), and was pretty much done eating.  Pantheon Pizza:  White pizza with Garlic cream sauce, Mozzarella, chicken, spinach and feta.  YUM.  Absolutely delicious.  The only issue with this, is that the pizza was not cooked evenly...my two pieces had crust that was solid and crisp.  Morgan's 2 were soggy.   The flavor was really good, but we'd have liked to see a little more consistency with the cooking.   All in all, the meal was good.  The flavors were there, and service was pretty good.  I would definitely go back again."}
{"text":"The service and food is about as outdated as the decor. I do not understand what is special about frozen breaded calamari, frozen shrimp, frozen chicken fingers, pre cut lettuce medley from a bag etc. This restaurant USED to have something special that set it apart from all the other pizza joints in town, now it's just another cheap knock-off using bottom of the barrel product and not even attempting to doctor it up a little to make it their own. I've had better food at a hospital honestly. Our waitress had ZERO personality and she looked like she would have rather been anywhere else but work. It's hard to be so critical because we own restaurants here in the valley as well and we fully understand, we still tipped over 20% but only ate 5% of our food. Whomever your manager/owner is needs to get the ship back on course, staff, food and ambience are all severely lacking. Compared to your other locations, this is by far your weakest."}
{"text":"Sooo Metro gets a 3.5 in my book, but due to my fiance's obsession with this place (and the fact that he'd give it 10 stars), I'm rounding up. For that greasy \"mall style\" Sbarro-esque genre of pizzas.. this place gets a gold star. Absolutely the \"best in class\" for this sort of pizza. My fiance is obsessed with this sort of pizza, so this is right up his alley. If you eat at Sbarro and think \"wow, I wish someone would make a top quality version of this stuff\".. you will love this place!  I was obsessed with Metro when we first moved here as well. The gooey cheese, the greasy crust.. I was loving it. HOWEVER, we order delivery from here about once a month and twice we've gotten undercooked pizzas, and once an overcooked one. The overcooked one I can let slide, but the undercooked ones are pretty gross. The crust at the bottom isn't formed correctly and you're basically just eating greasy cheese goo. It just isn't right. The pizza is pretty pricey (ends up being $30 for us to get a pizza delivered with tip and the bogus $5 they add on since we're all of 3 miles away). I don't mind pricey pizza, but I get pissed when I paid $30 for pizza that totally sucked. Now that this has happened twice I'm more hesistent to keep them as my go to delivery place.   Settebello and Grimaldi's and Rosati's are all better in my book, but for whatever reason this place is always my fiance's first choice."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Metro Location because I feel like I'm dining on a Save by the Bell set ! Yay for cheesy 80's decor !   We come here for lunch every once in awhile. Their lunch specials are a great deal. Unfortunately they aren't listed on the website, but off the top of my head they are $7.99 . They come with hot bread (as if you need bread to wash your pizza down with, but seriously it's some tasty bread!), a salad, a drink + a decent sized personal pizza.   As a bonus, if you're eating low carb or are on a diet, they have crustless pizza. I know it sounds ridiculous to order this, but for us dieters this can be a life saver! It's basically a tall pan filled with sauce, toppings and cheese. MMM. All the pizza taste with way less calories."}
{"text":"Last meal before heading back to the islands couldnt have ended it any better than this vegas was good to me!"}
{"text":"Hands down.  The Best pizza in the US Second only to Italy.  Amazing Delish stuffed crust pizza.  Fun atmosphere.   Friendly service.  Please please open a sore in San Diego!   MUAH!!"}
{"text":"I found this place on yelp, and for that I need to thank my fellow yelpers who gave us this tip.  Pizza was fabulous, as were the garlic fries, but the free bread at the beginning was out of this world.  We had one of their specials with basically every kind of meat, peppers and onions.  It was really very good.  Service was quick and very polite.  I liked it so much I took the leftovers to the hotel room, set them on the A/C and ate it the next day for breakfast.  BTW the large pizzas are HUGE.  A little pricey but it was good enough to justify the cost."}
{"text":"We came here for dinner the food is so good. Large portions must try the Gotham pizza get it metro style thick crust it's worth the extra price. My husband got the thin crust cheese pizza the sauce is perfect. The pasta dishes are huge lots of food for next day. We will come here again."}
{"text":"The Metro pizza was amazingly thick and delicious. I also had Minestrone soup, it was really thick and tastes like chili so I wasn't a fan. They served us table bread which was hot and soft, service was good and the restaurant was clean. We used the Yelp checkin and got a free soda, plus we dined on a Wednesday at 4, not knowing it was half off all pizzas annnd used a $25 giftcard so our bill was $5!"}
{"text":"We've been here twice while visiting family in Vegas and they are always super friendly and offer great service.  Their pizza is great and so is their yummy bread.  On this last visit, we spun the wheel and won a free pizza which they took off our check right then.  It was also Disney weekend and a couple of the kids were wearing Marvel superhero shirts.  We asked them if that counted and they said yes and took 25% off our bill too!  Great place! We will be back!"}
{"text":"I just called to order a pizza from here. I live literally 2.5 miles from the place. They wanted to charge $10 delivery charge. I mean I was willing to try the pizza even at the high price  but to charge that for delivery is just INSANE. I won't bother trying their pizza . I had to give it one star to post this.  Clearly undeserving"}
{"text":"I was expecting a lot from Metro Pizza, especially after reading the great reviews. The pizza is anything but inspired, delicious, or innovative. The regular crust and sauce is blah. Toppings were alright, but not enough and poorly placed. The worst part about it was the price. Way too expensive for this boring pizza pie. Will order Dominoes next time I have a pizza craving in Vegas."}
{"text":"Love metro pizza! The Coke is perfect. The food is consistently delicious! 3 adults and 4 kids all left happy and satisfied. We ordered the chicken fingers, garlic Parmesan fries, nuclear fries,  a big 'ol pizza, a chicken salad, a dinner salad and a few kids pizzas. All of which was yummy. Our server was Brandy (I think?) she was so sweet and very attentive. And sang happy birthday to my son and husband. The fella that came around filling or drinks and boxed our pizza was very nice and helpful as well. I love this location, we've been eating here for years."}
{"text":"Greasy, floppy, cheesy. Absolutely the bomb. My buddies and I love to frequent Ellis Island for cheap craps and luckily for me Metro is located inside. Every time I go to Vegas I get this pizza at least twice."}
{"text":"Take-Out Experience: 86th Street Square Pie - Sicilian Style, Mozzarella, Slow-simmered Tomato Sauce, Romano Cheese, Olive Oil, Cup and Char Pepperoni The 718 Calzone - Golden Fried with Whipped Ricotta, diced Ham, fresh Mozzarella and a side of Tomato Sauce Stromboli - Hand Rolled with Ham, Salami, Pepperoni, Mozzarella, Red Peppers 9\" Abbondanza - Pepperoni, Sausage, Ham, Ground Beef, Tomato Sauce, Mozzarella Cannoli Tiramisu Chocolate Fudge Layer Cake  When family comes to town and only has two requests, one of them for a sweet breakfast spot they've been lusting over via Instagram and the other for a calzone served by one of America's true Pizza legends it is not too difficult to accommodate, a take-out lunch from John Arena at Metro Pizza at Decatur continuing to show that Las Vegas' Pizza scene rivals any in the nation from top-to-bottom, with a few newer spots also cropping up in recent months to fill the space between.  Not generally one to do take-out, but a confluence of circumstances including work, other meals and travel making it a necessity since Chef Arena wanted to say hi to the visitors, it was just before noon on Friday that two ladies visited the \"Retro\" Metro to pick up an order that turned out to include a few bonus items, dining on paper plates in a small office not exactly as much fun as a visit to the Pizza parlor, but showing signs that Metro's product stands up to delivery, though there was never really any doubt considering the birthday spread and countless pharmaceutical company deliveries in the months before.  Starting off with one of Metro's signature Pizzas, the crust one of those indistinct styles that is fluffy around the edges with a slightly wet center that is certainly not Neapolitan, but also not like pan or crispy and thin, the \"Abbondanza\" features all sorts of Meat atop Metro's slow-roasted Sauce and melty Mozzarella plus freshly torn Basil, the \"86th Street Square Pie\" a more recent addition that has thrilled diners ever since it joined the menu just over a year ago, a true Sicilian in the best of ways with great lightness and an open crumb thanks to the prolonged fermenting process.  Happy to see the hand rolled Stromboli for the first time, Metro Pizza's Dough wrapped tightly around Ham, Salami, Pepperoni, Red Peppers and Cheese with a crispy exterior and fluffy center that will make fans of Four Kegs wonder why they've been sitting at that Dive for so long, it was after everyone else had already gotten their fill of the \"718\" that the glistening yet oilless pouch once again proved a best-of-the-best choice, the smooth Ricotta and Mozzarella blend literally bursting forth with occasional bits of Ham as soon as a knife punctured the surface.    Sold out of Carrot Cake temporarily, the most popular Dessert on Metro's menu something worth going out of one's way for at a price less than half what Carbone charges for a lesser version in a smaller portion, it was instead with a slice of Chocolate Cake, Tiramisu and two Cannoli that the meal came to an end, the filled-to-order shells still leagues better than the one's people line up for at Carlo's or Buddy V's while the Tiramisu was better than remembered, the Lady Fingers a bit lighter and the Coffee flavor more balanced amidst the Mascarpone.  *****Unable to rate a 'restaurant' on take-out, but still the best comprehensive Pizza experience in a city where places like Pizza Rock and Flour & Barley have attempted to be everything to everyone in recent years, Metro Pizza remains \"America's Neighborhood Pizzeria\" in marketing only - it belongs to the people of Las Vegas and Southern Nevada at any of its five locations, though we are happy to share with anyone who is looking for the sort of stuff you can't find on the Strip with a few recent experiences showing delivery to not cause any sort of quality compromise."}
{"text":"With at least two new Pizzerias of note opening in the last month it was shortly following The International Pizza Expo that five guests paid a visit to Metro Pizza on Sky Pointe Drive, John Arena and new World Pizza Champions Team Member Chris Decker continuing to produce a larger variety of Pies than anyone else in Las Vegas and doing it all by hand with a smile on their faces.   Not quite as banner a year for Las Vegas Pizzaiolos as 2017, though the continuously growing Expo once again set attendance records for a city that now enters the conversation of America's Pizza destinations with regularity, it was just past noon that a table was set in front of ovens where John could tell of Metro's history as well as stories of countless Pizzerias across the world, his praise of others constant  and unyielding  whether the person has been doing it for decades or if they are just beginning and willing to learn.  Planning the visit based on one travelers assertion that John Arena's 718 Calzone is amongst the best things she has ever eaten, the fried pocket of Whipped Ricotta and fresh Mozzarella plus a bit of Ham almost impossibly light despite a quick bath in hot Oil, it was while John and Chris were working side-by-side that Beverages were served alongside Metro's complimentary table Bread plus four Garlic Knots and Fries, the former sliced and centered by tender Meatballs plus Sauce and melted Cheese for about the same price as just the Knots at some Las Vegas Boulevard venues.  Going off-menu from here, a plate of housemade grilled Bread served with imported Salami, Burrata and top-shelf Olive Oil, it was straight from the hands of Chef Arena that a golden-brown Pie featuring blended Flour plus toppings of Cream, Pancetta and Pistachios impressed all by being light and crisp yet appropriately chewy, the supposed \"second ever\" Grandma Pie from Chris inspired by watching the team at King Umberto hot on its heels and nearly sheet-pan thin yet rigid with nothing but the basics allowing no room to hide any mistakes, though as expected there were none to find.  Whipping up one last novelty before popping next door to Lulu's Bread & Breakfast for a special request, a bi-layer Pie stuffed with Nutella and reduced Blueberries eating not unlike a Galette and inspiring a story from John about the history of \"Dessert Pizza\" both at Metro and elsewhere, it was finally in a steamy slice of Bread Pudding French Toast riddled with Peaches that Lunch came to a conclusion, everything about  the visit as educational as it was delicious and each guest exiting smiling as broadly as the two guys who really seem to live the quote \"Find something you love to do, and you'll never work a day in your life.\""}
{"text":"Being that I am  regular customer at the Green Valley location I figured Id swing by this location on the way home from work yesterday. I always order the same thing (large Bleeker street and nuke fries.) We were seated in a booth and when we went to sit down there was a large hole in the seat so we sat on the other side. Ive been eating at metro since they were New York pizza on Sandhill and Flamingo in 1983..Ive never seen the standards drop like this. The place was decorated with cardboard \"Grease\" pictures which I thought was kind of silly and made the place look cheap. It took about 7 or 8 minutes for the server to come take our drinks which is understandable if they were busy but they weren't. I think the owners need to come visit and get this place up to the standard I have come to expect from Metro. It is my fav pizza in town but there are plenty of others to choose from."}
{"text":"This is my favorite pizza place in my 'hood.  Nuclear fries and Deep Dish with pepperoni.  So, I've been a patron of Metro since High School. (major date hang out) And the one on Decatur and Flamingo is still my favorite location.  They have this great seating section with a drive in movie theme that is retro without making you annoyed, it's just cool.  It certainly has a malt shop aesthetic but thankfully, no waitresses named Flo and no one Karaoke singing on top of tables for tips.    The Pizza is awesome, and I think I would go so far to say that it's Vegas' original Pizza Joint."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town! Every location is superb except the tenaya location!! Been going to metro for years now, and it's always top notch! Love the crispy crust and the robust tomato sauce. Pizza always come out the brick oven piping hot and I dont even mind burning the roof of my mouth damn there everytime! Want a great family sit down setting then go to the Henderson location or trip location! Want a to go order then go to Decatur or the Ellis island location!! Just by any means don't go to the North Las Vegas location. Was so disappointed by that location. You would think it was a whole different company running it. But other than that greatest pizza in Las Vegas!!"}
{"text":"I don't live in Vegas, but when I visit I ask my friend if we can go. It's delicious. Only $100 for a family of four (how did that happen!!), but it was good I would say don't go all the time, but when you want to be like Bruno and spend money like money ain't ish then yea.  Also the bathrooms smell like vanilla."}
{"text":"I'm giving 2 stars because the service was horrible.  Our waiter was grumpy from the beginning.  Slow to take drink orders and seemed annoyed.  Once we finally ordered, our food didn't take too long and was good.  The waiter never came back to check on us and I had to ask the hostess and bus guy when we needed refills, etc. We waited for our bill for 15 minutes."}
{"text":"It's national meatball day and i am on a quest for a perfect meatball parm  hero, I say hero because I'm originally from new yawk and I always loved the pizza at metro pizza restaurants so I figured I would try the meatballs, I certainly wasn't disappointed chef Chris nailed it! A real homemade meatball as good as my moms,I'm also Italian by the way! They have a new social hour menu that's just great and very reasonably priced. of course I couldn't leave without a little pizza.the thin crust 12 inch pie was fantastic and only 7 dollars, and the meatball parm sliders on a fresh garlic-crusted roll (not just a garlic knot)but a perfect dinner roll. They've were only 2 dollars each!  They had other offers on the social hour menu I can't wait to try! By the way some pizza places here use frozen meatballs,This place is not one of them. You can't stay in business for over 35 years in Vegas  serving sub par food. Metro pizza proves it every day."}
{"text":"For the most part everyone is nice and we never had a problem before, but there is man that served us and is absolutely horrible!!! He was the worst server and when I needed to make formula for my infant he insisted on giving me tap water, when I said no he threw a fit. Needless to say we walked out. When they fire him I will come back!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere is great. The food and service is awesome. And individual pizza is enough for two. The only thing that keeps them from getting the fifth star is the price. Maybe had we been warned that a small pizza was enough for two we wouldn't be taking home two half individual pizzas. Great selection of draft beer. Really liked the craft beer selection."}
{"text":"This pizza was okay. I ordered a pepperoni slice. It was extremely greasy but I was hungry and didn't feel like looking for food too far from my terminal. I think I paid around $5 for the slice."}
{"text":"Went for pizza on Mother's Day.  We were worried it would be busy, but at 5:15 pm it was ok.  There was no one at the hostess desk....we stood for a minute or so and a waiter, who we later learned was named Ernest asked if we'd been helped.  He finished with his table, grabbed some menus and took us to a booth.  He said he'd be back with silverware.  Sure enough, he came rushing by and gave us the silverware and said he might as well take our order since he was there.  Great.....at least he is paying attention to us.  Next server to come by asks if we need drinks/order and we tell her we've been taken care of.  We ask who is the guy helping us and this is when we learn his name is Ernest.  She asks if something is wrong....saying she is one of the managers....We told her that if it weren't for Ernest, we'd still be standing by the hostess stand, that no one was there, and he took it upon himself to take care of us.  She then starts to give excuses as to why no one is around to help....a couple of large groups, needed to set up.........don't care.....You don't leave the floor empty to cater to a couple of groups and you certainly don't give that as an excuse.  Food was good....and if it weren't for Ernest, we might not return to this location.  Looking at our receipt, I see the server who got credit for waiting on us was NOT Ernest, but Jen J......I certainly hope they pool tips, because Ernest deserved the tip more than Jen."}
{"text":"The restaurant is pretty roomy, has a nice feel.  They bring out a warm sliced bread loaf to start, very Tasty!  We ordered a large Gotham pizza, it was ok, I wasn't overly excited about the taste and the crust was a little soggy for my taste.  My nephew had maccaroni and cheese from the kids menu, it was a HUGE portion and huge maccaroni pasta, but it was really yummy. I think I would come back and try another pizza with a side of maccaroni & cheese, prob ask for extra crisp crust.  FYI prize was ok"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Metro Pizza forever because I've heard such good things about it! For appetizers, my boyfriend and I shared Garlic Romano Fries which was amazing (highly recommended). Then we ordered The Stockyard stuffed pizza, which was also amazing! We ordered a small, and with one slice each, we were stuffed. We got our sauce on the side because I like the plain and my boyfriend likes the meat sauce. Amazing food for an affordable price."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite pizza places in the Vegas Valley. Whether you prefer \"traditional\" ingredients, \"exotic\" pizzas, thin crust, thick crust, or regular crust, this restaurant has it all. They even have a collection of stuffed pizzas to choose from.  The large pizzas can get a little pricey, but they're HUGE and great for sharing or having leftovers the next day. To get more bang for your buck, I suggest dining between 2:30-4:30 on weekdays when the pizzas are 50% off.  It's difficult to narrow it down to just a few, but my favorite pizzas here are probably the Spring Street (meatballs, ricotta and roasted peppers), Abbondanza (pepperoni, sausage, ham and ground beef) and Mott Street (sausage, green peppers and onions). A lot of people I know love the Sunspot (grilled chicken, artichoke hearts, garlic, Roma tomatoes and fresh basil) and Seafood Fra Diavolo (grilled shrimp and calamari with mozzarella and tomato sauce).  The Domenica Salad and Tuscan Salad are also excellent items to share and a lot of people feel this spot has the best meatball sliders in town. Whatever you decide on, make sure you save room for a cannoli for dessert. They're ridiculously good."}
{"text":"I've been to their Henderson location, for which I kind of like the layout better, but the pizza is just as good here.  A friend and I came here for a later dinner, and all the workers were friendly, and the pizza was delicious.  Thanks again, Metro Pizza!"}
{"text":"As my first foray into Las Vegas pizza, I was extremely happy with this place!  Our waiter was extremely diligent and courteous (even got basketball scores for my dad, who was curious about how his favorite team was doing), and checked on us frequently.  We got a salad with pear, tomato, and mixed greens - very very delicious - and a large pizza with onion and green pepper - ALSO very delicious!  Brick oven style pizza is my favorite - I just love that certain taste.  And that's what you'll get here.  The cool thing is, the kitchen is in an open alcove, so you can actually see the oven, and the workers making your pizza.  This place just has a really nice atmosphere.  Even though there's a bar and TVs, my dad and I didn't have to shout to hear each other.  I look forward to bringing friends here when I return."}
{"text":"Our first time here , a group of 13 kids and 10 parents invaded yesterday for Prom= including me . The manger was so accommodating and kind with our reservations and requests, even helping us hang up a banner we had . Garlic fries and calamari were both DELICIOUS! I didn't try the pizza , but from what I heard it was also good. Great service, very kind and accommodating. We sampled the gelato and it was yummy = Italian roasted pistachio and espresso. We will definitely be back !"}
{"text":"Good service food is always amazing. So much to choose from. Not just your everyday pizza spot. Family environment"}
{"text":"Calamari was ok, breaking was that crispy but overall it was good.  Ordered New York style because it was the special.  Not impressed with the crust. Usually the crust is nice and crispy.  This time it seemed like there was too much sauce because the crust was soaked and chewy.  Sauce and cheese were good.  Still hasn't swayed me. Metro is still totally worth it."}
{"text":"OK, so you NY'ers will know what I mean when I say that Metro's cheese pizza is the kind that you'd be happy to walk into any New York pizza place and order a slice of.  And anywhere in Brooklyn, it would be cheap and satisfying.  It's satisfying for sure but, the quality doesn't match the price.  I feel like I'm getting jipped - getting my \"pretty good\" NY style pizza but for a far too expensive price.  I liked the restaurant, the service was OK, and the rest of the food was good.  But just too expensive, so I'm taking off a couple of stars.  If you're looking for something different and a pretty satisfying pie that reheats well, give this a shot for sure."}
{"text":"We just moved here from California, so we are trying out all the italian places to find one we like. This one came highly recommended by some local friends. Perhaps other locations would be better?  Before reading this, please understand, we are a low salt intake family. So when we say it has no salt or seasoning, it means literally none.  It was tasteless. Utterly bereft of seasoning. My calzone, which was supposed to be mushrooms, basil, tomato, and cheese had literally no basil in it. Not fresh, not even dry. No salt, no pepper, no seasoning AT ALL.  They just threw in the stuff and basically steam cooked it.The mushrooms and tomatoes were undercooked. The calzone was about 7 inches tall because they didnt cook it right. (hense the fillings being steamed.)  I would have sent it back, but we realized it wasn't just my meal that was tasteless. My husbands pizza was mediocre at best, with, again, practically flavorless sauce.   Our childs \"mac n cheese\" was just some bland gross cheese sauce poured over pasta. I am pretty sure the cheese sauce was pre packaged glop. Velveta mac n cheese has more flavor... I would say velveta has too much salt, but seriously, did they put ANY salt, pepper or seasoning of any kind in the cheese sauce? If you want to make mac n cheese the easy way, just give us the pre packaged stuff and admit it.  It was so flavorless that I thought they were feeding us nursing home food. But I think even THAT would have some Italian seasoning. Honestly, does your chef even know how to cook Italian?  The bread was tastey, hard to mess up bread. I ate the bread and the calzone crust with gusto.   The server was excellent. Friendly and prompt. We did not complain about our meal in the restaurant because we didnt want the server to get any possible backlash. Also because we knew the lack of seasoning must be a chronic issue."}
{"text":"The only pizza that beats this one in my book is Malnati's deep dish in Chicago! (That gets a 10 if you're looking for scale)  The Good: The sauce is seasoned beautifully and the cheese doesn't overpower it or the toppings.  The sausage was great and there was plenty on our pie.   They deliver to casino hotels.   Prices are in line with most pizza.    It's really yummy!   The Bad:  The delivery people never delivered to the same area twice! By that I mean we ordered pizza 3 times the week we were there (yup, kids!) once they delivered to the elevator area, once to the lobby and a third time to the concierge.  It was like \"Where the hell is Waldo with our pizza?\" It might have been easier to spot him if he were wearing a striped shirt and stocking hat!  I'm not much of a wing eater but my handsome wing-man is.  He said \"meh\" on the wings but scarfed the pizza pie like he hadn't eaten in a week! No leftovers on that.   One star off for delivery confusion and meh wings.   The Ugly: You'll get home and crave it.   A final note:  It's just a dang good pie! Order up but give detailed instructions on where to meet if you're in a casino hotel. Carry your cell when going down to meet them, you'll need it!"}
{"text":"Terrible all around! We had the pizza with artichokes, chicken, basil & tomatos. It was horrible! Not only did the pizza have the soggiest crust possible, but the chicken had absolutely no flavor. The service was fine and they kept the drinks filled. I will never go to metro pizza again. Usually when you have terrible food there is a positive, but this place had no positive. I don't know what was worse the food or the decor. Ick!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've eaten at a Metro Pizza, I use to live right up the road so it was my go to pizza place. Since we moved we are too far to eat it often.  The pizza is still pretty good but the service could use some improvement. Good New York style pizza.  I called to place an order for pick up, when they answered I was asked if I mind holding, of course not. But 5 minutes later and I was still holding, my husband called on his cell while I was waiting, and she put him on hold as well but returned to take his order 2 minutes later, I was still on hold with my phone for 8 minutes!  Beware if you get pepperoni the pizza gets really greasy, especially if it's to go, on top and bottom. Pizza is a bit pricey.  Restaurant has out dated look. We usually get our food to go."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best pizza you'll ever have, and they cater to both thin and thick crust aficionados alike! Toppings are plentiful and yummy!   There are other locations, but this location is the bet IMHO. Total throwback to the 80s, it's great!  Service is always exceptional, efficient and extraordinarily friendly (especially Ann, who's been there something like 25+ years!)."}
{"text":"Pizza burnt while the kitchen was goofing off. Took so long to get the pizza I knew to check the bottom when it was finally served. Black bottom. They did redo the pizza. Server very pleasant and apologetic. Kitchen manager not so much."}
{"text":"My rating would be 5 stars, but high prices and poor service takes some stars away. Decent pizza, $20 for a large thin crust pepperoni at a local neighborhood is on the extreme high side of prices so I only go about once per month, otherwise I'd be there 2-3 times per week ordering. Free bread at the table while you wait and crayons for the kids is great to keep everyone calm. Chicken fingers with fries are pricey, but cooked to perfection. I've ordered these several times with my pizzas and every time they serve them, they fail over and over again at bringing ketchup. Even when you ask the server you'll be usually having to ask a second time because they forgot. What's the deal with not bringing the $2 bottle of ketchup with the fries or include it in a small cup in the basket?. They act like it's fine bottle of wine and don't want you to have it. Also AVOID sitting at the booths near the bar, otherwise you get little to no service because the bartender that makes all the drinks for the whole place also has to wait on you."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite place especially for Bday party's & lunch with a gang!!! The last time I went there it was HORRIBLE!! To say the least!!! The staff had changed the happy hour now eliminates the stuff pizza & ours delivered 1 & 45 minutes after ordered was wrong...all onions & mushrooms it was like some sick joke, they totally ruined my friends 88th birthday & looked at me like I was crazy when I said we r leaving & not paying anything!! We ate at Panda Express better food, service & attitude!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the Loop and at first I was happy with it. The pizza had a great flavor. Then, I ran into pineapple, which I didn't order. But, the worst was that my 12 year old daughter took a bite and bit into a large piece of cardboard that had been cooked into the pizza. It makes me wonder what else may have been carelessly tossed into my pizza and what my family and I may have eaten. Pictures are posted. The piece of cardboard is paired with Metros own cheese cup for scale."}
{"text":"Not being a huge pizza lover my opinion may be skewed. That being said, this place serves up some unique combinations as well as an outstanding antipasti platter. It's very close to my house and the kids really like it so I've been here a few times. We ordered the ravioli on our most recent visit and good googly moogly it was HUGE. The whole plate was one giant ravioli, not several individual ones. The marinara sauce isn't overly acidic or bold. It's actually a very mild understated sauce, which i like. The ravioli had very thin delicate pasta surrounding the ricotta cheese middle and it worked wonderfully with the sauce. I've had the stuffed cheese pizza with sauce served in the side and that's delicious as well. The gelatto is creamy perfection, coming in flavors like salted caramel and banana with chocolate chip. My only disappointment was the garlic rolls. They are too much dry dough, not enough butter and garlic. Plus they're too big for the butter to penetrate. They're dry and not as good as the complimentary bread served when you sit down."}
{"text":"This is our \"go-to\" pizza spot! I'm from the northeast so my pizza standards are high! Ingredients are fresh, homemade and the menu is creative. My favorite is just the plain pepperoni east side pizza. Garlic knots and meatball sliders are also great- worth the indulgence of carbs :)."}
{"text":"AWESOME!    We came with a large party that unfortunately, the organizer of the event neglected to confirm a reservation.  So, when we all started entering, needless to say, the staff was a bit overwhelmed and at a loss as to what to do.  BUT, they immediately set up space for 25-30 people and called in reinforcements to provide quality service.   I can't ask for more from a small business and I only hoped my large tipping told the staff exactly my appreciation!"}
{"text":"The pizza here is good. Good enough to go back to their not so great customer service and $10 delivery fee? Not so much.  The thing with companies like this is that they stop caring about the customer because they feel like their business will always be around  because they've already built a customer base.  That's my only explanation as to why they  could treat customers that way."}
{"text":"I really like this pizza, best I've tried in Vegas but I haven't tried many.  This is only the third pizza place I've been to and I would stop here  but  the service is bad.  The  delivery  charge is $10 and my pizza came over 30 minutes late.  This pizza is also over priced, I think they would get a lot more customers if they were a bit more pleasant and had better prices."}
{"text":"Did it again, Metro is the best food! Love it here, anytime, any item seems to be great, no exception. With family here, we tried the anti pasta salad, the east side pizza and the calamari. My husband pre ordered, so we had to just walk in and were immediately serviced. That was nice.   The anti pasta salad was a surprise, there were plenty for the four of us and I did take a little left overs for lunch the next day. Be sure to try this salad, it's really good."}
{"text":"We've been a patron of Metro for a long time. It's always been real consistant and we  had come to expect a good meal, always! We've been to three locations amd they were always the same until last night!  We had dinner at the Tropicana location. We got to sit right away, they took our drink order and came back quickly for the food order, but the guy never wrote it down. We generally are big eaters and order a lot, last night was no exception.   We asked for baked zitti with meat sauce, sandwich and 1/2 clam and 1/2 sausage, pepperoni and mushroom pizza.  What we got was a burnt pizza!   Half was clams, a little too much garlic and salty for me, the other half was without our requested mushrooms, instead we got peppers! The baked zitti was regular without any meat so they toyally got our order wrong.  They weren't full or busy, there was plenty of staff but it seems our waiter thought he remembered our order. Unfortunately it was very wrong, I like my pizza crispy on the bottom but not charred!   I gave a two since they filled our drinks often enough, were friendly but the food was junk. Hopefully next time they can get it right!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love it here! Always just sit at the bar and get a couple pitchers of beer and a large Gotham pizza. It's always busy too but service is very quick."}
{"text":"Went here on a Sunday afternoon...started Off a bit slow on service but once our server got there things were A-ok. We ordered a 1/2 Modesto 1/2 pep/sausage.  I also got a small salad. Salad was no frills as it was just iceberg, onions, a few croutons and tomato (ranch on the side).  Pizza took a little long is my only complaint it was a good 25 mins. But it was ok....we got bread and butter. Bread was good it had sesame seeds and was crusty good.  When pizza arrived it was yummy. The side with pep/mush was oily, I much preferred the Modesto....now that was good. We used the yelp free drink offer and got a diet coke.  Getting our bill took long as well so 1 star knock off for time it took to get a server and get our bill. Food was really good though. We'd return prob during happy hour where you can get pizza for 1/2 off. Next time I am ordering calamari!!"}
{"text":"I rushed in front of my computer screen to write this review after coming home from the godsend that is Metro Pizza. This is easily one of the best pies I've ever had in my life!   3 Reasons why Metro Pizza is as good as it gets:  1. The service was spectacular. Before we ordered, my dining companions had a math-heavy conversation about whether two small pizzas or one large pizza was going to be a better deal. We asked the manager the same question. I thought that I was going to get some BS answer but I was pleasantly surprised he had already done the math. He assured us that the large is indeed a better deal than two small pizzas. Of course they answered all of our \"stupid\" questions, topped off our waters, brought us refills of bread during our pizza wait, and the usual. At the end of the meal, the manager brought out complimentary cannoli's. What's there to complain about?  2. Metro Pizza is extremely accommodating. They were happy to half/half our pizza. We ended up ordering a large with the Patheon on one side and a Meat Lovers' on the other side. Metro Pizza also gave us nice sides of ranch without the usual 33 cent fee. They have a calendar of specials every day so you know you are going to get amazing food at a steal!  3. The Pie is amazing! Not too thick, not too thin.,.not burnt nor under-cooked. Goldilocks would have been pleased...these people put time and love into their pies. Everything tasted delicious but what impressed me the most was the crust! Pizza crusts are usually doughy and heavy but no! This one was light, crispy and airy. Amazing....simply amazing."}
{"text":"You can count on Metro Pizza to have consistent, delicious pies. They have yet to let me down. Although Metro's menu also has dinners and salads, the focus is on celebrating different styles of pizza across the country. You can see this geographically with the mural of the United States on the back wall which highlights landmark locales.  The restaurant is open and group celebrations are encouraged with an area in the rear that accommodate around 20-30. There's seating at the small bar with booths along one side. The beer and wine list is short but sweet with enough variation for the drinker to find something of their liking.   Along with calzones, they have regular, stuffed, East side, and specialty pizzas. Our favorites are the Gotham: pepperoni, sausage, mushroom, green peppers, ground beef and onion. This is a pretty classic supreme pizza which topping combination you can't go wrong with. We also like The Loop which is a stuffed pizza with sausage, pepperoni, and roasted mushrooms. The small ($13.50) is the perfect size for my wife and I with four filling slices, three for me and one for her. If you plan on taking it home and don't want the pie to get too soggy, you can control your portion by getting the sauce on the side.  Service has always been solid and consistent for us. I've seen a couple of servers that have been working at this location for at least 3 years. I also stop by occasionally for the lunch specials. I either get a the individual cheese pizza or a pasta with salad and complimentary soft drink for under $10. That's pretty good value to me. They give you the entire bottle of dressing for your salad. Also, keep an eye on the calendar which you can access online. You'll find a special going on almost every day of the month."}
{"text":"We got a large sausage & mushroom pizza last night. Good flavors, fresh tasting ingredients and it was cooked properly. We really enjoyed it but were left wanting more after all was said and done.  In my opinion, the price is on the high side at $22, and the large wasn't quite as big as it should be when comparing it to some of their competitors.  To sum it up... Quality ingredients, good taste, on the small size, and a bit overpriced."}
{"text":"Specially if u have out of town friends you relly want to take them out here metro pizza is so good great quality sause. ..and if you order the garlic bread...I guaranteed you u will never see a garlic bread the same ....we got a huge pizza for $40 small bar but cool to hung out and have a beer with it my fave so far..."}
{"text":"I've always heard about how Metro Pizza is a Vegas institution and yet it seemed that no one I knew ever went there. I never went either, but mainly because I'm always afraid to try non-chain pizza places here.  Alas, recently, I was in the neighborhood, was hungry, AND had some money to blow. Perfect scenario to try something new, amirite?   The decor of the place is akin to your stereotypical, 80s/90s family restaurant. With red and white cheesecloth table coverings and everything. It actually made the place feel really comfy to me. I sat at the bar and ordered garlic knots and an \"individual sized\" (more on why I put that in quotes in a minute) Triple Play pizza, which was basically a Chicago-style thin crust pizza.   In spite of the fact I ordered garlic knots, they STILL brought out bread and butter while I was waiting. So it was already clear how generous they were here. The garlic knots were huge and they were delightful. I'm talkin' drink the sauce and lick your fingers good. A slight gripe is that they could have been baked just a teeny little bit softer, but beyond that they definitely have to be the best garlic knots I've had after the ones at Chicago Brewing Co.   What they call an individual pizza could easily serve two, three if we're talking light eaters. It had a cracker like crust with plenty of crunch to the bite, and was topped with  a generous helping of well-seasoned patty-style sausage. I made it through slightly less than half of it before I had to take the rest to go.   My waitress frequently stopped by to ask how everything was and was refilling my drink without me even asking. To top off the already exceptional service, she gave me the tuesday night special (25% off your meal between 5 and 9 pm) in spite of the fact that I came in at four. What I thought would have been at least a $20 bill if not a little more ended up only being $14! I decided to just go on ahead and give her the rest of it as a tip!  It's a shame I didn't discover this place for myself earlier. I really do feel like I've been missing out now.   The Final Verdict  Pros: Home-y, slightly retro ambiance. Generous portions. Above and beyond service One of the best pizzas in Vegas. Pizza cooks who are competent with Chicago-style pizzas.   Cons: Garlic Knots could have been softer. But this is minor.    Return Factor: 10/10. They have a menu that's really worth exploring."}
{"text":"We went here because I Googled low carb pizza and they came up. It started off great, we were quickly seated and served. They brought  a basket of bread it was just OK. Not worth the calories. I ordered wine, chicken wings and a pizza. Husband ordered a pizza. He said his was good but not enough sauce or cheese. The wings were not crispy and not spicy at all. Then my pizza came so much after my husbands he had finished his by the time mine arrived. I also wanted a second glass of wine and had to call someone over to order it. If I were a server I would be all over the wine. It is the fastest way to up the bill and increase the tip. It seems this happens frequently that they keep the soft drinks full but never ask about wine. Anyway it was just OK here. May go back for the low carb pizza which we didn't end up getting."}
{"text":"Metro is a place to go when you want a nice family setting with good pizza, good salads, and good bread products.  We love taking friends from out of town here and splitting one of the pizzas.  When we are by ourselves we always get a large salad with their house made italian.  the dressing is amazing.  Our favorite items are the garlic knot sliders.  The meatball is good, just wish they were whole or bigger meatballs.  The caprese (sp) is really good.  The mozzarella is fresh and the balsamic is very tasty.  All of their pizzas are good and the family friendly vibe keeps us coming back!"}
{"text":"I am from Buffalo, NY, the home of the best pizza and Italian food in the country so I have high standards. This place is ok, pizza has a sweet sauce which I find enjoyable but the spaghetti sauce is way under done in my taste. They are local and convenient so we go once in awhile even though it's not my favorite. Their gelato is really good, my family loves that and Lulu's bread they give when you sit down in the best bread in the city."}
{"text":"Metro is great and all, but definitely a better dine-in experience than delivery. Flavor wise, you can't go wrong. My favorites are the Gotham and the Modesto. I've ordered delivery a few times now. Delivery has been timely, although the delivery fee for delivery within 3 miles is a little steep, it's not horrendous. My biggest complaint is that the pizza is soggy. I pay 28 dollars for a pizza (not including tip) I do expect it not to be soggy. It's hot and mostly delicious, and crisp until about halfway to the center of the pizza when crust becomes soggy! I first thought it was a one time thing, but no, this has been the third time ordering delivery with soggy pizza.   That being said, this has never been an issue dining in."}
{"text":"We left the strip taking an Uber to get what's considered among the best Sicilian pizza in America.   No doubt it was well worth the trip....absolutely outstanding.    Watch this:   https://www.facebook.com/metropizzalasvegas/videos/10158686997885370/"}
{"text":"Great pizza at a really good value.  I would suggest trying it out!  We had a regular crust pepperoni & mushroom and it was really good.  I also had the volcano fries and they were OK....a little spicy but that's about it.  The inside of the restaurant looks like we walked onto the set of saved by the bell!"}
{"text":"I really have no idea why every is so in  love with this chain. It's your basic greasy, thin crust pizza, WAY overpriced. This is seriously what everyone keeps voting as the best pizza in Vegas? SERIOUSLY!? Ick. I've had pizza at Pizza Hut that had more flavor than the one I ate here. The crust is bland, the cheese is, well cheese, and for all I know the sauce could have been like Ragu or something."}
{"text":"I still don't know why people are so in love with this chain. I went once for their one slice for charity and didn't like it, but I thought I would give them another try, for reals this time.  I wasn't surprised by the still mediocre food give to us. First off, the cheapest large pizza this place has is 17$. That's just for a cheese pizza, and it goes up to nearly 30$ for specialty ones. Luckily we came here during their half off time- which is nearly everyday at a certain time. It should be a warning when a place has  half off their food nearly everyday;  it is ridiculous to pay full price for this food.  It's very bland, in my opinion. The sauce tastes like glorified ketchup, and the cheese is tasteless. The garlic knots were only good because of the cheesy powder they are covered with, but again, the sauce that comes with them is not very good. I hear a lot about the crust, but I don't see what people crave about it.   Service was alright, there were only a few tables occupied (which is strange since this place is so big and SO popular) and we waited a long time to be seated and served.   Overall this place is ok, if you pay half price (8$) for their cheapest pie, but other than that, you won't see me here."}
{"text":"Not saying it's a bad place, but having a lactose intolerant person in my family, we don't go as much 'cause the cheese used makes a bad situation for the porcelain thrown.  When we do go, we enjoy the beers and the spacious feeling of the place."}
{"text":"So for the longest time my boyfriend was going on and on about how great this place was.  I always thought he was exaggerating and I wouldn't agree if I ever tried the place.  Sooo we finally went there together and I now must hang my head and say that I am a believer in Metro Pizza.  I got the chicken and herb calzone, he got the small Gotham.  The calzone (which was HUGE) had fresh tomatoes and herbs, cheese was evenly melted, and the chicken was nice and juicy.  As much as I hate to admit it, though, his pizza trumped all others I've had in Vegas.  The meat was juicy chunks of ground beef and pepperoni.  The crust was just the right amount of flaky and crunchy.  Mmmmm!!  Our waiter was very sweet and polite.  He seemed to be a hard worker as he was not only helping us, but cleaning about and doing other duties while the others didn't seem to be doing much.  Unfortunately, there was a weird smell towards the back of the restaurant where we were seated.  Almost a wet table rag smell.  The food and service made up for it though.  Definitely recommend Metro Pizza, maybe as take out... and I definitely will be back for more."}
{"text":"I work nearby for the moment and go here for slices of pizza at lunch. Slices are always delicious and consistent. Waitresses at the counter are always super nice.... great service! Just no slices on the weekends... I can live with that I suppose.... hahahaha!"}
{"text":"Good consistent pizza for the Vegas area. Garlic knots were delicious and huge. Pizza is always delicious. I finally tried the 718 calzone, I thought it was pretty good, but I like a little more ricotta cheese in my calzone. I will be back for sure!! Thanks Metro!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing. Great food, great atmosphere and the people there were really nice. I'm definitely going to be a regular here.  P.S. The meatball sliders are awesome!"}
{"text":"Came here over the weekend w my family - what a great family restaurant! It was pretty busy, but the wait time wasn't bad, approx 10-15 min. They do not accept reservations on the weekends. Upon sitting at our table, they have a calendar of the month and all the specials they offer (50% off a pizza for RNs on one day, 50% off for pizza from like 6-9pm on another day, etc). Wish I had known about the specials prior!  It was a bit diff then I remembered it from the last time I went. I had taken my niece and nephew before and they gave them pizza dough to mess around w while we waited for our meals, this time, it wasn't given/offered. It's been a few years though, so it may have changed awhile ago!  We ordered a half cheese/half meat pizza, fries, parm/garlic fries, juices, $3 beers (brewed by them), and a gelato and the bill came to about $40. The pizza was yummy and we still had left overs for a family of 4. The pizza was just as good on the next day. The gelatos were $7 but big enough to share! And they have like a little area where you can go look and choose.   The atmosphere is very family friendly. Good prices. Good service. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is always great..great service, best pizza Bartender behind the bar always a happy guy,tons of sports talk..n good times..I would call this the best pizza place in town...."}
{"text":"Dear Vegas,  Stop voting Metro our city's best pizza. It makes us look like a bunch of uncultured schmucks.  Anyone who says that Metro is anything like authentic New York style pizza has no idea what they're talking about.  This may be the greasiest pizza I have ever eaten. Sloppy, soggy and oily even when you think you're getting a fresh slice. And the crust tastes like Chef Boy-Ar-Dee pizza in a box.  New Yorkers wouldn't wipe their ass with this pizza. Certainly not with all that grease.  Skip Metro unless you're getting free slices and beers in the mail from Ellis Island."}
{"text":"One of the things that will make it seem like you have an alien growing out of your face while living in Vegas is when someone asks you if you have ever been to Metro Pizza and you say,\"No\". Its like that moment when you told your parents you where moving out. The people you are talking to just look at you for a moment with one eyebrow up a little and their mouth slightly open before they blurt out, \" WHAT\" followed my, \" OOOOOHHHHH YOU HAVE TO.\" The description of this moment could go on and on but I will get to the point of this review, Metro Pizza.   Let me start by saying, \" OOOOOOOHHHH YOU HAVETO GO\" We met some friends there for dinner and they had been there before so they have a good idea what they wanted but when we took a look at the menu it was very very hard to pick, hmmmm Do we want traditional pepperoni or may a BBQ pork and Pickle pizza. We ended up going with a stuffed meat pizza and the BBQ Pork and Pickle pizza.   Once the pizzas made it to the table I had that eyebrow lifted, mouth partially open look because the pizza looked amazing and when I ordered the stuffed pizza the waiter asked if I wanted Tomato sauce or meat sauce, I found that odd since I had never been asked that before and when the pizza was set down I figured out why. they bring you a bowl of the sauce to put over the pizza instead of having it on the pizza, this was actually very very good.   The service was top notch and the food was obviously great and I not only left satisfied, I left that growth coming out of my forehead at the table, I have now been to Metro Pizza."}
{"text":"Food was good, service not so much. Our party was seated and waited for forty minutes for the complimentary bread- we had to ask for it four times, while other servers were bringing it to their tables with no problem. Our server was openly hostile and I felt afraid to ask him for anything because he would snap at us. When he was taking our orders after we sat for a half hour, he forgot to take one of my friend's order, like, he just skipped her, and it took is another 20 minutes to flag him down. The place wasn't full at all, yet it took nearly an hour and a half for our food. I ordered the sliders and fries, which were served to me cold. Never once did he check on us. He refused to apply the yelp checkin special of A FREE SODA.  When it came time to pay, he wouldn't split our bill, nor would he charge separate amounts on different credit cards. After some managerial intervention, he finally agreed to charge our separate cards, but he overcharged us $40 total. At this point, we were done with him and just decided to argue the additional charges with the credit card company. If you go to Metro, do NOT be seated in this guy's section (skinny dude in his early 20's, spiky blond hair) unless you want to be served by an openly hostile, incompetent server who will ruin your evening.  And this was the story of how a dinner at Metro Pizza was the most ridiculous THREE HOURS of my life."}
{"text":"This is a family hang out., I cant count the times when we went there to make decisions.  Chicago style thin crust. My Fave is the sausage and mushroon extra cheese, enough to take home after. Skip the desert, but after all that Pizza who needs the calories?"}
{"text":"We had a Metro Pizza gift card and wanted to take advantage of it on a lazy Saturday.  I called for a pick up as they had a $15 delivery charge to where we were.  I showed up to pick up the pizza and it was ready.  The girl at the counter was kind and made small talk as the pizza was being brought forward.  She asked if I bought the gift card the day before, on black Friday.  I said I didn't and learned they had a 2 for 1 gift card for their Black Friday special.    Anyhow, I get back with the pizza and it was good.  Just a plain cheese without the bells and whistles.    I gave it 4 stars because it was a bit of a drive for me to pick up a pizza.  And, I can think of a few other pizza joints that I like better."}
{"text":"This is my go-to spot for pizza in Vegas.  It's probably the farthest I ever drive for pizza, but this location is so consistent that it's totally worth it.  Metro has an awesome thin crust, and their pizzas are never greasy.  I love, love, love the sunspot pizza.  It comes with grilled chicken, artichokes, roma tomatoes and garlic.  Just add some mushrooms, and olives, and it's quite possibly my favorite topping combination ever.   If pizza's not your thing, Metro also offers plenty of pasta dishes, tons of appetizers, and some awesome salads."}
{"text":"My favorite new Italian spot.  Great service, great pizza, great pasta,great wings and great side salad with the best homemade Italian dressing I've ever had. Soooo yummy. They have a happy hour called Social hour that is outta this world. Great prices and a great selection. Thank you for making my day. I will be back again and again."}
{"text":"This place used to be the best. Used to be. They used to offer half orders, I was so addicted to their honey cayenne sauce I created my own version at home...but oh no.   Now their salads are like fifteen bucks. For some noodles? ON top of lettuce with a chicken finger? No thanks.   The pizzas are good too...if you like to spend that much on pizza. And I dont mind sometimes, when it isn't cold and the servers aren't ass-hats.   I have tried to go back, every time feeling nostalgic for the time when this place was good. I have met the owners, they used to be all about the pizza!  Now it is overpriced, the food does not have the same flavor. The italian sub I drooled for for two weeks and finally got? A HUGE oily disappointment. The sunspot pizza I bragged to out of town company about? Cold, with an undercooked center and sparse toppings.   The service? Last time I watched a table full of servers sit and have lunch with their manager, while we sat two tables away with no refills, food taking over a half an hour to come out after waiting a half an hour to order, and just in general a terrible time. When I told the server about it, she shrugged and get the manager who blew me off. I was presented with a check and I paid it, vowing never to return and feeling bent over and....well, ripped off I guess would be the point here.   I would have recommended this place in 1999... hell I wished I had money to invest in the idea when I first tried it. But now...now how you have strayed!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered a large w/ extra cheese, meatball and mushrooms the other day.  As I was eating this I asked my wife \"Why is this pizza so friggin awesome?  We've ordered from here a few times and its never been this good.\".  Wife's answer \"You always ordered the cheeseless pizza..I always thought this place was great.\"  Moral of the story blah blah.  You can't go wrong with any pizza here...except for maybe the cheeseless one which is called La Costa or something."}
{"text":"I used to be an advocate for how great their food is. Probably why I was so excited to learn they now deliver. After an hour of waiting for our food (1 hour and 20 minutes to be exact) and calling to get a status, our food arrived cold, soggy and worse than a frozen pizza that was leftover and reheated. Unfortunately we will not be ordering from them again, take out, dine in or delivery."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place by a friend while back and it was delicious. Came back a couple weeks ago to try a different pizza and some fries. The pizza was ok the crust was definitely on the crunchy side. But the fries...the fries were amazing they were crunchy on the out side and soft and warm on the inside. Best fries I have tried!  The server was a real nice guy too bad I don't remember his name. The employees there were attentive and took the yelp deal without hesitation."}
{"text":"This place is RIDICULOUS! As soon as our food arrived the flies kept coming onto our pizza! The manager walked by to check on us and after us telling him there were flies all over the table, he looked at us as if it was our fault! Disgusting!"}
{"text":"In my honest opinion you are better off driving the extra miles to the one in Henderson. I ordered garlic knots TWICE and they completely forgot. My husbands calzone was barely even half full.. talk about a dough ball. The food came out pretty fast and that's the only reason they got two stars."}
{"text":"Very rude and nasty little cashier/hostess named \"Brit\"; also subpar pizza  OK, so I'm a fan of the Ellis Island location. so I figured why not try out this location as well.  I love the buy one get one large pizza deal they have at Ellis (Sundays) so I confirmed with the person taking the order on the phone that yes, they have the same deal as Ellis Island buy one get one.  So, I arrive and go into the takeout entrance to pick up the pizza.  When I go to pay, \"Brit\" tells me the total is $31 and some change.  I said, \"hold on, you told me it was buy one get one when I ordered on the phone so total should be around $21\".   She starts to argue with me and says, \"I never told you that, our deal is buy 1 get one half-off\".  So I said, \"I would have never ordered if that was the case because you said it was the same deal as Ellis buy one get one\".   We go back and forth a few times.  Obviously, she doesn't know what buy one get one means.  Then, I couldn't believe this, Brit, snatches the pizza boxes off the counter and acts like she is gonna put them away back in the kitchen.  With major attitude, she snaps, \"Well do you want them or not\"!?  I should have asked for a manager by now, but instead pay the $31 cause I'm starving and figure I'll speak with manager from home.  The 2 large pizzas were not up to normal standards for Metro. Just soggy, salty, and just plain sad. Nasty!!   So I call back 2x and am put on hold for almost 10 minutes, then she says our manager will call you back in a little while. Ok fine.  Receive call back from manager Jen who was actually helpful and apologetic. I explained the situation and told her that if an employee of mine acted like Brit, she should be fired on the spot.  So I got a $10 credit for my next trip.  But don't think I'll ever return.  Best off that I stick with Ellis Island Metro Pizza."}
{"text":"Just like united breaks guitars, metro ruins your night. Awful service, nasty managers, if you do want a pizza order to go!!! I hate this place."}
{"text":"I agree with Insider Pages, the staff is super rude for either dine-in or to-go, I guess I am not pretty enough or the right color. Beware of cashier 19.  The manager is controlled by the staff. In this economy with those prices and that attitude: NO THANK YOU! Never again.  Try DaVinci Pizza down the road, the owner takes pride in his pizza and the taste is almost as good for half the price."}
{"text":"The biggest tiff i have with this place is they have so many people working and the service is so slow.   Showed up at 8 and our server has the largest party. No clue why they didn't sit us elsewhere so we could be served faster. 8:20 and we finally got our order in because he was busy taking phone orders in the icecream area.   Hopefully the food comes out hot!  FAIL! Meatballs came out cold.  Side salad was full of non green lettuce.  Needless to say I'm not rushing back.   Hopefully they start reading reviews because they won't be getting their Best In Vegas anytime soon."}
{"text":"Ordered the lunch special-Meatball Parm sub with fries and a drink.  The food was pretty good and the service was good.  There's red & white tablecloths everywhere.  Looks kind of old inside but overall everything was good."}
{"text":"Service is excellent. Delivery is great.  If you're ordering pizza for your office or clients this place gets it done.  Pizza is also excellent."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town I've been going there 12 years close to the strip and UNLV. The best time is between 2:30-500 pm mon-thurs dine in pizza is half price. Can't beat that deal!  It's clean lots of parking and the staff is great."}
{"text":"I love the pizza and on Thursday's it's 2-1 which is a  great deal. There's no seats but you can eat your pizza at different places in the casino. It's always been clean and the people nice.  I always order the Gotham"}
{"text":"Very good pizza. Good ranch too, I like to dip my pizza in ranch. But the service when we went was painfully slow. Not the waiters fault, seemed like the kitchen's. A family of 5 came in maybe 5 minutes after us and got their food first. It was just me and my mom there and it took 45 minutes for us to get our pizza. : / will probably get it to-go next time due to this or just go to Rosatis as it's also close to home. Either way."}
{"text":"Yum- its fresh ingredients, great crust and an old style oven. My favorite is their  stuffed pizza- I get a skyline. Crust on the bottom, filling and cheese in the middle with another crust in top. Add meat or marinara sauce to the top crust, right before eating."}
{"text":"Great pizza inside a smokey run down casino.  If you don't mind keeping your hand on your wallet in that area the pizza is great."}
{"text":"We tried Metro and then took our car club there.  Food is delicious and the servers are always great.  It takes a little time, but everything is so fresh!!!"}
{"text":"In the takeout area I never thought anyone would be able to replace Katie. I now have only two words ....Bella and Megan. .....Please give these girls a raise and keep them around. Better yet ... keep them and hire Katie back"}
{"text":"Very delicious thin crust pizza! Went to this location on the recommendation of a Las Vegas local and was not disappointed. Had a basic pepperoni & mushroom thin crust pie and we wanted to bring as much leftovers home just to savor the taste even longer! One of the best thin crust pizzas I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Great pizza. Good beer.  Paul, the manager is the best. He always takes care of his patrons."}
{"text":"This is a real good pizza joint!  It is a large restaurant with plenty of room.  They had a bar area to sit at, too.  They have regular crust, deep dish and thin crust... I like that something for everyone!   I guess they are known for their deep dish, but we tried their regular crust.  We ordered the meatball and garlic.  Also ordered a pitcher of beer.  The pizza was good.  I ain't gonna lie - those were tasty meatballs! The cheese tasted like quality stuff.  The crust was tasty and it had a nice crunch to it - easy to fold.  The pizza wasn't amazing or anything it was just overall a GOOD pizza!!!    The service was excellent.  Definitely a good pizza joint."}
{"text":"This place is pretty close to a five star rating, oh well heck - I just changed it to 5 stars.  The northwest needed a nonchain and nongaming restaurant like this.  The place is very roomy and open inside.  It has a welcome family feeling to the atmosphere here.  I have been there twice and the service has been good.  Also, they have specials everyday.  They had a special for the Rebel game, and in this town that has little support for the basketball program, this deserves a high five!  The garlic knots were really good.  The bread they bring out to the table tastes great too, I would buy a loaf to take home.  This time we ordered a spring street pizza with regular crust.  Meatballs, ricotta, red peppers, green peppers and topped with fresh basil.  The basil was a nice touch because the aroma gets the taste buds going right away.  The sauce is tasty - not too sweet but a nice fresh tomato taste.  The crust on their regular pizza is somewhat thin but still holds up well to the heap of toppings.  The crust had a nice crunch to it too.  They have a thick crust option and stuffed pizzas too.  The prices are reasonable especially if you consider one pie could fill up 3-4 regular eaters.  I was stuffed on 2 pieces.  This place just does what a restaurant is supposed to do: good service, they take pride in their food offerings, clean and welcoming atmosphere and fair prices.  It makes it obvious why some places are busy and some places close down..."}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza and nice people running the place.  We ordered a meat lovers pizza and a white pizza with chicken/spinach.  Both were tasty and plenty of toppings.   The place is not cheap, 25 and 27 for each pie but we did not feel cheated.  The pizza was good quality and the service was adequate.    The property is a bit dated and feels a bit cramped.  It did not help that they have a charity event going on and there were thousands of bottles of water stacked up everywhere.   If you looking for a tasty pizza pie this place is a solid choice."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, garlic knots and salads. Modesto is the best! Couldn't recommend this place more."}
{"text":"Metro Pizza, how do I love you?  Let me count the ways:  great bread, great lunch specials, great service, and GREAT BREAD!  Yes, I could eat their Italian bread with butter all day long and be one happy camper, but I must restrain myself every time I go so that I have room for the salad and pizza lunch special.  I must admit that I lunch almost weekly at Metro and it never gets old.  I was there again today with a friend and as I write this review, I have my leftovers heating up for dinner!  Sure, there are lots of other kinds of elaborate pizzas on the menu, but I stick with mushroom.  I highly recommend the garlic knots and the garlic fries--yu-ummm!  Also, they offer a meatball sub that is the bomb dot com, but I only have that if I've done a long enough training run, bike, or swim first to not feel guilty about the grease and calories.  And, there is a gelato bar, but again, I've only done that a couple of times because I'm so freakin' full from the bread! Metro Pizza has been named the best pizza place in Nevada by at least one national newspaper and I concur!  Check it out if you haven't been and see if you don't love the bread like I do!  Ciao!"}
{"text":"Okay so first of all I am not a avid yelper. I only will post if something is extremely terrible. Now my husband and I have been coming to this metro for years and his parents before that. The food in fantastic and always so fresh. I don't live very far from here so I decided to order delivery one night. The food was on time and perfect. Later on that night I went to check my email and found out I was over charged (I get email alerts through my bank), I checked my bank and almost fainted. My bill was about $24, which I was charged and saw on my account, with an additional $236 (separately charged). They charged me twice. I called and spoke with the manager that was on for the night, he proceeded to tell me that they did not charge me twice and he doesn't know what happened. Well I know for sure the bank doesn't automatically charge you on their own. The staff must have charge me twice, the manager didn't believe that was the case. First of all, as a manager you should be reassuring your client, take some responsibility and learn how to do your job. You CANT tell me you don't know what happened . That is a joke!!! He called the owners and they said the charge was going to drop the same night and that it wasn't going to get charged. And then gave me a $25 credit for next time. Credit or no credit, it's not the point. Whoever ran my credit card, ran it twice and they couldn't take any responsibly for it, THEY JUST DONT KNOW!!!! Apparently, they just don't know what they are doing. So good food, but if you ever order delivery, be aware. And check your bank afterwards."}
{"text":"I came to Metro Pizza on the recommendation of a friend who lives in Las Vegas.  This place is good.  The service was fast and the prices were reasonable.  My daughter and I split a Honolulu Pizza.  My wife ordered Eggplant Parm.  The food was served promptly, and even though we were seated in the back of the restaurant, we were not ignored.  The next time I'm in Vegas, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Just visited the Henderson store at 8:06 p.m. to grab a few gelato's. The \"to go\" area of the store was empty of customers and they were putting the tins of gelato on a silver rolling cart behind the counter. I asked if it was still for sale and I was told \"No, it's closed\". What kind of customer service is that for a Saturday night at six past eight in the evening? Is there a time frame for getting gelato like there is for a fast food breakfast menu? Was it too hard for one of your employees to turn to the cart and scoop up a few orders? Nope, just a \"it's closed\". Very bad customer service. It was 8:06 P.M.! Golden Spoon, one block away, was happy to see us and take our money. This location has gone down hill so bad since it first opened. Never again. I won't even start on the time it takes them to answer the phone for takeout. You will always be put on hold........forever."}
{"text":"Great pizza, got to try the Metro. Thick crust and extra cheese, must weight 10lbs. Great salads also. Would not go anywhere else for pizza."}
{"text":"Went in this past Wednesday night for a birthday party.  We had a large group and were sat at 1 long table which was nice that they could accommodate us together like that.  We had several different pizzas along with some salads and for the most part everything was really good (especially the salads and the Buffalo Chicken Pizza - delicious).  The main reason for my review is the level of service our big group was provided.  I apologize that I did not get the servers name but he was a young man, tall and thin.  He was attentive, polite and courteous.  Having a group as big as ours (I think we were around 15 or 16 people) can be a challenge but he took very good care of us.  We would definitely go back for the combination of great pizza and outstanding service."}
{"text":"Mediocre experience, only a few points that really stuck with me.   The only time I came was with a huge party of over 30, so my review might be biased. Service was sort of slow and the food was alright. The salads are fresh though, and the BBQ chicken pizza was great, but I was also starving from the wait.   Portions are huge and the drinks are mid-priced with a decent selection. With the wide selection of other restaurants in the area I probably won't be back here anytime soon."}
{"text":"Warm french bread and NY style pizza was excellent. A little disappointed with the way they handled my Entertainment Book coupon. The waitress assured us that the coupon will work fine, and at the end she said her manager wasn't able to approve the coupon (which coincidentally happened to be around closing time). We ended up spending $20 more than we anticipated. As a frugal blogger, this leaves a horrible taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"I would first like to start off by saying, before I even ordered my food I was disappointed with this place. I have never been to a pizzeria in my life that did not serve single slices, I had to order an entire small pizza with my order. Usually I grab a slice to start off then will grab a main dish. I decided okay, if they only offer the pizza by the pie it must be pretty decent, it was just okay. Wasn't bad wasn't great. Definetly not the best slice I've ever had and I'm sure not the worst. I also ordered meatball sliders, they also were just okay. Nothing about this place was either great or bad. I would have given 3 stars if I was able to get a single slice and save myself the $9 dollars I had to spend on a small pizza. Customer service was pretty good but you don't go to a pizzeria for customer service. May or may not come back, maybe if I were really craving pizza and nearby."}
{"text":"What a joke!  An absolute sh*tshow on a Friday (4/13) night (when lots of people eat pizza).  There were more employees than there were customers...I ordered three pizzas for carryout, was told it would be 35 minutes...that turned out to be 35 minutes after I arrived 40 minutes after I ordered (for a total of 75 minutes if you are following along).  It was clear there was chaos as every diner in the place had empty plates and were looking for help and service, but it was no where to be found.  When I asked to speak to a manager, I was informed he was busy making pizza.  What are the other 18 employees doing?  Oh that's right, they are all on their phones.  After happily collecting my money, 20 mins later the girl came to me and said, \"well, where should I start?\"  She informed me the kitchen had screwed up my pizza but there were making a new one...fine.  Minutes later, my order arrives and I'm handed my pizzas that have been sitting off to the side the whole time.  $70 for three cold, nasty pizzas.  The leadership and execution of this restaurant is abysmal..."}
{"text":"We have come back a few time since and the experience wasn't so great. The wait staff didn't really seem to care and the pizza was cold in the center on multiple occasions. We used to enjoy coming here but we haven't had a reason to go back in a while after a few bad experiences. When done right the food is great. But if you are missing ingredient just don't add vegetable as a filler... Or know what your pizza are actually supposed to have... :-/"}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years. Excellent pizza and great house-made salad dressing.   This time we dined here we ordered the Four Corners Pizza $23. It is a pizza topped Eggplant/Ricotta on 2 slices, Sausage/Garlic 2 slices, Ricotta/Spinach/Garlic 2 slices, and Sausage/Peppers/Onions 2 slices. This was an amazing pizza. I had at least a bite of every kind and they were all very good. I really liked the crust too. This pizza was huge!!!  -1 star because our server was horrible. He took our order and then brought the bill that's it. Thankfully his busser was very good and made sure we had everything we needed.   I really like this places pizza. I will definitely continue to go back to Metro Pizza."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for a number of years and this is one of our fav pizza places among several. They start you off with a small loaf of hot bread and butter, We always order the same pizza: The triple play with triple sausage ( we add pepperoni also) is a nice thin crisp crust and cut in squares - the true chicago way. We also had the house salad with there homemade italian, which uriel loves to dip his bread and pizza in. Service is always great"}
{"text":"Have ordered in from here a few times and have watched it slowly decline. Tonight we ordered a large pepperoni meatball and garlic asked for it to be extra crispy... it was so soggy you couldn't hold the slice up to even eat the thing without dropping all the toppings onto the plate. After calling they sent us a new pizza we stressed extra crispy please. Yet again a disappointment. You would think a pizza maker (being an experienced one myself) would know that something as simple as extra crispy means to leave it in the oven just a bit longer... For the price definitely not worth the wait."}
{"text":"I saw a roach run past the table, and there was a hair in my ranch dressing! The waitress was really nice, and the food is fine but I can't get past bugs and hair. I'll be going elsewhere for \"Italian\" food. I suggest you do as well!"}
{"text":"Been coming here forever and the food has been consistent every time.  Great assortment of pizzas to choose from as well as building your own.  My go to is the Gotham which is like a supreme topping pizza.  The half price Monday thought Thursday's 2:30-4:30 is an incredible deal and the portions are great!  One of the best pizzas hands down and that's why I keep coming back for years.  Metro Pizza has great lunch specials as well including my favorite the salad and personal size pizza which is plenty of food!  The fresh bread they bring out is excellent but I don't recommend eating more than one slice in order to save room for pizza.  Love the 80s decor at the flamingo and Decatur location that seems like it has been there forever.  Staff is super friendly and they make you feel at home while dining.  Metro Pizza is hands down one of the best pizza spots in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Simply, the best.    Always an essential stop in Vegas -- especially for the Stockyard, thickest pizza on Planet Earth.  I imagine each slice weighs about one pound.    And you think I'm kidding.  They have thin-crust pizza and many other selections too, including garlic parmesan fries which are sinfully delicious.   Tasty warm bread with butter, the most reasonably priced wine in town, and pitchers of Fat Tire for less than $10.  The owners deserve a medal -- and should open one in L.A. ASAP!  Note:  The folks who wrote weak reviews here must be used to Dominos or one-ounce slices from NYC.  If you prefer real food, just go!"}
{"text":"Started off kinda negative, the hostess acted like she was doing us a favor seating us in a restaurant that was about 1/2 empty. As the night went on, I couldn't help but notice that everyone got the same treatment from her. Well, not everyone, she spent the bulk of her time climbing all aver one of the servers like a mink in heat. She was plenty pleasant to him. I guess the rest of us were a distraction to her.  So where is the manager? Why not make your employees behave? Meanwhile, Our server was fine and the food was above average."}
{"text":"Great pizza.  Love the BBQ chicken calzone.    Service is typically just OK.  But the food is always great."}
{"text":"This place sucks! The pizza is a horrible and it all starts with the sauce. The sauce tastes like stoffers frozen TV dinner sauce. The cheese tasted like rubber it's truly amazing to me that anyone actually wrote a good review for this place . The garlic knots tasted like cinder blocks with a dash of Parmesan . I will never eat at this place again. I wanted to throw up the food after I was done with my slice. It should be called metro sh!t pizza"}
{"text":"Being from the Chicago area, and visiting friends from Chicago who now live in Vegas, they decided to treat us to the best pizza in Vegas. Well, best pizza west of Illinois, really.  Had a nice thin crust cheese, with a good salty sauce. Also split a  Stockyard stuffed pizza. Metro's stuffed is more of a New York style stuffed, like a big calzone with meat sauce on top. It was really good, and a small had 4 slices, which was plenty for the 4 of us.  I'll go back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"It was during the MAGIC Fashion Show I was first introduced to Metro Pizza.  My party was staying at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and was looking for something easy to pick up or delivery. I was charged with providing lunch, so I looked around the hotel-- to no surprise, many things in the hotel for was overpriced and of poor quality. In the search for help I went to Concierge service desk. After speaking with a Concierge, he recommended Metro Pizza for delivery. All I needed to hear was that Metro Pizza was featured on FoodNetwork as Vegas' top pizza place. I got their number and dialed away.   After half an hour post-order, the Pizza arrived at my suite on the 63rd floor of Mandalay Bay (some how the delivery man by-passed all the security). They told me that it would be forty five minutes to an hour, because of the heavy demand for pizza and traffic congestion that day, but I was glad they came earlier than planned.   I ordered two pans of pizza, both large size, one cheese and one combination. Both were terrific! The price may be somewhat steep, but for a delivery place outside of the hotel to deliver to your room and be the quality that it was is exceptional. (The pizza satisfied many palates that were present: Koreans from Korea, native New Yorkers, vegetarians from Florida, and picky eaters from California).  The pizza itself was different from those other pizza spots. The crust was crisp, but not difficult, the correct temperature for the cheese so it doesn't look like gruyere over french onion soup, and the more than generous portion for toppings that were very tasty.  I will definitely order from this place again in the future!"}
{"text":"Our favorite neighborhood pizza place!! Everything we have ever ordered is amazing, the ranch is spectacular, the menu has great variety, and they deliver!"}
{"text":"My second Metro Pizza experience for my own Bachelorette Party weekend was much much better.  I believe it was due to the selection of pizza my bridesmaid ordered.  We ordered hawaiian, meat combination, cheese, veggie, and something else. The pizza was great, and I was very happy with the crust and ingrediants."}
{"text":"This place seems to be going downhill.    The last time I came, the entrance on the right was closed an signage pointed you towards the left side to the take-out entrance.  Last night the regular door was open.  Make up your mind, Metro Pizza!! Gawsh.     Went last night 7-28-15 around 6:30. The Mexican waiter who barely spoke English really added to the \"authentic Italian\" mood in the restaurant.  It took 8 minutes after we were seated to finally be acknowledged and another 7 minutes before anyone took our drink order.  I almost left.    One of my favorite things in the world is their Caesar salad.  I had been raving all day about it to my mother-in-law.  We ordered two caesar salads and were brought regular salads with caesar dressing on the side. This really grinds my gears.  I was lookin' forward to that all day.    The pizza was amazing as always...I just love their pizza.  The crust is crunchy on the bottom and gooey on top.    I checked in on Yelp and an offer for 1 free non-alcoholic beverage popped up.  Had no trouble redeeming it.  On their specials calendar yesterday was an offer for a \"free canoli with purchase of any meal\".  It was not offered to us and I didn't ask about it."}
{"text":"Went Saturday 7-4-15 around 5:45 pm. They were running a 4th of July special of 1/2 off pizza for military! Our server Jenn was so nice and attentive and I ate the best caesar salad I've ever had there. My go-to pizza is the gotham. This time I tried the fried mozarella....it was pretty tasty."}
{"text":"Talk about a place that makes you feel like home! Metro pizza takes the pie when it comes to enjoying a night out/in! Cameron is our favorite and that tiramisu is a close second! We always will come back!"}
{"text":"Food is good but customer service is never great. It's like they forget about you. It's almost like they forget about their tables."}
{"text":"Worst service ever.  Just getting seated is a pain.  We had a party of 7 and there were two tables right next to each other and they wouldn't push them together so that we could have a table where we could all sit together.  The hostess seemed like if she had a clue she could be dangerous.   The pizza is only mediocre but the service is the worst."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch on Labor Day 9/5/16 before heading back to California. Pizza was ok. Nothing special.   Had a large half Hawaiian luao and half bbq chicken... Bbq chicken had the tiniest burned sprinkle of cilantro... Might as well not have put it at all because it was nonexistent in flavor and texture. Hawaiian was soggy at the end pieces. Dough was good though.  Our garlic knots were burned the first time around so they comped us the second time.   We were supposed to get a coupon for a free small cheese pizza cause that was the Labor Day special, but we never received it. Even though I asked for it... and I didn't think about it till after we were on the interstate.  Would maybe come back here if there was a special but highly doubt it especially when there's a million pizza places in Vegas."}
{"text":"First time here and not sure I will return.  No host , counted 13 people in the Resturant why I waited for 15 min for server to come to my table.  Server seemed nice but overworked.  Food was delicious.  Work on service and staffing seems to be some issues."}
{"text":"It's always nice to know that you can buy greasy overpriced pizza at the airport. I mean really.....your options are either - \"pay up\" or eat air......  On my way home today, I decided to pick up something small to \"gnaw\" on, since I skipped out on lunch.  While I waiting at the McCarran airport  terminal #3 - \"D gate\", I see a place called - Metro Pizza nearby, so I wandered overthere to get a slice of veggie pizza for $6.37.  What you get for $6.37 is pretty bad pizza!   IMHO it tasted worst than frozen Tombstone pizza. The slice was pretty oily, and the crust was very hard like cardboard! Yuck!  Save your money, and eat air instead, or wait till you get on board your flight to have something to eat.  Believe me, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I never post negative reviews because I often think many yelp reviews are petty and retaliatory.   Plus I think it's more important to point out the good in this world.     Someone said Metro is NY style pizza.  Tastes like salty soggy cardboard with cheese flavored plastic, topped with melted Vaseline."}

{"text":"2 for 1 Thursday is where it's at for this off the strip place.  It's actually inside a casino so you may not know it's there if you don't know where to look.  For some reason the line seemed to take a while despite how few people were in front of me.  However, of the three pizza by the slice places I tried while in town I found the pizza here to be the best tasting and the best deal.  Even when there isn't a 2 for 1, it's only $3.50 a slice (as compared to $6-8 for places on the strip).  FYI - Credit card minimum is $5."}
{"text":"Well I am sort of a pizza person I really love to try local pizza places rather than the regular chain places. I had tried Metro pizza at work one day and it was great then, so a friend and I went to this location and it was really nice and the atmosphere was really fun kind of like an older diner setting. It was nice and the staff was really friendly and knowledgable of the food selection and was very tentative to drinks needing refilled and always checked on our table make sure we were satisfied, the pizzas are good and the their crust is soft, not like the kind you sometimes get the and crust is tough and hard, and its not even thin crust. I would like to go to their other locations around town and see how the other rank, I will definitely come here again and recommend others to come and try them out!"}
{"text":"This place makes great pizza and the pizza sauce is very nice.  They give you free fresh baked white bread, when it is not burnt or dryed out. The ravioli is huge enough to share for the whole table.  Garlic Fries are delicious too."}
{"text":"After a night of drinking and karaoke at Ellis, I was starved and saw this pizza joint. I do have to say the food was good but I was a little tipsy when I had it. I would have to give it another shot sober to see how it really tasted.   I do have one recommendation, and that is to put extra, cold shredded mozzarella cheese on top of the warm pizza. It is the most fantastic thing. I remember having it just like it when I was in college and it is the best. If you don't believe me try it and you will be hooked.   The price was not too expensive and the extra cheese only cost 50 cents extra, which in my mind was well worth it. I will try it again sometime and maybe I will be sober next time I try it again, but I offer no guarantee. I will, however, guaranteed there will be some extra cold cheese on my next pizza."}
{"text":"My Mom went out with the family for Pizza at Metro Friday Night and they all had the pizza  which looked great and they all loved  Mom had the Italian salad (she loves italian salads.)  and said it was great.. Pat had Garlic knots meatball sliders, she loved them. They Will go out of the way to drive over to Trop for this  pizza place. Had been to the Metro on Horizon Ridge but it was not as good as this one ."}
{"text":"I read mixed reviews for this place but ultimately, after all the pizza I've eaten in my life, I'm going to say this place is actually pretty darn good. We tried The Original which is a stuffed pizza with cheese, rigatoni, sauce, and more cheese and whatever else you want to put in it. The crust is also very yummy...We added meatballs to half and loved it. The small size was only $12.50 and we had that for dinner and lunch the next day.   The garlic fries were pathetic. I can sprinkle my own Kraft parmesean on mediocre fries at home and they would have been better.   Overall, we thought it was good. And we will go back."}
{"text":"No. Just no. The pizza isn't even as good as a standard Pizza Hut- I take clients to lunch locally and they always say \"Anything is fine EXCEPT METRO PIZZA\" so sad because I love supporting local but the restaurant is dirty and the food isn't even palatable"}
{"text":"Place is great and service is generally very good. Wish they had larger tv at the bar."}
{"text":"This place was definitely one the best parts of Las Vegas for me.  Fat.Girl.Carb.Heaven with the bread they serve while you are waiting for your main entrees.  Its steaming hot right out of the oven. The sesame crust was super crunchy and the inside was so soft and completely melted the butter within one second of putting it on.  With 7 people ordering 7 small pizzas, we got to try so many different, super tasty varieties.  The shrimp pizza was my absolute favorite.  We also tried a chicken, basil and tomato pizza that initially came with artichoke hearts which we substituted for spinach.  All of the pizza I tried really were so awesome. We each ended up with about 6 different slices of all different kinds and it was way cool.  We had about 2 full pizzas left over after. That happens when a bunch of still half drunk hungry cows are let loose with junk food.  I definitely see why my friends insisted we not leave without coming here. They know my fat tendencies. (:"}
{"text":"There is nothing negative to say about Metro Pizza. This is seriously one of the best pizza joint in Vegas and deserves 5 stars...I'd give them 10 if I could!   The owners, Sam and John, are in the restaurant frequently checking on the quailty of the food and saying hi to their customers. They remember your name and hug your babies :) My Italian side smiles at this true \"family\" style restaurant.  The food has wonderful flavors. From their plethora of pizza choices, to their meatball sliders (my fav!), to their pasta dishes (to-die-for mac 'n cheese)...there is something for the pickiest eater to the adventurous food critic. I highly suggest trying their garlic knots for an appetizer or even their garlic romano fries (with the homemade ranch of course! It's so good I could drink it) and not passing up dessert. You can't go wrong with the vast gellato selection or their monthly shake concoction.  Make sure to check out their monthly calendar online to see what that day at Metro holds. Don't miss out on the many discounts they offer! My daughter loves the \"Kids Make It, We Bake It\" days...she gets to make her own pizza like the pros! Mommy really loves their homemade white sangria ;) hehe. Also, check out their offer on Yelp right now....a free soft drink with your entree purchase.   Don't pass up this Vegas staple, there's one on almost every side of the valley and it will not disappoint!"}
{"text":"I went here either a group and got to try two different pizzas and a sale. I absolutely looooooved the salad.   The pizza's we got were okay. I'm really not a huge fan of pan pizza type crust or thicker crusts, and their regular slice was almost triple the thickness that I could handle. I did enjoy the fresh toppings, and their bread they offer prior to the meal is absolutely delicious!!   I'd like to come back and try a thinner crust pizza next time."}
{"text":"Metro Pizza has always had great food and great staff, and tonight's dinner was no different!  Make sure to check out the monthly calendar specials every time you come in...Tonight was \"Free Nuke Fries Night\" - And they were delicious!!!  I also recommend asking for the bottled, homemade Italian dressing as a dipping sauce for the bread you're given at the beginning of the meal.  And of course the pizza, ranch dressing, (and Nuke Fries!) are a must-have!  One of the better pizza restaurants in town."}
{"text":"Horrible Service is the Norm here.   If you want bad pizza and Terrible service this is your place, the calzones are full of air and nothing else , the pizza was once good is now crap. The workers there seem very disinterested in their jobs and need a some customer service training. one was even asking customers if they knew of other places that were hiring. so if you wanna overpay for a bad experience this place will not disappoint you."}
{"text":"great za.  beats room service.  the good: artichoke za thin za style menu online  not so good: did not love the stuffed, kind of heavy wings and fries soggy, cold took 30 min longer to deliver than they said  bet on black 7!"}
{"text":"I mean it's not really 5 stars, we got it after EDC day three and it was simply just good pizza for recovery :) courteous staff stayed late so we could eat!"}
{"text":"Another Metro Pizza location, and another great pizza dinner!  I began with a very good bowl of old-fashioned Minestrone Soup with shredded Mozzarella Cheese that was chockfull of green beans, okra, broccoli, carrots, peas, Lima Beans, Kidney Beans, celery, cauliflower, White Onions, potatoes, and rigatoni.  That's a mouthful of ingredients, and each mouthful was packed with vegetable goodness.  A Small Dinner Salad was also a nice preliminary course, with Iceberg Lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, onion, pepperoncini, croutons, and zesty housemade red-tinged Italian Dressing.  I tried to avoid the excellent crusty Pizza Dough and butter that was set before my party, but only had enough willpower to stop after downing four sumptuous butter-slathered slices.  I ordered a large pizza with four toppings: pepperoni, cooked tomatoes, mushrooms, and sausage.  My New York style pizza was bubbling and smoking hot when it arrived, with the cheese perfectly melted on top, and the dough suitably supple for slices to be easily lifted by hand and guided to a welcoming mouth.  The pepperoni and sausage were both on the mild side but with just a little kick.  It was excellent saucy pizza.  Diane's large Ham Pizza with extra cheese was also naturally cheesy and delicious.  Surprisingly, even with everything else I had to eat, I devoured all but three slices of my pizza at the restaurant--which left less leftovers to look forward to for lunch the next day.  When that time came, the slices heated up well in the oven, and tasted just as good as when my pizza was originally served.  Service was good, except I was initially erroneously charged for a lemonade that I was never served.  I was merely adding my own flavor drops to water.  The mistake was quickly and amiably rectified.   4-1/2 stars overall on this pizza quest!"}
{"text":"It had been several months since I visited Metro Pizza, and the first time I was prepared to review it.  I hoped it was as good as my previous visits.  In the most important respect--food--it was.  But in other ways the structure and operations need some overhaul.  First off, the front door was broken.  It was easy to know this since two hand-drawn signs on white pasteboard announced this on the broken door.  It would be far better to just fix it and take off the signs!  The restaurant looked nice from a distance all decked out for Christmas, including a lighted tree.  But our table in the auxiliary room was so wobbly that I had to keep my foot on the base to keep all steady--at which point I noticed massive chips of paint missing on the concrete floor that long ago had been painted red.  It is time for another coat!  Complimentary bread and pats of butter were an excellent combination.  The bread looked Italian but tasted like doughy sourdough.  Very nice--although with all the food to come it surely was not needed!   I ordered Minestrone Soup but a dinner salad arrived first.  Our server had warned me that the soup took more time so would come after the salad.  But I didn't quite understand the meaning of this.  I thought serving the soup would be merely dipping in the ladle and pouring it into a waiting bowl.  Not here!  The dinner salad, which comes with some dishes and can be ordered separately with others, was very good, graced by Metro Pizza's house dressing, a homemade spicy tomato-based Italian dressing good enough to be sold in unlabeled plastic containers and bought for a trip home by my Italian-American friends after we finished our dinner.  I almost bought a bottle myself but opted for frozen Dark Chocolate Gelato instead.  The salad itself consisted of fresh and chilled mixed greens, cucumbers, tomato, red onion, and carrot shavings.  Very tasty!  But the surprise hit of the evening for me was the Minestrone Soup that I thought had been forgotten 10 minutes after I had finished my salad and there was still no sign of the soup.  Just as I was about to hail my waiter, he came to our table hoisting a lovely large bowl of steaming soup chockfull of ingredients.  It had cut carrots, cauliflower florets, lima beans, garbanzo beans, kidney beans, Italian green beans, cut Rigatoni, sprinklings of fresh basil, gooey melted Mozzarella Cheese, and a few croutons that quickly dissolved in the spicy tomato-based broth.  The whole conglomeration was very hot, clearly made largely from scratch--not just sitting idle in a pot--and quite delicious.  It was a highlight of the meal, and would have been THE highlight if the pizza and pasta to come had not been so darned good, too  After years of regularly eating complete 15\" pizzas about once a week through my thirties, now to keep cholesterol under some control I limit myself to eat a whole pizza just once every two months.  Seriously, even though pizza has long been one of my favorite foods!  I certainly cheat with a slice here and there in the interim, but not with a whole pie.  In college I once won a fraternity pizza eating contest (1 hot slice consumed in 15 seconds), and even now am quite capable of devouring a whole medium pie in one sitting.  So, you can imagine that I am choosy about where I will eat pizza.  I can't afford to draw a charred clunker when I just have six pizzas a year.  I will try new places but they have to be highly recommended by persons whose judgment in food I trust--like Yelp friends.  For that reason, I will be trying the pizza at the not so secret and not so unknown place at the Cosmopolitan soon.  But in the meantime,  Metro Pizza is on my short list, along with Biaggio's.  And, the large slice of Ham Pizza with extra cheese that I snatched from my wife's pizza (with forewarning) was in fine form:   cheesy, saucy, and with tasty mild ham resting on perfectly cooked dough with a totally uncharred bottom and a nicely browned crust.  When my pasta arrived, it, too, looked lovely with sauteed fresh mushrooms spread over the saucy sauce.  It also looked huge--enough for two or three diners easy.  But, dig as I might with the large spoon provided, the dish was sans meatballs.  I found my server to remedy this significant oversight, and he quickly brought two cooked meatballs to the table that were bathed in Marinara Sauce.  This gave me an opportunity to sample the Marinara Sauce, and it was just as I like it best: hot, saucy, and very mild.  The authentic Italian meatballs, which only come as a pair, were also very good: dense, heat hot, and very tasty.  I flipped one onto my overflowing mound of Spaghetti & Meat Sauce with Mushrooms, and ate as much as I could.  The Spaghetti was nicely cooked, and the Meat Sauce tasted like a fine Bolognese.  For once I was happy to be taking home what felt like 3 pounds of leftovers for I don't know how many successive lunches."}
{"text":"This time around, despite knowing that ample stomach room was needed to address a large pizza to come, fresh Pizza Dough Bread slathered with butter just could not be completely resisted.  At least I limited myself to just 2 slices!  A bean-studded Small Minestrone Soup differed somewhat in ingredients from previous versions but was still packed with fresh mixed vegetables & pasta.  And a Small Dinner Salad graced with Metro Pizza's own formula for a zesty, tomato-based Italian Dressing was another great starter, along with a cheesy Mozzarella Stick.  But, as usual, top-notch saucy and cheesy New York style pizzas were justifiably placed squarely in the spotlight.  A Large Ham Pizza with Extra Cheese greatly pleased Diane; a Small New York Pepperoni Pizza satisfied my two dining companion friends; and I was quite happy with my order of a Large The Gotham Pizza with added cooked sliced Tomatoes, which was already studded with a whopping six included toppings: Pepperoni, Mushrooms, Sausage, crunchy Green Peppers, Ground Beef, and Onions, and featured a perfectly executed supple crust.  If I were to order this pizza again, I would have reduced or eliminated the Onions, which were just more dominant than I prefer.  But this is more of a quibble than any real complaint.  Seating at two joined tables was comfortable; the casual Italian ambiance authentic for a pizza parlor; and waitstaff service swift, accurate, and commendable.          Another five-star-level pizza eating outing at this Metro Pizza location!"}
{"text":"After the epic fail at Project Pie in the MGM, handy dandy Yelp suggested this spot. Bonus points for being super close to the airport since I had to drop off my rental. As we entered we were immediately seated. The servers there were super sweet and accommodating. They recommended we start with the garlic knots and also to go with the stuffed pizzas. We decided to go with the Skyline which comes with pepperoni, sausage, onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, and black olives. When we received our order it was ahhhmaaazziinngg. Though we ordered the smallest sizes available, we still had tons of food to take on the flight with us. If you are looking for great food for a reasonable  price then definitely make your way off the strip and get to Metro Pizza."}
{"text":"For starters, the complimentary fresh baked sourdough loaf bread and butter basket is a nice treat!  Mmmmmm yummy I love Metro Pizza. The Decatur and Flamingo location is cozy and fun always a nice experience!  The Service is Fantastic every time I have dined here and I am unsure why I am now just submitting my review for this Awesome pizza and Pasta place?  Mmmmm yum what we ordered this time around was a Sicilian sub, spicy shrimp pasta and baked ziti.  The jam packed Sicilian sub was great and set on home hearth baked bread it just melts in your mouth!  The baked ziti loaded up with sauce, mozzarella and ricotta cheese it was the best!  The portions are very generous as you are guaranteed to be leaving with leftovers for another meal!  I have always had their pizza in the past which is very good however this is the first time I ordered a pasta dinner and am so happy I did!!!  The Spicy shrimp pasta was divine, the sauce spicy and so flavorful the perfect mix of goodness! The big shrimp mixed in as well was very good and all tied in with angel hair pasta. Soooo good and my boyfriend loved it as well because we shared both of our dishes.  We even saved $12 bucks off of our meal with an Entertainment book buy one dinner entree get one free. That is insane considering what the portion of the pasta dinners are!  The service is always Stellar!!!  See posted pics! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"*****2011 Entertainment book...$10 bucks off of your bill coupon, plus buy one get one free lunch and or dinner entree coupons***** Save money baby!   Tasty Pizza I must admit. Pizza has always been one of those hmmmm how shall I say \"gets me saucy\" as is one of my favorite foods of all time. I liked the sourdough bread they serve pre-meal. I love restaurants that provide bread, Nummy! I have been to two locations, the one on Tropicana and the one on Decatur. I am ready to be in all of my pizza glory again soon! Mmmmm Nummy!"}
{"text":"I get lunch here at least once a week - love their pizza! Restaurant is always packed but I am always acknowledged and helped right away. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Seriously anyone who wrote a good review for this place must either work there or has a relative that does.  I've tried this place 3 times now and it's nasty.  Today I tried it again because I read the reviews and thought maybe I was mistaken and my daughter and I waited an hour for nasty pizza (however the bread they served beforehand was good) and our waitress was AWFUL!!!  We went to the one on Horizon Ridge.  Really, people need to start telling the truth about this place, I'm shocked at the reviews."}
{"text":"Maybe we hit them at a bad time, but I was unimpressed.  The server for our section actually only came to our table once, and they weren't that busy.  The poor girl who seated us had to take our order and bring our check and another guy dropped off our pizza. Odd.  Pizza had a limp crust and all of the toppings literally slid off the slice when you picked it up.  So weird.  Not to mention the fact that this place looks like it popped out of a 1990 time machine. Think of the restaurant that the kids from Saved By The Bell used to hang out in.  That's this place!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! Yummy, Yummy, YUMMY! Totally worth it and our waitress was so cute and fun! She got a big tip from us. Garlic knots and meatball sliders are AMAZING. Totally worth the carbs. They are great as leftovers as well. Very reasonably priced as well. I recommend this place 100% of the time."}
{"text":"Awesome pizza here. We had the stuffed crust pizza half pepperoni  half loop (pepperoni, sausage, mushroom) and so so so good. The crust was soft and chewy with just the right amount crispness to the crust. So much flavor. I can't wait to come back to Vegas to eat here again."}
{"text":"I love this place! 2 slices of pizza and a couple of beers and you're done. Stuffed pizza is a specialty of theirs, and they always have monthly specials."}
{"text":"let me start off by saying im from NY...  This pizza is a joke, its not pizza by any standard. over all for VEGAS pizza its passable, but when i say passable i mean just that. Its edible, it looks and tastes pretty much exactly like papa johns or little ceasars. Id have to say dominos is still better then theres.   you will def not want it again.   I do have to say though, the staff is great and the place does look nice and has a great feel to it.  unfortunately there sauce is bland if they made there sauce better and there crust thinner it might be salvageable. oh well guess im not in ny anymore gonna just have to make my own pizza."}
{"text":"Wait for pizza was kinda long.  I got the pepperoni pizza and it was good.  The decor was 50's style with Grease decorations.  The bread they serve for free is really fresh and good.  Not a busy place."}
{"text":"Used to love metro. Sadly this will be the last time here! It's 9:00 we were sat at 8:00. There are ten tables here including ours and five were here when we were sat. It took an hour to get our food! Three items! Finally one item was dropped off, after 15 minutes I asked where is the rest of the food? She brought a pizza and said enjoy . So again I said where is the rest of our food? Finally everything was delivered and my drink was refilled after 40 minutes . No one has been back to ask how our food is and the pizza is gross! This is the first time I have ever seen it look like this! But hey can't say anything if they never come back to the table!"}
{"text":"It dawned on me today that my office is closing and this will be my last time ordering lunch from these guys for the foreseeable future and it made me a little sad inside.   They are taking a solid 2nd place behind my favorite pizzeria on my best pizza in Vegas list because they have a great thin crust pizza; use fresh toppings (less grease on your pie) and their Delivery guys never seem to get lost when delivering to my office (have to love those GPS units)   If you are in the mood for a good pizza and are within their delivery range they are worth a call and better yet go and have a sit down inside the store!"}
{"text":"My 2nd time here enjoyed both times.  Pizza, salad & fried zucchini, you can't go wrong"}
{"text":"I hate to write this review for a place we order from so frequently, however the past several orders we have received warrant this one star rating. We order a large pepperoni, mushroom, green pepper and onion well done with a side of sliced pepperoncinis - which I pay extra for. This is what arrives - an overloaded green pepper pizza so soggy that it wasn't cooked in the middle and couldn't be placed in my oven to crisp up because it just falls through the grates! This pizza was 30 bucks and by the way no pepperoncinis! I could have ordered 4 mediums from dominos, paid less and had my dinner tonight! This has happened to us in the past with Metro so we decided to chalk it up to a busy night in the restaurant, off night for the cook- whatever but now the past couple orders have mirrored tonight's. Looks like we are in the market for a new pizza joint! So sad!"}
{"text":"This was a great place back in the day when I could eat pizza. The staff is very friendly and all the pizzas are delicious. For a year I was literally going on average every other week with my class from UNLV. Pizzas are big, garlic knots are to die for and the salads with homemade are out of this world!   I gave it a 4/5 only because they don't offer gluten free options."}
{"text":"This place is located inside Ellis Island casino. They usually have 4 different pies out for slices and at least one or two of them are still hot. This is great when you don't feel like waiting for them to warm the pizza in the oven. Thursday is the best day to go, two for  1 slices. 2 Slices should fill you up. I'm from NJ so most of the pizza I have eaten out here has let me down , but this is pretty close to East coast pizza. 5 Stars !"}
{"text":"Ordered albondonga pizza (all meat) - slow to get the pie and taste ok. The place was open late, which was great.  It was slow and there seemed to be a good number of people working.  Yet, getting someone to take our order took a long time.  The place is supposed to be good....food was very average...lacking zip."}
{"text":"Was starving for good Italian. We go to Metro on Flamingo regularly for work lunches, and all is usually great. We came to the North store and we were promptly seated. Ordered the Eggplant Parma and salads with garlic knots. The eggplant was cold???  So were the garlic knots???  Asked for a manager and was told he was busy and if we waited he might find time to talk to us.  When we tried to find our waiter, hardly ever came by the table, to let him know of the issues, we had to grab a bus boy to go find him. Told waiter to box it up so we could go home and microwave it.  Our water glass remained empty as well. Sad day for Italian.  Ok, things got a little better,  as we were leaving I saw a man whom I believed was a manager. I asked him and he was.  I relayed my above review and he was surprised that staff told me he was to busy. He wanted to refund my check and I told him I just wanted him to know.  It was frustrating to have poor service but at least I felt he cared!  We give them another chance and post the outcome."}
{"text":"The worst customer service ever Sadly i like the food but we gave this place a second chance All of our orders come out separately and appetizer comes with meal Mgr needs training full of excuses Says miscommunications how is appetizer supposed to come with dinner? All he had to do is say im sorry but his excuses makes it worse"}
{"text":"Pizza is really good! Huge pizza & not greasy at all. Service is great! 10% off military discount is a plus. My new favorite pizza parlor. The hot bread yhey bring you is very good! But wings are just ok."}
{"text":"Love this place. Good service and clean. Perfect family setting. Fine and casual dining. Love the Seafood Fra Diavolo pizza large portion. Yummy.. Definitely coming back here. A must place to stop by when in Vegas area."}
{"text":"For the best Neopoiitan (Naples) pizza where pizza originated ,you need, Caputo \"oo\" high gluten flour, San Marzano tomatoes (grown in an area of  Sarno River Valley between Naples and Salerno) Mozzarella di bufala (from the City of Caserta, North of Naples) Extra Virgin Italian Olive oil and not any water but San Pelligrino water, yeast .and a raving appetite. How do I know all this ? By attending the class- \"Learn The Secrets of Hand-Crafted Pizza\"- by  third generation pizza makers-the owners/cousins of Metro Pizza- as they shared the history, traditions and techniques of the pizzaiola. . This was a 3-hour ! class that included  recipes, hands-on instruction, great Italian wine and a delicious meal for about $25!   Yes you can even take home the pizza kit that they sell, but you will never get the crispiness and the crust generated by a blazing furnace with low ceiling that cooks the pizza in minutes, with fire reaching up to 1000 degrees Fahrenheit (the bottom of the oven  is fitted with Biscotto di Sorrento tiles above a layer of Vesuvian soil) and all the tender care of a pizzaiola ! So, skip the home cooked messy and soggy pizza, unless you are gluten sensitive and make your own.  These incredibly dedicated and talented cousins, not to mention award-wining pizza makers, with an enormous patience, have been doing this for quite some time on the 2nd and 4th Tuesday of the month. I attended the class at the East Tropicana location on the 4th Tuesday of the month and it has left an indelible impression in my mind and the palate. This was not a class but a Italian feast. The cousins do this not because they need the money-they are millionaires over-with branches all over the Valley, but they do it for the love of the pizza and the love for the customers who savor a good pizza.   I personally like thin crust with the minimum toppings on it,.and pineapple is not one of them. They have pizza's for all tastes and toppings.  I am not recommending Metro Pizza for any gratitude, but they really have the best pizzas in Vegas. I have tried other locations but I always go back to the East Tropicana pizzeria, since they serve the best pizza''s in that location (may be because they got started in that location?)   I was told that, Bill Clinton's plane, was waiting on the tarmac of the McCarran, when few secret service men picked up the pizza's from the East Tropicana location. If it is good for the President of the United States-it should be good for  mere mortals! The newest Metro Pizza scheduled to open at McCarran Airport D Terminal in Feb.2014.with slices of pizza for the Air-borne."}
{"text":"We have a birthday tradition of the b-day person picking out a restaurant for their birthday dinner.  We live in CA but my son Matthew picked Metro Pizza so we headed off to Vegas.  This was our third time at this restaurant.  At every visit the food has been excellent.  Our family orders a large pepperoni and sausage pizza.  The crust is really thin with a crispy crust.  This is a pizza that has to be rolled to eat, it doesn't stand on its own.  It is always fresh and delicious.   The fresh bread is amazing, but this is the second time we have been there and they forgot to bring us bread, every new seat around us had it, but not us.  We had to remind them.  So if you don't get bread, speak up!  We ordered their Dominica Salad, it was just OK.  All the extras in the salad were cut nice and small and the same care was not taken to the lettuce it was too long and needed to be cut to eat.   As an appetizer we ordered the Buffalo Style wings, they were nice and fresh and the kids enjoyed them, I have had better.   The service was ok.  The tables are cluttered with various advertisements, which was irritating, I ended up just putting them all on the ground.    Overall a good birthday dinner for my son, he was happy and that is all that matters.  For you yelpers, if you are looking for a good fresh, New York style pizza this is definitely your place."}
{"text":"This is one of the places on my list of favorites when I'm visiting Las Vegas. It has a very family friendly atmosphere. We are usually in a large group and get good service. The pizza and house salad are the favorites for us. Both are large enough to share among a few people.  They have several promotions going on daily to save money which is always a plus. When we were there it was Disney weekend. If you had on Disney attire or dressed as a character, you received 25% off your bill. You can also get a free spin on the wheel of prizes for every large pizza you order. We didn't win anything there, but the kids thought it was fun. Would definitely recommend going to Metro Pizza."}
{"text":"Whoo hoo I am going to the city of sin! First stop gambling ...no!   go to a shady massage parlor...... no!  Kill a prostitute ......nope!   I am getting pizza from a 80s pizza place!   I could not tell if it was never redone inside or just super retro?  That was part of the fun! I'm totally a 80s guy. I was cool back then and had hair where it belonged!  In the 80s I was not fat from all this pizza !"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good and so is the service.  There are no complaints about this place but also nothing to rave about. I'd go back:-)"}
{"text":"This place was very 80s and not very fancy. Never judge a book by its cover because the food was great and the service was just as good. I will definitely be returning here for pizza every time I come to Vegas."}
{"text":"We ordered pizza from this Metro last night and man, did they come through in a clutch! We ordered a supreme and a cheese with wings and chicken strips with fries. It was all inhaled in 2.5 seconds. The pizza has HUGE slices and it's not super greasy. It's not a thick crust, which I prefer and it totally hit the spot! Highly recommend!! (AND! the delivery guy totally looks like santa!)"}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD & GREAT SERVICE!!! This place has become a regular for my family. The food is always fresh and delicious and everyone who works there is very pleasant. Definitely recommend the garlic knots. They are a ball of heavenly goodness and I could literally make a meal out of just these."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and very good service. Have had a lot of pizza in NYC and this compares to the best. Best I've had on the West Coast. Tried this place late night on a weekday and just ordered a large pizza.  Pizza is definite 5 stars.  I saw some reviews talk about decor, but decor is totally fine for a pizza parlor across from a college campus making pizza this good!"}
{"text":"It's been over a month, and I'm still waiting on the resolution of the double charging for our pizza we ordered. Not worth it if they make a mistake, because there is clearly no urgency to correct it. I'm not talking $30 bucks here. We were charged $124 TWICE.  Don't order from here. I wish we would have ordered somewhere else, eaten less delicious pizza for less money, and only been charged once.   What happened to what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas? This mess sure didn't."}
{"text":"Metro pizza on tropicana next to smart n final is delicious \"hot\" wings are hotter than your average hot wings, garlic fries yummy and the thin crust pizza is great. All the food is steaming hot when its brought to your table. Absolutely great customer service Terri is awesome"}
{"text":"Not my favorite Metro location, since it's obviously dated, but they have the same pizza you'd find at any of their other locations in town. I was finally able to try their early bird special. From 2:30 to 4:30 every Monday through Thursday, they offer 50% off every pizza on their menu. I never get the opportunity to take advantage of this offer, until New Year's. I got home early from work and I just couldn't resist trying out their discounted pizza.   We tried The Loop, a stuffed pizza. It was my first time trying any of Metro's less traditional pies. The pizza was enormous, my mom and I were only able to finish one piece each and we had leftover pizza for the rest of the week. I had wished that the pizza would be stuff with more sauce and our server had recommended we have our sauce on the side as well, since we'd likely be taking it home for later. That was a smart idea, but it also left the pizza a little dryer and less flavorful than I would have liked. Next time, if I order this again, I will definitely get a smaller pizza so I could order the sauce on top to allow it to soak in and really saturate the pizza.   Overall, they aren't my favorite pizza in town, but they are solid and they have excellent deals for lunch and early bird, that I just can't seem to resist."}
{"text":"I have a confession, I'm not a fan of the pizza at Metro pizza. I've tried it on several occasions and it's just ok. what I did enjoy on my recent visit was the chopped chicken salad.  Lettuce was fresh, they weren't stingy with the chicken and other  toppings and everything tasted great. I really didn't even need dressing to make it a great salad.   Service was friendly and attentive. This was my first visit to this particular location and it's much nicer, cleaner and newer than other locations in town."}
{"text":"When I lived in Henderson this was my favorite place to go, as it was close, and the pizza was always good! As an out of towner now, I still love it all the same.  I came here with my boyfriend and best friend and ordered a white wine sangria and a large pizza for all of us to split.  Pizza came out quicker than I remembered (I remembered longer wait times in years past) so that was a pleasant surprise!  The pizza was hot, delicious and greasy, just how I like it! The white wine sangria was good too, not great, but good!  Happy to see my much has changed here in the last few years, as they have always had great customer service and great pizza! Didn't get it last time I was here, but they have the best dessert pizza!"}
{"text":"Service was good, toppings where ok, sauce was good but pizza was way under cooked which resulted In a limp crust which was hard to cut or eat without the toppings peeling off. No way could you pick it up and eat it."}
{"text":"The food is okay, nothing special. The service is slow.  But this is what got me. I went in for lunch with a friend on Tuesday. My friend and I split the bill. We each paid around $15.00 with tip. The waitress took at least 20 minutes to bring us our check. The next day I checked my back account and noticed I was charged twice two different amounts. I called and spoke with Chris(manager) who told me it might have been because the waitress pressed the wrong number and tried to cancel the transaction and it should be reversed by Friday. I called Friday to tell him the charge was not reversed. He looked into it and told me the waitress charged we wrong because she forgot to take off the free cannoli for our birthday.  So she charged my card again after removing the the cannoli.  Before I could get my money back j had to prove to him that my friend paid(thanks corporate), which she did.  So after a week in a half since my original visit I finally got my money back.   Chris did a wonderful job handling this situation. He stayed in contact with me for every step and was sincerely apologetic. He's the only reason this store didn't get one star."}
{"text":"THE ORDER: Pasta pie w ziti noodles inside  YIPPEEE: Pizza - very unusual              thick, a 1 slice meal  BOOO: Pizza not very pizza like - more like lasagna or calzone"}
{"text":"There is a reason this place has been open for so long. The food was so tasty. I could totally tell the salad dressings were fresh and made in house.  The garlic Romano fries were delicious. Loved it I'll defiantly be back."}
{"text":"Pizza is terrific and the thin crust excellent.  And i was always  told you couldn't make good crust in Vegas because of the water....how wrong people are.  Their Honolulu pizza is the bomb.  You have to go Thursday and Sunday as it is Buy One Get One."}
{"text":"Let's see:  one sixteen inch pepperoni pizza one order of garlic romano fries  equals  35 dollars?!  wtf??  me thinks I was taken for a tourist no, me knows I was taken for a tourist  greasy pizza that dripped down the chin garlic fries that were more cheesey than garlicky (is that even a word?)  yea, i was hungry, so what?"}
{"text":"Came here with 30 (literally) of my closest friends the other night for dinner. I wish I could remember our waitress's name! The poor girl was serving not only all of us, but several other tables as well. .. AND she was the bartender! (This was on 11/25, so if a manager is reading this and knows who it was, please give her a pat on the back for us!) Despite all that, she did a great job serving us. There were no glitches with splitting the bill, no order mix-ups, and everything came out in a reasonable amount of time. She was super friendly and attentive as well.   I love the shrimp diavolo pizza (I also love shrimp diavolo pasta, in general, so I might be biased). The sangria is delicious. I was so busy socializing I only had a couple of slices and can't remember what the other thing I ate was, but this restaurant is really good for group gatherings and families. We'll definitely be coming here again."}
