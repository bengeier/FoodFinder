{"text":"Helena's has been a huge Asian food favourite of mine since I was a young child.  Growing up with this restaurant right by my house, I began enjoying their chinese food at a young age and have never turned back!  Helena's has a huge selection of dishes on their menu with reasonable prices to match.  Their categories of dishes include chicken, beef, seafood, pork (I don't eat pork but it is good for people who do) and vegetarian foods. They also have a long list of great noodle and rice combinations.  One of my favourite dishes there is the vegetable lo mein with shrimp added into the mix. I also constantly crave their orange chicken dish and the beef and peppers in black bean sauce.  And to finish it off, their fortune cookies are sweet and yummy!  Also, if you don't feel like eating out at the actual restaurant, Helena's offers take-out and delivery options."}
{"text":"There had been so many times when I would go by Helena's thinking that it looked gone, and this time it didn't fool me, sadly Helena's is no longer..  Helena's was your simple Canadian-Asian food they has a fairly large menu, good selection of dishes and the prices were very reasonable considering what some people want for a order of sweet and sour chicken balls these days!  But I guess just like everybody it seems they just couldn't make a go of it anymore, I am not sure why they closed, but it just wasn't the same crowd of people going there like there was 20 years ago so maybe that had an effect on the closing...  Now where Helena's was is a Sushi restaurant, haven't tried it yet..."}
