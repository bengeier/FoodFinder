{"text":"This is my favorite African restaurant in Montreal so far! I was born in Western Africa, Cameroon to be exact, have grown up eating all African dishes, and have been reintroduced to my favorite food of choice since moving to Montreal. Since discovering Verdun a few weeks back, this highly affordable little gem of a restaurant, with the tastiest African food I have sampled in Montreal so far, has knocked my socks off. Not only is every dish I'vve tried so far delicious, marinated the night before, and always fresh, but most overflowing take-out dishes only cost a maximum of $12 with tax. The menu rotates, introducing different African dishes to discover so there's no saturation, and they will let you taste before you buy, just like at the ice cream shop, and that alone is completely dfferent from most restaurants I've ever been to.   For the price of $10-$12, you get delicious moist rice with peas, or white rice if you prefer, steamed vegetable, in a healthy white sauce, your choice of meat may it be a beef, chicken or pork dish (goat is more expensive but cheaper here by $5 than anywhere else I've been and more tasty), sauce on your rice or on the side depending on your request, and of course, home-made hot sauce on the side. It is my guilty pleasure, one I'm sharing with my friends when they deserve it, and taking a time to write up a review about, because I want to do my part to ensure they'll be around for a long time. I just want to advertise out here that this restaurant is a must. If you love African food like me, or if you do not know it, it's the best place to discover it. It won't cost you much, and you are sure to come back."}
{"text":"I was wondering what would emerge from the brown paper covered windows that were once those of Ti-Mama's (mainly Haitian cuisine).   Much to my palates happiness another restaurant in the same realm of cuisine has recently arisen. This one adding some African fare (Senegalese I was told - but probably others too) to Haitian fare.   It was pre-dinner time but I haaad to try something. I noticed, a photo of a samosa, which would serve as a good snack (or side dish - hinted the welcoming staff). Read to the end for the verdict.  They are freshly opened so, photos of the dishes in the front window and actual ones inside showed you what the menu would; pork, beef, fish and chicken dishes in various sauces, plus vegetables, plus \"rice and beans\" (a classic side dish) to round out the savory looking offering.   I'll be back in a hurry to try their other offerings.  ...Without further ado - the triangular pocket of hamburger stuffed goodness, wasn't huge, but was tasty as any I've ever had, and the dipping sauce was finger linking good (all for $1.50)...  Note: They are cash only for now."}
