{"text":"This place is very charming, it really gives you that French cafe feeling when you walk in. The service was good, everyone I talked to was helpful and personable.

The food is great, I loved the ham and cheese croissant. I'm a big fan of their tea selections. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"food is good , coffee is great but cant get past the employee wearing his pants down and showing his underwear, I will not be back."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast and wasn't disappointed.  I really enjoyed the ham and cheese croissant; though I didn't care for the dressing that came with the salad,  next time I'll ask for it on the side.  
Eric had the chevre quiche which had potential but was not warned up enough and he was wishing there was some hot sauce to give it that kick he likes. 
We each ordered coffee,  his a double espresso which he enjoyed and I loved my hazelnut latte.  
We also shared a piece of walnut tart which was okay but I think that if it had been warm would be delicious,  another thing I'll ask for next time. 
It is a bit pricey as our meal cost $30 but for fresh made I think it's priced reasonably and we will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Excellent! Food was outstanding (we had sandwiches and croissants) - my family really enjoyed it. Customer service was outstanding as well. If we lived in Vegas- we would be regulars."}
{"text":"Wife loved it but I decided not to eat here after I saw the worker drop buns on the floor and not throw them out. Didn't trust him after that."}
{"text":"Nice cozy little restaurant with great food, delicious drinks and amazing pastries! This is my third time back here and I've not been disappointed."}
{"text":"I love this place to catch up with a friend or two or if in the mood for good French food. The Nord! Delicious!"}
{"text":"Cute inside decor (I love the brick look and rustic white chairs). Super great location (right by my house). Great when you want to splurge a little on your coffee. The food is fantastic. Very grown up style of eating that you often don't get from coffee shops. Yum! Definitely coming back!!"}
{"text":"I would like to leave a review, this time in English. I've been coming to this cafe regularly and the quality of the food is always excellent. Everything that I've tried (and I tried almost everythibg) is very fresh and tasteful. They have a conference room that is very concenient for business meeting with good healthy food and great coffee. Now they even have a nice patio. The owner is very nice, always smiling and willing to make us feel good at his cafe. Thank you Jonathan, we need more business owners like you!!"}
{"text":"This is a very nice ambience and has authentic and delicious food. Given that it is in a strip mall it has made the best effort possible to feel like a French cafe. The sandwiches have soft and tasty meat with good sauces and fresh bread. The pasteries are so good you will gain a few pounds for sure. The coffee is very good: its amazing jow many places cant get coffee right."}
{"text":"Cute, quaint coffee shop. Excellent pastries and coffee. The owner is super sweet and the service is awesome! It's quiet and nice place to study! Definitely will be coming here more often!"}
{"text":"The place the food the people - everything is amazing!!!!!!!! They've got the best coffee, the best pastries, their dishes are delicious and the atmosphere is lovely! Everyone who works at Rosalie is very kind and their customer service is awesome! I would recommend Rosalie to anyone who wants to get a true taste of France!"}
{"text":"Having been to similar fashionable books cafes when I used to live in France, I was really please to come in this relaxing and sophisticated cosy place located in Rainbow and the 215.
The owner Jonathan has a wonderful sense of service. I had breakfast with delicious french croissants and a large latte with real italian coffee. Was setting comfortably on a coach and decided to stay there with my computer till lunch time. So I had as well a great goat salad and good bread. I will be back as often as possible."}
{"text":"Jose our cashier/service guy was friendly and had great suggestions. The place was super cute and clean, good vibes!!! Now let's get into the FOOD!! It was delicious, everything we had was good. See pictures. This is a must, so I will be back."}
{"text":"This place was impressive.  I'd love to go back for a sandwich sooner than later.  Had a great Americano....  The coffee is high quality. The eclairs are amazing (my 2 yo who won't eat anything even loved them and we had to take some home) and service was great.   Kid friendly without looking cheap or cheesy."}
{"text":"Outstanding menu and service. Will come back again next time we're in Vegas. Met Jonathan, the owner who made sure that everyone was taken cared of. Excellent experience."}
{"text":"Not a memorable experience. Average pod coffee not freshly ground beans. Pastries are so so.  Having traveled to many cities in France, I was disappointed in the quality of the pastries. Most probably will not return since there are so many other great places in town to get coffee and an authentic pastry."}
{"text":"We took a Tartiflette quiche served with a salad and the avocado, chicken sandwich. 
Both were amazing ! 
Food is good but a little bit pricy. Everybody is super nice tho !"}
{"text":"This is my favorite bakery is Las Vegas! Best almond croissant I've ever had! Been here various times for brunch and with friends from out of town. Love the atmosphere in this cafe."}
{"text":"I found this place on Instagram. It is a big place and easy to spot.
This coffee shop is comparably spacious but also give you a cozy feeling. It was my first time here so I was wondering what should I get. One staff came to help me and gave suggestions. It was really nice of him! The croissant I got was the almond croissant and it tasted delicious! Definitely a nice first impression :) they told me all the pastries are freshly homemade which I looooooooveeeee it! This cafe feels like a combination of breakfast place like baguette cafe + a coffee shop like sambalatte! Will come back next time for brunch!"}
{"text":"I'll start by saying the food a Rosallie is wonderful, I've been there a few times and have recommended it to many friends based on the quality of their food.  They are usually a bit slow but last time was too much.  I live far from Rosallie, and it is because of the love of food I drive that far. 

I'm not one usually to complain about service but their service last time was inexcusable.  We ordered a coffee and a tea, the coffee arrived after 45 minute wait!  A coffee?  The tea never even came, even after asking about it twice after 30 minutes wait and being completely ignored by the girl working at the counter.  I noticed how she served the drinks of a table that arrived way past after us too. The food only partially arrived after 50 minute wait.  Even understanding that it was a Sunday at 11 am, they had only one guy working on the kitchen who was clearly overwhelmed and a girl taking the orders and serving.  The girl excused herself saying she was new, but that only shows a failure of management for not properly training their employees, why did she keep taking orders if she could not serve the customers she was taking orders from?  After having waited almost one hour, we had one food order to go and I cancelled the other food order, (it was the cheese plate which it would not have been ok to take out in the heat), the server assured me she would credit me for it--she never did, I was charged for food and drink I was never served.  This just left a very bad taste in my mouth and rather hungry, I'm never going back."}
{"text":"I love this spot.  Everything here is good. I love the ambiance, it is very inviting and has a relaxing feel.  The customer service is great, the staff is pleasant and friendly. The food is delicious and never disappoints.  My favorite drink is the white chocolate truffle.....  I have mine iced vs hot.  It is sooo delicious.  It is definitely a must to try it.  The desserts are mouth watering. No matter what you order here, it will be satisfying. It all depends on what you are in the mood for.

I do not live here anymore but when I am in town, I always make time to spot by."}
{"text":"Myself and two French friends had lunch at Rosallie today and it was exactly as described by posters. I had the Oest because I can never turn down duck confit. It was fabulous. My two friends had the country plate which was beautiful. I was kinda jealous because it came with a piece of walnut tarte and the prosciutto was lovely. But I made off with the French bread they didn't eat. I bought an almond raisin croissant, thinking of having it tomorrow, but I got a bit peckish around 3:00 and thought I would have a bite or two. Whoops! It disappeared."}
{"text":"I ordered the Ham & cheese croissant which you can add egg to it .I had mine scrambled. It came with a side salad which the dressing I fell in love with. It was kinda like this lemony balsamic vinagrety flavor. To drink I had the tropical berry tea. Ill defenitly be back to try their pastrys."}
{"text":"This place is cute and nice atmosphere. The prices are affordable and friendly staffs"}
{"text":"I was so disappointed, and disgusted at the same time.  I wanted a latte and pastry.  I was shocked to find ants floating in my latte!  Once I realized what was there, I immediately returned to the counter, to only wait several minutes before i was noticed.  It nearly seemed to me that i was being ignored.  Once I was acknowledged, a gentleman wearing mascara and eye makeup happily greeted me.  The gentleman looked at me, and gave me a wink and seemed to me i was being visually stripped naked.  I told him what the issue occurred and my complaint was completely disregarded. , but I was told those ants were not from his establishment.  I have never been treated this way ever!  I will never return, nor will i ever recommend the place to anyone.
Please, anyone seeking a peaceful latte and pastry, save your time, energy, effort, and pass on by.

Later this morning, the very same gentleman called me a moron, and falsely accused me of me being a stalker!  I was merely seeking a snake and a boost of latte!  It frightens me how violent Jonathens behavior has become.  See photo below!"}
{"text":"Here's why I give this place one star. I ordered three drinks. One crème brûlée latte, one hot chocolate, one black coffee and three croissants. The croissants were excellent. But the drinks... Let me tell you how awful these drinks were. The black coffee was watered down, completely undrinkable, the crème brûlée tasted like they burnt the espresso and the hot chocolate tasted like a cheap Hershey's chocolate bar melted in milk. Now the presentation of the hot chocolate was cool, they steam the milk and give you a cube of chocolate on a stick that you melt yourself in the hot milk, but this is definitely not worth $4.50 for THE SMALLEST CUP IN THE UNIVERSE! Disappointed with our drinks I thought we could tell the manger and see what they can do for us because I didn't want my money to go to waste. The register lady was very nice and said she appreciated the feedback and went and got the manger, or the owner, and so we told him what was going on and he just kind of stared at us like \"what do you want me to do for you\" type of way, we asked if we could get our money back and said \"no.\" That's it's, just no. No apology or anything, didn't offer to give us anything else, didn't bother bother with good customer service at all! Horrible place! Definitely do not recommend going there!"}
{"text":"Nice enough interior with plenty of room to sit and eat or study, but just god-awful food and customer service that doesn't care or is inept. The owner was rude when I talked to him about issues with the food. I wasn't even looking for anything to be re-made or my money back. I could tell that the execution was way off and just wanted to help him out. What a douche. Rosallie may stay in business or do alright since it's on Rainbow, but anyone who cares about food in general, much less French café items, would do better to move along to another spot--there are way too many good restaurants and beautiful cafés to waste your time here."}
{"text":"This review is only on a sandwich no pastry- which look AMAZING! I ordered the mozzarella and prosciutto sandwich. It was decent. In my own opinion, I want to mostly taste prosciutto in a prosciutto sandwich. Here, there was a lot of cheese and tomato to overwhelm the flavor, which I love don't get me wrong but it was too much. The mozzarella was too salty and I like my prosciutto to be the saltiest thing on the sandwich. Again just my take on it. I just love taste of prosciutto and theirs was soooo good I wanted even more and for it to be the star of the dish.There was a great salad around the rim of the dish and the dressing was really good!! Actually, fantastic. I'd definitely eat it again. The employees were so sweet and I love the atmosphere. The father and daughter ahead of me in line were both so nice and gave me opinions on what to order, which was so sweet knowing they support and love this place! It is definitely a home-y place and that is what sold me on it. Also, I got a free coffee refill! YUM. I'm definitely coming back to try to duck because the only reason it did not get five stars is because of the salty mozzarella(well and long wait time)! Definitely give it a try if you're in the area. Be prepared to wait 30 minutes for a sandwich though. I didn't know that coming in so I was annoyed but if you know ahead of time it makes it better:)"}
{"text":"Great!  We will all be back. 2 of us had the EST sandwich - 1 on one of the best croissants ever and 1 on a multigrain bread roll. And both were outstanding. My daughter had the ham and cheese croissant and loved it. My mom tried the quiche Lorraine salad and would definitely order again. 

Leave room for the chocolate croissants!  You will be glad you did. 

Merci beaucoup!"}
{"text":"My first time at a french bakery. Definitely enjoyed myself with all the good looking pastries. It felt like it doesn't matter what you order since all of them looked good and both of the orders we got was pretty delicious."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the restaurant is adorable; however, if you come during a busy time, it may be a long time before you see your food. I came with a large group and while there weren't really a lot of other tables occupied, some of us waited forever for our food. It was bad enough that those who received their entrees first couldn't wait for everyone to get their food since it was taking so long. The service was good but just be warned!"}
{"text":"Your basic simple and delicious French comfort food in a nice quiet setting.  We have been here three or four times for breakfast with friends.  The coffee is freshly brewed and the heavenly croissant so buttery and flaky.   We were luckily to be greeted by their manager Jose each time with his big smile.   We have also tried their salmon, and duck dish and it is highly recommended.  They make their Macaron fresh daily and we bought some as gift and for our enjoyment.  Parking could be tight depending on time of day.

Nov 13:  Not sure if it is the beans, the fineness of the grind, the Half & Half, or the temperature of the water... etc  Our usual French pressed coffee tasted sour.  The server offered to have it replaced but never made good on his promise or came back.  Sorry, but we will take a time out."}
{"text":"Very cute french cafe.they have great coffee and pastries.The owner and employees are very friendly and service is incredible.By far is my fave place, i will be back soon."}
{"text":"It was or first time here and definitely will be back. Food was awesome and price was reasonable. It's located where you would not expect it. Don't expect full service."}
{"text":"Great tea! Super chill laid back atmosphere. Food was delicious. The pastries were unbelievably simple but amazing."}
{"text":"I tried Rosallie for the first time this week and it is delightful!  I enjoyed every bite, and the tea was delicious!  I cannot wait to go back again.  I highly recommend this darling place.  The service is also very good!"}
{"text":"Lattes, cappuccinos, almonds croissants, chocolate croissants, fresh everything. A place that you crave to return for more.   Absolutely fantastic."}
{"text":"I've been a huge fan of Rosallie until as of lately. Their pastry case and bread assortment is always made fresh but their drinks are a whole other story. 

On my past visit, my boyfriend ordered a Croque Rosallie which was absolutely delicious and I ordered a green tea latte and a cheese danish. 

Upon receiving my latte, I was a bit confused due to the lack of green hue in my cup. I double checked with the cashier and barista that I had received a green tea latte and they advised me that my drink was correct. I don't know about you but matcha green tea is green not white. 

My latte tasted and look like just steamed milk. Starbuck's green tea latte is even better than what I had."}
{"text":"This place was awesome! Pastry case was well stocked and everything looked amazing! Great selection of teas and you can't. Eat the amazing decor. We loved the $10 breakfast that included a croissant, toasted bread, homemade jams, butter, coffee and orange juice. Perfect for sharing. Staff was friendly and helpful. We will definitely come back. Minus one start for the lack of diaper changer in restroom, other than that a perfect experience!"}
{"text":"Wonderfully flaky and buttery croissants and possibly the best espresso I've had on this side of the Atlantic. I'll be back for more!"}
{"text":"We had my daughters baby shower here and it was enjoyed by all.  I think we may have been one of the first large groups they had hosted, only because, the service was lacking.  I had expected seating for the 26 adults, who we expected, the table was set for 18?!  Drinks were ordered individually, at the table, but trickled in slowly and way after the food arrived upon the buffet table.  We had a wonderful shower, with great food and drink but I felt that the staff was overwhelmed by us, considering the place was open to the public as well.  Jonathan is conscientious about his product, so perhaps, that had something to do with the inconsistent flow.  Overall, we are happy we discovered this venue, the food is very good and drinks artistic, we enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"Everything Sooo good! Almond Croissants were the best I've had, Hot Chocolate was so rich and delicious, Creme Brulee Latte and Nutella Smore Latte - was amazing. My new favorite place - too bad I live in Hawaii. Rustic Cozy atmosphere, friendly efficient service. Will be back for more before I leave Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Amazing sandwiches. Light and fresh atmosphere. Go here, you'll be pleasantly delighted."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous breakfast this morning at Rosallie. My wife Karen and I shared the Croque Rosallie, a croissant filled with Paris ham, sweet onion bechamel mozzarella cheese. We had them add scrambled eggs and the flavor was to die for.  For a sweet treat we had a fresh apple turnover.  Karen was excited with the amount of loose leaf tea options for hot tea.  I opted for the blended coffee and it was terrific.  Based on the food alone the Cafe deserved five stars but when you consider The ambience, I was wishing there was a sixth star option. Between the decor and the music you could close your eyes and feel like you are on a secluded corner somewhere  in France with the one you love."}
{"text":"Really cute place. Friendly staff and the owners are super nice and fun to talk to. Amazing food and delicious coffees. Music is a little too loud for studying but there's a little room behind the kitchen area where there's no distraction. My new little go to spot
 Super happy I stopped in to check it out!"}
{"text":"Came for lunch today and it's a cute French casual setting with live plants and glass wine cellar. 

Greeted by the barista but was never offered a menu until another guy walked into our confused gaze on the chalk board consisting only drinks.

We ordered the Nord
smoked salmon sandwich along with red onions and capers. Salad was a bit over dress for me personally. Beautifully plated, sandwich was okay.

The man recommended their most popular quiche. I wish it was cheesier? The consistency of it was runny like an egg custard. I've never been to Paris, so I can't comment on if that's how it's supposed to be. But I've had quiche else where and it was definitely not like that. 

Lastly the charcuterie. $14.95 I got 4pcs of proscuitto, 4pcs of salami, 2 options of cheeses that tasted very basic, and few olives etc. to me, it was definitely overpriced for what it is. 

It was a cute place,  I liked the atmosphere, would probably be back when I see my dentist in the next plaza. Didn't try any desserts, hopefully the pastries are more impressive than the lunch menu."}
{"text":"The quiche is so good! It's starbucks atmosphere of being able to post up with your laptop but a wide selection of delicious food and coffee and teas."}
{"text":"They don't have nonfat or 2% milk... I get it, they're trying to be authentic. But it still sucks a little because I get the nonfat latte so I can enjoy their amazing pastries.  So, I opted for an iced ceylon tea \"with a little milk\".  What I ended up with was slightly tinted water/milk combo that was delivered to me in less than two minutes. My point in telling you that - you have to STEEP the tea. It's part of the whole \"tea preparing process\"... (uh, what happened to being 'authentic'?)  OK... so I won't get \"to go\" anything from there anymore except pastries.  But I will definitely be back because, again, AMAZING PASTRIES."}
{"text":"Great coffee, lattes, and food. I crave this place. Quiches and sandwiches are incredible. Salad dressing is special."}
{"text":"I have to put an other review!!!this Is so far my favorite French bakery, they have a new manager (Christof who is French!!) he is fantastic, helpful and you really get transported to France!!
The pastries looks good and taste as delicious as they look!!!
If you go there once you will definitely go back!!thats the type of place that is worst driving 30minutes!!!"}
{"text":"New french style bakery appeared on the SW side of Vegas. Decent sized. Quiet. Similar to la belle terre on sahara but on a smaller scale. Everything seems to be done on site. 

Fresh crossiant. Flaky and buttery. Pretty good sized too. Wonder when they make it? Would be amazing to have a freshly baked croissant *_* 

Quiche Chevre Salade - Tomato, goat cheese, and spinach quiche on top of a spring salad. Egg is light and fluffy. I know quiche doesnt require flour for preparation, at least not in the egg portion but i cant seem to shake the feeling of some like \"undercooked flour texture/feeling\". Expected the quiche to have a little more flavor with the goat cheese and tomato to give some freshness but seemed mildly plain. At least overall, i felt it was healthy? XD 

Not a bad place. Location is fairly convenient, near the 215. Hope they will come out with more fresh bakery options and things for the menu in the future"}
{"text":"Lovely decor, nice service, delicate and yummy pastries, good price, and delicious salad."}
{"text":"This place great for lunch date. We ordered most of the food already by our second trip. Almond croissant is great. Apple pie is good, wish we had it warmed up. 

The owner is nice. He was surprised at how much food we got the first visit. 

Definitely a go to place for sunday coffee date with the social coordinator. 

Make note that they do cater, so make sure to call before going in. We stopped by last week and it was closed for a private event."}
{"text":"Loved this little French cafe! I finally got a Saturday morning to come give this place a visit. Based on Yelp reviews, we decided to try out the Almond Croissant, Almond Chocolate Croissant and Tartine L'Americaine! Everything was so good especially those huge fluffy croissants! As for drinks we ordered the Creme Brulee Latte and the Rose Mocha which was on the special chalk board menu. The Rose Mocha was so heavenly I would definitely recommend.

The customer service was great and I can't wait to come back to try more! I love the ambiance and it's the perfect cute cafe to have some breakfast in! There aren't many cafes like this in Vegas."}
{"text":"Not sure I am fond of their breakfast selections here or at least nothing with eggs (overdone) however, their sweet offerings and coffees served here are wonderful!

I love their walnut tart.  This was a first for me as I have tried many different types of tarts but never walnut until now!  I actually flew one home for this past Thanksgiving to share with my family. That is how much I love their tart.  It is not too sweet and is beautifully made. 

The other favorite for me is their Chocolate Almond Croissant.  Some of the filling spills out as it bakes making the edges something I love to eat last. Delicious!  

The pastry chef and owner is very pleasant as for the rest of the staff it has been a hit and miss.  The place is wonderfully decorated with a vintage French motive and offers cute seating and an overall an enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"We love this place! The coffee is always great and the bakery always has a good selection. I recommend Le French."}
{"text":"Another main stay for us - Las Vegas is getting so many nice little French style cafes..
Love the coffee and service.
Quiche Lorraine is very good - crest is a little sweet - I liked it.  Also tried many other items with family - the hot tartlettes are yummy - the American with bacon, cheese and egg yolk was very good.

One recommendation is to have mustard (Dijon or stone ground) available for the sandwiches and meat platters."}
{"text":"While it can be a bit pricey if you keep adding on, the food is amazing. We had the centre chicken sandwich, which was quite tasty. Their baked goods are light and flaky with desserts galore. We spent $50 more after our meal getting baked goods to take home, plus a couple jars of the home made jam (which is worth the up-charge to try). 

My guests had the ham and cheese croissant and a quiche. Which they enjoyed. Though the Centre Chocken Sandwich was the winner, in my book."}
{"text":"They have the best croissants in Vegas. Flaky, buttery, rich goodness. The almond croissants are a must.

Tables are nice and sturdy and the decor is airy. Too often in little cafes the tables are rickety and crowded. You can breathe in here.

I had their Nord (smoked salmon) sandwich. The multigrain bun it came on was delicious, and the salad was perfect, with everything the perfect temperature.

I heard the owner saying they were going to start making tiramisu. I will definitely come back for that and their sandwiches."}
{"text":"This place is good!! Large Cappuccino at a good price. The chocolate croissant's where flakey on the outside and soft on the inside soo good. You also have to try the eggs groton (or however you spell it) try it!!!"}
{"text":"I visited Rosallie with some friends for a cheese and wine night they were having. The line could have been better organized we were just standing there shrugging our shoulders near the cash register wondering if someone was going to come over and charge us or if it was something you pay for at the end? After someone finally came over and rung us up we were handed plates to get some cheese. Good selection of cheeses offered here and the breads were good too. I came back recently for brunch with friends. Service started out good but then changed. When my order came I had a smaller drink than the menu described, I asked for a chocolate croissant and got a regular one, and there was no jam or butter on my plate as the menu stated comes with it. After saying something to the girl working I was quickly brought butter and jam but my croissant and drink didn't get corrected. The breads and jam were good I really liked that and the croissant was flaky and delicious. I do wish my order came as it was supposed to I had been looking forward to trying the much talked about chocolate croissant here for months. Guess I gotta keep waiting. Some others in our group had to wait a really long time for their orders which was just sandwiches and they did complain of the bread being hard. I guess the owner was out of town and of the only 2 people working... it turned out to be the girls first day. They could have said something when we first arrived since the brunch was planned in advance to just simply give us a heads up that they might have some hiccups. The menu has a bit of something for everyone but I have to admit I was surprised to not see a traditional croque monsieur or madame on the menu since pretty much that's what people would expect to find at a French cafe. Their take on it is the croque Rosallie and it is damn good tho."}
{"text":"Awesome little French cafe. Best one in Vegas with fresh quiche and fresh pastries. The manager was very friendly and cordial and stopped by to ask how everything was going. Nice decor and ambiance. Will be back for sure"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. The staff is always kind and very helpful. This is a great place to hang out having a chat over a latte or sitting reading a book in one of the large comfortable chairs they have in the corner. Oh and the Nord sandwich? To die for.
I also took a very picky Frenchman(my boyfriend) for breakfast here, he is very particular about his quiche and when it arrived he was very satisfied."}
{"text":"Found this gem right down the street from my house. Great honest food and French baked goods. The creme brûlée latte was better than anything I've gotten from Starbucks."}
{"text":"This is the cutest cage ever! The decoration isn't even the best part! They have such a great variety of pastries and sandwiches. I ordered the nord and the presentation was beautiful. They make great espressos and mimosas. The waitress/cashier was so friendly!! Definitely would make the 30 minute drive to eat here!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem for sure!! I can only speak for their pastries, but I agree with everyone who says their almond croissants are the best. The walnut tarte was also 5/5. -1 star because their chocolate mousse tasted like canned whipped cream and their lunch options were kind of boring. But this bakery is a must try- way better and more affordable than say Panera or Bouchon. The croissant was huge and soft. Very cute interior and the tall cashier was really friendly. I think they could benefit from expanding their menu to have more items and heartier dishes than sandwiches. Cant wait to come back to try more!!"}
{"text":"It's been that kind of morning.

Running errands, getting things done, sleepy from working the night before. As I'm going from place to place, I browse through my Instagram to see a post that a new bakery/cafe was right down the street. I look on Yelp, it looked like they just opened yesterday. No pictures. Hmm. I look back on IG and see one of their Apple Crumble Pie. Whoa. I'm a sucker for crumble anything. Let's go, I said to myself, you need a break.

Quaint. Cute bright ambiance. Very much what I'd envision a corner cafe in France. The owner and girl behind the counter greeted as I scoped out their display. I mentioned the Apple Crumble Pie, since I didn't see it. Walnut Pie today instead as he just put out a limited batch for their first week of opening. Whaaat?!?! Bummer.

I love their tea display, all the leaves in small batches with a clear cylinder top which the owner said I could open. The cylinder captures the aroma of each batch, it smelled heavenly. 

I sat down with my Green Tea Passion Fruit and Almond Pie, took some pictures, and just relaxed. The tea was fruity and smoothing, the Almond Pie was light and buttery. I had to restrain and take most of it home. 

I'm sure they can put together a box of pastries and cup of coffee to go, but this isn't that type of place. It's one where you sit, sip your latte, chit chat with friends, and enjoy. We don't do that enough, or at least I don't. 

I wish I could give it 5 stars, being I'm FTR. Hopefully, I'll be able to the next time I visit, fingers crossed that they have that Apple Crumble Pie!"}
{"text":"I go here at least once a week for lunch. I love the smoked salmon sandwich (\"nord\") but I usually get it as a salad. They have a variety of coffee and espresso drinks that I have yet to try, mainly because I'm a sucker for their loose leaf tea. They serve it in a French press. The prices are reasonable. It is a counter-service place, so it is casual. It is also usually pretty quiet and it doesn't have the crowded feeling of the typical coffee house (yes, I mean you, Starbucks)."}
{"text":"Mmmmm. So good. Theyve expanded their menu a little and everything so wonderful its hard to choose what to order."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast w/ my friend Mara. This place is different from our usual everyday breakfast , but I love trying out new places. 

Visually , this is the cutest cafe we have here in Vegas. I loved all of the French decorative touches & the very cozy and roomy atmosphere. There's plenty of natural lighting (perfect for photo ops !) and variety of areas for seating - they have wooden & white marbled tables , a lounge area w/ couches and even an outdoor patio. I'd love to come here on a sunny day or on a rainy day. Their music playlist is very nice too.

Soon as you walk in , you are greeted by their friendly staff. You order at the cash register and they bring everything right out to you :) They have beautiful glass displays of pastries (the croissants !!) , desserts , and quality loose leaf teas (so cute they have their tea leaf samples displayed on the counter under small glass domes). They even have homemade jams to buy & a wine cellar. For their menu , they have a decent selection of sandwiches , salads , soups , etc. So there's healthier alternatives as well as options for all your carb/sweet tooth needs.

Everything was presented lovely and the food was excellent ! I got their veggie quiche (8.70$). Quiche was very fluffy and delicious. It perfectly paired with the salad it came with. Keep in mind , their portion size is just enough to satisfy smaller stomachs.

I must comment how much I love their desserts too. I have been here just once so I only tried one of theirs but it really made a good impression on me because it's not overly sweet like American desserts. We shared their chocolate raspberry tart which was the right amount of sweetness and tartness. You must try their crème brûlée latte (3.75$ for a regular). Again , not too sweet and it's the perfect blend of caramel and coffee.

It is a little out of the way for me , but well worth the trip. It's right off the 215 Rainbow exit next to Jaburritos. One of the top places for breakfast/brunch , catching up with a few friends or even studying. They provide free wifi & have phone charging stations too. I much prefer this place over Sambalatte."}
{"text":"This is a quaint little bakery with rustic seating and amazing products. We come here when we want an almond croissant done the correct way and a nice cup of coffee. My husband always orders the breakfast croissant which is fairly large. Prices are great and the environment is calm and friendly. 
I would highly recommend eating here for breakfast. I also heard they have a wine club that we need to check out!"}
{"text":"Now called Le French cafe.  I loved the croque Rosaille down to every last bite and was tempted to order another.  The desserts looked delectable and I will certainly consider trying during my next visit.  Cute and quiet cafe."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast. Some good, some bad. 

Food: we both had the honey and lavender latte. It had a very nice flavor and I would have really enjoyed it - if it was hot. It was lukewarm. I ordered a small croissant and bread plate for my meal, which was all really good as well. My wife ordered a quiche, which was not cooked properly (under-cooked). 

Cost: I felt the cost was very reasonable for what we ordered.

Staff: The staff was very pleasant.

Cleanliness: Overall, it seemed fairly clean, however two incidents make me question that: 1) the person taking and handling money at the register stepped aside to show someone preparing the food what he meant by putting a paper between a plate and croissant. Three croissants, zero hand washing. 2) A couple at a table beside us asked for to go cups. They were brought over and one of the cups fell on the floor. Without hesitation, the server picked up the cup from the floor and put it on the table for the customer to use. 

As a side note, if anyone from Rosallie reads this, either add some acoustic panels or stop banging the $h*t out of everything you touch. This is a large open space, all the walls in the middle are half-walls, and all these sounds bounce around eventually making it to your patrons in loud and piercing splendor.

I *really* want to like this place and return, but honestly, I doubt that's going to happen."}
{"text":"Delicious food but very high calorie and greasy. No healthy options which is why I give it 4 stars and not 5. I got the ham and cheese croissant which came with a side salad of mixed greens and a super yummy mustard sauce."}
{"text":"Driving around saw this place, didn't think much of it. Wanted to try something different for breakfast. Really cute place with friendly staff greeted me and my husband.  Pastries galore. The  food looked exactly as the menu picture and it was awesome. The pastries were yummy too. Both mine and my husband's sandwiches were very yummy. Delicious hot soy latte too. They have outside sitting too. Definitely going back."}
{"text":"This is a great cafe with an amazing tea selection the macrons aren't bad. I had a chicken sandwich and the flavor was all there."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, good pastries.  Not the best croissant in town as some have claimed but definitely a solid top 5, good palmier.  A little pricey on some pastries but only slightly.  Solid coffee."}
{"text":"This place is delicious. I recommend all of their quiches, the duck sandwich, and the finch cheese tartine. Their almond tarts are pretty great as well and their tea selection is wonderful."}
{"text":"This place had such a cute atmosphere and the owners were so friendly. I had the spinach/goat cheese quiche which was delicious, although it wasn't as hot as I would've liked it to be. I also had the creme brûlée latte which was amazing. Their almond croissant was very flaky and moist, and their walnut tarte was to die for. They both had the perfect amount of sweetness. They are a bit understaffed so the service was a bit slow, but nonetheless, I'll be back!"}
{"text":"We visit this restaurant this morning . Immediately fell in love with the food and the atmosphere! It's so cute atmosphere !! We both feel it was an amazing restaurant we found !!
I ordered Crème brûlée coffee It was amazing , Breakfast croissant sandwiches, salads &sandwiches plates was really yummy  We definitely love to go back and  try other menu soon"}
{"text":"We read about this darling French bistro in one of the Vegas blogs.  It sounded too good to be true!  Parisian croissants and pastry in Vegas?  Not possible!    But unbelievably true!  Rosallie captures the essence of a French cafe in Sin City!   Perfectly textured, flakey crisp croissants on the outside layers and tender sweetness on the inside.  A taste of heaven.  Butter croissant and Pain au Choculat were flying out the door early on in the morning.   We had a lovely breakfast pastry paired with a wonderfully warm ambiance.

If you've never been to Paris, Rosallie will give you a taste of the pastry that you're missing!   Vegas locals are lucky to have this gem in their backyard.   Simple menu that speaks volumes of the French culture.   

Magnifique!"}
{"text":"Amazing place! Really nice ambiance, delicious food and friendly staff. It is a little out of the way, but well worth the trip. If you have a sweet tooth, highly recommend chocolate almond croissant with a cup of French coffee. They also have free wifi a charging station and a book shelf full of books. Perfect place to spend a morning!"}
{"text":"Rosallie....eeerrr....Le French Cafe.....is a hidden gem. :)

The ambiance is like the little cafes u would experience in Europe....very cozy...a little bigger then the ones there but it is very nice. :) the owner is French....It was kind of odd walking into a French Cafe in the US and hearing French coming from half the customers....lol

The menu was small but u can tell that alot of thought went into it to keep very French. 

I had the Tartlin Angelique....It was their special that they had by the register....It looked great and I couldn't resist...

It was DELICIOUS!!! I devoured it. :) the bread was perfect. They toasted it and it had the perfect amount of crunch with a chewy texture to compliment the hardboiled eggs and the fresh green mix on top of the toast. Delicious. I would definitely come back for this. :)

I also got a tea to drink with my meal....I got the earl grey and it came out in a French press....I love a good earl grey and this did not disappoint. It was DELICIOUS. 

Seriously everything about this meal was great. I can't wait to come back and try something else on the menu.  So glad to have another gem in the SW....yay!!!! :D

And before I forget....the staff....the girl at the counter that took my order and brought out my food....very very friendly!!! :)

{"text":"Since my last visit, this spot seems to have blossomed. Came for a few afternoon visits and staff were friendly and welcoming. Finally got a chance to sample the food and have fallen in love with the madeleines and sandwiches, particularly the Est (brie cheese, tomato, pesto, and greens, all on a fabulous brioche bun).  I haven't camped out with a mug of tea yet, but as the colder weather settles in, I'm coming by more frequently for grab-and-go coffees, which are always just right. 

Come by when you have some time to kill and explore all the little seating areas and the owner's decorative touches- there seems to be a story behind everything. Staff is very professional, and Jonathan is great at suggesting items to try."}
{"text":"Great caffe n brunch place,place is busy which is a good thing,Ambiance is great the stuff is nice n welcoming defiantly will come back n recommend to all of my friends"}
{"text":"Yum!!!!   Love the quiche- fluffy.  
Another good French bakery in Vegas. 
Great selection."}
{"text":"Had a great experience during lunch hour. Very tasty food and pastries,  friendly stuff. Nice verity to pick from. Will come back to try more :) If you are good foodie lover, definitely check out this place!"}
{"text":"I had the best pumpkin spice latte that I've ever had in my life! Great vibe and service at this authentic French cafe."}

Love this place! The food is delicious. Croissants are the best in town. The setting is bright and airy like a week kept home. It's welcoming and in a southern France vibe.

I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I came and got a large assortment of their pastries.  I can't even start to tell you how amazing they all were! I along with all my friends could not decide what one we liked the most. Such a cute cafe and such good pastries.  Definitely going back!!!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and great place to just hang out. My friend and i use to grab a coffee and pastry and hangout! Great decor and atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Excellent the quiche was so fluffy and the pastry awesome. Great service and the atmosphere very relaxing background music very good"}
{"text":"This is by far the best French cafe in Nevada. The food is exceptional and the coffee is fantastic. The ambiance is great and the staff are friendly. I honestly can speak highly enough of this place. But be careful the pastries are so tasty it is hard to stop! I love the almond croissant and cream brûlée latte as combo. Don't leave vegas without trying"}
{"text":"This place really deserves a five star review. They opened not very long ago and have come along way they have unbelievably delicious croissant breakfast sandwiches gourmet coffeeand what I like the most is a very good selection of tea. It's good to mix some gourmet tea every once in a while with the regular morning coffee. They have great service. I tried them because I like to support new local businesses and I became a customer for long time."}
{"text":"Awesome French pastries: check.
Great coffee (hazelnut praline is definitely my favorite: check.
Friendly staff: check.
This French Cafe is my weekend spot. They are improving each and every day. Now they also have nice salads and a couple of items for lunch too, and serve wine.
Very cosy and friendly atmosphere. Go check them out!!"}
{"text":"The quiches are really good! Everything is good! The tea, the sweets & baked goods!! So tasty!"}
{"text":"The sign says Le French Cafe.  The Yelp listing says Rosallie & on the chalkboard inside it says Rosallie.  It feels barren inside as the decor at this place is very low budget & plain... There really is nothing here which feels warm, French & inviting. 

The girl who took our order was nice. The table was not clean & we had to wipe it off before sitting down. 

The coffee was not anything I would order again. My husband had the latte & it was tasteless & I had French Vanilla Latte & there was not any coffee taste, but there was some creamy vanilla.  Very little foam on top. There was a pretty heart type design. 

You order at the counter & they bring it to you. That's the service Level. No follow up, so it is much like a Fast Food place. Except the prices are more like a sit down restaurant. 

Lentil soup was bland & had no texture.  Would not recommend. It was served hot. 

Salad with quiche was tasty. Good dressing & they put on a nice quantity. 

Quiche Lorraine was hot & tasted pretty good. 

Quiche Chèvre (goat cheese) was smooth & bland. Not something I would order again. It was ok & came out hot. Crust was bland. I had to add salt to make it palatable.

I love French food & was looking forward to trying this restaurant.  Will try again if I hear that it has improved."}
{"text":"My honest feedback. Ok, but not impressed. Attention to details were missing. 
Food was ok. I did not feel very French in this place. Bathrooms not as cute and clean as other cute French places minutes away from this one. In fact, there was a strong small coming from the bathrooms...you know the one when you don't clean very well....urine type of small unfortunately.  Decorations were cute, but I did not did not get that emotional connection to the French culture. 
Looking around, they certainly should do something about the floor, the walls and doors have stains on them...details are everything. 
With some serious cleaning and having the employee dress classy and look taken care of themselves and also the food be somehow more traditional, this place could be wonderful."}
{"text":"Our new favorite place for brunch! Coffee has been amazing every time! It's pure perfection! The quiche plates are wonderful & ALL the croissants are the best ever! The staff is impeccable! With all Vegas has to offer, we have found this to be the best breakfast/brunch spot!
Do not pass up this gem!"}
{"text":"This place is just amazing, great service and amazing lattes! And we can't forget about the pastries super delicious!

The reason I gave it 4 stars because I want to try their wine and cheese but I like my coffee in the morning and my wine later at night and they close till 6. I get off work at 6 so when I want wine and cheese I have to go somewhere else because they're not open anymore but other then that this place is amazing and I have brought lots of my girls here for coffee!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite little cafes in Vegas! Coffee is always good as is the service and just cute inside! We usually get the hazelnut praline latte, cinnamon or creme brûlée latte! The creme brûlée actually has the burnt sugar on top of it, which is amazing! Best croissants and madelines. I love that they have a nice charcuterie, cheese and tart spread for breakfast, makes for a lovely time. I've also had their salads, also very delicious!"}
{"text":"Checked another one off the bookmark. Yay! I was in the mood for some Croissants thought about Rosallie and figure now a good time. Not just Croissants the assorts of Croissants least over four different ones. Too many for me try one time. I order the chocolate, almond, nuttella, and regular one with the special of the day sandwich \"Croque Bosali\". I did get piece of the almond one before hooked my boys at bike store with the assortment. It was good. Croissants the whole key for me. BUTTERY and FLAKY. If you fingers get butter moist each time grab it. Beautiful thing in life. The Croissants one of the things place is known for can understand the appeal. Winnah.

The sandwich was solid. The ham and cheese (forget the cheese but not your plain cheese put it that way) was prefect combination. The Croissant for the bread is divine. The little side salad ok nothing special just basic organic mix greens with some kind house balsamic vinaigrette and couple slices of fresh oranges on the side. Eye appeal this dish is far from. Really at the end of the day about the food presentation could careless. 

I really like the whole interior look definitely going for some of that Paris vibe from the artwork on the walls, the way they display all the Croissants in wicker baskets, signs each different pasty even the menu in chalkboard style, and the smell is great from the minute walk in. The prices reasonable I think for the pastries. Not that I go often to bakeries in general. Definitely great spot get some coffee, great book, and great fresh pastries. They also have little outside patio area that can chill at with friends. Service was awesome. It was my first time the lady was  helpful and gave great recommendations.

Since close by no doubt plan on coming back trying more of the fresh baked goodies."}
{"text":"I love the food there and I'm a regular, since I am originally from France, this remind me of back home. Everything is authentic. I've been going there  since it opened. The reason why I'm giving 3 stars, it's because they do not sell baguettes, it's s little pricey and the big negative point is that the black girl who works there since the beginning never acknowledge us, never say hello, goodbye, never smile, it's almost as she doesn't wanna be there. She's not French and I feel like she doesn't represent this establishment very well. Maybe the owner should consider hiring someone nicer."}
{"text":"To me it was just okay...I was actually disappointed quiche was flavorless and my sandwich most expensive one was straight soggy...ordered soup then when I got there they didn't even have any soup"}
{"text":"Each bite is better than the next, great service fantastic pastries and the quiche is delicious and light. Fantastic discovery"}
{"text":"My favorite place :)  Best Almond Croissant and ham & cheese croissant is really good as well. I tried their fruit tart, which is very good also. French press is good, everything is great :) The owner is very nice and the service is good as well. Nice place and nice pastry + coffee!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorite pastries place in town. My favorite is their chocolate almond croissant. Crispy on the outside, delicious buttery taste topped with chocolate and almond. Yumm. 

I also love their coffee and french sandwiches. It makes me feel I am back in Paris! Everything made fresh daily. Their salad and sandwich combo make a perfect lunch. Price is also reasonable $9-12 for lunch sandwich. Pastries between $4-6. Caramel latte $6. 

The unique warm feeling decor makes you feel like home. Good corner section to read a book, do some research or studying. Love this place and definitely will come back again."}
{"text":"Me and my husband really like this place and have been a couple of times. I've had the ham and cheese on a croissant and the Croque Rosalie. I love their coffee too. It has a very cute and comfortable atmosphere where you would enjoy eating in. They have a variety of french pastries too. If your looking for an economically priced place for breakfast or brunch you'll like it here. Service is great and friendly too."}
{"text":"Food is very good, while the quiche is an excellent standout.  Coffee is decent.  Teas are fantastic, with an amazing assortment.  

The people who work there are incredibly nice, but the service is dreadful.  The place is small, and usually crowded.  And because it takes so long to get your food, people park at their tables for hours.  Also, the entire order doesn't get served at the same time, or not even close.  You end up with people watching each other eat, like this is a new spectator sport.  And no matter how much you like your meal-mates, it gets awkward.  The first eater has the guilt of knowing the others are hungry and envious of your food.  The last eater has to rush, knowing that everyone else is dying to leave, having already chatted, waited, eaten and drank.  

While I really like this food, I do not enjoy going there because of the service."}
{"text":"Nord Sandwich: $9.90, 5/5.

If you like Salmon Lox, you can't go wrong with the Nord.

Basically, the food is great and the service was fast."}
{"text":"Rosallie Le French Cafe is one of my favorite places to just take a break. The atmosphere is quiet and cozy. The customer service is very friendly. And of course it doesn't hurt to have an assortment of baked goods, sandwiches, teas and coffee drinks, and so on. It always smells great inside.

One of my favorite items here is the Centre it's their delicious tasting chicken sandwich. I've had this many times. My only complaint would be that occasionally the bun is harder than I preferred. Another favorite is the Creme Brulee Latte served hot. I just enjoy it so much. 

Honestly everything I've tried here I've enjoyed so if you're in the area you should definitely check it out. Just don't bring everyone with you because it's not a huge place and the last time I was there all tables were taken. I'd be back for sure."}
{"text":"Awesome place for coffee and pastries. Makes you forget you're in Vegas, which can be a nice get away."}
{"text":"Rainy days always put me in a mood for lattes and croissants and since this is only a couple of minutes away from us we decided to come over and enjoy some lunch. As always; I loved it ! There was a friendly young lady behind the counter and freshly baked goods. I had the ham/cheese croissant was accompanied with a salad and they were both delicious :-)"}
{"text":"I am french and going to Rosalie i feel like at home!!!
The owner is passionate about his work and bring a good ambiance in this cute french bakery, the service is excellent and as a french we have a lot of expectations in a good customer service!!
I support this clean bakery!!!"}
{"text":"Totally blown away. Charming decor, fantastic atmosphere and wonderful food. Every other breakfast/brunch place we have found out here is fried chicken next to biscuits and gravy. Trying to avoid 2000 calories in a single meal isn't difficult where I come from, so it was a relief to find a place with options that don't make you hate yourself later in the day."}
{"text":"Awesome coffee and French treats and breakfast.
We had  crème brûlée specialty coffee and a regular latte,  plain croissant and a vegetable quiche which was served with some greens all the items we had were excellent and I can't  wait to go back. 
 The staff could use more knowledge of items being sold but did not take away from the experience. 
  Not a place you would go for ambience but if you're looking for Great coffee,  pastries and breakfast you have found the place!"}
{"text":"Love this little hidden French cafe ! The coffee is amazing and the pastries are to die for. The owner is really sweet and has done a wonderful job on making you feel like your in Paris. They also do wine and a charcuterie broad with a nice selection of cheeses. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys coffee as much as I do."}
{"text":"I'd heard such good reports about this place that I had to give it a try, and I'm glad I did. I went early on a Saturday morning when the traffic was light and the restaurant was empty--perfect. I had an Almond Croissant and it was wonderful--flaky and light and a little sweet and I could have eaten four of them. The coffee was a little strong for my taste, but it was nice to be able to have available some chocolate and cinnamon to sprinkle into it and with some cream it was almost like a mocha latte. I also tried a bite of the walnut pie and it was as good as many of the reviews say it is."}
{"text":"I drive pass Rosallie about 10 times a week! I've been wanting to try this place since it opened, and I'm glad I finally did. My girlfriend and I got there around 4pm, there was 2 other tables lounging around on their laptops. I was starring at the menu like a deer in headlights. Confused and overwhelmed with their menu. I asked the gentleman behind the counter to recommend and explain some of  the popular lunch items. The first thing I knew I wanted to order was their almond pie, but unfortunately I came too late that day and they had already sold out. I asked about the soup of the day, and again..... No more soup! :( 
I finally settled and ordered: 
Chèvre Chaud (goat cheese pastry) Salad with a piece of melted Brie cheese. IF YOUR ARE A CHEESE LOVER... YOU WILL FALL INLOVE WITH THIS!!! I had two is my favorite cheeses together on one plate! It was heavenly!!!! 
My gf ordered a Brie sand which. She said it was also really good! 
I can't wait to go back and try other dishes! Maybe next time I should go earlier, before I'm too late again!"}
{"text":"The pastries here are to die for! The owner is super nice and takes care of his customers. Downside is the place is often so busy they don't have time to keep the tables and floor super clean. Staff is friendly! About to try my fist sandwich here. REALLY looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"One of the cutest cafe that I have ever been to. it is located off of the strip in a spacious center. The food here is really good. I thoroughly enjoyed all the food that I ate here. The Decor is so cute and very French. Their quiche is soft and airy, like an egg soufflé. The nord, which is basically a salted salmon sandwich taste really refreshing. The latte was good, but I wished it had more of a coffee taste. The charcuterie plate was awesome, however, I would have preferred pâté on it versus two variety of cheese. The chocolate croissants was yummy and flaky.  I can't wait to go back to this place."}
{"text":"Sandwiches and coffee are so good. It was worth driving for 30 minutes to get there.  Owner of the cafe was very friendly and pleasant, but not his employees unfortunately."}
{"text":"I crave the food and pastries from here. It's the best French Cafe in Vegas. Highly recommend the quiche and ALL the pastries. I always take some to go. Too many delicious items!"}
{"text":"Wow! The almond croissant and the crème brûlée latte are fantastic. We also had a plate with toast and jam that was also very good. We really enjoyed our experience here and will be back often!"}
{"text":"This is a charming cafe with wonderful food!  We had croissants, truffles and a 'pizza' made with puff pastry served with fresh, heirloom tomatoes.  So good and fresh and much less expensive then we expected.  We will be regulars there!"}
{"text":"I like what they've built here. They're trying something that is unique (in Las Vegas at least). A French style cafe. I wish they'd gone farther and replaced the old flooring and boring white ceiling tile. The display area is nicely done and the baked items are impressive. I don't know if they bake them here or not but this is the difference between small shop and Starbucks \"baked\" goods. The quiche wasn't the best but the eggs au gratin was tasty. Lattes are good. Not quite perfect yet but better than Starbucks. Would recommend trying this place out if you're on west side."}
{"text":"I think I'm in love with this little get-away from Vegas.
It's a good place for studying or socializing meals (and a plus with occasional French songs mixed Bubble-like songs, along with some French customers having their conversation). 

Plugs are almost everywhere. Large window areas that brightens up the place. All tables are spacious from each other.
There's a section with lounge chairs, and another table area that's to itself (great for group with a window wall).
Bring headphone if you're studying in case there's a crowd like my current visit ( they're pretty loud being social and fun, but everything else is pretty calm )...
There's patio seating, and I don't see any umbrellas.

The counter area is filled with pastry options (They're huge too!) you don't normally see, like Meringue bags.
All teas are leaves/Herbal/it's not from a tea bags.
They have smoothies and wine selections (they have a little glass wine room...it's so cute!)
Their sandwiches are HUGE. The Chipotle chicken was delicious and excellent in quality (I ate half and now I have dinner also)."}
{"text":"Great coffee, sandwiches, and pastries. Chocolate almond croissant would be my go to pastry."}
{"text":"It's a cute French cafe to have a small brunch or finish some work! The way they decorated their cafe is very welcoming and bright! Their croissant sandwich was quite delicious, which came with a salad too! Their Creme brûlée latte was also really good! Not too sweet & not too bitter! Just right! If you do study or want to focus, the morning and after brunch time is quieter!"}
{"text":"We discovered this cute cafe about 4 months ago, and we have been back almost every weekend. Their pastries and croissant are always fresh and delicious. We also love all of the sandwiches. The staff is always friendly and smiling. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"05/19/2018 couple days ago I ordered my friend birthday cake. We are both french and I wanted a traditional french cake for her special day :)
Ordered a fraisier for 20
Thé Fraisier was gorgeous, the Chef Pastry did such a beautiful detailed job! Chocolate butterflies, strawberries cut like little rose and added some sliced almond around the cake. BEAUTIFUL, gorgeous and Delicious!
If you order in advance you can talk to the Pastey Chef and he can bake anything you wish!!! Next time I will order a Napoleon!!!
Very pleased with the birthday cake, guest enjoyed it and we only left a slice for birthday girl breakfast (damned it lol)
It was light, flavorful. Feel like we were eating clouds of strawberries

 Tomorrow when you wake up you must try this French Bakery on Rainbow and Patrick (near 215)
the decor is very frenchy, cozy and well decorated.
Pastries are fresh and baked there!
I enjoy there selection of teas. 
instead of going get some pastries at Jean Philippe, try this great place outside the strip.
This morning I ordered some pastries for my office since it was Christmas! Team was all excited and devoured the croissant, apple turn over, chocolate croissant...

 bon appeti"}
{"text":"My favorite place to sip an early morning craving for a very tasteful espresso
Love it everytime!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best croissants in town! I normally wouldn't tell anyone because I want to keep this place to myself. 
Most authentic French place for lunch and breakfast. Modern and fresh decor, perfect for party or luncheon. 
Super friendly staff. Don't pass this place up! 
Open early."}
{"text":"Their Rosallie croque is great, caramelized onions in a Béchamel sauce with ham .... mmmmmmm!
Great looking deserts! Great cappuccino!
Their meat plate is pretty good too!"}
{"text":"I went here over the Memorial Day weekend and was very happy to see another French cafe pop up on the Westside. We had just eaten at Baguette Cafe the day before (still one of my favorite spots), so I tried to replicate my usual order at Rosallie to compare. I got their Quiche Lorraine, which was not as bacon-y as Baguette Cafe's, but came with a generous portion of salad and featured very fluffy eggs. Not too much actual bacon in the piece we got, so I might opt for a different quiche in the future. My husband devoured his Nord sandwich (smoked salmon, cucumber, sweet onions and capers, but I was able to sneak in a bite or two and loved it as well. The salmon portion and the salad portion again was very  generous with this order. The bread paired so well with all the other ingredients and was at the right temperature to enjoy the sandwich. My husband was still thinking about how delicious it was the next day. We ordered a cup of the French Onion Soup, which I would not get in the future - watery and lacking in cheese, definitely not the hearty and rich bowls of soup I'm used to seeing, but good if you did need something milder in flavor. The Nutella croissant was a big highlight for me and so hard not to devour before the rest of my food actually came. Nutella is drizzled on the outside and there's so much oozing from the inside within the perfectly flaky croissant crust. I'm not a big coffee drinker, so I opted for the peach iced tea, which I will pass on in the future. They had a hot chocolate though that I'm curious about for next time. 

The restaurant itself was very spacious, the cashier assisting us was very friendly, and the owner checked in on every table that was there. As others have mentioned, signage says \"Le French Cafe\" instead of \"Rosallie\" so it's easy to miss. If you find yourself at Jaburritos, definitely pop into this place and pick up a pastry for dessert!"}
{"text":"I love the coffee here! You can get almond milk lattes, a definite plus since regular milk makes my stomach hurt. I'm not dairy free though....love the onion tart! I am honestly not sure what it's  called, but it was a puff pastry with caramelized onions and cheese. French pizza, delish! 

My favorite pastry is the almond croissant. You can taste the butter and it's very authentic. 

Jonathan, the owner, is often present and he is just so warm, welcoming, and does everything right. Customer service is top notch."}
{"text":"Boom! I'm going a FULL 5 stars for Rosallie everything here us delicious, presented lovely, the service is great, atmosphere is perfect. 

I love that they have a good selection of leaf tea and serve it in a French press so you always get more than enough. 

I could go into the freshness of everything but no need to go there what else would you expect from a classy, busy bistro? I'm just glad they are 10 miles away from me. I could easily spend to much time here."}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite! Amazing coffee and pastries - everything we tried was fantastic and the ambiance is super cute. I can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We loved our breakfast here so much that we came back for lunch!!! Our church, nearby, was having an all day conference so we stopped by here on our way, for breakfast. We shared the Croque Rosallie,  and it was absolutely delicious! Such flavor! And the croissant was so buttery and flakey! We enjoyed it so much, that we decided to go back for lunch! This time we shared the Centre sandwich...again, wonderful flavors and the homemade bread it is on just totally makes it amazing! We also shared the Quiche Chevre which was delectable...so light and creamy, with an excellent flavor and perfect crust! We also love their balsamic salad dressing! Can't wait to try more menu items from this place! The decor is cute and quaint. I just wish they had some soup on their menu...to me a nice cup of homemade soup is the perfect companion to a sandwich or salad!"}
{"text":"This place is an awesome little hang out! really cool bookshelf if you have some time to chill and have an amazing cup of coffee or tea and some amazing pastries!"}
{"text":"Rosallie Le French Cafe, really impressed me!!
The bakery is much tasty than in France!!
The sandwiches, excellent quality, fair price, everything home made!!
The cappuccino , is the best in town!!!
Extraordinary place, congratulations to the expert chef!!!"}
{"text":"This place makes the best quiche I've tasted yet! And the staff has always been very polite and helpful."}
{"text":"We really enjoy our relaxing, not rushed visits to Rosalie! The croissants are delicious! The tasty lattes are served in nice cups. I wish it were closer to our southeast home home as we'd be there much more frequently, but our occasional visits are certainly worth the extra drive."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, cashier is very pleasant and helpful. House coffee and creme brulee ice blend are very good and the croissant we ordered is very flaky and not too sweet, just the way we like it. I would definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"I absolutely love places like this...it brings culture to a city dominated by big corporate chains. The decor and eating area was  open and pleasant. I ordered the duck confit sandwich with some island berry tea. The sandwich was absolutely delicious with some in store fresh made multi grain bread, and the tea was a perfect compliment to a great lunch in such a quaint little French cafe. While we were eating the chef/owner stopped by our table to talk for a moment about the food and how we liked the place. He had an accent, so I can only assume that the food is authentic. Either way it was delicious and he was extremely friendly. I will definitely go back to try some of the other options on the menu, as well as recommend this cafe to friends. Check it out, I'm sure you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"I heard brunch at Rosalie's was fantastic.  Didn't visit for that particularly; but I did attend a wine and cheese tasting with some senior elites.  Very enjoyable!

For the cost you get two wine tastings and all the cheese types you want, pick your own breads and crackers & fruit (grapes).  The tasting is about 1/3 glass full.  You can order a bottle or full glass if you wish.

After trying to be a connoisseur, and chatting up or listening to funny and great stories, you may start feeling full.  Those carbs do their expansion thing in the bellies pretty good.

Food for thought: Why in the world do the best tasting cheeses stink like heck though?  Swish with wine and don't talk directly at someone :P

Nice thing about the space in Rosalie is the cafe environment.  Yeah a bookshelf and comfy corner is in there.  But for big groups of 8-10 it's easy to pull tables and chairs together for a family gathering feel.

I recommend the tastings.  Keep a watch out for their postings on their tasting events."}
{"text":"Easily the best croissant I've ever had in Vegas, and I've been to every single French bakery in the valley. Their coffee is really good, smooth, and strong. 

I wish they had a bigger selection of pastries though. They have 2-3 tarts which didn't look too appealing and a handful of other things. I need more goodies to choose from! 

The only reason I'm not giving the full 5 starts which they completely deserve is because twice I've been overcharged for my order. Today I finally realized it was around $9.4 for my drink and croissant which didn't add up to the prices on the board--but it was the same amount I was charged the week prior. They reversed the charge and after calculating with tax, I still don't think I was charged correctly. I'm going to come back when I'm in the area, but will make sure to pull out my calculator when checking out."}
{"text":"I never knew this place existed and I must have drove by it once a week for over a month! My friend and I were driving around trying to figure out what to eat when I found this place on Yelp. I'm so glad I did! 
I had the nord sandwich and a pressed coffee. Both were delicious....especially the coffee. I tried a bite of the almond chocolate tort and oh my goodness it was like heaven! 
This little restaurant/cafe had some really good looking pastries and even a wine bar. I can't wait till the weekend so I can go here again!"}
{"text":"It's ok.... I've been to other French Bakeries in town with better service, better prices.... although the the interior is nice & the food is good."}
{"text":"Fantastic venue in southeast Vegas. Large dining area with fantastic baked goods and lunch and breakfast offerings.  They serve coffee, beer, wine, and a quaint menu. They also have bottomless mimosas apparently everyday which is an awesome addition to any French bistro. No outdoor seating area but plenty of comfort and space indoors. 

I came early one morning to fuel up and was immediately greeted and served by friendly staff working diligently to sculpt fresh bread and cook up tasty pastries. I ordered a croissant and coffee but really wish I paleo ordered a sandwich to go as they looked fantastic. Not to mention the free samples of almond croissants at the counter which I would never say no to.

Prices are typical for quality but still won't set you over $10 to get full and fulfilled. Rosalie's is a top notch French bakery. A must if you're craving freshness and you're in the area."}
{"text":"I've not traveled to France (yet), but I imagine with the exceptional pastries I recently sampled and the Hazelnut Praline latte cup of perfection - Rosalie captures the essence of an authentic French cafe! The delicate eggs augratin baked and cheesy was savory and fulfilling. The puffy and fluffy Madelines were lightly sweet and just the right compliment to a latte. Their chocolate almond croissant was crispy on the outside and heavenly on the inside - best I've ever had! I look forward to spending my mornings here whether sit down or grab-n-go!"}
{"text":"Rosallie was awesome & friendly! The food is great! Nutella & almond croissant was amazing!:) detox tea was yummmy!!!! :)"}
{"text":"The chocolate almond croissant was like a gift from heaven!  The perfect amount of crisp, sweet, and creamy chocolate filled center. Accompanied by the regular brewed coffee, it was the perfect start to my day!  The service was good but not quite 5 stars.  I will be back."}
{"text":"I would say we eat here regularly and the food and ambiance is quite good. However, coming here to have a coffee in a coffee mug seems to be too much to ask. Coffee out a paper cup when you are not on the go is simply not a good customer experience. Sorry, no excuses."}
{"text":"First time here and the coffee was amazing. I got the peppermint mocha and my boyfriend got the chocolate truffle. We both got sandwiches and thought they had too much cheese but it was still good! Haven't tried any of the tea or pastries yet but I'll come back and try it again!"}
{"text":"The chocolate croissant is excellent. I've never had one better. It's buttery, flaky, delicate, and filled with just enough sweetness. The almond croissant is different than any other in town. The denser, crunchier exterior may surprise some, but the flavors are still excellent. Many have raved about the walnut pie and I can confirm that it is excellent. It has such a subtle sweetness that makes it perfectly acceptable to eat for breakfast. Macarons are perfection. Delicate, crispy exteriors that give way to chewy and light interiors. On the sweeter side, their chocolate raspberry tart is pure, creamy chocolate overload with hints of tartness."}
{"text":"I first visited Rosallie for a Cheese and Wine Event they were having. It was $26 per person and we got 2 glasses of wine each, a plate with a variety of cheeses on it as well different breads and some grapes. I came with a group of friends and we all enjoyed learning about the different types of cheeses that the owner, Jonathan, had on display and plated for us. Staff here is very friendly and inside is spacious enough to accommodate small and large groups. I arrange brunch often with a group of friends and since I enjoyed the Cheese and Wine Event, I decided to choose Rosallie for our next brunch meet up. 

Jose was great about reserving and pushing tables together to accommodate our brunch. For the most part everyone enjoyed their food with the only complaints being from a few who got some of the sandwiches and felt the bread was too hard. Some commented that they have had the sandwiches before from here and it was softer and that the bread appeared to be a different kind than they had on previous visits. All of our orders came out quick except for the last few, which sat behind the counter plated for far too long. I personally went to the counter and asked Jose if those plates were for people in my group and he said \"yes it's coming right out\" so I went back and told the people waiting what he said. Several minutes later the food still hadn't arrived, so I got up again to ask what was going on and noticed the plates of food still just sitting there. At this point I said \"I can deliver these plates if it means they get their order\" and he quickly picked up the plates and brought them to our table. I believe he meant well, but with a new girl working who was having all of us point out what we wanted from the paper menu because she wasn't familiar with the menu items, it seemed to leave him trying to pick up the slack. This is a known popular spot, especially on Sundays, so having the right amount of knowledgeable/dependable staff is important.

Macarons ($12 for a dozen) - I'm not a huge fan of these in general, but I know others love them (shout out to Rohlin A.!) so I figured they would be nice to put on the table for my guests to snack on. They seemed to be well liked by everyone with some people going back to try other flavors. 

White Truffle Latte ($5.50 large) - The latte art was super cute, but the flavor was a bit too intense and not even lightly sweet like I'd hoped from the white chocolate. Wouldn't personally order the white truffle latte again. I also had a Hot Chocolate ($4.60 large) and it was delicious and chocolaty!  

Petit Déjeuner ($9.99) - Toasted French Bread, Butter, Homemade Jams and your choice of a Croissant or Chocolate Croissant with Orange Juice and any large drink of your choice. Yes, you get 2 drinks with this one. This is a very fair price for what you get, if you get the order correctly. I picked a chocolate croissant and got a regular one, so that was a bummer. Also the menu says you can choose any large drink, so I ordered a hot chocolate since the first one was so good except this time it was a smaller size than the first one. Not a huge deal, but getting the order right and serving what the menu describes should happen. Croissant, bread and jams were very tasty. 

Croque Rosallie ($8.30) - Paris Ham, Sweet Onion Bechamel and Mozzarella Cheese on a Croissant. This tasted so good! I shared half with hubby and didn't like doing so because I wanted to eat the whole thing myself it was that good. I'd for sure order this again and recommend others try it. 

They have a patio area with tables outside. You can check their Facebook page for updates on future events."}
{"text":"This place is cute. The menus a little odd and out of place for a place that serves breakfast. The service was very slow while business was slow at the same time. The coffee is really good but I probably won't come back."}
{"text":"It really makes me sad to write because the visit before this one was good but this was so bad we won't go back now.  We ordered 2 chicken sandwiches on croissants.  The last time it was a chicken breast.  This time it was pieces of chicken fatty...grissle..hard dried end pieces..it was disgusting like they ran out and just threw it together.  The lettuce was not fresh and thrown on in clumps.  They ran out of mayo so if you didn't want Chipotle which was hot or pesto you were out of luck.  The side salad was swimming in dressing making the croissant soggy. They normally have great ones..not this time. We didn't have time to change it or address it or we would have.  We ate what we could and left.  It was $19 for a terrible lunch."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times to try the drinks. I am a caffeine lover & always up to try new places. The creme brulee latte is delish!!! I will keep on coming & trying different drinks. 

The service I received was ok. A couple of young girls assisted me the first time & though they were nice, they still need more customer service experience; and one was dressed super casual: jeans & tank top. I did not know she was an employees until she got behind the counter."}
{"text":"I went to Rosallie for lunch today with a coworker. I am currently trying to eat a low-carb diet, and even though this is a French bakery, they were able to make me a fantastic salad with ham and cheese and a house made vinaigrette. Technically, the salad was also supposed to have egg, but it's not a big deal that they left it off. Their iced tea made with Earl Grey tea leaves was fantastic. I had a small bite of my friends croissant and it was probably the best croissant I've ever had. My total check for an iced tea and a salad was $10 and change. Considering the quality and the freshness, I thought this was a great deal. The service was also very good, and if this matters to you like it matters to me, their bathroom was clean and well lit."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident today because Jabburitos was closed. I glad my wife and I went in to check the place out. Our food was delicious and the service was fabulous. I hope I'm spelling Cristoff's name right. He has the perfect French Cafe for breakfast and Lunch to dine at off the Strip without the Strip's outrageous prices. It's a must place to try for everyone."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places for lunch. I always order the vegetable quiche and it never disappoints. The portion size is quite large and the accompanying salad is always fresh and crisp. My husband enjoys their sandwiches, the amount of greens on the sandwiches always shock me. I always feel good about what I ordered when I leave here. 

However on the way out be sure to grab an almond croissant. Their almond croissants are the best I've ever had and not just in Las Vegas but ever ! I have no doubt you will be very happy with your experience at Rosalie."}
{"text":"This is a nice French cafe with delicious food!

The decor is very cute, restaurant is quite spacious, food comes out at a reasonable time, and there's even a lounge area if you want to read a book & drink coffee.

I ordered the Creme Brûlée Latte & Quiche Tartiflette ($8.90), and both were delicious!

I'd definitely come back here =)"}
{"text":"Great french cuisine, way better than Paris Casino restaurants..... 
this is a cute little hole in wall, you might just bump into it and think it's no big deal..... but you are wrong

At Rosalie, you taste real french signature flavors. All their ingredients are French 

Their coffee and variety of teas is done French press. So many little hoodies to eat, make in their kitchen from scratch...Yummy place for breakfast or nice evening hang out away fri. The crazy casinos."}
{"text":"Amazing French desserts. We had a chocolate cake and asked the cashier if he can add raspberry sauce it was a great combinations. Friendly staff"}
{"text":"Delicious!! A little in the pricey side but worth it to support the sweet owner and a small business in general. Haven't tried their savory menu yet. Have tried their croissants, cookies, coffee and teas. All of which are amazing! Highly recommend the Almond croissant!! So good!!"}
{"text":"If your opened till 6pm why do you deny service. All we wanted was a cappuccino to go!!! If you don't serve people till 6pm please chaNGE the sign and make it say \" NO SERVICE AFTER 5:45PM \"  Sad service what a way to loose customers!!!!! This was Sunday afternoon. Not to mention we come by 3 times a week!!!!"}
{"text":"I think maybe the build up was too big for me.  From all I heard this was the real deal and I could get food like I did in Lyon,France.  Not even close.   It wasn't bad just not as expected (especially when I got the wrong dessert!)

I am going to go back for just bread and butter.  If they can match the French in that I will be happy.   Also... sometimes a so-so experience can be a bad day or a bad menu voice that day.

You order at a counter and they bring the food to you... make sure to grab silverware in an odd spot because my dining partner had to ask for them with main ladies Mfg and then again with dessert"}
{"text":"Family owned! I love this place. I usually order the Chicken Chipotle Sandwich. Finger Lickin' Goodness! Yummy! This place is sit down for sure; you can't rush! This environment is to relax and enjoy yourself and your company! It's not fast food!"}
{"text":"The cappuccino is frothy and the quiche was pretty good. The restaurant needs a makeover but still cute. I'm definitely looking forward to going back and trying their pastries."}
{"text":"Cute place we really wanted to love it as my family is french and we live down the street. We got the croque Rosalie - was ok and improperly reheated ( cold in the middle)- served with some wilted tomotoes. I got the French onion soup - bowl was $6.. not 1 shred of cheese in it just some croutons floating on top?! The cheese is the thing about french onion I love most so very disappointed .All the tables we tried to sit st were dirty and hadn't been wiped down . I don't think we will be back although there is good potential - management needs to step it up ."}
{"text":"Visit this place with my best friend coffee was great the place  was great love the decor everything really really came together...one thing that wasn't really working is the person on the counter who seem like she was having a real  bad day  very dry didn't even ask is if there's anything else we needed or if everything was OK I guess all I'm saying is if ur going to run a business you need to have an employee that perhaps is happy to be there... Just saying"}
{"text":"We had an excellent breakfast. The pastries, coffee, and hot breakfast items were all excellent. Had we not found a place we liked better elsewhere in town, this would have easily been the best.
I've started writing several sets of comments, and none of them worked. This place is what it is. Very good. Nice selection. Good food. I can't figure anything else to say that works."}
{"text":"What a lovely place for a great cup of coffee and a light breakfast! Nice ambiance, great service!"}
{"text":"I have been to Rosallie a number of times and it's such a fine place to go for a coffee and pastry or something more substantial such a a sandwich with a small salad.

Today, I had quiche Lorraine and a large latte.  The late lunch/early dinner was just perfect.  The quiche was perfect, the latte tasty, and service was excellent.

I got a piece of walnut pie to bring home for later but later came sooner than I had planned.  It was very good.

I'll be back many times."}
{"text":"Rosallie cafe was a very good surprise. The salad chevre chaud was declicious and the coffee amazing.
Jonnathan the owner is very nice and very helpful. 
One of my favorite coffee / lunch place."}
{"text":"This bakery has the BEST lemon meringue & almond croissants I have ever in my life tasted! It is also such a cute cafe! I'm obsessed! Thank you to my boss for bringing me here!"}
{"text":"We stopped in for a late lunch on Sunday. There were no tables to be found but we waited by a dirty one and put it together with another one. It took awhile to get the plates cleared. They were a little busy. 

We had a Brie and pesto sandwich, a prosciutto and mozzarella sandwich and a ham and cheese croissant. They were all served with salad with teardrop tomatoes, shredded carrots and a yummy balsamic vinaigrette. There was no shortage of greens. The sandwiches were piled high with greens as well. Both sandwiches were delicious and served on fresh baked bread. The prosciutto and mozzarella with peppers was slightly superior. It had a little more balance. The Brie sandwich was tasty...rich and stinky with lots of melty Brie.  They were both a mess and absolutely impossible to eat without looking like a savage. 

The menu is simple but sufficient. There's 4-5 sandwiches, 3 salads, quiche, soup and of course goodies. I had a scrumptious hazelnut praline latte. It was not too sweet and, of course, had a pretty heart in the inch of rich foam. 

The food took longer than necessary to come out. But, again, they were busy. It's cute inside for sure. There's more seating than your average French bakery. 

Food was good abs I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Four stars for the pastry, zero stars for poor management.

Decided to visit Rosallie because of the article I read in Las Vegas Weekly.
We ordered to cups of coffee, \"Late\". and two pieces of pastry. ($12.25)
We were given a number and was told the coffee would be sent over to our table shortly.
The pastry was delicious.  After waiting at least ten minutes for the coffee, I want back to the check on it and the gal behind the desk told me that she is very busy and our coffee would take another ten to fifteen minutes.
Apparently the owner is an excellent baker but is clueless about running this type of business.
I don't know anyone that wants to wait 20+ minutes for coffee. Not me!"}
{"text":"Went there on a recommendation from a friend. I was surprised because the ambiance is very dreary, no warmth to the room. We ordered and it was delivered in a timely manner. The food was not pleasant to look at and as everyone knows  you eat with your eyes first! I had the Quiche Lorraine, when it arrived the top was completely burned and in their defense I did not send it back. I scraped the burnt part off the top, the remainder was very good, the crust and eggs adequate. I spoke with two of the employees about the dish being burned and they just \"blew me off\" one actually said that it HAD to be burned so the middle would be done??? Ludicrous! No apology or offering to make it right. They do have great lattes, with very artful designs and very tasty! As we sat and stayed for quite a long time because we were celebrating a birthday, the smell of burning food was very pervasive! That was a constant smell all the time that we were there. I will not and cannot ever recommend this place due to the complete lack of trying to please the customer and the terrible burning smell of food!!"}
{"text":"I read somewhere that Rosallie had the best macarons in town, so we set off for the west side to judge for ourselves. First off, it's a lot more than JUST a bakery. Rosallie has a full menu of salads, sandwiches, and French cafe-type things like quiche. They also do wine by the glass, and selection seemed above average at a quick glance. 
The ambiance is cute, and they've managed to make it cozier than its strip mall location suggests, including a free phone charging station, wifi, and lots of books. Prices were pretty high for desserts, but I kinda expected that: ~$1 each for the mini macarons or medium sized sugar cookies. 

Most important: the macarons are delicious. We most enjoyed the caramel and pistachio, but lemon and raspberry were also delicious. 

My complaints: macarons are only available in a multi pack of 12, including 2 chocolate, which we really didn't like at all. It would be great to be able to buy singles or at least set our own variety. Second, while they have a wide selection of loose teas, they don't really have any specialty tea drinks. 

Overall, a super cute place with delicious cookies."}
{"text":"Always looking for a good French bakery. I had the 3 cheese and ham croissant.  It was really good. The coffee was pretty good as well. I had iced vanilla latte. Great atmosphere and good value. A little far from home but I will be back.  Omg I went back up for the almond croissant. It was unbelievably good. So delicious."}
{"text":"The white truffle coffee is amazing but their prices are too high for the quality of food that they served."}
{"text":"Cute lil French cafe! I love their pastries and coffee! My bf and I went here a couple times so far and there was never a let down. They have a variety of different types of flavored coffee. We enjoyed their hazelnut praline.Their menu is quite unique compared to other French cafes in town. Great spot for breakfast and brunch! Oh and don't forget to try their chocolate croissant so good!"}
{"text":"[UPDATE 8/20/17: The owner did see this; I received a private message. I stand by my praise of various foods in this and prior reviews and my criticism of the service on this particular day. I will return and hope for a positive experience so that I can write a better review then, but I won't change my rating as of this time.]

Look, it's plain and simple. They fucked up.

I'm usually not so harsh on my ratings or reviews, but I think my dining companions were being far too generous to Rosallie based on their experiences, so I'm willing to drop the hammer with the justification that yes, \"I've experienced better.\" I have little sympathy when two employees look at the register and at the pastry case and then enter the wrong order in, which cost less and probably tasted worse than the item which I'd intended to order, so I'm not mincing words. (To be fair, it doesn't appear that the business owners use Yelp, but I still want to make sure that we're collectively making enough noise to be heard.)

For what it's worth, the food is quite good when they get it right. I've made a fair amount of visits without really bothering to update my review because my rating hadn't changed much, but I recall such pastries as the Madeleine ($1.50 last I checked) and Pumpkin Cannoli ($3.50, maybe seasonal) being quite delicious, and the Canelé ($1.75) was pretty good if a little small. The Croque Rosallie ($7.90 then, reportedly now $8.30) was also a very strong breakfast sandwich when I had it last year, with a ham, onion, and mozzarella in a halved croissant, plus a fresh salad with a nice dressing and some delicious sliced oranges served as the garnish.

On my visit last weekend, I also highly enjoyed the Normandie Tartine ($9.20), which is more of a layered dough flatbread than an open-faced sandwich here. The Normandie in particular has Brie, onion, and tomato, with a small side salad and a little bowl with additional tomato.

It was pretty obvious that they were struggling with the huge crowd though, and the lack of knowledge of the food / register caused them to ring me up for an Opera cake ($4.90) rather than a passion fruit cake ($4.10) that I'd seen in the case. I didn't look at my receipt until after receiving my cake because I'd assumed that they'd gotten it right after taking their time, but they didn't, and I sighed and ate the cake anyway because it would've gone to waste otherwise. It's not a bad cake, with plenty of chocolate and coffee flavor, although I wasn't a fan of the ground nuts in one of the layers. It wasn't especially memorable in flavor intensity or sweetness though.

The double-shot espresso ($2.50) tasted fine and had sufficient caffeine, but it wasn't served piping hot. I found that odd at the time but shrugged and enjoyed not burning my tongue. I don't think that's how it's supposed to be presented though...

Thanks to Christie L. for letting me try a Chocolate Macaron (part of a $12/12 pc. tray). It's smaller than typical macarons and didn't have all that much chocolate flavor, but the textures were fine. However, I would rather save my macaron investment for a place with unique flavors, like Suzuya.

And for that matter, I'm able to get much more stunning and properly identified savory and sweet food at places like Cafe Breizh, or the various patisseries on the Strip. They know what they're doing.

Would I come back to Rosallie? Yes, probably. I'll have to watch everything like a hawk though and I sure as heck won't show up for a Sunday brunch (unless Christie organizes it again, then I'd say yes). They were fine when I visited at times during which they weren't so busy. Let's hope that the owners haven't forgotten about us in the midst of their Florida expansion."}
{"text":"First visit. Will come back again. Food was great. The hot French press green peach tea was the highlight today. Relaxing. Free wifi. Cafe feel with a small outdoor patio."}
{"text":"This is a nice place for a French meal. Desserts are flavorful. Croissants are flaky and golden. Signature lattes are delicious. Everything here is so good. Bring your appetite when you come! Easy to spend $30 between two people!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere is chill and inviting. On the pricier side for some items. Staff are friendly and greet you quickly on arrival. Matcha Latte blended was way too sweet for my liking. Walnut tarte was delicious and a little flaky. Croissants were fresh and crisp in all the right ways."}
{"text":"lunch with a friend today was absolutely delicious!!  Croque Rosalie is new and certainly should remain on their menu.  Love, love love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I've been coming here pretty regularly since last year. Charcuterie Plate, Quiche, Coffee... Everything is delicious, every time. One of my favorite local spots for a quiet, romantic breakfast. Definitely a keeper!"}
{"text":"About time I reviewed this place since I come here every week after work in the morning. And oh, hey! Duchess of this place after a few rounds of check-ins isn't bad either. Sweeeet. 

Arriving at the Rainbow Boulevard and Patrick Lane intersection at a small unsuspecting plaza next to Jabburitos is a quaint french brunch cafe called Rosallie. Upon entering, a look on your right and you'll see an array of shapely wooden and white marble tables. To your left are the baristas, dessert displays, tea leaves, and cursive scribbles from their chalk board wall menu. There you have it: a comfortably simple, Southern French atmosphere. Almost nine times out of ten I am greeted by a friendly barista. After placing an order, towards the back you'll notice a small sitting area with couches, more marble round tables, a charge station, and a large shelf of books for you to immerse yourself in. There is also a small see through wine cabinet called La Cave for the wine lovers out there who want their daily fix.

I always drop by for their 'Nord' in salad form instead of sandwich, sans the sweet red onions. You get a mix of the usual spring veggies, spinach, capers, sliced baby tomatoes, mandoline sliced cucumbers, carrots, topped with smoked salmon. The dressing they have on it can sometimes be salty (and somewhat sweet/citrusy?) so a request for them to keep it on the low is highly recommended if its too strong for your tastebuds. 

Oh and let's not forget their creme brûlée latte here. I quite like it; the aroma after a having a whiff of the whip always makes me happy because I honestly believe I'm sniffing a confectionary. I take a few sips of it, and the flavor is smooth, creamy, and slightly buttery but satisfying. Call me ridiculous but if they ever add strawberry or blueberry fruits next to it (or even in it), my insides would leap with joy. 

Their charcuterie isn't bad, but neither is it overtly delicious. The prosciutto was a bit dry and some cold cut meats were either salty or too chewy. A suggestion would be to add an array of cheese that best compliments the meats. Other than that I wouldn't really bat an eyelash for this and settle for a pastry instead. 

I'm a bit taken aback that I have yet to try their soups, teas, and desserts (I have a guilty sweet tooth, oh dear...), but I'll try them eventually! Apart from that, whenever I just can't be bothered to make my own, Rosallie tops for my early morning salad cravings."}
{"text":"Had such high expectations to this place! After seeing the photos from other yelpers and even in Instagram, I was dying to try the food. Unfortunately it wasn't exciting. I had the Rosalie. It arrived looking so promising and delicious, it ended up being just mediocre. You see this melted cheese, bechamel sauce, you expected the ham and croissant to be hot and toasted. So was not the case. The ham in the middle was cold, and the entire meal was warm, creating a disappointing first bite. 

I also ordered the coffee, which was decent. Nothing exciting, probably need to try the flavored espresso drinks next time.

The staff was friendly and the atmosphere is cute. I'd definitely go back again and give them another shot."}
{"text":"The desserts are excellent: Almond Croissant, Chocolate Truffle, and Macaroons. Friendly service and I can't wait til my next visit to try other items on the menu."}
{"text":"Nice bakery in Vegas, the bread is good (petit déjeuner français), prices are a little bit expensive and unfortunately no French people who work inside... The employee forgot my drinks and reversed my coffee :-/
The space and ambiance is relaxing and nice."}
{"text":"What a cute little escape from your usual Vegas restaurants. The bakery/cafe is both take out and eat in friendly. It's a very relaxed atmosphere and everyone is so friendly. They serve wine all day so no need to feel obligated to drink coffee at brunch, wine is perfectly acceptable. 
Petit de jeuner francais: BREAD BREAD BREAD. Well actually, 2 breads. The chocolate croissant is dense, not your usually fluffy barely there bread. The toasted french bread was almost a sourdough to me. The homemade jams were an A plus plus. Order this and one other plate to share!
Centre: Was the sandwich they recommended us. It was large enough to be split by 2 people and was a little more lunch, than breakfast food. The chipotle spread was nothing spicy, the cheese was light. 
Lots of fun restaurants in this plaza, but Rosallie is my new favorite in not just the plaza, but all of Rainbow!"}
{"text":"Rosalie is a cute cafe. They have a lovely French ambiance with matching music, seating, and shabby furniture. They offer an assortment of coffee and pastries, as well as quiche Lorraine, lox and other heartier options for breakfast. Very friend staff and service. I recommend one of their specialty lattes."}
{"text":"After having a disappointing experience my previous time here due to service, I still appreciate the quality of the food. I went back for coffee and pastries. Service was great. The owner remembered me upon arrival, apologized for my previous experience, and did not charge me for my macaroons. I told him it wasn't necessary for him to do that but he insisted and even gave me a complimentary assorted macaroon box. 
Aside from macaroons, I also got an almond croissant, regular croissant and an Americano. The croissant was perfect, light and flaky as it should be. The almond croissant was one of the better ones I've tried in Vegas. The macaroons are like little bites of heaven; perfect amount of filling, and the outside has a crunch to the bite but soft inside. 
Once again, I appreciate the quality and flavors of the food. This is one of the better French cafes in Vegas."}
{"text":"Rosalie just opened 2 months ago. This place is amazing. There's not a lot of local french bakery in town. Come check them out. I have yet to try their coffee so i am only giving them 4 stars. But i am definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Today was my second time visiting this cafe.  I am really trying to like it...  there were quite a few people visiting at lunch time so it seems to be popular, however, their options are so tough.  I try to eat healthy for lunch on the weekdays and their sandwiches, salads, and quiche are all on the heavier side.  I would love if they had some low fat/non fat dressing options.  Also, they only have coffee and tea for drink options... so having some non-fat milk for the coffee would be super helpful.  Their staff seem pretty helpful, however, I mentioned to them today that I had a party of 5 coming for lunch.  I had to ask them if I could move some of the chairs, tables around.  They finally came to help, however, they didn't seem too thrilled about it."}
{"text":"Horrible. 

Walked in at 10am. 3 tables say-3ppl in line. I wasn't acknowledged when I walked in and neither was the family who walked in after me. I got in line and waited, waited, and waited. Neither one of the associates looked up. You had 1 making sandwiches like it wasn't PRIME breakfast time, and the other making a coffee drink like she had never worked the machine. The women in front of me was never helped and I walked out after waiting in line for a few minutes. Get it together, pouring coffee doesn't take but seconds, and while your spreading mayo on bread you can look up and greet your guests. And put some pep in your step. It's breakfast time, your a cafe, and you aren't busy. 
Oh-and there is menu for food anywhere."}
{"text":"Authentic French café, with good quality breads and a very friendly service. Their croissants are crunchy outside and soft inside; you can choose from a selection of plain, chocolate or almond. The raisin roll was good; a little too sweet for my taste. Good coffee by our American standards, could be better by French standards (you know what I'm referring to if you had coffee in any European country). The tea selection on the other hand is pretty good: a variety of loose leaf teas nicely displayed for customers to smell before choosing."}
{"text":"It feels like such a treat to dine at Rosallie. Inside is a most cutely decorated, spacey, and comfortable eating area. Their pastry display puts me in an internal predicament knowing I don't have a large enough stomach to try every single baked good. Everything just looks so delicious!
Their sandwiches, especially the centre, are great. The bread on them has the thinnest crunchy crust and softest inside with the right amount of chewiness. Almond croissants and fruit tarts are to die for. I had the coconut white chocolate (I think) latte the three day and it was scrumptious. Will definitely come back here for breakfast while getting some work done. You should too!!"}
{"text":"What a cute bakery and café! I wish I had this bakery in my part of town. The inside is decorated nicely to fit the French theme. The dining room was clean and looked like a nice spot to hang out for awhile. I stopped in one Saturday after eating lunch in the area so I can only speak to the coffee and baked goods....for now. 

The coffee and tea menu offers a nice variety of options. Tea flavors are nicely displayed on the counter and coffees are listed out on the menu over the register. The latte menu has some special flavors for those with a sweet tooth. I went for the Crème Brulee Latte and enjoyed it very much.

The baked goods all looked for very good, but I used self control and narrowed to two items. The Pistachio Macaron had a great flavor and texture. It was the perfect size for a sweet bite with my latte. The Almond Tart had a nice flaky crust and a well flavored almond taste inside of the tart. I enjoyed both of the baked goods very much.

I'll definitely be back for breakfast or lunch. Who can pass on quiche?"}
{"text":"This review is based on one visit only. This used to be a 7-11, they did a nice job converting the space. It's simple and spacious (maybe even a little too bare and spacious). I got a few  macaroons and a tried their la madeleine cookie as well as the duck confit sandwich. The sandwich is a bit overpriced at above $12 and to be honest, it was not very good. The duck was kinda cold and dry and there wasn't much of it.  The sweets fared better. The macaroons, though small, were pretty good and reasonably priced at $1.10. I really liked the la madeleine cookie as well. Will probably be back to try some other pastries and maybe give the cheaper sandwiches a try, they are after all conveniently located close by..."}
{"text":"I have no idea why I don't come here everyday. In fact everyone in the world needs to come here everyday. The food, pastries and coffee are all incredible. Staff is always friendly. The atmosphere is super cute AND they serve wine. We all know that nothing washes a quiche down like a glass of rosé."}
{"text":"This place is hands down the best spot for breakfast or bunch in the southwest west.."}
{"text":"I wish I could give Rosallie more than 5 stars. It was that good.

Visually, Rosallie is the most adorable cafe. Clean & cute. But, beyond that it is an authentic French experience smack in the middle of Sin City.

I can't recall a time where a dining experience was SO beautiful & SO delicious that I teared up over it. But, at Rosallie, it happened. It was as if all of the stuff of my foodie dreams had magically come to fruition in one perfect moment...wine, cheese, bread, quiche, walnut tart, fig jam, honey, candied pecans, blackcurrant cocktails, macaroons. Every single bite was better than the last.

Jonathan's service and attention to detail was flawless. It is clear that he is passionate and knowledgeable about French cuisine. It showed in every aspect of our meal and it made our experience truly spectacular.

On occasion, I am impressed enough my a restaurant to where I know I will be back. But, almost never do I plan my next 2 visits before I leave or even finish my meal. I already can't wait to go back. I want to try every single thing on the menu.

Rosallie has taken a coveted spot in my \"Top 3 Best in LV\"."}
{"text":"My review is for my visit 7/9/16. (yes, I am a bit behind). This is my new favorite place for brunch. I am in love with the Quiche chevre!!! it is the tastiest thing ever, and comes with the freshest little side salad and viniagrette. It is just the right amount of food. The prices are pretty good and the atmophere is very pleasant. it is a very quaint little place with French music and decor. There is a nice variety of pastries, sandwiches, teas and coffee. 

They serve French pressed loose tea, and I decided to get some Lady earl grey French pressed hot tea. Absolutely delicious and I love the presentation.

The owner is very nice, you can tell he takes great pride in the cafe."}
{"text":"Great spread, I had the country plate and the cheese and meats were very high quality"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of trying out this cute little french cafe this past Sunday. It did not disappoint! I had the Nord which was a smoked salmon sandwich garnished with a nice salad around it with a balsamic-esque dressing. I was torn between ordering the Nord and the Sud (a prosciutto sandwich) but the lady at the counter recommended the Nord. It was filling and light at the same time, with lots of flavor. They gave you an ample amount of smoke salmon and it had kind of a slaw type garnishing in it. I can't really explain the taste but it complemented the salmon really well. It sort of reminded me of a chipotle mayo slaw. 

I also ordered their chocolate mousse brownie. It was very, very rich! It's definitely something I recommend you share with someone and also offset the sweetness with their amazing rose latte. It definitely balanced it out! I'm sure any of their lattes or coffees would compliment the chocolate mousse brownie but the Rose latte was perfection. 

What I loved most was that Rosalie had this private little area off to the side with a few tables and some reading chairs to enjoy your coffee or pastry. It was nicely decorated and cozy which went with the french cafe theme. They have real marble tables which are perfect for taking that IG worthy photo of your meal/dessert/latte. They offered a lot of different varieties of desserts and baked goods as well as tea. So there's a little something for everyone. I will definitely be going back here!"}
{"text":"The pastries are good, coffee is fresh. Staff was nice when I arrived but when I told the guy I just want a pastry and a latte. I feel he started to get annoyed. I then asked for extra shot of espresso in my latte, he turned his back and grab a cup, asked me are you sure you want three shots in this cup, then he THREW the cup back to the rack. Ok. He is so nice to bring me the latte to the table but when I say thank you sincerely to him, he stormed away ........"}
{"text":"An excellent place to relax with a tasty beverage or delicious pastry. 

The lounge was decorated with books and much too comfortable furniture.  I could have spent the entire afternoon relaxing.

The staff was friendly and efficient.  The menu is varied and reasonably priced.

This is an excellent establishment."}
{"text":"We found this joint down the road near our church, so we decided to stop by and try it out.

The sign outside says Le French Cafe.
I think they are still modeling the place because I heard some drills walking into the place.  When we walked in it was very open and welcoming.  I was drawn in my the itty bitty macaroons, costing $1.10 a pop.  Pass.....

We ordered the Ouest $12.90 and the Country plate also $12.90.  So for this price, I'm expecting a lot.  As I am looking around at everyone else's plate, I think I have already set myself up for disappointment.

There was myself and my infant daughter, so the only place we could sit was a table that had not yet been cleaned.  I had to request for the plates to be cleared for us to eat.  There were only 2 people working at the time, but its not like I would expect more for a little cafe.  

Our meals were okay, for a snack, but the prices were a bit too high for me, hence my 3 stars.  I see that there are people that reviewed their Croissants, so next time I shall try that."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. It's super cute, and not only do they have a nice ambiance, decorations, the food is super good and their tea selections are so unique and delicious. Will definitely coming back, even though I live on the other side of town. It's a great place to sit and chat with friends or even study. I am looking forward to trying their other pastries!"}
{"text":"The pastry, ( one of my favorites are the almonds and chocolate croissant), the coffee in this Cafe is second to none. The service is excellent friendly and with a smile. The atmosphere is comfortable relaxing"}
{"text":"This is a new favorite spot for my family! Everything we had was amazing! The decor set a great french scene. Great costumer service. Everything is freshly made and delicious. We can't wait to visit for wine and cheese."}
{"text":"This place has the most amazing staff. JOSE was so incredibly helpful, knowledgeable, and patient with me as I was trying to figure things out for myself. BEST customer Service i have EVER experienced here in Vegas. I will come back every time I visit just for the staff.

The food is awesome as well. The potato & bacon quiche, salad, and patties are all divine. Awesome awesome awesome place."}
{"text":"If cafes in France are anything like Rosallie, then I'm denouncing my US citizenship and joining the EU. This spot encompasses all the qualities I enjoy about small eateries: quaint, quiet and calming. The few times I've visited, I have been greeted genuinely and warmly by both the owner and his employees. The ambience is comforting, like walking into your mother's kitchen after a long day. The food is made from scratch and it speaks
for itself; if it looks appetizing, it's because it is. I've ordered almond croissants, sandwiches and black/green teas and have not once been disappointed. The cafe offers a unique variety of teas and authentic French pastries. Overall extremely pleased and more than willing to return. OFTEN! Vive la Rosallie!"}
{"text":"I've only been here twice & both for breakfast. I usually get there before 8 so it's not busy & there aren't much people in there. 

Their ham & cheese croissant was pretty good. It comes with a side of salad, which I didn't expect. The meal is a decent size and will satisfy you, or if you're like me, it'll fill you up. The chocolate almond croissant is so goooooodddd!! It's definitely worth trying. Their coffees are really really good too! 

I'm determined to come back to try all their drinks & pastries."}
{"text":"This is actually my second time to eat at this place very cozy ambiance and the counter lady is always very nice I order their famous Nord  had Pomegranate Mojito tea cold this is the closes sandwich from my favorite Lux good eats always."}
{"text":"We were again torn between ordering appetizing pastries or our usual quiches.  The quiches won out, but we did not entirely neglect the pastries, purchasing a large raspberry for dessert for later that evening.  Christophe, the new manager who previously served as the lead baker, took our orders and delivered coffee to our table.  My wife loved the tartiflete (tartiflette cheese, bacon, sauteed onions, and red potatoes) quiche as I knew she would having ordered it a few times in the past.  I went with her (previous) favorite, the chevre quiche which included spinach, goat cheese and tomatoes.  Both proved to be excellent as was the raspberry croissant that we shared later that evening.  A rating of 4.5 stars would be appropriate."}
{"text":"Cute bakery and cafe. Found it on my way to the dentist of all things. Decor is French country casual and offers breakfast and lunch. As pretty as everything was I was not greeted or offered help until I started asking for help. I think they were busy making drinks, but an acknowledgement would be nice. I bought some coconut macaroons and vanilla meringues to go. They were tasty and well made. I would of bought more goods or even a coffee drink, but was not offered even to do so. One would think it would be a basic question at the counter, but nope. After my total, I handed my credit card and the employee was looking off somewhere so I had an awkward moment where I was left hanging until I said, \" Here's my credit card.\" Maybe it was just an off day, but kinda disappointed in the service. Might come back to try again if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I Came here with the family on a Sunday morning and didn't wait long at all. We were greeted and they cleaned our table. We started off with free samples of almond croissants which were delicious. My son had the Madeleine which he enjoyed. He wanted a macaron but they only sold them by the dozen. I had the Tartine L'Americain and my wife had the Quiche. Both were  savory, and delicious. The quiche quality, texture and taste was above any others we've had around town. I had the Nutella S'mores Latte, she had the Hazelnut Praline Latte. Mine was pretty good. She said it was the best Hazelnut Latte she's ever had. They have a great variety of pastries to choose from. We will definitely be back and recommend you try it out."}
{"text":"Many visits later, Rosallie is one of my favorite places in town!

My favorite eats:
+ Nord Sandwich with smoked salmon, red onion, tomato, cucumber, capers, mixed greens, and housemade shallot spread on toasted Petite Tourte.
+ Tartine L'Americaine with hardwood smoked honey-cured bacon, cheese, and egg yolk; served with marinated cherry tomatoes.
+ Tartine L'espagnole with housemade tomato sauce, rotisserie chipotle chicken, red onion, and mozzarella.
+ Tartine La Reine with dried paris ham, mushroom, and cheese.
+ Quiche Veggie with roasted zucchini, sautéed mushroom, and sautéed onion; served with side salad.
+ Croque Rosallie: Paris ham, sweet onion béchamel, and mozzarella on croissant.

Basically all the Tartines are phenomenal; I love the flaky pastry crust and the combinations are amazing. The quiches are equally delicious and I've enjoyed all of them as well. I've just begun to venture into the sandwich offerings, but I was blown away by the Nord! The housemade shallot spread is insanely flavorful and works so well with the salmon and fresh vegetables. I love ordering a couple entrees along with a couple pastries to share with a friend or even to enjoy on my own and taking the rest home.

Favorite beverages:
+ Latte Provence (lavender and honey)
+ Crème Brûlée Latte
+ White Chocolate Coconut Latte
+ Kir Royale

All of the special latte flavors are tasty and fun. I've really taken to the Latte Provence with its perfect balance of sweet and just a tad floral. With their new wine offerings, I've had the chance to try the Kir Royale and it is wonderful!

Favorite pastries:
+ Palmier
+ Almond Croissant
+ Croissant
+ Fruit Tart
+ Macarons

The desserts are fantastic, but I'm really a fan of the breads and pastries offered. The palmiers are fantastically crispy and buttery. Also, you can't go wrong with their croissants. The macarons are great, too and I had the absolute pleasure of their delicious Pistachio and Vanilla Macarons as party favors for my last birthday.

The location is convenient, easy to access, and the space is lovely. I love bringing friends or just enjoying a treat by myself. Jonathan is brilliant and very kind; it is a great joy to have him and the Rosallie family in our community!"}
{"text":"I don't normally review places, nor do I give high ratings; if you want to try something different for brunch/lunch, travel to France, and not go to the Strip, start here you won't be disappointed for locals and visitors alike."}
{"text":"Friendly service and delicious food. The prices are reasonable for a French cafe but may be considered pricey. It's not busy and there is plenty of parking. We were there on a Saturday around 12:30 pm. It was not busy but had a steady flow of to go orders. The counter staff was friendly and efficient. The food server from the back was a little confused and had very bad English but she was very nice. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying other items. The almond croissant was flaky and buttery. The ham and cheese croissant cam with a side salad and was equally delicious. The sandwich that comes on a roll is a little too hard for my tastes, but it was still good. The fruit tart was the traditional with an almond filling rather than a custard."}
{"text":"For a city dubbed capital entertainment of the world, it is truly in lack of culture- considering how many people from around the world come here. I am originally from London and I am grateful for small business like Rosallie, who bring a profound sense of warmth, culture and tradition into the local community here. 

Rosallie for me is like stepping into a home away from home. Walking into the cozy aromas of freshly brewed coffee, the freshly baked pastries you could smell through the display, the quiet bustle you can hear from kind conversations with china plates and cups clinking in between. Samba music from the likes of Bebel Gilberto surround your thoughts. Wait a second. Where am I?

It is an escape. Whether you are catching up with a friend, or going on a first date or trying to find a good place to study. I urge you to try their Nord sandwich and Provence latte (with hints of lavender and honey) hands down best I have had! Grab a book from the bookshelf, put your phone away. Soak it all in."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant on this part of town open for breakfast.  The interior is done up authentic genuine French.  When inside if feels like you're actually in France!  The customer service here is well above average.  Sometimes they are slow to make their drinks but it's not their fault that they are popular.  It gets busy so come early.  They just need to hire an extra hand part time just for the morning rush.  The food is phenomenal and Genuine French.  They have an excellent selection of coffee and the taste and presentation are all top notch.  Definitely worth it just for the Authentic French experience"}
{"text":"Nice authentic French coffee shop in the neighborhood. When they first opened, I used to see the owner working in the kitchen, behind the counter, serving customers. Talked to him about his passion of baking, etc. Later on, he was gone. Then I never saw him again. He hired two employees to take care of his business. I'm glad he is doing well!

The little pastries are made by him, displayed nicely on the counter or in the pastry case.
Also, there are samples of tea leaves displayed on the counter under little glass domes. I never ordered tea, but  I tried their coffee.
I love hazelnut cappuccino or latte, so I ordered it.
I don't know if the coffee is not strong enough or just too much milk added to it, but it is not the best coffee I ever had. It tasted like milk. 
The chocolate croissant  is very light, good flavor.
It's much smaller size than you can find at other places. Probably I could easily eaten two of them.
The almond croissant was a little bit dry. I am sure it was just a coincidence.
The macaroons were delicious! I bought the little box containing 12 varieties of macaroons ($12.99)

I tried one of the breakfast item at one time: Quiche Lorraine (bacon) with organic greens on the side. 
That was very different from our everyday breakfast, but I liked it. It was very refreshing!
I had their fresh squeezed grapefruit juice, also I liked a lot!

Free wifi is provided. There is a password on the wall. Also complimentary lemon water customers can enjoy, can be found on the service station area, next to the condiments. 
I really like the separate section of reading area with comfortable couches. I saw people working on their laptops or reading magazines or books.
The background music is very beautiful French music. 

My recent discovery is that they are now serving wine, too!"}
{"text":"The best croissants, apple tart, and quiche in town. It doesn't get any better than this. Truly authentic."}
{"text":"They may not be the fastest game in town, but oh dear is it worth the wait. Great coffee and the food is out of this world. I'd eat there every day if I could."}
{"text":"Jonathan created a multilayered mocha birthday cake on short notice for my girlfriend that was the best cake I have ever tasted. He is a gem of generosity and commitment to excellence rare in any business."}
{"text":"Extraordinary service and impeccable flavors. Those looking with an indiscernible can even tell. My dad, who loves buffets told me to check this place out. Anything he suggests makes me assume quantity rather than quality. This place offers the most delicious quiche Loraine I have ever tasted. The delicious cup of coffee Grants the perfect rounding for the palate. In the land of imitation this is a true gem."}
{"text":"My favorite little cafe in Vegas. Try the Sud and the french press... I only wish it was closer to my house! Croissants are amazing too. Don't give into the shocking accessibility of Gnarbucks. You're better than that"}
{"text":"The atmosphere was ok, I see where they were going with the French decor... just not quite there yet.  There were about 3 different parties hanging out at the cafe.  The lady who helped us wasn't friendly and doesn't seem like she really wanted to be there.  It almost feel depressing in here.  We came here for some lattes after our dinner down the street.  They were super delicious.  I ordered a regular French Vanilla Latte and my husband got the regular White Chocolate Latte.  Both were great choices.  The French Vanilla is less sweet than the White Chocolate if you don't want something too sweet.  

We'll have to came by during the daytime to see if it's a lively environment."}
{"text":"First time here.  Came across this place because I was looking for a breakfast place open a little after 7am near the west side. Pleasant surprise. I ordered a ham & cheese croissant and also an iced latte.  Food was great. Will definitely come back again."}
{"text":"It's a nice place with good pastries but it's just waaay too over priced. 4$ for a really small pack of cookies ? That's ridiculous 
Or half a really small macaroon with a little little piece of cake the size of 2 dice almost 6$? The portions are just soo small
I do not recommend"}
{"text":"I love everything about this cute little spot! The ambience, the service, and most importantly the baked goods! It was my first time in and the staff was very patient with me as I looked over my options, and happily answered all my questions and offered suggestions. The chef even came out to talk about his lovely creations!  As a chef myself, I can totally relate to the way his face lit up when describing the pastries...that passion is rare and yet it is the most important quality in a good chef! It really shines through, you can tell when something is made with love vs just to collect a paycheck.  I loved everything I tried! I was reccomended the almond raspberry croissant, and it did not dissapoint!  It was the perfect balance of sweet and tart, with a perfectly crispy flaky exterior and a lovely moist interior.  Not dry at all! I also tried their regular almond croissant which was also lovely! These are the best stuffed croissants I have EVER had.  I also tried a madeline, which was delicious!  Who knew cake could be so tasty on its own without any frosting?! And last but not least, I tried the special easter nest cake, a lovely light cake surrounded with lovely whipped cream and topped with fruit, a maccaron, and malt eggs. It was so delicious! Not too sweet, just perfect! I love that after eating half of each item I am surprisingly not feeling heavy or bleh, like I usualy do after indulging in a lot of sweets. This leads me to believe they use real ingredients from scratch and minimally processed! I can't wait to go back and try their coffee and hot food, and alllll the pastries!"}
{"text":"Quiche Lorraine, richly flavorful but light and creamy in texture. It was accompanied by a generous field green salad. 

Almond Croissant, flaky, buttery, and full of perfectly sweet almond paste. The filling comes out of the ends while baking and forms really delicious crunchy bits. Definitely, the best croissant I've ever eaten."}
{"text":"This quaint cafe felt as though we walked into a cafe in Paris. The food was amazing! Packed with flavor. I recommend the Centre sandwich, it was sooo good. Also the macaroons are pretty dope, they come in the dozens. The girl who helped us was also super friendly and gave a great suggestion for the peach tea. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"I've been here so many times and yet I keep forgetting to tell you yelpers how much I like this place! 

Only thing I'm not a fan of are the hours. 7am - 6pm. I work a 9am-5am job, and I would LOVE to hang out here after work and have a cup of their magnificent Crème Brule! It's always my go to drink. Delicious and savory. That with a piece of their Madeleine. So yummy! 

I've also tried both of their quiche, and you wont be disappointed! It looks a little bit burnt on top, but there's no burnt taste or anything. Promise! I get them a lot. Also, try out their sandwiches! 

My two favorites: 

Quest, which is duck with their home made onion jam and butter. Scrumptious! So much flavor and so their breads are always soft! FRIKKIN YUM, MAN! 

Nord, the smoked salmon sandwich goodness! Very delectable and you can never go wrong when it comes to salmon! Their home made jam must be it too! I about cried when I took a bite of this. 

With those sandwiches, they do drown it with a generous amount of salad. All that color in one plates make it look so beautiful! 

I have also had their desserts. Macaroons, Opera, tiramisu, and parfait. All were amazing. I know I sound vague, but I'm usually not a fan or all of those and  I gobbled it all up when I did have them.

Give this place a chance! I'm a happy camper every time!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I haven't been here sooner! I always pass it on the way to Orange Theory. They put a lot of thought on the decor... Lots of fun little touches! You'll have to visit to see what I mean. The food was absolutely scrumptious, and the presentation was deliberate and stunning. The prices are reasonable and everyone was friendly. I'd most certainly go back for more!"}
{"text":"Helpful Tip: Patience 

Stopped by for a not so quick breakfast before an appointment nearby. The atmosphere is very peaceful and I'm certain by the reviews the service is probably exceptional but today that was not the case!

Everyone ahead of me had discrepancies with their order and after a ten minute wait I was asked what I ordered again. (Side Eye)

$5.30 1 Tiramisu 3/5 The chocolate pieces on top taste like refrigerator...  

$2.35 1 Croissant 5/5 
$4.50 1 Regular White Chocolate Truffle (Coffee) 5/5

Total: $13.15"}
{"text":"I'll be completely honest. 

This is our first time here, and we chose this place based on their reviews. We walked in and everything looked and smelled soooooo good.  Staff was polite and patient with us.  We ordered our food, and we were both super excited to try it.....10 minutes later, no food.....15 minutes later, no food.......20 minutes later, no food......30 minutes later, finally got our food.  

I was totally prepared to give them 3 out of 5 stars. Until the gentleman came back with a goodie bag and a deep and sincere apology.  

For me, an apology that meaningful can't be over looked. 

That being said.  The food was amazing, The energy and atmosphere was relaxing, and my wife says it's her new favorite place to go.  

There is no doubt in my mind that we will be back. 

This place earned and deserves 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place better but I only found the pastries to be okay.  Okay by Vegas standards would be quite good in Hawaii (fewer bakeries than before) but there are so many other bakeries in the Vegas area that I salivate when I think about, it doesn't seem worth getting only-ok pastries.  Maybe I haven't tried the \"right\" ones on the two visits I made."}
{"text":"What a wonderful new French restaurant. The ambiance is very lovely and welcoming. There is even a charger station for cell phones!  And the food....superb. A wonderful selection of pastries, quiches, salads and sandwiches. Portion sizes were nice and delicious. I had a classic quiche and salad and was not disappointed. The quiche was so light and not overdone with too much meat. No greasy after taste and you could tell they used quality cheeses. I will definitely be back. I can't wait to try their macaroons, my favorite cookie."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow,

This place is incredible. My new French cafe and coffee/tea spot for sure. It's sooooooo cute and roomy in here. It is on S. Rainbow and Patrick, across from the firehouse subs and tops and bottoms yogurt place.

They have a beautiful tea selection with quality loose leaf tea. None of that cheap bagged garbage. Everything is priced very reasonable and you're paying for the quality. I also got a quiche lorraine. It was SO fucking delicious and pretty I can't even explain. It came with a huge salad and the quiche was perfection. The interior is so pretty and the workers here are so kind and helpful! They constantly smile at you which is such a good vibe. 

Good food, beverages, people, atmosphere, and vibes!

I'll be spending all my money here :)"}
{"text":"First off, I would like to commend you for your \"La Cave.\" Also the Madelines were to die for sorta.  We ordered the bottomless mimosas for $16 a person. It isn't displayed anywhere and nobody knows about it. Not even half the staff. I would definitely come back again to sample more pastries but I'm on a diet and I'm cutting weight. Until next time.

Au revoir"}
{"text":"Delicious food and coffee I love it, good atmosphere for breakfast with your friends. The only detail I do not like is a girl who prepares the food her clothing is inadequate and it makes me dirty to be preparing food."}
{"text":"What's not to love? Beautiful pastries, flaky buttery croissants and delightful lattes. This place has it all and more. It's a cute little café but the food definitely is their biggest charm. Everything I've tried, from their Almond, Chocolate and butter Croissants to their Madeleine's and Canele's have been outstanding but I'd have to say my favorite here is the Nord Sandwich. Smoked Salmon, red onions, cucumber and capers with homemade spread on a pretzel roll made in house. Oh myyyy! My head is spinning just thinking about all the deliciousness in one bite, perfectly pairs with the side salad it comes with.

Also note worthy are their latte's and specialty drinks. There are a lot of varieties they offer and seems like the list gets longer every time I come in. Drinks that will surely appease the coffee fanatics and comes with fancy latte art to boot! C'mon, tell me a Nutella S'mores latte does not stop you in your tracks?!?! You had me at Nutella! The last sip? WOW.

4 stars because there are more goodies I need to get my paws on like the Quiche Lorraine, macarons and various French pastries because where else would you try it but a legit French owned bakery right? Now if only I can find balance and exercise more lol! There's a lot to be said about this place but you just have to try it for yourselves, what are you waiting for?!?! GO!"}
{"text":"In a town where people are always in a rush, it's refreshing to discover a cafe that's designed to make you relax and savior your food!

According to Jonathan who is the owner he told me his dishes are inspired from his childhood home in France dishes like Chevre Salad, Quiche, Croquettes and sandwiches made on freshly baked French bread. 

I've been here quite a few times and these are the things I've tried:
The Nord sandwich is popular which consists of smoked salmon, capers, sweet onion and cucumber it was simply fabulous and healthy.  
The Quiches are light, fluffy and delicious. 
The Gazpacho soup is awesome, i can eat this everyday! 
(Soup Verte) avocado, cucumber, zucchini, onion bell pepper and basil). 

The staff was friendly and provided great customer service.
Jonathan is a terrific host, very nice person, we got along pretty fast.    
I told him I read his story in the paper and it's what made me drive to his cafe. 
He was so pleased, he explained to me in detail how the name Rosallie came about, it was the name of the landowner who sold the farm house from his homeland Southern France.
The name brought luck to his parents, so that's why he named the cafe Rosallie.  
Conversations like that is why I comeback to his cafe, I just like meeting great people!

Rosallie is an wonderful cafe and I recommend this place to anybody!"}
{"text":"The best French bakery in town. The \"pains aux raisin\"(raisin croissants) are the closest pastries to those baked in France. The coffee is also very good. This is a great place to do homework or any type of work away from work. The owner, Jonathan, is a very nice guy and is more than willing to accommodate to any needs.

I recommend this coffee shop without reservations."}
{"text":"I'm actually sitting in the cozy & quaint corner at Rosallie as I'm writing this review. This is my 2nd time here, the 1st time was a short visit & I had ordered the famous Almond Croissant which was TO DIE FOR! Literally, the best sweet croissant I have ever had. Today, I ordered the (also) famous, Ham & Cheese Croissant which came with a side salad and oranges. To pair, I ordered a Cappuccino. So fulfilled, the way to my heart is definitely through my tummy and Rosallie does that for me! Food, 5 stars!

And as others have mentioned already, the environment and atmosphere of this cafe is perfect for getting work done, studying solo or getting together with friends for lunch. It's not too loud as I have my headphones on with music playing, I highly recommend this spot to come by yourself or with others."}
{"text":"Such a cute and authentic French café. I came here with my one of my friends and we each ordered a quiche. The quiche melts in your mouth and is so savory that I find myself drooling as I type this. The servers were all so friendly and were happy to explain what each of the items were on their menu. 

The café's atmosphere is quiet and is a great place to catch up with friends or even bring your laptop and get some work done. I would highly recommend coming here!"}
{"text":"I'm in love with how simple and cute this place is. 

Stopped in during late lunch and got the almond croissant. It must've been freshly baked or something. Cause holy moly that thing was so soft on the inside. 5/5

The interior is a wide open space with tables near each corner. Each table is decorated with some cute flowers. Very simple but it gets the cute job done. 

The only problem I had here was they forgot to put an almond croissant in my friends order. But that was easily remedied. Really it's just super solid place to get with friends."}
{"text":"My new favorite cafe!  reminds me of my mornings in Europe! Lovely little French cafe with great coffee, flavorful sandwiches, and fresh pastries! Definitely going to be a regular stop for me"}
{"text":"Perfect little spot to start our Sunday morning! The staff was welcoming and patient, as it was our first time, and the food was delicious!! We will definitely be back and recommend this place to everyone we know!"}
{"text":"It's a great place to have coffee ( or tea) with friends or anyone. A variety of pastries to along with your bev. The place is beautifully decorated and the music that went along with it is nice. But. I wasn't very happy with service  at the front today. She was alone and of course since the place is busy she got a little overwhelmed and when I ask her if she had a chance to heat up the pastry I ordered she replied and said \" I am all by myself you know \" I wasn't in a hurry I was just checking if she got to it already. But a simple \" I apologize for the wait it'll be just a few min\" would have been a good response. But oh well. The food is good and coffee is great that's all it matters. :)"}
{"text":"Rosalie is a hidden gem...the best pastry in town!!  All of the other french classics are wonderful too. Grab a cappuccino to go with a dish....you won't be disappointed!!!  Tre Bella!!!"}
{"text":"We visited here a few time. Not a lot of option. But what we got was delicious!  A little pricey. Service was A plus ! The worker there always so happy and nice."}
{"text":"My favorite place for authentic French croissants used to be Bonjour Bakery. Then they changed ownership and the croissant recipe. Since then, I've been on the hunt for a new spot and have been dissatisfied with many off-Strip French bakeries. Until now. This place is truly delicious!!! The croissants are flaky, buttery, and AH-mazing. I eagerly look forward to going back to try other menu items"}
{"text":"Love this cute little French cafe, it's been my 3rd time going there. It's a cute quaint place that has a pretty cute rustic French country decor.They also  have a really cool see thru glass wine cellar! Super cool! There is also small area with a sofa and chairs with a bookcase that makes it look and feel cozy comfortable to sit and drink with ur besties,  which I did even as we ordered some snacks with our lattes! 
The Girls  really liked their lattes , I think that day I had a red velvet or hazelnut? It was delicious. I also ordered the salmon sandwich which came with a salad, that was yummy too! I also had their quiche which I shared with a friend, it had 2 pieces, good quantity and quality  for the price here! 
We also had some of their desserts,it tasted fresh and oh so decadently rich and delicious! We cudnt finish the 2 desserts between my 2 besties and I so we had that to go, for my kids to finish, and they commented it was one of the best deserts they've had! Lol  
Overall, I've alway had a great time when I go there with my girlfriends , so whenever my other set of besties from out of town or out of of the neighborhood want to go to a place that has good eats and cute atmosphere, this has been my Togo place, for my girlfriends and I!"}
{"text":"With Jonathan Pluvinet still occupied expanding his brand in Winter Garden it is under the direction of former Aria and Jean-Philippe Baker Christophe that Rosallie has continued to improve in 2018, several additions to the décor and a whole bunch of new Pastries showing that the man responsible for Jean Georges Steakhouse's outstanding Brioche shares both the skills and sensibilities of his fellow countryman.

Quickly approaching anniversary number three and still doing good business despite finally-resolved construction and a location almost entirely devoid of foot traffic, the former 7-Eleven even more attractive than ever with hand-painted signage plus natural elements atop dividers, it was just moments before the Café's 7am opening that Christophe and staff were found putting the finishing touches on Tuesday's lineup, two pre-ordered boxes already packed and ready to go with a Sandwich quickly assembled and the whole interaction completed in less than five minutes en route to work.

A heavier load than one might expect, the amount of Butter folded into Rosallie's Viennoiseries and Tart Shells never in question but magnified by several items made of Chocolate, it was immediately upon arrival to an office only eight minutes away that the degustation began with an upgraded Est tucked into a Whole Wheat Roll; the Brie, Vegetables and housemade Pesto only improved by good quality Prosciutto given a minute in the oven to both toast the bread and melt the creamy Cheese.

Not a job for late-risers, the baking beginning several hours before sunrise and yielding some three-dozen items daily, it was seeking out those still-warm that quickly identified both an Almond and Nutella Croissant, the former still a personal pick for the best found stateside thanks to its hand-ground filling, flaky exterior and overall structure while the later would probably make a Parisian cringe, though after a bite it is likely they too would deem it delicious.  

Enjoying the goods over nearly eight hours, fresh Raspberries and housemade Jam highlighting  several, it was also prior to fully cooling that Christophe's new Raspberry Almond Croissant added a whole new dimension to Jonathan's base without compromising the texture one bit, the sweetness remaining natural while a follow-up $3.90 Cinnamon Roll immediately created mental conflict as to whether this or CRAFTkitchen was better thanks both its wispy interior and largely-unsweetened Cream Cheese Frosting that allowed tanginess a welcome opportunity to shine. 

Bringing back half-dipped Madelines and adding a Macaroon, the Dark Chocolate's quality immediately evident and personally felt to be better around densely packed Coconut, it seems as though Rosallie's Choux has received an upgrade recently as an Éclair marrying Nutella's ingredients broke cleanly despite being entirely covered in Chocolate, the dish best suited for a fork and knife as too is the triple- Chocolate Brownie thanks to mirrored Ganache and a dense, fudgy base. 

Finding good use for leftover Egg Whites in soft-centered Meringue, a perfume of Almonds released by each bite as crumbles fall to the floor, those seeking additional 'lighter' options would do well to order one of Rosallie's Lemon Raspberry Tarts or a slice of Apple Pie, though if actual 'weight' is more a concern one would be hard pressed to find Cake with less heft than the layers Jon and Christophe have stacked below and above airy Chocolate Mousse.

Nearly as fond of the Walnut Pie as Le French Café's Almond Croissant for similar reasons of authenticity, the Nutella Almond Pie likewise mirroring thoughts regarding their Croissant layered in America's favorite Italian Spread, it was saving the three heaviest items for last that the tasting came to a conclusion, both the thick Chocolate Mousse Cake and buttery Tart filled with Ganache seeing their richness mellowed by Fruit while the layered Opera tasted a lot like Tiramisu, but with a lot more variance in texture.

***** In many ways the unlikely inspiration for at least three additional French Bakeries sprouted since, the irony of Jean-Philippe's closure not wasted on those paying attention as only Thomas Keller's Bouchon remains as any sort of competition on-Strip, Rosallie continues to shine even as Jonathan looks towards further expansion and with Christophe's passion and pedigree it seems like even more great things are likely soon to come."}
{"text":"The Quiche Lorraine was stunning...and I mean a show stopper...It was better than anything I had on my last visit to Paris...just wish this place was closer to my house..."}
{"text":"was not very happy with the prices. the pastries were good but not  worth 3.95. well you live and learn."}
{"text":"Really loved this place after visiting with my young daughter for a post-church breakfast. We shared a petit déjeuner, which was anything but \"petit\" if you ask me. There were eggs, salade, and croissant, and bread. It was more than enough for two. The French Press coffee was well prepared, and flavorful, and my daughter adored the hot chocolate, though I would say it was probably too much chocolate (if that can even be a thing). 

I have been anxious to go back for an evening course, and some wine, as their selection was interesting, and their savory foods look equally delicious."}
{"text":"I've been here about two times now and I've had enjoyable experiences on both visits. 

For our first trip, we tried their almond croissant, crème brulee latte, and an éclair that strangely reminds me of the Chinese pineapple bun pastry. The almond croissant was beautifully made -- buttery, flakey, and sweet. However, it is a little too sweet for my taste buds so I would probably recommend getting some coffee or tea with it. The crème brulee latte was pretty average for me. Perhaps it's because everything is sweet so the coffee just blended in with everything else. The éclair was fantastic. They had three different type of fillings: vanilla, caramel, or chocolate. We got the vanilla filled and it was really yummy. It was definitely on the sweeter side as well.

On our second visit, we got the same vanilla filled éclair. Instead of an almond croissant, we opted in for a regular croissant -- I do believe that it is better than the almond version just because it is not sweet at all. We also grabbed an Ouest (West) sandwich, which consisted of duck confit, sweet onion jam, and tomato. I have to be honest -- the sandwich didn't blow me away. It was just another sandwich to me .. and it was flooded with greens -- not that it's a bad thing. Or maybe I just can't appreciate a French sandwich!?!

Rosallie is a very cute place. It's very cozy and carries a warm atmosphere. If you want a place to just have some snacks, coffee, tea, etc with some friends, definitely consider Rosallie. The location is very convenient as it is off the 215 Rainbow exit. 

I would definitely be back for their croissants! And I do hope to see more bakery/pastry items on the menu in the future."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time with a couple of friends. I would have to say it was very impressive. 

I order a croissant sandwich that had an eggs in it and it was amazing!!!!! Every single bite was delicious. 

This is a great place to come here for brunch and just hangout. Enjoy a coffee or one of their yummy pasties. 

I recommend this place."}
{"text":"I've been here about 3 times now. the first time was okay seemed like crossiant was doughey. the 2nd time the crossiant seemed doughey. today was my 3rd time,and I ordered a ham and cheese crossiant, this crossiant wasn't doughey just very small in size and flat!!!!. there seemed to be only 2 slices of ham ,and 2 slices of cheese on it toasted. it was warm and good.but  it was advertised for 6.50, they charged 6.90, I asked for a cup of coffee to go wich was 2.50. the also charged me .50 cents for the cup. I was charged .90 cent over than what I expected to pay!!! The workers have NO personality, but the owner or cook. he is very nice and friendly. its a clean place good hours, and they take cash or credit. Since my 3 experiences though I personally will NOT be back. over priced for the quality and quantity you get!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a low-key gem...and it would be hard to tell by looking at the location of where it's at because of how bland the shopping center looks (similar to how Baguette Cafe is in a corporate park....)

We ordered the (fuck!) I forgot the name of the thing but it was basically like a pizza pastry with an egg on top. Whatever it was it looked like it wouldn't fill you up however it was so rich and full in flavor that it was enough for even me....

The Chipotle Chicken Sandwich was the other one and it was a bigger looking portion and was just as good.

As far as drinks we ordered the Creme Brulee Latte and the Green Passion Fruit Tea. Both were as expected so it was excellent.

All in all if more people knew about this place it would be packed for sure..."}
{"text":"9/23/2016 (Drama) Another private message from the owner, Jon: 

\"Thank you for your update and showing your unprofessionalism to the other yelpers. Like you said, yelp is to review businesses and not use it for personal vengeance which you just did. I wasn't insulting you by saying Mc Donald would be a better place for you to go, and looking at your past preview I was absolutely right about that.\"

I am posting this here because I believe in transparency and I believe Yelpers should understand who the owner is. My comments are here for all to see, while the owner privately messages me and insults me (I am blocking him after I post this). I am surprised at the owner's reaction considering his \"professional\" background. I don't think he handles criticism well, or maybe the stress from running his own business has made him too quick to react rather than to hear what is said. Regardless, I am done posting about this matter and I will not be sending any of my friends to Rosallie. I wish his business well and hope future Yelpers see him for who he really is. ( Maybe he is peeling too many onions ) 

c'est la vie"}
{"text":"Recommended! We tried this place as its new to our area. Nice environment with friendly staff. The food was delicious and the Cappuccino has the taste of Europe. They have a nice variety of pastries and croissants. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So I decided not to be selfish by keeping this place a \"secret\". I'm sure plenty of folks know about this wonderful café anyhow.

For those of you that haven't been here - I suggest going when you have a little time to spare. Crème brulé coffee is a must!! A little sweet but if you like coffee
.... and crème brulé.... you ought to love yourself and drink one. 

The croque Rosalie was great as well! But I'll definitely be coming back just for that coffee, some macaroons/pastries, and some pleasant reflection time without my cell phone. The atmosphere is busy without feeling like you are lost in the crowd. Friendly and very helpful staff - you can tell they work hard back there! 


I also love the cleanliness, simple yet interesting decor, and nostalgic French music - aahhhhh c'est la vie!!"}
{"text":"Yay! I love this place. 

Prior to stopping in I would only recommend Bouchon for French pastries. The country plate is generous. Ask for mustard. 

Almond croissant. Chocolate croissant. Almond chocolate croissant. Nutella croissant. All fantastic. 

I appreciate a smooth Americano. They do it well. Sad I only discovered it this year."}
{"text":"A girlfriend brought me to Rosallie for my Birthday...Wow, what a hidden gem! As I walked into the restaurant, the aroma of freshly baked desserts and bread was delightful!  The restaurant is sectioned off into 2 sections, one section with tables and another section with comfortable couches with a bookshelf stacked with books.  They also have free Wi-Fi & a free charging station for your electronic devices.  The staff was very friendly and helpful.

I had their Centre, which is their oven roasted sandwich, which was plated beautifully. I also had their pomegranate mijito iced tea... Perfect on a hot summer day of 108 degrees in Vegas. 

I will definitely go back to Rosallie!"}
{"text":"Cute little neighborhood treasure. Great coffee, teas, & food. Friendly staff & cheaper than sambalatte. We will be back! A bientôt!"}
{"text":"So happy we decided to go here for breakfast today, everything was delicious! The cafe is cute and they had pleasant french music playing in the back ground. We ordered 2 lattes with almond milk, the almond croissant, the breakfast pizza (i can't remember the name, la americana or something) and eggs au gratin. Plenty of food! Loved it and definitely coming back to try other things"}
{"text":"I was up the road at the Chevy dealership waiting on my car and decided to Yelp a place for lunch. It was early afternoon so nothing heavy or breakfast. I saw this Cafe and decided to give it try. The food was on point! The inside has a nice rustic front and displays the breads and croissants. We got and Almond croissant, the Nord sandwich, and lemon cookie that was more like a little cake. All was extremely fresh and tasty, coffee was fresh ground and brewed. I wish this place was on my side of Las Vegas. But whenever I'm in the area I will def make a return stop! Well done!"}
{"text":"First time in review. It's a cute place. It is. Annnnd the pastries are all so beautiful and appealing. So if you ask me will I ever return? YES! I would love to give their pastries my attention, and perhaps try something else...BUT never again their sandwich. Why? 
The buns they use is way too thick. 

The hubs and I met up with a group of other foodies for brunch. I've had this place bookmarked forever, but coming from the north we've never been able to make it just because of time constraints and opportunity. Opportunity and time wasn't a problem this day...and so we arrived. 

Back to food. You stand in line, order, get a number, and have a seat at whatever table suits your interest given its availability. I felt like I was standing in line forever with 3 people ahead, but then again...hunger was real so idk which part of me was doing the thinking. We finally order and I tell the cashier what I wanted, and she then asks me to show her which one off the menu. ::crickets::. So I opened the menu and pointed it off to her. A Nord, an Est, and may you throw in a jam danish. Off to our seats we went.

Then we waited. And waited. Those that were there sooner than us got their meals, finished it, and even had to go. Kinda awkwardly waiting. But I was patiently okay! I was out sans the kids, socializing...im good! But we waited. It got to the point where one person in the group walked up to check on our dishes to find they were just sitting waiting to get picked up and served. 

The sandwiches proved to have been waiting because the buns used were fricking hard. People, I couldn't even slice through it with my butter knife without my bun shifting and cracking. So I knew cutting through it wasn't going to work. Not only was it hard, I couldn't even get my mouth to grip on that thing. Quite frankly, there seemed to have been more bun than \"nord\".  Refer to pictures to get a better understanding of what we were served. 

On top of that, I feel like I got served a plate full of spring mix. I ate my sandwich open faced, but didn't eat the bottom half. Someone joked about my food being rabbit food because it was just a plate of greens. My husband's sandwich looked almost worst than mine. His looked overly toasted, burnt...whichever. Again, refer to pictures. 

But I made it through whatever I could and my husband out of upbringing...finished his despite the woes. The jam danish was the best part of our meal, it was beautiful to look at...but it ended up tasting basic. It was flaky in a stale way. Sigh, if that makes sense. I just felt like everyone I know who has been here ten million times has such a great rave for it...but first impression--disappointing.

I certainly wouldn't mind trying other things on their menu. What i do know for sure is I'll never order a sandwich from there again...id rather opt for something else. I won't count them out...just not a place I'd drive across the city for. Gatherings and what not...sure why not. 

Definitely kid and stroller friendly if bringing the kids. I'd say leave the kids though. Might catch a better vibe over a pastry and latte without 'em.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I usually come here for weekend brunch. It's a great place for a quiet morning meal in a very simple and clean space, with plenty of natural lighting and a variety of areas for seating. I like to get the ham and cheese croissant with a french press. Honestly I think the food is okay, and also a bit pricy for the portion. But if you're looking for a healthier alternative this place is a good option. I like coming here more so for the atmosphere than their menu."}
{"text":"I truly admire the people that can abstain from carbs for an extended period of time.  Personally, I get pretty depressed without a quality daily dose.  Dimmed lights, blinds turned up, and the sweet, sad notes of \"Careless Whisper\" blaring from my speakers on repeat start sounding like \"Carbless Whisper\" around the 25th time as I attempt to kill myself with a plastic knife.

Fortunately, Rosallie offers the carbs worthy of getting me out of any kind of funk.  The plain croissant is so simple, yet so awesome.  I cherish the slightly crispy and crunchy ends while the middle of it is borderline pornobutterography in my mouth.

In fact, I've created a special two course tasting menu only known to me.  I call it  \"Les Deux\":

1. Butter Croissant
2. Almond Croissant

With baked goods like these, who needs Le Prozac?"}
{"text":"Great quiet spot for breakfast! Pastries are delicious and coffee is awesome! Location is excellent as well."}
{"text":"Super disappointed with my first experience here, but let me mention the positives first:

- Great atmosphere
- The food was really good

My disappointment stems from ordering a decaf iced americano. I asked the person if they could make their drinks decaf and she said that they could so I ordered it. I have a sensitivity to caffeine that is heart related - especially to the caffeine content of coffee - so I always order my drinks decaffeinated. Anyway, I got my drink first so I started drinking it and noticed after about 5 minutes that my heart rate had increased dramatically. I wear a heart monitor and it jumped over 30 beats. I knew that the drink had caffeine in it. 
By that time, I had gotten my food so I decided to eat and not drink any more of the coffee. The food was great, by the way. When I was on my way out, I went to the person who had taken my order and made my drink and told her about my sensitivity and that I didn't think the drink was decaf. She was adamant that she used decaf to make it, but the reaction I had to it makes me question that. I have never had the same type of reaction to decaf - I only get this reaction if I accidentally ingest caffeine. There were other customers around so I didn't want to argue or cause a scene. I just wanted it to be remade as decaf, but that wasn't offered. She did offer herbal tea or a refund, but I wasn't looking for either of those so I left. 

Unfortunately, I won't be back."}
{"text":"This is the real deal.  Beyond amazing.  Went the the almond croissants, but left with so much more.  A slice of heaven.  Authentic and very charming little spot.  I will continue to go back over and over.  Breakfast, lunch and dessert.  The chocolate almond croissants are the best I have ever had.  I have been to France 4x and eaten a lot of them but none compares.  Such a treasure."}
{"text":"Great small plates, but not too much like a Parisian cafe. It's almost as if whoever decorated this place tried a little too hard and may have never visited Paris, but I could be wrong. Regardless, the food was great and I didn't really care much about the decor and ambiance because I came hungry. 

What I ordered:
-Ham and cheese croissant: warm, light and fluffy with a small side salad with oil/balsamic vinegar dressing ($6.90). I would order this again. It's not greasy and heavy like most ham and cheese croissants, nothing like the ones at donut shops. 

-Country Plate: comes with a little bit of everything. Reminds me of a European breakfast and it looks exactly how it does in the menu photo. (12.90)

-black coffee: ok, a little on the bitter side

Service was decent, no complaints. You order and pay at the register and a gal brings you your order to the table. 

I'd come back, but not rushing to come back."}
{"text":"Quite simply the best cup of coffee I've had here in America...maybe anywhere actually. It was a fantastic cup of coffee! (And I'm not really into coffee)  If you like coffee this is your place. I didn't get to try the food but I will do that on my next visit which will be soon..."}
{"text":"I was looking for an afternoon tea and stumble across this place. When you walk into this place first thing you smell is coffee and pastries. Right away I new this was going to be good. We ordered lunch coffee and a few pastries. We were not disappointed with anything. Very cute decor which gives you a feeling of being on the French Countryside. Next time we're in town will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I have been here several times. I always like it more & more. Their coffee is good. Their pastries are the best. And, I really love how they serve their tea. Today, we went in for tea & pastries. Their Tea is special. They serve it in a special teapot for loose tea. Keeping the leaves away from your tea. And, it is the tea stayed hot for about an hour that we were there.

They have an outdoor patio with about three tables, each table has about three chairs. But, inside, the place itself is very cute & cozy. I usually stay inside. I like the part all the way in the back, or southside if you well. It has cozy lounge chairs. Today, I noticed they had a sofa. I believe that it's new. 

They also had a sign that they just started serving wine. Maybe, next time, we will try that. I have tried their food. I really love the quiche. I'm sure they that have many other dishes that are delicious. This is definitely a very special place that you should try... in case you haven't."}
{"text":"Place is so adorable! We ordered the almond croissant that was super delicious, it was flaky and really moist....to die for. The cheese croissant was also flaky and good, almond tart was delish. We will definitely, go back to try their sandwiches."}
{"text":"I teach yoga next door and have been eyeing this place for a while. Finally decided to give it a try. The atmosphere is bright and inviting, lots of seating. The staff was very pleasant and professional. The display case and all of the counter space was artfully done. My quiche looked exactly like the photos on the website- tasted super yummy. A patron sitting next to me said she has had quite a few items on the menu/ all delicious and she recommended getting a coffee (which I might do another time). Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"So happy when this cute french bakery cafe opened...always looking for high quality pastries, coffee, sandwiches.  It is so inviting inside with its french country design.  It has different seating areas. I've tried one pastry with raisins and also the croissant.  Delicious and flaky!!  You can tell they certainly know the details of making good pastries.  The coffee was just perfect.  I haven't tried the sandwiches yet but a friend of mine said the one with the salmon was great.  Can't wait to try everything out."}
{"text":"What a wonderful place, the food was excellent and the coffee was excellent as well. Had a butter croissant that was flaky and delicious with real French butter and the Veggie Quiche. The quiche was almost like a soufflé, so light and creamy. This is a wonderful place to eat and more than reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Omg this place is legit. People speak French, and so do their pastries!!! 

The best and most moist phyllo dough croissants I have ever had! Their sandwiches are delicious and the coffee is spot on. Brings me back to France. 

The interior decor is so cute, classy, but also welcoming.

Love love love it!!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and staff... have been coming here since they opened! Favorites are their macaroons, Ouest sandwich, and almond croissants."}
{"text":"Good (not quite great) latte, great tiramisu. 4.5 stars, rounding up because the ambiance is terrific--some good seats, music that isn't too invasive (and is pleasant to listen to), nice but not overwhelming decor. The folks who work there are nice, too; I had to step out for some time and they assumed someone had just left my latte and dumped it, but made me a new one when I came back in. All of the desserts look amazing."}
{"text":"Sign outside is \" Le French Cafe\". Loved the ambience and the simplicity of their menu. Prices are great too. We loved the overall experience starting with the owner's warm welcome, the comfy chairs, the book corner and of course the food!. My 3 year old daughter and I had a wonderful breakfast and plan on returning over the weekend with hubby. They have only been opened for 2 months and I wish this family owned business many years of success. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"came here for brunch and got an egg croissant sandwich. I like to add tomatoes & sauces & they were very accommodating! Took about 10min to get the amazing food which was WELL worth it. 

But all of that aside; this food was amazing! Definitely 5 stars wow!"}
{"text":"I've been on a hunt for an amazing french bakery and sandwich place. I'm a sucker for croissants as this is by far one of my favorite breads alongside french baguettes. The sandwiches I tried were: 

Nord: Smoked Salmon- 5 stars  I'm usually not a fan of smoked salmon, but I absolutely loved it here, that I kept eating it off someone else's plate. 
Quest: Duck Confit- 2 stars   I thought this sandwich would be mind-blowing, but the duck was overcooked and tough, hence ruining my experience. 
Croissant- 2 stars  I have high expectations for croissants at a French bakery. It was alright. 

The salad that comes with the sandwiches are generous. The quiche was delicious, and apple tart was good. 

If I were to return, my vote would go for trying the smoked salmon again."}
{"text":"This cafe is really cute and the food tastes amazing! I come here once in a while and I love getting the nord sandwich. Today I went for a nord salad with an iced passion fruit green tea. The salad looked and tasted AMAZING. I only knocked off one star because the tea tasted a bit watered down. This place can get pretty busy and loud occasionally too. Otherwise, I really recommend this cafe!"}
{"text":"I love Rosallie. Simple as that.

I was brought here by a friend who I know has high standards. When she told me I would love this place, I knew she was right. I walked in and was immediately transported to the city of Nice. I've actually never been to Nice but I have been to Paris. Basically, I felt the power of France.

You're welcomed by fresh pastries billowing over themselves behind glass. At least that was the case when I was one of their first customers. I literally ordered twelve pastries to go. From cinnamon rolls to almond croissants. We sat and ordered quiche and the Egg Au Gratin. Everything tasted delicious although I was expecting potatoes in the au gratin but I didn't care because it was so good. 

They have teas, coffee, a selection of beer and wines. What's not to love. You order at the counter and then grab a table once you get a number from the cashier. You could grab your friends and make your way to this place or post up solo. 

Big fan. Huge!"}
{"text":"Simply the best french cafe in Las Vegas! Delicious recipes from Jonathan and Nicolas!! BTW, they are the nicest people. I looooove their apple pie with vanila whip cream, things like that keeping me coming back. Today I had the chevre chaud salad (warm goat cheese), deliciously healthy! I highly recommend Rosallie to all my friends and all who came are very satisfied. Prices are great also! Me and my husband had entree, coffee and desert for $25. Thank you Jonathan for your great food and ambience!"}

{"text":"While the place wont get any awards for plating, it's a great find with consistent french cafe food. Decided to take a look and see if John Curtas and Michael Uzmann, local reviewers  have any idea what they are talking about when they said they love this restaurant

Honestly, when I walked in, the décor is a little bland, a little boring, so assumed was going to be a disaster. 

However, I was pleasantly pleased by the Quiche Lorraine. Not going to do a full review, but while they wont win any awards for plating, it was very traditional, very French, and was happy to see the quiche made correctly, a little perfectly undercooked instead of the horrible fluffy egg crap americans make and call \"quiche\" or something.

I will going back for sure and trying some of the pastries to see if they are as good as everyone says."}
{"text":"I'm frenchy it's amazing good there croissant was just like back home host quiche fab def coming back asap"}
{"text":"For coffee this cafe is pretty good I would stick with their normal flavors (creme burlee/ caramel is good) opposed to the special. Which was a rose mocha- very potent like perfume. We tried a few pastries here which were tasty, like the chocolate croissant and cheese danish."}
{"text":"After my 3rd trip here, I've had delicious croissants, an excellent creme brûlée latte, a yummy hazelnut praline latte and an exquisite pomegranate flavored hot tea (not from a tea bag either!). I stopped in to get bakery treats as a Christmas gift on my first visit and am delighted by my find! The background music is tastefully chosen and the ambience certainly takes the stress out of a day. So mellow, cozy and relaxing, Mr. Pluvinet has done a fantastic job in the few months since opening. This is a treasure! I'm looking forward to sampling the brunch menu! Tres bon!"}
{"text":"You cant beat this place!! Always consistent. Amazing home made pastries and other great food and a killer cappuccino!"}
{"text":"I have been here on two separate occasions and I can't believe I almost forgot to review this place.

Rosallie is a fantastic cafe that recently opened in the area. The pastries are amazing and so is the cute little shop. The owner and his family are so sweet, it's definitely a welcoming spot to enjoy treats.

The lemon tart, almond cake and almond croissant are a revelation. The quiche and teas that I've tried are excellent as well.

Having this in the area is amazing and I can't wait to make it a regular on my rotation."}
{"text":"Will this business ever be open later? Most chances I have to go are after 6:30pm and it's closed!  I wish there was a light menu here for at night. I would definitely come here to study and grab a snack or sandwich with a late coffee!"}
{"text":"Heard great things so decided to drop by with the hubby for lunch. Cute atmosphere with yummy looking baked goods everywhere. I had the duck confit sandwich on croissant with onion jam. I'm a big duck fan sooooo good! Hubby had mozzarella and ham croissant which he said was \"ok\". For dessert I had  the Nutella cookies and he had a chocolate brownie which he said was \"damn good\". It's a bit pricey so I'd bring out of town guests here or a friend for a special occasion."}
{"text":"Came here today with my best friend to grab a coffee/ something to eat and to get some work done. It's a cute little French bakery with a fancy ambience setting. There are areas with couch like chairs to sit and get somr work done and there are tables to eat all around the place as well. 

The workers were very nice and even brought our food and coffee out to us. Since we've been here a few times we know that our favorite thing to get is the Nord. This time we decided we'd also try the sud since it has prosciutto and my friend really loves that stuff. We split both sandwiches so we could compare which was better. I also decided to get the americano coffee which was pretty tasty. The Nord was delicious as always and I love how they also provide a salad with the sandwich. The sud was too salty for me so I ended up leaving half of the half sandwich I was given by my friend. Later on we actually also tried the peach green tea and that was really good. 

Overall, we enjoy this place and the fact that we can go there to get some work done is great. They do provide free wifi like Starbucks which is great, but isn't so busy as a star bucks which is also a plus for us!"}
