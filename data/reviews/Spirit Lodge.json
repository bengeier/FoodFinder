{"text":"Went to see Rayland Baxter last night, being from Ohio and not familiar with Lawrenceville, wasn't sure what to expect. After walking in my initial reaction was that it was someone's uncle's rec-room from the 60's or 70's. Definitely had a trendy hipster vibe which is good or bad depending on your personal opinion. They had a good selection of draft beers and pretty unique cocktails. Prices were fine. The majority of the bar tenders were very nice and attentive. One seemed fine but never checked on me since I wasn't an attractive young woman....After the show got a pizza to go and it was phenomenal, they were more than happy to cook it well done as I requested. It wasn't crowded so lines and service were not an issue. A bonus, the men's room was surprisingly clean."}
{"text":"I recently moved in around the corner, and finding Spirit Lodge was the best thing that could have happened to me. The atmosphere is a little odd on first glance (it's apparently an old Moose lodge), but the drinks and pizza more than make up for it. The drinks are amazing - ridiculously cheap, fairly strong cocktails made with delicious fresh juice blends. They have a delicious kale margarita that makes you feel healthy while drinking a margarita, which is quite an accomplishment. The pizza, however, might be the best part. Moving here from NYC, I've really been missing good pizza, which I had not found at all until I stumbled upon this place. The crust is perfect, the sauce is perfect, the toppings are fresh and delicious. The guys making the pizza are apparently from Roberta's in Brooklyn, so it makes sense. I definitely plan on becoming a regular!"}
{"text":"This place is awful. If you go here on busy nights you can't leave the bar to go outside without having to wait in line again even though they give you wrist bands. They only let in a limited number of people at a time so if you have to leave for any reason you are looking at an hour wait to get back inside if not longer. I understand it's a fire code thing but you can't come up with a better solution to manage this? It's funny to me that this place used to be the Lawrenceville Moose Lodge and now we're supposed to treat it like it's some posh exclusive trendy bar on the Sunset Strip. I would recommend drinking literally anywhere else in Lawrenceville."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from friends in the area, so I went to check it out. It did not disappoint. Cool atmosphere. Great pizza too"}
{"text":"LOVE JEALOUSY AND KENDALL = SPIRIT IS THE NEW HIPSTERS SOCIAL CLUB!  Hi My Loves!  I saw Spirit come up on my \"Cool People Feed\" and put it on the list to try STAT! I went out with \"Trouble\" intending to have a fun night, got a bit of bad news and then drank my cares away at Spirit!  LOVE/JEALOUSY: I love they reused an old Moose Lodge, which is a ready made social hall and bar! WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT! That's why I'm jealous! Really all this place needed was a good cleaning and a little d√©cor - which was done nicely and BOOM it's this awesome ready made hang out! I could kick myself for not thinking up this place!!!!  I wore my hippest hipster get up...my sports car betrayed me deep attempts at being a hipster that night...BUT ANYWAY...When you first walk in it's easy to miss the steps down to the huge bar and dance floor but your nose helps you to sniff out the tasty pizza and garlic knots cooking down there. When you realize how huge the place is it's kind of incredible the space they have in the ever growing property values of Larryville. There is a genius running this business cause the walls are covered in local art that is for sale, smart and free...How I love America!  That's when we met KENDALL and her kickass bartending skills and her awesome playlist playing in the background. We tried a couple mixed drinks and the beer selections, she was great and helpful! GIRL NOTE: Bathrooms were clean!   If you wander upstairs there is a bingo hall/music venue/party space = genius money making concert venue!  I could spend every night here hanging out. It's a great place to hang. Too bad I don't have enough hipster outfits and I drive a Benz or I'd fit right in! It's such a genius business concept it makes me cry!  Totally coming back!   Love you! Muah"}
{"text":"This place is so Lawrenceville. Filled with hipsters/lost yuppies/amusing locals - the friendliest of sorts. The staff is amazing, so funny/charming/helpful. They're cash only - which is annoying, but aside from that, I love this place. I haven't tried the pizza, but evidently it's incredible - so get on that. There's massive amounts of space, I've always thrived most in the downstairs. Occasionally, there will be a professional videographer just capturing your life. PBRs for days (and Ipas/mixed bevs, too). There's a party school bus in the back yard, so beep beep. Ummm, what else - last weekend there was a jellyfish party and it was insanely fun. And next week there's a puppies and pounders party (aka bring your dog). And decor is always themed on point. Ah, perfect!"}
{"text":"As something of a Pittsburgh relative of Roberta's in Bushwick, Brooklyn, Spirit is one of my new favorite bars. It's pretty cheap (albeit cash-only), they have stellar pizza with uniquely textured crust and fresh parmesan, and somehow a very cool aesthetic despite being a re-vamped Moose lodge, wood panelling abound. Somebody sure had a vision for this space and executed it quite well.   They have outdoor seating, DJs with taste, and lots of dance floor space. Also, divey vibe without clouds of cigarette smoke! Win!  My only real complaint is they frequently charge a cover even to just grab a drink at the bar and get pizza, which is ridiculous when you're just trying to get out and take advantage of a good neighborhood spot. (When this happens, there's always Gus's or Remedy to take your business)  ...And if only they served pizza for lunch on weekends!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I came here for a Steve Gunn concert, I believe it was one of the first events they put on period, in late March/ early April.  I did not get a chance to try the pizza here which I hear is great, but the atmosphere, crowd, and draft prices were all great! Would love to see more shows here in the future."}
{"text":"I love this place. It's like stepping into a hipster/beatnik movie set everytime I go. Some of the best pizza in the city (in my opinion), great dance nights and a friendly, knowledgable bar staff.  The monthly art installations are always interesting, and the events they have upstairs are great. Not many bars are able to pull off the style they have without being over priced and a bit cliche. Spirit is neither. I always run into a friendly face and have a great time when I'm there.  Recently started going to their brunch buffet, and that too is wonderful. Lots of vegetarian options, great price ($11), and there's always been a dj as well which I think is fairly novel for brunch.  Highly recommended- definitely worth following on Facebook for the event updates. Can't wait to make it to $10 lasagna night! (Which apparently includes a salad and a glass of wine )"}
{"text":"A pretty solid space for local shows. I've only ever been here for shows, but having a separate bar area under the performance space is a pretty good deal. It's nice to be able to get away from all the people for a few minutes in between sets. It looks like a junk place from the outside, but it's a nice low key spot inside. The line can get pretty long outside depending on when youre trying to enter. It can also get pretty sweaty in the summer time. Other than that, a decent place for a local show."}
{"text":"It's worth the trip to the Sprit Lodge (old Moose Lodge) for the pizza.   The pizza is huge, greasy and unbelievably delicious!  We have been heading to Spirit Lodge for a local PA wrestling event that they hold in their upstairs venue space about once a month.  There is typically a cover charge for the events but you can visit the downstairs bar and order food for no cover.  The upstairs venue space is huge and also has a small bar. The drinks are cheap ($3 PBR pounders and $4 Jack Cider cans), the staff is nice and it is cleaner than most dive bars in Lawrenceville.  For events they will serve pizza by the slice for $3 for plain and $4 for pepperoni-I totally dig square pizza. Downstairs you can order entire pies that are reasonably priced. The pies do take a while to bake as they make their own dough but worth the wait."}
{"text":"I attended the Record Fest here with some friends and had a grand time. Before the event officially opened, we went downstairs for some food and drinks. Downstairs has a nice little staging area in the corner with tables distributed throughout the center and a bar along the longest wall. If you walk through the kitchen, there is additional seating outside that also leads to a really cool decorative school bus! I got a slice of pepperoni slice which is really two rectangular pieces of pizza (rather filling). Beware that the pizza sauce has a kick to it! As a person that likes things spicy, I enjoyed the pizza very much. However, my friend who doesn't like spicy food was coughing after the first bite (lol). Hopefully, this is helpful as to whether you should try the pizza based on the spice factor. Upstairs there was much more room than imagined. Lots of record vendors spread amongst the area with a larger stage (the DJ was here) and another bar in the back. I paid $7 for a plastic cup of Pinot Noir which was room temperature; it would've been nice if it was slightly chilled. I'm excited to attend another event here whether it be the Record Fest or something else creative."}
{"text":"The restaurant/bar is in the basement. When no one greeted us, we sat ourselves at a table and they weren't happy about it.   The Bloody Mary that my friend ordered was disgusting. It tasted like pure horseradish. The brunch was just okay, but too pricey for the quality. I enjoyed the white pizza but that's about it. Also, you eat on weird elementary school lunch trays.  No one even offered to refill our drinks until we were leaving. It's definitely a hipster crowd with a weird vibe and terrible service. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I'm reviewing this as an evening or late night music venue. I did not try the pizza or other food.  Spirit is a chill, comfortable, spacious music venue. There's plenty of seating. Good sized stage and excellent sound. Audio engineering (AKA \"sound guy\") knew what he was doing and had the right equipment. Diverse drink menu with good bottles (such as Hendricks Gin) and a menu of specials. Creative and fun patio and smoking area with that iconic bus with free jukebox. Staff was courteous and helpful. I didn't get to try it, but having a pizza place in the basement is a nice bonus.  Really just a well thought out and comfortable space for concerts and events. Lots of places to get away from the music and chat if you like. Restrooms were easy to locate, and, eh, clean enough.  Recommended if you want to put on or see a show."}
{"text":"We used the 2nd floor Hall at Spirit for our wedding brunch, and it was fantastic! Making the reservation and payments were easy. The rates are extremely reasonable, especially for what you get. On our brunch day, the staff was friendly and swift. The buffet menu was delicious, and the buffet table stayed well-stocked for the entire length of our party. Our family and friends enjoyed having the upstairs as a private space, and not having to wait in long lines, since we had our own bartenders. I would highly recommend anyone who needs an event space to consider Spirit!"}
{"text":"This is a great place to go for a show or drinks.  However, the brunch is not good. Do not believe it when people tell you the brunch is good."}
{"text":"Tried their Pizza, fell in love, never looking back.  They change out their pizza options weekly, but if you are in the neighborhood, check out Slice Island.  Seriously, that cheese pizza is what dreams are made of. I've had the veggie one, the meat one, and the cheese. All are delectable, but that cheese pizza I have cravings for.   Did I mention Kendal works there? Kendal!  Of Remedy, Round Corner Cantina, Gooskis, etc. fame. She's a sweetie, a great bartender, and will rock your socks off with her awesome playlist.    This place is where it's at on a friday and saturday.   Oh, and 80's night thursday... 80's night thursday.  Do it."}
{"text":"So fucking dope. Some nights are extra fucking chill. Depends on the vibe, but overall, super fucking dope. Music is good. Pizza is square but good. Drinks are cheap and super dope."}
{"text":"I kind of want to like Spirit, but when I think about going to events there, I just think about long lines and standing outside waiting. I guess it's pretty hipster to not really put effort into the venue.  I've only been to a couple events upstairs so I have no idea what the downstairs is like, but they typically only have one person doing tickets and checking IDs, and then had someone just doing wristbands. It would be better to split things up some so that the line can move faster. The bar upstairs was decently fast and they do take cash and cards up there.  I wouldn't go specifically to Spirit unless there was something I wanted to see that happened to choose Spirit as a venue. It's not terrible, but it's just not great either."}
{"text":"Had to pay a cover just to eat pizza in there which was just spending more money while some super shitty band was playing. Also wasn't allowed to take a non alcoholic drink outside while we were leaving. Stay away at all costs"}
{"text":"I saw the HUMP! Film Festival here and also consistently come to this place for their awesome DANCE party, IN BED BY TEN.  Check it out, it has okay music, but an awesome, diverse crowd where people genuinely are having fun.  The funk night is also pretty good, but if you're downstairs, it's gonna get really, really hot.   Street parking is free but can get crowded depending on the night.  After the businesses across the street close, their parking lot is usable.  I haven't heard of anyone being towed from there.  I've stolen bites off of people's pizza, and the white pizza is really good.  Drink / Bar wise, they have decent prices and efficient bartenders.  Their selection isn't always super diverse though, so try to be patient!  :)"}
{"text":"Was cool but kinda sold out and let drusky book shows here and around same time drink pices went up like 30% but still worth checking out and four stars is mainly because my wife LOVES there pizza !"}
{"text":"Funnest Place in Pittsburgh, with good brews, live music, gormet pizza, bingo with a twist, DJ, and Many FUN Games for adults to play to keep us young at heart and energetic!  I had the Best Night EVER there!!!!"}
{"text":"I refuse to support Spirit. This is a discriminatory venue that refuses to hold themselves accountable for several issues that have taken place here. They have their reviews hidden on Facebook because they already know what will be said about them."}
{"text":"Favorite bar in the city (and not just because it is a few blocks from my house). Completely unpretentious. Good mix of people. Delicious and interesting drinks. Friendly bartenders. Good dance parties. Is there anything else you could want? Oh yeah, pizza. Well, they have that too!"}
{"text":"heard much hype bout this place via twitter and facebook but couldn't find time to make it over there until recently, when I went for the Sunday brunch buffet . it's in the basement of this former Moose Lodge at the eastern end of Lawrenceville on 51st St aka Stanton Avenue ,around the corner from the Sunoco gas station . there was a hipster-aged guy d.j.-ing old motown & r&b music(might i suggest to him - dude, spin some old bebop-style jazz or boogie woogie piano-style jazz like Errol Garner or even, Louis Jordan?...) on the stage (with blue & purple stage lighting beamed on himself...)  there were flashy \"look how hipster I am\" 20-somethings, suburban? but hipster-aware families and a few old-school o.g. Lawrenceville yinzer types, munching away .       Along the side wall there were a few hot table/steam buffet tables with some vegetarian food(veg food bores me but it did look interesting) followed by some sausages(seemed to be more home made than not) as well as a nice cheddar cheese quiche, salted home fries, home made hummus and at the end, a selection of their pizzas which were in the rectangular sicilian configuration with sausage and various other toppings including hot banana peppers and roasted red peppers... all were good/decent .   there was a \"bottom-less cup of coffee\" for an additional $2 and a bar menu of 3 variations on bloody marys and the usual beer list ... i personally don't like to drink alcohol until much later in the evening so, I opted for the coffee which was brewed well, a tanzanian peaberry, I think it was .   the buffet itself was $13 and I would say, a good deal, given the variety of food to choose from .        The only negatives -  #1 \"cash only\" policy - they direct you to the atm machines at the entrance or back entrance that hit you with a $2.50 service fee that I believe they get a portion of... so, why not just get set up for 'square' or other point-of-sale card machines ?  this would be MUCH more convenient and easy and people are shown to spend MORE when they can throw plastic down...  #2  the d.j. music was WAY too loud for so early in the day as far as i'm concerned, anyway  and the tables were just re-purposed old wooden industrial cable spools... the one I was assigned to was tiny ... like a child's table so I was eating at a very uncomfortable angle/position .. i will have to make a point to get a bigger table OR eat outside on the side deck area, next time .. (was raining hard that day so, moving out there was a not an option...)  worth a try if you're a buffet/brunch aficionado as I am ...  I left with a full/satiated stomach .     salud ."}
{"text":"I have been trolling Spirit's Event Calendar for a few months waiting for the perfect event.  Then there is was:  Lasagna Night.  For $10, you get a small salad, a more than generous offering of Lasagna and a glass of Chianti.  This night was calling my name.  We arrive at 5:30 (good thing, lasagna ran out at 7:30) and sat at the bar.  There were tables with red gingham table cloths, really old world.  The bartender was friendly and service was great.  Right when any dish was dirty, BAM, it was gone.  The food was prompt and just enough.  Then, as were were eating our lasagna, we hear the harmonic tunes of Frank Sinatra!!  What an added bonus.  Spirit had a Frank Sinatra impersonator which was the icing on the cake.  It was A-MAZING.  People were dancing, he sang directly to me, it was dreamy.  I was told that Frank might not be there each week. This was the first night of $10 Lasagna and it seemed like a hit.  I am not sure that without Frank, that this night would have been as exciting.    I am nervous to go back to Spirit because I am not sure that they can top Lasagna night.  But I will sure try."}
{"text":"Went here for a concert...  What a disaster.  Imagine your friend's basement.  With really bad acoustics.  Without air conditioning. But on the second floor, so it gets hot.  I'd say it was at least 100 degrees there.  They didn't seem to sell water either.   I'd maybe return if I *really* wanted to see a show there.  But only in winter time."}
{"text":"I arrived at the stroke of 10pm on Halloween night ready to flex my Spirit fingers.  At $15, the cover for this Halloween event was pretty cheap so I wasn't expecting too much.  First up, an igloo-looking maze of sorts which was really just a tunnel to get from one of the 2nd floor to the other.  It was in that area that my crew spent most of our evening.  Death metal was playing downstairs, so we opted for the pseudo-electronic DJ and a bevy of delicious \"spirits\" upstairs instead.  My party didn't love the music and I'll admit, if the music was different/better we probably would've enjoyed our visit a little more, but I think we all had a good time just the same. All things considered, I'd return to Spirit, if only for the Fireball-based \"Polowski Mule,\" but it probably won't be at the tip top of my goin' out list.  I'll definitely try their Tuesday draft special - $3 for Pumpking? Sign me up."}
{"text":"This bar is weird.  The drinks are strong, the service is pretty fast, in general the layout is good. The artists they have here are usually incredibly unique, and sometimes they're good, too. I never had the pizza but I hear it's decent.  The big thing about this place is the parties. They're worth the high entry cost. Just make sure you always try to buy a ticket before you go if you plan on getting in. They can sell out.  What I think is 5-star worthy about this place is that it is not only completely unique, it creates a new vibe, does it well, and there is really nothing else like it that I have ever seen. It's like Tequila Cowboy for hipsters. I think Spirit is one of the only places in Pittsburgh that I would tell someone to come from NYC or LA and make sure they saw it."}
{"text":"First time here to see a guy in a band that we know. Jessie, you rock! We were much older than the typical crowd here. Everyone was very nice and respectful of each other. Good music and dancing with no drama. Parking nearby and cover charge. Several venues in one location. Full bar and some seating upstairs. Pizza looked good too!"}
{"text":"My favorite brunch spot. Great buffet with interesting salads, yogurt + granola +'fruits, zucchini fritters, biscuits and gravy, awesome pizza and other offerings.  Love that there is a live dj spinning chill tones. Family friendly as well. Perfect when we are running errands to dip in for a quick brunch or have drinks and leisure if we have time."}
{"text":"Spirit lounge is Lawrenceville's newest anything goes hipster venue. Redone from the former elks lounge it has two stories that offer entertainment and in house pizza back room called Slice Island and an outdoor patio.   Downstairs is kept very dark to give it a grungy vibe. The servers are overzealous charismatic person where you would just wish they would nose the lip ring but amazingly spirited fun people. Let them serve you up a mixed drink or serve a cheap can of beer to your preference and indulge in nightly activities from Sunday's Bingo Bango to Saturday night bands and dancing.   Now be sure to go get pizza. If hipsterism is not your style of dancing in a basement, be sure to at least come around to the back to get a slice of pie from Slice Island, you will not be disappointed. Ignoring the ongoing feud they are currently holding with another Bloomfield spot [not to be named], they serve light tagliare style [cut] on ciabatta bread with a focus on the toppings of veggies or meat. Dabbed spots of mozzarella covered my slice which was amazing, with fresh tomatoes and a sprinkle of mint. Fantastic.    The upstairs part of the lodge will be focused on events and of course more shows and nontraditional events that may not have space in the downstairs space, something to look forward to in the Fall. I hope to catch one of other hungry-hungry-human where you are on skateboard and utilize laundry baskets. [hellz yea]  Make sure to make this is a spot on your list when coming down Lawrenceville it definitely does not disappoint."}
{"text":"Well- known as an underground scenester enclave.  It's not pretentious but..... j'accuse.  I see it's potential but... as with Lawrenceville in specific and Pittsburgh in general, I'm usually disappointed.  No offense and none taken."}
{"text":"I attended an event at Spirit and had a great time! The space is large enough for a decent size crowd downstairs, with plenty of seating and a very large bar area. The beer was cold and the food was good! I wasn't upstairs, but I've heard it is also a great event space as well.   Hearing about this Sunday brunch has me interested! I certainly have it on my to-try list now!"}
{"text":"If your an artsy, retro hipster then this is your place. It's in an old moose lodge.  They have an all you can eat brunch buffet on Saturday and Sunday. You eat off of school cafeteria trays. There is a dj playing retro music and a bar.  I tried it and liked it. Most of the food was good. They had: Salads and hummus Different pizza... (could be better) Benguiets and French toast sticks Bacon Biscuits and delicious mushroom gravy and sausage gravy and syrup  Quiche and other choices Saw pics of donuts... DIDN'T see any on the buffet....  Would go back if was in the area."}
{"text":"This is the replacement for Belvedere's.  If you like Belvedere's, you'll like this place.  If you don't, you won't like it."}
{"text":"We came here for the pizza brunch which is in the basement and is pretty dark. It took quite awhile for our eyes to adjust to the darkness and it wasn't even a sunny day. I thought the space was pretty cool, but couldn't help but think I walked straight into a Portlandia episode. There were cat heads hanging from the ceiling, party lights, and a DJ who didn't really appear to be doing any DJing. The place was also full of hipsters, like literally every single diner, except for us. I don't have anything against hipsters, it just made me feel really out of place to be around such a high concentration of them all at once. It was probably the most hipsters I've ever seen in one place. Feelings of being out of place aside, we brunched on. The server was really nice and the selection was very unique for a brunch. There was obviously pizza, but there were also a couple unusual salads like a lentil/bean/root salad. The FRENCH TOAST though....that was something out of this world. Some of the best French Toast we've ever had. There was also sausage, which I didn't try because it looked a little overcooked. And then there was quiche and potatoes. They also had itsy bitsy carrot cake and smores bites. The one thing I thought was missing was eggs/bacon. I don't think I've ever been to a brunch without eggs/bacon."}
{"text":"One of the best drunken options in Lawrenceville. Seem to have a high turnover... good grimy, dive feel. Saw a GREAT open mic one night. R&B backline band was tight as HELL!   We went for a \"Bingo Bango Trivia\" night one Sunday night and the Emcee/comedian (female) was obnoxious and murdered the experience. The heavy metal guy bar dude was a prick as well. I'd be beerless and looking at him, yearning for a refill and he'd be gazing off into space (surely imagining an Manowar headlined European festival).   All in all-- the pizza is normally spot on but expensive. I think they make their own cheese and that's the best ingredient they've got. The school bus seating area is funny as it has an 'all local band' free jukebox."}
{"text":"Friendly, easy going bar with good live music.  My wife and I saw DIIV and were able to chat with some of the band   The pizza is excellent.  Risotto is made on site and is really good.  Good beer selection."}
{"text":"I had the Veg pizza. Yum! The crust a bit meh but the toppings were delicious, fresh, and innovative. The service at the bar was impeccable. The atmosphere typical social club with a touch of hipster thrown in for good measure.  ****What you really need to know is that Spirit the bar and Slice the pizza shop are separate entities. Spirit is cash only Slice is not.****  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"With the changes in pgh spirit follows the trend of turning Lawrenceville into the South Side. A friend and I who are both about 110 pounds each, were bullied and attacked (pulled by our hair to the ground and dragged across the dance floor) by at least 5 or 6 of Spirits angry overly aggressive Big Freedia Concert Patrons each of our attackers had atleast 50 to 100 pounds on us. All a result of 2 of the girls pushing me causing me to accidentally spill my drink on her (something that would typically happens at a packed concert, not that serious) Both my friend and I frequent Spirit quite often and have never seen our attackers there before. After, we were kicked out of the bar with our attackers with no protection. I was so shocked I only thought to call the police after the fact to press chargers. Clearly the demographic of people they're attracting to this bar is changing fast, which happens when you start attracting bigger acts. But the staff should consider what demographics of the acts they book pull out before hosting them- this has a big affect on the bar's environment.  This is not a place I feel safe at all, the bouncers are not trained or equipped to deal with confrontations like this. This was an absolutely terrifying experience, I will never go to this bar again, I will also be telling everyone I know that these sort of situations are accepted in this venue."}
{"text":"***BEST BAR ALERT***   Pizza? Check. Local bands, dj sets, dance parties? Check. Craft drafts, cheap cans, fresh and thoughtful cocktails? Check.   If you like any of the following, Spirit is the bar for you:  having fun, drank, bingo, trivia, cookouts, party bus, video games, gallery shows, non-profit  and community fundraisers, dancing, ample parking, sexy bartenders, BRUNCH BUFFETS, hipsters, punks, parents, squares, really old people?, bad boys, prank kweens, dirty birds, mozzarella, more fun.  In the short time that Spirit has been open, they've managed to do more innovative, fun, creative, and community driven events than any other bar or venue in recent memory. You can find me there a few times a week, whether it's for a dance party that has me taking my shoes off and shaking it *so good*, a happy hour catch-up cocktail with an old friend, a pizza party, or a lingering lazy hungover brunch.   Sometimes I will be on my way to a new event at Spirit and I'll have a moment of pause, thinking to myself, \"is this the night that Spirit has jumped the shark?\" But by the end, you realize that Spirit has just jumped onto the back of the shark, and is surfing along with it, pizza in one hand, party in the other"}
{"text":"I haven't been here at night, so I can't really speak to that. Their brunch, however, is AMAZING. Quick, easy, well-priced and delicious food.  It was $12 or $13 per person for a brunch buffet and I was blown away by the quality of the food. If you've ever had breakfast at a hotel, you know that sometimes breakfast buffets can be boring and disappointing. Everything here was great!!!!   They had a variety of food--- from salad to quiche to pizza. I had to struggle to control myself so I could try a little bit of everything. The quiche that they had might be the best quiche I've ever had! I don't know how they keep the eggs so fluffy and moist, but oh-my-god-yes. Biscuits, mushroom gravy, chickpea salad, french toast sticks-- had a few bites of everything. YUM!  They also had some vintage clothing and accessories for sale, as well as some records and comics. I picked up a sweet bright colored 90's hoodie for about $15.  Vegetarian and Vegan friendly options too!"}
{"text":"Came to an \"In Bed by Ten\" party a few weeks ago, and I can't wait to go back!  1. I love the concept of a dance party that ends at a reasonable time. I love dancing, but I don't love sloppy drunk people and getting home super late. \"In Bed by Ten\" helps me avoid those issues while still dancing to my heart's content.  2. DJ MB was amazing! Loved the music. He hit all those nostalgic songs and kept the energy high.  3. I love pickle backs and $5 is the right price. Highly recommend.  Word to the wise: they are cash only!"}
{"text":"This place has been open for a weeks.  We randomly stumbled upon it after our post dinner (pusadee's garden) walk.  We were feeling adventurous and thirsty and decided to wander in.  It's an old Moose Lodge- which makes for some interesting furnishings and a disco ball in the middle of the room- it's got a very charming dive/lodge feel.  Through the kitchen and in the back of the Lodge is a place to chill, play horseshoes or others enjoy your beverages outdoors.  The crowd was a mixed bag- but the average age seemed 20 something.  We were definitely on the oldest folks in the bar.   The drinks are great- no crazy tender bar concoctions but fresh juices for mixers and plenty of beer on draft.   My favorite drink of the evening was gin and juice-included gin, carrot juice, ginger.  I also got the Laura Palmer - a fabulous bourbon drink!  They have baby Budwiser cans for $1.   On Sunday nights (we were there on a Sunday evening) they play Bingo (aka Bingo Bango) for a chance to win pizza or a drink.  It's a silly, fun way to kill some time.  We won and got a piece of pizza (yes, I know we already ate dinner thank you.) and it was yummilicious!  They end Bingo Bango before 9 because they show Game of Thrones.  It seems like it's a mixed bag as to whether folks want to watch or not.  Seems like the staff isn't so much on GoT.  The reason I mention this is that if you come here to watch it can be annoying with all of the other convos from folks not into it.  But no big for us.   The staff is young and friendly.  The only opportunity for improvement is that the one bartender forgot our order 2 times- so we had to remind her.  I heard her apologize to other folks for forgetting- might have just been a 'one of those days.'  She was super responsive after we reminded her.   We DEFINITELY will be back and will bring some friends (cool ones) from the suburbs."}
{"text":"First let me say that this review is for the Sunday brunch, not a concert or stopping in for pizza  This brunch was awful. Do not go here for brunch. The food was served buffet style. Gross, failing nursing home buffet style. Dingy, Shawshank Prison buffet style. The Baltimore of buffets, a crime scene. Grade school French toast sticks, burnt half dollar sized sausage patties and a quiche that made me wish I had lost all five of my senses were the highlights. I think the granola was just cocktail nuts taken from the bar and coated in corn syrup. All self served into a plastic divided cafeteria tray and eaten with silverware salvaged from a Monongahela shipwreck. I would gladly have paid $13 to have the cook throw the food into a dumpster.   My drink was also gross. A michelada in name only. Watery, thinned out tomato juice and other suspect ingredients thrown into an 8oz glass served lukewarm. A glass of V8 with a Coors Light dumped into it would have been better by miles. They should call their version a Michenada, as in nada lot of flavor, nada lot of effort put into it and nada lot of pleasure forcing it down my throat.   Brunch is over. It's dead. And Spirit Lodge killed it. Don't go here for brunch. Don't go to brunch. Stay home and make your own noon on a Sunday breakfast. Also, it was hot as balls in that basement. Get a goddamn air conditioner!   Truth!"}
{"text":"The pizza is delicious. The dough is more of a bread and the sauce like a vodka pasta sauce. I've gotten delivery 3 times now and all have been super fast. Keep up the great work."}
{"text":"I am lucky enough to live just a few minutes up the hill from Spirit. The appearance of the place outside may seem a little rough, but don't let that stop you from going in and having one of the several local brews on tap, fresh signature cocktails, or a slice of their AWESOME pizza. Libations and delicious food aside, the atmosphere is great here. I have lived in a few different cities, and I have never been to a place with a crowd as consistently diverse as the one here (especially at the Bed By 10 dance parties)! This is a spot where absolutely anyone can come and just have a good time. I really love that.  I feel like I would be doing a disservice if I didn't mention one more time how phenomenal the pizza is. Our regular order is the white pizza with pork sausage, it is incredible and I don't think I will ever get tired of it.  Between all of that and great prices (and a nonconventional/more flexible happy hour) Spirit is one of the best spots in Lawrenceville."}
{"text":"You don't need to be a hipster to enjoy this dive bar. They kept the old Elk's Lodge sign at the entrance and just rolled with the wood-paneling in the bar area, so they aren't taking themselves too seriously.  I may be a closet hipster, but I arrived to the bar looking like a schoolmarm in my work clothes. The bearded dudes in flannel and the tattooed bartender didn't give me a second glance... they just assumed I'd want a cocktail list instead of a beer list. Once I corrected them, all was smooth sailing from there.  The draft list is short, but quality. They have a beer for every taste. I adored the Hop Farm Provision Saison recommended to me by a friend - has a very subtle hint of flavor that makes for a wonderful aftertaste. It was also $3 draft night, which really can't be beat.  Loved their pizza and love that it can be ordered by the slice. When your favorite pizza topping is anchovies it is difficult to get the haters to allow the salty little gems atop the cheese where they belong, so pizza by the slice becomes a delicacy. The crust reminded me of my beloved Beto's pizza, sturdy and with a soul-satisfying crunch! The sauce was not a dominant flavor, which is another quality that makes me weak in the knees. Quality cheese and salty anchovies slightly melted against that already delectable base and you've got one excellent slice of pizza. I only wished I had ordered more!"}
{"text":"OMG the most awesome pizza ever! It is a tad expensive but it is absolutely worth it! I've had both the traditional cheese pizza and the red pizza. My favorite was the red and my husband's was the cheese. I've only ever had take out so I can not comment on anything else. Looks like they have some cool events and the brunch always looks super crowded so it must be good!"}
{"text":"An important addition to PGH night life... not to mention a local pizza revelation!   BAR: The vibe downstairs is that of a relaxed social club, with good beer on tap, great cocktails, and affordable cans too. You don't have to spend a crazy amount of money to have a good time here. It's cool and approachable and hip for sure, but certainly not ultra-chic or pretentious. In fact, quite the opposite: Warm, fun, and anything-within-reason-goes. A mixed crowd tends to hang downstairs, including trendy 20 & 30-somethings, punks, and locals of all ages. The bar tenders are super nice and the staff is usually in a good, playful mood.  PIZZA: The pizza being made at their Slide Island pizza counter in the back of the building is nothing short of amazing. It's a more complex, higher-end pie than you're gonna find in Lawrenceville or Bloomfield. Square-cut, expertly prepared dough with a whole bunch of locally sourced meat and veg topping options. I always get two (or more) slices when I'm hanging out, but they also do take out... and there's no reason not to just pick-up a pie from here before a quiet night at home. It's a hell of a lot better than Vocelli's or Domino's, and still quite a bit better than the local chains too.   EVENTS: It's necessary to mention that the events here are some of the most fun, zany things being done in the city right now. DJ nights that run the gamut between techno, post-punk and new wave, early-90s all-female R&B, and more. Special events with amazing light shows (they were even covered in the Huffington Post in October 2015), tasty revisionist fish fry fundraisers, movie screenings, 90s-themed nights with tons of Sega and Nintendo games, pig roasts, brick oven pizza cook-off competitions, and even dance parties on schoolbuses outback. Really, no one else in PGH can touch the sheer ambition of what the Spirit crew is attempting here. Plus, lots national touring acts and great local indie performers.  This place is definitely happening now... don't miss out!"}
{"text":"This past Sunday one of the several times I've been to Spirit, and it's always been an eccentric and fun time! The first was for a music performance, the second was just to hang out, and this most recent visit was for Sunday's \"Bingo Bango.\"  Spirit is known for its pizza which is SO GOOD, but their drinks are also awesome. Last time I got a chard margarita and this time I got a tomatillo margarita and a few hot ciders. It's always a pleasant surprise to see what's on the menu for both food and drinks. Drinks can be a little pricey, which is the only drawback for me.  One of the coolest things about Spirit is the atmosphere. It's always super strange in a positive way and you really never know what to expect. Bingo bango is definitely not family appropriate, but it's a fun activity for friends or maybe even a date that doesn't mind something out of the ordinary!"}
{"text":"The first time I went to Spirit was to check out my friend's band, Shaky Shrines, on their opening night. It was insane. There were so many people and the place was packed. We waited almost and hour to get in (to be fair, there were about 20 of us that were together). It was not a great experience. Since then, i have gone back many times and I have to admit that my opinion has changed considerably.   To start with, the drinks are great. When I go at night, I generally stick to my usual whiskey and water but every once and a while a good cocktail is a great treat. Spirit plays on traditional cocktails but with a unique spin. They use fresh juices and shrubs to create thoughtful drinks that are refreshing (and keep you feeling guilt free). One of my favorites is the kale margarita!  Next, I should move on to their pizza. Oh my! It is tasty. This crusted, square pizza covered in cheese. A very pleasant surprise. I hear their specialty pies are really good but I stuck with a slice of traditional pepperoni. It was a little pricey (just over $3) but was a large piece sliced in two.  What I really love about Spirit is its existence as a music venue. I know that it has taken the arduous task of hosting 80's night while Belvedere's is closed for renovation but they have served as a location for much more than 80's night. I recently went their for Bike Fest 2015 to see Grand Piano and it was great. The weekend before I was there to see Wooly Woman and Dream Phone. It also was a host of RANT. It really makes me giddy to know that places such as Spirit, Cativo and Bayardstown are starting to really offer a home for local bands. There are many places i know that host shows (Howler's and weather permitting shows are also great) but I have really enjoyed how spacious Spirit is. I'm certainly not knocking any other location. I'm just really happy about the addition.  All in all, it is a great place that offers indoor and outdoor spaces, with great food and great music."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this joint after seeing an advertised art show on Facebook, but apparently this place only opened a few weeks back under this new name.  My first impression was that this place was going to be a gallery - but to my surprise it is  indeed a funny little dive bar that does it all - art on the walls, a projector that shows movies and the all important GOT on Sunday nights, plus their better than most bar and food selection. The interior is definitely a lodge-y feel with wood panel walls and quaint Christmas lights hanging as if you were hanging out in your parents basement.  The bartenders are friendly and timely. Since there isn't too much of a crowd, the bar staff has time to experiment and try some new mixology, ready to try a new combination as requested.  There was also more food than I expected. I saw a few groups of people ordering pizza, which were served on pizza boxes."}
{"text":"I thankfully leave just down the street from Spirit. Their pizza specials are always amazing. Sometimes the topping pairings sound like how in the world is this going to be good together?! But it always is! Definitely one of my favorite spots for pizza in the whole city."}
{"text":"I visited here for the first time yesterday, and I fell in love with the place . . . (heart symbol) Was attending a private event, and from the moment I saw the building (This was an old Fraternal Order of the Moose), and noticed the garden boxes with edible plants growing in them, and the cool painting on the wall announcing \"PIZZA,\" I had a good feeling about it.  Once inside, the feeling stayed, and I felt at home right away.   At the bar I ordered a draught of \"Fighting Elleck\" Cider, locally brewed at nearby Arsenal Cider Works.  The function provided various styes of square pizzas, from plain red sauce and cheese to pepperoni, and even a white pizza with mushrooms, and a spicy Sicilian style with red peppers, all the pizzas I tasted were glorious!    After our function ended, there was a band coming in to set up, so I suppose they provide live entertainment here also.   I'll have to look into that for the next time I come back . . . this place is really cool . . . Spirit Lodge . . . Awesome!!!!  P.S.  I forgot to mention the artwork on the walls . . . lots of it, and very cool stuff.  I even saw a painting of my friend on the wall, who is recovering from breast cancer, so that was something I never expected . . . so yeah, cool art too . . . !!!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our brunch here. The pizza was always hot and fresh.  The bacon was excellent."}
{"text":"Weirdest, darkest, but delicious-est all you can eat brunch for $15 that I've ever attended. It's in the basement, so your eyes have to adjust. Then you realize that the disco ball is spinning and the DJ is blasting some jams while a 3 year old takes it away on the dance floor. You have some biscuits with gravy or berry compote, quiche, fresh grapefruit slices, salad decorated with mandolined radishes, exquisite pizza, and perfect $3 cold-brew coffee (or included free bottomless drip!). You leave happy.  UPDATE: Tried brunch out on the patio (I was a fool before for not realizing its glory!), and it was fabulous as expected. Going to keep coming back to this gem."}
{"text":"Cool, minimalist with character in a run down but cool old gymnasium concert hall kind of way.  Downstairs feels like the Old upstage.  Djs, a bit darker but cool venue."}
{"text":"Judgesters beware this place will be hard for you to swallow.   Everyone else who isn't a b-hole, you can probably have a good time here. There is a decent variety of drinks and cocktails to tickle your fancy and pickle back shots for $5 a pop. Not a bad deal and virtually a guaranteed good time. The outdoor area in the back calls for some super chill vibes but management is nice and keeps it down for the neighbors; No music after dark it seems.  The pizza here is woo-worthy. Perfect drunk menu to grab everything your drunken heart desires. Fried cheese, fresh pizza, fresh toppings. It really is just a match made in heaven for anyone who likes to drink, have a conversation and perhaps grab a bite to eat.  Two things that suck:  The cover charge every time you go. The talent performing seven times out of ten.  I know that is hypocritical to say based on the way I started this review, but Spirit isn't a ton of fun every time because the music is THAT bad. The fact that you have to pay to find out if it is bad or not adds insult to injury. We often send in a recon friend to see if it is any good at all before everyone pays $5 for a headache. I have definitely gone and enjoyed the music there big-time though, hence the 4-star rating.   Personally, I enjoy it and really wish they would bring back the roller-skate night they had once a month when belvedere's burned down, because I enjoyed it around about 1 billion times more at Spirit where the air wasn't toxic."}
{"text":"\"If you didn't know this was here, you wouldn't know this was here,\" was the review given by +1 last night.  I'm guessing this mostly refers to its appearance as a nondescript, closed looking former Moose Lodge with really good drinks (hence the fine logic).  To look dim and divey, and then serve cocktails with mint lemonade and arugula pizza is an example of what Pittsburgh should be going for.  Long bar, cozy round booths, and a dark dance floor makes it for me. Bingo and Game of Thrones on Sundays, the early In Bed By Ten party on Fridays, and \"Slice Island\" pizza (!) .. I'm really excited about Spirit Lodge.  The staff was super surprisingly friendly and quick when I expected at least a little snoot, especially on a busy 80s night temporarily being hosted for Belvedere's.   Check the event calendar on their site, I guarantee there is something this week that you would be into.  Just don't be put off by the dark facade and hoard of youths blocking the entrance (nonsmoking establishment, you'll have that). Get a rum swizzle, a pizza, and enjoy some Oingo Boingo on your Thursday evening."}
{"text":"Overall chill hipster vibe.  Doorman and cashier were very welcoming. When I went to order a drink the bartender (guy) started speaking broken Spanish to me because I look Hispanic. I responded in English and he refused to serve me.  Not exactly sure what the hell that was about. 1st time I've felt discrimination (if that's even what that was) in Pittsburgh. Won't be going back there."}
{"text":"Yo, listen: perusing these reviews, I notice that everyone has some lame and mostly difficultly judgmental anti-whatever just-being-funny-you-can't-take-a-joke opinion about Spirit. I just want to say that Spirit is rad as hell and it doesn't matter who you are.  The bartenders are cool; the beer list is worthwhile, the cocktails are cheap. The food menu is a gem; the pizza crust is always crispy, the grilled cheese and tomato soup hits the spot. The downstairs has music and installations. The upstairs has weirdo events.  The crowd that this place pulls is eclectic. From well-dressed yuppies to hipsters to older Yinzers to the random wanderers, everyone is always smiling and having a good time. The dance floor doesn't always fill up, but if you want to dance, then dance!  This place is so accepting of all types of people from all types of backgrounds with all types of interests, and their diverse list of events only furthers that mentality. They don't judge, so why would you?"}
{"text":"The one downfall with the food scene in Lawrenceville is not much is open for food past 10 PM (11 PM on weekends). Last Thursday I remembered Slice Island stays open late (until 1 AM Thursday through Sunday) so we drove down to check out the menu and grab a drink from Spirit. The staff at Slice Island was so kind, very open to answering questions we had about the menu. After asking if their Italian salad dressing was homemade the owner went on to explain that everything in the kitchen is made from scratch and all the meats and vegetables (when in season) are sourced locally. Major attraction! We ended up ordering the cheese pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni on half. Pizzas are rectangular, about 16 pieces total. It was exceptional! Cheeses were so fresh and the toppings were delicious, as was the red sauce. Best pizza we've had in Lawrenceville to-date. Can't wait to go back in the near future and get it again. Also ordered the house salad with homemade Italian dressing, that too was so fresh and delicious. They have lots of great toppings for the pizza and some other menu items that sounded great. Oh we also had the fudge brownie with nuts, it was divine and baked to perfection. Huge additional to the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I've been here for shows and special events many times, however recently was at the basement bar for the first time. My experience centered specifically around the pizza. I Got there at 2.45pm on a Sunday, and they don't start serving pizza until 3pm so NBD, we just hung out and got a drink. When 3 came and I tried to order 2 slices at the bar, the bartender said \"so 2 vegan slices w pepperoni?\" And I said \"Do you only have vegan? I'd rather have regular\" And she goes \"We only have vegan pizza... we make our own vegan cheese. it's really good. The pepperoni is meat tho.\" I thought ok, that makes no sense, but I'm down to try new things. Sure why not. I SHIT YOU NOT, THAT CONVERSATION HAPPENED. My friend was there and heard the entire thing go down. Well, I realized after looking at the menu & talking to people actually eating the pizza that they have regular non-vegan pizza, and after asking a different bartender- who was a hairy condescending dick btw- that they ONLY have regular pizza, NO VEGAN PIZZA AT ALL. Seriously WTF....?  I finally got some regular pizza and it was actually pretty awesome. Now that I know the deal I guess I'd go back again.... but what a shitshow."}
{"text":"Converted from an old Moose Lodge, this place is too darn cool (maybe for its own good??nah...) Solid happy hour, great pizza, and amazing parties.  Always the place when no one can decide on where to go--a real crowd pleaser"}
{"text":"Had the Sunday brunch. The decor in the basement area was definitely not classy but interesting. All of the food was very good, and for only a $15 buffet! Great selection of both breakfast meat (bacon) and lots of vegan and gluten-free items. They make fresh salads and several pizzas for the buffet which I'm told switch from one weekend to the next. Don't go by outward appearance of the building...try it!"}
{"text":"if you want to eat grossly overpriced scraps of terribly conceived / horribly executed food in the musty basement of a hipster social club, you've found the right spot.  an hour into brunch service, 3/4 of the \"buffet\" was empty. dirty cafeteria trays were provided for us to pick through the scrapings of whatever stuck to the bottom of empty pans while we waited for the kitchen staff to debate whether or not they felt like working the other 4 hours of their shift and refill any of it... because, you know, life is hard and #whoworksonsundays?  a salad of unseasoned elbow macaroni, old greens, and oil was a great start. the stale \"garlic bread\" resembled used pizza crust pulled from the trash can, a great compliment to the flavorless hummus that had a grainy texture you'd find while wiping the day after eating an entire container of peanuts. the pizza options, all of which appeared to have been cooked under their respective heat lamps for the last 18 hours, were all tainted by an overwhelmingly foul taste of olives. biscuits and gravy? non existent, unless I wanted to combine crumbs and the cold crusted edge of gravy overflow onto the steam table. french toast sticks? nah, but I could have eaten spoonfuls of crumbs and cinnamon sugar. bacon? nope, but I could have soaked up the fat in the pan with a napkin and sucked on it for satisfaction. crispy potatoes! those were average. great way to supplement the default ketchup diet that was about to be embarked on. zucchini fritters.. my god. fried in oil that clearly hadn't been changed since the first hipsters invaded lawrenceville, these pucks of stiff, oily, filth would not only suck all of the moisture out of your body, but may continue on to take your soul if you don't stop to take a drink of Flint's finest imported tap water (complimentary to the table!).   wait, a new pan of food! my curiosity runs wild... quiche! I really could have gone for some quiche. the guy in front of me scoops out a rectangle of something that resembles a stiff custard, the outer crust giving up and falling away like a dry scab. I'm there and haven't had anything that resembles a meal, so I take it. it jiggles like a jar of warm vaseline and has a gummy brown filth on top. still no bacon as a life preserver. a few biscuits have appeared and a half full pan of gravy... take two biscuits, scoop gravy from the depths. sausage and sage? ok, could be safe. I sit and try the biscuits... cold, doughy, smothered in a flour heavy lava with crumbs of what could be sausage. I'd prefer an MRE. move to the \"quiche\". what in the mother f***... a closer look reveals a look of gelatinous tofu, tastes nothing of eggs, cream, herbs, or anything else that a quiche is made from. pure unadulterated filth. i want to throw up but i couldn't lose the precious calories from potatoes and ketchup. I quit. the coffee is as terrible as expected.   $15 for that experience. unreal what people consider to be respectable food and atmosphere. please close your kitchen, and may god have mercy on your souls."}
{"text":"Late night music and good pizza! I visited Spirit for the first time for their Summer Recess. I wish they'd do this more often - it was great (outdoor live music, outdoor bars, seating...). After the event outside, we ventured inside and enjoyed that as well. They have a downstairs and upstairs area so there is plenty going on in regards to their night scene. They serve pizza all night in the back corner of the downstairs level and it hit the spot. Definitely a more hipster type crowd here."}
{"text":"Extremely rude bartender. A perfectly coiffed blond man served us a round of PBR pounders begrudgingly and after half an hour, came back to us at the bar (not to offer us another round) and told us he would cut us off if we didn't stop talking about how we were not an ultra-fan of his friend's band playing onstage. This band was the first of two opening bands which is almost beside the point because our conversation is NONE OF HIS BUSINESS. I'm sorry we tipped him on the first round, he needs to get over his impossibly hipster self.  I will make sure to spread the word as a local, and a previously frequent visitor."}
{"text":"Overall it's a cool place...although pizza is overpriced and not that great...but its convenient when you're drunk... nice staff"}
{"text":"Once I heard about an all-you-can-eat brunch AND pizza buffet, I had to check it out. My friends and I were armed and ready to get our morning grub on, but eating off of our old elementary school cafeteria trays in a dimly lit dungeon was not exactly what we were expecting.  The atmosphere was very hipster and has its own charm, but the food was mediocre at best. I went with a party of 5 and no one was impressed with the food. They had typical brunch food like french toast, quiche, and sausage (no bacon, eggs or toast though) but there was also pita with hummus, lentil salad, various desserts, and of course, pizza. I've heard a lot of the hype surrounding their pizza, and it was good but definitely not great. Maybe we can blame that on my unwavering loyalty to Pizza Hut. I will give them credit for being very vegetarian friendly. There were several vegetarian pizza options as well as mushroom gravy for the biscuits, something I usually don't see.   I definitely do not see myself coming back here. Though it's one of the cheaper brunch buffet options ($13 - their website says $11 but that's incorrect), I would rather pay a little extra for better food and actual plates. FYI it is cash only, but there is an ATM there."}
{"text":"I love everything about Spirit. They have the ability to gather crowds from all walks of life and it works. This is a fun place to see bands, have brunch, eat pizza, attend an art show. Everything the try seems to be a success. I like the various themes of events like the Pancakes and Booze art shows. $5 gets you in the door to see local art and eat all of the pancakes you can. The Bloody Mary bar at brunch is really brilliant. Just recently they had a light installation in display from a local artist (The Vault) that I wish could be there permanently.  Spirit is a concept that I would gladly take any out of town guest to see. And the food...OMG brunch is always fresh and the pizza, wow...definitely some of my favorite in town."}
{"text":"So I have been here twice now and my opinion about it is totally divided.    The location is cool, big and divey.  There is outdoor seating and a really impressive garden In back.  There is also lots of parking.  The first time we went it was a Sunday and we played Bingo Bango, which is just bingo for Pittsburghers.  The pizza was excellent I got a margarita slice and a veggie slice which was a delicious combo of kale and lemon.  They also have a meat option.  On the second visit I got a cocktail which was really good, gin and juice made with real juice,  I think it was Apple, cucumber, ginger and carrot.  I would like to try there other cocktails at some other point.    This week the pizza options were different, as they change on a weekly basis, but they still have three, margarita, meat or veggie.  The veggie this week was broccoli, and yes they used fresh broccoli, moz, cheddar, breadcrumbs and ranch.  The ranch was house made and looked like something I would make at home, which  I appreciated!  They do make it in house, I asked.  However this combo is not something I would ever choose if I have the option for other veggie varieties.    There was not much broccoli on it, and the pieces were really small.  It was fine though I didn't hate it I just think it was kind of a bizarre combo and like the kale and lemon a lot better!    When we went up to order another piece I wanted to give them my feedback, but the person who was assisting us seemed to not care about what I was saying and did not seem interested in hearing it.  I was not being rude I just like to give feedback at restaurants sometimes.    I also wanted to ask about the pizza buffet they have during the week and what that is like. He didn't really seem to want to answer me, brushed me off by saying it just has two types of pizza on it ( which doesn't sound like a buffet to me).  The second slice we got took forever!  I kept on checking back for it until finally asking where is was after 40 mins ( we were hanging and drinking so it didn't feel like that much time) turns out he took it off the counter and put it above the oven...why did he do that?  Was it just to be rude? Not sure...Obviously that slice was terrible and we were not happy about it, but because we were with friends I didn't make a big deal of it.   Moral of the story is I am not intimidated by hipsters, but I don't have time for rude or pretentious ones.    I would give Spirit another shot and maybe adjust my rating.  But for now it seems like they had a great start but that has not been sustained."}
{"text":"In Bed By 10 is a must!! Super fun throw back dance party once a month that gets out refreshingly early. This is a really cool repurposed gym that invites a really diverse crowd. The pizza is TO DIE FOR!! I can't think of a better pairing than dancing your socks off to 80s music and enjoying a slice with crazy cool toppings. In Bed By 10 always donates covers to a cool local charity too, so points for that! I love Spirit and it embodies all that is weird and good about Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Overpriced and with an attitude. But the ambiance is awesome. And I felt super hip while I was there. Even though I never could figure out which door to enter.  The pizza is some of the worst pizza I've ever eaten. And I taught elementary school after Michelle Obama's dietary school lunch changes. One piece is halfway flexible and then stiff like hard like a brick. The other completely hard like a brick. It's inedible. Absolutely disgusting. I mean to the point that my dogs wouldn't eat it. And those two eat everything. Please see my other reviews!  The crust is so hard on the one piece that the dogs are using it to drag it around the house and play with it by flipping it in the air and chasing it around. That doesn't seem right! It's really really hard and the toppings don't fall off."}
