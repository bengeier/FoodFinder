{"text":"We love Monday night trivia   Best night to come.  They offer a $5.99 steak, fries and salad dinner.  Waitress are friendly so show up on Monday or you are missing out"}
{"text":"Great place to eat, the burgers and salads are amazing with excellent service.  Every Monday night they have a trivia night which is a lot of fun"}
{"text":"Food is good.Service is not up to mark.Noisy bar.Drinks are not made to the same standard.You should repeat every time."}
{"text":"Been going there on and off for three years.  My question is what happened?  Last year the food was well above average, almost great.  This year average is something they are still shooting for.  They must have lost a chef.  Last year, their menu was had some of the best sandwiches I have EVER eaten, including a Meatloaf Sandwich with chipotle mayo, a Pot Roast Melt with a Hollandaise sauce and sandwich specials that were creative and delicious.  This year, the good sandwiches are off the menu.  The cooking is inconsistent.  On Thursday they have a pork chop special.  Sometimes it is so dry that all their beer couldn't help me swallow it.  And sometimes it is OK.  Just OK.  I recently had a turkey melt that almost made me throw up.  How do you mess up a turkey melt?  Back to bland old bar food.  You can get that anywhere."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The food is great and the beer selection everything you could ask for and so much more. 

We were here on a Tuesday night. Meagan was our server and she did a great job taking care of our table of 12. Drinks were brought to the table as we ordered and the food shortly thereafter. 

Had the buffalo chicken wrap and fries. Outstanding. A friend of mine ordered the rueben which was surprisingly good. When you've got to compete with Slymans, Mulligans did a very good job. 

Others in our group had wings, chef salad, Cajun chicken, and 1 of the 10 different burgers on the menu. No one went away hungry. 

Equally as good are the TVs. The is July, but we were watching baseball like March Madness. It was way cool."}
{"text":"Very nice Bar and great food. All they need is Buzztime trivia because no one in this area has it! If they had it I would give them a five star. 3 minutes away from my house. Please get Buzztime trivia their business would double with that game."}
{"text":"Got a Facebook article that this was THE place to watch the World Cup in Cleveland. Bad mistake!
Apparently someone called off or wasn't called to be in early or something because it's all the ladies working could talk about. It was 2+ hours of finger pointing and name calling while just trying to have some wings and beers and watch the game. Will NOT be back.  I can deal with slow service, I can't deal with the bad attitude."}
{"text":"We love coming to this place for their sandwiches. their burgers are great so are their sandwiches the service is great& good prices. We like their daily specials are great too."}
{"text":"Not impressed with the food. 

The place itself is nice. Decent selection of beer. 

Our server was very nice. The menu was decent. 

We had multiple things on the menu and we just thought all of it was fair. 


There are many better places in the area to go. 

For us - this is a one and done"}
{"text":"Good food, good service and plenty of screens to watch multiple games on!!!  Love the wings.  Has everything I look for in a sports bar!"}
{"text":"Mulligans has been actively on groupon for the past couple months so I decided to give it another try. There have been many upgrades here in the past few years. 

The food here is outstanding - my favorite is the Parmesan fries, zucchini planks, and the Cajun chicken wrap. 

Sometimes it is difficult to get a seat or table during happy hour - they don't have a hostess or anyone to seat you so just wait around for someone to get up. 

I would also like to comment on planning a party in their party room. They have an awesome space you can use for a larger get together & they are extremely helpful and accommodating. Their catered food is reasonably priced too. 

If you don't have time to sit and eat - they have quick carry out too."}
{"text":"Decent depending on who's bartending. If you're there during the afternoon or for breakfast on the weekends the bartenders are straight up rude ass beyotches. 

Mostly an older crowd and mostly dudes. Good for a beer if you're in the neighborhood. Wings are great."}
{"text":"Mulligans offers a great atmosphere to enjoy game and eat great meal . The service is always great and we had the best bar food in Cleveland."}
{"text":"After stopping at a Thai restaurant in Strongsville recommended by fellow Yelpers only to find when arriving at 3 PM, that they close from 3-4;00 PM, we stopped here for a late lunch.!  
It was Friday, and the wet-board announced perch, perch and shrimp, and scampies as their specials.
I went for the perch, and the lady for wings, we both were thinking of bouncing up the side to pierogi for a couple extra bucks, but at $2;00/pierogi it was cheaper to order a pierogi dinner instead, so we did.
There were 4 pieces of perch in the $12.00 dinner that may have cumulatively weighed 2- 3 ounces, not exactly a hearty dinner. 
One \"filet\" was small enough I initially mistook it for a french fry!
It was accompanied by fresh- from- the- freezer- french- fries, and a thimble full of cole slaw, and a like sized portion of tartar sauce.
The pierogi were leathery, large and lousy, (4 points for alliteration!)  
But they do get points for not tossing Mrs. T's grocery store frozen ones in the skillet, even though they would have been more palate-pleasing!
The wings were dry, almost to the point of being hard to chew.
The cole slaw was the highlight of the meal.
The service was fair after getting off to a shaky start.
All in all this is probably a great place to drink!"}
{"text":"Much improved since the remodel/expansion. The food is good and the service is usually pretty quick. They can get under staffed at times, but still not bad."}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from me so I have been here on several occasions.  The service is average, the food is average, and the atmosphere is very casual.  

They do have a few pool tables and lots of TV's but this place is nothing special.  They did just open a nice patio, and expanded the restaurant.  

Perfect spot to just grab a quick drink or some greasy bar food, but that's about it."}
