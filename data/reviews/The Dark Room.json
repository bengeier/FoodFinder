{"text":"I really like going there...Sometimes they have some weird music going on but usually it's Metal and stuff that sounds like it ^^ They have a Jukebox as well. Prices are good. Always make sure you check out their specials. Everything is Halloween themed!"}
{"text":"Poorly made drinks, and a few regulars in this place make it a place to avoid. There is a reason every place in this plaza is packed, and there were only eight people in here."}
{"text":"Totally a cool place to stop by and have a drink or a quick bite to eat ... pool or darts is a fun way to relax and enjoy your night .... don't be afraid  to enjoy yourself there... you will .... promise !!"}
{"text":"Cool local hang out. I love all the cool movie posters and the d√©cor. They have a pretty good menu and the drink specials galore. I love the environment."}
{"text":"Our usual haunt was packed to the brim, so we came to the dark room instead... Love it!! The horror movie vibes are so cool and the place is so laid back. Only stayed for two drinks but will definitely be back for some pool and more monster-themed cocktails!"}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first visit. Since there were no vegetarian sandwich or wrap options we got appetizers. The onion petals were great! I loved the theme and decor!! We will be back next week! Owners if you see this, add maybe a veggie wrap or burger too the menu."}
{"text":"Awesome metal bar in a totally random, preppy suburb.  They have great punk and metal tunes on the juke box..more popular stuff (misfits, slayer..yawn.) but Ill take it!  Its in a strip mall (gotta love the suburbs) with some italian place and a choch bar that has cover bands play all the time.  The clientele at Dark Room though is all types, which is cool.  They usually have pretty good beer and shot specials daily.  I havnt tried the food but I guess they serve lunch now too.  So come get your Ronnie James Dio on and throw back some drinks!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I both love coming here. It has a horror theme and plays metal music/alternative. If you identified with any of the music grouos in highschool (scene/hardcore/metal kids etc) you'll love it here. Tanya is a great bartender, drinks are reasonably priced and have unique horror - themed names! Pool table and dart board if you're into that as well as DJ Syn on Wednesdays and Fridays (or one of the weekend days)."}
{"text":"Went her to watch the \" Game of Thrones\"  Lot of seating at the bar and along the wall.  Good  Selection of craft beers, usual bar food:  fries, chicken strip, cheeseburgers. Good The bar is dark as the name implies and televisions are place so everyone can see them"}
{"text":"Awesome place!! Not your typical bar though in that they play horror movies all night along with airing new episodes of \"The Walking Dead\" and \"Game of Thrones\" whenever they're on along with Cavs, Indians, and Browns games!! Great staff and one of a kind atmosphere"}
