{"text":"Delicious!  The pizza crust and sauces make any toppings sing.  Even better are a very unique and authentic Italian dish -Rice Ball/Arancini. They are so amazing!"}
{"text":"This fine establishment is newly opened and the focus is on fresh and daily made AUTHENTIC Italian food just as the name reflects.  The owner, Charlie, goes out of his way to contribute to the community and one fine example is of him personally donating 8 of his delicious pizza's to support a nearby hockey rink establishment.  Charlie will go the extra mile to ensure his customers are satisfied and leave happy.  Bryce, it's unfortunate you feel the way you do about your dining experience, I can assure you that pizzas are fresh, the sauce is freshly made with an authentic recipe and not bought pre-packaged.  As for the Arancini, they are outstanding and quite substantial and full of rich flavour.  The sauce compliments this dish and it's quite generous.  By the way, good rustic food is meant to be messy when you eat that's what the entire experience is all about.  Fine dining establishments you can find along King Street West.  This is homestyle, delicious and authentic Italian cuisine passed down from generation to generation. It doesn't get any better.  I highly recommend that you  give this place another try and Charlie will personally see to it that you come away with a much more enjoyable experience as he is very approachable."}
{"text":"Love the food. Hate the service.  The delivery is terrible (takes forever to get to your house) if there is even a driver working. If you go in the restaurant, you have to wait about 20 minutes to get your food and there is only two tables.  

This guy took over Columbo's on Danforth before it shut down. He increased the prices a lot at this new place and gives worse service. Doesn't make sense."}
{"text":"I was really turned off when the owner's friend called me out in a review following my original review so I avoided this place for months. Yesterday I was too hungry to cook again so I said what the hell and stopped in for a slice. I was impressed this time. It was really tasty. Tonight I decided to investigate further and ordered a whole pizza to take home for dinner. The guy asked if I wanted it well done, I said a little less well done. They took it serious enough to bring the pizza out of the oven to show me and ask if it was cooked the way I liked it. Rockstar move. When he rang it in it was also cheaper that what I'd added up from their menu on the bus. I can't complain about that. I ordered double cheese and there was sooo much cheese. Probably enough to kill a normal person. Loved it. I got it home and took a bite. It was exactly what I had hoped it would be. It's still not fancy pizza and you can't really take a date there, but the food has come a long way it seems. I know I'll be back.

UPDATE: I had the opportunity to try the rice ball today. It was great. A little crunch on the outside, soft and moist on the inside, stuffed with beef, peas, and cheese. I only ate half and it was pretty filling. If it's an app, share it with a friend, otherwise it'd make a nice little meal on it's own."}
{"text":"Corrado's (formerly Colombo's on the Danforth) is an amazing place to fix that quick Italian hankering. Their Napoletana (with Sausage) is out of this world. The owner Charlie really goes out of his way. Amazing place to eat!"}
