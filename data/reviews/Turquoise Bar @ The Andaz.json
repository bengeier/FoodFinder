{"text":"Service is great and the drinks are fantastic. Prices are a little high but that's what you expect at a poolside bar."}
{"text":"Love this little cocktail oasis at a he main pool at the Andaz. Fun drink menu (love the pina colada with the dark rum floater), snow cones (virgin for the kiddos, alcoholic for the adults) and snacks (try the watermelon! SO YUMMY, fresh, healthy and tasty!)   Joe, the main bartender, is super friendly, offers excellent service and can be creative with your cocktail...if you need to go \"off the grid\"! Jordan is an awesome server at the pool, who offers big smiles, quick service, and keeps an eye on your things if you need to step away.   We came to the pool all four days of our stay - loved every day, every minute. THANK YOU!"}
