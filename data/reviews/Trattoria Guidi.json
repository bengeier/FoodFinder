{"text":"Guidi's used to be my favourite local restaurant (admittedly they've never had much competition) but in recent years sadly they've gotten a wee bit too big for their boots! Their prices have risen as their portions have decreased, their service has got slower and their staff have become less attentive. Their food is mostly lovely but far too expensive for what you get and their location. The restaurant inside is nice, there's a good atmosphere if it's busy especially at Christmas or when a diner has a birthday. They do takeaway too, and will deliver (eventually) or you can pick it up yourself. Nearby Little Italy does a very similar menu at much more reasonable prices - I tend to get takeaway from here these days."}
{"text":"our anniversary dinner what a joke!
we arrived at resturant at 7.30pm were shown to our table and a drinks order taken right away.we then waited 20mins for our order to be taken and at 8pm our starters arrived. at 8.30pm the head waiter came and said what is going on here have you had your starters we told him we had.at 8.35pm we asked for the bill saying that we had not received our main meal and were just going to leave he then went to find out about our meal he returned and told us because we had asked for a 16oz steak it was taking longer because it was so thick (what a joke)we then again asked for the bill the head waiter then threw his arms in the air and walked away,he walked over to the girl at the cash desk and said something to her we walked over to pay for what we were already given 
1 pint lager 2 soft drinks 2 minestrone soup (bit cold)and a portion of mozzerella sticks)total cost £23.00.
i then asked for the telephone number for the owner and was given it then was told he was in the resturant i asked if i could speak to him a waitress went to ask him if he would speak to me only to be told that he was too busy (not good buisness sense in my opinion)we paid the bill and left.we occasionally visited guidis but no more the head waiters attitude left a lot to be desired and as for the owner not coming and speaking to us well what more can i say.
thanks to all at guidis for spoiling our wedding anniversary"}
{"text":"An Italian restaurant opposite from Dimaggio's. This is a nice restaurant and I have been here on a few occasions (special occasions and just out for a meal) staff are helpful and friendly and I have always found the food to be good quality. It is nothing spectacular and I wouldn't call it authentic Italian, but it is lovely."}
{"text":"This is quite a nice place to eat, the quality and prices can be compared to TGI Fridays (so its expensive, and not authentic Italian, but decent quality) It has a nice atmosphere and I have always found staff to be attentive and friendly. I have received excellent service when I have been out with a party of 15 and when dining as a couple."}
{"text":"I'm lucky enough to live within walking distance of Guidis so I'm somewhat of a regular. The reviewer above is right in that it can get really busy at the weekends but I think the hustle and bustle adds to the authentic Italian feel that the restaurant has. And even though it gets really busy, there's usually lots of staff to deal with it. On a couple of occasions I've had a bit of a wait but I love the place so it wouldn't put me off. Prices are more in line with that of city centre venues than other Airdrie restaurants but the food is definitely worth it. I always go for the Mozzarella Sticks and Spaghetti Bolognaise, my partner would recommend the Penne Arrabiatta or Penne a'Matriciana. All in all definitely worth a visit, especially for special occasions - also worth noting that takeaway/delivery is also available. I'm embarrassed to admit that I have been known to get a delivery despite the fact that I live about ten minutes away. Ah well, it's Airdrie, it gets cold out."}
{"text":"Guidis is well known in the local area as a high class resteraunt - this over the last few years has changed - I last visited a couple weeks back and was disappointed. On a normal Sunday afternoon it would be full and had such a great atmosphere - whether it be the credit crunch or something else I am not sure, but it certainly isnt like this anymore. The food was stunning as always, can always recommend the mussells, however it is over-priced, the service is slow and dead slow Shame, used to be a place of so much more...."}
{"text":"This Italian restaurant provides the best of food in lovely surroundings, can be quite busy at times which affects the ambiance of the place, but service & staff are excellent, with nothing too much touble. The premises are situared on the main road between Airdrie & Coatbridge, but there is ample parking at the back of the restaurant. Although pricey, perhaps worth a try at least once."}
{"text":"Have been here before and thought previously it was an over expensive Italian restaurant with bland food.
Decided to try again as the is very little in airdrie but had a take a way instead.
It was great.......could not believe the difference compared to last time.
Great pasta in generous servings.
Very impressed and would recommend.........ah well....suppose you have to give somewhere a second chance......pleased I did.....still expensive for what it is though."}
{"text":"My wife and I visited this restaurant on the 18th of August, to celebrate my wifes' birthday. What a let down, we were greeted by a male waiter, and shown to our seats, fine, he was very civil, and took our drinks order, which arrived in a short time. (one star for that)
Then another waiter with an Italian accent took our meal order, we asked for fillet steak, but there was none, so my wife asked for fish and french fries, he came out with the quip,  would you like it wrapped in a newspaper we should have left at that point. however I ordered sirloin steak, with minestrone soup for a starter, the portion would not have filled a teacup.
This was dished up within 15 minutes. But the rest of the meal was served up an hour and fifteen minutes later, one of the female waitresses apologised when we were waiting and said it will only be a couple of seconds however it was another half hour. The steak was tough and I am sure it had been pre-cooked as it was also very dry, the french fries were all right, I would guess the were Mcains. Never again. Expensive and not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Although I wouldn't class Guidi's as an authentic Italian restaurant more of an upmarket pizza and pasta place, I do think that the food is good. I have visted Guidi's on numerous occasions and have never had a bad meal. It is pricy for what you get though but they can get away with it due to lack of competition in the area. Big plus point is their salad dressing which is divine and you can even buy a bottle to take home with you."}
{"text":"Guidis used to be a very small Italian restaurant which got very popular. It has since extended twice and is lovely inside with a nice conservatory area at the rear. There is a car park onsite. The service has always been very good in here and food tends to ready quite quickly. They also have a take away service - ideal if you fancy a nice meal but don't want to go out. The menu is available online. I can recommend 'pollo impanato' and any of the steaks. They also do pizza and pasta - the menu selection is fantastic. For special occasions like birthdays, if you take a cake, the staff will get everyone's attention and bring it to your table while singing happy birthday."}
{"text":"Used to be good in years gone by, but has went downhill dramatically. This started out as a small pub which done fantastic food, cooked by the owner. Then word got about and everyone wanted to try this place. It got bigger and bigger with extentions being added several times. It has gotten too big now, my last experience was a dodgy salad which gave me the runs. I would not go back. This place is a victim of it's own success I'm afraid."}
{"text":"Guidi's restaurant is quite a rarity around my patch of Lanarkshire. I can probably count on one hand the number of good restaurants that I have been to, or been recommended to visit, so dinner here was a long time coming.

We booked a table for late on Friday night, about half past 9, and expected to be rushed because the restaurant shut at 10.30pm. When we arrived, we were greeted by a few members of waiting staff and a chef which I have never saw in any restaurant before! The place was quite empty, so we could choose a booth and settle down to have a look at the menu. 

The general décor of the place is really very nice. I usually prefer my restaurants, especially Italian, to be smaller and darker, and this place was massive and very bright and airy. The ceiling is high and panelled, with light wooden beams and reminded me of a garden centre. The booth we were sitting in was nice and cosy, with a little light and cute coffee plaque on the wall. There were plenty of tables on different levels.

The menu is massive and everything sounded so yummy! After ordering a bottle of house white (we asked for medium but ended up with a very sweet Leibfraumaunch), I decided to go for the Antipasto Misto to start as I absolutely love Italian meats! At just shy of £9, it was an expensive starter, but when it arrived at the table served on what I can only describe as a slab, I could see why.
A selection of the usual meat was accompanied by a mini bowl of green and black marinated olives, parmigiana shavings, Stilton cheese, a large lump of buffalo mozzarella, sun-dried tomatoes, rocket salad, a thick slice of toasted bread with pate, pickled slices of carrot and cauliflower and a bruschetta topped with baby tomatoes! This was a starter for ONE! I was gob-smacked and had to enlist the help of my other half to finish it off. 

My main was a massive portion of piping hot Tagliatelle Asinello di Mare, smoked haddock flaked into a white wine and leek sauce. The fish was beautifully cooked, white and bursting with smoky flavours, and the white wine and leek sauce was the ideal accompaniment. It was one of the nicest mains I have had in a while, but the gargantuan starter had left me stuffed! I could not resist having the tiramisu though, and shared it with my boyfriend (although I probably had the most!). It was served in a martini glass which was a lovely touch, and was very nice, very alcoholic which wasn't a bad thing at all! It goes on my tiramisu list, not decided how highly it's ranked though!

We left absolutely stuffed to the brim, with a bill for just under £60, for two courses each, wine and a shared pud. I thought this was not bad actually! It is probably that wee bit more expensive than other Italians around, but I would say it's by far the best. Definitely worth venturing out of Glasgow city centre for!"}
{"text":"I've been to Guidi's a few times with family because it's my aunt's favourite restaurant, so anytime time it's her birthday or a special occasion, Guidi's is the place we head! 

It's a good Italian restaurant. Italian is probably my second favourite cuisine, and so I know the type of thing I'm looking for in a restaurant. Unfortunately Guidi's just isn't up to scratch with some city centre counterparts, hence only 3 stars. 

It's an incredibly spacious restaurant that I'm pretty confident does takeaway, and I've never had a bad experience here - it's just not the greatest quality food. A good dining experience can be had here, and I'd definitely recommend it to someone who wanted to stay local, but it's not one of my favourites."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for many years now, and have introduced many a grateful friend to this fantastic restaurant. The food is some of the best italian food I have ever tasted. The carbonara is a particular favourite. Portions are more than filling, and many a doggy bag makes it way out of the place. As the other reviewers say, it does get busy at times, but I have never found this effects service or enjoyment. The menu is priced like a city centre place, but it is well worth it. I would never hesitate to recommend my favourite Italian to anyone. Even if it is in Airdrie!!"}
{"text":"We love Guidi's!  Great staff, very helpful and friendly.  The crowd is a mix of families to people out on dates to office parties - always a good atmosphere.  Food is very good with a wide selection from seafood to pasta.  We make it a point of coming in whenever we are in town.  It's become a family tradition - whenever we are at Guidi's we know we are home!"}
{"text":"Guidi's was the first place my husband brought me for dinner in Scotland.  After being here for 5 weeks himself, he had weeded out the places that he liked and that offered an ample enough menu that he thought I would be able to find something l liked and that was vegetarian. 

Guidi's was decent.  I got a pesto pasta dish which was good, but nothing to write home about.  I had my first sticky toffee pudding here, and I definitely enjoyed that. 

During the course of our meal we had 2-3 waitresses serving us, which as an American, I find odd, but that seems to be how they do things here.

The experience was A-OK.  If I lived here I may come back, but probably wouldn't go out of my way for it."}
{"text":"I do like Guidis and have been plenty of times as it's our local Italian. We went here lat night for my mother in laws birthday as they hadn't been and it is good for groups and occasions. We had a table for 10 adults and two children and I felt the service was timely but others thought it a bit slow. They also forgot a starter for one of our party and it didn't arrive until we had all finished ours. They also forgot a main course for a different member of our party but that didn't take too long to come out once we made them aware. The service was attentive at times and slow at others where you couldn't get someone to get drinks. The food as always was tasty and we all left full. I will always go to Guidis as it's the best local Italian and always go with family and friends. The prices are a little high for being in Coatbridge but as mentioned above you don't mind paying for good food. I highly recommend the steaks, delicious."}
