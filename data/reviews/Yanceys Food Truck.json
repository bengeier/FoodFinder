{"text":"Fried lobster and waffle.  Just get it.  I was skeptical but it was amazing.  So delicious.  They also have gumbo, fried chicken and bbq shrimp.  Wash it down with some kool aid and banana pudding for dessert.  I caught up with them at Foodie Fest but luckily they are a local food truck so I don't have to wait to try them again."}
{"text":"Their gumbo is bomb.com I tried it at the Food Fest in front of Sunset Casino.  They serve it w/ rice. OOOOOOH OOOOH SO GOOD! It had REAL crab nothing was imitation..man the food it was so delicious. Also their Chicken and Waffles are so freaking good. It's like the waffle melts in your mouth. I will definitely be on the lookout for this truck again."}
