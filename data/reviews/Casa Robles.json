{"text":"Wow, yum !! What a great surprise . We Yelped Mexican food and this popped up. The food was fabulous I had the soft tacos and the steak was to die for. My husband had the enchiladas and raves about them. Last but not least the fried ice cream was perfect. The service was great. I guess they have only been open a short time but I believe they will last. This is a super find."}
{"text":"Amazing food ! Amazing drinks ! Amazing service ! Definitely going to recommend this restaurant as one of my top Mexican places in Las Vegas !"}
{"text":"This is an excellent traditional Mexican restaurant! I had ordered the Camarones a la Diabla and it was delicious. As well as the fried ice cream it had a cinnamon taste which I loved :)! The food was great as well as the staff they were so friendly and hilarious. I recommend this place to everyone, it's a must."}
{"text":"Is a new place, but is by far the best Mexican food in Las Vegas 
The service is great and the place look amazing the bar is well loaded, specially with tequilas  they have more then 100 different tequilas. 5 starts place"}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp and I always go based on pls previous reviews. This was a really good place, has not been open for long but would definitely come back next time I come back to Las Vegas. Want to give two thumps up to the Guava margarita they made me."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my visit here! Our waiter was really funny and continuously looked after us. He recommended a couple items on the menu... in particular the jalapeño guava margarita was AMAZING. The sopes and enchiladas were amazing as well. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"Mexican food in general In vegas is weak. This place rocks! The portions are big and they offer more chips or tortillas. I hate being charged extra for rice in most restaurants or other trivial items. The fajitas were awesome,  best I've had in vegas. The service is on par with everything In this place from food to decor. I'll be back"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Great atmosphere. Fantastic drinks. We sat at the bar which had a brand new shiny granite countertop which is a rarity in Las Vegas, soon to be torn up and replaced with video poker terminals unfortunately, but for now we get a front seat view to witness bartender Tara and her Tequila girls whip up all sorts of magical potions. Her award winning signature Guava margarita with jalapeño is unbelievably delicious and spicy. The watermelon margarita is truly a knockout refreshing drink. We then had several rounds of shots courtesy of the Tequila girls who raised the party atmosphere in this newly minted family sit down Mexican restaurant. The food is well prepared and delicious although a bit pricey but definitely worth it. Anyway, it's a great place with a great location on Flamingo and Jones. Don't miss out on it."}
{"text":"Yes, this place is great. We started off with chips and salsa. The taste of the different salsas and beans, were delicious. Honestly I could have just ate chips and salsa. I had the steak and lobster special for Father's Day. Both great. Tony had the carnitas and he was very happy with them also. All in all everything was top notch, come and check out this new restaurant."}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing chips and the best salsa!!! The green salsa wow amazing! And love our server thanks for putting up with the party! Very sweet. It is just a little off the strip but totally worth coming!"}
{"text":"Wow.. I am a Vegas native and this is the best Mexican restaurant in town. My new favorite."}
{"text":"This restaraunt is one of the very best Mexican restaurant you will find .mixed drinks off the hook"}
{"text":"Celebrated my graduation here, came a day before grand opening, not a lot of people know about this place yet. Food is delicious, good size portions and the staff is very friendly. Will be making a trip here again. Check in on Yelp to get 10% your bill"}
{"text":"This is my new FAVORITE restaurant!! The staff is so friendly and they treat you like you're VIP. On top of that the food is the best in town. Absolutely love their carne asada fries recommending to everyone I know"}
{"text":"This place is so good !!!!! The food is delicious it's mostly empty I dont think people can really see the restaurant it's a bit hidden but it's a hidden treasure. Would definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Jamaica was well balanced, carnitas tender, lunch specials are under $10, service attentive and friendly. They are expecting entertainment on the weekends. Located on Flamingo just west of Nora's. Two great restaurants close together!  Unfortunately, a bit of a drive for us but worth it!"}
{"text":"Amazing! Absolutely amazing food and staff! I was so impressed with everything you never would have know Casa Robles had just had their soft-opening just this week! Wednesday in fact! 

Service: The front of the house was tight, and attentive to our large party. They have a wonderful system in place and its works. I have been to many different restaurants in their soft opening week and they fail to overcome the challenges of opening a new restaurant. Casa Robles succeeded and I wish them nothing but SUCCESS! 

Food:  Since we were a large party  we were able to try almost all their appetizer offering. Oh my god, delicious  we had the Nachos (fully loaded and beautiful), Queso  Fundido (drool worthy), the Cerviche (tasty!!!) fresh guacamole dip (converted an anti avocado  person!!! I am not kidding!) my family had the carnitas plate, ribeye  (I know Mexican joint and steak...just shhhh and enjoy the perfection) and tacos ....ALL were amazing.  Everyone in our party that we spoke with all decleared hands down that this is our spot to eat from now on while in Vegas (my family traveled over 200 miles others traveled further to here for this party.) 

Adult beverages: strong and inventive...so just DRINK  20/10 you will order more than one they are that yummy! I highly recommend the Guava margarita with fresh jalapeños and for a bigger kick order with extra salted rim! The blueberry mezcal margarita (just drink and enjoy the ride!!!)

Overall worth the drive (for those visiting Vegas) and the authentic modern Mexican cuisine is utterly delicious! 

Seriously this is go to restaurant with an excellent future ahead! It is a mom and pop so support your local businesses (not the food chains) Congratulations again and we can't wait for another day when we are back to Las Vegas to eat some more yummy  foods."}

{"text":"First time here and the service was exceptional..  very professional and the food was delicious.. the portions are huge .. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I work in the area and have been waiting for them to open. 
Today at lunch I saw the open sign and decided to give them a try. 

After entering we were immediately greeted by the hostesses, who were very upbeat and friendly. 
The menu has a lot of options and some lunch specials. I tried the carnitas lunch special. 
The portion was huge, enough that I took home the leftovers and had dinner. 
The carnitas were a 10/10, flavorful and tender, but with a nice crisp on the outside. It came with rice, beans, and some guacamole. The flour tortillas were excellent. 

Service was excellent as well 
I look forward to my next visit."}
{"text":"The food was very flavorful and the service was outstanding. New restaurant, opened less than 1 month. Will definitely return."}
