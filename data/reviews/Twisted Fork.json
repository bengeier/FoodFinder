{"text":"I've been to the Twisted Fork several times. Each time, the food has always been delicious. The selection is very good; there's several vegetarian options. I absolutely love their grilled vegetable wrap. I really enjoy the presentation of the food...the rectangular plates add a sense of class. Their daily specials are good, especially when they have 1/2 price kids meals. My kids love the Shirley Temples. If you haven't tried the Twisted Fork yet, I would definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"Great food an excellent pricing. Great service, prompt & pleasant.
Very accommodating as our group of 5 arrived at 9:30 pm and there was no rushing to get out! BBQ ribs were as good as the best i have eaten. Appetizers much better than average. Desserts excellent. Fries fresh cut, yum. Highly recommended by all at our table. Larger wine glasses would be only improvement! Thanks for the great meal."}
{"text":"Excellent service and great food. Had the beef burger and roast beef sandwich. Portions were generous as well which is always a bonus for me!"}
{"text":"I came here Tuesday for lunch and decided to order their chicken wings since it was half price chicken wing day. I got eight wings and sweet potato fries. The fries were really good, crisp and flavourful. The wings were huge. Gigantic. Great value for money (especially on Tuesdays). However, the wings were severely lacking in seasoning. 

I'm not talking about the coating of sauce, I'm talking about the meat itself. Once I bit through the saucy exterior, the fleshy interior was just bland. So bland. I had to salt these babies. I have never in my life had to salt chicken wings in a restaurant. Usually they're salt bombs (so you'll order more beer, natch). These people need to brine these wings. Do something to get some salt into the interior. It was certainly a shame because these wings could have been topnotch. 

The service, on the other hand, was exceptional. There was one woman taking care of the entire dining room and she was doing so flawlessly. She was super friendly. Her pacing was spot on. Not a single complaint there."}
{"text":"Love the Twisted Fork. Try the eggs benny..!"}
{"text":"Awesome, almost unexpectedly fine restaurant. The appetizers are great, the bruschetta is crunchy and flavourful and the wings are large and saucy. I really enjoy their sandwiches and wraps and the homemade Caesar salad with BBQ chicken is well presented and so tasty. Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"Ive only been there for breakfast.  Food was pretty great. Service was friendly.  Decor was clean and neat."}
{"text":"Excellent Food and service. They made an eight year old and his family very happy on his birthday. 
The chicken parm, tiger shrimp linguine, spaghetti and meatballs and the belt sandwich were all stellar!
Will come again and recommend it to others."}
{"text":"Twisted Fork is hidden off of the main streets of Mount Albert. It looks a lot like a small town dinner resto, with a focus on slightly finer dining. It pulls it off well- homey, not pretentious, but still a little elegant. 

I had the Shrimp Fettucini, which is a good measure of how generous a place is with the protein. This dish came with 5 rather large, perfectly cooked shrimp. The pasta was also well done.

There are a few other menu options, including breakfasts and deserts. Worth a stop if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Food was fantastic. I love that everything is home made. My only issue is that I am in a wheelchair and noticed that there are no handicap buttons on the doors."}
{"text":"Family atmosphere, great food and big portions. Lovely place. I really recommend this place for family fun."}
{"text":"I was fortunate enough to be able to visit the Twisted Fork restaurant in Mount Albert twice this week. This is a small gem of a restaurant tucked away in a quaint little village.
Our first visit was with a group of six ladies including one child. The menu was interesting and quite varied... And they even had a children's menu that would suit any picky eater. Our group ordered everything from chicken wings to chicken quesadillas, pulled pork sandwich, cilantro lime wrap and an entrée of pan seared basa.  Pricing was a very reasonable and when our orders were delivered to the table we were all quite pleased! Even the child's breaded chicken strips were great.
My second visit was for lunch the very next day. Because the menu is so varied, it was a treat to go again.
We were encouraged to try the freshly made sweet potato soup, and we were not disappointed! It was hot and thick and creamy with a glaze accent of balsamic reduction. We followed this with the chicken quesadillas and one of their signature homemade hamburgers, including wonderful fries.
Along with their interesting varied menu they offer weekly specials every night of the week from pasta to burgers, wings, muscles, ribs and even liver and onions!
We feel fortunate to have found such a gem close to home, and we will be back. Thank you Twisted Fork!"}
