{"text":"Has a Continental menu with some Hungarian influences. The Schnitzel (Pork, Chicken or Veal) looks a little over bearing when it arrives but actually is quite light. Right amount of red cabbage & other tasty side vegetable. In summer has a small patio where one can people watch (especially those beautifully people spending the big bucks across the road in the Hazelton Hotel patio). Friendly staff and good service."}
{"text":"This place was brutal.

At 7:30 on a Friday it was deserted. We soon realized why. While the service was attentive and friendly the food was awful. They were out of cucumber despite having a cucumber salad on the menu. The Pork Tenderloin with peanut butter sauce was a disaster. It literally tasted like someone slapped some Jiff on a few cheap pork medallions. Her filet of sole, the days special, was mushy and covered in so much butter it was barely edible. By the time we were done our entrees were just wanted OUT!!

It really is a shame because this place has a nice patio and a great location. How it has managed to stay open when the place is deserted during peak hours is inexplicable. The atmosphere has the potential to be nice, with the rich wood panelling, but the bar area with the cheap boombox blaring instrumental remixes of contemporary classics was odd. 

I don't give many 1 star reviews, but I've never had such a desire to LEAVE a restaurant as soon as possible."}
{"text":"Run down, depressing, waaaaay overpriced and sub par food. I get that it's an establishment that has been there for 60 years- blah blahblah. Our table was held together by duct tape and the floor was filthy. You have to go into an adjacent mall to use the bathroom. The goulash was tiny and very watery for the price. The strudel was dry. 
Go to country style in the Annex for much better food, value and cleanliness."}
{"text":"Haven't had Hungaro-Canadian cuisine since my Detroit-Windsor days. The chicken paprikash was amazing. Included spaetzle rather than dumplings indicated on the menu, but melt-in-the-mouth delish nonetheless."}
{"text":"Tourist trap!  Tourist trap!  Beware!  I am sorry to have to admit that we actually ate here, but we were tired and hot and sweaty and the patio looked quite inviting so we plopped down and ordered some food.  We started to feel wary when we saw the outrageous prices but decided to just get the lunch sandwich specials.  I mean, it's not possible to mess up a sandwich, right?  Wrong.  The \"chicken parm\" sandwich was a fried chicken breast with mayonnaise.  That's it.  My step-dad's chicken was delivered raw to the table.  My husband cannot eat mayonnaise but for once in his life did not think he had to qualify his order since chicken parm should actually come with marinara sauce and parmesan cheese.  When we pointed out that one sandwich had raw chicken and neither was actually a chicken parm, the waiter tried to argue with us.    Five sandwiches and three beers came to $100.  I mean, seriously. 

The pictures on their website make the restaurant look sleek and modern--it's anything but.  It's rundown and oppressive inside.  The patio is indeed charming, but cannot make up for the heinous food and pathetic service.  If you're in the quaint little area of Yorkville, eat *anywhere* else."}
