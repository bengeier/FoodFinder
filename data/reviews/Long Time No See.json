{"text":"Food tasted great- though the meat was a bit chewy. Really liked their selection of grilled seafood, menu selection was great.

Has a small patio, would be nice for the summer time. Spacious seating. I've seen some comments about the place being pricey, but it's pretty average. Seafood was $10+ but the portion is fair."}
{"text":"This place was alright. Very authentic mainland Chinese, but maybe too Spicy for my family who went with me :p

We ordered lamb bbq skewers-very good, bbq beef skewers-good, grilled pork belly skewers- meh

We ordered egg fried rice, I thought the portion was very small was 10.99$ portion. It tasted good though.

Grilled eggplant was very good. Grilled clams was also very good. Grilled squid was a bit tough and dry. 

Seafood noodle was not what we expected, clear thick bean noodle in a sauce dip, would not reorder. 

Hot and sour soup was large portion but I found it needed more thickener, too thin for my liking.

Fish in chili oil was good but HUGE, we had already ordered too much :p I love the taste of the prickly ash in the broth.

The chive and egg dumpling was good. But obviously as a side dish, not an entree.

I would MAY be back again but I am more cautious to mass order on the menu. Prices were reasonable for some dishes and too expensive for the staple items in my opinion.

They take cash or wechat pay ha. The crowd was younger, I think my parents were the oldest ones there."}
{"text":"Rating - 3.5/5.0

Came here just before their grand opening to avoid potential chaos. If you have ever seen or been to grand openings with freebies it usually ends up with an onslaught of horrible reviews and angry customers. But let's see how this one plays out.

The decor is nice here and seating is very comfortable. They serve both seafood and meat skewers as well as grilled fish hot pot. You make your skewer selection on a piece of paper and out comes your skewers onto a hot plate. Be sure to choose your spice level for each item.

Lamb Skewers (3.0/5.0) - Just your typical lamb skewers. Not bad but nothing to write home about. It is not too gamey so it works well for most people.

Pork Belly (3.5/5.0) - A nice balance of meatiness and fat. Decent choice.

Cabbage (4.0/5.0) - Perfect balance of soy and spices. I opt for medium spice level for this one. Wish that it was in a skewer rather than on a plate though.

Chicken Wings (3.0/5.0) - It is supposed to be New Orleans style but I do not taste it at all. The meat inside was relatively juicy but the outer skin is on the dry side but not the crispy kind.

Chicken Cartilage (3.5/5.0) - I prefer the drier type that is pure cartilage but this one had a bit of fatty tissue and meat residual. The marinade is also on the sweeter side so I would ask for the highest spice level for this item to balance it out.

Beef Short Rib (3.5/5.0) - Meat is tender and juicy with a sweet marinade which matches well with the spices.

Service was alright. A couple times the wrong order came to our table. The place was packed by the time I was done. Worth checking out if you like Northern Chinese style BBQ or want to give it a try for the first time."}
{"text":"Fairly average food. For the same price point, Chat Bar on Silver Star was way better and tastier. The grilled scallops were disappointing. The deep fried sweet pork was silly sweet. The fact that we had leftovers is never a good indication."}
{"text":"The razor clams was what attracted me here as all the other skewer places doesn't have razor clams. Not bad, but a little sand residues inside. 

The baby sausage were not warm enough. The same applies to the bacon and inoki mushroom, not hot enough. The scallops were pretty good, sams flavour as the razor clams. I've also ordered the crab meat, and it's the long Surimi crab meat-this one is piping hot. Given it's a new restaurant, perhaps it will improve over time. They take reservations and service was friendly. I arrived here at 8:00pm and they did reserve a table for me. 

The ambiance is nice and relaxing."}
{"text":"Liked the decor and how bright the restaurant was. No wait was required :) we went on a Saturday night around 7pm. 

We ordered (please refer to pictures attached):
- Potatoes 
- Lamb skewers 
- Okra 
- Pork belly 
- Bacon 
- Spicy boiled fish 
- Bread
- Spicy cabbage (not in pics) 
- Garlic wings (not in pics)

Overall not bad! But not the best skewers around the area."}

{"text":"Decided to try this place after seeing the great photos on Instagram. Invited two out of town friends to join me on a warm June Sunday. You get a menu and order on an index card. The skewers are delivered to the table and rest on a little platform that is heated from the inside by tea light candles. 
Pro: big selection, decent price, no wait for lunch on Sunday
Cons: service was not great, very warm inside on a warm day (no A/C?), there was a little stand up card with what seemed to be specials on the table was only written in Chinese, food looked better than it tasted, meat was rather dry, I asked for one of the items on the Instagram photo and when it arrived it was missing the vegetables that was in the photo, cash & debit only (debit machine in the middle of restaurant) 
I would not go back and would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Came here during grand opening. Free massive lamb skewer. The spices were a great mix. However, I prefer their original regular size lamb skewer much more. For some strange reason, the massive lamb skewer was hard to chew.

We ordered the seafood platter and spicy mixed bowl. Also some BBQ dishes. 

This place used to be called under a different English name, but with the same owner. I just like the previous branding better, and feel the food quality is better before. Hopefully the store will get more attention with the new branding!"}
{"text":"I came here for dinner. Extremely cool place with the menu which covers all the taste buds across China..

I ended up ordering Northern Chinese Barbecue  beef and lamb skewers, egg fried rice, and grilled eggplant...

When I say I had no expectations but the food blew the F out of mind I mean it!!

The barbecue skewers took me back to Singapore, Malaysia, India, ---can we say Spicy, can we say the best tikka masala/Hakka Chinese crazy spices... delicious haven't tasted anything like this in the GTA so far...5 skewers per meat come with the order..

Now to the egg fried rice...they added chives and it took the dish to the next greasy level---I also had asked for their chilli oil, which complimented the rice really really well...Uber delicious !

Now to the grilled eggplants, with spicy gravy on top, and finished off with chilli oil ...Devine, out of the world..

Complimentary green tea is served before meals, service is super, food is authentic...Can't wait to be back!!"}
{"text":"TLDR decent skewers, slightly overpriced 

Visited with buddy on weekday night.  Yep we missed the grand opening weekend promotion where they had 25% off your food bill :( 

The skewers are generally well seasoned and most come in four per order.  I would recommend getting the chicken cartilage skewers and chicken gizzard skewers for the crunchy texture.  Lamb skewers are a classic and served with a bit of fatty meat. Absolutely scrumptious~ 

I would avoid ordering the beef heart artery skewers as the protein didn't absorb the seasoning well enough.  It came fairly bland in taste.

Overall, this place knows how to grill and season their skewers.  Pricing wise, I would say most of the meat skewers are overpriced by $1 per order.  Sure the food is good, but lacking value. 

P.s: will come back to try lunch menu soon"}
