{"text":"This is my go to place for some late night comfort food.   Or for quick meet ups.   The restaurant is spacey and you don't feel like you're in anybody else's seat.   The waitresses are super nice.   Always get your drink as soon as you sit down.   The menu has its ups and down.   The burgers are awesome.  Some of the food is freezer food so the value isn't necessarily there but the service is.  3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Perhaps one of the cheapest restaurants in Cleveland, The Big Egg has a reputation as a seedy late night spot. The lovely interior does not live up to this reputation: it's actually quite nice. It's located near 52nd street and Detroit on Cleveland's West Side.

I got the Chicken Parm dinner (pictures on my blog: http://whatsincleveland.blogspot.com/2011/03/big-egg-restaurant-west-side-of.html)  and it came with soup and ice cream for dessert. It was delicious, unassuming, and totally un-gourmet.  My friend got the salmon burger and cleaned her plate. The diet coke flowed. Refills came and came. Aretha Franklin played in the background.

Dinner came with a little cup of ice cream for dessert, which was an unexpected delight.

There were a couple of lovely families dining there on the Sunday night we went... none of the rumors of 600 lb waitresses or rowdy drunks proved to be true. The food, however, was glorious cheap diner food."}
{"text":"We went here for lunch and I ordered the veal parm . I sent it back cause it was a veal pattie that had been deep fried . No bueno . So instead I had a corned beef sandwich which wasn't bad , a little dry but better then the veal . The fries were good and so was the gravy I poured over them ."}
{"text":"Cheap and comfortable. If it's a choice of Dennys/IHOP/whatever cheap chain restaurant and The Big Egg, I'd go Big Egg all the way. Support the little people. Food is generous and cheap and pretty good."}
{"text":"The service here is pretty spotty. There seems to be a lot of turnover in the waitresses, and when the boss ain't around things seem to fall apart. They do make great hash browns, and have some good specials from time to time."}
{"text":"Great food, cheap prices, and excellent service!! The popeye skillet is so delicious! And when you stop, don't forget to try their homemade rice pudding,it's better than any other restaurant i have tried it at."}
{"text":"The My Friends of the '90s. This is a pretty cool diner, offering lots of space and a good menu. The Big Egg has a long history and it's detailed on the back of the menu. The most recent reopening was disappointing to many (it apparently wasn't as good as it had been) but I understand that it's gotten much better since then. I really, really liked what I had. I wish it were open 24/7 but not quite."}
{"text":"Have heard great reviews and terrible reviews about this place over the past few months. During our visit the servers were very attentive. Our issue was with the quarter-sized bug that my mom found cooked in between her breakfast sausage. She politely asked to have her plate taken away. After giving the bug to the server, the servers who had been rotating offering service to our table stopped. Upon leaving the manager said he would not comp their bill saying \"that bug didn't come from here\". I assure you that we DID NOT bring the bug in with us. While we found the incident itself unsettling and reason for a loss of appetite, it was the manager suggesting that my mom (or any of us) had planted the bug in order to get a free $12 meal that has ensured that we will not be back! Seriously?! The customer service from the management was surprisingly rude, insulting, and not in the least bit accountable or apologetic."}
{"text":"Oh, The Big Egg. Maybe it's because I've only been there when I'm in a hazy state, but every time I walk in it feels like I'm stepping into a David Lynch scene (the lighting is so weird!). The food is fine, but I can't help but think that I could have made something better at home whenever I get my food, and immediately regret dropping $8+ on an omelette (I just looked up one of my Big Egg bills and can't figure out how I spent $11.70 there one late night, but such is life) when I've had so many omelettes for $8 or under elsewhere that are pretty close to amazing and far less greasy. I mean, they're arguably better than Perkins or Bob Evans omelettes, which look something like plastic, but now I'm just lowering the bar for the sake of being complementary. It's not a bad place, it's just not a great place either. I'm sure I'll end up there at 2 a.m. again someday."}
{"text":"Great stop for a quick breakfast. Good food, wide selection and get you in and out quickly."}
{"text":"The Big Egg is a Cleveland institution.  However, I only discovered it a couple of weeks ago, after participating in a charity walk downtown.  It was so good, we went there the following week too.  I didn't know what I was missing.  Breakfast is my favorite meal and this is one of my new favorite places.

A few of us in our party ordered the \"Crazy Breakfast\", which consists of 2 Eggs, 2 Bacon, 2 Sausage and 2 Pancakes.  If that weren't enough, we ordered the Redskin Potatoes.  I wasn't able to order my eggs poached, which I prefer, because they don't do poached during busy weekend hours, so I ordered over-easy instead.  Everything was perfect.  The bacon was crisp but not too done, the sausage was tasty with a slightly crisp skin that kind of popped when you cut it and the pancakes were light and fluffy.  I didn't think the potatoes were actually redskins, but they were great too.  Done just right - crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. 

There are starters, salads, sandwiches and other entrees on their menu, but I never considered anything else once I saw the \"Crazy Breakfast.\"  The cost of my breakfast was only $3.99 and the potatoes were $2.49 (enough for 2 people).  The prices are more than reasonable and you almost wonder how they can stay in business.

As far as the d√©cor, it's very basic.  Just a room with tables and booths and not much on the walls, but it didn't really seem to matter.  As I mentioned, I've been there twice, once sitting at a table and once at a booth - both were comfortable.  They were very cool with us putting tables together as more and more people joined our party.  We ended up with 12 people with 6 separate checks.  The waitress didn't seem fazed by this at all, which is not the norm at other places when you have a large group.

The Big Egg is open 24 hrs., Friday & Saturday, so it's a popular after-bar hangout, yet they're just as popular with families and businessman on their way to work.  It's been at the same location for about 40 years or more, but with renovations, you wouldn't know it.   

I recommend giving it a try."}
{"text":"I'm sure that they do many things well here, but my breakfast this morning is not one of them.  I had hot cakes, eggs over easy, sausage patties on the side and coffee.  The sausage was excellent.  The eggs were fine.  The hot cakes might have been the most bland tasting that I've ever been served.  They tasted like flour, period.  The only chance to save bland pancakes is flavorful syrup.  Not to be.   The maple syrup on the tables has barely an essence of maple flavor, as if it's makers did not want to overwhelm even the most sensitive palate.  It's much closer to pure high fructose corn syrup than anything that ever came from a maple tree.  Oh, I'm sorry you're disappointed was the reaction from a server, here's your check for $11.50."}
{"text":"Decided to give The Big Egg my first visit. Not really sure how exactly seating works, as there is a cashier desk in the middle of the diner, a front entrance with no self-seating sign, and who knows if there is a back entrance or anything with it. Whatever. I walked to the desk and someone gave me a table. Was kindly offered coffee, declined, and was brought water as requested. My server came up shortly after, informed me of specials, and answered any questions I had. Nice enough I guess.

Got the Browns Country omelette with cheddar cheese, salsa and sour cream. Took a bit to come out, when it did I was kind of bummed to see how the omelette was cooked. While it looked fine and the signature way they make there omelettes, I'm just not a fan of brown, dry, loaded omelettes. Luckily the salsa softened up the egg and it was decent, so no complaints there. Loves the hashbrowns when I added the appropriate amount of salt, and the toast game was on point.  

Once my server brought me my food I seemed to be forgotten about. Didn't return to ask how my food was, and didnt take any notice to any refills I really needed. None. The dining room was filling up fast, and I was obviously forgotten while she bounces from big party tables to the next. My plates had been cleared from the table by the busser and still no server.

After a bit she FINALLY asked if I needed anything....obviously not... And I just got the check and decided it was time to give up my spot for the filling dining room. The food was ok here and I wouldn't mind returning, just hope the service is a little more attentive and on point."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, really I did.  And although the inside had the hometown diner feel - the food was not hometown diner quality.
We love to check out the homegrown restaurants and give them our support.  But my husband's breakfast was Cold.  It is hard to love a plate of eggs and bacon and pancakes that are barely lukewarm.  
I got a sandwich and it was ok - nothing horrible or special, just ok.
We tried The Big Egg - but won't go back."}
{"text":"The experience I had at The Big Egg is a bit foggy, but I CAN say that I enjoyed it and upon remembering it, it all seems to have been good!!

We came here all the way from The Beachland after a long night of beer and bluegrass. We wanted breakfast during the wee hours of the morning, and we wanted breakfast NOW. So, we hit the road and ended up here because there aren't really many 24 hour diners, or at least that we were thinking of at the moment.

Our server was clearly stressed, frazzled, and tired of serving demanding drunk people at the moment. We were nice, though, and I think we were able to brighten up her shift a little bit. The atmosphere was weird, but that could be because it was 1 or 2am and we were 1 of 2 tables. I really can't imagine what it's like during standard dinner or lunch hours, and I honestly don't know if we'll ever go during \"normal\" hours. This is definitely somewhere I'll save for drunken breakfast. 

The food. I had french toast and there was nothing wrong with it. Pretty common greasy spoon french toast AKA delicious! Other things I remember on the table: biscuits and gravy, fried chicken and gravy, eggs, coffee, and some toast. And I also remember that there were no complaints and clean plates! Woo! 

I think The Big Egg is a solid place. The end."}
{"text":"Very average breakfast fare.  Came here with my wife and another couple for a mid-morning meal before tackling yardwork.

I selected a corned beef hash meal.  The over easy eggs (per my order) were served over hard, and there were lots of potatoes in the dish without much meat.  Coffee was decent and the service was attentive.

Not sure I'll be rushing back anytime soon."}
{"text":"Diner food. Decent price. The layout could use a little work and there could be music playing or something. But hey its diner food and diners are a dying breed."}
{"text":"Working night shift can be a pain in the butt, especially when you have to either get up incredibly early (by night shifter standards) or wait until everything opens early in the morning. 

I decided to stop by right when this restaurant opens on a whim, and I am so happy I did. The restaurant was nice and quiet( and might I add I was so happy to see the news on the tv's and not sports programs) and I was seated immediately by a very kind server. 

I settled on the Mexican omelet which came with hash browns and toast. For the price, I was expecting a modest portion...I was wrong. I got so much food. And it was good as well. I wasn't too happy with the tomatoes, but I hate tomatoes in anything so I'm not going to take away points for my own mistake. I never thought chili in an omelet would taste good. It was a delight. 

When I checked out, the server doesn't seem in a rush and actually talks to you while checking you out. 

Save for accidentally keeping the tomatoes in my omelet, I plan on coming again to see what else the Big Egg has to offer."}
{"text":"This is by far the best breakfast restaurant on the West Side. Clean is more important than my waitress being overly friendly. If your review of this family establishment is based off how nice a waitress is to you, please delete your account."}
{"text":"Food is always good, always fast. Service is a little slow with taking orders, refills, bringing the check. Lee will still go back!!"}
{"text":"I ordered from here, take out, after work last week. Ehh it's ok. This may be the kinda place where the only thing they do well is fried food and simple breakfast. The fish is like those off brand fish sticks we got as kids. Gross. When you bit into it the fish wasn't like white and flaky..it was brown. Fries were fine, I tried some of my friends hash browns, ok, but you need lots of ketchup and hot sauce. No flavor or seasonings whatsoever. We shared a carrot cake. Ok, just a regular cake, not great not bad either. Ordering was quick. Service was fine."}
{"text":"Service is ok, food nothing great.  Have gone for breakfast a few times, can not stomach the coffee. Last visit will be the last.

Good prices, but careful no substitutes - a $4 breakfast will end up costing $7.  2 Breakfast Omelets ran us almost $19 without coffee.  There are much better values in town."}
{"text":"The Big Egg is a great place for a wide selection of breakfast food, as well as light lunch offerings and friendly service. The seating is self-serve and before you can sit down, a cheerful server is asking if you want coffee. I placed my order of a garden vegetable omelette and French toast which arrived in about ten minutes fresh and cooked to perfection. If you are seeking a pleasantly simple meal with modest pricing and an unpretentious atmosphere, I highly recommend The Big Egg, you will leave happy. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Come here for the big servings and friendly staff. The food is so-so. My egg sandwich didn't have much flavor and the potato pancake tasted of flour. The inside is dark and sad in the daylight. If you're hungry this is the place to go."}
{"text":"This place has had a cult following for as long as I can remember. Almost 20 years ago my Mom and I would come here after a shift at the restaurant she managed- and half the time it'd be closed by the Health Department. 

But that was a LONG time ago. The Big Egg sat empty for a long time, but after a few years someone new stepped up and bought the place. 

It's always been clean and the food is always great. We come here whenever we're on the West Side too early. The food is 5 times better than it was during its first incarnation. If we lived on that side of town we'd be there more often. 

The staff is always friendly and attentive too.

The only thing that was better about the old Big Egg is that it was open 24 hours. No longer."}
{"text":"Big Egg is  an amazing place to get quick and low-cost food. The quality of the food is average but it makes up for a very friendly and outgoing staff and a menu with big variety. I highly recommend this place especially late at night or early in the morning after a night of drinking. By the way, did I tell you it is open 24/7?"}
{"text":"Went here in middle of night, around 3 am with my boyfriend. Services was great. Employees busy & flustered but they are the only ones open at this hour & they're still friendly and attentive! and food quality is fantastic!!!! We got 4 burgers & fries to go, it took about 20 minutes to prep which was convenient for the time and quality!"}
{"text":"It's tough to hand out stars for this restaurant because the experience depends completely on your expectations.  If you're looking for a greasy spoon diner type of place that serves breakfast whenever you get your lazy butt in there, this place probably tops the list in Cleveland.  Without an ounce of portention, the waitresses, all of whom probably live within a block of W65th and Denison, grab your order, slap the food in front of you, and take care of the rest of the experience with speed and economy.

The food is....hmmm.  Good.  If you're looking for cheap, filling, reasonably tasty diner food.  You're not gonna walk out thinking, \"Man, that omelette was AMAZING.\"  You will be full and your tummy will be happy.  It wouldn't take The Big Egg much of an effort to make their food better...fresher ingredients, not out of a can, etc.  But that would come at a cost and it's a cost most patrons of this establishment wouldn't welcome.  I'd say that the taste is actually better than your Bob Evans/Denny's/IHOP food, simply because those places seem to have found a way to remove the actual flavors....the entrees LOOK good, but they don't seem to have any taste.  The food at the Big Egg has flavor, even if that flavor is a greasy grill where the pancakes, bacon, and eggs are all sharing space.  Sometimes that's exactly what you need.  At Bob Evans you're just getting bulk.

Having said that, we've only gone there for breakfast...except for one time.  Being owned by Greeks we figured they probably had a killer gyro, so one day we hit the Big Egg for lunch.  Bad idea.  Worst.gyro.ever.  Wilted lettuce, one piece of gyro meat, and the sauce was weird...something mixed together to approximate the taste of the real thing, seemed like.  Cheap?  Yes.  But dreadful.

The decor is early 80's Cleveland near west-side.  The cleanliness is probably not something you'd want to examine closely.  There's never a wait, and the service is super efficient, all the more so because everyone there seems to wait on every table...if someone walks by your table and sees your drink is down, they offer to fill it, whether they're your waitress or not.  Which is nice.

In summary, I'd say give the Big Egg a try.  Keep your expectations reasonable.  Don't go for the atmosphere.  Go because you're in the neighborhood, you're hungry and want to get through breakfast so you can get on with your day, and still have money in your pocket."}
{"text":"Came here around noon on a Saturday for brunch and sat right down. We both got eggs, potatoes, bacon, toast and coffee and the total was $12. I've had better, cheaper breakfasts but this one wasn't bad. 2 pieces of salty, crispy bacon in the order. The servers were sweet and there were lots of families there. Probably a different crowd at midnight when they're also open! I'll come back again if I'm driving on the shoreway and hungry for breakfast. Check it out if you've never been."}
{"text":"The Big Egg has fast, pleasant service and really good Mac & Cheese bites. I ordered the BLT sandwich and it was pretty average."}
{"text":"The Big Egg is a greasy-spoon diner, through and through. And you know what? I like it that way.

I don't know why I haven't taken advantage of this warm, homey comfort-zone for a big, afternoon breakfast more often. I mean, I live right up the street. Probably because there are so many other options that sort of over-shine Big Egg. But, if you're looking for a good, stick-to-your-bones meal without the pretentious snobbery of nicer brunch joints, then this is your place! 

For me, the \"Egg\" is perfect for a hungover afternoon brunch after a long weekend of cocktailing. You can literally roll out of bed with last night's makeup on, sweat pants and sunglasses and no one would care. Now that's my kind of diner! On a Saturday or Sunday morning, you'll probably see a mixture of elderly groups, families grabbing breakfast with the little ones, and a few walk-of-shamers. It's a sight to see, I promise!

Some things that are awesome about Big Egg:

1) They serve breakfast all day, every day. *Happy dance* I love me some b-fast, but I have to admit...sometimes it takes me a while to get my butt out of the house before most menus switch to strictly lunch items. Nothing is worse than getting to your favorite brunch spot and hearing that news. You'll never hear the words \"no breakfast\" at the Egg, and that's enough to make this gal's day!

2) Open 24 hours on Friday and Saturday! If you like to soak up your night out with a big, breakfast or greasy-spoon meal, you're in luck! Plop your tipsy heiny down in a booth at the Egg and order yourself some grub. Although, you don't have to be drunk or hungover to enjoy this diner! 

3) It has sort of become a \"Cleveland Institution\" over its years of operation. Most Clevelanders have had a late-night or afternoon meal at this classic joint. Yea, Big Egg has had it's troubles in the past, but it's better than ever and definitely up to standard. Just come in knowing that this is a DINER, not a high-end brunch caf√©. 

By the way, the veggie omelet with cheese is money and the rye toast is super crunchy. No soggy toast around here! Definitely ask for some hot sauce to top it all off. Mmmmm... :-D"}
{"text":"Myself and two friends ventured down Detroit instead of our normal Tremont or Clifton Diner weekend breakfast, and ended up at Big Egg. I can honestly say everything we ordered was delicious. My French toast, eggs and hash browns were all cooked perfectly. One friend got the \"Big & Nasty\" which is a biscuit topped with hash browns, egg, fried chicken, gravy and cheese. No complaints.

Our bills were all around $10 for a filling breakfast, coffee and tax. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast with great service.  My mom had a new menu item and they asked her if it needed anything else, but it was fantasric.  A little upset they didn't have cream cheese but other than that I've been really happy with my meals every time I've been here."}
{"text":"We stopped in here on out easy to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and we just loved it.  Funny thing that it is on Detroit St.  and we are from Detroit!  Great service, great food.  Thank you!"}
{"text":"First time review.  This place is a deal! The 2x4 is like $4.99 and you can guess 2 of 4 things include egg, bacon, sausage, and pancake.  I liked the hash browns my lady had, but I could taste the oil.  The oil was not on the fresh side. Pancakes were decent and the eggs were completed as ordered.  

The things I liked most were the constant refills on coffee, quick service, and that you could tell they were trying.  Plenty of cream on the table.  You know how you go to those fancy places and they drop those cute little individual creamers? They last one cup, or maybe a french press split.  None of that here! A full teapot of half and half coupled with non-stop pours.  I wonder if it is like this at 3 AM?  Safe parking in the rear is pretty sweet."}
{"text":"Had a late Saturday night!? This is the place to wake up and rid yourself of that hangover with some great breakfast food. The sausage links are thick and meaty. Eggs were made very good. They lost a couple stars by bringing out cold gravy for my biscuits and gravy but after being reheated it taste great. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"This is my second time coming to this restaurant for breakfast. They also serve lunch. Menu has many options for breakfast such as combinations with eggs, sausage and bacon, breakfast sandwiches,  a variety of omlets. Prices range per person $5-$12. Food was excellent.  I ordered scrambled eggs with cheese and onion,  sausage and bacon with side of French toast. They have excellent french toast and their maple syrup was perfect. At a lot of places I have been too the syrup is too watery but theirs is on point. 
Wait staff is very friendly. They refill drinks in a timely fashion and don't leave you waiting to ask for a drink refill. Very clean inside with air conditioning."}
{"text":"For years, I only knew of two things in Cleveland: the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and the Big Egg. My knowledge of the latter came from a menu tacked to a friend's dorm wall. I would stare at that menu, wishing that I had access to food that cheap and filling. Now, ten years later, I am finally in Cleveland. So of course I had to go to the Big Egg and see if it lived up to my college imaginings. It did! My farmer's skillet was filling and delicious, with peppers, sausage, potatoes, and a fried egg on top. It also arrived about five minutes after I ordered. The waitress kept my coffee cup filled and told me some stories about the diner's history, and didn't rush me at all. And everything was cheap. In short, exactly the diner experience I'd imagined. If we could give half stars, I'd give it three and a half, but I'll round up to four for living up to my hopes."}
{"text":"A solid greasy spoon restaurant that won't hurt your pocketbook. The service is quick and friendly. Love the hash browns!"}
{"text":"I read some of the reviews and gel for the trap!! 
I will not recommend this place. 
It took me a while to get a sit. Then it took almost 10 minutes for some to take my order. Th n 20 minutes to get my food. And I only ordered two eggs (tasteless) two bacon strip s from the dollar store seems like.  
Two tasteless pancakes 
Wow !!! I had to put a lot of hot sausage to be able to get some taste and eat them!!!
The owner was just standing behind the Register. I guess he was guarding it. With a face of an angry person. Never said hi to anyone in the restaurant. 
So my question is; if you're looking for a warm GREAT breakfast? Think twice. I would go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Nothing special here.   The server asked me \"what would the fat man like to eat\"! Referring to my size, I was super offended and should have got up and walked out but I didn't.

I wonder if I would have been  Black what he would have said?

Your typical greasy-spoon breakfast joint. You can rest assured I will never be back!"}
{"text":"Came here a few weeks back after a long night out. The staff was quick to attend to us, the food came out super quick and the food was great. Typical local breakfast diner and I really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This is by far my husband and my favorite brunch spot in Cleveland. It's affordable, delicious and quick, we go every weekend. The menu is expansive...it's several pages. The country breakfast and blueberry pancakes are my go-tos. Service is always friendly and fast. We love Big Egg!"}
{"text":"This is definitely not a place I would choose on a normal basis, just because I think a lot of other places nearby does the greasy spoon thing so much better: George's, Alvies, P.J.s, etc. BUT, my friend and I found ourselves approaching Gordon Square at lunchtime with no clear idea of where we were going, and I knew that I wanted pancakes, so... The Big Egg it was. 

I think The Big Egg did a great job at helping me overcome this crazy pancake craving I've had for months... I would definitely come back next time I feel like breakfast for lunch!"}
{"text":"Glad its open.  Good food, inexpensive, very casual.  Fast service.  Here is their web: http://www.bigegg2009.com/www.bigegg2009.com/HOME.html"}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast food. Fast, friendly, clean, and food tastes good. I had two eggs with gyro meat. I was able to use their wi-fi so this could be another location for me to do work while I'm over in this area. Miss the days when they were open late."}
{"text":"Overpriced, overcooked, cold food, dingy atmosphere. Would never return! The worst $30 on breakfast I've ever spent at 3am."}
