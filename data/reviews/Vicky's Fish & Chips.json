{"text":"Barely been here in the last three or four years (since kids), but used to be a regular (for probably 10+ years). Thai food was always really good and it did not disappoint today...even ordering mild for the kids! Crispy noodles are one of my favourites and the salad rolls are always great on a hot summer day.   I'm surprised at some of the low ratings, but I've never had the pad thai. To me, this is the equivalent of eating at a good greasy spoon--you wouldn't go there on a date, but the food is great.   (Can't comment on the fish and chips--I think it's what got me in the door, but got hooked on the Thai food.)"}
{"text":"Fish and chips and Thai food at the same restaurant: Vicky's is less fusion than collision cuisine: there's no apparent reason to specialize in these two vary different culinary genres, and they're not put together on the same plate or anything, like some kind of surf-and-turf gimmick. You can get fish and chips, or you can get Thai.  Somehow, it still works, so why fight it? I my experience, the Thai options are better than the fish and chips, but both are fine. Which you order is up to your own whim, and since there seem to be more Thai places opening up on Roncesvalles and elsewhere than chipperies, Vicky's is still a good option for the batter-fried enthusiast."}
{"text":"Their calamari is the absolute BEST. It's a must try. The squid is buttery and melts in your mouth, hands down, the best in the city. Also must try the shrimp and cream cheese egg rolls. Deeelish"}
{"text":"One of my favourites spots in the neighbourhood. Nothing fancy, but homey, perfect for take out. Nice variety of dishes, pad thai and coconut soup are standbys, but I gradually try other items on the menu and am rarely disappointed. Full flavours, great value for money."}
{"text":"In my heart, I was hoping that Vicky's Fish & Chips would be like one of those hole-in-the-walls that surprises you with excellent food much like Salad King pre-renovations. Sadly, it's just a hole-in-the-wall.  I ordered a Tom Yum soup as a starter -- it was overpoweringly sour. The broth tasted a lot like something that would come out of a jar so I don't know if it's made in-house or not. And, this is me being picky, but the mushrooms were cut into halves versus thinly sliced as they traditionally should be cut.  I had a taste of the Hot & Sour soup and that was also overpoweringly sour and much too sweet for this type of soup. Wasn't very hot either.  For a main, I got the Clear Noodles w/ Beef. Couldn't finish eating it because it was so bland... salt was the predominate flavour.  They seem to use fresh vegetables in their dishes so I don't understand why their sauces are so terrible. Staff is very nice so I guess I understand the steady trickle of people coming in for take out but I wonder if I'm missing something here..."}
{"text":"Very cheap place that does fish and chips and basic, takeout Thai food.  Their tasty pad thai is very inexpensive at $6.99, but well above average- that's what they do best. The fish and chips, also inexpensive, is good (though small takeout portions), the fries are a little bland. The Thai takeoutish food varies- curries are good, basil chicken ok, glass noodles bland. So hit and miss, usually pretty good for the price.  While this may not be the place to travel across the city for for authentic Thai food, it is a community staple, and the owners are nice people."}
{"text":"Pretty dirty on the inside - so we went to the patio. You have to walk by the garbage bins to get there. There was a small swarm of flies you had to go through.  Menu was expansive and inexpensive. I had a haddock fish n' chips (6.50). The batter was lighter than most places and the fries were like from a chip truck. It was worth the money- but I think next time we'll get take out."}
{"text":"Cheap barebones hole in the wall joint.  Homemade style.  Don't expect fancy presentation like Spring Rolls.  I ordered from the Thai side, no complaints."}
{"text":"The owner and staff are very friendly, local folks. Food is never disappoints, always delicious. I recommend the shrimp peanut noodle and the green curry."}
{"text":"Ditto what all the negative reviewers said. Everything was watery and horrible.   The pad thai is so depressing -- probably the most depressing pad thai in the city which is saying something for a city full of horrible Thai restaurants. It was just like soggy rice noodles sitting in a plate of water spiked with orange food colouring.   Also got the \"fresh Thai noodle\" which was this weird noodle soup thing in \"brown bean sauce\" and again, tasteless, watery, really unsure what I was even eating the whole time.   The whole time this other diner was like, berating his daughter for smoking crack at the next table over. This might have been a plus for entertainment but because the food was so bad, I'm going to say it was a negative."}
{"text":"Boyfriend gets spicy chicken fried rice all the time and adds siracha sauce at home i have tried things on the menu but honey chicken is my favourite, we sometimes get chicken balls and they are also good. We always get takeout and were kinda regulars, staff is very friendly and i would recommend for someone to try"}
{"text":"I just love this place! The Thai food is authentic and the flavours are balanced (no ketchup pad Thai here!). This is hands down the best Thai in the lower junction/Roncesvalles/High Park/Dundas West area, and I've tried them all.  The price point can't be beat.  And in the summer months grabbing a seat on the large quiet back patio can't be beat.  This family run business has been a staple of the neighbourhood and I sure hope they staying in this ever changing neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this place for Fish and Chips. However, very good Thai kitchen. Interior is pretty old, but this place is a destination for a fast, tasty and really affordable Thai food. On top of that, the owners are super nice, friendly and always do maximum to make the customers happy.  Definitely recommended as a lunch or pick up destination. Not a place for a date or romantic dinner."}
{"text":"VIBE: Nieghbourhood hole. TV playing sports, patrons usually sitting alone but chatting with one another.   FOOD: I tried the pad thai. It was plentiful but bad--slimy noodles sitting in a soup of watery sauce. Not only was it totally unappetizing, but it wasn't even pad thai.   Given that Vicky's is about a 1 minute walk from me, I wanted to give it another chance. Perhaps I should have expected total crud from a $6,99 deal served to me late at 9pm. Perhaps other dishes would be better!  I dont even remember what my next order was, because it was so similar to the \"pad thai\". Slimy noodles sitting in watery sauce. Except it was $9.99 and I felt very ripped off.  I hate to hate on a neighbourhood joint, so here are the positives:  -portions are large  -prices are cheap -open late -service is super fast and friendly -if you like slimy noodles sitting in watery sauce--welcome to your own personal nirvana!   Maybe try the fish and chips?"}
{"text":"Fish is excellent - nice crisp batter. Chips vary. Sometimes okay, here they can work on this to match high quality of fish."}
{"text":"This is an unusual place, it says fish and chips on the outside but it's Thai, Vietnamese fusion on the inside. More than enough seating for about 60 people but every time I walk past this place is empty. It's a bit weathered but people are friendly and service is quick.  For the price,  portions are pretty massive, and it was a struggle to finish my lunch. If the place was cleaner I would have given it 4 stars"}
{"text":"I've only ever had the fish and chips.  Others who have joined me had Thai with average feedback so I never bothered to venture to that side here.    This place was my guilty little pleasure.  Even more so when you glance at the pack rat set up and how this might reflect on the kitchen.  But I knew that going in and I knew how I was going to feel going out.  It didn't matter, I wanted my craving satisfied.  Unfortunately I was delivered a crushing blow when my meal had several cleanliness issues.  Likely coincidental, hopefully isolated but still unacceptable.    It pains me to ban a place in my hood.  So I will conclude with a semi-permanent ban and keeping the option open for a case of delirum to hit me."}
{"text":"I make this mistake often: I go to places that have been highly recommended for certain specialties and end up ordering something different (that they probably never sell). On a very hot day, I was taken to Vicky's by two long time residents of Roncesvalles for what was promised to be excellent fish and chips.   The mishmash of dated furnishings, handwritten menus on neon poster board, and framed travel photos taped to the wall with packing tape all seemed promising. After all, some of the best food in the world is served from the grungiest restaurants. While there was an unexpected and large Thai half of the menu that seemed tempting, I decided to save that for a future visit.  Instead of the fish and chips that my al fresco lunch dates ordered, I had a mixed seafood and chips. What can I say? It just sounded scrumptious at the time. In fact, the big, juicy scallops, (overly) deep fried shrimp, and (extremely heavily) breaded haddock were alright. The fries though, were far too greasy. My wonderfully creamy coleslaw was humongous and started to taste less wonderful as I became overwhelmed by it. Now I know that despite my sworn love for mayo, that I too have a limit for it."}
{"text":"With walls plastered with photos of Vicki in Thailand, I really wanted to believe that the pad thai that they are serving here is authentic.  I ordered the veggie pad thai ($7.50) and was disappointed.  It was sour and very ketchup-y.  Would it be blasphemous to say that I prefer the pad thai at Spring Rolls?    My other DCs ordered the chicken fried rice at $6.95 (which looked like a heap of white rice, dosed in soya sauce with chicken chunks on top) and the mango fish at $9.95 (stir fry of veggies and mango with a deep fried fish fillet on top).    We dined in...service was just okay.  Meal prices are cheap here but I question the quality and authenticity of the food.  I could pass on coming back."}
{"text":"It is excellent food for a good price.  The restaurant itself is like a low-end diner but I find it cozy and down to earth.  Friendly staff, quick service, but I don't like what they did to their patio - they used to have big round tables with big umbrellas, now half the tables are relocated booths from inside the restaurant, ruined the ambiance.  The patio is still a nice place to eat late evening when it's dark and isn't usually very busy."}
{"text":"Going here reminded me that I should go here more often.  I've been there before for the Thai food and had a good time, but when my dad and I had the craving for fish and chips, this was the first place I could think of near me. They were out of the Halibut, but the haddock and chips did not disappoint. We also got 'coslaw' which was a little over sauced, but worth the $1.50. Also beer was very inexpensive.  The atmosphere isn't for everyone, but if you like the kitchy divey vibe with lots of home made signs and photos of Thai royalty, this is your spot."}
{"text":"Everything's real good here. If you want fish and chips, they give good value per $$, if it's Thai food you want, it's some of the best in the city. When the patio is open is the best time for dine in, otherwise take out is the better option."}
{"text":"We had the Thai fish cakes, Chicken Pad Thai and Green Curry Shrimp, to go. The service was great, food came quickly and was delicious! The hot was spicy but still extremely flavourful! Will be back to try more dishes!! Quite possibly one of the best tasting Thai places in the city! And cheap to boot!"}
{"text":"From what my friend tells me is this place has been around a long time.  15 years ago they renovated but made the interior uglier.  Its a confusing mix of fish and chips and Thai Food.  I had the Fish and Chips to go.  They were pretty good.  This place needs some serious fresh image makeover to bring in new life and more customers.  The dining room was completely empty.  There is a fridge in the dining room.  Im told they have a nice back patio in the summer though.  Avoid the dining room and just get take out or do the patio."}
