{"text":"Very good atmosphere and nice tea?Recommend???Thank you Yang Li! Warm experience in a cold snowy night!"}
{"text":"A little pricey but doesn't it is just ok. The creamy top is hmm not so good. But the environment is pretty cool, nice chit chat place"}
{"text":"Favorite tea place on campus hands down. I've tried their bubble tea, fruit tea, and cheese floats, they are all really good! The egg waffle tastes super fresh and delicious too! And I love the seating areas upstairs, perfect place to study and chat with people! It was my second home during finals week because all the libraries were crowded.  LOVE THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"Visited Champaign to see my friend and walked into this place. I have to say the cheese float tea is so amazing as well as the signature fruit green tea. Try it you will never regret!"}
{"text":"Calling all UIUC students, locals, and other travelers! You need to visit Teamoji ASAP! Hailing from the West Coast, I've had my fair share of bubble tea. I can tell you that the bubble tea from this place tops my list! 

Their signature drinks feature the cheese float / salted cheese that's been taking the boba community by storm. The fact that I previously had top notch similar drink and that this establishment is rather new, I had my doubts

But whoa, I was proven wrong after taking the first few sips! The cheese float was more flavorsome and you can immediately tell they're using high quality REAL tea! Their golden boba were also made to perfection! Compared to the rest of the competitors, who are infamously known for using flavored powder, this joint is unsurpassable by a long shot! 

They also carry pastries, dessert, and finger foods. Their portuguese egg tarts and matcha waffles are delectable! I hope they would add more food options in the future. 

Tons of outlets, abundance of seats, decorative interior, amiable staffs, great music, and sublime cheesefloat bubble tea; what more could you ask for?"}
{"text":"Honestly the best place on campus. 

I'm always happy when I'm here, the atmosphere is amazing and makes me feel peaceful. They have a motto that's \"Life is Good, Better with Teamoji\" and I think that's true. The people who own this place have the biggest hearts and created this space for people who appreciate real tea. None of the tea is made with powders or harmful preservatives, the tea is real!! Right when you walk in, you see a bunch of light bulbs hanging from the ceiling and they just make you smile immediately. There's over 50 seats throughout the whole place and it's the perfect destination for doing homework or hanging out with friends. They recently added a bunch of food items on their menus which I'm so excited about! The bang bang chicken is amazing and so are the waffles. Everything about this store is innovative and they're always looking to improve!"}
{"text":"Is the tea good? Yes.
Is it grossly overpriced for what it is? Yes. 
Will I end up going there in the future despite that? Probably. 
Been here twice now. It's got free WiFi and plenty of seating but the menu is nothing out of the ordinary. I don't see this place being the most popular when there's places having better interiors, friendlier workers and competitive prices on the same street. But that being said I highly enjoyed my Oreo milk tea and will try other drinks the next time I go."}
{"text":"Pricey but worth it. Uji matcha with cheese float is inventive and hits the spot. Service is sometimes aloof but I think that may be their branding? cool fishes in tank and comfy seating available upstairs. I like the egg waffle too but wish their menu would do better job separating the regular Belgian style vs Taiwanese egg waffles. Their rewards program is not intuitive and could use improvement especially given the highish prices! There is still nothing like it and I am a loyal fan."}
{"text":"Great location, good tea, and great decor!

Their tea is good-4 stars. We had the Peach Oolong tea with cheese float and Jasmine Milk Tea. Their tea tasted good at first, but when it came down to half of the cup, the tea and jasmine flavor started to wear out. The cheese float I had was good but not as good as the other bubble tea in town (Latea I believe). 

However, the decor and the upstairs couch is definitely a plus. It all seemed very cozy!"}
{"text":"A chill place to get some drinks and snacks. My favorite drinks at Teamoji are the milk teas and fruit smoothies, and the bang bang chicken is pretty good. I've also heard a lot of compliments about their waffles. Teamoji has retained Mashawi Grill's (the old restaurant at this location) upstairs seating, so go upstairs to get some work done."}
{"text":"This is definitly the place to go if you are big fun of tea drinks. I wouldt knock off any star because of the price, it's totally worth it?I ordered Green Tea & Cheese Float, it was the best drink i've had so far in champaign, highly recommanded??"}
{"text":"Wow, awesome drinks here. I get the grapefruit one with quarter sweetness. You can taste the freshness of the ingredients and gulp it down in minutes. People are friendly, and there's a great study spot upstairs if you don't mind a little noise."}
{"text":"Amazing drinks and delicious food. Strongly recommend cheese float tea, bang bang chicken, and egg waffles."}
{"text":"My fav in UC area. The only one that can beat latea coz its boba is not as sweet as latea's. And B3 without sugar is my top choice!"}
{"text":"I liked Teamoji before because they have great fruit teas, but now I am having second thoughts. The tea is still good, but most teas, even with no sugar, taste like they added sugar.

One HUGE downfall of the boba tea/fruit tea places on campus is that they don't standardize how much add on they put into the drink. Today I walked into Teamoji and decided to try their pudding add on. What I get is roughly two tablespoons. I feel kinda deceived due to the difference between how much a add on charges and how much has been put into my tea. I really hope that drink places standardize the add on so I get consistent quality drinks every time."}
