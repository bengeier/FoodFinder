{"text":"If i could give it zero stars, I would.  The food was terrible! We spent $60 for nothing. Steak was tough. My 14 year old loves all things steak and always eats it, even if its not great. But he left a lot of his sick looking sirloin. He only ate what he did because he was starved, but soon realized how bad it was and felt sick. Everything was tough, dry, flavorless or disgusting.  When we complained, the manager was rude, and her exact words \"most people complain as soon as they get their steaks\". That says a lot doesn't it? She would do nothing about it, she only took our name and number and would discuss it with the manager tomorrow.  The only people there were old regulars with no taste buds or sense of what good food tastes like apparently. DO NOT EAT HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, this place is edible, reliable and kind of mediocre in some ways. The salad bar is by far the best salad bar you will find in Monroe, you can make a very tasty salad here. If you want to eat steak on a budget you are much better off going here than the Waffle House, both price & quality wise. However, if you are looking for Longhorn quality you will be disappointed. They use meat tenderizer I think and tend to overcook so order a shade rarer than you normally do. The buffet itself is tolerable. Fried chicken is actually quite outstanding - only better chicken in Monroe would be Hathaway's and that's all they do- so this says much for Quincy's fried chicken game. The vegetables are good (not spectacular but solidly good) if you like Southern style veggies doctored up out of the can. The desserts are kind of meh. Service always on point. Tea is never soured because they go through it so fast. Breakfast buffet is a very good deal though not gourmet. Solid, cheap, ok but don't come here expecting to have a transcendent experience (if you are looking for that in Monroe, go to Taqueria La Unica or Stone Table instead). It's aight."}
{"text":"Quincy's was one of my favorite places to eat as a kid and haven't seen one in awhile. While they could use some updating on their interiors, but overall the food and the service were great. The big fat yeast roll is still delicious, and they still have the great southern cooking, and my meatloaf was cooked perfectly. I was a little skeptical to stop after seeing the reviews, however it was a lot better then the rating that it has. Definitely a great place if your wanting a variety of food. Salad bar is great as well."}
{"text":"So when I decided to go to Quincy's, it was nostalgia that hit me, so I took the chance.  The restaurant is a survivor, as it is one of two the country that still exist (the other being in Florence, SC).  The building and decor suggest its last update was in late 80s/early 90s; with the usual long walk-way to get utensils and drinks before ordering either steak or buffet/salad.  The store conditions show its age, nothing is really new inside, with dark areas in the dinning area; outside wasn't anything special looking at either, with the parking lot just a patchwork that is weathering away.

I took the chance and got the buffet/salad and drink for dinner, costing $12.25.  The setup is basically two tables for salads, three tables for hot food and one table for desert.  Since I don't eat salads, I went for the soups; there I saw a live roach next to the chili pot, which quickly ran under the hot bar... okay, my desire to eat here dropped considerably at this point. 

Skipping the soups, I still gave it a go got a few items at the other hot bars and a few yeast rolls (which was Quincy's trademark back in the day).  The selection wasn't impressive, mostly fried stuff including: fried chicken, chicken nuggets, chicken livers, fried clam strips, popcorn shrimp, and some sort of meat filled sausage for meat dishes.  The veggies included greens (where I watch one guy poor liquid from his plate back into it), mashed potatoes (was okay), black eye peas (bland), corn (very buttery), hush puppies, and other side items that didn't look appealing.  The yeast rolls were okay, that was mostly what I ate, with some fried chicken (so-so) and clam strips (gummy).  The server was very friendly and always refilled my drink, providing additional plates without asking, so that was nice.  But after eating some of the food, I was pretty much done with the place and skipped desert (they had some pies, banana pudding and ice cream).  

Lesson learned today... nostalgia is great, but some things must should stay in the past.  I gave it a go but I will not be going back."}
{"text":"Old memories as a child at this place! Came today for Father's Day with my family. Food was just the same as a child. Only difference... The sanitation score was a 84.5 Yikes!"}
{"text":"Looks like it did when I took my father-in-law 20 years ago. i think the food was just as old. the chicken was dry and over cooked. The green beans were cold and yucky. even the pie was gross."}
{"text":"The manager Karen is so rude to customers and even ruder to the wait staff me my husband and my two sons were there on Saturday and sat in the back. The waitress is a good friend of my son, I've known her for over a year and I could tell she was getting upset. She is one of the best waitresses we've ever had there, but the manager repeatedly tells them how horrible they are and jumps down both of the younger girls throats about everything, where customers could hear her yelling.  I watched both of the girls they didn't do anything wrong but she repeditly jump on them over nothing. When we left I made sure to give the tip to our waitress infront of the manager and tell her how amazing of a waitress she is"}
{"text":"I use to go here a lot. NOW i think it will be a long time before i go back. The service is the worst i have every had. I ordered a steak medium rare and waited for 30 minutes for it and only got it then because the waitress saw me looking at the ticket and that is when she came to see what i had ordered then told me she would bring it out as soon as it was ready. When i got it it was stone cold. This is the same waitress i have had the past 4 times and there is always a problem like i can't get a drink that cost over 2.00 or no refill or never get a plate if you go thought the fast pay line. 

I have watched her set and talk to people and never come by the table. 

ITS TIME FOR CHANGE IN STAFF OR CHECK OUT THEIR WORK (THAT THEY DON'T DO

People come here at lunch on a lunch hour. Not wait a hour to be served"}
{"text":"Please  do not go here  there are plenty  place to get a quick bite.Nasty... Funny how we watched a vendor  sell fake Panther stuff in the parking lot.Sorry Quincy or what ever you are you need to either close or clean the place up and cook something. TRYING TO FIGURE out why the meat loaf had to colors..ouch...this place is terrible"}
{"text":"AVOID *** AVOID *** AVOID  
I have reviewed this before and apparently some employees got it negatively positioned so that Yelp tucked it out of sight. 
THIS PLACE GAVE ME FOOD POISONING SO BAD THAT SENT ME TO THE HOSPITAL. I am no troll, I LIVE in Monroe and I hate giving bad reviews but if you are considering this disease and filth factory, don't"}
{"text":"We are here 2x on our trip. The food was fresh and always full. 

The price was very cheap. Like 10$ a person for dinner and a lil less for lunch... 

A lot of food to choose from. A great salad bar. Verrrrry fresh. 

A small collection of desserts were there. Also fairly fresh. 

The selection was good. Everything from Italian, country cooking, there was meatloaf as well as seafood  (fish). 

The staff was moderately attentive."}
{"text":"I discovered the Country style buffet for lunch and have been back twice. Everything I tried had a homemade taste and did not disappoint. Recommend to anyone.  You can't find good ole fashioned food like this anymore"}
