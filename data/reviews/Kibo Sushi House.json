{"text":"Wow! Just ate a torched white fish piece of sushi and it was a flavour explosion! It came with a lunch special, now i wished I had more! I will go back tomorrow and try a few of their seared/torched items.  Ordered: Take out - Lunch Special off chalk board outside $9.95. Spicy Beef with 6 piece sushi  came with soup, salad & rice. sushi pieces, lightly brushed with a mild flavoured oil, so good:  1 torched white tuna (? or white fish) - soooo good! 1 shrimp cut differently, like a gold fish - nice touch 3 salmon Beef was good but over-shadowed by the fresh sushi."}
{"text":"On our way downtown, we decided to stop in for  lunch based on the other yelp reviews.  What a disappointment.  We arrived around 1pm, not busy until after we sat down, then it began to fill up.  The space itself was not that large, but it was comfortable.  There was only ONE waitress for all the tables ..... during lunch.  So basically running about frantic -like & even saw her helping the chef roll sushi as well.  What's going on here??.    The food: We ordered; bento box with tempura. Shrimp & veggies were alright. Rice was NOT temperature hot. Chap chae needs work on. Basic salad with vineagrette dressing, nothing special, as were the California rolls it came with. Asahi roll.  Some other roll with eel. Some salmon & butter fish sashimi. Seaweed salad & Sapporo draft.  Too make a long review short, both the partner & I agreed, whatever seafood used was not fresh! & he couldn't even identify the eel...... Ugggh. I left behind most of my roll as well as my WARM Sapporo draft which I was so looking forward to drinking, but tasted warm & fermented....... Wasted! ....... as was my $65 for this lunch Whatever! ...... \"nay\", shall NOT be returning?."}
{"text":"Friendly staffs but not so much impressed sushi.... too small portion... but I will try again"}
{"text":"Great experience at this new sushi restaurant that opened up near our place.  My wife and I ordered the love boat for two.  Excellent starters (miso, salad, edamame, tempura).  Sushi came out on a wooden board rather than the typical cheesy wooden boat and the presentation was excellent.  Sushi quality was very good for the price paid.  Definitely the best sushi spot in the neighbourhood.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Had the vegetable tempura and chicken teriyaki for takeout. The food was excellent and the staff were very polite. Reasonably priced as well. Will definitely be coming back. This is the best sushi spot in Cabbagetown by far."}
{"text":"I came here on a recent trip to Toronto, and I mus say, I'm a fan of Kibo.  It's clean, quiet, and cozy, while still having a slightly classy vibe.  The sushi itself was YUM. It was fresh, and had good portions. I got one of the combos and it came with a salad (which had a delightful citrus dressing, I think it may have been house made) and some miso (I gave the miso to a friend, since it probably had dashi in it, and I'm a vegan. He said it was good though!) The star of the meal was, of course, the sushi. My combo came with vegetable sushi and inai. I ordered it with brown rice, which made it extra-filling. It was really delicious and satisfying-- even for someone who doesn't exactly have a small appetite."}
{"text":"Surprised this place isn't busy, at first I was a bit concerned, but then, the food was great, the service it's also very good. if you like Sushi, you have to try it! I went to their two locations several times and the food was always consistent and fresh. My favourite, the veggie golden dragon and veggie Gioza. Love it!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars  Kibo is relatively new to my hood - moved in last year.  Good reliable sushi and bento boxes.  Good value on the price, too (which is important to me).  I usually get the Bento D, which gives you the option of chicken, or beef or salmon.  Plentiful portions and they have the big 500ml Japanese beers too.  Nice quiet jazz music in the background.   I like the private booths as well.  One improvement they can make is in the dessert menu ... when I visited last week all they had to offer was green tea ice cream...blachhhh.... How bout offering free orange slices (as they do at Ichiban Sushi in the Beach), or perhaps widening the ice cream to include mango or other flavours?"}
{"text":"I just moved to Cabbagetown, and I have to say this place has become a staple! Really great menu, quality sushi, and you can't beat the price for what you get. I've tried most of their sushi variety (trust me, it's impressive), tempura, hand rolls, and I've never been disappointed. It has a very nice cozy vibe with traditional decor, and the staff are so great. Especially Sam!"}
{"text":"Having been back to Kibo several times now I've downgraded my rating. It still has a nice intimate atmosphere and the staff are welcoming however the quality of sushi has been disappointing the last several times I've gone. It no longer is as fresh and the sushi comes across as sloppy. Adding to this is that they've made mistakes on our take out orders twice."}
{"text":"Service: good. The server was a bit flustered and confused, but whatever, that could have been for any number of reasons. Maybe her mother died. Anyways, she was good and provided us with what we needed.  Maki: hm. Subpar. I love maki and am making it a summer goal to eat at as many sushi joints in the downtown area as I can. So far this maki rates at below average. At the end of the day, the product is what you come for, and it just wasn't great. My search continues!!"}
{"text":"ambience: 9/10  - great decor, each little table was sectioned off away from the others and v private - quiet, not too busy - overall a great place to eat on your own or on a date or with a small group  food: 9/10  - got the maki b set and the sashimi b set. both were quite good, especially the maki set which had some really excellent spicy salmon, but almost all the sashimi came out still with the tinges of having been frozen - no complaints about the salad, which had a dressing that was less sweet than most japanese places make it  price: 7/10 - for the amount of food my sister and i got and the prices we paid, we could have just as easily gone to fushimi or another $$~$$$ range ayce place and probably been offered a little more in terms of variety. basically, this place isn't really the place to go to if you're looking for great, authentic sushi at a bargain price.  service: 6/10 - the servers were nice enough in the beginning, and i typically don't care if the servers are authentically japanese or whatever, but at one point there was just a lot of korean being hollered from downstairs to upstairs and it knocked a point off the ambience, which had been awesome till then - they cleared away my plate literally after i put the last piece of sushi in my mouth. my mouth was full and they were whisking all my things away, which i found hella rude. attentive service is nice, and i appreciated that they came regularly to refill water, but i didn't need to feel like i was being watched - overall i'd say we got rushed out of there faster than anywhere else i've been in a very long time. it was clear the staff was ready to go home, having just had dinner themselves at the tables at the side, but for somewhere that closes at 10:30pm they were bent on getting us out of there way before 9:45pm.  the food was great, and the decor was great, and if i had a date somewhere in the area i might go back. i wouldn't go out of my way to head out to parliament again just to visit this place, though, and i probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless they found themselves in the area and didn't mind paying ~$30/person for good (not great) food."}
{"text":"Would have given it a ZERO if I could. Ordered online. Food never showed up. Had to argue with the owner (did not want to take responsibility for the order) to get some credit. Finally got the credit, picked up what would have been $50 worth of sushi ended up with 6 pieces of Sashimi and 2 rolls. Not even good ones. Long story short, don't waste your time with this place. It's a JOKE!"}
{"text":"Since moving to the neighbourhood, this is our go-to place for sushi delivery! The quality of the sushi has been consistently good and always well put together (and not overstuffed with rice, like some places). We also like that they offer takoyaki (octopus) as an appetizer, which isn't offered in many places. It is delicious! Staff are always friendly when we go in for lunch or when they come to our door for delivery."}
{"text":"The staff are friendly and eager to serve, with speed.  It doesn't matter if your eating in or taking out, they aim to make you comfortable with a tea and snack, well your meal prepared before your eyes, if you care to watch.    Having had three consistently well made meals since its opening on Queen east.  I'm excited for a summer of fresh & healthy meals locally made!"}
{"text":"We tried this place after finding out that our regular sushi joint seems to have closed down (District Sushi).  I liked the cozy atmosphere. Despite the limited seating, we got a table right away at 7pm. I had the steamed shrimp gyoza and the Black dragon roll. The gyoza were nice, and came with a nice dipping sauce...it was a bit different than you usually get. There was more flavour in it, and some fresh ginger I believe. The special rolls are all served nicely on ling wooden boards. Very nice presentation. The roll itself wasn't rolled very tightly though, so it fell apart as you picked each piece up. It tastes good though. Perhaps chef was just having an off rolling night.  My husband has the mixed sushi dinner. It was also very good and had some interesting tasting pieces of fish: 2 of them had a wonderfully smoky BBQ flavour. I wished I would have asked what those were!  The service was ok, except for 1 incident: as the waitress was clearing our appetizers, she spilled the gyoza sauce all over my husbands bag, which unfortunately is fabric, so the sauce soaked in and stained it. She apologized many times, and tried to wipe it off as best she could. I realize it was a mistake, and we weren't that upset (although the bag will need to be Dry cleaned).  I was expecting that because of this, that they might comp one of our appetizers or something, but when the bill came I saw that they hadn't. So I asked for them to do so, and without any fuss the waitress comped on of our drinks.  We will be going back to this place, as the food was quite good and the prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"This is a delightful and cozy sushi spot that is a welcomed addition to Cabbagetown. The prices are fair and the portions are decent.  This place a great spot for a sushi date with your significant other or a small group of friends.  The service was friendly and I would definitely add this to my repertoire of sushi restaurants in Toronto."}
{"text":"The best sushi we've had in Toronto, hands down! Great service too.  ***Edit*** I am removing one star from this restaurant after a menu revision which removed the entree platters. They were good value and variety..."}
{"text":"A simple review for a simple cuisine: this is a fabulous sushi place. The fish is fresh and tasty and the presentation is spectacular - some of the best I've seen, and I eat sushi frequently. I cannot comment on the hot food as I have never ordered any."}
{"text":"Up there with the best sushi I've had.  This place didn't look like much from the outside, so the private, cosy seating booths were such a lovely surprise. The server was SO sweet and very attentive.  I had the spicy maki trio combo of salmon, tuna and California maki and was thoroughly stuffed afterwards. Out of all the sushi I've ever tried, Kibo Sushi House wins when it comes to actually being able to taste the fish! The portion size and freshness of the various fish really stood out in the maki. I know enough about sushi now to be able to say that some places skimp so much on the fish part that you're left eating various rolls not even knowing what particular fish you're eating at any given time, as the other ingredients can overpower the fish portion so much. Not here. They really care about what they're doing.   The amount of choice on the menu was huge and the prices were very fair considering the good quality of the food. As with most good sushi places, there were good deals and combos to be had; my spicy maki trio combo came with the three maki as well as miso soup and a side salad. Pop was just 1.75.  We ended up staying over two hours as those booths are just so relaxing and cosy! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Friendly service and very quick. Fair prices and large portions. Tender and fresh sushi. Some of the best I've had in recent memory. Great ambiance as well as the booths are cozy and private as mentioned here previously. They too it off with a fresh orange for dessert too.   Short and sweet: you won't regret eating here!"}
{"text":"We tried Kibo Sushi as an alternative to Sushi Marche which has closed recently. Kibo was a beyond pleasant surprise. Excellent food. Impeccable service. Extremely friendly staff. Very clean. Nice ambiance - there were fresh flowers throughout the restaurant. You can tell they use high quality ingredients. The owner even made my boyfriend and I a drink on the house because she was experimenting with a new Summer drink menu. The ownership team clearly takes great pride in their business and treats customers like gold. Easy to see why they have grown to 4 locations throughout Toronto in the past 3 years. We will definitely be going back and we will choose Kibo before going to SM in the future."}
{"text":"Enjoyed my dinner here a lot.  The sushi combo was really great deal, yummy and tasted very fresh..  At the price you would expect something lower quality but everything about this restaurant operates at a higher than expected scale - from the food to the service to the presentation.  I just moved to this neighborhood and will definitely be back here often!"}
{"text":"A welcome addition to Leslieville. Great spot for a reasonably priced dinner when the wife and I have a craving for Japanese food. Will give the neighbouring sushi place a run for its money. Count me as a future regular customer!"}
{"text":"I eat sushi weekly mostly in the Annex neighbourhood near home. But I have to say that I will travel the 15 minute streetcar ride to this cute Cabbagetown local for my sushi fix from now on!  Fresher fish than 99% of the sushi that is out there! (Nami, how do you charge so much for so little?). Cute atmosphere and incredible service. And all for really reasonable prices... This place should be packed every night!   All of us were so impressed! 5-stars."}
{"text":"Ugh, I'm eating it now and just had to.   Kibo is wonderful. I have lived in the east for over five years and have been missing quality sushi since sushi marche went downhill (plus it is outrageously expensive). Yes, we tried all of those spots on Danforth, and they all kind of suck. We even went to that place on Gerrard a couple of times, which is nice but not amazing.  Kibo is great. They have good specials ($10 dinners) and the quality is really good for sushi in this price-range. Good, fresh, room temperature rice, fresh fish, Nice rice to seafood ratio and not greasy tempura. The seaweed salad I am currently gorging on is a hefty portion. Friendly staff and comfortable eating area. Plus they give you tea if for some reason you have to wait."}
{"text":"We love this place, it's quiet and cute (perfect for date night), the service is good and the sushi is sooooo satisfying! Masterful presentation with flavor, I hate to choose between kaarage and 2 10-piece sushi place or 2-3 10-piece sushi plates. You can't lose really until youre full.  We also love the tea!"}
{"text":"Never again, went here for a casual dinner on a Monday and met with a really rude waitress who barely speaks english.  She couldn't differentiate between dine-in and dynamite.    Tried to be nice and asked about the specials they had posted outside on their board and met with a rude attitude stating she didn't know what the specials are and didn't bother to check.  Ended up ordering something different and after waiting 40 minutes none of the food came.  Got up and left at that point.    Pretty disappointing and this is my second time going there in two weeks and previous visit had a waiter who could barely understand english.    Average sushi plus rude waitress equals to me taking my business to the dozens of other sushi places in the area.  Takes two seconds with google maps."}
{"text":"We get the take out from here. The love boats are an excellent value in our opinion.  The wait is a little long if you call during meal times. The fish is fresh and we'll presented. Credit card payment is available with delivery."}
{"text":"Great food. Excellent service.  It's a small place, but well worth the trek to Kibo.  This is our go to Japanese restaurant."}
{"text":"I would consider myself a \"sushi snob\"-- so when I saw KIBO sushi house  on old orchard grove  I was hesitant to try- especially since most of the other sushi selection around the area (avenue rd and Lawrence) is not that great.   I saw the reviews for the other KIBO locations and was convinced to try- and I am happy I did!    we ordered the sushi boat for 2 which for 40$ is a great deal with lots of food. the miso was better than your traditional miso soup as was the salad- both had great ingredients that elevate this typically \"take one bite them stop eating\" starter.   the sushi and sashimi  in the boat was fresh and there was a great selection - again different choices that you don't always get in this area and for the price point. for example: scallops, unagi, bc tuna, hamachi etc. The rice around the maki rolls were a good ratio- such that you didn't feel like you were eating a ball of warm rice.   this is my new go to!"}
{"text":"I've since eaten here a few more times and it's always consistently good.   I was in a rush once and called ahead to let them know what time I would get there so I wouldn't have to wait for my order. I arrived and my sushi was perfectly set out on a table waiting for me. Once I sat down they brought me soup and tea and everything was perfect.   Overall great sushi spot in Cabbagetown."}
{"text":"Great staff, and delicious sushi. This is our favourite sushi place! We just moved to Toronto and there is literally sushi on every corner, this place has remained our favourite though. Spicy crunch dynamite! So good!"}
{"text":"For having an impromptu sushi lunch during a Saturday work day (womp womp), I am tremendously pleased. The restaurant itself is quite small and intimate, which I didn't mind as I was surprisingly the only customer there.  I ordered the sushi and sashimi combo, and substituted my california roll for a spicy salmon roll instead. The minute I tasted the sashimi, I knew I'd be a fan - their food is the freshest I've had in a very long time. Even their salad dressing tasted delicious and perfectly citrusy. The presentation of my plate was beautifully arranged as well, which is always a bonus.   My server (who may have also been the chef) was kind and prompt.  I'm making Kibo my go-to sushi place whenever I'm in the city and need a fix. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I usually go to Sushi Mugen since its across the street from my work but, it opens late on Sunday's so I gave this place a shot. And I'm so glad I did! I got the sushi lover lunch combo. It was fantastic! The spicy salmon rolls are soooo good, the sashimi was very fresh. Didn't love the salad dressing, it seemed like a watermelon vinigrette instead of a ginger type dressing. But that's just my tastes. The prices were very good and the service was spot on (not use to that from a sushi place)! Great little place to grab a sushi lunch."}
{"text":"Great service and a really nice private booth. Great sushi. Will come again! So glad we found this place. A hidden gem in the city!"}
{"text":"My husband and I used to come to this restaurant often and enjoyed it. However, the last 3 times, the quality has been substandard and we both were left with upset stomaches. The last time we didn't even eat it. I called the restaurant and they blamed it on the delivery person, I don't know how that is possible since the food arrived 40 min after ordering. I believe the only reason this place is still open is because there isn't any other options in the area. If they were located in the Annex they would be out of business. Needless to say we will never order from there again.."}
{"text":"bo likes to hire cute gay boys to run the food sometimes, which makes it a fun place to go.   the food is exceptional too. being about a block away from here, it's my go-to place for sushi. incredibly fresh and authentic. fish still tastes like the ocean, which isn't something you can say for most sushi places in toronto. a sane amount of rice in each roll so as to not over-stuff you. not slapped together sloppily like the bloor st sushi places.  my favourite: the hamachi negi roll."}
{"text":"One of my most beloved Japanese restaurants in Toronto.  This place is so damn cozy. It's small, but there's individual booths that are comfortable and the place just feels like home.   The staff here are so nice and welcoming, I always feel like I'm going to a a close relative's place for dinner whenever I come here. That's something that's kind of hard to find in this city.  On top of that, the food is so so SO good and well presented. The cooked food is amazing. I always get the beef bulgogi bento with tempera, which is lightly breaded. I don't eat raw fish, but my boyfriend claims it's great.   Sadly, I moved far away so I don't come as regularly anymore but it always holds a special place in my heart."}
{"text":"This place was great before it was bought and/or renamed. Previously they made good and affordable sushi. I think the prices are the same, but quality is not. Rolls fall apart, rice isn't as good, and they skimp on the fish. Sad because it was my go to take out spot in the neighborhood. Not anymore."}
{"text":"New favourite local sushi place. First rate fish, very friendly and accommodating, and we'll be going back frequently."}
{"text":"Came by because their sign stopped me because of their dynamite special. It's presented beautifully and tempura crunch is delicious! The special also comes with 3 salmon sushi which is enough to fill a person. The service was nice and you get 10%off when you pay in cash. will come back soon. It usually gets busy in the evenings."}
{"text":"Japanese-owned, excellent food, reasonable price, relaxing music, good atmosphere.  I go to this restaurant at least once a week."}
{"text":"Super nice sushi place in Toronto. really fresh sushi and good customer service! Thank you so much KIBO's chef. I recommend Salmon lover"}
{"text":"Fantastic sushi! So much better than the sushi place previously in this location. And it tastes so fresh! Quality ingredients and lots of care taken in the prep.  Very good!  Tiny place. Take it out or have it delivered."}
{"text":"Zakkushi was closed because all their workers were at Yonge and Dundas Square for Matsuri, the Japan Festival.  The wait for Kingyo was going to be over an hour so we decided to give this little place a try.  What a nice surprise! The four of us ordered one love boat for two, and two combos, one with Sapporo and one with Sake.  We ate as if it was all you can eat!  Since we ordered the way we did and shared everything, we got to try: soup, salad, edamame, various rolls, sushi, aburi sushi, sashimi, tempura, and chicken karaage.  The servings were very generous and for the price, definitely great value.   Kibo was a nice find.  Where can you get a filling combo with a choice of beer or sake for 18 bucks?"}
{"text":"The roll was great but the sushi was paper thin.  Fish was good but as I said really thin and the rice wasn't great, too much and the grains seemed too hard.  I'll qualify this by saying I ordered the combo and seemed too cheap based on what was included.  Now I see why.  I'll try the ala carte menu but was less than impressed with the first visit."}
{"text":"Very small place near our area. We never had an opportunity to stop by until yesterday. Actually, we didn't even realize it was takeout only, until we got there.   We decided to order the Sushi Boat for 3 people that comes with 50 pcs. of Sushi, Sashimi and Maki along with Miso soup, edamame, karaage, salad and tempura. We also ordered a Katsu Don. The prices are fair. The 10% off for paying cash helps if you are making a large order.   The Sashimi were fresh, there was a good ratio of rice and fish to the sushi and maki and the add-ons were great. I especially loved the miso soup. The Katsu Don was good and flavourful. I was disappointed that there was no Uni. As other reviewers indicated, it comes with a cute soy sauce container.   Recommended and will definitely order from them again."}
{"text":"I live nearby so had to order sushi here few times. I have been hoping my next order would be better quality, but looks like they just keep making the same thing...  The seaweed is so chewy, like rubber.   The spicy they use tastes very unnatural, my stomach always gets hurt every time after having their spicy salmon/tuna.  Now I finally encouraged myself to say bye to this place, and decided to post this review."}
{"text":"First time at this restaurant and I would definitely return again, and again. The presentation of the sushi was beautifully arranged on the plate and the taste just perfect. No complaints about the service. Very personable staff. Moderately priced, too. I would recommend this sushi house to sushi-lovers. Bonus: 10% off the bill if paying by cash."}
{"text":"I noticed there are more of this restaurant opened in other parts of Toronto...I hope they enjoy the food as much as I enjoy coming here because the food is so fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"My god !  I have to say that food tastes reallyyyy fresh and good. Btw the lady served us is nice too. Me and my friend were very satisfied. We are sure to come back here for eating."}
{"text":"Very good quality traditional sushi.  The staff is very friendly.  We order from them pretty regularly and the quality is consistent."}
{"text":"Disappointment, below average Customer service alright I had low confidence in their food, didn't trust much on the menu, didn't find this to be good value would not return again"}
{"text":"Uber Eats to the rescue once again.  I was craving sushi and there were so many options on UE. Most seemed like in the pricey range. Kibo actually offered the best deal for a 30 plus sushi platter. I ordered and wrote extra wasabi and garlic. I got a lot- super generous. They also came inrecord time and the sushi was delicious. I really am shocked at the value of the food for the price. It was a steal  I am definitely going to be ordering this again. Sushi at home is my new thing thanks to Kibo!"}
{"text":"I'm giving it two stars for convenience (down the street) and customer service. First off, I just want to point out that I'm Asian. Not to be racist but I know a thing or two about raw fish and rice.   I didn't find this place that great, you could definitely find better price and taste wise. I got the sashimi boat for two and that was great. The soft shell crab and that was not worth it for the price of 9.95. You get itty-bitty pieces that are quite greasy. The soup we got free, it was okay.  In terms of rolls, we got the Philadelphia roll, it was horrible. The salmon were very thin and super super salty. I couldn't eat more than two pieces. I don't know why green onions were added on top either. The black dragon roll was okay, they placed it on top of spicy sauce which ruined the sweetness of the eel. The eel pieces on top was very tiny as well. The vegetarian rolls I had (yam, and cucumbers) were bad. The rolls were ice cold!.  I've came here twice. Only because it's down the street and I got tired of Rock Lobster. If your are driving, good luck with parking.  OVERALL:  Price: it's okay. Quality and taste: stick to sashimi"}
{"text":"favorite sushi in leslieville! Fresh and good quality ingredients. Great service as well!"}
{"text":"perfect for a quick dinner and/or lunch. ps, $5 takeout sushi boxes!"}
{"text":"Order Uber Eats from here all the time and it has always been very fast and delicious! It is our favorite sushi place to order from. I often get the Salmon Lover combo when it's just me, and their Maki Party Tray if I'm entertaining.  The salmon is consistently tastes fresh and buttery."}
{"text":"They have great menus! I usually order to-go maki combo for myself at Kibo. One time, I ordered party tray for my house party in last minute but they made it so quick and my guests loved it! Thank you :)"}
{"text":"I love the staff here. Everyone is always smiling and happy to see you.   I really love the black dragon roll here and order it almost every week since I moved into the neighbourhood. The shrimp tempura is decent..miso soup mehhh....and the chicken teriyaki for me was pretty yucky.  Im a creature of habit and order things which works for me, and the dragon roll or unagi don works for me. My boyfriend had the salmon sashimi and said that it was pretty good but not the best he's had. But for the price its pretty darn amazing. This sushi place is still better than some of the other sushi places we tried around here..and I love how its so close by and convenient.   I definitely need to order more things on the menu to discover whether i like it or not..but Kibo sushi is my main place to go when Im craving some rolls!!"}
{"text":"I was working nearby and decided to pop in for a quick lunch. I'm so glad I did. It was fairly quiet, being a Tuesday afternoon. I was seated at a booth. I ordered the salmon avocado roll and some salmon sashimi. This place does not seem to have any deals on their menu. There was a board outside the shop with some deals I believe only valid if you pay by cash? But I didn't take the time to read them outside and they were not advertised inside. They could just be for pick up/take out only as well?  My food came right away. It was presented so nicely, something I really was not expecting at all! The service was fast and friendly. The fish was yummy and fresh. I'm not in this area at all, but if I were, I would frequent this place often!"}
{"text":"I've tried this place twice, the first time I called to place an order, and when I arrived there was no record of the order.  So I waited 30 mins to get a new one.   The second time I tried this place I made an order via phone, and went to pick it up. Again when I arrived, they had no record of the order.  Oddly enough, the restaurant forgot to hang up the phone on their end, and I left my line open.  So, when they tried to make me look foolish for showing up unanounced looking for a \"fictitious\" order, I simply asked them to pick up their phone, illustrating the open line to me... Slightly embarrassed, they offered me a free green tea!  Wow, talk about 5 star, rolling out the red carpet service!"}
{"text":"I've been to Kibo several times now and every time I'm almost shocked by how great it is. The staff is genuinely happy and very nice to talk to, and are more than helpful.  For the price the food is great, really delicious and the sushi comes in presentations that obviously had effort and thought put into them.  Sometimes they have even given us entire extra entrees on the house. Yesterday an entire bowl of udon just as extra.   Definitely my number one go-to spot in the neighborhood now!"}
{"text":"Whenever someone mentions Kibo to me, it's physically difficult not to respond with an exacerbated sigh.  It wasn't always like this.  When they initially opened in 2012, with a lovely wait staff and above average food, it was a consistent 4 star experience.  I would frequent this place after work, and have pleasant chit chat with the manager.  However, as the months went on, I saw the steady decline in service and the food (portions became noticeably smaller yet appreciated in value?)  Now in 2014, their $5 dollar lunch specials are the portion size that could rival some of the more upscale sushi restaurants closer to the core.  I would much rather use that $5 to drive up to Taro's and have high grade sushi at a similar price.  But their menu has always been a hot mess.  Their menu is a dead giveaway that it is not Japanese owned; Sui Mais / Ha Gow (Chinese dim sum dish.), bimbibap (Korean), the misspelt \"karage\", I could go on.  Kibo, I've given you so many chances, but it's about time I officially called it quits.  ***2 stars because the decor is gorgeous, and it smells like tempura every time I walk by.***"}
{"text":"Always looking for local go-to eateries. This has definitely been added to the list.   I ordered online on a Tuesday evening- it told me it would be ready in just under an hour, but when I called them to ask for the order to be rushed, they had it ready in just about half hour.   I am picky with sushi but here, everything is very fresh, well-portioned, not an excessive amount of rice in their sushi like other not-so-great places. Affordable prices also! That counts."}
{"text":"Got delivery and it's by far the best sushi delivery I've gotten. Everything tasted so fresh and delicious!!! Def my fav sushi delivery in the city"}
{"text":"Please note the rating is actually a 3.5 because I'm in between A-OK and Yay! I'm a fan based off Yelp's rating scale but there are certain factors that have me leaning closer to a 4 star rating.  After checking out Yelp's new business openings and seeing a new sushi restaurant opened in the Leslieville area with great reviews, I had to check the place out to see if it warranted the great reviews.  Upon entering we were quickly seated in a booth, the place is quaint, cozy and the decor is new with a lot of dark colours.  We ordered a spicy sashimi salad ($7.95), tuna tataki ($9.95), sakura dragon rolls ($11.95) and one of their daily specials which consisted of 6 spicy tuna rolls and 6 spicy salmon rolls ($10.95).  Spicy sashimi salad ($7.95): The salad was fresh and the sashimi was fresh and nicely cut and the quality wasn't bad for the price your paying.  Tuna tataki ($9.95): The tuna tataki was fresh, nicely seasoned and had a great flavour but for some odd reason was cut into small square pieces.  Sakura dragon rolls ($11.95): One of their signature rolls, it consisted of tempura, crab and avocado inside with salmon on the outside that was torched. The rolls were fresh and very good.  Spicy salmon and spicy tuna rolls ($10.95): The combination was one of their daily specials, the maki rolls were okay. Not bad but nothing exceptional at the same time.  The servers are very friendly and pretty efficient and overall I would say that you get pretty good value for the price your paying at Kibo Sushi House. It's definitely a great addition to the Leslieville area."}
{"text":"this review is purely based on takeout, as I've never sat in.  That said, I've always had amazing friendly service, and fresh delicious food.   I go quite often, and the girls at the front are really nice,they remember my name and what i order every time. I always get a smile and hello from the gents in the kitchen too.  They're fast, never had to wait too long for my food. I recommend calling ahead on busy weekend nights, as they do get a # of takeout orders.   well-priced fresh sushi. definitely my go-to sushi place in leslieville"}
{"text":"Great place I love this place so much. The food is very fresh and some of the best sushi that I've had in Toronto. Usually I get the vegetable Maki but sometimes the salmon teriyaki and miso soup. It just depends what I'm in the mood for but there's so much on the menu I could try something different each time and probably be just as happy with anything they offer. Plus they have the nicest staff to top it all off. Trust me it's the best sushi place in this area of town and one of the top ones in Toronto."}
{"text":"Where: Cabbage Town Ambiance: Casual Price: $$ Food: We ordered the Sushi Love Boat for 4 people.  This included salad, soup (not miso, more of a broth-y style soup) and an assortment of fried appetizers.  This included deep fried chicken gyoza, tempura (shrimp, eggplant, king oyster mushroom) and what I believe is deep fried karaage with dipping sauce.  Following that was an assortment of Maki, Sushi and Sashimi.    Impressions of the food: there were too many deep fried offerings, including deep fried maki rolls.  The actual rolls themselves were not bad but nothing really stood out either.   On the plus side, after we finished, the really pleasant server offered us free cocktails!  Bottom Line: friendly service, lots of (average) food, good prices."}
{"text":"Nice looking place. A brand new restaurant on Queen St would be nice looking, though.  Staff is great.  Food is good. Servings are okay. Rolls aren't tiny. Quality of ingredients seems to be above average.  For me, the prices are bad. I can understand that a new restaurant on Queen St might have lower margins for making profit (higher rent, debt due to being a new business), especially if they want to serve food that's higher quality, but I know of sushi joints that better suit me and are much closer to me--I don't need to pay high prices for good sushi.  The rolls are a good size for their price, and they are densely packed, but overall they were basic (they have 8+ versions of dynamite roll, a few other options), and some of them were a bit dry/chewy (one of the dynamite rolls). Their most basic rolls are quite nice, though, especially the spicy scallop--the prices on those \"basic\" rolls are a good fit.  We also tried the chicken katsudon. While the dish was very good, I also consider it to be overpriced. The flavour reminded me of the tempura don at Double Sushi. Kibo's katsudon was very tasty and it was sauced just right; no rice remained at the end of the meal. If you are going to eat here, you should be adding this dish to your meal.  tl;dr: while this place makes some very good dishes, and some of the rolls are quite nice (especially their basic rolls), I'd still go to my preferred restaurants. Kibo doesn't offer me anything to get me to go out of my way to continue visiting, but my chance visit gave me a good meal, even if I didn't like the prices."}
{"text":"This review reflects their customer service. I ordered sushi for delivery and it took over TWO hours to be delivered. Simply disgusting customer service. If you're very busy, then simply tell the customer, don't say it will take an hour and then it will take even (significantly) longer."}
{"text":"I ordered online through their website. Their website gives the option for pick-up or delivery. I chose delivery and placed an order. When I received the order confirmation email, it says it'll be ready for pick-up by 7:15pm even if i set it up for delivery. So I called the restaurant. The lady I spoke to just told me that they don't do delivery. I mentioned that their website offers the option and what she said was that they \"can't take that option out\" of the website. That's the stupidest excuse. She said I didn't have an option but to pick it up. I cancelled the order and will NEVER order or visit this place ever again. I will ensure to advertise to everyone I know about this experience in hopes that no one else will have to go through the waste of time that I did."}
{"text":"We have ordered takeout here before they renovated. So after the renovation we decided to try them but dine in this time.  We came here for a family dinner and we ordered the set meal for 4 people. It comes with a sushi boat that has sashimi + sushi rolls. This set meal also comes with soup, salad, tempura, beans and other appetizers.  The rolls were delicious and huge! We were stuffed afterwards!  We all enjoyed all of the food here and the service was good. We will definitely be back, the prices and quantity was very good.  They also have a small fridge in the front for prepackaged sushi/sets for those who want to do quick takeout."}
{"text":"***This is based solely on takeout never been inside this restaurant***  When my hubby and I has this a week ago and ordered. The price was reasonable and the driver himself was dressed professionally with aprons on (that was cute) We had the love boat which was delicious but my husband and I found fish bones in our spicy salmon sushi.  For the 2nd attempt, we decided to order again from them despite the mishap. We ordered sushi rolls (I can't remember what we order that's how good it was)! Same driver again came with the cute apron on.  I won't hesitate to order from them again."}
{"text":"I was one of the first customers here to eat when they first opened this location.  It had a brand new smell to the store and by the second time I came here it wasn't as bad anymore.  Service is excellent and he notices all the little details like when you are running low on tea.  Food is fresh considering it's pretty new location.  It's not busy every time I come here but then again it's still new.   I ordered the sushi sets and they are quite filling and delicious.  I will keep coming here as long as I am in the area looking for good priced japanese food."}
{"text":"Sushi is pretty good its just inconsistent though. Sometimes it is really good and other times its just ok i guess it depends on who is making it. But generally pretty good."}
{"text":"It doesn't just taste good, it looks good, too. Quality with presentation and care. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"Awesome Leslieville sushi joint.  Good sized rolls, nicely rolled and fresh fish.  Would eat again."}
{"text":"I had to give 1 star but they deserve 0 stars. Don't order from here. They don't take allergies serious. My husband and I ordered take out from here through Uber eats. My husband has serious allergies and I am always careful with what I order. They mixed up our order with someone else's, put the wrong Uber number on the wrong packages. So we were surprised and upset when we got the wrong food. When I called the restaurant they were unhelpful and unapologetic. They told us it was not there fault and to contact Uber. I am disgusted by how they acted."}
{"text":"Great local sushi spot - staff is super nice and everything was good and fresh"}
{"text":"Thanks Owner Bo at Kibo for introducing us to a few of the Chef Specials!  It was an  outstanding way to sample a variety of creatively prepared sashimi & sushi.  The other dishes we ordered off the menu were equally tasty and we recommend the edamame, karaage, spicy tuna cone and the Dragon Rolls.   Mark, our server, was attentive & polite and the overall service we received from everyone at the restaurant was amazing!  We don't live in Toronto but if we did, this would be one of our favourites for Japanese food!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple of times and it's pretty good. Service is great and very friendly. The food was great the fish is very fresh and in my opinion they have the best tempura batter ever it was light and airy. If there was two or three people the love boat is a wonderful choice. Definitely would recommend you try it!"}
{"text":"I love this place because you get such good sushi for a great price and the atmosphere is kind and cabbage town is great!"}
{"text":"My go-to sushi place. Always super quick and friendly service. Prices are great and food is extremely fresh. Great spot for both dine-in and takeout."}
{"text":"The food is good quality. Nice and fresh and reasonably priced. They have combos that have what I like. They don't fill the bento boxes with surf clam, octopus or other stuff that I don't like. They stick to the popular stuff here.  The waiters disappear for long periods of time. In our last visit there were two waiters for three tables and they still seemed flustered.   I think the waiters must be helping to prepare the food or something.  The location used to be a sketchy bar so I wasn't sure about it at first when a sushi place opened, but this place is good.  If you order to go, they give you little foil things for your soy sauce. This is great."}
{"text":"The greatest sushi in history!The service is absolutely amazing!The staff super friendly,helpful,welcoming  & knowledgeable .I sat in the cozy small private dining section and enjoyed my fresh spicy  California & Dynamite ,super tasty!!!!Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Don't bring friends.  This is actually a \"two seat restaurant\".  I mean, there is a small eating bar against the window with two chairs.  There are no other guest tables.  Take out and delivery is clearly their specialty.  Yes, its small, rather its TINY!  The whole place is probably under 500 square feet, including the kitchen.  But the kitchen is where the magic happens.  I ordered a large sushi/sashimi combo, making sure it was clear that I did not want the dreaded \"white tuna\" mystery fish.  The assortment was quite good!  The miso soup was on point, the salad as is expected, but the main platter was great.    Now, let me be clear--every part of the meal was served in \"take out\" containers.  I felt like I was eating the pre-made sushi in the grocery store, but this was light years better.  It was just a little strange pouring soy sauce into a thin plastic dish.  Still, that did not take anything away from the meal.  I will be back again--but for take out..."}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving it a 4 is bcs it was freezing in there, everybody was wearing their winter jackets. We order our sushi some of them were nice but we had a problem w the spicy ones, there was only panko and barely any fish in it. So I call the waitress Sinmi to explained, she was very apologetic and told me she was gonna take care of it, she offered to give me something else instead, she was really really nice and so helpful. I was very pleased with the treatment and with the food i received after.  I will definatelly come back to this place."}
{"text":"I like this place - the servers are pleasant, the service is fast, and the prices are good. They have some good takeout deals, but also a full menu with lots of variety."}
{"text":"Cozy atmosphere, wouldn't say the food is out of this world but its pretty good. Prices are a bit pricier for a regular sushi joint. If the items on the menu were $1-2 cheaper, I would have given this place an extra star.     Overall, I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"*3.5* stars  I've been here a couple of times.  They have a special for a dynamite roll and 3 pcs of salmon sushi for $9.95.  Not a bad deal. I had a spicy sashimi don.  This is one of my fave dishes at any sushi place. My hubby ordered a bento box, which looked quite good.    The service here was a bit slow, despite there only being 3 tables seated.  We got the impression that this place gets a lot of take out business (that makes sense we've probably had take out here twice and sat in once).  The servers seemed to spend a lot of time waiting for food orders, but watching chefs make sushi isn't going to make it go faster.  Their time would have been better spent checking on the few tables there were to make sure they were happy, and had water etc (thus the 3.5 star rating).  This location is also semi stroller friendly.  There's a ramp, but the restaurant is quite narrow so it can be challenging.  The staff are friendly and accommodating though, they created a make-shift stroller parking area if your child can sit at the table and eat.  In our case, the shifted a table over a bit to make room for our stroller so our infant could be at the table with us."}
{"text":"Went there so many times. The sushi and sashimi are always simply delicious and fresh. But their attitude sometimes was not nice"}
{"text":"This new sushi joint is a great addition to Leslieville and you can still smell the \"new paint smell\" when you walk in. A small space, with 3 booths in the back, a few tables separated by wooden partitions for a bit of privacy, and a larger table for group dining in the middle of the restaurant.  The staff was courteous and offered us hot tea as we waited for our take out order. We ordered sashimi, sushi, and rolls to share. As a bonus, they gave us two portions of salad and miso soup, all fresh and very tasty.  What was really cute was how the napkin was wrapped with the chopsticks, a little packet of soy sauce and even comes with a little plastic tray to hold the sauce!!!!  The rice was fresh and not overly wet and soggy, and the seaweed had a good crunch... it's always hard when you try to take a bite and everything in the roll just completely falls apart. We had a roll with spicy sauce on it, however, there was no heat whatsoever. The reason I've dropped one star is because I found the sashimi to be extremely inconsistent in terms of size. None of the fish was overly big, a little on the small side I must add. However, we had gotten the end cuts of the pieces of red tuna and they were TINY.... almost to the point of scraps so I was really surprised they served it.  All in all, I was pleased with the overall meal and would go back... and hope to get a more consistent sized meal.  P.S. Don't expect overly hot wasabi here.. you're not going to get it."}
{"text":"This restaurant gives you quality service and sushi, for he price of well.. Typical sushi places. But this isn't your typical sushi place.   As soon as you enter, you're greet by either a waiter or the sushi chef. The booths they sit you in are nice as well and cozy, especially for a date.   I've gone more than three times because I'm around the area often, and every time it's been superb.   I would recommend trying the Aburi. You can't go wrong with blow torched sushi for their prices.   I also got the tataki salad which actually had a very interesting but lovely taste. My favourite though is the tuna takaki salad as good tuna (that's not from ayce) is my all time favourite raw fish to eat.   My boyfriend got the spicy salmon roll and that definitely hit the spot. They're proportion are bigger than average (sushi is my passion) and the taste stands out (not in an expired way). You can tell they put care into preparing their dishes.   This is a place I will surely come again if I'm craving good sushi at a decent price."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now. Remarkably this place is not always busy which is a bit of a bonus but doesn't seem right. From the crisp Sapporo draft to the excellent prices to the freshness of the fish to the friendly prompt yet casual service this place is a standout.   Take the extra 10 minutes to get here if you are looking to eat Japanese anywhere downtown or in the village, it's seriously worth it."}
{"text":"A good a la carte sushi place in leslieville. Cheap and quality is good.  The two of us ordered a sushi boat and chicken karaage. The chicken karaage is very unique, like other yelpers said, very light, crispy, and melts in your mouth. The sushi was big and the rice was nice and soft. We left feeling very full.  The bill up to about $40, which isn't bad at all. They have really good lunch specials that I would definitely want to try someday.  Staff are friendly. The food came pretty quickly. There are private booths that you can request to dine in."}
{"text":"Kibo is just down the street and I've been meaning to check it out for a while. My husband is a huge sushi fan and I don't mind it from time to time. We finally decided to drop in for dinner.  The place has neat decor with private booths but nothing special. We were the only patrons in the restaurant which is always a bit questionable but we thought we might as well try it out. We ordered a couple of rolls, edamame, and karaage chicken. I can't say any of it was very good. The edamame was cold, the karaage chicken was particularly greasy, and the rolls were disappointing. I couldn't put my finger on what exactly made the rolls disappointing but then my husband mentioned that it was the rice.... it just wasn't very fresh.   Although the place is very close and the staff seem very friendly and eager, we found the food to be a total miss and won't be returning."}
{"text":"Loved it. Awesome spicy tuna roll and delicious sashimi: salmon, hamachi, tobiko and octopus....mmm, all good! The pieces were nicely sized and everything tasted fresh. Also loved the super hot wasabi."}
{"text":"Food court quality. Typical franchise scene. Miso soup way too salty. When fake crab appeared as part of the sushi combo, you know you can't expect much. Not for foodies. Just fast food sushi. At least it's fresh. Most people were here for the tempura."}
{"text":"Cute sushi place. Service was great and their sushi is pretty good. Will come back again!"}
{"text":"Got my dinner delivery through Just-Eat. (They offer free delivery when it's over $15)  Their spicy crunchy dynamite roll is so good! It's a must try. Absolutely legendary.   I will order again from them to try other things."}
{"text":"(this is a review for a food delivery order)  I ordered 2 items via Foodora delivery service: - 1 Philadelphia roll ($13.75) - 1 Tuna maki ($6.85)  Was very happy with what I got. Both rolls were fresh and tasty, they had lots of fish - you can tell the cooks aren't stingy at all. Sushi tasted amazing! I'm very pleased.  I find that Tuna maki was a bit pricey, however, it's much bigger compared to many other places. As for Philadelphia, it was a bit more expensive than lots of places charge in the area (I usually pay $11-12 for this roll), and it was kind of small... I'm not disappointed, as it was still tasty, but I feel like they could be making those rolls bigger.  Overall, I'm happy with what I got. Foodora did a good job delivering sushi, so I had a nice dinner today. I would recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"Eating in or taking out, Kibo been a constant and dependable Sushi House for us.  As a regular my review could be biased, but the friendly service & conversions, along with great food.   Really made it easy to become attached to our Sushi house of choice!  Spicy Maki Trio still one of my favorites!"}
{"text":"I started coming here thanks to Yelp and all the great reviews. I'd been looking for a good sushi place in my neighbourhood and I guess I always missed this one. Luckily Yelp helped me find this gem.   I usually get my food to go but sometimes I eat in and I love the experience. The restaurant is calm and it is easy to relax and enjoy your food. Sushi is always fresh and flavourful. Love you Kibo, never change!"}
{"text":"I had a pretty good take-away lunch today from Kibo Sushi.  My office was ordering something I didn't really like so I hopped on yelp to find this place.  Three of us ended up ordering from here.  They did forget part of our order, but called me right away and I was able to come back and pick it up.    All of the food was good and fresh.  I really liked the avocado rolls I got.  They also have vegetarian udon which is awesome.  Their agedashi tofu is fully vegetarian and is more like tofu fritters.  I still liked it.  I am definitely going to come back here.  The staff was very friendly.  PS:  If you pay with cash, you get 10 percent off!"}
{"text":"Ordered from here through Just-Eat. Ordered steamed rice which had pieces of either spices (or vegetables) in it. Also ordered one of the vegetarian combos and found the fillings under ripe.   Service was fast and price point was reasonable. However, I probably will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Fresh, friendly and did I mention cheap too?   This is now my favourite lunch spot. While typing this, I am actually ordering dinner to go too. If you are in the area, make sure to try!"}
{"text":"I wish my experience was five stars like everyone else's. I ordered the spicy tuna and spicy salmon combo online and made sure to ask for extra wasabi. Unfortunately, when I got home, there was only two little packets of soy sauce and less than a teaspoon of wasabi. It was very difficult to enjoy it without the condiments. Also, the tempura bits were greasy and salty. Given the other reviews, I will give it a second chance."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Kibo a number of times. And this is the second time coming back after renovation. The food is still living up to standards, however the waitress spends most of her time on her phone, instead of paying attention to her customers.  I had to come up to her to try to get her attention to get more water, and bill."}
{"text":"Takeout in 30min, which is pretty fast. The sushi, sashimi and maki were just OK. We used to go to Sushi Marché a lot and because it was sooo good we didn't bother trying anything else in the area. But Sushi Marché wasn't great the last couple of times and though we'd try something new. Sushi Marché is still better than this, while this is still better than most takeout sushi.  Ordered the Maki, Sushi, Sashimi combos A & B. Both were decent, certainly enough food for two people. Also came with salad & soup. Sushi was pretty fresh, although a few of the pieces of sushi and sashimi seemed to have a cooked garlicy taste to them. Maybe transferred from the cutting board? Or maybe intended? Either way, not really good. And where's the shiso leaves? The rice was too tightly packed and lacked flavour. Wasabi was bland and thin.  I'd give this place another go considering it's about half the price of Sushi Marché, but also half as good."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to the Kibo Sushi house.  We were looking for a good restaurant along the avenue road area, and this restaurant had some pretty good reviews on Yelp.  It wasn't what I was expecting.  The restaurant is more geared towards takeout.  There are spots to sit at a counter along the window.  We were expecting a proper sit down meal.  The food was good and the server was very helpful.  They were also able to qualify what I could and couldn't eat because I must eat a gluten free diet.  I had several options.  The prices were very fair, and the servings were generous.  It's not the place you want to have a meeting or go on a date, but the food is good, fair-priced, and the service was quick."}
{"text":"My Girlfriend and I have become a bit of a regular at Kibo since they opened up in our nieghbourhood. We tend to go twice/month. The food is well put together, reasonably priced (compared to other Sushi Houses in the area) and tasty - not to mention the excellent service.  Recommended items on the menu: Salmon Red Dragon, Spider Rolls, Spicy Cabbage along with the Shashimi"}
{"text":"Had a decent sushi lunch here yesterday.  Shared the black dragon roll (dragon roll with unagi on top) as well as a bento box that came with chicken, tempura, miso soup, salad and a mini california roll.  Dragon roll and miso soup were both very good, everything else was average. Overall the food was fine but nothing spectacular, and the value wasn't great. Service also seemed a little slow considering it wasn't too busy. Overall our experience was fine but if I'm back in the area I'd probably try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Best take out in the area hands down! Every single time we order from here and it's probably been close to 10 times now (yiks!) It's been fresh food with great portions! All of the meals come with a miso soup and salad and their sashimi is always fresh! Kibo Sushi is definitely our go to take out and also they usually delivery well within 30 min of ordering!"}
{"text":"Nice decor, friendly staff, and great food. You know it's a good place when the worst thing you can say is that the bathroom was almost out of TP. Wouldn't hesitate to go back next time I'm in the area!"}
{"text":"Great Daily Deals.  Price: (5 stars) If you do delivery and pay with cash you get an extra 10% off.  Food: (5 stars) Likely the best miso soup I had ever had.  The 8 dragon roll 8 salmon roll roll was fantastic.  The salad was the standard lettuce salad that you get in your sushi combos.  Service:  I did not interact a lot with anyone there, so will not give a star rating for this.  I parked in front of the restaurant (there is street parking that you might have to pay for depending when you go). My food was ready when I got there, so there was no wait time.    Atmosphere: Very small restaurant, not great for groups.  I did takeout so will not comment too much on this."}
{"text":"This was my first time at Kibo after finding it in Yelp and it is definitely one of the best sushi experiences I've had. The atmosphere is very unique with chandeliers and weathered wood and jazz playing in the background. It gives the place a sense of occasion you usually only get from the very high end sushi restaurants. This place is definitely a step above you're regular AYCE place but still casual enough to be your regular every day sushi place.  The staff is very friendly and polite. It did take them a while to refill our green tea and water but I'm sure we could have just asked and it would have been done right away with no issues.  For food I got the $35 matsu set. A little on the pricier side but worth every penny! You get so much food! Miso soup Gomae (sp?) Unagi, tempura and a 15 piece mixed set of sushi/sashimi that was top quality. I'm definitely excited to come back and I'd recommend anyone trying it out!"}
{"text":"I order from this place via uber eats all the time. Its quick and the food is delicious. Definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"We've been to the Kibo on Parliament before and I would say this Leslieville location is very similar in every way.  I'll start off by saying that both locations have good service and I really appreciate the effort the staff takes to make sure we had what we needed throughout our meal.   We were there for dinner and got the boat combo for two.  It's very filling and in that sense, it is great value. Having said that, none of the items actually require much skill to make. I'd never order edamame or tempura normally, but it was part of the combo. It was such a large portion that by the time our sushi came we were half full.  The tempura batter was brown (overdone?) and not authentic.  The edamame was boiled to death and overly salted, but I guess it doesn't matter since you don't eat the pods.    The sushi was disappointing, mostly because it's the same typical trio of fish that you see everywhere.  Tuna, Salmon, some tasteless white fish (likely tilapia), repeat. I don't eat sushi in TO much anymore for this reason and tend to go to izakayas instead. I think Kibo does prepare their sushi fresh, but seriously, the fish is not particularly fresh. It barely taste like anything, and if I closed my eyes, it could pass for sushi from the food court, or grocery store, or AYCE. Most sushi restaurants in TO are so mindless and boring. And it's probably not Kibo's fault because everyone likely gets their fish from the same suppliers. And probably the lack of variety in sushi grade fish available to restaurants? I dunno.    Bottom line though, yes I would return (not often) to Kibo - when I don't want to cook and want a simple dinner, because my expectation is an okay meal at a decent value.  PS: For those who drive, it's easy to find free parking in the evenings."}
{"text":"I'd highly recommend paying Kibo Sushi a visit if you're in the Cabbagetown area. Amazingly fresh sashimi prepared by a chef who has a great eye for food styling. While the decor isn't traditionally Japanese, I thought it fit the restaurant very well. Brightly lit, yet intimate, with fresh yellow tulips at our table; in a word, elegant.   We had the set course for three which was a huge (see panorama) platter of assorted sushi and sashimi, along with green salad, miso soup, and edamame. Chicken kara-age and a selection of tempura were also featured. After tax and tip, this ran about $97, but the level of service and cuisine was well worth it. A phenomenal experience all in all. I look forward to returning."}
{"text":"The service is great and attentive. Also if you pay in cash you will get 10% off. The menu looks very unique and they have interesting rolls. However, their sushi does not taste fresh. The sashimi is quite chewy which is not what sashimi should taste like. I feel as though they served me a piece of sashimi that normally would have been thrown away by other restaurants because it was so rubbery and hard to break down and swallow. Their miso soup and salad is quite good but I was not impressed with the quality of the fish they use.The food in general just tasted odd."}
{"text":"I only get delivery from here but the quality of the food is great. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Quick, cheap and easy option for take-out sushi, as there isn't any seating. If you're in a hurry, Kibo offers some grab and go options for $5 (cash only), and these are basic maki rolls, and sometimes other snack options. The sushi itself isn't out of this world, but limited options in the area make it a viable option for a fast and inexpensive lunch."}
{"text":"Most things I ordered was ok. But I'm actually offended they put teeny tiny fully cooked bay scallops with all tempura filler into my spicy scallop maki. It's misleading and not what's in the menu picture. Sushimi grade scallops shouldn't be replaced by frozen cooked scallops you can get at the grocery store. Shame on you."}
{"text":"First time ordering delivery at this place... And everything was a great experience. From the person who answered the phone, friendly and patient, to the smiling delivery guy.  Sushi was amazing. Absolutely delicious. It's a little bit pricey for me, but it was worth it. I usually order from another place a bit cheaper and this time I decided to pay a little more and thank god, no regrets on doing so.  Days later, as I write this review, I'm salivating just remembering the taste.... 100% recommended.  Philadelphia sushi was outstanding :)"}
{"text":"Okay so the atmosphere wasn't very swank. The music was weird, the lights were too bright, and there were too many whiny kids. Serves us right for dining before 8 pm. This is Leslieville afterall. We didn't even get a booth which bummed me out. Then the edamame ($3.59 or something) was a microwaved mess which made me nervous about the main course. Turning point! I am happy to say the sushi was decent. For $29.99 a \"party tray\" for two was very satisfying. There were no particularly interesting departures here, but all the fish was fresh and the rice was a perfect consistency.  I think this little hole in the Leslieville wall has a lot more to offer which is why I give it four stars despite it's obvious lack of panache."}
{"text":"Fresh, delicious sushi. This place was such a treat to find. Such a wonderful environment and interior.   A true gem in the neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Recently found this spot from Uber Eats. I now have our go-to Japanese spot for takeout meals. Maki rolls are quite big, and I really enjoy the miso soup. Decently priced as well."}
{"text":"Disappointing. First the pros: the portions are generous (Sashimi A was quite big, and filling), the service is good, and they have excellent ice cream for dessert. They do not close between lunch and dinner, so it's very convenient if you want a mid- or late-afternoon meal. Also, if you pay cash there's a 10% discount. But I was seriously unimpressed with the quality of the fish. A lot of the sashimi pieces were chewy, and the tuna tasted \"off\", to the point that I wondered if it was okay to eat. It turned out okay, but I got no enjoyment from it whatsoever. The generous portions felt more like a punishment than like a perk."}
{"text":"Ever since they opened back up earlier this month the service has went downhill.   I think because all of the employees look new they don't know how to provide customer service! the girls from before the fire were always nice to me because i was a usual.   I'd come in for cash and carry which is advertised on their board for $5  Now.. apparently they charge an extra $1 for no reason without even asking if you're paying with cash.. i'm not being stingy but seriously? first of all i did tell you i'm ordering for cash and carry and even if i wasn't paying with cash it should still be $5 with a .50 fee on the machine like it used to be.   They never own up to their mistakes and blame the customers! You know you're wrong you dumb bimbo.   And don't talk in your language and assume those around you don't understand it's never good to judge a book by its cover.   OH and my spicy \"salmon\" roll had little to NO salmon. it was full of their tempura crumbs inside and out.   Sorry but your sushi rolls used to be the shit, but with your shitty service I can find myself elsewhere.   On the bright side - the decor is nice"}
{"text":"Fresh, original sushis and darn good combinations (maki rolls, huge, good and original) in a renovated place (after the previous one burned in a fire). Hence, a good spot here in the neighborhood for sure.  Not 5, because: 1/ waitress was terrible, not friendly, not helping... nothing! terrible!!! throwing things on the table, even the credit card machine at the end! no excuse me, no welcome, no goodbye! a shame for a Japanese restaurant! the BIG downside of this place!!! and  2/ well, there are still some other sushi places in Toronto that have higher quality (and more expensive) fish... and again, much much nicer service!  Update: went back and new waiter way much better, attentive etc. let's hope it will be regular now..."}
{"text":"They've definitely up'd their game since the last time I came here.  Their lunch bento boxes are great portion, and I love their tempura! It's lightly battered goodness.   The service is a bit slow, but super friendly. The food arrives quick so at least that's good thing!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Fresh and tasty. Great service. Great value.  Great renovation too. After moving to leslieville over a year ago the only thing I missed of my old hood (the annex) was the variety of awesome and cheap sushi restaurants. Finally!  One that not only compares but maybe even surpasses them. Loved the crazy $10 lunch I just had. Crazy bento with sushi and spicy beef gyoza sesame noodles soup salad and tea. Boy am I happy. Enjoy neighbors!  Every day a place like this opens my neighborhood gets better and better!"}
{"text":"This was a great place to pick up lunch for five dollars unfortunately now they are closed due to a fire. THEY HAVE REOPENED!!! YAY!!"}
{"text":"Came here for a Mother's Day dinner with my parents. Overall it was decent (probably more of a 3.5/5 than a 4/5). The portion sizes were fairly generous but the rice on all the sushi wasn't packed very well and would fall apart when you tried to pick it up. I might come again another time for the lunch specials though, there was a sign outside listing them and there were some great dea"}
{"text":"Fresh sushi and presented a little differently than the usual. There were thinly sliced red onions garnishing one of the rolls I ordered. Nice touch and flavour."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Sushi experience I've had in Toronto. Not another cookie-cutter Sushi joint - Incredible attention to detail, taste, and presentation in an overall cozy interior, superb customer service, and high-quality, fresh ingredients. Very reasonably priced for the atmosphere and definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Excellent value...very polite and prompt service. Portions were artfully displayed, beautiful even. Tiny little place has been open a month; will definitely go back. One drawback, and this is not as big deal is the decor is a bit basic, as in Spartan. The previous restaurant in this location was a hole, and  these guys need to spruce it up a bit. But otherwise an excellent dining experience. The specials are good value, they do take out and fodora."}
{"text":"I regularly order from here and they constantly forget our order. They claim their connection was down or they didn't get the order despite receiving email confirmation. They were like \"we gave you extra sushi\" and then when I checked they didn't and actually forgot stuff. They also automatically add tip on the online ordering. Also received a giant hair in my salad last order... staff is really rude and unapologetic."}
