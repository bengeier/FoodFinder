{"text":"Three words you need to know about Aroma: Israeli style sandwiches.  If those words mean anything to you, you'll want to check this place out. If those words don't mean anything to you, then you're in for a treat. The sandwiches you get here are different from your standard \"wrap\":  The bread is a fresh, soft, round pita cut at the top and layered with an assortment of fillings, including hummus, tahini, eggplant, tabbouleh, cabbage, coleslaw, hot peppers, salad, smoked chili sauce....all on top of your choice of fresh grilled chicken kabobs, shawarma, or wonderfully crunchy and light falafel. You'll end up with a pita packed full of fresh, tasty goodness that will keep you full for hours. (Prepare to be amazed at how heavy that small pita gets once it's packed with deliciousness.)  In addition to sandwiches, the shop does traditional Middle Eastern appetizers and a few substantial \"plates\" that looked quite good. We had the hummus appetizer, which was amazing (homemade hummus with tahini sauce on top, topped again with a smoky, roasted chili sauce that was sublime), all served with fresh-grilled pita.   The owner gave me a sample of fresh-made falafel when I asked whether it too was \"Israeli style\", and oh boy - I need to go back there soon and get a falafel sandwich. Divine. (The falafel is light and crisp, not mushy as it so often is at other places, and it's perfectly seasoned.)  Aroma is brand new as of the third week in May, and I hope that it does well. I stopped in only because I was famished and was looking for something quick to eat, and upon initial inspection, the shop was no different than the hundreds of other similar shops around town. I was absolutely thrilled when I realized that the sandwich style was Israeli --  a fact that I personally think would be worth advertising --  so I hope word gets out that this places does things differently than the kabob shops that are usually run by Lebanese or Egyptians (and thus have different pita, different fillings, and heavily minted falafel. Not bad, just different.)   Here's hoping this first year allows them to build a solid client base and that business treats them well, because this place is great!"}
{"text":"This restaurant newly opened in the beaches when I walked by. It's not very inviting when you first look at it.  My first time eating there was less then satisfactory. The meat in the chicken shawarma that I ordered was great, but the pita was so cold and didn't feel fresh. I'm assuming it was the Cold pita that cooled my chicken. Mind you, it was around 9:30pm when I went there, so, not prime time.   I decided to give it another try.  The second time I went I was much more pleased with the food, it was great overall, but the man serving me was a little abrasive. Maybe it's just me, but I don't like being told that a certain salad will taste good, and it be put on my food without me choosing it... Call me old fashioned. Well, luckily I didn't dislike what was put on my pita, but I can't say I'd order it myself."}
{"text":"New Gem!  Give it a try and you'll be hooked.  I had chicken in a pita which was loaded with flavour, Morrocan cigars and spicy carrots.  Loved it!"}
