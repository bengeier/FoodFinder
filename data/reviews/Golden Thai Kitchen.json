{"text":"I like this place first time here was a little hesitant to walk in but once I did I notice a clean restaurant and nice environment, service was good and the food great."}
{"text":"This is 1 of the best Thai restaurants I have been to. Especially being in the area it's in. As always, ordered Chicken Pad Thai, and veggie and chicken Red Curry. Absolutely bomb delicious!!  A glass of there Thai Iced Tea makes it even better. The one thing negative about that I'd there are no refills. I was kinda put off. Like what place charges for refills?! Especially being over $2 a glass! And I'm one that is sort of sensitive to heat, so I was disappointed about that. But overall, clean, friendly environment and great food!"}
{"text":"We are from out of town and came here to visit relatives. Craving Thai food, we found  Golden Thai Kitchen and we're not disappointed. My sister, a vegetarian, had the Pad Thai and thought it was pretty good. My grandma had Panang Curry and enjoyed it. I had the Yellow Curry and loved it! We will be back next time we are in town"}
{"text":"My coworker and I always order the Pad Thai. It is delicious! The waitress is friendly and always remembers us. Maybe one day i will order the curry! I love this place!"}
{"text":"Te pad kee Mao is delicious!!!! just the right about of noodles, the perfect spiciness, the amount of meat!! the waitress is also super friendly!  can't wait to try some other things on the other menu!"}
{"text":"Excellent! No complaints at all clean restaurant. I ordered the yellow curry lunch special with chicken. It was really delicious I got it spicy and it was spicy but not too much. Good quantity of steamed rice perfectly done also they gave me a little dumpling or something on the side that was also very good. I will definitely come here again. And very inexpensive only seven dollars for the lunch special."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. I ordered the yellow curry both times because it is SO GOOD that I don't want to try anything else. The \"medium\" is just spicy enough and very flavorful. I've ordered medium at some Thai restaurants that is so spicy that it blows you out of the water, which is not the case here. Service is speedy and the portions are a good size for the price. It is definitely worth the extra drive to West Phoenix."}
{"text":"Solid food & service. I've only liked one Thai place but unfortunately it's on the far east valley. Looks like I've got a new one! :)"}
{"text":"Outstanding Thai food. Fresh and flavorful food in every dish.  My wife adores the red curry and the spring roll appetizer.   I've had a few things from the yellow curry to the pad thai.  Everything is worth getting twice! An absolute win. Be sure to try either the coconut ocean or the mango dessert both worth the trip alone."}
{"text":"Gave them a 5, I've been to many Thai restaurants here in AZ and CA. This by far has been the best place I've been to!  The coconut mushroom soup is so good! We had pad thai, yum! The larb is so perfect,  especially for the summer! It's refreshing,  light and fulfilling.  I had pad woon sen with chicken and OMG, the best ever.  The veggies are fresh,  the taste is delightful and the price is just right!  This will be the spot for me going forward when I'm in the mood for Thai food!"}
{"text":"Wonderful Pad Thai! One of the few Thai restaurants that have a decent Pad Thai. There's no weird orange sauce here. Just a play of deliciousness! Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"A friend and I went in for lunch. The menu is fairly small with not many choices but the food is very good. I had the yellow curry and practically licked the bowl when it was gone. My friend was very happy with his selection as well. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"V good food I am vegetarian they cook v good veggie food i go there almost every  week I love Thai food is family own Resturent that r so good people good service red curry is my favorite"}
{"text":"This place was awesome! The Pad Thai was delicious! The service was quick and friendly! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have to confess, I didn't know the store closed at 9 (I flew in from a different time zone so I didn't know what time it was), we came in probably something like 8:40. Even though we were probably considered jerks (and we were!), we were treated like kings and the food was delicious. It's not the best Thai food I've ever had (that award goes to Golden Singha in Seattle), but it was very, very good. The service was impeccable and the portions were perfect.

I would return to this restaurant anytime, and to the people that served us: sorry we came in so late, really!"}
{"text":"Don't let the location of this restaurant fool you! I have been to Golden Thai Kitchen numerous times and they always seem to impress me. The waitress is extremely friendly, and the food doesn't take long to get out to your table. 

I had the Green Curry w/shrimp, and it is hands down one of the best ,if not the best that I have had. The size of the dish isn't too big, but just enough to fill you up. I also had the Thai tea which was great as well. 

Don't judge a book by its cover. TRY THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"This place was ok, nothing to write home about. I had the fried spring rolls, which were good, fish cakes and pad thai. I have had much better pad thai at places in Seattle. I had never had fish cakes before, so I can't compare them to anything else. They were so-so. All in all, a decent but not great Thai place."}
{"text":"I love golden thai I have been coming here since 75thai closed , everything here is amazing!!!!"}
{"text":"A great local Thai place, very good food and clean environment. Very busy but great service. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Got to be my favorite quick Thai food in the Valley!  Excellent options and like many others I went for the lunch special with yellow curry and chicken.  Superb!  Portions are large enough to bring home leftovers great the next day."}
{"text":"Friendly service. Curries are great. Tried Penang and red. Chad Thai and pineapple fried rice are OK. We returned here the next day."}
{"text":"Can't go wrong at all ordering from The Golden Thai Kitchen..... My favorite is the #18 Pad se ew spicy..... The yellow curry is great as well as the Pad Thai, pineapple sticky rice, and spring rolls..... I'm sure everything on the menu is good.... The Golden Thai Kitchen is definitely a hidden gem.......Give it a try.....:)"}
{"text":"Amazing food! Simple, friendly, clean, flavorful, fresh! My wife and I go here and we always enjoy it! One server and she does a great job by herself! Affordable too!"}
{"text":"I can never get tired of this place their food never ceases to disappoint me. My family and I would always order the pad see ew with the chicken fried rice and it always tastes fresh and very appetizing. I plan to go often as long as I'm in the area."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I go there at least once a week. Everyone is so friendly & on top of that there food is bomb! I thank my parents for taking us there!"}
{"text":"Really great Thai food with amazing prices! My favorites are the Pad Kee Mao and the Golden Fried Thai Rice! The place is small and feels like you're in their home! I'd definitely recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Fell across this place looking for a now defunct fish chain (no judging, I had a rough week) & am so happy I did. I've had luck finding Vietnamese aka my fave Pho on the Westside but not Thai & am so happy I now have a go to. The spice level can be requested to your taste so if you don't enjoy molten you don't have to endure. Same for the opposite. If you like molten curry this place is for you too. Fresh, tasty & quick. Not much to look at honestly but it's clean & the Thai is legit. I had the Thai Chicken Curry & the hubs had the Pad Thai which we both really enjoyed. I'm definitely giving this place 2 thumbs up."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to eatiiing here after reading all of the positive reviews.i was not at all that impressed with this place. I ordered red curry with vegetables (no meat no tofu) my firend ordered red curry with shrimp. I asked for thai hot which is supposed to be the hottest. My mate asked for a level 4 heat. We started out with a starter of fresh spring rolls(shrimp) the spring rolls were very good and the peanut sauce Was very good also. I would recommend the fresh spring rolls. Now on to the main dishes. My curry was very dissappointing, for vegetablles .Their were very small broccoli florets(without the stem) im not talking aboujt the big florets you see in salads or in most stir frys im talking about little tiny florets the ones that you find at the botttom of the soup bowl or all crushed up at the bottom of your salad, and sliced carrots and tons of bamboo shoots, that was all. Not satisifying.And i was not full or even half way full. Now the curry did have a good cocunut flavour but it was sweet .Dissappointing as i had asked for thai hot . My mates said his curry was too sweet also. Their were no veg in his curry other than potatoes and onion. He did say and i agree their was a good curry flavour and lots of it. Just way too sweet. Not sure if i would come back to eat here. Perhaps if i was in the neighboorhood. But i wouldnt go out of my way. Its sad, another thai restaurant thats dissappointing."}
{"text":"Food tasted fresh and very reasonable priced.  They were quick with greeting the food out. Not sure why this place isn't busy."}
{"text":"Very good food! Not at all what I was expecting when I first walked in. Great service and the best fried rice I have tried."}
{"text":"Had drunken noodles, Pad Thai and fresh summer rolls.  We also got yellow curry to go.  Food arrived fast and fresh.  It seems a family business and food was flavorful and delicious.  Pad Thai was not dry or overly sweet.  I highly recommend a try if you like Thai."}
{"text":"Super delicious! We had the green curry and tom yum. All I have to say is: great service, great food!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's such a gem in crappy Maryvale. It deserves more business! I used to go here all the time before I moved. I usually got the yellow curry or Pad Thai with tofu. Sweetest waitress ever, quick, good prices and portions. Go here!"}
{"text":"Horrible, the absolute worst Thai food that I have ever had. No flavor, just bland. Made the mistake of ordering for takeout, took two bites and threw it out."}
{"text":"Nice little family restaurant. The people there are super nice and the food was BEYOND delicious!!! I came in from California and was recommended this Thai restaurant from my sister. I'd definitely go back when I come into town again"}
{"text":"So good. Love the spiciness.The Iced Thia Tea was amazing. Can't wait to go back and try different entrees."}
{"text":"This place is unbelievable!!! This is the best yellow curry I have ever had and funny enough it is the cheapest I have ever paid for it.  The environment is comfy and the service is great. I rarely write reviews for anything but I adore this place. I want to try other dishes but I love the yellow curry so much I can't not order it when I'm here."}
{"text":"Place is alright. I'm not against the place, but I won't go out of my way for it either. My office orders regularly from Golden Thai, but I find that their portions are small for a thai place. Freshness of the land-based food adds a star, but like most places in Arizona, the shrimp isn't fresh. (Fresh shrimp means they are shipped to Arizona, alive, swimming in a tank, still, free of formaldehyde, and are killed at the restaurant, THAT'S fresh, which you will find in more metropolitan cities such as Los Angeles, Seattle, New York City, etc).

Still, the options here aren't bad. Try the pad thai or the pad see ew. In hot Phoenix summers, get a Thai tea.

Cheers."}
{"text":"Best Thai place in town. Been coming here for a long time. Pad kee mao is the best and their Thai fried rice is amazing. Price is reasonable as well!"}
{"text":"Great food, fast service and it's family run. I really like the pad kee mao and the egg rolls are bomb!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero I would we arrived at 2:30pm & when we walked in we weren't greeted with  hello...no she said to go order only we close in 30 min....I tell her make it however you want we will eat it here as we have movie to go to...was the food good  yes...but the treatment on walking in bad.  Are you trying to make money or not..."}
{"text":"We were out shopping at Living Spaces and are always on the lookout for good Thai or Vietnamese food. GOOD being the operative word. Well, this place needs an operation (hah), because it was not good. We both were sick several hours later. We knew it couldn't be the cookie that only I ate at Living Spaces, so this meal was the culprit. Granted, this was about six months ago now, but I'm still thinking about it. The sad thing is the meals weren't that special to begin with."}
{"text":"Random lunch stop and went for the usual chicken pad thai as I dined in the empty restaurant near the end of the lunchtime period. Only $6.95 for the entree and a crispy spring roll. The pad thai was a good version with bean sprouts, white chicken and some crushed peanuts hanging out on the side of the plate (maybe some more?). Their twist is the four pack of sauces that they give you when the entree arrives. One was a yellow powder that was supposed to be fiery and another was also a hot sauce, both of which I had to avoid, but good for hot food fans. I did try the light red sauce that was was kind of sweet and hot and added some flavor gringo style. Can't beat the service either when your the only one in the place."}
{"text":"Delish, had flat noodles w/ shrimp spicy, Mmm mmm. I mentioned to server that it was my first time she was very helpful and friendly she ask what I'd like noodles or rice. Then point out plates with noodles. I devoured the noodles before even thinking of taking a pic. I will definitely recommend. And be back to try the curry."}
{"text":"Legitimately the best Thai meal I have had since my trip to Bangkok and Hua Hin last year. Thank you Yelp reviewers who gave me the heads up to try the food here. My family and I were driving in the neighborhood looking for something to eat on a busy Saturday night. We usually go ethnic during the weekends because traditional American and Italian eateries are packed.

Tip: Golden Thai offers a wide range of heat. I can handle some spice, but the mild was more than enough heat for me. I don't like eat so much heat that it masks my ability to detect other layers of flavor.

When I go to a Thai restaurant, I am usually in the hunt for fish cakes. I wasn't holding my breath here because we checked out their menu online, and it wasn't one of the offerings. However, one of my kids noticed they had fish cakes and papaya salad posted on the wall. Eureka! They gave us a generous portion for $7.95. The dipping sauce was perfectly balanced, and I saved it to complement my Pad Thai. The other appetizer we ordered was the Nam Tok or grilled beef salad. When we asked our server which she would recommend, the Larb or Nam Tok, she told us that the spicing and preparation was the same except the Larb is made with ground pork. The flavors were tangy and robust. It was as good as any I have tried. 

We ordered two noodle dishes. The Pad Thai was subtle and well prepared. The Pad See Ew or the wide rice noodle sauteed in dark soy was AMAZING! It came wafting with the classic wok hei (or wok caramelization). It looked great and tasted great. If there were two dishes that I could eat everyday, it would be the Pad See Ew and the fish cakes.

The Panang Curry with Thai rice was very nice. It was sweet, creamy and savory. The vegetables in the curry was finely cut. Overall the chef at Golden Thai is topnotch. The vegetables were finely prepared and chopped. The presentation was beautiful. The flavors were complex and en pointe with the cuisine I am familiar with in Thailand. I cannot wait to come back and try more dishes.

Note: Chef is from Bangkok. They will be going on vacation from mid-September to mid-October, 2017. 

Our server was friendly and informative. This is a family owned business, and we are so fortunate to have such a terrific hole-in-the-wall Thai restaurant in the West Valley."}
{"text":"My friend loves this place. Not huge Into Thai but gave it a try. Was impressed. Place is nice and clean. Ample room and service is amazing. A had curry and rice. Good was great for my first time. Will surely return and try different items on the menu. Brought my kid and didn't see anything on the menu specially for little kids. Employee offered to specially make a bowl of rice and chicken with vegetables. Really cool.


Check it out."}
{"text":"Had a quick lunch here. Service fast, to the point. Could be more friendly and food took awhile. Only one person front, though she did a fairly good job keeping up. Small restaurant, simple. I'd eat here again."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Its a small mom and pop place.  So its  not a big fancy place like a pf chang .  Large menu and it changes every few months.  I have tried a few of their items on their menu and like everyone.  great place for Thai food.  I love it."}
{"text":"This was our first take-away from this very good restaurant. They have a large menu from which we selected the Thai fried rice with tofu, Green Curry tofu, Yellow Curry chicken, and spring rolls (both veg and chicken). From the taste and quality of this meal, we will be back. It was a very good value for quite good food, we intend to try some of the other items next time. We did note that they will be closed for the holidays from 12/12/15 to 1/10/16..."}
{"text":"Love, love, love this place. Happened upon this jewel in Phoenix. My husband even liked it. Went in and ordered for myself and ended up sharing the plate with him. I don't remember what I had, sorry, but it was flat noodles that had an amazing garlic taste, with carrots and broccoli in it. The dish was well balanced and was honestly way more than I could have eaten by myself. I ordered off the lunch menu, which was a short version of their dinner menu. I will be going back to try more things. Very friendly staff, fast, and did I mention delicious? They do close down at 3, but reopen I believe at 4:30 or 5 for dinner. Super tasty and next time we go hubby will have to order his own. I am sure the left overs are just as good."}
{"text":"Best restaurant in Phoenix area, very authentic Thai! Amazing service and family owned business."}
{"text":"After reading reviews I sent my husband on a 25 min round trip adventure to pick up dinner. We both got pad see ew & they made sure to add extra sauce to the platters so it wasn't dried out by the time he got home (bonus points for Golden Thai Kitchen!). He said the staff was so kind & friendly. The food was awesome, it definitely ranks #2 for pad see ew in the valley for me. We've been back quite a few times since then & they always remember our order. They did mention that they will be closed for a bit in September which is a bummer but it's nice to see that they are taking time for their families."}
{"text":"One of my favorite thai places in west Phoenix! Small, family owned restaurant. The Food is always fresh and taste great. Service is amazing, we're always greatly within the first 2 minutes of arriving. Also, super important,  it's clean!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, and they bring it out at light speed.  They must have a magic genie in the back."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner enjoyed my food and my wife loved her as well. Staff was friendly, kind and attentive. Prices are very reasonable and food is tasty and authentic. Can't miss here for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"My friends and I came here for lunch and the food was great we had pad Thai, if you want it spicy you need to ask for it extra spicy, but the service was great, the prices were reasonable, and the food was wonderful. It's small but it has a good vibe to it. They have outlets at just about every table so you can charge your phone."}
{"text":"This is my first go-to Thai restaurant on the west valley for Khai Jiao (Thai omelet). It's sooooooooooo good. They make it special order for me and ask them not to put any sauce and it's still so good. Seriously, Golden Thai Kitchen makes the best Khai Jiao, so go get yourself some.

I've been going there so much that the waitress know my usual. My husband always get chicken pad Thai and he likes it. I need to try the other dishes and I'm sure they'll taste good. I was talking to another customer one time and she told me that they're gluten-free friendly. I shall try the other dishes then."}
{"text":"This restaurant doesn't look like much, just another place in a small strip mall next to a Mexican restaurant.  However, I always get good food there for good prices.  I usually get one of the curry dishes and have leftovers.  I live within a mile or so of the restaurant and sometimes even if I'm not hungry I have to stop in and get a Thai iced tea to go."}
{"text":"Amazing!! The Thai place that was there before this one was my favorite spot, close to my house and great food. I was very upset and set back when I went back to get some of my fav Seafood Noodle Soup, to find out they had left :(
I drove past this Golden Thai Kitchen when it first opened and I had high hopes, that this place would last a long time and be just as amazing as my old spot. WOW! Is all I have to say. Their menu is very straight forward and also has pictures of the food, which in my book is very helpful when choosing a dish at a new place. The waiter is very friendly and is quick to bring drinks and constantly ask if you need anything, which most waiters need to learn how to do.
I've had their Thai Tea (the best I've had) , Pad Kee Mao Level 6 Spicy added Mushrooms and baby corn... Amazing. Pad Woon-Sen Level 8 Spicy amazing, Tom Yum level 8 spicy with extra mushrooms.. to die for. Green Curry though it's in a small dish not really enough to share but is a good self portion, great flavor. The Beef Salad & Shrimp Salad- I can't even describe how refreshing and delicious this is.. especially with our heat its the perfect amount and will keep your taste buds wanting more!! and I've nibbled off my families plates... everything is so flavorful. If you want great Thai food.. this is defiantly the place to come!! you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"absolutely the best Thai! We have eaten other Thai food but the flavors here are fantastic. We will continue to come back to the family owned business...mom, son and daughter. The recipes belong to mom, a native Thai."}
{"text":"While hanging out with my hockey buddy, we decided to grab some dinner and I let him steer. He was in the mood for some Thai food and I was in the mood for something different, so Thai sounded good. And there happened to be a Thai restaurant very close to his place. He spoke highly of Golden Thai, and now I can see why.

Golden Thai is one of those places that you shouldn't judge by its cover. It's hidden in a fairly standard shopping center near a Lowe's store. And in my experience, most Thai restaurants aren't exactly Taj Mahals. While not holding the simple surroundings against it, the photos of the entrees on the wall gave me confidence that this was a good choice.

Even the photos I attached to this review don't do the food justice. I chose the Pad Thai for my meal and added some Egg Rolls. I wanted the Spring Rolls, but they didn't have them on the Friday night when we visited. Regardless, they were piping hot and delicious! Plus, while my entree was pretty monochromatic, it was very tasty. There was a nice sweetness, not unlike curry, along with a great spice.

Golden Thai is a simple, clean and very satisfying little restaurant. Plus, the young lady who took our orders was helpful and provided some wonderful service. If you're in the west valley near 75th Avenue and McDowell, it's worth looking into."}
{"text":"Great service, very attentive waitress. Pad thai is so-so...good, but not great. But their pad see ew is sooooooooo good. Panang curry too. Lunch specials also available on weekends 11 am to 2 pm."}
{"text":"Good sized portions for the price. Everything I've tried so far was great. The staff is very friendly too."}
{"text":"Came here because of the reviews and we were not disappointed.  The food was yummy and service was great.  Would come again if we lived in the area."}
{"text":"Very good and great friendly service I will be returning to this place try it!! Got the fried rice with shrimp veryyyyy spicy but oh so good"}
{"text":"I'm in the Phoenix area working on a new job and was introduced to this little Thai place by a couple of coworkers from China. Service is quick and friendly. Prices are very reasonable. The food is great! You get large portions of flavorful and authentic Thai food. The spicy fried rice is a real winner. The fresh spring rolls are outstanding. The portions are very generous. If you are in the area the Thai Kitchen is a must try."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! The spicy noodles are my fav!! We order to go all the time!!! The service is really fast! The spring rolls are just ok wish they had more shrimp in them."}
{"text":"Best Thai food in the west valley!  Nice variety of dishes.  The service is wonderful.  Very attentive and helpful.  I am always amazed at how fast the food is prepared and served.  I think the portion size is perfect for the lunch specials-I am full, but not tempted to be a glutton because it's too good to stop eating.  The prices are excellent.  The food is flavorful and fresh, and they can make it spicy like I like it and mild for my friends.  I are there for lunch and find myself wishing I could go back for dinner.  You have to try it..so good!"}
{"text":"I work behind this Thai restaurant, at first I was really upset when the old thai place closes but it's not bad at all. The portions are very good the staff treats you like family, and they also have very good lunch specials."}
{"text":"Best Thai on the west side!  And the service is great.  The waitress is always in a great mood, she remembers you, and the food is fresh.  Everyone is very quick to serve and makes sure you are set.  There hasn't been a time where we've been disappointed.  We take family here when they are in from out of town and they love it!"}
{"text":"One of our favorite go to restaurants! Their food is always fresh and amazing. 

My friends and I always go here when we can't decide what to eat. The server has gotten to know us, every time we go in it's like visiting a family/friend."}
{"text":"This place is sooo good!!! Like it's been a while since I've had a good plate of Thai food! And we came for lunch and had green curry and pad Thai noodles! LET ME JUST TELL YOU! The green curry is to die for! Soo soo sooo good!!!  you need to try this place ASAP! So worth it and very inexpensive"}
{"text":"I will start off by saying that I was very hesitant to try this place.  The thai place that was housed here before this was very near and dear to my heart.  It was where a close knit group of friends and I often met to break bread and enjoy one another's company.  But I caved and gave it a chance...I'm glad I did!

I am a sucker for Pad Woon-Sen.  So of course, this is what I ordered.  I was excited when she asked me how spicy I wanted it and I quickly answered, \"VERY!\"  I got what I ordered!  A steaming plate of glass noodles mixed with chicken, mushrooms, broccoli, and other veggies.  It also comes with a side of rice.  The thing about this was that the level of spiciness is apparent throughout the entire dish.  It's not just an afterthought...it's cooked in so with each bite, you get that delicious flavor and a slow building heat...that I love!  

We also ordered a side of spring rolls that came with a clear and more \"brothy\" version of sweet and sour sauce.  It was not too sweet or too sour...it had a very yummy tang.  The spring rolls were very flavorful and crispy.  

I am really hoping that this place can last.  We need good Thai places out here in Maryvale.  I'm sure to be back and try some other dishes that will take me out of my comfort zone!"}
{"text":"Had the Pad Mamuang Himaphan (#25) and it was Phantastic! Currie was excellent! Small place. Family owned and run. Well done!"}
{"text":"A nice surprise! Food was good. Decore was bad but no biggie. Ordered coconut soup, pad thai, fried rice, and satay...everything was good!"}
{"text":"This food was great here, I had yellow curry with chicken as well as the spring rolls. I took my son and he had beef noodles which I tried as well and it was so good. My sister had a soup her was so fresh and full of flavor,. Definitely going back"}
{"text":"Good for fast food. Small and a little dirty but still cheap"}
{"text":"Omg I love the food here. I go here weekly for the chicken Penang or the pad Thai or the fried rice or any of their wide noodle dishes (can't remember their names). It's amazing food and very sweet Ruby with her wonderful customer service. 
Oh and sometimes I get the chai tea and that's pretty good too. =)"}
{"text":"The food is awesome. Delicious!! We used to drive over to Litchfield for good Thai food, then we found this place and it's just as amazing. My picky son even loved it."}
{"text":"Best Thai I have found in Phx yet! I lived in Thailand for years so I'm quite picky. Great job! Awesome $7 lunch specials and lots to choose from."}
{"text":"Favorite international Asian spot.  This place is so authentic, and amazing you will not be disappointed. It had been a while since the last time we where here as we moved but every time we come back is just as amazing. Love the owners as they always take care of us and always give a little gift to my daughter.  If you have kids they will be more than happy to make you a kitchen broth soup. The Tom yum kah is my favorite with extra chicken.  Don't forget dessert(mango and sticky rice is amazing."}
{"text":"Outstanding food, great prices.  The noodles are cooked perfectly every time.  It's hard to find a noodle stir fry with rice noodles that doesn't disintegrate.  Service is mediocre, but that's probably due to the language barrier.  They bring you top notch food for budget prices and pretty quickly.  If you still complain from that, I don't really know why you go out to eat."}
{"text":"Don't let the location and decor deter you...if you happen to be in the area, stop by for some hot, fresh Thai food.  Based on the yummy chicken panang curry, I had - if they keep this up, this place earns a top spot on my \"hole-in-the-wall but damn good\" list!"}
{"text":"Good food but small portions. the place is rarely packed but add the only Thai place in the area i'm not sure why it isn't more busy. Service is friendly and they provide vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Very good Thai food!! The service was fast and the food was delicious. The lunch specials are cheap and good. I will definitely be back there when I am in town."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with a friend who worked nearby because Thai food is one of my favorites. They had a lunch special going on until 2:30 so we both ordered Pad Thai: I got the tofu and she ordered the chicken. It came with spring rolls, which were in a crescent shape rather than a roll, which is what I'm used to. When I took a bite of it, I noticed the filling wasn't the typical and it had some sort of meat, which I don't eat. I wish they would've said what was in it on the lunch menu (found out by looking on their menu online that it's ground chicken). The pad Thai itself was just okay for me, the egg taste was too strong, though I like eggs in the dish. I'm bummed the rolls weren't vegetarian, that's my main complaint."}
{"text":"It used to be called 75th thai.  Now with new ownership, food and service has improved.  

I visit this place twice a month.  And they haven't disappointed me yet.  Food is always great and Price is fair.  

I recommend anyone looking for simple and tasty thai food in west valley."}
{"text":"The food and service was great. It's a family owned business and we will be returning for there great food."}
{"text":"Best thai in Phoenix !!!! Mom and pop family style! true traditional thai, a true gem !
Never had a bad meal here, pad thai, pad kla plao,pad woon sen, panang, green, yellow and red curries are amazing!!! Truly the best"}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Much better than several other nearby higher priced Thai restaurants. Service is very quick and friendly.  Clean dining area.

The menu is small but everything they make, they do very well.  Overall, excellent experience!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile now noticing it every time I drive by, I just finally worked up the nerve to do it today and all I am asking myself is WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG?! 

Holy Amaze-balls! I didn't go inside I had a pick-up order and someone else picked it up. 

I got the yellow curry lunch special, bang for my buck. It came with white rice, obviously the curry, chicken and a spring roll. I don't even like spring rolls and decided to give this one a chance, delicious!!!"}
{"text":"They are awesome,  food is delicious and I'm addicted with their Tom Kha (Coconut soup)"}
{"text":"Friendly, fast, and delicious food!! My husband had the yellow curry and we shared the pineapple rice. We were shocked at how low the bill was too."}
{"text":"I've tried just about everything on the menu. Everything is top notch here. Not super expensive either. Spices are on point too. I LOVE GOLDEN THAI KITCHEN"}
{"text":"I love their red curry.. but I'm fat and I wish they gave me more of the broth. Anyway, it's still pretty damn appetizing."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai food restaurant . Pad Kee Mao is excellent."}
{"text":"I dont think I've ever gone out of my way to post a review but i LOVE this place. I wish I could give them more stars! The food is amazing and a great portion at a great price. I always get the Pad see ew with tofu (extra spicy) and its literally ready in like 5min and so flavorful. My friend always gets their Pad Thai with tofu and she loves it too. Being a vegetarian I can be picky with my tofu but they cook it to perfection every single time. All the staff is super friendly, funny and super kind. Me and my friend have been coming here for Thai for the last year and so far no other place compares. Golden Thai already has our orders memorized! 
They were recently gone for a wedding for a couple of weeks and when they came back they brought us really cute silk elephant key chains! Like how sweet is that!"}
{"text":"I was working in the area, and it was lunchtime, the locals recommended this Thai restaurant for lunch. I ordered the flat noodles, Pad See Ew because I had been craving it for a month, well, they cooked it really well here! I enjoyed my lunch and if I work in the area again, I would definitely come back to try their other dishes!"}
{"text":"Great food and fast service.  I would definitely eat here again and recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"We decided to try out this thai place due to high rating. The food tastes decent, except for the soup was too sour. They put too much MSG in their food. My body usually does not react easily to MSG. However, after finishing my dinner there, I started feeling dizzy, and remained that state for the whole night. The amount of MSG they put into the soup and curry must be insane. Will never come back."}
{"text":"Love this place! I get pad see ew here atleast once a week. The egg roles are also fantastic! Officially my favorite thai place EVER!"}
{"text":"I love the green curry with shrimp! The spicy heat is perfect and the shrimp are big and cooked just right! Always great food and friendly service! One of my favorite places to grab lunch."}
{"text":"The food is great, very flavorful and delicious.. the only problem I have is that they do not have a more defined menu for ordering out. Because with food this good it's a crime not to offer a more convenient way to place orders for pick up... So that's my only \"but\" if you will.. Despite that, I do love their food.. I'd probably order more often if only it was a bit more easier than trying to dig thru the old paper menu and calling them.. Worth the 20 minute wait  if you do come in and place the order though.. The yellow curry and Thai fried rice are a MUST!.."}
{"text":"This food was amazing. I saw it on yelp and decided to try it out bc of the great reviews. The waitress was super sweet and explained all the different items on the menu for me. I ended up ordering pad new Mao #17 and the red curry. Both were amazing and I can't wait to come back and try new dishes!!"}
{"text":"An accidental golden gem find! Super fast fried rice with shrimp. Really excellent. The wok is really hot here! The waitress was very efficient. I will be back again for a quick meal!"}
{"text":"Some of the best thai ive had! And the prices are not bad at all! Definately will continue to come here!"}
{"text":"My wife and myself were going to the mall and decided to stop here to eat.  This was our first time eating here.  We both ordered the Golden Spicy Fried Rice with Chicken.  My wife selected #3 spice and I chose #7 spice since I like spicy food.  Our meal did not disappoint.  The food is awesome and we will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"What a find we just happened to be close by and we saw the reviews on Yelp. We were not disappointed at all, great food friendly staff and the price was very fair. I have a feeling we will make it a purpose to come to this part of town a little more often."}
{"text":"In love with their thai fried rice w/ veggies! Great vegetarian options & not stingy on the veggies!! Great prices! Great flavors on everything I've tried so far. Definitely one of my to go to spots after work :)"}
{"text":"Wow amazing Thai food! Fresh, cooked to order and outstanding service. Absolutely will visit again."}
{"text":"Absolutely delusios ! Had the red curry chicken and it was the most favorable food I have had. Also had the chicken noodles and oh my, the noodles cooked perfectly! The egg rolls are on the small side only had one  could have used another .. the place is small and a Mom and Pop so not fancy but the food was amazing !"}
