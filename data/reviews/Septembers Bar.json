{"text":"its amazing to find any bar much less a neighborhood bar thats still around after a few years much less 30! I have been coming here for years off and on but this past Saturday was a grand reopening of sorts seeing as septembers never actually closed.  It did however get a new owner after 30 years. It was bittersweet with the regulars,   the new young ones as well having barely discovered the tucked away best or worst kept secret in mesa, and its owner Donna Pilkington to come only to say good bye to The longtime owner and family.  But come to find out all is never lost at September's!  Nights you cant remember maybe, but not neighborhood, home away from home septembers!  It was purchased by a long long time family friends and loyal patron and it looks like September's is here to stay! Its owner and staff really busted some hump sprucing up the place too! From New paint to several (5 at least ) brand new flat screens to offer up the NFL package this season to the awesome custom made pool table felts, just enough was done to improve but not change the vibe of this place!  Still no draft beer, but plenty of specials to make it not matter as much!  They serve bar munchies like hot philly cheese steak sandwiches to pizza. Not gourmet but more then worth it for the taste, convience and price! Its still nice to know no matter how your day, week or even year has been, you can always come home to September's and be welcomed back like family. Thank you Donna P and \"Joe\"for all your years of service and years yet to come. We Love This Bar! 

On a personal note, may you be  giving the angels a good run at Rollin Bones and Bawdy jokes Donna. Just like you always did here on earth! You will be missed! Rest in peace 
Donna Pilkington September 11, 2014."}
{"text":"Occasional obnoxious local but otherwise finest of dive bars ever.  The bartender makes you feel right at home with a smile and is awesome.  Vaping at the bar with $5 worth of your selections from the TouchTunes machine rocks."}
{"text":"I'm kind of blown away... I've never felt more unwelcome by a staff member.... and I'm a good guy!   She was so rude that I left my sister in laws birthday party.   Thanks I guess."}
{"text":"Not a hole-in-the-wall bar.  2 pool tables.  Juke box.  Long bar.  High tables and stools.  Some bikers hang out.  Some retirees.  Some regulars.  Pretty decent crowd and well mixed.

Bartender is friendly and courteous.  Does good pours and keeps the peace."}
{"text":"\"Typical dive bar\" Love it! I came here multiple times during my 3 weeks in Mesa.

You get the usual dive bar types here as well as the cheap beers. $2.50 longnecks when I was in there. 

Something you do need to watch out for though is make sure you don't get overcharged on a busy Friday or Saturday. They gave me my bill and it was over $50 and there is no way I had 20 beers. I asked them for an itemized receipt and they said they couldn't provide one. As long as you don't get ripped off by the girls behind be bar this place is fun.

Karaoke on Fridays and Saturdays!"}
{"text":"Great service from Brenda aka  'B' 
Clean dive bar in Mesa. 
2 for 1 Tuesdays whoot whoot. Not bad for a post work stop. Even the bathrooms are clean. If you shoot pool it's free on Mondays. Decent $4 burger  so glad Google didn't fail me!!!"}
{"text":"First time in today , and it will definitely not be my last ! Tomi is a sweet heart and makes a killer Bloody Mary ! Love this place"}
{"text":"I come to Phoenix for business a few times a year. The nearest watering hole near by my hotel was Septembers. I found more then a place to drink...Excellent service, friendly patrons and great drinks at even greater prices! Jessica the bartender took care of me like a regular and made my night memorable! I will be sure to return on my next visit!"}
{"text":"Typical dive bar, nothing special. Food menu was extremely weak."}
{"text":"terrible service, dingy bar. First and lat time going into this place"}
{"text":"Great little feel-good joint. Lots of locals who appeared to know each other well, but not to the point of being exclusionary to strangers. Good prices and good selection. Even had a food special (looked good) but didn't try as we had eaten elsewhere prior-to. If I lived in Mesa, I'd probably be here at least once a week."}
{"text":"This place is awesome and the staff is really nice & friendly me and my wife will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This is the funkiest, most eclectic neighborhood bar ever. You will see every type of person in this bar. Older, younger, all races, size, shapes behaviors are all nicely blended. They serve regular bar drinks you will find anywhere but they have Karaoke  on Frridays & Saturdays which is my favorite part! You can walk in a stranger and have friends by the end of the night. Its got regulars and new comers nightly. They had a prom night where 90% of the customers came out nicely dressed or funkily nicely dressed and had a blast. It can be chill on some days and other days wall to wall. There is no prediction of the night, until you get there. I love that part as well as much as my inner me would rather only have regulars , now that I'm slowly becoming one. Its a laid back place to go.

Only negative.. Sat nights need a better bartender. The one they have is not great at the job, gets overwhelmed easily and can't focus."}
{"text":"Fun dive bar ! They have pool tables good music and great drinks ! The bartender Tom  and manager Bob were awesome ! Will definitely go back !"}
{"text":"Great bar for day drinking on Saturdays! $3 wells!!! Kayla the bartender is the cooolest"}
{"text":"This place is horrible I was expecting a packed bar because of the football games nope then I prefer a drink and I see 2 dead bugs in my drink out the door I go DONT EVER COME TO THIS PLACE ITS HORRIBLE if I could give it no rating well there you go says it all"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place on the spur of the moment, googled it and found it.  It is the best diving my shoe. It is all clean including the bathroom.
Brenda  is the best"}
{"text":"Since moving back out here and sharing a room with my longtime friend I have become a happy regular.     My roommate hates the place and has spoken ill of it for years.    Then I started hanging out there and dragged him in a few times.    He still is not impressed.   He is an angry Turban Cowboy.    I come home buzzed or at times drunk.    He glares at men and shakes his head in disgust. . 

    They have great Karaoke with Shawn of Rockstar Karaoke.   I have become quite the singer, and you are all encouraged to come out and see me soon.     The bartenders are very friendly and accommodating.    Many times they should cut me off  but they tolerate me."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place you don't need to get dressed up for and $30 will go a long way. Drink prices are more than reasonable and well made. What I found most interesting is there isn't 1 type of group of people. You had hipsters, Middle aged people and a younger college crowd. Everyone gets along and it's very comforting. I don't think I've ever experienced that. Pretty cool. Another thing I would point out is the cleanliness and its modern take on a \"dive bar\". They have flat screens that surround the bar and with all different channels. Phone is about to die? They have USB ports underneath the actual bar and they even loan you a portable phone charger with plug for your apple or android phone if you aren't close to a plug. This is a great neighborhood bar. The bartenders immediately know if you are new and go an I and beyond to make you feel welcome. That's important to me. Don't let the empty plaza fool you, it just shows that this bar has great cliental and customer service to keep it thriving while all the surrounding businesses have failed."}
{"text":"Totally cute hole in the wall aka 'Dive' bar. They have a couple pool tables, and I happened to visit on a Karaoke night which was pretty cool. Definitely not a bar you need to get all dazzled up for but if you're looking for a 'lax spot, to grab a drink and hang out with a pretty chill crowd, then Septembers may be your bar. 

I overheard them say they have Bingo nights as well... so it stay pretty active and keeps you entertained and they have a pretty wide selection of alcohol, so don't stray bc you don't think they can deliver when it comes to drinks, cause that's far from the truth!"}
{"text":"Great little local bar. Nice and quiet with free pool on Monday nights. Great friendly bartenders and locals. Awesome atmosphere. We will most definietly be back."}
{"text":"This bar is awesome! If you have gone here more than once, the bartenders remember your name. They're all really friendly, the drinks are inexpensive, and there's a bunch of types of entertainment: from karaoke, darts & pool tables. Sometimes the regulars put on a put luck or a chili cook off. The best part is they have a \"designated driver\" ready to take you home for free on Friday and Saturdays... although you need to tip the driver (obviously). It's definitely a hole-in-the-wall type of bar. It's a tiny area in a strip mall, so it's easy to miss. Almost all of the patrons are regulars too. The only downfall: limited drunken munchies. There's no food available, that I know of."}
{"text":"Being from out of town and not knowing any this was a great friendly place to go everyone was great no attitudes, Brenda the bartender done an excellent job keeping up with the drinks and everything was reasonable prices. If you are just looking for a place to have a couple drinks are spend the evening shooting pool this is a good place."}
{"text":"Everyone there is super friendly and the drinks aren't pricey! Seemed like the bartenders were understaffed and the karaoke options weren't great but overall had a good time!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! The staff is incredibly friendly, the drinks are cheap, and they have both pool tables AND a dart board. Plus the clientele is friendly. Check it out when you're in the area."}
{"text":"This is a great little bar. It's one of those places where everyone knows each other's name. Very friendly atmosphere. Pool tables are well kept and they even have a few arcade games. Karaoke host was very accommodating. My husband and I will definitely be returning to this spot."}
{"text":"I don't care who you are, this is great dive bar. I showed up during karaoke night and it was fine. The bar tender was mad chill and very lid back. They do have food there and the regulars here seem like a lot of fun. Everyone knew each other so I could tell they came here a lot. It's a dive bar so if you give it less than 5 stars then you don't know he true definition of a dive bar."}
{"text":"Fantastic place!  The staff are extremely friendly, and the atmosphere is inviting! Absolutely a great place to come if youre looking for a local place to drop in after work or on the weekends for a drink. Not too crowded or loud and a great place to shoot a game of pool! Definitely glad i decided to drop in!"}
{"text":"Fantastic neighborhood bar! Morgan, a bartender, is flawless. New TV's and a new owner have done some justice. Same low prices, low key atmosphere, and colorful local clientele make it a great destination. From the small/dive bar connoisseur, I highly recommend it. Someone is usually around to sell homemade beef jerky, and the jukebox isn't overridden. Love it."}
