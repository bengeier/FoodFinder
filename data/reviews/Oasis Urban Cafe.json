{"text":"I only really go here in desperation. I once got a mocha made without espresso (just a hot chocolate, then, right?) and incredibly burnt milk. When the steamer is screaming, you're doing something wrong.  The only good thing I've gotten here is the deluxe falafel wrap, though I feel like \"deluxe\" is a stretch. The roast beef sandwich was highly questionable. The meat was soggy and as I watched the sandwich being prepared, I saw a tub of what was maybe tomatoes floating and soggy. The employee then cornered the tomatoes and sloshed the liquid out, shaking the tomatoes to get rid of more liquid. I really worry about food handling and storage here...  I'll probably only come back for pre-packaged items like chips and sodas just to be safe."}
{"text":"This place rocks!! I was visiting from Mississippi and we were looking for something different for lunch. Discovered this gem in downtown Cleveland. The angus beef wrap knocked it out of the park!! Extremely good, and very reasonably priced! Found a new place!!!  Returned during our visit at Thanksgiving. Awesome food, great prices, phenomenal service!!!"}
{"text":"The oasis an off name for a deli but hey it works. Reason one the soup it is very refreshing so much so people are going to love it in the wintertime. The second time I went I tried the Asian wrap and it was so good and a really decent size. The prices are fair as well."}
{"text":"Loving Mediterranean food. I gave it a shot. Good variety. Good prices. But food amount could be greater. Excellent vegetarian options, again food amount could be greater.  Time of service, excellent. Plenty of side dish and snack options.  Food taste, sorry...if you love Mediterranean cuisine e, this is just Meh.  I would walk a couple blocks to Cedarland Express on 12th and Superior."}
