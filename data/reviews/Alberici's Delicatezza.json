{"text":"If you are looking for great food this is the place to go.  All of the items are made fresh and in store.  This is the only place I have had an eggplant sandwich this good.  They have many items you can take home  for supper.  The next time we have a party I will be ordering trays."}
{"text":"How sad that the only place in town with four stars had to go out of business.  I can't tell you how much I will miss it."}
