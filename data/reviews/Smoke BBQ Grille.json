{"text":"Help me kick my Friday night off right. Walked through the door to a comfortable atmosphere. Greater by a wonderful waitress and not rushed to place our order as we enjoyed a meticulously made Old Fashion and a house refused peach martini. As our drinks soothed our pallet we were served an appetizer of burnt ends with Korean BBQ sauce and BBQ slaw. These delicious bite size morsels melted in my mouth and served as a nice prelude to the enjoyment to come.  The brisket was recommended and served with BBQ corn with an infused BBQ butter along side on some creamy and lite macaroni and cheese. The meat was full of flavor and so tender that it dissolved in our mouths. I enjoyed the Friday night prime rib with loaded baked potato. The a 12 ounce piece of meat the portion seemed huge. The flavor was filled with the effort you would expect in a slow smoked prime rib. Once we finished our meal we slow rolled next store to enjoy a movie. That is how you end a stressful week. Thank you."}
{"text":"Service was good. But, meal was a bit disappointing.  Was expecting a little more of a charred or smokey flavor.  Maybe we went too soon after its opening. Will give it another go."}
{"text":"It was our first time at Smoke Modern BBQ. Great experience! We started at the bar with a great Bourbon list and a Very Knowledgeable Bartender named Kevin. Our friends joined us and the 4 of us sat for dinner, each getting something different so we could try several dishes. Our server was Zach and he was very familiar with the menu and all the different sauces,so he certainly steered us the the right direction.The service we received was AWESOME, and the atmosphere is wonderful! 
We will certainly be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, quick friendly service. $1 ribs every night from 4-7 were awesome, will go back for that for sure!!  We had wings and ribs as an appetizer they were both great and would go back just for them.  Was a little disappointed with the burnt ends, meat was good but the Korean BBQ sauce was underwhelming, KC royale is the way to go on that. Also Mac and cheese wasn't super flavorful but the veggies and sweet potato fries were very good.

Will go back!"}
{"text":"Everything was really good. The smoke burned bits were really excellent. The Korean sauce on those was the topper.  Our service is exceptionally slow though, otherwise this would've been a five star review. Philly mac & cheese is the best mac & cheese on the menu."}
{"text":"What a great addition to Stonecrest. The food was delicious and the service was great! I loved the Shrimp and Grits. The Mac and Cheese with Burnt Ends is to die for. My husband loved the brisket and short ribs. We will definitely be regulars."}
{"text":"This place is so good I have gone multiple days In a row numerous times.  Burnt Ends, Mac and Cheese wings with Korean bbq killed"}
{"text":"Visiting a friend and stopped by for lunch. We shared a bunch of starters and everything was delicious. The pulled pork mac and cheese and burnt ends were my favorites. Then we had the banana pudding and it was amazing. Plus a good selection of local craft beer. The staff was great and the restaurant was really nice. Would definitely come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Tried this location for the first time last night. Waited about 15 minutes for a table, but was OK with this since it was a Friday night. After being seated, the waiter came right over and took my order. I ordered the two meat combo (ribs and brisket) with 2 sides: a baked potato and creamed spinach. After a 20 minute, wait the waiter came over and apologized for the wait, saying that the kitchen was backlogged with orders. I have never heard this excuse before in any restaurant in which I've eaten, in in Charlotte or anywhere else for that matter, If the kitchen can't keep up with the orders, something is wrong somewhere.

First, the food. I got 5 ribs, which were baby ribs, not full size. They were good, but stuck together so getting them apart was a real chore. The brisket, about 5 pieces, was dry and two of the pieces were pure fat. The sides were excellent. The service was fine.

The place itself is very attractive, but the noise level is ear-splitting. To make it worse, they have loud music playing in the background. I don't think I'll be returning.

You want great barbeque: Dickey's. It's mostly take out, but the ribs are full-sized and the brisket is really lean and delicious."}
{"text":"The BBQ here is a bit average. To be told which wines compliment a specific type of BBQ felt a bit off to me.  The sides were much better than the brisket... and I would go back just for the sides, but there is way better BBQ, and at a more fair price, at different places in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"The food was very good and the service was great. The smoked beef brisket was good but a little dry. Almost as good as brisket in texas. The star was the mac & cheese with burnt ends. That by itself is worth through trip."}
{"text":"Went here on spur of the moment and kinda regret it. My wife liked the grilled cheese with pulled pork ok. I had shrimp&sausage Mac n cheese. It was bad  and the shrimp had no flavor. I left a vast majority in the bowl. Service was friendly but slow, especially since there were only two other couples at the time. I don't plan to return."}
{"text":"Had the BBQ plate, was tasty and their XXX hot sauce was flavorful.  The Smoked Slaw was a good mix to make slaw more interesting to eat. Great liquor selection.  Our server was pleasantly sassy, and manager chatted us up, was very friendly.  Still a new place, I look forward to trying another meal there."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate regularly at the Birkdale location which closed suddenly (gasp! tears falling!).  We decided to make the drive to Stonecrest and, boy, are glad we did. It was like seeing your best friend whom you haven't seen in a while because she moved across town. You know and love each other but the house is new. 

Anyhow, my husband got his usual Smokin' Q three meat combo with the brisket, chicken and sausage. For sides he chose the smokin' slaw and tots. I knew he was happy from the first bite when his eyes closed and he got that \"I'm in food heaven \" expression on his face. The portions are large enough that he took some home to enjoy for lunch back at work Monday. 

I took advantage of the Restaurant Week menu and started with the bacon wrapped shrimp with hoisin sauce. Tasty!  You can't go wrong with the prime rib. As per my usual, I requested an end cut and was not disappointed. I'm one of those people who loves the bark just as much as the meat itself so the end cut maximizes both. I chose the mac 'n cheese and smokin' slaw for my sides. The mac 'n cheese over at Mac's is the gold standard for us but Smoke's mac 'n cheese is a strong contender. To ensure I had room for dessert, I also took home half of my meal for my Monday lunch.  Let me just say OMG, the banana pudding with caramel was yummmm-y!  I've never had banana pudding with caramel before and, in fact, never even considered having the two together. This combo is to die for. I'll be making this at home very, very soon!

We're so glad we made the drive to Smoke at Stonecrest.  Great food, great service and great prices. We will definitely be back soon!"}
{"text":"Great experience before a movie. Service and ability to make a reservation very positive. Food great! Prime rib, BBQ chicken, grits, shrimp and grits, burnt ends, fried pickles. All sooo good - we shared!"}
{"text":"Visiting Charlotte- wanted to get some BBQ. Someone recommend Smoke- great recommendation! Great craft beer menu- 
Read other comments about the Burt Ends. Got the Smokin Modern Burnt End app - amazing !
The pulled pork Mac n cheese- yeah!
Great decor and service. Check it out."}
{"text":"Place looks great . Nice bar and very friendly bartender, food was ok it came out cold it tasted ok could have been better if it was worm but just not what I expected  it came with one side that you have to select and a very very very small amount of slaw on the side of plate. It was kinda lost on the pate under the fries. They are new , so may get better. I will try them again in a few months and decide if I am going back or not"}
{"text":"Dinner was good! We were very pleased with the food, quality, and service. The drinks are great! Our favorites were the Smoke Signal and the Maple Bacon. The brisket appetizer in Korean BBQ sauce was great too!"}
{"text":"Went today for lunch, which felt the lunch menu a bit pricey. Had the pulled pork, which comes with 1 side, then an ice tea, which was extra too..  Then had dessert. We had no mixed drinks. But by the time bill came out and paid, it was close to 100 with tip (for lunch).   Overview of food, was good. But to get just two items with a \"plate\" meal was disappointing there should have been some type of bread, may it have been hush puppies or something. But choices were slaw, mac n cheese, beans, fries, etc.  Staff was good, no complaints there.  Would we go back, probably not."}
{"text":"I would go back again and again just for the Mac-n-cheese. The fried pickles we had for a starter were really good and I love their pulled pork, but all the man-n-cheese variations are my favorite. I frequent the location in Huntersville and was very happy when this location opened near my husbands' workplace. We can meet for lunch every now and again at someplace that we both enjoy."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!! Best BBQ in Charlotte hands down. The flavors in the meat are incredible. The ribs are perfectly cooked. Tender and juicy and still has that slight pull off the bone perfectly cooked ribs should have. The Mac and cheese is heavenly. The baked beans leave you longing for more. They infuse their own liquors and the cocktails are impressive. You will not be disappointed. It may seem pricy to some but you pay for quality. I will be back for sure and recommend anyone to give it a try."}
{"text":"First trip.  

Pro's:
Burnt ends done properly, ribs juicy and delicious with proper amount of pull.   

Cons:
Lean brisket too dry (don't be afraid to send back for another slice
Wings overdone 

Recommend ordering ribs, burnt ends, non lean brisket and Mac n cheese.   Interesting drinks on paper, but execution not there.  

Will try again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch last week, never been. I must say, I was a little disappointed. The server was very nice, but service over all was slow. Not sure if that's because we sat outside or what. I ordered a sandwich and it came with slaw on it. He said he would get me another one without, no problem.  Sandwich was ok, not great. Wife had Mac and cheese, just ok as well.  We were there over an hour total. People on our left and right that came after us had come and gone before we even got our check. And finally when we did get the check, I saw that they had charged me for 2 sandwiches. If they would have told me they were going to charge me twice, I would have just scraped the slaw off the original sandwich. Also, the bill showed we were charged for some cornbread the server had volunteered to bring us. Again, he made no mention of us having to pay for that. Normally they give you some type of bread at a sit down restaurant. There are better bbq places around. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"Went with my husband, father & his wife. Service was OK, food was nothing exceptional, and we were seated in the back! This was around the kitchen, which was exceptionally loud & chaotic. Maybe they should move the bar area to the back, at least people drinking won't mind the noise so much. Spent over $100, all on food, with the exception of 1 beer. Hard earned money with little reward! Won't be visiting again!"}
{"text":"Loved so much about our experience at Smoke. First impression was very good, the decor is very inviting and modern. Our server Josh was exceptional. Very attentive and gave great suggestions. We started with the pulled pork nachos. The portion size was surprising (in a good way) and could've easily fed a table of four. As a table of two, we couldn't stop eating them and as a result, were almost full when our main course arrived. The pulled pork was hands down some of the best I've had. My main course was the salmon with the korean bbq glaze with smashed potatoes and collard greens. All delicious. My husband had the burnt ends with creamed spinach and fries. He was also very pleased with his. We will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"This location is closed. Went today and the doors are shut, everything is boxed up. A few teary-eyed employees were around and confirmed Smoke shut down yesterday (10/30/17). 

1 star simply because Yelp requires a star for a review... not a reflection on the previous business itself."}
{"text":"I have a sneaky feeling that they use that liquid smoke crap to season their meat. The meal I ordered was the brisket with two sides. Unfortunately for me I got two slabs of fat. Sent that back. Got two slabs of old meat with the liquid smoke . Not going back."}
{"text":"I'm very surprised to see the overall rating, based on my dinner experience here recently. The pulled chicken entree and sides were mediocre, service was slow, and value for the money was not good. With far better BBQ available in Ballantyne, I am unlikely to return here."}
{"text":"First time here, party of four for dinner. Tried Mac and cheese with burnt ends and corn muffins for appetizers. Both were incredible, but the corn muffins really exceptional. All had slaw, unanimous about its quality, and between us we had burnt ends, brisket, pulled pork, with agreement that each was some of the best we've ever had. The beans were really interesting. Without being heavy, they were bursting with flavor, complimenting the slaw really well. This is only their fifth night, but the staff was competent and attentive, seemingly (and rightfully) proud of what they had to serve. Minor downside, mixed drinks had to be returned for wine, too sour, obviously the bar needs a little work. You will not regret trying this place, can't go wrong with any of the food. It is noisy, so expect to have to shout, but hey, it's a BBQ joint (but elevated)!!"}
{"text":"We had 7 people. We had a variety of items. Appetizers..fried pickles, deviled eggs and quesadilla. All were excellent. Meals. Burger was ok, ribs were very good but not falling off the bone kind. Bbq chicken breast and pork pull were all super. Sides were all good although the collards were salty and spicy. Atmosphere was very nice. It was too cold in there but they were accomodating."}
{"text":"Enjoyed our first trip, very good food, brisket was extremely juicy. Smoked sausage excellent, so was the pork. Nice cocktails and solid tap list. Wife loved the pineapple Martini."}
{"text":"My wife and I have gone to Smoke Modern Barbeque on two different occassions. Walking in it looks incredibly nice and inviting. On both of our visits we waited at the bar for a table and ordered drinks. The first time we ordered a couple of Martines and the last time 2 guinesses. The bartender that happen to wait on us on both occasions does not know how to pour a Guinness , nor can he make a martini. 

We didn't even try the food. It was busy with a long wait and we didn't want to continue to ask for drinks to be remade."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this place.  That was some really good BBQ. The service was awesome as well."}
{"text":"I am a BBQ nerd. This place was highly welcome in the Ballantyne neighborhood, and the service was great. But ultimately, the food disappointed and lived short of the \"modern\" BBQ idea.
Much prefer classic BBQ joints in the area like Midwood Smokehouse to here. I´ll tell you why:

-The chef has a problem with overseasoning to compensate for natural flavors. Fried Pickles and the creamed spinach was way too salty.
-The BBQ chicken didnt taste like itd been properly smoked, or was a few days old. Very dry. Almost like itd been just a cheap chicken stripped and mixed with BBQ sauce.
-I love burnt ends. But there wasnt really a good balance in both the places I had em, both the beans and the mac n cheese. The mac n cheese portion is a bit over the top, and don´t really like the choice of cheese. That orangey crap cheese for a modern BBQ joint? Coulda picked a host of others.
-The pork ribs were meh. Lacked punch.

My favorites were: 
-The sauces. The Carolina, Texas and KC were spot on. And nods to all types of BBQ heritage.
-The coleslaw was the right contrast to the heavy sides
-Wine selection kickass
-The brisket was perfect

Understand they´ve only been 4 months open, but being in North Carolina there´s some pretty high standards to follow. A pretentious title like \"modern\" aint really helping. On paper it sounds good - but they need chefs who can really execute envelope-pushing flavors on the plate. If you´re the owners reading this -- not to worry -- you will surely always make a killing on the weekends!"}
{"text":"I've been waiting for Smoke to open in Stonecrest since I saw that Village Tavern had left (yay!) and this new \"upscale modern BBQ\" place was moving in.  I was really hoping that our first experience was going to WOW me.  Sadly, it did not.  

Because of the movie theater nearby, parking for Smoke can be a bitch.  Overflow from the theater takes up the parking area in front of Smoke. After finally finding a space and walking some distance, we arrived at Smoke this past Saturday evening and waited for about 10-15 minutes for a table (when I could see that there were tables open).  Fine.  I understand that sometimes they don't want to overwhelm the servers.  What I don't like, though, is when they do it to try to feel \"exclusive.\"  There were three hostesses and what looked like a manager hanging around the host stand.  Do you really need that many?

Smoke has booths, tables, high-top tables, and bar seating.  We were seated at a high-top in the bar area.  Our server promptly greeted us.  We ordered drinks and they were made and delivered right away.  I tried a Moscow Mule for the first time.  It was delicious and came in the traditional copper mug (although I found it strange that it didn't have a lime and/or mint sprig in it, like I've always seen).  

We ordered the fried pickles appetizer and two orders of the Smoked Pulled Pork.  I went to use the restroom soon after ordering, and when I came out, our meals had already been delivered!  It was super quick!  But...where was the fried pickles appetizer?  And why did the person delivering the food call one brisket and the other pork?  Neither was brisket.  Can't the employees tell the difference between their products?

The Smoked BBQ Plates come with two sides.  I tried the mac & cheese and the creamed spinach.  Both were fantastic.  The mac & cheese was so flavorful (I wished I had ordered one of the mac & cheese entrees) and the creamed spinach wasn't overly creamy; it was just right.  However, the main attraction, the BBQ pork, left something to be desired.  It tasted rubbery, almost like chicken (maybe it was?!), wasn't shredded much (like every other BBQ place does), and was lukewarm in temperature (hence, the quick delivery) compared to the fresh, hot side dishes.  For $15, I expected a lot better. 

We didn't see our server much after the food was delivered, and never did see the fried pickles.  Fortunately, it wasn't on the check, but, seriously...WTF?  The restaurant wasn't that busy.  It then took too long to get our check and then pay for it because we rarely saw our server after she took (and screwed up) our orders.  

Will we go back?  Possibly.  I'd like to try one of the mac & cheese entrees, since they seemed to do that right.  As for BBQ?  Rubbery, non-shredded, lukewarm BBQ (that may or may not be chicken)?  No, thanks.  With Mac's Speedshop and Midwood Smokehouse offering better BBQ at lower prices, why pay more for less quality?"}
{"text":"To be very honest, I had high hopes for this place to be good. But, my wife and I gave it a shot. We ordered two bbq plates and some drinks. The service is slow and sloppy. Our meals came out COLD. They took it back and gave us new ones. Even with it being hot, it was just brutal and horrible. And, to boot! The manager didn't take 10 cents off the bill. If I could give this place less than one star? I WOULD! Beware"}
{"text":"Meh. Midwood smokehouse @ Ballantyne is much better.  The burnt ends were tough and flabby.  Server was nice."}
{"text":"We were a little scared based on the mixed reviews but we will be back for sure!! I've been to several BBQ joints around town, Midwood, Lancasters, 521 to name a few...this place has the best burnt ends around!! Must try...we had them Korean style and Kansas style and both amazing!!!..if you're looking for traditional BBQ you may be disappointed...
Tried the pulled pork and ribs, which weren't bad, but any of the places I named above are significantly better...we decided to have the burnt ends Mac and Cheese (1$ up charge)...which was absolute heaven...garlic mash very good as our sides
Nice setting, great service, good drink specials....not the best BBQ joint around...but best Burnt ends I have had and the sides are just as good...next time I'll try the brisket!"}
{"text":"The service was great. My favorite app so far is the bacon wrapped shrimp. The slaw is so delicious it could work as a main dish. Never had anything like it. The portions are very good size. Try the collards they really surprised me. So flavorful. I didn't have the mac and cheese but others in my party loved it. I wonder why they don't serve cornbread. That would get them 5 stars from me. On my next visit to Charlotte, I'll try the shrimp and grits. Can't wait."}
{"text":"This place was really good. I ordered the pulled pork platter with sweet potato fries and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was great!!! We also ordered the corn muffins and they were great. I would definitely come back to this place"}
{"text":"We used Smoke Modern for our wedding catering in May and they were nothing short of AMAZING!! First off, the food is out of this world and all of our guests reiterated that fact to us afterwards. Second, the service is top-notch and they really cared about making our wedding day the best day possible. When our wedding planner stopped doing her job, SM even took over her duties. The GM, head chef, and event coordinator were all there on our wedding day. They were professional, efficient, and downright wonderful to work with. I told my husband at one point I wish all our wedding vendors were as great as our caterers. We HIGHLY recommend Smoke Modern to anyone wanting BBQ catering for their wedding!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our visit here! We are true southerners that love a good bbq so we were hesitant to give this place a try. I'm glad we did though! I got the pulled bbq sandwich and my fiancé got the brisket plate. We also got the mac-n-cheese, baked beans, cheesy grits, and tater tots all for sides. The only thing we didn't like out of the whole meal were the baked beans, the rest was delicious! Their thick and sweet BBQ sauce is awesome, but they have 4 different kinds to choose from if that isn't your style. After the entrées, we got the brownie dessert. If you like \"cakey\" brownies, then you will like it. We like \"fudgey\" brownies, so it wasn't our favorite. Our waitress was very attentive and kind. Make sure you try this spot! We will return!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice and really enjoyed myself. The staff was attentive and friendly. Neat drink options. Love love the mac n cheese. The beef brisket is my favorite. The second visit though it was way too heavy on the smoke flavor. The other meat options are pretty good."}
{"text":"The beef brisket was very tender, moist and full of flavor.  The creamed spinach was spicy, but I like spicy and it was different. I would have given more stars, but the service was terrible.  Our server/order taker was nowhere to be found after she brought our drinks. Someone else brought our food to the table, which is not unusual, but no one stopped by to check on us until we were finished with the meal.  We were never offer more drinks or dessert.  I guess they're making too much money here and don't need my business."}
{"text":"The atmosphere to the service and most importantly the food... 5 stars. I was skeptical about \"gourmet BBQ\" in general but man was the food good. I highly recommend anything on the menu. Plenty of seats and quick service! Definitely will be back!!"}
{"text":"My friend suggested we go here because it was new- what a surprise! I'm surprised there isn't more traffic coming through! I don't usually write reviews, but I think this restaurant deserves more attention. Did portions are large, next time I will probably split entrees and eat family style. Love their version of Old Fashion!"}
{"text":"My husband and I love to split the 3 or 4 meat combination! The brisket is our favorite with garlic mashed potato and creamed spinach. The second vice is fantastic and fast. The servers we have had were spot on for recommendations too."}
{"text":"Very well-run place!  Meaty & lean smoked ribs, some of the best we've ever had.  Nice atmosphere."}
{"text":"We were really excited about this new restaurant and even waited a month so they could work the kinks out. What a disappointment. Our pulled pork sandwich was very dry and the bun for our burger was soaked in grease - the fries were not seasoned and cold. The wait staff never came over to see how our food was. Save yourself some money and go to Burger21 in Ballantyne."}
{"text":"I picked up takeout at Smoke BBQ grill tonight. Absolutely fantastic! I highly recommend this restaurant. The staff is friendly and the food is delicious"}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite restaurants! Located on the corner in stonecrest, they have THE best brisket mac and cheese! Also, on Fridays and Saturdays they have Prime Rib! So delish!"}
{"text":"This place was really good! Great baked beans and slaw, both a testament to a great bbq place. I tried the three meat plate with pulled pork, pulled chicken, and brisket. All three were amazing! The KC Royal sweet sauce is my favorite and it works on any kind of meat! Talented bartender and great server really rounded out the experience. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Decided to give Smoke a try the other night and wasn't thrilled. Once it was time to order they told us they were out of pulled pork and almost out of brisket.  Since it is a BBQ restaurant I feel like that should have been mentioned once we arrived.  I settled for pulled chicken since there was no pulled pork and it was pretty good, although it definitely could've been warmer.  The mac and cheese was fine, but nothing special, the mashed potatoes were good and the baked beans tasted very strange.  The atmosphere was nice but there are too many other good BBQ places around to settle, especially with the higher prices."}
{"text":"Went for lunch for the first time with some coworkers. Mediocre everything is an accurate summary. You want GREAT BBQ? Go to Midwood or Mac's Speed Shop. Much better sides and meats. Overpriced because of location and a little sluggish service. This is BBQ for people who aren't really sure what real BBQ is and just want a swanky, modern restaurant to eat at. 3 stars at best."}
{"text":"Service was great and food did not disappoint. We'll be back. No long wait as we typically experience when trying to go out to dinner on Friday evening. came here because our first choice had 45minute wait."}
{"text":"I would love to review Smoke, however we walked out after waiting for over 20 minutes on a \"no more than 10 minutes TOP\" as we watched a table of 8 with no reservation who came in AFTER us get seated, and another table of two who just resorted to sitting themselves. Did I mention there were seven open tables? Seven. This place didn't deserve our business after that. We won't be back."}
{"text":"What a great addition to Stonecrest. The food is awesome. I had The smoked sausage, and my wife had the brisket. The sauces at the table to go with the smoked meats are incredible. We also had the burnt end macaroni and cheese which was fabulous.Atmosphere is a lot like Firebirds. Very friendly and the wood accents in decorating are great. 
We will be back, and recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"the burnt ends were to die for.  the brioche bun for the angus burger the bottom was a little soggy prob because I took so long to tackle it focusing my efforts on mac & cheese that was literally impossible to put my fork down.  Service was fabulous not once did I have to ask for a refill or more water"}
{"text":"I dined here the other night with my family for the first time. Came to try out the restaurant week menu. Definitely a different atmosphere than what I'm used to for BBQ joints. I ordered ribs with a side of fries and baked beans. The backed beans had an overwhelming taste of bbq sauce and I just couldn't get past it after sampling a BBQ sauce infused macaroni and cheese appetizer. While the restaurant is further than I typically would travel, I'd love to try out their brisket next time. They also have a small outdoor enclosed sitting area as wel"}
{"text":"Not as good, too much like mall court food."}
{"text":"My wife and i joked about just what Modern BBQ could be?  Fusion or some other adulteration of southern BBQ?  We entered with trepidation.

And we were wonderfully surprised to find a modern, almost nightclub ambiance, comfortable and easy on the eyes.  Hostess seated, we met a very fine Bahamian waiter, Sanfred.  In his soft accent he described the menu, answered our questions and returned shortly to take our order.

The menu had the standard chicken, pulled pork, ribs, beef brisket & sausage meats and then a nice selection of sandwiches, salads, appetizers and sides.  Good job and the descriptions were excellent.

Iced tea was served in glasses and refilled via a fresh glass...rather than the splashing, ice filled pitchers more commonly found in other BBQ places.  And the unsweetened tea did not need sweeteners, well brewed and not bitter.

We split a house salad which was huge.  Doubt if one person could eat a whole salad and with any other main since the salad was so plentiful.  Dressings were all house-made.  Excellent.

Beef brisket, a favorite of ours and not easy to find outside of Texas, was excellent.  If you simply order brisket you will get fatty and lean slices, so specify your preference.  My wife asked for her two fatty slices to be traded for lean and this was accommodated easily.  I ordered a two meat combo of pulled pork and brisket and received a good portion of each.

The pulled pork is without sauce, so you can first taste how savory that smoked meat, tinted with burnt edges truly is.  Then add one of the four sauces on the table:  mustard, vinegar, KC sweet and KC spicy. The spicy was Goldilocks just right for both of us.

Sides included excellent mac & cheese and creamed spinach, along with a cider slaw.  All three were excellent and served in their own small bowls. We brought most of the two sides home as the portions were too much to eat given the salad and meats.

Prices were a bit high, but the quality of the smoking, sides, menu options and generous portions validated the costs.  Our lunch for two was right at $50 and that was with iced tea, no booze.

Nice experience and quality without the mob scene found in surrounding more casual BBQ joints.  Will try more items as time goes on, most likely resulting in a five-star rating."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like it here - I actually gave them four chances - all four times my food came out COLD - not willing to go back again."}
{"text":"As Stonecrest locals, my wife and I were looking forward to this new BBQ joint's opening. It replaced a long time bar and grill which had grown somewhat tired and lackluster over the years. Well that's certainly not the case with Smoke!

It feeds your senses the instant you walk thru the front door. Visually the dining area is striking, slick and expansive. The booths are comfortable and roomy. The aroma of smoked BBQ wafts throughout the entire room and out the front door. The menu is loaded with choices but we made it easy and ordered the combo meat platter for 26 bucks. The brisket was the winner here! Perfect smoke, texture and taste. 

The sides are headed by the Mac 'n Cheese which is very tasty and somewhat smoky. Service was very attentative and sanitation score was high. Everything was pretty pricy however. I would give it another shot but only with coupon."}
{"text":"Service was horrible. Asked to speak to a manager and he never came to the table. Took almost an hour to get our food and it was not even hot. Very disappointed. FYI not kid friendly at all!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Smoke on Rae Road tonight. We sat at the bar and ordered dinner. I ordered the Korean Chicken Salad and my husband ordered the Pulled Chicken sandwich. After 40 minutes we prompted the bartender over and asked him when our dinners would be served. He went and checked and brought them over. He said it was because my husband ordered his fries extra crispy. His sandwich was half the size it was last month and the pulled chicken in my salad was extremely undercooked. I do not recommend this restaurant. They are inconsistent and when I called the manager on my way home he said that the chicken in the salad is served cold and I probably mistook it for undercooked. I told him I couldn't cut it with a knife because it was raw."}
{"text":"I have been raving about Smoke after my first visit but had the complete opposite meal yesterday.
Started with pulled pork nachos that had very little toppings. Ordered sample plate and portions were small. Ribs and pulled pork were on dry side and not much flavor. We were up charged for burnt ends which had 4 small pieces which were all fat and inedible. Even the loaded baked potato was a joke as it had almost no cheese or bacon.
Very disappointing as we loved Smoke the first time and were telling everyone to go. With so many BBQ choices in area(I can think of 8 within 5 miles) I was hoping Smoke would be our spot."}
{"text":"Too many things to list. Over all food was bad. Forgot appetizer. Had to send steak back bc was all fat. Then got charged twice for it. Writing this one off the list"}
{"text":"Excellent food and amazing barbecue nachos. This is a great place for lunch and dinner. We had the beef brisket anchors... excellent"}
{"text":"Delicious! We came in at 5:30 on a Saturday and it was crowded but we got a seat at the bar and ordered cocktails.  We ordered the Brisket sliders, corn bread, and burnt ends. Everything was moist, meaty, and delicious!"}
{"text":"Was excited when saw the signs as construction began at the thought of having a good bbq place close to home.

i've eaten there 4 times now (3 in house and 1 takeout) and have tried most of what they have to offer.

Positive

--Brisket Tips appetizer is the best thing on the menu.
--Deviled eggs are the best in the area
--Smoked pulled pork and chicken are above average
--Macaroni and Cheese is very good as well

Negative

--Service is subpar.
--Kitchen is slow.  The wait from order to food is routinely 40 mins which is slow for even a white table cloth restaurant. It's atrocious for BBQ.
--Vastly overpriced ($20 per person average over those 4 meals).
--Rest of the menu -- sausage, chicken, salads,etc -- received a \"meh\" rating from clients and family.
--Brisket was overdone on all 4 visits (head to Mac's Texan transplants).


Overall this is not a place I'll be visiting regularly.  If the service was even minimally better and the price more in line with local BBQ places I might stop by for convenience sake.   Unfortunately that is just not the case.  

For brisket I'll continue driving the extra 15 mins to get to Mac's.  For pulled pork I'll drive the extra 5 mins for Q Shack.   Both offer better food, service and value for the 28277 area.  They also are closer to the \"neighborhood\" joint that the Smoke owners were shooting for."}
{"text":"Without a doubt, this is by far THE best brisket east of Texas. We have eaten here at least 6 times and are always reminded why we love it when we take that first bite of fatty brisket!! The slaw is great, grits were tasty and let's talk about that corn muffin and butter! Crazy good! This is by far my favorite restaurant in Charlotte (next to Ruth Chris). Go here! You won't be dissappointed."}
{"text":"This is definitely a more high scale BBQ place compared to some others in the south. The food was delicious, in particular the meat. The sides were okay, nothing out of this world. The service was a bit slow, not sure if this is a southern thing, but it took forever to take our drinks order and what not.

Our only complaint was that we wanted to sit in a booth but were told that they were for \"reservations\" only and had no choice but to sit on the high table/chair area. This was frustrating because it's not the most comfortable seating and the whole time we were at the restaurant, all of the booths stayed empty.. not sure why they couldn't let us eat comfortably in a booth!"}
{"text":"Holy Pig. Devilish eggs...way better than the norm. Fresh and not soggy with a wedge of bacon in each 1/2. The. We the hubby and I got 1/2 salads each. HUGE with like a pack of bacon each. I have TMD so I had to tap out 1/4 of the way through. However, I think my Hubbys eyes rolled into the back of his head a few times. Then the main plates came . I had a loaded baked potato (not spectacular but better than good) slaw (meh), heavenly tender brisket with that beautiful bark, and flavorful delicious pulled pork. The sauces on the table really weren't necessary. We were too happy to enjoy the actual smoked flavors. The hubby had Mac n cheese (I could not keep my fork out of that it was so amazing) mashed potatoes (just a notch below Ruth's Chris grade mashed potatoes), ribs (small but tender and succulent) and pulled smoked chicken (good but not great). We ate and ate for about $55. Family of 4 but the 2 little ones are 10 months and almost 3 years old so they don't eat much. But we had 1 full carry out container of leftovers. The service was amazing. Friendly and quick! We will be"}
{"text":"I am always excited to see new BBQ places open in the barren BBQ wasteland that is Charlotte. For a city so close to Lexington, Charlotte really should have better BBQ, but I digress.

Smoke is your typical non-traditional (read: non-authentic) BBQ place. For an average of around $15 per plate, you get your choice of several types of meats and sides. The food overall is good, and I would return, but if you are looking for authentic NC BBQ, Smoke is not the place. But, I assume that's what they're going for (hence the \"modern\" part of their name).

SERVICE: I wanted to start off with service because it was terrible. We were seated by the hostess and waited at least five minutes before a server helped us. The wait for our food was also a bit more than usual. Service during our meal was no better. Smoke, I suggest you hire more servers or train your existing ones properly.

FOOD: Smoke serves a variety of meats and sides. While not authentic NC BBQ, the food was surprisingly good. For some reason, most BBQ places in Charlotte are pretty bad. Smoke is definitely an exception to that. I ordered a combo of pulled pork and brisket with sides of mac 'n' cheese and sweet potato fries. The pork and brisket were smoked well and quite juicy. The sides were very over-salted, however. Smoke has several BBQ sauces on each table that were all rather bland. Smoke serves one BBQ sauce called \"Georgia Gold\", which is a pretty interesting name considering that Georgia has no BBQ style. Mustard (\"gold\") BBQ sauce is from South Carolina, not Georgia. Smoke, if you call yourself a BBQ place, you should know this.

PRICE: Overall, the prices are in line with other similar BBQ places. Expect to pay about $15 per plate.


I enjoyed Smoke and will return. If they would improve their service, Smoke would definitely be a much better restaurant. One key point to note: make sure to make a reservation. Smoke has limited seating and gets busy on weekends."}
{"text":"Was not thrilled with any of the meat served.  Burnt ends were mostly fat.   The meat they put on my salad as an add on, was not good.   mac and cheese was not great.    Won't be back."}
{"text":"I gave them one because I didn't suck .. but it sure was bla. Average BBQ no smoke flavor tan and old looking meat. When you have to ADD BBQ sauce for flavor that's not good. Should have know better from the fancy look of place, and no aroma for Smoke BBQ .. do yourself a favor and if you want BBQ in the area go to Moes BBQ in Matthews. This is over priced to pay rent .. meh"}
{"text":"Stopped in here after seeing a flick. Just on a whim due to being so freaking hungry. The food was excellent. I ordered the salmon. Cooked perfectly and got a double order of seasonal veggies for my sides. Paired that with a Birdsong Jalapeno pale ale....heaven! The service was standard. Nothing really to write home about on that."}
{"text":"Did not care for their food at all!! Very dry.   I might try again since I see so many other good reviews."}
{"text":"Let's talk about Smoke, baby... 
Let's talk about sweet chile... 
Let's talk about Korean Chicken BBQ, and the good beer that we see.... 

Heh. Heh. Heh. See what I did there? 

Seriously though, lets talk about it. I came in here for lunch today, I had mac & cheese on my mind - but then because this is North Carolina - it was 10,000 degrees outside, and I started to reconsider. I've had the mac & cheese here before, and it was really good, but this heat is just too much for warm cheese/noodles/carb/food coma. So I sat down at the bar and was greeted by Art. He is super friendly, welcoming, and helpful. I told him about my mac & cheese/heat dilemma and that I was now thinking about a beer and a salad (obviously, they go together.). They have White Street Kolsch on tap, local beer, perfect for this weather. I ordered a Kolsch, and started thinking about what to put on top of the Caesar salad.... Then Art looked at me, and suggested the Korean Chicken BBQ Salad. 

*long dramatic pause here*

I grabbed the description off of the website for you, \"Mixed greens, tomatoes, corn, sesame seeds and chow mein noodles tossed in a sweet chile dressing and topped with pulled chicken drizzled with Korean BBQ sauce\" AND ITS AMAZING. When it came out, everything is cold, fresh and delicious. The sauces are just right, not dry but not drenched either. The chicken was done really well and filling - so I took some of it home! For real. Like took enough home to have dinner, and if you've been following me - you know that eating is definitely a talent of mine, take home food is rare. Excellent, large portions. 

This salad is my new lunch favorite. When it's not a million degrees outside, I'll probably still get mac & cheese, but I was really glad that I tried this today. 

Smoke is a great place to grab a delicious lunch for a fair price, or to take a nice date. Dress it up, or dress it down - it's tasty, and on my side of town. Winning!"}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed, the bbq had no flavor and the sauces didn't help. We don't plan to go again."}
{"text":"I wasn't too impressed with Smoke. We went for lunch and got the pulled pork plate as well as the pulled chicken sandwich. My pulled pork came out cold and the sandwich was only warm. The waiter did not hesitate to bring me another plate of pork however it was only slightly warm. I will say the Mac and cheese was the best I've ever had. The wait staff has some improving to do. I get that there are points during the day where it is slower but we witnessed many servers/hostesses sitting, gathered at the door, and on their phones. It just gives a very unprofessional feel. Overall nothing was horrible, but nothing was great either(besides the Mac and cheese)."}
{"text":"Went for an early Valentine date on a Thursday.  I had the smoked chicken,brisket combo with mac&cheese. My husband tried the ribs dry rub & sauced with creamed spinach and mac&cheese.  Both were tasty.  The sauces selection on the table hit all of the usual corners of bbq styles.  Mac&cheese was creamy,creamed spinach was great. Loved the garlicky note. All of our meat selections were very tasty,although the chicken was dry. Our server John was fantastic.  We were never waiting for drink refills and his recommendations were on point. The devil eggs,Yum! Loved the warm brownie sundaethe banana pudding not so much. All in all a great meal with excellent service in a clean and attractive atmosphere.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Fun resteraunt with some pretty good barbeque. I got the shrimp and grits, which was made with sausage, peppers and onions. They also added a salsa to mix, which gave an odd sweet/spicy flavor to the cheesy grits. 

I also tried the burnt ends, which were very good. Cooked with just enough sauce, and a melt in your mouth texture. 

The service was very fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Our family came here for Mother's Day s and had a reservation for 1:00PM. I arrived at 12:45PM to check is in and was told a table would be ready in a few minutes. We waited until about 1:10/1:15PM before we were seated at a table that had been set up and waiting since I arrived. It was also set up for 8 people, not the 11 our reservation was originally made for. They were only about 1/2 full at this time. 
We finally got our food around 2:05PM (they were less than half full at this point) and it was average. I was so hungry at this point, I would have eaten my napkin. 
I got the Philly Cheesesteak with a gluten free bun. The bun was really good, but the cheese, onions, and meat in between were dry and bland. I had to substitute normal cheese for the queso, because the queso has gluten in it. I hope this is what caused things to be on the dry side. 
Our server was fine and provided average service with no mistakes."}
{"text":"I visited this location 11/18/15.  The place is beautiful.  No Happy Hour and overpriced.  Whatever you do don't order the beef brisket too much fat on the meat."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this restaurant but left feeling disappointed. Here are some of the positives: the atmosphere is very modern (like the name) and the location in Stonecrest is great, too. The staff is friendly and efficient. The wait for food was average for a busy Saturday night. My Moscow Mule hit the spot and was very refreshing. The food itself is what left something to be desired. The loaded nachos appetizer was excellent but everything went downhill from there. I ordered the combo plate with beef brisket and pork spareribs. I also ordered a side of mac and cheese, creamed spinach, and the smokin slaw. The food was so incredibly salty that it was hard to eat. It wasn't just me, everybody at my table thought so, too. I ended up taking more than half of my food home because the portions are big. I wouldn't have cared so much if I hadn't spent $80 for the meal between my husband and myself. This is probably a fine restaurant for lunch. The sandwiches and salads looked interesting (Cubano anyone?). Hopefully they are less salty and more delicious. Final analysis: with a little tweaking of the food, this place could be great!"}
{"text":"Finally stopped by after seeing this new restaurant for a few months. Came in for lunch, we loved the ambiance and the hostesses were great. Beautiful bar and restaurant, saw some really cool looking drinks around, we will definitely come back to try the drinks and dinner. Everything on the menu looked great, I finally decided on the grilled cheese and Bbq sandwich with Mac and cheese on the side. It was an amazing cheesy-goodness experience. Our waitress was awesome and gave us honest opinions on the menu. Will definitely be back, Mac and cheese was steamy hot and delicious. Great place if you want to feel a little fancy while nomming delicious pulled meat."}
{"text":"Went for dinner tonight. Had the ahi tuna salad was very good and the tuna was cooked perfectly. 
But the highlight of the meal was the banana pudding ! Highly recommend .. It was yummy ! 
Portions were all generous and my husband liked his bbq chicken sandwich - was more smokey than sweet Bbq which he preferred."}
{"text":"The brisket was quite good but needed a bit more seasoning. The St. Louis ribs which were described as dry rubbed were very thin, less than a 3 oz portion and extremely dry. I received two different types of slaw , both very small portions on my plate, one had three strips of tortilla in it, but no tomato or pepitas. My wife received the generous portion of the Mac and cheese which was hot but lacked flavor.  The only modern aspects of this restaurant; the decor, the high prices, and the modern petite portions."}
{"text":"Five stars for their BBQ chicken salad minus the corn chips. One of my favorite salads of all time."}
{"text":"I especially enjoy barbecue cuisine so my dining mate and I decided to try Smoke for lunch. Nice atmosphere, friendly? staff. The menu with burgers, salads, sandwiches, mac and cheese combos, and of course chicken, pork and beef bbq. Alcohol and beer also.
My dining mate ordered the pulled chicken with fries. I ordered half of a smoked chicken with the slaw and sweet potato fries. All came out hot and nicely plated. My dining mate enjoyed his sandwich. My smoked chicken was tender and with smoke flavor throughout. The smoking slaw was not my favorite but my dining mate thought it very tasty. It was mayo based with crunchy toasted tortilla strips,  and pepito seeds. My sweet potato fries very good.
During our meal different employees came to our table to see if we needed anything and asked how we enjoyed our meal.
I saw what others ordered for lunch and all looked good.
Different bbq sauces at the table. I tried all  and they were all tasty and different. So  tasty food, good portions and reasonable prices will bring us back again to try something else from the menu."}
{"text":"Very delicious food with huge portions. I'm from Lexington, NC, and am very picky about barbecue, but I love the food at Smoke. The cocktails are great, too."}
{"text":"Lunch-$83
This was my families second time here. The first was a disgrace; it was there \"soft opening\" so we gave them the benefit to work out the kinks and it was on the house.
We just ate lunch here at least a month afterwards  and it actually got worse. My wife ordered a salad that arrived at the same time as the meal. My entire entree was cold, not cool, cold. The baked beans could have been scraped from my plate and used to help refrigerate other food. The \"manager\" replaced them with microwaved substitute beans; no apology, no concern what so ever. It seemed as thought the entire staff was most interested in watching the Panthers game instead of working, including the frequent stops by our bean manager to catch the latest highlights with the rest of his staff. As we left the hostess was too busy playing in her phone to even so goodbye. 
This place is probably fine for most people. I work too hard for my money to give it to people who are not even pretending to be restaurateurs. The place claims to be an upscale bbq spot. No way. There are tons of better bbq options in Charlotte. So disappointing."}
{"text":"This decent, slightly upscale BBQ restaurant is a good addition to the Stonecrest shopping center, but could benefit from a wider beer selection and better lighting. A dimly lit ambiance is what I expect from a tapas restaurant, not a BBQ joint -- but I guess that's what 'Modern Barbeque' is all about. My order of pulled pork was good, but nothing spectacular, and the massive bowl of Burned End Mac & Cheese was a little underwhelming. I'm hoping Smoke improves as time goes on, because South Charlotte could really use a great BBQ restaurant -- but for the time being, I'll stick with Midwood and Mac's."}
{"text":"By far the best BBQ in Charlotte! This paired up with Midwood smokehouse, nothing beats it. Amazing atmosphere, great staff and great food. You seriously can't pick a bad item on the menu. The Mac and cheese is made in house fresh every day. Meats smoked in house. Try this place, you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Yum yummy in my tummy! Ordered vodka & soda - tasted great but weak as heck. Had the rib eye - perfection. Mac & cheese - heaven - creamy, cheesy and served piping hot with a burnt crust. Baked potato - huge. Also had appetizer of onion rings - cooked well but the garlic ranch was just plain old ranch. Would be 5 stars but I had 3 drinks and I wasn't even giggly and I rarely drink. Now I can't speak for my husband but he ordered the chicken and pork double entree - why no corn bread? Stingy! That cheapened the dish for me, they have corn bread as an appetizer but didn't include it with the meal. Oh and the bathroom is really dark, I like to be able to check my teeth in the proper lighting."}
{"text":"It's BBQ - so I couldn't eat it more than once or twice a month:  it's heavy, heady stuff.  That said, don't let that turn you off - food and service are VERY consistent.  LOTS of smoky flavor - but in a good way.  Probably our favorite sit down BBQ spot on the south side of town.  If you want a more upscale experience than Rock Store and better food than Midwood this is your go-to spot."}
{"text":"I guess I am in the minority here but I was underwhelmed by the food at this place. My husband and I ordered out and got the ribs and  a pulled pork dinner. He said the ribs were decent but had no smoke flavor. I was very disappointed with the pulled pork; like the ribs I did not taste any smoke flavor. It was dry and cold- I had to heat it up in the microwave - we  live  less than 15 mins away from the restaurant.  The portion size on the pulled pork was poor for the $15.95 price. For the sides we did baked beans, slaw and the Burnt End Mac.  Neither entree came with rolls, hush puppies or any kind of bread.  

The baked beans had a good flavor but tasted underdone to me. The  cider slaw was very bland, just mayo, cabbage and carrots, no salt, pepper or cider flavor. The burnt ends mac and cheese is the only reason I am giving 2 stars. It was creamy and the burnt ends gave it nice flavor-  it was very good. The dinners came with a variety of sauces which were  tomato based but thin, and spicy; not the traditional, thicker,sweeter sauce that I am used to.

Overall,  I can't say that we would take out from this restaurant any time soon."}
{"text":"The brisket sandwich was one of the best I've ever had. Incredibly tender and tasty meat. Great service by Zack. He brought over some sauce that brought some heat and was soooo good! I'll ask for the xxx sauce next time I stop by Smoke."}
{"text":"Some good, some not so good. Great atmosphere, and service! Fried Pickles, and bacon wrapped shrimp appetizers we're very good. Full rack of baby back ribs were a little tough. I was definitely disappointed in the ribs.   We also ordered the Salmon Salad and was told the Salmon was not good, not cooked on bottom. My Brother ordered beef brisket and said that was amazing. I also tried that and I agree! Gave 4 stars for the service, apps, beer brisket, and choices you can look over. We were obviously slightly disappointed in some of it, but would return to check other things out. It is a wonderful place."}
{"text":"Took my meat loving dad here for Father's Day. First of all the decor is stylish and casually upscale with rustic accents. The menu is very affordable (I just moved from New York and this vibe/menu would cost 2x as much there so yay for the south!), extensive and there are wonderful options that creatively update southern fare, including shrimp and grits and deviled eggs. He had the 3 meat bbq plate with brisket, ribs, and pulled pork. It's nice that they ask you how you like your meat-fatty or lean, sauced or not. I got the nachos- pretty tasty, especially after dousing with the different hot sauces on the table but the queso was so-so. The plain Mac and cheese was great so I can only imagine how delicious the loaded options are. Brownie dessert is sized to share with the whole table. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Perhaps we should have waited a few weeks before giving Smoke a try, but we were in the area and in the mood for BBQ. It was only an \"ok\" experience for us. 

Pros: 
~ Great location
~ The combo platters are a decent deal for 2 \"moderately\" hungry people 
~ Decor/Ambiance is very nice. Not what one would expect for a BBQ place
~ Very friendly service
~ Excellent drink menu 
~ We really enjoyed the Pulled Pork and the Mac & Cheese. The KC BBQ sauce was delicious!!

Cons:
~ Service was VERY slow. We arrived at 5:30 on a Friday night and we were seated immediately (it wasn't busy at all yet), but then we waited for service...and then drinks...and then food....and then the takeout container...and then the check. Honestly, I was pretty annoyed by the time we left. Our server was a sweet as could be and she did keep checking in on us, but we were at the table for over an hour!...and we only had the combo...no apps.
~ We ordered the 4 meat/2 side combo (designed for two people). It came with odd portions of meat. For example: three ribs and the \"2\" pieces of chicken were a wing and a (small) breast. We had to order a second piece of chicken because it just wasn't enough for us. There were four pieces of brisket, but after we trimmed the fat, there were barely 2 servings left. The pulled pork serving was decent enough. In my opinion, the combo portion is more than enough for one person, but not enough for two people.
~ The brisket was the fattiest I have ever seen. Most places trim the fat cap so you still get a good helping of meat, but leave enough fat for moisture and taste. Unfortunately, the fat to meat ratio was terribly off balance.
~ The good was served \"warm\". That means that we waited for an extraordinarily long time for our food that was basically sitting as the pass waiting to be served.
~ The acoustics in the building as terrible. The music was REALLY loud and people's voices carried throughout the dining room. 

I know that we really should give it another try in a few weeks or so, but I just don't know at this point. Perhaps I will continue to monitor the reviews to see what others are saying before deciding for sure? We didn't hate it by any means, but there are so many restaurants that we like that I am always hesitate to go back to one that we really didn't love. We shall see."}
{"text":"When my family and I arrive we were put on a 15 minute wait list. It took 25 minutes till we were sat. The servers service was great, but the food was not amble for the the price. The pork sandwich was dry and small for $11.95 price. The brisket plate that my wife ordered was full of fat and It was very disappointing. I have eaten brisket for many years and understand fatty versus lean. The only highlight of the meal was the fried pickles, but it even had to bit too  much salt added to them.  Bottom line this restaurant is way over priced for the quality of product that it's selling. I have been to midwood smoke house and it was much better for the money."}
{"text":"Service was great, Meg did a wonderful job accommodating us, beef brisket was not so good, was told everything made to order, tasted dried out, the sauces at the table were flavorless. Sticking with 521 BBQ"}
{"text":"The Bacon Wrapped Shrimp was very good, except the sauce that they served it with was blah.  The ribs tasted like Liquid Smoke and the order of BBQ was very small.  Not likely to go back."}
{"text":"Wow... I'm so pleasantly surprised!

Please go here. I'm a huge BBQ critic because I grew up with Wilber's BBQ, which is the best of the best... This is a great 2nd choice.

The staff are so friendly. Great cocktails, and the devilish eggs, and Mac and cheese were on point!

I will be back!!!"}
{"text":"A good lunch spot during the workweek for those looking to escape the same old same old in the corporate park. They're fast, efficient and tasty. Half the battle during the week is parking your car!!! Food is great - fresh and tasty and they keep the drinks full (what a relief that is versus having to chase down the waitstaff). I'm a huge fan of the randezvous salad with salmon! The dinner options are plentiful but I'm ashamed to admit that my favorite meal at the BBQ joint is the shrimp and grits! YUM."}
{"text":"We ordered Smoke for a catered event at work and it was phenomenal. My favorite were the Korean BBQ wings and the corn muffins. The kale salad was great. I brought home left over brisket sliders and smoked turkey sliders and my boys and husband loves them!"}
{"text":"This one night we came just to sample the \"Burnt ends with Mac and Cheese\" and were greatly disappointed. It was poorly executed and not up to par with a place that serves such good meats and cocktails. 

You would think with \"Burnt ends\" the Mac and Cheese would be oven baked and broiled so that accordingly you get crisp, charred bits of macaroni on the top surace along with baked bits of cheese.  The cheese sauce should be thick and creamy and the pasta should be chewy. ..

Instead the opposite was true. It was all done wrong. The macaroni was WAY overcooked and reduced to baby food consistency with no texture.  The cheese was barely existent and the sauce was a watery, drippy mess.  How sad to have those bits of burnt ends so mistreated by swimming in this diluted watery mess. 

We came back home and the next day made a respectable casserole of oven-baked and broil-finished mac and cheese just to get that sad, pathetic memory washed out of our brains. 

Hey guys try looking up the NY Times Best Macaroni and Cheese recipe online on google with 3,000 5 stars - You'll do your restaurant a favor by getting rid of that poor excuse of mac and cheese.. 

Having said that - the smoked meats here are superb. Side dishes unfortunately, fall flat including the mayo-based cole slaw. Yech. Plenty of room for improvement. We'll be back but will avoid the side dishes"}
{"text":"I've always raised an eyebrow at white-table-cloth barbecue restaurants, because everyone knows the best que meat comes on paper plates, served on old formica-top tables in cinder-block buildings, at least ten miles from the center of town.

But, this place is close to the movie theatre, and we were hungry, so...

We chose poorly. 

As a concept, I'm sure that this place is working really hard to put independent barbecue in chain-dominated South Charlotte. Sadly, for all of the decor and all of the really tasty-looking cocktails on the menu, it misses the mark on the most important aspect of running a barbecue joint- barbecue. 

I'm not going to debate regional styles, or anything like that, but if you are going to put brisket and chicken, and \"pulled pork\" on a menu with a Cuban sandwich, then you should do those things pretty well. The brisket was, sadly, dry, the first time around. So dry, in fact, that the server took one look at it and took the plate right back to the kitchen for a few fresh slices. The side of baked beans was also, literally, dry on top, and the slaw was a tad warm and wilted (heat lamps wreak havoc on a long shred of cabbage). The pulled pork was pretty good, a little lean, and much better if you didn't try to put any of the \"carolina-style\" sauce on it.

The one thing this place has going for it- great service, and a front-end manager that took our complaint about dry brisket that had been sitting in the window too long very seriously. The second service of brisket was right on- decent smoke, decent level of moisture, and obviously plated just a few seconds before. As in any presentation, plating and the timing of plating can be unforgiving, especially if you don't time all of the entrees on the ticket correctly.

I think that this place is working pretty hard to dial it in, and I hope that they get it figured out. I think that they are trying to figure out the \"smoker\" that they have installed in the open kitchen, and maybe need to start thinking about limiting the proteins on the menu (they have an extensive mac-and-cheese selection- perhaps I need to explore that, next time).

TLDR; A safe place for people who don't subscribe to a particular barbecue tradition, and don't have any southern friends who are willing to take them to a barbecue restaurant."}
{"text":"I only had the shrimp Mac and cheese because I don't really care for bbq, but it was tasty and I would eat it again."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, friendly staff, and excellent BBQ. We had dinner here one night while in town for a soccer tournament. We will definitely be back if we are in the area again."}
{"text":"Ate here with a co-worker and its pretty good. The bbq is well smoked and the sauces are nice. Its a bit pricey would be the only downside."}
{"text":"I don't know if the other reviewers read that this restaurant has only been open for 3 weeks or not, but I think everyone is being a bit harsh. Give them a minute!
I hadn't read any reviews before going to try it, and we were very pleasantly surprised!  
Texans are always happy to find great brisket, especially me!  BTW, if you order the \"lean\" brisket, you are doing it wrong. Also, if you complain that your brisket has fat on it, and cut it off or send it back, you are doing it wrong (other reviewers). Don't waste good brisket on these people! I found the fatty brisket to be really great, and didn't need any type of sauce, which is a high compliment. 
Speaking of sauces, didn't care for any of them except the mustard sauce for the sausage and chicken. If you like vinegar-ey sauces, you will probably like all of the sauces.
We also had the sausage, the smoked chicken and the ribs (dry rub choice). The ribs were fantastic (very smoky), the chicken is smoked and then the skin is crisped up before serving, which I thought really made it. The sausage was good, not great. 
In the future, I will order the brisket and the ribs. 
Side items were really delicious, and better than usual at a BBQ place. We really loved the spinach.
Service was great, loved the atmosphere. I have had enough of plastic checked tablecloths and eating on butcher paper with plastic forks!  I am sensitive to noise, and usually must wear ear plugs, but didn't have to here.
Give them a try!"}
{"text":"Initially, we were very excited to try this place. We ordered beers and the burnt end appetizer to start. For $9.95, I expected a little more than 8 small pieces, not to mention, the meat quality was subpar and nothing like I was anticipating. We ordered the prime rib sandwich, with the upgrade of the pulled pork and green chili Mac and cheese and a combo plate of brisket and sausage with a side of baked beans and slaw. The baked beans tasted like they had tomato paste added and not properly cooked in. The Mac and cheese was nothing special & had a strange \"flour\" taste. Overall, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't anything  worth going back for."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here on Friday the 15th and service was wonderful and the food was even better! Our waitress suggested the bacon and Jalapeno mac and cheese and it was the best thing ever! My only complaint is that there drinks are not very strong so maybe don't order booze. We will totally be going back!"}
{"text":"Service was efficient and fast.
Menu was very mixed with beef, chicken and pork. The cheesy grits and mac & cheese were both perfect. The fried pickles were good. Beef brisket was fabulous.
They have a excellent beer menu and some solid bourbons and single malt. Something for everyone.
This is owned by Firebirds."}
{"text":"Not bad, not great BBQ.  Burnt ends were quite tough.  Ribs were ok.  Nothing to write home about.  Service at the bar was very good."}
{"text":"First time eating here was Mother's Day 2016 with my family. Great customer service from the staff here. The waiter was courteous and asked us offered many suggestions when he found out it was our first time here. My brother asked him about the protein options and he told us that the brisket was fantastic. I'd agreed. Glad I got it. Paired up with the Mac N Cheese, perfection on your plate. If you leave hungry there is something seriously wrong with your appetite."}
{"text":"((Edit:  since this review they have added the prime rib back to the menu.  I have adjusted the rating accordingly)) So this review used to be a solid 4 maybe a 5.  The barbecue I've had here has been average. Not better than any of the other myriad of places available in the area.  And while the atmosphere is nice you pay for it in the cost of the food which I'd say is more than average.

What made this place a 4 was on the weekend they served a smoked prime rib.  And it was truly exceptional.  A unique flavor and really a step above anything else on the menu.

But they took it off the menu.  And if I have to judge the place based just on the barbecue.  It's average barbecue at inflated prices in a nice atmosphere.  That my friends is 2.   What a shame."}
{"text":"First time here and was pleasantly surprised.  My husband got the bbq combo with creamed spinach and green beans.  He gives the creamed spinach a 10 if he could. Creamy and cheesy. It had a top crust of Parmesan cheese. Fantastic. I got the burnt end Mac and cheese very good. Only thing I wish the burnt ends tasted more like burnt ends. Otherwise it had good flavor overall.  My other favorite place for bbq better watch out.  They got some completion."}
{"text":"I needed something quick before heading over to the movie theater across the street so I popped in and ordered the smokin nachos with beef brisket and they were great! 

Our waiter, Josh was great and the other items on the dinner menu sounded delicious and the prices were reasonable. I look forward to coming here again."}
{"text":"Ordered take out for a quick dinner at home. Brisket is offered 3 ways--fatty, lean, and combo--we tried lean, but I'm thinking more fat would probably be better. Mac and cheese was good and the smokin' slaw was refreshingly different. The corn muffins were good, but we didn't care for the butter they serve with them. Try them plain to see which you prefer. 

Burnt ends were good. Korean sauce was REALLY thick, so maybe just lightly dip to get plenty of flavor. 

Next time, we want to eat in to get the full experience. We definitely don't miss City Tavern (previous tenant), so hopefully this place will do well.

Parking can be a beast here when the movie theater is busy. Park in front of Michaels and walk a few more steps to save yourself the frustration of looking for a space. You'll want to walk off those calories, anyway!"}
{"text":"Yumm. I thought ah another BBQ joint but was always curious and finally popped in.- glad I did. The decor is really \"hip\" and clean. And the meat is delicious!! Ribs are soo good- not fatty or poor quality but instead really thick good meat and they smoked them beautifully !! There's happy he special of $1 per BBQ rib bone and honestly 5 of them plus a side filled me up! 
 
The sweet ice tea is the bomb. Such good deep flavor. Brought a vegetarian friend and she had the 'fooled u' shredded carrot BBQ sandwich and Mac and cheese as well as cheesy grits and loved them.
Can't wait to go back! Quality on point and great service as well waiter very attentive !"}
{"text":"Just had the most fabulous dinner at Smoke in Stonecrest!!!  The staff,  especially our waiter Josh were above and beyond the best!  The food was AMAZING!!!!  Truly one of the best evenings out 
for dinner we've had in a very long time!!!!!  Highly recommend!!!"}
{"text":"Tuesday night was my birthday and we decided to go to Smoke.  We dine there fairly often, and it used to be fantastic, but the last three times it was mediocre at best.  I noticed when we walked in that the special was a prime rib sandwich.  I asked the waitress about the special and she told me that it was not a sandwich, but a prime rib plate.  She seemed completely confused, but insisted she was right.  A few minutes later she came back and admitted she was wrong...but even worse...she added \"They cooked way too much prime rib this past weekend...so we're having a special to get rid of it all. They always do that when they cook too much.\"  While I understand that's a common practice in the restaurant world...that's not what you say to sell food to your customers.  I did not order the prime rib.  The pork ribs were great, but the brisket was dry and I'm pretty sure it was leftover too.  Both meats were barely warm.  I ordered the cheesy grits and they came out as a cold, tasteless, congealed blob.  The sweet potato fries were nice and hot though.

The time before last that we are there, I ordered brisket and after waiting about 45 minutes for our food, they came out and served my husband and told me they were out of brisket.  I ordered the pulled chicken...which took another 15-20 minutes to arrive...my husband had already finished eating.  This is a huge pet peeve of mine in a restaurant.  I won't even get into how the waiter was acting.  

I hope they get it together again soon...I really used to love this place!"}
{"text":"This is the worst barbecue I have ever tasted in my life.  The barbecue has absolutely no flavor.  It is very crude cuts of meat.  We ordered the nachos and the cheese was not even up to snuff for movie theater nachos."}
{"text":"Smoke has both a great atmosphere and selection of dishes. Everything on the menu is extremely appealing with appetizers such as fried pickles and jumbo chicken wings and entrees including sandwiches, barbecue plates, and build-your-own salads. I ordered the grilled cheese pulled pork sandwich and finished every bite. The food prices are leaning towards the expensive end of the spectrum but the experience is well worth it."}
