{"text":"I was asked by the entertainment this night to come meet and check them out they were looking for a replacement. I sat at the bar and when asked by the bar staff what I was drinking I asked for a Sprite. First I really didn't mind having to pay for the glass of ice cubes and lime slice though in just about any other bar this beverage is almost always free. What I took exception to was my change disappearing after my asking if it was okay to leave it while I went outside to speak with the entertainment. $2.25 after paying $2.75 for the glass of ice cubes and lime slice. Either way you slice it $5.00 for this non-alcoholic first time experience at the West Shore Bar and Grill is my last. However, the wait staff was indeed polite, courteous and very fast. I was going to and should have after all picked up a Country Style coffee on the way butt felt it was kind a tacky butt that's just me."}
{"text":"Went there with my family as it's located right in the neighbourhood and was pleasantly surprised.  The inside decor is nice, it's kitschy but well done.

The owner came over and spoke to us and asked us about our food and what we liked to eat.  It was a nice personal touch.

The food was good.  They had a large variety of traditional food as well as some ethnic varieties.  I had the perogies which came with smoked meat, very different but very tasty!

I also had the poutine, it had a nice spice to it.

Overall I would go again.  I hope you enjoy it!"}
{"text":"We came here on a Monday night for dinner and save for a few punters strategically placed around the bar, the place was pretty much empty.

The service was really great and we were greeted as soon as we walked in. I can't really say that I'm a fan of the interior though - with the stone floor and dim lighting, I found it to be a tad cold and uninviting... although the booths were nice.

They opened in December of 2011 and have started out with quite an extensive menu with the average price of a meal being around $12.00. Although I am to understand they will be making an attempt to streamline their menu in the new year.

They have a really good selection on their lunch and brunch menus and a few pages of appetizers to choose from. On their main menu, they have a wide range of wraps, salads, stir-fries, sandwiches, steak, pasta, fish, burgers and... wait for it... an entire international menu! Phew! So much food, so little time.

We stuck with the basics and ordered their Mushroom Swiss Burger ($9.00 + $2.00 with bacon) and their Grilled Chicken Caesar ($12.00).

For their burger, they offer a quarter-pound %100 beef patty with sauteed mushrooms and swiss cheese... I of course had to add bacon!  The burger patty was huge - definitely handmade and cooked perfectly leaving it nice and juicy. The fries were hand-cut with skin on and the perfect compliment to this dish.

My husband had the Grilled Chicken Caesar which consisted of romaine lettuce tossed with bacon bits, parmesan cheese and garlic all of which supported a seasoned chicken breast.

Although he found the chicken to be a little dry, the ceasar salad was quite good and really brought the dish together. I think, had it been socially acceptable, he would have licked the plate clean!

The food we had was worthy of a 4-star rating however the atmosphere, in my opinion, is a 2-star at best."}
