{"text":"We live about a 5 minute drive from this place, it's very handy. The food is very good when we don't have time to cook, or want to grab a side of something. We love their \"turon\" banana fritters especially when they're still hot. They catered our daughter's birthday party, and the food was a hit with the guests."}
{"text":"POSITIVE FEEDBACK: - FOOD:  It is actually good. Not the best I've had since the best Filipino cook I know is my mother, but yeah they are good enough. My fave picks would be their Bicol Express (spicy, coconut milk and shrimp paste based stew, garlicy, gingery and porky goodness) and their Kare Kare (peanut sauce based stew, sweet and balanced with salty fermented shrimp paste, with morsels of meat and pieces of veggies) - LOCATION: It is so close to my house!  RANT: - I do not understand this particular ideology and ethic of running a food joint and this is notorious among a lot of Filipino cafeteria style restaurants I know, except for COFFEE IN (which is definitely my favourite).   I really do not understand why they SKIMP on the portions of their food. In Tagalog, \"Nagtitipid\". I do not understand it at all. I always poke fun of the way they carefully count the amount of morsels of pork they put in your takeout container or how much rice they put. It's like they have Parkinson's Disease or something when they scoop the food into your container, shaking constantly, nervous that they might put too much. For the amount they charge too, they have the nerve to do this.   I was going to give this place at least 3 stars, but the whole deprived acting ways and desperate ways to cut food costs is just so embarrassing and really bad. And PORK does not even cost a lot compared to any other meats, so I do not understand where the desperate cost saving stinjyness is coming from.   //Rant over.  Not coming back. Food taste good, but no. Not coming back,"}
{"text":"- great find. cafeteria style dining with pre-made magical goodness with a tiny grocery section for filipino import items - they have about 12 to 15 different choices... lots of PORK!!!! also have plenty of chicken and veggie options. - very friendly owners with recommendations for the folks who need the direction - is quite a steal @ rice + 2 sides for $6.99 (includes a drink) - chicken adobo is great... pak siw (pork belly braised in a sweet sauce) is even better. oh man. i'm so going back."}
{"text":"This place is one of the cleanest Filipino restaurants I have seen in Toronto. This place serves food that epitomizes homestyle Filipino cooking, and they do this consstently well. My favourites include:  Beef calderetta - a thick rich beef stew that features chunks of beef gently simmered in a luscious tomato based sauce.  Pork barbecue Filipino style - pork chunks on a bamboo skewer is marinated in a sweet-salty-spicy-tangy blend and grilled to juicy perfection! Absolutely deelish with a side rder of rice and the grilled eggplant salad. Binagoongan - chunks of pork cooked in a blend of garlic, to ate, salted shrimps and soy sauce. Ths ain't diet food baby! Halo halo - dessert that defies description. This is the perfect treat on a hot summer day. Fresh Lumpia - lightly saut√©ed, savoury, crisp-tender vegetables wrapped in an oh-so-tender crepe, bathed in a delightful garlic based sauce. Very similar to Malaysian Poh-Pia.  Turin - imagine this: sweet ripe plantain slices and sweet jackfruit slivers wrapped in spring roll wrapper, lightly kissed with brown sugar and deep fried to a crispy, sticky, caramelized perfection! This is a traditionalafternoon snack and at Kapit Bahay, is always sold out by 5 pm. Very reasonable prices and friendly service."}
{"text":"Based on Yelp reviews and the sheer proximity to home ground, I decided to make an impromptu stop at Kapit Bahay for some take out.  I picked up some pancit, beef adobo, the baby squid in vinegar sauce and one other pork dish I can't recall.  I have to say that I've only had Filipino food at one other place (Bella's Lechon) so I am by no means an expert in this cuisine.  With that said, the pancit was very good.  I find the use of both thick and thin noodles used for this dish quite interesting.  I'm definitely a noodle lover whether fried or in soup.  Kapit Bahay's pancit was well fried with all the ingredients mixed in without lumpiness.  The mildly flavourful noodles were right up my alley and I will definitely come back for these babies.    Then there were everything else.  The beef adobo was very ho- hum at best.  I tasted too much sweetness (is it supposed to be like that?) in the slightly spicy thick tomato based sauce with the chunks of beef (too much gristle for my liking) along with carrots, potatoes..etc.    The baby squid in vinegar sauce was too vinegary.  I know, I know....it is supposed to be in a vinegar sauce.  But I'm making an honest comparison to the same dish I had over at Bella's Lechon and I have to say, Kapit Bahay's version was too vinegary for me.  Bella's Lechon makes the same dish that tasted more pleasant, almost like the baby squids were cooked in their ink.  I will return to Bella's Lechon if I wanted to have the squid dish not to Kapit Bahay.  The pork dish....was, well, just oily.  There was a pretty think layer of oil by the time we got home to eat it.  Don't get me wrong, I heart pork belly as much as the next guy/gal but staring at that think layer of artery clogging oleaginous liquid....I couldn't bring myself to eat more than just one piece.  To be honest, I can't even tell you what it tasted like.    All in all, I liked one dish out of the four we took home so I think 2 stars is pretty fair.  Oh, and we did take 2 chicken patties to go and they were also too sweet.  Again, I'm not sure if they're supposed to taste like that but if so, I guess I wouldn't be ordering them again."}
{"text":"I used to be a regular here, coming at least once a week for a few years.  I don't know what's happened in the last few months but food quality has been poor, and the once happy and sweet servers are no longer so happy.    I don't know if they have a new chef or what, but they are using cheaper cuts of meat (really fatty too) and the food simply hasn't tasted good.   Portions are also considerably smaller.   The first time i experienced this disappointment,  it was so bad (dinuguaan and mechado), I had to throw the food away.    I hoped that their regular cook was on vacation, so I gave it a second and third chance, weeks apart, hoping this was only a temporary decline in quality and service but it doesn't appear to be so.   What a shame. I hate to say goodbye to a place I once frequented so often,  but with all the other Filipino food competition in Scarborough, I've found other great alternatives and a new favourite."}
{"text":"Filipino Breakfast Buffet...   There are tonnes of Filipino take out places in Scarborough or even Toronto for that matter. But only one place does Filipino Breakfast buffet. Kapit Bahay is that place  The breakfast buffet is a great alternative to brunch. This weekend brunch buffet offers many of the filipino staples (tuyo - dried fish), scrambled eggs, longganisa (sweet cured sausage), tocino (cured pork almost like sweet saucy jerky), salted eggs with tomatoes, filipino porridge, etc. And they also have the usual bacon. The place has a good selection of filipino foods, and if youre craving real ulam (dish) to go with the fried rice, just cross over to take out place and youre for sure gnna find some freshly cooked dishes.  The servers are really nice and theyll always greet ya with a smile. Overall, been my go to spot for filipino breakfast buffet since its conception.  Also the price is amazing, $11.99 for buffet. Where as a regular filipino breakfast meal is $8.99 with only either tocino or longganisa or other single dish plus eggs n rice. Cant beat the price if $11.99 to fill up on tonnes of food."}
