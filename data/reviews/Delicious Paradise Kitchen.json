{"text":"They are a bit pricey for food court but the food is very good with excellent wok hay.  Wide variety of interesting dishes, but lot of the good stuff is written in chinese only though."}
{"text":"Decent food at a decent price. They get busier each time I go. Although the food court has shrunk, therefore limiting the amount of seating, it doesn't stop me from coming back. Their food is still greasy at times, but they have good wok hay (Wok Heat), and their noodle dishes are still as good."}
{"text":"Where in Toronto can you get Fried Rice Noodle with Beef for $4.50 tax including? This place is located at Food Court at SilverStar Blvd near Splendid China Mall across Pacific Mall. The food is decent, although I haven't tried much of their menu items."}
