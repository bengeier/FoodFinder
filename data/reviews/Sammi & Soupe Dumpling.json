{"text":"I've eaten here several time and while I always order the same thing (the mushroom and cabbage dumplings - as I'm vegetarian and their options are limited for non-carnivores), it's always sublime. They make the dumplings by hand, for a reasonable price, and they are truly sublime. I tried the spicy tofu appetizer and was not impresse, as it was a block of uncooked soft tofu, cut into cubes and covered with raw scallions and fiery red chili oil and paste. Not my cup of tea, though others may enjoy it. They also sometimes have hot tea available and other times they don't, which I find a bit odd. Point it, the dumplings are incredible. Go and eat, you will not be dissapointed."}
{"text":"The xiao long bao was a bit too large and doughy for my taste. I enjoyed the spicy cucumbers but would like a bit more spice. We also had the fried dumplings which were good. Overall I thought it was okay but I have had a lot better."}
{"text":"Shifty with their closing time - despite them apparently being open until 10pm, I was turned away both times I tried  to eat here -- both times I arrived at ~9:15pm, their 'open' sign was lit, and there were customers still eating. Left with the impression that the servers just wanted to get home early, and I would be a nuisance in that plan. C'mon! Laaaaame! Such a bummer to be turned away as a customer. Once? Annoying, but I'll get over it. Twice? I've made a point of not going there again. Too bad; I love dumplings!"}
{"text":"I go once a week...

I used to think this place was only so so, but now I love it. I've had all the different kinds of dumplings. My favorite is the shrimp pork and scallops.

The cucumber salad is amazing, so good, try it, it looks like nothing but it's actually  so well made. This place is so cheap too, the service could be slow when they are busy but the quality of the food makes up for it. I love this place and it's a pretty decent soup dumpling, not the best but definitely hits the spot everytime.

:)"}
{"text":"This is the best dumpling and xiao long bao! A must try. Whenever I crave it, I am willing to make a 20-30 min drive downtown to fulfill my cravings. It is my top pick in Montreal. Everyone that I introduce to this place, loves it too.

I have been going to this place for over a year and each time, it is always serves 5 star food. My word of advice is that it is best to get them steamed, not fried.

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Typically nondescript decor, but a warm and friendly welcome is an excellent sign of what follows: quite simply the freshest and most flavourful dumplings north of Joe's Shanghai  in New York. And you get to watch them being made from scratch by the hands of the staff; then proudly put before you to slurp and enjoy.
And the price is also great : $7.95 for 15!!

Equally enticing is the option of ordering and then hanging about for 10 minutes to take home and boil up a simple and delicious meal!!"}
{"text":"Excellent. Les bouchées sont préparées devant vous. Elles sont moelleuses (mais attention très chaude aussi).
La salades d'algues est à tester."}
{"text":"I think this place has the BEST soup dumplings. I never had their other dumplings. I mean, why would I when they are most well known for their soup dumplings. I've tried many of the flavours but my favourite are the pork shrimp and scallop ( I think) ones."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the place. I think it's a great place to have decent soup dumpling at a reasonable price. 

I personally like the pork dumplings (All of them) steam and the beef curry (Fried one). The service is quick but something they mess up specially when it's busy. So try to go before busy hours, you will get a much better service.

The place only takes cash and debit. Also I do not recommend the wonton soup as entree it's below average."}
{"text":"Excellent food!
Had the pork&veg wonton soup, juicy classic pork dumpling, and juicy sweet pork dumpling.
The wonton soup was phenomenal. The temperature and the flavor were perfect. And there were lots of wontons.

I liked the sweet pork dumpling better than the classic one. Very fragrant, sweet, and again the temperature was good.

One star off due tp the slow service. I've been here numerous times and the service has been consistently slow. So I was expecting the same and they didn't disappoint! Hopefully they will get better in the future. Or, at least serve the dishes without the long gap between them."}
{"text":"Very tasty and juicy chicken and mushroom xiao long bao. Sesame soy noodles were also good."}
{"text":"Delicious juicy home made xiao long bao. Sweet Pork are my favorites. Fried dumplings are excellent too. Note that you can also see the ladies make the dumplings through the window :)"}
{"text":"Best soup dumpling house in Montreal. The prices are amazing for the food you get. Not the most \"upscale\" looking place but the perfect comfort food for a student like me. The service is pretty good but the best thing on the menu is the sweet pork soup dumpling. Sometimes I have random cravings for it and I go back again and again."}
{"text":"Went at 11 in the morning. Maybe their steamer wasn't fully heated yet.. their soup dumplings came out raw. Told them. . They fixed it and fine. It was probably comparable to some of the best in Shanghai and Taiwan.  Only difference is that their wrapping has a airy texture. So texture of the wrapping is very thin indeed, but lacks the chewey texture traditional ones had.  Not that it's a bad thing.. it kept the meats inside extremely juicey, soup gushing out and hot as anyone needs it to be. Apps.. I had spicy tofu and wontons. . Meh. . Stick with the soupy dumplings.. you can't go wrong"}
{"text":"GASTRO!!! Mon amie et moi, on a eu le gastro après manger là...

Le service est bête. Je suis un peu habitué de ce genre de service en Chine, mais à Montréal aussi?? 

Je dois dire que les xiao long bao aux crevettes étaient délicieux, même s'il y en a qui sont juteux et y'en a que non. Pour le prix, on ne devrait pas être picky... 

Mais je ne retournerai certainement plus, car j'étais malade pendant 3 jours. 

J'espère que vous n'auriez pas la même expérience que moi. Bonne chance!"}
{"text":"These xiao long bao are better and cheaper than the ones you can find in TO!!!! The fried beef curry dumplings are also really good. My husband can't get enough of the soy cucumber noodle side dish! (Only $2.99!)"}
{"text":"Why does this place keep getting such rave reviews?

It's filthy, they don't use proper food handling at all. Even if the food is good, it's hardly worth food poisoning.

The lamb and coriander dumplings were WAY too greasy and they fell completely apart. The shrimp and vegetable ones were okay but half had some extra mystery meat. 

Was not impressed, will not be returning, and mystified as to why so many people are so impressed.

Service was slow and not particularly good. Ordered an appetizer that never came so we just figured they forgot it. We went to pay and they said \"Oh, you didn't get your appetizer\". We declined, paid, and left.

Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"l shared two kind of the pork xiao long bao with my friend. I prefer the sweet one than the salt one. It's awesome that juicy steamed xiao long bao is stuffed with pork?When you have a bite, you will be surprised there are a lot of soup inside. It's worth to try it?"}
{"text":"Delicious steamed dumplings and very fast service. When we arrived there was a bit of a wait but it was well worth it.  The only reason why I rated thus 4 out of 5 was due to the fact that they only had some of the options on the menu.  If you're in Montreal and craving dumplings definitely give them a try."}
{"text":"By far the worst service you can possibly get. Ive had their dumplings multiple times and that's why I keep coming back to them, but after tonight, never again and I would never recommend it to anyone I know. Waitstaff lacks initiative, and there is an apparent weakness in their management team. We got our table at 5:32pm and by 6:04pm our orders had still not been taken, no one had the decency to even tell us it wouldn't be too long and that they'd take our orders in a short while-absolutely nothing. Our waitress found it more important to refill everyone's cup of water in the restaurant as well as refilling the extra cups on the counter for the upcoming customers rather than taking our order. Having worked in a restaurant, I can say that I am quite understanding when I see the waitstaff swamped with customers but the service I received tonight, I must say was horrendous and I will make sure to tell everyone I know of my displeasure of this restaurant."}
{"text":"had to leave after waiting 20+ minutes for our order. halfway through the wait, our server asked to remove the condiments from our table as it seemed they were getting ready to close, but we still never got our food. after asking if we should leave, the hostess said \"yes\". really dissapointing service."}
{"text":"Visitamos o lugar através das indicacoes. Esperava mais, os dumplings sao bons, mas comparado ao Mothers de Toronto, este ainda é o melhor que conhecemos nesta viagem. Lugar simples, pontos de melhoria Limpeza pratos."}
{"text":"This place has really good soup dumplings! They make the dumplings Fresh and you can see them making it. I like these dumplings cause they actually have soup
In them, I've tried some places where there really isn't any soup. But this place is really affordable and tastes great. 

Downfall is the service is quite crappy. You gotta holler at the waitresses if you need help, so don't be s"}
{"text":"I recently relocated to upstate New York. I always get soup dumplings when I'm in NYC. Outside of Shanghai NYC is the best place for soup dumplings. However I'm closer to Montreal than the city now. I Googled soup dumplings and Montreal and up popped Sammis. Sammi's has authentic soup dumplings. Not the best I've had but right up there. Excellent dumplings no doubt. Service was great. Waitresses were very friendly. Prices were very reasonable! Will definitely repeat!"}
{"text":"Went in at 5. Didnt even get serviced. They just kept eating their stupid food. Had to leave"}
{"text":"A casual dumpling shop place, do not come here expecting excellent service or anything fancily presented. The menu is simple - a few starters and a moderate variety of xiaolongbao and potsticker dumplings. There is good variety for all diets-various meat and veggie options are available. Having been looking for more Chinese food in Montreal, I was not disappointed. 

The wait for food to arrive after order was a by longer than expected, but may be due to a busy night in the shop in general. Have patience as there's limited staff in the small shop. 

The xiaolongbao comes in sets of 10 and are more northerner sized-about 2in in diameter. Coming from Toronto where super-southern-style (read: Guangdong) ones are popular, these felt much larger and the skin was thicker. We ordered the classic pork and the chicken and mushroom - the classic was an expected good flavour and the chicken and mushroom was a good unconventional option. 

The potsticker dumplings come in sets of 15 and are, oppositely, smaller than I expected. They're folded with the ends open to allow the oil to leak out making the skin crispier. We ordered the pork and bok choy and the beef curry. The pork and bok choy was again, a classic combination with a flavour that met expectation. The beef curry was a surprising twist that I thoroughly enjoyed - not too spicy but had a curry kick."}
{"text":"Fantastic soup dumplings! Simple service but pleasant. It's busy and you can watch the staff in the kitchen making the dumplings. The seafood soup dumplings are the best!"}
{"text":"Awesome soups dumplings. Had the sweet pork, never had it before, it was very interesting. They made it with brown sugar, which adds a lot of complexity to the flavor. I'm glad I tried it, but I think I prefer the classical savory pork.

About the service-- soup dumplings is street food! They're not supposed to have service! As long as you don't come with expectations of proper restaurant service, it's all very fine! They're actually very nice when they have time to chat."}
{"text":"This place seems to be doing a good job of pumping up social media lately so I thought I would give them a try. The only thing I can recommend is... EVERYTHING ON THEIR MENU!!!

soup dumplings are pretty trendy right now and I have tried a few and these ones are better than the others I have tried, the broth is out of this world. What takes a back seat to the taste is the amount of fun they are to eat.

The neatest part is watching through the glass window the ladies making the dumplings, they look like those people that can solve a Rubik's cube super fast, I couldn't help but laugh at how crazy fast their fingers are moving.

And for 2 people the bill was only $20!! No visa though"}
{"text":"Great value for their menu prices! I got the pork and leek xiao long bao and noodles with peanut sauce--I enjoyed both dishes. If you're looking to have a cheap light lunch this is a good place to go! (:"}
{"text":"I've heard great things about this restaurant, so it was only natural that I tried it! It's pretty hard to find GREAT soup dumplings in Montréal, so I was pretty excited. Overall, my experience was okay, but not amazing.

There was a sign that said \"Please wait to be seated\", but when my girlfriend and I entered the restaurant, we were told to sit wherever we wanted.

We ordered their lamb, and classic pork soup dumplings. They arrived pretty quickly, which was nice. The classic pork was a little underwhelming, but the lamb dumplings were very flavorful. Although the flavor was there, I was disappointed that both types of dumplings kept breaking. I've had many soup dumplings before, and this is something that does not happen with well-made soup dumplings.

I am slightly sensitive to msg, so when the food is prepared with lots of it, my tongue becomes numb. After about 20 minutes, my tongue started to feel numb; if you're sensitive to msg, perhaps this is not the best restaurant for you! This being said, the lamb dumplings were very flavorful, with lots of meat and soup. 

Their beer prices are pretty decent, so I may come back for some Sapporo and lamb dumplings!"}
{"text":"We went on a Thursday evening because of the great reviews.  Service was friendly and food arrived quickly.  You can also watch the ladies make the dumplings behind a glass window.  You were also told that they only take cash as you sat down. 
Now to the food...  We had soup dumplings (classic pork, pork with leeks and shrimp with cilantro), hot and sour soup, wonton noodle soup and the cucumber appetizer.  The different soup dumplings were all unremarkable.  I was also disappointed that the sauce that accompanies these dumplings was missing.  How can you have xiao long bao without the soy sauce with vinegar and julienned ginger?
The hot and sour soup was neither hot nor sour and the wonton soup was tasteless.  The cucumber dish was decent but it was a little wilted."}
{"text":"Go simple, get the traditional porc xiaolongbao. You'll be more than satisfied with the flavour-packed soup-filled dumplings served in steaming baskets. Use the spoon, sip the soup, careful it's hot. The broth is so tasty by itself that I enjoyed it plain without the soy and vinegar. Real food at this price? That's rare. 

The lamb and green onion fried dumplings, though not as novel, were quite good as well. Don't ask for tea. It's not free and not good (lol).

Very quiet, with tables and banquettes for groups. Service was quick on an early Saturday evening. Cash only or debit over $10. On a sidenote, the receipt says \"Qing Hua Dumpling\" with three addresses, Sammi and the other two Qing Hua must be related?"}
{"text":"I ordered the mushroom and cabbage dumplings thinking they would be soup dumplings, but they're just regular dumplings. I'll still give this place 4 stars, because the dumplings were still good and the waitresses are really nice. I was just disappointed because I was really looking forward to having soup dumplings."}
{"text":"We ordered the hot and sour cucumber, spicy tofu, classic xiao long bao, pork and crab xiao long bao, and the beef curry fried dumplings. All the food was very tasty. The skin on the dumplings was not too thick, which is hard to find, and the soupy goodness inside the dumpling was delicious. The only drawback was the non existent service. We had to ask for dumpling sauce that was on all the other tables, and never got a refill of water or our other beverages. So go for the food, but don't expect good service."}
{"text":"This 5 star review is based on the soup dumplings only.  If like me, you've been desperately searching for the elusive xiao long bao and been fooled by places like qing hua that falsely advertise soup dumplings, go to Sammi & Soupe!  They are the best I've found in Montreal - fresh, made to order, and you have the option of choosing different meats and stuffings.  I ordered the pork/coriander and chicken/mushroom.  Both were so soupy and delicious.  I also ordered the wonton soup and spicy pickled cucumber which were just so-so.  There were a couple cucumber pieces that were old and mushy and inedible - this seemed to be a problem for other reviewers as well.  

2 stars for the place itself as it was a bit dingy which is nothing new when it comes to restaurants like this, but the menus and tables were sticky and smelled weird.  The service was also a bit slow as well, but it's worth it for the dumplings in my opinion.  I'm looking forward to going back and trying other soup dumpling flavors and the fried dumplings."}
{"text":"Excellent choice for a delicious, cheap and authentic Chinese meal. It is actually my favourite dumpling place in the city at the moment. No other restaurants has their Xiaolongbao quite as authentic and soupy as these. The taste was just right: not too salty and not bland. The only reason why I'm giving a 4 is because I ordered the spicy shrimp wonton, but what they have me was some rather small sized wontons topped with a sweet hoisin sauce. I confirmed with the waitress that it was indeed my dish before I tried it. It was everything but spicy. It was just sweet. So I was kind of disappointed by that. But apart from that, I would recommend it. Personally, I would definitely go back, I just won't ever order the spicy wontons."}
{"text":"Yet another Montreal gem that made our trip all the worthwhile. Busy and always lively, the specialty soup dumplings are always at the top of my to-do list when I'm visiting. Yet once again, with the saturation of so many dumpling shops all through the city, their simple offerings and no non-sense service style push them to the top. This place is up on top with the best of the best, and I have not experience any place that can complete with this place, whether be Montreal or the GTA.

The Dumplings are little chubby nuggets that is bursting with juice and meat. What sets these dumplings apart from the rest is definitely the wrappers and had a nice chewiness to them; not too thick and just delicate and sturdy enough to contain all that mouthwatering goodness. Served with a dash of vinegar and chili oil just for that added kick. I love the classic pork, the lamb and coriander, the pork and crab, and the juicy pork with shrimps and scallops. 

I love this place. Prices impressively affordable, and quality exceeds expectations. I love that diners get a direct view into their dumpling making kitchen. We get to see the staff so expertly wrap each and every dumplings fresh. It was a nice satisfaction to watch the beginning to the time our dumplings were served to us. 

Definitely a place to experience. This is my favourite soup dumpling place ever, I'm only sad that I'm about 600 km away from enjoying some right now. I will be back next time and every time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"This place is great for a quick and easy lunch with friends. Beware if you're bringing people who don't know how to use chopsticks, it can be tricky since there are no other utensils besides a spoon. We brought my boyfriend's parents, and it was hilarious to see my father in-law use chopsticks! The dumplings are freshly made and well priced. I've been three different times and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We decided to go for dumplings this week, and stopped by Sammi & Soupe Dumpling on the way back home. As usual, we ordered pork/coriander and lamb/coriander dumplings. The pork ones came first and were delicious. The lamb dumplings came 5-10 minutes later. We each ate one, and stared at each other.

- Is this lamb?
- I think its pork.

We flagged the waiter, and told him there might have been a mistake. He brought the dumplings back to the kitchen, where a few staff members sampled them. He came back and said it was definitely lamb, but would prepare us another portion (no extra fee). I apologized, but was puzzled - lamb has such a unique taste, how did I miss it? Anyhow, the second serving came, and we happily started eating. The first dumpling was distinctively lamb, and so was the second. But the third and fourth tasted just like pork. The fifth was lamb again. Was I losing my sense of taste? Did they make a mistake again? Who knows, but I wasn't very happy about it.

I still think their food is good, but I don't really feel like going back anymore.

Note: They brought in new tables. A nice improvement!"}
{"text":"We were walking down Rue St. Catherine and trying to figure out what to eat.  We ended up walking quite far from St. Catherine and Peel because we were just wandering around and ended up seeing a big block of Asian restaurants including Chinese, Japanese and Korean food. 

We saw a quite few soup dumping places but decided on this one because of the overall reviews plus the price ($7.99 to $8.99 for 10 dumplings).  This is a great price because usually the soup dumplings are $5.99 for 6.  We had two orders of soup dumplings, I believe one was beef and the other was chicken.  Since I don't eat meat that often anymore, I may not be the best connoisseur for this, but my DC loved both of them as they were full of juice and flavour but not too salty.  There was a lot of natural meat flavour and the wrapping wasn't too starchy. 

We also ordered the wonton soup which was great.  The great thing about this place is that it's roomy, they have an open kitchen and the service is okay.  

Overall, pretty decent place for Chinese dumplings, however not too many vegetarian options."}
{"text":"Happy to discover this third Qing Hua dumpling house that serves delicious soup dumplings. The fried dumplings seemed a little dull after the excitement of trying not to burst the others. Picked up some frozen dumplings as well which appear to be the juicy kind sold at the Lincoln St. location. Inexpensive and fun."}
{"text":"I know I go to Montreal for Chinese food. Doesn't entirely make sense but you know what? Glad I checked his place out. Very central if you are staying at the Meridian on Sherbrooke st.

I really would have given this place a 5 star but I had a few iffy dishes...

So there's the recap:

1. This place is so cheap. You will be full having spent $13 with tip....
2. Skip the soup and the side dishes. I would have paid more for better soup!! The hot and sour soup was so starchy with a few pieces of tofu and seaweed. I also ordered the seaweed. That was just tons of sugar and vinegar....
3. Xiao long bao!!! That's what you want to get. I ordered the pork leek because that is my go to and the most traditional dumpling filling really. So what is a xiao long bao? It's a soup filled dumpling and they are really soupy! So watch out for your first bite.
4. Sauce... Ask for Ginger and mix it with black vinegar (this is how elitists and elites do it!!!) with a dash of soy sauce... You're welcome.

Until my next food adventure! Hiyay!"}
{"text":"Good Dumpling restaurant . We order mostly xiao long boa (steamed juicy pork dumpling). Not impressed with the fried varieties that were too salty and a little bit dry for our taste.

A small place that can be overcrowded in the evening."}
{"text":"Very yummy and cheap xiao long baos! I took the advice of fellow Yelpers and ordered the steamed dumplings filled with pork only. They were absolutely delicious! I've been to other restaurants where the skin was so delicate that it tore and leaked precious soup as soon as I would attempt to pick up the bun. I didn't have this problem here! The wrapper was thin yet had a nice bite to it while the filling was generous. I don't recommend the pan-fried beef curry dumplings as they were way too salty. The waitress was absent-minded but the food was so worth it that it won't prevent me from returning."}
{"text":"We went there for lunch because i was craving soup dumplings in like forever, i saw that this place had super good ratings so i had high expectations.

We ordered the classic pork soup dumplings and when they arrived i took a bite and realized they weren't fully cooked which is my biggest fear is to have food poisoning...

The waitress kindly sent them back. We also ordered a half serving of fried dumplings and they gave us a full serving... the waitress took care of it also 

The food is bland tasteless even uncooked!
After this messy experience i don't think it's worth going there."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my favourite places to go, especially on a colder day! There is just something so comforting with having steaming xiaolongbaos. The ones from Sammi's are delicious and soupy, reminding me of my hometown. Order the classic pork, you won't regret it! The beef and onion is also another favourite of mine. And yes, it's on the sweeter side and that's just a trademark of Southern Chinese cuisine (so don't go there if you're craving spicy food). 

Note. Order a cold Tsingtao beer with your steaming hot xiaolongbaos... mmm"}
{"text":"The famous Shanghai style dumpling place by the crew behind Qing Hua. After craving Xiao Long Bao forever, I've decided to give this place a try. we ordered the spicy tofu, the cold sesame noodles, the cucumber salad, the lamb dumplings, the pork, and the crab xiao long bao. 

The entrees were very average. The cold tofu, while being smokey, lacks any type of flavour. It was a clear case of missing salt. The dish lack a glue that gets it together.

The cold sesame noodles were acceptable, while a bit too sweet.

The cucumber salad was very cucumbery, and sour, just like how it should be.

The lamb dumplings were a total failure, by using the dough of the soup dumplings to make the normal dumplings, it falls apart, taste flat, and has absolutely no texture.

The soup dumplings were acceptable, and had a solid balance between the flavours.

Unlike most people on this page, our service was efficient and quick enough."}
{"text":"The best soup dumpling in Montreal. The waiters change all the time but the taste of the soup dumplings is always consistent. Great place for weekend lunch."}
{"text":"When people say soup dumplings, I immediately think of this place. It is situated in downtown between atwater and guy concordia.  We ordered the classic pork soup dumpling and the pork, leek and shrimp fried dumplings. Both were really tasty. The way I'm eating the soup dumpling: 1. make a hole in the dumpling.2. Pour the soup into the spoon.3. Drink it.4. Eat the whole dumpling. Voilà! 
I could say this is a good place when it's cold outside and you want to eat comfort food!"}
{"text":"Perfect place to get your ??? fix! 
We got the lamb and coriander, and sweet pork soup dumplings, and the beef curry pan fried dumplings.
Soup dumplings are what you'd expect: juicy, thin skinned, and flavourful. The lamb did not have a gamey flavour and tasted delicious. Sweet pork was my favourite though! The fried dumplings were just a bit smaller than I expected.
We went at 6pm on a Sunday night, but the fried buns and the majority of the pan fried dumplings were all sold out! Just settled with what's left on the menu. 
Service a bit slow, but you know, busy night so I'm not complaining.
Prices are amazing too! Would defo come here again.

(Pro tip: bite small hole on top, suck up the soup, drop vinegar into dumpling, and then consume the whole thing)"}
{"text":"ordered online from just-eat and honestly.....
wrong order!  They gave me this tofu and assorted vegetable dumplings when i ordered the shrimp egg and leek one.  The tofu one is really gross.  They didn't even give me a call back in case I wanted to change my order to something else or to cancel it.  I know you want to make money,  but don't do that to customers cause it leaves a bad experience for everyone and doesn't make you a trust worthy business.."}
{"text":"Many different types of xiao long bao!  Made right in front of you and each dumpling filled with a lot of soup.  We got the classic pork, shrimp pork and scallop and the lamb.  They were all delicious, had no problems with the service.  The cucumber appetizer was good as well.  Spicy and pickled cucumbers are an awesome compliment to the tasty soup dumplings.  I was surprised that this place wasn't packed.  Well, it was good for us since we don't like waiting in lines."}
{"text":"A very good place for lunch! I have been going there now for more than 10 times because it is really worth it.

Located near Concordia University in downtown Montreal, this place serves very affordable dumplings. As a consequence, it can get very crowded both at lunchtime and dinnertime. I mostly go there during lunch time because the prices are slightly lower (7$ for 10 dumplings vs 9$ for 10 dumplings).

The service at this place can get pretty bad sometimes, being understaffed at most times (eg. one waiter while the restaurant is packed). It might not be the greatest idea if you are in a rush. But the food does compensate for the not-so-great service. One other thing to keep in mind too, once you make your order already, it might take up to 15 minutes before your food arrives. 

Food-wise, I feel like this is as good xiaolongbao you can get in Montreal, especially for the price. Their variety is decent also, which includes different choices of meat (lamb, pork, shrimp). 

Overall, poor service, but very good value meal!"}
{"text":"Délicieux dumplings, saveurs originales, bon service. Tout est frais, fait à la commande. Définitivement, nous retournerons."}
{"text":"There's a lot of dumpling houses but not many that serves soup dumpling. So if you're looking for some soup dumpling, you've come to the right place! 

We ordered the pork classic soup dumpling here and also the cabbage and mushroom regular dumpling which were both really good. The cabbage and mushroom had a fantastic texture to it and surprisingly very flavorful for vegetarian dumpling. Also ordered a cold peanut noodle side which was average. Reminded me of dan dan but was a little under seasoned. Overall, would recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Sammi's place was really cute and casual from the outside and it caught my friends and my attention. We were from out of town and this seemed like a good place to check out, plus it seems to have high reviews on yelp.

Unfortunately I am someone who holds customer service really high and this place was quite disappointing and sad in this aspect. 

- go in and told to sit anywhere we like, but the make waiter ignores us right after that. Sitting there for over 10 mins, no menu, nothing. A friend goes up to the counter to ask for a menu to be shot down. He got shouted at that they will be there....simply rude.

- noticed a couple come in later after us, they are immediately given a menu and service...something wrong here?

Granted the Si Long Bao is really good, I would never recommend this place because its unsatisfying to eat a good meal in a setting with this kind of bad service."}
{"text":"The best xiaolongbao I've had in Montreal so far! Service was fair too, and prices were fair for the amount of food you get. I'll be back to satisfy my cravings!"}
{"text":"Super yummy xiao long bao! It gets packed pretty fast during lunch time and dinner time so get there early or be ready to wait. The prices are good and I never had any problems with the employees."}
{"text":"Les décor est pas terrible et l'endroit tout petit. Il vous faudra d'ailleurs attendre pour un table... Mais c'est un signe.... Si les gens attendent, c'est que c'est bon!
J'y ai mes habitudes au moins 2 fois par mois: soupe aigre piquante, concombre aigres et piquants, et enfin les dumping vapeur porc et coriandre.... Le bonheur total.
A essayer sans modération"}
{"text":"Great soup dumplings! As good as the ones I've had in New York City in Chinatown!  It is Canadian debit card or cash only prepared if you're not Canadian."}
{"text":"Sammi is owned by the folks at Qing Hua, but (according to the staff) specializing in southern Chinese, Shanghai-style soup-filled dumplings, xiao long bao, versus the northern-style dumplings served at Qing Hua. The beef and onion and the pork and leek were delicious. The service was friendly, helpful, super quick and kind. They have a couple basic beers and some inexpensive salads on the menu, but we didn't try any. We had the dumpling craving, and we ate all the dumplings, and it was glorious. 

If you haven't eaten xiao long bao before let me save you the emphatic mess that I was the first time: let the soup pour out of the dumpling into the big spoon they give you. Rather than let it explode all over you. Pro tip."}
{"text":"I'm a big soup dumping fan, and let me tell you, this place is GREAT! We went for lunch on a rainy Monday afternoon and the place was still pretty busy. They have a lunch special menu with mainly all of the dinner menu items. 

We ordered the pork wonton soup (it was small but yummy!) and then lamb/coriander soup dumplings along with pork/coriander soup dumplings. Both were amazing and had such interesting flavor to it. The dough was good, but not too chewy and the soup inside was delicious.

I would definitely come back here again and try the fried dumplings! It's so cool to see the ladies in the kitchen actually freshly making your order..."}
{"text":"I would give this place a 3/3.5
The star of the show is obviously the delicious soup dumplings. The broth arrives not too hot, very fatty and super tasty. The dough is not too thick but not too thin, which is perfect for noobs like me who break them easily. The service is what is lacking. While yes, I shouldn't be expecting much from a chinese restaurant (i'm chinese so I can say that! lol), it's just not fun to be ignored. The place itself also isn't great: tables are crammed and expect to wait 5-10 mins on busy evenings. Aside from that, I highly recommend it over their other spot Qing Hua in chinatown. I went here twice in one week when I first discovered it!"}
{"text":"I can't go a weekend without an Asian fix, so I stopped by this dumpling joint on my trip in Montreal. I was surprised to see them offer so many options for SOUP dumpling (usually it's just pork or pork with crab). I was skeptical, but ordered pork with leek soup dumplings to try. Mistake - pork and leek should stay being regular dumplings. The classic pork soup dumplings were very good - on par with some of the better places I've tried. We split three orders total between two people and left pretty full. I think this place was cash and Canadian debit only."}
{"text":"The first two times I went, the food was delicious.  I ordered the juicy lamb coriander and it was sooo yummy with lots of coriander.  I also ordered the juicy pork & leek which was good but not as flavorful.  

The third time I went on a Sunday, being so in love with the juicy lamb and coriander, I ordered it again.  It was so disappointing. The service was horribly slow even though the resto wasn't that busy. Then the dumplings came looking pretty pathetic cause they really  flattened out like a big puddle.  The dough consistency was too thin.  There was little coriander in the mix so I was quite sad about that. 

I don't know if on weekends they have different cooks but it was not as good as the first times I went during the week!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is small and dirty. The service is so so but the xiao long baos are definitely really good for Montreal. These soup dumplings are steamed piping hot and when you  pick up with your spoon you are suppose to suck out the juices before you eat it. Sometimes when I order the dumplings the outer skin is broken so the juice isn't inside anymore and it makes me so mad. If the skin is broken then they should give you new ones that are properly made, it is called \"soup dumpling\" for a reason. At this type of restaurant in Vancouver this would never happen. This restaurant is worth trying out if you never had xiao long bao(soup dumpling)."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how it happened but I ate at quite a few dumpling houses this trip. I guess you can never have too many dumplings right? Well, Mon and I met up for an early Monday night dinner. The weather was spitting rain outside so it was nice to take comfort inside. 

The place is pretty compact but it's cool how you can see the workers making the dumplings fresh in the kitchen. You can bring a bag of dumplings home (30 pieces for $10.35 - 15.00). 

The menu is split into three: appetizers and soups, XLB's and pan fried dumplings. I love me some XLB's but I've never seen so many varieties for it. I'm a traditionalist though so when it comes down to it, always go with the classic.

- Cold noodles with peanut sauce ($2.99) - the noodles were passable but the flavour was pretty lacklustre. I wasn't a huge fan of the peanut sauce, which tasted watered down.

- Juicy pork (classic) (J1) ($6.99) - 10 XLB's for only $7! Are you kidding me??? What a steal. These were a satisfying take on the classic soup dumpling. Juicy, a pleasantly thin wrapper and balance of flavours. 

- Pork, leek and shrimp (F4) ($8.99) - they were already out of most of their pan fried options but we were still able to try one type. These were on the small side and I wished they'd been crisped longer. That being said, they were still tasty and you do get 15 pieces. 

Another solid spot in the ever expanding options of Chinatown 2. Love this area. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"So I've eaten here at Sammi Soupe dumpling a couple of times the last few months and here's my lowdown. 

Order the cucumber dish as an appetizer. It's freaking amazing. Like eating sweet Chinese style pickles which are crunchy and are in a sweet chilli style sauce. They are crunchy tasty delicious. Also tell mom you had your veggies for the meal! Then you can fill your tummy with XLB. 

Xiao long bao (Shanghai style soupe dumplings) rules supreme here. They are a pretty good value and loads of selection. The first time I ordered the shrimp pork and scallop.  It was a mistake as these ones were smaller. Then I ordered the #1 pork classic ones on the menu just this evening. The pork or beef ones are more generous in size and are juicy and freshly made in the glass cube window. I'd recommend avoiding the XLB's with seafood in them as they are just smaller portions. 

Also we had tried a plate of chicken fried dumplings. They were piping hot, crunchy and generous in size. Let them cool down or risk burning that roof of your mouth. Overall not the best dumplings I've sampled, however for the price they are more than adequate. 

Free wifi code available. 

 NO credit card sign clearly marked at cash register. Cash or Interac only. 

Pints of beer are available as well as Chinese beer if this is to your game plan for the evening. 

Overall the XLB is a 3.75/5- you would have to go to Toronto or Din Tai Fung for better ones but these are some of the better ones in MTL. 

The place is by no means glamorous. It's cavernous and loud when the restaurant is full of hungry young student crowd. The tables could be described as somewhat closer together also.If you can stomach the basic decor and loud place the XLB is worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Soup Dumplings!

REAL SOUP DUMPLINGS!

So, it's pretty hard to find real soup dumplings anywhere, and they do not exist at this price point on this continent. 

We made the mistake of ordering the pickled cucumbers (slimy and underwhelming), and the hot and sour soup (chicken egg drop soup, with some fungus); normally, this would kill their chances, but the soup dumplings were hot, fresh and fast. They have thin skins and are full of soup, and full of meat too! The fried ones are a little underwhelming, but if they are your jam, then they aren't bad (just not as good as the steamed ones). The flavours they are actually come through, so shrimp and pork, you can actually taste the shrimp and pork. 

Alcohol is cheap and cold, so that's just an added bonus! Service is fast and turnaround is quick, so don't worry too much about the ever present line."}
{"text":"On top of having delicious soup dumplings, their service is great. I was pretty much the worst pick up customer and the woman on the phone responded to me like a champ. I ordered, came almost an hour late to pick it up, and the cashier was so kind and understanding. On top of that, I gave her an extra $5 bill without knowing it and she chased me down the cold, winter street to return the $5 to me! This is now my go-to dumpling place. Before this experience, I already really liked their dumplings, but the customer service makes it a top choice for me."}
{"text":"120% Excellent soup dumplings here. Undisputed soup dumpling champ. How many ways can I put it? this is 5 stars all the way. 

I have been to Sammi & Soupe many many many times over the last 7 years, and it's only gotten busier. Now there are perpetually line-ups out the door, no matter what hour of the day it is. 

Lunch time prices are a little cheaper, starting at $7 for a basket averaging $9 a basket. All of the choices are phenomenal, but the seafood one and the sweet pork one are both stand outs. I will also note that their sour / spicy cucumber appetizer is pretty amazing. 

Their chili oil is also notable - strong flavour but not too spicy, perfect for those soup dumplings. 

This is the place to go for soup dumplings. Don't miss this for the world!!"}
{"text":"Cheap and delicious soup dumplings!

This place makes soups dumplings on the spot, offering fresh batches every time. My favourite has to be the pork and coriander steamed soup dumplings, and the beef and onion. Depending on which dumpling you get, the beef and pork are always more juicy and flavourful, and have a good amount of soup inside, while others like the leek, egg and shrimp dumplings are less juicy. 

This place tends to get packed during the weekend, especially in the evening, fair warning. The wait time isn't the fastest but not the slowest either, taking about 20-25mins for the food to arrive, considering they make your dumplings by hand and then steam or fry them."}
{"text":"4 étoiles, 1 mot : DUMPLING. 

Wow. Définitivement, leurs Xiao long bao (petite soupe-dumpling) valent le détour. Ils sont littéralement comme on les imagine : plus tendres et juteux que les dumplings 'pliés' réguliers.
Également, lors de notre passage, nous avons essayé la soupe aigre-douce et dumpling. Nous n'avons pas été déçus !  

Il ne faut vraiment pas se fier à l'allure du commerce : petite table en bois, chaise dur, pas de décorations. L'endroit est toujours plein, même un lundi soir. 

Le service est horrible et pratiquement unilingue (malgré quelque bribres d'anglais). Mais bon, qui a jamais été dans un restaurant asiatique pour un service 5 étoiles ?  

On y retourne"}
{"text":"TLDR: Juicy tasty soup dumplings in the Concordia area.

Small, lovely, place to get some yummy soup dumplings. The beef and onion are my favourite steamed dumplings, while the leek and chicken are my favourite fried ones. They are great on a winter night, but unfortunately, the dumplings get cold quick in the winter from everyone who wants to get in the restaurant. Clearly, it's a very good place as the door opened non-stop.

The cold peanut noodles were average, but the hot and sour cucumbers are a great starter and a treat in between dumplings

I've enjoyed every one of my visits to Sammi and Soupe Dumplings. The service is quick and efficient. They also have a window into their kitchen so you can watch them make your dumplings!"}
{"text":"The best part about the meal was how cheap it was. 

I was pretty disappointed that they were out of both their vegetarian dumpling fillings (it was about 7pm on a Tuesday night). I ended up ordering a large hot&sour soup and enviously glaring at my friend's dumplings.The soup was great but nothing to call home about. I also tried out the spicy bean curd which was difficult to eat and lacking in excitement. 

The service was best described as hostile. What struck me was how slow they were to clear up our dishes. It was also cash-only that night so I wouldn't go in expecting to pay with card."}
{"text":"Food: 7/10. Tastes decent xlb broth was quite good, xlb skin was too thick for my taste though.
Fried pork dumplings were nice and crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside. 
Waiting time at door: 5mins (I was there at 6pm on Saturday)
Service: a solid 2/10 (management decided to have 1 waiter for the whole restaurant). Serving time slow, orders forgotten, appetizers came in last. Waiter asked my grandmother to shift seat because the restaurant was getting too cramped (wth)
Overall- 6/10 ign"}
{"text":"This may be one of the better dumpling places in Montréal. As a vegetarian, it's quite rare to find veg dumplings and this place hits the mark with their mushroom and vegetable soup dumplings. Also, their lunch menu makes for an incredibly satisfying and affordable meal!"}
{"text":"Another great dumpling place in the city. Steamed dumplings, I love that and it really how it should be done. They serve soup dumplings which can be harder to eat and are not my favourite type in dumplings but it doesn't change the fact they do a great job and a good price. I would go back again and again because there is a lot of choice."}
{"text":"Nourriture super bonne et authentique (je suis chinoise), par contre le service a beaucoup à désirer. Les deux serveuses semblent indifférentes envers les gens qui attendent et assigner la table parfois pas par ordre, sans mentionner elle a oublié une partie de notre commande...Donc l'expérience au complet était un peu décevant. Bien sûr ça se peut que c'est seulement moi et seulement aujourd'hui :P"}
{"text":"I love the soup dumpling here. Came on a Saturday dinner time, this place was packed. Waited around 10 mins. 
We two girls ordered two soup dumpling and the portion is perfect. we had pork with seafood and lamb with corridor. The lamb one is so lamb if you know what I mean.
There are some tech in the process of eating. First the sauce: one portion of soy sauce plus three portions of chinese vinegar. add chili oil as you like. Second, the waiting time before you have the first one, the first ones will be very hot so lift them up with chopsticks or finger tips, put it on the spoon and blow it to cool, take a tiny bite on the skin but not to drink the soup, blow it a little to let the steam inside out and then suck the soup inside, and then eat the whole thing. The first ones can be very hot, The first ones can be very hot, repeated.The dumpling should always sit on the spoon. After the first one, the temperature is probably good to go."}
{"text":"Luke warm soup dumplings and the fried dumplings tastes as if they fried it, let it sit awhile then served it to us.. it was not good...... very disappointed..."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food, tasty and the waiting time was not too long (~20 mins).
I ordered to go, so I can't really tell about the service quality, what I can tell as a heads up for visitors of Canada:
They do not accept any not Canadian credit or debit card, and they take the CAD & USD 1 to 1 
And the hostess do not understand pretty well English
* I will definitely return  (with Canadian cash tho)"}
{"text":"I live in the area and come here for soup dumplings when I don't feel like cooking and want something filling, but isn't too expensive. 

I always order the cucumber salad to start - as one user said \"very cucumbers and sour, just how it should be\".

I always opt for the lamb and coriander soup dumplings. Always. 
Juicy and delicious, their portions are perfect and the price is even better. 

Service isn't great and they often sell out of things, but I'm glad I have this joint in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"I love this place for cheap and plentiful dumplings. A little lacking in vegetarian options if you're not a huge fan of egg, though!

I always get a mix of fried & soup dumplings, because honestly I can't choose between them. I recommend sharing, as well - you'll want to try as many as possible!"}
{"text":"Somebody on Chowhound had recommended this place as being a top soup dumpling spot. I had to check it out. 

The service was pretty darn unfriendly, but the food was excellent. Chinese dumpling chefs handcraft your dumplings behind an open glass-windowed kitchen. 

I got the classic pork dumplings and the flavors were spot on. The pork had a nice texture, unctuous broth teeming with porky goodness. There was just enough balance in the meat blend of aromatics to nicely compliment the fattiness of the pork. 

All around a very good deal for 6 (or 8?) dumplings. 

I'd definitely advise you check this place out for the dumplings."}
{"text":"Soup dumplings were so good! This would've been my go-to-spot on cold days if Iived here. It was cozy and nice, and I could finish those dumplings in seconds!"}
{"text":"I am a very big fan of dumplings, I discovered this place through a friend. It is one of those restaurant that you won't probably go to unless you lived in the neighborhood. Looks like any random Chinese restaurant but I was very impressed by the quality of their dumplings. There were made fresh and had enough soup/filling in them. We ordered the cucumber salad and tofu and they were both delicious. If you are looking for a low key, cheap dinner, this is a great place"}
{"text":"This is a great little dumpling restaurant located in the heart of downtown and so cheap ! Its not huge inside but the decor is casual and comfortable and clean inside. The service was quick and friendly and the dumplings were really tasty and well prepared. We were lucky to be seated when we arrived because minutes later the place was full and had a lineup. We tried the pork+cilantro and the beef +onion (One fried and one steamed). Both dumplings were delicious, the steamed order was filled with soup and the other order was fried.  They did run out of shrimp (which I thought was a little odd in the middle of the day on a Saturday) but even so, the experience was a good one. I will definitely be back here again to try more of their items and I would recommend this place to any dumpling fan to curb that craving!"}
{"text":"My favorite soup dumpling place! Insanely delicious and well priced! Friendly staffs too!"}
{"text":"The food was decent, but not worth the ridiculously long wait. One Saturday night, I walked in and ordered two take-out dishes. Nothing too fancy, just classic xiao long bao and won ton noodle soup. I waited forty five long minutes at the cash for my food. Yes, I understand they make everything to order, and yes, it was busy but the restaurant was not full when I arrived. 
We enjoyed the food okay. The dumplings were nice and juicy, but to me they did not taste very traditional - they were a tad too gingery or something. Also, the won ton soup and dumplings were bland and the broth had seaweed pieces floating around in them, something which I have never seen. In my opinion, only the XLB were good (avoid the soup) but overall not worth the wait especially if you're in a hurry or expecting quick service. Just a tip, they also don't take credit cards here, and cash only for purchases under $10."}
{"text":"We started off on the wrong foot with Sammi. We waited close to an hour for a take out order the first time we visited. But the dumplings were SO GOOD, so bursting with brothy flavorful magic, that we had to give them a second chance. We never had another bad experience!

My absolute favorite is the classic steamed pork. I admire restaurants that stick to a few items and do them perfectly. These dumplings are perfect! It took me a while to get the hang of eating them, with my sorry chopstick skills, but now I'm a dumpling-eating champion! 

After sampling a few other surrounding dumpling restaurants, I'm confident that these dumplings are the only ones for me!"}
{"text":"I always enjoy coming to eat at Sammi & Soupe Dumplings! Their dumplings are very unique and are offered in many flavors - steamed or fried, also at affordable prices. The only downside is the wait line and the place is too small. Sometimes, the service can be slow. But, it's all definitely worth the try."}
{"text":"As xiao long bao as it gets. Good soup dumplings and even the hot and sour soup was good. The wait for the dumplings take quite a while (15-20 mins) because they make it as you order. Worth it! No credit, cash or debit only."}
{"text":"Sweet Pork soup dumplings! Yes, you heard me right. When I first saw it on the menu I was like \"Eww. Sweet and Pork don't usually appear in the same sentence.\" But my friend who frequents this restaurant highly recommended it. And I'm so glad she did. It was not the dessert sweet that I imagined, but more of a meaty sweet that complimented the flavor really well. Besides the sweet pork soup dumplings we also ordered the pork & cilantro, and pork & shrimp. And lamb & cilantro potstickers, whose wrappers were a little dry and tough. 

Since we don't have soup dumplings in Halifax I savoured every bite of this. Are they the highest quality soup dumplings I've had? Nope, but for $6.99/steamer(lunch price), I can't complain. They were surprisingly filling too. They're made to order so there's about a 10-15 minute wait., and the restaurant fills up quickly. Highly recommend, especially when you have a hankering for some authentic steamed soup dumplings."}
{"text":"Food was ok but we won't return because of the service.  There are too many dumpling choices in the neighbourhood to make this the only option.  It doesn't even come close to being as good as Mademoiselle Dumpling on St Hubert for instance.  

No smiles, little to no eye contact and we were ignored so long standing at the cash register that we considered pretending to leave without paying to see if they'd acknowledge us.  

In the end, I added up the tab and taxes myself and left the money on a a tip tray that I purposefully placed next to one of the unaffected employees.  

My dinner companion was peeved that I left a tip."}
{"text":"The fried Pork & Cabbage Dumpling were really good (9/10) but the Pork Classique Steamed Dumpling were not my taste (4/10). Over all it was really affordable so you should try !"}
{"text":"One of the newest dumpling joints in the city, following the trend of the numerous Mandarin Chinese cuisine restaurants hat opened in the past years. Sammi, just like Qinghua and its successors, boasts about its soup dumpling, or xiaolongbao (???), hailing from the city of Shanghai, in southern China. Whereas Qinghua's own soup dumplings are also very rich in broth, they are folded in a Northern Chinese fashion, while Sammi's are pleated like it is in Shanghai. I ordered the pork xiaolongbao and the pork panfried dumplings, and even though my expectations weren't that high, I wasn't entirely satisfied by the execution of the food.

A bit bigger than expected and their skin being much thicker and starchier than I'm used to, the xiaolongbao were served fresh and piping hot in a bamboo basket. For newbies, the store owners were kind enough to leave a how-to pamplet at each table to help them mix the dipping sauce and eat the dumplings. The broth was satisfyingly dripping after the first bite, rich and savoury. The meat filling was salted to meet expectations and it complemented the taste of the dough. However, I find the saltiness a bit too overwhelming for this type of dumpling, especially since they're dipped in a mixture of black vinegar, soy sauce and chili oil.

The panfried dumplings are a total letdown: the meat was unexpectedly really salty and the dough was too chewy for comfortable eating. The extra oil added to the dumplings during the frying step was dampening the dough, stealing away its usual crispiness. Usually, dumplings are let to drip before being served, but since it was during lunch rush hour I guess this step could've been skipped.

Sammi might not deliver the best xiaolongbao I ever had, but it's one of the only two places I know in the city that offer proper xiaolongbao, made according to the Shanghai fashion. I will come back whenever I feel nostalgic about the Pearl of the Orient, but otherwise the other regular dumplings aren't worth the detour."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try some Xiao Long Bao while in Montreal! I found this place and decided it was a must visit. The place is a bit odd.... you wait in a long line out the door for a table. Service is nothing exciting. They had a lot of dumplings, but they were out of many that we wanted (unfortunately). We ended up getting a pan fried curry spiced dumpling (not terrible, but not great), the juicy pork (delish), the cold noodles (ehhhh would pass on this), and a juicy beef (tasty, but no pork). I would definitely come back here, but maybe come earlier as to not miss out on the full variety of dumplings."}
{"text":"Huge tasty dumplings for not a lot of money.  And you get to see them make it in front of you so you know it's fresh.   I preferred the pork with leek, but the classic pork and the fried chicken dumplings were very well flavored.  Strongly recommend for dinner or snack!"}
{"text":"This place is probably the best place for soup dumplings in Montreal! Anytime I introduce someone to Sammi & Soup Dumpling, I create a new addict. The menu is simple and not over the top, the prices are absolutely affordable, and the dumplings are alway fresh. 
The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is because one time, the dumplings tasted a little bit like hand lotion, and since they are hand rolled, it's possible one of the employees put on some lotion before making the dumplings. It was a little off putting, but this has only ever happened once. Despite this, I have constantly returned for soup dumplings. 

P.S. prepare for a wait if heading here on a Friday or Saturday night. Usually the line is out of the door, but it is well worth the wait!"}
{"text":"10 xiao long bao (soup dumplings) for only 6.99$?!

Brief summary of what I took: 
I've been here twice now in under 24h, and I must say, the classic pork soup dumplings are reaaal tasty. So far, I've tried:
Soup dumplings: classic pork (4.5/5), pork and leek (3/5), chicken and mushroom (3.5/5)
Fried dumplings: lamb and green onions (4/5).
Shanghai Fried Buns (3/5)
Tea: charging 2$ wtf

The classic pork turns out to be the best. I thought the pork and leek might be even better, which is why I returned a second time, ordering classic pork and 'pork and leek' for a side to side comparison. The pork and leek dumplings is a loony more expensive, but tastes a tad worse -_-

The classic pork dumplings contained such nice tasting broth, I'm starting to think it's MSG overload because the broth seems so clear and simple I can't comprehend its source of flavour  and, pardon my modesty, because I've never made any broth close to this gud :') 


Anyway, it's a good place for 2nd-3rd time dates, because it can get... inelegant. There is quite a protocol to follow in order to get the dumpling from the basket to your mouth in a secure manner. This aforementioned flowchart is printed and located somewhere on the table. I strongly suggest first timers to follow it by the letter."}
{"text":"Finally a place to get my Xiao long boa fix. I go to toronto but no more. Their spice also is 5 star along with the smile and service which you do not get at most other chinese dumpling places. Although I have never seen lamb XLB in china they make them here and I love them. The pork are just as good but as a Greek we love lamb. I can have it on anything,"}
{"text":"I have been to this place 5-6 times now. I am from Shanghai and I have to say this is the first place I have found in Montreal that serves decent xiao long bao (little dragon soup dumplings), which comes close to the authentic ones you get in Shanghai. 

HOWEVER, the service is amongst the worst I have experienced, even for Chinese restaurant standards. Last time I was here, I ordered the jellyfish, seasoned cucumber, xiao long bao and the Shanghai fried bun (Sheng Jian Bao).

When we sat down at our table, it took about 20 mins before we got our water and here is the \"best\" part, the water we go was actually the water that our neighbouring table had. I watched one of the waitress bring the water to the next table, leave, then get called back because the table next to us wanted room temperature water. I then watched the waitress pick those cups of water, turn around and place those same cups of water on our table. She then walks away as if nothing happened. I was completely shocked. Even if a place is popular and cheap and has good xiao long bao, this should never be done. It is unsanitary.

If you think this is bad, then just wait and keep reading.

The cucumber we ordered were fully mushy, and it tasted fermented. I know that these cucumbers are soaked chili oil for flavour, but I don't think they should taste carbonated and mushy as if they were made last week and left out all week.
The jellyfish was decent, but a bit on the salty side.
The xiao long bao were pretty good, but tasted less soup filled than usual and less hot.  I feared after that they were not steamed long enough, but thankfully, the pork looked cooked and I did not get sick after.

The best (or worst) part was the Shanghai fried bun. I watched the cook place it in the frier and I also watched him take it out.  I then heard him comment to the waitress in Chinese that these Shanghai fried buns were not like the usual batches he makes.  I watched him leave it on the counter for about 10min, before the waitress decide to serve it to us anyways. The cook was right, it did look a bit odd. I opened one up and of course, I could see raw pork and uncooked dough.  At this point in time, I called the waitress over and pointed out that the Shanghai fried bun was still raw inside.  Instead of apologizing, she instead gave me a dirty look when I asked if I can have a new pair of chopsticks.  The waitress took the buns and walked to the front, where she pokes around into the bun and confirm with the cook in Chinese that the pork was indeed raw.

At this point in time, any other restaurant would have at least ask me if I would like a new batch made and apologized for any in conveniences. I understand, stuff like this happen even in the best restaurants and its ok if it only happens once or twice and they handle the situation properly.  But at this place, instead of of making a new batch, they took the half open Shanghai fried buns that was on our table, stick them back into the frier and then return them to our table.  

I was completely shocked and very upset.  First of all, they have ruined the Shanghai fried bun, which is also a specialty dish from Shanghai. Secondly, it is just unacceptable for them to behave in such a manner to customers and also handle food like this.

I had a hard time deciding which star rating to give this place...

For the xiao long bao alone, I would give this place a 4 star rating, but for eveything else, they deserve  a 1 star rating at the most and I hope for the customer's sake, they improve their food safety. I hope that no ones has to go home with gastro...

I am still undecided if I want to go back to this place. If you do go, watch what you are getting carefully."}
{"text":"After I came back from my trip to China, I've been craving xiaolongbao. When I found this place (on yelp!) and saw that they had a bunch of great reviews, I was so excited! 

I suggested it to my boyfriend and he seemed pretty interested, so we came. We came on a thursday, but it was still pretty crowded. Luckily for us, we came fairly early, so we got a table immediately. 

The back of my chair was touching the chair of the person sitting behind me and it was almost impossible for people to pass between tables. 

We ordered the lamb and corriander as well as the traditional pork. 

We ate the lamb first and it was quite yummy! I was pretty happy with the flavour. 
However, the pork was rather bland and didn't really taste like anything. That was quite a let down.

Another thing that dissapointed me was the fact that the skin kept breaking. The entire point of xiaolongbao is to have that nice broth. If the skin breaks, the broth is obviously going to run out. 

The staff was okay. They worked quickly, but they seemed a little hectic, which made me feel rushed. 

When it came time to pay, we had to go to the register, which I don't mind at all. However, because there's no real line, the customers seemed confused and there was inadvertent line cutting. 

The meal was fairly cheap though. 10 xiaolongbao came to 9 or 10$. 

Overall, I was pretty dissapointed. The skin breaking, the bland pork, the cramped space and feeling rushed made my entire dining experience less than great. However, I will proably go back at some point to try it out again to see if I get a better experience."}
{"text":"Came here twice during our trip to Montreal. Unreal soup dumplings - juicy, flavourful, piping hot. Ordered pork and leek (9/10), pork shrimp and scallop (8/10), lamb and coriander (9.5/10). All three were fantastic. Service can be slow at times but you know your dumplings are freshly made."}
{"text":"Very quick service and extremely cheap!!! Only $7 for 10 dumplings!!!! And they are huge dumplings!

They are tasty if you haven't ate xiao long bao before. And especially delicious if you don't compare with, say, real ones. 

They are very bland, both the soup and the meat are almost tasteless. The dumping dough is very thick like bao's. The soup has the authentic flavour, perhaps 10% and 90% water. 

The lamb is quite alright!

The restaurant is small and very busy. The floors are quite dirty. Tables are close together. Very good service! For the price, definitely valuable.

However for this quality, I would rather make them at home."}
{"text":"I'm an avid dumpling fan. Soup dumpling at Sammi was okay. I have eaten in Hong Kong and NYC Chinatown soup dumplings so I can compare too Sammi. It's probably the best around town but there fried dumpling is pretty good. We had the pork and leek fried dumplings, I would recommend this and for the soup dumpling we had the classic pork soup dumpling and the beef and onion soup dumpling. Fried Dumpling is the way to go! The service was pretty slow, we waited for 20 mins for our 3rd entree to come out. Overall, it's good in town and price is fair. I would go back and eat there fried dumplings!"}
