{"text":"For 7.50 you get far more food than you'd expect from other Asian restaurants in the area, also with it being a fusion restaurant you're not limited in sauce choices"}
{"text":"Lorain, Ohio like you've never seen! Come, enjoy their asian inspired menu and the amazing vibe!"}
{"text":"What a great find in Lorain!  For a modest price of $7.50 you get veggie-ful, healthy, fresh, and flavorful ethnic dishes made to order with creative made-on-the-premises sauces.  The fried plantains appetizer was the best I've ever tasted anywhere -- crispy and light.  Pure perfection.  Had a nice chat with the nice chef (who takes pride in her cooking and will make anything gluten free for you upon request) and the friendly co-owner of this new restaurant.  We were in town visiting family, and hope this little spot succeeds in spades so we can dine there again next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Great place.  Food was spot on!!! All sauces homemade. Korean bbq delicious. Pho was great also.  Good draft beer selection. Owner and staff are passionate about this place.  We will be back. Don't past this place up... Try it!!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Friendly service, chef is very personable. This Asian fusion restaurant is one of the best place I've eaten at."}
{"text":"Love, love, LOVE this place!!  A relaxing, interesting dining area, but that's just the beginning.  Extremely reasonable prices and the food is incredible.  I highly recommend the Filipino spring rolls (four to an order) with a coconut dipping sauce I think I could just drink.  The basket dinners are delicious....a base of fluffy na'an bread topped with rice in Korean soy sauce (very tasty), then you choose beef, chicken or tofu for your protein (I opt for none) and a sauce/veggie mix that goes over the rice.  I'm working my way through all the sauce/veggie combo and like the Korean BBQ best.  I've never had pho before and when I saw it was added to their menu I gave it a shot.  My new favorite thing to eat!!  I hope Lorain appreciates what it has in this restaurant!"}
{"text":"What not to like? Well maybe Dessert!!! Please    but the food has always been so good and the service its welcoming love the design on the place its my kinda taste and its close to my home so i hope they dont close ever to keep coming back and also they need chairs for babies."}
{"text":"First time here and my wife and I loved it!  It's a little hidden gem in the neighborhood but well worth it!"}
{"text":"Omg... Dabu truly is Lorain's secret gem! It's such an escape from ordinary food selections. It's an experience worth the trip. The food, ambiance, music & hospitality is well worth the trip! Our food was absolutely delicious! I can go in & just dine on the appetizers.... Yum! Owners, Dave & Jose Ramirez, were so great! Please check out their website! They offer free dancing lessons, ballroom, foxtrot, tango....And they have fantastic bar! #satisfiedcustomer"}
{"text":"The food is a breath of fresh air not only for Lorain but in general!!! So very fresh and flavorful!! Excellent place for lunch!!!"}
{"text":"Me and my husband absolutely love this place. It however is not a place for children. It is more of an after hours lunch/dinner spot. I love the atmosphere and the decor is unique. This place offers healthier options then what's available in the area, also if you're looking for something different I personally love the twist they take on the Asian style food. The staff is extremely nice and the owner actually take the time out to always greet his customers. Omg and the pho is amazing. The last we had the pad thai and the plum BBQ rice bowl.. AH-mazing."}
{"text":"Phenomenal! The service, food quality, and atmosphere made this a definite must go! My buddy and I had potstickers (tofu with cabbage,) and for our mains had vegan versions of the Korean BBQ and Indian Masala both which were presented very clean and tastefully. Had a mojito to boot, just as good as the meal. And it was all rather affordable in comparison to most of your average eateries these days! An amazing little gem in Lorain, I highly recommend it! The chef even came out to ask us how are meal was and our thoughts on everything, very personable and up-front! But the 5th star really goes to the \"Chinese Chillin\" playlist, haiku we were asked to write afterwards that went up on one their walls near the entrance, and ballroom/swing dancing they offer on Saturday nights from 9p-12a!"}
