{"text":"My experience at Reds Diner was terrible. After a 15 minute wait to be seated our server served us coffee (which cost $3.00 for a small mug and tasted horrible) then we spent the next 15 min or so waiting for our server to come back. When she finally came back she actually told us that she \"forgot about us\", and not in an apologetic way. Our food sat in the window for at least 8 min as our server was counting cash in her wallet. When we got our food she forgot my pancake. I had to ask for it. At the end of our meal we told her we were going to pay with debit, she grabbed the machine then left it at the empty table beside us and went off to talk to other tables. The food was ok, but the service was terrible. I would strongly encourage others to try other diners over this one!"}
{"text":"We finally got the chance to pop in on Friday afternoon and we were delighted. The view is lovely and our server was adorable. We ordered breakfast and dessert and we were blown away! Absolutely delicious!!! Luckily, we came at a slow time so the wait for food was very reasonable.   The prices are a bit steep and the drinks/sodas are not refillable but our server was very quick to grab us waters and keep 'em topped up, so we were pleased!   We will definitely be back, no question. Great work, guys!"}
{"text":"Discovered this beauty of a diner through a friend. Wow! The decor and ambiance make you want to sit here all day! Our friendly server hooked us up with coffees and menus along with the lunch specials.  Had the Italian sub and soup. Awesome! Dining buddy had crepes, which looked appetizing! My sandwich, lightly toasted with melty cheese, was stacked with at least three typical Italian deli meats one of which must have been a spicy cappicolo. Two words: dee licious! Soup was a potato bacon - flavourful and rich. All in all, a very filling meal for 13 bucks!! Coffee was nice too!  According to my friend, the crepes were tasty and light. I thought the presentation was nice. I don't think he was over-full as he was considering round 2. No matter, he was happy with the choice.  I can't wait to bring my Co-dining Babe here! The server suggested that Saturdays after 1 pm  are a little less busy. I want to sit at the counter!!"}
{"text":"We love coming to Red's in Ramsay! We usually head there later in the morning to avoid the craziness, but we have never been disappointed. The vegan tofu scramble is delicious, the coffee fresh and un-burned, and the service is always excellent. Definitely worth the drive from the 'burbs."}
{"text":"Went there today with the hubby after reading some good reviews...the food was amazing, the service was not the best...I think our waiter forgot we were there after we finished our meals...I had to ask for the bill....and then waited probably 20 minutes with our jackets on waiting to pay and get food boxed up...which he also seemed to have forgot about and left it on the counter.  We would definately go back, but hopefully a different server next time.  The Reuben and the Smoked Meat Hash are both very very good!"}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped in for a Friday lunch a few weeks ago.  It was very cold outside but Red's was still very busy and I can see why.  The food was marvelous and the staff was friendly and efficient.  The only complaint was we were given our bill without being asked if we would like dessert.  Now I sure didn't need dessert but if I had been asked I would have jumped at it as me and dessert are the best of friends!  I can't wait to come back for breakfast."}
{"text":"Came in for New Years Day brunch and expected a long wait.  Despite the waiting, the service and food totally made up for it!  The host at the front was exceptional.  He was very organized and kept checking in frequently to ensure that everyone was on the list, that the coffee up front was available and kept us informed with the time of waiting.  I was impressed.  Once we got our table, our hostess was really great as well.  She was very nice and knew to check in just enough times to ensure that all was well and yet give us time to eat as well.    The service kept being exceptional throughout our time there and everyone seemed to know what to do and communication seemed great among all the staff.  The food is always great at Red's!  Very reasonable time after ordering and delicious!"}
{"text":"Red's in Ramsay has never let me down.  Portions are extremely generous and the service is 5 out of five.  Staff are courteous and friendly and food is served quickly.  My favorite is their Eggs Benedict with an amazing Hollondaise.  Being able to eat on the patio on warm days is a bonus!  Way to go Red's and I highly recommend."}
{"text":"I really wish I could leave a good review for reds. Don't get me wrong,  the service,  food,  and ambiance of the dining room are absolutely exceptional. I can't even begin to describe the extraordinary mouth feel of the vegan scramble, and the brilliantly soothing aroma from the artisan coffee. However I'm afraid that after a trip to the water closet,  I'm left with nothing but a sour taste in my mouth and my opinion due to the extremely offensive nature of the advertising they have posted. There's one advertisement,  if you can even call it that,  that stuck out in particular. The picture depicted a nearly bare human bottom with the words \"you know you're not the first,  but do you really care\". I found this to be extremely offensive on many accounts. Not only is this sexist and body shaming,  it made me feel. As if I was no longer in a safe space. I'm afraid I will be unable to return to reds until they promise to no longer post ads of this nature and issue a public apology."}
{"text":"Visited Red's for the the third time this weekend.    Food:  Consistently good. Large portions. I especially like the Montreal Smoked meat hash. Service:  Good to great.  Atmosphere:  I enjoy the vibe of this place. It's perfect for a casual brunch or lunch with friends or as a couple. We've never been hassled to move on.  Question: Why can't they offer a 1/2 portion option for those of us trying to eat lighter or with smaller appetites?"}
{"text":"amazing food! went for breakfast with a friend i had just met while on a mini vacation. i got the Reds big breakfast. it's definitely \"big\". despite the large portions, the food was of amazing quality (especially the eggs) and worth your money. we were also really hungry so the large portion did not disappoint. really cute atmosphere and good customer service too"}
{"text":"Overpriced by far.  The coffee is very acidic and gives me hart burn.  I like the decor, and the staff are friendly.  The food is ok but not worth the price.  I have come here a few times for Breakfast and lunch.  They aren't open for Dinner anymore.  The hash browns are plain.  Their blue cheese burger was good, but they don't have it anymore.   People seem to think everyone needs to hear their conversation.  Maybe this is a place to be seen in not to eat at?  I'm going take a tums now.  maybe a few throughout the day."}
{"text":"Everytime we go there with friends or family the food is great! One tip; use the app to get in the wait  line otherwise it would be a 45 minutes wait to get a table."}
{"text":"Decent food with decent service. Nice environment, parking can be a bit tricky at times."}
{"text":"Such a neat place! We popped in at 9:00am on a Saturday and were seated right away, the staff are very good. The menu is full of great options including healthy/whole wheat choices, let me tell you though that the buckwheat pancakes are killer amazing!!!! We both got the Reds original (I think thats what it was called) which had eggs, potatoes, bacon and toast. We could not finish because the portions were so huge (half a platter of potatoes each!) so I believe two people (or one very hungry person) could share that meal for sure!   A nice location, great service, nice decor and amazingly yummy food! You must give this place a try!!!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant and enjoyed the food and atmosphere. the place is busy on prime days. coffee is good but waited a while for food. overall the experience was good. parking can be difficult."}
{"text":"This is a special place that not many people know about. The reds on 4th is to \"hip\" now and this place is a quiet dinner in a nice area of town.   There is nothing I like more than making it to Reds in Ramsay a hour after they open. Always sitting in the back and over hearing the staff discuss what and how many they had last night.  Always use to go for the South Western Omelette but have recently devoured the Ranchero recently. Have already had a cup or shot of beans at home so I stay away from the coffee when I am there. My better half gets tea and I sip on it but the mugs they use are fascinating."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places for brunch! Such friendly staff and great food! I feel the prices are right for the portions you get. Best place to have eggs benny in all of Calgary!"}
{"text":"We were in town for the weekend and were going to meet up with friends who lived in the city. They recommended Red's for brunch and I wasn't disappointed! The decor and ambiance of the diner was great - modern, yet cozy. I loved it as soon as I walked in.   Their menu is fairly extensive, which is great because my husband isn't a huge brunch person. It was so nice that there were food options other than your typical breakfast/brunch items. Red's was great because they had a good variety. I ordered the Pacific Benedict with hollandaise sauce on the side as per my friend's recommendation, as they give you quite a lot. I love hollandaise, but too much makes for a soggy muffin which isn't so good. The potatoes were cubed and cooked nice and crisp - not too soggy and not burnt. The eggs were made perfectly as I requested: medium --not too runny and not overcooked. Husband also enjoyed his chicken club, and service was attentive; our server came by often to refill our drinks and ask how our meal was. All in all it was a fantastic meal and with great company. An excellent weekend brunch spot!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food made up for poor service...   The less than mediocre service is the only reason this restaurant lost a star. The server was not on her game... it took 20 minutes to get a tea and coffee and we didn't get water until we were almost done. She also didn't ask us even one how our meals were ok,or  if we needed anything. I noticed she actually didn't ask anyone if the food was good, which I found odd. And another 10 minutes after plates were cleared for the bill.  BUT because the wait wasn't very long (it was a super busy Saturday, yet we waited just under 20 minutes) and the food was outstanding! I tried the Ramsay eggs Benedict and the hubby had the caprese version. We both ordered the eggs medium and we both got one soft and one just over medium, but it didn't ruin the meal. Both dishes had great flavour and portion size. My Ramsay ones had artichoke hearts and prosciutto, which gave the dish a nice saltiness. The balsamic drizzle was the perfect touch and I had almost asked for it to be left off (I'm glad I didn't!). I don't even know how they cook potatoes that are somehow crisp and creamy at the same time, but my hubby just about got stabbed with a fork when he went for some of mine! My coffee was tasty too (I guess I was expecting Denny's-style diner coffee) but it was hot and tasted freshly brewed. You can tell they buy good-quality eggs.  I can't wait to go back. It'll be hard to try something new because the Ramsay dish was yummy but I want to see what else they have to give! I just hope I get a different server though."}
{"text":"Really liked the atmosphere here. Decor inside is very nice as well as the staff.  Menu has a lot of great items, escpecially for breakfast.They have a in line app which allows you to get in line before you even get there, however, once we arrived we still had to wait about 10 min before getting seated."}
{"text":"Red's is our go to lunch place. Their fries are amazing (especially if you dip them in gravy). Our favorite things to order are the breakfast sandwich, the rueben or the BLT.   Service is generally fast and pleasant. If you go on the weekend, expect a wait."}
{"text":"Popped in for lunch on a Tuesday around 12:45.  Place was busy, but still had room for us.  I had the Reuben and a delicious Carrot Ginger soup.  The sandwich was perfect in balance and flavours.  The mustard was full of energy and zing.  Could have used a bit more meat.   Service was prompt and friendly, and the atmosphere is open and welcoming.  A great spot that I will recommend and revisit whilst in Calgary."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good old fashioned diner food, you're at the right place! Portions are quite generous, I always find myself taking home half of my meal. Service is always great and attentive. So happy they've jumped on board the No Wait App because it is quite the time saver! Love that this location has a patio as well. The only thing I would say is that I find their specialty coffees (lattes, mochas etc) quite expensive at $5 a pop. Still, always a good option in a city that loves their breakfast/brunch joints!"}
{"text":"Met up with some friends while visiting Calgary and they recommended to come here for brunch. We arrived at around 11:30AM and there was no lineup. There was a small lineup a little later on but even they were seated shortly after arrival. This location is new, and provided a good ambiance for us to catch up. Service was attentive as the server came around multiple times for top ups on coffee and tea. What I like about this place is that the menu is quite big for a brunch spot as they offer regular lunch as well. I myself got the chicken club and it was very good. The chicken was moist and the flavours gave it a very homemade taste."}
{"text":"Fan-freaking-tastic!! It was a bit of a wait to get in but it was so worth it!   As soon as we were seated our server, Maysa, was on us to get our drink order! She was amazing. Smiling and cheerful she loved being there and you could tell.   The EGGS!! Oh my gosh! Seriously, the most orange yolks you will find!! Now those are free range eggs! They were absolutely delicious.   I had the Red's Original - the basic two eggs with bacon and everything, but the portion was huge! I couldn't finish. I couldn't imagine getting the Big Breakfast with three eggs!   It was delicious, friendly, and we will definitely be back! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Traditional eggs bennie 5/5 yelps tasty deep coloured yolks and large portion.  Service 5/5 yelps just great service from our server.  Parking lot is next to the restaraunt. When all the pickup trucks are parked there it makes it tight.  They loose a yelp because of the prices."}
{"text":"Going off of Yelp reviews we stopped here for lunch after touring the Calgary Zoo. We were not disappointed. Crepes Florentine, Build your own Burger and Red's Steak sandwich hit the spot. Friendly, helpful staff. Delicious food."}
{"text":"I've been to Red's in Ramsay numerous times and the past two times (that I recall), we've had Tia as our server. Tia always amazes me with her ability to remember even the smallest detail and all without writing anything down. She has a real way with people and even when things are crazy, she never loses focus on the customer. The food here is really good, but it's service like this that keeps me coming back. Thanks,  Tia, for another great meal yesterday!"}
{"text":"Best brunch we have had in a long time! As always shared one meal between two - was the perfect amount for us. All aspects were on point - the service, the food. Even the hash browns were fantastic. I'll be checking it out again!"}
{"text":"This is the spot! I enjoyed the featured breakfast the eggs benny, with smoked ham & hash browns. Food tasted real good! Some cool chicks work here! Very friendly staff. First latte I had was okay, second one was really good. Yes, it was one of those mornings where I needed 2. Great yelp find. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"We tried this place on a lazy Sunday. Ordered old fashioned pancake, waffle, burger and Mediterranean wrap with hash browns.  Everything seems average with slightly upscale prices. Servers are friendly but on slightly clumsier side (three spills in 40-45 minutes).  Burger was decent, fries were not fresh and seemed refried. Pancake was nothing to rave about. Mediterranean wrap is average too - nothing stood.  Overall it's a good experience- and love the fact that owner/manager read the reviews!"}
{"text":"Did you know that you can save your place in line with the \"No Wait\" App? This really worked for us because we were driving in from out of town and they had a table ready almost immediately after we walked in.  The host is very friendly. Our server was chatty and efficient.   For my first time at this location, we chose the PRARIE BREAKFAST-The perfect breakfast for a your Eastern European craving....Rocky's kielbasa, perogies, multigrain toast, hash browns and eggs done to your liking. Oh and sour cream! I had the PACIFIC COAST BENNY - 2 medium poached eggs over smoked salmon on a toasted English muffin all covered in a smooth house made hollandaise sauce. All this topped with red onions, capers and served with potatoes and fruit. Exactly what a Benny should be in heaven!   The coffee here is bold & strong so have a second cup but you really don't want to linger too long to be respectful to the people waiting But rest assured, not too far away in Inglewood are lots of great shops and boutiques to keep you entertained.  Oh and Red's has 3 more locations!"}
{"text":"The staff is the bomb.com, been here a dozen times an absolute love it! I recommend trying this place if you haven't (my favorites is the fruit and yogurt parfait, blueberry basil goat cheese stuffed French toast, and the Nutella banana crepes)"}
{"text":"Yum! Comfort food brunch was exactly what I was looking for when visiting Calgary during a frigid (and snowy!) stretch.  There's a great app (No wait) that many brunch places in Calgary use (Vancouver seriously needs this) where you can reserve your place in line. It's awesome.  Table was available shortly after our arrival. Huge menu. Good sized portions. Loved my Montreal smoked meat hash and eggs - so good! They have quite a few bread options to choose from too... the cheddar sourdough was perfect with this. I think everyone in my group was happy with their food. Friendly service.  It's been awhile since I've been to Calgary but pricing is on par with Vancouver, which surprised me a little."}
{"text":"We have been to Red's Diner several times in the past few months for breakfast. Mostly on the weekends. Great service, less than average brunch waits (15-30 minutes tops) and a great layout which lends itself to larger groups. It's easy to find parking and love that they've opened in a neighbourhood that needed a little love."}
{"text":"Red's in Ramsay is a very popular local restaurant, great for its brunch offering.  On the weekends, it's a bit of a zoo. You will want to secure a reservation with their convenient app (check out their website for the link).   On the weekends, there is virtually no line, so if you're one of them lucky folks who can get away from work M-F for an extended lunch or have a schedule to allow for it, go on down to Red's!"}
{"text":"Service was excellent.  Wife has \"Red's Original\"...I had \"Florentine Crepe\"....both tasted great.  Prices are high, but assume ingredients are above average."}
{"text":"AMAZING! I LOVE RED'S! it can become a little pricey when you start to get carried away buying all the yummy treats but nothing is bad here that I have tried and the service is super fun and engaging. Defiantly would recommend Red's as a cute fun brunch spot."}
{"text":"I could smell Red's from across the street and it smelled GOOD. Walking with a hungry stomach towards a diner and having the warm smell of freshly sizzled bacon hitting your nostrils is one pleasant experience indeed!  Like any cool breakfast joint in Calgary, you can expect a line-up at Red's. We were told the wait  would be 15-20 minutes but we lucked out. She was back a minute later and said she had a spot for two. Success!  The space is very cheery and bright. Very tall windows let in ample sunlight and put me in a great daytime mood for scarfing down some bennies!  And eat bennies I did! you know it pains me to say this, but I don't remember the specifics. I do however remember my overall impression:  I think Red's food is a step above your typical diner fair and a step above your typical diner fair in price, too. I also think their food is a step below my favourite breakfast spots, but they're also a step below in price. I was more than satisfied with the bang for my buck at Red's.  It's a friendly place to go get yourself some brunch and eat happy. I'll be back next time I'm in Ramsay!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfasts I have had in a long time. The service was spot on. They accommodated my modification of no potatoes with my breakfast & substituted in a fruit tray.   I ordered the Ramsey Benedict, Eggs medium. Absolutely cooked to perfection. Hands down on my top 5 breakfasts places in all of canada.   My date for breakfast had a mushroom Swiss burger, which was also absolutely delicious & their homemade fries that came with it - I will be dreaming of tonight when I lay my head on the pillow.   Server: was top notch! Never left out glasses  empty & ensure we know exactly when our food was going to be ready."}
{"text":"Best coffee! Great breakfast! Great service, friendly staff and beautiful surroundings I will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"My new fave hotspot in Calgary, their hollandaise anything is amazing.  The thing is, 99% of place are stingy with the hollandaise but this place is NOT SHY. Service leaves a little to be desired, but décor is nice, location SUCKS for parking.  Super yummy mac n cheese, I'm drooling right now as I eat my salad (gross!).   Day trip to Calgary, anyone?"}
{"text":"Traveling through town and found this super cute local spot. The food & service was amazing! Every one had a smile on their face so I'd assume it's a fun place to work as well. Got the Reds Big Breakfast so I could sample a little of everything. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Hey Sleepyhead! Arrive at 8 a.m. on a Sunday morning and you won't have to wait to get a table! (You can take a nap later...)  I thoroughly enjoyed my Traditional Eggs Benedict, but I also coveted my friend's Red's Big Breakfast because it came with a huge blueberry pancake - YUM! My double espresso was pretty good, but at $4.50 I thought it was a bit on the pricey side. The menu offers a variety of meals throughout the day with breakfast being served all day. That's my kinda place.  The parking lot was a nice surprise, but I can see how it might fill up pretty fast during their busy times.  The atmosphere is cool - kinda rustic industrial - it's super comfortable, lots of windows, but still cozy. I could sit there all day and write a novel...hmmm, maybe I will."}
{"text":"Really quick service, great staff, and an awesome environment!  The food was pretty good too, although the gravy for the poutine was a little on the sweet side for me, but didn't distract away from the meal as a whole."}
{"text":"The staff are friendly and the finishings are very nice but our meal was less than stellar. Cold eggs, horrible hollandaise and mushy hashbrowns. We arrived at 8:30 and even that early it was hard to find parking. Ignore their map online as it's completely inaccurate. By the time we left there was a line up of cars just waiting for spots to open up. It doesn't even come close to some of my other favourite breakfast spots in town but if you live in the neighborhood it could be convenient enough to make it worthwhile."}
{"text":"This place is great! First time here but the atmosphere is very cozy and chill. The menu is a wide selection, although it is quite pricey. The serving portion however is large, so it works out well. Food tastes good! The eggs used are fresh farm eggs that the yolk is orange. Makes me wonder what else food here is fresh. Staff is friendly and parking is moderately big, if over parking you can park on the street. This location seems to get busy at certain times but the dining space is quite big, with a bar area. Washrooms are well kept. When Comparing this to Denny's, this is definitely upper class food. I'll be coming back here again for sure. Maybe even take someone special to eat here with, or share a plate. Recommended for anyone looking to try different food styles."}
{"text":"Deliciousness galore!  You must use the No Wait app to get in line for seating.  We were seated as soon as we got there.  The food and service is very good.  I love the fact that brunch is available so early in the morning!  I do think the addition of breakfast poutine would be a great addition!"}
{"text":"Great spot built in an older brick building in an older neighbourhood. Loved the vibe and the source locally which is important to me.   Came here because some website said it had one of the best eggs Benny in yyc  I can say the eggs Benny were very tasty! The sauce was creamy and so yummy. I do like the lemon in my sauce stinger so that's the only thing I wud critique. The potatoes that came with were also SO tasty. Smaller sized and had a crispyness to them and a very nice slight seasoning. Comes with a couple wedges of fruit.   The service was very good as well. Afton was our  server and she was personable!! Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Cool diner with great food and great, friendly service!  Menu is vast and unique. Large portions and interesting combinations. Breakfast and lunch specials and good parking. Try it!  You'll love it!   Listed on the Nowait app."}
{"text":"Brunch who doesn't love brunch? I had someone treating me to brunch even better! I had told my friend I had never been to Red's he said that is really good and I had heard this from others.    I don't know if I was expecting more but I can truthfully say that I was not that impressed.  I felt like they were trying too had to give off a hipster vibe but it was all middleclass nicely dress couples in the entire restaurant.  Only hipster looking people were the staff the one waitress only had one arm on her glassed to keep them on her face. I think it was for the attention of people glaring at her.   It was eerily quiet in the restaurant it's like all the people had nothing in common and had nothing to talk about with each other.  It was like everyone was on an uncomfortable tinder date. They all dressed up nicely and thought they should meet at a trendy place to show off that they are hip and cultured.  Oh and lets go for brunch because then there is no awkward late night pressure.   Now to order my food in a tone of voice that will not disturb the birds and the bees at play.  I ordered the stuffed French toast I thought I would be adventures this morning. Mistaken buy the word play on the menu I should have stuck to eggs and bacon. I found it too something it was rich savory and sweet all at the same time and got flavor-exhaustion really fast and lost interest in my meal, basically disassembled  it and ate the potatoes off of my friends plate.    All in all might give this place a second try but maybe the other location."}
{"text":"It's good. A 3 stars on yelp seems underwhelming, and that's not what I mean, it is \"A-OK\" as the ratings here state, but could be (and used to be) better.  I was wicked excited when red's opened in Ramsay, it's a great spot for the neighbourhood, and the food is good. I have noticed a decline in quality over the last year or so though... It's OK food still, but they are charging an upscale price for it, which is why they lost one star. I've never had a bad meal there, but I have been under-whelmed more than once. If I'm paying $18.00 for a hash breakfast, it better be amazing. It's not amazing, It's good for sure, but after coffee and tip it's over $25.00 and really I can go get a better meal for that price.... $12.00 for just a regular, 2 eggs, potatoes and toast breakfast is a bit much too... Overly greasy hash browns (slimy with grease,)  ok eggs, the toast was great though.  All in all, I'm not sure why the quality has declined. They are still using up-scale ingredients, but it's \"black-foot diner\" level preparation, making for an ok, but could be better, experience. I haven't been to the location on 4th for a while, but I remember it tasting fresh, home made, and worth the value, not heavy, and greasy as it has been the last few visits in Ramsay. The prices are up a bit I know because they use local meats, free range eggs etc, but so do I at home, and I can make the same breakfast for $4.00 paying retail prices for the ingredients... so.... Maybe the owners need to take a look behind the kitchen doors and do some more quality inspection/training because i genuinely expect a touch more from a boutique breakfast."}
{"text":"Super speedy. VERY quick service. our orders arrived super fast. I can't say I was wow-ed but It also wasn't awful. Pretty standard stuff. CUTE coffee mugs though, and a nice space inside. went very early on a weekday so there was no wait."}
{"text":"In brief- top breakfast choice in Calgary!  Currently the newest and best spot for breakfast/brunch in Inglewood/Ramsey.  This is Reds second location in YYC.  I noticed the Portlandia-worthy line-ups outside since it opened a few weeks ago and decided to check it out today.  The building is unrecognizable from the old pizza place that used to be here. It's now a beautiful space, welcoming and bright.  It was all hustle-bustle on this Saturday morning, but we were in in no time.  We sat at the bar and watched the kitchen churn out a variety of dishes from French toast to Hash to Eggs Benny to lunch fare like burgers (tip- feta and caramel used onion burger was fantastic!).  We left satisfied and happy and plan in returning soon.  Another great addition to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"I've heard this place is comparable to Oeb so I thought I'd check it out. It was alright but I won't be rushing to go back. I got the Ramsey benny and it was cooked just right but I thought the combo of prosciutto and balsamic a little much and the potatoes were tasty but very oily. The big thing was the bad service. Our waitress didn't come check on us once after taking our order (it was delivered by someone else) and we had to ask for our bill after waiting 10 mins with our plates piled. She did take the price of my coffee and my moms tea off, but we still weren't impressed."}
{"text":"The eggs are the best with the darkest yolks I have ever seen! Potatoes cooked right but could use seasoning has skin on which is perfect, bacon is salty but good not cheap crap!! Now for the best breakkie Breakfast Poutine... Oh my soooo good!!! Gravy, egg potatoes, chorizo sausage, cheese mixed together WOW!! Coming back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Red's Diner is located on the corner of 8 street SE in the community of Ramsay.  There is a parking lot as well as a ton of street parking (there is a parking map on the website if you're interested ;)).  When you enter Red's there is a small waiting area where you can have a seat (if it's available) or help yourself to a cup of joe while you wait for your table to be ready.   The crossfit gym I go to is pretty close by so Red's is definitely a regular visit for some crossfitters on the weekend.  All day breakfast, delicious lunches or comforting dinners, Red's has it all!  I'm not sure about you but for me, I love brunch.  A handful of us hit up Red's on a Saturday around 11:45am, we only waited about 10 minutes before we were seated.  Water came without question and our server greeted us.  We were all starving balls so we quickly decided what we wanted.  I went with Red's Big Breakfast which is 3 eggs your way (I got scrambled), bacon, breakfast sausage, hash browns and comes with one pancake and a side of toast. Jenna went with the rancheros wrap - 2 Scrambled eggs, black beans, jalapeño, jack cheese and green onion wrapped in a flour tortilla, served with salsa and sour cream.  Tom got Red's burger with the soup of the day which was mushroom and Justin got what looked like a breakfast bread pudding.  At this time, Red's was pretty busy but the food seemed to appear at a good time. My breakfast lived up to its name 'cause it was a plate full of food.  The pancake was super delicious, light and fluffy but I soaked it with butter and maple syrup which made it heavy :). My only complaint would be the potatoes.  They aren't crispy at all and I LOVE crispy potatoes.  They're more on the 'soggy' side and I would have loved a nice crunch to the potatoes.  Everyone else enjoyed their meals, and we were all pretty stuffed.  Red's is definitely the place you hit up if you're craving some modern comfort food.  It's nothing out of the ordinary breakfast/brunch joint but the food is so comforting.....like home! So you'll always want to go back.  The menu is pretty big with a lot of variety which can make it hard to choose just one thing.  I haven't had dinner here yet but I'll sure try it sometime!!"}
{"text":"Tough to review a breakfast venue when I don't eat eggs but the whole family enjoyed the vibe and the meal. Like that they have a lot of coffee out for those waiting for a table. Very courteous."}
{"text":"I came here with a small group for supper last night.  I love the atmosphere and our male server was the most memorable one I've had since visiting La Vienna (in a good way).    Unfortunately, I think the diner was understaffed, as it took a long time for our drinks and meal to show up at the table.  One in our party had to ask for her drink twice.  My spouse and I ordered boozy milkshakes as a treat with our meal.  We both had chocolate but I added Bailey's to mine, he added Peppermint.  Apparently his didn't taste like anything was added at all and he was convinced there was no alcohol.  However, mine definitely had booze, as the Bailey's kicked me in the pants about halfway through my milkshake.  The server joked that it was a free pour and suggested I not drive afterward.  I must say that the boozy milkshakes are not worth the dough and I wouldn't order one again, even though mine was great.  They need to be much larger for the price.   I really enjoyed my Rancheros Wrap and it certainly had kick.  I didn't even use the salsa and barely touched the sour cream.  Everyone else enjoyed their meal too.  Most of the party ordered Ramsay Fish and Chips, a few swapping the chips for poutine instead.    Most prices are reasonable and I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"I like this spot - not as busy as the \"downtown\" one...the prices are out of control - but I noticed this in every resto I visited on my business trip back to Calgary.   The bar service is friendly and fast, the food options are good except that they are covered in oil...not so good on the heart or the midsection. I wish it was less greasy and there were more vegan options.   The service is good here and the vibe is cool. I'd definitely go back but I'd ask for less oil for sure."}
{"text":"Went for lunch for the first time at Reds and got the BLT, with the hand cut fries. The food was pretty good, I felt the ration to bacon lettuce to tomato was little off. There service was great and the food came out quick."}
{"text":"Really good place for breakfast!!.. I had the crepes and they were delicious!!.. The hot chocolate was just ok.. I wouldn't order it again... But my crepes were so good, that I would definitely go back there!!... In addition, the service was very friendly and fast..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast places in the city by far! The place is a reasonable size, so even if there is a line, it goes fairly quickly. Good coffee, friendly and efficient staff, cozy and of course an amazing eggs benny! Definately the place I go to most for breakfast and never had a bad experience."}
{"text":"I wanted to love it but it's ridiculously expensive for the mediocre quality. Everything is super greasy. It's not BAD, but definitely not worth the prices. Service has been friendly every time."}
{"text":"I love me some brunch. I really do, but usually the wait time you can anticipate in Calgary: The City Filled With People Who Also Love Them Some Brunch (Official Title) scares me a lot. HOWEVER, At 1:30PM on the Saturday before Christmas there was NO WAIT!   You read that right....NO. WAIT.  I'm sure this was a fluke, but it totally floored me. The service was impeccable, my coffee was never cold or empty and the food was great! Great gluten free options for people like me, who can't eat \"real\" food.  definitely check this place out, even if you've been to the other location."}
{"text":"$18 for a chorizo hash and the sausage tasted like ground beef... not worth the wait or the price. The service however, was highly organized for how busy it was and polite and fast. I might go back and try some of the lunch items but would go somewhere else for brunch."}
