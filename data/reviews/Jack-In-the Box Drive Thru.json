{"text":"Horrible service, it's 1:18 am Friday morning, I'm not to sure what this Hispanic ladies name is, but she kept pushing us to leave because the soda machine was down and just left us at the window instead of giving out money back, nor did she ask, she just wants us to leave lol, well news flash that requires money back for paying for something we obviously can't have... Nicer people would be great, but I guess that's expecting a lot from someone who believes she needs $15 an hour even though she's rude. Noooo thank you. Won't be coming back to this location. Sorry."}

my husband and 3 other co-workers had food from this location, and when he opened the sandwich wrapper, he said it smelled like SEMEN! OMG! in the trash it went.
gross!"}
{"text":"Why has the Jumbo Jack Gotten smaller?  Drive thru guy had to repeat the order 3 times because the speaker was broken."}
{"text":"There is limited seating. Staff is constantly fighting loud enough for customers to hear. I had to wait nearly 10 minutes for one item. The tables are messy and the drink area had soda all over it. The only reason why I gave them an extra star was because they were friendly to me."}
{"text":"Nice attendant and quick service. Due to someone being allergic to quite a few things, we had to ask for an order that was certainly customized quite a bit. The staff had no problem working with us. Thank you!"}
{"text":"I don't usually do fast food but today I was in a hurry between work and upcoming move I just didn't have time so I hit this Jack.  I ordered a spicy chicken with extra, extra mayo.  Got back to work and there was absolutely NO mayo on this dried up chicken sandwich.  I called them and got no satisfaction, as person that answered the phone acted like she couldn't hear me (there was some background noise) and actually hung up on me!!  No more Jack for this girl.  I'm done!"}

{"text":"I've been coming here for almost two years. The people who work the drive thru are always very nice. I used to work fast food when I was a teenager: I know how AWFUL drunk customers (sober ones too!) can be so I'm all the more impressed that the crew of this store has such dignity and poise. Bravo.

The food is always made when I order it, so my burgers and fries are hot and tasty. 

Living around the corner has its perks, so I'll be back.

Thank you to everyone at this store for awesome service!"}
{"text":"Their EBT has been down for almost a month and i see homeless people get turned away for food they ordered because their machine was down and never got it fixed. This is travesty, if my tax dollars are paying them to fund this program, then it should be available like it says on their front door or take the sign down and stop pretending."}
{"text":"I like Jack in the Box.... but this location is terrible.  Service is very poor and wait times are crazy long.  Tried this location a couple times because the first time i thought maybe i was serviced by a bad employee.   However, after being here more than a few times it became apparent that the crew just is not up to standards.  There is another Jack in the Box just a dash farther away, if I ever get a urge to eat Jack in the Box its worth the extra drive to go to one that actually has good service."}
{"text":"The food tastes good, but the employees struggle at this location. Either they have the hands down poorest basic counting skills I've ever seen, are short a few fingers to accurately count, or have been instructed by management that stealing from customers is complete acceptable.

Counting your chicken nuggets, or any other food item sold by the piece, is a must at this location, which is totally ridiculous. I've been here multiple times recently and every time I'm nearly cheated out of 20-25% of the order. Tonight I purchased a 20 piece nugget, and received a grand total of 15.

Informing the employees and manager is a joke. They don't apologize or have the decency to act surprised by the error. I don't know what kind of scam they're running, or why they are incapable of providing an accurate order, but check what they give you both drive-thru or dining in. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Great Customer Service. Good Fresh Hot Food. Overall A Pleasant Visit. Open Late!! Two Thumbs Up! ;)"}
{"text":"This is the worst place to go. Staff wouldn't even let me or my kids use the restroom because then they would have to clean it again. Food was disgusting and cold. Don't ever go to this place!!!!"}

{"text":"Don't come here if you're in a hurry or on a lunch break... Stood at counter for 10min, several employees looked right at me and didn't take my order.. WTF!! REALLY??!!  And these are the type of people who want $15.00 hr!!! Give me a f'n break!!! Won't be coming back.. I suggest you do same...."}
{"text":"Pretty quick service and very friendly employees during midnight hours. 

They tend to run out of ingredients for the teriyaki bowl after 11pm"}
{"text":"I have visited this Jack In The Box THREE times this week, I am a loyal customer and have been so displeased with my service I have taken time out of my day to write this.The first time I went to purchase tacos through the drive through at 2am , and was told they were closed .Seeing as they are advertised as being open 24 hours, and the car after me being served , that's bullshit.
    The second time I went at 11pm, the service was horrendously slow, and half of my order was missing.
    The third time today at the literally same time of night with the same workers, again slow.The manager , on his phone the whole time. My munchie meal did not come in the box. The drive through lady literally looks like she ran out of the bathroom with a heroin needle still in her arm. Please fix this , until further notice a different location will get my business 

THEIR 600 WORD LIMIT FOR FEEDBACK IS BULLSHIT"}
{"text":"I had been to this location a few times, I never expect anything too positive from a fast food place. I'm sure most of the people hate working there, so a grump or two is fine, I understand, but here was my experience that I drew the line at:

I pull in from the main street, get cut off by a large white SUV that stops in the middle of the parking lot, someone with a Jack in the Box shirt jumps in, another jumps out and goes into the restaurant. The SUV sits for a second (after the driver looks right at me) then backs up behind the drive-thru. I pull up to get into the drive-thru, order everything, and just as I am about to pull to the window the SUV whips in front of me. They were never behind me waiting, they were sitting next to me like they were just waiting to jump in front of me. I wasn't really sure how they were going to get any further because they had never ordered, so I waited and expected them to be gone pretty quickly. Two minutes pass, then five, as they talk to whoever is at the window. They hand them a large drink, no one pays. Someone had screamed \"HE GOT THE JOB!\" from the car, everyone did a little cheer. Obviously these people know each other.

I finally get my food after 6-7 minutes of waiting. My orders missing some extra fries I had ordered for my boyfriend and I mention it, and the girl asks for my card again, I assume they had forgotten to add it to the order, fine. Gave her my card, got my fries. I asked for a manager she said there wasn't one there right now, I asked for a number, she just gives me a number to the store. 

Upon getting home I see she HAD charged me for the extra fries on the first receipt, then again when I asked for them and she asked for my card. My boyfriend and I eat our food then go back down to get our money back. The girl that I guess was the manager that had been there all along was very rude. I asked for just the money back on the fries, that's all I wanted. She ended up refunding my entire meal. That's fine, just wanted the money for the fries, but hey, free food I guess. She basically did it to shut me up even though I was polite because I knew it was a mistake, they happen, I've worked in retail and I understand people mess up. She shoved me away and we left.

The receipt had a place to do a survey so we both did it online, my boyfriend got a call a few days later and the man said he had fired the person who was driving the SUV and holding us up and said we were being mailed coupons. Two weeks later we got two vouchers for a free menu item. 

Really disappointed at the employees at this location, I am going to other fast food places near by now even though this is the closest."}
{"text":"Had the worst time there today , first it took 5 minutes to get to the counter everyone was coming from the back room , then the cashier  was speaking to me in Spanish I do not speak Spanish , then they try to not take the coupons  I gave them ( not expired ) , then messed up the order, then they over changed me by $1.00  ( $1.00 off coupon ) , it was about 5 pm it might has well been the Z team a worker came into work complaining  about working  when I was leaving . never again go to that  jack in the box again ever. I hope it closes"}
{"text":"Dear 
Jack in the box 
     
      Thank you so very much for the soggy non crunchy mc chicken tasting sandwich. You are so sweet for down grading your food. Maybe you will mark down your prices with it too.  

Sinclery, 
no longer a fan

Ps your food is gross."}
{"text":"Meh.........not a fan of fast food to begin with, this place is really over priced. The last hold on for me was the Jumbo Jack, and not it's gotten more expensive too. Parking at this location is a night mare."}
{"text":"Just like any other jack in a box. Ehh food drive thru has been fast. No real complaints."}
{"text":"Everytime I go to this location, it's slow crappy service, the fries are cold like they've been there for hours, and the burgers are like a dry piece of leather.  Get it together jack in the box and get some new staff instead of lazy teenagers making you wait forever for crappy food!"}
{"text":"I would say I would never eat at this place because of the disgusting ways they keep this place clean. If they can't keep their bathrooms clean they can't do the rest of their establishment either. I went early this morning at around 8 o'clock and the toilet was overflowing with whatever somebody did in it and the floors are dirty the wastepaper was full, the sink was not cleaned off, and the toilets were not clean. One of the toilets was leaking water all over the place so I had to step in it. As for the rest of their establishment nothing had been wiped off like the handles and the doors and around the floorings I would say I would never come here because of how filthy this places."}
{"text":"This place is only for homeless people.  I was not welcomed here, nor did they speak English!   I called to verify if they took debit, due to the fact they only take cash.   Was on the phone for ¹hr don't come here!   Its a fake."}
{"text":"food was good. seemed to take longer then usual. Then I say a sign in the lobby that said \"we don't cook it until you order\" not sure if i belivie that but...... anyway"}
{"text":"I was not welcomed here, nor did they speak English!   I called to verify if they took debit, due to the fact they only take cash.   Was on the phone for ¹hr don't come here!   Its a fake.
Even after I called if there EBT machine was working been t it was not AGAIN!!!!"}
{"text":"The service here is anything but stellar...the guy taking my order said \"I gotcha! I gotcha!\" But got me he did not. I placed an order of one sandwich, two tacos, bacon cheddar potato wedges substitute regular fries, ranch, ketchup and hot sauce. The goon working the drive through forgot all my sauces and did not substitute the regular fries! Who forgets sauces?!"}
{"text":"Tried the new ribeye sandwich.  YUK!!  More meat on a hamburger. Melted cheese was disgusting.  Almost inedible.  Hoping not to get diarrhea later.  Service was mediocre.  No smile or thank you for choosing Jack in that girl's vocabulary."}
{"text":"Someone from JIB Hqtrs needs to find out why service is so terrible here, 20 mins to get a grilled breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"It's 11:45 pm.

You're the DD for the night and driving home a car full of loud, drunk people.

Everyone was having so much fun, they forgot to eat dinner.

Where else do you go?

You start thinking about all of the calories you saved from drinking iced tea all night .

\"Egg Nog Shake, please.\""}
{"text":"Let me explain my low rating, the food is good, so let's get that out of the way.

The homeless tend to crowd around the place, begging for anything you will give them. My wife had to display her pistol to get one to back away from the truck! What the hell? He was tapping on her window and asking her to buy him food, she cracked the window and told him she wasn't there for charity, he persisted and my wife got nervous, she pulled the pistol and jumped the curb to leave without buying anything. Place needs a security guard or something."}
{"text":"I love Jack In The Box but not this one. Their food taste like it was sitting out for hours and was cold. They only thing good was the stuffed jalapeños. Never stop here again."}
{"text":"This use to be a great jack in the box. But the last time I went there the workers gave you addittude from hell and when I was ordering this lady who was taking my order interrupt me not even half done with ordering and Oved on to next person. Then when I spoke up she got in my face about it. I got the manager and he did absolutely nothing just let her do what she wanted. And when I finally got my food. She tried being all nice to me. Like that's gonna matter now. Nope!"}
{"text":"Even though I had several customizations that seemed to confuse the cashier, she approached me in the lobby before fulfilling my order to make sure she had gotten it right. All of our orders were completely accurate, and the place was pretty clean, for fast food. 

The owner/manager was working in street clothes, which is usually a big red flag to me that the store is going under, but the employees seemed relaxed and determined. The area is hokey, and the patrons were a little smelly and dirty, but that is to be expected from this area of town, and certainly shouldn't be a problem if you have a hungry belly that needs filled."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service! Used drive thru and even though  I asked for hot sauce I didn't get it or napkins! Like hello? If I'm using DT obviously I will need some! Ugh! The food dry and old... Never going back there I'm surprised it's still on business."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to this location after midnight and ordered a combo meal as well as other misc things. We weren't given the drink so we asked the lady at the window about it, she got snappy and said we weren't charged for it. So, we replied, that we had ordered it and fries, she which were not in the bag, she then said that she didn't take out order, that she was in the rest room ( eww) too much info, she then said that if we wanted our fries we'd have to pull around to the parking lot, even though no cars were behind us. My boyfriend declined her rude offer, she then said she had our License plate, I guess the jack in the box police will be looking for us. To top it off, my chicken was still cold in the middle."}
{"text":"Had a breakfast sandwhich and it was good.  The drive-through customer service was a couple of notches above what you'd expect- great attitudes, helpful, and cheerful.  Jack knows how to hire and retain a crew.  Food it typical Jbx."}
{"text":"I'm writing this review and giving them a 5 star for moving fast while being busy at 12am. There was probably 7 cars before me and the guy who took my order sounded happy to be taking the order unlike any other fast food place I've ordered from before. The order was correct too. Giving the 5 star for good service."}
{"text":"Got the chicken fajita pita, curly fries and two tacos... Food is always awesome, but not the healthiest... - 1 star for slow service."}
{"text":"This is the 2nd time we have stopped here on our way thru Chandler. Was hoping our first was a fluke. Wrong! This time was worse.  Drink area not stocked - dirty and completely out of straws and lids.  Employees drinks on food and service counters.  Employee observed eating with her fingers while preparing food. Employee coughed and sneezed into his hands then handled without washing his hands or wearing gloves. Employee scratching her head at the counter then handling food.  Manager yelled at employee for being late in front of customers.  Took about 15 minutes to get food while employees seemed aimless and confused about their job duties.  Employees and manager seemed more concerned about talking about when they were going to get a break or get off work.  Had to repeat our order 4 times to employee. It was a #27 and #29 on the breakfast board, simple right? She would repeat back 27 and 28 or 28 and 29 or just stare at my boyfriend.  Finally he resorted to just pointing to it on the board.  It was ridiculous! This dirty and slow!"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of Jack in the Box.
But every time I go to this one the drive-thru is fast and friendly and my food is always hot or cold as appropriate."}
{"text":"Worst looking food truck series sand which I ever got. I put it on a plate and didn't find any meat for what they charge. Service sucks right now aswell. Only one person at the window and I'm asked to wait to order til they actually drive off. Mine sure didn't look anything like the pic off the menu."}
{"text":"Should say 18/7 because the majority time I come late nights they tell me they aren't taking orders due to their system resetting at the most random(convenient) times. Don't waste your gas coming here at night, you probably won't get service."}
{"text":"Never been to Jack In The Box before but was craving a hamburger and in the location 
The young lady who took my order was very courteous and explained what came on my order. Added fries and a drink
The fries were so salty they were uneatable. The bun was pretty good. The burger was a dried out piece of meat. Don't know if they make their burgers fresh or they sit under a heat lamp. 
Needless to say next time I get a craving for a burger it won't be at Jack's"}
{"text":"The burgers are so dry and tasteless.  Even with the cheese and jalapenos it was barely edible.  

Can't believe that for $1 you get a child's size drink!  The most expensive drink at any fast food chain!"}
{"text":"Stay off ur phone... Pay more attention to ur work... Horrible service... Our order would have been right if the guy working drive thru was paying attention.... God I wish the foothills jacks was still around... Customer service is going down hill fast... U guys really should bring back ur old employees... They at least did their work..."}
{"text":"I have been a loyal Jack customer since I was a kid, and even worked in their promotion group in high school, as the Jack in the Box clown. The quality of their food is getting worse all of the time. The staffing at many of the stores I have visited lately has been poorly trained, and poorly managed. In my visit today I had a Sour dough Jack burger, and I asked for extra pickles. The burger patty was horrible, and way over cooked. They put so much mayo and ketchup on that it was soggy, and they only put one slice of pickle on. The fries were all broken little pieces, and most were not even warm but cold. 

The burgers at Jack used to be good. I miss the Sirloin Burger which always had better flavor, and was more juicy. I hate the new Buttery Burgers. The buns are not good, and they seem very fatty and rich. 

When I pulled in the restaurant I was on a call, so I sat in the parking lot for 20 minutes before entering. I noticed there was a big mess outside the back of the store. After eating, which took a while since it was the lunch rush time, and they had an untrained kid working the one order station. When I returned to my truck I noticed that they still had not cleaned up the mess in the back of the store (see pic) in almost an hour.

It seems the people at this store just don't care about their product, or their appearance. This is not the first time I've had bad food, and bad service at this location, and it will be the last time I visit this location. The sad part is that it's the closest one to my home."}
{"text":"They used to have decent grilled chicken. Now it's simply gross because it's way too greasy! I'll head back to Wendy's for good, grilled chicken salad at a fair price. Someone needs to do some QC on the salads at this Jack location."}
{"text":"This restaurant advertises itself as being open 24 hours a day. Yet I've been through twice in the early AM (~4AM - 4:30AM), only to be told that their systems were being rebooted and they couldn't take my order.    No provisions for taking an order the old fashioned way -- just flat out \"we can't take your order\".

You're either open 24 hours or you're not.  Don't advertise something you can't deliver on."}
{"text":"Horrible. I ordered my food and as soon as I sat down I was attacked by flys! I could barely eat because I was to busy swatting them away. And someone came in the store to get water and sit inside for a minute to drink it because it was like 118 degrees outside and the manager started harrasing him to leave."}
{"text":"Ordered a root beer float... got a cup of root beer with ice cubes at the bottom & a melty blob of soft serve on top. Brought it back to be replaced by one without ice cubes - got a watered down cup of root beer with the littlest bit of ice cream in it. Jack in the box should probably just say they don't serve root beer floats."}
{"text":"Pretty clean dining room and clean men's room,   friendly service,   as good as any quick serve restaurant."}
{"text":"This place, these people .  Smh ..

They mess up your order, mess up your food. Have to go back multiple times because it's not right. Dont give you for you've paid for. So manager offeres to replace your order \"at your convenience\" that they will they will leave your name and a list in office for when you come in. and when you go to get it how convenient list is gone and they won't honor agreement. Stay away from this shady,  JITB... Crooks!! Shame on you! 
They deserve NO STARS!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've ever had, Christian was a complete ass to my wife. We asked for BBQ sauce and got 21 taco sauce packets (didn't order a single taco) and five ranches. Such incompetent behavior should swiftly dealt with. I will NEVER visit this location again. Save your money. Zero stars. Shameful."}
{"text":"Best place to have your taxi cab driver or DD drive through to pick up monster tacos and an oreo shake that you will greatly enjoy while still inebriated, but completely regret the next morning! Yeah, buddy!"}
{"text":"This chain pulled out of the Chicago market years ago so when I saw a Jack In the Box I put it on my bucket list of things to do during my visit. I had to have the taco's as it was a high school staple."}
{"text":"Showed up early this morning and no one answered me when I got to the drive through menu, then I went up to the window and I couldn't see anybody. Wasn't this suppose to be 24/7?"}
{"text":"Waiting for an eternity at 1:30am. Really!!!!. Four cars backed up.  Been here 20 min."}
{"text":"Just not good.

I was in a rush to grab a bite to eat, and had very little time, so Jack in the Box it was.  I ordered a three piece eggroll and soft drink. I was handed a cup for my soft drink and headed over to the drink despencer, when the employee working behind the  called out \"three piece eggroll\". I grabbed my order and headed to a table.

When I opened the box of eggrolls it  appeared brunt, old, and were cold.  I went back to the counter and showed the employee working.  She asked if want a new order and I stated yes.  

The new order was fresh however they weren't terribly good after the first few bites, and I threw the rest of the eggrolls away.

Overall, I understand Jack in the Box,  is fast food, and that is what you receive and on occassion it's a good place for a bite to eat.  However, this location I would not choose to eat at very often."}
{"text":"Great service this morning from Joshua in the drive thru, food was fresh and delicious and service was just as good!  Jack in the Box definitely stays on top of things! thanks for the great service!"}
{"text":"For fast food its ok.  The staff is always friendly but sometimes they mess up the orders and sometimes the menu is unavailable.  Chicken tater melt munchie meal is always satisfying and a good value. Don't expect too much,  you get what you pay for."}
{"text":"It is what it is. In a pinch, they are better than most QST. I still love IN N OUT...

{"text":"Always clean and good food. Lady is always nice! Food always comes pretty fast too we come on our lunch break so glad their pretty quick"}
{"text":"I have to agree with Shane on this particular location......I have been to several Jack in the box's in Cali.....and this one is awful compared to those. The place is always dark, dank and dirty looking. The service is always slow......however the staff is friendly. I highly recommend the drive thru because it seems they concentrate on that pretty heavy so you should get your food faster. However the milkshakes are the one bright spot here....since they are made to order they are very fresh and delicious. Everything else however is just average.....and unless you just like Jack in the box....there are several better places to eat nearby. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!"}
{"text":"El personal, fue muy amable y considerado al permitirme usar el baño de las de las mujeres siendo yo hombre ya que se me presentó una emergencia y el baño de los hombres estaba fuera de servicio."}
{"text":"Susan, behind the counter was rude to my friend and I.
The inside has very limited seating.
Shady characters come and go!
Food was sub-par."}
{"text":"Popped into the drive-thru for something sweet when the urge for breakfast struck. The Ultimate Breakfast sandwich with bacon, ham, egg, and cheese scratched that itch nicely! The churro chaser was the icing on the cake (literally-ish). The service was very fast and the staff looked to be very efficiently handling the increasing traffic."}
{"text":"I had the bacon ranch chicken club tonight and it gave me a real appreciation for how good Chick-fil-A makes a chicken sandwich. This tasted \"artificial.\" Whether it was the ranch or the bacon, I'm not sure. But it just wasn't good.

I wouldn't say that there was anything wrong with the restaurant, the staff, or the service. But I wouldn't order this sandwich again."}
{"text":"I am currently waiting at this location, second in long in the drive through 2:03am Arizona time and line and the attendant while placing my order Is saying that I should go somewhere else because they're backed up at the moment!!!???? What kind of customer service is this I asked her and she said she's just being honest. After waiting less than 10 mins I get my order! Why is the employees there trying to push customers away to not do their jobs. I took her  name whilst paying at the checkout counter because I didn't  wanna do it whilst placing my order to prevent her from probably spitting in my food. Her name was Lauren and asked why I took it .... she said forgive her because she's the only one there. Now I feel bad....what a shame!"}
{"text":"They're supposed to be open 24 hours yet at 1130 they told me they were closed and wouldn't take my order. I work for 2 customer service fast food jobs and if we were to shut down early like that and miss out on sales, we would all be fired. Yet you see these bad reviews and still do nothing. Maybe I'm typing for nothing seeing get as nothing will probably change. I just might purposely go back there every night at 1130 to place an order just to see if they'll say they're closed and I'll come back with updates."}
{"text":"There is a torn up street between my shop and the Jack in the Box I normally go to grab a quick burger so I ventured across Grand to this location.  Newer store that looks like it has had a complete remodel of the dining room.  I don't recall seeing hi-tops at Jacks before.  The store wasn't real busy, it was only just after 11,  and the manager came out and chatted with me while I was waiting for my order and she was cleaning the soda fountain dispensers.  While I always get take out at the one near me I would consider eating in at this one.  The whole atmosphere it different.

The ultimate cheeseburger, bacon/cheese potato wedges and the cheesecake were all as expected."}
{"text":"OK, I'll fess up.   Jack in the Box is one of my favorite fast food places to grab a quick burger.  This location is between my shop and my bank so I would venture to say I have been here at least 30 times in the last 17 years.  Being in downtown it is always a surprise what you will find going on.  Quite often there will will a police action going on in the parking lot or the dining room which shuts the place down.  It has recently been the scene of a dining room remodel going on throughout the chain which includes high top tables.

Today I chose the grilled pastrami sandwich by itself to take out.  It isn't too bad and has been reviewed well by those that track fast food stuff.  Today's drama was the woman working the counter with her family eating in the dining room and she had to borrow a buck from her daughter so she could have something to eat on her break."}
{"text":"Sign up for the card, you get something free when you do. Okay that's all I have to say about a Jack in the Crack restaurant."}
{"text":"**sigh** I have a love hate relationship with Crack-in-the-box.  Oddly enough, I love their eggrolls and sourdough hamburger but try to not eat anything else! Unfortunately, they just added mini funnel cakes to the menu.  I had to try them.  Happy to report they won't be a new addiction.

Morons. And you idiots are crying for $15 an hour?? How the hell would you know the difference considering you can't count to 3?!"}
{"text":"I am saddened to have to give this otherwise tasty burger chain such a low rating.

First, I stopped by this JitB on my way to do some other things lated Friday morning, 5/4/18. The customer service at the Drive Thru was prompt and friendly. And, my Jr Jack with Cheese tasted pretty good. The cheese + tomato were nice and fresh. And, the lettuce crisp. The meat was nicely warmed, without being too hot. However, it was a bit grisly (up to this point, the review would have been 4 Stars).

Unfortunately, at around 12:50A.M., I was battling a case of food poisoning for over 3 hours (shivering, shaking and chattering teeth while under a blanket in a 79 degree room).

I don't know if it was from the Mayo being left out too long. Or, worse, that they used recalled Romain lettuce.

But, because of this bad experience, I won't be going back."}

{"text":"When I was in college, Jack in the Box was the go to place over all the other fast food joints for late, late night meals. There was just something about it, almost everything was so flavorful and satisfying. I distinctly remember the taste when out late studying or out late having a fun night. The Jumbo Jack and the two regular tacos were the best tasting to me. After college, I moved to another state that didn't have a Jack. Now I have moved back somewhere that has it and I have to say I am pretty disappointed. The quality has gone wayyyy down. I ordered my usual and the Jumbo Jack had no flavor at all and was ultra bland. You could tell it was not fresh. The regular tacos were also a bit off with how they were usually made, but it was okay. Overall, I was excited to have it only to be let down by how much it has gone south in terms of quality. What a shame, I will not be going back at all unless they turn it around. Two stars for the nostalgia factor."}

Today I was hoping to get a bit of breakfast on my way to work. I pulled in, I saw someone inside, got to the speaker and waited. Waited much longer than I normally do. I left. Hungry. Cranky. When my coworkers ask me why I'm cranky, I'll refer them to this Jack in the Box. I won't be referring anyone else here though and I won't be back."}
{"text":"Very bad customer service, no wonder why people think bad about us latinos! The guy that took my order talked super fast and I felt i was being rushed. I received my order and a guy that was there before me asked about his order, and the girl over the counter started saying (in spanish) that the food was sitting there but they didnt know for who it was.

I ended my burger and a Sir comes in to buy a cup of coffee and the girl tells him in a very rude tone \"You will have to wait there's no coffee ready, DO YOU WANNA WAIT?\", it was rude.

The food was like always."}

I hastily ordered seasoned, curly fries and 3 egg rolls yesterday evening after a rough day at work. Okay, and a cheeseburger. And, Sprite. I had a bad day - don't judge!

I arrived home in Fountain Hills and tore open my grease-splattered, hot bag of treats. My eggrolls were not in the bag but yet I was charged. Grrr - hate when that happens. Drive-thru lady was friendly but needs to double check bag orders to not piss off drive-thru patrons.

Plus my fries tasted like they were sitting in the warmer for awhile. Dry and crunchy. Don't be lazy staff - dump and start again. Please! :)"}

{"text":"Service was good price way to high. What is it with these fast food places using cheese dip on burritos, tacos etc instead of real cheese? Bought a burrito  from Jack in the Box 43rd. Ave and Bethany Home Rd. Glendale, Az. 
Kind of costly, not every good, but the kicker was when I took a bite the cheese sauce squirted out, now I have a ruined pair of jeans (new) and a blouse. Went right home treated them to no avail.  That stuff is pure oil, and to me it also  makes the food seem slimy  I and my whole family and friends are boycotting every fast food place that is now using this to cut cost. You would think for almost $5. for a burrito they would at least use real cheese and not fake crap
NO I am not happy, I just got those jeans,  and I did complain to them.
Single star only for service. They were nice and fast."}
{"text":"A year ago I would have probably rated this place with 2 stars.  Recent makeover and this place looks a lot better inside.  The employees have also been very friendly the last few times I've gone in and have gotten my order right each time; something that wasn't common here and most fast food places in the area.  Good turnaround.

Now, I'm not saying this is a four star restaurant or anything like that... Just 4 stars for a fast food place."}

Guy could barely speak English, confused 2 tacos with no cheese for a breakfast jack and a biscuit sandwich, pulled up to window and he was talking in his headset to another employee and said \"wish we could just turn this sign off\". Seriously? Messed up a simple order, went back through the line and he just put the bag out the window and didn't even make eye contact and said \"dat it\". Didn't receive a receipt and food was gross. Will NEVER go back to this location. Go to whataburger on 43rd and bell, the night guy there is awesome!"}

Please make sure there is no sauce on my tacos--as dry as you can give them to me.\"  Then repeated what I ordered and asked him if that is exactly what I got--extra lettuce BUT NO SAUCE.  He said \"yep, that's it!\"  So I took my food.  Not that it matters but I ordered this way because 1) I was all in white, on way to business appt. and didn't want taco sauce to drip on my clothing and 2) tummy can't tolerate their fatty and spicy sauce.  So I pull out one of the tacos and you guessed it,  There was so much \"sauce,\" on it,  I didn't even get it to my mouth, and all over my blouse AND pants it went.  And didn't get extra lettuce either!  The taco was literally soaked in greasy sauce. Then went home, blouse not permanently stained and ruined and late for my appt.  On top of that, their phone has been busy for the last 3 hours.  Good grief!!!!"}

They are what makes it worth it to me. It's in a convenient location, which is nice.

@It's also the area around the store, that really comes down to the city and the people, over all.

Wow, just wow, now that I got a few to think, their food was bad, it was just thrown together and then then Niagara Falls of sauce, I guess to cover up that they didn't give me what I wanted, or show that they really care for my safety, as their was so much sauce that I don't even think that it was hot at all, like it was a cold 1one that they had sitting their; for this is the worst Jack in the box that I have ever been too.. ..as, that Jack in the Box, has a high stander ed to step it up, as McDonald have given fast food a bad rap, as Taco Bell is next in line and yup, this jack in the box was lower then McDonald's and that saying something.....I will not be happy if I have to eat what ever they think us food when really it's trash  covered in a ocean of sauce that hides how uncool the food is and how over baring lack of cleaning show me that they must pay their # #healthfoodinspector , for I don't think that they would pass if they had to be videoed for the text...for sure their is something off about that place...as when I came into that place their be the workers sitting down  and 1one  running around in the back as the 1one gets up to help us, as still over looking that fact that the floor be wow, food trash and all kinda stuff I bet that was not in customer eye sit. #date #dating #6#18#16#61816 @4:29pm#jackinthebox #vJackInTheBoxstorewtfe# #vstorewtfe  #needsome #deepclean #whatif#andthen #whatisthat #bathroom #mansbathrooms #mensroom#cakedpee#unwhipped , #undertoylet#unwhipped , #undertoylet #toylet"}

I always order the Southwest Salad,this morning 9/19/15 around 1 am I pulled in and ordered my salad, the girl lets call her (lil smiley flacka) not her real name but she sounded like she had never worked in public before but I made my order and pulled around to the window and she just put her hand out to take my card, and gave it back and said \"here you go\" I was like okay? So as I waited a male voice \"sounded like a young kid\" was shouting things at random, I could hear another customer placing an order thru the speaker when they finished the girl that took my card and would be handing me my salad soon \"yelled\"out to someone sitting in the office and a guy standing behind them \"WHAT THE F***\" except she said the actual word. The guy that I am guessing was preparing my food never stopped yelling things from the back. 

I worried that if the people are obviously too immature and under qualified to do their job then they are probably the kind of people that would mess with your food. And sadly I saw what looked like a manager was sitting in the office while this was Happening."}
{"text":"Okay, is there something going on with fast food places in the Valley?  Or is it all over?  Places seem to be doing something with their meat that I am not liking.

I used to really like Jack's Ultimate Cheeseburger, and the Jumbo Jack has been a favorite of mine since the '70s.  Now yuk.  Something has changed.  It's almost like they are trying to duplicate some greasy freshly barbecued taste and failing BADLY.

I hope you guys don't change your tacos or egg rolls or I won't have much of a reason to go anymore.  If I need a fast burger, I'll go to McD and get a burger there.  They'd never change.

Of course, they changed Coke, so I guess I shouldn't say never. . ."}

{"text":"I used to like Jack in the Box, but have had multiple arguments with employees at the drive thru over the last year. Cashiers arguing that the deals listed outside on the building are wrong. Ordered a combo and two tacos that as advertised by this store under the order board two tacos 99cents with any combo. Either train your staff in customer service, or get rid of them. I know it's only a 30cent difference, but why are they going to argue about their own promotion. I can't rate this experience any lower. I actually just drove down the street to another, better place. Refused to even go look at the sign. I hope they go out of business! Nothing would make my day happier.

Argued with an incompetent employee over the promotion on their store. If your employee or employees refuse to honor your ads, maybe they should not work with customers. Or with your chain. Argued for 5 minutes with an employee who said his name is Joe, that the signs on your building we're not true. 3/20/18 at 1145pm drive thru window. I wish I could rate lower than one star from my experience this evening. I'd say it left a bad taste in my mouth, but I received better food service at a competitor across the street.

{"text":"While I do not eat fast food as much I used to, I used to eat at Jack in the Box (different locations) all of the time.  I was on my way home recently from playing sports and had a hankering for a sourdough jack (my favorite) and some jalapeno poppers.  My girlfriend was with me and decided to try the sirloin burger.  What a disaster.

We were exhausted and live close by so we went straight home after hitting the drive through, only to find out that we did not receive the poppers that we paid for.  On top of that, the burgers were sub par and the fries were burnt (a shame because they were curly fries).  I had not eaten at JITB in quite some time and this experience has solidified why I had stopped going in the first place.  

Perhaps I should have checked the bag before leaving the drive through but when there are only a couple of cars in the drive through and no one in the restaurant, should I really have to?  Especially at 10pm when things are slow.  I will not be returning to this location and more than likely will not return to any others either.  It is a shame because the food used to be so good."}

Depending on the time of day, this Jack-In-the-Box will be hosting a steady stream of Cocopah Middle Schoolers, or a crowd of Chaparral High School students or a parade of young adults sobering up from a night of partying. And let's not forget Jack's core target demographic, the late night stoner suffering from the munchies. 

That's what a diverse snack-oriented menu, a dining room open until midnight and a drive-thru open 24 hours a day, will do for you. And it doesn't hurt that most of the workers here are very friendly."}

As others have stated, the guy (manager?) working the drive thru was super nice and chipper and the tacos were probably the best JITB tacos I have had in quite some time.  Most of the time, they are soggy in the middle and oily and greasy, but these ones today were fantastic!  Crispy the whole way through, the perfect amount of lettuce and sauce and everything worked well!  The only difference was the price...they were always 2 for $.99 (Price never changed, kind of like the Costco hot dog deal) but they have raised the price up to $1.19 now.  Still, for $2.50 you get 4 tacos and that is enough to fill you up.  I was impressed with this particular JITB and it is the closest one to work, so I know I will be back eventually."}
{"text":"This Jack in the Box is sub par even for JitB's.  The line is usually slow and the placement in the parking lot makes it accessible only if you're traveling East on Bell; otherwise it's a lot of parking lot to work through to get to it.  You gotta really want JitB."}
{"text":"We stopped in to cash in our free taco coupons we got from the Suns game. It seems like there is a Jack in the Box on almost every corner here and this location is very clean although the service was a little slow. 
I don't know what's in the taco's (and I don't want to know) but we love them."}

I will not stand for your shit. Not showing up in time is not acceptable. Due to your lack of attendance, I was unable to order my breakfast jacks, curly fries, tacos, and my drink. I'm a hungry girl, and because you not being there, the girl that was on time wasn't able to help me. She stated \"it is impossible for me to do everything by myself\". Which, girl that has no name, is not cool either. Plus, your grammar is horrible. I'm super salty right now, and hangry. So thanks for ruining my morning."}

It's a decent fast food option but not worth waiting over 20 minutes for. There's a Whataburger 2 miles South and McDonald's 2 miles North on 35th Ave that are both open all night long.

The directional note on yelp is incorrect; it's on the SW corner of the intersection."}

HIGHLY recommended!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why we continue to frequent this location! The drive thru totally blows, you can never hear them, they never replay your order and the never tell you your total until you get to the window!

Went thru after a night out to get food for my son's friends. Pretty simple order too! Two tacos no sauce, two regular tacos, two sausage croissants, one Jumbo Jack, one regular fry! Pull away, without checking and if you know with this location the drive leads to 35th Ave there is no turning back! Get home and we have two tacos, one with sauce, one without, three sausage croissants and no fry! Seriously people and you all want $12 an hour but you can't get an order right!

Fast forward to yesterday after picking kids up from school we were going to celebrate surviving the first week of school. Pull up, 3 cars in front of me. Order 3 regular shakes, wait in line in 105 degree weather, get to the window and the lady tells me my total and the manager stops her! He proceeds to tell me they don't have shakes that they forgot to put the mix in the machine! I probably wouldn't have cared but the manager is the person who took my order and f he would have told me that when we ordered the boys would have just ordered something else! Churro or a burger! 

We love the choices that come with JITB but seriously they never get it right!"}
