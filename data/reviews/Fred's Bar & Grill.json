{"text":"We are far from \"regulars\" but at the same time, this was not our first trip to Fred's, but based on the \"service\" we received tonight, it may be our last. 

With neither my wife nor myself wanting to cook tonight, my wife suggested Fred's. Every time we've dropped in, we've had to sit at the bar, which is less than comfortable when it comes to eating. When we arrived, we were happy to see an open table. 

We sat down, and a waitress approached us. We were a little put off by her introduction... not \"Hi, can I get you a menu / drink?\" rather we were greeted with \"Yeah, I'm going to have to move you, because this table wants more space for people who are coming\". Another larger space opened up, and the large table moved. 

Another waitress then came to our table and said \"Oh, there's only two of you? I have to move you to a smaller table\". She didn't bother to ask if a) we wanted to move or b) we had other people coming. \"Or we could just leave\" we said, and the waitress' response was \"Okay\"? 

This is NOT how to respond to a dissatisfied customer. It's also not how to make a guest feel welcome in your establishment. If you don't want smaller groups sitting at larger tables, maybe you should spring for a hostess to greet people at the door, rather than leave it to the customers? It's just as well, because I don't think we would have been comfortable with the cigarette smoke wafting in from the open door on the patio, where the bar turns a blind eye to guests who choose to smoke at their tables."}
{"text":"Food is absolutely amazing! And very well priced. Service is good and very \"chill\" atmosphere. 5 stars from me!"}
{"text":"Went their with a bud in the pouring rain we got greeted and took a seat at the bar, 

The bartender was up to us within moments and we ended up getting a pitcher got to us fairly quickly.

Eventually we got the wings and pitcher combo for 40 some dollars, and i have to say the wings are incredible. I tried the Cajun and my friend got the honey garlic; both were good but i prefer dry wings.

Overall it was a pretty good experience fast service, good food, fast on the cheque.

Oh ps the atmosphere is great!"}
{"text":"Nice staff, good food, a lot of tv's,  good prices and clean. Went there with a group of 7, had good seating. Good looking place, recommended for everyone."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar for 10 min before the bartender acknowledged me. Pathetic!! Waitresses come and pour their beer but don't acknowledge you sitting at the bar. They just chit chat with each other and customers sit and wait before they get service."}
{"text":"Fred's is great. The food is awesome, The atmosphere is amazing  and the service is excellent. The only  drawback is that there is not that much space. Some of my favourites are the grilled calamari it's in a olive oil with garlic,lemon and tomatoes perfect combination. The wings are really meaty. The buffalo wing pizza is to die for topped with chicken thigh chunks in buffalo sauce,tomato sauce,green onions,scallions,pico de Gallo and south west sauce on a 6\" crust perfect for one hungry man. I would come back any day for this."}
{"text":"Don't let the name and the exterior fool you. This is an upscale bar with all the trimmings. The waitress was very cheerful and attentive. I have only had pub food there but all was perfect:: the fries were hot and the beer frosty and cold. Why go to Toronto?"}
{"text":"Friendly mgmt and staff. Amazing and reasonably priced food: pizza, fish and chips, chicken wings, hot sandwiches... all to do die for!! No kidding!! A fantastic out of the way find and now a regular joint for me and my family."}
{"text":"Service seems to be hit and miss, the bartenders evidently seem to keep the place running while the waitresses will attend to their patrons only after they have decided to stop chatting or eating with each other. That being said, the food is great and the beer is cold and Fred always welcomes you with a smile."}
{"text":"I went to Fred's Bar & Grille and it was an awful experience. The waitress and the ladies at the bar were great, however, the older male hostess was sexist and rude. There was an opened table as I walked in but he told us the wait would be roughly 15 mins, and we said that was fine to wait. He then came back and said it would be 45 minutes but we could sit at the bar. While at the bar the lady was confused on why the man was not trying to get us a table and told us to sit at the large table that was available. The man then came and told us very ignorantly that if other people come we would have to move other and he would sit them beside us. It was understandable but his approach was unnecessarily rude. As a group of males came in, he basically kicked us out and it was the most sexist and disgusting treatment ever to receive."}
{"text":"I grew up just around the corner from Fred's B&G, and have been many times over too many years I'd care to mention.  They renovated about a few year ago, so the place looks better than it once did - and it is about time as the old decor made it look like someones parents' outdated basement - that's not a good thing.

 For the good: the wings are pretty good tasting - unhealthy, but good.  The fries are golden and crisp.  

 For the bad: the calamari - apparently the 'best in Mississauga' is chewy/rubbery, and drowned in garlic.  Obviously those that claim it to be the best haven't had calamari the way it is supposed to be made with the correct texture, and they obviously love garlic.  The men's bathroom is gross, and I don't think I've ever actually seen it reasonably clean in +20 years.

 All this being said, the one thing that really bothers me is somehow they can't seem to properly clean their glasses.  I have been going there for at least 20 years (as my friends insist on making it their neighborhood bar) and I can easily count on one hand the times that I've had a clean glass to drink from.  Seriously.

 I rarely go to Fred's now, instead opting to not see my friends, or see them at other venues or gatherings.  When I do go, I make sure I order a bottle of beer - I'm over the dirty glasses."}
{"text":"Seems to be busy, unlike the previous occupants of this location. Good food at a reasonable price. The 3g burger is my quick meal choice. The souvlaki dinners are quite good, but they lack lamb, which is annoying. The greek poutine creation is also worth trying. The butternut soup warms me up nicely on cold days as well. Decore needs work, but that was inherited fromnthe previous occupants. Overall, if you are in the area, worth stopping by."}
{"text":"Completely agree agree with the other review that describes the poor service of the waitresses. We just waited 40 minutes for a wrap and grilled calamari. After finishing, we waited another 10-15 minutes until I had to go up and ask for the bill from our server who was standing around with 5 other servers at the bar. 

The atmosphere was nice and the food was decent, but not worth sitting through that service."}
{"text":"Food and people are great. This restaurant is a family business, and management eeally values your business.The renovation has really updated the look and feel. Calamari is amazing.  Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"I went there in a recommendation from my friend. I was looking for a place for wings. This place so far has the best Chicken wings in GTA. You will not be disappointed by this place."}
{"text":"Lots of TVs so they can show many different games.   Friendly staff - especially the owners.   Food is what one expects from a sports bar:  pizza, burgers, sandwiches, pizza, nachos, etc."}
{"text":"A large group of us came here for lunch. It was not very busy. Was able to sample a bunch of stuff on the menu. Nice little bar and our waitress was very nice.  I can imagine its pretty busy on game night, lots of TVs and a big bar. 

Sadly we had not been drinking at noon and noticed some of the food we ordered to be very so so. The prices were OK so we didn't feel bad. 

Food:

Grilled Calamari: 1.5/5 Supposedly a famous dish and the reason we came here. Meh. It visually looked good but that's about it. The calamari was chewy and the lemon sauce was so overpowering. It should be called sour calamari. The calamari is breaded and drenched in the lemon sauce. Definitely get the lemon sauce on the side. 

Poutine: 4/5 Standard poutine and the fries were decent. Was a decent size 2. 

Gorgonzola Bacon Burger: 4/5 Pretty decent burger, needs more bacon.

White pizza: 1/5 Not recommended. Taste like grease, mush and bread. Prob should try something with tomato sauce. 

Buffalo chicken wrap: 3/5 Nothing special.

wrap on special menu( was a beef wrap i think?): 3/5 nothing special either about a subway wrap quality.

Fish sandwich: 4/5 Quite yummy and messy. Oddly enough the onion rings were even better then the burger thou. Wish they gave a little more rings."}
{"text":"Stopped in to enjoy a local spot.  The staff was very nice and genuine.  There were allot of mid size tvs for the sports fan.  The menu had allot to offer.  Overall a great experience.  Don't let the strip mall fool you.  Head on in and enjoy some food and drink.

Food 8/10
Ambience 7/10
Service 9/10"}
{"text":"They've just done a renovation on this place and it looks great. The food is really good and they always have daily food features. If you live in the area, it's definitely a good option for watching sports, grabbing a drink, or a quick bite to eat. They've added several large tvs to the place, so watching different games is no longer an issue. Food and drink prices are pretty standard."}
{"text":"Freds has the best wings I've ever had. They don't have three pages of flavors but what they do have they do well. I like getting the mild tossed in the bbq. The Cajun spice is nice as well. Will always come here when having a craving for chicken wings"}
{"text":"A couple of friends that have been going here for years got me on this place.  Coming from the west end of Sauga I wish we had a more joints like this out my way. 

What makes it great?  Well in a nutshell the service, food, and atmosphere are all top notch.  It is hard to find bars in Mississauga with true character but Fred's fits the bill. 

The beer selection is good and the waitresses are all super friendly.  The owner will walk around greeting and checking in with customers.  There are a lot of regulars too and there is a real welcoming vibe about the place. 

I have been here for a couple of sporting events and there isn't a bad seat in the house. Great atmosphere as well with everyone getting into the game. 

As for food everything had been good but the real standout is the grilled calamari. I have had it at some top end Greek and Italian restaurants and I honestly think Fred's is the best I've had.  Cut thick, seasoned and grilled perfectly and topped with an awesome bruschetta mix with bread for dipping. Can't recommended it enough."}
{"text":"You usually don't find a restaurant like Fred's in a strip mall like this. It's a newly-renovated, modern looking sports bar located on Bloor west of Cawthra. 

It appears to be a local hotspot as there is a sense of community among the customers each time I visit. Fred, the owner, was actually the one who seated my party during my last visit. Pretty impressive.

If you look at the walls, there are some pretty famous people that have visited over the years, most of them being hockey players. You get the sense that Fred's is a hockey bar first and can count on them showing whatever game is on. The walls are lined with TVs and every seat has a good view. 

I've been to Fred's two times now, once before renovating and once after. Both times I have gotten the 40 wings + domestic pitcher for $44 deal. We did the math and this deal is comparable to the typical half price wing deals offered at other wing establishments, but the advantage at Fred's is that this deal is on 7 days a week as part of their normal menu. 

There aren't too many flavours available - I recall seeing about 10. All of the ones I've tried have been good, but I'd advise to stay away from the cajun. It's very dry and the powder doesn't really stay on too well, resulting in a bare fried wing. 

Ps. get your wings grilled after they are fried! This always adds a nice touch :)"}
{"text":"Fred's is one of those places that is really pretty impossible to dislike. Just for fun, let's try asking a few questions about it:

Is the food out of this world? It's pretty good, but nothing earth shattering, even for pub food.

Do they have the best selection of beers on tap? No, pretty much just your standard domestics, imports and premiums.

Is the service the most friendly and attentive? It's perfectly pleasant but nothing to write home about.

And yet...it has this certain inescapable charm and super positive vibe. I can't quite put my finger on it. Maybe it's because my dad was taking me here since I was a kid. I remember that the chicken wings were plump and juicy and even though I'm now a vegetarian, I'm told that they're still among the best in the city. I usually stick to the pizza and fries when I drop by (with or without the old man) and I'm rarely disappointed. Dad has moved on to calamari for the most part and still, no complaints about the quality of the food. It remains tasty, the beer is still cold and the place hasn't changed, which is a good thing in this case.

So I guess it's more than just nostalgia. It really is a pretty great neighborhood pub and if you drop by, be sure to say hi to Father Mike...he's not there in person but they've been good in keeping his memory alive for many years. Quite a classy place."}
{"text":"Pretty good little local bar with good food choices.
Actually they have a pretty large extensive menu .
Wings are good and they have a good wing beer deal !!
Place is clean and staff is friendly ! 
It does get busy especially during a game !
Come check them out !"}
{"text":"Finally tried Fred's after many recommendations. We were not disappointed, we had the grilled Calamari. It was delicious, not chewy at all. 
We also had the shrimp and chorizo, also good minus the fact the shrimp isn't peeled so you have to put in a little work. But the menu and waiter warned us about the shrimp. Regardless great food and service. It was a sunny day so we sat on the patio, the waiter and Fred brought us an umbrella. 
 
We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great wings. Large size and lots of meat. Well priced. Great service. They have other items but the wings are king here. 

4.25/5 *"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Fred's on a Wednesday night around 6pm and the place was packed.  Luckily, we got the last of two tables in the back. 

There's nothing extravagant about the décor as it's just your typical neighborhood sports bar but it's very inviting and the staff are extremely friendly.  I have to repeat, it's not fancy on the inside - don't expect it to resemble a Firkin pub.  There were lots of TVs around showing all the games and good music playing in the background.

The menu was pretty extensive for a local joint but, I've heard so much about the wings being one of the best in 'Sauga, that I had to try them.  We ordered the following:  ten suicide wings, grilled calamari, muscles in a tomato sauce and a pint of Keith's each.  The beer came quickly but it was a bit of a wait for the rest of the food; however, all three dishes arrived hot, fresh and at the same time.  

Let me tell you, the wings were out of this world!  I don't even remember the last time I had wings that good.  They were big, juicy, so crispy on the outside and cooked and flavored to perfection - no breading or any of that guck!  As I said, we ordered suicide but it was more like a hotter wing but, again, so much flavor.

I heard a lot of good things about the grilled calamari but, in my opinion, I thought it was just okay.  The calamari was a bit overdone and I didn't care for the bread crumb topping because, as it reached room temperature, it soaked up the olive oil, thus making the dish oily.  It was kind of pricy too; around $15 for a relatively small plate but the lemon, garlic and olive oil sauce was really delicious - next time I'd try the fried calamari though.

Nothing to complain about when it came to the muscles - good portion and good quality seafood and I recall the dish not being too expensive.

I should mention that the beer was spot-on too - nice, cold and refreshing.

I do have to stress that the wings were, honestly, superior to some of the best places - they were like what you'd get in Buffalo, NY.  They were seriously that good!  We try not to eat wings too much but now I'm afraid I'm going to be craving them all the time.

Anyway, if you're in the neighborhood, give this place a try.  Bottom line: friendly service, affordable and good quality food."}
{"text":"now that all-star wings in meadowvale closed (RIP), i'm forced to drive far to hit up a good sports bar for raptors games (keyword: good.  i ain't tryna roll up to a boston pizza or bww), and fred's is usually where i end up.  literally millions of TVs line the walls here, so any seat is a good seat for sports viewing.  the loud and rowdy crowd really makes for a perfect sports bar atmosphere.

the drink list is pretty standard here, with a few entry-level craft options, but i care way more about the food.  the grilled calamari lives up to the hype - lightly-battered squid pieces cooked to a perfect tenderness, swimming in a shallow pool of lemony buttery oil.  probably the best calamari dish i've ever had, anywhere.  please try it.  the wings are also great.  they're chunky and large, and their buffalo butter sauce is to die for.  i've also tried their \"the port\" pizza (tomato, mozza, anchovies, basil), and was really impressed.

easily mississauga's best sports bar.  see you here during the next raptors game!"}
{"text":"It's the atmosphere that definitely sells this place and makes it the local bar you wanna come back to for sporting events or group meet-ups. The service wasn't bad but wasn't note-worthy either. The food was good, but average. I enjoyed the grilled calamari but my girlfriend wasn't a big fan. This was due to lots of lemon. Their wings were okay, and my spicy sausage sandwich was okay. The onion rings were 100% identical to harvey's."}
{"text":"Tip:  If you're drinking, maybe stick to beer!

Atmosphere - 5/5 (especially during a sporting event, full of fans!)
Food/Drink - 2-2.5/5

Much larger than it appears on the outside, Fred's is a sports bar with a neighbourhood feel AND an outdoor patio!  I found the waitress was quite friendly.

Food/drink, based on what I had (Margherita pizza, fish tacos, & mojito) were very mediocre.  Drinks were low-priced, but I barely tasted any alcohol in my mojito, mint wasn't muddled enough.  I guess the price:alcohol ratio were in-line.  Not much taste in the pizza and fish tacos were edible, a bit on the bland side, I probably wouldn't order them again.  Prices were average, definitely not cheap.

I wouldn't be opposed to going back, but not in a hurry either."}
{"text":"Calamari is unreal. Beer is always good on tap. Amazing service and killer atmosphere."}
{"text":"First time here and, despite all the good reviews our experience was just okay. When we first arrived our server seemed very nice, but unfortunately wait times for food took a while and our chicken bites were cold. When we confronted the server, she got all defensive and took the chicken bites and put them in the oven therefore it became soggy. We had asked again for them to remake, she agreed but we did receive much attitude. Food was mediocre and could find food similar somewhere else. Would not come back"}
{"text":"Solid 4-4.5 . First visit there last night for Leafs, Raptors, TFC extravaganza sports night. Place was packed, but we had a reso so we were good to go. 

Our server Pamela was very attentive and anytime a new member of our group showed up she was promptly over to get them a drink. 

Drinks were great, we were never left looking for a top up, Pamela was on point with the service. 

Food-wise we split Nachos, Fried Calamari & Wings. All the food was good. Calamari was especially good. Suicide wasn't really suicide, for the wings, but all the flavours were tasty (Chipotle BBQ, Hot & Honey Garlic were the others we tried).

Will definitely be back again to try some more menu items, possibly during the World Cup. 

Kudos to Pamela for being on her game even with a packed out bar & dining area. She was a star!

This has potential to become the new \"regular\" for me & my friends. 

Definitely recommend visting and giving it a try. 

A shame the Leafs couldn't pull through and TFC lost on pennos, but that's not Fred's Bar & Grill's fault. LoL."}
{"text":"Hands down the best calamari around haven't tasted it's equal yet and don't think I ever will, staff are kind and friendly."}
{"text":"Love coming to Fred's, I think they need to expand once more though because that place gets packed-hah!! The staff are friendly and they always greet and chat with everyone- atmosphere and ambiance are great!

Their grilled calamari is the best in town and I haven't tasted anything better in Canada to date! 

I have tried a selection of their menu items and specials and everything has always been exceptional, tasty and a fair portion size!

It's a great local spot with yummy food and drinks - can't complain.

Perfect in my books ...just sometimes the seating gets tight or the wait becomes long (but it's expected when you're a popular local spot)."}
