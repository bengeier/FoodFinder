{"text":"The best fries in the city.  Thick and crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside.  Always made fresh. Way better than that trash they serve at McDonald's."}
{"text":"Great food had a very enjoyable time here and the service was fantastic!"}
{"text":"You gotta respect food trucks which stay open late into the night when there is snow on the ground and a RealFeel© of 12°F.  Couldn't have been a more perfect meal at 11:45pm after a long day of delayed flights.  Poutine: Thick cut fries that managed to be crispy on the outside and soft inside. A very generous amount of warm gooey brown gravy packed with umami. The cheese curds were nice, but a little sparse."}
{"text":"Every time I walk by Nathan Phillip square I have to come here! The poutine here is so good and the fresh cut fries are always made fresh every time I've come.   They have lots of different options like poutine, hot dogs, sausages, fries, etc! Service is great, even during busy times like New Years or other events.   Been coming here for years, will keep doing so!"}
{"text":"They have a lot of food truck on downtown...I have there food here too.I surprise that there any reviews  yet and its been a long time...but the food is very good.."}
