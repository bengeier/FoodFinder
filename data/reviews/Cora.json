{"text":"Service is really, really, but really bad :'(  our waitress came to our table once to take our order 25 min after we arrived, no coffee. I had to stand up and served it myself . then the food came 45 min after we ordered it and our waitress did not give a fork as I did not have any utensils."}
{"text":"Pros: good food( Cora special) , good service   Con: very busy Sunday morning long wait"}
{"text":"I always like going to this place, it's homey. The downside is that you come out smelling like fried food too."}
{"text":"Rien de bien spécial. C'est un Cora comme les autres - très bon déjeuner - et le service est correcte. J'dois dire que c'est particulièrement pratique pour les lendemain de brosse. Autrement, j'aime bien leur verrière."}
{"text":"Cora's is by far my favorite breakfast joint. Food is very tasty and every dish comes with assorted fruits or veggies which are a novelty compared to most Americanized family style breakfast restaurants. They also have very creative dishes to give you lots of choices apart from your regular bacon/sausage and eggs that you can get anywhere else. The only problem is that there are always huge line ups outside on Saturday and Sunday mornings (but it's definitely worth the wait). My family and I were very impressed with the service, the atmosphere and the food. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food was great, although there were a couple of moldy grapes. Sat on a piece of gum which sucked, but the manager took some money off the bill. Would go again despite a bad first experience."}
{"text":"*adventurous, delicious and if you want healthy and definitely large portions*  I don't think it's right that Cora's only has 3 stars as average rating.  This is an awesome place for breakfast with lots of unusual choices, but all extremely delicious.  There seems to be a usual wait time at weekends and the only complaint I could have is that I got the impression that they tried to keep a the line out there to push their reputation. As we got seated, there was suddenly lots of place around us and still a short line.  However, once you get your order served, you can enjoy really delicious food and basically all dishes come with a lot of tasty fruits.  Well, I wish the place had a nicer and more unique atmosphere, but for me taste is more important and Cora's definitely delivers. The service was also nice and helpful."}
{"text":"I love Cora's for breakfast! It is a chain - but much healthier and tastier than most of the sit-down breakfast chains. I don't recommend it on weekends for breakfast/brunch because it is usually VERY busy. This one is smaller than the one I go to in the north - but their food is consistent, and I have never left dissatisfied."}
{"text":"I'm giving this one star because we didn't even have a chance to eat anything. After being seated we waited 15 minutes and not one server said a word to us. To me this is unacceptable service and even the excuse of it being busy unacceptable. There should be enough servers to cover all of the tables but even if the server for our section would have acknowledged us and said they would be with us shortly it would have been better than nothing but after listening to the table beside us talking about how they have been waiting for for half an hour for their food we let . Definitely will not be returning, there are far better places for breakfast in the city that obviously appreciate their customers far better. Total fail Cora's."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast. Plates come out just like the menu pictures. Not very fast so don't go here if you are in a hurry. Food is a little pricey but tasty."}
{"text":"Not quite sure what people really see in this place.  The prices are fairly reasonable (expensive if you compare to your local greasy spoon), while the food is just plain bad.    A breakfast place that can't cook eggs?    Yup, rubbery omelettes and semi-raw / semi-burnt skillet fries with dry fruit that must have been cut the day before - I've been here twice and experienced the same.    My expectations for breakfast are basic and this place cannot cut it.  The menu options are 'trying to be fancy' but fall flat on their face.  If you don't believe me go and be disappointed for yourself.  Stay home or go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Honestly, this is a decent restaurant chain but very overrated. The food is good, but certainly not exceptional enough to deserve the rather high price tag. Everything at all Cora's restaurants is quite expensive - four dollars for a glass of orange juice!! - and frankly I just don't think it's worth it."}
{"text":"Very friendly service and good food, we really enjoy our mornings to spend there."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie, Chez Cora in Toronto just ain't the same as the ones in Quebec. I'm not sure if it's a franchise and they skimp on the portions because it's more about the bottom line in Toronto, or if it's because Torontonians don't quite appreciate a good brunch the same way Quebecers do, but it's just not as good. The fruit is never as fresh and the presentation and portion size is about half what they are at all the locations in Montreal. There's a cheapness about it that is unique to Toronto. However, it's a great place for a breakfast meeting, and they have a ton of variety on the menu. After all, Cora's is known for every kind of egg, crepe and pancake known to man, and that is exactly what you'll find here."}
{"text":"Jeez. I'm honestly really surprised by the terrible reviews here.  Most of them seem rather old though...and this is the only Cora's that I've been too and I like it so many people have had bad experiences at other locations?  I've been here a few times now and I've always found it to be consistent, good service, a good menu, and always hits the spot.  Love that the have healthier options and gluten free options.  I will return in the future!!!  Again....confused on the reviews!  Give this place a chance people!"}
{"text":"This is an eastern franchise that is hugely popular in Quebec (especially Montreal) as well as Atlantic Canada. The concept is great and the menu has many items to choose from. The presentation of the food is great. However, I'm not crazy about the taste. The lineups at the Calgary location could be very long. I've only been there once and it was the Saturday before Mother's Day. I'm not sure if that had anything to do with it.  I ordered the eggs benny and it was lukewarm/almost cold when it was served to me. My friend ordered the buckwheat crepes and it tasted very doughy (not the style of crepes that I care for).   In any case, it didn't impress me enough to warrant me to drive across town to give it a second shot."}
{"text":"I've never been to a Cora's before but someone recommended it to us so we went yesterday (Saturday) morning. I'm not sure what it's usually like but we had a 20-minute or so wait. Which is fine. The staff were all very friendly and the food came quickly. The hot chocolate was piled with whipped cream and was just wonderful. The food was good as well and effort was put into it looking nice. I was not, however, a fan of the thin and salty bacon. Big disappointment there. :( otherwise it was very good and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The food is OK. The servers are OK. The decor is what happens when its sunny little logo explodes.  I've been to this location a number of times as well as many others and you're guaranteed to be waiting in a line or witnessing a line-up form. The overwhelming menu is impressive (as are their fruit-art that accompanies your meal) but nothing that really blows up my skirt. I will admit, no other place has the option to sandwich an omelette in crepes (called a Bobby Button). Though I suppose if you add crepes to any brunch combo be it omelette, the Cora's Special (which is a delightful feast for the carnivore) or a pile of fruit (which is, I'm assuming, a delightful treat for the anti-carnivore), it classes it up big time. But in the end, all I have is a crepe that gets in the way of my cutting of ham/sausage (with the exception of the Bobby Button, of course)."}
{"text":"This was our second time to this location. Previously when we were here it had been snowing and the place was empty.   This time we met friends for brunch on a weekend and the place was crazy busy!! We waited approx 15 minutes for a table and it was another 15-20 minutes until our server finally came to take our drink orders. Granted she did stop by and drop off water (thankfully because it was smoking hot out!). There is a small patio area as well.  The food was consistent as always which is why I still gave this experience the 4/5 stars."}
{"text":"One star is for the tasty cappuccinos, however, the food was beyond gross.   - both of our breakfasts were served ice cold. - \"The Montrealer\" comes with a \"pork spread\" - basically a frozen puck of sludge that is actually the most disgusting thing in the world and makes all the other food in your plate cold too.  - there was a short curly hair in the hollandaise of my eggs benedict (ew!)  - oh yeah and the kicker, THERE WAS A LIVE BEETLE IN MY CANTALOUPE!   They ended up compensating our meals and apologizing.   Needless to say, my husband and I both lost our appetites."}
{"text":"Definitely arrive early and plan to wait awhile to get a table, but the staff are great and have menus outside with the line so you can decide what you want to eat before you even get inside. The service is great, the prices are decent, and the food is super delicious. I went with a fairly varied group (health nuts, meat eaters, junk food aholics, vegetarians) and we were all happy with our meals."}
{"text":"While I have only been to one restaurant in this chain, I can't say I was blown away.  The decor is bright and airy and presented (I think) to be upscale when it is not.  My pancakes were served with some awkwardly sliced banana which (again, I think) is supposed to leave me the impression that it's healthy.  The reality is - it's bland.  Call me crazy but when I'm out for breakfast, I want greasy spoon style eggs, hash browns, etc.  Beyond the food, the service was slow --- while I was with a big group, there was a 10 minute lag between the first and last plate.   +ives: clean, friendly staff; -ives: bland food, slow service"}
{"text":"This is a really good breakfast venues from Quebec. A great place for a family brunch, it can also be the final destination after a sleepless night out about town where you'd mostlikely get cleaner food than the scrumy diner with cigarette stains in the fake red leather seats where the same bucket water for the last four months has been used to mope the floors!  Now living in Ontario, it's rather uncommon to see a Cora's around yet it is still as good as back home. I always get the Sunshine Panini ham, next time I'll try the Spinach & Cheddar crepe. All the sweet desert-like breakfasts are really yummy. I'll admit, Cora's is on the pricy side, but you know your morning meal will fill you up until supper. Last time I went, my aunt and uncle who came down from the States enjoyed their breakfast, but the waitress brought me another omelette from the one I had ordered which was more expensive. She still charged us for more expensive because I ended up eating it as we had no time to have them prepare another one. I hate to use this irritating expression but the circumstance calls for it: \"It's not about the price, it is the principal!\" regardless, she shouldn't have rang in for her own mistake, at the least charge the one I wanted to get."}
{"text":"Cora didn't screw up Oatmeal.  Cappuccino was better than average.   Breakfast crepe panini (my wife's) was apparently top notch. Her fruit was just short of fermenting.   She ate it. So we've both been suffering."}
{"text":"Dined at Cora's for breakfast today. There was a long line and we had to wait 30mins for our food which on a Sunday morning isn't surprising so we didn't let that ruin our experience however... The food was very bland I got the pancakes and bacon. The bacon was super thin and the pancakes were extremely dry and flavorless. I didn't think pancakes could taste as bad as they did. The price was only 9.99 so I didn't lose that much but I left hungry since I didn't even eat one whole pancake. My meal also came with fruit which was really warm. I know some people like there fruit warm but I prefer it cold. That too went in the garbage. The server was extremely friendly and made small talk which was nice and the guy up at the front (assuming he's the manager) was also very friendly as we paid. Customer service was great food was bad tho."}
{"text":"Terrible. Found a hair in my food and the server looked embarrassed and ran away when I called her on it. Food is worse than an average greasy spoon and makes Fran's seem gourmet. Wouldn't recommend or go again."}
{"text":"(Blue Jay Way location) While visiting from Florida, we stopped here for breakfast because it was very close to the hotel and absolutely freezing outside! We have nothing bad to say about this place. We waited about 20 min, but to me that and all the awards displayed on the windows is a good sign. I had Theo's omelette and my boyfriend had the April 99 crepe. Simply fresh and delicious. I was impressed with the lack of grease that usually accompanies an omelette, bacon, and potatoes. Our waitress, Steph, was extremely friendly and never rushed us despite the constant line at the door. The negative reviews must be from the competition and/or people who can never be pleased."}
{"text":"Une belle équipe au travail et un patron proche des clients qui s'assure que tout roule très bien. Tout va rondement dans la gentillesse, la compétence et la qualité.  Merci Germain, Maria et toute l'équipe, vous nous donnez le goût de revenir!"}
{"text":"An excellent option for brunch with friends, if you can get table.  More breakfast options than you can shake a stick at, almost all served with at least half a plate of their signature assorted fresh fruit presented with flourish (so you can feel good about eating out).  Supposedly, people are addicted to the homemade lunch soups as well, but I'm avoiding it as I already have too many vices."}
{"text":"Excellent food and nice atmosphere  ! A great place for breakfast anytime you are in Toronto."}
{"text":"A lunch menu only available on the weekdays??? Stupidest idea ever... Came in on a day off a couple weeks ago and had a great sandwich - came in today and can't get it cause it's a weekday only item? Stupid stupid stupid. Wouldn't it make more sense to have weekend specials? With your ridiculous hours it's very difficult to make that work. Will not be coming back ever."}
{"text":"Took the whole crew to Cora's on a recent visit to Toronto. The line was long but moved fast.  The options were great.  Lots of fresh fruit.  Not so much for the 10 yr old who did not want any fruit near his plate but for the rest of us it was great.  They had a fresh fruit juice special that morning that was very tasty.  Portions were large, not too pricey (for Toronto).   Good service and nice staff.  Only real complaint was having to ask 3 times for sweetener for the coffee.    Worth the walk from the Hotel."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Cora's. It was super busy when I went, which is always a good sign. The vibrant atmosphere is added to by the awesome murals.  The coffee wasn't anything special, but it was free flowing, and the servers were always there to fill your cup. But this is nothing compared to the awesome food. I'm allergic to eggs, and so having more than the usual fruit salad was a lovely surprise. I thought I ordered a fruit salad and bagel, but what came was a beautiful work of art, with yoghurt topped with fresh fruit and a giant star fruit. On the side came more fresh and delicious fruit, and the bagel. I was one very happy customer!  I was super jealous of the plates of fried goodies everyone else had - just what I would have loved on a hungover morning, but I could take the high road with my healthy feast.   This is going to be my new local for brunch when I'm in Toronto, for sure."}
{"text":"If you are celiac the menu is pathetic and unappetizing - you also can't get greens for breakfast - not very accommodating"}
{"text":"Fantastic Staff.  Great Food.  Awesome Atmosphere.   I've always loved going to Cora's. They have a great selection of breakfast foods. It ranges from eggs, crepes, French toast, pancakes, oatmeal, fresh fruit and etc. I have tried practically every dish they have at Cora's and each one is superb! Their dishes are always made fresh for you and the wait is never too long. It is never a disappointment!"}
{"text":"Not alway happy with the food at Cora's sometimes they get it wrong.. Some of the food items are abit dried out..and on one occasion I found a hair in my meal... My friends like to go to this place,but every time we go,there's always  Something wrong with the food and service.."}
{"text":"I used to love this place but it seemed in need of an update. My husband's food was cold and I found a hair in my crepe. Won't be back.  Food - 1 Craptastic Decor - 3 Mediocre Friendliness - 2 Bad"}
{"text":"The McDonalds of fast breakfast.   Nothing at all inspirational or interesting. If you don't like over-sweet pancakes or rubbery crepes, their basic breakfast options are bland and unexceptional.  Had a smoothie that was pure sugar. Friends had breakfasts that included pancakes. Had to ask for butter and syrup.   There are hundreds of breakfast/brunch places in the city, this chain is at the bottom of my list."}
{"text":"Cora's is terrific, a great place for breakfast.  Good food, good service."}
{"text":"Our server was obviously having a bad morning. She was dressed in all black which makes me assume she was management. Her name is Tracey and she made our overall experience there miserable. She was rude, snappy and overall just an unpleasant person. As a server, your role is to make customers feel welcome and comfortable and she did the exact opposite. For this reason, we will NOT be returning to this Coras."}
{"text":"In a nutshell: the food wasn't good and the service was weak.  I went here on my own on a Wednesday morning and sat for about 15 minutes before a waiter finally came to my table (no excuses because the place was less than half full and they were going back and forth from other tables).  I ordered the Cora's Special (two eggs, bacon, sausage, assorted fruit, crepe, potatoes). There was nothing special about it. The eggs were decent, the bacon strips were tiny, the sausage was not good, the fruit was not fresh and the crepe was OK.  With a glass of small OJ I paid $16. Definitely not worth the price.  There are better breakfast options in the area. I will not return and I suggest others don't bother."}
{"text":"I live really close to this popular brunch spot and have stopped by on a few occasions. On every visit, whether it's around 10am or 2pm, there is always a line up. The breakfast options are original with a lot of fruit options but I do question how fresh the fruit is (ie Pineapples and Strawberries when they're not in season). On my last visit I did have a horrific experience where my coffee cup wasn't very clean and didn't realize until I drank about half the cup. All in all, the breakfast is mediocre at best and there are A LOT of other options in and around the city that are far more original. My opinion, don't follow the crowd to this place!"}
{"text":"I stopped coming to this location due to poor service. You will see a line out the door not because they are busy but because the staff have no sense of urgency or organization. Tables are empty, but you'll see wait staff cleaning tables vs sitting guests, a lone bus person taking 5 minutes to slowly wipe down and set it up, hostess walking around aimlessly we think trying to help set tables. The amount and quality of fruit is significantly less too."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype behind Cora's. I came here a while back for brunch with my cousin. The line wasn't too long to get a table, which was a plus. But, once we were seated, I felt an immense pressure to order and eat at lightning speed. I totally get that they are a high volume restaurant, and they want to turn tables quickly. But, when people are walking past your table every two seconds, it gets a bit annoying. I also found their coffee was a bit sour. I worked at a coffee shop for 4 years, and can tell when coffee beans have started to expire. This is exactly what the coffee tasted like. I had a Raspberry Crepe with a side of bacon. The bacon reminded me of that microwaveable bacon, it was extremely thin and almost transparent. It was also incredibly greasy. The Raspberry Crepe was not bad. Raspberries were fresh, though the custard was slightly bland. The only reason I'm giving two stars is because despite the rushed service, the staff were quite friendly. Not somewhere I would rush back to."}
{"text":"A friend and I were planning to grab lunch and it was up to me where to go. I was in the mood for some Vietnamese food but thought that might be too heavy for lunch, then I remembered my brother always telling me about Cora's so I thought it would be worth checking out. Boy am I happy we chose to have lunch there!   For 11 am on a Monday, the place was quite packed, so I can't even imagine what it would be like on a weekend! The service was wonderful and friendly, and the food was fast. There was so much on that menu that looked delicious, and in the end I chose the Seventh of July which turned out to be an excellent choice!   Cora's isn't very visible for someone trying to find it for the first time. The parking seemed a little scarce as well, and that area in generally is fairly high traffic. But I am definitely waiting for my next visit there and can not wait to try some more of that wonder menu!"}
{"text":"Im a fan of cora's 'waffles', nice people and service"}
{"text":"Hands down one of our go-to breakfast places around the area.   Parking is adequate and the restaurant itself is neat and has very accommodating seating. Great for groups. The restaurant gives a \"home-y\" kind of atmosphere.   Service was prompt and the workers there are very polite and helpful. Coffee and water refills were on point.   Food is delicious! The portions per meal are pretty big and well worth their value. I usually go with the basic eggs, roasted potatoes and sausages (or bacon if you prefer) along with a serving of fruit and choice of bread. The Jo's Construction is another favorite with 3 eggs, 3 sausages, 3 pieces of bacon, roasted potatoes, fruit, and choice of bread. One of our favorites when we know we have a log day ahead. Everything was cooked just right to our liking and served within an appropriate wait time (about 10-15 minutes)  Cora's is and always has been a great choice for breakfast or brunch and it has easily become one of our default places to eat in this area."}
{"text":"two colleagues dragged me here for LUNCH. I ordered the beef melt sandwich and did not like it at all. the beef looked like pulled pork and was try. the side lettuce did not look fresh at all. the meal also came with a choice of either tomato juice or spinach soup (both of which did not sound appealing to me - no other choice was given). overall very disappointed. definitely won't go back here (not for lunch for sure)."}
{"text":"I love the breakfast here. Everyone complains about the line up but there is a reason there is a line.....because it's so good and people love it.  Highly recommend it but be prepared to wait for a table on the weekend. It will be worth it I promise."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????? ??????????????????????????????????  ???????????????????????????????????????????????????? ???????????????? ??????????"}
{"text":"A cozy nook located on the corner of the street that serves good breakfast food is a hit with me. I've tried three of their dishes:  - Eggs Ben et Dictine served on an English muffin covered with Hollandaise sauce. The eggs were cooked to my liking (the yoke was not cooked all the way through), the sauce was tasty, and the fruit served with the eggs was fresh. Suggested improvements: the potato wedges should be crispier, baking them with fresh herbs instead of pan frying would be a definite improvement in taste. Rating: 4 out of 5 stars.  - French toast served with a mountain of fresh fruit. It wasn't anything special, just average. Suggested improvements: the French bread could be cut a little differently, then soaked in milk and eggs with a hint of vanilla and  maple syrup a little longer, then pan friend quickly, and finally baked for a few minutes. Rating: 3 out of 5 stars.  - Crepe omelet stuffed with an omelette, severed with Hollandaise sauce, served with fresh fruit and toast. It was delicious! Rating: 5 out of 5 stars.  All in all, it is a good place that serves fresh food and offers many choices.  Parking tip: If you take a car, you can find free street parking a few blocks down. There is a parking lot right in front of the cafe, but they charge $20 for parking."}
{"text":"Have eaten here a a few times and frankly next time I'll drive the extra 20km's to go to another location. I've been to Cora's locations across Canada and always have the same high level of service and meal. I feel as though this location is below Cora's standard. Today we had breakfast there, when we finally got ur food it was cold and there was 3 parts of our meals missing. We ate what we had and sat for another 10 minutes before the waitress finally came back around, we had to inform her of the three things missing and also that both our waters and coffees were empty. Perhaps they should hire more staff and teach the existing staff to be a little more attentive. I'll be driving to the Okotoks location in the future and suggest everyone does the same."}
{"text":"I don't understand the hype. It is a good location, close to Scarborough town centre and the highway to meet up with friends. I have been here throughout the week (not so busy) and weekends (very busy) and it's about the same. Service is mediocre. Food is mediocre. Quality of the food is not great for the prices they charge."}
{"text":"A really great place with some amazing dishes.  I ordered the raspberry crepe an it was very good, but I did not like that it was ice cold.  That's by very crepe like to me.  The fruit, however, was fresh and abundant.  You can tell that it is a popular place because the line to get in for breakfast was very long.  I do think the prices could be a little lower for breakfast."}
{"text":"I have never got the fuss about Cora's.  I've been there a few times as it is close to work and we sometimes do a team breakfast before heading into work.    The portions are good, I have to say. The prices are very decent considering it's in the downtown core.  Apart from that, everything else is, well...meh.  The omelettes are bland and taste like processed plastic.  Fruits taste like...fruits.  The coffee is decent. Having a fruit platter is a decent option.  However, my idea of breakfast is a good Irish breakfast - eggs, sausages and bacon.  Unfortunately, Cora's is not the place to find that."}
{"text":"Boo! I'm disappointed to see such terrible reviews and low ratings for this location. Of all the locations I've been to in the GTA, this one is by far my favourite. A word of advice for anyone reading this review: If you look at all the past reviews, they are dated August 2011 or prior. We've been going there for the past year and have enjoyed it every single time. Perhaps they were having staffing issues in the past.  Boyfriend and I usually visit once a month, sometimes more often. I always get the Sunshine Panini made with bacon instead of ham, with a side of potatoes and a water. He always goes for Jo Construction with eggs made sunny-side up, whole wheat toast, a coffee and a water. We're regulars and I swear they know our orders before we sit down. The staff are so friendly and really bust their butts when it's busy.  I love that there is lots of parking at this location. Definitely not an easy find downtown. We usually go on the weekend. Sometimes it's lined up past the lobby, but the longest we've ever waited is 15 minutes max. And, for God's sake, if waiting isn't something you're down to endure, eat breakfast at home. Brunch restaurants are ALWAYS busy on the weekend.  Some people don't find the quality of the food worth the price, but we love it. It's way better than chancing some hole-in-the-wall we've never heard of (no disrespect intended). Plus, because we usually go for brunch, we're full for two meals. On the occasion that we're still hungry, we order a third meal for dessert (often Zack's Stacks or one of the dessert crepes). I'm also known to be picky, and not really a breakfast fan, but Cora's Sunshine Panini is within my top five favourite meals out. One time we ordered a seasonal menu item to split that was made up of french toast with custard and berries. Not being a fan of cinnamon and often detecting even a small amount of it in any dish, I was hesitant about whether or not I'd actually eat it. Our server told us she had ordered it every day for the past week, and promised us she would take it back if I didn't like it -- FREE OF CHARGE. Service doesn't get any better than that. But I ended up gobbling it up without a problem!  There has only been one mix-up in all our times going. It wasn't busy and the few tables around us, who came in after us, got their food first. I've worked as a server and bartender, so I understand that sometimes things happen. Our server said the kitchen didn't see our food chit. Either she was telling the truth, or she forgot to punch it in. Whatever. It happens. We weren't in a hurry to go anywhere, and our food came out shortly after that, delicious as always.   The only other minor flaw I can think of is that my potatoes came out overcooked one weekend morning. My guess is they cooked them as a big batch to save time, since it was busy. Again, whatever. It happens. I ate them and lived to write this review. Besides, if I'd complained, they would have brought me new ones.  The best part about this location is the loyalty stamp cards they give you (some locations don't do this). But you may need to ask for one. We'd been going there for awhile before the girl who took our payment one morning gave us one . How it works is, once you get 12 stamps, you get one meal free. The rule is one stamp per visit, but since there are two of us, they always give us two stamps. That means every 7th time we go there, we get one meal free. Not bad at all.  My boyfriend moved in with me last week so I'm not sure how often we'll be visiting \"our favourites,\" as he says, since the Dufferin and Steeles location is now closest. But if there are no stamps, and service isn't as grand, I won't mind driving out to the Queensway for some brunch now and then."}
{"text":"I frequent a different Cora's, but visited this one for a Sunday brunch before an afternoon Raptors game. I was a bit hesitant because I've had bad experiences at the Carlton Street location (check my profile for my 1-star review, if you're curious). But I left feeling full and upbeat!  This is, by far, Toronto's biggest Cora's. Which is great because the chain is a reputable weekend brunch hotspot and nobody likes standing in a long line when they're hungry (or hungover... or in a hurry... or anytime, really). We waited in line for all of two minutes before we were seated. Menus and server appeared almost instantly. We each order the same thing every time, so we ordered right away. Food came out fast, and my side of potatoes was cooked perfectly (the past few times I'd been to my usual location, I'd skipped them because they were overdone and bland).  One thing you should know, though, is that the quality of the coffee is below average. I've never ordered one myself, but my boyfriend does every time even though he recently admitted after a year of us going at least once a month that the coffee is terrible. But he orders one anyway, and drinks it all. So how bad could it really be? Or I guess he's just not as picky as some of us women can be. ;)  Recap: we were in and out quickly but didn't feel rushed, food was great, atmosphere was pleasant which was surprising based on how many people were in there, staff were great except for the fact that they don't take part in the loyalty stamp card practice, and we would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Service was good not great but my meal was Heaven on a plate. I had the festive special"}
{"text":"GENERAL NOTES A great place for breakfast or brunch. Maybe not as good at the Montreal locations but still very good. Vast menu with loads of options. Something for everyone. A trademark of Cora's is their fresh fruit, which comes in generous portions with most meals.   MENU RECOMMENDATIONS Eggs Benedict - unless you're a Florentine kind of person let's be honest, nothing can touch eggs benny...nothing. Cora's versions are great is somewhat limited for such a breakfast staple. The crepes are also very good and make sure you get some potatoes with onions. Amazing.  SERVICE NOTES Here's the thing about Cora's. It's packed. I've had more than one occasion where I showed up at 2pm hoping to get in before close (3pm) but the line was simply too long. However, if you can wait, I'd suggest it's worth it. Once you're in things move at a completely reasonable pace.   LOCATION NOTES Wellington and Blue Jay Way. Street parking and a large lot on Blue Jay Way.  HUMOUROUS STORY I managed to pick up a girl on the street who was selling something (not sex) and she was so sketched out by herself actually giving me her number that I took her here as a first date just to show her I was a normal guy. You know, no drinking, early in the day, totally harmless brunch date. Let me tell you something about these kinds of dates - don't go on them. You can't drink your way out of a bad situation or drink your way into a good one."}
{"text":"Great breakfasts here! Lots of combinations to choose from. Fast service. Big portions."}
{"text":"In lieu of pancakes and waffles, Cora offers omelettes, skillets and crepes, with lots of fruit and vegetables. The service was great (Melissa was an amusing and frequent visitor) and the price was appropriate. I can't think of any place I'd rather eat breakfast."}
{"text":"We have been going to this location for years. However the cleanliness and attitude of the wait staff has been deteriorating. The food is also more miss than hit - have had some tummy issues after visits. Muffins in eggs Benedict stale, rubbery eggs, coffee top ups given begrudgingly. Cutlery has been dirty on a regular basis. This used to be a treat for my family but kids don't want to go here anymore. I'd love to keep supporting my local Coras and mark more occasions here, but having been to another Coras downtown I know the extent of the quality difference."}
{"text":"Stopped by for breakfast/brunch this morning.  Probably showed up around 9:30am on a Wednesday.  It wasn't very crowded, but took a whiile for our party of 6 to be seated.  I thought they forgot about us for a while, but I guess they were just setting the table.  After we ordered, I swear, we had to wait over 30 minutes for our food to arrive.  That was definitely a bit excessive considering the hostess told us it was pretty slow.  There were tables that were seated after us and ordered after us that got their food before us.  Our server stopped by once and told us our food was being plated.  It took another 10 minutes for our food to come out after that.  As for the food, I ordered the Spinach & Cheddar Crepomelette.  It came with two slices of toast and a cup of fruit.  I really liked it.  I also tried the Crispy Crepes, which I think was banana and muesli.  I was not that crazy about it.  It came with yogurt and fruit.  Fruit was good, but I wasn't too crazy about the yogurt.  So to sum it up, food is okay and everything looks great on the plate, but our service was only so-so."}
{"text":"Convenient location and the breakfast comes with lots of food. But I found the food to be somewhat bland. Service was excellent. Overall good experience but do not expect high quality when you come. Good value."}
{"text":"Mixed review from me really. More times than not expect this place to be packed during weekends, and expect a 20-30 min wait sometimes even outside on the street. after more than a dozen visits (too many to count) it is evident they are understaffed during peak hours. Something they need to address because wait times increase and that just mean hungrier less happier customers who are willing to tip.  I personally will not be frequenting this coras as much anymore because the food has grown on me, and I dont find it enjoyable anymore, really rich in fats and greasy. Ive also had bad customer experience in my last 3 visits, in fact they insisted I dont pay for my meal last time I was there... they knew they dun goofed that time lol  But for first timers/novices I would def recommend for a brunch place, especially given their prices really decent for the amount of food they give you (big piles/stacks really).  50/50 it could go anyway"}
{"text":"Just got back from Cora's on the Queensway. Oh man, where do I begin? We ordered the Theos au gratin and the Harvest with french toasted brioche with crispy bacon. Service was slow and the waitress kept apologizing for how busy it was, despite the fact that there were three wait staff a manager and the unhappy looking cashier at the front. We ordered one coffee and a tea to come with breakfast. The server returned with two coffees and the man across from us (who'd been seated a while) had yet to get his coffee. Breakfast came with no tea and bacon barely cooked. My sister put the brioche aside on a napkin and had to get up to take the bacon to the server because who knows when we might get her back to our table. She asked for the bacon crispy. Within seconds the manager had crispy bacon on a small bread plate, which the server returned to our table. How exactly did she expect my sister to eat her brioche? The tea didn't arrive. We had to ask again. The brioche was dry. The bacon was cold (as if the manager just slipped some perviously overcooked bacon and shoved it on a plate). When my sister asked for butter for her brioche the server returned and said, \"I've never had someone ask for butter before.\" Really? Nobody has ever asked you for butter for french toasted brioche before? Perhaps evidence she's only worked at Cora's for two minutes, which is what it felt like. When my sister said the bacon was cold (after trying to get the girl's attention for five minutes) the server looked as though she wanted to retort, so my sister handed her the plate and said I am done. The server returned with a cheque and said, \"I've taken 50% off your breakfast.\" Seriously?? We told her to take it all off. Which she did and then returned with a takeout container for my sister's dried out fruit salad, likely a way to see if my sister would steal this part of her breakfast. UGH!  Suggestions:  The manager needs to leave the food facilitation stain (an easy job any teenager could do) and get out to the people standing in line for a table for 15 minutes when so many tables sit empty. Or he should be walking around ensuring that everyone is happy. Clearly not, given the girls in front of us did not leave tip and the gentleman behind us was also complaining.  Being busy is no excuse for being a terrible server. Forgetful and condescending.  Never again. And I am sending a letter to head office."}
{"text":"Oh I love Cora's so much the food is always so fresh and tasty I also love how they offer donations with some of there dishes! It's nice to see them helping the community , the menu is large but my only complaint is the amount of food is a lot so be caution of that cause I feel like it can be wasteful I wish they had a buffet style that way you could dish out how much you wanted. But other then that I would go again and again yummy food! And the pancakes are so fluffy they melt in your mouth!"}
{"text":"Been going here for about 5 years now! It is absolutely my fav! Don't let the line at the door on weekends trick you, the line goes by fairly fast, and it is totally worth the wait! The staff and manager are very nice all the time, i've been here over 100 times at least, and never yet had one complaint. The fruit is all FRESH not frozen, which makes such a difference. Yes it can be busy and loud at times, but that's because its an amazing place to be! I have ordered many different things from the menu and am never disappointed. My favourite would be the crepe's (especially raspberries for Lucy). coffee cup never goes empty, and food wait times are never long.  I recommend this breakfast place to everyone I know. =)"}
{"text":"I live block away from this spot, but, have been  in only a handful of times, the re is always a line up (mainly due to empty tables inside, which I have asked the person in charge of sitting people, why was that, I was been told they didn't have enough servers, what?!?!?), you get seated, flip through the extensive menu, that looks delicious (mostly because you have been standing for half an hour outside) place your order, and, realize that the food is just ok, if you have the waffles or pancakes, you are given corn syrup, or pay 50 cents for a small tin of real maple syrup, orange juice is $3.45+tax, and its probably tropicana, lots of fruit, but not fully ripe, most dishes are $11 or more.  overtime I go, I realize i don't like any of it, the wait, the service, the food, the prices, so, i am writing this to remind me next time that this place isn't worth it."}
{"text":"It took about 10 minutes to get in which wasn't bad, however they have a sign blocking half the entrance so people are pushing past each other to get in an out. I asked the waitress about drink options, before she gave me the menu, she rattled off the standard items - once I received the menu, I was disappointed to see there were many other options, fresh smoothies, fresh juices, and I wasn't told about them. After receiving my drink order, it took 25minutes for the waitress to come back to take my meal order even though she, and other waiters/waitresses, walked past me several times making eye contact, I ordered the Western Eggs in a Skillet, which came with toast and a small fresh fruit bowl. My order arrived wrong, but at this point I had waited to so long I just accepted it (I ordered my eggs scrambled, they came fried) I could barely stomach it, however I think it was just the dish and doesn't speak for the rest of the menu, however I am sad to say the best part of my whole meal was the buttered toast. The decor was cute; they have unique names for all their dishes, some with stories behind them so it was fun to read that. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this establishment mostly due to the terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Go early on the weekends and holidays so avoid line-ups.   if you are vegan: they have oatmeal, fruit, and toast. it's a decent meal. Free coffee re-fills from what i remember.   non-vegans that i know love this place to cure hang overs. lots of greasy breakfast foods."}
{"text":"I grew up in Montreal (came to Calgary 9 years ago), and just like me ... Cora is from La Belle Province.  Back there it's called Chez Cora, but just because it dropped its French, doesn't mean it's any less wonderful.  I love it just as much at its new locations here as I loved it back there.    My favourite item on the menu: crepes.  They are the super-thin pancakes stuffed with just about anything you can hope for -- fruit and whipped cream, or cheese and ham.  Cora knows how to do them right -- this is the only place, in my opinion, to get Crepes west of Montreal.  They also have standard egg n' bacon plates, fruit n' toast, or plain oatmeal -- no matter what kind of morning eater you are, they have you covered.  Inside, the restaurant is cheerfully decorated, and cozy.  Lots of chickens and kitschy kinds of items strewn about; chairs and cushionly benches packed a little tight together.  Only problem is: the food is so scrumptious, that the lines to get a seat are RIDICULOUS.  Seriously ... I think Calgary has a major breakfast-joint shortage, because all the best places, Cora included, are always packed and lined up.  If you're going to come: come early ... before 9:30am.  Any later, and you'll be waiting."}
{"text":"Cora's was a staple of spare mornings when I was in school in Quebec. My friends and I would come, caffeinate, and de-stress. Back then there were just a few locations of the breakfast place that had originated in Montreal. Since then, Cora's has exploded to span the country. I'm a fan of local community businesses over chains and Cora's has definitely gone over to the other side of the tracks.   Don't get me wrong, I'm still a fan; Cora's is still Canadian and delicious, but it was so standardised when we were there Wednesday morning for my Dad's family birthday breakfast, and attention to detail seems to have fallen by the wayside. Dish presentation suffered a tad, which is sad because Cora's is one of the few places where it always looked like a food stylist had worked on your plate! Especially the famed fruit mountains. Perhaps it was just this location that was not at the top of its game. The breakfasts we ordered may have looked like a jumble, but it wasn't a huge deal. All the components were there and my Eggs Ben et Dictine (with spinach, caramelized onions, and cheddar), fruit mountain, and potatoes were very tasty. My first eggs benedict actually. The coffee was still bottomless, the staff were very accommodating, putting up with my Dad's bad jokes, coming out and singing a birthday song, with an apple swan. Overall, a good healthy breakfast for the price.  Apparently if you go to their website and register for the newsletter you get a free breakfast on your birthday, but there's a page you have to print and they don't accept it from smartphones. The server also told us about the loyalty card, 12 punches and the 13th breakfast is free. That's a lot of rollin' with the punches for a free meal. Ugh, my Dad's rubbing off on me.  The bonus for this location is that there is a Lindt chocolate outlet in the same lot so you can hop across and take advantage of the deals! Mm discount chocolate."}
{"text":"Stopped in for brunch with my partner. The food was good but our server seemed very indifferent. Waited a long time for coffee top-up. We weren't really ever checked on and it certainly wasn't warm service for sure. Food was exactly what you expect from Cora - pretty decent. I wouldn't necessarily go back to this location."}
{"text":"Does every Cora's smell the same?  Everyone I've been to from Montreal to Mississauga to Pickering to Downtown have the same smell.    They need more ventilation as the grease smell is overwhelming once you notice it.  Food is standard breakfast fare.  Menu is overwhelming. If you want a basic breakfast, the Cora's special is the one to get.   Beware if you go with a large group they are very slow."}
{"text":"I've been to this Cora location like 10 times, and it's consistently great!  I loooove their waffles with strawberries, their bacon passe-partout sandwich (the wrap is made of crepe!), and when I want something more basic and every day, the Cora special is always a good choice.   The staff is all super friendly too; every single waitress is awesome, and the owner comes around from time to time & seems to know every guest in the restaurant! Super nice. Feels like a local, small-town restaurant. Love it.   Not sure what to order? My favourite by far is the waffles, however you like them. You get one big huge waffle that's perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.... Completely covered in fruit. Can't be better than that!   Bottomless coffee and free wifi makes this place even better :)"}
{"text":"Long wait. Inattentive waiter. Didn't see him once after he took our order. Had to get service from every other server than our own. Okay food - a bit heavy handed on the salt, although eggs were cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"My husband, 7 month old and I had breakfast here yesterday, January 31st. I ordered the sunrise panini with bacon. When we received our meal, my first bite into the panini the egg was cold and cheese was not melted. I sent back my other half to get cooked more. When I got home about 2 hours later, I was violently ill. It was the worse feeling. I hadn't eaten/drank anything else. I for sure got food poisoning that lasted from noon-1am. I will NEVER eat at Coras EVER again!!!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin? Do I even have to give 1 star to this wretched place? The hostess, Leanne and server, Arathana were a nightmare. The attitudes! We came at 2pm and left at 2:38pm, it was such a mess.  It was obvious they were trying to close down early even though they are supposed to close at 3pm. It was such an inconvenience for Arathana  to come to our table to give us our food. She never came to give us coffee refills, there was no table syrup at our table, she wouldn't give us sweetener or anything for the coffee, she barely came to our table, she's just drop things and run -- she was too busy badmouthing customers with the hostess, Leanne and we had to constantly get up and get what we needed while overhearing them.  I made sure I got their names so I could complain to head office because this is the second time we've had such a notably horrible experience with Cora (oh yes, the kitchen forgot ingredients in the pancake dish one of us ordered -- you'd think something like cream cheese in a dish containing cream cheese would be important to the kitchen but apparently product quality doesn't matter either to this franchise).  I realized after the horrible experiences we had both here and at the one in Richmond Hill (the managers there are horrendous and the crepes are just thin nachos, they're so dry), it's very clear that they live off the crowds on the weekend and don't care about what happens at their slower points.   At this price point, you would expect a certain level of quality of service and food that they used to have but this disappointing decline is very evident. I'm tired of going to restauarents like this that slide overtime and decide it doesn't matter. You contact them and they lie by saying they'll do something about it but they never do. Keep your crappy employees and your inadequate food, Cora -- I miss what you used to be and, like every other franchise that catches it too late, you're just on a gradual decline that will get caught too late. Definitely won't be the first or last time it's happened."}
{"text":"Extremely good food. Only slight ding is the length of time to get it. But food was worth the wait. No wonder there's a line every morning."}
{"text":"Came for a late breakfast Sunday morning, and as we expected, they were quite busy.  The initial wait of 15 minutes to be seated was completely reasonable as far as I'm concerned, and our waitress was good, but unfortunately, that's all I can really compliment on this visit...  Being my first time eating here, I figured that I would order their equivalent of a meal I have had elsewhere, partly because it appealed to me, and partly as a comparison point to another restaurant I like, so I ordered the strawberry crepe with custard.  This is where it goes downhill..  To start, it took more than 20 minutes for the food to arrive.  Busy I understand, but most of these breakfast items can be cooked in just a couple of minutes.  How small is the grill?  However, my disappointment only grew when the food arrived.  First impression was that both my wife's order, and my own looked delicious.  Upon closer inspection though, I realized the following: a.  My wife's toast was burnt. b.  The strawberry in my wife's fruit was kind of sad looking. c.  The strawberries in the crepe were not what I would consider acceptable.  Many had big green or scarred parts on them that I would have cut off personally, or were simply too ripe (as in soft or mushy) and should never have been used in the first place. d. The custard was very thin, and kind of bland.  To be fair, my wife's omelet was good, and the meats were fine, so there was that.  I guess my biggest issue is that the attention to detail, and quality of the ingredients being used just didn't seem to be there. While my wife has eaten here three times now, and still likes their food, I probably won't be going back.  It just wasn't good enough in my opinion."}
{"text":"Never again. Stood in line a ridiculous amount of time even by Cora standards. Finally after the groups of 2 and 4 being seated, I was up. I asked if it was ok if I sat on the patio as it was open and it was nice out. Got a \"Yeah I guess so\" from a less than enthusiastic hostess. Got seated got my menu and waited for my server to come by to grab my drink order.  And I waited. And waited. 10 minutes elapsed. The other patrons on the patio got served their drinks and had their orders taken and I sat. Parched.  Hungry. And on the verge of losing my sh!t. Finally I ducked my head inside and motioned for a server. I caught someone's eye and she came out. \"Oh. You need your bill. Let me get your server!\" And she left. She left and no one came back. I went inside and went up to the till, and the lady there goes, \"How was everything? Do you have your bill?\" I politely informed her that I didn't have a bill because I'd basically been ignored and hadn't even gotten my order taken. She looked at me and didn't even bother to apologize and when I asked for a manager she told me the manager was unavailable to deal with anything at that moment. Yet I could clearly see the manager chatting to a server across the room. Never ever again"}
{"text":"Un cora comme les autres ! Même menu qu'ailleurs.   Cora c'est un OK pour moi. C'est bon, mais sans plus, les fruits sont trop souvent trop fermes et sans saveur. Je préfère les endroits moins ' chaîne ' mais il faut dire qu'a l'ile des soeurs, il n'y a pas grand chose d'autre pour déjeuner, alors voila ! Ca fait du bien au bedon les jours de grasse matinée !  Cocktail de fruits & panini-crêpe = meilleure option."}
{"text":"Let's just skip to the part you have all been waiting for: the food. If you are looking for delicious, filling and well-presented breakfast and brunches, Cora's is the place to be. They have all sorts of meals to offer, such as classic dishes with some extra twists. You will have the choice of delicious waffles, crepes, amazing french toast and more!   If you are more of a healthy person like I try to be, they serve fresh fruit salads with granola and Greek yogurt or a delicious spinach omelet. Their coffee isn't the best but hey, I'm not complaining that early in the morning.   I really and highly recommend you guys to try this place out. You might want to come a bit early as it gets packed really fast and you will often see a waiting line outside the restaurant (on weekends). You will be more than satisfied - the plates are fairly big, the food is amazing and you will leave this restaurant with a full belly."}
{"text":"Had French toast with sausage and fruit. It was a bit of an odd order for them, but they accommodated me. Very good. Sat on the patio, which has a view of a parking lot, but is outside I the fresh air."}
{"text":"Crazy line on a weekend morning. Food is pretty great in terms of portion sizes. It seems generic too me but still taste good."}
{"text":"The food was really good, but the service was beyond slow.  We waited 15 min for someone to take our order, food came out fast, but we had to wait another 15 min to get our bill after we asked for it."}
{"text":"What a delicious breakfast.  Ordered a panini-crepe....yum!  Gotta mention the abundant fresh, fruit on the side fabulously presented!  Highly recommend!  If going on a weekend, must make reservations, otherwise during the week, not so bad.  Waitstaff was wonderful and attentive.  Willing to go back again and again to try the various breakfast items!"}
{"text":"Great for breakfast or lunch. The menu is varied & the prices are reasonable. On weekends they get busy so try & get there earlier if possible"}
{"text":"Before hopping on the road, we had breakfast at Cora's since it was only right across the road from where we were staying. I was slightly hesitant after reading some of the previous reviews, but it turned out to be just fine. The table seating was a little tight with the chairs back-to-back. We asked to be seated at a booth but were told those were reserved for large groups (there were 3 of us). Completely understandable. Our waitress was pretty helpful. She offered getting cheese on our roasted potatoes which proved to be a great choice. I don't know if we were just hungry, but our food did seem to take awhile to come. To their credit, it was rather busy so that's understandable as well.   I ordered the Spinach & Cheddar Omelette; it came with rye toast, a bed of fruit, and roasted potatoes. I also ordered a side of bacon. I finished off the potatoes before really touching anything else on my plate; they were so tasty! And the cheese just enhanced everything! The fruit looked good--it was cantaloupe, pineapple and an orange. I only ate the orange though. The main attraction: the Omelette was a little dry. I could see that as soon she put my plate down. However it got better once I moved towards the inside.   Overall, it was a great experience. I'll definitely recommend this place to others who visit Toronto or just return myself. It was a breakfast and wait well worth it!"}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT AT THIS LOCATION!!!  I will never come back to this location, and I STRONGLY suggest you do not either. There is The Grille on the north side of Queensway a little further west, go there instead, they are very friendly, cheap and have HUGE portions.   I came here for a birthday breakfast, the food took twenty minutes for it arrive to our table while our coffee cups went dry and we went unattended. Once the cups were filled again, the food did arrive the server spilled a full cup HOT COFFEE onto my father's LAP.  The poor girl (obviously new) was left to clean up the mess herself. Mistakes happen, but NO ONE in management came to check on us to either APOLOGIZE or to CHECK IF HE HAD BEEN BURNT.  Upon receiving the check there was not a single gratis item given in apology, in fact THEY CHARGED US FOR THE COFFEE THEY SPILLED ALL OVER HIM. I was not looking for a full free meal for everyone at the table, but at the very least, offer something to the customer who's day you ruined by drenching his clothes. This meant we could not go to a movie after this as we had planned, as he would have to return home to change.  When we asked to speak to the manager she was extremely dismissive and offered nothing but \"bring in your cleaning bill.\" Really, that's the most useless offer at compensation I've ever heard, the man was wearing shorts and t-shirt, it wasn't going to the dry-cleaners. She then said \"What do you want me to do\" and my father asked to not pay for the coffee that was spilled on him. She gave the coffee gratis and offered the weakest apology I've ever heard \"I apologize, again.\" SHE DID NOT APOLOGIZE PREVIOUSLY."}
{"text":"I've never been a big fan of Coras breakfast joints, because whichever location I go to, the food is always mediocre for the price you may. With expensive items, one always expects it to taste like it's worth it. But at Coras, an omelette with fries and some fruit is nothing great, just really average to me. I find I could probably make myself better breakfasts at home (but I don't because I'm lazy, and who has time to make themselves breakfast so early in the morning, anyways?) Their portions are also not as filling or large enough, compared to Panagios or Golden Griddle. Service at Coras is usually pretty good. The servers try their best, which I appreciate."}
{"text":"Good service and food was delightful. Our waitress was very fast and we were not disappointed at all with our food, though I wish my poached egg was a little bit bigger."}
{"text":"Went to Coras on the Queensday this morning for my \"Anniversary breakfast\" with my hubby. We have never been to this Coras previously, I've heard good things about it so decided to give it a try, since it seemed nicer than your average greasy spoon.  The restaurant itself is large and bright.  The waitress was a \"low talker\" and seemed very shy and introverted.  Our breakfast came fairly quickly, it didn't look quite as good as the pictures in the menu but we were hungry and chowed down.    It wasn't a horrible breakfast nor was it near the best I've ever had either.  The bacon was INCREDIBLY thin and paper like, I really didn't like that part at all.  The rest of the meal was good, the potatoes were tasty.  The cutlery that they used was the cheapest I have ever seen, think a step down from a dollar store type.  The waitress did not come back and ask if everything was ok or to refill our coffees until we were done our meal.  The portions are a large size so we didn't leave hungry, but we weren't \"satisfied\"  Overall it was just \"meh\"...... probably won't be back for a $35 breakfast (for two), when I can get one for half that right across the street......"}
{"text":"Way too slow of service. Even after being told they are \"always this busy\" if you can't handle the volume, then you need more staff.  30 minutes now wait for 2 eggs. No coffee refill. No coming back to check. No wait staff at all around for anything.  Patience and tip level dwindles..."}
{"text":"This Cora's was darn near identical to every other Cora's I've been to: absolutely packed on a Sunday morning.  The wait time was reasonable, at fifteen minutes and the food delivery time was also reasonable. We had a very friendly server, however our coffee cups made it to empty pretty darn quickly and then stayed there, bottomed out, for awhile.   The calibre of the coffee, for a place that does breakfast, is pretty lacklustre.  I mean, surely there is a wealth of knowledge available from the myriad of coffee roasters and coffee shops in the Northern Hemisphere... plus, you know, the Southern Hemisphere, where they grow the stuff.  Now we're up to a globe's worth of available knowledge. I can understand the trade-off between durable, small catering coffee mugs not being shattered and only holding so much coffee, so as not to waste any, but coffee is pretty darn cheap.  Coffee was something like $2.75 a cup and you've got to figure that most of that pricing is to recover costs from labour, not from the coffee, creamer or sugar.  It may work to trick your wait staff into being attentive, except when that backfires, as it did in this case, and your clientele doesn't like it when someone interrupts the caffeine IV supply. My suggestions: more staff, larger coffee mugs, or beverage-patrollers for the super-busy shifts, whose only responsibility is to produce and serve more beverages."}
{"text":"My first experience of a \"Cora's\" was in Montreal, where it is known as \"Chez Cora\". Based on the fresh and hot breakfast served there, in a bustling and cheery space, I was enthused and yet skeptical when I saw Cora's appearing all over the GTA.   Thus, my review is biased because it's reminiscent of the potential the could been and yonder years of greatness of Chez Cora vs. Cora's Breakfast & Lunch.  Fresh =/= Good Sorry to all the folks that love the fruit at Cora's. I was less than impressed with the tell-tale signs and lack of smells from the fruit salad from a bucket, adorned with un-ripe,  and thus, tasteless melon, sour grapes (literally), strawberries with white insides, mouth-puckering and hard starfruit. I like when my fruit exudes smell... of fruit, that is.   Fresh fruit is hard to come by in these parts, at this time of year, yah? Yes. I would love to see some preserves or something reasonable in Canada for this time of year. Further, Canadian fruit from the summer, stewed, jammed, made into a syrup or coullis, frozen, baked, or whatever, would be good too.  On the same level, I prefer the GG. GG = plain and simple breakfast, no bragging. Cora's crowds seem to want to rave about things that just irritate me to the point of \"are you serious?\" and gloat about \"the waiting, to finally get in\" bit. i'm not saying one is inherently better than the other, but one attracts certain diners from marketing.  kinda like posh gyms or clubs vs. the Y or jamming when no one's watching... (ha. i couldn't help it)  Cora's just didn't do it for me."}
{"text":"When this location first opened I could echo the other reviewers emphatically. Now? Not so much. Their hallmarks of quality in food and service feel diminished. Sure, they can serve a good meal and I've seen some good staff... But it's really inconsistent, and I find my self hesitant to go back. Disappointing, since it use to be over-the-top awesome, every time."}
{"text":"Cora's reminded me of a crossbreed between Marie Calendars and Denny's.  Hahaha... no seriously!  The healthier version!!  I did like the green theme happening throughout the restaurant, in fact, I wish I had taken a photo of their menu because they had a huge selection of fruits.  Some were ginormous.  The menu had so much fruit that it got stuck in my head all day, and all I could think off were the legendary Abbot & Costello with Carmen Miranda, the classic film \"The Streets of Paris\" (I'm a big black and white movie fan).    Food here was good though! I'd say better than most and probably, a bit healthier than Denny's and Marie Calendar in the states combined.  They also had great selections for vegan too. My overhard eggs and bacon was fantastic, and I even got a side of fruit all included for I think under $10 USD.  If you're ever in downtown Toronto, check Cora's out.  She is the \"DenMar\" (Denny's & Marie Calendar) of Canada.  Until then, be kind to one another and Cheers! ~ :p"}
{"text":"Where do I start??? Service was brutal extremely unorganized. Order a skillet (think that what it is called) greasy ham over cooked eggs under toasted toast with a huge slab of butter ONLY in the middle, mushrooms look like they came out of a can drained and sat of the shelf for a week, far to much rosemary on the potatoes  Fruit was not ripe.....grapes were delish WOULD NOT RECOMMEND WOULD NOT GO BACK!"}
{"text":"Really good breakfast. Lots of food.  Very nice waitress. Bright fun restaurant. Loved the s'more pancakes."}
{"text":"Upon arrival to the restaurant, it's important to note the happiness inducing yellow walls that contain the place. The staff are kind and bright as the environment they work in. Atmospherically, a great place for a friendly breakfast.  Food is served in great portions, and fruit comes with every dish. No matter what you choose to eat, I promise the portions will satisfy."}
{"text":"I'm from Florida visiting Canada and went to this place first wasn't to sure if it would be good or not due to the reviews it had walked in had no problem with the waiting was seated right away servers greeted me well the place looked clean and the vibe of the room was good got my food in good time server checked on me regularly honestly my first experience wasn't so bad fruit was fresh  food tasted good try this place out don't let the reviews kill the experience for you!"}
{"text":"Cora is a nice spot for brunch, with nice bright lighting and friendly atmosphere. However, the food isn't really special and the service is moderate as well. We came in on a Sunday, which tends to be packed. They seemed to be quite understaffed and took a while to clear tables and bring people in. We sat down to order and it took a while to flag down someone again after they brought us water. The food also took quite a while to come out. After about 30 mins, our food arrived. I got the \"1990's Harvest\" and the raisin bread was lukewarm and a bit soggy. It still tasted fine with the fruit and bacon, but I was a little disappointed. Overall, it may have been the day we went that affected the service. The food honestly wasn't very special and quite pricey for what it was. I probably won't return for breakfast or brunch, but maybe I'll come back to try their lunch."}
{"text":"Really long wait times both times I've been. Better to try Ritual next time to see if it speeds things!"}
{"text":"Usually I'm not into Chez Cora because I find their portion sizes underwhelming and their food a little lacking but my breakfast at this location was great! Maybe it's because there were very few customers and it was a weird time to be eating breakfast, but I was impressed. I had the Avril 89 crepe and my boyfriend had the Cora Special. The service was fast and friendly, the fruit was fresh and we walked out happy!"}
{"text":"Service was great, staff was incredibly nice, and the restaurant had a comfortable, friendly ambience. The 3 stars are just because my food was a tad bit average.   I had the Cora's special and I wasn't too much of a fan of the potatoes and the crepe with ham in my meal. I'm usually not that picky but I guess it was too much salt for me to handle. Plus I probably could've enjoyed it more if I wasn't too busy envying my friend and her strawberry waffle in front of me. It looked awesome!!   All of their food is very appealing, which is of course a great plus to any place. I'd definitely come back again but will be sure to avoid the salty stuff."}
{"text":"Good place to stop for a quick morning bite. It is a franchise and everything seemed up to standard at this location. A little too busy in the morning but it is their peak time so be ready for a line-up!"}
{"text":"absolute garbage. yelp wants me to add more than this so I will say that all of the food was garbage, the potatoes were garbage, the breads were garbage, the pancakes were garbage. absolute garbage"}
{"text":"I've read all of my friends' glowing reviews of this place, and, seriously, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills. Bland bland bland. Just because it is all smothered in melted cheese and butter, I feel like you've all boarded the Cult of Cora train singing, \"Nananananana Cora!\" There is always a reason a restaurant will smother their food with creamy fat: to mask a lack of depth and flavor. I say this with L-O-V-E. Cora's is not worth the 20 minute wait to get in.  Is it the worst place for breakfast? Hardly. But it is underwhelming. Looking at the menu, I was already bracing myself for mediocrity when I saw that the only vegan option on Cora's are their fruit plate options. Their lunch menu has no vegetable sandwiches, which I found strange, since their menu and website seem to really want to hammer in how fresh everything is here. I got the Samira Platter minus the cheese, and it came to the table looking like a sad, day-old Edible Arrangement that had been sitting in the back of a van. Everyone else remarked that their food was bland, the fruits mushy and sour, and you know what else was sour? The coffee.   I probably would've rated this place a 3 if my expectations hadn't been set higher. The rave reviews and the packed restaurant had me expecting some cozy Grandma food, but instead I felt like I paid for a bunch of overpriced fruit. And while some may chalk up the bland experience to the fact that 90% of the menu is out of my reach, have a look at my veg-friendly list for Calgary. Not a single one of those places is vegan specific. There are no vegan specific places in Calgary. In fact, some of those places are downright meatoriums. But they at least do their vegetable offerings well, and I find that a place that has that right can get the rest of it right. Sad, pseudo-Edible Arrangement doesn't qualify."}
{"text":"There are so many more breakfast joints than this place.  The food is as you expect on the menu and mostly satisfactory.  On a busy Saturday don't expect it to be warm.  Don't ask for any customizations to your meal, they will screw it up guaranteed.  Service is inconsistent and staff seem overwhelmed.   I have to wave down someone to fill my coffee, get extra napkins, even refill water and to get my bill.  If you want knowledgeable friendly staff then don't come here.  They don't think outside the box or offer anything extra, they don't have any common sense to ask if you want a to go box even.  I much prefer a friendly intuitive personal server than a waiter or waitress with no personality that is just counting down their hours till their shift is over."}
{"text":"Really enjoy this place - most plates on the menu are packed to the brim with an overload of fruit in addition to the generous mains. It's on the more pricy side for breakfast, though you definitely get what you paid for. On the most recent visit, I had the panini wrap with a filling of egg, cheese and bacon. I ended up taking half of the hefty portion home for a late afternoon snack.  The queue on the weekends tend to be long, but if you are willing to go around one pm, it moves fairly quickly. Plenty of parking in this random plaza just off of the 401."}
{"text":"After reading the already existing reviews, I must say that I was quite surprised. The consensus was that this place was not worthy of one's breakfast/brunch dollar. I have dined at this location on a number of occasions. In my opinion, the quality of the experience is closer to a 3 out of 5 rather than a 2 out of 5 star experience. The following are the reasons which justify a 3 out of 5 rating: 1. Wide breakfast menu selection. You can have anything from waffles to pancakes to crepes to eggs. 2. I have tried many different items on the menu (crepes, french toast, fresh fruit, omelets) and have yet to consume anything that was not delicious. 3. The majority of items on the menu are less than $10.  The following are the reasons why Cora's is not worthy of a 4 out of 5: 1. One of my pet peeves is leaving a restaurant and smelling the grease from the restaurant on my clothing. I think this has something to do with the restaurant's design and its open concept kitchen. As a result, I would recommend against wearing your Sunday best. Through experience, I tend to wear casual clothing that I can quickly throw into the wash upon returning home. 2. As a result of the popularity of the location, the restaurant owners have decided to pack in as many people as possible. Thus, there are some tables that are situated way too closely together. This makes for some awkward entering and exiting situations where you are trying to not accidentally knock over a neighboring table's drink with your jacket. 3. As a result of their popularity, long lines from 10am to noon are to be expected. The fact that they do not accept reservations is a sticking point with me. There have been a few occasions where I elected not to go to Cora's because I did not want to wait in line for a half hour."}
{"text":"I love this place! I like the ambience and how the place was decorated. The servers were very nice!   The only downside is that you have to wait for 5-15 mins as there is a long line-up everytime, 10-15 mins as well before they serve the food.  They are giving coffee refills btw!   They have a variety of menus, which is kinda overwhelming at first, but I think it's a good thing too as you can have many choices.   I tried their Forestière for today. According to their menu, it is a: \"Crêpe made of buckwheat and sorghum flour filled with mushrooms and Brie cheese.\" I didn't notice that it can be served in a smaller serving though. I wouldn't recommend this meal if you're looking for something more fancier or something more \"tasty\". I tried eating it with maple syrup but it was too sweet. I tried eating it with ketchup too, but it tasted weird.   I tried their raspberry smoothie too and it was wonderful. It wasn't too sweet and too plain, you can definitely taste freshness of the fruit   I paid around $50 for 3 people, and I think it's worth it. *but not worth it if you will go here everyday of course*g"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised by this place. I know the chain from my years spent in Montreal and like it, but never really considered it an exciting option. I wouldn't think I would be visiting the chain in Toronto or even more, taking the time to write a review on it. However, I did end up meeting my granny here a little while ago due to location and time restrictions and we had a great brunch! I forgot how well-priced it is for all the fresh fruit you get and for the size of the dishes. Good value. I particularly enjoyed their spinach and cheddar crepes (the crepes are made of a blend of regular, whole wheat and buckwheat flour). Anyone who finds themselves in touristy Toronto land looking for a casual brunch would be satisfied."}
{"text":"Too pricy for the taste. The general idea is great but lack of signature food items. Tried 3 different dishes so far and none of them were dazzling. But spent over 40$ after tax (2 people) each visit. That's really on the pricy side for a breakfast place, especially when there's nothing that dazzles."}
{"text":"Enormous breakfast options excellent bacon and lots of really good fruit."}
{"text":"When the place is busy, the service is slow and forgetful. They're also rushed to clean down the tables. I hate coming to a table that's just been wiped down and it's still wet. The fruit has gone down in quality at times but it really is hit and miss. I wouldn't say the food is horrible but the wait staff could be better.  This is one of the less busier Cora's but it has picked up since. Pretty much the same as all the other Cora's in the GTA and there are definitely better bunch places I would go to. I still come back for the mushroom and brie eggs benedict and the coffee."}
{"text":"Awesome menu, there's something for everyone. I really like how theres a whole page on the menu dedicated to fruit and more healthier options. There's also a teen and kid menu. My boyfriend had the western omelette which he enjoyed, and I had the fruit platter which was set up beautifully.   Our server was very friendly and came back a few times to see if everything was good, no need to flag anyone down.   One thing to note is that on weekends, the line is crazy long. There's no waiting area inside, so you'll have to line up on the sidewalk outside the restaurant.  They also should call out names that were taken down instead of coming out and saying \"I have a table for two available.\" That caused some confusion amongst the customers."}
{"text":"Large portions, good service and pretty good food for a reasonable price.  I've been there a few times and the only thing I didn't like is the custard!"}
{"text":"The food is OK, very industrial like even though  it seemed fresh. Its a busy place, ambiance is loud, you need to battle to get attention from your server. Otherwise an alright place for breakfast."}
{"text":"I guess i just don't get what all the fuss is about.   For our last Toronto meal, we had our hearts set on Crepes-a-go-go, but sadly they didn't open until 10:30. Since we had to leave for the airport at 11, we were going to have to find our crepes elsewhere. We asked our hotel concierge to point us toward a good brunch spot and he recommended Cora.   First of all, it is my own personal problem that picture menus drive me crazy. I do not blame Cora for my own inability to read pictures. But the crazy fonts and all the colors and pictures... Wow. It's like instant ADD. I managed to order a Nutella and banana crepe while mom ordered something with French toast, eggs, and lots of fruit. Second of all, here's the thing about this \"lots of fruit\" schtick: it's all melon. I hate melon. Would it kill Cora to throw in some grapes, maybe even some berries?  Anyway, all the food we ordered was extremely unmemorable. Neither of our breakfasts justified the huge lineup of hungry diners outside when we left; the service was OK but the food was just so-so. Maybe it's just a Canadian thing that I just don't understand, but I'll find somewhere else for my crepe fix next time."}
{"text":"I went here this morning for brunch.  There was a bit of a line but the food was good and the service was great.  I had one of the egg skillets and a fresh-squeezed orange juice.  The food was served in a decent amount of time.  I'd recommend this place for a nice brunch day with friends!"}
{"text":"This Cora's is located in a strip mall on the southside of the Queensway east of Atomic Ave and just west of the Ikea.  The storefront is a bit hidden in this mall because it faces away from the street.  From what used to be a mall with more presence, the Future Shop closed quite a while ago and nothing has taken its place yet so this part of the strip mall is a bit of a secret so to speak.  Cora's used to be more special back in the day when there were fewer of them outside of Quebec.  I've been to a Chez Cora in of all places Leduc, Alberta and also been to one in the west Island (Montreal) where Cora's began (Quebec).    One thing I couldn't help but notice is that the Gargantuan on the menu no longer had cretons.  It's ok because I'm really not supposed to eat it but I didn't end up ordering it anyway.  I just went with the good old Joe Construction which is basically a standard breakfast (bacon, eggs, potatoes) while my wife ordered a crepe.  Years ago Cora's or Chez Cora (same thing) was sort of special because while everybody else was just serving up normal breakfast standards, Cora's had fresh fruit sides and other things like skillets, omelets, crepes and other breakfast dishes which weren't the norm.  These days these dishes are more common so in a way, Cora's blazed a trail but these days they just seem a bit mundane.  Overall the service is good, the places are always clean and the dishes are presentable.  The food is pretty much standard across the many Cora's I've been to and nothing really stands out.    Still, as a staple place they have fair prices and they're decently consistent.  For the most part I'd have to say they're not a standout place by any means but just a reliable blue chip."}
{"text":"This Cora is located in the strip mall at the south east corner of Boul Saint-Charles and Boul Hymus in Kirkland just south of the 40 (West Island).  I knew them as Cora's and in Quebec and even in Leduc, AB they were Chez Cora (Cora's en Francais) and now it's just called Cora...?  Either way they were always a good standard place for breakfast.  Their menu has changed a bit that is there's some new things but for the most part all the old staples are all there.  My go to back in the day has been the gargantuan since it's one of the larger breakfast platters but this time I ended up getting the Construction Joe which had 3 of each bacon and sausage.  I felt like having more meat today and wasn't in the mood for cretons (a pate like spread).  My wife wanted a bowl of oatmeal but also wanted more so she ended up ordering the brunch burger as well.  It's a burger with bacon and a cheese omelette on top.  Not bad I have to say.    This breakfast was filling but I don't know if Cora/Cora's/Chez Cora had more appeal back in the day or what.  I know they are much more commonly found than back when they were only in Quebec but they're still popular it seems.    Today the food is still good but not necessarily special.  I'd still go to Cora as an option for a decent sit down breakfast."}
{"text":"We were on our wait out of Toronto and instead of eating junk on the road or paying $20 for the hotel breakfast we walked over to Cora's which was a nice surprise. It was pretty busy and there was a line to get in the place, but they move the tables really well for brunch so I'd say we didn't wait much more than 5 minutes. For a chain restaurant, the decor was really neat and felt pretty local and the food was fantastic. Not to mention fresh and health compared to other breakfast places. Wish we had one back in the states!"}
{"text":"Today we're at Cora's! I've been to this location a couple of times with my friends because it's conveniently close by to Scarborough Town Centre and we would just head there afterwards.  We arrived pretty early and there was ample seating space. This Cora's is actually pretty big compared to some of the other breakfast places. If you come on the weekend, however, there would be a line outside the door for this Cora's - just a little warning.  Our bread came last among all the dishes. I was confused for a second because I was wondering if our meals even came with bread! LOL. Clearly I haven't woken up from my slumber...  Our meals did not take long to come, but it felt longer because I was hungry.  L got the basic eggs with sausage, but at Cora's, this dish came with 2 eggs instead of 3. It also came with home fries and fruits.  I went for the Spinach and Cheddar omelette instead, which also came with home fries and fruits. The omelette was humongous!! But I did finish the entire omelette!! I did mention I was hungry earlier...  The omelette was great! I could taste both the spinach and cheddar in the omelette. I was also hella stuffed after.  Cora's version of home fries wasn't much to L or my liking... I also didn't like how the price for L's meal was more expensive than other competing restaurants and they only offered 2 eggs instead of 3. Cora's did not have a special early bird pricing of sorts as I was curious and even asked the cashier for affirmation.  Needless to say, I won't be coming back here again unless it's for meet ups or gatherings but I won't suggest coming here. There's just other breakfast places around Scarborough  that is cheaper, offers more for the usual breakfast meal (like 3 eggs instead of 2), etc.   Although Cora's do offer more fruit in their meal, that isn't a quality that I'm specifically looking for when it comes to breakfast. Cora's also offer more vegetarian choices than some of the other places, which is to consider for individuals with different dietary choices!"}
{"text":"We got here at prime brunch time on a Saturday morning... luckily the two of us only had to wait 15 minutes. And let me tell you, this place is well worth the wait!  The menu is packed with just about every breakfast food that you could imagine! There are things you wouldn't even think of to eat for breakfast/brunch.  I decided to live life on the adventurous side with an order of \"Raspberry for Lucy\" - which is a raspberry cream cheese crepe topped with even more raspberry and raspberry coulis! I felt like I was eating dessert for breakfast which is a walk on the wild side for me as I'm a straight-laced egg-for-breakfast kinda person.  My friend ordered the amazing veggie omlette that had more veggies than you could imagine - seriously, have you ever seen broccoli and cauliflower in an omlette? I think not! Not only was the portion huge, but it came with roasted potatoes (Mmmmm... my fave with hot sauce!), AND a huge heaping pile of fresh fruit!   Oh Cora, how your breakfast makes me smile. And the decor? Well, let's just say it's so in your face, that you can't help but smile!"}
{"text":"Live in the deep south east of calgary had one benefit.. Coras! Now with several other locations open it's hard to convince friends to come down for a visit.   When coras first opened I went with the highest expectations...the pretty fruit carvings.. and filled plate really left me content with my  \"coras experiences\" ... however... after you've been a few times waited upwards of 40 mins in queue .. I'm kind of  \"over\" coras. The fruit gets dull.. and the menu options though it seems like they got lots.. it just doesn't hit the spot any more.   My favourite was also the eggs Benedict... though the waffles are delicious too.   If you've never been in Calgary.. then I recommend trying it out for sure! But just don't keep going ever few weeks.. or you'll get bored of it.   I'm still on the search for a great brunch place in Calgary!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Coras since I was a very young child. It definitely used to be a place I loved going. Coras is undeniably child/family friendly. There is a menu specifically for children, kids are provided crayons and colouring paper and their portions are just right.   With that being said, I probably would not come here unless I was bringing children to eat breakfast. The decor has not changed at all since the the 90s, neither has the menu or the appearance of the food. I received a very outdated plate of plain pancakes, accompanied by a sole slice of cantaloupe with a single piece of pineapple inserted between the peel and the fruit. There was also a single two inch piece of lettuce which really did not belong on the plate at all. We also ordered some pancakes for the kids which kept them satisfied. We also ordered a plate called \"the 7th of July\" which looked better, the portion of fruit was much more generous and the French toast was nice. however the crepe was slightly rubbery in taste.   The service was good, the waiter was quick and helpful. However the manager seems like he never smiles. This location also has an abundance of parking space and is surrounded by other places of interest."}
{"text":"Went in starving, came out stuffed! Great variety of quality brunch fare. Reasonable price. Atmosphere is simple, not too loud. Expect a line on the weekend!"}
{"text":"Our Saturday morning ritual involves breakfast out, usually at Humpty's, but this time, on a friends recommendation, we ventured out to try Cora's. I can't believe we have never heard of it before. The restaurant was warm, welcoming and friendly, a great place for families. The service was fast and fun and the place appeared clean and hygienic. The menu selection is phenomenal including eggs, fruit, smoked salmon and much more.  The only downside is that everyone wants to eat there so the line-up was long, but worth the wait.   Well done Cora!"}
{"text":"I have never stormed out of a restaurant before today. Cora's... oh, Cora's. You're usually SO GOOD, but today (Wed, May 16, 2018): -Greeter gives us thick attitude soon as we're in the door because it was a chore for her to clear us a seat (it was not busy) -Server took 4 tries to understand my simple order -Wrong food comes, and server insists I am wrong about what I ordered -Toast is left on table as my order is returned to the kitchen, so I take a bite and find A BIG LONG HAIR CONNECTING MY LIPS TO THE TOAST. I immediately stormed up to the server yelling and showing everyone in the restaurant what I pulled out of my mouth. I threw the hairy toast on her station, spat my mouthful of toast on our table and left. I've been to Cora's a dozen times. It's usually fantastic, but this was inexcusable."}
{"text":"First and last visit. Pancakes: cold; rubbery. Bacon: cold. Hamburger: yuck.  (If you can't present an edible  hamburger, take it off the menu.) Decor: felt like we were eating in a kindergarten room surrounded by cartoonish drawings of food. Maybe a good place when dining with young kids. Our kids are all grown up. We won't be back."}
{"text":"The breakfast items here are amazing! However, sometimes I wish they just had basic pancakes or waffles. Maybe that's the southerner in me talking?  Either way, they give you a great big helping of fruit that is delicious of course! It's a mixture of grapes, sliced apples, honeydew and bananas from what I can remember. I ordered the panini and it was very good. I can't wait to come back and try the other items on the menu.   Beware though: lineups are outside the door on the weekend so come early and prepared!"}
{"text":"This is one of those times I wish I had a split grade for service and for quality of food.   We arrived at 9:30 am on Sunday.  A very busy time.  There was a 10 minute wait to be seated.  In hindsight I wish we had gone earlier, especially for a Sunday.   The hostess was very polite and seated us.  However, our server was clearly rushed.  We got a coffee that we had not ordered. Then again it did not show on my bill either  I ordered the breakfast burger and the wife ordered Eggs Benedict.  The meal arrived 25 mins later.  My burger was hot but the home fries were cold.  My wife's eggs and cheese had cooled and congealing.   I asked for a hot meal.  8 mins later she returns with our plates.  The home fries were still cold.  Our server said, \"Is the meal, OK?\" And before I could say anything. She said, \"Fine\" and walked away.   Both meals were tasty and the price was reasonable.  They offer a lot of fruit meals, which I may consider if we arrive an a very busy time.    For me the food was: 4 stars The service was: 2 stars"}
{"text":"Just called to order some take out. The lady flat out rejected us on the phone and said \"We're not accepting any orders - kitchen is overloaded.\" Hey no problem lady - I'll take my $$$ elsewhere.  While I understand it's a busy day today (Mother's Day), it's not the customers fault that the kitchen is \"overloaded\". That your management failing miserably at their job. If you don't have enough common sense to staff extra help in the kitchen on a day where you'll probably have increased traffic, you shouldn't be in the restaurant business."}
{"text":"They didn't take names, so expect people to cut in line. Food was average but it took forever. The waitress s very pleasant."}
{"text":"OKish. It's Cora's. They are all the same. Nothing special but also nothing outright objectionable. I had the western skillet. It was fine. Service was fine."}
{"text":"This place is busy and its forgivable. No matter what time you'll find yourself having to stand in line but the line does crawl to a pace and you'll be seated in no time!  In my first visit I ordered their skillet which was packed with fresh juicy veggies, potatoes, spinach, tomato, and cheese. They asked how I would like my eggs on it and I asked for raw poached. AMAZING, never had such tasty and healthy meal to start my weekend day. They had a decent helping of toast and fruit on the side as well.  The service was attentive and quick. Prices are fair and competitive with chain breakfast joints like Denny's and Ricki's. But what I liked best about Cora's was that finally a great breakfast spot down south! Seriously, I'm sick of having to rack up the miles on my leased civic and burning non renewable energy and adding to the many first world problems that burden my life."}
{"text":"2 stars is just fair. Nothing bad you find there but nothing good either. Toronto deserves better."}
{"text":"Went here for a late breakfast today. I've been looking for a breakfast restaurant in my area. The nice thing about Cora's, is they are open until 3pm and offer plenty of healthy options. These healthy options come with a price though. For 2 people it came to $30. Kind of expensive for breakfast I think.  We ordered the Jo Construction and the Cora Special. Mine came with a crepe. In the picture it looked like the crepe had something in it. When I got my order, the crepe did not have anything in it. The ham was great, but the bacon tasted like that ready-made bacon you get at subway. I don't care for it. Service was good. Fruit was fresh. I'd go back, but I'd order something else. I'm more interested in finding a family-run breakfast restaurant."}
{"text":"Been several times and normally pretty good.  Was busy but not crazy as several tables were empty.  Around 12:55 on a Saturday.   Took over 30 minutes for food to arrive after we ordered and toast was hard and not great, potatoes were on the cold side and some of the fruit was not eatable.  A little past it's due date.   Was very disappointed and won't be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"8:45am on a Saturday morning, I expected Cora's to be packed.  Thankfully we arrived prior to the rush and were seated quickly.  Service was good to start, the food came out quickly and correctly (including substitutions and add-ons). The meals were tasty and eggs were cooked as ordered. My only complaint is once the food was served, the server was never to be found so we were not able to request a top up of coffee or refill of water which was  disappointing."}
{"text":"I love Cora, but this location needs to improve their service. Doesn't keep up with Cora standards. Food came late, orders mixed up, uninterested waiters/waitresses. No ones interested in answering any questions. Food is ok, if they serve the right things to the right table."}
{"text":"I was here this morning!this place was so busy....I was in a rush....the service was very good and fast....good food,but a bite expensive..."}
{"text":"Simple, homey feeling, traditional Diner, nothing fancy, food is simple, freshly prepared, I was here for late breakfast in a weekday, it was  full house with couple of minutes of waiting, the strawberry avalanche French Toast is not that great, strawberry topping is compote, not the best, but seem to be made out of fresh strawberries.  Wait for food was average.  Will definitely come back here for quick simple bite if I'm in t"}
{"text":"The service here was always slow. It's closed down now, another replacement restaurant is being constructed. In the meantime they sell a few snacks and coffee at a counter."}
{"text":"Cora's is great for breakfast!  They have so many fresh & healthy options.  I went a few weeks ago and got this summer banana & mango topped waffle and it was ah-mazing!  This location is usually super busy but I was pleasantly surprised not having to wait at all for a table for 2!   The only reason I am not awarding 5 stars is because the server forgot what I ordered, and was very very slow serving us.  We were there for 1.5 hrs.  The wait to take our order was quite long, and then an extra wait because she forgot what I ordered.  I'm not sure why she didn't come back right away but maybe she forgot about our table?  I'm not sure.  We had to ask for the bill 3 times before she brought it over and then again had to wait over 5 minutes for her to come back so we could pay when I had my wallet out ready to pay before she even brought the bill. 5 stars for food, 3 stars for service.  I will go back again, but don't go if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"First time to Toronto didn't know where to go pulled up on google would recommend to any one looking for breakfast great selection and good food and really good servive"}

{"text":"Large portion. Good taste. Good service. To avoid wasting food and get obese, I'd suggest two people share one order. Tip is included in the bill. The restroom (for men) was a bit smelly this morning."}
{"text":"Not too sure why this place has three stars. While the place was packed, it was morning and in the middle of the city. The wait was actually not that long and once we sat down we got our drinks and stared at a menu fill with terrific looking food. Like a classier, American Denny's this place was really good and the staff was friendly!"}
{"text":"Best Franchise Breakfast in Calgary! This place beat's Denny's! The breakfasts are great - lots of fruit and decent portions. The staff and owners are really nice and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I had positive experiences at both their Montreal and Ottawa locations; however, I could not say the same for the Queensway location.   Originally from Quebec, the Chez Cora Empire has expanded to other provinces in Canada through franchise opportunities. For some businesses this proves to be a negative and for other businesses it is a positive. For Chez Cora, it most definitely is the former.  My friend and I decided to come here at around noon on a Sunday. It was crowded, like most brunch places in Toronto. We waited in line for about twenty minutes. Luckily it wasn't cold outside so the friend and I just chatted while waiting. Once we were seated, we had to wait for a good 20 minutes before our server came to us. He was friendly enough, but barely came to our table. When the food arrived, it was cold like it had just been sitting at the kitchen. I ordered the Raspberry 4 Lucie and noticed that it was a significantly smaller portion than served at the Montreal and Ottawa locations. Considering the discrepancy in size, it cost the exact same amount!  All I can say is, skip this place!"}
{"text":"Didn't actually end up eating here - their website says they open at 6 on a weekday, came here to find out they don't open til 10 or 11. Ended up going to Markham Station instead."}
{"text":"December 16, 2015 10:50. As I came in very few tables occupied. After a Good morning greeting with 3 different waitresses I was waiting to be seated, and waiting and waiting... Suddenly I saw at the cashier one waitress changing shifts and counting money... Are you serious ladies? Those mature quite old ladies forgot what customer service means.... I left some minutes after, couldn't believe my eyes..."}
{"text":"I always love coming to Cora's. It's always super busy on the weekends so thankfully we had reservations. Typical of Cora, it's bright, colourful, large windows, and has lots of seating.   Service was average and our food came in a reasonable amount of time considering the large group our waiters had to serve.   To eat I got the Penelope burrito which comes with a side of homefries which I always enjoy. My mom had pancakes which she said was definitely some of the best she's ever had, and everyone else got the typical breakfast meals--eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, etc. Someone in my group also got the oatmeal which was served in a beautiful dish and someone else got a crepe which looked divine. Overall, presentation of the food is always beautiful .   Cora is definitely one of my favourite and go to places to dine for breakfast/brunch and they never disappoint."}
{"text":"Come here with a healthy appetite. I ordered the Blueberry Fields pancakes & it was challenging to finish that stack of three.  BTW, they were absolutely delicious. An absolute \"must have\""}
{"text":"Not really a fan of Cora's.  I've been there several times, never had a meal that was consistently the same temp (on the same plate).  Their fruit plates are nice and well presented, but otherwise, their \"hot\" (read: some hot, some cold) dishes leave a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"Disgusting.    With all the food options Toronto provides, why would anyone ever want to come here.   The fruit is dry and pre cut, washed in something to keep it from going brown.    The other items such as pancakes are made the way everyone use to 20 years ago.   Food has progressed and changed.   If you want that old fashioned way of doing it, at least find a greasy spoon where they know how to do it right.     This is a tourist trap before weekend baseball games, that's it."}
{"text":"The reason I rate 3 stars is because we were there at 8:30am and didn't get our food until 9am. They were short on staff. It took 5 min to get a coffee and out order taken.  Once we were served I can't complain about the food. We had pancakes and bacon and egg and they were delicious.  Had a good breakfast too bad they took so long..."}
{"text":"I am actually upgrading my previous rating to 5-stars based on a delicious lunch I had recently from their new Spring Lunch menu. It is the first time that I have had lunch at Cora's; I was there for breakfast again, and only tried the Forestiere Skillet as it looked really good from the picture and description... and it was excellent! Strips of chicken, mushrooms and roasted potatoes mixed together with béchamel sauce; I chose the southwestern salad with corn and beans as my side, as well as the fruit bowl with cream for dessert. Everything was delicious and filling for only $11 (plus drink + tax). There were a few other interesting choices listed like the Waldorf salad and some sandwich plates, but I was very satisfied with my choice."}
{"text":"I've tried to go to Cora's in the SE a few times, but there is always a massive line.  Finally after waking up very early on a Sunday with jet-lag, I was able to get there before 8am...to find that it was pretty much packed with screaming children.  This is definitely more family-oriented than the downtown location. Shortly after we arrived, there was already a line out the door by 8:00.  I would give Cora's a 4 on food and service. They have a pretty good breakfast menu, and I like that you get a lot of fruit with your meal. But it is tough to find a good breakfast/brunch spot in the burbs where you can go to hungover and not be surrounded by whiny children...and not have to arrive before 8am to be seated!  Therefore the downgrade to a 3. I like the downtown location more!"}
{"text":"Loved It!  Went to Toronto for the weekend and this was a great way to start the day if you don't want to stick with Hotel food.  Pro: Great food, I had the Belgian Waffle with Strawberries.  Con: Very popular so a Long Line (out the door), but the wait was worth it and at the end wasn't so bad.  Next time I'm in Toronto, I will make sure I start my day at Cora's"}
{"text":"Cora's fruit displays always make me smile.....  :)  I first discovered \"Chez Cora\" in Montreal on a business trip, back in 1998.  I remember at that time thinking that the concept was so unique, that all I needed was $250,000 unencumbered cash, to bring this business to Calgary.  Yes... sadly.... I looked into it.  But, I was a bit short in dough, and further, I am not a restauranteur.  I eat in restaurants.  That's what I do.  I was delighted when Cora's made it to Calgary.  I wouldn't say I am regular there by any stretch, but it is the breakfast place I choose when I am looking for a plate with more fruit, and less bacon.  :)  You can get the bacon there too, but you will be challenged to find that much fruit anywhere else.    The \"breakfast\" food itself is comparable to any other family restaurant.  A poached egg tastes like a poached egg, no matter where I go.  However, the large fruit portions in a lovely display are what keep me going back there.  Another consideration on whether I choose Cora over any other place is how I am \"feeling\".  There are a lot of kids in this family restaurant, so be advised of that.  This may not be your first choice on Saturday morning, after a wicked Friday.  On most days for me, it is just what the doctor ordered!"}
{"text":"Good food bad service no smile or greetings when they welcome u in. Every time I come j regret coz of the hostess. Always the worse table."}
{"text":"I generally love Cora's but this location is not the best. I got the strawberry waffles last time and the waffle was not cooked fully and ended up really soggy. Service is slow, definitely not the best Cora's that I've been to."}
{"text":"I have never had a disappointing experience at Coras besides the fact that if you don't want to wait in line for 30 minutes or more to get a table you have to wake up really early in the morning to have no wait. When I go, I always go for 8:00am and never have to wait but by 9:00am there is a line.  Oh well, with a line I guess that means it is a really good restaurant and it is.  Fresh food and fresh delicious breakfast food none the less- what could be better ?  All I have to say is- Crepes :)"}
{"text":"I didn't know that most places are closed on Sunday in town, I think there was only 3 places open for breakfast, the first one had a line so I tried this one but still had maybe a 20 minute wait to get in. The servers were fairly attentive but it was busy so they were going all out. Food was OK, nothing special, I was just glad to get breakfast before noon."}
{"text":"They had terrible service this morning-  we waited 10 minutes before anyone greeted us. Then 10 more minutes for water & coffee. The food is not that great. The wait was triple that for the bill. We were 1 of 4 tables when we came in so there was no reason for the wait. When we left there was a giant line - but so many empty tables!  We wanted to warn the line not to eat there! Go somewhere else unless you have 1.5 hrs for bfast."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and Cora's is still my favorite breakfast place!   What I really like here is the selection I boast that I have tried everything on the menu because I have, I especially like the thin pancakes here; they are almost like crepes. The smoothies are good and so is the freshly squeezed oranges juice; it has a nice squeezed taste. The fruits that come with the meal are always fresh and delicious.   Every time I come here there is a line up, but what's nice about that is that you can eat the fruits hanging on the side; provided no one is looking of course ;)"}
{"text":"This place deserves more stars.  The food was excellent. Nice and fresh with fairly large portions. I had the eggs Benedict and was very pleased. I'm super picky when it comes to that. Yummy yummy home fries!! I had some sautéed mushroom on top to make it extra delicious. My only complaint is that my tummy wasn't big enough to hold all that food.  I love coras."}
{"text":"Here is very good place to have breakfast, but always busy, that's why some times we need to wait long time at outside of the restaurant. Summer time, it's nothing problem, but winter...,omg it's kind of hard...  There's menu is very difficult to choose one plate. Because each of them different and looks delicious. Always I spend long time to choose the one of the menu. Maybe this Sunday also I'll go there, haha"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast at around 9AM on Sunday (Canada day weekend) and it was not packed. The first order of smoothie and food came pretty quickly, however the 2nd order of the kale smoothie took some time to come, (we finished eating by the time it came).   The food tasted good and was very filling. They use a hazelnut spread (which is not nutella, but still tasted really nice which was nice)  The service was good and besides the smoothie, was pretty quick!"}
{"text":"First meal I had in Toronto and it was great! Who doesn't like breakfast food?  The line was ridiculously  long bit it moves very fast. They served good portion sizes. We ate outside, loved the ambience. Only bad thing I have to say is I wanted a Sangria but it had oranges in it and I'm allergic. Overall it was good food."}
{"text":"Good breakfast place. Decent portions. I had the Garagatuan which was eggs, sausage, bacon, pancakes and toast. There was also a serving of fruit. A slice of cantaloupe, orange and pineapple. Our server was nice and attentive.  I would definitely be back here for breakfast when I am back in the area. The close early afternoon."}
{"text":"Cora's is not a typical brekky joint.  You don't come in for bacon and eggs, with home fries, toast and coffee for $7.  I've tried and its just not the same. Instead, double the price and get loaded up on a truly unique meal with dishes you will find in no other restaurant.  A key signature of Cora's is the mound of fresh cut fruit that adorns many a plate.  Today I stopped in for a late breakfast--nearly lunch, so I chose a crepe, the Trois Riviéres, which is a savoury crêpe filled with artisanal pork sausages, caramelized onions and melted cheese. The full sized version has quite the calorie count, so this is a treat, not a routine.  I have had a variety of different meals from Cora's across the country.  All are unique, and different, with a wide variety of options and quite a bit of creativity."}
{"text":"Quiche of the day was as rubbery as a Super Ball. Yuck.  We went for lunch and there weren't very many choices - it's really a breakfast/brunch place - lots of crepes, waffles, etc."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch after the Men's Hockey Team dominated for the gold medal.  Half in the bag at 8am i met some friends here before the Raptors game (wicked day eh?).  Decided to get a mimosa and eggs benny.  Didn't drink the mimosa but the benny was wicked!  Loved the fruit salad you got with it.  This was my first Cora expereince and it was A-OK"}
{"text":"I used to look up to Cora as the great Cdn story of good  and honest small business.  I can't tell you how disappointed I am. The kid's meal is the biggest rip off ever. $2.50 for a tiny glass of smoothie. Half a scrambled egg and 2 tiny strips of bacon plus a few wedges of potatos cost the same as the adult version of 2 egg + bacon.  The service is fine but the value is definitely not there."}
{"text":"Solid brunch place with a country feel to the decor. Very busy on the weekends but a fast turn over so line up moves pretty quick. Lots of comfy seating with large windows that let in all the sunshine.   I'm a sucker for eggs benedict and here they offer a one egg option, perfect for a bird like me. I ordered the Egg Ben et Dictine with asparagus, swiss cheese and added mushrooms. Eggs and asparagus were overcooked, hash browns were on the dry side however fruit were cut into interesting designs. Despite the cooking faux pas it was still a tasty and filling breakfast. Good spot to spend some time with family and friends over breakfast/lunch."}
{"text":"I went in for breakfast one rainy morning with my husband and we got seated without a wait. The place was decorated well and it felt like an upscale I-hop.   It looked like a place that offered quite a bit of fruit options but my we decided to go with egg options. My husband spinach and cheddar omelette and I got the Theo's option of the egg, potato grateau. I enjoyed the meal but it was quite cheesy and I got filled very quickly.  Overall, I really enjoyed it and I would be back. I would have given it a 5 star but it more on the expensive site so I knocked off a star. I would still recommend it and I would be back on another day to indulge."}
{"text":"I went to coras today for a brunch and before I even got a chance to take a sip of my orange juice, my server put my boyfriends coffee in the worse spot. She went to collect our menus after taking out order and spilt the coffee all over me.  So I'm pleased. This was my first time coming to coras. I never come to coras because of the atmosphere. It's to busy and to rushed I got a cup of coffee spilt all over my pants. I obviously couldn't eat my food. So left ."}
{"text":"Excellent and decently affordable breakfasts.    I went there twice. The first time I had a breakfast burrito type thing that was great. My gf had the muesli with yogurt and fruit which was nice too.    Their eggs Benedict could use a little more love as the hollandaise was a bit flat.   Their breakfast burger was also great and very filling.   I like that most of the plates come with fresh fruit.   The servers were nice and friendly and generally quite prompt.   I've been to another one of their locations in TO and also had a great experience.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I won't be coming back to this place or any Cora's.  The food was cold when it came out, service was lacking, and you pay too much for what you get.  I had two pieces of cinnamon brioche French toast, some fruit, three little sausages and one egg, yes you read it right, one egg.  Who serves one egg?  If you scramble it, you do t get much.  Had mine over easy and it was way over cooked.  Don't waste your money folks and couldn't see any reason for the hype."}
{"text":"I don't understand they take my order we eat doesn't check up on us one small glass of water after eating whole Meal nothing to clear my throat very disappointed !"}
{"text":"Cora franchise never disappoints!  I try not to go to groovy with breakfast so I get the same thing everytime (easier to review no?)... So the Eggs Bendictine w/mushroom and Swiss or asparagus and brie (sometimes combined for extra price) let me just say their hollandaise sauce is scrumptious mouthwateringly deliciously fatty lol but worth it as long as you don't eat it often.   I think out of all Cora's I've been to this has quite the crowd so no surprise on a Sunday morning that you're waiting 10-20 mins and expect service times to delay unless you're a Scrooge who needs fast and efficient everything-blah   Anyways! Scarborough chumps em all!"}
{"text":"The food isn't bad.  If you have Celiac Disease and expect to be able to safely eat gluten-free here, think again.  They are quite clear that they don't do much in the way of preventing cross-contamination, and with a kitchen as busy as theirs how could they?  Your safest bet is to order an omlette and substitute the regular bread for **UNTOASTED** gluten-free bread, or maybe try the fruit cup."}
{"text":"Better than most chain breakfast joints as they have lots of fruit. Try the 1990's harvest."}
{"text":"Great restaurant, the food is good home style food with a lot of french inspiration (primarily in the form of crepes).  The service is very friendly, both times we have gone the wait staff was very attentive, with frequent coffee refills and very quick to take our order.  The food was extremely good, I had the Jo Construction and my wife had ... something else, don't recall what it was but it involved removing the meat and cheese, both of which they did without question and without error.  I only have two complaints about this location.  1.  We've gone at about 11am on Saturday both times and what I've noticed is that you may want to bag a snack because you're going to wait in line for quite a while just to be seated.  Not to suggest the restaurant is in anyway bad, but the options for a weekend brunch are pretty limited given the area, so I imagine that tends to contribute to the long lines.  2.  Both times I've had my Jo Construction, the eggs were done perfectly, the bacon was crispy and not dried out or charred, and the sausages were cooked perfectly.  With all of those accomplishments, you would think the home fries would be equally as tended to but you would be mistaken, in both cases my home fries were consistently under cooked and still a little raw.  They taste as though they were dropped into the bacon grease on the pan, quickly pan fried, and taken off the fire as soon as the bacon and sausage links were ready.  All in all, great restaurant and I'd definitely visit it again!"}
{"text":"For a fruit lover like me, this place was paradise!  I'm talking MOUNTAINS of fruit, more fruit than even I could eat.  I got a breakfast wrap with eggs, cheese and bacon that came with a fruit mountain - grapes, bananas, pineapple, plums, strawberries, kiwi, watermelon, canteloupe...  The wrap was good, not the most exciting breakfast ever, but the fruit more than made up for it.  Good coffee and friendly service.  It was nice to get filled up but still feel like I was being pretty healthy from all the fruit."}
{"text":"Brunch spot!  I have been here before and I do enjoy the food the only thing is that I always know that there will be a line up. Then when your seated I you feel rushed to eat and get out fast for the next group to be seated.  I also find that they are chintzy like lest give a table of five people 3 Jams and one peanut butter, it's  just going to starting a family feud."}
{"text":"No clue why people like this place so much.  My eggs, bacon and pancakes looked like they should have been part of a child's kitchen play set and tasted like plastic to match.  Service was bellow average. There were 3 severs for the place which you would think would be enough for maybe a total of 20 people (12 of which were a group of police officers).  Drive right by this place and go have the cheep breakfast at Ikea - I'm positive it will taste better."}
{"text":"Along with a friend, I was taking  a short holiday in Toronto.  It was a beautiful day.  We went on a walkabout seeking  a place for breakfast.  Decided on Cora's.   We couldn't resist the patio and having breakfast in the sun.  Our food was very good.  I had a traditional breakfast.   I am sure she had some frou-frou thing that probably involved some fruit, maybe even some yogurt or who knows maybe even oats.    We enjoyed it.  The service could probably of been a tad more observant.  But it was a nice enough day not to worry too much about it.  They also had a yummy smoothie and good fresh OJ."}
{"text":"A pretty standard Cora's outlet. This particular one being close to hotels is generally packed with tourists but they turn over tables fast and furious without compromising the quality of their offerings. Lots on the menu, almost an overwhelming array of options.  Everything comes with a great array of fresh fruit."}
{"text":"I generally prefer less chain type restaurants but there isn't much selection in the SE. I do find the food tasty but always go for a crepe or something very fruit based so I am not sure on the other menu items.   If you are going to go on the weekend don't wait until you are starving since it's going to be a 20-30 minute wait to matter where you go and at any Cora's location.   Overall the waitresses are pretty friendly and they seem to handle the crowds of people pretty well but I definitely feel a little rushed to eat and get out so that the crowd of people waiting to get in can sit down so it's good for a quick breakfast but not if you're wanting to chat and catch up with someone."}
{"text":"I'm not so hot on Cora's.  I have been here over the span of three years and not much has changed since my first visit.  I remember it being incredibly busy (line out the door) and too much of a scene for me while traveling.  On my latest visit, however, I ordered take away pancakes because I was flying out that morning and did not want to eat in the hotel.  Pancakes were ok, not amazing.  I have had way better.  Syrup was ok.  Something was really weird and artificial about the butter though.  Completely turned me off of eating.  Would not have this as my top choice to eat breakfast while in Toronto."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! My daughter ate her entire meal that included a chocolate chip pancake, eggs, bacon, potatoes and fresh fruit. I have a French toast sandwich and a huge bowl of fresh fruit. The atmosphere itself is ok, the tables were a little close together."}
{"text":"One of my favourite places in Scarborough for breakfast or brunch. Earlier the better especially on weekends and holidays.  The crêpe omelette is my usual, particularly because of the hollandaise sauce and a generous serving of fruit. Definitely enough to fill you for a good part of the day. Prices are also reasonable but definitely a level up from say Markham Station or Panagios which are also good options. Will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"SO Bright and Fun! I Enjoyed the Brioche topped with a fried egg, bacon, and a TON of Fruit! My BF had a more traditional 2 eggs, bacon, toast, and home fries with Fruit! SUPER Colorful Presentation! Excellent Service! Great Coffee! Yummmmmmm!"}
{"text":"I got a smoothie bowl and it was pretty good but the price on it is a little steep at $10. I switched the bananas for blueberries because I'm not a fan of bananas. The kale mango smoothie that the fruits are on is really good. The colour of the bowl is really pretty and it's definitely very healthy! I enjoyed it. I had eaten a little before coming to Coras so this was good enough for me, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone that is really hungry. The overall place is a little small and it wasn't air conditioned so on a hot day it was a tad bit uncomfortable. But the windows and doors were open to let in some air. The washrooms aren't indicated with signs so you gotta do some searching to find them. Service is decent, all smiles."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of iHop in USA. When I was looking for similar places a friend of mine suggested Cora's.  I ordered Rosemary's Sunday which consists of Eggs, bacon, blueberry pancakes. In addition fruit and toast with coffee.  I had a pleasant experience here.  Food is good.  Ambience is good.  Service is good.   Not to damper the spirits but it's not as good as iHop. But it's the next best thing in Calgary."}
{"text":"One of the better Cora's in term of the service. They were very polite and patient with us. This one has always been my go to brunch place as it has options for any body.  I have been many times and my usual go to's are the platters with sausages, bacon, and potatoes. However, the portions for those are rather large and extremely filling.  If i was craving for something sweeter, I usually go for a waffle. There is waffles that come in either salty toppings or sweet. The Caramel and Banana waffle is delicious; the waffle is fluffy and the custard cream compliments the bananas without being too sweet. The other option is having the waffle topped with sausages, bacon, and eggs. Also tastes very good and it really just depends on what you want that day.   The crepes are also a good choice as the crepe is soft, moist, and fluffy as well."}
{"text":"This place gets pretty crowded on weekends, but we only waited 5 mins to get a table for two once the cashier that was handling the list of guests waiting for a table turned around and noticed that 3 groups of people had walked in while she was busy staring at all the people that were already seated. I had the brunch burger and coffee.  The brunch burger is topped w/ a cheese omelet, bacon and hollandaise sauce and accompanied by some roasted potato wedges. The burger is a preformed patty that's maybe half meat and half filler. It was dry and tasteless. The hollandaise was a little sweet and the cheese omelet seemed devoid of cheese and cheese flavor. Eating it was a bit messy and could've used an extra napkin or two, but since our waitress didn't give us any or come around after the food was delivered, I had to make that one napkin stretch. All-in-all, it made me think I should've ordered the cherry pancakes instead.  The coffee was hot and bottomless, but you'll need to flag down your waitress to get a refill since our waitress wasn't in the habit of carrying the coffee carafes around refilling her customers cups and the other waitresses that did didn't come near our table.  Service was friendly and satisfied the bare minimum required of servers.  Tl;dr: food and service are both \"meh\", but at least the coffee's hot."}
{"text":"Well, the Toronto brunch scene is generally sub-par, and this hoppin' joint (an outpost of a Montreal hotspot) is no exception.  All the chumps in the downtown core who have the misfortune of living in poorly-constructed condos and have apparently not taken the moral of the story of Fight Club to heart line up to eat overpriced crepes.  Fortunately they have their Ikea couches to return to upon ingesting the immense amount of fat-laden food that they have eaten.  Hey, at least it comes with fruit.  All over your bacon.  That's what she said."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I have had in awhile! So many choices and fresh fruit with every order!"}
{"text":"This was an odd one. I've been relatively happy with my experiences at Cora's in the past, although it's a rare thing for the food to actually arrive *hot*.  We showed up around 1:00 on a weekday for lunch and the place was virtually empty. I decided to go with the beef panini-crêpe, which oddly enough comes with either beef or chicken. (I picked beef.)  After an oddly long wait to receive the food, I bit into my crêpe and immediately noticed that it tasted awfully dry. According to the menu, the crêpe is meant to come with mushrooms, swiss cheese, and barbecue sauce. It quickly became apparent that there was no barbecue sauce contained in the wrap. I waited for the waitress to return for a few minutes, but she was a no-show. (As an aside, when we finally left the restaurant, we noticed our waitress standing outside smoking a cigarette. I suppose that explains her lengthy absence.)  Anyway, I didn't want to end up eating a cold wrap, so I dug in even though it was missing a key ingredient. I finished the first half of the wrap, which I can't say I enjoyed too much because of how dry it was, and our waitress finally showed up. I asked for barbecue sauce and she disappeared for another five minutes or so. I was able to eat the last three bites with the sauce and they were, of course, the best bites.  I should also note that after she finally did bring the barbecue sauce, our waitress apologized and said this was the third time the kitchen forgot to include the sauce in the wrap itself. So color me surprised when the bill arrived and the wrap *wasn't* comped! You acknowledge a mistake was made and then you don't do anything about it? Wow."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast place with lots of fresh fruit and coffee is very good. Place is kind of small but wasn't too crowded when we went. Worth trying for breakfast if you are visiting Toronto. Staff is very friendly and nice. Only minor negative is the place is a bit small, so it can get crowded at busy times."}
{"text":"I'm sorry I can't rate Cora less than five stars. This is an amazing place and I really like and enjoy it. Service is great at this location. They usually don't take reservations over the weekend but I came an hour earlier and I was able to speak with people there and boom magic happened I got reservation for 15-25 people. Thank you guys I really appreciate your help even though most of my group got late but we still received great service. Thank you again and keep Cora best breakfast place!"}
{"text":"We had to wait about 10 minutes for a table, but it was well worth it!  Huge selection of sweet or savory Crepes, smoothies, pancakes and more!  Fruit was fresh and delicious.  Service was quick and attentive.  Great place for children.  Something for even the choosiest palette!  Wish they had a Cora's in our area!  My new favorite breakfast spot."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went to Cora for breakfast last weekend. It was our first having Cora breakfast in Calgary. We had Cora in Vancouver and other cities before. This time We've been to the location nearby our place on 130 Ave SE, Calgary. Cora is a Canadian chain of casual restaurants serving breakfast and lunch. The first Cora was opened in Quebec, and now just Cora elsewhere in Canada.  There are more than 50 franchises in Quebec and 130 across Canada.  Environment:  We arrived the restaurant around 9 am. The restaurant was very busy. There were lots of people in the restaurant. Luckily, we didnt wait for too long to get a table. Inside the restaurant was nice and clean. All the decorations on the wall are very simple and cute looking.  Server:  After we sat down, our table server brought the menu to us and began to take an order for the drink. Both of us had Coffee. After took an order, the server brought our drink to the table very fast. Our server was nice and friendly.  Food:  After discussed few minutes about the menu, we decided to order Tomatoes, bacon and green onions and Julie the Girlfriend for breakfast. Tomatoes, bacon and green onions was made by Poached eggs on an English muffin covered with hollandaise sauce served with roasted potatoes and fresh fruit. Available with one, two or three poached eggs!  Julie the Girlfriend included 2 eggs, bacon and roasted potatoes served with a tasty chocolate brioche dipped in French toast batter and garnished with bananas, English cream Cora style and strawberry sauce. All the food came out from kitchen fast. They were well cooked and fresh. Most importantly, all the food were very healthy.  Prices:  The prices of the food were a little bit of expensive. But, I strongly believe that it's worth the prices since they were all in super large portion, and healthier for people.  In summary, we had a great experience in Cora."}
{"text":"Trouble's a brewing at Cora's. The service is getting slower, the portions are getting smaller, and the flavour is getting... less flavourful.  Cora's was my go to place the next morning after a night on the town to eat a big delicious breakfast, but a recent visit with friends has been fairly disappointing.  The Rosemary Sunday comes with blueberry crepes. My wife ordered these, and they were pathetically small and thin. We are not picky at all, we never complain at restaurants, but for $10 she couldn't accept such a small portion. So instead of making bigger ones, she was given a third tiny one. I guess that's how they make them now.  I got the strawberry crepe, typically overflowing with delicious strawberries. This time I was given a more reserved portion lacking in flavour (though strawberries are admittedly out of season at the moment).  My friend got a Cora special. Nowhere near as full as how the pictures portray, or how they once were in the past. At least the potatoes are still delicious.  We still have hope for Cora's in Quebec, where they originated, and where we recently ate with the large, delicious portions we know and love. But given the constant lining up and waiting necessary to get in at this location, it didn't feel worth it this time.  Speaking of the line up, please treat it as such, fellow customers. Amazing how many people think they have a right to shove up to the front past the rest of us."}
{"text":"Great brunch selection! The bagle and lox only has lox on half the bagle, the other half is tomato, and adding some lox for the other half of your bagle costs $7! Way overpriced for that, and too much extra fruit instead of enough lox.  Delicious Cherries pancakes was delicious, and so was the April 89 fruit stuffed crepes with custard and nutella. Every dish comes with more fresh fruit than anyone could finish, not always ripe though."}
{"text":"Food was ok, a bit pricey Service was poor. Seating was a bit cramped $ $$"}
{"text":"Service was fine, but the majority of the fruit was not ripe. Disappointing for a Cora's, considering the fact that their fruit has always been a selling point for me."}
{"text":"This is a standard breakfast place. I usually have to wait 20 minutes or so most times I am there. So i woudn't suggest going there if your are close to passing out hungry. Service is ok, diner like with free coffee refills. I usually have lox and bagel, or the oatmeal.  I go here because I live close by but dont know that i would walk more than 5 minutes to eat at this place."}
{"text":"We go to Cora in Edmonton about a handful of times a year.  The fruit is typically above average.  Not here in Toronto.  Hollandaise sauce was extra salty (I don't wanna know).    Apples, Pineapples and Strawberries tasted as tho they were grown on the frozen tundra.  Eat here but set the bar on the low side so you won't be too disappointed."}
{"text":"Is vous voiles le meilleur déjeuner qui existe chez Cora est le meilleur restaurant pour manger"}
{"text":"There are definitely better brunch places in the world besides this franchise... After trying Jack's in Kitchener and a few other specialty brunch places in downtown Toronto, I don't think I would come to a Cora's unless it's the morning after an inebriated night  I like my potato wedges crisper and non-oily, neither preferences were met by the ones I had at Cora's.  The omelettes are alright.. can't comment because they tasted like things I could make after mashing up some peppers/onions/ham.  Tried my friend's eggs benedict, which also tasted spectacularly mediocre not warranting my return whatsoever  If you're in Toronto, try something other than Cora's.. or cook yourself for omelette for less than $12.  Our waitress was sweet though, and the service was good, and we didn't feel hungry after eating (the three things that made up the three stars..)"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The whole menu is filled with a ton of different options all with a delicious and healthy focus.   I had the crepomelette and it was out of this world!   Only downside is that everyone knows about this place so service is not very fast"}
{"text":"V r visiting & came here with a friend who suggested this place , was very disappointed with the food & mainly with the service ,  waiter Shan extremely rude & has a bad attitude  & when we brought this to his attention he said he was busy with other tables , don't expect this in the service industry. Not happy with food too, eggsmart is a much better place good bf & excellent service. Will never visit this place again"}
{"text":"It's hard for me to get a completely accurate review of Cora without either having another one to compare to, or perhaps a return visit. At the time I was there (beginning of September) I was coming off being ill for a week, so food wasn't quite sitting in my stomach as well as it could have.  However, I don't want to let this really be held against this place. We went on a Saturday morning, and the place was packed, with a line out the door. This is usually ... usually an indicator of quality or at least popularity. Once inside though, we were seated pretty quickly.   Service was pretty okay, but a little inconsistent and our server forgot to bring me the cappuccino I ordered. It took a while for it to get to me, but I chalk this up to the place being super super busy.  As for the food, I ordered crepes .. which were a whole lot heavier than I was expecting. They were also a smidge cold, which was disappointing. In fact, the whole thing resembled a quesadilla in a way. So, not exactly what I was looking for.  On the other hand, the fresh fruit was awesome, and I stole all of that off of Lee's plate .. so in the end it worked out pretty well."}
{"text":"Look - I'm going to start out by explaining that I'm not a fan of Cora's.  Here's the thing - it's over priced.  In the landscape of overpriced breakfast foods, Cora's is the worst offender.  I'm pretty sure it's where #FirstWorldProblems go to feel at peace with one another.  That being said - they manage to deliver.  Their food is good quality.  I mean, it's probably about double what it should cost, but it's good quality.  And I have a feeling the cost is there to keep the clientèle the way they like it.  Best to have the riffraff out on the street, or at that greasy spoon down the road.  Cora's is a place for people who wear layers - but the fancy type of layers they don't need - not the ones to be put on and removed in a systematic way to prevent themselves from freezing during the day, or at night.  But here's the real thing - their pancakes are phenomenal!  I'd eat them all day long."}
{"text":"Everything was too salty and got hair in one of the plates, that's all about the visit. Won't go back."}
{"text":"Upside: Great brunch food, the food is top notch,  Downside: long wait at times and the pay for your food on the way out is a little disorganized and can cause lines of people waiting to pay to back up to the tables where others are eating.."}
{"text":"As a lover of all things Brunch, Cora passes with flying colors. My checklist: a wide menu variety, great atmosphere, busy (but able to get a table), friendly service, and bottomless coffee. I went with the Strawberry Pancakes with mounds of real strawberries, and layered with a cream cheese whip cream.. TO DIE FOR! Fluffy, Light, Warm. Sweet.. I enjoyed every last bite. My husband went with a Ham and Cheese Crepe, in which I was very impressed with the variety of crepes on the menu and the size of the dish. The strawberry banana smoothie went down smooth, but it was mostly just strawberry. The bacon was the only let down in the meal, it definitely could have been thicker and crispier. Overall I loved the bright colors of the restaurant and the bright atmosphere. If only they would expand into the US so I could enjoy their pancakes everyday!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed breakfast at Cora's with my family on Sunday, 13-Aug-2017. Though busy, the wait was worth it. Next time we're in Toronto, we'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Upon arrival in Toronto, my cousin took me here for breakfast. We were seated right away even though it was 10am on a Saturday morning *Canada Day*.  The menu was very overwhelming since there's so many options from waffles to crepes or just regular omelettes. .  I opted for one of the savory crepes. . It was delish! I loved how flavorful and moist it was . I really enjoyed it. However, that's probably the only thing I enjoyed. The coffee was very watery, the service was severely slow and the wait time was obnoxiously long! Maybe i'm just accustomed to how fast-paced everything in NYC is?!?! But I hated waiting for a glass of water.  Bright Side: Every dish is served with fruit!"}
{"text":"Similar to the previous review, I tried to place a takeout order today and was told that they can't take my order, because it is busy.  To me this makes no sense whatsoever. In fact it sounds a bit discriminative - we CAN take orders for customers, but we CAN'T take yours. Huh?!  I am glad that I called ahead rather than driving all the way there just to be refused service.  As a paying customer who frequents this establishment, I don't appreciate being treated this way. Needless to say, I will be taking my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I first went to Cora's in Montreal (called Chez Cora there), a perfect antidote to a night of partying that I always end up doing when in Montreal. So I was pretty psyched to see it appearing in Toronto. Toronto really does need more brunch places.  Cora's is a solid brunch place, and the thing I love most about it is the PILES of fresh fruit they serve you with some dishes. No other brunch place in Toronto that I know of does this. The problem with it is the SUPER long line-ups, especially at this location.  I went today at 1pm on a weekday and it was pleasantly empty, so I really enjoyed my experience there. I had the sunshine panini-crepe, which really hit the spot with the combination of egg, ham, cheese rolled up in a crepe with a mountain of fresh fruit on the side. Other things I've enjoyed there is the raisin-brioche french toast. It's sweet but good.  So I'd say go to this location if it's early or on a weekday. Otherwise, be prepared to wait in line!"}
{"text":"Small wait but that's okay for me. Once seated food came to us really fast. The food was really good. And the service was great as well. And the pricing is reasonable for the amount of good food. Will def come back."}
{"text":"I would have given this a 4* but the service was kinda slow. I ordered the Poached Eggs + Fruit +Rye toast. The eggs were a little cold & over cooked (hence the slow service) but the fruit was freshly cut & the plain yogurt set it off pretty decently. I'm more of a Bacon/Egg guy but sometimes u gotta make good compromises. :)"}
{"text":"This is the best place to go for breakfast!  If you like a healthier, lighter meal there are a ton of choices for you and the majority of their dishes are served with assorted fruit.  If you like your classic bacon and eggs breakfast, this is also the place for you!  The portions are large, the presentation is mouth-watering, the food is delicious and the price is right.  I just want to eat everything, I usually get the 1990's Harvest or a Crepe with fruit + custard and a side of sausages!  This place gets pretty busy on weekend mornings.  They only open till 3pm, but damn, I wished they were a 24/7 operation!"}
{"text":"It's a consistent breakfast chain that offers good food. It's clean & the staff are generally kind.  I always come here when I come back home to visit Ontario or Quebec.  This time I was disappointed. My staple here is getting a nutella raspberry crepe,I felt like I was shanked when she told me that they no longer offer raspberry as a fruit option/subsitute. So I had to go with my backup, a mushroom swiss omelette. The potatoes are either a hit or miss & they were perfect this time.  The prices are ok although I wish it was a little cheaper. I will be back but with much less enthusiam since they took my raspberries away."}
{"text":"Cora is a good chain restaurant for breakfast or brunch. I think their selection is good and the price is also very reasonable. With that said, I don't have any favorites or must try that I can recommend. I've never ordered their smoothies before but my friends really enjoyed it so maybe that's something to try there.  Each meal usually comes with some fruits and two slices of toast which is nice because it seems 'healthier'. Also, you'll definitely be full from the meal.  I noticed a lot of people have issues with services at Cora but I've never had any issues with their services so maybe I'm just lucky.  Just a side note, when you pay for your meal, you have to go up to the front cashier to pay for it. It's always here that I get confused on how to tip them because they don't have a tip jar. Also, they have a plate of fudge right beside the cashier that's complimentary so don't be shy and take one if you love fudge!"}
{"text":"I haven't been to Cora's in awhile so I was surprised that their gluten free friendly menu had shrunk to 3 items only.  With the disclaimer that it isn't for celiacs or those gluten intolerant (me).  So if it is for the fad gfers why bother?  I threw caution to the wind and ordered the gigi omlette with spinach and cheese, gf toast and fruit.  All was good and I had no reaction.  For once I was glad to be gf for the desert served to my family of banana bread w/ some white icing looked nasty and they said it didn't taste good.  My fruit was coveted but I wouldn't share!"}
{"text":"Terrible.  Simply Terrible.  From the Service to the speed at which one gets seated, to the time it takes to get your food and then the bill..........feels like a slow death.  The food is typical Cora food, which is satisfying, but that does not make up for the extremely poor management of this location.  Will not be back, and will make sure to never steer anyone in its general direction."}
{"text":"I was really excited to go here for brunch on Sunday. Waited in line for all but 10 minutes. We were a party of four and our guests were having trouble parking. What with Tiff and the Blue Jays game going on. Cheap parking was next to impossible to find.   Once seated, our waiter, Ken came to place glasses and condiments + plates down on our table. He asked if there were any drinks he could take. No smile!   Smiles are a big asset in the hospitality and service industry. So I'm surprised he didn't at least smile to greet us.   I told him we were waiting on our 4th person to arrive and that we didn't want to place our order until they arrived. He understood and walked away to attend what seemed like, a rather large section to cover on his own.  Regardless, him and I made eye contact one time within the 20 minute waiting period for our 4th person yet he didn't come back once to ask us, \"Are you certain there isn't anything I can bring you to start? \". That was a tad disgruntling. Proper service is checking in at least one more time within a 20 minute waiting period. In spite of me having told him we were waiting for our fourth person.   When our 4th person finally managed to find parking and get to our table. Our waiter came to place our order. While in the midst of processing the bill for the table next to ours. This did not look or seem professional at all! Finish processing the bill for your other customers and then come to serve us.  I ordered what I wanted. However,  he told me they were out of the Turkey sausages. I had to change my order. wonderful (not)!  I ended up getting a spinach and cheddar omelet with an extra chewy bagel. I don't know if this bagel was old and stale or just over toasted. it had a nice flavour but it was awfully chewy.   The home fries looked rather burnt. I didn't even bother trying them.  The melon that they serve, sadly was not ripe at all. Their pineapple was okay. I also ordered the kale and mango smoothie.  Tasty, but they don't carry soy milk,  which makes my smoothie less enjoyable.   Overall.... the ambiance I would give a 5 out of  10. Fairly loud and tightly squeezed. The service 3 out of 10. Ken, it seemed like you don't like your job. Granted,  not many people do... but at least don't let those feelings show in your work performance and to your customers. That's not cool. The food was pretty good: 6 out of 10. I wish they ordered enough turkey sausages for their weekend breakfast service! And that they carried soy milk.  Return likelihood? : 4 to 6 out of 10."}
{"text":"I had lunch here on a weekday, and I was not very impressed.  The restaurant was half-empty when I showed up, but the service was still ridiculously slow.  I can't imagine how poor the experience would have been had the restaurant been full.  The food itself was OK.  The side salad was actually very good and my crepe wrap was fine, when it eventually came."}
{"text":"We tried eating here for 6 days... place is always always busy That's is a good signal  We finally  made today because the line wasn't that bad  The service was fast in and out in less that an hour( we were in a rush) The food was great many options and very tasty."}
{"text":"The decor is a little whack but the service and the food are absolutely outstanding!  I had the breakfast poutine and it was unbelievably delish. I mean if I could go back into the kitchen with skid-steer I'd load up on that breakfast poutine and swim in it while eating.   A must eat, the breakfast poutine includes roasted  potatoes, cheese curds, sausage bits, bacon, sautéed roast peppers, an egg (I ordered a poached egg medium) all smothered in a delightful hollandaise sauce.  Keep in mind it's a dish that probably boasts a days worth of calories.  Whatevs. It's freaking great.   Anyway, plan your next breakfast at Cora's. Seriously do it. But get there early.  This place is no secret. It's that good."}
{"text":"They are good.. Second time there but will continue to go just for the food..  Note: Staff make you wait and keep informing you with sarcasm thinking its cool but it is not.."}
{"text":"Just ate at Cora's and I am not pleased with what I just experienced. I ordered the April 89, which is a crepe with fruit and a choice of custard, Nutella or both. I decided to go with half of each. My wife ordered an omelette with bacon, cheddar, tomatoes and bacon. When our meals were brought out, there was no bacon in the omelette. We had to send it back. I've had better crepes and the omelette was subpar. The menu doesn't offer a vast amount of choices. Everything revolves around lackluster crepes. Definitely won't return the next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"This place is always packed! You have to get there early because there's usually a line up, especially on weekends.   The food is pretty good, but it's a little pricey for what you're getting.   I recommend the more \"desserty\" sounding dishes, if you're going for a real breakfast kind of diner, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Good size portions and food is always fresh.  Add in the good service, and it's a win win!!!"}
{"text":"Standard breakfast spot. Nothing much more to say than that.   Did a simple order if eggs and bacon and got a huge side if potatoes as well. Expect big portions   The price is not bad. The food is pretty good. The service is okay."}
{"text":"We normally go to Frans for breakfast, but we decided to give this a try. Very nice atmosphere - bright and cheerful. Perfect vibe for a Sunday morning. The service was quick. The food was okay - had the Fruit Crunch yogurt and Ode to Oatmeal - somewhat pricey. The drinks were delicious though - especially the mochaccino. Would go back for a change, but not necessarily a go-to type place."}
{"text":"Fun decor, extensive menu and huge servings.  Food is standard diner-fare.  Our server was great, very attentive and helpful.  You'll experience waits during the weekend.  If you get tired of just ordering orange juice by itself, asked for it mixed with grapefruit, it's great!    We ordered the Fruity Tooty and the 10 Star Omelette (bacon, ham, sausages, Frankfurters, bologna, spinach, green onions, tomatoes, onions, red peppers, green peppers, mushroom and Cheddar cheese)."}
{"text":"I've been to Cora's before so check out my other review!!    Cora's is located attached to Sundridge mall near the Starbucks.  I work in the NE so it's pretty close by.  Lunch was coming up, I even brought my own lunch but its Friday and I wasn't feelin' my lunch.  I browsed some Instagram photos and a food photo with some hollandaise popped up and I immediately thought of Coras.  I asked a co-worker if he wanted to join me on my Cora run and he agreed.  We arrived at around 11:45AM and there was a group of 5 in front of us so it wasn't a long wait at all.  They've got a patio but it was blazing hot out so we opted to stay inside.      It's been over a year, maybe two since I have visited, I forgot how cartoony and cute it is inside!  It looks like they've got new items to the menu so that got me excited.  I noticed they've got new pancakes, waffles and other plates but what caught my eye was the breakfast poutine.  I was actually thinking about OEB's breakfast poutine when I saw this but I wanted some meat.  I continued to browse but decided to go with what I normally get which is the Cora Special but I added a side of hollandaise.  Steve went with the 10 Star Omelette.  Our waitress was really friendly and making some jokes here and there.  Food arrived and I had to remind her about my hollandaise sauce and then I got my eggs poached but they were rubbery looking.  I'm not the one to send things back because I feel bad, but I wanted my eggs so I asked for new ones. The fruit was ok, didn't look quite as fresh but still edible.  The food was very mediocre, nothing special.  The ham was a bit dry, but the crepe was nice.  I knew what I was in for though so I didn't expect more than just food to be in my belly.  I do still really enjoy their smooth hollandaise sauce. I can put that s*** on anything! I got a side to dip my potatoes in and it was the best part.   Steve seemed to like his meal but he's been to Coras before so it was the same old.  Our original waitress didn't come by to fill Steve's coffee but some other waitress stopped to top my water.  It's always nice to have that little sweet maple fudge piece they give you after you pay."}
{"text":"Stopped in here for breakfast before work this summer. Nice chain breakfast spot with almost to many options to pick from! I had an omlette and a cup of tea. Will certainly go back if I'm looking for a fast affordable breakfast option. I also loved that quality fruit seemed to accompany every dish they offered."}
{"text":"Found a hair in my omelette, they took my plate away and asked me to get another meal. I was half full already.   They brought me the sausage wrapped in a crepe. I didnt like that at all very bland and taste like cardboard. Expensive  for what it is too, wish i sticked to omelette"}
{"text":"Cora's was around the corner from our hotel, so we decided to try it for brunch for our last in Toronto. Got there around 8:30am, which was smart considering that it filled up quick. By the time we left, the line was at least a dozen people deep.  I had the Sunshine Crepe, which had had ham and egg rolled into a crepe. It was delicious. Plus, there was a plateful of fresh fruit including cantelope, grapes, kiwi, banana, pineapple and plums. A large glass of freshly squeezed OJ really hit the spot.   The restaurant opened out to a small patio. Service was friendly and pretty good. Would go back again."}
{"text":"This is the best Cora's. The staff is so friendly and make us feel like family. The food is very good and is served quickly and hot. We have been to many other Cora's and this one is our absolute favourite."}
{"text":"It's always a good breakfast. Can't ask for much better. Their price range also is pretty competitive with any other breakfast place.   The presentations of their food is always very pretty, and they offer a variety of spreads for your toast that comes with your meal."}
{"text":"I love Cora because the food and service is always great. Today I decided to try for the first time the lunch menu. It was as good as breakfast. Not as many choices but fairly for a breakfast place"}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast - as my cousin called it, it feels like a \"nursery diner\" because of all the colorful decorations on the wall - admittedly, it is quite adorable!  I just got a breakfast platter - 2 eggs, peabacon, and potatoes with cheese and onions. I've never had peabacon until today, so I was surprised to see that it looked like ham! Nonetheless, it was pretty good. The potatoes were delicious too, especially when smothered with the cheese and onions (make sure you ask them to smother it)  All in all, a pretty standard diner. Definitely seems to be family friendly!"}
{"text":"Cora's is a must for a morning after going out.  We stayed at the marriot right at the skydome, and this place is within walking distance.  We went there right at noon on a sunday and we waited outside for nearly 30 minutes, bc everyone knows the breakfast is that good.  At that time i would say most people are from the age range of 20-35, so its a young vibe.  I had the basic breakfast special which i was desperately craving.  My friends ordered eggs benedict with asparagus, strawberry smoothies, and crepes.  They also make a version of french toast but they use cinnamon buns instead of bread, it looked really good."}
{"text":"Not as good as used to b. Very shortage fruits with high price . Very disappointed.  Before they gave full mountains of fruits . But not anymore. For the combo about 15 bucks each . It's quite expensive"}
{"text":"I'll have to agree with the other reviews here.  I was being optimistic when I decided to go to Cora's despite the bad reviews, but I should have listened to the reviews.  Food was pretty mediocre and portions were SMALL.  For a brunch place like that I would expect big quantity, but we all left feeling hungry!  Service was also slow.  There was a long line as expected for a Sunday morning, but when we finally made it to our table we noticed that there were lots of empty tables, but they just hadn't been cleared.  Poor form."}
{"text":"So expensive is one thing, bad is another, this place is both.  We went on a Saturday morning and it was busy enough, we were seated within 5 minutes which was great. Service was on the low end of mediocre, it took quite some time to get our waitress back for refills on water or tea.   I got their breakfast burrito which was incredibly bland and mostly just an egg wrapped in a crepe, the wife got eggs bacon and toast which was fine. Very mediocre, then the bill shows up at it was almost $40 after tip for mediocre food and service.   I won't be going to Cora's again and I don't recommend it unless you love bland food and slow service."}
{"text":"All Cora's are not created equal. This place is always packed and despite the crowds the service levels and the quality of the food remain high. If you are looking for a healthier alternative this place is definitely a good option if you like a breakfast with lots of fresh fruits. I am not really a fan of the American style breakfasts here, and would recommend the waffles, pancakes and crepes over the bacon, sausage, and ham items on their menu. If you are craving bacon and eggs this is not the place for you..."}
{"text":"Not all franchise restaurants are run with the same standards. I am actually a fan of Cora's I have had breakfast at several locations but the Queensway location just didn't cut it for me. I had the Coras Breakfast Special which came with ham, sausage, bacon, two eggs, toast and a pancake. The ham and sausage were greasy and did not compliment the meal at all. The bacon and eggs were fine and the rye toast was ok. This meal definitely didn't have the wow factor. This place was packed though, so obviously they are doing something right here."}
{"text":"On any list of K&G's favorite places to eat, Cora's would be quite high-ranking (especially thanks to K's constant raves and craves for it). I first experienced Cora's in Ottawa on a group trip back in 2004 (in itself a story for another day), and tried the Rosemary's Sunday: eggs, bacon, and two blueberry pancakes. I've had it since then and it is just as good as memory serves.  I went through a phrase where I would get the Bobby Button, an enormous omelete in a crepe platter that never leaves you hungry. Recently, I think the best meal there - certainly our mutual favorite - is the Eggs Ben & Dictine. Kat prefers the ham, I like the brie and mushroom variety. It is always a savory and satisfying meal: the roast potatoes, the generous dollop of hollandaise, and of course the fresh fruit. I usually get a double dose of fruit thanks to Kat, and it goes a long way to help digest. Washed down with a cup of coffee, and you're set for the day!  Cora's does pride itself in their sweet crepes. There is a wide variety of fruit and spread combinations, but I tend to steer away from them: for me, they are much too big for dessert, and not fulfilling enough to be a meal. Add in the fact that Cora's is closed for business at 3 pm, and it eliminates the option of a late-night snack. The location itself is a bit of a hassle: the shopping complex is a notorious traffic trap, and is a considerable drive away. But still, you can either go to Denny's, or get some real food here."}
{"text":"I come for lunch once in a wile. Coras is always pretty good breakfeast food. The service is pretty good and the food is satisfying."}
{"text":"When visiting Toronto, I told my friends I wanted the best breakfast they had around.   Instead I had to settle for Cora's. A Canadian breakfast chain.    What makes Cora's special? Not much.   Is it bad? No, but it's not very memorable either.   Disappointing really because we waited on line for over an hour.    Everything comes out with tons of fruit which is pleasant but I don't eat the most important meal of the day to be healthy. I want to load up on unhealthy sugars and carbs to power me through the day and eat less of them as the day continues.   In the end Cora's is an A-OK, run of the mill breakfast stop, which offers a little more but isn't worth it if there is a long line."}
{"text":"I had a terrible experience here, please never come here especially if you're coming with a large party.   So the situation was like this - we called beforehand to book a table, because 16 of us were coming. They told us that our table would be ready by the time we arrive. After we did, we were told to wait for awhile, which was understandable. So we waited for 10 minutes, then 20 minutes. But EVEN after waiting for half an hour, it wasn't ready yet. After waiting for a whole hour, they only then told us that they were cleaning up the tables for us. Note this was only after an hour when they said that the table would be ready for us by the time we arrived. In the end we had to remind the server again about our table and THEN they only seated us. The service here is horrible compared to the Cora in Vancouver and I'm never coming back here again."}
{"text":"Awful, awful, awful! I will never go back!  I still don't get what all the rave is about with Cora's. There are TONS of other cool, funky one-off brunch places (with amazing food) to check out in the city, so why resort to a chain restaurant that perpetually has a lineup, and is super tacky on the inside? Can you guess that I am not a fan? :-) Usually I would never write a review so awful (I'm one to usually see the positive side of things), but I feel like this place deserves it. It is definitely not a foodie kind of place.. it's good if you appreciate food like Denny's in the 'burbs.. but it's definitely not a memorable brunch spot for downtown T.O. by any means..   We were here years ago and I am still holding a grudge. First off, the service was terrible. We arrived and waited about 25 mins for the server to take our order (it wasn't even busy). We could see beyond this, as sometimes there are disconnects. The waitress took our order, and table after table started filtering in after we ordered. We waited.. and waited.. and waited... the tables that had arrived even 30 minutes after us were already getting their orders, and we still hadn't. The waitress kept coming over to the table to let us know it would only be 2 more minutes for our food to come... she came over and told us this on 3 different occasions.. again, we waited, patiently... she finally came over, an hour and a half after us arriving and just having coffee, that she  had lost our order and wanted to find out what we had ordered.. . Really? Could she have not told us this, um, maybe an hour before.. ? I'm sure she was aware that our order was forgotten, so she could have manned up to save herself the embarassment (did she honestly think we'd forgotten our food and would just leave without calling her on it?!). To say the least, I was highly disappointed with the incompetent waitstaff and the food. When our eggs finally arrived, they were completely unextraordinary and weren't anything to bat an eyelash at.   There were no apologies and they didn't offer to comp our meals. She offered us an additional cup of coffee or a juice, and suggested that we order as that would be free. We asked if our food would be comp'd and she said no, it would only be a coffee or juice. We passed on her \"comp\" that was almost a slap in the face for making us wait so long. I will never go back here. There is nothing about this place that is worth it. So many more gems in the city to dine at, why bother with this highly commercial chain restaurant, with horrible service to boot."}
{"text":"Worst breakfast food! Incredibly bland and mediocre - in a city full of amazing brunch options, please do yourself a favour and avoid Cora's."}
{"text":"Probably the only breakfast place really close to my condo. I've been to a few other Cora's locations but this was my first time at this one. Usually the line ups deter me. Be prepared to wait 15-30 mins to get in on the weekends because it's always packed here, lots of tourists in the area.  The menu is fun, food is just GOOD but not great. Portions are big but it doesn't have a lot of love in the cooking, it's just sort of mass-produced big plates. The fruit salads are awesome though.   Service was just OK here, the place is packed and they seemingly had only 4 servers. Ours was a bit scatterbrained but she got the job done."}
{"text":"We where taken here by a friend while in town, he was quite happy about the place and had been several times. The food was standard for most Cora's I have been to, and maybe they are having the standard new opened and training issues going on. However our server was just not there, he handed out menus took very long to come back for the orders, and seem always very distracted. I do not know if I will go back I know it is a bad thing to say and judge a company on one person, but I am looking for something different for breakfast, and this was not it, and the server just made the experience less then desirable."}
{"text":"cora's doesn't really need my review, but i gotta say, i just love that damn eggs benedict with brie and mushroom.   sometimes it comes out only lukewarm, sure, but it's still delicious.   sometimes i have to wait thirty minutes in line and at my table to get it, but i still think it's worth it.   yes, there are probably better brunch places out there, but there's always better everything out there. when has that ever stopped me?  ...and it's across the street from my house, so i can roll right out of bed and into cora's to put eggs benny in my face.   honorable mention: nutella and banana crepe. always want it, rarely get it because the lure of the eggs et benedictine is just too strong."}
{"text":"This is probably the best and healthiest tasting breakfast establishment I have ever been to.  There is always a wait, but it doesn't last long.  Every dish is served with plenty of fresh fruit.  A must try are the eggs benedict with asparagus.  If you are ever in Toronto this is a must stop."}
{"text":"Uhm yum!!!! Ordered the strawberry waffles to share with 3 people, a crepe omelette, poached eggs with toast and fruit, and their special made juice of the day. Emma was friendly and great on service. Portions were big for the price. Will be back when we are visiting Toronto!"}
{"text":"As a former Montrealer, I've eaten at the original St-Laurent location of Cora's before, not to mention some of the other outlets.  Basically, my friends find it the be all and end all of breakfast places, and in all honesty, I just don't find the appeal.  I've found the breakfast usually made competantly, but no more than say, a Denny's or a Phil's.  Having a fruit allergy, I find the moutains of fruit decorations to be not only excessive, but a trendy attempt to be fancy.... and fails at that.  Still, the Construction breakfast is decent, and I do admit that the crepes are better than the norm.  I also find it to be a bit pricey, but then, I guess if you're a big fruit eater, it's worth it."}
{"text":"I have loved cora's since it first came to Calgary. The Bobby Button is my fav dish, there is a line if you're not there early enough. But well worth the wait if you stick around"}
{"text":"Look, the food is everything you expect.  It's good, well-prepared, presented. Some could say it is a bit pricey but you get what you pay for.  So why did I give one star?    First, breakfast = coffee.  Fast!  It should come first.  It should be automatic.  It took ten minutes just to order and almost another ten before it came.    Second, delivery.  In the time it took us to finally order, I watched another patron (with his hat on but at least facing forward) come in after us.  Got his coffee before we even had a chance to order some ourselves.  Got his breakfast and finished it before we even got ours!  It seemed just about the whole workforce was on automatic and unfortunately we had been left out of the programming!  It appeared there was an element of \"tension\" in the workplace, just under the surface!  Cora, you got a good product!  Maybe it's the staff you want to watch!"}
{"text":"Solid breakfast spot. Lots of healthy options and menu is fun. Kid friendly. Quick service."}
{"text":"I ordered the Salmon & Eggs Ben, it came with a side of potatoes and A LOT of fruit! Boy was I full! Mango and banana smoothie to top it off, I probably didn't need it because there was so much fruit to start with. I didn't love the Hollandaise sauce, it was OK - meal wasn't spectacular but it did the job for a reasonable price. Nice convenient place to go from home, staff were very friendly, I'll have to try another item on the menu next time."}
{"text":"Very average and noting special. Ordered a side of bacon and it was paper thin. Wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"This is my go to spot for good wholesome breakfast.  Went here today for mothers day brunch.  Well it wasnt really brunch, more like breakfast cause we knew it was gonna be packed around 10am.  There is something about going to Coras that is very inviting and just feels like home.  Most servers are very friendly and attentive.  Food usually comes quick, with exception today cause of mothers day.  Coras also offers more selections of breakfast items compared to other breakfast joints.  Value of food is also on par, you get a generous amount of food plus fruits in all their dishes.  So if you have one of those days where just too lazy to cook breakfast, head over to Coras for some good food!"}
{"text":"All Breakfasts come with consistency all the times I've been there. But the service is always pleasant even when it's extremely busy. This is our weekly go to on Sundays!"}
{"text":"I am not a giant fan of Cora's to begin with and my experience with this location did very little to sway my initial feelings.  *SLOW service! Took 20 minutes to get the bill, she didn't come over to give us any coffee refills or check up on us.  *No whole wheat bread; this would have been ok if it weren't for the 20 minute wait for this basket. The waitress came over with white bread and asked annoyingly if this was the end of the world.  My meal was the same mediocre Cora food I remembered from hung over mornings in Montreal... nothing much to brag about. The Blue Jay Way location is way better, but if you ask me, skip Cora all together."}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast place in Toronto. We eat here every breakfast that we eat when in Toronto. It is not your average breakfast. Many different and interesting things on the menu. The food is great. Everyone is so friendly. It is a popular place so you might wait on line especially in the nice weather. The line usually moves quickly. It is a definite must go to."}
{"text":"I've been to several Cora's before, I find this location is quite consistent. You don't have to wait too long after ordering your food, fruits are freshly cut, everything came out hot and toasty. Beware of long line ups during weekends though. Although there's so many tables available, turn over rates are SLOWW.. Servers all look like their taking their sweet time while there's 9999 people waiting in line."}
{"text":"We received the worst experience today at this location and we are not coming back again, despite this place used to be our go to place for brunch.   My husband, my 6 years old daughter and I arrived the restaurant around 145pm today, and while we were waited to be seating, the hostess spoke to us in a rude and loud voice, \" you need to wait behind the door, you cannot block the entrance.\" No smile, like we were criminals. I said to her, but it's very cold and you have plenty of tables. She pushed the door open, said \"you need to wait behind the door.\" no smile and made the face like you are so not welcome in here. The couple behind us had a stroller and they have a baby inside, I felt bad for them because it was minus today in Toronto. It is very cold to wait behind the door. Another group of people heard the conversation and left immediately. After she directed us to our seat, she dropped the menus and Walked away, without any eye contact or saying anything to us. I looked at the seat, there's a wet table clothes left on the seat. I grabbed her attention and showed her the wet table clothes on the seat, she grabbed it and walked away. Without a word to us again. My husband was extremely unpleasant at this point and asked us to leave. I told him we had already pay for the parking and just wanted to grab a brunch and go. Spoke to the manager about the whole experience, indicated her behaviour was very unseen of and unprofessional, her service was inconsistent, because everyone that coming in after us, they are all waiting inside the door and she did not pushed them out like what she did to us. The manager offered us a discount towards the bill, she never show up and say anything to us. We visited this restaurant regularly, at least once a month because my daughter likes the kids meal here. We have never experienced anything like this before and are never going back again"}
{"text":"We have found that the service at this Cora's if fine. We are usually seated right away and our orders are taken pretty quick as well. Sometimes there is a long wait, but then again, we're used to it as there is almost always a line up.  Our last visit we ordered savoury crepe (with eggs, bacon, and sausage) and a usually big breakfast (toast, hash, bacon, sausage, eggs - totally don't remember the names of both dishes, so please refer to the pictures).  Everything tastes fine, nothing really crazy amazing, but that's normal with all Cora's/chain breakfast restaurants. There were a couple of visits that we had where our server forgot to refill our coffees and we had to ask another server to help us out.   So, overall this Cora's isn't too bad, but will probably take the extra time to drive to another breakfast restaurant that has better food and better service."}
{"text":"I have never really understood the hype over Cora's in general. The food is not bad, but I feel like it is overpriced, especially considering you can get similar (if not even better) breakfast food at cheaper prices. Had to line up in the cold for a while this morning, although the wait might have been due in part to the large number of CN Tower Climb/Scotiabank Marathon participants in the downtown area today.  I ordered a smoked salmon Eggs Ben et Dictine (eggs benedict) with just one egg, which was about $11+ dollars. My dish also came with a large amount of fruit (part of a banana, one strawberry, a slice of honeydew, a piece of orange, and some apple slices.) I would recommend getting two eggs since it's only about $2 more. I like that you have can customize the way your egg is cooked: either soft, medium or hard. However, while the dish was okay overall, I thought the smoked salmon was especially bland and not salty enough. My friend who ordered the salmon and lox bagel also agreed.  Unfortunately there are not many other breakfast/brunch places in the immediate vicinity, but if you are willing to venture a little bit further north (around Queen Street) you can find much better options. Cora's will always do fine, but to me it just seems overpriced and over commercialized."}
{"text":"The owner has since contacted me for further information on our experience. A promise to address a staffing issue and an apology I feel she truly cared.  Good management goes a long way.  I will go back to Coras once again for another chance!"}
{"text":"Chez Cora has a great name, and a great franchise. Unfortunately, with franchises the quality can start to decrease. In my opinion, this is what has happened to Chez Cora. I've been to many Chez Cora's in my life, for the most part they are all the same with the exception of how long or how short the food is cooked for. I really used to enjoy Chez Coras, but now every time I go I am always disappointed. If you are in the mood for a breakfast that is pretty decent, with a lot of different choices, then definitely give it a try. If you are very critical of food, and really enjoy eating great food, don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"I love Cora's! I've been to the Scarborough and Pickering location. Both Cora's have great staff and service, everyone is friendly and they walk around filling up coffee.   The menu has a great selection of eggs, crepes, french toast and on the lighter side of breakfast - bowls of oatmeal and fresh fruit.  My favourite is called \"Seventh of July\" which includes crepes and toast fruit. Every menu item comes packed with fresh fruit. Its really yummy and filling.   Everything is clean and the chairs are comfortable. It's a great place for groups and kids too. I will be coming back to Cora's!"}
{"text":"Being a lover of breakfast food, I wanted so much to like this place, given Cora's story and the promising menu.  After 5 visits, I just couldn't get past the long wait for food, the rock-hard under-ripe fruit garnishes (it's amazing how the fruit manages to be inedible just about every time of the year there!) and the prices, which are on the high side for quality.  Go for the crepe-based dishes as the classic breakfasts disappoint. The strawberry waffles are also consistently good."}
{"text":"Does the trick if you're looking for a decent place to get breakfast when hungover. Don't expect anything special. They seat you as you come in so sometimes the line gets backed up but it moves quick. I'd come here again but it wouldn't be the first choice. Or even the fifth.."}
{"text":"If you look up \"BOMB DIGGITY DIGGITY DO\" in the dictionary you will get a one word noun.  And that noun is CORA.  Saturday mornings at Cora's have become a suburbanite's treat.  Everyone downtown gets their fancy shmancy hipster stylin profilin \"so hot right now\" diners, but what do we get in the south?  Nudding.    Cora's is amazing, if you get there before noon you'll be sure to get in rather quickly.  Be aware though for you late sleeper inners, you may have to wait.  The service here has always been amazing, and the food is consistently fresh and delicious.  Coffee refills are ample (A LITTLE TOO AMPLE WEEEEEEEE), and the food comes out quickly.    After you pay the bill you can eat their delicious maple fudge.  What is more canadian and breakfasty than maple fudge?  Nothing.  Doot doodle doot doot!"}
{"text":"Good prices and the Spinach & Cheddar Omelette rocked. Guess we were there at the right time as we had no wait and service was great too."}
{"text":"Wanted some breakfast and found this place close to our hostel.  The place was very busy when we got there but we didn't have to wait long to be seated.  Quickly we were served our drinks, the food took a little longer to get to us but it was worth it! The prices were a little high but you got a ton of portion.  You can definitely share with someone and get a side to share.  The service was great other than the wait for food and our tickets but we were able to get out quick.  This was also a first time I used a credit card machine in Canada.  It was amazing to use and nicer that the waiter didn't have to walk away with my card and I was able to put my tip into this machine.  Definitely will visit again."}
{"text":"OMG!!! Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. People friendly and nice. Food out of this would. Atmosphere windows open and the weather nice. I wish I had a place this nice by me."}
{"text":"Right when you walk in you are automatically put into a good mood because I love the layout it's so customer and family friendly! Their Benedict's are delicious and I always ask them for extra crispy potatoes which they never hesitate to do. Definitely a great place to take your kids, friends or family!"}
{"text":"This was a great meal! The wait staff was friendly and attentive and the food was innovative and very yummy. I had the eggs Benedict with salmon. The fruit tasted fresh as well and coffee was always being filled. You will also get what you pay for since the portion sizes will fill you up. Overall, Cora's is a very innovative and tasty place to eat!"}
{"text":"I've always enjoyed breakfast at Cora's. It's a good excuse to eat healthier since my plate will be loaded with my favourite fruits like kiwi, pineapple, strawberries, bananas etc. I ordered the panini crepes with egg and ham. While eating the other half of the panini, I was pulling crusty burnt eggs. I told the server and she agreed that the egg was burned. She took it inside and a new one was prepared. The manager himself brought it to my table. He said the kitchen will be careful next time. I'd been to this restaurant in different locations and always enjoyed the food. I could have given low stars but since I have been a repeat customer of Cora, I will not this time."}
{"text":"I've just joined Cora's Enthusiast's Club, and boy do I feel great. No really. It's an actual thing. A club for people who love Cora's. Who doesn't love fan clubs? Exclusive sneak peeks that involve brunchy foods AND a fun newsletter to keep me entertained, hell yes!  Went back to Cora's this weekend and nearly committed the cardinal sin of Showing Up For Toronto Brunch After 11am - trust me when I say you do not want to do this. Also, it's generally a good idea to avoid Cora's when the Jays are playing the Yankees or the Red Sox as there will be scads of hungry Americans lining up out the door, and they will fight you for a fruit platter.  My second favourite server, Flip (her actual name - ask her the story behind it. It's a good one!) was bubbly and smiling as always. She is just always in a good mood, even if she's pumping out brunch orders at a feverish pace and zipping around the restaurant like a steroid-sated athlete.   This particular visit gave me the best of both worlds in terms of service - because not only did we have Flip as our server, but Jason (aka Dutch/Guyanese dreamboat) was also serving our section, and let me tell you how pleased I was to get more than an adequate glimpse of him while mowing down on my brunch."}
{"text":"Went and had breakfast at Cora's earlier this week.  Ordered a mango/banana smoothie and your typical eggs with peameal bacon. It came with some fruit on the side, potatoes and some toast.  The Good  - the smoothie was excellent - the eggs and bacon were fine - no complaints - service was good - nice little patio on not too busy street but extra bonus is that the big front windows open up so even though we sat inside, it felt nice and airy  The Bad  - the fruit consisted of a slice of cantaloupe and a piece of pineapple. The cantaloupe was raw - it felt like biting into a carrot. Carrots crunch - cantaloupes should not crunch. The piece of pineapple looked pathetic. I was at The Host a few days ago. They have a plate of fresh cut pineapple in the lunch buffet. That pineapple looked fresh. It was like The Host went to the Dole plantation and handpicked their best pineapples during peak season. The slice I got at Cora's was probably from the last pineapple left at the end of the season that no one else wanted.  I'd go back. I can overlook the fruit. Everything else was fine. Especially the smoothie - it was great!"}
{"text":"Came here for thanksgiving brunch with a group of 8, called a few times to get through to a real person to place a reservation two hours in advance and they had our table ready for us within minutes of arriving at 12:30.   Exactly what you'd expect. Not any more special than other chain breakfast/brunch places but the food was good without getting too pricey. Service was pretty good as well, despite the restaurant being full to the brim, and we were surprised by the fact that they didn't throw a mandatory tip on our 8-person bill.   The omelettes are good - I ordered the small version of pancakes with strawberry sauce (got 2 pancakes) and I thought I would get whipped cream in my little jug, but got a (no sugar?) vanilla yogurt instead, which didn't taste that great and I ended up scraping off my pancakes. The strawberry sauce also just seemed to be a warmed up jam, but wasn't too bad. The pancakes may have been a little overpriced for these reasons (small version was $9.99), but I tried my sister's breakfast burrito plate, as well as my aunt's omelette dish, which were both delicious!"}
{"text":"I work near this location so I have frequently popped by for breakfast but I am sad to say that I will never be returning here.   My mom and I stopped by around 8am on a weekend prior to the usual rush. Despite the restaurant being empty it took a very long time for us to get seated (we almost left). Once the host acknowledged our presence he took us and sat us at a table next to the window. As soon as I got in the area I felt a draft coming from the window and it was a terribly cold morning. Since the restaurant was empty, I asked the host if we could sit elsewhere. He accommodated and moved us to a more centrally located table.   As soon as we sat down, a lady who I presume would have been our waitress had we sat at the original table came by and THREW the menus onto our table. One of the menus literally was flung into my mom and the other slid across the table. There is absolutely no exaggeration - she threw the menus.   I was so shocked and was going to speak with a manager but my mom was about to catch a flight out of town and wanted to get in/out as fast as possible.   We will not be returning. Note to management - please place some importance on properly training your staff and hire people with manners."}
{"text":"We got to Toronto a little early from Cincinnati and couldn't check-in yet at our hotel.  So we asked for a recommendation for a brunch place while we waited and ended up at Cora's.  My son had a Big and Delicious Crepe which was basically crepes laced with bacon and fruits, my wife had a 10 star omelette and I had the brioche french toast. They were busy however they were efficient and got us our food in good time.   It was certainly a change from our usual Midwest breakfasts at Bob Evan's or Tuesday Morning restaurants.   The servings were huge, and the food was delicious.  My wife and myself sampled each other's food, like we always do, and we seemed have the same verdict.  It was a good breakfast however i still would not give them more than a 3 star rating. It was just breakfast guys!. If we were Toronto residents we most likely would frequent Cora's like we do Bob Evan's in Cincy (where we have a family breakfast at least 3 times a month and would also probably give them 3 stars, too)."}
{"text":"Cora's Breakfast & Lunch (formally Chez Cora) is such a fun place.  Our first real day in Toronto started at Cora's.  From what I briefly saw of the inside I really enjoyed it.  Bright colors and fun painted pictures were all over the walls and adorable suns were everywhere.  The decor was childlike, but not in a bad way at all.  We sat outside, and it was a great way to people watch.  I only had a regular coffee, and I was surprised when I actually enjoyed it! I took a sip of Joe's Strawberry/Banana smoothie and it was delicious and fresh.  For my meal I got the Rosemary's Sunday which consisted of 2 eggs (I got them over-easy), bacon, homefries, toast, fruit and 2 blueberry crepes.  The eggs were runny, but oddly not in a bad way.  They were cooked perfectly, and the fact that they were a little runny made them even more fantastic.  The blueberry crepes were closer to the pancake side, since they were much thicker than traditional crepes, however they were still tasty.  Homefries were not overly seasoned, which was a plus.  I really REALLY enjoyed the fruit salad, because there were hardly ANY melons in it!! Strawberries, oranges, apples! I loved it.  They have a lot of different offerings here, from crepes to waffles, to fruit plates and eggs.  I would come back in a second to Cora's, because not only is it fresh and delicious, but extremely reasonably priced ($29.05 without tip).    You have to pay up at the cashier and I thought it was really cool that you added the tip directly on the screen where you're card gets swiped (saving trees!) If you haven't already gone to Cora's get your butt down there!"}
{"text":"Good heart omelette only for a limited time. So going to try it out, and it's awesome.  Not only that, considering that the place was practically packed, the service was impecable.  I think this is different than the other Cora locations because the others didn't have a service this efficient, I didn't even have to ask for the refill for the coffee, they notice it when it is done and ask.  As for the meal, I decided to forgo the menu and just order the thing that was on display in my place mat, which was the Good Heart Omelette for $9.95 + taxes and tip with coffee goes to about $16.  It was an interesting mix, but it came out so well.  It had a savoury portion which is composed of an egg white omelette with spinach and cottage cheese.  Never had cottage cheese in an omelette before let alone an all egg white omelette, or even spinach with the omelette, but that combination was awesome.  On the other half of the plate was a bunch of fruits.  I was a bit turned off when I saw the kiwi at first, but I was surprised how sweet the kiwi was and it wasn't \"biting\" like the stuff I get from Foody Mart.  It had other fruits like grapes, pineapple and strawberry.  It also came with toast, I ordered brown just to be in between white and whole wheat.  It was pre-buttered and they provided me with a choice of jams.  I used the Strawberry and Blueberry. Normally I just stick with Strawberry, but their blueberry jam tasted better.  It was less sugary.  The only problem with the blueberry is it is runnier than the other jams so you have to keep the bread close otherwise you'd make a mess (like I did).  In the end I didn't feel excessively full, which is the way I like it.  The food was just in the right amount for me.  However, I didn't want to push it by getting my usual desserts there.  I'll probably go again (though to another branch since this is out of my way) sometime this week."}
{"text":"5 stars for your service.  Great place. Great food and awesome staff.  Wow Yelp review are so great.  Going Back Forsure :)))"}
{"text":"I wasn't the biggest fan of cora's when we came here for mothers day, because of the previous sentence though you can understand how it was not my choice to come here.  we arrived to a line up inside the restaurant and outside had 5 people standing in line. I'd say within about 15 minutes, we were in and served which was beautiful given that line up. the food has been drastically improved and upgraded since I last went to a cora's (five years ago and in a different town all together) the service was really good at this location as everyone who was here was not wasting a single minute on this day. the food was very hot and full of fresh ingredients, I was thoroughly impressed.  parking was a bit frantic at this location, not for a lack of parking, but close to the restaurant was slammed full of cars, on a normal day I can this parking lot being easy to navigate.  transit options are the 80 Queensway, and the 44 kipling with a 10 minute walk.  definitely worth coming and checking out."}
{"text":"To be fair, this is a 3.5 stars for me.   Interesting variety of breakfast choices. I wish I could try them all. I just had the Thoe's omelette (veggie) with egg-whites, a bagel, coffee, fruit, and potatoes. All good, but seemed a bit heavy on the use of oil. For some reason I really enjoyed the bagel. Doughy and toasted with sesame and blueberry jam. L  Busy place. I was in a line that went out the door where it was 37 degrees F. I figured it was worth it, but then again, I'm with Canadians!  I'll come back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"We just move into this area , so we are searching for new good cheap place to eat.  Before I came in , I saw one of the review said that the Waitress are untrained.  Hahaha !! ! U walk into the here , you see 5 waiter and waitress standing behind the bar looking at you , judging at you , chatting with each other to see who wanna go serve you for 5 mins.  Then they come and say \" I'm not your server \"   Super Untrained Service !   But the food will make me come back again for sure . The price isn't too bad either!   Spinach and Chedder Crepomlette  :)) ! The fresh fruit cup on the side is very cute ! And the quality of fruit is not bad either ~  Good luck with the  service !"}
{"text":"I love CORA, this is one of the breakfast establishment that I really like. since it is the first one in calgary in the N.E. its really busy.   if you want to go, gotta go early or else it will be kinda long wait. the difference with this breakfast is that...they add fruit. which you dont normally see now a days.  the service is awesome, very friendly. i would recommend for health buffs to go, even if you are not, just try it out. they also have another location in okotoks, so for those who live southern part of calgary.  LOVE IT!"}
