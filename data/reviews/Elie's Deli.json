{"text":"sitting in elie's right now and i have nothing but good things to say. the food is delicious, the owners are friendly, your order comes out FAST (i got my hummus and falafel pita within minutes of ordering--i barely had time to sit down!).  this is a little hole in the wall deli off 44th and thomas but well worth a visit. i haven't tried the famed gyro yet but i'm looking forward to it!"}
{"text":"It's a shame they have to close. This was the best place to eat in the area by far. What's troubling is that the mediocre, uninspiring chain restaurants across the street are swarmed with customers. The owners/workers of this place were some of the most courteous I've ever witnessed. I hope they are retiring in peace somewhere."}
{"text":"very sad to say that after 15 yrs, elie's is now closed for good. they were sweet people who served good food. i hope they are okay, and just retiring after working so hard for so long. thank you for all the years you were open."}
{"text":"Everything is made fresh as you order it (takes a little longer when busy) -- but man, this place is awesome.  So far I've had the chicken kabob and the gyro- both excellent.  When they have the homemade baklava, it is AWESOME.  Oh-- they also now have an ATM, so don't worry about going with no cash in your pocket!!!"}
{"text":"Wow -- what a find!  We thoroughly enjoyed our leisurely Saturday lunch at Elie's.  The food was delicious and filling, and he owner / chef was friendly and nice to talk to.  We had the chicken gyro with feta and the classic beef gyro.  The roasted veggies on the gyros added flavor and nutritional content.  The pitas were extremely soft and fluffy.  You must try the hummus -- it's homemade and fresh with a bit of lemony taste to it."}
{"text":"I don't review all that often on Yelp and today I was reading my old reviews.  My first review of Elie's Deli was a bit harsh, though in my humble opinion their grilled chicken salad isn't their best dish.  However, after trying their amazing hummus and their baclava I became a HUGE fan, as well as the owners who were so nice and remembered me and my friends, Elie's became a weekly must-have for our office.    I completely agree with Tabitha's comment, this was the saddest day of the year when Elie's Deli closed its doors.  I honestly almost cried."}
{"text":"Saddest day of the year... Eli's Deli has closed their doors for good. The sign on the door reads:   \"Dear Customers,  After 15 years we are closing our doors. We have loved being a part of your life. Thank you for your support all these years.    - Thank you, The Owners\"   I will miss this place and the sweet people who ran it. God bless."}
{"text":"I'm divided.    I don't really like the way the place looks.  I am the last one to complain that decor is old and outdated, because I like un self-conscious outdatedness.  Unfortunately, it looked dirty, and by dirty I mean dusty and unscrubbed.  I began to wonder if they kept the kitchen as clean as the dining room.   The wait was interminable, or seemed so because of the creep sitting next to me who wouldn't stop talking about \"the aliens\".  In all actuality, I was probably there for about twenty minutes, having gotten there about 11:15 am.  Another note about the dining room is the kitchen obviously has insufficient smoke ventilation.  As I waited, my eyes began to sting, and the haze in the room was visible in the sunlight.  No dine-in for me.  When looking at the menu, I thought the prices seemed slightly high.  Once I got my food, I felt that the prices were fair due to portion size.  I got the baba ganoush and grape leaves.  The grape leaves were awesome.  The baba ganoush was interesting, with a consistency that looked like hummus.  Totally creamy, no evidence of seeds.  It was dosed with so much liquid smoke that it kind of tastes like barbecue sauce.  Good at first, kind of sickening after half of it is gone.  I wouldn't get it again.  I need to try this place one more time and see if my experience is comparable.  If it is, I doubt I will be back."}
{"text":"This is a small place that clearly show the love of the owners.  I found it to be spotlessly clean despite having older furnishing and decor and the food is made one order at a time.  That means it's a dollar or two more than the chain places like Shlotskys and Subway that're on the other side of Thomas Road, but the quality of the ingredients is like, 200% better.  Next time I need a fix of good Greek / Eastern mediteranean food I will be back for sure. Their tzatziki is just perfect - cooling, yet hot at the same time from generous amounts of garlic.  They do commercial catering too, so if you're looking for a office lunch that's different, definitely give them a try.  And don't forget CASH ONLY means no debit cards! BTW That's a shout out for the dude who came in behind me who said \"what, not even debit cards?\""}
{"text":"REAL CUSTOMER SERVICE AND GREAT FOOD.  The woman that takes the orders and serves is always there and she is GREAT!  The gyros, hummus, and salads have been fresh, consistently good and prompt.  The decor is dated, but C'mon I'm in there too eat.  The woman has remembered me and my wife despite a number of weeks between visits.  This place is very refreshing in an era of dying customer service.  Don't judge a book by it's cover because you'll miss out on this gem."}
{"text":"Yowza....  Food so good you'll slap yer Momma!  I've driven by this place a gazillion times, and I've been wanting to try it.  I hadn't quite sated my need for Mediterranean food, so I decided to get some take-home.    I'm *trying* to be sort of careful about what I eat and making sure I get more veggies, blah blah blah.  So I got the mixed meat salad -- because I still needed some gyro meat.  All I can say is WOW.  The veggies were fresh and crunchy, the chicken was great -- marinated and really tender.  And, FINALLY, gyro meat that dreams are made of!  Perfectly seasoned, and just freakin good!  I chose the house dressing -- garlic, lemon, and olive oil -- and it was a great choice -- it was awesome.  This big ass salad comes with pita bread, but I'd get an extra, so you can sop up whatever dressing is left.    The service was lovely as well.  The sister of the owner was working this evening, and was so friendly.    I will definitely be coming back.  I can't wait to try more!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good. It's not great. It may be slightly overpriced for some... BUT  they don't get discounts for buying in bulk like the chains and the owners are good people trying to make an honest living.   It's local, family run business and the service is awesome. The owner greets you with a huge contagious smile when you walk in & she is always super friendly.  AND YES -- DON'T FORGET: it's CASH ONLY!  I wish the Valley had more places like this."}
{"text":"Love this place! Great Mediterranean salads and dolmas. Friendly customer service and very family oriented"}
{"text":"Right in my neighborhood, and I finally tried this little gem of a place!  My gyro was fresh, flavorful, tasty - worth $.75 to add the feta.  Service was good.  I'll definitely be back for more.  It's simple and small, great for lunch."}
{"text":"I rate restaurants based on the food, not the decor.  Based on the food, this place deserves a solid 5 star review.  Elie's is clean, but very small - just a few tables.  I always get my food to go, so the decor or worrying if there will be an empty table is never an issue.  I have ordered almost every ethnic item on the menu.  I haven't tried the deli sandwiches or the hamburgers, although I am tempted.  I come to Elie's for one thing only - fantastic Mediterranean food, and I am never disappointed.   I live nearby, and I have been eating here for years.  I stopped eating here a while back when they had a price hike, but I recently rediscovered Elie's when I had a craving for hummus.  I have been returning every few weeks to reacquaint myself with their Middle-Eastern offerings.  I am always pleased with my meal, and I have not found anything that I wouldn't order again.  Tonight, I had the vegetarian platter (hummus, tabouli, baba ganoush, grape leaves, and felafel), a side of grilled chicken, and a side of gyro meat.  This was more than enough food for 2 of us.  It came to less than $10 per person.  There were a total of 7 different dishes in our order, and everything was fresh and absolutely delicious.  The grilled chicken was really good, but the gyro meat was out of this world.  The offerings on the vegetarian platter were all delectable.  You have to wait for the food, so don't expect your order to show up 2 minutes after you order it.  I would highly recommend picking up one of their to go menus, and ordering in advance so that it is ready when you arrive.  Elie's is not the least expensive place on the block, but as other reviewers have commented, the quality of the food justifies being a little pricier than your typical strip mall eatery.  Even though it is a little pricey, it should not be considered expensive by any stretch of the imagination.   Don't let the appearance of the place fool you.  This is not a dicey strip mall dive.  This is a quality restaurant, with attentive and gracious owners.  The Mediterranean food is wonderful.  Maybe, I will update my review later after I try one of their sandwiches or hamburgers, but most likely, I will be too tempted to stick with what they do best - delicious Mediterranean cuisine."}
{"text":"Great lil mom and pop joint had the chicken gyro and salad. Salad was fresh and crisp gyro was tasty"}
{"text":"Awesome food! I dream about the falafel from here. I have tried Pita Jungle and many other places, even resorting to making my own but it is never the same as Elie's. Elie is so warm and inviting as she serves you herself. Prices are a little high but so is the quality. The fries are fresh and so is the meat. The pitas are so soft and fresh, very hard to find pitas such as these. I remember I passed out once here, I don't know if it was from a serious disorder or from me being in so much ecstasy from the food! Remember to bring cash, that is their only drawback."}
{"text":"If you don't hear about this place you'd probably never stop here. The food is great, I especially love the Gyros Feta Salad. It's truly a hole in the wall, not fancy, but don't let appearances fool you! This place has won rave reviews from The Arizona Republic and New Times. If you're looking for some of the best mediterranean food this is THE place to go."}
{"text":"I pass this place all the time, and decided to stop in today. Glad I did! I got the classic gyro with fries, and it was one of the best I've had.   The service is very friendly, and they are attentive. You could tell the ingredients are high quality, and my food was very fresh.   The establishment was very clean, with friendly service and good food. You should check it out!"}
{"text":"Clean inside and clean kitchen. Nice staff and super good food. The chicken pita was good, not great but the salad was super good. I even liked that it had no feta.   The burger I had tried another time was SUPER good. Taste just like you made t at home but without having to mess up your kitchen. ;)   The hours are a little annoying because but that just means they take pride in their food when it is open.  I would definitely recommend everyone go give them a try."}
{"text":"Strip mall mediterranean. Unbelievably clean place with unbelievably sweet owners. The chicken gyros, falafel, and baba ganouj are excellent. Great for take-out."}
{"text":"Tired of big chain restaurants while visiting Phoenix for an annual conference, I trusted reviews on Yelp and found my way to Elie's Deli. I am eternally grateful that I did. This little unassuming small shop might serve the best gyro I've ever had.... And believe me, I've had a ton of gyros. It's one of my favorite sandwiches.   Since it was my first time here, I went with the beef gyro lunch combo. They also serve chicken. Nedda (sister to Elie) was sweet and included a side of her delicious made-from-scratch-daily hummus and pita quarters. All of the food was quickly prepared by Elie in the kitchen and it was served so fast I hadn't even had time to take two bites of the tasty salad Nedda have me as the side to my combo. It's incredible how such simple food can be elevated by super fresh ingredients and the deft hand of a cooking master. Both of these things are found at Elie's Deli and it shines in their food.   You also know a restaurant is special when the owners know most customers (who walked in during the duration of my visit) and call them by name, inquire about families and work, tell jokes and laugh together. Elie came out from the kitchen and chatted with everyone in the dining room for a few minutes and brought people's lunches out from the back himself. That kind of personalization transforms a simple lunch into a community experience.   And to be clear, the menu is much more extensive than Mediterranean food . You can dine-in or take-out. They have American style deli sandwiches and burgers too...some things I'll have to try the next time I come to Phoenix. Maybe. If I don't get the gyro again."}
{"text":"I cant believe I have not Yelp'd about one of my favorite places - Elie's Deli!   Time to remedy that!  We've been going to Elie's for at least 3 years now.  Upon our second visit (we always get our stuff to-go).  I punched vent holes in the lids of the takeout boxes.  Did this to keep the fries from getting steamed to death before being able to eat them at home.    Ever since the hole punch, the owners always remember us!  So much so that, they punch holes in the box for J's fries that he orders with his burger.    Honestly, one of the best gryos I've ever had.  Not oily and not drenched in tzatziki.  And the dressing for the greek salad is super good!    Friendly service, good food!"}
{"text":"Elie's is the best in town! I love the feta gyro and the mixed meat salad. The pita bread is light and fluffy and the hummus is excellent! All are FANTASTIC! Portions are big. Customer service is wonderful! It is a little high in cost, but well worth it. You will wait a while for your food too, but what do you expect from a 2 person establishment? So call ahead if you're in a hurry, and don't forget to bring cash!"}
{"text":"Love Elie's Deli!  It's not a fancy place, but neither is the tood or prices.  Elie is a real person and when you eat there, you feel like you're at his home.  We're usually there in the evenings, it's quiet and we enjoy a leisurely meal with some really great healthy food.  Favorite is the grilled chicken pita wtih hummus.  Don't know how he seasons the chicken but it is to perfection with a slight hint of garlic.  Sometimes I get it with rice - yum!  Everything is really fresh and cooked to order.  Portions are generous - you won't go away hungry.  Just writing this makes me want to go back NOW!"}
{"text":"Yes, I agree this place is a gem.  I have always had terrific food here (the gyros and salad's  are awesome).  ALWAYS fresh.  A little expensive considering it's a dive (a very clean one though).  And i have had co-workers complain they don't give you enough food.  But giving 5 stars based on the quality of the food"}
{"text":"I have to fall somewhere in the middle on this place. Elie's gets high marks for being a family-run establishment and for having super-friendly and likeable service, but  it falls a little short in the food department.   I can walk to this place from my work, so I decided to do just that one day last week. Alicia B was definitely right when she said that this place is \"dinky\" - the flooring is old, the tables are dingy, the bathroom is passable, and the \"decor\" consists of a few potted plants and some framed stock pictures of Greece. I might forgive the extreme lack of atmosphere if I felt that the prices were reasonable, since that would mean that the owners were skimping on style in order to provide a high-quality product.   Unfortunately, the food doesn't quite deliver, especially given the high prices. I really wanted to order one of the vegetarian combo plates, but the cheapest one with falafel (plus hummus) was $7.85! That is really steep, in my opinion. If I had wanted to add baba and tabouli, it would have run me $9.10. Because this felt high, I ended up getting the falafel sandwich for $5.59. It only came with lettuce, tomatoes, and tahini sauce, so I ended up adding green peppers for $.45 (a bargain compared to the $.99 they charge to add tomatoes).   I waited 10-15 minutes for my food, which I understand given that there was a steady flow of eat-in and take-out customers. When the sandwich did arrive (with a smile from the again very friendly owner), I enjoyed it because I was starving, but again, wasn't all too impressed. The pita was very large but very dry, and it definitely could have stood to be more moist. Similarly, I found the falafel overly dry and crumbly. The tahini sauce was decent but not as subtle as some I've had in the past.   For $8 or so, I got a filling falafel sandwich and a large Diet Coke. I definitely prefer the $2.99 falafel sandwich at Al-Hana, although the uber-convenient location of Elie's may mean that I return a few more times. I will definitely update if I go back and try something more on-point."}
{"text":"Elie's is a small, unassuming place that gets busy during the lunch rush.  I like their hummas quite a bit and their chicken plate is very tasty.  My wife found their falafel to be unpleasant for some reason.  This is the kind of mom and pop business I like supporting. They are very nice."}
{"text":"Just about now you are wondering are these reviews for real.well they are the food is first rate. It was just delicious. The brother and sister that run it are proud of their business and they have a right to be the food is first rate. They have been in the food business for 30 years and they care about what they do. They shop everyday themselves no deliveries because they are so particular about the food they serve. The place is super clean and they have an outstanding inspector rating. Best of all their 90 year old mother was still working taking pride in what she does not because she has to because she wants to. I am sorry we did not get here sooner, don't be sorry yourself go have some of their food."}
{"text":"Meh.  Average place with average food.   Service is outstanding, though. Very friendly owner who will take the time to point out some of her faves off the menu. She even stopped by our table more than once - first to see how everything once; then to show us how the salads come prepared.   The establishment itself is very \"dinky,\" with little to no flair. There's a sign on the women's bathroom saying it's for customers only. Yet the men's door is void of any such note. The trash can, however, proudly displays a neon 8 x 11 piece of paper: For Trash Only.   If you like gyros, Greek food, a light and quick lunch, try this place out. I don't suspect it'll wow you speechless, but it's okay.   Just remember TO BRING CASH! They do not accept checks or credit/debit cards.   Their hours: 11 a.m. - 8 p.m. M - F 11: a.m. - 7 p.m. Saturdays Closed Sunday"}
{"text":"The Greek salad with Gyro's is really good for Phoenix.  Fresh and clean and cool owners."}
