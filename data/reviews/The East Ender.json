{"text":"Had dinner there Saturday night.  Newly opened and already quite busy.  There were nine in our party and not one complaint!   My friend's beef ribs were succulent, tender and very tasty.  The gnocchi that came with my quail entree, excellent.    All in all, excellent fair, pleasant, attentive service and well priced.  I plan on going back - often!"}
{"text":"I came here with my business partner and our spouses, plus my 3 month old baby to celebrate a business win, mostly because it was equidistant between our homes. We started with pate and dumplings and the pate was a nice surprise because I'm not normally a huge fan. The mustard created balance with the flavour of the chicken and left me asking for more crostini. My wife liked the dumplings because of the quality of the meat inside, and she's rather picky so that's a thumbs up.  I prefer mine steamed but they were good (not too greasy).

For mains I only tried the flank steak and the mussels and both were quite good.  I have had venison before a few times, but this was exceptionally tender and cooked perfectly to medium.  The mussels (which my wife had as a main) were quite good, but again I'm not a huge fan of mussels in general.  One thing I did note is that they were all opened and appeared to be perfectly cooked (it's so annoying when you have 2 or 3 mussels that don't open!).

Highlight of the meal was the service and wine.  The owner at one point helped to rock our baby so we could finish our meals.  We drank a fair amount but left happy and we shared a chocolate dessert that I seem to recall paired well with my wine, but by that point I was just glad I wasn't driving ;)

In summary, I really liked it - prices were Ok, certainly not cheap but I thought good value.  I'm worried that if more people don't start hanging out there then it may not be there next time I swing by.

Cheers.
PS - next review of this place will be brunch, I've heard good things (ie. a Caesar bar??)"}
{"text":"returned for dinner recently.  Food was amazing!  The prosciutto, melon arugula salad was delicious and a great combination of flavours.  The black cod melted in my mouth - so good.  For dessert, we had creme brule cheesecake.  Everything was prepared and presented beautifully.

The owner came to the table a couple of times to check in with us.

The server was friendly but seemed to lack experience (i.e. didn't know how to pour wine)."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times given it is quite local for me.  Brunch twice and dinner twice.  I've had the wild boar canneloni and the bison main as well as the arugula salad with dinners- all are delicious.  It's nice to see so many game options on a menu.  Brunch is a little more disappointing.  Their gluten-free non-bread options are very limited and were not delicious.  I had the most boring omelette of my life here and the kielbasa was nothing that wowed me.  My boyfriend had the fried chicken (all thighs which means I would never eat it personally) and wasn't blown away and the short ribs which he said were okay.  I would highly recommend this place for dinner, less so for brunch. 

The owner is a lovely guy, but his serving staff can be a bit flaky and slow.  Hopefully they will remedy that which would greatly improve the overall service experience here."}
{"text":"Nice restaurant for someone looking for consistent and \"stepped up\" comfort food.  

The ambiance is fairly rustic and warm with exposed brick, some local photography exposed on the walls.....overall it has a classic Leslieville restaurant feel.

The wine list is a little hard to navigate since the names are very familiar. Nonetheless, our waitress made some good suggestions.

There should be something to please everyone on the menu.  Mains include slow cooked chicken (very good), Moroccan lamb shank (also good), beef short ribs, steamed mussels, steak with frites, ravioli and others.

Appetizers looked more adventurous.  We had the dry ribs and a tomato peach salad - both good.  I would have liked try the seared tuna and Asian slaw appetizer.

Prices are very reasonable considering quality and portion.

There is something that must be said for a kitchen that doesn't try too hard to add unnecessary pizazz to their plates.  

Went to The East Ender after the Cirque du Soleil show since it is quite closeby and 
we were glad...we had no problems making a same day reservation for 7pm.  Noticed it got busier after 9pm."}
{"text":"I don't know 100% what to make of this place.  The owner is just about the nicest guy you will find and the menu is definitely imaginative - but...  The interior just feels weird - especially on the entrance side.  For such a small space it is somehow really impersonal.

The menu is a little bit all over the place with some Asian and Asian fusion dishes along side stuff that is much more traditional and does not really seem to match.  Execution was also a little up and down with some things just perfect and others just not quite there.

I want to go back just for the owner but with so many great places in Leslieville I probably won't."}
{"text":"In my neighborhood, so we checked it out last night. The restaurant was more spacious than I thought, nicely spartan and just the right amount of dim lighting.
I would highly recommend the liver pate and the slow-cooked chicken, which was fantastic. Service was attentive and friendly, a good middle of the road comfort food locale, leaning a little bit towards higher-end."}
{"text":"Good food and very friendly service. Chatted with the owner and they happily made blender drink by description (e.g. I'd like something fruity and fizzy). Definitely check this place out if you get the opportunity."}
{"text":"I was getting together with a few friends I don't see so often so we had some catching up to do. As a result we weren't so quick to decide on what we wanted to eat. The owner was very attentive to this and kept our wine glasses full in the meantime. He eventually suggested that we be considered the \"chef's table\" and he would simply bring us several courses of his choosing. 

This idea worked out splendidly. We ended up with 7 courses. 5 appetizers and 2 mains. Everything was tasty (my favourite being the dumplings) and the timing between courses was perfect. It was some of the best service I've ever had and it was obvious a lot of love went into the dishes.

Can't say enough about this place. Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant several times by now. The first time, I went with a group of four. We all ordered something different, and when the dishes came we couldn't help but try a bite from everyone else's dish. I had the iceberg lettuce salad with blue cheese dressing for a starter, and my boyfriend insists we get that every time we return. 

On my first visit I ordered the roast chicken. It was reasonably tasty comfort food, but felt mediocre after tasting the other dishes. The bison steak frites, chocolate beef short ribs and butternut squash ravioli were in a higher league. I imagine that all of the other dishes meet the same standard, but I can't say no to the chocolate short ribs or ravioli on subsequent visits in order to try something new.

The prices are reasonable, mid-range prices for high end food.

The atmosphere is comfortable and fairly intimate, with low lighting and candlelit tables, reasonable spacing between tables, and a fairly quiet background. This would probably be a good spot to really impress on a first date without going over the top.

Service has been consistently good. I haven't felt the overbearing waiters that others are describing. The warm bread always comes quickly, and the courses flow well. The owner usually drops by around dessert time to check in and say hi. 

Overall, some unique yet unpretentious comfort food, and always a pleasant visit. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"I've been twice already - the food was great, and there were so many interesting apps, I just had to go back. Even though I shared items with friends, there's still more things I want to try. My favorite app was the dry ribs - I'm tempted to double it and call it a main! Service matches the food and the prices are very reasonable. The wine program is interesting and affordable. Love the place!"}
{"text":"Our group of 11 came to the East Ender on a Sunday of a long weekend for brunch.  For brunch, the East Ender serves a fixed price menu ($17) that includes salad or home fries, brunch item and a drink.  

It was different that drinks (although not refillable) were also included in the price.  The restaurant didn't just offer juice, milk tea or coffee.  Cappucino, lattes or Americanos were also in the list of choices.  I am quite an avid coffee drinker who prefers the strong, low acidity, aromatic dark roats.  I normally don't order coffee in restaurants because it is typically too weak and acidic for my liking.  Out of curiosity, I ordered an Americano and I thought it was quite nice.

With regards to service, we were the only ones in the restaurant (we came in around 12pm) and the owner was very attentive, coming around several times to check on us.  Not only, food came out surprisingly quick (within 30 - 45 minutes) compared to other \"made fresh to order restaurants\".  Since we were a large group, the owner brought out a few communal plates of home fries and salad to share.  This was a nice plus.

I ordered the smoked salmon sandwich, my boyfriend ordered the fried chicken with cornmeal flapjacks.  With regards to the portions, when my sandwich came out, it was a little disappointing because it seemed like such a small sandwich on a big plate.   I was quite full after eating it all but those with a bigger appetite may find themselves just content.  The poached egg, smoked salmon and avocado melded together quite nicely.  My boyfriend's fried chicken came with 3 pieces of fried chicken.  Taste wise, it was nothing special.  It was most likely intended to be a conservative comfort item for those less adventurous.  

Overall, I think the East Ender is worthy of a try for brunch if you are open to trying non standard brunch dishes.  It's not a restaurant that appeals to the general masses especially not those who like their bacon, eggs and sausages."}
{"text":"I was at The East Ender last night and.. WOW! 

It's hard to know what to start with first - the food or the service. Both were incredible.

For food, my guest and I had the dumplings and ice berg wedge salad to start, and then the Kimchi and the flank steak for our mains. All were above and beyond our expectations! You can tell that whoever is making the food really, really cares. Everything was perfect.

The service truly blew me away. The owner came to our table several times, to help us put together a great meal choice, to ask how everything was, and just to be a really, really nice guy. 

Again - you can tell that the people in this place really CARE. Will definitely be going back again and again - highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"great brunch - we had the fried chicken, the braised beef hash and the pancake with nutella and walnuts and all three dishes were great. It's a bit on the $$ side @17/person but the food and service were quite good, the portions were generous and it's a nice space. We were worried because the place was absolutely empty on a Sunday at around 1:30pm and we thought it was closed and almost skipped it. A couple more tables came while we were there and everyone seemed very happy with their food."}
{"text":"I found this hidden gem while wondering around in the Leslieville neighborhood.  Me and my friends really enjoyed their buns. The steak was also delicious. If you've tried the buns at Momofuku and liked them, you have to try them here - it's even better. The prices are more on the high-end compared to most asian cuisines, chiefly due to the fact that it's asian fusion. The staff is friendly and welcomes feedback!"}
{"text":"Warm, comforting and great selection can describe the East Ender. 

Made reservations for 4 on a Saturday night. The restaurant was already quite busy and welcomed us with candle lit tables. 

Wine and dinner menus both offer a good variety. I ordered the fish and shellfish in tomato fennel broth ($19). It was delicious and quite large in portion size. Other big hits included the roast squash ravioli($17) and slow-cooked chicken ($18).

Service was good. Our waitress was attentive to our wine refills and prepared our bills quickly.

Overall, a restaurant I would return to if you are looking for simple, comfort food in a good atmosphere, without high end prices."}
{"text":"Delicious food and pleasant service in a comfortable environment make the East Ender worthy of return visits. The ahi tuna with Asian slaw appetizer was excellent.  The bison bavette entree was outstanding and is a must try."}
{"text":"YUM - what a great brunch!  Came here on Saturday for brunch.  The food was fantastic, the portions are huge and it is a fixed price menu that comes with a warm beverage (including lattes), banana bread and a bunch of options.

I had the pulled pork pancake with bourbon syrup.  It was HUGE, plate sized and delicious.  I also got amazing hash browns with fresh fruit.  And tea.  My friend had the fried chicken, also delicious.

What was unfortunate was that it was totally empty.  As in, at 12pm on  Saturday we were the only people in the restaurant.  OH, and the server had some timing issues.  She'd disappear for long periods of time yet there was no one else to serve.  I had to go ask her for the bill.

Other than that, my friend went there for dinner and said it was great then, too.  Hopefully word gets around about brunch.  It was yummy!"}
{"text":"We have been to the east ender a few times. I have had the bison steak frites twice and it was decent but the portion seemed small for the price.

The owner came to our table both times to check how are meal was which is a nice touch. 

It is not cheap but the food is good quality .  Our meal for 2 with apps and a shared desert, plus a couple of glass of wine was in the 125$ range. 
 
One gripe is that they charged 8$ for  two glasses of pop which, is a bit steep.

Overall this place is decent but I don't feel the need to return anytime soon."}
{"text":"I think the East Ender will be a great add to the other restaurants on the Queen St E strip!  They serve up delicious Asian-inspired contemporary cuisine in the old Tomi-Kro spot!  My wife and I went there on their first week and were impressed by the food and atmosphere, especially for the price.  As an aside, we found out that it was opened up by the husband-wife duo who previously ran Forte (which now houses Estiatorio Volos).  

Here's my run down:
-Bread: Delicious focaccia to start with tasty olive oil and vinegar.  Bread had a nice crust with soft, chewy core.  It was well seasoned.  Nice way to start
-Starters: We tried the pork sliders.  Its fatty pork on steamed buns with hoisin sauce.  The buns were nice and soft and the pork had a great texture.  I did think that the dish as a whole could have been seasoned better.  The pickled veggies added a kick and crunch!  
-Mains: We had the quail and the trout.  Let's start with quail.  It was cooked well with crispy skin and perfectly tender meat.  It was accompanied by delicious, tender gnochhi and some seasonal veg.  The trout was pan seared.  It was cooked very well - not too dry, which always irks me.  It's served with forbidden rice and seasonal veg with a soy butter sauce!  This rice definitely needs to be forbidden b/c it's so delish, probably cuz it's coated in butter!  Yum!  Both mains were great!!  And well-priced at $20/piece
-Dessert: didn't try, but sounded tasty.  Nothing too inventive: flourless chocolate cake, panna cotta, etc.
-Service: This would be my only complaint.  The service felt slow.  They seemed to be understaffed with 4 people serving two separate dining rooms.  Every staff member seemed to be doing everything: making drinks, taking orders, bringing-out dishes, cleaning tables.  We were served by every member of their 4 person team over our dinner  Roles, responsibilities, and zones, my friend!  I hope it's because this was their first week.  They were packed, which I'm guessing they weren't expecting.  Hoping for improvement next time around!  

Overall, a nice meal out for some unique cuisine.  Love the asian-inspired menu and can't wait to go back to try the dry-spiced pork ribs, the chili and chocolate bison steak and dessert!"}
{"text":"We dropped in here on a spare of the moment whim... we were just driving down Queen Street and thought of giving it a shot.  It was on Saturday, May 4th, 2013.  

The staff were all very friendly and service was excellent.   The owner did come over a few times to see how we were doing.

The food itself was pretty good - I had a flank steak and wedge salad.  

The problem I had with our meal, and the restaurant, was during dessert.  As I finished the chocolate cake I noticed an ant crawling around in the chocolate crumbs.  Much to our surprise, there were ants all over the floor and around our table... little tiny ants. I called the owner over and showed him the ants - he was apologetic and took the price of the dessert off our bill.  I figured an insect infestation and insects on my plate would warrant a free meal.  I have no idea how many ants I may have consumed...  I had the urge for the rest of the evening to just keep spitting out on the sidewalk.  

Otherwise, it was a good meal and the service was really good. But, I don't think I will return and I don't think I would recommend it to any of my friends.  How can you recommend a place that has ants crawling around?"}
{"text":"Mediocre food, and service that hovers and isn't very knowledgeable. I think it wants to be some sort of 'fusion' restaurant, but doesn't know how to do that. There are plenty of cheaper and better restaurants in the area."}
{"text":"This is my favourite restaurant in Toronto. I honestly can't say enough good things about this place. The food is absolutely amazing and I consider myself to be a picky eater!! The service is stellar, atmosphere pleasant and romantic. Every dish is unique and bursting with flavour. Still a bit of a hidden gem."}
{"text":"We stopped by for the first time one night after work and had an unexpectedly great time!

The owner served us and he was cheerful, good natured and really made our night. The food was an interesting and delicious mix of Asian and Italian flavours.  The wine was terrific and not super expensive.  The decor was upscale, yet cozy and relaxing."}
{"text":"Omg what a surprise, Asian fusion at its best , every bite told a story, I was truly impressed. 
North Africa  , Asia, and continental with a twist.
Loved it and will be back."}
{"text":"Sadly, I think the East Ender is closed now.  We went tonight  (Saturday Feb. 22, 2014) and the place was dark and \"For Rent\" signs were on the windows.  I found this surprising because it always seemed fairly busy to me (at least on weekends).  I really liked the food and service and it was one of my favourite restaurants on Queen East."}
