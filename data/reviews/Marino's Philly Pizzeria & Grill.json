{"text":"This location recently opened on 521 just south of Ballantyne.  Tried them for the first time tonight - ordered a large pizza with pepperoni, sausage and extra cheese.  Thought it was expensive ($30) - until I saw the size of this puppy!  8 New York sized slices in a large pie.  Very tasty and just a bit on the greasy side, just the way pizza should be.  Pizza needed just a little more sauce for my taste.  We had the \"Classic Original\" crust but according to the menu, you can also request Sicilian, deep dish at no additional cost.  In addition to pizza, menu offerings include the usual soups, salads, pastas and sandwiches.  Can't wait to try the meatball sandwich.  Alcohol seemed to be available to dine in customers.  There is also another location in Waxhaw.  Be prepared to pay a bit more - in order to get a bit more in terms of both quality and quantity."}
{"text":"Went there right after they opened - the pies are the real deal. Big, Northeast style pizza's with a chewy crust and quality toppings. In particular I like their cheese and sauce. However, I don't like their sausage and mushrooms (canned). Ugh!  Also, it is fairly expensive for what it is - I think they are trying to compete with Tony's in Ballantyne Village. However, Tony's has a reputation and therefore can charge those prices. Marino's would go a long way if they dropped their prices a bit or issued coupons. As it is, I'd rather take my business to the 2-3 other places in Ballantyne that also offer quality pies but are cheaper. . ."}
{"text":"They wouldn't know a real Philly Steak if the were standing at 1237 E Passyunk Ave (if you don't know where this is- you don't know steaks either)!"}
{"text":"I have been going to their location in Weddington/Waxhaw for the past few weeks as I have found they have incredibly authentic Philly cheesesteaks. I am a Philly native that has lived in Manhattan and Charlotte the past 9 years and I have not found a true Philly-style cheesesteak as good as these guys do it. They use Amoroso rolls - big key to the Philly taste. keep up the good work.  They need to have better decor/atmosphere. There is no energy in the place whatsoever. But the steaks are sooo good it doesn;t matter.  I will check out the Ballantyne location soon..."}
