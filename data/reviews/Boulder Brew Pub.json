{"text":"Space hasn't changed with new ownership. Menu choices have decreased. One of the best items that Grey's had was their pretzels with spicy brown mustard. Apparently the mustard went with the original owners.    Asked for a side on Sunday that was listed as \"weekend only\", but was informed that those were only served on Friday and Saturday nights.   Nothing really stood out as unique.  Food was mediocre.   I was looking for something better in the neighborhood. Just disappointed."}
{"text":"Boulder Brew Pub has replaced Grays Tied House.  While the decor and menu remain primarily the same, there are some notable differences.  It's still a beautiful, modern, open space. This time however, we were tucked back around the corner where it is less open and light. Our service was still extraordinary. I'm always impressed when a server can remember my order without writing it down especially when I've made special requests. We joked around with her after placing the order and before she left the table to key it in which impressed me that she got it right even more.  One of the things Boulder Brew Pub still does which I truly appreciate is they offer dipping vegetables (carrots and broccoli) AND they let me substitute blue cheese dressing instead of ranch. I do miss the Bacon Blue Cheese burger they offered at Grays but I did enjoy the barbecue pork on a pretzel bun. The sauce was tasty but it was pretty excessive. Although the beer is good, I also miss the home-brewed soda-pops that Grays offered.  Nevertheless, Boulder Brew Pub continues the solid service, ambiance, and food that I received from Grays. It's definitely worth a visit."}
{"text":"Stopped in after work for a going away party for a friend. This place is massive and can hold quite a few for a get together. I'm not sure how long it's been open since the closing of Gray's, but it's a decent spot.  We split a pizza that was pretty mediocre. The staff was very friendly and more than helpful. Would probably stop back at some point, but may give it a few months for them to work the kinks out."}
{"text":"Nothing really stood out.  Seemed more or less of an afterthought of a restaurant.  Food wasn't terrible by any means, but was nothing to be excited for.  Service seemed dysfunctional, no refilling of drinks because the waitstaff was running around, didn't look busy though, made me wonder what's going on. Overall not impressed and likely will not return."}
{"text":"We were excited to try Boulder Brew Pub after Grey's closed it's doors. Unfortunately, we were less than impressed. I had the Quesadilla Burger and my husband had The Sicilian Sandwich. Both of our sandwiches were okay; however, the fries were terrible. My son had the cod fish and tater tots, which both tasted like frozen food you would buy from your local grocery store.   We were looking forward to a new restaurant, but unfortunately will not be returning. Prices were high, decor looked exactly the same as Grey's, and the food was less than ideal."}
{"text":"Pint prices for beer are too high. Place hasn't even been painted since new ownership took over and looks dingy. The booths had ripped upholstery and food crumbs in the cracks. Surprisingly they had money for commercials but not for freshening up the place. I can't imagine this place will stay open very long."}
{"text":"Same place with a different name. Prices are way out of line for the area. Ranch wrap was really bad with flavorless chicken and bacon bits instead of bacon. Salads were small for the price. Beer prices are very high for pints compared to Madison and Verona area bars. Building is impressive but whoever priced the items obviously didn't do their homework for the area. Don't waste your time."}
{"text":"The very definition of blah.  Honestly the old Gray's had better quality ingredients, cooking and atmosphere.  It certainly had its ups and downs, but this is a step backwards.  The appetizer we ordered sounded good but was just a wrong combination of melted Brie cheese, medium rare tuna and herb spiked mayo erroneously referred to as chimichurri sauce.  It seemed like the kitchen read up on food trends and slapped a few buzz words together to create a dish.  Should have just gone with the cheese curds.  My litmus test of upscale bar food is the burger.  I went with the house with onion straws and BBQ sauce.  Flavor was ok, but I ordered it cooked medium and it was cooked well done.  The saving grace was the sweet potato fries were the old Gray's quality and with that fantastic balsamic dipping sauce from old as well.  My wife ordered the steak sandwich.  The meat looked a few days past dry and overall it was tasteless.  She ate half and walked away.  My daughters salmon salad was ok, but again the meat (this case fish) was way over cooked.  Beer list is small but some good choices and our server was nice.  I wanted this place to be a new casual stop for us Verona locals, but I think I'd only return for drinks and hope the cheese curds were like the old Gray's."}
{"text":"Ok, so I visited a couple of days pre-Grand Opening. But the weather was too beautiful to NOT eat on their massive outdoor deck!  My hubby and I ordered the Fried Cheese Curds appetizer. It was a very generous serving, and the batter was light and crispy.  The cheese was somehow not terrific (I know.....shocking). We even didn't eat them all.  Our entrees, on the other hand, were wonderful. Hubby had the Brick Oven Steak Sandwich with kettle chips. The sandwich was HUGE and flavorful.  I had the Southwest Steak Salad:  fresh leafy greens with cooked-to-order steak, blue cheese, tomatoes, black beans, other good stuff. I would definitely order this salad again!  FYI: Boulder Brew Pub is coming out with a new menu on 5/19/18....hoping both our entrees will be on it!!"}
