{"text":"Wiseys is exactly what the Leaside area needed!  The meat pies are reasonably priced and are deliciously filling (I bought some for a family brunch and they were a huge hit!).  They also have an impressive selection of sweet and savoury baked goods - i.,e  savoury and blueberry scones are very flavourful and fresh, and the cinnamon donuts are addictive.  I also tried a flat white (coffee) for the first time, and I am now a big fan.  

A really lovely cafe with adorable decor and very friendly staff.  I always look forward to stopping in."}
{"text":"This was my third visit to this small but quaint establishment. The coffee and hot chocolate has been good up until my last visit. I ordered hot chocolate and instead of a properly prepared one made with good quality cocoa I was given a sickly sweet syrupy concoction, I was charged $4. I refused the drink after tasting it and asked for an espresso in return but was told that he could make the HC less sweet. I tried again and it was still the worst HC I have ever had, please correct this simple problem. Also, the young gent serving needs to learn to be more friendly and smile."}
{"text":"We had the steak and mushroom pie and it was inedible. Very little steak and no mushrooms to speak of -- just a thick gelatinous, salty goop (filling) in pie crust. Not much value for the 17 dollar spend and we threw most of it away. I definitely would not recommend."}
{"text":"Staff is incredibly friendly and sociable, amazing personality, and looked like she believed in the quality of their food. We had turkey and Brie pie and steak and mushroom. 

Coming from a person who never liked the idea of meat and chicken pies, I absolutely loved what we are. This is one of those places where reviews and descriptions can't fully describe how amazing their food tastes. They also serve pastries, dessert pies, and coffee. It's like a cafe with a lot of spunk. Would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Very delicious, if slightly under-seasoned pie. The dough was great and crispy. The filling was abundant, just lacking a little S&P. The staff was very friendly - He even recommended we put ketchup on the pie because that's the owner's favourite style!

Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Used to be better.  Stopped in recently while I was in the neighbourhood to get a pie and some cake - ordered what I thought was a chicken pie, ended up with a steak and 'mush' pie.  The meat was dry, the pie had for the most part some sort of gelatinous filling, and the pie shell was soggy on the bottom, almost as if underbaked.  Obviously, the server couldn't decipher the pie circles, arrows, and lines they use to identify their pies, so how are the customers supposed to?  The cake was dry, too, unfortunately.  I didn't used to mind waiting 10 mins to get served, but this is ridiculous now, especially when they have 4, 5(?) people behind the counter serving two people ahead of me.  How difficult can it be to plop a pie on a plate, make a coffee, and get payment?  Not going back, not worth the drive."}
{"text":"Cute Bakehouse in a great location with amazing friendly service! Unfortunately I was a bit disappointed. The pies were beautiful and flaky but seriously lacked flavour. I bought a chicken and mushroom and it was just very bland. The sweet pie desserts however were delicious!"}
{"text":"Never had a pie this good in my life. Got the steak and mushroom large and my girl had a small sized mince meat with potato topping. Absolutely delicious. The steak pieces were nice and thick chunks and when I mean it was fully loaded I mean it was fully loaded.

Also bought two pecan tarts and we both agreed that they were the best pecan tarts we've ever had. Can't wait to try the smoked cod and lamb/sweet potato pies next time. What a great addition to the neighbourhood. Truly 5 star material."}
{"text":"Omg this is literally the cutest, delicious and friendly place ever. 

I got the steak pie and sausage roll AND I LOVE IT ! I wish i tried this place earlier as i wont be in this are that often anymore. 

You have to try it, the flake is perfect. Each one is hand made and you can just tell the carefully thought out flavors of each pie that are mini and ready to eat are PERFECT. 

You can also buy family sized pies in savoury and sweet flavors!"}
{"text":"I love it when I stumble upon a great lil shop that serves up amazing food! I had the steak and mushroom pie and the raspberry brownie. Big chunks of steak in a delicious gravy and the brownie was so decadent, crispy on the outside and soft and chewy melts in your mouth with the perfect amount of raspberry. Would definitely come back ..especially for the brownie :)"}
{"text":"Heard about this place from a friend of mine; however, it was a bit out of my way. At last I got the chance to step in to Wiseys last week. Just a heads up, parking just infront of the store may be not available always, however just hop into Laird Ave and Park on the side roads (free parking spaces are available). Getting back to the topic, I tried their Steak and Cheese Pie and the Flat white... both were amazing! I am in love with pie!!!
Besides, I must say, the service was absolutely brilliant. The lady taking my order was smiling and explaining me about the foods and different beverages. I will definitely go back to this place again!"}
{"text":"I've been here a handful of times. They're generally friendly and the food is bang on. If you like scrumptious pies and/or sweet lovely desserts, this is your place. I really like the spongy cake with the coconut stuff all over it.

They lose two stars for the entirely disgruntled rotund redheaded girl. I seriously don't know what her problem is. I've dealt with her three times now. The first time she was a bit rude which was fine. Whatever.  

The second time I asked a few questions about coffee beans. She said point blank she didn't know anything about the beans, couldn't offer a suggestion when all I asked for was a \"dark roast.\"  I had to literally try to pull out information out of that little head of hers.  Then the owner or who I thought was the owner sat down. Ta da, then a 180 happened. It's like she recovered from amnesia and offered a dark coffee blend. LOL

I sighed to myself and thought maybe she was having an off day.

Yeaaaah, nope. I got a coffee today. She literally did not want to serve me. She made me repeat my order twice and was atrociously rude in demeanor, tone and gesture.

Train your staff. It's really not that hard to hand over a coffee with a smile and recite some basic knowledge about your products.

Hell, I'll take simple neutrality and info cards."}
{"text":"Really tasty, savory pies and I really enjoy their blondies, which are rich with great buttery texture.  Also, the carrot cake is the best I've had in years -- the frosting isn't sickeningly sweet, and the cake is wonderfully spiced, with raisins. 

 The server never judges me for getting two desserts -- another bonus. The space is really comfortable. This place deserves to be busy all the time, but I'm personally glad that it isn't, yet. I suspect that will change."}
{"text":"A nice addition to the Roncesvalles strip which made the trip to the west end worthwhile.  A small place upon entering, but felt bright and cheerful inside with limited seating area on main level, plus two tables of four upstairs.   The smell of pies (both savoury and sweet) gave a warm welcome and made me salvatate with hunger.

Best to go early to ensure your selection as some pies sells out quick or you can pre-order to guarantee your favourite pie(s).  They sell whole 7\" pies at reasonable prices as well.  This location has been opened for a couple of months now, but it won't be long before people will come flocking to this location instead of the flagship store on Eglinton and Laird.

Staff was welcoming and friendly, plus patient as we decided  among the various savoury pies.  I ordered the lamb and sweet potato pie which was simply delicious. The individual pie was filled with chunks of lamb and the sweet potato added a nice flavour to the already flavourful lamb. 

You haven't had meat pies until you tasted a Wiseys pie.  Even my friend from New Zealand, who recommended the place said it was the real thing, a taste from home away from home.  A stamp of approval from a kiwi, what more can you ask for?  Go try a Wiseys pie for yourself before they're all gone!"}
{"text":"I was not a meat pie person, but I tried their meat pie and I became a fan of it. They have a nice table and seat and you can eat there. It is a nice comfortable place.  I liked to eat pie there because the pie is already heated at the best temperature. It is not cheap, but it is big. Take out is also good, but you have to heat it at home and it can be tricky. I am hoping to come back there soon."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, outstanding coffee, great pies, scones, tarts at reasonable prices- what more could you ask? 
Parking can be a bitch because of crosstown construction but well worth the effort!"}
{"text":"Had a steak mushroom pie and chicken curry pie, very delicious, nice place, can't miss it"}
{"text":"Totally wonderful and rich savory pies. Stopped by after work on my first visit right before they closed and the lady gave me several for free which was ultra nice. I felt like I had won the lottery. It's well worth the $7 for the steak and kidney that was chock full of beef chunks and kidney. The Thai chicken one has hints of sesame oil but the pastry retains its crisp butteriness. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"A work colleague was raving about the meat pies at Wisey's and promised to bring me one to try. Well, today was the day and wow - the pies are superb. Perfect portion sizes, flaky crust and a decent amount of filling make them a winner in my book!

I had the minced beef pie and there was tons of delicious filling inside. I found the meat to gravy ratio a bit off, however, with a lot more meat than delicious gravy. This is a minor complaint, however.

The pie held it together as I was eating which is a feat in itself, and the pastry was flaky on top. In terms of quality, I think it's right up there with the best and was very tasty indeed.

I'm told they have other varieties including beef and cheese, chicken satay and some fruit pies. They also have family-sized pies which would make a great family meal on a cold evening.

Bravo, Wisey's - I'll be dropping by soon!"}
{"text":"This is the third meat pie place that I have reviewed, and this one does not disappoint, with some affordable midtown relief for my pie craving.

The strip of stores along Eglinton and Laird are going through a revival, and located next to the Starbucks, you get the requisite hipster vibe when you walk in with a large harvest table with Monocle magazines laying around, and smaller tables nearby.

The owners bake their pies daily, and unlike other places, they focus on walk in and sit down dining rather than selling pies in bulk.  This means that they also provide ample seating and answer all your questions with a lovely Kiwi accent. They also offer the full café selection with coffee and pastries, making this a good chill area in an area that's still dominated by chain restaurants.

The pies are bursting with fillings!  My steak pie ($6) was stuffed with large chunks of flavourful beef, and seasoned well; good gravy and sticks to the basics, though there are more exotic flavours available.  The crust was also very light and easy to eat, making the overall experience filling and satisfying.

I will definitely make this a regular stop the next time I'm looking for good eats midtown."}
{"text":"Best pies.
From breakfast to lunch to dinner options....cafe items are even a hit! Staff are friendly, if they run out of a kind, they usually have it in the back and will sell it to you. I'm a frequent weekend morning breakfast pie or a pick up after work for dinner pie. They have spots to eat in house, or nice boxes to take home. They reheat very well for anyone wondering!

Love the steak and mushroom and the bacon and egg pies!"}
{"text":"If you're going to serve pilot coffee, make sure you hire baristas that know what they're doing. As soon as she asked what size cappuccino I wanted, I knew it was trouble. I get the idea is pie but the coffee service is less than incredible. If you're going to serve your coffee in a shitty way, use a shitty bean. Or hire people that can make a proper cup to do a good bean justice."}
{"text":"This place is great, and the food was \"authentic\". 

Shared a lamb and also steak meat pies. Both were excellent, and very similar to what I used to eat in Australia. The lamb in particular was really good. The price is great too... $6 is very reasonable, especially given these are big pies (I had previously eaten at Kanga in downtown, where you pay more for a smaller and inferior pie). 

Also tried the Lamington. This again reminded me of Australia. The exception being that it doesn't have the layer of cream in the middle. Still really good though. My only \"complaint\" about this is that it's  a little on the big side. It would be nice if they had smaller ones too. 

The Flat white was decent. But this is the reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5. I thought it was more a cappuccino than a flat white... ie the milk: coffee ratio was too high. I'll give it another try though. 

Parking is a little bit of a hassle. I got free residential parking, but had to walk about 5min.
Will return!"}
{"text":"It's so sad that they're moving to Etobicoke! The scones, peach muffins and cream cheese pastries are the best pick-me-ups in the morning before work. Compared to the Starbucks that is two stores away, the baked goods here have a better price to quality ratio."}
{"text":"Was meaning to check out this place as I drive by Wisey's every morning en route to work. I dropped in this morning to try out a pie or two. This place is not too large, but there a few tables so you can dine in. The decor is pretty nice; it looks like you're in someone's backyard. If you look around, you'll find items associated with New Zealand on the walls. In terms of getting here, it is TTC accessible (bus stop right in front); however, you can also drive here and find a lot of free parking on the side streets around Wisey's. Alright, now on to the food ... I picked up three pies (vegetable quiche, butter chicken pie, and steak-mushroom pie). I managed to have a couple of bites of all three; they were all equally delicious. The crust was flaky and super light; there was a generous portion of filling in each pie. I could eat one whole pie and nothing else as a meal and be quite full. For next time, I'd like to try the chicken Thai pie along with Wisey's sweets and a coffee. I didn't know this, but apparently Flat White originates from New Zealand so would like to order it here.

Good for: lunch (meat pies), coffee, dessert"}
{"text":"I bought a potato-topped mince pie to reheat at home. Don't know what else to say except that my pie was DELICIOUS!
Living in this 'hood, I can guarantee frequent repeat visits."}
{"text":"Today I went to Wiseys to get 4 family fruit pies. I asked about their family pie deals and the server pointed to the sign and told me to look there... then explained the deal. It came off to me that she wanted me to just read the sign rather than answering the questions directly.
I told her I wanted four family pies and she proceeded to tell me to look at the case for what was available. There were pre boxed pies in the case. 1 of them i could see was labled cherry on the box. the rest were obscured. I moved to the the cashier and asked if they had all the fruit pies available on the menu (apple, blueberry, peach and cherry). Again, she said to look at the case. =_=... i physically moved in front of the case again... not being able to tell what was available. I asked her if she had blueberry in there. Finally she checks the case herself and pulls out a few boxes to see what was there. Jeez, about time. She then started to list some of what was there. Turns out there was strawberry which was not even on the menu. And only blueberry was missing. 
When she finally wrung me up the cash, she didnt even bag my purchase nor asked if i wanted a bag.

I like wiseys pie fillings (i wish the crusts were flakier though for the fruit pies... tastes like bread). The meat pies especially are something unique in Toronto, however the service I received today was bad. It makes me think twice... to go back."}
{"text":"Really great establishment in Leaside. I'm in love with the decor and wood finishes, makes the place very photogenic. I was told the bottom and top crusts of each pie are two made with different pastries, which is very cool & you can taste the difference. I had the lamb & sweet potato and the flavour was very unique. The black pepper in the filling was very prominent but in a good way to cut down the richness of the pie. The service was great, very comforting. The only issue is the utensils could be less cloudy!"}
{"text":"Love them. There locations is small. But taking a pie home for dinner makes my night!"}
{"text":"Delicious homemade little all-in-one goodies for like $5 each? No complaints. I just killed part of a steak and cheese (pretty good) and a chicken and mushroom (excellent). The chicken stacks up well to my homemade chicken pot pie made with America's Test Kitchen's high-effort recipe, and that's high praise. The custard bar was ace, too. A fine overall value for fast food."}
{"text":"Perhaps unbeknownst to most but let me announced now that there is an Aussie and Kiwi (New Zealand) pie showdown in this great city! 
Historically speaking it is believed pies were pioneered by the Egyptians but it was the Greeks that took the idea and elevated the pie to new heights by creating the now famous pie pastry. The Romans love it, took the idea with them and started a pie revolution in Europe. Anyhow, history lesson aside...how the heck did pies become so big down south on the other side of the world? I have no idea.
In one corner you have Kanga(Aussie) around Queen W area and then there's Wiseys; a very formidable and more successful competitor. On the outside both pies almost look indistinguishable but once you bite into it the difference is apparent. Wiseys pies have thick, chewy crust that is still somewhat flaky (barely). The dough is much too chewy for my liking. The filling is where it failed me; absolutely way too runny. I had the butter chicken and most of the filling ended up in the box. Though the flavours were okay (butter chicken was more reminiscent of a Thai curry chicken instead) I find that Kangas' flavours are better because they are bold.
There is a clear winner here and it's not Wiseys. I am going to give them a solid 2 stars for the food as they have all the pieces to succeed but refinement is desperately needed. An extra star for the amazing coffee from Pilot roasters! I also love their rustic, warm and welcoming atmosphere. Definitely a cozy place to relax and enjoy some amazing coffee sans the pies of course."}
{"text":"After months of holding off any plans to come here, I finally braved through the restrictive weather on Tuesday to try a pie from Wiseys.
It's more spacious inside that what's shown in the pictures with enough spots to sit and enjoy your purchases.
The pies are given a greater push than some of the other products as the Barista asked me and several other customers if we came for a pie.
I had a Lamb and Sweet Potato pie as well as what looked like a square piece of cheese cornbread, even though the barista gave it a certain name which I've forgotten. The meat filling which was mixed with a peppery, creamy sauce stayed warm while I was slowly savoring my pie and the texture of the crust was not too flaky or greasy. I just wish the savory square was also warm but I probably should have asked if it could have been given some heat.
I would like to go back when the weather is better to try another pie and a Lamington which looked about the size of a baseball."}
{"text":"After being inundated with images of pies for Pie Day, the next day had me searching for a good pie place and luckily my search led to Wiseys. I swear you could smell the sweet fragrance of pastry and meat from the beginning of the block. The place itself is small, cheery and compact, with a line of counter seats facing the street and two tables in the back. Think take-out counter but with enough seating for maybe 3 groups. 

I tried both the lamb and sweet potato pie and the steak and cheese pie. Both were delicious but I'm always biased to lamb so it won my vote. They don't come with any sides or anything else, but these little pucks of pastry are surprisingly filling. The pastry is thicker than what I'm use to but it perfectly balanced the amount of flavorful juicy fillings inside. I will definitely be back before the next Pie Day comes around again."}
{"text":"Big chunks of beef and peppery gravy goodness. Big portion of pie it will easily fill you up and I love that it's very affordable at $6. I'm going back. This is a gem."}
{"text":"I have visited this place about five times the pie is alright, flat white is overrated. Above all, this cashier that i see every morning, not once smiled and has very unpleasant demeanor. She throws pies on the table when handing over to customer and cuts customer abruptly when they are speaking to her. Clearly she is not enjoying her job, not sure why the store is keeping her. I like the pie but because of her, i dont want to visit. Terrible customer service. Ruins the experience."}
{"text":"I had to stop by this place to make up for the bad breakfast I had this morning.  Next to a Starbucks, I encourage all cafe lovers to try this out. 

This place is a perfect little hip cafe featuring a decor out of a Michaels inspired Pinterest board.  No it's not original in that sense but it knows what it is and does it well.  I'm a big fan of their mason water keg because it fits the style and I don't have to ask for water or refills.  

My blue haired server was very bubbly and helpful in my decision making.  She actually had been learning from the bakers so she knew about the items.  My kind of service.  Even gave me the name of the DJ they were playing. 

The menu sounds nice, but the visuals are even better.  Almost all the items are on display and look delectable.  I could come here every week if I lived in the area.  Homemade donuts and fresh meat pies - they've already won. 

I was more than pleased with the sample tray (the most moist and soft lamington ever is created from warm eggs in the mix).  A free mini cookie with my flat white was a bonus (free stuff...always works).  I enjoyed a breakfast pie and saved it for later. 

I could spend all day here...but I have to go."}
{"text":"3.5

Pros:
Very well done savoury pies

Cons:
Everything else is a little overpriced and just meh
No sides to accompany pies

OK, if you love savoury pies you have to check this place out.  Come here for the pies, and basically stick with the pies.

Wiseys has a very cozy atmosphere from the moment you walk in.  It's a pretty small place but they manage to fit as many seats as possible.  There's 2 tables that can fit 4 and a large table that can probably fit 8-10.  Also, are some stools at the front and a much smaller table for 2.  We ended up sharing the larger table with another family.

We ordered a steak and mushroom and a steak and cheese pie.  We also had the latte, hot chocolate, a scone and savoury muffin.  Let's just stert with the pies.  They were absolutely dlish.  The pastry was very well done, nice softness and texture.  The filling was very good as well.  It could of used some more meat but I'm nitpicking here.  It was really one of the better savoury pies I've had in the city.  They have many to choose from and at $6 a pie, it's a pretty good deal.

The latte and the hot chocolate were a little disappointing.  They were not the best tasting and for the price, they were very small.  The scone and muffin were a little better. There was better value there. If they place offered something like a salad to accompany the pies, I would of liked it a lot better.  The pies aren't the biggest, so having something to accompany it would of been better.  I would need to order 2 pies to be full otherwise.

All in all, if you're coming here for the pies which should be why you're coming, you will not be disappointed.  Wiseys does a very good one.  Hold off on anything else if you ask me."}
{"text":"Their savory pies are great. We have tried the steak (with & without mushroom), lamb and curry chicken. The raspberry pie was ok. Coffee tasted fresh as well.

However, one thing that we noticed is how the servers seems lethargic and does not look like they're interested in providing good customer service. I hope that this can be looked at by management. Looks like we're not the only one noticing this behavior."}
{"text":"We ordered the 1 meat / 1 sweet pie combo for $30. We got the curry chicken pie and an apple pie. Took them home, followed the reheating instructions, ate the pies... AMAZINGLY GOOD PIE! Seriously. Better than ordering pizza. They should do pie delivery. I would pay the extra $5 to have pie delivered to my door fresh and hot. Having to reheat the pie is a minor annoyance, but it makes for very tasty pie."}
{"text":"Most times that I have visited Wiseys have been met with very kind and courteous servers at the front. Except for today. The lady who \"helped\" me today did not care to sell me any pies. She was rude and was not helpful when I asked her questions related to their pies. Telling me to look at the display glass to get my answers does not help if I had already done so. After all I am asking her because I cannot tell what pies are inside the boxes... She should be able to use her words like a big girl and communicate with me and explain what is available. This lady also didn't have a new zealand accent as compared to the other girls who I've met at the store (something to watch out for if you plan to get service here, avoid her like the plague). I wonder where they picked her up from. This was a truly unforgettable experience and is enough for me to not come back.

I will also comment on their pies. I've tried their apple pie which has an amazing filling, but very mediocre crust. The crust is a very dense doughy crust, not at all flakey and buttery. Perhaps this is the style in new zealand. The apple pie filling is amazing enough to make me not mind the crust."}
{"text":"the cinnamon donut is great, mocha is good,  green curry pie is a little bit rich and oily, service is friendly!"}
{"text":"Wisey's is a new(ish) addition to the laird and eglinton corner. They serve coffee, treats, morning fair and PIE. So many types of pie. They're lucky to have such good food/ coffee because there really isn't much else around to draw you to this neighborhood. They serve pilot coffee, which is great. I've been to wisey's at least 15 times for coffee and I will admit that the first few months were not great but they really seem to have gotten their groove and the last few lattes/ americanos/ flat whites I've had, have been great. I've tried the lamb and sweet potato, kidney, and chicken and mushroom pie and they were all delicious. I've been meaning to try their butter chicken pies but they seem to always be sold out (which says something). It's a cute spot with a Kiwi theme. The owners/ staff are always nice and there are some unique treats you can't find anywhere else (must be the Kiwi thing). Definitely worth a visit if you like meat pie, they're the best I've had in a while !"}
{"text":"I frequent this place but this time around I was truly disappointed.  Tried their Thanksgiving roll and it just tasted burnt and seems like it sat in the heating oven way too long.  

A very cute place and previously known as Wisey Pies--not sure why they changed their name.  I love their butter chicken pies but not sure what happened with this..."}
{"text":"Had a great cappuccino and a New Zealand style meat pie. They were both great, I also had a Ginger square which was also really good. Definitely will stop by more often and need to try some other pies. Would like to try some of the bigger take home pies."}
{"text":"First time I've had a meat pie and it was exactly like what I imagined it to be: full of meat and very heavy. Considering it's $6 per piece, I'd say it's extremely reasonable price for value. Asked the ladies working there which one they recommended - they couldn't really give a sure-fire answer but I went with the steak and cheese in the end. Like I said before, super meaty!! More meat than cheese for sure. Would love to come grab the curry chicken next time!

Also tried a flat white with almond milk - can't say it was very groundbreaking. You're just as good going to a Starbucks."}
{"text":"Double Shot Flat White pulled by a New Zealand native using Pilot coffee beans with great latte art.

It is hard to believe that Wiseys Pie and Bakehouse would serve such an awesome coffee.

And of course MEAT PIE!! Steak with Cheese is not joke as the fillings has 2 layer of steak. All meat, no filler! The crust is so flaky. 

Aside from meat pies, the other baked goods looks as good as everything here is baked in house.

Definitely worth stopping by Wisey Pie and Bakehouse when you in the area. I would be back for more pies and of course another Flat White!"}
{"text":"After having some mind blowingly delicious New Zealand pie's at Ta Pies Montreal, we looked for an equivalent in Toronto and ended up at a newly opened Wiseys. We ordered the mince and cheese (my favourite) and steak and mushroom (his favourite). 

While they did not compare to the heaven in pie form we had in Montreal, the crust is fantastic, a touch undercooked on the inside but buttery and delicious nonetheless. I found the steak a bit tough and the cheese a bit lacking and overall there wasn't sufficient filling for the amount of crust. You definitely need to eat these pies on a plate with a fork and knife as they are flaky and saucy. At this price point ($6 with tax) we will be returning for future meat pie fixings, and I would love to try the butter chicken flavour.

The space is beautiful, what a well-designed café. They have Pilot beans so providing the servers know what they're doing I'm sure the coffee is great, and they practically give away loafs of bread at $2. I took home a sourdough that was delicious. There is also a selection of doughnuts, Chelsea buns, croissants, scones (plus other desserts) and frozen pies to take home and heat up. The servers were over the top bright eyed big smiles friendly-friendly. Definitely a great addition to the area!"}
{"text":"Try the lamb pie! It is amazing. Chucks of lamb meat, sweet potato and peppery gravy! I also tried some of their other savoury pies but to me the absolute show stopper was the lamb pie. 

Their coffee is also very good. I have tried the ice coffee and their flat white both made with pilot coffee. Very satisfying! The ice coffee was especially good since they don't dump a bunch of sweetener in it.

I also took away a fruit pie-blueberry. It was a bit different they pastry was almost like a cookie type crust. I wasn't expecting it at all but it was in no means bad just different. The filling was pumped full of berries and very tasteful and not too sweet. It was a very good pie and I wonder if the crust is just the way it's done in New Zealand."}
{"text":"North Shore Pie is a small pie store with limited seating located around Roncesvalles and Queen St. W. I dropped by on a Sunday morning at around 11am to pick up a chicken and mushroom pie. They had several pies to select from and all looked delicious. The pie I got was roughly around $7 which is a bit pricey in my opinion, however, the chicken in the pie was not dry and there were several large chunks of chicken breast meat in the pie. Overall, great pies to have for a light meal or snack."}
