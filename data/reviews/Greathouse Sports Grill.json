{"text":"Here for Monday night football, wings are on point meaty and cooked perfect. Service is excellent the waitress never far away and kept the brews coming."}
{"text":"Everything was great, service and food, would definitely come back! We had the ribs and the crispy chicken sandwich, they were delicious."}
{"text":"Will never come back to this place! Our server was great but the manager was horrible and the utensils were dirty! We told the manager about it and he looked at us as if there was something wrong with us complaining!"}
{"text":"We were craving wings and thought we would give Greathouse a try. Customer service was fine, but the quality of the food very poor. The salad greens was old and brown. The pizza was burnt. Wings were very blah. It's a nice spot, so we hope the owner steps it up!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical about eating here. I ordered take out, and the food did not disappoint. I am curious to try other things on the menu and to dine in."}
{"text":"Our server, Felicia, was excellent.  Food was fantastic.  Was here with 3 other people and we all ordered something different.  Very impressed."}
{"text":"My first experience was positive. My subsequent visits were lackluster. The French toast was nothing  like French toast should be. Po  boy sandwich was really a poor boy sandwich. Poor. Service at night with no one in the restaurant. Slow. A half hour for a Cesar salad and they charge you before you get your meal. I'd rather see an I-HOP here instead."}
{"text":"Well.. as the say goes, you've got to try everything twice (just to make sure you didn't like it the first time).  We've tried this place 8 times since moving to Laveen (both dine in and take out) and I hate to say they have only been marginal at the dine in.  Every take out experience has been poor.  From incorrect orders to incomplete orders to just plain poor service.  Tonight, I hate to say, was their last chance with us and they failed.  Ordered a to go order.  Was told 20 min.  Arrived 25 min after placing the order (we live 5 min away).  Order wasn't ready.  Had to wait an additional 25 minutes (45 min total for a take out pizza) and then the the order was both incomplete and cold.  This tells me it sat in the back for a period of time before it was brought ought.    This reeks of either incompetence by the front cashier or plain vindictiveness.  Either way you've lost $150-200 a month revenue from this customer.  At least with the competition the product is delivered warm."}
{"text":"Where do I start.... This place takes the cake when it comes to bad restaurants. I read the review and thought \"no way could this place be that bad\" so I tried it. First, I really think that the servers are also the cooks because they disappear until they bring the food out. The food that was being served was worse then fast food items. It all seemed freezer burned and the taste was horrendous (minus the onion rings, they were actually pretty good).the food took about an hour to arrive and we only ordered a appetizer and a small pizza, which both came out very dry. About three groups around us left because of the wait. Everyone was easily waiting over an hour for their food. I probably would have left but I was watching a game on TV.  This place needs to make huge changes before it's too late."}
{"text":"Waiting one whole hour for two breakfast plates(and counting). Family next to us has been waiting longer, when their food came out it came out in parts. There are 6 people there and their food has been delivered piecemeal over the last ten minutes. They asked to speak to the manager. Another couple cancelled their order after more than an hour wait. People are still being seated, which I don't understand. Hands down worst wait I've encountered. The place is not overly busy but seems very disorganized."}
{"text":"Went to have breakfast this morning in the bar to watch some football games and the whole dining area smelt like raw sewage. It was awful. Had to leave. This was our go to breakfast spot but it's so dirty in there I always tried to look past it. Now with that smell we are done. Won't go back. We drove 7 miles down the road to a sports bar that offers breakfast but I doubt I can even eat because my stomach is so upset from that smell."}
{"text":"Same management and workers from old Native. Still horrible service and food. Except now they can also ruin breakfast food."}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast and ordered a waffle with I'm  candied bacon. Yum! My husband ordered a two egg breakfast. The service was awesome, but the food was just okay. I had to return the waffle to be cooked longer, but it had good flavor.  One piece of bacon was rubbery, the second too crisp (microwaved?) and the potatoes were hard and crunchy. Don't know if we will come back, but I'm sure they will improve with time."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time I have tried them for breakfast in 4 days. The first time last Saturday ordered there \"double play\" to go. When I got home the food was cold and tasteless. Not to mention the eggs were not cooked as ordered. The next day we had out of town guest in so we thought that is about the only spot for breakfast in the area. We walked in at 11:30am and asked if they were still serving breakfast, the hostess looked at her watch and said \"NO\". I asked what time they stopped for future reference and she said \"noon\" I said \"well it is only 11:30 now.\" She then said \"they were out of pancake batter so they stopped breakfast all together\". We decided that we would find another spot for breakfast and drove downtown. Our last attempt was this morning. I called in our order, which was the exact same thing I ordered Saturday. I though for sure that the poor food was a fluke and wanted to give them another shot. When we brought it home (which is less then 2 miles from Greathouse) The food was once again horrible. I am sorry but it should be pretty hard to screw up bacon, eggs, toast and potatoes but they managed to. Again, the eggs where not at all what I ordered. The food tasted like leftovers and the portions where extremely small.  I was really hoping that when they transformed from Native this would be a good go to spot. However, said to say but I don't we will ever go back. May just try the restaurant at the golf course instead."}
{"text":"I remember the manager here from when it was Native. He wasnt very attentive to his customer service then and nothing has changed. Walked in for lunch on a Saturday. Limited staff, dirty tables and some with cleaning rags just sitting on the table and trash on the floor. You can tell by looking around that the owner takes no pride in this place. Wish I wouldve known before I walked in.  I wouldve went elsewhere. This place will fail within the year."}
{"text":"If I could rate this restaurant a -1 I would.  My family and I was told that this was a new great restaurant to try for breakfast. Once we ordered and received the drinks that's when it became a disappointment. \"My coffee was cold\" Then when the food arrived the French Toast was literally 3 piece of toast that looked like it was from The toaster and sprinkled powered sugar on it. Needless to say I tasted one bite and didn't eat anymore. The eggs where cold and my sons pancakes were cold. I overheard the people behind us and they were complaining to the waitress for for the long wait for their food and when the food arrived it was cold. We will not be going back."}
{"text":"Recently went to Greathouse sports grill, which was previously a franchised Native New Yorker. The owner decided to branch out away from the franchise and I can say it was a good choice. The menu has tons of items that cater to whatever you may be in the mood for. I started with some spicy honey mustard wings, the sauce and crunch on the wings was great. Next I ordered the Arizona burger, although it was a bit more on the well side from what I ordered, the flavor and juiciness was still there. Staff was super friendly and attentive. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"We were very hesitant to give GreatHouse a try due to the bad reviews on Yelp...but we were game! So happy we did give the place a try for dinner. Very clean, including bathrooms, staff was very pleasant, the food was great - large portions and very good! Our server, Nicky, was very attentive, polite and friendly!!!! We were very pleased with our experience and look forward to our next time!!!!"}
{"text":"I Will never go there again I always hear horrible things about this place and I should have listened it's not the food it's not the service it's the lack of pride in their establishment. when you first walk in it's dingy and you can smell the bathrooms they're located right in front of the front door we went and sat in the bar area for lunch around 1130 the walls are beat up, the windows are dirty, and there was trash on the floor.I went in with my two-year-old son and we ordered off the lunch menu and like I said the food was good not great but decent my son had to use the restroom so I took him into the restroom and it was a disaster it look like it had not been cleaned in a few days it wasn't just the toilet area it was the whole place and I was not going to let my son use their bathroom so I had to quickly get a check and drive home so he would be able to sit in a clean facility. I wish the owners of The establishment would take pride in what they have there's not many restaurants here in Laveen so I feel they think can get away with running a half ass business but hopefully when this freeway goes in and more restaurants come in and I don't see this one lasting."}
{"text":"This place is as bad as the native New Yorker. I had nachos that were 11 dollars that came on a rectangle plate and it was SO GROSS I couldn't finish them. For what I paid I thought I was getting a plate of nachos big enough to feed the family. My husband got an 11 dollar burger that made Carl's Jr. fancy. I'm so sad because I really want a good restaurant to eat at here in Laveen. Scooptacular is not dinner, though I wish it was"}
{"text":"Service is slow. My wife's coffee came out cold. Then her food came out cold. Our eggs were cold. French toast looked like it was toasted then sprinkled with powdered sugar.   The people sitting next to us was also complaining about cold pancakes. Sad to see this rebranded restaurant failing to meet the basic expectation of its customers.   We won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"My wife and I tried their lunch menu and the food was actually good. The waiter staff was on top of it and kept our glasses filled. Looking forward to trying out their green chili recipe and their happy hour while watching a game. I was also told that they are planning on having a DJ on the weekends. This just might be one of our favorites."}
{"text":"The only good part was the hostess jokes. The food was cold the fries were stale and I've never been so thirsty in my whole life. I'm very unhappy."}
{"text":"Bad, bad, bad! Poor service. Food was barely passable.  Steer clear of this place. Pork chops came out like jerky. Asparagus was the size of a spaghetti noodle. Ribs tasted like they were microwaved. Charge $2.75 for drink and they never refilled our table. Waitress had absolutely no personality and seemed to hate her job."}
{"text":"Family went to Greathouse Grill on Thursday evening 8/4/2016 and we were very disappointed.  We had to wait an hour and half for our food from the time we sat down.  We ordered 10 buffalo wings as an appetizer and it didn't come until the end of dinner.  My wife ordered the ribeye steak and the waitress did not ask how she wanted it prepared and it came to the table burned.  My son's grilled chicken fettuccini was over cooked and hard.  Daughter's kid sliders did was not how she ordered.  Overall, this was the second time we experienced the long delay in food delivery.  We will not be back.  I would not recommend eating here and this is very sad because there are no decent restaurants in our area.  I would rather drive  out of the area than eat here again.  To be fair they took off 15% from our bill."}
{"text":"Ummm...where do I start. So despite all the negative reviews, I decided to give this place a try. Support local business, right? WRONG.   Breakfast menu is fairly simple. 1st turn off is there's no kids menu. Laveen is a fairly family oriented neighborhood with kids. Get a kids menu. Second turn off, a glass of Orange juice cost $3.99. Really?!?!   We ordered the French toast plate and the pancake sandwich plate. My friend's French toast had a bad after taste in which she didn't finish two slices. We asked for real eggs cooked to order and they tasted like egg substitute which I can't stomach. The pancake sandwich was blah. The pancake batter tasted like it came from a box instead of from scratch. The country potatoes were pretty good.   Maybe my expectations are too high for breakfast, but I definitely think they need to reexamine some things if they want to stay in business. I know for myself I won't be returning. It might be beneficial for them to do a gathering and allow the community to sample some dishes and suggest ideas and take feedback from patrons."}
{"text":"I ordered Suicide Napalm and in the description it said Ghost pepper wings, but they came out late, wings were soggy, and they were not even spicy, Mcdonalds Hot and spicy sandwich is hotter than these wings. Also when the manager came to take the food away he didn't even ask if I wanted anything else, good thing he didn't ask me because the food here is terrible. The customer service from my waitress was not even that good and from the manager was not good with customer service. I do not recommend this restaurant. only thing that I liked here was the coffee I ordered too. So disappointed."}
