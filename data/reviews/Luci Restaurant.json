{"text":"To be fair, I came here for a Christmas party, so there was a large group of us.

My steak was cold (maybe because they had to serve a large party).

There was a waitress there that seemed always bothered when we asked for another drink.

The waitors we had that night were all polite though.

There was no vegetarian option on our set menu. When I asked the waitress if they had a vegetarian option for my vegetarian co-worker, she pointed to the fish option. I had to explain to her that this is not a vegetarian option, as my friend does not eat any kind of animal. 
Eventually she suggested a mushroom risotto, she brought out an asparagus risotto instead..sure, why not.

Anyways, I had heard good things about this place, so maybe, I might try it out another time, however, based on this experience alone, I wouldn't bother, so many other places that I can try out.

There is a delicious cheese tray with dried fruits and jams that I would suggest though.

Also, they can accommodate larger, private parties...so something to keep in mind."}
{"text":"I visited luci last night. Not bad overall. Service lacked personality. Food was decent. The table next to me had some sort of coupon. They argued with the server and management for a bit while we paid full freight for our evening. I remember when this space was a live music joint called Momos, I would have preferred that."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon for Luci Restaurant as it is in our neighbourhood and had been wanting to try it. (summer 2015)  Took my husband, my daughter and her boyfriend for dinner. Service was impeccable and staff really made you feel welcome. Food was amazing. We all had different entrees. Very romantic with a great ambiance. Will be back."}
{"text":"Came across this place through Groupon and the best finding ever. The staff is amazing the ambience is romantic and was perfect for the occasion. Was here at luci to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. The food was amazing would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We came here tonight with a Groupon deal, and were very pleased with both the food and the service. 

The Groupon deal includes 2 soup/salad, 1 appetizer, 2 main courses and 2 desserts. 

Soup/salad: My boyfriend ordered the Cesar Salad and I ordered the Burrata as our server recommend. Both salads were very good!

Appetizer: We ordered the Calamari Due Modi which comes with a few fried calamari and a couple grilled calamari. My only complaint for this dish is the grilled calamari was a little burned and it tastes quite bitter. 

Entrees: I ordered the Linguini Pescatore, and it was great. My boyfriend got the T-bone and it was outstanding as well! 

Desserts: Creme Brulee and the bread pudding were very tasty. We were both very full at this point but we still finished the desserts! 

Service: The service was fantastic and our server was very nice. However, because I came here on a busy friday night, it seems to me that the servers can't quite keep up with the flow. It'll be great if they can add more people to the floor.

Overall, Luci is a fantastic restaurant and we'll definitely come back and visit again!"}
{"text":"We went on a weekday and used our Groupon. I read the reviews and wasn't too happy when people waited for a few hours for their order. So its either let the Groupon expire or wait for the food.

The restaurant is small but has a romantic ambiance. It can probably fit 30-40 people. The waiter asked for our coats and immediately seated us. They only had 2 waiters/server that time but I was surprised because they served the food quickly.
We didn't have to wait, We ordered salad and soup for the appetizer, the crab seafood cake for antipasti, for the entree, the AAA ribeye steak and the lamb chop, for dessert tiramisu and cheesecake.

5 stars for the customer service - the waiter was friendly, attentive and polite unlike other restaurants that I've been to. 

4.5 stars for the food, the steak was good, its just that the cheesecake was too sweet for my taste."}
{"text":"Dropped by last night without reservations and they were able to accommodate us... food and service here was really good! Definitely worth trying if you're around the area... prices are pretty reasonable... other than the Caesar salad which I found a little on the pricey side. Other than that entrees and wine were very reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Went for a date there with Groupon coupons. Took me a while to figure out what to order with the deal's conditions. The maitre d was a really nice lady who explained repeatedly what options we had. Quality of food was excellent, wine was exquisite (the date picked the bottle) and service was pleasant. The only thing, which is kind of my fault anyway, Luci is quite a formal place and when I went, there were mostly established folks, so if you think about getting a table - call ahead and dress accordingly. Wish I wore my dinner jacket and tie to enjoy the experience completely, but hey, can't complain when a date goes well."}
{"text":"Love this place ,they treat you like family food is awesome must try burrata appetizer as as beef tenderloin so great.Any desert that you take will be awesome even for the most picky ones out there,it is not cheep but not too expensive  when you compere it  with any steakhouse in Toronto"}
{"text":"We have visited this restaurant twice now and are planning on visiting again in the next month. Owner/manager greets all of his tables and makes them feel welcomed regardless of if you have a Groupon or not. Food is fantastic, service is excellent and atmosphere is perfect for a first date or a business meeting or a night with your family! We love Luci!"}
{"text":"I have only good things (mostly hah) to say about this restaurant! It is a small restaurant, that is very elegant in decor and ambiance.  We had a large party (20 people) here for a birthday and were seating to the side in a private room.  The service was really great, the fixed menu that the girl planned with the owner/manager was fantastic - it was a 4 course meal (shared antipasto platter).  The only thing is that many of us ordered the striploin steak and it wasn't cooked to order for a few of us (too rare for medium steaks).  
I would come back here if I was looking for a place to dine in this area. If you live around here, definitely give the restaurant a chance!"}
{"text":"We bought a Groupon for this place and it was pretty good, but I wouldn't pay full price.

Our Groupon included 2 aps, 1 antipesto, 2 mains and 2 deserts.
I thought we would be STUFFED but we were just full. 

I ordered a glass of white wine ($6.50) not included in the groupon and my date ordered a beer they have ontap. The beer was $9 and it really was not great at all for $9.

I ordered the Grilled Vegetable and Goat Cheese appetizer, the crab/seafood cake antipesto, filet minion main and lemon cheesecake desert.
My date ordered the house soup, the mint lamb chops and ice cream sandwhich.

Both aps were very good, but the salads are VERY small, actually all courses are very small. The filet and lamb were VERY good but the portions are tiny (esp the lamb). The steak was cooked to perfection though.

  Also the ice cream sandwhich was not very good at all but the cheesecake wasnt bad (again i would never pay $9 for it) as it was about 3 bites and was okay. Nothing rave worthy.

The service was slow at first, took them 10 minutes to take our drink orders.
Also, make sure you make a reservation as it was pretty busy.

It was a good time and okay food, however I don't think we would be back without a Groupon.

3 stars for the food, one taken off for tiny portions and another taken off for slow service."}
{"text":"Brought my wife here for our Anniversary and I have to say the food and service was outstanding ( mind you we went on a Monday and we literally had the restaurants to ourselves ) with the exception of one thing.

We had bought the Groupon deal for $60 and on top of the deal we decided to get a bottle of wine ~$28. When the bill arrived we had an outstanding owing of $48 instead of the $28 plus tax, when asked about it the waiter expressed that the taxes are added to the value of the meal not the actual price paid. I find that sneaky for a upscale restaurant to do. I decided not to fight it since we had a great time and did not wanted to spoil the moment, and I just paid the bill"}
{"text":"Went here on a Groupon yesterday and as someone had mentioned earlier. Not sure that I would go without one. 

I had the grilled vegetable + goat cheese salad to start (as someone else also mentioned, TINY portion), it was delicious though! In terms of antipasti, we had the Antipasti itself and the Basquetino. The Basquetino is delicious if you like mushrooms. For the main I had the Linguini Pescatore which was just OK. The tiramisu for dessert was probably the best dessert ordered at our table (group of 4) and my favourite course. We got here at about 7:15 and didn't leave until almost 10:30, service is reallyyyy slow and food takes forever to come out even if you order all your courses at once.

Also they charge tax on the VALUE of the Groupon - which I've never seen before in any of the Groupons I've used, considering how can you tax money that you weren't paid? I've always been taxed on what I actually paid for the Groupon. 

I do however, have to mention that the people who worked there were exceptionally friendly and the owner does make a personal visit to all the tables. The ambiance is great and it feels like you're dining downtown."}
{"text":"Excellent service, delicious authentic food with a special flare that made stand out from many Italian restaurants. Will come back - very good value and has a friendly charm."}
{"text":"Not sure about the mediocre reviews I have read, but our experience was great.  The location isn't great (sketchy strip plaza in etobicoke) but once inside the decor and ambience is fantastic and you are transported to a happy place. Like some other reviewers we discovered Luci with the 4-course groupon deal. Service was exceptional from taking our coats on arrival until the end. It was Friday night and there was plenty of staff.  Food came very quickly.  Someone else mentioned that portions were small, not true unless your usual dinner out is a buffet!  We left stuffed and would not have ordered all that food had we just come to eat without the groupon prix fix.  Also very impressed that they did not exclude any of the higher priced menu items considering what we paid.  Wine list was extensive with many reasonably priced options (under $60) and a handful of other special occasion options.

Salads were good; I had the arugula and my wife had Caesar. We did think it was odd that the Caesar came with extra dressing on the side - why not just make it perfect in the kitchen and serve? But it was good. Calamari was a treat served both grilled and fried. Seafood pasta and veal entrees were both delicious.  Bread pudding was good, a little doughy in texture though.   The cheese tray was incredible, especially at $12.  They could easily charge a little more for this.  The uncharged us $3 on the groupon for it (typical dessert price is $9) which we happily paid.

My gold standard for Italian is Via Allegro further west on the Queensway. It remains my favourite, but Luci is a close second."}
{"text":"This was one of those local Queensway restos that I have to support.  Plenty of competition from other establishments.  You can't tell from the website of their restaurant what their food is like.  

The beginning didn't start off too well.  I had made a reservation using their online system.  The email came back as invalid. Their twitter account was infrequently used and only pushed their product.  Nevertheless, we took a chance in going in.  Not that it mattered because there weren't many tables filled. 

 We were greeted by a French waitress who seemed pretty friendly.  The printed menu was off.  Someone forgot to used left or centre-justified.  

Then between the time we got our drinks to the time to order, it was well over 15 minutes.  From there it went uphill.

We ordered the Linguini Gamberi (shrimp) and Gnochetti Sardi (Chicken confit with sauce).  The owner/manager asked if I wanted to try the pepperoncini.  Of course given my taste buds, I couldn't resist.  I was very spicy, yet tasty.  It didn't spoil at least my Gnochetti.  Very flavourful dishes.  

When the desserts came around, we were disappointed that the Nutella Bread pudding was off the menu.  They must have redone the menu because the waiter cam back and we were in luck.  Why would they have taken that off the menu if it's absolutely delectable.  I had the vanilla cheesecake, which was awesome as well.  

Although we had many servers at our table, the overall experience was pretty good.  I just think they should take the time to promote their business even more so with social media, an improved look on the menu and it will make their end product that much better. It would be a shame to waste such excellent talent and food if they don't pay attention to detail."}
{"text":"Ok, let's be honest we don't normally eat at places like this. We like to think of ourselves as more adventurous. But this is the second visit here and the service and food is amazing. Fresh mushroom soup without excessive amounts of cream. Steak cooked to perfection. Sorbets - raspberry with lime. Go be happy."}
{"text":"Loved it. We got a Groupon dinner for 2, and got great service, the food was delicious, and the environment welcoming.

Our server went out of his way and found wine that we really wanted and brought it to us by glass. We were celebrating a special occasion and it was indeed a very pleasant outing.

Will be coming back soon."}
{"text":"We came here with a Groupon, and it was a very pleasant neighbourhood surprise.

First, the service: fantastic.  You can tell they care because they have a lot of staff on hand, prepared to take care of their customers.  They were all well groomed, ready to serve.

Food was also very good, surprisingly pleasant given how far from the core this place is.  Besides Sushi Kaji, I'm not sure what other places in the area could offer high-end quality food.

Wine list, pastas, pricing... all very fair.  I would go back, if we have the budget to splurge as well as wanting to stay close to home."}
{"text":"Came here with a Groupon ($70 for a 4 course dinner for two) on a Wednesday night. 

Pros 
- Excellent service 
- Quick, efficient and professional 
- Relaxing ambiance 

Cons
- A little pricey 
- Food was average"}
{"text":"The bread and black bean dip was fantastic 
Did not care to much for the grilled calamari but the breaded version is much tastier.
Ceaser salad was very tasty and to top it off , the bone in steak was superb"}
{"text":"I came here tonight with the 4-course groupon deal, with 6 people. The groupon was good for 4 soups/salads, 2 antipasti, 4 entrees and 4 desserts. Just to put it out there, the service was no way compromised just because we came with a groupon - the waitress and waiter were extremely attentive, non-disruptive and incredibly accommodating. 

At first glance, the ambiance seemed warm and inviting; the banquettes were also super comfortable and plush (it felt a bit low, but I'm just short). To start, they gave us a bread basket (baguette and focaccia - both made in house) with a chickpea/vegetable spread on the side. Delicious; if I didn't have a full meal coming up, I would've inhaled the entire basket + dip and have left pretty satisfied. 

To start, I had the caesar salad. Romaine was fresh, but the dressing wasn't as cheesy or garlicky as I'd like. The rest of my family opted for the soup of the day, which happened to be stracciatella, an italian egg drop soup. Although I didn't try it, it looked good and my family had good reviews for it. 

Next, we had 2 antipasti; calamari done two ways (fried and grilled), and a crab, scallop and shrimp cake. The calamari was super tender, but a tad under seasoned for my liking. The CSS cake was much better; it was fork tender, had a crispy coating, and was served with a vinegary onion and tomato relish. 

For my main, I ordered a whole sea bass; it came with a balsamic dressed arugula salad with mandarin slices, and some orzo with a basil pesto. The sea bass was GREAT; not overly fishy, moist, tender, with crispy skin 10/10 recommend. I also had a taste of the lamb chops with a chimichurri sauce - also excellent; although I'm not a huge fan of lamb, I would definitely order it next time I come. 

Dessert!! I tried 4 items: a nutella bread pudding with banana ice cream, tiramisu, chocolate truffle cake and a cheesecake with berries. All amazing, with maybe the exception of the chocolate cake; it was a little dense and butterscotch-y for my liking. 

TLDR: 10/10 would come again. Food. Was. Bomb."}
{"text":"Delicious! Amazing service and very cozy yet sort of fine dining but not stuffy. Everyone seemed to have the Groupon for this restaurant as did we. Without the group prices are a bit high but the taste and quality are worth it. The beef carpaccio is so well done, and the calamari is done two ways - grilled and fried. Both are superb and you get a quite generous portion. The veal chop and t-bone steak cooked to perfection. The best is the pavlova dessert with a berry compote and sorbet. I would forgo my main course and just have 3 desserts. The creme brulee is also really good."}
{"text":"What shocks me most about Luci is not that it gets generally high marks from various online sites but that the fairly tough Toronto Star gave it a *** review only a couple of years ago. Amy Pataki is a very solid restaurant critic and three stars from her usually means that the place is money. But in this case I have to fairly strongly disagree with her pretty much across the board. Also please note that although I'm only posting my Yelp! review now, I actually ate there in February of 2012, the same time hers was published. So although it has been a couple of years, I really have no inclination to go back and give it a second chance. 

The initial impressions walking in were quite positive, a decor that said upscale but not stuffy. My party was greeted warmly, promptly seated and offered water. Off to a good start. Sadly, the same level of service did not continue throughout the meal. While certainly polite, it would be a stretch to call our service attentive. Please note that it wasn't especially busy, simply a typical Saturday night. We were asked if we wanted wine (which of course we did), though only once. Our glasses were refilled but we were never asked if we wanted a second bottle...I can't remember the last time that's happened to me, especially for a party of four. We certainly would have sprung for it had they asked but they didn't bother so neither did we. Also there really was no \"how is everything\", other than perhaps once after our appetizers arrived and there certainly should have been considering how the food turned out.

Two of us ordered the Caesar Salad ($9.50) and it was an embarrassment. The salad itself was very small, which would have been fine had it not been so lacking in every way. The flavour was nonexistent, to the point where they actually included small bowls of extra salad dressing on the side for some reason, as if to say \"we know this may be bland, so feel free to add more dressing\". I've never come across that. Not to mention the fact that both plates had perhaps two croutons each and three very small strips of shaved parmesan. But the worst part? The salads were wet and it doesn't seem as though they had bothered to dry the lettuce at all.

The Insalata di Rape Rose ($8.50) was much better flavour wise, but correct me if I'm wrong: doesn't that translate into \"Beet Salad\"? Well, much like the parmesan on the Caesar, the amount of actual beets on the plate was miniscule. The crab cakes ($12.00) were good, but again a major problem: there was a fairly sizable shell found inside. Choking or chipping a tooth is not something one expects while eating crab cake. 

As for the mains, the problems continued. The Spaghetti Dal Mare ($22.00) tasted a little like chow mein. A filet mignon ($28.00) which was ordered medium-well was quite clearly well-done. Not impressed. And the mashed potatoes that accompanied it were absolutely stone cold when they arrived. This was the one complaint we did actually voice at the time and at least they were replaced with ones that were actually hot, if somewhat pedestrian. Happily for me the dish I ordered, the Fettuccini di Nonna ($15.00), was delicious, a lovely blend of goat cheese, eggplant, tomato sauce and mint. It was the only real winner of the evening, so far as I was concerned. 

The Crème Brulee ($9.00) was very tasty to be sure, but not for what you're paying. For example North 44's Crème Brulee is four dollars more but I'd have paid double. With it, you're in desert paradise. Luci's was just trip to Orlando by comparison.

Luci may not be a terrible place but it's also not three out of four. Not even remotely close. There were positives but there was also A LOT wrong here. If I could describe Luci Restaurant in one word it would probably be \"careless\". Wet lettuce, indifferent service, cold potatoes, overcooked steak and a stray crab shell? Simply put, it's not worth it. There's no shortage of similar places in the area and unless I'm getting a free meal, I'm going to try one of them instead."}
{"text":"Went to celebrate my brother's birthday last weekend 
It is in my area and never been there before 
The service was excellent, the staff was attentive and helpful 
The food was very good 
We ordered different appetizers to be shared. I liked the grilled calamari, Cheese board, 
The portions were on the smaller side, good for the stomach and not for the wallet 
Had English cat fish for dinner and it was really good and the accompaniments nicely prepared. 
I would also return for the ambiance. Definitely one of the more upscale finer dining experiences on the Queensway. 
Enjoy"}
{"text":"Celebrated my 40th bday here.  My cousin had a groupon for 4 to dine.  We were able to order from the main menu, with no limits.  

Apps - Each of us ordered something different and we were all impressed with our salads. I had the Baby Burrata with fresh tomatoes & basil... fresh, cold, and delicious!  I had a mouthful of their scrumptious argula salad and it was so fresh with the perfect complementary dressing!

Antipasti - 4 of us shared 2 antipastis... grilled calamari was perfectly seasoned, not rubbery.  The Crab, Shrimp & Scallop cake melted in your mouth and so moist!  The best crab cakes I've ever had!

Entrees - I had the whole grilled seabass and it was AMAZING!!!  The fish came out HOT and they de-boned it for me at the table.  Nicely seasoned and definitely not salty.  I just loved this dish!

The only surprise was the tax on the VALUE OF THE TOTAL meal ordered, which was surprising.  I don't usually mind tipping on the total value, but I've never been taxed on the total.

Other than that surprise, I was overall very happy with the experience.  If you want to treat yourself to great eats, pleasant venue, and excellent service, come to Luci Restaurant!  You won't regret it!!!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful discovery! Because I'm new to Toronto, I haven't ventured too far out of the city when it comes to restaurants, but in the past couple of months, I've been discovering quite a few nice places through Groupon. in fact, I doubt I would have ever found out about this place had it not been for Groupon.

The deal was for two soups/salads, one shared antipasto, two entrées and two desserts for $70. We started with a Caesar salad each, then shared the beef carpaccio. Both were really good. For my main, I chose the risotto with truffled mushrooms and veal cheeks. It was a very good portion, and the rice was perfectly cooked. Great flavour. too; I only wish the parmesan cheese had been freshly grated instead of the powdery stuff. Would've tasted so much better. My friend said his pasta dish was amazing. I don't recall which one it was, but they make their pasta in-house, so that makes a huge difference. 

For our desserts, he chose the crème brulée and I had the pavlova. It didn't quite live up to the best one I've ever had (at Joe Fortes in Vancouver), but it was pretty good. 

As good as the food was, what really impressed us was the service. Our waiter was very friendly, and the manager (owner?) was also walking through the restaurant to make sure everyone was happy with their meals. Our wine & water glasses were replenished in a timely manner and everything was done with a smile. It really does make a difference to your dining experience. Would definitely return here, Groupon or not."}
{"text":"My husband and I dined here tonight for our anniversary. The ambience was romantic and the service was exquisite! Our servers were very attentive and offered wonderful service.

Now for the food... We had a Groupon for a 4 course meal for 2. I had the Cesar salad and my hubby had the wild mushroom soup.  Both appetizers were great! I would've liked my salad to have a bit more garlic though. The maple bacon on the salad was to die for! My hubby enjoyed his soup. The calamari were fresh and cooked to perfection. Entrees: I had the T-bone steak (very very yummy) and my hubby had linguine with seafood. We both enjoyed our entrees thoroughly. Dessert: I had Nutella bread pudding and hubby had creme brûlée. He loved his dessert, mine was alright... The bread pudding didn't have a \"Nutella\" feel... It was more of an espresso bread pudding with cocoa sprinkled on top, but nonetheless it was still good. 

All in all we had an amazing time and we'd definitely go again. Ps. The bread basket was great. They served it with a chickpea and roasted vegetable puree.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Found this place via Groupon. Loved it! What great find. We plan to be back for their fixed menu for $25. Groupon deal was a lot of food for the price. Well worth it. We now have a new place to go when we want a treat from the everyday."}
{"text":"Here for a group meeting.  Excellent private room and catering to the group. Attentive wait staff and excellent dining. Impressive place to visit and one of the first class Italian restaurants in Etobicoke."}
{"text":"Super happy with the experience.  We each bought 2 groupon for 2 people and had a great double datenight.  From the moment we walked in the host greeted us warmly and made us feel very relaxed the whole night.  Food were excellent.   Serving portion are not what we expected , we were so full after everything. Fresh soup/salad,  the calamari is oooh sooo good,  veal chop and tenderloin were done just right  and the desserts are superb,  love love the pavlava  I would definitely come back and try the other items on the menu.  Great food &  great service!"}
{"text":"Confession:  Groupon + positive reviews brought me here.  At $62 for a 4-course dinner for 2 people, price wasn't bad especially considering the portions.  

Low-down:
Zuppa Del Giorno - was a wild mushroom/potato puree was quite bland.  Server said there was dairy, but I didn't taste any cream.  

Burrata - basically a Caprese.  This was fine, cheese tasted nice and fresh.  You can't really screw this one up.

Calamari - Some came lightly battered, while the rest were grilled and tossed into a salad.  Battered was better than grilled, grilled lacked flavour.  Not the best, but not the worst calamari that I've had.  On the bland side

Cod Ravioli - Pastas are made in-house, but it was bland and too al dente/chewy.  It was tossed in olive oil, so if you're looking for pasta with sauce, order another dish.

Black Cod in Tagine - to be expected, it had more flavour than the ravioli, but more on the sweet side as it had slices of mandarin oranges in the sauce.  At this point, I was stuffed from everything else, so I brought the rest home

On the other hand, desserts were really good!  Too bad, I was a bit too full to enjoy them.  According to the menu, someone else makes the desserts.

I really wanted to like this place 'cause the service is molto simpatico!  However, top-notch service is much, much  better than the food itself.  Half of the food that I had from the soup, calamari, to ravioli was on the bland side."}
{"text":"Walked into the restaurant for an 830 reservation. It seemed like no one noticed us (two) for the first 5 minutes or so. We actually kept up with the timing of when they would see us. They were so busy there that all the waiters and waitresses had their hands full of plates and there were dirty glasses all over the counter that we first lay our eyes on. It just didn't look too impressive, but as a yelper who loves food, I'm still waiting for it. 

We had a couple waiters come to us saying that the maître'd will come serve us. When he did, we got seated for approx 15 minutes before we got served water. By that time, we already figured out what we want to eat from the groupon coupon we had. (2 apps, 1 antipasiti, 2 entrees, 2 desserts) ($69)  
We quickly ordered our food and noticed that the table next to us had the wrong entree ordered and served to them. The waiter told them that it would be a 45-60 minute wait in order to change it. It must have been a jungle in there because there were so many people and many plates flying out and in the kitchen. 

My boyfriend and I decided to take this date to come here because it was reviewed as the top 10 restaurants out of 6500 in Toronto so we thought it'd be nice to try. 

We timed that our appetizer (mozzarella and tomatoes + arugula salad) came another 20 minutes after our ordering and our antipasti (beef carpaccio) came 10 minutes after we finished our apps. We waited almost an hour until our entree came and by that time we wanted to pack it up and go because it was already 1045. So basically we spent 2.5 hours at the restaurant waiting for our entree (rainbow trout + lamb chops) to come and we didn't even get to eat it because we weren't even hungry anymore because of the wait. I was really disappointed as I had read reviews that this place was amazing.

We just wanted our desserts by then and we ordered the creme brulee and tiramisu. Both of which were amazing and to-die-for! It was so worth the wait!

The waiter was a young man and was super polite about it. He apologized a whole lot tonight about the wait times and how this hasn't happened before and he hopes we would come back because food is actually really good. How do you only have 3 chefs on a Saturday night???!?! But anyway I don't know if I would come back. If I do it would definitely be for the desserts and that nice young man waiter!"}
{"text":"Fantastic restaurant. Went tonight for a groupon deal with 4 people. Sea bass was excellent as was the olive oil used throughout the meal a sign of a good Italian restaurant. Left very full and satisfied. Service was great with constant friendly attention. Folks please tip on the full price not just the groupon price to be fair to the staff. Their attention certainly was not diminished by a coupon. Will be back."}
{"text":"Luci luci restaurant ...

I pick this restaurant out of the blue.  I have to said I did great !!! It was my husband birthday he enjoy everything !! The food was great . ...the atmosphere  great the wine ha ha very good as well ... the food I give it a 10/10... the waiter \"Georgie\"he was very good to us ... he told us the menu ... he's a great waiter...overall we would go back"}
{"text":"I went with a groupon.  2 salads, 1 antipasto, 2 mains, 2 desserts.

The arugula grilled artichoke salad with lemon dressing was excellent.  The squash summer soup was ok, it needed salt and herbs though.

The puff pastry with mushrooms in cognac cream was spectacular... If I'd been at home, I would have picked the bowl clean!

There are a few mains that you pay an upcharge for.  Including the lamb chops, which I ordered.  The extra $12 was DEFINITELY WORTH IT!  4 lamb chops, with a plethora of veg and potatoes.  Outstanding!

Risotto with mushrooms and veal cheeks also a winner!

The Nutella bread pudding with banana sorbet was incredible... The bread was panetonne, the Italian version of brioche, but fruit studded!  Unbelievable!

White chocolate cheesecake is also great!

Prices, even without the voucher, are quite reasonable.

Overall, I highly recommend Luci!"}
{"text":"I went there for dinner and was very disappointed with the food. Bland at best. The worst was when we got the bill. for 2, the total bill came to 100+, and that was with the groupon. I will not be going back. 
The service was good. the waiters and waitresses were great."}
