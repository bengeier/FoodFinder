{"text":"Seriously one of the best pizza places in mtl downtown because it tastes pretty good but price is unbelievable. Combo 1 is two cheese pizza slices with a drink and it's only $5. Plus if you are a student and order anything regular price, you get discounts. Pizza slices are large too. The store is clean and decent. They don't charge delivery fee. Honestly, i'd eat and order here than ordering from pizza pizza or domino's. And the owner is super nice and funny!"}
{"text":"I ordered a home delivery pizza. Pizza was good but the person at the customer service  was very rude. I don't know why I have this feeling but nowadays restaurant people are just getting rude. Same with pizza navona.

I wish customer service was good too because they have one of the best pizza. So i won't order again until and unless i am dying with pizza craving lol.."}
{"text":"The closest pizza place to McGill, and probably the best--although in Montreal, where good pizza is approximately as common as a unicorn, that's not saying much. But they do offer homemade chili oil, which can improve just about anything, and they're pretty nice. Besides, I'd much rather eat at Navona than a chain."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery last night, haven't ever been in the restaurant. Fast delivery. Pizza was just ok though - seems kind of expensive for pizza that tasted about the same as some 99 cent pizza places! Nothing special. Ordered some wings as well and those were great! (Although I didn't get my sauce!)"}
{"text":"I will tell you way I gave this Pizza a 4 star rating: It is not a bad Pizza, not sure it is a 4 star maybe a 3 stars and there are better Pizza'a around like McGill Pizza But the value for money is pretty great less then 5$ for 2 slices+drink and less then 7 for 2 slices+toppings+drink. Furthermore they always support student projects like the McGill engineering team which is a big plus in my book, if you support the community the community must support you back right ?  and I always prefer a small family business over a big chain. 
bottom line good pizza, great price amazing people !"}
{"text":"Toppings, including cheese, were not generous. It was essentially a thin layer of dried out mozarella over bread. I liked the idea of bacon hawaiin, however, because the smokiness of the bacon and the sweet fruity flavour of the pineapple should make a good duo. That was unfortunately only half true: too few bacon and pineapple was dried out, which makes me wonder how many times my slice of pizza had been reheated or when it was baked.

And for the skeptics, I tried a slice of pepperoni pizza, it isn't worth 3$, either."}
