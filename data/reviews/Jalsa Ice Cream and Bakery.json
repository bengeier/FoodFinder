{"text":"Yummy and unique Indian ice cream/Bakery/coffee shop!  They serve the traditional popular ice cream flavors AND unique Indian inspired favors. We went just a day or two after they opened for business. The staff was friendly, welcoming and helpful.  I will definitely go back for more and to try their cupcakes and coffees."}
{"text":"A great place for Indian flavored ice creams. I tried the Meetha Paan and it was delicious. I'm not a fan of paan, but the ice cream was irresistible. You should surely try this place and explore all the different flavors they have to offer. Whenever I crave for a unique flavored ice cream, this is going to be my pick!"}
{"text":"I have been to Jalsa's three times and have enjoyed them more with each visit.  The first time I got a chocolate cupcake and a vanilla cupcake. The cupcakes were very moist and the frosting was fine--nothing special. But the second time i tried the coffee cupcake and it was AMAZING. I went back again the same week to get the coffee cupcake again. And now I wish I had one in my hand this second."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place! Great for all ages and all sweet lovers! It was so peaceful and happy! The cupcakes were fantastic and ice cream was yummy. How awesome they stay open late and staff was so friendly! Will always come here when I am in town. A must!"}
{"text":"Such great ice cream-- I got coffee but the fig was great too!! The cupcakes looked delicious as well. The customer service was extraordinary; she was patient and very helpful. And to top it all off the seating was awesome. We got to enjoy the couch area and listen to some great music."}
{"text":"My family was so excited to try the Indian flavors at Jalsa, but when we got there we were so disappointed. The staff was friendly and the shop was nice and clean, but the ice cream was pathetic. The Indian flavors were very muted and the ice cream was not very creamy. It seemed icy and not smooth. I had the mango and its flavor was barely present. The malai kulfi was a bit creamier but it came far from close to authentic kulfi. Overall, we were very disappointed!!"}
{"text":"Lots of ice cream choices and unique flavors! The girl helping us, Cassandra, was very friendly and helped us find flavors I didn't even know existed! Definitely worth a trip if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"The shop has a nice clean vibe! I had the cookies and cream and coconut cupcakes! Also sampled the unique flavors. The young lady behind the counter was super friendly and didn't make us feel bad for sampling so many flavors. The mango and saffron pistachio we really good! Can't wait to be back!"}
{"text":"Good variety of Indian and western flavors. We loved Meetha Pan (a must). Chiku and Sitafal flavors were not good."}
{"text":"So, this is the former location of \"Mind Over Batter\" cake shop. I was looking for some cupcakes for my wife's birthday and the reviews for Mind Over Batter were very good. The pictures of the cakes looked great too. When I arrived and saw it was now Jalsa I was disappointed but since they also had cupcakes I gave them a try. I picked up a lemon, vanilla, chocolate chip and toasted coconut for a total of over $16. I don't know when these were made but I could've thrown them through a glass window. They looked great but all four were hard and stale. The frosting was bland and overall I was very disappointed. My kids wouldn't even eat them. When an 8 and 6 year old won't eat cake you know it's bad. I can't speak for their ice cream but they need to get out of the cake business. I won't be back."}
{"text":"Looking for a cool sweet treat to cool off this sunny spring day, I found the new artisanal ice cream business, Jalsa! There is a human-sized ice cream cone in front and inside is very beautiful adorned with this gorgeous photo of a bridge within a cloud forest. 

Very fair prices for ice cream! :)
$2.96 single scoop
$3.76 double scoop
$4.86 triple scoop

The owners are Indian and here they carry a variety of unique flavors such as cardamon, fennel seed, rose, saffron pistachio, fig, chickoo, ginger, sitaphal, and cashew raisin. There are also other flavors like lychee, green tea, brownie, mango, butter pecan, cookies and cream, tutti fruitti and so much more!! Don't worry, you can sample as many flavors as you like before you make a choice. Our ice cream server was so nice as she described the various flavors and made helpful suggestions. 

Additionally if you need more sugar, there is a variety of delicious cupcakes! I had the coconut creme and it was so luscious and tasty, especially when I threw a dollop of ice cream on top. I will definitely be back very soon! :)"}
{"text":"This is a nice place to hangout. Great flavors. My favorite was the mango flavor. Pan masala gives u a kick, a must have. Lychee - malai kulfi were good too."}
{"text":"Moved away from the area six months ago and stopped next door for a pedi at my old salon. When my tech mentioned the shop next door had changed ownership, I decided to give them a try since the last place wasn't a favorite.

I'm so glad I did! The cupcake was delicious...gobbled up in the car before even leaving the parking lot after thinking I'd just have a little taste since it smelled soooo good!

The I've cream looks amazing (next time), and I'll report back on hubby's review of the brownie I'm taking home to allay my brownie guilt! (That is, if it even makes it home...)"}
{"text":"Arrived early to see a movie at Pollak Cinema and decided to check out this unassuming ice cream shop. Warm and inviting, clean, and comfortable.  Casandra welcomed us with a cheerful heart, explained the flavors, and invited us to sample those we were interested in.  I ordered Kaju Draksh and Lightly Gingered.  My girlfriend ordered Pineapple Coconut and Banana Nut. We also shared a Coconut Vanilla cupcake. 10s across the board. Will be back!"}
{"text":"So we discovered this gem on the way to the car after dinner next door. We ordered three cupcakes ; one coffee flavored, one cookies and cream and one red velvet as well as a cake pop. They were all delicious. The frosting is flavorful and the cake very moist. I liked the coffee one the best but the rest of the  family favored the red velvet but what do they know?  ;) 
The best thing about this place is that they are egg free! My daughter has an egg allergy so this was her first non vegan (read bland and cardboard tasting) cupcake. We will be back!"}
{"text":"My review would admittedly be a little higher had I not been such a huge fan of Mind Over Batter.  It may not be fair, but I found myself comparing this new enterprise with one of my old faves.  We did not have any ice cream, but we did have two cupcakes.  They were good.  No complaints, but no real wow factor either.  What we did love was the atmosphere.  It's a nice cool environment with comfortable seating and enjoyable contemporary music playing in the background.  That will probably bring us back a few more times.  Love that they continued a deal with Pollack Cinemas and give a discount for theater-goers."}
{"text":"This little bakery and cafe offers Indian Inspired flavored ice creams, regular ice cream, cake pops, cup cakes, coffee and more. It's a lovely sleek looking cafe with modern rich looking features. They offer mostly counter seating and do have two tiny tables.

They do offer you samples of the ice cream to try. I first tried saffron pistachio and the second one lightly ginger seemed better. My husband only sampled what I tried and just ordered the carrot halwa ice cream.

The ginger ice cream had a texture that was light and very unique. The flavor was intensely ginger and was sort of spicy but refreshing. I tried a taste of my husband's carrot halwa flavor ice cream. Both of us didn't care for this one mostly because of the greasy texture.

The girl working the counter was pleasant and efficient and the cafe seemed clean and spotless.

My main reason for the two star rating is that I was there forty minutes after they were open and not one baked good was ready for sale. I wanted to bring home some baked goods and I live far from here and I'm not always in this area so I doubt I'll be back.

This place has potential to be a gem but you have to get there when they are ready to be open for business."}
{"text":"Very interesting ice cream infused with Indian spices like saffron and cardamom. Apparently they have new ownership coming and will be called Red Lentil. They also have regular fare- my husband really liked the pistachio."}
{"text":"Sorry folks, I was not impressed. Don't get me wrong, I wanted to be.  

After having dinner at Flanny's we had an urge for something sweet to headed over to Jalsa. At the time we went the place was empty and the selection was very slim. I think it was a Sunday so that's understandable -- only a slight deduction for that. 

I inquired about the ice cream flavors and asked if they made some of the very exotic flavors that were there and she said no. Hmmm. That didn't resonate with me at all. If you're going to offer such different flavors, but you bought them from a vendor, how is that special?  It just seemed odd to me, especially if I'm paying THAT much for a scoop of ice cream. 

Second, my cupcake was not to die for. I don't remember the name and that's sad because again, a cupcake costing that much should be memorable. I think it was $3.00 or so. I could be that out of it and not realize that cupcakes are expensive. Regardless, they were too pricey for me, particularly in the calorie department.  

The space was nice and clean and the service so-so. I wish the woman working the counter showed more of her personality. Perhaps my experience would have been better. 

I love ice cream and my sweet treats, but I don't think I'm going back. I wish them all the best though. Small business owners have it so tough."}
{"text":"Best Indian ice cream!! Jalsa has an awesome assortment of both Indian and Traditional flavors. It has become a regular spot for grabbing ice cream for me and my friends! We love the meetha pan and malai kulfi flavors!!"}
{"text":"This place serves ice cream and few other dessert items like brownie sundaes, cupcakes, etc. I was impressed by the different types of ice cream they carried. Flavors ranged from the usual to more exotic flavors. I think they're Indian food-inspired ice cream, but I cannot confirm this since I didn't ask and since their website/social media is down. I was able to sample a lot of flavors and they were pretty good! However, a lot of them had freezer burn and didn't seem fresh. I got the falooda ice cream (I love falooda) and it was delicious! I would go back and get it again.

The facilities itself had nice aesthetics. It was pretty clean and well-maintained. Service was mediocre. The young lady working seemed to be in the \"scoop and go\" mindset. She gave me the impression that she didn't know very much about the flavors. I also didn't feel engaged by her after asking for recommendations. A lot of places have service like this, and it is ok. It just means service was average and nothing spectacular."}
{"text":"Very new ice cream shop  right next to my favorite Thai place. They have all sorts of ice cream. They even have some Indian inspired flavors. Personally, they are not for me. My wife loved them though. They have normal flavors as well and those are awesome. Nice way to top off the night."}
{"text":"Stopped by here today (we don't eat cupcakes very often) and didn't realise it wasn't \"that other bakery\" any longer.  Since I was already there I decided to give them a shot.  The cupcakes all look very pretty.  If this was based off of service, they would get a 5.  The young woman working that day was very friendly.  I came for cupcakes, but she was happy to let me try some of the interesting Indian inspired ice cream flavors too.  Interesting.  Not bad.  Interesting.

I ordered four different cupcakes.  All nice looking.  All incredibly dry.  I am a terrible baker and I could have made better cupcakes from a box.  The peanut butter frosting and the Oreo frostings were fine.  Nothing amazing, but I want the cake part to be the hero of the cupcake.  Not even close.  I sadly won't be back.  You get two stars for your awesome staff member.  Keep her around!  (I wish I caught her name).  Next time, I'll probably cross the street to Kneaders.  I'd also be better off at Safeway."}
{"text":"Stopped by with the family and wanted to try out the unique flavors. I ended up getting the saffron and pistachio nut. The saffron flavored ice cream tasted ok, but was hoping for a stronger flavor. The pistachio nut was the one that I had more issues around as even though it did have pistachios in it, it tasted very artificial. I will come back to try out some other flavors to see if the pistachio nut was just a one off..."}
{"text":"LOVE it! Cute little ice cream and dessert spot that is open late (thank you).. ice cream was to die for and looking forward to my cookie...very clean! Very sweet (no pun intended) girls working here and don't tell them but I think the prices are too cheap! Love it!"}
{"text":"I was afraid there would never be a bakery like Mind Over Batter that could replace it, but thankfully, I hear about Jalsa. When I visited, there was only one employee working and there were a lot of customers. Understandable, as it was a Saturday afternoon. Unlike Mind Over Batter, it's specialty is more of ice cream instead of baked goods. I wanted to sample all of the fun flavors, but was gracious to the people in line behind me and finished up quickly. I ordered one scoop of malai kulfi and another of gulkand. They tasted fantastic! I will return again to try the other flavors. The woman behind the counter was polite and patient and very helpful in making a selection."}
{"text":"In Hindi, Jalsa means: 

1) Celebration
2) Festival 
3) Fun 

And let me tell you, with those Indian inspired ice cream flavors, there will most certainly be a celebration going on in your mouth. 

Andrew C. and I dropped in on a whim last week after seeing Jalsa had opened up in the space once occupied by Mind Over Batter, aka \"The Salad Store\". Here's lookin' at you, Boo-Boo (Missy F.)! 

When we walked in, the shop was very clean and modern. Jay was quick to greet us and make us feel welcome and asked how we discovered the store. 

\"Uhhh ... You guys were setting up shop when I stopped by in February to bring cupcakes to my very sick BFF in the hospital?\" 

*halo!* 

Now, you should know that Jalsa also has cupcakes (have yet to try them) and your typical ice cream flavors.

But we made it clear to Jay that night that we were after those Indian delights, baby! 

Jay let us sample just about everything: Saffron, Mango, Lightly Gingered, and a ton of others I honestly cannot remember due to the intense sugar high.

I ended up getting the Rose; Andrew C. the Cashew Raisin.

The Rose was super creamy, light and refreshing - Something that doesn't always happen with ice cream. So good; the Rose flavor was very noticeable, but not overpowering or artificial.

Oh, and about the product: Jay told us that with the exception of a few flavors made by vendors, Jalsa's ice cream is made in house! 

And at just under $3 for a massive single scoop dish, how could you go wrong? 

Supporting local never tasted so good.

Pst, a carryover from the previous business: Bring your ticket stub from Pollack Cinemas next door, and get a free scoop!

I can't wait to come back, and being that Jalsa is less than two miles from our home, I anticipate more late night drives / walks for ice cream. Danger zone! ;)"}
{"text":"I am so glad this place exists! Go-To place when I'm craving Indian flavored ice-cream. Really loved the kesar pista, it's obviously creamy ice-cream but it has the perfect kulfi flavor. I really enjoyed the meetha paan flavor too, it's strong but awesome just what you expect out of a beetle leaf and fennel seeds. The rest were good too, sitaphal, malai kulfi, gulkand. Not tried the standard flavors or cupcakes. I'll give it a 5 just for the Indian flavored ice-cream it's that good."}
{"text":"Great place.. Great international flavors in ice cream .. We enjoyed it and will be regular customers .."}
{"text":"So long Mind Over Batter, hello Jalsa! This unique little sweet shop is kind of like the former store, except kicked up a notch. They have cupcakes and cake pops, and an extensive variety of ice cream. About half the flavors are Indian inspired with selections such as mango, cardamom, ginger, and saffron pistachio. The prices were very reasonable for the ice cream and scoops are quite generous. 

I sampled a few flavors (Saffron pistachio, sapota fruit, ginger) before deciding on the ginger, single scoop. All the samples overall had good flavor but had a grainy texture to them. I enjoyed the spicy kick of ginger flavor and it was a perfect sweetness. My friend asked for a half scoop of black cherry and a half scoop of banana nut and it looked like she got a full scoop each when she got her cup. She said she enjoyed the flavor of the banana nut especially.

The cupcakes and cake pops are beautifully decorated. I'll definitely have to try one next time with another scoop of ice cream."}
{"text":"I used to go here when it was Mind Over Batter. Didn't know it wasn't there anymore and wanted a cupcake today when i was in that area so i went in..i am so glad i only bought one!! I was stale and dry..seemed more like a biscuit than a cupcake..i won't be going there again"}
{"text":"*NO STARS*

My GF and I had some extreme munchies going on one night recently and wanted some vegan ice cream.
Looked them up online and it said they had some options available...

We get there and they are busy no biggie.

When our turn came I asked the young lady behind the counter to point out their vegan options to save time on trying to figure out which ones were and which ones weren't .

She looked at me like I was from another planet.

She said, \"oh we don't have that\".
I said it says you do online...
Nothing.

I look around and on a chalk board menu it plainly said that they had vegan date shakes!
I'm thinking score!

She turns around to look at the board like she has no idea it was even written there.
Turns back around and shrugs and says sorry we don't have that either.

Fail."}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):
1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

I love ice cream.  I've had amazing ice cream all over the country.  (See review for Sweet Republic on Shea).  I really, really wanted to truly love this place as much as I loved the Indian-inspired ice cream joint that I went to in Columbus, OH.  But sorry to say, I can't.  Not quite yet.

I had no problems with the flavors at all.  I ordered the kulfi and saffron.  Both tasted fine, the saffron was great, even.  The one thing that killed the 4 or 5-star review?  One of the flavors was over-icy and the other was freezer burned.  The texture and consistency were off.  Off enough to make me concerned if I would return.

But I will return.  Hopefully, better texture in the future.  And you should go.  Because the staff is friendly, because they have Indian inspired flavors, and those flavors are good to great.  Looking forward to a review update and a higher rating."}
{"text":"best place to get your Indian Ice Cream fix, they have a great assortment of different flavors from Meetha Pan to Malai Kulfi to Mango. The employees are all very kind and more than willing to give samples."}
{"text":"We came here for a sunday afternoon treat. It was quite spacious inside. 
This is in the same plaza as tempe cinemas youll know when your in the right place because there is a giant ice cream statue outside.. We tried all the indian flavors but they were too strong for us we eventually went with butter pecan and fig which had a light butter flavor. 
We got a double scoop which was plenty for the both of us. The size was for refernce like a Coldstone Love it size. They also had really beautifully decorated cupcakes. I got the the coffee butter cream cupcake and it looked almost too pretty to eat.. This is a cute place to have girl chat and desserts will be back to try more cupcakes."}
{"text":"Great ice cream.  Loved the Indian inspired flavors! The standard flavors were excellent quality too.   service was wonderful & staff was very friendly. Only negatives are: poor seating arrangement  for families, no customer restroom, & they serve coffee but no espresso. Otherwise, I would be 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The ice cream was not fresh and did not have a good texture."}
{"text":"I came here a few weeks after they opened. I am not a fan. I got ice cream and cupcakes. 

I sampled a few ice cream flavours and the interesting flavours were all gritty. The ice cream isn't smooth at all. I am not a fan of that. The two cupcakes I got were both very dry, which was unfortunate. I won't be back."}
{"text":"After leaving my truck to get serviced I decided to walk around the shopping center. Found this place by accident. Really good service the girl was very nice and helpful she let me sample a few flavors before I maid my final decision."}
{"text":"My head said go to the gym but my heart said eat more ice cream...

I've been eyeing this place for a while.  This adorable little shop took over Mind Over Batter and I've been wanting to poke my head in to see what they had to offer.  Jalsa is exactly a mile away from my gym and I always see it when we're heading to EOS.  After an incredibly filling dinner today, like I seriously thought I was gonna explode, I had contemplated going to the gym but I remembered that I've been wanting to try out Jalsa.  So obviously, we're gonna get ice cream instead of working out.

They carry 24 flavors and about half them are Indian inspired.  They have fig, fennel [tastes like you poured lavender essential oil on your tongue], cardamom, cashew raisin, et cetera.  They also have your basic flavors like butterscotch and tutti frutti if you're not as adventurous.  My pal Linh L. and I ended up ordering Kelsa Pistachio [Saffron Pistachio] and Rose ice cream.  They were both crazy delicious and refreshing.  The ice cream was dense and creamy and even as I stood there waiting for Linh to try a bunch of flavors, it didn't melt in this Arizona heat. Wow!

All in all, Jalsa is a cute little ice cream shop with lots to offer. A single scoop ice cream in a cup is $2.99 so feel free to indulge without breaking the bank!"}
