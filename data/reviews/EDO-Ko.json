{"text":"Wednesday, November 4, 2015 Dinner for 3

The menu has a decent selection of raw sushi and cooked options. 

We had:
 1/2 Asian eggplant with dengaku miso glaze - very tasty
35 Sweet Potato Tempura Fries tossed with green seaweed, sea salt - excellent
Atlantic Salmon grilled to perfection. Moist and tender.
3 large Giant Tiger Shrimp grilled
Char-broiled miso-marinated Black Cod - Fish is so fresh and nicely presented!
125 ml warm saki
5 Ounces Luigi Righetti Pinot Grigio

The food is absolutely delicious here. Although we did not have any sushi tonight, I could hear other diners commenting on the awesome quality and presentation of the sushi. I will definitely be coming back here again and this is probably going to be among my top favorite Japanese sushi places! 

Presentation: All of the food was nicely presented.

Service: Excellent! The staff and in particular, Phil are extremely quick and attentive. After giving us the menu, the food came very quickly as well. They are extremely friendly."}
{"text":"Though this restaurant has had some mixed reviews in the past, our dinner in mid-Jan 2014 was excellent. The sashimi was fresh and the cooked dishes tasty.

Service was very friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"This is a decent sushi restaurant, which caters to neighbours and regular customers from the area. Everything is always fresh. I never had problems with sushis or sashimis. They taste great most of the time. At times they felt like they had just come out the freezer. Rolls and gyozas are delicious. But each portion is so small and it is overpriced. We don't get appropriate amount of food for the amount we're paying. 

Service has alwaus been great. I like the ambiance too as it feels intimate but restaurant is oftentimes messy."}
{"text":"Literally the worst Japanese restaurant in the city of Toronto. 

I've been to Edo (both on Eglinton and in the Village) as my go-to sushi restaurant for years because the sushi is actually pretty decent and the dressing is to die for. But time and time again, I am SO disappointed with the service. No matter if you dine-in, take-out, or do delivery, their service is truly the WORST - especially for the ridiculous prices they charge.

They make you feel like you are doing them a favour for eating at their establishment, when really it should be the other way around. They quote you a time for when your food will be ready, and you can always bet to add another hour to that time, sometimes even more. Then, even when they do bring your order, it is always wrong. 

I've always been frustrated eating there, and only keep going back for the convenience of it, but I am officially done and have told all my friends and family to never eat there again - you would be wise to do the same if you want to leave in a good mood, and not entirely frustrated by the experience and shitty customer service there.

Does anyone have any recommendations on sushi restaurants in the Yonge/Eg area now that I refuse to eat here?"}
{"text":"ordered and was told one hour for delivery.  After 80 minutes were told another 20 minutes.  Restaurant was unresponsive when asked for a manager and said they would have to call back.  Cancelled order as we were late for a show.  Will never order from them again."}
{"text":"In my humble opinion there are two types of sushi joints. Ones that push the envelope on Japanese cuisine and those that leave the diner feeling comfortable. You know what I am talking about. That neighbourhood sushi bar around the corner that hits the spot after a long day at work. It doesn't ask too much of you and you just ask that the fish is fresh and doesn't kill you.

Edo-ko is my neighbour sushi place. I have been eating at Edo-ko since it opened in 1997 (I think it was 1997....I have killed a lot of brain cells between then and now) and has been consistently solid in both freshness and quality. 

Over the years I have tried everything on the menu....except for the eggplant.....I hate eggplant. Here are some of my favs.

- Miso soup...simple but delicious
- Chicken teriyaki...ask for all white meat
- Udon noodle soups...I usually get the chicken or veggie
- Spicy tuna roll
- Shrimp tempura roll
- Spicy crab roll

Oh yeah...my cousin goes to this place so often that they actually named a roll after her. Just ask for the \"Sylvia\" roll. I am not going to tell you what's in it....but I think you are going to like it.

Also, try asking for your rolls to be cut into eight pieces. It cuts down on sushi related choking deaths and Edo-ko's sushi chef will be more than happy to oblige.

As you can probably see from my list of favourites, Edo-ko is more about consistently good sushi than broadening your palette for Japanese food. But on a Wednesday night after being abused at work, who really wants to eat raw sea urchins when a California roll is all you really want."}
{"text":"Great sushi, terrible service!

I've been to EDO-Ko many times because of the convenient location, and every time is a similar experience.

The service is very slow and the waiters and waitresses are neither particularly friendly nor very apologetic. After finally ordering and finally receiving most of our food, the sweet potato maki had still not arrived. It took about 10 minutes just to get the waitresses attention and her expression told me that she had totally forgotten about it and she was pretty vague in her response. 10 minutes later, we asked another waiter about where it was, and he finally brought it out. Our waitress didn't apologize for the delay.

When we asked for the cheque, it also took forever to come and again, no apology.

I noticed that people at nearby tables were experiencing the same frustration. 

That being said, I love the sushi, especially the sweet potato maki and sushi pizza. If the food weren't as good, I would definitely not be able to put up with the service."}
{"text":"No idea as to why I would ever consider going TWICE, but sadly I did.

THE Worst, restaurant I have ever been to. It's very unsettling to know they got a bigger place next door that they moved into.

As a Japanese person I am very upset to know that a Japanese restaurant could serve such horrible fish to anyone.
It's the kind of fish that you would see in an all you can eat restaurant (but even worse), and your paying 4 times the price for and given so little.

The order took close to an hour, the service was horrid, we were never looked after. I had to call the waitress multiple times.

There is no effort put into making anything taste or look nice. It's simply the worst.

I would give this location a minus 2.
If you want real fish, good sushi, PLEASE go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had an overpriced mixed experience here for lunch. My daughter's California roll was excellent. Our gyoza -- filled primarily with veal -- was pretty good and out of the ordinary. However: their ginger salad dressing is heavy on the miso; beef takaki was too chewy (clearly not quality meat); eggplant w/ gonzu sauce was over-miso'ed and was too salty. Our server was inattentive, particularly since there was hardly anyone there."}
{"text":"One of the worst Japanese restaurant I've been in my life. Except for their fancy interior, nothing is good about them.

Food here is garbage considering how much they are charging. I got sushi set, complete shit quality, for about $20. On top of that, service here is worse than their food. No one greeted me when I walk in, and it seemed like the servers here forgot how to smile. I was ignored half the time even though the restaurant wasn't too busy.

I would never ever go back here again and neither should you!"}
{"text":"I love this spot. The restaurant is clean and very new looking. The servers are so friendly as well. 

I wouldn't say the food is authentic Japanese, but the portions are large and I always leave pretty full. (Example: they have the biggest handrolls I've ever seen!!!) 

They also have sea urchin, which I'm a huge fan of. It's always so fresh tasting, I keep coming back for more. 

I do agree that it is a little over priced compared to the family sushi restaurants... But it's in Forest Hill, I don't know why everyone is surprised. Lol"}
{"text":"There's an old joke that ends with the punchline \"that's the Church that I go to...and that's the Church that I don't go to\". Swap out \"Church\" for \"Sushi bar\" and you've got my neighbourhood. Where I've lived for almost 8 years. There's another Sushi place just down the road, yet Edo-Ko is the place that I always visit. 

Like most offerings on this strip, Edo-Ko is not exactly bound by authenticity. The gyoza are stuffed with veal or veggies, and the maki likely would not pass muster on the original \"iron Chef\".

But patrons, the vast majority of which are early-daters and families, don't care. Edo-Ko is Granny-sushi at it's best. 

Gyoza are tender and spurting with juice. It's veal rather than pork juice, but they still taste great. Miso soup is warm, simple comfort. Tempura a shoe and I'll eat it. I might even eat it's mate in a batter this light and crisp. An order of fat shrimp and thinly sliced veg disappears, except for a weirdly soggy shiso leaf. 

Sushi offerings are pretty straightforward. Rolls are fun. Ever wonder how many ways you could combine salmon, tuna, fried shrimp, avocado, rice and a bit of seaweed? Come on down and find out!  Squid, octopus, eel and surf clam etc. are available but c'mon. This is Forest Hill. Enough with the treif (and no, fried shrimp does not officially count as treif)! 

There's hot stuff, too, but I wouldn't go to a steakhouse and ask for sushi, either. 

Bonus points if you convince your dad to eat a whole gob of wasabi paste at once."}
{"text":"Based on service alone, this place would only have received one star. The servers didn't really acknowledge us and only came by once to re-fill our tea. It took us an hour to get all of our food to our table. The only reason this review warrants 3 stars is that the food was pretty good. The sashimi was huge! The maki rolls were also well done - not too much rice and just the right size."}
